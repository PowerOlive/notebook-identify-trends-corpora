Morrow has pardoned Geo.Alexander, the Paris banker, whosepeculations made poor hundreds of.Bourocn county people. Every Governor since Alexander's incarceration has been importuned to extendclemency to him, but it remainedfor our Republican friend to freetie man, who by high living and alavish expenditure of money for-yomen and wine, wrecked manyhomes of his home town. G6v. Morrow gives as his reason for grantingthe pardon, that 'justice is satisfi-e-1.'May be it is, but the people andHie law are not. Their wishes arcceitainly due some consideration."The Cynthiana Democrat says:'Comment is superfluous on Gov.Morrow's pardon of George Alexander, the swell Paris banker whosopeculations, that he might scatter55 tips among New York bell boysand lead a high life with 'wine,women and song,' wrecked the fortunes of the poor and needy, thehalt, the lame and the blind. Therecord speaks for itself. The people know the Governor based hiscampaign for election largely onthe alleged abuse of the pardoningpower by his Democratic predecessors. The Democratic Governors refused to pardon Alexander."COLD CHECK WORKER ARRESTED.

This sets at rest the rumors that have been in circulationfor some time regarding the possible erection of a modern hotelbuilding there.Several months ago a group ofbusiness men were at luncheon inthe Stout Cafe, when the subject ofa modern hotel for Paris, and theurgent need of such, became themain topic of discussion. It wasproposed to organize a stock company, sell shares in same at figuresthat would enable anyone to investin the enterprise, and place the affair on a solid basis. The projectwas thoroughly discussed from everypossible angle and the conclusionarrived at that the project war.feasible. Nothing was done in theRSatter, which was left open for further actiou. "It has lately been revived and onTuesday at a meeting of well-knownbusiness men and farmers the project was given a new ijnpetus, dueto the decision of Mr. Simms not tobuild. It is said that one of thebest-known and most prominentfarmers of the county is taking thelead in the matfer and is making acanvass of the business men andwealthy farmers of the county, having in view the erection of a modern hotel. Several sites for thebuilding are under consideration,and options have b'een secured onthem, although the exact locationwill ' be determined later. It wasstated yesterday that taking ofstock subscriptions will begin in afew days.

He enumeratedamong the petitions for clemencyone signed by the twelve jurors, nletter from Victor Bradley, Commonwealth's Attorney, who said:"I feel that this conviction and imprisonment satisfies the law." Another from Circuit Judge Robert L.Stout, who said: "The Commonwealth, agreed to accept a conviction with five years' confinement.If the State evidenced a dispositionto be then satisfied with five years,why should itvnow be disposed toexact a greater penalty?" A petitionsigned by 75 per cent, of the depositors of the bank, another signedby 50 citizens of Bourbon, county,one signed by leading citizens ocFayette county and a recommendation by other prominent people.While in prison Alexander hadkept books at the shirt factory. Hehad been expecting' his pardon.The Cincinnati Enquirer of Wednesday had the following:"George Alexander, Paris, Ky.fbanker, who was pardoned from theKentucky penitentiary by GovernorEdwin P. Morrow, Monday, is passing a few days in Cincinnati withfriends.""I was treated with every consideration while in confinement," saidsaid Mr. Alexander, "and I have nocomplaint to make of any one.More than 70 per cent, of theamount lost by depositors in thefailure of my bank has been restoredto them, and I feel confident thatafter pending court proceedings theywill get every cent due them. I shallremain in Cincinnati a few days andthen go to New York, whei;e I expect to establish connections witha financial institution.""During his confinement Mr. Alexander lost nearly 150 pounds, buthe appears well, aside from theprison pallor, which he expects soonwill disappear."ioGEO.

In the safe at thejtime were 186 sacks of money, theentire receipts of Saturday on theGreen Line system.The offices of the company 'arelocated a half block from the Covington police headquarters.The robbers opened the safe bymeans of a powerful triangularshaped clamp which pulled out thecombination. The cracksmen evidently were unable to carry away allthe money, for much of it was leftbehind.The robbers did not disturb alarge number of Liberty bonds thatwere in the safe. It is believed thatthe thieves removed their plunder ofsilver and banknotes in an automobile. The robbers got into the buildingby, forcing a basement door on thePark Street side. They proceeded tothe first floor landing' but wereblocked by another locked door.They forced this with a "jimmy."To apply the clamp the robbersdrilled holes on either side of thecombination. The clamp was equipped with a powerful leverage mechanism, the combination was pulledout, and the door swung open. Fourgreat sacks, containing 186 smallersacks of money, were in view of thethieves. They united these andpoured the contents, several thousand dollars, into receptacles. Moneywas spilled upon the vault floor.The robbery was discovered Monday morning by Josephine Kyles, aclerk. Inspector Ed. Dukes of thecar company has offices adjoiningthe room in which the vault is situated. He worked until midnightSunday night, and it is believed thatthe robbers entered after that hour.William H. Harton, general manager of the car company, estimatedthat the robbers obtained between$3,000 and $4,000.

"I had the 'flu' last springand it left my system in bad shape.My stomach was so weak I couldn'tstand even the lightest of foods. Ifelt bilious all the time and was subject to frequent smothering spells.""Trutona had done my mother somuch good that I decided to try itmyself. The benefits I gained arareally better than I even expected.When I had finished my third bottleof Trutona, I felt as strong as Tever did. And I'm still feeling thatway. My nerves are strong andsteady now and I'm eating' heartierthan ever. I'm working at thedepartment store every day now,too, and I feel so good all the timeThat I don't have a chance to complain."

There is only one way tocure catarrhal deafness, and that isby a constitutional remedy. Catarrhal Deafness is caused by an inflamedcondition of the mucous lining ofEustachian Tube. When this tubeis inflamed you have a rumblingsound or imperfect hearing, andwhen it is entirely closed, deafnessis the result. Unless the inflammation can be reduced and this tuberestored to its normal condition,hearing will be destroyed forever.Many cases of deafness are causedby catarrh, which is an inflamedcondition of the mucous surfaces.Hall's Catarrh Medicine acts thruthe blood on the' mucous surfaces ofthe system.We will give One Hundred Dollars 'for any case of Catarrhal Medicine.
