Collins pooled his tobacco ardlater shipped it to Cincinnati and soldit. He was indicted and fined $150 forthis offense. The court ays the actual sale in Cincinnati of the pooled tobacco was a mere incident, as the taking of the tobacco outvof Mason countywas a violation of thev peol contract.The opinion says this is not the samecase as O'JBanion against Commonwealth from Owen, as in that case thepooling contract authorized O'Banipnto store his tobacco outside the Stateand while it was stored in Cincinatihe sold it, thus taking the whole transaction out of the State.Trots at Mt.

In this method of arranging the valves onopposite sidesif themotor, the tops of the cylinders arenot burdened with long rocker armsand springs, which are demanded whenone or both valves are placed in thehead of the cylinder.8 Moreover, placing the valveH on both sides makes themotor morn accessible and the manifolds and other auxiliaries being moreequally distributed on both sides of thecylinder, there is a better balance oft lese parts.

A very advanced feature ofgreat practical worth in the motor ofModel 35 is the use of eccentric camand pump shaft bushings, thus allowing exact meshing of the timing gears.The suspension of the motor is bymeans of a tnree point support the advantages of which are so well knownthat it requires but little comment.The three-point support obviates anypossibility of twisting stresses fromthe frame being receiver by the motorand supports the weight of the motormore satisfactory than any other typeof suspension.Crank shaft Crank shafts are Jmadeof a special alloy .steel forging, heattreated with the greatest of care andmachined and ground to exact diamensions.

'VOTE AGAINST CUT-OUTBourbon Growers Met - SaturdayAfternoon and DeclareAgainst the Movement.MEETING WELL ATTENDEDMajority of the Tobacco GrowingCounties Are In Fayor ofthe Cut Out Pledge.The, tobacco growers of Bourboncounty in convention Saturday afternoon voted to grow tobacco this year.The convention was largely attended,more interest being manifested in themeeting than at any time during thestruggle of the growers in the combatagainst the trust.Fully two hundred and fifty groweisassembled at the court house Saturdayafternoon at 1 o'clock, and atll:30 .theconvention was called to order by Mr.Kenney Nichols, a prominent tobaccogrower of Hutchison, who had beendesignated as temporary chairman.After reading- the call issued fromI the headquarters of the Burley Tobacco Union at Lexington, Mr. Nicholsaddressed the assembled growers brief-ily.setting forth the object of themeeting. He declared he was willingto abide by the decision of the majorityg of the growers present,, but as hehad attended the meeting held in Lexington on January 5, at which thirty-; one out of thirty-four tobacco growing! counties had endorsed .the cut-outmovement, and while it was immateri-al t0 nif interests which course waspursued, he deemed at wise to followwith th.. mninrit"v" -"r .-- "Mr. Nichols also stated that tne majority of the growers" of this countywho opposed the cut-out pledge werethose who had disposed of their tobacco, 'and those who favored the movement were the growers who had agreat amount of tGbacco on theirhands. He said this year should bethe cleaning up year. With a crop thisi year, he declared, the price of tobaccowould suffer a decline, resulting in thefarmers being unable to obtain a bet-a ..i . .ter price than seven cents for theirproduct.The convention then pioceeded toorganize and nominations for a permanent chairman were heard. WarrenRogers, ot Flat Rock, a bitter opponent to the cut-out pledge, was nominated as was John T. Collins, formersecretary of the Burley Tobacco Society and H. S. Caywood, of NorthMiddletown. The latter two withdrewwhen the vote was being taken and amotion to make Mr. Rogers' nomination unanimous met with but little opposition. The organization was completed by the selection of T. Hart Tal-! bott a Secretary.j After the election of a chairman andsecretary, Mr. D. C. Lisle ofiered aj resolution to be presented before theI convention condemning the cut-out, movement as outlined by the Burley1 Tobacco Union. The resolution is asj follows:i "Resolved. By the tobacco grower.-' of Bourbon county that we earnestlycondemn the movement to cut out tnej 1911 tobacco crop. This movement, .if! consummated would force the breakingof many contracts already made;v.ould be a great wrong and hardshipJ to the tenants and their employes ;would completely break up and denior-; alize their business arrangementsfori the year, and would compel manyofthem to leave the btate."It would also infringe upon therights of the land-holders by attempting to control what they shall do inthe management of their own privatepropprty We therefore hereby de-! clare our rightand determination toexercise our own judgment at the'same time freely granting the samerights to others to absolutely control1 the matter as to whether we shall individually raise a crop in 1911."Any other course is entirely destructive to our libreties under thelaw, and to the necessary Drotection' f .iM .,t I x ?x, ux u. ii a aim property ngnis.Chairman Rogers called for a voteon the resolution before the cunventiun. The aye and nay vote was taken,the chairman declaring the resolutionhad carried and the convention adjourned amid a storm of protests fromthe advocates of the cut-out movementwhose contention was that the votewas so close a count should have beentaken.P1fri inflVPIYlPllf in 1Q11 lt?oo nlanrlitshown hv hp mHn hpi,i t,afternoon by the Burley growers.Seventeen out of twenty-five counties; reporting Satruday night favored reso- ihitinns for thp pnt-nnf nlan runontlI adopted at the meetiSc of the BIevTobacco Union held in LevinatonL few coSnties her! we?e Snly a, sn all VunTbe? of ' S?e iJattendSncJand these favored the cutting out offne 1911 croD andp,.nn in mi?the pooling ofthetheOnly five countUs turned downproposition and in three no actionproposition anu in tnree no action was.fn 'ru . n ii. j-' "cii. xuc K"'nri3 tu over tne uist:i.irii'i. : reenthusiastic over the pros-peCts for no crop 1 thismany of the meetincs Sjyear and atmany of the meetings Saturday after-noon a large acreage was immediately t' signed for the 1911 cut out.I The following is the results of the' meetings in the counties in which 'I they were held : 'Bath county Big meeting and 145 I, growers pledged 922 acres to the cutout and county is expected to be unani-mous.
