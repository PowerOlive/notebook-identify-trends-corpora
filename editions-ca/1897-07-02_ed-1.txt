did not ask from whom itwas but obeyed orders and brought itdirect to youFor which you have my thanksPeter and I will see that you are fullypaid in the futureIn a few moments the patriotic girlwas left alone and after another reading1 of the letter which told how thewriter Capt Nolan James a youthfulofficer in the continental army had beencaptured by a detachment of Britishtroops and conveyed to New Yorkthen in possession of the enemy Theletter seemed to crumple in her resolute hand and when she entered thehouse she flung- it upon the table andpicked up another letter lying thereUnfolding- this one she glanced overthe lines which traced in a bold masculine hand ran as followsCapt Basil Lee of the royal forcesbegs leave to accept Miss Betty Logansinvitatiofi to dine with her Tuesday andwill be promptly on hand Wishing hisfair hostess health and happiness hesigns himself her ardent friendCAPT BASIL LEEFourth DragoonsNew York July 2 17S0A faint smile appeared at Bettysmouth as she perused the acceptanceand placed it beside the one from herpatriotic loverCapt Lee had met her during one ofthe many incursions made by the royaldragoons along the Hudson andthough an nemy to American freedomthe girl had found him an agreeablevisitor Ignorant of Capt James misfortune she invited the British officerto dinewjth her on the Fourth as shelived almost alone in the old homestead her parents having died a shortiime prior to the beginning of hostilities- f -rtThe imprisonment of Capt Jameswould naturally interfere with thepleasures of the coming- day but whenthe morning- of the Fourth came therewere no traces of regret on the fairrebels faceAt ten oclock Peter who had beensent to a certain point from which theroad leading to New York was visiblefor a long distance came back with abroad grin on his faceI was thinking Miss Betty what anice thing- it would be if we could justcontrive to exchange Capt Nolan forCapt LeeiThe girl seemed to startWhat nonsense Peter she exclaimed Whatever put that idea intoyour headIt just walked in smiled the manYou see theyre equal in rank andCaptains both broke in the girllooking- across the porch from the opendoor These Utopian

receptionThe old fashioned clock in the widehallway vas striking- 11 when a handsome young officer in the somewhatflashy uniform of the Royal Dragoonsone of the crack regiments in the kingsservice drew rein in front of the houseand dismountedHis riding boots were polished to perfection and he had brushed from themthe few flecks of mud they had encountered on the way up He looked assuringly at the house with its prettyflower beds on the lawn and the trellised porch upon which stood a rocking-chairMiss Bettys favorite seatThrowing the lines over a post to awaitPeters attention the young captainsauntered towards the house and justas he mounted the steps a vision of loveliness appearedMiss Betty was simply but tastefullydressed and looked very pretty thus arrayedShe smiled a cordial welcome to theofficer as he came on and took his outstretched hand without a show oftreacheryThough we differ about the warCapt Lee said she in her sprighiiymanner I cannot help asking- you forthe latest news from the frontThere is but little to communicateThere has been no set engagement oflate the two armies seem to be planning for position and it is doubtful ifa battle will come off for some timeThat is good I do not like to hearof bloodshed It is bad enough in thispart of the country between the forayers but when large armies meet indeadly conflict it is much worse Stilland her eyes seemed to sparkle wecannot gain our independence withoutsome bloodshedCapt Lee smiledI will never be able to convince youI see he said Like Ephraim MissBetty you are joined to your idolsYes captain to the idols of libertyand prosperity for America You mustadmit that you find our soldiers mendifficult to conquer When people fightfor their homes and native land they donot give up the struggle without a terrible contestBut in this case they are rebelliousand the king will not stop short of theirentire subjectionThe young girls gaze wandered fromthe room and for a little while seemedto rest on the bushes on the lawnSuddenly however she turned againto the officer and saidOne of my friends has had the misfortune to become a prisoner of warIndeed Miss Betty exclaimedCapt Lee in the most innocent mannerpossible But that is one of thesitudes of war Your friend must putup with it and consider that imprisonment is far better than being left on thebattlefieldI do not doubt that bur confinement to Capt James is irksome to saythe leastThe British officer seemed to rtart alittle at mention of his rivals nameCapt James is confined in NewYork continued Betty He was captured in a skirmish and hurried thitherExchange is hardly to be thought ofyou know since our people do not holds prisoner an officer of equal rankLiii- ArOZhe conversation now drifted toother subjects and Capt Lee was mostpleasantly entertained by his fair hostessHe knew that Betty Logan was in-I suppose I wouldnt be allowed tosing that in New York -exclaimedBetty turning round and catching- asign of the captains

left the parlorIt seems to me that she might betamed passed through Capt Leesmind The girl is a real jewel andwould make an excellent wife So herfriend Capt James is enjoying thedelicacies of prison

Iwonder if that fellow attended promptly to my horseThe British captain was on the eveof rising when Betty again appeared inthe doorway and announced dinnerShe had made a little change in hertoilet and looked prettier than everand Capt Lee with an appetite sharpened by his ride from the city to saynothing of the wait in the parlor rosewith alacrityThe dining room was tastefullytrimmed with flowers and evergreenthe work of which Betty ascribed to hermaid Polty and Polly blushing to thetips of her fingers as it seemed acknowledged the compliments with aconfused courtesyBetty poured the tea as she chattedaway and Polly was near by to seethat Capt Lee as her mistress guestwanted for nothingThe table was spread with the delicacies of the season which told CaptfiLeetgjgfrfchft young-

moment the melodiousvoice of the girl seemed to fill the houseas she sang the piece which had received encore after encore in the theaters wherever the British held swayCapt Lee listened like one entrancedand his gaze followed her every movement like one enrapturedPerhaps 3rou have heard this saidBetty as the last note died away andforthwith slie started up with a rollicking cowboy air such as the wild marauders of the Neutral Ground werewont to sing when out on their foraysIt was full of the most rebellioussentiment and some of its pointed allusions to King- George drove the colorfrom Capt Lees faceBut he was not in a position to grumble for had not Betty sang a real royalair He sat mutely and listened as thesong crept on and on the girl seemingto take delight in tingling the ears ofI

You are a prisoner subjectto exchange for another prisoner ofequals rank These gentlemen constitute the only dessert I have to offerwith profuse apologiesAt first Capt Lee thought of resistance but

one of themost prominent ranchmen in the southwest At this time and place the BioGrande is a pretty fair sized streamIt is nearly a quarter of a mile wideAt the fording- place there is justenough water to swim a cow in thedeepest place It was not supposedhowever and it certainly was not thecase that the cattle would remain inthe fording place As it turned outthey occupied and- performed countlessmaneuvers over about a mileThe labor of the day began aboutthe middle of the forenoon The greatherd of lowing quadruped were drivendown at the foot of the old Mexicantown across the river and on the longbar that faces the stream There wasan army of Mexicans on every side tokeep them in place A dozen bestrodelank horses the remainder was afootThere was an abundance of little brownboys each with two frail garments andas many powerful lungs The cattlewere driven along the bar up under thebridge and to a point above the twotowns to the fording- place And herethe leaders were headed out into thestreafn They took to the water withapparent willingness and lashed theirtails and proceeded with a great splashing-sound as the 8000 sfeet began tosmite the water When they were abouthalf submerged the leaders turned alittle to the right down stream As ifby previous arrangement the wholeright flank turned in the same direction and the multitude separated andbecame many little groups The horsemen dashed in- below them with Indianyells A dozen men were suddenlynaked and they were swimming rapidly out toward the heads of the leaderswith the intention of turning themSome of them carried clubs in theirhands as they swam and when theycame up with the doimb brutes thebeat upon their faces Some wereturned in the right direction manyhundreds less roughly urged wadedaimlessly down

waterand swam Little more than theirheads was visible and a thousandhorns suggestive of brush in floodtime caught the sunlight They floatedwithout apparent effort with the current with none to control them andwhen they sought the bank it was onthe side of the river from that whichthey had started and at about the samepoint The group that had been madeto cross to the Texas side stood passivelj

the afternoonsomething- like 1500 had been landedon the Texas side They stood quietlyenough when they were over and gavebut little trouble to the herders Butthose not yet across were naturallythose least willing to cross and all thata cow do that is obstinate was doneon this occasion They appeared tohave n great deal more endurance thanthe horses They would reach the bankfor the hundredth time and race withthe spirit of a young yearling just released from a barn The Mexicans began to rope and throw some of the mostmischievous of the evil doers that theymight not lead the others astray andafter falling hard enough to break alimb they wTould get up ready for another mad dash The herders rivaledthem in enduranceOne deep chested fellow was thrownfrom his horse just as the latter wasscrambling out of the water on a slipperj bank the animal stumbling Herolled over and over and then jumpedup and started in pursuit of his frightened steed The race was about equalbut another horseman came to the rescue and caught a bridle rein of the runaway One slip of a boy followed asteer that had got awaj in the waterby himself and by swimming- alwaysin the right place and yelling in justthe proper manner he succeeded in driving the big- fellow across A greatcheer went up from the bridge and itwas faintly echoed by the people alongthe Mexican sideLate in the day the- cattle that

ROYAL COURTSMournlns for Rulers and PrincesKeeps Royalties in Perpetual BlackCourt mourning may be described asthe nightmare of European court life-as well as that portion of the officialworld and of society which is more orless intimately connected with theiOnrt o entertainments can ever be- no festivity planned withoutthe everlasting- dread of some royaldeath taking place to render necessarya postponement or an abandonment of-the entire affair Annoying for the menit is still more so for the women since- never know until the last minutewhether they can wear colors orwhether they are condemned to garments of sable line For even when theJ jJlationship of the dead prince or princess of the blood is so remote as to render unnecessary the postponement of-social and official functions and entertainments court mourning is nevertheless necessary for a period ranging ailtiie way from ten days to three monthsduring- which time eveiy woman withpretensions to social standing is expected to array herself in black and toa elegate her diamonds her rubies her-sapphires and her emeralds and her turquoises to her casket and to wearnothing in the shape of jewelry butpearls which are the symbol of tearswhile the men are expected to add a-mourning Toand to their hats to restrictthemselves to black ties for day weariand if entitled to wear a uniform toadorn the sleeves thereof with an armband of crapeJloyal persons and court officials are-great sticklers about such matters asthese and while any lady who ventures during a period of court mourningto attend a drawing room or court f unction in colored attire exposes herself toan ungracious reception on the part ofthe royal personages present there have-even been numerous occasions where-women have actually been prevented by-the officials of the lord chamberlainsdepartment from entering the presence-of royalty at all in consequence of theirbeing- dressed otherwise than in the prescribed black toilets N Y Tribune-Petroleum I

CHARLES KINGLCopyright 1894 by J B Lippincott CoXVI ContinuedThen when May came round andLambert asked for three days leaveMinor hummed and hawed and lookedat his staff officer and finally requestedthat it be submitted to writing andit came back with a curt indorsement to the effect that Lieut Lambertwould be expected hereafter to showmore interest in matters connectedwith his regimental duties the application was disapprovedAll this time he had written every fewweeks to Close and got a very nice letter in reply written hy a young fellow who announced himself as the captains brother Wallace The captainwas getting better very much betterbut the eye doctors bill was a big oneand he thought the government oughtto pay it He had bought some land upthere six years before and what withschools and roads and bridges the taxeswere awful What he wouldnt minddoing would be to come back to theregiment as quartermaster but inthose days there was no four year limitto staff positions and the incumbentsboth adjutant and quartermaster proposed to hang on as long as possibleand Lambert replied that he fearedthere would be no chanceAnd then one day there came a telegram to the commanding officer of Company G at the barracks with the briefannouncement that a soldier serving inthe Twenty sixth infantry under thename of Roberts had been identified byCorporal Floyd Walton Fourth cavalryas Private Iviggs a deserter from theteenth Please send charges anddescriptive list Two weeks later LieutLambert was summoned to Austin as awitness before the general court-martial appointed for his trial The Morgan line steamer would not sail untilSaturday night There was time to ruuover and see if the Waltons had notsomething to send to their soldier boyin Texas and Lambert sent his trunkto the Morgan wharf while the Mobileboat paddled him away through theEigolets and out into Mississippi soundand landed him at the familiar pier atPass Christian just at twilight of alovely May evening Ten minutes walkalong the shore brought him to an inclosure wherein the moonbeams werebeginning to play among the leaves ofthe magnolia and to throw a huge blackshadow that of the grove of live oaksover the veranda of an old whitepainted southern homestead bowered invines and shrubbery at the end of thebroad shell pathway leading from thegate Somewhere among the foliage amocking bird was caroling to the risingmoon and the music of soft girlishvoices and subdued laughter came drifting out on the evening air Lambertsheart gave a quickened throb or twoas he recognized Kate Waltons unmistakable tones He had to traversethe length of the moonlit walk Shewith her unseen friend was in shadowso there was no possibility of trying theeffect of surpriseWell whayuhn the wide wuhld Jdyou come from was her nonchalantgreeting Ah supposed you weredaydn buried There is no such thingas spelling that word as pronounced bythe rosiest sauciest and possibly sweetest little mouth in creation He couldnot take his eyes from it and she knewit MissAwgdenthisisMr LambertAh think youve heard sister Esthuhspeak of him Ah suppose you want togo right in to see huh Ahll call huhdownSo Lambert made his bow to MissOgden who had her own womanly intuitions as to the extent of his eagerness to see sister Esther and who presently declared she had to go home andwent without much delay over theleave taking in spite of Katesies voluble remonstrance and well feigned disappointment Miss Walton in facthung on to her all the way to the gateand made every proper and apparenteffort to detain her there but a wisehead had Miss Bettie Ogden she wouldnot delay She had heard sister Esthertalk of Mr Lambert time and againand had read in Katesies significantsilence or simulated scorn a whole volume of information She went trippinglightly laughingly away and Katesiewatched her until she was out of sightthen came dawdling slowly back Shewell knew it would be unlike
