ON BLENDED WHISKY.
An additional revenue tax which it
is estimated will net the government
an extra million a year, is to be im
posed on rectifiers and blenders of,
and wholesale dealers in whisky,
This proposed tax was affixed to the
Tariff Bill by the Senate Finance Com
mittee Friday, and provides that the
dealers affected must, in the future,
pay for the affixed to each package
of whisky make up in their establish
ments. At present the Government
supplies the package stamps free of
charge.
The finance Committee has provided'
a charge of 25 cents per stamp on
every package of whisky made up
after the passage of the current Tariff
Bill. Straight whisky made by distil
lers is not affected by the amendment.
Whatever the size of the package
only one stamp is required, however.
The minimum weight of such packages
as prescribed by law is five gallons,
which limitation automatically ex
empts liquor dealers.
If you are satisfied with bad roads,
keep Dundon in office. If you want
good roads for the taxes you pay vote
against him. Vote for McMillan for
County Judge.

The quality of the wheat cop,
now being threshed in Woodford
is excellent, the grain testing from 60
to 63 pounds per acre. The yield ran
ges from twelve to eighteen bushels
per acre with a few crops averaging
twenty-five bushels. Versailles buyers
are paying 93 cents per bushel and
many farmers are selling at that price,
though quite a number will hold with
the expectation of receiving $1 later.
One of the biggest lot of lambs
ever sold at one time in Clark county
exchanged hands when H. C: Caywood,
of Bourbon, purchased from Brock
Bros., and Ernest Allen, of that county
850 lambs, averaging 85 pounds, at 6
cents per pound. These lambs were
refused the buyers in June at seven
cents. Although the price is a quarter
of a cent lower, there is a difference
of about ten pounds to the lamb in
weight.

Church at a meeting held after the

Christian character and high social,
moral and business standing of Mr. T.

CORROBORATION.
Of Interest to Paris Readers.
For months Paris citizens have seen
in these columns enthusiastic praise
of Doan's Kidney Pills by Paris resi
dents. Would these prominent people
recommend a remedy that had not
proven reliable? Would they confirm
their statements after years had elaps
ed if personal experience had not
shown the remedy to be worthy of en
dorsement? The following statement
shouldxcarry conviction to the mind of
every Paris reader.
Mrs. Ida Huffman, 115 Main St., Par
is, Ky., says:' "We think Doan's Kid
ney Pills advertised, I got a supply at
Wilson's Drug Store (now Butler &
Co.'s Drug Store) and gave them a
trial. I was very much pleased with
the results."
For sale by all dealers. Price 50
cents. Foster-Milburn Co., Buffalo, N.

RAISING OF CALVHS
ON SKIMMED MILK. '
Calves raised on skimmed milk can
develop into first class dairy cows.
On hundreds of. farms, skimmed milk
constitute the portion of the feed of
the young calf and such, calves make
as good cows as those- receiving whole
milk.
It costs a great deal less to raise" a
calf on skimmed milk than on whole
milk. By this plan the cream can he
sold and made into butter and bhe pro
ceeds added to the farm income.
Calves as well as on skimmed milk
whether skimmed by hand or with a
cream separator, but- skimmed milk
from the separator has the advantage
of being fresh and warm and sweet
when fed. Where as many as three or
four cows are milked regularly, a sep
arator will prove a paying proposition-.
It saves a great deal of time and labor
in setting the milk away for the cream
to raise and in cleanmg milk vessels.
. Feeding skimmed milk develops a
large stomach in the calf. This is ex
ceedingly desirable because, after a
fbig udder, the most valuable point iv
& cow is a large capacious paunch in
Iwhinh aha mnv atrwa Tiot faatJ "En-aw
great nmk cow without exception haj
a large barrel.
The calf may be allowed to remain
with its mother for five or six days,
at which the time the milk is usually fit
to be saved. It should then be taken
away from the cow and if possible
out of her sight and hearing.
During the first week after removal
from its mother, it should receive
about nine pounds of milk a day, di
vided into two or three feeds, prefer
ably into three. After this, skimmed
milk should begin gradually to replace
the whole milk so that by the time
the calf is three weeks old it is get
ting skimmed milk only, the quantity
varying from 12 to 18 pounds a day
according to the size and thriftness of
the calf. A teaspoon full of flour
added to each feed of skimmed milk
adds to the feeding value and prevents
scours. The skimmed milk should al
ways be fed warm, 90 to 100 degrees
or blood heat being about right.
The bucket from which the calf is
fed should be washed and scalded af
ter each feeding. The use of filthy
slop buckets and unclean and sour
milk will surely result in unthrifty
calves and in a great deal of trouble
with scours.
Within three or four weeks the calf
will begin to eat bran and shelled
corn, and will nibble at hay. A small
amount of these materials should
therefore be provided. Good -clean
clover or alfalfa hay gives the best
results. Care should be taken not to
give too much grain. A safe rule is
to give a little less than the calf will
clean up.
At the age of ten or twelve weeks,
if a good pasture is available, the
calf will be able to get a living from
grass. When this is the case the
skimmed milk will be withdrawn. Care
should be taken at this time to avoid
stunting the calf and enough grain
should be given to keep it in a thrifty
growing condition, but not fat.
Teaching the calf to drink out of a
bucket requires a little patience.
Gently back the calf into a corned of
the stall, stand astride the youngster,
wet the fingers in milk and tet the
calf get a taste of the milk. Then
gently lower the hand into the pail,
the calf meanwhile sucking the fing
ers. Allow it to continue sucking the
hand and it will meanwhile be suck;
ing or drinking the milk. Then gently
remove the hand and the calf will
continue to drink the milk. Some
times it is necessary to allow the calf
to go 24 hours without food before it
will allow itself to be fed from th
bucket.
Teaching the calf to eat grain may
be accomplished by daubing a little
bran on the nose after it has finished
drinking its milk. In licking this off
it will learn to eat the feed, a small
quantity of which should De placed
before it It will learn to eat hay
without any special encouragement
