Paris people, especially those

the death of Col. J. Embry Allen,

home in Lexington, after an illness
of seven weeks. He was well-known
in legal circles in this city, and was
accounted a brilliant lawyer and a
deep thinker.
Col. Allen was Major of the Sec
ond Batallion of Second Kentucky
Volunteers in the Spanish-American
war. He was one of the most popu
lar officers in the regiment. Just be
fore their removal from Camp Geo.
Thomas, the members of this batal
lion presented him with a handsome
sword as a token of their honor and
esteem. He was every inch a soldier
and a most capable officer. It was
much regretted that his disabilities
prevented him from going to the
front in the world war. Two of his
fellow-officers, Capt. Chas. D. Winn
and Second Lieutenant Neville Fish
er, both, of Paris in Co. I, Second
Kentucky, recruited largely from
Bourbon county, have been promoted
for distinguished services, to the
rank of Major."
