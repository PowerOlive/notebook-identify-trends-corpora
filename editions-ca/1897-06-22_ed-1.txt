signs or activity Thursday another expeditionwas landed in Havana province thistime only 15 miles from Havana inGuanabcoa This is the second expedition landed in Havana province during the present monthAdvices from Puerto Principe statethat the rebels are active in that province Several skirmishes between insurgents and Spanish forces have recently occurred During the last weeka Spanish column

dares to assume that Las Villas is pacified we are defeating inopen field his columns and our cavalry with its machete charges routs theenemy This was done recently bythe forces under the Cuban brigadierJose Miguel Gomez and those underCol Jose de J Monteaguddo and similar encounters are frequentWhen the Spanish columns make thewoods tremble with their cannonadeand musketry when they have beencompelled to execute quick marchesand to hide during the night in theirencampments in the woods withoutdaring to light camp fires for fear ofour sharpshooters the papex s in Sancti Spiritus assert that this part of theisland is pacified Similar assertion ismade inrespect to Pinar del Rio andMatanzas though in these provincescontinuous fighting is going on underthe leadership of active and able

children and old menThe war continues with success inspite of Weyler his men and his infamy I dare affirm based upon myexperience in this kind of warfarethat the winter campaign will soon beover and our army will be unimpairedand the Spanish cause without any advantage The revolution is thereforestronger than ever and we shall continue without serious obstacle withgreater faith as to the ultimate resultWe hold very dear the lives of ourgallant soldiers and in order to sparethem we are willing to make a pecuniary sacrifice though we are convincedthat independence will soon be reached Spains

on rules will bring1 in aspecial order on Monday forof the bill appropriatingmoney to repair the dry dock at theBrooklyn navy yard and the bill willno doubt be passed VThe republican senators in chargeof the tariff bill begin to feel thatjtheend almost is in sight They do nothope to conclude the consideration ofthe bill by the close of the presentweek but they expect by that time tobe able to say when they can completethe workAs a matter of fact the difficulty ofadjusting differences in their dvvnparty is causing the managers moreperplexity at present than i the openopposition to the bill in the senate Ithas been found almost impossible toharmonize contending forces amongrepublicans on the tobacco and woolschedules The differences on tobaccohave been compromised though not tothe satisfaction of all concerned andif there should be another caucus before the tobacco schedule is taken upin the senate the question is liable tobe reopened thereThe wool schedule will confront thesenate at the opening of the sessionMonday and it is Senator Allisonspurpose to press the schedule forwardto a close Hence it will be impossible to postpone for a very much longertime the settlement of the differenceson this question It is expected thatif the committee should not be ableto announce a determination by sometime Monday the matter will be referred to an early caucus or a caucusmay be called if the committee fixesa rate not satisfactory to the woolmen There is little doubt that anadvance will be conceded by the committee but the question of interestis whether the increase will be allthat the wool men demandThe wool schedule will of coursegive rise to an animated debate butthe democratic senators say there is nodisposition on their part to needlesslyprolong it There are also numerousarticles on the free list and in thesundry schedule which will arousedifferences of opinion and ifthe republicans do not withdraw theinternal revenue features of the billthere will be a sharp clash over thisThey are practically decided howeverto retreat from these provisions It isalso practically determined that thehouse provision in regard do Ha waiiansugar will be continued pending thedisposition of the Hawaiian annexationtreatyFor the rest the question of reciprocity and the problem presented by thetrusts in connection with the tariffsare still undetermined by

going on in the household for there were days when shelay dull and apathetic yet mercif alyspared from suffering it was Esthersduty and fondest care to minister toher mothers needs even at a time whenher heart was torn with anxiety on account of her husband now a prisonerin the hands of the United States marshal at the capital and of her brotherwho under the orders of the general incommand of the department had beensent under guard to New Orleans Lhereto await his trial by court martial forthe crime of desertion The visits ofthe old family physician were frequentfor the invalid had had too much to suffer and seemed incajiable of furtherstruggle Floyd was twice permittedto visit his mother during the two daysthat elapsed before telegraphic orderscame in his case She knew him clungto him yet seemed unable to realisethat he was going from her She onceor twice asked if Judge Summers hadbeen heard froni for Cousin Barfc hadwritten full details of Floyds troubleand the family united in urging him tomake an appeal to certain influentialfriend of the ante bellum days whohad scandalized the Waltons by theirloyalty to the old flag Then Lambertwrote a- letter which Close signed and- sent to the department headquartersand the boy remembering some kindwords said to him by his fathers oldfriend ventured on a personal letterto the general himself pleading Waltons case and portraying the familysdistress It was this letter that overcame Esthers objection to the adviceof Mr Potts to the effect that they takeMr Lambert in as a day boarder Andwithin 4S hours of his initial appearanceat their table Mrs Seroggs as he wasthenrst to address his blushing hostesswas more than reconciled to the stepCut if she was Miss Kate was notThe wrath and indignation of thatyoung lady can hardly be described Itwas one thing she declared for her tosell eggs and butter to a gentleman whowas a friend of Floyds who told her hedespispd his captain as much as she didwho had enlisted only because he hadbeen promised immediate promotion toa captaincy and who never would havedone so even then had he known thatsoldiers could be used to persecute thepeople of the south He was only waiting for his commission to come or hisdischarge to tell Capt Close what hethought of his conduct It was all verywell to make friends with a gentlemanlike Mr Biggs who had been dearbrother Floyds friend at Quitman before he fell in love with that horriddesigning Yankee girl who had led himon to cohtin her when she was allthe time engaged to that rich ragpickeror whuteveh he might be Mr Biggshad behaved like a puhfect gentlemanShe had forgotten the little bill he hadbeen running up and was so long vainlyimportuned to pay She also attachedslight importance to Bartons statement that Brother Floyd said Biggswas a fraud and liar and responsible formuch thougrh not all of his troubleAs between Mr Riggs and this newYankee lieutenant who had dared 1odisguise himself and seek lo make heracquaintance she had butone opinionIliggs was driven to drink and desertionbv having- had to serve under suchbrutes She declared she would starverather than eat under the same roofwith Lieut Lambert insisted on staying in her mothers room and beingserved there and was conspicuous byher absence from the table for the first- PVJv--4gans of hearing that lay -so close underthe brown curls on either side of MrLamberts shapely head ears whichshe could gladly have xnncued ortweaked or even banged in her wrathat that moment The hard earned longexpected five dollars had been sent totown and expended before this sisterlyconference took place or beyond doubtMiss Katesie would have hurled it backat the donor when he came so springilyup the walk that crisp December eveningTwo days later brought a long letterfrom Floyd written from the barracksat New Orleans He was not confinedin the guardhouse as he had feared andexpected to be The prisoners awaitkig sentence were there but those yetto be tried were kept in an old storehouse that was not uncomfortable andon the evening of his arrival an officerLieut Waring of the artillery took himinto a separate room treated me likea perfect gentleman wrote poor Floydleaving Ms readers to divine whether1his lavish descriptive were to apply tothe lieutenant or himself listened toFloydes story from beginning to endand told him to keep up his spiritsLieut Lambert had written urginghim to do all he could to help me andhad asked old Gen Ducannon to restoreme to duty without trial in view of theway I had been tricked If he doesand will send me out against those infernal Indians in Texas by heaven Illshow them I can fight as hard for theflag to day as I did against it three andfour years ago All I ask is officers andgentlemen like him oryoung Lambertto serve under and Ill earn my pardonThey had been utterly blue and hopeless on Floyds account since his transfer to Xew Orleans and this letter wasa revelation Esther took it up to hermothers room and strove to make herunderstand its purport Katesie sitting silently and at first scornfullyby Mrs Waltons faculties seemed toodazed to follow and Esther had to reiterate and explain Then the doctorcame and the hale old gentlemanseyes filled as he read That young fellow is a trump said he referring toLambert and he too bent over thegentle invalid and whispered hope andcourage Later when Kate was wantedit was found slie had quitted the roomEsther discovered her after considerable search shivering in a room upstairs She wouldnt talk but thatevening came to teaFor several days Miss Kate contrivedto hold aloof from the general conversation but it was a hard fight againstevery natural impulse Before the endof the week her resolution had failedher utterly and time and again herready tongue had challenged Lambertto debate and now to her chagrin itwas he who declined When formallypresented to My sister Miss Waltonby Mrs Seroggs the young gentlemanhad bowed very low and had striven tobe civil As they sat f acing each otherand only the width of the table aparther downcast eyes and determined silence proved embarrassing even thoughlong curving sweeping i lashes andflushed cheeks appeared perhaps todangerous advantage Aw pshawsaid Cousin Bart that evening as heand Lambert were smoking the pipe ofpeace and the young fellow ventured afear that he had offended the damsel inthe butter business just you pay noattention to that child for a ortwo an see how quick shell comeround She just wants to be huffyShell be hawbly cut up when she findsyou dont notice her Potts had not alittle worldly wisdom when he wasntdrinking and since his installation asex officio head of the house he hadnttouched a drop Lambert was beginning to like him very much butcouldnt induce him to come overcampyourstoI cant stand that captain ofwas his sole explanationFrom frigid silence on Katesies partto occasional monosyllable and thenceto brief and caustic comments on theremarks of her sister and cousin thetransition was easj but now that Lambert addressed no remarks whatever toher yet chatted smilingly with theothers the girls position became exasperating She was willing enough atthe start to keep at wide distance butthat anybody should presume to holdher there was a very different matterin fact simply intolerable Esthernoted in silent amusement how the girlbegan to display unaccustomed solicitude as to the fit of her gown theeffect of such poor little efforts at ornamentation as her simple store of laceor ribbon afforded Such quaint oldfashioned bows and flounces as

for making yards oflinen cloth on the great looms that stoodin the weaving room attached to thakitchens of colonial farmhousesThe flax when harvested was rip- -pledon the field the rippler being

it beneath the watersof the meadow brook or pond Somecolonial farmers laid it on the groundfor the winters snow to render it fitfor the scutcher the machirie thatwhipped out all the particles of barkand stalk adhering to the fiberThe next and last process before itwas ready for the spinning wheel washackling to straighten the flax free it vfrom vtangles and bring it to the requi Vsite fineness This was done by a veryprimitive machine called the hatchel -animmense comb whose long ironteeth were set perpedicularly in a -boardThe operation of hackling requiresmuch skill and this part

tothis country of the deaths of animalsfrom the pestilence Some weeks agoit was reported that the pigeons weredying of the plague Now the rats aresaid for some time to have been plaguestricken and to be dying in thousandsin the native townsIf those who are fighting the plaguehave time to attend to anything butthe work of saving human life we mayexpect more curious information onthis point for there is evidence thatwhen the plague was at its very worstin Florence causing the death of 60100persons the pestilence acquired someland of cumulative energy by which itWent on from man to animal and atlast involved the latter in common destruction with their masters As it advanced not only men but animals fellsick and shortly expired if they hadtouched things belonging to the diseased or dead Boccaccio himself sawtwo hogs on the rags of a person whohad died of plague after staggeringabout for a short time fall down deadas if they had taken poisonIn the Lives of the Poman Pontiffsit is stated that in other places multitudes of cats dogs fowls and other animals fell victims to the contagionThere is little doubt that the concurrence of human and animal death tookplace in other countries than Italythough the chronicler appalled by theloss of human life only alludes to murrain among the cattle as a concomitantof the plague At the commencementof the black death there was in England says Hecker an abundance ofall the necessities of life but the plaguewhich seemed to be the sole diseasewas soon accompanied by a fatal murrainamongthe cattle Wanderingabout without herdsmen they fell bythousands It is not known wThetherthis murrain was due to plague itselfor to some special animal epidemic Butit didv not break out until after theplague was rife and added enormouslyto the loss of life because it was impossible to remove the corn from thefields causing everywhere a great risein the price of food although the harvest had been plentiful London SpectatorFIRST METHODIST SERMONPreached John Wesley OveraCentury and a Half AgroOn the 7th of March 1736 John Wesley preached the first Methodist sermonever preached on this continent Itwas delivered not far from the site ofthe present Christ church Savannah ofwhich he subsequently was the thirdrector and was addressed to a mixedassemblage His congregation hardlyexceeded 400 persons including children and adults reenforced howeverby 100 or more of the neighboring Indians Wesley discussed in a most eloquent manner the principles of Christian charity as argued by Saint Paul inthe 13th chapter of First CorinthiansHe made a powerful appeal and manyof his audience were in tears While hewas not so impetuous in his deliveryas in after years his abilities at thattime bespoke the great preacher andreformerIf he was more scholastic in style thanin after years the fervor and force ofhis appeals were none the less felt byhis hearers Especially was this strikingly true when in the course of hisdiscourse he adverted to the death of hisfather who for 40 years or more hadbeen the incumbent of the Epworth rectorv This venerable man was askednot long before his death Are theconsolations of God small with youKo no no he exclaimed with uplifted hands and then continuedWesley calling all that were near himby their names the dying patriarchsaid Think of Heaven talk ofHeaven all time is lost when we are notthinking of Heaven This was spokenby Wesley in a tremulous voice and hisnew parishioners at Savannah were forthe instant almost swept off their feetby a tidal wave of religious enthusiasmTradition has it that several Indianswho were present became so greatlyexcited not only by Mr Wesleys impassioned oratory though they did notunderstand a word he said but by hisgestures that

Kansas but theKansas authorities and the departmentof agriculture do not sustain this clainuKaffir corn an Egyptian millet is asorghum and as a crop possesses theieadvantages The yield is larger by from20 to 50 per cent than Indian corn itwill grow and yield a crop not a largeone on very poor soil it is injuredmuch less than Indian corn by droughtand even when withered by the hot drywinds of the prairies it will recover under moistureIt forms an excellent food for cattleand pigs All the experiments of whichman y have been made by scientific agriculturists show that it is inferior infatening power to either wheat orcorn Nevertheless as a surer andlarger crop than corn it promises mostimportant results for regions like Kansas and Nebraska where scorchingwinds frequently wither the corn anddestroy the cropAs food for man it is nourishingwholesome and palatable But the latest conclusions of the national department of agriculture are that its use willprobably be somewhat like that of buckwheat it will form an occasionalrather than a staple article of diet Innourishing power it stands at 27 wher abolted cornmeal stands at 37 wheatflour at 45 and oatmeal at 62Heretofore it has been

so cruelthat he cannot bear to remember hisyouth and its trials So we determinedto take other plans with our childrenFirst of all to make their early homeso happy that they will always remember it as

tolet the table stand in the glare of thelight to invite flies If the table mustwait for those who are not punctual attheir meals it should be -carefullyered with a square of cheesecloth andthe room

of sitting downto the table punctually be insisted uponand the food of those who are late is setaside to keep warm without waiting forthem it will save the house from tiepresence of many flies and help to keepthe routine of work in orderThe garbage pail and cleaning clothsare a fruitful cause of the presence offlies The only garbage bucket thatshould be tolerated is a covered oneThe buckets for this purpose are madeof galvanized iron with a cover Thisbucket should be scrubbed out with salsoda and boiling water systematicallyon the inside and outside and thoroughly rinsed -There is no excuse
