Mrs. Lizzie Brown, of this city,
received a message Thursday, appris
ing her of the death of her mother,
Mrs. Mary Hutchison -Morrow, which
occurred in San Francisco, Califor
nia, Tuesday, at the home of her
daughter, Mrs. William Marrs, who
was formerly Miss Mattie Lee Mor
row. Mrs. Morrow was the widow of the
late Alonzo Morrow who moved from
the Hutchison neighborhood to Cali
fornia about eighteen years ago, and
who has been dead about fifteen
years. Mrs. Morrow was an invalid
for several years, being a victim of
slow paralysis, and for several weeks
her death had been expected. She
would have been 72 years old Christ
mas day, and was a consecrated
Christian woman, a devoted mother
and a kind friend and neighbor.

children, Mrs. Brown, of Paris; Mrs.
Marrs, of San Francisco; Mrs. Ed
ward Fry, of Seattle; Mr. Ernest Mor

QUISENBERRY.
On Saturday Mr J T Quisenberry
received the distressing news of the
death of his only son, Mr. Strauder
Quisenberry, at Montrose, Colorado,
at 9 o'clock, Friday night.
Mr. Quisenberry formerly resided
here, and visited his father and sis
ters about five years ago when he
was en route to Colorado from New
York, where he held a responsible po
sition with a large importer of laces
and white goods; but finding that
his health was beginning to be im
paired, he decided to locate in the
West.
He had a good position with a
Government surveying party, and
wrote cheerful letters to the members
of his family, who hoped that the
high altitude and invigorating climate
of Colorado would completely restore
his health. But dnring the terriffic
storm which raged there a few weeks
ago Mr. Quisenberry contracted a
deep cold resulting in hemorrhages
from the lungs, and finally in death.
His family knew of his condition,
but were informed about a week ago
that he showed some improvement,
and had a chance to recover, so that
the news of his death was a great
shock.
Mr. Quisenberry was thirty-eight
years of age, and was a model young
man, quiet and retiring, in manner,

L. Ml N. IS MAKING GREAT v
IMPROVEMENTS IN PARIS
Aa an evideuce that the Louisville
& Nashville Railroad Company will
continue, with this city as the termi
nal of the .Kentucky Central Division,
and with a view of providing addition
al accommodations to meet the rapid
increase in business at this point,
following the opening of the branch
of the road leading into the coal fields
of Eastern Kentucky, extensive im
provements are now under way in the
yards of the company in this city.
Purchasese of adjacent lands toy fur
nish additional track room and to pro
vide sites for a number of buildings
have been made and an immense ex,
penditure in addition to that which
has been made in the past few years
to improve thp local yards, will make
them the largest, .perhaps, in Ken
tucky. Four acres of ground in the south
yards liave been purchased from Mr.
W. K. Griffith, of Harrison county,
and work on the new improvements
is now under way and will be pushed
to an early completion. The com
pany secured one acre from Mr.
"Griffith, located in the triaugle be
tween the main line and ,$lie Lexing
ton branch, and running out to the
Clintonville pike, near the limits of
the city. On this land have been
'moved the offices of the Yardmaster,
together with the large tower house,
and many other" buildings are under
construction. The strip of land ex
tending souh to the Clintonville pike
will be used to provide additional
trackage. Three acres also purchas
ed from Mr. Griffith on the main line
will also be used for addiional track
age. Depressions in the tracks -of the
south yards occasioned by the lower
ing of the grade to conform with
that established in the double track
ing of the main line between this city
and Winchester are being filled with
stone, and within a few months it is
expected the entire yards will be put
into use.
The work of building trackage in
the rear of the round house is near
ing completion, and the construction
of a large woodworkshop will be com
menced at once. With the comple
tion of the shop the L. & N . will
bring additional (men to Paris in
Jarge numbers, who will be employed
in doing the heavy repair work on
cured an option on the remainder of
freight caijs, which has heretofore
been done in Covington.
Grading the yards is progressing
rapidly and is about half completed.
Contracting firms who have the work
in charge are reducing the grade at
different points from one to five feet.
Unconfirmed reports are to the effect
that the railroad company has se
the Grffith land in the triangle be
tween the main line and the Lexing
ton branch, adjacent to the south
yards, and that it will soon be taken
over. It is not known to what use
this ground will be put to unless it
is to provide sites for additional
shops and trackage room.
Plans for a large and commodious
brick passenger station in Paris
which have been submitted to the
officials in Louisville, it is said have
been approved and returned, and it
is expected the work will begin in the
early spring. The new station, ac
cording to reports, will be located on
the site of the present frame struc
ture. A large portion of the double track

LOCAL POSTOFFICE FLOODED
WITH CHRISTMAS MAIL.
The local postoffice is literally
flooded with Christmas mail and the
entire office force with additional
help, are being pushed to the utmost
to handle the deluge. The business
of the Paris office this Christmas is
heavier by far than ever before, ow
:ng to the parcel post ruling, by
which twenty pounds can be sent by
mail.
Each outgoing train gets a large
number vof tie-pouches filled almost to
overflowing with Christmas packages.
Yesterday more than a hundred of the
packages were dispatched from this
point, while an equal number were
sent out Saturday.
Yesterday a wagon was put jnto
service to deliver pn reels to all points
in the city and with each day until
Christmas it is expected to he kept
going full hours in order to make
oromnt deliveries. A deluge of mail,
it is the opinio a of the office officials,
will almost swamp the clerks to-day
and to-morrow, but every effort is be
ing made to properly meet any emer
gency. Postmaster N. A. Moore has arrang
ed to keep the general delivery win
dow at the office open Wednesday
night until 8 o"clock, that patrons
may receive mail coming in on the
trains which arrive too late for the
regular delivery.

one will have the nerve to establish
the fact that "what is sauce for

become so completely buffaloed with
apprehension that their fiancees are
