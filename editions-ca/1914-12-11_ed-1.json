A man is always looking for trouble.
After experimenting with a motor
boat and an automobile he will go and
cop out a wife.
A Pittsburg woman holds that
four years is long enough for any wo
man to live with any man. Well, if
we could get a certificate entitling us
to cop out a new wife every time we
voted for a President, there wouldn't
be any trouble getting the men out to
the polls on election day. l
