President Wilson has expressed his
approval of the Fifth National Tuber
culosis Day in the week of Nov. 29.
This movement is not for the purpose
of raising funds, but simply to bring
to the attention of all the people of
the country the essential facts con
cerning the treatment and prevention
of tuberculosis.
Gov. James B. McCreary, President
of the Kentucky Tuberculosis Commis
sion, ana air of the Commissioners,
hope that the day may be widely ob
served in the churches and schools of
the state, since the observance of the
day is commended by leading minis-
sters, and educators and public men
everywhere. Kentucky, with the high
estdeath rate from tuberculosis in the
country, with 4682 deaths last year
and with probably 4,000 active cases
in the state, certaining needs some
education about this essentially cura
cle and preventable disease.
Clergymen and others may secure
literature for the preparation of ad
dresses or for general distribution
from local anti-tuberculosis societies,
or from the Kentucky Tuberculosis
Commission, Frankfort.

t HOW TO AVOID "SKIDDING."
On account of the large number
of automobiles turning turtle now
adays, killing and maiming many of
the occupants, there -has been much
thought on the matter by which such
accidents will be less frequent. It
has been said apparently with good
logic, that the fuming over of automo
biles is not caused by bad roads or
fast driving; it is because the driver
loses his head and consequently con
trol of the machine. The driver of an
automobile when in danger of turning
turtle feels the wheels skidding into
the ditch and intuitively turns the
front wheels to the center of the
road. This has a tendency to turn the
machine at right angles to the direc
tion of the momentum and turning
over is inevitable, if the machine is
running at a brisk speed. Instead of
doing this thing, tie old and experi
enced driver will turn the front wheels
to the bottom of the ditch when the
rear wheels are felt skidding; he re
mains that way until he has the ma
chine under control. The principle of
the rule is that as long as the wheels
are kept in line of momentum the car
can't turn over but as- soon as the ma-1
chine is headed across the line of 1
motion then it must rail, if the rate of J i"S around every day sound asleep,
speed attained is sufficiently great. "

' "Cyclone Jake" Scheneberg, who made
a great reputation while on the mound
as a member of the pitching staS of

Thompson says Scheneberg was dolled
up in the latest stole clothes and had
all the appearance of having a suc-
' cessful season. He made inquiries
' about allthe Paris fans, male and fe
male, and asked to be pleasantly re-
