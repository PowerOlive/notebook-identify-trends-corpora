T. Hinton yesterday afternoon after discussing at length thevisit of Mr. H. W. Beck, Secretary ofthe Light and Development Co., ofSt. Louis, which owns and operatesthe local plant, and which purchasedthe franchise recently granted theCentral Kentucky Natural Gas Co.For the past several weeks the attitude of the Paris Gas & Electric Co.in its refusal to specify which contract it will elect to operate under,,has greatly purturbed the consumersin this city, with the result a numberof citizens have reiused to sign thecontracts furnished by the company,and natural gas has been cut offfrom a large number of residences.The local officials of the company,it has been contended, were not awareof the course the Light & Development uompany intended to pursue, iand the matter was taken up withthe-head office in St. Louis, resultingin a visit by the Secretary of thecompany to ascertain the cause ofhe seeming dissention among theconsumers of this city and to conferwith the city officials.A meeting of the Council which hadbeen called for yesterday morning waspostponed at the solicitation of Mr.Beck, who after a conference withMayor Hinton, decided to return toSt. Louis tov secure a contract, whichit was said would be acceptable tothe city. The city officials are determined tin their efforts to force thecompany to meet the demands andwill accept nothing that will not befavorable to the consumers. Theagreement between the lightingcompany and the city will be bindingin every respect and the only condition upon which the company willbe allowed the right' to retain the oldfranchise will be in that case that itis needed for the distribution of artificial gas should he supply of naturalgas be exhausted. In regard to thesituation Mayor Hinton yesterday isued the following:MAYOR HINTON'S STATEMENT:It having been reported that theParis Gas and Electric Company hadsignified their intention to use the oldfranchise for the distribution of natural gas after they had purchased thenew franchise recently granted theCentral" Kentucky Natural Gas Company, notice was served on the ParisGas and Electric Company that thecity authorities would not submit tothe abandonment of the the new franchise which contained restrictions asto price and-service that were not inthe old franchise. A meeting of theCouncil had been called for Thursdaymorning to take official action in thisconnection. Wednesday morning Mr.Beck, the Secretary of the St. LouisCompany which controls the ParisGas and Electric Company, came tothis city to confer with us in regardto the situation. He was told thatthe city would enter tegal proceedingsto annul both franchises and Trosecute the case through the courts oflast resort and use every means available to force them to give to the citizens every right to which they areentitled under -the new franchise. Mr.Beck stated that it had been theirintention to use the old franchise forthe reason that it might be neededfor the distribution of artificial gasin the event that the natural gasshould ever become exhausted.L It was agreed 'with Mr. Beck thathis company might hold all its rightsfor the use of artificial gas undersuch condition, but that an agreementmust be made fn writing that wouldpositively insure to the city everyright given in the new franchise fornatural gas. After talking over thelong distance phone with his attorneyjat St. Louis, Mr. Beck assured us thathis company would act in good faithwith the city and that he would return to St. Louis and have their attorney prepare a contract which wouldmeet the demands we are making ifit were possible to do so and protect!their own interest. Mr. Beck wasgiven to understand that in no waywould we withdrawvour demandthat whatever contract he should submit must positively guarantee everyrestriction and privilege given by thenew franchise, and that unless theydid so guarantee we would proceedto take such steps as are necessary jto secure to the citizens their fullrights, cen if it should bs necessaryto recommend to the people thebuilding of tleir own light and .gasplant. With Mr. Beck's assurancethat they would meet the conditions,the meeting of the Council that hadI been called was postponed until Mr.Beck may have time to submit hisproposition, which he has promisedto do at oe. fJ.x T HINTON,v -: -'Nov15th is the time ,and while you arelook, ing forward to this date remember that thisstore is headquarters for all kinds of huntingclothes Dux Bak Water Proof Coats andPants, the kind that brars can't tear up andthat water won't go througfir-SiieH.Vest andDux Bak Hunting Caps and Hats and the"Witch Elk.

Lexington, Ky.23-sept-tf3e Shown in Mineature at Conservation Congress.Washington, Nov. 6. Realistic fainstorms and foresters riding the rail,fighting fires and herding thousandsof sheep and catle, will be seen inminiature at the Fifth National Conservation Congress, in this city, November 18, 19 and 20. By an arrangement just closed with the United"States Forest Service, the workingand management of Uncle Sam's forests will be shown in Washington forthe first time since these forests werecreated. Different parts of the exhibit, havfi fitt.rantftd fionsnicions attentionf at expositions throughout the country,but never have so many phases or torestry, water power and Conservationbeen shown at any one time as willbe seen during the Conservation meeting next month. The exhibit will beseen on the tenth floor of the NewWillard Hotel, where the sessions ofthe Congress will be held. It will beopen free of charge to all who register as delegates or visitors to the Congress. Forest rangers, fresh from the trail,and other men in charge of the practical management of the Nation's forests will be on hand to explain it. Inaddition to the forests themselves, theexhibit will include an interesting display of .many queer instruments usedby woodmen in their work. Into themany windows which light the roomswill be set beautiful colored glasstransparencies, showing scenes fromthe national forests. These have beenmade from actual photographs. Theforest ranger will be shown riding thetrail. Pictures will show how therangers build the trails and how theyfight forest fires. The protection ofwild game of the forests will be astriking exhibit, as well as the photogarphs of tens of thousands of sheepand cattle that graze on these vastGovernment domains.One of the most interesting exhibits will be a minature look-out tower,the rangers often discover fires atsuch a great distance that it takesdays to ride to them. There will bean equipment station showing thejtools with which the rangers fight thefires. Many fire fighters lost theirlives in the forest fires of 1910. Another model will show a national forest as it appears before and a sit appears after a timber sale and will illustrate how Uncle Sam's foresters cutand utalize the government -timber tohe fullest extent without' letting anyof it go to waste.Water power development in national forests will be shown by maps,charts and colored transparencies.This feature will include the amountof water power available in the national forests in the West and in thenew national "forest, in the SouthernAppalachian region.One of the most interesting exhibits' will be that of the Western Forestry Conservation Association, .composed of five of the Pacific CoastStates, showing how the Associationeduates the people and the schoolchildren to the importance of the protection and use of the forests.Another model will present a realistic rainfall. One half of the model,filled with earth, is covered with miniature trees and moss. On the otherhalf the earth is left bare. The artificial rain storm brings out plainly theway in which the bare ground is washed away, while ground covered withtrees hold its place. The famousI White House map of the country'snatural resources will also be seen.This was the first map ever made bythe government and has atracted attention at many expositions. It wasconstructed for the now historic WhiteHouse Conference of Governors, in1908, at which the Conservation movement started. It will now be shown inWashington for the first timethe White House Conference.lis the Culture and Use of Flue-CuredTobacco.Washington, Nov.- 6. The normalannual production of flue-cured tobacco on a farm-weight basis is estimated to be. about 215,000,000 pounds,according to Bulletin No. 16 of the Department of Agriculture. This typeof tobacco is the only Americangrown variety that.has shown a tendency to expand our exports. About40 per cent, or around 90,000,0000pounds is exported., and the remainderis used in domestic consumption."All things considered, this flue-curedtobacco is unsurpassed in universal popularity," states the report,"and it is adopted to a variety ofuses, including granulated and cutsmoking tobacco, both paper and alltobacco cigarettes, and plug filler andwrapper; in fact, it is adapted to allthe regular forms in which tobacco isused except standard cigars and snuff.In color and general appearance it isvery attractive, while its low nicotinecontent, mildness, aromtic sweetness,fragrance and good keeping qualitiesrender it satisfactory to the user."' The use of flues in curing tobaccobecame popular after the close of theCivil War and be the middle eightiesthe demand had increased so thatabout 20 countries in Virginia andNorth Carolina had been planted tothis variety. There are a number ofvarieties of flue-cured tobacco, prominently, among which are the Marne,Yellow Orono.co, White-stem Oronoco,Big Oronoco, Adock, Adkin, WillowLeaf, Gooch, Tilley and Hester. TheWarne is the standard wrapper typeand perhaps the most s popular. TheAdcock is a great favorite in the noted wrapper-producing section of Granville county, North Carolina, while theAdkin is popular as an early mateuring variety.Apart from the natural character ofthe soil itself, there is no more important-matter for the tobacco growerto consider than the, .management ofhis fields. Indeed the' character of thetobacco produced will depend as muchon how the fields have been handledin rotation between the successive tobacco crops as upon the fertilizerAised or the cultivation given directly tothe tobacco crop itself. ToMccoland should be so handled as to keepit in good life. A liberal supply ofvegetable matter in an advancedstage of decay is highly desirable, butit should be of the kind not excessively rich in ammonia.It is well known that the organicmatter of freshly cleared or broomseded fields is of a kind well suitedto tobacco. It consists principally ofdead leaves, twigs, roots, pine tags,broom-sedge and roots. Such vegetable matter, while poor in ammonia,by its ample volume makes .the soilvery mellow and friable and of goodwater-holding capacity. There isprobably no better humus crop forrotation than herd's grass or red top.Specking, or"diseasing," as it isgenerally called, is the most commondisease injury to which tobacco inthe flue-cured district is subject. Itis believed to be a fungus disease,,disseminating by spores. The onlypractical method of reducing the injury to the crop caused by the diseaseis by using potash more liberally inthe fertilizer, which seems to increasethe resistenuce of the plant to the disease.A Human Match Factorycarry the proper elements to me awercui. u.isai, ""o nerve trouble-heart trouble.

Many foreign countries havegreat individual exhibitions, but bycommon consent of all the world'si highest authorities, the "Internation-' al" is an easy leader. At this showmay be seen the pick of the foremostioreign breeds massed together wellnigh beneath a single roofvGathered in their thousands at thegreatest railway center in the world,the animals at the "International"offer a liberal education in themselvesto all who care to study them. Hereall of our master breeders, and manyfrom foreign climes, take post-graduatecourses. Money paid out in attending the show is regarded by themas the rriost profitable, sound and 'remunerative they can make.To keep up with the trend of livestock breeding, the farmer and stockman must needs attend the "International." He must study the work ofthe judges, and if he cares to, andgoes the right way about it, he maylearn from the lips of these judgestheir reasons which governed theirawards.It is a show by the people for thepeople, of the people. Its' guidingprinciple is the greatest good to thegreatest number. It offers a matchless opportunity to study, to learn, tomeet and know the master minds inlive stock sircles.

Some proposed undergroundconnocetions have been abandonedowing to the frail condition of thehistoric structure. According to theengineer referre'd to the cause of thebuilding's distress seems tobe due totwo causes settlement of the foundations and failure of the material usedin the foundations. It has been discovered that some of the stones madeuse of by Sir Christopher Wren, andwhich are now supporting a weight ofthirteen tons to the square foot, weretaken from the original building andwere, therefore, centuries old beforebeing placed in the present structure.The stones bear evidence of Normanworkmanship.A French scientist who has combined the motion picture camera withthe X-ray apparatus into one instrument by which the processes of theinternal organs may be studied, hasgiven it the name of the bioroentgenograph.

As a rule new machinery is in fair adjustment andneeds little attention in this respect.but it is often sticky and otherwiseunsatisfactory in its action on accountof the manner in which it was painted at the factory. By cleaning outthe oil holes and applying a few dropsof kerosene, this difficulty may usually be overcome. It is wise to tunnew machinery "light," that is, withits moving parts in action but without a load of any sort, until it is welllimbered up. This will put the machine in running order without unduestrain and gives an opportuinity foradjustment if it should be found necessary. Machines which have been in usesome time should be put in proper ad-lustment when they receive their periodical over-haulings, and should begiven careful attention in this respectduring the entire time that they arein operation. Cleanliness is as impor-tan't with farm machinery as with anyother class of machinery. Dirt andpoor service seem to go hand in hand,and dirty farm machinery cannot beexpected to give its full efficiency because dirt upon metal absorbs moisture which attacks the metal and intime seriously injures it. Also, dirtin the bearings even in small quantityquickly destroys them by grinding andcutting, and in large quantities mayeven choke the action of the movingparts. Again, dirt does not add to theappearance of farm machinery in anyway, and may at times even get intothe eyes of the operator. Thereforethe second step in the care of farmmachinery is to keep it as clean asconditions will permit. An old broomwill be found ueseful for cleaning, alsoa handful of waste or soft rags and asquirt oil can filled with kerosene. Ifpossible, the machine should be thoroughly cleaned when the season'swork is completed, and during theprocess carefully examine for worn orborken parts, which should be markedin some conspicious way and noted ina list of repairs which are to be pur-I chased later for the farm equipment.j It seems hardly necessary to say that je macnmes snould be stored when1 not in use, in a dry place, which meansI dry underneath as well as overhead.Some system should be used in storage so that those machines which arelfrequently used should be easily gotten at. All bright metal parts shouldbe coated with either hard oil, axelgrease or a compound composed ofequal parts of lard and white laed.That part of the farm equipmentwhich is made wholly or partially ofwood will require especial attentionin the way of painting, since woodabsorbs moisture readily and rots rapidly. It is a well-known fact among .country blacksmiths that those farm-1ers wno keep their wagons well painted have occasion to have them repaired less frequently than those who neglect to give them attention. Especially is it desirable to give the wagonfelloes a thorough soaking in oil.Wheels so treated are not .apt to re-,quire the customary cutting in dry tseasons because there will be little expansion and contraction of the wood iwith the varying moisture conditions jof different seasons.Sometimes considerable difficulty is ;experienced in securing the neces-sary repairs for farm machinery and 'valuable equipment is "discarded be-cause the owner is unable to locatetut; manuiacLurer or tne particularpiece he needs. Local dealers can always render great assistance at suchtimes of difficulty. If they are notable or willing to give this assistance.then an appeal should be made to theState Agricultural College, which isusually in a position to supply information in regard to such matters andis always glad to give advice and as-'sistance in connection with any problems in farm equipment.
