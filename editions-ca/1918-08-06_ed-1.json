nature, which manifested itself ?on
many occasions-in acts of unselfish
devotion and kindness, and made
the world better for haying been7 a
wnolesome part of it. Her devotion
to her younger brothers and sisters
was always held up to the .boys and

welfare. She was faithful in every
walk of life ander reward is sure.
Miss McCarthy is survived by two

It is now believed that the vexa

of water supply will soon be, settled,
if plans now under way by7the inter

For several months the- old mill
dam across Stoner Creek, at the point
of the Paris Milling Company, which
.serves to back up the water which is
pumped from the pumping station for
the city of Paris, has been falling into
;a state of bad repair, and, in. .fact,
almost to the point of giving w.ay.
Owing to a dispute as to ownership
of the dam, and responsibility for re
pairing it, it has been impossible to
get the interested parties together.
They are the City of. Paris, the -Xou-
isville & Nashville Railroad Coni
pany, the Paris Water Company and
the-Paris Milling Company. No agree
ment could be reached by any of itheir
representatives.
Quite recently plans have been
evolved by the City of Paris, through
Councilman John Merringer, of "the
special committee appointed bjj; the
City Council,, and Mayor E.'B. Janu

dam at a point close to the L. So N.
