Nothing is more aggravating or disgusting than to have the nice vegetablesor beautiful flowers scratched up, andthe doorsteps, the porch, the barnfloor, and the farm machines fduledwith poultry droppings. Separate thepoultry also from the other live stockof the farm.If the fowls are t5 be kept near thefarm buildings, provide ample rangeenclosed by modern poultry wirefencing. The latter requires ordinarily but a few posts, is easily putup and has a very neat appearancewhen in position.Another way of separating the fowlsfrom the center of farm operations isto place the hen houses at a considerable distance from the farmstead, ina pasture where the fowls will haveabsolute range. The latter plan mayentail some extra travel by the poultryrnan and there is the risk in somelocalities of depredations by foxes,hawks or other wild animals or bythieves. The young, strong farmerboy may find advantage in the secondor so-called "colony plan," while thehousewife will probably prefer thefenced enclosure near the farm house.Thirdly the farmer is too carelessin the way he disposes of his poultryproducts. He is usually content totrade his eggs at the nearest grocerystore when by a little extra effort hecould gain a select private tradewhich w ould pay far better. His purebred stock of one breed of fowls intheir well kept house and capaciousgrassy yards will be a great advertisement for his egg products and uniform clean appearange of the eggs intheir attractive package will provean additional help in making sales.Then, too, in disposing of his fowlsthe farmer often sells the birds alivewhen by carefully dressing them onthe farm and selling to his customerson orders he could secure far betterprices.vKate B.

"Under the present law, theDemocratic County Committee is authorized, at one of its meetings, during the month of August, to select-five names to be sent to the StateElection Commission at Frankfort, andfrom the list of five names so selected the State Election Commission selects a Commissioner of Election forthe county, and that Commissioner hasthe selection of the officers of election who pesides at the seveeral pollsthroughout the city and county. Lastsummer a list of five names was certified to the State Election Commissionat Frankfort, and it turns out that allfive of those names so selected werefor Denis Dundon and James O'BrienIt requires eleven of the twenty members of the county committee to makea quorum; fourteen of the twentymembers have signed a written statement that they were not present anddid not participatee in such meeting orknow of the selection of these fivenames, so there could not have been alegal meeting, because it would takeeleven of the twenty to constitute aquorum. Besides the fourteen whohave signed the written statement thatthey did not participate in this selection of the five names, seveeral othersof the committee have beee interviewed, and say that no suchmeeting was held. But, without counting' those members of thecommittee who hae not signed awritten statement, the fact that fourteen members out of the twenty whohave signed this written statementwere not present, makes it impossiblethat a legal meeting could have beenheld, and yet the list went to Frankfort of five men, each one of whomwas for Dundon and O'Brien. "We 4not see howit could be an accidentthat these five names were all forDundon and O'Brien. To our mind, itwould be impossible for such an accident to occur.We refuse o believe that the Chairman of the Democratic County Committe meant to do this injustice toMr McMillan in selecting five names-for Dundon and O'Brien exclusively.We prefer o believe that he was mislead by wiley politicians in selectingpartisans of Dundon and O'Brien exclusively. Granting that the Chairman of theDemocratic County Committee actedia good faith, he was certainly imposed-upoa by some shrewd politician or- politicias in . the naming of five r3d&, Who turn out to be for Dundona& O'Brien only. That this list oftetttetttgacftgfisNow For The Semi-Annual Clean-Up SaleSilksDress GoodsWash GoodsWhite Goods 2Linens ' "Table LinensNapkins 8Come and Give Us an Opportunity to SavewStreetfive must redound to the. joint benefitof Judge Dundon and Mr. O'Brien maywell be demonstrated by the fact thatit apeared in the papers of Paris afew days ago that these two gentlemen went to Frankfort to prevent anychange being made in this selectionof names. They wTant this list toand the reason they want this list tostand is because all on th list ve:3for Dundon and O'Brien. The importance of this to Mr. Dundon and Mr.O'Brien will be seen when the readerstops to think of the favoritism thatmay be shown these candidates in theselection of the officers of election ateach poll in the city and county. If amajority of these officers at any pollare for Dundon and O'Brien, theycan easily yield to their own prejudices, and, in fact, could hardly avoiddoing so, in passing upon the questionof whether any person whose vote ischallenged shall be allowed to vote.A majority of the officers at the pollspossess great power, and if partisansof Dundon an dO'Brien fill the booth asofficers, what can the voters who desire fair play expect? Judge Dundonand Mr. O'Brien may claim that theywere entirely ignorant of the selectionof these names, all men io-- Dundonand O'Brien only. But what shall wesay of their manifest willingness tohave such an unfair deal stand, as indicated by Judge Dundon and Mr.O'Brien taking each other arm in armand hieing to Frankfort to make itstand, before it was even attackedIs the will of the Democracy ofBourbon county to be circumventedafter this manner? Every voter inBourbon county should be aroused bythis situation. Watch the list of appointments of election officers whenselected, and see if the partisans ofDundon and O'Brien do not constitutea majority of the officers of the election in at least a majority of the percincts of Paris and Bourbon county,and particularly in such precinctswhere it is important to have a majority of the judges for Dundon andO'Brien, because of a large vote insuch precincts that may be, as beingmore or less transcient, questioned byone side or the other, leaving it to amajority of the judges to say whetherthey shall vote or not.The News is for a square deal. Thewiles of adriot politicians ought notto frustrate the sturdy yeomanry XSfBourbon Democracy.But it will be said that there aretwo election commissioners of Bourboncounty. True. But one of these is aRepublican commissioner whose bitterhostility 0 Hinton is notorious andwho is, of course, in this race, againstHinton and against C. A. McMillan.'The third commissioner, the Sheriff,will be powerless as against theseother -two.This Democratic commissioner (selected from the five names sent toFrankfort for Dundon and O'Brien) apartisan of Dundon and O'Brien, andthis Republican commissioner, hostileto Hinton andagainst McMillan, can appoint a majority of the partisans ofDundon and O'Brien for election officers in every important voting boothin Paris and out of Paris. 'Will they do it? Watch and see forI yourself.Began Monday, JulyCloses Saturday,, JulyBed SpreadsHosieryLacesEmbroideriesHandkerchiefsFancy Linen PiecesLace Curtains'9rnThe Store That GivesLET'S HAVE NO DODGINGOF RESPONSIBILITY.Judge Dundon is quoted as saying,when electioneering, that he is not responsible for the deplorable condi-. tion 01 the turnpikes.But the Court of Appeals of Ken-1 tucky holds that he is responsible.There were bad roads over in Boylecounty, which lead to an indictmentby the grand jury at Danville and thecase was carried to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky. The Court of Appeals held that the County Judge maybe indicted for the bad turnpikes in.the county. If our statement is denied or challenged we will, at our ownexpense, get a copy of the opinion ofthe Court of Appeals and publish it.Every lawyer of any experience orpractice knows it, and we ate prepared to prove what we say, with theopinion itself, if our statemet is ques-tioned.j It was bad enough to neglect theturnpikes, certainly so to neglect; them to such an extent that the GrandJury of Bourbon county felt calledupon to administer a severe rebuke,but to attempt to shirk this responsibility is as bad or worse, especiallywhen done to get votes. The nennloot Bourbon county do not want asCounty Judge any man who disclaimsresponsibility for the condition of theturnpikes. If he does not feel his responsibility he certainly should be retired from office.RECKLESS ASSERTIONS.Some Dundon Admirer has come outin the Paris f Democrat saying manythings why Judge Dundon should bekept in office, but we have no sparespace in this issue except for one feature. The writer says Dundon is thegreatest lawyer the County Judgshipof Bourbon has ever known, or wordsto that effect.So many County Judges of Bourbonfilled this office before this Dundon Admirer was born that we fail to seehow this Admirer is competent witness, in fact it is doubtful whoHiorthis Admirer ever knew any of the recent County Judges well enough toform or express an opinion on thissubject. Evidently he did not. Thenwhy such a high sounding and sillystatement? If Judge Dundon is sucha great lawyer as this Admirer affectsto believe, does it not occur as passing strange to this Admirer thatJudge Dundon does not gladly surrender to a younger lawyer this officeand himself seek wider and more remunerative fields for his legal talent,instead of holding on to this officewith a death like grip.By the way, what is the need of allthis legal talent, alleged to be greaterthan in the case of any of his predecessors. It is not the duty of theCounty Judge to look after the legalaffairs of Bourbon countv. This dp.volves upon the County Attorney.one ot the best County Judges Bourbon county ever had was not a lawyerat all, but a farmer.JUDGE DUNDON'S CARD.Judge Dundon has published a cardon the subject of the length of timeethe Most Charsse23he has been County Judge eightyears, two terms.He fails to mention that he enjoyedthe emoluments of the office of CountyAttorney of Bourbon eight years, ortwo terms, and that he had the benefitof the Garth Fund for four or fiveyears. Thus the public have helpedhim and kept him in office. for morethan twenty years a business lifetime.Has he not had his share of office?Is it not time he was giving youngerDemocrats a chance?FORMER COUNTY JUDGEATTACKS UNKNOW WRITER.To the Editor of The Bourbon News:As your paper is the first county paper issued after the appearance ofte literary production in the ParisDemocrat of Saturday, July 5,. Subject: "Why Judge Dundon will be ReElected," and signed, "Some DemocratWho Will Vote For Judge Dundon,"j wiiicxi is suun a wanton renection, notoniy upon tne juaiciai ana Dusmessability, but the honesty of all formerCounty Judges, that we ask space inyour paper to notice these villianous1 innuendoes, some one ought to answer,uiiu as mere are oniy two iormerCounty Judges living, and one of thetwo is out of the United States, inPeru, South America, serving out histerm as U. S. Minister, so am theonly one of these undesirable citizensnow in the county. To keep silentwould not only be unjust to the living,but worse than criminal to the memory of the dead. Why such nefariousreflections should be made is certainlynot because of any action of mine inthe present campaign, for I have neverexpressed how I was going to vote tomy most intimate friends, nor to eitherMr. Dundon's or Mr. McMillan's mostactive supporters, nor have I ever expressed myself upon the qualificationsof either. I have said frequently thatthey were candidates for the office Ihad just retired from, when the pressent County Judge came into office,and the very intimate associationswith both of them while in office, Ithought it just to both candidates toexpress no preference. Perhaps it isbecause the opponent to their Idol isrelated by marriage to the kinsmanof one of the former County Judgesthat these malicious defamers of deadmen's characters (by now questioningtheir honesy) have done this gnolishdeed.There are five "Becauses" in this literary production and we will noticethem as they come. No. One. "Because he is a better lawyer than anyCounty Judge Bourbon County everhad." Now Mr. Reader, which is thebetter way to decide on the legalacumen of these Judges. Shall it beby the "Because" of some unknownnewspaper correspondent, or by thecour records? Take the legal decisions, of the present County Judge andof each of the former County Judges,both in the Quarterly Court andCounty Court, that have been appealedto the higher courts and see howmany reversals of the legal decisionsof each Judge and compare them.No. Two. Because no other JudgeSALE!719bargain event, a realare unusually large.mW999W969i9Shirt Waists2 Ribbonse Corsets2 Muslin Underwearg UmbrellasParasolsTowels, &c9 &c.e6e9ee$efte3eeecse9sea9s$ssiYou IVIoneyBackhas been as good a business man asJud DundonJ' Now just what thegreat unknown means by this "Because" is not clear. If he means thathis Idol has gotten more of BourbonCounty's money since he has-been inoffice, than any former County Judge,then there is no issue in the case. Ifhe means his Idol has managed theturnpike repair question (the only bigbusiness proposition that has come under his administration) in such a fine; business way, the report of a Bourbon' County Grand Jury (just published)docs not agree with him, so I refer thereader to that report.Five of the largest business propositions that have come before the Bourbon County Courts that we recall:J Building of the court house in theI seventeies, costing the county $125,1000; Taking over the turnpikes from, the stockholders to the county, and devising ways and means to pay for theminvolving an amount upwards of $60,000. The organizing and systeminng, the turnpike repair system, whichtakes half of the county levy each. year. Tne law ,suits witn tne insurance companies over the insurance onthe court house, amounting to morethan $50,000. The building of the(present court house, and equipping it,'involving an amount of $165,000, allthe above business propositions wereduring the administrations of the forjmer County Judges and no one ever1 heard of the charge of mismanagementand graft, until this literary production of last Saturday.No. Three. "Because Judge TJundonis nidependent he acts independentlyand thinks independently, no matterwhose selfish interest it hurts." Nowjust what the great unknown meansby "independent" and "no matterwhose selfish interest it hurts." I amat a loss to know. If he means thathis Idol has spent three or four hundred thousand dollars of the tax payers money on about fifty miles ofturnpike in the last four or eight yearsmaking a D. D. Boulevard for his particular friends and letting the other300 miles of turnpike in the county gowithout repairs or nearly so, and he isindependent to the appeals of the sel-fish interest of the taxpayers who liveon the 300 mies of unrepaired turnpike, then the great unknown is rightto call that idependent. If that is independence (?) certainly Judge Samuels and Judge Hawes had some independence in their make up. Neitherwas ever known to leave their officeto solicit a vote when a candidate, andJudge Hawes was never known toname his candidacy to any one, eitherin . his office or on hte street, noranywhere, his position being a. Judgeshould never electioneer.No. Four. "Because he is a man offirm convictions and a man who hasnever been known to change' or modify his convictions for a selfish gainor personal preferment." Now readbetween the lines he is the onlyhonest Judge Bourbon county everhad. Now if anyone will read the records of the Fiscal Courts he "will findthe same Fiscal Court voted to onecounty official $1,000 extra for servicesthey thought he had earned, and $700to another county official for the samereason. The firsb named official re-1money-savingmPARIS, KY.fused the $1,000, not because he had.not earned it, but because as he stated, it was illegal and against the constitution of the State. The secondnamed official accepted his $700 andvput it to his bank acount. .The CourtAppeals afterwards gendered a decision that this extra allowance was illegal. All the former County Judgeshad, and have not only political convictions, but RELIGIOUS convictionsalso. No. Five. Because he is a MAN.'"Now just what tho great unkown.means by this "Becausfe" I am unabfeto comprehend. There must be somegreat significance in the last word aslt is extra large capitals, not only thefirst letter, but the entire word. Perhaps he means that class of theGenus Homo, that write articles tonewspapers trying to injure the character, of the dead by innuendoes andthen forget to sign his name to them.Now, Mr. "Some Democrat WhoVote For Judge Dundon," when youanswer thl.3 (and I hope you will) letme ack of you not to be guilty (as in.your last) of the Hyena, ghouldish actt digging up tha good ame of the dead,of some of the best men that everlived in the county, because the opponent of your Idol married the nieceof one of these former County Judgesthat have passed to the great beyond.Judge Matt Turney's life, as are thelives of Judge Samuels, Judge HawesJudge Mann and Judge Purnell, anopen book to all, and their names:will always be sacred to the goodand fair-minded people of this county,And now as to the two living formerj County Judges, one of whom is nothere to answer for himself; and itwrould be like stabbing in the back.toattack his character. So I ask and invite you to take all your hatred andspleen against the former CountyJudges out of me, and I say turn thelights on, examine every official actof mine. Yes, every private act, everydealing I have had with my fellow- .men view me from every standpointand make it public, and if you wiltmake the lights bright enough wewill find out the unwritten historyof the insurance suits, who shirkedresponsibility, also about the plot thatwas concocted to swindle BourbonCounty out of $75,000 by circulatingthe report (so that every man, worman and child in the county knew otit) that the court house building thanwas nearing completion was unsafeand would fall down if the plans werenot changed, and by the change thecontractor would charge the county-$75,000 more than the contract calledfor. This same ruse was carried,through by the same contractor on acourt house building in Indiana. This-,contractor has a leaky mouth, and soit leaked out that there was to be adivide the graft . And make therlights still brighter that we may seeif the A. T. C. will put $5,000 in thiscounty before the August primary tothe benefit of certain candidates. ButI am making this too long and muststop. Will look for the great Unknown's reply in one of the issues ofone of our county papers that are yetto come out this "w-eek.

A plea for conservatism in politics, a "stop, look, listen" policy to guard against hastyadoption of ill-considered proposals,was the keynote of an address on "TheTendency of Our Times" delivered atthe University of Virginia by Representative Oscar W. Underwood of Alabama, t Democratic leader in thehouse of representatives.It was a notable occasion at Charlottesville, with many of those whohave gone forth from the universityin the past reassembled to pay tributeto their alma mater.Mr. Underwood is president of thealumni, and his son was among thegraduates. He preached the doctrineof the political uplift."Only a few years ago," he said, "apolitical party that contended thatOscar W. Underwood.taxes on consumption should be abolished and that part of the governmentburdens should be borne by thewealth ofNthe country was haled before the bar of public opinion as beingguilty of extreme radicalism."Yet even those who condemned theproposal have enacted a law taxingcorporate wealth and have ceased toprotest against an equitable income itax that shall fairly distribute a partof the tax burdens of the government on incomes derived from allclasses of property."The tendency of our times undoubtedly is toward greater freedomof thought, uplift to humanity, abolishment of governmental privilege,equalization of the taxation burdensand an open, honest administration ofthe laws.What may be regarded as radical today may be the inner citadel of conservatism tomorrow.BOY'S FLAG SAVES RICH MAMWeakness cf Struggling Victim ofBull Meant Certain Death, butfor Red Emblem.Emlenton, Pa.

Assistant Veterinarian,University Farm, St. Paul. Minn.It is not at all uncommon for cattleto show a very sudden lameness,which on careful examination provesto be an abscess-like 'formation between the hoofs. The starting pointis usually a small scratch or abrasion of the skin, which offers a suitable avenue of entrance for the germcausing the trouble. The germs livein the soil, manure and other filth! about the yards and feed lots. During dry weather they cause very littledamage. When the yards are muddy,or the stables unclean, the growth ofgerms is favored. At this time alsothe continued action of the wet, foulmaterial makes the skin between theclaws tender and easy to injure.An examination of the lame footwill usually reyeal swelling and tenderness. If the space between theclaws be cleaned out, the skin abrasion is usually plainly evideht. Sometimes there is a thick cheesy coveringof grayish pus over the surface of thesore. At other'times the pus may burrow beneath the skin, and even formpockets that are filled with thischeesy material.Treatment consists in keeping theaffected animals out of the mud andwet manure for several days. Thorough cleansing of the part with anyof the coal-tar dips, using five teaspponfuls per pint of water once daily,is ' very necessary. All the looseshreds of skin should be cut away andpus pockets well drained. Infsmildc?ises, the, application of pine tarproves a very 'effective treatmentThe severer form should receive., inaddition to a thorough cleaning, adressing of equal parts of iodoformand boric acid under a bandage forseveral days. Taken in time and 'vigorously and persistently treated, healing should not be prolonged beyond aweek. If left alone, some cases soonassume the most severe type, whichmeans delayed healing and morebandaging and dressing.New York & Boston i30 day limit Tourist fares toNew York $28.0060 day limit variable route fares toNew York $31.95 Boston $35.55Reduced round flip fares to many other cities and resorts in the EastSuperior Service to the EastARE PUREBRED C0LT$ HARDY?I Experiment Being CJhduited at Kanj sas Agricultural College to FindCost'of Raising.For particulars, rates, folders, descriptiveliterature and sleeper reservations, addressW.
