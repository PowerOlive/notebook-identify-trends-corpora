Catarrh
Catarrh is one of the most obstinate
diseases and hence the most difficult
to get rid of
There is but one way to cure it
The disease is in the blood and all the
sprays washes and inhaling mixtures
in the world can have no permanent
effect whatever upon it Swifts Spe
cific cures Catarrh permanently for it is
the only remedy which can reach the
disease and force it from the blood
Mr B P McAllister of Harrodsburg
Ky had Catarrh for years He writes
I could see no lmorovement whutpvpr
though I was constantly treated with sprays
i IN
ana wasnes and differ
ent Inhaling remedies
in fact I could feel that
each winter I was worse
than the year previous
Finally It was
brought to my notice
that Catarrh was a blood
disease and after think
ing over the matter I
ww It was unreasonable
u mbmI to hs cured by
vfciefc oly
reached the surface I
then decided to try
8 S S and after a few bottles were used I no
ticed a perceptible improvement ContinHinsr
the rejiedy the disease was forced out of my
system and a complete cure was the result
I advise all who have this dreadful disease to
abandon their local treatment which has never
done them any good and take S S 8 a rem
edy that can reach the disease and cure It
To continue the wrong treatment for
Catarrh is to continue to suffer Swifts
Specific is a real blood remedy and
cures obstinate deep seated diseases
which other remedies have no effect
whatever upon It promptly reaches
Catarrh and never fails to cure even the
most aggravated cases

blood remedy guaranteed to contain no

He Wasnt Joking
I had four days growth of beard
on my face when I struck a little town
In northern Michigan said the civil
engineer I found a little coop of a
barber shop near the depot and I en
tered it to discover the barber sitting
on a bench with his head in his hands
As he roused up I told him to get to
work on me but after looking me
over he replied
If I shave you youll have to take
the chances
What chances I asked
Well Ive been on a drunk for the
last week and am just on the point of
seeing rats I may get through with it
all right and I may cut your head off
The man had a wild look and was
all a tremble continued the engineer
and though he smiled as he talked
I saw that he wasnt joking I went
away without getting shaved and for
the next two hours was busy making
purchases As I returned to the depot
I looked in on the barber to see how he
got along and found him hanging dead
Just what would have happened had
he started to shave me I dont know
but Ive always felt much obliged to
the man for putting the case as plain
ly as he did Baltimore Herald
Tried It With Kittens
A little lady of 5 who dwells in Park
Ridge has an ardent sympathy for su
perfluous kittens that is kittens which
have to be drowned Last week she
discovered six wee balls of fur in th
woodshed and instantly the burning
question was What shall we do with
themr
Her mother and father advocated
the usual method of keeping one for
Katherine and drowning the others
But little Katherine determined to
thwart their plans She had heard a
story how a little baby was left in a
basket on a doorstep and how with
the light of dawn the kind old couple
took in the little foundling and reared
it as their own child
Katherine found in the cellar five lit
tle fruit baskets Into each of these
she put a kitten nnd then waiting un
til her mamma had lain uown for her
afternoon nap she laid a basket on
the doorstep of each of five houses
whose owners she regarded as charita

The Advantage of One Eye
During the Spanish American war a
certain old colonel who had lost an eye
at the battle of Gettysburg was very
indignant because he was put aside as
physically incapacitated when he ap
plied for admission to one of the New
York volunteer regiments
Filled with wrath and chagrin the
colonel journeyed to Washington bent
on having a personal interview witb
the president He succeeded in gain
ing an audience and the president
after listening to his plea said kindly
But my good Colonel J you have
only one eye
Just so sir was the prompt re
joinder but cant you see the great
advantage of my having only one eye
When I aim my gun I shant have to
close the ether
He fought at Santiago
The Dean In Hid Nightshirt
Hugh Pearson always spoke of Dean
Stanley as the most absent minded
man in the world He was driving
once with him into Palmero He com
plained of feeling cold and as Stanley
had his traveling bag with him he ad
vised him to put something extra on
lie did so and both resumed their pa
pers A loud laugh from some boys
suddenly roused Pearson to the realiza
tion that Stanley was driving through
the streets in his nightshirt which he
had put on over his coat in pure ab
sence of mind
