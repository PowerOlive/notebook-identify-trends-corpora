W. S. Dudley Oil and Gas Co.
. (Incorporated) ,
16,000 Acres
$250,000 Capital Stock
Shares $1,00 Each
Statement of the W. S. Dudley Oil and Gas Co.
By Its President
For some time past myself and associates have been selecting
and acquiring oil and gas leases in Magoffin, Perry, Breathitt,
Leslie, Clay, Owsley and Knott counties, Kentucky, to-wit:
Magoflin 4,623 acres Perry 2,860 acres
Leslie.. . 4,205 acres Owsley 250 acres
Clay 1,305 acres Knott 2,525 acres
Breathitt 256 acres
"We have taken the precaution to have the titles and acreage
approved by lawyers and engineers familiar with the titles and acre
age in the respective localities.
We acquired these leases in part on the report of geologists,
and in localities close to where drilling is now heing done, and also
where we have good reason to believe that drilling will shortly be
started.
We have reliable information that contracts have been execut
.ed for drilling more than thirty wells on lands adjacent to or near
some leases owned by this Company; work has already begun un
der some of these contracts. There is now a well good for 50 bar
rels on a tract adjoining a 350 acre lease owned by this Company;
another good one on a tract adjoining a 500 acre lease of this
Company; a good flowing well was brought in on a tract adjoining
a;Ll 5 acre tract of this Company. We confidently expect many more
. gopi wells to come in on lands adjacent to these owned by this com
pany.. Tire acreage of the leases thus acquired approximate 16,000
acres, which have been sold and conveyed to the W. S. Dudley Oil
& Gas Company at $7.50 per acre, for which the various grantors
have taken stock in the Company at par.
The authorized Capital Stock of this Company is $250,000.00,
of the par value of One Dollar ($1.00) per share, and.it is the pol
icy of the Company to sell $100,0 00, of this stock at the present
time, for the purpose of protecting and developing the property,
which, money will be economically and conservatively expended.
This stock is sold at par without any commission. '
Mr: G. P. Morison, formerly of Knoxville, Tenn., now of Lex
ington, is Vice-President and General Manager. He has had long
experience in development work, and is a successful business man,
being a man of high standing, ana the one-half owner of the Mar
Ian Coal' Co., located on the property of the Kentucky River Coal
Corporation on Rockhouse Creek, in Letcher County, Ky.
Mr. Richard Godson, Attorney, of Midway, is Secretary and
Treasurer.
W. S. Dudley is President.
The three above named gentlmen, together with C. L. Ryley,
of the C. L. Ryley Coal Company, of Lexington, and W. O. Davis,
of Versailles, Ky., .General Counsel of the Kentucky River Coal
Corporation, compose the Board of Directors.
We want the public to fully understand, before purchasing
this stock, that this is a venture pure and simple, as are all compa
nies formed for the purpose of drilling oil.
The Secretary and Treasurer will keep an accurate account of
all money received and expended, and the books of the Company
will be open to the inspection of stockholders at all times. He will
receive for his services a fair salary, as will also the Vice-Presi-'
dent and General Manager. The President will not receive any sal
ary until such time as the business of the Company will take more
' of his time than he now expects to devote to it, or until it is on a
dividend basis. . '
The President of this Company has been instrumental in de
veloping three oil prospects, one in Estill County, upon which there
were twenty-one wells drilled and oil in all, and two properties on
Big Sinking Creek in Lee County. One has been developed and of
.the nineteen wells drilled, they were all oil wells. The other has
nine wells drilled and all oil wells, there is room for about twenty
more wells on this property, which are now being drilled, and he
is not expecting a dry hole. He knows nothing about oil, nor does
he know that there is a barrel of oil on the 16,000 acres owned by
tkis Company, but he believes there is a fair chance to find some
where in Eastern Kentucky another oil pool, and the idea in taking
up this acreage and having it scattered as it is, and getting it as
close in as possible to where drilling is being one, is to be the owner
of leaseswherever that pool may be discovered, and to have the
money in the treasury to immediately start drilling, and if not so
fortunate as to have leases where the pool may he found then to buy
acreage near that pool and start development.
The offices of this Company are located at 703 First & City Na
tional Bank Building, Lexington, Ky., where the stock will be for
sale to the public to the amount of $100,000. Checks should be
made payable to the W. S. Dudley Oil and Gas Company.

BARNES.
Mention of the fact that Mrs. C.
P. Barnes had died at her home in
Kansas City, Mo., after a short ill
ness, would not mean much to the
people of Paris, but to those who
knew her in the early days of her
womanhood as Miss Sallie Short, at
one time one of the most popular
teachers in the old Paris Public
School, it will be the cause of the
most sincere regret.
Mrs. Barnes was a daughter of the
late Mr. and Mrs. James Short, who
for years occupied the old home at
the corner of Main and Second
street, recently occupied by Mr. and
Mrs. Jesse Napier, and now owned
by the Mammoth Garage Co., of Lex
ington. Possessed of womanly vir
tues and accomplishments of an un
usually high order she endeared her-
Iself to all who had the good fortune
to be under her tuition, and there are
to-day hundreds in the city of Paris
and the county of Bourbon, former
pupils, who will recall with pleasure
the many happy days they spent in
their school days when "Miss Sallie"
dispensed knowledge and justice un
sparingly. Her memory will be ever
revered by those who knew her best.
While in Louisville several years
ago the writer called on Mrs. Barnes,
who was at that time the head of
one of 'the most prosperous jewelry
establishments in the West. Mrs.
Barnes was delighted to talk of the
ohi days in Paris, and made inquiries
regarding the welfare of all the "old
boys and girls" whom she could re
member. ,
