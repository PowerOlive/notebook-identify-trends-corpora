he Was she not there tokeep house for him And when she leftas of course she should in time wouldnot Marion then be ready to take herplace She never heard of anything soridiculousAnd to think that her poor motherwho had been hardly two years in hergrave should he so soon forgottenIf she thought that her adored CharlesEdward would ever be so false to hermemory she was sure that it wouldbreak her heartBut the postscript was the unkindestcut of all The slighting manner inwhich her father alluded to the youngman whose name she had written tohim in full Charles Edward FitzHenryStubbs was more wounding than theharshest invectiveAnd to presume to think that she knewnothing of love who had experienced itin sweetness and powerFull of these indignant thoughts Annesat down and penned an epistle to heradored Charles Edward detailing hergrievances and ending with the declaration that she would mpver never submitto be domineered over by a stepmotherand that she would ever be true to ueflrst and only love of her lifeThe next mail brought a reply statingtogether with many protestations of undying affection that he could truly sympathize with her feelings in view of herfathers marriage having just receivedthe intelligence that his mother was totake another husband She had givenhim one stepfather when he was a boyand he would never submit to the rule ofanotherHe would be there on Thursday todemand in person her hand of her fatherIf he refused they would fly together tosome happy place where cruel fathersand stepfathers were unknownCharles Edward was as good as hisword Promptly on the following Thursday he made his appearance at the houseof the father of his adored AnneScarcely were the first rapturous greetings over when the sound of carriagewheels was heaid4nne turned paleThey have come she cried startingto her feetLet em come responded CharlesEdward defiantly You ar not afraidI hope when I am hereAs he said this curiosity impelled himto turn his eyes to the windowGood heavens he ejaculated as theyfell spon a lady who was lighting froma carriage Why it looks like but noMr Leslie lad his wife uo to where hisdaughter was standingAs Mrs Leslie turned from the constrained greeting of her new daughterher eyes fell upon the young man backof her who stood staring at her inspeechless amazementWhy CharlesWhy motherI never thought of seeing you hereNor I youWho is this inquired Mr Leslielooking in bewilderment from one to theotherIt is Charles Edward that I wrote youabout said Anne blushingIt is my son Charles said Mrs Leslie Charles this is your stepfatherAnd my future father-in-law I trustresponded Charles Edward as he shookhands with his mothers new husbandWell see about that my boy saidMr Leslie laughing If your mother iswilling I shall have no objectionThe four passed a very pleasant evening Charles Edward voted his stepfather to be one of the nicest men he evermet and Anne thought no lady could bemore agreeable than her new motherCharles Edward remained at home aweek and then went back to school taking with him the assurance that if hestudied diligently and both he and Annewere of the same mind at the end of theyear no

garrison entered the hostel but to my joy I saw 1 wasnot known to them and after a casual glanceat mo they fell to eating their mealI wa however perforce compelled to listen o their conversation which was carriedrn in the loud tone men of their class aiiectand found to my annoyance that they werediscussing me and the events of the dayIn order to escape this I was about to risewhen 1 heard one of them mention DEntrangues name and stopped to listenlie has left for Florence and it is saidintends to offer his sword to the Sifenory3uid oneAnd the otherI leaven knows Perhaps liraccio s armhas

dicing I had hotrarcr heardenough and settling my account with thehost stepped forth into the street intending to depart from the town by the PortaSpirito or Roman gate leaving thecamp over lay shoulder and to make my wayto Florence as soon as possible There Iwould meet DEntrangues and kill him likeS mad dog I ground my teeth with ragewhen I thought I had no horse nor eventhe means to purchase one and must trudgeit like any contadino But if I had to crawlon my hands and knees 1 was determined toreach Florence and DEntranguesIt was however not yet sundown and myidea was to leave the city when it was welldusk to avoid all possible chance of recognition I meant to have passed the intervalin the inn but as 1 felt this was impossible it was necessary to find another spotwhere I could lay in quiet With this endiu view I crossed the Piazza di Popolo in aneasterly direction and -vent on until Icame to the Franciscan church into whichI entered not I am sorry to say with anydesire for devotion but merely because Iwas less likely to be disturbed there thananywhere else I could imagine I was rightin so far that on entering the church I foundit as 1 thought empty but on looking roundI saw beneath the newly completed wheelwindow the work of Gufllaume do Marseille a kneeling figure apparently absorbedin pray 1 1 had approached quite close hefore I became aware that I was not aloneand was about to turn away when perhapsstartled by the sound of mv footfalls on themarble pavement the person rose hurriedlyanil looked towards me ItwasMme DEntrangues Her glance met mine forond as tiuiL of a stranger but as 1 was moving away some trick of gesture or T hapsthe hot anger in my eyes told her who 1 wasfor calling ray name she came towards mewith outsi 1 ii hed handsDi Saveili she said for I made no advan you not know meMadame 1 bowed 1 am unfit to touchvouNo no a thousand times nowho am unworthyI st il remained silent and Bhewith a passionate emphasisMan you have never sinnedi he words b ruck me IiLv a eh itIt is IaskedI fellii a moment 1 had no right to stand injudgmented knows 1 replied I have and Ihave been puniWith that she took hold of my hand andthen suddenly burst into tears weepingeve r me with words I cannot repeat It wasnot for me to fling reproaches and I softenedand did what 1 could to appease her1 could not help it she said I wasnotstrong cnou h to speak or to let you speakOh yen do col know whal such a thing ta womanLet it pas- madame What is dead isdeadI cannot And yet what can I do Hertears began afreshIn a little time she grew better and Iseized the opportunity to point out the danger she ran of being seen speaking to meand suggested that i3 should make her wayhome It was impossible to escort her myself but would 1 w 1 a little way behindkeep her in sight see she came to noharm 1 urged this ail the more as 1 saw itwas growing late and that she was withoutany attendants and far from the campYou mistake she said I have not farto go In fact I am at present the guestof the convent hereAnd I did not finish the sentencebut she understood I had forced myself toask to hear if possible confirmation 01DEntrangues movementsTie she answered he has left thearmv and gone towards FlorenceAnd youI stay here for the presentIler tone more than her words convincedme that she had been abandoned by DEntrangues and it added another mark to myscore against himWhy should I not tell you she continued After when it was all over theduke struck his name off the army and heleft in an hour Before he went he cameand told me all laughing at your ruin I didnot know man could be so vile Cod help meit is my husband I speak of He offeredto take me with him but I refused and heh ft mocking like a devil with words I cannot repeat He was not done with yon orwith me he said as he went 1 came hereac once and perhaps when Mme de la Tremouille returns to Franco I shall be enabledto go with her in her trainExcuse my asking it I said but haveyouOh yes she smiled sadly it is not thatin any wayAt this moment I looked up and saw thatit was sunset Through the wheel windowthe orange beams streamed in a long bannerand lit up the figure of the saint above

HEARTI was not so dense as to fail to grasp theextent of the peril I had escaped or to fullyrealize the evil strength of the temptationwhich came upon me as suddenly as a sneezeIt is rare in matters of this kind for wickedthoughts to be of slow growth they springat once to life full armed 1 thanked Godin my heart that I was able to sweep asidethe base desire which covered my soul likea black cloud and refrained from taking advantage of madames momentary weakness1 could not but see 1 was to blame myself1 the elder and the stronger should haveforeseen the probable consequences of afriendship such as ours and my sorrow f oilier was mixed with the deepest regret formy part in the transaction I banished aidea of attacking DEntrangues through hiswife wondering at the littleness of spiritwhich had ever conceived such a thoughtIf it were possible I would have kicked myself Perhaps such victory as I gained overmy heart was due to the secret springs ofmy vanity being touched to the fear of theloss of my self respect and this minglingwith my pity and regret gave me thestrength to win at the moment of temptation It is difficult to tell I have lived longenough in the world to know that the mysteries of the heart will remain veiled to theend Occasionally we may lift the curtaina little but more no man has doneWhat happened however explained eto mc the motive for DEntrangues tonduct He at any rate must have ssn lougbefore either of us how affairs stood withthe wife whose life he embittered but hemade no effort to save her contenting himself with striking an assassins blow whichhad taken from him the last shred of respect madame may have felt for him andwhich had in part recoiled on his own headlie this as it may his stroke was successfulin that to all intents and purposes it hadutterly blasted me I was worse than deadIt was no ordinary revenge In thosetroublous times a blow from a dagger couldhave easily rid him from a wife of whomhe was sick or a man whom he hated andno one would have thrown the matter in histeeth But with devilish cruelty he inilicted wounds which could never heal andleft his victims to live It was impossible tonit such a man back in a way to make huefoci to the utmost extent the agony he hadadministered the only thing was to takef t m him his worthless life this he doubtless valued most of all thing and I meantto deprive him of it if he stood at the altarof Christ Moved by such thoughts andwilh my cloak drawn well over the lowerpart of my face 1 hastened towards theHoman gate reaching it just as it was to beclosed for the night In fact as I passediut the huge doors came together behind mewith a groaning and at the same time Iheard the dull boom of the evening gun11 n the camp followed immediately by thtut peals of the

least two days unless mytravels were permanently Btopped by mybeing cut off by a privateering party fromthe camp or by any other untoward accident Neither contingency was unlikelyfor the writ of the

AND MILKINGSix Cows to One Man Is About theKlirlii Proportion for the Average Farm EmployeThere seems to be a great deal ofdiscussion among the farmers in different localities nowadays in regard tothe subject of good milkers The remark that it is now almost impossibleto find good milkers is quite frequently heard among dairymen This is agreat mistake says a writer in RuralNew Yorker I thoroughly believe thatthere are just as good milkers in thisanil other localities as there ever wereif not betterThe farmer who depends on dayhands for his help as a general ruleis the one who complains most bitterlyin regard to this matter The averageman who is hired by the day will notmilk even if he can Wherever or whenever I find a good month hand one whostays on the farm continually one whois not constantly listening for thesound of the six oclock whistle onewho does not go to town every nightI find a good milkerA cow should be milked as quicklyas possible A good milker can milk 12cows an hour The muscles of the forearm wrist and hands of a good milkermust be well developed therefore aa rule women are poor milkers Theyrequire too much time to milk a cowThe evil resulting from this practiceis that the cows do not readily givedown their milk Some farmers txpect a man to do too much of this workThe number of cows that a man milksshould depend on the amount and nature of other labor that he performsAs a rule i do not believe that a manshould be allowed to milk more thansix cowsPRACTICAL DAIRY HINTSKeep the cow warm and dryMilk with clean dry hands as quickly as possibleFeed

fullbearing and is regularly picked eachyear enough twigs are broken off during the harvesting of the crop to prunethe trees sufficiently But if the treegrows on low wet ground it oftenruns too much to wood the fruit eitherdoes not set or rots because it is toomuch shaded by leaves which arecaused by too luxuriant growth Insuch cases severe root pruning and cutting-out the center limbs while in leafwill sufficiently check growth so muchthat the tree will both blossom fullyand will also bear fruit After thecherry tree begins bearing the wastageof twigs broken off in harvesting thecrop checks wood growth sufficientlyto make the tree bear full crops thereafter But it must be remembered thatso much of the cherry is in the stonewhich requires heavy doses of potashto perfect it that if the cherry tree isnot liberally supplied w ith potash andother mineral fertilizers it will soonbegin to die The cherry tree neverfails to bloom and set fruit so longas any part of it lives It prunes itselfby letting enough of its limbs die sothat what remain can produce as muchand as fine fruit as they ever did Mostof the larger fruit trees stop bearing as they grow old The cherry treekeeps on bearing so long as any pattof it is alive American CyitivaioGREAT RAILROAD BUSINESSOfficial Statistics Prepared by the In-terstate Commerce CommissionShow Many ThingsOfficial statistics prepared by

and father of nature who has blessed us Perhaps hemay give me opportunity to honor himeven through one good deedSo spoke the Brahman and went Theblossom of pore joy is gratitude and itsfruit henovolenceWith the lively feeling of honoring thegreat and beneficent spirit the old manstepped into the helds and in the shadeof theprayertrees each of his thoughts was aStill sparkled the drops of afleshly fallen shower on stalks blossomsand leavesAlthough he had already seen thespring 90 times nature seemed to himagain made young and fairer than everfor she grows not old to him who reveres her creator and recognizes in thefigure the benevolent sculptorThe old man set on his way forwardand on the beaten path he found ailacorn The rain had already through itsfertilizing power sent the germ forthand the shell hurst asunder hut it couldnot take root on the hard hare path Hestooped took it up and saidllow charming it is to he brought thusfar on my way for easily hadst thoubeen trodden in pieces by the foot of thewanderer or withered bj the solar raysHappy shall I be if I can here do a goodwork and by deed fulfill my inward sentiment and the aim of wise nature adranee who with each breath shows abenefit even the smallest thankfulnessis a sweet dutyA youngster who stood behind the oaktree and who had caught up the wordsof the Brahman stepped forward andjceringly smibdWhy smiist thou asked the oldmanThe youngster answered At thy childish thought my elder that thou canstrejoice at having rescued the life of anacorn fYoungster said the Brahman howart thou able to know my thoughts sincetoday is the first time thou hast seen meVAnd why dost thou jeer at the smallservice which I intend to perform to nature To her is the acorn worth as muchas the tree and witht this werenot Even virtue m withthe little and from this mounts upwardto the great but the nearer she approaches to the completion of tne originaleven so much the more she herself inclines to humility and simplicity andthen to her is worth the smallest asmuch as the highest Sends not Brahmatoo his ray and dew on the blade ofgrass as well as on the palm treeThus spoke the old man with friendlyseriousness The youngster silently withdrew himself full of veneration He hadseen the noble old man in his dignityand he wished to be like him for frivolity itself must in its heart revere virtueThe Brahman set forward on his way toa hill which was overgrown round aboutwith thorns He met a peddler who asked Thinkest thou that out of an acornthou canst rear a tree for thyself Thouwilt indeed scarcely have the joy of itsshadeThe old man answered Must one atthe planting think only on the shade ofthe tree and on oneself Does natureso My sou he who has not plantedearlier than and before yesterday findsin the planting itself his motive and hisjoyHe came to the hill on the peak ofwhich among the thorns he buried theacorn and covered it carefully over withearth and mossWhy plantest thou among thornscalled out a herdsman opposite to himThou carest badly for thy nurslingFriend replied the Brahman solong as the little plant is tender aiid smallthe thorns will shelter it from raw windsand injury and when it grows up it willwork a way through for itself for it ian oak Ify son 1 have obtained this ofnature The good mother considers equally the tenderness aiid strength of her foster childrenAfter the old man had completed hiswork ne trod gayly on the way back tohis homestead A he drew near to hishut his grandsons and great grandsonssprang toward him and asked Wherehast thou been so longBut he assembled them around him andrecounted all whim had happened to hiand the little children caressed the oldman while ke spoke Tke elder one sjjever nuug on nis lips and barkened tohimOh said the old man when he hadfinished there is certainly no place fairer than in the lap of natvre when thefather loves his offspring at m the quietcircle of his family is beloved by his children Yes love abounding Brahmacried he and glanced upward to heavenin the quiet circle of nature and of domestic peace stands thy holy templeThe new planted oak soon grew forthout of the germ and raised itself upabove the thorns and became a spreadingshady tree There died the old man andhis loved ones buried him on the hill andwhenever they saw the tree and heard itsrustlings they
