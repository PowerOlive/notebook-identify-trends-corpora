provisions to the fortxLt Malaxa were held in check throughout the day by the Christian insurgentsThe troops finding that they couldnot reach the forts signaled the gunboats requesting aid The gunboatsopened fire upon the insurgentsbut could not drive them fromthe positions that they occupied which effectually commanded theapproaches to the fort So far asknown the lire from the warships didno damage The insurgent leaders reiterate their refusal to accept autonomyfrom the powers and declare that ifthe island is not annexed to Greecethey desire war If it were not forthe support accorded the Turksby the powers thev would ina short time be driven from theisland It is believed here that success has so intoxicated the leaders ofthe insurgents that they would nothesitate to assume actual hostilitiesagainst the troops of the powers Ifthey should join forces with the Greekarmy of occupation and resist the powers it would take a strong force and alarge expenditure of money

asparagusis a label put on almost all bunches ofthat vegetable as soon as the productof New Jersey arrives all small hardclains are Little Necks although thatpart of Bong Island does not marketover 50000 bushels in a year and thequality of tenderness and flavor variesas it does with Blue Point oysters aterm now used for most small oysters-as Saddle Rock is for large ones al-though no ovsters have been takenfrom that rock in 20 years So much forta reputation but the expert housewife looks the different lots of scallopsover passes by the white ones and buysthose of a yellow tint The fact is thatJtbe meat of the scallop is naturally ajfaint yellow but soaking whitens andinjures it This soaking m fresh waterMs done to make them swell andure more and it increases their bulkby about a third until the frying panhas done its work when they will befound to have shrunken to less than theoriginal size hence it is best to avoidthe white meats if possible It is probable that the price for the umvateredscallops would be better if all shipperswould agree to stop the practice andthen all scallops would be RhodeIslands although market men say thatsome from that state arc watered Thepractice- is a bad one because it injurest he sale of the meats as may be seen bycomparing the prices in the marketsThe scallop isnever slypped alive mthe shell because it breaks easily anddoes not live more than a day or twoout of water besides being so bulkythe freight would be higher FredMather in Appletons Popular ScienceMonthlyThe MnrblohcaU HoysSpeaking of boys reminds me of astory which Polly told

from the Virginia line lives atwo thirds youth for unfortunatelyboth of his lower limbs are artificialtvho has to his credit an act of heroismwhich should make him a loved lad aslong as the memory of those who knowhim lasts It is little crippled Tim Olinivhose home is away up in the mountains Ho miles from everywhere aj abook agent once said of that part of thecountryThis bit of a boy not long ago heardthat forest fires were sweeping- everything that would burn before themalong the Virginia side of the mountains One afternoon he climbedthrough the snow to the top of themountain one of the steepest of theCumberland and took a view of the fireswept country below him Tie was surprised to find the fire so fierce and ashe watched Tim saw that the redtongues were creeping on toward a little log cabin in which two old and helpless women the Ober sisters and theirblind and crippled brother who is oneof the oldest men over on the other sideThe lad realized that the house was along ways from any other farmhouseand knew that the people in the humblecottage would find themselves powerless if they were left in the cabin untilthe fire got to their homeWithout thinking of how much suff ering it meant to his poor aching limbsTim started down the rugged hillsideon his perilous journey of heroism Hehad a race with the fire and twice fellfrom exhaustion and almost despairedof saving the old folks But his indomitable courage never flagged andhe kept on going He reached the oldhomestead just as the prairie fire wasattacking the old frame crib He hurried into the house and informed theold and thoroughly frightened peopleof their danger It only took him a fewminutes to hitch the horse to the sledand the old man was helped on to thisThe four drove to shelter at the nearestneighborsaleaving the fire to do itsworst The home of the old people waspartly burned during- the night butthe boy had gotten some of the neighbors to go and fight the fire and theywere able to save most of the contentsof the houseThe modest looking lad has never recovered from the injuries he sustainedin making the awful trip but he is veryproud of the deed The old people willnever cease to love and contribute to theboys support out of their limitedmeans Washington StarA LONG BURROWTwo Mile Tnnnel Excuvatecl 1 anIndustrious MoleDown along the river bank after thewater had receded into a

the managementis to keep too many hogs together inone shed or inclosurc From waut ofproper protection in the way of housing hogs are very apt to crowd together in bunches during cold weatherand coming into the sheds wet anddirty and being obliged to lie either onold and filthy straw bedding or on a wetand damp floor their sweating andsi earning soon produces a foul atmosphere and the bedding not being removed at proper intervals gets rottenand adds to the contamination of theair JJeing thus packed together in thebuilding the hogs in a warm and perspiring condition are next exposed tothe influence of cold winds and wet bybeing turned out in the morning- hoursto run in the field among grass wet withcold dew or from rain or hoar frost orto be fed from troughs in the yardAmong the common consequencesare congestion cold or catarrh and ifthe so called hog cholera happens tobe iirevailhig they are almost certainto be affected with that disease as theirsystems under such management

unpaved or withoutflooring are constantly damp and wetwhile pools -of urine and filth aboundand with wind and sleet approachingfrom all quarters In proportion as thestandard of breeding has become higher so has the vital force enerarv andhardiness beccome lessened and the effects of improper quantity and qualityof food filthy or stagnant waterfaulty construction of houses and undue exposure to atmospheric influenceshave become proportionately morebaneful Western PlowmanApplication of ManureSome farmers make the mistake ofputting coarse straw manure into weTheavy soil thinking that it will have abeneficial effect by making such soillpose and dry and consequently warmer also that the moisture in the soilwill cause the straw to decay morereadily than it would in dry land Thereare conditions in this reasoning thatcannot be brought together The lumpsof wet soil will not mingle with thestraw and are held apart so that theydry out and become hard and themanure is not converted into plant foodPut coarse manure on dry soil and itwill be mixed and incorporated morereadily Plow it into dry land live orsix inches deep and after the seed iscovered put a heavy roller over it andthe roots will find the manure Journal of AgricultureSeeding Clover in iCnolIsIt is often hard work to get a cloverseeding en the dry elevated knollsin grain fields Lack of moistureis usually the cause But theevil ma be remedied bya few yoads of stable manureand spreading over the knolls Themanure not only protects the youngclover plants but it ai o holds the moisture in the soil by checking-

subject of good methods on thefarm as he is about having good andfavorable seasons there would be agreat deal less misnry in the world Oneof the phases of practicing bettermethods that very few farmers sernn toreally understand is that of making alloperations and transactions of thefarm work together to the one end ofproducing big crops regularly just as apiece of complicated machinery has allits parts working in harmony that themachine may do ts work effectivelyAny crop a farmer may cultivate orany kind of live stock he undertakes tokeep upon the farm has its relation toother crops or kinds of stock to be cultivated or raised and this very relationis the thing that should determine theextent to which the farmer is to gowith his various operationsThe man with one idea or a sort ofhobby on a farm generally has a hardroad to travel He works without anyof the advantages that flow fromsmaller economies It is one thing tomake the ends meet but it is anotherand better thing to make them lap overThis is what the up-to-date all aroundfarmer should be constantly doing Heshould strive as far as lies in his powerto make of the farm a complete homoHe must vary his methods too to suitthe occasion And this is where thewell informed farmer always has theadvantage of those who know little ornothing as to what -is passing in theworld outside their own immediateneighborhood It requires knowledgeand the exercise of judgment along ailth sse lines for a mar to know with anything-like precision whether it is bestto extend or curtail his operationsalong certain lines of crop productionfor any particular year Jumping atconclusions or following along inan old rut is a style of farming thatought not to be permitted m this dayand ageIf there is any one expression that describes the successful farmer of to dayit is that of being- up to the times Othrthings being equal this farmer isfound in the lead everv dav and evervwhere Seme farmers are always waiting for an opoprtunity but there areothers who make a business of creatingi opportunities A good and favorableI season for crop growing is not the onlvj thing that pushes prosperity into- afarmers doorwdy Let the farmer follow his best judgment with a look outfor the main chance always and he iscertain to succeed provided his judgj ment is cast along intelligent linesI Dakota Field and FarmBOYS ON THE

leastamount of judgment in anything pertaining to farm matters In fact hawas a mere machine When the bovwas 18 his father was stricken downwith a lingering disease but still thelatter persisted in pursuing the courseof training his boy lie planned everything until three weeks before hisdeath To day his boy knows but littlemore than an infant about lavinsr outhis workAs soon as the boy is 12 years old histraining should begin Show him thathe is of more consequence than a machine that he is put here to think planand carry out work Give him a pieceof ground and reach him the first rudiments of farming letting- him see allthe while that he is working for himself As he grows old give him a coltor a cow and let him raise stock forhimself Then take him into confidenceas to the buying and selling of farmproduce and occasionally let him manage thef arm for a day or so Above allbapatient with him Nothing discouragesthe average boy more than fault-findingwhich makes him gradually lose

train mileage was S34200000 This means thaton the average a passenger can travelover 6000000 miles before being killedin a raala accident or to put it inanother way he can travel back and Iforth between Aw York and SanFrancisco as frequently as the trainwill carry him -about 30 years before hisfatal accident is dueIt appears from the same authoritythat about one quarter as many persons were killed by street car accidentslast year as by disaster on the steamroads There are no data at hand forcomparing- the two modes of travel jbut it seems probable that the steamroads are considerably safer than thetrolley -cars if the distance traveled betaken into account The figures do notshow how many of those set down askilled by trolley car Occidents werepassengers and how many innocent
