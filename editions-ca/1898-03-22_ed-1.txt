KeyWest From Norfolk VirginiaWashington March IS The eventof the day in official circles was the issue of an order for the formationof a new squadron of navalvessels to be stationed at Hampton Koads The squadron in the he-ginning-will consist of five ships allthe best of their types Two of themthe battleships Massachusetts and Texas are withdrawn from the presentIsorth Atlantic fleet at Key West andTortugasIn ordering- this movement the navydepartment is not animated by anypurpose of yielding- to representationsor intimations that may have comefrom the Spanish minister On thecontrary the formation of the newStir Gen J R Tryon U S Navysquadron was brought about by purelystrategic considerations although itappears from the nature of theforce so far under orders torendezvous at Hampton Roads thatthis strategy is of the defensive nature The new squadron can not becalled a flying squadron because theassociation of heavy battleships withfleet cruisers like the Brooklyn Columbia and Minneapolis reduces the available speed of the whole to the speed ofthe slowest vessel and the squadroncould not do much living in thenaval sense The indications ratherare that when reinforced by somesmaller cruisers the squadron will constitute an ideal naval defense Forthe past two months influences havebeen at work in the navy departmentabout this change and as a policyboard headed by Capt Crowninshieldhas been in frequent session of late atthe department it is believed that ithas endorsed the plan at last Although the other ships to be added tothe squadron have not yet been definitely selected it is surmised that theywill include some of the other battleships at Key West and the armoredcruiser New York in which case AdmSicard it is believed will commandthe new force In place of the cruiserNew York the people of Key Westwill look upon the grim outlines ofI J the big monitor Puritan supposedlythe most powerful ship in smoothwater in the world She will have toassist her on guard the double turretedmonitor Miantonomah and the monitorAmphitrite The Puritan is now atNorfolk almost ready for sea theMiantonomah is at League Island quiteready and so is the Amphitrite at PortRoyal S C So the order in the endwill result in the gathering of the pickof the North Atlantic squadronat Hampton Roads The pointis said to be the best strategically on the Atlantic coast It is almost centrally located and the shipsfrom that point can reach any portionof the coast in short order which is regarded as desirable since no one cantell just where a flotilla of torpedo destroyers or a fast cruiser may turn upwith hostile intent to attack atown Besides the second bestnavy yard in the country is thereto fall back upon for repairsto the ships plenty of the best coal isat Newport News there is easy waterto navigate and finally the forts atHampton Roads may serve asa base ofoperations in case of need for protection These are the considerationswhich animated the navy departmentin making this new order It isannounced that the commander ofthe new squadron has not yet beenselected and pending that selectionor the arrival in port of Adm Sicardit is expected that Capt Higginson the commander of the battleship Massachusetts and the senior officer will hold the command of thesquadronRemaining at Key West after thedeparture of the Massachusetts andthe Texas Adm Sicard will still havea fleet of his own in numbers whenthe spectacle will be presented of afleet and a squadron on one stationsomething not seen since the civil warGfcn Blanco on the Spanish FlagHavana March 18 Gen

ITerribleThere Are About 60000 Spanish Troops on the Island The Insurgents Number About 30000Washington March 18 SenatorProctor addressed the senate Thursdayafternoon giving his observationswhile on his recent visit to Cuba Senator Proctor began by saying thatmore importance had been attached tohis visit than necessary but he thoughta public statement would be beneficialThe only thing he said that he hadsaid about the matter to the presidentwas that he was going- and asked ifthere was any objection to it and wastold that there was none He had letters from Assistant Secretary of StateDay and business men of the UnitedStates He said that Gen Lee andother United States representatives inCuba afforded him opportunity to secure informationHe denied that he made the statement that the Maine was blown upfrom the outside but might have saidthat was the opinion in Havana Thesenator thought there was no definiteinformation to be obtained upon thisfeatureOutside of Havana there was desolation and misery People were surrounded by trochas and controlled byforts or blockhousesHis observations he said were inthe four western provinces Outsidethe trochas and forts there were nchabitations or people livingThe Spaniards he said held in thefour provinces only what their armysits onSenator Proctor described at somelength the condition of the reconcentrados saying- one half of them haddied owing to the manner in whichthey had been kept in the small housesand bad sanitation It was no wonderone half had died he addedHe went to Cuba he said thinkingthe condition of the people had beenoverdrawn but found their situationterrible What he saw he could nottell so others could seeIn one place in Havana the senatorsaid he saw 400 emaciated people laying on stone floors with little clothingThe children had no clothing American people may be assured he continued that their bounty will reach thedestitute and he added The conditionof the reconcentrados will not bechanged until peace comesGen Blancos order of November 13is of little practical use No beneficialresults had followed For this he didnot blame Gen Blanco as Blancolooked at the matter from a militarypoint of viewAs to the military situation he saidthere were about 60000 Spanish troopsHe thought they would fight wellThere was no artillery The troopslive in barracks The cavalry is mounted mostly on poniesHe said the Cubans had about 30000men in the field and were very activeThe Cubans were well armed butpoorly supplied with ammunitionAbout one third of the Cuban armyare Negroes The cavalry men furnishtheir own horsesThe dividing lines between the parties is sharp It is Cubans againstSpaniards The autonomists he didnot consider as they were inconsiderable in numberHe inquired as to autonomy of menof wealth business and professionalmen Without exception their replywas that it was too late for autonomyRepresentative AYheelerof Alabamaintroduced the following joint resolution

Continues With Unabated Vigor Four of the Maine Survivors Had a Iong Consultation WithSecretary of Navy and PresidentKey West March 21 The court ofinquiry according- to Rr Adm Sicardwill continue its work through thecoming week as it is not yet ready tomake a report on the Maine disasterThe statement that Capt Albert SBarker carried the report to Washington is officially denied The object ofhis flying visit to Key West was notascertained outside official circles until Sunday It can be authoritativelystated that Capt Barker had nothingto do with the court of inquiryHe came here on Friday from Tampaon a special mission to investigate theharbor defenses following out somelines suggested by General Wilsonchief of engineers in his recent inspection of land fortifications CaptBarkers plans when he left here Saturday night was to confer with Commander McCalla of the Marbleheadwho is now at Tampa and he willprobably remain there a day or soCapt Barker formerly commanded theOregonIt is impossible to say definitelywhether any synopsis of the findingsof the court up to date has been sentto Washington The notion prevailshere that this has been done but noofficial confirmation is obtainableThat the final report has been sent toWashington can be definitely deniedWashington March 21 The keenest expectancjr was apparent in all official quarters Saturday in anticipation of the early receipt of the reportfrom the court of inquiry on the Mainedisaster Warlike preparations continued with unabated vigor at the warand navy departments but the maininterest of officials centered in theforthcoming- report The interest wasso intense that many reports gainedcirculation to the effect that the officialdocument would be in the hands ofthe president within the next fewhours but on inquiry in authoritative sources were found to be inaccurate Persons in position to knewhad little to add to the fact alreadymade public that the report is expected within the next few days A cabinet officer stated that it would be hereearly next week Beyond this hecould not go It was stated definitelythat no advance intimation as to thecharacter of the report had been madeThe rumor had it that Lieut Blowhad brought to Washington an abstractof the conclusions but this was dismissed after Lieut Blow had been inconference with Secretary Long andother naval officialsThe chief development of the morning was the arrival of four of the survivors of the Maine disaster who helda long conference with Secretary Longand later was taken by the secretaryto the white house for a talk with thepresident These survivors are LieutG F W Holman navigator of theMaine Lieut George P Blow LieutA JB Gatlin in -command of-on the Maine and BoatswainLarkin one of the non commissionedofficers of the wrecked battleshipThese men had passed throughthe fearful ordeal of the explosion and had been at Havanasince it occurred There had been noannouncement of their being- detachedfrom Capt Sigsbees command at Havana and their coming was a completesurprise except to a few officials Withthem came Naval Constructor Hooverwho was sent by Secretary Long fromWashington a few weeks ago to makea technical inspection of the wreck ofthe Maine He was the naval constructor who for months was engagedin actual work on the Maine while shewas on the stocks so that he is in aposition to know every plate and pieceof constructural steel remaining- ofthe ill fated ship The divers hadfound great difficulty in identifyingsome of the battered and twisted platesfrom the bottom of the Maine and itwas believed that Constructor Hooverstechnical knowlenge would be able tomake this identification completeThe conference between LieutsBlow and Secretary Long lasted forsome time Capt Crowninshield of thebureau of navigation and other officials being called in It was statedauthoritatively after the conferencethat the main subject of conversationwas the explosion itself comprising adetailed narrative of the officers and aharrowing- description of the calamityWhether the cause of the explosionwas under discusion could not belearned It was naturally inferredthat these officers with theircomplete personal information of theexplosion and their subsequentvisits to the wreck would give Secretary Long the benefit of their personalviews on the cause of the disaster Atthe same time with the court of inquiry having complete jurisdiction ofthis subject it was felt that the question of cause might be open to muchreserve even as between these navalofficers and the secretary of the navyKecruits for Aitillery

regarding therobbery and what was worse nothing seemed to be done in the matterEvery one seemed to have forgotten allabout it except that you were theguilty one that was not forgottenOh Nelson I felt so sorr for you Iknew how honorable you were andhow heavy your heart must have beenSo I made up my mind to do somethingmyselfYouYes It was foolish I know butI could not rest until I determined toand

station agent at a retired place likeSidington of being a detective Ofcourse I did not tell father that theman for whom I desired the positionwas a detectiveI made no reply to her last words Indeed I could not My mind was in awhirlIt is all so mysterious and nowyour dear life is threatened Florenceexclaimed the tears again coming toher eyes and falling down her cheeksWhile again endeavoring to calm herthe sound of approaching footstepsreached usCHAPTER XIIMr Morley came down the path fromthe house At first he did not see usand Florence called which caused himto turn and approach As he drew nearhis glance rested on me Then hescanned his daughters face anxiouslyHis face grew white and a drawn expression came over it he tottered inhis walk and seemed to keep uprightby an effort of willChild why have jou tears in yourejes he asked in low husky tonesThen without pausing for answer hewent on Retire into the housedaughter I wish to speak to Mr Conway Change your habit if jrou wishI do not think I will be able to ride withyou this morningOh father you are ill Florenceexclaimed in deep concern What isit Do come with me into the houseand let me do something for you Ina loving way which was all her ownshe drew his arm through hersThe parent glanced down at thebeautiful upturned face with solicitouslove shining upon it and his face lostsome of its haggardness He smiledand replied I am not ill Florenceonly a trifle worried Do as I requestedpleaseIn obedience she slowly withdrewsending back to me an appealingglanceWhen she had gone I turned my gazeupon the father There was no wonderthat Florence had expressed concernfor her parent Even the momentaryglimpse I had caught of him on themorningafter my arrival showed mea change And now that a closer inspection was possible the differencebetween the Mr Morley of a year agoand the man now standing before mewas startlingly apparent He certainlylooked like a sick manYou had better sit down sir I saidin commiseration for his weaknessMr Morley sank down upon a rusticseat and I remained standing beforehim awaiting his words with emotionsalternating between hope and fearI I have lost somewhat of latebusiness reverses he murmuredThen suddenly fixing his eyes on myface in a searching glance he saidMy daughter was weeping What wasthe reason What did you say to herto cause her tearsIt was her own tender heart thatcaused her to weep I replied after apause during which I considered whatanswer I should make For it did notseem right to add any fresh trouble tothe already overburdened manHe regarded me with a questioninglook and I added She was sorry sirthat my innocence has not been established This was partly the cause forher tears I am deeply grateful forher tender sympathyOh The hard lines of his facerelaxed he drew a long breath Shethinks very highly of you ConwayYour words give me the keenestpleasure Mr Morley and offer me anopportunity to lay before you a subject which may prove unpleasant Isaid eagerlyMr Morley started then a tremorran over him What was the matterwith the man that he seemed to takealarm first at my presence and now atmy words If he was so bound up inhis daughter that he was fearful ofhaving her leave him even to marry theman she loved there seemed small hopeof obtaining his consentIn the fear that I should lose my loveafter all I poured out my earnestwordsMr Morley I want Florence to bemy wife There is no use mincing matters the simple fact is I must haveher She loves me and my Jove for heris part of life itself Will you not giveyour consentTo my disappointment he dodged thequestion altogetherWhy are you here he askedHereYes Why did you come to NelsonvilleTo find rest and quiet and peace toescane neoples cruel tongues I exclaimed impatiently I give you myword of honor sir I went on thinking I divined what his thought was Iknew nothing of your living in Nelsonville No idea was farther from mymind than that I should meet Florencehere But I cannot help telling youhow my meeting her has lightened theburden of the past year how her lovemakes my life appear bright beforeme and shine even through the cloudwhich still rests upon my honor Youof course can withhold your consentbut I tell you openly I shall in thatcase do my utmost to persuade her tomarry me against your wishI was startled by my boldness inspeaking as I did but the words wereout and I would not have recalled themif I couldFlorence would not marry withoutmy consent Mr Morley remarkedwith the trace of a smileAh sir I know that well We canwait until my innocence is proved Butit would be most cruel to us both shouldyou withhold your consentYou are still sanguine then ofyour innocence being establishedTMost assuredly sirWhy an anxious look should appearon his face I could not tell then Iknow the many sudden changes of expression which came over him duringthe conversation caused me considerable surprise at the timeI I have not kept track of that affair he began feebly having beenfully occupied with my own concernsHave er have there been any new developments any discoveries upon whichyou base your hopeAn innocent man cannot be madeto suffer forever according to all lawsof truth and justice I firmly believemy name will be cleared perhaps sooner than expectedThen your hopes are based on meresentiment and not on any discoverybearing on the case Mr Morley askedMostly on the idea that truth willeventually prevail I replied epigrammaticallyA most unstable anchorage nowadays Facts and proofs are what thepractical world demands So then youask me to rescind my request made ofyou a year ago notwithstanding thefact that the conditions remain thesame You have broken your promiseto me how then am I to know that yourprotestations of love for my daughterare sincereI stared at the man in astonishmentfor his words were delivered in a coldmatter-of-fact manner and if therehad been any reason for it I shouldhave thought there was a triumphantring in the tones of his voiceThe idea that Horace Jackson had actually succeeded in persuading the father that I was the guilty one in reference to the bank robbery flashedacross my mind I knew too thatdeep and sincere as Florences lovewas for me she would never be my wifeagainst her fathers wishIn bitterness of heart I broke out ina volume of words urged on to earnestness by the fear that my darlingwould be lost to meGood God sir You love your daughter you love her tenderly Your devotion to her has been a synonym of fatherly love everyone has spoken ofit that knew you Then how in heavensname can you endanger her happinessin life by persuading her to marry aman she cannot love one whom she detests the very sight of whom is abhorrent to her Oh sir she is youngand has a lifetime of happiness orvv-Give me your oath betore Godery before her whichever you maychoose to make it You are pardonme for saying it you are a breakingman Mr Morley sprang from hisseat at these words and stood erectconfronting me with a glare of angryresentment in his eyes But I went onNothing could have stopped me thenIt is true sir the signs of ill healthare upon you That was one causethe change in you which brought thetears to your daughters eyes just nowHis haughty manner subsided wentdown suddenly He sank upon the seatcovering his face in his hands andgroanedI could not help pitying him neither could I resist taking advantage ofthis changeI entreat you sir to ask Florenceto speak out to you from her heartIf she exhibits the slightest compunction at the thought of being my wifeI solemnly promise never to intrude onyour notice again to withdraw fromyour life and hers as completely asthough I had never lived Think MrMorley if anything should happen toyouHappen to me he broke in withhoarse tonesWhy yes people die you knowsometimes suddenly I faltered toomuch astonished at the terrified lookwhich came over his face to choosemy words But my amazementchanged o alarm at the effect of thelast remarkMr Morley s face became ghastlyhis under jaw dropped and his handsworked convulsively His lips movedtoo but no sound came from themThoroughly frightened I stood andwatched him then started with the intention of summoning aid But he detained me by a gesture Finally aftera painful struggle speech came to himHow did you know that he gaspedin tones so low that I was compelledto bend down over him to catch thewords How could you know thethought the feeling the conviction ofix sudden death has been constantlywith me of late Oh God It is coming I know it coming soon that sudden deathNo no Mr Morley I answeredbriskly Cheer up sir I was onlysupposing a case You will not diesir You are a sick man and that isthe cause of your gloomy premonitionsdepend upon it Allow mc to help

immensepropriety but I noticed the young woman had a fleck of black upon her noseA month from now her husband willhave become sufficiently acquaintedwith her to tell her of any such littlething Now however he looks at thespot nervously for he is afraid of hurting her feelings by telling her of itHe wishes he could wish it off For9 himself he tells himself that he lovesher fondly splotch or no

he seized him and lifted himup very hurriedly among the Pintschgas fixtures Then he let him fallrather abruptly to the floor Then hedoubled him up in a sort of coil like akey ring and lengthened him

HUMORISColonel Horns Letter to General LoganExplaining an Attack on Grant Shannon His Associate Was an AmbitiousJTried Chicken EaterTtfrs John A Logan once gave to anewspaper reporter in this city a letterfrom a southern editor that created alot ot talk It was immediately afterthe death of General Grant The reporter had gone to the Logan residenceto interview the general abont somematter then before congress The general was in bed and the reporter was tshown to his room In the course of theevening Mrs Logan entered the bedchamber and took part in the conversation In her hand she held a letter thecontents of which her husband knewabout She wanted to give it to the reporter hut the ceneral objected Butas the newspaper man started to leaveMrs Logan slipped the envelope intohis hand The next morning nearly jevery newspaper in the country printed ja copy oi it it was a rare ana racydocumentColonel Alexander G Horn of Meridian Miss then the editor of The DailyMercury was its author The letterwas intended as an explanation of aneditorial that had appeared a few weeksbefore in The Mercury Colonel Horncontained one of the most cruel articlesabout General Grant ever printed by apress It dared any true southerner togrieve or show signs of sorrow over hiscemise It called upon the people ofDixie land to exult and rejoice at thedeath of the man who had slain theirsons and burned their homes The people of Meridian were astounded Theywent to the editor Colonel Horn andasked him in the name of peace towrite another article withdrawing itHe was obdurate and instead of doingSTHE BOURBON

moment the name of ColonelShannon was before the senate awaitingconfirmation as postmaster at MeridianAn enemy of his knowing the love thatGeneral Logan had for General Grantinclosed copies of the paper to him expecting that Logan would oppose Shannons nomination Shannon and HornLad a dispute over the editorial andtheir relations became so strained thata street duel was only averted by theinterference of mutual friends ColonelHorns letter to General Logan was tothe effect that Colonel Shannon was innocent of the article and had knownnothing about it until he saw it in theXaper I cannot quote the letter withliteral exactness but a part of it was asfollowsNo Shannon had nothing to dowith it In the first place he hasntsense enough to conceive such a sentiment as was expressed in the editorialand if he had he would be too cowardlyto write it He is my partner I am sorry to say but by making him postmasteryou will afford me the opportunity ofgetting rid of himAnd why not take him John Thereis a mighty narrow strip between theradical republicanism that you represent and the Cleveland Mugwumperythat Shannon tries to represent He isnot a Democrat never was and neverwill be I predict that you will soonhave him over on your side and Godspeed the day We Democrats downhere dont want himI am growing old but I am still inpossession cf my mental faculties andI hope to live many

thereacquitted before the courts I wouldlike another job of the same kindYou and I ought to be friends Opposites beget liking You have been abroth of a boy in your party and I havebeen a sheol of a fellow in mineGeneral Logan replied good naturedly to this epistle after which a friendly correspondence sprang up betweenthe erratic genius at Meridian and thesenator Logan read the Shannon letterin the committee room of the senateand then laughingly said that inasmuchas his friend Colonel Horn wantedShannon confirmed he didnt see howhe could oppose him Colonel Hornunreconstructed has long since passedinto silence and a few years later Colonel Shannon was buried at his oldhome in Paulding Miss a town ongemade famous by the publication of TheWeekly Clarion many years ago ofwhich paper he was
