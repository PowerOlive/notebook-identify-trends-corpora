Mr. Joe Connell and family moved
to Paris Tuesday, while Mr. J. W.
Connell and family will move today.
These gentlemen have resided in
Millershurg for the past fifteen years
and have been successful in all their
business enterpiises, ranking among
the most substantial financial men of
Bourbon. It is with regret the people
of this community give them up, and
certainly commend them to the good
people of Paris.
Millersburg has a remarkable hen,
which has never laid an egg on Sun
day. This hen has been laying eggs
for more than a year, and has never
yet failed on Saturday and Monday,
but has never yet broken the Sabbath.
She is the property ot a Presbyterian
lady, which perhaps accounts for her
peculiarity. On Sunday mornings she
comes'down 'from her perch a little
later than the rest of the chickens and
moves apart from them during the
day, spending most of the time in
singing alone. On Monday she is the
first bird to hit the ground and is
ready for her daily labor.
The protracted meeting at the
Methodist church is increasing in
inertest. Rev. Bridges, the well
known evangelist who closed a suc
cessful meeting at Carlisle Sunday
night began here Monday evening, and
will preach every afternoon and even
ing throuhg the remainder of the
week. He is a brilliant man, a scholar
and a forcible speaker. He is greeted
with large crowds at every service
and holds the attention of his audience
through rather unusually long ser
mons. The music which is under the
dircetion of Rev. Corder is good and
on the whole it is proving one of the
best meetings ever held in Millers
burg. "An Evening from the Operas" was
given Thursday evening beginning at
eight o'clock at M. F. C. chapel by
the pupils of Miss Esther Nell. It was
one of the most pleasing musicals of
the season and the young ladies acquit
ted themselves with honor and at the
same time reflected great credit on
thier instructor. The spacious audi
torum was well filled with music lov
ers and they w-re not disappointed.
Miss Nell is a splendid teacher as was
evidenced by the work of her pupils.
The following program was pleasingly
and well rendered:
Piano duet Overture from "Stra
j della" Flotow Misses West and
Redd.
Reading'The Origin of the Opera"

the promoters of "The Smart Set"

CURIOUS BITS
OF HISTORY
PLENTY OF BEER BUT NO
TOBACCO.
By A. W. MACY.
Beer and tobacco are supposed
by some people to be on about
the same footing, but a certain
company In London 200 years
ago did not seem to think so.
It was the business of this com
pany to look after the welfare
of the emigrants who had gone
out from the mother country
to seek homes, in the New
World. In 1629 It sent over the
good ship Talbot, loaded with
provisions, clothing, etc., to the
Massachusetts bay colony by the
same ship the company sent a
long list of instructions in re
gard to their conduct, telling
them what they should and
should not do. One of the things
they were forbidden to do was
to cultivate and use tobacco,
"unless it be some small quan
tise for mere necessitie, and for
phlsick for the preservation of
their health, and that the same
be taken privately by antlent
men and hone other."

Western Union Wins Suit.
In the suit between the Louisville
and Nashville Railroad Company and
the Western Union Telegraph Com
pany, in which the former sought to
annul the privilege of the Western Un
ion to use its right of way for tele
graph lines, tbe telegraph company
made the first score when Judge Muir
Weissinger at Louisville ruled that the
Western Union had the right to con
demn the Louisville and Nashville's
property to its own uses. The com
pany had announced that it would com
pel the Western Union to remove its
lines and that it was going to etab-1
lish an independent commercial line.
Couple Receive Father's Bless
ing. After an exciting raee extending
from Hazel Green to Ironton, Ohio,
Miss Mollie McLinn and Mr. Oliver
Kash were married in the latter city
Friday morning. The reward offered
by the irate father of the girl who
made every effort to stop the marriage
will never be paid, and together the
couple returned to the home of the
bride's father not to receive a repri
mand, but the blessing of her parent.
The couple eloped from Hazel Green
last Tuesday and after making several
unsuccessful attempts to get married
made their way to Ohio where tljey
succceeded in getting the knot tied.
The couple went to Hedges Station on
the L. & E. and drove to North
Middlet.own where they were brought
to this city. It was their intention of
getting married here but were appris
ed of the search the father was making
for his daughter, so they decided to go
to another town.
Securing an automobile here they
were driven by a local chauffeur to
Maysville, and at that point boarded
a train for Huntington. W. Va., but it
is evident they changed their plans,
returning to Ironton, where the chase
ended and where they were married.
The girl is heiress to one of the
largest estates in Kentucy and the
ohjection on the part of the father to
her marriage was on account of her
extreme youth, she being but sixteen
years of age.

DIAMOND NOTES.
Fred Toney, former Blue Gras3
Leaguer, is said to be ready to quit
base ball, according to a report front
Chicago. He has made a supplemental
statement, however, that he could be
induced to stay in the game if hia
salary 'was boosted. Manager Murphy
regards the big Kentuckian as the
coming Amos Rusie and won't let
money stand in the way.
The Louisville Post has the follow
ing of two umpires well known here:
"Good umpires may be scarce in some
parts of the country, but in this par
ticular neck of the woods there are
four men good enough for service in
the fastest kind of company Steve
Kane, Louis Knapp, "Babe" Ryan and
George (Cack) Barrett, everyone a
local boy with plenty of experience.
"Kane's meteoric career from the
sand lots to the NationaI'League was
cut short by a little politics on the
part of Tom Lynch Steve was releas
; ed and immediately signed up with the
j Northwestern League, where a differ
ence of opinion on salary matters sent
himback home. He is orrChivintgoa'
reserve list at present,, and if not a
regular he will probably be found call
ine balls and strikes in the Central.
"Knapp started in the Blue Grass'
and after a successful year went to
Kansas State, where Tip O'Neil soon
signed him up for service in the West
ern. Knapp's work was so good last
year he was made umpire in chief, and
if he keeps improving it won't be lngc
before the big leagues grab him."
