CLAY BROUN
"Runnymeade," one of the show
places of Bourbon county, was the
scene last Thursday afternoon of one
of the loveliest of the spring wed
dings, when Miss Mary Catesby
Clay became the bride of Mr. C.
Beverly Broun, of Charleston, West
Virginia. It was a "quiet wedding,
with only" the members of the two
families and a few very close friends
of the bride present.
"Runnymeade," the scene of the
wedding, is one of the show places of
old Bourbon, and has been in the
Clay family for many generations.
It was made lovely for the occa
sion with bright spring flowers
throughout, the colors being pink
and lavendar.
The drawing room was the scene
of the ceremony. In front of the
improvised alter, made of wonderful
blooming plants and ferns, stood
Rev. W. E. Ellis, pastor of the Paris
Christian church, who. in his usual
gracious way, performed the. cere-
mony which made the twain one.
The "bride was given in marriage by;
"her ,bpher, Mr. Brutus Junius
Cay. The bridegroom's attendant
was Mr., Saunders, also of Charles
ton, West Va. The bride was- lovely
in a costume of grey crepe, beauti
fully fashioned, and wore a pale
pink silk hat.
I Little Misses Mary and Anne
!Clay, daughters 6f Mr. and Mrs,.
Brutus Clay, acted as flower girls,
nd were perfect little faiiries in their
frocks of ruffled organdie. Samuel
Clay, Jr., youngi son of Mr. and Mrs.
Samuel Clay, and nephew of the
bride, was very hansome as ring
bearer. A string orchestra gave a lovely
program during the wedding and
supper which followed. The bride's
table had for a centerpiece a mound
of lavendar and pink sweet peas and
roses. Surrounding this were lovely
sun candy baskets and hats filled
with candy. A delicious wedding
supper of several courses was served
to about seventy five guests.
The wedding gifts numbered more
than two hundred, '-and were'- very
exquisite.
Mr. and Mrs. Broun left on the
6:35 Louisville-" & Nashville train
fornextended trip East.

Senators toward these seven treaties
and that of the Republicans against
the Versailles treaty. It is a con
trast between Americanism and party
selfishness.
The Versailles treaty was not
fought because of any fear lest it in
volved the United States in foreign
entanglements. That is evident
from the fact that the bitterest en
emy of the Versailles treaty was
actually one of the four men who
represented the United States in the
presentation of the seven new treat
ies, and certainly if the Versailles
treaty could be denounced as "en
tangling," what can be said of the
new group of treaties? Republicans
who shouted, "remember Washing
ton's advice" the loudest knew at
the time they' shouted that condi
tions hadso changed since Washing
ton's time as to make it impossible
for the United States to live in iso
lation. '
They have proved since the last
election -and in their efforts in be
half of'fhe new treaties that they
were insincere in their attacks upon
the Versailles treaty. Their objec
tion to that treaty was based, not on
what it contained, but on the con
nection of President Wilson with it.
They know "That is true. And the
country knows it.
PUBLIC SCHOOL END0ESED
LEMON
BY
During the fourth annual con
vention of the American Legion, de
partment of Florida, in session just
closed at Palm Beach, there was
unanimous and enthusiastic adop
tion of the following resolution:
"Whereas the public school sys
tem is the fountain head of better
Americanism, therefore be it
"Resolved, That the convention
favors Federal support of the- public
schools; and be it
"Resolved further, That this con
vention favors an improved system
for the vocational training of ex
service men, backed by ample appropriations."
Senators and representatives in
Congress who favor the Towner-'
Sterling bill, establishing a Depart
ment of Education with a Secretary
in the President's Cabinet, find in
this action of the premier young
American men organization great
encouragement. So many organiza
tions of all sorts have endorsed the
bill that sentiment in Congress is
rapidly crystalizing toward its early
passage. To fincTthe ex-service men
of Florida solidly behind support
for the public school is very gratify
ing to all friends of the bill and all
proponents of Americanization plans
which are to work out through the
public school.
The walking ticket prepared for
those civil service jobholders ap
pears to be a party ticket.
The tariff debate is getting into
full swing in the Senate and may
drag on for three months, so per
haps this is the much-looked for,
elusive normalcy.

o
SO TEE COUNTRY JKAY KNOW
The Democratic party can never
be charged with permitting parti
sanship to interfere With the efforts
to end war. How different is the
attitude of the Democratic Senators
from that of the Republicans of the
Senate of two years ago!
In those days Woodrow Wilson
was trying to give 'the "world the
benefit of America's participation in
a world-wide effort to -end all armed
conflict. Did Republicans lay aside
partisanship and try to help the pres
idents of '"the United States in .that
great desire? x
. Be it said to the eternal shame of
some men in public life they did
not." l
But when President Harjling sent
seven treaties to the Senate that to
gether move in the same directioln
as the League of Nations treaty, fcut
cannot do nearly so much good be
cause of their limitations, the Demo
crats in some instances cast not one
vote against them, and in otlier In
stances cast but few. - , - -That
is a record, the Democratic
party should be proud "of. It means
that Democratic Senators as a. whole
were big enough to put 'country
above the cifance"6,f being in the op
position; iLet it bjj hoped the !Aieiv
ic'an peopTi will remember the'dlff
ererice inthe attitude of Democfahc
