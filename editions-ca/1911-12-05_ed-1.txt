Thisis a question that the people desireanswered, and one that they are beginning to become impatient about, judging from the ever increasing numberof communications on this subjectthat are being received by members ofCongress."Express companies ought to bepermitted to make a good liberal rateof interest on money "actually invested," writes an Iowa man to 'this Congressman.

Such alimited system would help rather thaninjure the buisness of the retailers.Think it over."The Interstate Commerce Commission's report shows that the net income from the express companies'operation is 11,000,000, and on theirown valuation of $27,000,000, theirprofit is shown to be approximately 40per cent It is known that the actualvalue Gf the epxress companies' equip-ment is less than one-half of what1they allege, so that their profit on !money sctually invested runs up tonearly 100 per cent.To Prevent Wastefulness.Z Democratic leaders in the Houie ofRepresentatives are planning to givea great deal of attention during tinssession of Congress to the appropriation Dills.

A high wind, an accompaniment to a terrific storm, swept overthe countryside, and just when Peterman was passing at a distance inwhich the limbs of the monarchcaught and pinned him to the ground,a ponderous tree on the knoll wasblown over and Farmer Peterman waskilled. His grave was added to therow of little graves in the Sugarloafcemetery, and alongside that of the:lrst wife.Always the history of the Petermanfarm was referred to in tones of sadness, and the place grew to be asso-1ciated with the community in sort of aweird way.

His body had beenfound at the foot of a wall, or overshot, near the Peterman farmhouse,and in the latter the brother, John,himself terribly wounded as thoughhe had, been attacked by a veritablemadman, was found In a semi-unconsciouscondition. He acknowledgedhaving slain his brother, "but declaredthat if he had not killed Abram "hehimself would have forfeited his life.ST0PS THAT ITCHIf you are suffering from Eczema,Psoriasis or any other kind of skintrouble, drop into our store for instant relief.
