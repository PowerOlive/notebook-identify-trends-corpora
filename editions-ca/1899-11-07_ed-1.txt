newfiscal year July 1 1S99 and November1 an additional expenditure of 150000rural free delivery has been extendedto nearly 1S0000 persons at an annualcostof about 84 cents per capita againstan average per capita cost of 2 SO insmall towns of 5000 populationIt is a small matter to a resident ofa town says the report to be saveda walk of a few hundred yards to thepost office while on the contrary it isa great accommodation to the farmerto be spared a drive of five or ten milesover corduroys roads to get his mailIn a recent public discussion advocatesof the system who took the value ofthe time thui lost in the busy farmingseason at only 50 cents per head foundthat their figures run up into manymillions of dollars lost to the agricultural interests through being obligedto send to the village for the mailsRural carriers are shortly to be authorized to receive and receipt for letters for registration as city carriers donowThe report recommends the adoptionof some uniform style of mail box forthe rural free delivery service withtwo compartments one for deliveryand one for collection with one master key for the carrier to open the collection compartments of all the boxesand a key for the delivery compartment to be furnished to each patron ofthe deliveryThese boxes are to be put up andkept in repair by the post office department for rental at moderateprices which would not only pay thegovernment interest on its investmentbut yield a revenue The rural mailboxes would thus have thrown aroundthem the undisputed protection of theUnited Slates laws By illustrationit is shown that the rural delivery atWestchester Pa not only paid for itself but left in the nine months of itsoperation up to September 30 a balance of 503 after delivering 155805pieces of mail matter at thedoors of the farmer- The reportsof hostilities of posimasters and fromstar route contractors are dismissed ashaving no substantial grounds and asanimated by no desire for thepublic good A modification ofthe posial

crowd that ever gatheredin the Coney Island club house witnessed the desperate struggle for supremacyIn the fifth round Jeffries had thebetter of the fight in the first two andthe last three Daring the other 20Sharkey forced the issue and like aDull terrier was at his man with bothhands unceasingly In these 20 roundsJeffries great weight and brawn helped him to hold oft the sailor and inthe 22d round swung in a couple ofvicious uppercuts that made Sharkeygroggy Tom came back again in the24th and 25th but was weakened greatly by Jeffries vicious blowsOne minute before the gong soundedto end the fight Jeffries left glove cameoff and practically the contest wasover The refree motioned to Jeffriescorner an American flag was flungaround the champions shoulders andthe crowd on that side and end of thearena cheered wildly The crowd onthe opposite side and end in Sharkeyscorner yelled for Sharkey and themen were led back to their dressingroomsThe thousands of spectators werebanked 40 feet

secondJ ff ries put the sailor to the ropes witha left on the jaw and the referee began to call off the seconds as Sharkeykneeled on the floorBut from the third round onSharkey with his vicious swings tothe ribs and the jaw kept the crowdon its feet waiting for a KnockoutJeffries stood the terrific punishmentand with his ey nose and ear splitcame back jusi as viciously in the lastthree rounds and almost retrievedhimself Then came the unfortunateand unsatisfactory ending Jeffriesglove flying oft bringing the firht toan end although the crowd urgedSharkey to ruh in and end it This hetried to do but Jeffries fought himback and Referee Siler rushedto the rescue Il was noticeable thatJeffries used his weight to its best advantage throwing himself all over thesailor but the la tor did his share ofthe hugging and both were warned repeatedlyTen thousand spectators gatheredaround the ringside Though Coneyisland was swept uv a gale the carscame down crowded to the guards in aswiftly moving line and tie sportswaded to the narrow entrances leadingto the arenaWhen seen in his dressing room afterthe contest Jeffries said Sharkey isthe hardest and est man I ever metand I hardly expect to meet a betterin the future Within six months Jhave met and defeated the best two menin the world and will now take a longrest probably nine months or ayear Never aga n will I fight underthe same conditions

and I could not use itproperiy for the rest of the battle orthe result wouid have been differentfor I think that I could have knockedhim outSharkey was inconsolable and criedLke a child when he went

couldbe heard as the line of foam swept onover the darkened sea with frightfulvelocity Louder and louder came thenoise and the surface of the water behind the advancing line was like a vastsheet of snow- flattened down by theforce of the windNearer and nearer came the ghastlyline while every man stood at his postin silence Suddenly the captainroaredHard up your wheel Hard upThe two men who grasped the spokeshad barely time to obey the orderwhenwith shriek of wind and a rush of boiling water the white line struck thebark and pressed her over until theyards touched the surface to leewardThe storm staysail and maintopsailwere rent to ribbons but the head sailheld and as the stanch bark slowlyrighted this caused her to pay slowlyoff and she gathered headway at thesame time Slowly at first and thenwith increasing speed she boundedalong before the hurricaneAnd now the sea began to rise in allits majesty The masses of waterswept in wild waves before the hurricane their crests blowing olT intospray as they met the full force of thewind After several efforts t he crewsucceeded in loosing a few inches olthe foretopsail and for awhile this heldnobly Then came a stronger puffthan usual and the sail was torn bodily from the bolt ropes disappearingin the gloom like some huge whitebirdThere was nothing to be done butrun before the gale and after sending the mate and half the crew belowthe captain advised Tom and Avery toretire which they did somewhat reassured by the collected bearing of theskipper who seemed to take it all asa matter of course especially as thewind was sending his vessel just wherehe wished to goIn this manner three days and nightspassed until it seem d to Tom that theworld was leade up of wind wives anddarknessOn the fourth morning the wind began to abate and the sun appeared enabling the captain to ascertain his position He found that ihe Seabird hadmade 11 knots an hour during the entire period since the storm struck herwhich canst d bis satisfaction to showitself in his round lace unmistakablySail wa now mac and ten days lat rthe Seabird was sailing proudly on thebosom of the Pacific having roundedCape Horn with the -greatest slant ofwind the old skipper had ever experienced The vessels head was pointedto the north and Tom began to compute the days before they could hopeto reach San FranciscoCHAPTER IIII GIVE MY SHARE TO

promptitude of a sailor theman at the wheel sprang to the rail andcut adrift the life preserver which wasalways ready for use and at the sametime the captain rushed ou deck andordered the ship hove toThen Tom tore off his coat and shoesand leaped over the rail before the captain could detain himLike most Cape Cod boys he hadlearned to swim at an early age and apond in Merrivale had enabled him toindulge in the exercise in late years sothat when he came to the surface hefelt no anxiety for himself althoughdistance awayTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY TUESDAY NOVEMBER 7 1899He struck out with nil his might inthe direction of the vessels wake andsoon caught a glimpse of a white faceahead rising and falling on the wavesKeep up till I reach you he shouted to encourage Avery who was fully50 yards awayThere was no reply and when Tomwas within a dozen strokes of his friendthe latter suddenly threw up his armsand began to sinkTom reached the spot just in time tograsp his hair and drag him to the surface where he lay utterly unconsciousand unable to assist himself Tom supported him as best he could but hisclothes soon began to drag him downand his limbs felt like lead He wasnearly spent when something- whiteswept before his eyes on the top of asea and he saw that it was the lifebuoy With a last effort he struck outand succeeded in grasping itIn the meantime the Seabird had beenbrought to the wind and a boat loweredwith all possible speed but it is a slowoperation at best and the craft was ahalf mile distant before the boat struckthe water with Capt Coffin in her sternAlthough the buoy supported Tomeasily he found it no easy task to keepthe unconscious mans head above thesurface and when the boat reachedthem he was pulled from the water ina state of utter exhaustionAvery showed no signs of life andwhen the vessel was reached he wastaken to his berth where the old cap- itain gradually resuscitated him lornhaving changed his clothes in the meantime and regained the use of his limbsWhen he reached the stateroom hewas -hocked at his friends face Therewas a look then which comes bul onceon his tongneScott sit down said the old minorI can see by vour fact- what you readin miue

dying man drew forth afolded bit of paper whisperingIts yours and it means a fortuneto you Get me a pen and paper andthen write what I tell youHis request was soon complied withand with a faint voice he dictated-I John Avery being about to diegive my share in the gold mine discovered by my partner Dick Reed to thebearer Thomas Scott who has riskedhis life for mine twiceWhen this unique will was on

with a look of triumph on his evil faceThere were no witnesses and whatIs to prevent my being Mr Tom Scottand becoming a mine owner he muttered to himself I must have that paper if I have to kill him to get itOn the following day tho remains ofthe old miner were consigned to thedeep and as Tom saw the weightedcanvas disappear beneath the blue water his grief outweighed every othersentiment and drove all thoughts of hisinheritance from his head He hadgrown to love the ruggeu old man likea brother and it was the first tunc hehad been brought face to face withdeathThat night as he was about to

oviceA novice in cooking would considerthe souring of salad a misnomer butit is a thing easily accomplished evnwhen the salad is as fresh and sound asit is possible to have it The foolish oldSpanish philosopher whose much vaunted directions for a perfect salad arestill held up in a familiar proverb wouldcertainly have soured his salad Aspendthrift in vinegar would spoil anysiUad as certainly as would a miser inoil There need be no miserly use ofoil if the oil is sound and sweet Thebest French dressing for a salad callsfor three times as much oil as vinegarThe secret of success in salad lies ircarefully measuring and as carefullymixing the salad the dressing shoulibe a perfect cream and cling to thegreen leaves never sinking to the bottom of the bowl as it does if the leavesyre not properly drained or if there istoo much vinegar or if the vinegar isadded before the oil Careful saladmakers season the oil they use This ienot strictly necessary as experts candredge on the leaves just the propelamount of seasoning the moment afteipouring over the oil and by dextrouslytossing the leaves mix the seasoning ofsalt and pepper in the oil thai shouldthoroughly coat them A novice insalad ctiaking should mix in every salada ipoonful of oil a half Bait spoonful ctpepper and about half the amount olwhite pepper It takes about threesalad spoonfuls of oil for two heads oflettuce or a quart of any ether greenleaves A saladspoon is larger than atablespoon It takes five scant tablespoonfuls to equal three sal jdpeonfulsAfter the oil and seasoning have beenthoroughly and evenly mxed so thatno surplus is to be seen in the bottomof the bowl the vinegar cm be addedSprinkle it in and toss so as to have itall absorbed by the oil which coats theleaves About two thirds of a saladspoonful of vinegar is the properamount If the vinegar is not acidenough it will require mere to give theproper flavor but it is almost impossible if more is used to make proper dressing The surplus vinegar used insteaddi uniting with the oil on the leaveswill fall to the bottom of the bowl andcive the salad a crude sour taste different from the smooth perfect flavorof a perfect salad It is positively necessary to have a good vinegar The bestvinegar the writer has ever used wasmade of the juice of grapes prepared invinegar in the same w ay the juice of apples is made into eider vinegar Thebest salad vinegar is flavored with tarragon This may be done by leaving abunch of tarragon leaves in a quart bottle of vinegar for two or three weeksand then straining the vinegar into another bottle Tarragon vinegar may bepurchased already prepared but thebest imported vinegar of this kind is expensive There are other flavored vinegars those flavored with chives oreschalots or burnet are the best forsalads but none are so generally usedas tarragon vinegar Burnet is an herbwith a small pretty fern leaf havingthe flavor of cucumber which it imparts to the vinegar or salad in which itis used This herb is found growingwild in some parts of the countrythough it is not so often used here as itis in France and on the continent andit is rarelv seen in our markets thoughtarragon

which Elizapursued by a pack of barking mongrelscrosses the river carrying in her arms astuffed dollThe ieemaking machine has proved anenormous success At the Kidgewood operahouse where the ice machine played a fewevenings ago a frantic crowd fought its waythrough the doors At the firt performances the ice machine was kept in the background Several cakes were manufacturedbefore the performance and placed on thegreen baize river They were carefully sanded on the surface so that when Eliza madeher grand dash for liberty she would notturn undignified somersaults The ice machine however had been so largely advertised that yokels wanted to see it Theysat in their places after the curtain descended upon the solemn death of LittleEva and howled for the ice machine to comeout and show itself The stage managerand a couple of deck hands had to carry itdown to the footlights Then they turnedthe handle and amid uproarous applausethe machine produced a cake of real iceSince then a part has been written in theplay for the ice machine When the riverscene opens a couple of southern speculatorsare discovered experimenting with themachine They produce their ice and nothaving any
