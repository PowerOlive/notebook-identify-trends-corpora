So far as is known, nothingdefinite was decided upon at themeeting last week, and it is notknown whether the natural gas people will lay their own mains throughout the city, or will make another effort to take over the Paris gas plant.The present pipe service in the citywould ,be sufficient for natural gasand from the fact the purchase of theplant would save a prolonged delay inlaying new mains, it is considered agood move on the part of the Central Kentucky Company. If the tradecould be made it would save thisneedless delay and the citizens ofParis would be supplied with a cheaper product at a much earlier datethan was first expected.The laying of new mains wouldnecessitate the tearing up of thecity's streets and the citizens wouldsuffer to no small degree from thisinconvenience.

Warm water helps tobreak down the feed better, and it Induces a better circulation of blood,to the digestive tract than does coldwater. Breeding stock that gets les3feed has no surplus energy to spendin warming water, and if it Is givencold slop, it must use energy thatmight be put to far better use towarm It. In other words, it is cheapor to use natural fuel than to use thefuel inside of the pig's body by thebreaking down of food nutrients.One of the great difficulties alwaysencountered with breeding sows during the winter is to get them to drinfcsufficient water. They should drinka great deal of it, not alone becausethey need It for body functions, butalso that they will be kept satisfiedwithout eating so much dry feed as tomake them overfat Water fills without furnishing many nutrients.Under ordinary conditions, as soonas water begins to get real cold, hogsrefuse to drink much of it, and sothey require a larger ration of otherfeed before they are satisfied. If onthe other hand the water is warmedand is mixed in sufficient quantitywith their feed they will take it intotheir systems without the slightestobjections and will be much better offfor it.The feed bill will also be smaller atthe same time. Whether the slop iswarmed for fattening stock or not,we would certainly advise that it befor the breeding stock. Where theherd is small, it is often feasible towarm the water for slop in the house,but Jn case of a large herd one of thevarious feed cookers on the marketwould no doubt best be procured.Generous Meal.Possibly the most generous meal inthe world is at a railroad halt between St. Petersburg and Moscow.About midnight you walk into a hugehall spread with hot and cold meats,tea, vegetables, fish of all kinds to besampled, vodka at hand. Everybodywalks around and takes what hewishes at that moment. The trainsounds the departing note. The passengers walk out and say at the doorwhat they have eaten and drunk, andpay.

To have the"stomach of an ostrich is the synonym of incomparable digestive power."Yet," says a writer, "the wholething from beginning to end is naturefaking, pure and simple. As a matterof fact, the ostrich, if not a confirmeddyspeptic, has a most, delicate digestion. The successful feeding of ostriches in captivity requires constantcare.Norwegian Product.A product of Norway is wood flour,whichis made from sawdust and comesfrom clean spruce or pine Jogs whichare first freed from any particle ofbark.

Royal dynastiesin this commercial age are based uponthe dollar, and that same dollar comesfrom the pockets of the commoners,who, if managed properly, are only toowilling to pay well for the privilege ofa stable government.Thus it is that in the Balkans therulers who have been hurling theirlegions at the battle front of the Turkish army have needed an ever-increasingstore of millibns. The was ispractically over, but every moneylender in Europe has a fat sheaf ofroyal and governmental "I. O. U.'s"Money raised by taxes necessitatespopularity, and it is the present desire of the rulers of Greece, Servia,Bulgaria and Montenegro to be as popular as ever a man was. The samesituation is faced by the ruling familyof Roumania. And it is" in the cleverness of the Crown Princess Marie thatthe real ability of a woman in a tightpolitical situation is demonstrated.Roumania must be prepared to takethe field with many men and muchmoney. The people will vote thismoney if they love their sovereignsnot otherwise. The Roumanians are aproud lot, proud of the fact that theyare the direct descendants of the Romans who centuries ago were sent tothe territory to subjugate the landsnow included within the boundaries oftheir kingdom.The Balkans are for he most partruled by families from other countries, connections of the Hapsburgsand other royal lines. Naturally it hasbeen the task of the incumbents to"make good' in the eyes of the warlikeand independent natives. PrincessMarie went to Roumania as a bridefrom another part of Europe. She wasbeautiful, but then there are manyother beautiful ladies in the nation,which is famed for its beauties. "Outlanders" were not very popular in theCrown Princess Marie and Her Children. mountain states of southeastern Europe, but Princess Marie determinedto make herself liked.The pretty royal bride hit upon aclever scheme. She affected the native dress upon all occasions. Thiswas not hard,for the national costumeis one of the most picturesque in theworld.Then she had a picture taken thathas been circulated in millions amongthe subjects of the royal family. It isthe most popular picture post cardsouvenir in the land.When the children came PrinceCharles, Prince Nicholas and the littlePrincess Elizabeth Marie, lovinglycalled "Mignon" by the people, theywere photographed with their motherin the garb of Roumanian peasants.What was the result? Prom a small,weak nation, Roumania has grown toone of the real powers of easternEurope, due simply to this and othersimilar campaigns engineered by theroyal family to gain the liking of thepeople and hold it securely.Mad Dog by Parcel Post.Berkeley, Cal.

Stout opened Circuit inVersailles Monday and delivered astirring charge to the grand jury regarding vote buying. He served notice through the grand jurors to thecitizens and candidates for office inhis judicial district that all cases ofvote buying in the forthcoming primary election will be thoroughly investigated and vigorously prosecuted."I am going to use you as ameansof spreading this notice," said JudgeStout in addressing the jury. "Manifestly you have nothing to do with it,but I think it right and proper to callthe attention through you, not only ofWoodford county but of every countyin this judicial district to this matter."There are two classes of men whocommit this crimes in elections. Oneclass is the buyer and the other thesellers. Of the two classes I have infinitely more sympathy for the latterclass. Lots of times some poor fellowis unable to resist the temptation tosell his vote, and he is to be pitied.The man who secures and office by thebuying of votes is not the choice ofthe people, and is not fit to serve them.He is a receiver of stolen propertyand a thief. Such a man is not fit tohold an office.Judge Stout said that every manunder suspicion of being guilty of buying votes in the coming primary ineither, Woodford, Scott, Franklin orBourbon, would be investigated."If competent reports come to me ofvotes having been bought," said JudgeStout in substance, "special grandjuries will be impaneled immediatelyafter August 2. The vote sellers willgo free and the vote buyers will besent to the penitentiary if the jurorshave the backbone to do their dutv.This court is going after the buyer andnot the seller. The full plans cannotbe divulged at present, but I will saythis much that careful watch will bemade by good men, who will not be.known, and upon their report investigations will be made. The people aredemanding clean, free, untrammeledelections, and they are going to havethem, and this court will do its dutyin the mater."RELIGIOUSFirst Shipment of Spring Lambs.Caywood & McClintock will makethe first shipment offspring lambsfrom Bourbon counprSaturday night.The shipment tyfbe made L fromAusterlitz and will comprise 225head of fancy lambs, which willhave New York as their destination.The lambs cost 7 cents a pound.Caywood & McClintock shippedthis week several carloads of heavyhogs to the Cincinnati market thatcost them 8 cents a pound.

There she remains until the rest of the family return from the tomb.But as soon as they enter the housethey begin to revile her with mostabusive language, telling her that itis her fault that her winiana, or fate,has been stronger than that of herhusband, and that she is virtually thecause of his death. Then they stripher of her clothing, tearing off withviolence the ornaments from her earsand neck and arms; they give her acoarse cloth, a spoon with a brokenhandle and a dish with the foot broken off with which to eat; her hair isdisheveled and se is covered wit acoarse mat, and under that she remains all the day long.and can onlyleave it at night; and she may notspeak to anyone who goes into thehouse. She is not allowed to washher face and hands, butonly the tips ofher fingers.The Madagascar widow endures allthis sometimes a year, or at least foreight months, and even when this isover her time for mourning is notended for a considerable period.

"Nub" a Call.2 HeUos 137(St. Louis Globe Democrat.)The Cherokee tribe of North American Indians was in the days of longago a unique race in many essentialrespects, and they were an exclusiveand isolated people, being called themountaineers of North America bythe earliest white people who cameto know them. This great tribe at alltimes proved themselves well able tohold their own against any number ofconfederate tribes living north ofthem and with whom they at differenttimes, clashed in warfare. Taking allin all the Cherokees, when this continent was first visited by the whiteman, were the most numerous, themost powerful and the most advancedbody of Indians north of the RioGrande. vAnciently the Cherokees lived inwhat they called towns that is inneighborhoods or settlements consisting of a large common, field or farm,surrouded by the dwellings or tepeesof the families in the village separated from each other by miles of open,generally uninhabited, country devoted to natural game.The great tribe or nation was, inthe early days of its known history,divided in seven clans, each clan beingcomposed of persons of both sexes, related to each other on the maternalside, and comprising one great family the entire tribe thus consisted ofbut seven of these so-called families.Members of each clan or family wereforbidden by a strict law of the nationfrom marrying within the same clanunder penalty of death, the clan relationship being the first thing taughtto the young members of the tribe, andalways perfectly known to the individual himself. The children (a boy andgirl for example) born to a couple, thethe father of one clan and the motherof another, became members of themother's clan, when the girl grew upand was married, her children belonged to the same clan as herself. Whenthe man married the second time andhad children by both wives, membersof. separate clans, the youngsters werealways members of the clan of theirmother, although they were half brothers and sisters. iA stringent tribal regulation forbademarriage between blood relations onthe father's side within a certain degree, with as absolute severity as between members of the same clan. Itwas in this sthict manner the Cherokees avoided the disasterous resultthat always followed the habit or custom of inbreeding, and for this reason mostly they developed into a healthy, active and intelligent race of Indians. However, this great tribe owed itssuperority not only to the clan system of marriage and descent, as thehigh regard paid to the feminine portion of the race was another remarkable and beneficial feature of theirsuccess. The women of the tribe wereheld equal with the men in personalrights and considered far superior asrespected and principle of heredityand transmission of qualities, alwaysvitally important to' the Cherokees.This inflexible rule pertaining to marrige, requiring the infusion of newblood at every union, was the cause ofanother being added to the seventhen existing clans of the tribe.In one of the early years of the Sixteenth century a party of some fifteenor twenty warriors, members of theCherokee nation, reached the -vastwilderness known formerly as thedark and bloody ground, returningfrom a foray of revenge against a hostile tribe of the North.In the center of this section, an immense solitude far from the habitations of any body of red men, a regionrarely visited by members of any tribe,a tract upon which the braves wereloth to tread, this small band of warriors found bound at the foot of aholly tree, a little Indian girl, whosepresence at that place and in thatsituationgave the impression, that shehad been carried and left there as anintendedvictim or -sacrifice to satisfy the savage instinct of some superstitious parents or tribe. Her costumes were fine, but of a structure theCherokees had never seen nor ofwhich they had any knpwledge. Thelittle one was perfect of form and feature, although prostrated from terrorand exhaustion. When questionedshe replied in a language foreign toeach of the warriors, and who she'was and to what tribe of red men shebelonged was never ascertained.After unbinding and attending tothe wants of the child, the band helda council to decide what should bedone, and it was unanimously decidedthat the small gathering of braves, collectively representing and acting under the authority of the Cherokee nation, had no right to interfere with soevidently well considered and solemnan act of duty and worshipful devotionby some unknown people and by suchinterference burden the entire nationwith responsibility and expose it topossible danger. However, it was further decided that if any warrior present should of his own free will desireto preserve the child and personallysuffer the consequences he might doso, and the remainder of the smallcouncil would bear witness to the factin behalf of the nation.The leader of the troupe formallyand distinctly announced this decision, giving the order to continue thejourney liomeward, slowly arising tohis feet and adjusting his dress andweapons for travel, placing the littie girl on his shoulder, closely followed by the others, who took theirturn at carrying the newly found treasure. After many days of travel theparty finally reached the nation,where the little girl was adopted tothe tribe, grew to womanhood, married and had descendants.True to their vital principle of heredity and insomuch as new blood hadbeen introduced into the tribe, a newclan had to be and was created for thedescendants of the woman, who as agirl, had been adopted into the tribe.This clan, the eighth, was named theHoly clan, and later became perhapsthe most noted and numerous of thewhole.The eight clans, or entire tribe,were as a whole warlike and ever victorious, but never gave the challenge,though they never refused it; wereexclusive without being offensive, enterprising without being ruthless,brave without being cruel, and werethe only Indians who, of their own accord, gave to the white and theircivilization a hearty welcome in thedays when the red men were numerous and the white men few.Doing Their Sums."De wust thing about 'rithmetic,"said Uncle Eben, "is dat a whole lot o'folks git de idea dat any kin' o' figgerin' is all right if de kin finish wifa numbah dat has a dollah ma'k infront of it."Taking Moving Pictures in Jerusalem." (Christian Herald.)Nothing has caused more widespread interest in Jerusalem in recent.years as the work of the movies. Inorder to photograph all the famousscenes in preparing a film on "TheLife of Christ," many parts of thecity were visited, several expeditionshad to be made by caravan and themoving-picture people were everywhere conspicuous. Although the natives of the more ignorant classeswere sometimes resentful, the highofficials took the liveliest interest inthe work. It was common for the dignitaries of the church and state tovisit the studios or the scenes enacted and spend an entire day in watching the work. Among the most enthusiastic of the visitors were his excellency, Gen. Abdul Hamid Pasha, civilGovernor ad interin of Jerusalem andMilitary Governor or Palestine; theSecretary of Foreign Affairs, theChief Justice of the civil courts.17Union Meat MarketF. W.

The totalheld in pounds, isl,359,252,597. OnOctober 1, 1912, the first date whenthe report was made under the Cantrill law, the total held was 1,047,404,560 pounds, of which 35 per cent, wasKentucky tobacco.When Mr. Cantrill and SenatorBradley were passing the law throughCongress their argument for its existence was that it would provide aprice-fixing guide for the tobaccogrower. The manufacturer had thegovernment crop report to tell himthe condition .of the tobacco crop,they argued, and it was only fair tohave the Government issue a reportsemi-annually on the number oftobacco unmanufactured so that thegrower could set an idea how muchtobacco planting was needed and howmuch to charge. This argument wasaccepted and the law passed."The leaf tobacco reported on handApril 1, 1913," according to the Census Office,"includes 825,350,781 poundsfor which the 'marked weight' (theweight at the time it was placed in thewarehouse) is reported; and 533,901,816 pounds for which the actualweight is reported. The corresDond-ing amounts included in the total held ton October 1 last were 578,468,729 and468,935,831 pounds respectively. Allowance should be made for shrinkageon the amounts for which markedweight was reported to ascertain theexact weight."The dealers from whom the statistics were recorded are those who manufactured more than 50,000 pounds oftobacco, 250,000 cigars or 1,000,000cigarettes, or those who had on aoaverage more than 50,000 pounds ofleaf tobacco in stok at the nd of thefour quarters of the calendar years of1911 and 1912.
