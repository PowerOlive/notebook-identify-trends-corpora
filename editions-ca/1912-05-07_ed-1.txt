Carlyle.Forgetting Senate Bills.Are the standpatters in the Senategoing to "chloroform the tariff reduction bills that have been passed by theDemocratic House at this session ofCongress?The House passed the steel tariff billJanuary 29. and it emerged April 5from the Senate Finance committee,with an adverse report. Nothing muchhas been heard about it since. OnTebruary 21 the House passed the billto revise the chemical schedule. Thenext day this bill was sent to the Senate Finance committee, and there itst 11 rep ses. On March 19 the Houseoassed the excise income ;tax law,which proposed to shift a Dart of theburden of the ''government expensefrom the shoulders of the poor ontothose of the rich, and the Senate Finance committeee, to which that measure was reported, has taken no actionon it. The hi!J to remove the tax onsucar, which would relieve the common peoole of this nation of an annualburden of more than $100,000,000 ayear, passed the House along with theexcise income tax, and it, too. rests inthe Finance committee, which is controlled by the last remnants of theSenate "Old Guard." The wool .bill,which cassed the hojse on the first dayof April, was turned over to the sameSenate committee the next day andhere it still sleeps, apparently as farfrom action as ever. "The chairman of theSenate FinancePennsylvania, and the next rankingmemher of the committee is ShelbyCullom, of Indainapolis. Both ofthese Senators were rebuked at recentprimary elections in their states.These two men, and especially Pencommittee is Boise Penrose, otrose, have the word, just now, onwhat is to be done with these variousbills, all ot which were designed tocheck the trusts of this country, andall which constitute a fulfilment ofthe pledges made by the Democratswhen they sought election. In a nutshell, the people put the Democrats inpower on their specific promise to enact these measures into law. They didtheir work exactly as they promised,and now. having gone as far as theycculd, these Democrats have to standby and see a couple of thoroughly discredited standpatters nullify theirgear's work.Of course, there is yet time, but it iapretty . generally admitted aroundWashington that there is a well dennedscheme on foot among the standDatSenators to simply forget these bills.Just now the countrv is crpntlvwrought uo over these campaigns fordelegates to the national convention inJune, and it is !known that the reactionaries plan to take advantage ofthis situation to once more block theenactment of measures desiorned togive the people relief from the highcost of living.Day Trip to St. Louis.By leaving Paris on L. & N. train8 :20 a. m. direct connection is madewith the'.B. & O.

Receipt of a letter by aChicago man recently, a letter whichshould iave brought employment andhappiness, caused the man who received it to commit suicide. Thestrange story of how her husband, whohad long been out of work, took hislife upon the receipt of a letter whichmeant the offer of a job and futurecomfort is told by the suicide's widow."My husband, after being long despondent over sickness and his inability to obtain a position, in a momentof weakness took my bank book,which recorded a -small amount of deposit, and forged my name to a check,for $12. I know that he used themoney in an endeavor to find employment' and that he would have paid itback to me, but fate willed differently,"said the widow, sadly.i'I discovered the forgery accidentally when I went to the bank a fewdays later."I was ushered into the president'soffice and told him my story. I explained to him that my husband hadalways been hard working and honestand had never before committed an of-,fense of any kind before, but that hehad been despondent because of his inability to find work. The bankerseemed touched by my story and treated me with the utmost kindness."'I do not feel,' said the bank official, 'that this is a case for the courts,itseems that perhaps your husband hasbeen more or less a victim of circumstances, and I think that if he is givena chance he will be an honest manhenceforth. So strongly do I believethis that I will show your husbandthat every man's hand is not againsthim. I am going to have him call uppnme and I will give him a positioninthe bank as a porter, and if he doeswell I will make him a watchman. Iwil write a letter to him at once.'r "The bank president wrote a lettersimply asking my husband to comeand see him. I went out to do somework and did not return home untilevening. The letter had reached myJiusband in the afternoon at home. Isuppose that since the letter did notspeak of a position, and as my husband was conscious that he was guiltyof the forgery, he became crazed withthe thought, that his act -had been discovered at the bank and that the lettertelling him to call meant that he wouldsoon b In the clutches of the law."I suppose the terror of his position' drove him insane, for he went Intoa shed on the rear of our lot and killed Ihimself by hanging. The letter, takenout of the envelope, was in his coatpocket, a mute witness of the cause ofhis self-destruction. I found his bodylater in the evening when I went tothe shed and was almost crazed withgrief, the sudden changes from despairand fear to joy and then again to horror and anguish being more than Icould bear."The president of the bank has never ceased to reproach himself forwhat7he terms his negligence in notgiving a more complete explanationwhen he wrote the letter, and sincemy husband's sad death the kindlybank official has seen to it that I haveall the work at dressmaking that Ican do."YOUR ONE GREATRIG FURNITURECARPET, MATTING, STOVE, PORCH,and Lawn Swing Buying Opportunity!j-ThelGreatest" Money-Saving House-Furnishing Event in This City'sHistoryEvery Piece of Furniture, Carpet, Rug, Matting, Brassand Iron Beds at Actual Cost and Less.Sale Sensation of the Year!PrettyStrong, YouTRUESayYesmSAYS RINGS BELONG TO GIRLGiven In Token of Betrothal, She NeedNot Marry to Keep Them, Rulesa Pennsylvania Judge.Blairville, Pa.

Uallahan'.the last of the feudleaders of "Bloody Breathitt" wasshot down from ambush, at his storein Crockettsville Saturday morning byassassin concealed in the underbrushon the mountain side fronting thestore. Callahan was mortally wounded,-twosteel bullets taking ;effpct inhis body, one going through his leftljng.and another striking his left leg.The first report of the shooting indicated that Callahan was standing infront of his store openly exDosed tothe fires of his would-be-assassins, butreports indicate that he was standingdirectly in front of the window,through which the men concealed in theunderbusr1! fired. Evidently there wasmore than one in the party, and thetwo shots were fired simultaneously.Z Callahan was taken to WitherspoonCollege on Buckhorn, where an operation was performed upon him and itis said he stands an even chance for recovery. The shcoting'of Callahan is regardedas the opening "of hostilities betweenthe two feudal factions, following theassa- i'nation of Levi Johnscn and JohnDavidson in Breathitt county, somemonths ago near the home of the; Callahan clan. Davidson and Johnsonwere Identified with the Davidson-Dea-tontaction and the former wasjindictedin the Breathitt Circuit Court in connection with Hacker Combs, Tom Davidson and Jase Deaton, for the murder of John Abner. At their trial inthe Bourbon Circuit Court in December, 1910 the men were acuittebd.At this trial Callahan took an activepart in the prosecution of the accused,and was appointed a .special bailiff togo to Vinziniajand secureBill Sidham.whose testimony bearing on the casewas regarded as most important tothe Commonwealth. The assassination of Johnson and Davidson was thefirst outbreak of the old trouole sincethe trialof those accused of the murder'of Abner, who was identified withthe Hargis Callahan faction, and theattempt on the life, of Callahan followed the killing of the two men.Of the quartet who were tried herein December 1910, only one survives,that being Tom Davidson, HackerCombs, dying in Jackson. Jase Deatonbeing shot to death by Anse White,while John Davidson was assassinated.Callahan was indicted in the Breathiitt Circuit Court in connection withothers for'the murder of James Cockrell in 1905.:andin October, 1908, theindictments were dismissed, followingthe trialof Judge' James Hargis, whowas acquitted by a Scott Cocunty juryin May. 1907.

Hinton,one of the elders of the congregation,in a few appropriate sentences-, introduced Mr. Ellis to the waiting people,though he was not an entire stranger,having preached here on one or two previous occasions, and had also attendedthe banquets given to Elder Carey E.Morgan during his pastorate.After a few preliminary remarks, Mr.Ellis preached an excellent sermon onthe power of the Christian religion, thetext, "For I Determined 'Not to KnowAnything Among You, Save JesusChrist, and Him Crucified." I Cor. chapter 2, verse 2.A special musical program had beenprepared b the choir director, Prof. A.H. Morehead.
