EEPUBLICMTariManagers Are Hopefulthe-Lengthy- Debate3ifThatIn the Senate WilL Be Ended by the End- of the Week The Bouse TVill Continueits Policy of Adjournment FromMonday Until ThursdayWashington June 28 The republican tariff managers are still hopefulthat the present may prove to be thelast week of the tariff debate in thesenate All the schedules have beengone over once leaving nothing to bedone but to consider the paragraphs inthe various schedules which have beenpassed when reached in their regularorder because of differences of opinionamong the republicans themselvesMany of these differences have beenadjusted in the republican ranks butthe democrats will naturally take advantage of their knowledge of the feeling existing among their opponents todebate some of the questions at lengthIt is understood now that coal leatherhides and lead ore will each be vigorously discussed as will also the questions though more briefly of reciprocity the treatment of trusts and thedisposition of the Hawaiian reciprocity treatyIn view of the determination of thedemocrats to exploit all these questions and others as well it would seemimpossible to conclnde the senateswork on the bill before the end of theweek and it is more than probablethat the final work will be reservedfor the following weekThe house will continue this weekits policy of adjournment from Mondayuntil Thursday After that its coursewill depend upon the action of thesenate If by any chance a voteshould be had on the tariff bill Wednesday or Thursday the house probably will remain in session to receivethe bill disagree to the senate amendments and appoint conferees Otherwise an adjournment will be had fromThursday to MondayCharles DeKay United States consul-generalat Berlin in a report to thestate department calls attention to thefact that German bicycle makersare deeply concerned at the nowvery large and growing competitionof American machines The leagueof industrials at Bochum an important manufacturing center has takenup the matter and a memorial tothe German government calls attention to the fact that this great industry is in imminent peril owing to therivalry of American bicycle manufacturers They complain that theUnited States levies a dutv on foreignmade wheels of about 14 2S whilethe German duty being only S571 on100 kilograms only from 71 to 95 centsduty falls on the American wheel Onthese and other grounds the aid of theGerman government is asked in behaliof the home industryWashington June 2S The republican tariff managers are very hopefulof being able to complete the consideration of the tariff bill in the senateby next Wednesday night a resultwhich would bring the end in the senate within the present month Theyare led to this conclusion because therepublicans have adjusted most oftheir differences and see their wavclear to the settlement of others Thedemocratic leaders do not concede thepossibility of so early a conclusionThey generally

Walton did him the honor to-say Ah never did like you but Ahdo think those clothes wuhse than theothers This was rather hard because as the spring came on Lambertslot at the barracks was not as

toArmand Vire who has made numerousresearches on the subject of cave-dwellinganimals notably in the Jura districtThe curator of the museum and about50 guests were present at the inauguration of the laboratory Access isgained to the catacombs by a numberof stone steps which lead about 12meters down until the principal roomof the laboratory is reached a curiousround chamber the roof of which issupported in the center by an enormouscolumn of stone On all sides are stonetables on which are huge bottles andreservoirs continually supplied withfresh water in which are dozens of tritons

thefarm of Capt Will Burris on CaneRidge in Bourbon county The gravehas never been marked save with apiece of limestone rock and time hasoonieraiea anyinHunpLiuuo wmw iajhave been placed by friends in remembrance on the stone The body of Edward Boone was consigned to a gravemade bv his companions under abuckeye tree on the banks of Boonescreek which sometimes covers thegrave after heavy rains in the springAfter interring Boone his f rieuds placeda limestone rock at the head of thegrave and then carved on the buckeyetree the single word Boone which isyet discernable to a visitor to the graveIt is related that Edward Boone wasshot and killed by Indians while he wasseated in this tree watching for buffaloesto come to a springwhich bubbled fromthe ground just a few feet distant fromthe buckeye tree The trace made bvdroves of buffaloes is to this day clearlydefined near this neglected grave andwith little difficulty may be followedfor several miles It is evidently a portion of the trace which extends fromClark county through Bourbon toStamping Ground in Scott county socalled from the fact that the latter section was the stamping ground for buffaloes NNear the Boone grave is also quite anextensive cave which was doubtless frequented by the Boones and their companions when they hunted bear and deerin the famous canebrakes on Cane Ridgeor camped while traveling from the fortat Boonesboro to Blue Lick Springs Itis indeed fitting that Bourbon countybeing the scene of so many incidents inthe lives of the Boones should be the lastresting place of so noted a pioneer but itis alas a lack of respect that the graveshould be permitted to remain overgrown forgotten and neglected It issuggested that the grave be appropriately marked by order of the Governor orthat the remains

has always seemed tostep in just at the rig ht moment an prevent itOne easel can call to mind every faitas plain now as when it happenedwhich is getting- on for 15 years ag oneither no more nor no less but thatsno doubt because it concerned my ownself more than it did any o the othersYoud like to hear the story Wellir there isnt over much doin5 justnow an as your train isnt due for halfan hour or so I dont mind tellin itAt the time I speak of I hadnt beennpopinted signalman at the old junctiontlown yonder jerking- his thumb in adirection over his left shoulder morethan a few months Its been pulleddown now an a bigger box put upbut in those days there was just asmuch work to do and not so muchroom to do it inI was on day turn that week an asI walked down the line a bit afore sevenin the mornin the sun shinin brightly an the birds twitterin an hoppinabout from bush to bush I couldnthell thinkin how much nicer an pleasanter it was than bein on nights wiuothin but the screech of a locomotive every now an again or maybe anoccasional fog signal to keep you company during the long dark hoursfornin Joe says I when I got tothe box to my mate whod been onflurin the night Nice day

a goods train callin at every station if required sir to take forwardthis mornin Thats about all I-thinkWell Joe stayed in the box talkinan gossipin to me in a friendly sort oway for about half an hour as we usually did whichever of us happened tobe just goin off duty an then he slungbis bag over his shoulder an went offhome to get his breakfast an bit o well-arned rest leavin me alone for anfgr other- day in charge o the old cabinIt was a pretty busy box an theremuch time hangin on yourliands so to speak but what bit theresvas I generally spent in polishin npthe big levers o steel an

seven or eightyears Wed never had but one childlittle Nelly She was just five an itwould have done your heart good to-see her wi her Avinsome ways and herprattlin bab3r talkAs for Jenny an me we just idolizedher an nothin less Nothin was tootrood for her an when she was dressedup in her best little frock on a Sunday we were that proud of her wedidnt think there was another girl likeour Nelly in the whole wide worldMany a time have I gone wiout tobaccofor a Aveek in order that she mighthave her new pair o slippers or newpinafore a bit soonerWe used to call her our little bit csunshine an Im sure a better nameIt would have been hard to find for sheseemed to light up the house runninin an out in her play just like a gleamo sun does Every mornin when Iwent off down to the box after kissingtheiu both shed stand at the doorlioldin on to her mothersgownwrne little hand wavin the other in theair an callin out after me Dooclby dada dear till I was out o hearinme turnin round every few yards anmy hand to her in returnWell on tlus particular morninwent on much the same asusual an I was kept prdtty hard attill about 12 oclock xullin back thelevers an enterin np in my book thetiroes o the trains as they passedAfter that time I had a bit o slacktill the one oclock down express wassignaled an then Nelly would bringmy dinner down an stay playin about2in the box till Id eaten itthat x always looitea iorwara to wrmore interest than any other unlessit ywcre Icnoekin off time an whenever l7ix Treacher was anythin like fineI wassure noi to be disappointedAt first Jennv

tfe allright I answered Wont j ou Selly eafchin Tier up in my armsankissin herYes me all right lisped Nelly inher pretty baby talk nodding her little head wisely aji makin us bothlaugh at her earnestnessAfter that she came regularly an Iused to look out for hertoddlin downthe footpath at the side o the linerId cautioned her never to go off itan as she was a sharp little thing shesoon understood why wi my dinnerbasket hung over her arm as proudan pleased as possible to think thatshe was takin her dad his dinnerThen when Id taken it out o thebasket wi a kiss for porterage shedplay round an look wi big wonderineyes at the great Brass handles an thetelegraph needles till Id finished whenshed start back home wi the emptybasket it wasnt more than a quarterof amile an Id watch her little figuregrowin smaller in the distance wif eelins just as proud as her ownThis had gone on for some time noiyan Jenny had quite forgotten her fearsThe express was late that day anI remember wonderin what could havedelayed it as it was usually signaledpunctual to the minute At last liowever I got the ring on the bell thattold me it was approachin an notlong after I heard its rumblin sometwo or three miles away After Idpulled my levers over an set the siguals off for it to run into the station Iwent to the side o the cabin an lookedout o the windowThe first thing that caught my attention was a man about 100 yardsoff runnin all his might towardsme wavin his hands an pointin ina very excited manner somewhereWhats up now thought I but Icouldnt make head or tail of his gesticulatin so I waited wi some impatience for him to get nearer an thenI saw that it was one o the platelayers belongin to the gang that wasworkin near bySwitch the express on to the loopJim quick he gasped The bridgehas fallen inBefore I go any further let me explain the position o things a bitMy box was a junction as Ive toldyou To the south was the main linefrom London which there split in twoone comin through the station herean the other missin it and goin roundthe loop as we call it On the station line about 300 yards past the junction round a bit of a curve was alarge trestle bridge over the river Itwas gettin considerably old an theyhad been talkin about renewin it forsome time past but somehow themonths had drifted by an no starthad been made on the work yetInstantly I guessed what had happened The rains durin the last weekor two had been very heavy an theriver was in consequence flooded anrunnin very strong an the unusualweight an rush o water had loosenedthe old an rotten supports o thebridge which never ought to have beenallowed to get in such a condition tillit had suddenly come topplin over intothe seethin an boilin flood belowFor a moment I was staggered bythe suddenness o the news but thenI braced myself together an saw thatwhat the had shouted was theonly thing to doIt was impossible to pull the expressup The driver had seen the signalsoff an knowin that he was behindtime was beltin along as fast as hisengine could go It was afore thesedays o trains fitted from end to endwi continuous brakes thatll bring atrain to a stand in 50 yards an I couldsee that unless I switched it on to theloop itd go dashin along an into theriver on top o the ill fated bridgeI felt a kind o dizziness come overme as I thought o all them passengersa sittin in the carriages comfortablyreadin or lookin out at the green anyellow fields as they passed being sentwiout a word o warnin to destruction an sprang across to pull the leversback As I did so I thought o littleNelly a comin down the loop wi mydinner an how surprised shed be tosee the great express ruohin towardsher an involuntarily 1 east a glanceout o the window in the direction Iknew shed be cominAye tljere was the little figure Iloved so well sure enough but whatwas that that made my heart growsuddenly cold wiin me an sent theblood surgin up to my temples till mybrain felt on fire Passin my handacross my eyes I looked again surelyI must be mistakenNo It was no delusion there wasmy little girl walkin in the four foota thing shed never done afore to myknowledge light in the track o theadvancin express She had got thebasket in one hand an was holdinher little hat up in the airwi the otheran I almost fancied I could see thelaugh o childisherleeon her faceit v - i rvvasShe watched the bright ribbon flutterin in the breezeNelly Nelly I shouted desperately but she evident- didnt hear forshe took no noticeA sickenin forebodin oill came overme an I stood wi my hand on thelever irresoluteHas it ever struck you sir what alot o things can pass through yourbrain in the space o half a minuteIt struck me for the first time thena whole series o thoughts seemed toilood over me in that terrible few secondsJf I pulled the lever back it meantalmost certain death to Nellv chub-This was the one little bit o the dayJ by rosy cheeked little Nelly the darlin o her mothers heart the

which took place alt insideo lialf a minute will never be wifoed offray memorySwitch her over -you fool yelledthe plate layer who had now got closenp to the box but then he too caughtsight of Nelly an was silent for perhaps he too had got a little girl athomeHis shout did not rouse me howeverfor wicked thoughts filled my brainWho could say wi any certainty whatwas the reason if 1 didnt turn thecourse o the train Most likely itwould be supposed that the shock Iiaddazed me an rendered me incapableo actin promptly as had been the casewi so many men afore me Whyshoiildnt I Jet the express go on unchecked an save NellvThank God though the horribletemptation wasnt for long Iwas onebut what was I compared wi all thevast host o wives an daughters anhusbands an fathers that would bethrown into sorrow an mournin ifany accident happened to that trainI should be branded ever after with thecurse o murder an worse than murderNo I would do my duty at allhazards an the big drops o sweatdropped from my forehead as I thoughto the sin Id been very near conimittinNelly Nelly I shouted through thewindow as loud as my parched throatwould let me lie down lie down anI pointed between the rails -then wione brief prayer that came right fromthe bottom o mv heart I flung thehandle back only just in timeI heard the points come over theengine almost strikin them as theydid so but just swervin in time to geton theloop an then I knew no niorefor my senses were mercifully takenaway an I fell to the floor of the cabinin a dead swoonWhen I came to again I was Ijinin my own room at home wi Jennybendin over me an passin her handover my hot browNelly I murmured shudderinlyexpectin to be greeted wi a burst osobsTo my surprise however Jenny wentaway an in a few seconds durinwhich I lay in a

THE GIRLShe Is PromiHert Much 1- the Worldlint Given LittleOne of the problems of the day is thegirl of the future or rather the futureof the girl for certainly she is in atransition stage and what will be herdevelopments at the beginning of thecentury it is impossible to predict Itmust be acknowledged that the outlookwhich a decade ago promised so muchhas been most disappointing As ayoung business woman aptly expressedthe situation the other day The barriers have undoubtedly bee removedbut there are no end of stumblingblocks which are just as bad if notworseAll careers are open but it is almostimpossible to adopt anj of them withany chance of sucecss for a variety ofcauses In the first place the characteristics which make a man successfulhandicap a woman To be shrewd andpushing is not attractive and bold energy is looked upon with suspicion asbeing akin to the above objectionablequalities Another almost insuperableobstacle is the want of faith that eventheir well wishers have in their performances How few would trust awoman to take the responsibility of acritical illness to erect an importantbuilding to argue an involved case oflaw It will take a number of generations to overcome the prejudice whichis so universal not of the world at largeagainst the idea of a woman enteringthe profession but of individuals whoare unwilling to employ her in any ofthese capacitiesThen comes another question Theseprofessions are overcrowded as it isNow then can they support the greatinflux of new aspirants How can themen with the best intentions afford tobe generous and just to women whenthey usurp for as possession is ninetenths of the law it is natural that theyshould consider it usurpation theirprivilegesAs long as women are not consideredas competent the question resolves itself into the survival of the fittestwhich is comparatively simple just nowfor up to the present time there is practically no competitionTruly as the young woman- saidThere are to be sure no longer anybarriers but the stumbling blocks aremany and discouragingIn the meanwhile what is to becomeof our daughters Ay ho nave no independent means Marriage solves thedifficulty for some but by

the brookWhere the minnows love to playBeside the mill with its water wheelAnd the pond so dark and deepThen up to the tavern and village storeAnd the church where the dead He asleep-You would never think that the countryroad- Fr6m the hill to the store could beSo long to a boy with an errand to doAnd another boy to seeYou can never dream how short it isFrom the farm to the frozen pondNor how very much farther it always isTo the schoolhouse just beyondOh the country road at the farther endIt runs up hill and downAway from the woods and the ripplingbrookTo the toiling rushing townBut best of it all when youre tired andsickOf the weary haunts of menIf you follow it back it will lead you homeTo the woods and fields againGussie Packard Du Bois in St NicholasIMPROVED ROAD MAKINGAnInteresting Interview Tv itli theSeox etary of AgricultureThe dmportanoe of good roads is recognized by all and so is the expensenecessary to produce them consideredof equal significance Upon the subject William E Curtis in the ChicagoRecord says Secretary Wilson hasgiven directions to Gen Hoy Stonechief of the bureau of good roads atthe department of agriculture to construct a sample steel roadway at themost convenient location he can findat the Nashville exposition where itmay be seen and studied by the visitors who will attend during the summer Secretary Wilson thinks thesteel trackway for wagons is the easiest solution of the good roads problem particularly in the west wherestone and gTavel are scarce and thesoil is deep and stickyNo road material promises so muchhope to the western farmers as the flatbars of steel at he present cost ofmanufacture said the secretaryand I propose to have sample roadsbuilt not only at the Nashville exposition but at differdnt pointsthroughout the country where theywill afford practical object lessons tocounty commissioners and other officials having- the highways undertheir charge The steel manufacturersare taking hold of the matter withrtSfcs P6t illHON JAMES WILSONSecretary Department of Agriculturemuch interest and are making experiments on their own account whichhave already brought out valuablesuggestions as to the details of construction The Cambria Iron companyof Johnstown Pa has joined heartilyin the work of the department and iscooperating in the development ofour plans The result has been thatvery promising designs and methodsof construction have been evolvedsufficient at least for experimentalconstruction and the Cambria company will soon be prepared to furnishthe trackway for experiments or forlarger useThe advantage of the steel roadsin the reduction cf the pull requiredto move a load from an average of40 pounds per ton on macadam roadto eight pounds on the steel track issufficient to overcome many objections continued the secretary butin fact the objections to steel roadshave mainly disappeared under thepresent investigations The obstacleof original expense is overcome bythe reduced price of material and theanticipated high cost of maintenanceavoided by doing away entirely withwood in the constructionThe danger of horses slixDping on therail in going up and down hill is metby indenting the rails used on gradessufficiently to catch the calks of theshoes without roughing the tread forwheelsThe difficulty of low joints is metby making the joint stronger than anyether part of the track and the danger of forming a rut alongside therail is overcome by making every railjoint serwe as a remount for wheelsThe form of aail proposed is an inverted trough -with a slightlj raisedbead on the inside The rail is imbedded in gravel laid in a trenchwhich is well drained A little gravelis spread between the rails for thehorse path The rails are tied together at the ends and an the middleThe present design is for an eightinch tread seven sixteenths of aninch thickIn addition to the steel road an-other recent departure is in the direction of building object roads atagricultural colleges and experimentstations continued the secretaryhi accordance with the provisionmade by congress for aiding those institutions in disseminating information on the subject of road buildingCooperation has now been establishedby the director of roads under whichthe manufacturers of road machineryfurnish the necessary plant free ofcharge the county or city authoritiesprovide the

skilledoperators for the machines In thismanner a very slight outlay of publicfunds accomplishes a large amount ofinstructive work The work will begin at the New Jersey agricultural college at New Brunswick where a fundof about 3000 will be provided by thelocal authorities and at Geneva N Ywhere contributions have been madeby the city the experiment station andprivate individuals amounting to about7000In sections where stone is veryscarce said Secretary Wilson as incentral Illinois experiments are being made f or the construction of brickroads At Monmouth a road has beenmade of a single course of vitrifiedbrick set on edge laid on sand sevenfeet wide between curbs of oak plankand borders of broken stone to a distance of two feet on each side Thisroad has not been in use long enoughto be fully tested but has given a veryfavorable impression a the outset Ithas been recommended that an experiment be made with brick trackwaysfor wheels and gravel between for thetread of horses and it is quite possible that steel trackways may be profitably substituted for brickGravel roads costless than macadamand vary from 1000 to 2000 permile The seven foot brick road atMonmouth 111 cost 90 cents per running foot or 4750 per mile The eightfoot brick roads at Cleveland rangefrom 8000 to 13000 per mile but thisincluded heavy grading Material forsteel roads of the heaviest class of present design cost in small quantity about3500 per mile The amount of material however is less than 100 tons permile and if the present prices of steelshould be maintained material for longlines of road could be furnished forabout 2000 per mile The lighter classof steel rails for ordinary country roadsneed not exceed 50 tons per mile andneed not cost much over 1000 per mileThe cost of grading and track layingwill be additional but that need not beheavy on the western prairies for therails are all prepared to be bolted togetherCOOPERATION PAYSA Wisconsin Dairyman Points OutSome of Its Advantagesits predominating simplicity No business enterprise can meet with successwithout a complete understanding ofits details by the promoters In the cooperative system in vogue to day themonthly statement issued shows toeach and every patron the part he hasenacted to accomplish the given wholeHe sees just what he has done and whatit has benefited him in dollars andcents He sees just what his employeshave accomplished and sees just whatthey receive for the same He knowsthe value of his milk product for themonth in point of test He knows thetest is true unbiased and he questionsit not His weights are actual Hehas fiill confidence and pride in the enterprise and realizes that he himself isa part of the corporate body withrights unquestioned dn the other handiii the ease of the noncooperative creamery the patron is in no va3r consultedas to the management of its affairsHe has no voice in the selection of itsofficers If he questions the accuracyof his weights or tests or insinuatesthat the price for his product is lessthan he reasonably supposes it shouldbe he is trespassing upon dangerousgroundsHe has no riffht to an in-sight of the working of its affairs Heis simpty expected to be a patron whoseduty is merely to furnish the materialfrom which others are to make profitsThe marked success of the cooperative creamery is noticeable in almost every locality in which it has beenestablished It almost invariably increases the area of its territory and supplants all other systems its honestopen simple methods winning the admiration of all observers In my county where five years ago the cooperativesystem was unknown there are to dayin successful operation 16 creameriesaveraging in receipts 5000 to 20000pounds of milk per day and in the summer months some of them reachingover 30000 Almost every one of thesefactories supplanted other systems andit is a noticeable fact that in nearlyevery instance the same territory underthe cooperative system has largely increased and in man cases doubled itsproduct owing 1o the popularity of thesystem and the unshaken confidence ofthe producers I predict for the system a successful future H S Bell inOrange Judd
