VENTILATE CABS.
Why has not the rule for ventila
tion of country cars been, enforced
rigidly?
Even in this mild weather many
earn, both interurban and city, have
been, running without a window open.
Left to their own designs nine
tealhs of the patrons of cars never
-would open a window after the first
of October. Their influence against
compliance with the order, especially
when there is a cool breeze, tends
perhaps to make car crews overlook
thd'Shutting" of windows which "were
opened at the the beginning of the
rrai.
No'-car' should be permitted to op
erate without the minimum required
ventilation. If the company cannot
tlraugh orders keep its cars venti
lated, detectives should be put on the
rS by the Health Service and the
xttla. enforced.

GEKMAN PROPAGANDISTS BUSY
m AMERICA.
Government agents see evidences
that the German propaganda machin
ery in the United States is being put
in working order again to promote
sentiment of leniency toward Ger
many in peace terms. Consequently
Department Justice officials haVe
warned that the public sh6uld rejf
main watchful against resumption of.
organized propaganda by interests
formerly actively pro-German and for
the past year passive.
Concerted movement is apparent,
officials say, in utterances of many
individuals, a few organizations for
merly active for German interests
and some newspapers. There is no
organized leadership, it is believed,
but local interests have taken their
cue from official pleas from Germany
for leniency in armistice and final
peace terms.
The interests of the Government
agents combatting enemy propaganda
at this time is not to suppress free
expression of opinion, it is explained,
but to fight any concrete propagan
dists whose purpose would be to con
found the authorized spokesmen of
the nation in forthcoming peace .ne
gotiations. Officials say during the
reconstruction period, there may be
considerable danger from enemy
propaganda working to make the na
tion forget Germany's course during
the war. :
Illustrating the attitude that the
war and its dangers are not yet over,
it is stated that Department of Jus
tice agencies have ordered the intern
ment of some Germans since the arm
istice was signed.
Official reports show German rep
resentatives' in various parts of the
world still actively engaged in
spreading propaganda to create and
enhance feeling of hostility toward
the United States and Allied coun
tries. Eckhardt, the notorious Ger
man Ambassador at Mexico Gity,
again is reported doing his utmost to
make Mexico hostile to the United
States and is able to have misleading
articles published in the semi-official
Mexican papers. Recently he had
published throughout Mexico that
the German arjmy had not been de
feated and that the German navy was
still fighting the Allied navies.

UNCLE SAM TURNS MODISTE
Gen. Pershing has requested the
War Department to consummate ar
rangements for -the issue of equip
ment to nurses and female employes
to the United States army in France
on the same basis that governs the
distribution of clothing to soldiers,
says Leslie's. Women connected with
the American Expeditionary Porces
who receive pay less than $75 a
month are to get their clothing free.
Those who earn ?75 a month or more
will be classed with army officers 'and
permitted to purchase wearing ap
parel at cost. The sound judgment
back of this arrangement is obvious.
The women who have volunteered for
army work are important factors in
the success of the war. They, have
sacrificed all thought of comfort- dr
personal interests, and are entitled to-
all the consideration shown to the
men in thetrenches.
, From this time an the Germans
will not be permitted to have pock
ets on their front nTrancer-
