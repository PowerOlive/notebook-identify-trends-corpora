Thestreets of Paris wore somewhat of anold time aspect yesterday when trucksand wagons, heavily laden with theweed that soothes and solaces, passed on their way to the receivingpoints at the Bourbon and Independent Warehouses, on South Mainstreet. At the warehouses all wasorderly and everything was done inapple pie order. As soon as a loadof tobacco had been placed in thehouse, passed on and graded by thegraders, S. Kenney Nichols and C. S.Patterson, the owner received hisvoucher payable at one of the Parisbanks, and gave way for another.Twenty-five wagons will be unloadedand graded each day, according tothe present program.For several months farmers andgrowers have been anticipating theopening of the local houses, and thebusiness men of the city and countyare jubilant over the prospect of returning prosperity with the circulation of money long tied up. In barnsthroughout the county tobacco menwill be busy for weeks getting theweed ready for deliyery. Deliverieswill continue at the Paris houses until enough of the weed has beenbrought in to keep the redryers busy.Each grower will be notified when tohaul his crop to the houses. Morethan ninety per cent of the tobaccocrop in Bourbon county has beenstripped.The News has received many inquiries in regard to the new systemof handling burley tobacco. The system as briefly explained by a memberof the Association, is as follows:"As the tobacco is received at thewarehouse from the member growers, it is first graded, each separategrade being placed in a separatebasket, as under the old system, andthe baskets of each grower kept together. The official grader of theassociation marks the grade on thebasket ticket, and the baskets arethen trucked to the scales."As each grower's lot of baskets isweighed, weigher marks the weighton the basket tickets and coupons.The weigher's coupons are detachedby him from the basket ticket, eachgrower's coupons being kept together and these coupons are passedto the warehouseman or bookkeeper."The warehouseman will then issuea participation certificate showingthe amount of tobacco delivered bythe grower. A duplicate of this participation certificate is delivered tothe member grower, but the amountof the draft issued is omitted on theduplicate. A triplicate copy of theparticipation certificate must bekept at the receiving warehouse."When the participation certificateis made out, a draft drawn on theBurley Tobacco Growers' Cooperative Association is issued to themember grower in an amount determined by the' quantity and quality of his crop."At the end of each day the clerical-force of the receiving warehousewill make out a daily report of receipts and another showing the"ales of tobacco made during the.aay."A daily report also is made showing deliveries of tobacco made during the day to redrying plants."When tobacco is sent to thp to.j dryer or to the green prizery stillciuutuer report is made daily to themam office at Lexington"AunnmpH nn ,v ,w- , V"Kjicim slock leader tor.,. r -u ib iiicuiiuuimu oyeach receiving warehouse nn chofor each grade of tobacco.

We hereby ask you toreconsider your decision, as you 'are partly thwarting the very purpose of the Exhibition, viz: To educate the people in self-preservation. You assert ,hat thousands ofpeople die yearly from preventable disease, to which statement we heartily agree, andbecause we agree with your splendid ideas we desire to help in this by showing thepeople of Kentucky what Chiropractice will do to demonstrate its great value as a preventive of disease.We are not unmindful of the fact that you have never made an unbiased investigation of Chiropractic and are therefore not in a position to judge of its merits. Youhave invited the people of the great State of Kentucky to attend this Health Exhibition with the avowed purpose of teaching them Health Lessons. Chiropractic is proving to be the greatest boon to humanity that has ever been discovered; then whyshould you discriminate against Chiropractors and not allow the people to become acquainted with what they are doing for suffering humanity? The people of Kentuckyare intelligent and are fully competent to judge for themselves what they want. Theyhave never before had such an opportunity of getting Chiropractic FACTS as thisExhibition offers. Those who attend will have their minds centered on HEALTHPROBLEMS and we should not be discriminated against and the people deprived ofthe knowledge of Chiropractic. Their information comes largely from derogatorystatements of medical men who are eitheryignorant of or are prejudiced against Chiropractic. We stand ready to give you hundreds of names of people prominent in Kentucky and others of national prominence who have taken Chiropractic Adjustmentsand thus recovered their health after they had been pronounced incurable by medicalmen. Chirapractors are by spinal adjustment removing the cause of practically every-known disease. Ninety per cent of the Chiropractor's patients come to him after afruitless search of health, and if you will take the trouble to investigate you will findthat only a few of them meet with disappointment, Pain and disease result from impinged nerves. You are aware of the fact that 31 pairs of nerves leave the spinalcord through openings between the bones of the spinal column. These perves extendto and supply all the organs of the body with the life principle which is generated ifcthe brain. Chiropractors have dif covered that the bony segments of the spine can byjolts, falls, strains, etc., be thrown out of proper relationship with each other, andwhen they are put of their normal position they exert pressure upon the nerves. Thispressure interferes with the transmission of nerve impulse and the organ to whichthe nerve leads gets LESS than its portion of nerve current. RESULT: Pain, disease and in many cases paralysis or even death.The science of Chiropractic is based on this proven FACT and the work of theChiropractor is to locate these pinched nerves and to remove the pressure by replacing the bones of the spine to their normal position. It is needless to say according tothis theory that disease cannot long remain in an organ that is receiving its portionof this health-giving energy. Chiropractic was discovered twenty-five years ago andis being practiced with gratifying results in every State in the Union. Millions ofpeople are taking adjustments and getting well and keeping well. HOW TO KEEPWELL is the keynote of the National Health Exhibition, to in making the request forthe privilege of an exhibit we wanted to assist you in this noble work of bringinghealth, and thereby happiness, to the people of this great State. Many people do notknow what Chiropractic is or what we claim for it. It is often mistaken for some kindof a "Religion" or "Faith-Cure." In view of the FACT that Chiropractic is doing somuch to eradicate disease, even after every other known treatment has failed, we askyou to reconsider your former decision and allow us an exhibit in the Health Show sothat the people of Kentucky may have reliable information on this great health sub-,ject.Kindly give us an immediate reply, as the time is short in which to make necessary arrangements for exhibit.KENTUCKY ASSOCIATION OF CHIROPRACTORS.. To the Legislature and Citizens of Kentucky :The State Board of Health of Kentucky has invited the Osteopaths Dentists' and Optometrists to take part in the National Health Exhibition to be held in Louisville Feb. lst-9th. Chiropractic was legalized in Kentucky in 1920. The Representatives of the people in Frankfort passed this law after repeated assurances by the StateBoard of Health that Chiropractors would receive a square deal at the hands of theState Board. Now the said Board has refused the Chiropractors of Kentucky a placeof exhibit in the Health Exhibition, thus depriving the citizens of Kentucky of an opportunity to, learn of this wonderful health-giving science.If this is not an unwarranted, unpardonable DISCRIMINATION against anoble and humanitarian profession, w'hat is it? We ask the citizens of Kentucky andthe Representatives who make our laws to investigate. Is the State Board of Healthsubject to the laws or are they above the law? We appeal to the good people of Kentucky, with your reputation for fairness and impartiality, not .to permit longer oneprofession to CRUSH another through unfair dealing and DISCRIMINATION. Wemake this appeal in behalf of suffering humanity and because the Chiropractic profession is entitled to JUSTICE.Millions of lives and millions of dollars were given in order to crush autocracyin the late war. Thousands of disabled soldiers .in the United States are in need ofChiropractic adjustments and cannot get them on account of the autocracy of themedical profession.. , By what right does medical autocracy try to throttle and crushall competition in, this, our own fair land? We appeal to the good people of Kentucky and to the Legislature now in session at Frankfort for relief from such discrimination. This can be done by passing a law regulating the practice of Chiroprac--ficand giving us, a State Board of our own, thus placing us on an equal footing withpharmacists and Dentists, who now have State Boards, and are under jurisdiction oF'the State Bqard of Health. Chiropractic is a separate and distinct profession from-'that of medicine; it is not taught in any medical college, therefore Chiropractorscan"not "properly belong under the jurisdiction of a Medical Board., If you are not acquainted with this great health producing science, go to aChiropractor and investigate what is being done for suffering humanity, then helpUSjget what the law is supposed to provide for all citizens of this great State Equal'Rights. .Chiropractic does not only- cure disease, but it is the greatest prophylacticor preventive of disease yet discovered. If this is true and it is being proven everydayri should the people's money be used to sponsor a great educational exhibitionand the people be deprived of one of the greatest blessings that could possibly be, offered them, viz.: A KNOWLEDGE OF CHIROPRACTIC?

Hamilton,chief of the Lexington Division, internal revenue, has announced.This is one of the new provisions of; the income tax law, Mr. Hamiltonsaid."Persons who fail to make a return, although it may not be a taxable return- are subject to a fine of$1,000. For example, any marriedman whose income exceeds $2,000,is required to make a return, although his income may be less than$2,500, and in that case would notbe taxable," Mr. Hamilton said.The blanks for corporation returns and for incomes of $5,000 ormore will be available at the Lexington office in the Federal building,about February 1. All persons whomade a return last year will receivea blank by mail from the Louisvilleoffice, it was said.
