Chronic Dyspepsia Cured
IT 111
yw FTER suffering for nearly thirty years
from dyspepsia Mrs n E Dugdale
wife of a prominent business man of
Warsaw N Y writes For 23 years I was
a constant sufferer from dyspepsia and a
weak stomach The lightest food produced
distress causing severe pain and the forma
tion of gas No matter how careful of my
diet I suffered agonizing pain after eating
I was treated by many physicians and tried
numerous remedies without permanent help
Two years ago I began taking Dr Miles
Nerve and Liver Pills and Nervine Within
a week I commenced improving and per
sisting in the treatment I was soon able to
eat what I liked with no evil effects
I keep them at hand and a single dose dispels
any old symptoms

up the poison and dry it up in the

joints give way to a stiffness the rack
ing pains of rheumatism The form
gradually bends the bones ache while
decrepitude and helplessness prema
