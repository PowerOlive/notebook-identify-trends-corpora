SHOWER FOR MISS BALL
Attempt to Be Made to Stamp
Out Alleged "Blind Tigers"
News in Millersburg
A number of ienan's from this erd
of Bourbon county and over the line in
Nicholas, it is reported, will move to
Missouri about the first of March
where they will engage in the growing
of tobacco. 1 he action taken by the
tobacco gorwers at the meeting held
in Lexington last week in voting to
cut out the tobacco crop this year is
responsible for this movement on the
part of the growers and tenants in lo
cating in another state for the culture
of tobacco.
From all reports that are continually
coming in from growers and tenants
who have emigrated to Missouri, it ,is
very evident that this State will soon
become Kentucky's chief competitor in
the production of tobacco. One man,
who recently returned to Kentucky for
n visit, claims tobacco can be grown in
Missouri as successfully as it can here.
Hundreds of Kentuckians have lo
cated in the vicinity of Veston, Mo.,
where the productive soil yields a weed
fqual to that produced in Kentucky.
The only difficulty encountered by the
growers, it is said is their failure to
get their barns built in time for the
housing of their product. This diffi
culty is being rapidly overcome and
within a few vears it is claimed by
those who have returned from the to
bacco growing sections Missouri will
rank with Kentucky in the production
of tobaccr.

Extensive Poverty.
Few persons are aware of the ex
tent of grinding poverty to which a
large class- of population has been
driven by the constant increase in the
cost of living. A competent author
j says that one-ninth of the total popu
lation or Isew York is receiving aid
either from the city or some charita
ble institutions and it cists thirty
five million dollars per year to handle
thejproblem, and yet with ail "of this,
it is estimated that thirty thousand
persons per year die from want of at
tention and proper care. There is
much suffering in our ovn city from
poverty and neglect, yet the problem
in the big cities is so much worse that
its magnitude is appalliing.
