Contrary to popular belief, Ken
tucky blue grass is not a native of
the United States, but was brought
over from the Old World by early
colonists, according to the Depart
ment of Agriculture, at Washington.
The most important hay grass
cultivated in the United States is
said to be timothy. It grows
throughout the northern half of the
United States and as far south as the
cotton belt.

TEACHEES UEGED TO ATTEND
BOSTON CONVENTION
Letters to city and county school
superintendents and principals
throughout the State have been sent
out by J. Virgil Chapman, State
supervisor of rural schools, urging
them to attend the sixteenth annual
session of the National Educational
Association in Boston, July 2 to 8.
"This will be in every sense an in
vigorating and inspiring conven
tion," Mr. Chapman asserts. "A trip
to Boston and its historic surround
ings especially at the fourth of July
period, with patriotic, exercises in
Fanuel Hall and on the famou?
Boston Common, is almost an educa
tion in itself. Kentucky teachers
need such inspiration. More of
them should be members of this
great national body of educators, re
ceive the literature and enjoy the
benefits of such membership. All
who can possibly do so should at
tend this, by far the greatest meet
ing in its history."
