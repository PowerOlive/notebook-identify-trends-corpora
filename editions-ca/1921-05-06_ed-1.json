n TOR DERBY
Wherever racing men gather in
uptown resorts of New York the feel
ing is apparent that despite the
snowing of Leonardo II in the Blue
grass Stake Saturday he is still one
of the outstanding candidates for suc
cess in the Kentucky Derby to-morrow.
In Saturday's race the track
was like a slab or Swiss cheese and
slow into the bargain. The horse did
not like the going a little bit, and
when forced to the pace he acted up.
Besides that ttiere are Popsters who
doubt his ability to carry weight and
.make distance.
t-ha, ntJior hand the great race
he ran a week ago, when he did the
mile in a fraction under the world s
record, time, has not been forgotten,
and given a dry track at Churchill
Down? to-morrow it is believed by
many shrewd New York turf fans he
wiU ask nothing of Tryster udery
Careful and the rest' of the good
neIs for Careful she will have her
backers on Derby Day. She has been
working out well and with a big
field such as will appear- on the
Downs her qualities as a mixer will
stand her in good stead.
But when it comes right down to
, question of the New Yorker s opin
ion as to the favorite nag. New York
hastily one answer Tryster is . tt.
candidate whom most of tteNej
York wise guys expect to cop the
-450,000 stake.
