STOPPED HIS PAPER
THE NF-WS recently received a
note from a subscriber sayirg that
unless some of his neighbors sub
scribed for the paper, he would have
to discontinue his subscription. He
said that some of his neighbors
seem to beat him to it post of the
time. "
THE NEWS receives many com
plaints from subscribers who say
their neighbors continually borrow
their paper, often before the sub
scribers have read U. And then the
subscribers put the blame on the
carriers.
If you aie reading a borrowed
paper to-day, you should ask your
self whether you are inconvenienc
ing a neighbor who is too good-natured
to refuse to be annoyed. You,
of course, do not intend to do so,
but if you are borrowing a paper
you are causing the subscriber mucfc
annoyance.
Think it over and then beconie a
subscriber, and have your own pa
gt delivered to you.
