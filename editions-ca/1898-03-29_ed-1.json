iron dyspepsia Sirs LT E Dugdale
wife of a prominent business man of
Warsaw N Y writes For 23 years I was
a constant sufferer from dyspepsia and a
weak stomach The lightest food produced
distress causing severe pain and the forma
tion of gas No matter how careful of my
diet I suffered agonizing pain after eating
I was treated by many physicians and tried
numerous remedies without permanent help
Two years ago I began taking Dr Miles
Kcrve and Liver Pills and Kervine Within
a week I commenced improving and per
sisting in tho treatment I was soon able to
eat what I liked with no evil effects
I keep them at hand and a single dose dispels
any old symptoms

dition of the kidneys When urine stains
linen it is evidence of kidney trouble Too
frequent desire to urinate or pain in the

WHAT T DO
There is comfort in the knowldg so often
expressed that Dr Kihneis bwuuip liout
the great kid ey remedy fulfills every wish
in relieving pain in the back kidneys liver
bladder and every part of the urinary pas
sages It corrects inability to hold urine and
scalding pain in passing i or bad eflecti fol
lowing use of liquor wine or beer and over
comes that unpleasant necjsslty of being
compelled to get up mauytimes during the
night to urinate The mild and the extraor
