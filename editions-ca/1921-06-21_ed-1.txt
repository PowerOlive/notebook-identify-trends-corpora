JKing, of the White Oak pike, founda $20 gold piece between two plantsin a one-acre toobacco patch whichhe was plowing. Just the edge of thecoin was showing and Mr. King atfirst thought it an old-fashioned copper penny. Cleaning It off, his mistake was discovered, much to his delight. The coin was of 1857 dateand perfect in preservation. Evidently it had not been handled much hefore it was lost. The tobacco patchcovered what was formerly a hog lotnear the King residence. The placewas formerly owned by Samuel Renaker, grandfather of Raymond King,and it is said to have been his habitof having gold money about thehouse. When money was "tight" andconditions unsettled, Mr. Renakerusually drew his deposits from thebank in gold coin and took it homefor safe keeping. It is probable thathe lost the double eagle found by his'grandson last week.

My nerveswere so badly unstrung that anysudden noise would make me screamout and become almost hysterical.Mv stomach was unset, my aDnetitewas the poorest it had ever been andI could not retain the little I dideat. I suffered terribly from nauseaand had smothering spells so badthey would have to loosen my clothesand I would just have to gasp tokeep breathing. My sleep was alwaysrestless and I had awful spells ofneuralgia in my head. I was tooweak to do any of my house-work,felt tired and fagged out all thetime and lost nearly all interest inlife."Tanlac is the grandest medicineon earth, for I have taken only threebottles and already I am feeling better arid stronger than I have in manyyears. I can hardly eat enough tosatisfy my appetite, nothing everhurts me and I am no longer bothered with those smothering: snells.

For the Borah resolution there has been substituted a resolution by the House approving of aplan President Harding is supposedto have, calling a general international conference for reduction onland as well as on sea. Such a planas is pointed out by people whoknow the military situation inEurope can get nowhere as Francealone, which will not disarm underany circumstances, could block it.Without reduction of armament theUnited States, of course, must continue to snend 93 cents of everydollar it takes in on wars past, present and future.0 -., -1 ruv. numor.t . ."WWi mKmmmmmmmammmmm mmmmmmm x i''$'? $is.-.

D,In the end we find that the test ottrie humor is the reaction it maketo the depression, sorrow and sadnesof life and its power to give brightness and courage in the midst of disaster. The joke is worth while thatmakes life more possible and sorrowa little less impossible that brings asmile amid tears, as sunshine in theheart of clouds is seen cutting its waythrough the darkness". Yet, despiteEngland's training In troable, what isthere finer than the delicate humor ofOliver Wendell Holmes? Exchange.There is on one to raise his voiceon behalf of the gambling that comeswith horses racing any more thanthere was any one found to hold abrief for the corner saloon and theevils for which it was held responsible. But there is moret o the racing ofhorses than the odds; more to thesport of knigs than the mutuels.There is, to begin with, the horse.There is the accumulated legend andtradition which associate the horsewith noble impulses tnd a splendidpower. Is there not biblical warrant for the faith that tells us thathe sniffs the battle from afar? Dowe not immortalize the horse whenwe immortalize the rider in thoseequestrian statues which are theglory of art, ancient and modern?And is not Brucephalus quite as essential to the story as Alexander?To love the horse is as natural asto make a companion of the dog.To-day, at the Dangerfield farm nearLexington, the most renowned member of the equine family, the retiredthoroughbred, Man o' War, holds hislevee and receives, with becominggravity an dignity, with perhapsjust a trace of bored condescension,the visits of an admiring world.From all over the country they cometo register their names in his guestbook, to gain for themselves something of the glory of association, t.osecure on the tablets of their memory a little corner which may justifythem in boasting, in the years tocome, very different years it may be,that they patted the famous stallionand were assured by- honest JohnBuckley, who valets him, that, con-cidprinir thft adulation from whicnfame has condemned him to suffer,he's a pretty good horse.GEN.
