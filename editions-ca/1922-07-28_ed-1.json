result of misplaced confidence in his
ability to locate the treasure after
secreting it.
Yesterday afternoon Patrolman
George W. Judy, while at the Inter
urban station, at the corner of Fifth
and High streets, had occasion to in
vestigate an ante-room in the color
ed department, and while searching
around saw the necks of two bottles
protuding near the top of a seat.
When the officer drew forth the arti
cles they were full of moonshine.
Patrolman Judy took the "hootch"
to the office of Sheriff Collier, in the
court house, and returning to the
station, made inquiries, but no
one knew anything about the liquor
being there, or how it came to be
there.
