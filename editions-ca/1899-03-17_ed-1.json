HE WANTED THE SHIP
THOUGHT HE WAS ELIGIBLE TO COM
MAND A CRUISER
Th Shabby Trick Played Upon a
Patriotic Greek Boiler Maker by
Some of Uncle Sams Sailors With
Wkom He Had Shipped
About four years ago the oruieer on
which I was serving shipped a boiler
maker while we were on the Mediter
ranean station said a Washington
chief petty officer of the navy now on
leave of absence Our former boiler
makers time expired while we were at
Gibraltar and as he wae not in good
physical shape he wasnt re enlisted
but took his discharge and returned to
th nnitfid States bv mail steamer So
th ship was ehy a boiler maker a very
important and neoessary petty officer
down below in the engineers depart
ment and when the ship pulled into
Naples harbor the chief engineer went
ashore to see if he couldnt dig up a
boiler maker
Theres a clause in the enlistment
regulations permitting commanding
officers to ship necessary men on foreign
stations in short handed emergencies
The chief engineer brought back to the
ship a Greek named Charlie Maro The
man couldnt speak any English to
speak of but he was a good man at
the boiler making business and he was
duly shipped aboard of us for three
years He was a Wild hairy looking
lot Maro was and he got a good deal
of a laugh at the hands of the crew es
pecially the younger fellows from the
time he first came over the side
Maro thought that there wasnt
Bay other country on the map except
Greece He thought that the Greeka
man was the hottest kind of a tamale
when it came to scrapping by laud or
sea and after he got hold of enough
English to make himself understood he
used to take some of the young appren
tice boys up into the eyes of the ship
and tell them with many gesticulations
and furious words of the different kinds
of tar Greece would knock out of Turkey
if the two countries ever came to an
open rupture
The ship was around on the Pacific
station when the war broke out between
Greece and Turkey When the news of
the outbreak of tfeewar got to Maro our
boiler maker he nearly had heart dis
ease and a whole lot of other sudden
things from pure excitement He just
couldnt hold himself in he looked so
tickled
Da Greeka manwillabim bim
bim da Turka man was Charlie
Maros way of putting it and he didnt
see that the Turk had a ghost cf a show
All hands forward encouraged him in
the belief They all acquiesced in ex
pressing the belief to Maro that Greeoe
would simply eat Turkey up Then a
bosuns mate who knew how to crack
the most impossible kind of steers with
a face as solemn and wooden as an In
dians took Charlie in hand and bold
him some things He told Maro that the
Dnited States was so much in sympathy
with Greece in the struggle with Turkey
that the navy department had decided
to turn over all of the ebipe of the
American navy to Greek commanders
Heres a big chance for you
Maro the bosuns mate told Maro
You just want to work your edge
Here you are already shipped on this
cruiser and its dollars to doughnuts
that if you ask for the command of this
ship in order to take her over to Greece
to mix it up with the Turks youll get
it hands down Better try it on
That idea impressed Maro a heap
He asked the bosuns mate whom hed
have to apply to to get command of the
cruiser
Why to the commanding officer
of course was the reply
Maro was tremendously important
for a day or so while he let this huge
idea grew within him and he bullied
the men detailed to work with him
down below in the boiler room a good
deal The bosns mate kept working
him up to it and finally Maro appeared
on deck one morning togged out in his
very best musteriug suit of bluejacket
clothes and went up to the officer of the
deck and asked permission to see the
commanding officer at the mast The
officer of the deck was rather surprised
to see the man all done up in his mus
tering togs when all hands were at
work but as be is obliged to do when
an enlisted man requests permission to
see the commanding officer he sent
word to the skipper who soon emerged
from his cabin and appeared at the
stick
Well my man said the skipper
to Maro who stood bolt upright and
saluted with a flourish
Sare said Maro to the skipper 1
have a da honor to her-a-by taka da com
mand of a da ship
Hey said the commanding offi
cer putting his hand to his ear and
looking as if be hadnt beard aright
Da ship repeated Maro For a
da navee of a Hellas da Greeka navee
I hava da honor to taka da command
All hands among the enlisted men
were up on the togallaut focsle tak
ing the thing in and they broke into a
roar that you could have heard five
cable lengths distance Maro heard it
and suspecting that his confidence had
been abused got red and flabbergasted
He suddenly bolted for the engine room
hatch and made his way below and it
took three marines to drag him aft to
the sick bay where the surgeon at the
pkippers command gave Maro a half
hours examination as to his sanity
Maro was game enough to decline to
give the name of the enlisted man who
had told him be was eligible for the
command of the ship upon its being
turned into the navy of Greece but
the thrashing he gave that bosns
mate when be got bim on the beach
was certainly savage Washington
