crept a numbing shadow throughThe brightness of my dwelling placeSo dumb her lips so veiled her eyesSo chill the hand in mine she laidThe sunshine vanished from the skiesAnd in the cloud I knelt afraidBut sorrow stayed until I heardIn that bushed silence round her drawnVoices more sweet than song of birdThe tender tones of loved ones goneAnd floating from the silvern shoreWhereon the ransomed

to let her know nothing- aboutFlorence and she hasnt But presently when she dresses for the atternoonand comes down and hears about Randy What thenStill sleeping is she asked Grafton ignoring for a moment the question as to what might happen whentheir guest awoke and heard the newsYet I think you said she was greatlyexcited after getting that second dislatch and had been dreadfully nervousShe certainly was for some hoursand you know she walked and tossedlast night after she came upstah sThen she seemed to fall into a deepsleep and Annette said she could hardly arouse her for her coffee this morningGrafton tugged at his mustache andgave himself over to deep thought afew minutes Mrs Grafton anxiouslywatching his faceWell said he starting up and asit were shaking himself together

Then dusting away withher finger tips some flakes of cigarashes that clung to the breast of thecaptains undress coat she venturedThere are two things I cant understand If hes her lawyer why he shouldbe wiring to Randy and not to her andwhy it is the strikers dont cut thewires if they want to cut off all businessHis broad brown hand patted caressingly the taper white fingers toyingabout the little toggle of his watchchain as he looked down into her anxious upturned faceHis letters to Ean have been unanswered and he probably expects her topay as little attention to his dispatchesAs for the wires they are more necessary to the strikers in their combinations than to anybody else otherwisetheyd have cut them long ago ah herecomes our messenger nowAnd sure enough the orderly trumpeter came trotting up the steps theusual brown envelope in his handMrs Grafton eagerly watched herhusband as he read I thought sosaid he looking quietly up Readthat and handed her the dispatchTo Capt

ladiesand children began to appear in theirfresh afternoon toilets and their babycarriages and nurses were in force alongthe gravel walk and the band was assembling for its daily concert on theparade a vision of womanly lovelinessalbeit garbed in somber black camesmilingly down the stairs at Graftonsand rustling out to shower graciouswelcome on the little group of ladiesand officers on the front piazza Someof the men were seated Whittaker andMinturn notably being nearest the doorothers sunning themselves out alongthe fence while the ladies occupiedtheir camp chairs or the steps as bestpleased their fancy Graftons was always a popular rendezvous on the cavalry side and to day the assembly wasmore numerous than usual and anybody but- Fanny McLane could not havefailed to note how deep was the shadowthat overspread every face how somberand mirthless the tenor of the talk Intent only on charming she came trippingly forth bestowing a white handon the red striped Minturn who wasprompt to seize it and smiles and nods-and chirrups upon everybody The menJ who had risen end dofEed their caps didnot retake their seats for a trumpeterwas sounding a stable call and Whittaker murmured with telling

a moment to glance overthem I will have the answers sentSuppose we step insideIt was wonderful with what suddenness gladness and would vanishfrom her eyes leaving1 there only ahunted haggard look so too in thelines about the sensitive mouith yetthe soft creamy tint of the fair skin remained unchanged as add the gentlecolor Mutely she arose and followedhim and the parlor being in the shadeand too near the party on the porch heled on to the bright dining room whosewindows commanded a view of the sunshiny mesa There he turnedMr Parry wires me that he had expected you in Denver three days agoand

bringing him in nowAnd for the second time within theweek Fanny McLane went senseless ina second a limp and nerveless heapupon the floor They had to carry herto her room and Grafton was the burden bearer and then having laid herupon her -bed and while the womenwere bustling about with the usualrestoratives he stopped one moment before her profusely littered toilet tableA little case half hidden among themess unerringly caught his eye netook it touched the spring gave onequick glance at the dainty delicate instruments and phials inside and replaced it with the quiet remark Ithought soCHAPTER XIVBut Grafton had graver work aheadand it was close at hand Punctilioussoldier that fie was he would leave noloophole for the possible criticism of asuperior Hurriedly writing a few linesto Col Buxton notifying him that thewagon bringing Merriam was now closeto the garrison and that as arrangedbetween them he would meet it at thegate he sent the note by his servant andhastened up the row to ilhe angleformed by the south and west frontswhere an opening had been left in thefence for the convenience of ridingparties and it was through this gapthat poor Randy was presently trundledand then down along the line to his owndoorway By this time the pain in hisstrained and stiffened leg was intensewhile the arm hurriedly but skillfullydressed when far afield was troublinghim but little His one thought all theway had been for Florence He had insisted on scribbling her a little note before they reached the Santa Clara justto tell he was all right tlhat therewas notding to worry about and all heneeded was a few days of her nursingThe docor gave it to one of the men andgraveiy Daae mm riaeanead and give itJ to Mrs Merriam- and the trooper hadduly handed it in at the door whereHop Ling- received it with his customary grin and stowed it away on themantel in the now deserted parlorwhere notes and cards had generallybeen displayed for the eyes of the youngmistressAnd now as they neared the familiarspot poor Randy would sit up Itwould never do to come before her eyesprostrated as though sorely hurt Anything to spare her needless shock orworry He even essayed a semi jocularhow are you old man as he caughtsight of Grafton and tried a smile anda wave of his hand to theladies who appeared on the southernmost porch ofthe infantry linesWhy yon look as though youd hada worse tussle than I captain helaughed painfully as he held out hishand How is Florence It hasntfrightened her much has it I hopeMrs Haynes been with herShes been a good deal troubled ofcourse answered Grafton gravelybut but Mrs Hayne is bringing herround all right I think How are youold man You did have a rideBut nowliandy was peering out alongthe row their own row Women weyeto be seen here and there along theverandas gazing sympatheticallytoward the slowly moving party butno feminine form was visible on thepiazza of his little homeBetter lie back Mr Merriam urgedthe doctor Try to make him do sohe murmured to Grafton Weve gotto get him quiet in his room before welet him know anything Already theanxious young- physician had been toldthat Mrs Merriam was probably TiDmiles away and his soul was wrung atthe thought of what that would meanto his patientYes lie down Randy till we get youindoors urged Grafton Weve hadto put up a game on Mrs Randy Godforgive me the lie he prayed Knowing how anxious you were and we werelest she should be shocked we kepther away Mrs Hayne and Dr Gouldare looking out for her Shes not to lieallowed to come near you till we getyou safe and sound and bathed and allfixed up in bed Of course we knownow Randy we didnt before butMrsHayne had to tell my wife how carefulwe have to be oilier now and reallyold she oughtnt to see you tillyoure washed and dressed You looktoughAnd though the face he longed to seeas they bore him up the steps was milesand miles away Merriam stifled his owndisappointment and bravely thankedthem God bless you and Mrs Grafton That was indeed thoughtful ofyou old boy he gasped for pain waswrenching him and he gavealong longsigh of relief when at last he was liftedfrom the stretcher to a bed in the spareroomBut that sigh was a faint whisper ascompared with the long long breaththat Grafton drew as he sat him downin the adjoining- room and mopped hisstream in- foreheadTO BE CONTINUED--A LAWYERS ZEALReerrettcd His Client Had Not BeenStruck ly a Trolley CarA Brooklyn man who had the misfortune to break his arm by trippingover a curbstone and falling upon thelimb consulted a leading lawyer ofthat borough to see if he could not recover damages from the city for1 theaccident The lawyer heard the de-I tails and then saidI do not think there is any lawby which a man could recover damagesfor not lifting his foot high enoughIn a recent case a contractor had lifted a flagstone on the sidewalk andturned it over leaving a hole where ithad been originally and a double thickness of stone where it restedA woman came along stepped inthe hole fell and broke her leg Shesued the contractor and received a verdict of 1000 damages but he appealedand the appellate court reversed theverdict on the ground that she shouldhave looked where she was steppingThe client said that he thought thecurbstone was too high but the law3er replied that he did not know of anylaw that regulated the height of acurbstone Then the man of law gotwarmed up to the sub jeet and saidNow if you had only been hit by atrolley car we could have got a goodverdict against the company I havejust recovered a verdict for a womanwho had both legs broken by being runover by a trollej car It is a pity thatyou were not hurt that wayThen as he bowed his astonished client out of the office he saidNow remember next time you getI hit by a trolle

rFAILED TO MEETAmerican Commissioners Asked fora Postponement Until WednesdayWant Time to Translate Reply of the UnitedScateu to the JLatest Spanish Propositions Repardinjj the PhilippinesWhich Had Just Keen ReceivedPabis Nov 9 The Spanish-Americanpeace commissioners have notifiedthe minister of foreign affairs M Delcasser that the joint session which wasto have taken place Tuesday will notbe held and that they will notify theminister when they have determinedupon the date of another meetingLater a semi official note was issuedannouncing- that the peace commissioners had informed tliG French minister of foreign affairs that their conferences were suspendedInquiry developed the fact that thefailure to hold a meeting of the commissions Tuesday was only due to theAmericans asking for a postponementof the joint session until Wednesday jnorder to allow time for the translationof the reply of the United States to thelatest Spanish propositions- regardingthe Philippine islands which was received here Tuesday morningWashington Nov S So far as thestate department knows there hasbeen no break in the peace negotiations in Paris and if difficulty hadarisen officials say it would have beenreported promptly to the departmentIt is assumed therefore that theremust be some purely internal reasonfor the postponement perhaps the convenience of the commissioners Theadvices that have come to hand sofar are said to be rather encouraging than the reverse and there is adisposition to agree to the statementrather curiously made by the Spanishcabinet that there will bethree or four more meetings of thejoint commission This is taken- foran indication that the Spaniardsthemselves are not looking for a breakin the negotiations but rather expecta peaceful conclusion in a short timeThe foreign bondholders have at lastmoved formally to protect their interests in Cuba and Porto llico The initial steps have been taken through theagency of the French embassy whichin this case acts no longer as the representative of the Spanish governmentbut for French subjects Through theFrench embassy a most formidablestatement has been presented to thestate department being an account ofthe various Spanish bonds owned byFrench citizens chargeable against theterritories either seized or set free byact of the United States governmentThe sum total of these bonds runs farup into the millions Just wbat it isexpected shall be done with them isnot made clear The United Statesgovernment of course will not paythem but it may bs that the Frenchgovernment looks to it to canse the independent government of Cuba to assume liability for redemption of thebonds charged against that island whenchat government shall have become dulyInstalled by the act of the United Statesgovernment It is probable that otherholders of like bonds German andBri tish will take similar steps to havetheir claims brought through theirdiplomatic representatives to the attention of the United States government and it may even be that holdersof such bonds in Spain though Spanish citizens will take a like coursewhich would present a novel claimapon the generosity of the UnitedStates governmentwSiiliiiia it 1

PresidentWashington Nov 8 Spains exhaustive argument against the cessionof the Philippines to the United Stateshas had the result of making the officials all- the more determined to takethe islandsInstructions sent to Mr Day chairman of the American commissionerswill require him and his colleagues torenew on Tuesday their demand forconcession of the group to the UnitedStates and they will make in their communication the first offer of money inpayment for the islandsIt is understood that the presidentwill consult Tuesday with some of hisadvisers- concerning the amount to benamed in the American communication but the sum to be paid will notunder any consideration exceed theaggregate of the debts contracted bythe Spanish government for improvements in the Philippines All militarydebts and debts contracted in thename of other islands sueh as- Cubawill be barred and the Spanish commissioners will be informed that theyimist recognize this fact as promptlyas possible-Kr Adm Deweys victory in Manilabay was unimportant and the posses-of Cav ite during the war was notsuch as to give the Americans theSpaniards declare control of the islands and it is claimed and the claimis fortified by argument and manylegal precedents that the Americangovernment has no moral right to demand the cession of the entire groupof 1400 islands when it held only sucha small bit of territory as that at Cavite and controlled only the bay ofManila-All during- the war Spanish troopswere- stationed on other islands andwere not molested The Spaniards indicated their willingness however tosell the islands and the authoritieshave no apprehension now that anyrupture will occur unless it be over theamount to be paidIt is also claimed by the Spanishcommissioners that this declai atiouwas assented to by President Mclvinley As a matter of fact the note hadbeen delivered but the president haddeclined to answer it either in writingor verbally to M CambonThe Spanish commissioners have declared it is said that instead of theUnited States acquiring the Philippines this government should paytheir government an indemnity for theattack on Manila after the peace protocol had been signed and for the damage consequently doneSecretary Hay has received a fullstatement of the contents of theish note Its character was rast whafsthe officials expected without anypew arguments of importance Senator Rios and his colleagues call attention to the action of the government indelivering the note through M Cambon the French ambassador to President Me ICinley which sets f orth theunderstanding of the Spanish government that in agreeing to the protocolits sovereignty over the Philippineswould not be affectedAfter the Philippine question hasbeen disposed of the commissionerswill consider the determination ofclaims which have been filed byAmericans against Spain and by Spaniards against the United States Itwa thought that this governmentwould bind itself to satisfy all American claims in consideration of the territory ceded to the United States butthis is incorrect The Spanish commissioners have a heavy claim for filibustering against the United States to offset the claims filed by Americans forpersonal and property injuries and thequestion of their disposition will haveto be decidedEIGHT DEAD PASSENGERSVictims of the Iiost Atlantic Ijim r MohcSiin

but the rock oyster is more generally esteemed for flavor Their namesindicate their place of growth The rockoysters love the beds and adjoiningrocks of tidal streams They grow inclusters in a variety of shapes and sizesand each cluster is attached to something solid Here they are alternately bathed in salt water and in fresh orbrackish They are also left for hourshigh and dry until the ir coming tiderefreshes them Nor do these oysters always select rocks on which to dwellThese accommodating nollusks mayfrequently be found adhering to theroots and lower branches of the mangrove and other trees which delight ina sort of submarine residence It isdoubtless to this peculiarity that thesailor referred when he wrote to hismother at home telling the old ladyand not untruly that in Australia

thepublic though no doubt sufficing tohimself When Nathaniel Dring whohad married this third wife and hadbeen rendered presumptuous by thatcircumstance started out one linespring- morning to convert Craddockto the toleration of matrimony as afecial institution of some importanceit was generally admitted that he gotthe worst of the argument For wherasserted with cjuite unnecessaryeffusiveness that he had never had across word with cue of his three wivesCraddock merely grunted flowmonotonous and indicated by a slightsmile which seemed to confine itselfto the corners of his grim mouth thathe regarded statement as acunningly devised fableNot as T object to your marryin asmany wives as you like he added byway of conciliation though when aman has ad three wives in seven yearstis uncommon like polygamy43ut marriage is ordained for themutual help society and comfort theone ought to have of the other retorted Dring with a sudden recollection of the terms of the marriage service with which his acquaintance wasintimate and unusual Youd be a dealhappier for a woman to look arteryouXo doubt no doubt he repliedwith a gleam in his gray eyes whichwiser persons than Dring had longago recognized as dangerous Butspose she talked when I wasnt lonelywhat thn ehThere was always something peculiarly irritating in the eh of ThomasCraddock It was something betweena malignant chuckle and the sharpexplosive click of a secret springwhich one could fancy was ingeniouslyconcealed in his lean throat Craddocks throat was one of his strongpoints When he spoke what iscalledan Adams apple shot up and down likethe weight on the machine for the TFTalof the relative strength of mens fistsat fairs It possessed a dreadful fascination for children and in the mindsof older people was curiously associated with ideas of pugnacityThere aint enough for us all anyway an if you take moren your shareit stands to reason some o we poorchaps must go without We starvinchaps do it jest to oblige you greedychaps eh VWhen he had gone Craddock hammered vigorously at the boot that layon his lap and said to himself grimlyUeve meekencd two on em I misdoubt that the third oneU meekenhimbefore hes done wi her ehCraddock was a man who sufferedfrom an unsatisfied thirst for knowledge which accounted for the circumstance that on the wall of the dingyruom was conspicuously displayed amap of the world When he was vervJonely he looked at the map and wasstraightway consoled with the senseof the multitudinousness of life whenhe was oppressed with the narrownessof his career he reflected on the immensity of the Atlantic and Pacificoceans and repeated the heights of thegieat mountains which were boldlyprinted on the map It caused him acurious pleasure or at least a negation of pain to reflect on the numberof people reported ti exist in LondonNew York or Chicago a great many ofwhom were no better off than himselfMany efforts had been made to induce him to attend public worship onthe Sunday but none had succeededlie was always ready to recieve anysort of embassy on the subject but nojimount of argument made an y difference to his habits Every Sundaymorning he shaved put on a prehistoric blue coat then he lit a shortpipe and disappeared in the directionof the moors For some years he hadIbeen accompanied by an old retrieverdog but when the dog died he nevergot another and henceforth wentiiloneTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KT FRIDAY NOVEMBER 11 1898The mystery of his proceedings wasenhanced by the circumstance that heusually carried in his hand a smallblack book not unlike a Bible carefully wraiped in a big red cotton handkerchief People who did not scrupleto discuss every sort of question withCraddock had never quite ventured toask him what was the book he tookwith him on his solitary Sabbathwalks Perhaps it was because therewas a certain something in Craddocksgrim mouth which warned them notto go too far with himIt was not until Beckett the newcurate came that Craddocks doingsattracted wide notice Beckett wasan indefatigable little fellow withstrong views on the Divine necessityof state churches He was partly lamein one foot but his lameness did notprevent him tramping up and down inall weathers in heroic attempts toshepherd a scattered and recalcitrantflockHe never wore an overcoat if he hadhe would have covered up the silvercross which was conspicuously displayed on his black watch ribbonMotherly women with a sound traditional faith in the virtues of flannelwere much exercised in their minds onthe conjectural subject of his underclothing and said he did not lookstrong But the little curate limpedupon his heroic way ignorant of thesecriticisms no one but himself knewthat according to the best medicalopinion his lungs were not good formore than two years work at mostOne day he met the schoolmaster andasked him if he knew Craddock ashoemaker you know a bony angularman with a long throat and a lot ofgray hair lives in Tibbits rowAs everyone in Barford knew everybody else this question was quite unnecessary which fact however did notprevent the schoolmaster rubbing hischin meditatively as if that operationhelped him to recall the very wellknown physiognomy of CraddockWhen the aforesaid operation had beensatisfactorily completed he admittedcautiously that he might have seenhim pronouncing his words in such away as to clearly intimate to thecurate that it was by no means hishabit to notice such persons as CraddockI find he doesnt go to church onany occasion said Beckitt regretfullyTheres a good many in Barfordthat dont said the schoolmasterBut he doesnt go to chapel eitherIts bad enough to be a dissenter huthe isnt even thatThe schoolmaster thought this verylikely and being emboldened by an opportunity of explaining Craddockscharacter volunteered some conjectural information about the atheisticnature of the book which Craddockcarried with him on his Sunday walksThe curate was much shocked Hewould at once have gone to Craddockand demanded an explanation had notthe schoolmaster promptly repudiatedall authority for his own statementand further suggested that a lostsheep like Craddock should be treatedwith tenderness not to say Avith diplomacyWell Getike said the curate atlast perhaps youre right Ill tellyou what well do Im going to holda public discussion on the necessityof a state church in the schoolroomL next Tuesday Get Craddock to comeIts not like going to church you seeI think the man likes me in a waytand if he comes perhaps somethingI may say may bring him to the rightway of thinkingWhen the discussion was held on thefollowing Tuesday Craddock wasthere to the great surprise of everybody and the exceeding joy of thecurate It was on this memorable occasion that Craddocks reputation asa controversialist was finally establishedIt was generally admitted that thecurate spoke with great ability andthe deacons of the old meetinghousewere very much surprised There hadnever been a rector of Barford with theslightest capacity for public speechand shone all the more brightly by comparison with generations offumble mouthed apostolic successors IThe curates peroration was exceed jingly impressive He compared allother sects and churches to ships moreor less adrift whose lights were of an 1illusory and vanishing characterwhereas the church he did not condescend to any more exact designationwas like a lighthouse standinggrandly amid the storms founded onthe immutable rock and shedding aserene perpetual radiance on thetroubled waters of Time ne sat downamid loud and continued applauseIt was then that Craddock rose froma form at the extreme end of the roomand asked permission to say a fewwords There was u general feeling ofdismay which was not lessened whenhe ignored the chair and most pointedly addressed the eloquent curatesimply as Muster Beckitt sirChair chair cried the audienceOh I forgot the cheer did I theold man went on serenely Weilthen Ill say Muster Cheer sir if sobe thatll suit you better I aint aman as is give to public speech an Iwouldnt hev got up only I thoughtmaybe as Muster Beckitt would liketo near the views of a a sorter outsiderHere the curate nodded assentwhich as several of the motherly women remarked showed a angelic temper on his partNow vhat was it as Muster Beckittdid say If I heerd aright he did sayas church were a lighthouse which byall accounts is a very respectable sortof place but not one as f oiks is particular anxious to live in eh Theresa lighthouse down to St Colrm as voumay know an I know all about itcause -my brother was a keeper thereWell twas uncommon resky work acrettin to it to heo in wAih T- sifine days you could go a nigh it anwhen you got there you didnt seenothin to make you wish to stay anMuster Beckitt e says as church is alighthouse ehBut that isnt all A lighthouse is acold draughty sorter a place anywayThem as lives in it sees the ships agoin past an oftentimes wishes theywas on em an is sorry enough theyever give up the sea to start livin ona bit o roek It may be as tike shipstoss up an down a bit an sometimesone on em goes down an her lightsis dowsed but t is ten times happierwork a livin on a ship than it is on alighthouse An half the winterthrough the lighthouse is in a fogMuster Beckitt or I beg pardon MrCheer and parson said as churchwere a lighthouse ehBut I ask further what do thatthere ligM upon the lighthouse meanwhen so be it does shine What dothat there bell mean when thev ringit slow and solemn in a fog MusterBeckitt didnt tell wc that Praps heforgot Well Ill tell him though Ibe only an outsider so to speak Thelight an bell both do mean the samething They say Beware o metheres danger here- And MusterBeckitt e said as church were a lighthouse ehHaving fired this last gun over thegrave of an unhappy metaphor Craddock smiled benignly on the audiencewiped his forehead with the back ofhis hand and with a final cluck of theinstrument in his throat sat downamid roars of general laughterNow it happened that about a monthafter this famous thecurate went to St Colam tc spend aquiet Sunday with his friends niswinter work had tired him out andbrave as he was he was beginning todoubt if he could live through anotherwinterIt was a day of ethereal brightnesswith a suave and sparkling air and inthe afternoon he was tempted to walkalong the cliffs toward a little deserted church that stood on the cliffs edgeabout midway betwpen St Colam andBarfordIt was 20 years or more since it hadbeen used Its graveyard hung forlornly over the sea on a gentle slopeand quiet sheep were feeding on thegrassy barrows of the dead Beckittcame softly over the crisp turf ancwas about to pass round the chancelto the little graveyard when he wasarrested by the sound of a voice Itwasspeakingin alowmonotone Presently it rose into a clear mournfulcadence and his ear recognized thesublime phrases of the burial serviceThou knowest Liord the secrets of ourheart shut not Thy merciful ears to ourprayer but spare us Lord most holy OGod must mighty O holy and mercifulSaviour Thou most worthy Judge eternalsuffer us not at our last hour for any painsof death to fall from TheeThere was a long pause and a skylark could be heard singing over thesea Then the voice began againForasmuch as it hath pleased AlmightyGod of His great mercy to take unto Himself the soul of our dead sister here departedNov no Oh my God I cant say4that the voice broke forth in suddenagony Oh Lizabeth why did youleave meThe curate knew not what to do Atfirst he had been ready to suppose thatan interment was going on but thatthrilling cry Oh Lizabeth revealed not the solemn priest but thehuman mournerHe stepped softly out of the shadowof the chancel and looked over thehuddled stones A man was kneelingbeside one of them which looked morecared for than the rest It was Craddock In the same instant the twomen recognized one another Thecurate was about to turn away whenCraddock beckoned himLook said Craddock grimlyThe stone had been freshly scrapedand lettered It bore no memorialverse two names onlv and a dateELIZABETH CRADDOCKand her Infant ChildJuly 18

Killing of Her CalfShe Deals Ont Death andDestructionA widely known and feared devil fishhas its headquarters in the northernPacific mostly along the Americancoast especially affecting the Gulfof California This huge creature isa mammal one of the great whalefamily really a rorqual of mediumsize and moderate yield of oilOnly the elite of the Yankee whalemen dexterous and daring as are allthe tribe can hope to get to windward of the diabolically cunning giants whom they abuse with suchfluent and frequent flow of picturesque profanity It is a peculiar characteristic of this animal that it seemsever on the alert scarcely exposing forone moment its broad back above thesea surface when rising to spout andgenerally traveling unlike all its congeners not upon but a few feet below the water Eor this reason andin this fishery alone the whalers armthemselves with iron shafted harpoons in order to strike with greaterforce and certaintv of direction awhale some distance beneath the surface A standing order too amongthem is never b3 am chance to injure a calf while the mother lives sincesuch an act exposes all and sundrynear the spot to imminent and violentdeath Xeglect of this most necessary precaution or more probably accident once brought about a calamitythat befell a fleet oC 11 Americanwhaleships which had been engagedin the bowhead fishery among theice floes of the Arctic Pacific In orderto waste no time they came southwhen winter set in and by commonconsent rendezvoused in Margharitabay Lower California for a month ortwos devil fishingThe whales were exceedingly abundant that season and all the shipswere soon busy with as much blubberas they could manage The ease withwhich the whales were being obtainedhowever led to considerable carelessnss and forgetfulness of the fact thatthe whale never changes its habitsOne bright morning about threeweeks after the opening of the season the whole flotiUa of 52 boats fourfrom each ship had been lowered andwere making their way as rapidly aspossible to the outlying parts of thegreat bay keeping a bright lookoutfor fish Spreading out fan wisethey were getting more and more scattered when about near the center ofthe fleet some one suddenly struckand got fast to a fish Hut hardlvhadthe intimation been given when something very like panic seized upon thecrowd In a moment or two the reason was apparent From some causenever definitely known a harpoonerhad in striking a large cow whaletransfixed her calf at her side withhis harpoon killing it immediatelyThe mother having- quietly satisfiedherself that her offspring was reallydead turned upon her aggressors likea veritable demon of destruction andwhile carefully avoiding exposure ofher body to attack simply spreaddevastation among the flotilla Whenever she rose to the surface it wasbut for a second to emit an expirationlike the hiss of a lifting safety valveand almost always- to destroy a boator complete tli destruction of onehopelessly damagedEver- blow was dealt with an accuracy and appearance of premeditation that filled the superstitious Portuguese who formed a good half ofthe crews with dismay the more scthat many bf them could only guesat the original cause of what was really going on The speed of the monster was so great that her almost simultaneous appearances at pointiwidely separated made her seem ubiquitous and as she gave no chancewhatever for a blow it certainlylooked as if all the boats would be destroyed seriatim Not content withdealing one- tremendous blow at a boatand reducing it at once to a bundleof loose boards she renewed her attentions again and again to the wreckage as if determined that the destruction should be complete Utter demoralization had seized even the veterans and escape was the only thoughtgoverning all action But the distanceto shore was great and the persistence and vigor of the f uriousleviathanso far from diminishing seemed to increase as the terrible work went onAt last two boats did succeed in reaching the beach at a point where itslopedvery prradually The crews had hardlyleaped overboard to run their craftup high and dry when close behindthem in the shallows foamed and rolledtheir relentless enemy jnst too late toreach them Out of the large numberof well equipped boats that left thehips that morning only these two escaped undamaged and the loss of theseasons work was irremediable Over50 men were badly injured and sixone of whom was the unhappj originof the whole trouble were killed outright The triumphant avenger ofher slain offspring disappeared asas she had

maybe regarded as essentially misguidedwho go to Samoa without having completed their arrangements for goingfurther without loss of time or elsecoming back but this was a glaringinstance The individual brought withhim a merry-go-round a triple combination of the wooden horses the melancholy hand organ and the peanutroaster all embraced in a gaudy signboard reading The American SteamRiding Garllery With this tripletof attractions the proprietor expecteda large amount of coin from the amusement-lovingislandersThere was every kind of hitch in getting the machinery put up the trackwould not ballast level the boilerwould not boil water the steam engine would not go and the openingperformance was continually beingpostponed until repairs could be effected The only man on the beachwho understood such machinery wasin jail for arson having set fire tothe foreign church Some of the residents felt a little nervous when hewas leased to the merry-go-round maneven though it did add a shilling a dayto the municipal revenue for it wasfeared that he might slip away fromthe fat half caste policeman detailedto watch him and might set somethingelse on fire Those were great daysfor the idle Samoans of Apia for assoon as the machinery had beenpatched up and looked to be in runningorder it was necessary to give it atest and that meant a free ride forall the idlers in the

worthless natives from far and near It even gotinto the region of the higher politicswhen towns in rebel districts soughtto get a safe conduct to come intoApia to ride on the horses of whichthe knowledge spread far and wideThe disaffected charged it up as another item against King Malietoa thathe shut them out from this civilizingspectacle simply because he wras afraidof themBut with all this the proprietor ofthe great moral sfrow was not happyHe had a large free list of those whebrought wood and water for the engine and those who had gratuitoxisljassisted in putting the machinery ipplace or said that they had done soBut it was like drawing teeth to getthe sixpences After a few days hehad to bisect his rates and give tworidies for sixpence Even at that hewas forced to stop running every evening and finailjr got down to two performances a week It is safe to saythat he will never forget his disastrous attempt to be a purveyor oiamusement to a people habitually penniless The month of his exhibitionwas surely run at a loss and he hadan unexpected bill for repairsWhen he set up his horses in Apiathey were really a fine collection ofwell groomed little steeds Each onehad

has been my lack of tatThis may seem like a contradiction but it isreally very simpleI have always fancied that I could attendto business for other people all right but Inever had any tact about my own that isabout my personal relations with people Ialways bungle them whenever 1 attempt todo anything Thus if I have a misunderstanding or difference with anybody aboutanything and I set about straightening itout I cant possibly do it except in one wayI have to go at it flat footed I havent anymore diplomacy than a stone image Andmoreover besides being clumsy about it Iam pretty sure to say too much to saythings that it isnt necessary to say Inother words I havent any tact at allAnd at first this was a great drawback tome But after awhile I made a discoverythat if I didnt exercise my tact I shouldntmake any mistakes by it and following thatcourse for a time I came to a realization ofthe fact that theres a great lot of thingsthat we run up against in life which maybe irritating at the time that are howevernot worth squabbling over at all whether amans got tact or not and I was sure tomake a mess of these things if I tried to doanything about them why I dont try Isimply let em goAnd thats what Ive been doing now foryears not bothering about every little triflebut letting the little things go and not bothering about em at all paying no attentionto them whatsoever And so I have beenenabled to preserve my equanimity andavoid all useless wear and tear and thus mylack of tact has finally proved most helpfulto meBut I have to keep a watch all the timeN Y SunA FATHERS
