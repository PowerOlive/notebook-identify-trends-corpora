If the people generally knew the true
cause of Rheumatism there would be
no such thing as liniments and lotions
for this painful and disabling disease
The fact is Rheumatism is a disordered
state of the blood it can be reached
therefore only through the blood But
all blood remedies cannot cure Rheuma
tism for it is an obstinate disease one
which requires a real blood remedy
something more than a mere tonic
Swifts Specific is the only real blood
remedy and promptly goes to the very
bottom of even the most obstinate case
Like all other blood diseases the
doctors are totally unable to cure Rheu
matism In fact the only remedies
which they prescribe are potash and
mercury and though temporary relief
may result these remedies produce a
stiffness of joints and only intensify the
disease Those who have had experience
with Rheumatism know that it becomes
more severe each year
The case of Mrs James Kell of 6n
Uinth Street S E Washington D C
should convince everyone that it is
useless to expect doctors to cure Rheu
matism Under recent date she writes
A few months ago I had an attack of
Sciatic Rheumatism in its worst form
The pain was so intense that my ner
vous system was prostrated and I was
for a long time perfectly helpless The
attack was an unusually severe one
and my condition was regarded as
being very dangerous
I was attended by one of the most
able doctors of Washington City who is
also a member of the faculty of the
leading college here He told me to
continue his prescription and I would
get well After having it refilled twelve
times and receiving not the least bene
fit I declined to take it longer
Having heard SSS Swifts Spe
cific recommended for Rheumatism
I decided almost in despair to give
it a trial After taking a few bot
tles I was able to hobble around on
crutches and very soon had no need
at all for them for SSS cured me
sound and well All the distressing
pains have left me my appetite has
returned and I am happy to be again
restored to perfect health
SSS never disppoints for it is made
to cure these deep rooted diseases which
are beyond the reach of all other reme
dies It cures permanenty Rheumatism
Catarrh Cancer Scrofula Eczema and
all other blood diseases It is the only
blood remedy guaranteed

THEY FIGHT IT OUT
HOW ENGLISH ARMY OFFICERS SET
TLE THEIR DIFFERENCES
The Plebeian and the Peer How One
Regiment Was Opened to Others Than
Offshoots of the Peerage How Molly
Crushed the Cheeky Youngster
In view or4 the disgraceful duel be
tween the Duke of Orleans and the
Count of Turin we publish the follow
ing article which shows the manner in
which British officers settle disputes
Officers have their disagreements of
course like other men and they have
to be settled Dueling is forbidden by
law as wall as by modern ideas and
oonmaon sense Complaints respecting
infractions of mess etiquette or of un
gentlemauly or unsoldierly conduct may
be submitted to the mess committee the
punitive powers of which are extremely
farreaching The life f an officer sent
to Coventry by his fellows is unendura
ble and his only chance is to eschanga
But all this is moral suasion only
and in the end disputes are frequently
settled by a resort to first principles
the rule of fist while redress is some
times obtained in ways as drastic as
they are novel
A gentleman joined a crack cavalry
regiment He had no pedigree or fami
ly to recommend him In fact his fa
ther was a retired brewer and by the
scions of nobility among his comrades
he was rather coldly received
Are you the son of Dash the brew
er inquired one of these
lam
Then why didnt your father bring
you up to his trade
Oh well youre the son of Lord
Piank arent you
Yes
Then why didnt he bring you up a
gentleman
The upshot of this was a rough and
tumble wherein was demonstrated that
in the army a plebeian is the equal of a
peer if he can box as well
Another gentleman from the ranks of
trade came home one day to find all the
crockery and breakable articles in his
rooms smashed the same being intend
ed by the wreckers as a delicate hint
that his presence among them was ob
jectionable
Ho was late for dinner that evening
and apologized to the president of the
mess for it explaining what had hap
pened that he had been to the rooms
of the three he suspected and returned
the compliment if he had wronged
any he would apologize and restore the
articles if he had hit on the right ones
they could have satisfaction in the rid
ing school after dinner
Accordingly after dinner two of
them received satisfaction in full a la
Corbett in drill time but the third
proved a tougher nut to crack and the
big hearted plebeian who by the bye
is now a general weakened by his ex
ertions was getting worsted so anoth
er of the same social status who was
an expert boxer took up the running
He soon finished off the third man
and obligingly offered to take on any
one who sympathized with the trio By
this means appropriate to their pro
fession these two officers opened the
door in that regiment to others than
offshoots of the peerage by whom it
had previously been regarded as a pre
serve
Among officers exchanging from one
regiment to another is common One
little man a lieutenant incurred the
enmity of the men of his troop by con
tinually finding fault and rubbing it in
by contrasting them unfavorably with
his late corps till they hated the very
name of the Pinks as well call
them
Not only the rank and file but the
noncommissioned officers came in for
his animadversion till it got unbearable
and at last the troop sergeant major
told the captain quietly that there
would be a mutiny in the troop before
long if it continued
It so happened that he had also car
ried his insulting comparisons inta the
mess and as he wouldnt take advice
and drop it his brother officers took
the matter into their own hands with
the result that one cold night in Febru
ary there was a hubbub within the offi
cers quarters a window was presently
opened and little Joey clad only in
his nightshirt was handed out seized
placed and held down in a handbarrow
wheeled off to the manure heap and
there shot out to make his way back to
bed as best he could He soon after left
the regiment
The antipodes of this gentleman was
an officer in the same regiment an
Irishman 6 feet 2 and big in propor
tion but his go was not proportion
ate to his size He was too big and apa
thetic for a cavalry captain In fact
his nickname Molly well describes
him One cheeky youngster appeared
to think he could take any liberties
with such an easy going mountain of
flesh and in the billiard room one night
he carried his impudence beyond all
reason
Molly said nothing He simply
dropped his cue picked the offender up
and sat him violently down on a side ta
ble ignorant or heedless of the fact
that upon it were standing glasses and
decanters
It was some time before the surgeons
picked the last piece of glass out of the
impertinent one and weeks before he
could appear in the saddle again It is
scarcely necessary to say that he gave
Molly Maguire a wide berth after
that Pearsons Weekly
