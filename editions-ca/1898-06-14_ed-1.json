HER CHAFING DISH
When Fanchon to her chafing dish
Repairs and lights the alcohol
We look for miracles and wish
That fate may let us share them all
Though not to gluttony inclined
We laugh with gastronomic glee
And each lays plan with secret mind
To eat tiCbitb enough for three

For rnclon Is a cook supreme
Of daintier which the dish may hold
A gracious of the steam
Whose l tics pleuae us more than gold
JSer iinn u huiei and croquettes
Are jkt f cliciousness
Her oys teis and her omelets
Achieve iho climax of success
And yet I woiuer en it he
That Fanchon s skill is so unique
3 know what avor all for me
Are her Li lght eyet and glowing cheek
Well Fanehci cater to the iron
And to the mauls whom men desire
But dont gt scorched young lady when
Youre playing with the dainty lire

SAFE EEHIND IRON DOORS
How a
Brooklyn
Protected
Is
It is generally accepted as a fact that
be most expensive and elaborate taber
N nacle for the services in this couurry is
that belonging to St Augustines
church Brooklyn Formed entirely of
gold and silver and studded with pre
cious stones it would prove a rich haul
for the daring but sacrilegious marauder
This fact was fully appreciated by the
church authorities who have devised a
plan of protection which is as near per
fect as can be It is an electric system
xmique and effective and now when the
congregation arrives the tabernacle is
fm full view hut as soon as the congre
gation is dismissed the tabernacle dis
appears completely apparently without
human aid
Two great heavy harveyized iron
doors which have been covered with
gold leaf roll forward at the press of
an electric button and completely con
ceal and protect the costly chancel
These folding doors meet in a dome at
the top to afford protection in that direc
tion The motion of the doors is slow
and easy special apparatus being do
vised for the purpose the doors moving
on heavy roller bearings The motion
is imparted to them by means of a sys
tem of gears actuated by an electric
snGtor installed directly beneath in the
cellar In order that no one should have
access to the actuating push buttons
ihese are placed in a regulation fire and
burglar proof vault of massive construc
tion ine comumation to wnicn is
known only to the rector and his asso
ciates All the wires leading to the mo
tor from the source of supply are con
Jiected at vaiions points to the local po
lice and burglar alarm service so that
should any one tamper wTith the wires
notification would be given immediate
ly The safe doors are so constructed
that should any one attempt to drill
through them other electric circuits
would be closed and the alarm given
When the dcors before the tabernacle
re closed it is completely inclosed in
heavy iron on all sides so that it is
annch safer thai if an armed guard
stood watch Lciore it Cleveland Plain
-Dealer
Homes cf the Anthracite Miners
A group of papers dealing with the
Pennsylvania coal regions appears in
The Century Jay Hambidge gives An
Artists Impression of the Colliery Re
gion Mr Hambidge says of one of th8
- patches where the miners live Each
little house with the boxes cubby
wholes and fences about it has been built
y the man who lives in it And he is
a laborer a smuggler for mere existence
aot deft in the use of tools nor with an
- eye for the symmetrical nor with an
appreciation for anything beyond the
most primal facts of living The roofs
- of the buildings slant at all angles
with no two sides of the same length or
- deflection One portion will have eaves
while its companion will scorn the lux
ury The same incongruity prevails ev
erywhere Some of the small openings
nsed for windows are high while others
are low One door will open in and an
other out The hinges have evidently
come from the company scrap pile and
the staples and latches and locks from
the same source Some of the roofs have
shingles others weatherboards while
others are formed of great pieces of
-dusty Eheet iron
r George Got His Wheel
George had wanted a bicycle for a
long time Last year his birthday was
embittered by the fact that he did not
get the much coveted wheel and so he
awaited the day this time with much
anxiety
During the week before he regularly
aand earnestly resorted to prayer that he
Tsnight have his desire granted His par
ents really feared for his faith should
-he again be disappointed Therefore on
the morning of his birthday he found
awaiting him by his bedside a beautiful
aiew wheel
When his mother entered the room
she found him delightedly gazing upon
it
Well he called out cheerfully I
thought the Lord wouldnt have the
nerve to refuse this time New York
