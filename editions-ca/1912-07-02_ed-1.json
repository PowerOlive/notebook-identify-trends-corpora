Paris Wins Another Game from
Maysville.
"Our Nine'' won another game from
the Rivermen yesterday afternoon, the
contest resulting in a shut-out, the
second the Maysville aggregation
suffered during the series with Paris.
The Bourbonites played brilliantly
throughout and with Hauser on the
mound dealing out an assortment of
curves that were puzzlers, the Rivei-
men never nad a lookin.
First basemen Mollenkamp came in
yesterday morning and covered the
first station in the game. His playing
has greatly impressed the local fans
and his preence adds a world of
strength to -the club. The Bourbonites
are putting up a very clever article of
ball at this stage and interest in the
team is growing hourly. There is
little doubt that when they make their
appearance on the local grounds next
Thuvsday morning, the 'record they
will make on their trip to Richmond
will have the effect of bringing out a
large crowd.
The next game on the Paris grounds
will be played Thursday morning with
the Colts and the club will be at home
for the remainder of the week, after
the'holiday game with Lexington in
the" afternopn. Sunday afternoon
Mt. Sterling will play a double-header.
The local management last, night re
leased outfielder Volz.
In an exciting ninth-inning finiah
Pans took the game from Lexington,
Friday afternoon, by the score of 6 to
5. The wildness of Kobbins in the
final session was responsible for the
defeat of the Colts when, with one out
he could not locate the plate and filled
the bases. Turner, Who took his place,
forced in the first run with a pass, and
when Chapman hit to Curtis the latter
fumbled the ball, allowing two men to
cross the rubber. Ludwig pitched
good ball, but poor support gave the
visitors a good lead, which they held
until the ninth, when Paris won out.
The Colts turned the tables Satur
day, when they defeated Paris by a
score of 5 to 4. Paris had the game
sewed up until the seventh, when
Harrell, taking a I wet ball from
Harold, who was pitching, threw it
to the players' bench to be dried with
out asking the consent of "h's umps",
andjtwo men scored. The scoie then
stood four to three, which was tied by
Lexington in the next inning. The
contest went to the tenth inning,
was won by Lexington. Harold
very effective with men on bases
and
was
and
Kept his hits well scattered. Camnitz,
for tl e Cults, pitched a good game,
and drew S50 for?hitting the "bull" in
centerfield.
In a pretty contest at White Park
Sunday afternoon Paris shut out the
Rivermen 5 to 0. Applegate was on the
mound for Pari, and all through th2
contest pitched excellent ball, allowing
lut three hits, one ot which was a
csrtch. The locals pounded Beer for
eleven safe drives, each one of which
went to help in th run-getting.
Only in one inning did the Rivermen
eret a man as far as the third station.
Goodman put one out of the lot in the
seventh inning, knocking the ball over
the right-fipld fence. Harold drove in
the first two runs by a three-base hit
