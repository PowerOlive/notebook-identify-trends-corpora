State Highway EngineerJoe S. Boggs estimated. The sumthat will come to Kentucky, he said,is only a rough guess at this time.The bill provides $25,000,000 to heimmediately available for distribution to States which have compliedwith federal aid regulations, Mr.Boggs said, and that $50,000,000should be available the first part of1922. The States are to have twoyears in which to spend the moneyunder the bill, which, according toa telegram received, was finallypassed by Congress, and sent to thePresident for his signature.The division of the $75,000,000fund created by the new measure isto be made, it is understood, according to Mr. Bogs, on the basis ofone-third mileage of roads in theState, one-third for population andone-third for area. Sixty per cent ofthe fund is to be used on main national highways, such as the DixieHighway and the Jackson Highway,and 40 per cent on secondary roads,which correspond to the main Statetrunk highways.THE HOME TOWNWe live in this town because webelieve in it.

(adv)oTHE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS That the people of Kentucky, ofwhatever political faith, can and dodisregard differences of politicalopinion and work together on anyvital issue that promotes the generalwelfare of the entire State, is abundantly evidenced by an advertisementwhich appears on another page inthis issue, drawing the attention ofall voters to the great need ofamending the constitution at thecoming election to permit of removing the administration of our educational system from the smotheringinfluence of partisan politics.Tle advertisement referred to isbeing released in more than one hundred papers throughout the State,and in the list of citizens contributing toward the cost of this publicity are men and women of both political parties representing every section of the State.It is high time that we, in Kentucky, took this forward step. Ourpresent system, never the best, isnow old and anitquated. The Statein its progress has outgrown it. Itno longer severs the needs and demands of our 20th century progress.The change should have been madeyears ago. Other States are aheadof us in this respect.The question involved is not oneof partisan politics, but one thatreaches into the heart of everyman and woman in the commonwealth, regradless of his or her politics, and it is refreshing to notethat leaders and people alike, fromboth parties, all over the State areuniting on this vital issue ofamending the constitution to makepossible the improvements in oureducational system that will give tothe school children of Kentuckyequal educational advantages withthe children of other States. By allmeans, let us vote "yes" on bothamendments.You can't keep from a grouchoccasionally, uerhans. but vnn panThe new sugar coated fCK Mchewing injjj3P 'which everybody J SJlikes-you will, SW m tTotSill -rtf MW J0.TV. . w..

A. Jillson, director of the Kentucky Geological Survey, declared. There are a numberof carbon black factories in EasternKentucky and several others havebeen projected, Dr. Jillson said.Carbon black is used for printer'sink, being the only successful substance for inks for high-speedpresses, automobile tires, stove andshoe polishes, phonograph records,black leather, book binding, carriagecloths, celluloid, electric insluators,cement colors, crayons, drawing andmarking inks, artificial stone, blacktile, trpaulins and many other uses.It is manufactured by burning natural gas against a polished steelsurface and then gathering the resultant soot.Kentucky has twenty-two knowngas fields. Five of these, the Diamond Springs field in Logan county,Menifee county, Meade county, Cloverport, in Breckinridge county,and Martin county, are what thegeologist called the "Gas Pools ofYesterday."

Carrying knowledge of this fact to -thepeople of Kentucky is one of theobjects of the present campaign.The other object is to emphasize thelast that, where this early diagnosis has been had, the person suffering immediately should obtain the"best medical treatment procurable."Any unnatural lump or hardnessis to be regarded as potential cancer until proved by competent examination to be otherwise. That isespecially true of the breast, abdomen, lips and mouth. Any enlargement or tumor in any portionof the body which can be detectedby sight or touch, which persistsand which increases in extent,should be subject to examinationby those competent to make it."Cancer" invariably begins as alocal disease "and if recognized atthis stage can be surely and permanently cured if accessible. Anyunnatural discharges from the internal organs, especially at and after the age of 35, should be regarded with especial suspicion."IMPORTANT DECISION FOR CITY' EDUCATION BOARDSCity boards of education in thisState have authority under the actof 1920 to condemn property forschool buildings.

Bell was given $18,000damages for the land condemned,$2,000 for damages to the land left,and $400 incidental damages for thesmall tract of land condemned by theschool board in Harrodsburg.oThe main reason why the Congressional Record 4s so expensive is thatit carries so much free advertising.For Constipated Bowels Bilious LiverThe nicest cathartic-laxative inthe world to physic your liver andbowels when you have Dizzy Headache, Colds, Biliousness, Indigestion, or Upset, Acid Stomach iscandy-like "Cascarets."

'Mr. Rice'told William Baker, president ofthe Baker Heirs, Inc., his effortswould have the backing of GovrnorSproul and the political bosses ofthe State." I don't know any Mr. Rice,' theGovernor said, 'and I never approved the cause of the Baker Heirs. Ihave hear about the estate fromtime to time, but I am sure it islegally impossible to claim it. Lawyers who have engaged themselvesto ifcover the estate knew that itcouldn't be done.'"The plan outlined by 'Mr. Rice,'when the president of the Bakersvisited this city, was reported at ameeting of the heirs in Toronto lastweek."
