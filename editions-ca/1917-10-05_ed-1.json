TO PATRONS OF ADAMS EXPRESS
COMPANY.
TlTe volume of traffic now being
tendered to theNexpress companies is
substantially larger than the corres
ponding season a year ago, while the
express cr"equipment has-been mate
rially lessened through the necessity
of using baggage and express cars in
tioop-movement and the handling of
ether Government traffic.
The -express terminals in the larger
cities of the East have their limita
tions and many oi these terminals
are now handling their maximum
business. In order to utilize, termin
als and cars to their utmost capacity
it is requested that express patrons
assist the companfes by preparing
their express shipments as early in
the day as possible, thereby avoiding
congestion Jn the final pick-up. x
It is only by the closest co-operation
between express shippers and
the carriers, and mutual cqnsidera
tion of the difficulties confronting
each other, thatwe can minimize the
i estraints which" may have to be en
forced upon the customaryj'ustf of th$
usual channels of transportation.
