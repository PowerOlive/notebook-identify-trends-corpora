Catarrh
Catarrh is one of the most obstinate
diseases and hence the most difficult
to get rid of
There is but one way to cure it
The disease is in the blood and all the
prays washes and inhaling mixtures
in the world can have no permanent
effect whatever upon it Swifts Spe
cific cures Catarrh permanently for it is
the only remedy which can reach the
disease and force it from the blood
Mr B P McAllister of Harrodsburg
Ky had Catarrh for years He writes
I ould see no Improvement whatever
though I was onaUntlr treated with sprays
ana wasnes ana differ
ent inhaling remedies
in fact I could fel that
each winter I was worse
than the year previous
Finally It was
brought to my notioe
that Catarrh was a blood
disease and after think
ing over the matter I
aw It was unreasonable
m xoi to be eared by
-At vbieb niy
reached the surface 1
then decided to try
8 8 S and after a few bottles were used I no
ticed a perceptible Improvement Continuing
the remedy the disease was forced out of my
system and a complete cure was the result
I advise all who have this dreadful disease to
abandon their local treatment which has never
done them any good and take 8 8 8 a rem
edy that can reach the disease and cure it
To continue the wrong treatment for
Catarrh is to continue to suffer Swifts
Specific is a real blood remedy and
cures obstinate deep seated diseases
which other remedies have no effect
whatever upon It promptly reaches
Catarrh and never fails to cure even the
most aggravated cases

is Purely Vegetable and is the only
blood remedy guaranteed to contain no
dangerous minerals

THE CHARM CAME BACK f
a Story of Witchcraft In Engrlaud Is
the Seventeenth Century
Here is a story of witchcraft The
lord chief justice Holt of England
who flourished in the aeventeeuth cen
tury told it of himself As a young
man perhaps more sprightly than
some he found himself once in the
country without any money He went
however boldly to the first roadside
Inn and ordered bed and board Dy
the fireside he saw a girl shivering
with ague Why let your child suf
fer he asked I will cure her for
you In a single night Thereupon he
wrote certain characters on a slip of
paper rolled It up In a cloth and told
the girl to He that round her neck and
to go to bed and in the morning she
would be well This she did Well
did she rest and in the morning she
was well
Holt stayed a few days at the Inn
and on his departure boldly asked for
his bill Sir said the hostess it Is
I who owe you not you who owe me
So he departed Forty years after
ward being on circuit he had to try a
woman charged with sorcery and
witchcraft She healed siek persons
miraculously and tl refore by the
help of the devil Being questioned
she acknowledged that she used a
charm which generally worked a cure
Let me look at it said the Judge
She handed him a small cloth roll
Within it he found a paper with cer
tain characters Then the memory of
his trick came back to him
You were yourself he said once
cured of an ague by the use of this
charm
She said that was so Then he turned
to the jury and related the whole story
and dismissed the poor old woman
But as for the charm the court im
pounded it and the poor witch lost her
power Detroit News
SHORT ON GOOD STORIES
The Predicament of a Woman With
Seven Calls to Make
Seven visits to make in one after
noon Well 1 think 1 can manage it
Some of them may not be at home
and I can make an early start Let me
see Theres that anecdote about Eth
els fox terrier and the cute speech of
little Bob and that awfully clever
thing that Dexter told the other night
about the Goddess of Liberty Is that
all 1 have in stock Oh dear no
Theres that quotation from The
Pneumatic Woman that struck me
so I havent got it off to any one yet
and I dare say it will go as original
Not one person in ten has heard of
The Pneumatic Woman
Is that enough for seven calls Im
afraid not Well theres always the
weather Really if it came to the
point Id rather talk interestingly
about any old subject than stupidly
about a brand new one Theres more
art in it I wonder if I dare risk that
joke about Clara again Ive told it
so many times lately indeed I wont
be sure that seme of the times were
not at the very places Im going
How mean it is that Maude made
me promise not to repeat that lovely
bit of gossip she gave me this morn
ing I havent heard anything so de
licious for a long time Well with a
sigh I promised on my word of hon
or 1 wouldnt tell and another sigh
why here we are at Mrs Some
bodys I wonder if 1 have enough to
talk about for seven calls Oh well
some of them may be out and oh
dear if I only hadnt promised
Maude Cincinnati Enquirer
Wholly Discouraged
No maam I dont like em said
Mr Cumrox with c mphasis Im free
to say these dialect stories makes me
tired Half the words In cm aint In
the dictionary
But you might cultivate a liking for
them said his wifes sister It is
something like music Yon may not
have much of an ear for it at lirst but
if you keep at it you will soon appre
ciate it
Well maybe I will some day but
Id rather have something solid lid
like to begin on some of y youngest
girls school books and go right
through em Thats the sort of read
ing that Id enjoy spending time on
He picked up one of his daughters
books which happened to be lying
near It was a copy of Virgil which
ins daughter had been translating into
English lie stared solemnly at the
first page of the Latin epic for awhile
and then slowly turned the leaf When
his eyes had got down to the middle
of the next page he laid the volume
down with a sigh
Its no u be exclaimed regret
fully
What is of no use
My trying to read dialect And 1
must say that this thing of oaehin
It in the public schools strikes me as
plaguy foolishness Washington Star
Champion Trouble Borrower
1 have known a good many borrow
ers of trouble said the man with the
glasses but the worst case I think la
that of a friend of mine who has pick
ed out his own pallbearers and made
them all promise that they will Insist
upon having probes stuck into him be
fore he is buried so as to be sure that
he is really dead
That is an aggravated case replied
his companion but 1 know of one that
beats it The wife of a poet of my
acquaintance is worrying because he
may get rich and go out in society
where they will flatter and spoil him
