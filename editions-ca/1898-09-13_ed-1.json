FINALLY HEART TROUBLE
Sestored to Health by Dr Miles Nervine
EDWARD HARDY tho jolly man
ager of Sheppard Cos great store at
Braceville 111 writes I had never
been sick a day in my life until in 1890 I
got so bad with nervous prostration that I
had to give up and commence to doctor I
tried our local physicians and one in Joliet
tut none gave me any relief and I thought
I was going to die I became despondent
and suffered untold agony I could not eat
sleep nor rest and it seemed as if I could
not exist At the end of six months I was
reduced to but a shadow of myself and at
last my heart became affected and I was
truly miserable I took six or eight bottle9
at Dr Miles Nervine It gave me relief
from the start and at last a cure the great
est blessing of my life

THE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY5 TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 13 1898
A Tricky Butcbor
The greatest business mind I ever
ran up against was possessed by the
former proprietor of a meat market out
in Germautown said a street car con
ductor he other day as his car was
waiting on Front street This butcher
had a line squeaky voice which you
could hear a block away Tricky Yes
thats just what you would call it I
used to watch him sometimes when
he was waiting on customers and it
was positively amusing to see the ap
parent ease with which he would make
a two pound steak weigh apparently
three or more pounds
He would take a couple of pounds
of meat and throw it on the scales so
that the pointer would show four pounds
and then take it off before the scales
could register the true weight Theres
just four pounds exactly he would say
to the customer in that squeaky voice
of his and then continue with the state
ment quickly made Four times 12 is
58 Call it 60 and unless tho customer
was watching him closely he would al
ways get even change
He was in the meat business only a
few years and amassed a competency
Then he left it What worries me is
how he is going to get along now I un
derstand he is in the real estate business
and I wonder how he works it when he
sells a piece of land The scales wont
help him much there Philadelphia
Record
The Only Time There Waa
The necessity that there shall be only
one man who has the say in a mili
tary command is thoroughly recognized
in the United States army A story is
told of General Shafter which illus
trates the punctilio of the regulars in
this regard
At a certain frontier post at which
Shafter who then held an inferior rank
was commander many years ago a dis
cussion arose among several officers as
to the exact time of day A captain
with his watch in his hand said
It is now exactly 3 oclock
Oh no said a lieutenant By
my time its eight minutes past 3
A third young officer drew his watch
out of his pocket I know my time is
exactly right he said and my watch
says two minutes past 3
At this juncture Major Shafter looked
at his silver watch
I dont know what your watches
say he remarked but I wish you to
understand that in this command it is
five minutes past 3
Then the young officers remembered
that the authority of the commanding
officer extended even to the time of
day Youths Companion
A Useful Coffin
It may not be generally known- that
the Dutch Boers at the Cape especially
those living in remote districts where
material inexpensive and labor difficult
to obtain frequently purchase at least
on- coffin beforehand1 which is placed in
a conspicuous position in the vfior
kamer or principal sitting room sad
utilized as ass article of furniture fotf
ornament or as- receptacle for clothing
and other oddments-
Ob farmer -well known to the writer
possesses a beautifully finished article
of this sort which he purchased about
30 yearsago Jaring that period he has
buried three wives each of -whom had
to be content with cofiina of tlhe com
monest material and roughest workmanship-
while Mb- own awaiting its
possessor stands rai all ft luster of pol
ished teak and silver mountings
For the present the Id gentleman
uses it as a couch for hismidday nap in
order as- he sometimes remarks with
grave humor that SemaygetaGsustom

Why of course answered the

Too bad commented the matron

Why do you say that demanded

Oh I always hate to see young girls

So Kindly Considerate
Why is it the daring young man

Oh I keep her dressed that way
