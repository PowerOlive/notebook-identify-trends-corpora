Holding that the record of a gas me
ter must be accepted as conclusive ev
idence of the amount of gas consum
ed unless there was proof that the me
ter was inaccurate, County Judge
Frank A. Bullock, in Lexington, Wed
nesday afternoon gave judgment for
the defendant in all the cases but one
in which consumers last winter com
plained of their January bills, and sev
enteen of them filed suit in the Fay
ette court against the Central Ken
tucky Natural Gas Company for re
covery of what they considered the
excess over proper charges. The one
case in which Judge Bullock found
for the plaintiff was that of G. A. C.
Jones, who testified that his house
had not been occupied at al during
the month for which the bill was ren
dered, and therefore no gas whatever
had been consumed. Nothwithstand
ing this he had received a bill $1.48.
CARD OF THANKS.
In retiring from business we take
this method to extend our a sincere
thanks to the many residents of Par
is and vicinity who so very liberally
extended to us their patronage while
we were engaged in the retail gro
cery business. We certainly appre
ciated their favors and endeavored in
every way to merit their confidence
by giving them the best values to be
obtained for the money.
We recommend to you our success
or, Mr. N. A. Moore, who we are as
sured will promptly supply your
needs, and will be pleased to receive
your trade at the old Sauer stand
opposite the court house.
Respectfully,
JOHN SAUER.

SACRED CONCERT WILL MARK
OPENING OF THE CARNIVAL.
The Littlejohn Carnival Co., which
will play an engagement in this city
during the week of May 25, always
carries an excellent band which will
furnish the music for the entire week.
The carnival will be formally opened
on Sunday afternoon when a sacred
concert will be given in front of the
court house, and this feature should
prove highly entertaining.
Plans for the holding of the carni
val are shaping rapidly and an active
advertising campaign will begin next
week. The Eagles, under whose aus
pices the carnival ivill be given, are
anticipating a record breaking week.
The Littlejohn Carnival Co., carries
with it a number of the very high
class attractions and are said to be
the best that have ever gone out with
a carnival company. New attractions
are being added almost every week,
and none are accepted that are not of
the very highest order and clean in
every respect.
It has been decided to hold the car
nival in the city lot in the rear of the
public school, and arrangements have
already been made to secure the
grounds for the week.
