SCARED THE EED MEN
HOW A CROWD OF CATTLEMEN BROKE
I
i
UP A GHOST DANCE
t Soman Candlo Bombardment That
Stampeded the Throe Hundred Braves
and Started Them on a Bun That tast
ed Into the Kcxt Day
We never called Rooney by the
name of Jack although his Christian
name was John and in the cattle coun
try they waH few men named after
Christs chief disciple who was not
known as Jack We always called him
John Rooney The last I ever heerd of
him he were living up in Nebraska not
far from Onallala on the sonth fork of
the Platte just after the stream leaves
the Colorado line
Thus discoursed a former cattleman
who is now pursuing a peaceful and
commonplace life in Kansas City the
other evening He was talking of life
on the big cattle range in the days when
the fame of Dodge City Abilene Hayes
City and Ellis was on the wane as tough
towns of Kansas and their upbuilding as
law abiding communities had begun
In them days he continued our
openings for fun was less frequent than
national holidays are at present It was
mostly hard riding and lots of it It
gives us all a sorter yearning to bust
loose the cinches and raise hell at the
first opportunity and sometimes the
way we did it was as unique as they
was startling The time I speak of in
this pertickler yarn we was grazing a
big bunch of cattle mostly long horns in
the Cherokee strip along the north
fork of the Canadian river within a
days riding of old Fort Supply The
Osages and some other tribes used to
come in there for their green corn and
harvest dances and have highfallootin
ole times in general We all remarks
this and speaks of it sorter scornful be
cause we did not like Iujuns much no
how When I say this I dont mean
that Rooney was the one to put the
quirt to the Injuns He was overquiet
nn thfi TT Dnnnrfillv was npfino I
fullike and cam He was a thinker
Rooney was and with some schooling
and a little politics would have been a
great man in the city I low
About this time the camrj begins to
get short on grub and some four or five j
of the boys was sent to Medicine Lodge I
across the Kansas line with wagons to
bring back a supply of necessaries Kan
sas was not a prohibition state then
and you could get most any kind of
stimulant in Medioine Lodge that is
to say they had rye and Bourbon whis
ky and I suppose they also had beer
In them days I never could see the vir
tues of beer
As I was saying you could get
about any kind of liquor you wanted in
Medicine Lodge and so we kept pretty
well wet Rooney hre displayed his
sagacity While we all had forgotten
all about them pesky Injuns he comes
in one day we was to leave and puts in
to the wagon about 20 of them big ro
man candles that shoot ten times you
know each shot a big ball of yellow
red or bluish flame
What you going to do with them
Fourth of July fixings now we all asks
seeing as how it was getting closer to
Thanksgiving
Never you mind that said John
kinder winking his eye southeast
So we all was mighty curious during
the trip back to the Canadian but says
nothing A few days after wegets back
them Injuns begins gathering for a an
nual feast of some kind and then one
night they prepares fqr one of them
dances Of course all of the boys what
could be spared wanted off to see the
monkey business of them redskins
Then John Rooney he called a council
of war and unfolded the secret of tbem
roman candles what he bought at Med
icine Lodge He tells all the boys some
0 in number to stay with him an3
Pleads the way to the timber where the
ghost dance was going on We all takes
- one of them roman candles and no one
- speaks a word or coughs or makes any
loud signs
When them 800 braves was a tearing
up the ground and yelling at the height
of the dance we gets the word from
Rooney and lights up them candles
simultaneous and they begin shooting
lire and brimstone into them Injuns
sure enough The boys wasnt used to
shooting off tbem things and was about
-half scared theirselves at the devilish
hissing and the sparks but them Injuns
well I cant say what they thought
but it was plain how they acted Some
of em took to the other side of the
woods some jumped straight up a lot
went for the north fork of the Canadian
J sunning so fast it ud take four men to
see em Stop then Well I guess not
They jumped right in and swum for
dear life They never stopped to see
that the blamed fire had quit and fel
lers working on the range the other
side of the fork said they saw them
running the next morning when they
was just starting their days riding
That nights devilment like to got
us all into trouble though and the
most of us discreetly struck out for
Kansas to avoid any unpleasant conse
quences But laugh say I never laugh--ed
so in my life Kansas City Star

ENGLANDS PREMIER
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE THE BRITISH
PRIME MINISTER -
Nowhere Else In the World Is There Any
Position at Once So Towerfnl and So
Anomalous The Office 13 Without Legal
Foundation
Nowhere else in the world is there
any position at once so powerful and so
anomalous So long as he remains
prime minister the premier of the Unit
ed Kingdom is possessed of more real
power than any single individual un
less it be the ozar or the president of
the United States
Yet great as is the power of prime
minister the office has no foundation on
law The prime minister is quite as un
known to the law as is the cabinet If
a legal pedant blind to all facts not in
the statutes or the textbooks of the
common law were asked to define the
office of prime minister and to describe
the cabinet he would be utterly at a
loss
In theory the prime minister is only
a privy councilor at the head of a de
partment of state who is specially in
the sovereigns confidence and who usu
ally presides at an informal gathering
of certain of the privy councilors who
happen to told offices of state a gath
ering which is called the cabinet That
is the furthest which the legal pedant of
our thought would dare to go Yet of
course the prime minister is in fact
far more than the mere chairman of the
cabinet
The cabinet no doubt has a great
deal of power but even if it were true
once it is certainly not true now that
England is governed by a committee of
15 or 16 persons
The prime minister as a rule makes I
his cabinet He is commissioned by the
queen to form a cabinet because he is
the man whom she considers to possess
the confidence of a majority of the house
of commons He forms his cabinet by
asking certain members of the two
houses to hold the great offices of state
He might do this in one day and with
out consulting any one
As a matter of fact what usually
happens is this As soon as the commis
sion to form a government has been re
ceived the prime miuihter takes into
his confidence the two or three who will
hold the chief offices and they talk
together over the other names When a
man is decided upon he as a rule
joins the conclave and helps to consult
as to men and places and so the cabinet
gradually evolves itself No doubt as
generally happens in this world the
prime ministers chcice is never really
free
Certain men must be in the cabinet
whatever happens and hence they may
be said not to be chosen by the premier
but to be ministers in their own right
In spite however of this the fact tha
they are asked to serve by the premier
Trmbpa thom fool h in snnarinritv Whom
the cabinet is made the theory of the P
unwritten constitution is that the cabi
net governs In reality it seldom does
anything of the kind
Each cabinet minister has very great
power in bis own department but the
cabinet as a cabinet can do little Since
however it knows everything that is
gofmg on it can exercise a great deal of
indirect power The previous knowl
edge that the majority of the cabinet
would like or dislike a particular pol
icy kas a great influence butr still the
cabinet does not rule The prime minis
ter summons presides over and largely
controls the cabinet meetings If a va
cancy occurs he fills it up and so can
promote- from the lower to the higher
offices
Then be can and does confer with his
colleagues in regard to the business of
their departments and so has a hold
upon tbawhole machine of government
Sir Robert Peel saw every member- of
his cabinetrseparately every day Again
if there be a difference between two
other members of the government the
premier decides If there be an irrecon
cilable difference between himself and
a minister it is the minister and not
the premier who resigns
Lastly the prime minister can fcyre
eigning himself dissolve the whole min
istry These things small in them
selves taken together make the prime
ministers position what it is Ho
makes and can unmake a cabinet He
presides ever it and he has the right
to advise in regard to every department
though this right is of course seldom
exercised and he has secured to him
beforehand the support of the rank and
file or of any cabinet if it comes to a
struggle between him and a colleague
because the rank and file know that if
the premier is beaten he has it in bis
power to upset the whole machine of
government
Hence the voices of those who want
to keep in office are always found on
the side of the premier Pearsons
