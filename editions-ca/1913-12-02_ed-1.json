- "Little Boy Blue" at Lexington
At the Lexington Opera House,
Thursday and Friday, December i
and 5, Henry W. Savage, will offer the
internationally established success,
"Little Boy Blue,' At the head of the
presenting cast will "be found Otis
Harlan, who as Dupont, the French
detective, the character which he
originated and played through the
long New (York engagement, has
scored the crowning success of an ex
ceptionally distinguished career as a
comedian.
The story of "Little Boy Blue" has
no connection with tne rhyme of our
nursery days, and the piece is not an
extravaganza. It is comic opera,
pure and simple, comic opera at its
best and the biggest.
The first act setting is among the
midnight splendors or the famotis
Bal Tabarin, in Paris, one of the most
famous resorts in the world. The
second and third show the heather
olad fastnesses and the ancient cas-
'tles of the Scotch Highlands, giving
opportunity for the display of types
in kilt-clad clansmen, rugged gullies
and tartan maids. The tender melo
dies of the French school in the first
.-va ,vnv n , different order in
tne geCond, when the music takes on
another hue in the romantic skirling
of pipes and vigorous -chanting of
stirring Jacobite tunes.
Rppnirallv. the Droduction is su-
perb and it is doubtful if anything
in recent years can be compared with
the offering in the matter of cos
tumes. In addition to Otis Harlan com
pany includes Vivian Wessell, Thos.
Burton, Elizabeth Goodall, Frederick
Lyon, Pearl Palmer, Rollin Grimes,
and a sparkling chorus. A splendid
grand opera orchestra is carried by
the company.
