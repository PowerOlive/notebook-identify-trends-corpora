REDWARD HARDY the jolly man
ager of Sheppard Cos great store at
Braceville 111 writes I had never
been sick a day in my life until in 1890 I
got so bad with nervous prostration that I
had to give up and commence to doctor I
tried our local physicians and one in Joliet
bat none gave me any relief and I thought
I was going to die I became despondent
and suffered untold agony I could not eat
sleep nor rest and it seemed as if I could
not exist At the end of six months I was
reduced to but a shadow of myself and at
last my heart became affected and I was
truly miserable I took six or eight bottles
of Dr Miles Nervine It gave me relief
from the start and at last a cure the great
est blessing of my life K5KSS3jSS

THE KING SNAKE
DOES HARM TO NO ONE BUT KILLS
POISON REPTILES
Jlattlers and Copperheads Are the Prey
Ho Loves to Tackle He Eats a Mouse
or a Toad Alter Each Battle to Prepare
Him For the Next Encounter
The distant murmur of the waterfall
the hum of the bees among the flowers
made me feel lazy and laying aside
my fishing rod I stretched myself on j
the soft spring grass under a weeping
willow and watched the blue cloud
specked sky I had almost fallen asleep
when I was aroused by a voice inquir
ing Kotched euny fish mister
Looking up I saw a typical moun
taineer and assured him I had not
1 say mister this here is a power-
i ful bad keutry fur snakes One bit Jim
bioan s nay mare last mgnt an week
afore last another bit Sally Milligan
Some on em air powerful pizen spe
cially the rattlers an coppers an that
minds me ef I wuz yerself Id move
a little further from that ere copper
He aint zactly perty to look at an ef
ye wuz to rile im with yer boot he
mout git vicious
Long before that speech had ended 1
had turned a somesault backward which
caused the mountaineer a great deal of
genuine pleasure to behold I was about
to exterminate the big slmggish reptile
with a stick that I had seized when my
companion asked me to wait a few mo
ments as a king might come along
Not exactly understanding whether
he expected a person of that name and
failing to see what that event had to do
with my laudable desire to smash the
big ugly thing that had presumed to
take my leg for a pillow I asked him
for an explanation
Air it possible yer town folks dunno
what a king air Why a king air the
boss snake uv the woods He dont do
no harm to nuthin ceptin snakes an
he dont pester them as haint pizen
out he do love a copper an a rattler
which is the wurt snakes uv these dig
gins an hes death on em
Tother day I w nz gwine long a old
road an all uv a sudden 1 heerd a singin
as though a camp meetm had just tuck
in I kuowed it wuz a rattler an lookiu
round I saw kim on a knoll an a pow
erful big uu he wuz Ho wuz quilled up
like a corkscrew an his rattles wuz
a makin tho air jingle But at first I
couldnt scover the cause an I knowed
a rattler never got ready fur business
fur nothin Presently I seed the grass
a swayin an a bendin an then the rat
tler he gets nervius an skeered an un
quillin hisself ho made a break to run
But it wuz too late fur on came the
king like a hurricane an puttin hisself
just ahead the rattler showed him his
jig wuz up Seein he couldnt scape
the rattler quilled agin an showed
fight The king he commenced to run
round his inimy in a wide circle the
xattler watchin lickin out his tongue
an makin his rattle sing lika attlafper
Closer an closer the king drawed his
circle as he dashed round until he
wnznt moren ihree feet from the ini
my
Then the rattler he saw
the last show to save his bacon made a
powerful spiteful lunge at the king
an thar is whar he slipped up fur the
king he dodged an qnickern gunpow
der wuz on to the rattler Thar wuznt
nothin but a ball uv snakes in sight fur
a few minutes as they fought an tus
sled over the grass but arter a little I
could see the red an hlack striped king
wound- round the big rattler just like
a grapevine on a tree
Then I seed the king hold iin by
the back- uv the neck an I could hear
him crushin the rattler as he tightened
on him It wuz all over in half an hour
an the king unwindin hisself from his
victim got behind an waited fur ten
minutes Then he crept up an put his
nose on the rattlers to see if he wuz
breathin Ye see other snakes know
the king an sometimes possum on him
by pretend in to be dead
But the rattler wuz shore nuff gone
an when the king wuz satisfied uv this
he crawled in a old stump hole an
presently came out with a mouses tail
stickin out his mouf But he soon
swallowed the mouse an wipin his nose
on tho grass went off sarchin for more
trouble A king allers eats a rat or a
toad after a fight to make him strong
fur the next un
An now mister I could tell ye a
powerful lot moren that fur I knows
snakes I do but Ill help ye kill the
copper which mout not meet a king
until he bites some un ef we didnt aa
then I must hurry on after my oxen
what I wuz huntin when I seed that
varmint a tryin to go to sleep with
yerself Philadelphia Times
Cleanliness
One of tho most important factors in
maintaining health in good order is
cleanliness It is comprised1 in measure
that tend to keep the organs clean and
in proper order to perform all their
functions The cleanliness of the skin
and the air purity of the air that we
breathe in are essential for the proper
keeping of ones health Any impurities
that are taken in breathing find their
way to the blood and thus serve so
many centers of disease and are the
cause of many infectious diseases
Again if the skin is not kept olean the
impurities that are to be seoreted are
unduly accumulated in the blood and
tend to give rise to severe and often
dangerous disorders such as skin dis
eases and blood poisoning New York
