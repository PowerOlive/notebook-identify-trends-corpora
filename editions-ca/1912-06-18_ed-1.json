King McNamara Captured.
After being a tUKitive from justice
for thirteen years, John H. ("Kiny")
McNamara, charged with the murder
of former Parisian Jacob S. Keller: in
Lexington, was arrested' Friday in
Louisville by Sheriff Dan W. Scott, of
Fayette county.
The arrest of McNamara draws the
curtain on one of the most cold-blooded
crimes ever committed in Lexington.
Id February, 1899, McNamara shot
Keller, who was the Q. & G. ticket
agent in Lexington, at the corner of
Main and Limestone streets, and from
the effect of his injuries he died at
hospital a short time afterward.
McjNamara, who naa oeen released on
bond, made his escape shortly after
the death of Keller, and has since been
at large. His capture has been report
ed several times, but each time the
prisoner under arrebt proved to be the
wrong man.
McNamara was taken into custody
at tne fceeioacn Hotel -as he was
entering the elevator, by Sheriff Scott.
and returned to Lexington, where he
is now confined in the county jail. His
capture was effected through infor
rnation gaind by the'Lexington officials
from a female detective-in Louisville
who had been working on the case. It
is said that McNamara had.been hiding
in Louisville for several years.
Jacob S. Keller, who loat his life at
the hands of McNamara, formerly
resided in this city, and was a son of
the late Dr. David Keller. He was
the first cousin of Dr. A. H. Keller,

Harbeson Concert Tonight.
jf ernaps ic is noc too mucn- to say
that no vocalists who have ever ap
peared in Paris, have more admirers
than Miss Mary Dan Harbeson and
her brother, Mr. Robert Harbeson
who will give a concert at tha Meth
odist church this evening.
Mr. Harbeson has appeared only
once before a raais audience, bu
those who heard him on that occasion
was delighted with his pure, rich
baritone voice, ana with the power
and beauty of his singing.
Miss Harbeson was first heard here
in the series of meetings conducted
by Rev. Frank Wright, the Indian
evangelist, at the Presbyterian church
ana the sweetness ana expression
with which she rendered the gospel
songs, so thrilled and charmed the
audience, that much of the success of
the meeting was due to her efforts,
and her popularity was fully estab
lished. Later, this talented sister and
brother were heard in concerb, and
the melody and beauty of their blend
ed voices, coupled with their charm
ing personality, Avon for them the
first r lace in the hearts of all lovers
of music who heard them. One of the
cheir attractions of their singing is
the clearness of their articulation,
every syllable being distinct and full
of expression. The singers will be
accompanied this evening by Miss
Frances Johnson, one of the most
talented pianists of our city.
The concert will be for the benefit
of the Methodist Sunday school and
the auditorium should be crowded to
the utmost capacity to help the
children pay their subscription to the
building fund of the church, and to
express the admiration and apprecia
tion of the Paris people for these ac
complished musicians. Admission 50
cents.
Showers Help Crops.
The drought which has prevailed in
this section for the past several weeks
has been broken by the fall of copious
showers in the past few days. The
dry wather worked considerable
hardship upoji the farmers whose
cr -ps were rapidly succumbing for
the want of nt-eessary moisture', and
until rain relie.ed 6he situation agri
culturists were b3Comihg very appre
hensive. Tobacco planted in good
ssason tvas su-lfored to no small de
gree for the wait of a good s.oakingj
ram and the recent showers. x have
greatly benefited he plants.

sale Thursday, at 10 o'clock-, of the

miles of turnpike it worked-perfectly
and tujfned out severabcrops of hem

McQonnell, Jr.. he broke. a crop of 30
acres in 45 hours; for J. N. Camden' 50
acres in 6 3-4 days, and for Rout Cleve-
and six acres in one day.
Besides turning out hemp in such
time the machine handles all grades of
the fiber,, many of which by the- hand
methods, of breaking are allowed to go
to waste. In a few days Mr. O'Neal
will leave for the East where he will
have constructed several more of the
machines, one of which will be placed
n operation in this county. Mr.
O'Neal plans to take at least three of
his machines to the Southern part cf
California, where a hemp similar to
that grown in Kentucky grows wild.
The texture of the fiber of wild pro
duct, -while not quite as fine as that
cultivated in Kentucky, answers sever
al purposes, but great difficulty has
been experienced in getting it on the
market.
The invention of Mr. O'Neal has had
the effect of stimulating j;he growth of
hemp. irT Central Kentucky and iarmera
who for several years have abandoned
its culture will sow a large acreage
this year, now that there is a visible
means of getting their product on the
market without the'many vexations of
the hand-breaking machines, and the
scarcity of men to operate them. Be
sides they will be enabled to get their
product on the market several months
sooner than heretofore.
A Rare Opportunity.
Attend 'the Master Commissioner's
sale Thursday, at 10 o'clock, of the
Massie lots on Scott avenue and Massie
Street. Eleven beautiful building lots
will le offered. Terms 6, 12 and 38

Former Blue Grassers in Trouble
Three former Blue Grassers who are
withthe Battle Creek, Mioh... club, are
in serious trouble, according to news
paper accounts that have been receivd
here. "Spike" LaRoss, formerly of
Winchester, is under suspeneion, Calla
han, formerly of the same club, is like
ly to be suspended, while Ed MeKer
nan, who managed the Paris team two
seasons, is likely to be down on the
carpet with another of the Battle
Creek players. According to the
story, LaRoss was fined by an umpire,
who, when about to leave Bay City,
where the trouble took place, was ask
ed by McKernan if the fine was going
to stick. Upon being informed that it
was McKernan is said to have gone
away and returned with LaRoss and
Callahan. The former accosted the
arbiter, slapped him in the face while
the other men stood by and looked on
without making any effort to stop the
scrap. The president of the Southern
Michigan League fined LaRoss and
set him down for n indefinite period
and is now investigating the case of
McKernan and Callahan.
