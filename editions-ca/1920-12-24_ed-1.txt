Despite hiseccentricities, Col. Craddock was aman of generous impulses and was alarge contributor tc charity. Everybody in Paris and Bourbon countyknew Col.

Many of the old peopleat the infirmary are practicallyfriendless with no one to remembrthem at this glad reason, and whilei a bountiful dinner is always provided for them by the authorities, yetit means so much to them in theirloneliness to know that they are notentirely forgotten by the outsideworld.

Are You Able To GetThings Done?Truth U That the Hours of SlumberCan Be Made Subservient tethe Firm Will.Sleep, at the right time, is one ofman's foremost friends and benefactors; at the wrong time it is a curse,for it comes as the paralyzing incubusupon his hand and his mind when heshould be broad awake and at his work,declares a writer in the PhiladelphiaLedger.It is a solemn thing to think about,that if we average eight hours of everytwenty-four in slumber we are in theLand of Nod for a third of our wholeterm on earth. At this rate the manwho lives to the age of 60 has spenttwenty years in bed.It has made some active spirits irateagainst nature and the establishedorder that they should have to spendso much time unconscious and unproductive; the idleness has irked them;aud burning the candle at both endsIn their defiance of physiological lawsthey have generally paid for it. Therule is that we rest nofthat we mayform habits of sloth and self-indulgence,but that we may find recreationand recuperation for the day that follows night the day that tests our mettle, and urges to endeavor. Sleep issupposed to send us back Into the frayclear eyed, serene, corroborated. "Iclimb when I lie down," said thatpoet of the mystics, Henry Vaughan,and by it he meant that his finitemortality had risen star by star till ithud hold upon infinity. The apparenthumility was an aspiration. He stoodat heaven's gate not by the pride oflife, not by self-assertion, not by being egocentric, but in the mortificationof vanity and with all "chasteningand subduing of the soul."Mark Twain and Robert Louis Stevenson uere two of no small number ofwriters who wrote in bed because ofthe comfortable relaxation and the iseclusion. The wits of neither werebenumbed, and you could not calleither of these prolific and successfulauthors lazy. But it does not followthat their mimic in respect to a recumbent posture for authorship will succeed in copying their happy graces inthe way of a literary style.The strong man seeks a workroom,not a resting place. He stays at worktill his work is done. He trains himself with an Edison not to let himself sleep till he has tracked the shyidea he is hunting to its lair. Menwho have followed an engineeringcaieer afield men who have fought awar men -who have sailed a shipthrough a storm men of action in alltimes and places can (If they will)tell us how they have made sleep subservient to their own Iron wills.
