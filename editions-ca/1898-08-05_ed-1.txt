DaytonElectric Stret Railway CoU0 AGREEMENT ARRIVED ATSpanish Cabinet Asks Information onPoints in the P ace Terms Not Clearto the Miimt rsWashington Aug 4 After a conference on the peace question lastingfor just an hour Wednesday afternoonbetween the president and M Carabonthe French ambassad6r the latter acting as the representative of SpainSecretary Day emerged from the whitehouse and announced that Wednesdays conference was inconclusivewherefore the parties to it had agreedto say nothing publicly as towhat had occurred The secretary did not appear to bediscouraged as he made this statement though he admitted that no timehad been set for another conferenceFrom this it is gathered that the longexpected answer of the Spanish government to the presidents note uponbeing received had turned out to bejust as it was expected either acounter proposition or a requestfor a fuller statement in detailupon some of the heads of thepresidents note Up to the middle oithe afternoon it was stated by all parties concerned that the Spanish answer had not been received that theonly formal note that had come tchand was one from the Madrid cabinet to M Cambon asking for information upon some points that were notclear to the Spanish ministers However just after 3 oclock the secretary of the French embassyM Thiebaut called at the statedepartment and arranged withSecretary Day for a meeting betweenthe president and the ambassador assoon as possible The meeting wasset for 345 oclock and Secretary Daywas at the white house in season butwas obliged to wait about ten minutesfor the French ambassador As already stated after conferring foran hour the parties separatedhaving been unable to reach a conclusion as to the acceptance by Spain ofthe peace conditions laid down by thepresident and binding themselves tothe observance of the strictest secrecyas to the proceedings until furtherprogress had been made Thus it ispractically assured in advance thatany attempt to state what occurred atWednesdays meeting at the whitehouse will be nothing more than pureguess wrorkMeantime in consonance with thedeclared purpose of the president atthe beginning of the overtures thisconference is not operating to restrainmilitary operations in any degreeOrders went out Wednesday for a conference of leaders of the regiments toaccompany Gen Wade to Porto Ricorand within 24 hours some of the troops-for this expedition will be boardingthe transports at Newport News Itis felt that even should an armisticebe declared before these troopssee active service at the frontit will be beneficial for themto have made the trip for otherwisethere was danger of the morals of thetroops being destroyed through theircraving to get away from the big concentration camp and at least see theshores of Cuba or Porto Rico Profiting by its last experience Gen Wadesexpedition is going to be the mostcomplete in details of any that haveyet left our shores and the soldierswill be protected in their health andcomfort to the utmost degree Secretary Alger himself has conductedan inquiry into the conditions thatled up to the fearful experience of thewounded soldiers who returned to theUnited States on the Concho and hehe has taken the necessary steps toprevent a repetition of the bad management exhibited in that caseThus there may be some delay in getting the troops away with GenWade in view of the determinationto have everything ship shape beforethe men are on board and as thetransportation department was takensomewhat by surprise by the suddenlyannounced decision of the secretary

impossibleto believe all that we -hear about thetrouble with the miners they seemsuch respectable men when you meetthem She stopped in confusion andlooked at Darcie helplesslyAre you excuse me are you aminerVer3r much so Darcie answereddropping his eyesHer own glance fell and lighted upona brown sinewy hand resting upon thetable a hand that looked as if it mighthave been familiar with golf stick

workYes only Mike does rather more ofit than IdoDarcies face wore such an odd embarrassed defensive expression thatMiss Bingham laughed out loud a sudden girlish peal that sent light shiversthrough the young- mans nerves thenas suddenly her eyes brimmed up withtears She leaned a little toward himand asked confidinglyWhere is my jfatherHe is in bed L assure you hes quiteused up you knowShe sighed I believe I cant eat anysupper thanks so muchOh do wont you try I know thestuffs abominableNo it isnt at all its very nice Butif you had anything- to tell me youwould tell me wouldnt youUndoubtedly

very fewpeople of course because Im a tenderfoot myself but my father knowseverybody All the menwho come fromthe east with letters you knowsooner or later always visit the mineThis is very absurd of me Theresreally no reason- why I should insistupon accounting- for you But if youare from the other side you may knowsome of our Big- Horn people Some ofthem are very swell I believeI know a good many people on theother side who are not swell Darciereplied evasivelyBut do you know any one of our syndicate the girl persisted Of coursewe think everybody has heard of theBig Horn who has ever heard of theCoeur dAleneExcuse me said Darcie clumsilyI think your shoes are too close to thefire Its a great bore I cant be accounted for in the usual way he continued on resuming his seat still thechances are Im better as a riddle without the answer The answer is sure tobe stupid Let us assume that you haveplaced me even if you have misplacedme a trifle it can do no harm for onenig ht And it may give

confidence on the part of an interestingcertainly but rather inexplicable young strangerQuite so I mean temporarily Yourfather hes quite well but as Ive toldyou hes unconscionably tired It wouldbe positive cruelty to ask him to turnout again to night Im taking forgranted out of modesty I assure youin view of our accommodations thatyoud rather go homeWe must both go home said MissBingham rising quickly I cant imagine why you should think my father isnot ableBut he imagination was assisting hervividly at that moment and painfulprescience born of unyouthful experience was shedding its light upon Darcies remarkable proposition arid theawkwardness of his reasonsI did not say he wasnt able hedesperately interposed hes fortyfathoms deep in sleep Why drag himout when Im so entirely at your service Thats a brute of a horse of hisfor mountain workWhat Colonel Why hes a perfectrocking chairI mean getting chilled you knowHes a heavy man in the saddle Heshes not very used to riding is heWhy he never walksPray have a little considerationI must see if he is wellButBut this is the very excess of consideration Please let me speak to myfatherDarcie retreatedto the- fire with agestureof despair to Mike who madea sudden clatter with his saucepanswhile Faith under cover of the shadowat the far side of the cabin satisfiedherself as to her fathers conditionMike was right in assuming that shehad seen him that way beforeOh this is too much confessed toherself the heartsick girl I think hemight have spared me this And thosepoor things trung -to keep it from mewith their silly excuses Of coursethey must know what ails him Whatshall I do Im certain they dont wishme to stay he all but asked me to goand no wonder they have enoughwithhim on their hands Yes I must goback and stop the inquiries at the mineI must tell a few more lies No I willnot cry They shall not know that Iknow I will be as innocent as theythink meShe had remained some time hy theside of the bed long enough to gaincontrol of herself as she thoughtWhen she came forward into the lightthe hot color burned in her cheeks herhead was high her eyes Wide andbrightShe takes it beautifully thoughtDarcie scarcelj permitting himself tolook at her but who knows how shetakes it when she is alone with itYes I think I had better go back tothe mine said Faith coldly if ifeither of you gentlemen will take meMy father

asthisI may say Ive never heard of anything else said Darcie recklessly thething is so commonOh but not like thisWhy if its possible at all theresno reason it shouldnt happen anywhereor anyhow Its not a matter of intention and its the commonest accidentin the worldThat makes it so much betterflashed the girl with a glance of herproud hurt eyesI mentioned the fact nierelyI would be ashamed to mention itif I did I would call it--what it isDarcie smiledYou call it an accident just to comfort me as we all lie to one anotherabout a disgrace that cannot be hidIt does not comfort me much to be toldthat all men are so liable and all women her lips quivered Why this ismy father She broke down and hidher facePresently Darcie said gentlyYou take it so much too hardI take it hard that you should expect me to take it any other way shecried with passionate explicitnessAre English women so philosophicalAh we cannot discuss itI should think not when my heartis breaking with it She drew in herbreath quickly stifling a sob MrDarcie she whisperedDear Miss Bingham There was apause Faiths eyes searched his faceand Darcie trembled looking down Hewas very handsome standing beforeher on his manhood under her puretesting eyes but she saw now onlywhat she was seeking for the truth inhim though she might have been helpedby the outward shape of him to perceive the truth She was not less achild than other girls of her age notwithstanding the unhappy progress shehad lately made in worldly knowledgeWell she said at last you knowme better in this one hour than mydearest friends at home

of Cuba Cession of Porto Pticoand One Ladronc IslandUnited States to Control City Bay andHarbor of Manila Until Conclusion ofPeace Treaty Deciding Control of the PhilippinesWashington Aug 3 The cabinetwas in session an hour and ten minutes Tuesday There was no important action taken so far as could belearned but it was decided to makepublic a statement of our terms ofpeaceThe following is an official statement given out by authority of thepresident Tuesday as to the terms ofpeace offered by the United StatesIn order to remove an3 misapprehension in regard to the negotiationsas to peace between the United Statesand Spain it is deemed proper to saythat the terms offered by the UnitedStates to Spain in the note handed tothe French ambassador on Saturdaylast are in substance as followsThe president does not now put forward any claim for pecuniary indemnity but requires the relinquishmentof all claim of sovereignty over or titleto the island of Cuba as well as theimmediate evacuation by Spain of theisland the cession to the UnitedStates and immediate evacuation ofPorto Rico and other islandsunder Spanish sovereign ty in the WestIndies and the like cession of an island in the Ladrones The UnitedStates will occupy and hold the citybay and harbor of Manila pending the conclusion of a treatyof peace which shall determine the control disposition andgovernment of the Philippines Ifthese terms are accepted by Spain intheir entirety it is stated that commissioners will be named by the UnitedStates to meet commissioners on thepart of Spain for the purpose of concluding a treaty of peace on the basisabove indicatedThe United States cabinet half expected Spain to propose a counterproposition of terms but as they didnot conclude to do this but simply askfor more light on a certain point itwas a clear intimation that theywrere about to accept in a reasonable time our terms Ofcourse said the cabinet officer thisrequest for further explanation is onlyanother excuse for delay but it cannot be taken to mean procrastination No one expected Spain toaccept absolutely and at once thepresidents terms of peace Thatthey seem to hesitate on one pointonly if the dispatches are correctseems somewhat remarkable and whilethere may be a delay of a day or twoin giving a further explanation on theparticular point desired in my opinion if this is all an early agreementcan be easily reachedThanks the President and PeopleWashington Ang G The state department Tuesday received the following dispatch from Ambassador Whiteat Berlin Prince Herbert

the Stock Exchange the boys on the floor of theexchange are as superstitious as a lot ofsailors If you dont believe it you lookat the lead pencils they are using thonext time you are in the buildingYou wont find a man using a longlead pencil Why Because a long pencil is a 4 hoodoo of the worst kindThey always cut a new pencil in halfbefore they sharpen it Some of thesepencils acquire the reputation of beingluckyLess than a week ago I came downwithout my pencil which by the wayis a lucky one every memorandummade with that pencil results in a profitfor me and I borrowed one from afriend on the floor He handed me astump about an inch long and saidYou can use that its a lucky pencilSure enough I made two deals inthe morning and each netted me ahandsome profitI was about to make a memorandum of some stock I had bought whenmy friend approached and saidHere take this pencil and let mehave mine again Ive lost on everydeal since I loaned it to youSure enough I lost on that deal andthe luck went back to the owner of thepencilWhen you get hold of a lucky pencil you want to hang on to itSome of the boys have little luckypencils not more than an inch long andthey guard them as they would theirlivesIf you through carelessness or accident cause them to break the lead pointthey lose whatever regard they havefor you and forever afterward regardyou as inimical Some of them

poison of the honeybee have been asubject for long study by a German scientist Dr Joseph Zanger During hisinvestigation Dr Zanger employed 25000 bees Ho found that the fresh poisonis clear like water of an acid reactionbitter taste and of a fine aromatic odorOn evaporating and drying at a temperature of 100 degrees centigrade 212degrees F a gummy residue is left Itis soluble in water with alcohol itforms an emulsionlike mixture Thearomatic odor is due to a volatile substance which disappears on evaporationand is not poisonous The poisonousconstituent is not destroyed by shortboiling nor by drying and heating theresidue to 212 degrees F nor by the diluted acids or alkalisDr Zanger has proved the existenceof formic acid but he has also provedthat that is not the poisonous principleThe latter is an organic base solublewith difficulty in water but kept in solution by an acid On the healthy skinneither the tee poison nor a 2 per centsolution of the poisonous principle hasany effect but they act as powerful irritants on the mucuous membranesHis tests made on rabbits and otheranimals show that when the poison isbrought in contact with the eye therefollow lachrymation hyperemia chemosis and croupous membrane or conjunctiva The general condition it alsoaffected the animals become melancholy take no food but are very thirstyL and the urine shows small amounts ofalbumen

appearance of the neck The bill is longand slender with a powerful curvedtip for tearing fleshCarrion is the food of the turkeybuzzard though it will eat fresh meatand when in force will even kill smallanimals or birds But American soldiers in Cuba with their dead lying inthe thick underbrush know too wellwhat the approach of these vulturesmeans and for them the nauseousbirds form the chief horrors of thewar In a letter to a friend in this citjrwritten after the fighting at Baiquirione of the rough riders tells of watching the buzzards come and shooting atthem as they settled down to theirfeast One of his company he addswho fought as bravely as the best during the battle went into a sort of ahysterical fit at the approach of one ofthe birds and cowered from itcrying like a child

curious statement that the water supplyof that city is being obtained from thzsand dunes bordering the sea in thevicinity The dunes consist of sandblown up into ridges from the beachhaving a height near Haarlem of about20 feet and a width of about two and ahalf miles The fresh water they contain is supposed to come chiefly fromthe rainfall Not only is the water inthe dunes fresh above sea level

requires lime and the lime which mostashes contain is therefore an important benefit when they are applied to thiscrop The very best place to sow cabbage seed is where a brush heap hasbeen burned over a few weeks ormonths before The ashes have bythis time lost all of their caustic properties and make the soil light and mellow when mixed with it Such placeswill be free from weeds as the fire willdestroy most weeds within two inchesof the surface Either the burned soilor the ashes makes the cabbage lessable while small to attacks of the turnip fly American CultivatorThe Seeds in an AppleThere is no certain rule as to thenumber of seeds that any apple or forthat matter any other kind of fruitthat has more than one seed may contain There are individual peculiarities in trees even of the same varietyThe season also has something to dowith it as some years especially thosewhen there is much wet weather thapples all have a great many seedsThis perhaps suggests the reason Inwet

does not begin at rny set time sofar as the divisions of time divide theperiods of life but that it has to dowith that subtle agent known as thethe balance the vitality on the one sidewith the pathology on the otherThe indication of old age may be noticed by ocular inspection The figurestoops the walk is less elastic therounded figure gives place to the sparehabit of body the wrinkle of timemounts the cheek while the frost ofmany winters mantles the brow Thetypical healthy person who attains oldage is spare of body and old age emphasizes this fact by causing a paucityof adipose tissue So the wrinkle oftime after all is kindly in naturePhysiologically we notice that adiminution of the physical energy is accompanied by a corresponding diminution of the power to eliminate wastematerial from the body Elasticity andstrength give place to hardness andbrittleness of nearly all the tissues ofthe body The general health may begood because there is a harmoniousbalance between the action of the nervous system and the circulatory systemHowever the former is less responsiveto external stimulation and the latteris less vigorous in old age The vitalprocesses conducted by the circulationrespiration and metabolic changes inthe tissues are less active There arediminished adaptability of the wholesystem to changes in the environmentand less ability to meet the requirements of emergencies such as suddendemands of muscular and mental strainThe senile conditions and diseases arenumerous and obvious in the firstplace weakened digestion and assimilation The weakened vigor of the circulation and glandular system necessarilyweakens the power of eliminatingthe excrementitious substances whichgives rise to pernicious nutrition andthat in turn is the cause of the tendencyto develop malignant or benign growthsin different parts of the body in old ageThe strong tendency to overeat andunderdrink together with the naturaldecline of functional power gives riseto a condition of lithemia which is theprime cause of the majority of deathsin old age In the healthy state thatgreat glandular furnace and chemicallaboratory the liver is capable of transforming an excess of nitrogenous matterwhich may result from metabolism oftissue or exist in the food consumedinto the highly soluble excrement itioussubstance known as urea This excrement is eliminated from the bloodmainly by the kidneys and to a muchless extent by the skinNow in old age with the functionalpower and natural vitality on the wanetogether with the strong tendency toovertap this function of the liver wefind this waste is not converted intourea but into uric or lithic acid a- comparatively insoluble excrementitious andtoxic- substance which if it appears inthe blood in sufficient quantity and islong enough continued in circulationthrough- the urinary tubules sets up irritation and inflammation which inevitably impair the function of the renalepithelium and we find this poisonoussubstance is not eliminated from thesystem but accumulates in the bloodThis explains why old people arealmost universally troubled with diseaseof the liver kidneys bladder and prostate gland The unstable circulationatheromatous changes and brittlenessof the walls of the blood vessels withthe tendency to overtax the digestiveapparatus are the cause of many old people going to that bourn from whichno traveler returns by the apoplecticrouteHereditary diseases naturally manifest themselves when the vitality is below a certain level so we are not surprised to find certain dyscrasic andlatent tendencies manifesting themselves at this period of life wThen thenatural vitality is waning The diseasesmost frequently found to fcethe causeof dissolution among the aged are pneumonia diseases of the liver and urinaryorgans consumption cancer apoplexyand cancrenj The enemy to longevity the authorcontinues is- self indulgence Peoplewho have reached an advanced age mayj prolong their lives and

acquaintance with which t canvas that impressive episode theenables the analytical mind to become artist was not influenced by solelyproficient in prognosis by weighing in aginative caprice but that he has reproduced a scene in real liteThe facts are as follows The duelistswere M Jules Brame a former minister of public instruction under the second empire and M D D a wellknown journalist on the staff of one ofthe most influential newspapers in thenorth of France When the duel occurred both were studying for the barOne Shrove Tuesday they in companywith friends had repaired to a restaurant on the Boulevard with a view ofenjoying a good dinner and afterwardof going to the masquerade ball at theOpera They all agreed to go as Pierrots As they all wore masks some onesuggested that they should adopt somedistinctive sign by which they couldrecognize one another in the crowd DD suggested that they should pin a label bearing a number to their backsThe idea was unanimously adopted andD D prepared the labels accordinglyWhile so doing a diabolical idea cameinto his head It was carnival timeWhy should he not have his little jokeWhen it was Jules Brames turn tohave a ticket pinned to his back hisfriend D D had written in large lettersbeneath the number I am JulesBrame One can easily imagine whatwas the result No sooner had Brameset foot in the main passage to the premiere galerie than he was followed by alady wearing a mask who on his preparing to enter a private box cried putI wish you success Jules BrameLater on on re entering the passage hewas surrounded by a group of masqueraders who with one voice shouted outGood day my dear Brame Thatproved to him that he was known toevery one although he was puzzled tounderstand how it could bePassing in front of a box opener thegirl burst out laughing He inquiredangrily what she was laughing atWhy she replied I am laughingat the funny idea which led you to pina label on your back with your nameon it And suiting the action to theword she unpinned the label and handed it to himJules Brame considered the joke notonly in bad taste but insulting Hesought out his comrade and findinghim in the saloon he reproached himangrily in the hearing of the crowd insisting that he should apologize openlythen and there D D resenting hisfriends attitude toward him declinedto apologize A duel therefore in accordance with French habits and customs was inevitable Seconds were atonce- chosen Short swords were procured and in their Pierrot costumes theantagonists started for the Bois deBoulogne Fortunately the duel did notend fatally as seems to be the case inGeromes picture for although Brameran his- sword right through D Dsbody no vital organ was touched Herecovered very quickly and the two antagonists became fast friends
