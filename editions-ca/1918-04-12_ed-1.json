SAN ANTONIO PAPER COMPLI
MENTS PARIS PASTOR.
THE NEWS is in receipt of a
marked copy of The San Antonio,
Texas, Daily Express of Saturday,
April 6, sent by Mr. W.-S. Gillispie,
containing a complijmentary refer
ence to a lecture delivered at the Y.
W. C. A. in that city, on "The Ken
tucky Mountaineer," by Rev. George
R. Combs, pastor of the Paris Metho
dist church. Rev. Combs has been
assisting m a revival at the San An
tonio church, and was solicited by a
large number to give his lecture. Tho
Express says:
"Dr. G. R. Combs, of Paris, Ky.,
delivered his lecture, 'The Kentucky
Mountaineer," at the Y. W. C. A. au
ditorium Monday evening to an ap
preciative audience. At times tho
lecture was punctured with the
tragic and serious as the speaker
touched upon the famous and widely
known feuds which were so prevalent
in the mountains of certain counties
of that State for so many generation.
Then again he veritably swept his
audience along witb. him. as he por
trayed so vividly the joyous side of
the mountaineer's life; his log roll
ings, his corn shuckings and his fes
tival occasions.
"One of the most interesting and
entertaining parts of his lecture-recital
was the use of the banjo to pre
sent the manner of the mountain peo
ple as seen in their music, particu
larly that music which is of a light
a,nd joyous vein, even sometimes
reaching the stage of the 'quick and
devilish.'
"Dr. Combs is a native of BreaLh
itt county,- Kentucky, one of the mo5t
noted feud counties, and many mem
bers of his family fell in the feu(jr
first and last He knows his moun
tain people, and is well prepared to
give a picture of them to the world
in their true light.
"He is planning a tour of the North
and East for Chautauqua work this
summer. Hehas been booked for this
lecture in a series of three at Chau
tauqua, N. Y., the latter part of
July. While in this city he gave two
evenings of fun and entertainment to
the Kelly Field men."
While in San Antonio, Rev. Comb''
had a rather unpleasant experience,
haviner been mistaken bv an armv
guard for a spy while visiting' at
Camp Kelly, vhere he delivered his
lecture to the army men. Some timo
after leaving the platform, Rev.
Combs was strolling about the
grounds, taking kodak views of the
cantonment, which is mainly an avi
ation camp. He was taken in charge
by a guard and sent to camp head
quarters. Rev. Combs was able to
produce proof showing he was a min
ister, and that he was a thoroughly
patriotic American citizen and far re
moved from being a spy. He was re
leased with a warning not to in
dulge in kodaking in an army camp
in the future, as it is strictly 'prohib
ited everywhere.
Corporals Guard R. H. Donovan,
of Massachusetts, was the cadet who
took Rev. Combs in charge and con
ducted him to the military police
headquarters. When he discovered
who it was he had apprehended he
apologized very humbly. "You
needn't apologize," replied Rev.
Combs, "nothing has happened tr
me in many a day that has brought
me more real pleasure. It has shown
me that the military authorities are
more careful then. I thought, and,
personally, I would be glad if they
were even more strict than they now
are."
