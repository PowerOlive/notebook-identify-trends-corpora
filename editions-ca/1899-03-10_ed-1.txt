13500 TonsDisplacement -Contracts for TheseVessels and Six In armoredC ruiser to Be PlacedWashington- March 8 The plansfor the three big- battle ships authorized by the naval appropriation billjust passed are being- worked out Thegeneral features of the ships havebeen defined subject to the approvalof the secretary The battle shipswill be 1000 tons larger than theMaine and Missouri class of a totaldisplacement of 15500 tons makingthem by far the largest ship in thererican navy and about equal in dimensions to the best type of battle shipslow being constructed abroad under thenew practice Though larger than thoMaine the ships will be laid on almostthe same lines being only a littlegreater in every dimension They willcarry each four 12 inch guns in turretsThis caliber is an inch less than theguns carried by the Oregon but by improved design they will be almost equalin penetrative powerThe S inch guns of the Oregon typealthough they did very effective workat Santiago and Manila have beenabandonedBut instead of eight S ineh guns thenew ships will have no lef s than 16guns of G ineh caliber all rapid firersand 20 6 pounders This battery represents the ideal proportion betweenguns as taught by the experience ofour own fleets during the Spanish warand of the Chinese and Japanese vessels during their late war The speedof the ships will be 18 knots an advance of two knots over the Oregon class but just equal tothat of the new Maine Forprotection against the enemys shotthe battle ships will have but one beltof armor seven feet six inch broad running clear around the water line threefeet six fnches and four feet below Itwas originally planned to have thisarmor 16 inches thick but the designers have now reduced the thickness to12 inches This change was made inorder to strengthen the casementswhich will be made seven and a halfinches thick instead of five inchesAltogether there is a notable absence of new features in the designsof the battle ships which fact takenin connection with the small amountof progress reported in the designs forthe Maine class may be an indicationthat our naval designers have verynearly approached the ideal battle shipin their work As far as theseparticular ships are concerned thefact that the navy departmentis limited to X0 per ton in thepurchase of armor makes it impossible to build them in the absence of further legislation and thedepartment will be obliged to contentitself with the mere preparation of detailed plans during the coming summer The six cruisers of the unarrcored type provided for can howeverbe built and Chief Constructor ilichborn has already been working out thedesigns upon lines approved by thoboard of bureau chiefs It is the purpose of the navy department to placecontracts for these ships at the earliestmoment They represent a type ofcruiser which would be of the greatestvalue just now for our foreign serviceThe plans call for vessels of about2000 tons and the ships will be improved Marbleheads so to speak being000 tons larger than ships of thatclass and with better batteries andmore coal capacity A most importantconsideration is that they will besheathed with wood over the steelhull and fully coppered enablingthem to keep the seas evenin tropical waters for manymonths without being compelled toseek a dry dock The battery will bemade np of six five inch guns for eachship The cost is expected to be conislderably more than that of the Marblehead which was 074000 for theamount allowed by congress was 1141S00 each This difference is accounted for by the many improvementsmade in the Marbleheads design a notable thing being the use of water tubeboilers giving much greater speed andeconomyCounterfeit DollarsSijamokin Pa March 8 Banksstores and the post

Miss Huntington laid hertapering gloved hand on Hendrickssnow covered coatCan you give me one single bit ofhope she pleaded in a voice full ofquaversHendricks flushed to the eyesNot now not until I cant tellwhich way the wind will blow till I talkto Henri on a certain pointYou are so good and kind 6he saidhuskily If you do not restore him tous I shall always love you for tryingso hardThe restraint he had put on his feelings forced a sort of moisture into theeyes of the detective and when hewalked on after her he struck one of hisfeetagainst tihe otherand he almost fellHenri opened the doorI have come back Henri said MissHuntington These are good friendsof your masters The3 are trying toaid him You must freely tell them allyou knowHenri bowed and muttered his willingness to comply with her wish asthey passed him going into the reception-roomHendricks paused before a picture inoil standing- on an easel It representeda thin faced black eyed Italian womanbent almost to the earth under a greatload of rags and scraps of paper Beneath the picture was written the titleAmbitionXobody but a genius could have conceived that deep human lesson he saidto Lampkin who was at his elbow Itis just like that in life That womanis as ambitious in her way as a candidate for a throne and if she were toget 50 cents for her load she wouldbe as happy as a millionaire over a newyacht You waste time pitying pooripeople they would pity us if they hadthe timeThen drawing Henri into an adjoining room Gieiows sleeping apartmentHendricks closed the door carefullyDid vcur master leave anv of hislinen here he askedYes sir nearlj all of itHendricks deliberated a momentHenri he said finally I think itbarely possible that it may throw alittle light on our case for me to knowsomething about the sort of linen yourmaster wore Did he ever wear cuffsseparable from hrs shirt sleevesHe did sir It is not considered exactly gooil form by men of fashion butthose cuffs saved Mr Gielow a lot oftrouble You see when he wanted togive a touch to a piece of work whiledressed to go out or when he had justcome in he could detach the cuffs in aminute and have his hands free tohandle the brush without taking timeto get into his knockabout suitAh I see and do you suppose Henrithat you could identify one of his cuffsif it were shown to youI think so sir I didnt mark histhings but they were always launderedby the same people and they have awav of their own for marking the linenof a customerWhat is that asked Hendricks delaying the hand he had put into hispocket for the blood stained cuffThey had a different number foreach customer sir Masters numberhas been 12S6 for several years Illshow you Some of his things are in thenext roomWhen Henri had gone out the detective took out the cuff from his pocketand examined it He now saw w hat hehad hitherto regarded as a manufacturers trade mark the very numberHenri had mentioned Hearing theservant coming he quickly restored thecuff to his pocket and indifferently in-i spectcd the articles Henri spread on ai table1 am fully satisfied on that pointhe said Now I want you to give meall the information you can and if Iam able to bring him back he shallknow that you helpedBring him back gasped Henri paling Do you think if he was found thatit would go hard with himXo I do not answered Hendricksreassuringly The main thing now isto find himI didnt think they would blame himmuch when they know it all said theservant He was certainly out of hismindHendricks gave an impatient shrugI want you to tell me all you canabout this Count Bantinni What sortof man is heI never did like him sir He seemedto have such a strange influence overmy master I never could understandit We always knew his peculiar sortcf ring and master would make a facewhen he heard it But it wouldnt be aminute after they met till they wouldbe drinking and laughing together likeclose friendsHendricks face changed and a strangeeagerness lighted his pierciug eyesThat was queer he said tentatively Then as if weighing his nextquestion he paused for two or threeminutes Finally he askedDid the count seem to have that sortof influencs with anyone elseHe could make you do whatever hewished sir and youd never know youdid itYou are joking now said Hendricks but his eyes were blazing Howdo you know thisI was never more serious in my lifeair They amused themselves onenight by making me play the fool Itwas this way They called me into thestudio and master told me they weregoing to try a harmless experiment onme and that I must pay close attentionto the count and let nothing take mythoughts away Then the count heldup something bright before my eyesand kept shifting it about until all atonce I fell asleep or something happened for I never knew a thing till Ifound myself lying in the corner andthe count was telling me to wake upHypnotism involuntarily escapedthe lips of the detectiveHendricks stood tip quicklyDo you know of his ever having triedit on your masterNot to my knowledge sirHendricks went to a table and tearing a leaf from a notebook he wrotesomething hurriedly When he hadfinished it he folded it and gave it toHenriTake this to the Herald advertisingoffice he said It is very importantSee that it is inserted in the Personalsin the morning paper Be sure to haveit doneI shall not fail sirHenri reached for his hat and overcoatJust a minute said Hendricksthoughtfully There is one otherminor point Your master seemed to berather sensible about his dress I presume he wasnt one of those fellowswho let their fingernails grow long andhave them manicured to pointsNot him answered Henri I heardhim making sport of the count for thatverv tilingHendricks glanced inditVerentlv out Jof the windowWas the count did he wear hisnails that wayHis lingers was almost repulsive sirYou maty have noticed that he is almostas dark as a mulatto and with themlong hooked nails he was anything buta pleasant sight I have never understood as I said how master couldIf vou cannot leave the studio interrupted the detective I will takethat to the office myself indicatingthe scrap of paperOh I can go sir We often leavethe studio

YOU GIVE ME ONE SINGLE BIT OFHOPEsat exchanging desultory remarks Thedoctor noticed a strange fixity in the detectives eyes and wondered what wascoming as Hendricks advanced slowlyand stood before Miss HuntingtonYou are a very courageous youngwoman he said I have been deliberating whether I could reveal something to you of rather an unpleasantnatureMiss Huntington stared steadily andfolded her gloved hands tightly in herlapI think no matter what it is thatvou had better tell me she said Ishall try to bear itHendricks drew up a chair and satdown He glanced towards the doctoras if for help but evidently gave up anyidea of relief from that dignified quarterMatters have reached a very gravestage he said mopping his perspiringbrow Perhaps 1 ought to begin bysaying that Mr Gielow is innocent ofeven the slightest participation in themurder for that must be a comfortingthoughtMiss Huntington leaned towards himlike some si iff inanimate objectHe he is dead she said under herbreathXo not quite so bad as that Hendricks raised his hand as if his gesturewould correct her surmise But I havereasons for believing that he is in avery very critical position The factis that he succeeded in getting a written message to the police to the effectthat he is confined in some place unknown to himself by Count Bantinniand that he is starving to death It isclear to me now that Bantinni is themurderer that through hypnoticpower he has made Mr Gielow confessto the murder both to Henri in personand in letters to the police and yourselfFor a moment the heiress staredspeechlessIt is indeed serious went on thedetective turning his uncomfortablegaze on the doctor Bantinni is undoubtedly the guilty party and Gielow is the only witness against him Inorder to carry his point of making itappear that Gielow was guilty and ofhis own accord a fugitive he wouldnot hesitate toOh my God ed Miss Huntington covering her faceIs there no course open askedLampkin wrought to a painful heightof sympathy by Miss Huntingtons emotionIt all depends on our capturing Bantinni and forcing him to reveal Gieiowsplace of imprisonment replied the de-tective but that is more easily arVedabout than accomplished Already Ihave turned every stone to trace himbut without a particle of success He isthe deepest villain on earth If hisown flight were questioned he wouldclaim that he disappeared to keep frombearing testimony against his friendGielowJust then Henri passed through theroom the advertisement in his handHendricks nodded after him as he disappearedI have sent him with a Personal forthe

ever saw After about teidays we had to pull the building downto get the sheep out and the two imdelayers had eat all the woo off each other Yet the critters seemed to haveuot along all right during that timeand I noticed that when they lay downat night they would all lie down together and all rise in the morning to theiifeet This puzzled the horses on topwhen the mass would rise and loweifive or six feet at which time the horsewould gallop around almost frightenedto deathWell we got the sheep mi and kepitunneling along until we got along bold BatcheIors where the snow wasnso deep and they made cuts instead oftunnelsWe struck a splendid cut in the hardsnow It was ix feet deep and justwide enough for a pack mule1iiey told us it was made by a manwho had a pack mule route over themountains to Virginia City and that ilwe met him hed make us turn back 1laughed at the idea U r v were allwell heeded and no man could turn usunless he was a quicker shotWell we piled our sheep and horsesinto this cut and tilings glided alongall right until the second day whenthe line came to a haltBy dove wed met the pack muleman I climbed out on the hard mowand got round to the head of t he columnwith a big Winchester rifle and foundhim sitting on a pack mule as serene amsmiling as anything All he had in hishand was a small cane and he lookerlike he owned the earth Behind binwas a string of pack mules as far as 1could seeWe passed the time er day and thenhe began to talk about theand the competitive points intravel had never heard of ththings before and wasnt disposed tplace much stock in em when he balanced the cane on the finger and thumbof his left hand and began to play hisright along over the knots and talk Ilaid down my rifl and began to listenHis language was convincin 1 tell yeHe showed how that I was only just inthe trail and could turn back with agreat deal less expense and inience and that as he was carrying theUnited States mail obstructing it mightresult in my beingfaken into court forit and perhaps landed in the Sacramento jail for lifeWhen he got through I said Id turnback and so I told my men They werehot and went to the front vowing tokill himThey rushed up and in a few minutes came back as meek as Iambs saying he had explained the whole matterto their entire satisfactionWell to make a long story shortlluacnt was so narrow that the animalscouldnt turn so we had to lean overthe cut and reach down and lift em onetit a time and twist em round towardsthe westIt took us all day and when we gotthrough we dropped down in the roomand fell asleep while the pack muleman went along through the cut driving all our truck out before himIn the morning we found the cutempty and our sheep driven out at theend of the cut rounded up and waitingfor us It just occurred to me that 1ought to have asked the man his namewhen one of my men said he guessedthe party had left his card Sureenough he had tied leven sheep in arow and with a pot and marking brushhe had painted his name in black painton the sides of the sheep one letter oneach sheep I could read it easilyenoughI The last fourheep were a little distance from therestCome to find out we had got 12 milesinto the

Wonderful Work of Naturehag on Between Americaand AsiaThere will be a bridge connectingthis country with Asia at no very disant day said Trof J W McGee thegovernment scientistIf you will look at any map of theworld you will find the bridge I speakof indicated by the line of the Aleutianchain which extends from Southwestera Alaska westward in a curve bearing somewhat toward the south Thiachain supplemented by certain Russian islands which physiographicallyspeaking form part of the same system is the southern boundary of Behring sea The line of islands extendsclear across from Alaska to the Asiaticide with many gaps between whichas I have stated remain yet to be filledin before the bridge is finishedBut how do you know they will befilled inThe best possible reasons exist forknowing that they must be filled inand that the land between our own territory and Asia will be made completeIt is certainly entirely beyond disputethat the islands of the Aleutian chainare steadily rising In fact a gradualfoiding up of that part of the earthscrust is taking place and the line of thefold is represented by the Aleutian islands and the Russian islands whichcontinue the system across the Kamchatka

Duringone unusually severe winter most ofthe fruit and seeds which the parrotshad been accustomed to eat were destroyed and the birds were driven toseek other means of sustenance Thenthey would attack

the weaver birds to colonizo andbuild one big flat topped platform twoor three yards across which is so admirably put together as to shed therain as well as any roof could do Under this roof they make individualpocket shaped nests bringing up under this unique structure a large andinterest ine family of little weaversThere is another bird called the tailor which instead of weaving itsnest incloses
