TOTOBACCO FRIENDSOURiA few days ago THE NEWS', inthe regular course of business received through the , mail, an advertisement, seut in by a "Huntington,WestVa., tobacco warehouse, arranging for display space in oneissue of THE NEWS. The advertisement appeared in Tuesdays' issue,just as any other legitimate form ofadvertising has its course.In the rush of business incidentalto getting copy ready for the iaperthe subject matter of this particular advertisement was not " readthoroughly, and we did not know1 ofits nature at the time, nor did 'weknow anything at all of the differences between the Huntington people and the Burley Tobacco Pool. Theadvertisement was -printed as a legitimate business matter,, we not being supposed to censor our advertiser's copy. We have since heardthat the advertisement is currentlyreported as being part of an allegedpropaganda said to have been instigated by opponents of the 6o-opejr ative Tobacco Marketing" Association.THE NEWS has been 'a consistentSupporter of the marketing plan, andits columns have ever been open foradvocacy of the Association's plans.Personally we have done somethingin our humble way for the advancement of the tobacco interests of thecounty, and we feel that we havedone our duty toward the Association. We have helped in the drivesand campaigns that have been sosuccessfully put over in Bourboncounty, and we Have ever felt it aprivilege and an honor, to be associated in a business way with thesuccess of the movement. It wouldbe as far from our business policyto publish Anything knowingly opposed to the Marketing Association'splan as it would be for us to libel ordefame anyone, and we have no intetion of doing so at any time. THENEWS is now and always 'has been,heartily a supporter and goodfriend of the Co-operative TobaccoMarketing Association, and we regret very much that this advertising antagonistic as it may be deemedto the Association's plan, shouldhave been the .cause of anxiety toanyone. We are entirely innocentin the matter, and offer this explanation as a matter of business principle, in the assurance that it willbe so taken.F0$ THE BLACK CAKEFresh ingredients for that blackcake: Citron, seeded and seedlessraisins, dates, shelled nuts, orangeand lemon peel, spices, etc.(, C. p: COOK & CCL.I-?y?THE&iCOMMERCIAL CLUBADOPTS SLOGAN"Try Paris Before You Buy ParisPrices Are The lowest," , k;;The Slogan 4WINDOW DISPLAY PLANNEDBanners will soon be displayed.prominently in Paris store windowsand elsewhere, urging with renewedemphasis that Paris and Bourboncounty people be loyal to their hometown in the matter of trading.

A splendidspirit of co-operation was manifested at the meeting and is an excefelent indication that the presentmovement will be successful In increasing the confidence of the public in the local business houses andthereby keep thousands of dollars inParis that go to other cities everyweek. 0-The merchants favored the holding of another window display contest this year.

Cave will be taken, overby the Federal Government and bemaintained as a National Park, provided a deed to the property is givento the government. It does not matter to the government whether thedeed is given by Kentucky or by persons who might 4be interested in thisproject. This assurance has beengiven Dr. W. R. Jillson, of Frankfort, State geologist, who had a conference last week with Albert Fall,Secretary of the Interior.Being a native Kentuckian, Secretary Fall assured Dr. Jillson that "hewould like very much to do something for Kentucky, and he .believedthat he could get the government totake over the cave and the groundssurrounding it if the property couldbe deeded to the government. Thereason for this, Secretary Fall explained, is that the governmentwants absolute control, so that itcan build its own roads, its ownhotels, anjl bring the Mammoth Caveup to the standard maintained by thegovernment in other parks. If thisproposition is taken up by the Legislature, and the property deeded tothe government, it will mean the expenditure of a very large sum ofmoney annually in that section ofthe country.UNCLE SAM'S CHECKS GO FAR-AND-AWAYB0UEB0N EAEM CONDITIONSThe sun never sefts on UncleSam's checks to former service men,according to a statement issued recently by the veteran bureau whichshowed a monthly total of nearly$600,000 sent to eighty-six differentforeign countries.

Previous rains have put the tobacco inexcellent condition for stripping, andthe work has progressed steadily.It is expected that hog killing willbe the main work this week, as afavorable season has come with theadvent of cold weather.Some farmers killed their hogsduring the past week, and almostwithout exception their- entire lots ofmeat have spoiled. The presentcold snap is expected to last for, afew days at least, and, as tobaccostripping can safely be postponed fora time, those who have porkers willput them up while the opportunitylasts. Pastures are in good condition, and many farmers are buyingcattle at the prevailing low prices,and feeding them on cheap corn, expecting a raise in cattle in the nearfuture. Winter crops of wheat, ryeand barley are reported to be making satisfactory progress. Manyfarmers have been disappointed attheir Inability to do any fall plowing jm account of the continuedrains. Eggs are scarce and rangearound sixty cents practically everywhere. Butter is reported moreplentiful, and in large demand.W0EHS THEEATEN BOOKS VALUED AT $50,000Last week a mother in Tacoma,Wash., gave birth to her sixteenthchild. Her husband works in a shipyard. She said that having sixteenchildren carried no consequences tobe feared: The older children helped with the younger ones.Children, in other words, if youhave enough of them, get so numerous "that they take care of themselves. This is Emerson's philosophy applied to the home. For eVery action,Emerson said, there is a corresponding reaction. Life mover in circles.In the case of Mrsr Schaeffer, ofTacoma, the compensating thingabout a large number of children isthat they could be used.This modern instance of the largevfamily explains, of course, why ourgrandmothers could bear seven andour greatgrandmothers fourteenchildren. The thing takes care ofItself and isn't such a stunt, afterall.Still, those who hasten to emulateMrs. Schaeffer will probably be fewin number. There may be compensations in making a small village ofone's family, but most modern women will prefer two or three children to sixteen, even with compensations.

Christmas has a meaning possessed by no other holidaythroughout the world. America has its national andspecial days, other countries have theirs; Christmas isthe only one alike in spirit and celebrated in all Christian lands. So pure is its principle that it commandsrespect and admiration among people who worshiptheir Creator in different ways from oiirs.Christmas typifies all that is best in mankind. It is theculmination of the human mind throughout the agesdwelling upon the wonders and mysteriesof existence,turning to. a reverence for God and His representative on earth. It expresses the ascendency of spirit,the realization of men of their interdependence andtheir duty to one another; and so it is marked bv thebestowal of giftsand other sentiments of benevolenceand well wishing.The makers of newspapers, concerned as they arewith the doings, manifestations and thoughts of theirrespective communities and the' world at large, andrecording them in their more important aspects forthe information, mayhap the education of readers, arebrought into an intimate sense of the -spirit and mean-,ing or Christmas. Would that we could express to youall the good that we see in the hearts of men and theincreased brilliancy behind a few shadows of the lightwhich has upheld the world for so many centuries.' In the happy auguries we see for the future, there isevery reason to be merry.Our Yuletide thoughts go out to the people of this community and our thanks are due the patrons and kindfriends who have given us practical support or extendedencouragement during the year. May this be the bestChristmas you have ever spent, is our wish to all.The PublishersCntf.I92tQx&,i'KJSJ.-KS1-o(k. - --.1mo?.OAOOq0 V0$ OOdm--H522fcN'05sag6KaKaf-.--H- "ofcr - 1 -j. -?0er- . ;G.BAsm.

By MARY GRAHAM BONNER 0.Jt -ih -IN LIMELIGHTlormer Paris Girl and DaughterwV Have Varied Experiences- - In Their LivesJeatubed IN NEWSPAPERSThe varying social and financialfortunes and statue of a formerParis girl, who in Paris was prettyBirdie Pollock, and is now Mrs.sprilliam Miller Qraham, of California, have formed the theme for endless newspaper stories, all more orlees elaborate, but all telling of theParis girl's rise in the world fromcomparative obscurity. In a recent-issue of the Minneapolis, Minn.,Daily Journal, a feature writer pensthe -following:"There comes the picture of a little town in Kentucky Paris byname. Its population is small. Thechief energies of the charming littletown find their ultimate way to theregulation 'Main' street. A deft little woman sits at a table fashioninga hat for some rural belle. It is thetypical place of the small town milliner. And over in a neighboringyard, a man merrily swings a hammer, trying to lead an errant barndoor, which has protested its hinges,back into the straight and narrowjiath whistling as the hammerfalls."The woman making the hat isthe mother of Mrs. "William MillerGraham, a milliner; the man Is herfather, the town carpenter: Bothgood folk and respected, but littledreaming that one day their childwould charm and command royalty."As one keeps this picture' inmind, the unfolding of the remarkable story of the Grahams takes anadded flavor. It emphasizes the power of beauty and of charm, the absolute capitulation of high birth,blood, money and title to the forceof a woman's attractions the artillery of her eye. John the Baptistwas neither the first, nor the last,man to lose his head because of awoman's smile."There came in time to the household of the carpenter and the milliner of Paris a liftle girl. -ThomasPollock, the father, and the littlemother of the monnets decided thatshe should be called 'Birdie.' AndBirdie Pollock grew to the mostbeautiful girl in all thetown. Inthat old-fashioned place beauty anda- good family name were just asgood as a Bradstreet reference. Nobody elbowed Birdie Pollock fromlocal" society because of her humbleorigin. She was beautiful; she waswelcome. They threw open the doorsto her as one thrpws open a windowto admit the first jray of sunshine after a depressing '.rain."The townfolk .were sorry whenPollock went to Philadelphia, taking Birdie, then 17, along with thefamily. It was in the Quaker Citythat she met William Miller Graham. Graham was not wealthy. Hewas as yet the fairy prince in disguise, and all the world knows thatpoverty can disguise any sort of aprince so thoroughly that society, atleast, won't know him."They married. And then, alongin 1899, the California propertiesthat GrahamJiad developed began tosend out an oily fortune. There wasonce a decline in' the family fortunes.Then the next queer trait of heritage developed, for it appeared -thatMrs. Graham was a dramatist, whomight, on a plnjh, write a play, andhe went to David Belasco' with aview of having the Old Master coachher for the stage that she might aidin recouping the temporarily haltedfortunes of the .Tiousehold."'Whirr!' went the whirligig offate,"The oil wells behaved well again.Soon the Graham fortune was estimated at $60,000,000 and the peoplein high places on both sides of theAtlantic knew that a new and striking figure had come among them inthe person of the wonderful womanwho was once: the village belle inParis, Kentucky. Paris, France,came also to show that names of cities", as well as tastes in beauty, maybe the same on both sides of theocean."It wasEdward VII, King of England, and world-famous as a connoisseur of the fair, who pickedMM. Graham as a worthy type toadorn his already illustrious .gallery;and his grandson, the present Princeof Wales, 'who nver heard f hisgrandfather's comment on the motherrand traveling around the world,far, from his home, drawn by someirresistible force; to the side of Geraldine Graham, whispered as they finished a dance: 'C" 'You are the most beautiful woman in all America"Mother and daughter, each, in 'hergeneration crowded Queenof Beautyby British royalty, uaw'the collapseof their romances within- the comP of a single moon. - To-day, In?,e 2f 3he moait beautiful homes inall of the United States, surrounded2L55uJenc? afld luxury. they aremiadful only of the fact that theyare two women with two heartswring.

Nearlyevery day news comes of new Stinness venture, thrilling Wall street.Bankers are wondering, who IsStinness? The real mystery is, whois back of Stinness? Some one, youcan gamble on that. Is it the formerKaiser and his friends, the militaryparty?Stinness is rated as a billionaire.Even Rockefeller couldn't do that inhalf a decade.SHORT-SIGHTED POLICYA- newspaper jaragrapher delivered Himself of this remark the otherday: "A man is making real progress toward better things when helearns that selfishness is not sensible." This Is a vital truth summed up ina short sentence. Selfishness is thempst sTiort-sighted policy in theworld. It doesn't pay, and thereforeit is not sensible.People soon find out a selfish manand they let him alone. They doaiotgo out of their way to do him favors,for he does not do favors for others.Thinking of himself alone, he soonfinds that others take no thought ofhim.A selfish man misses most of thebest "there is in life.Selfishness is not sensible.oNO WAR WITH JAPANJapan's freign trade continues tofall off.

Outlines of the planand requests for co-operation in theformation of the league has beensent to base ball men in Winchester,Frankfort, Cynthiana, Paris, Richmond, Shelbyville and Georgetown.Charles Ellis and Frank Ramsey,managers and" owners of the Winchester Hustlers, have declaredthemselves-In favor of the league.B.

"Dr. "Allen Moore,for 17 years a resident-of Palestine,ells the curious- tale.For many many years, says DoctorMoore, travelers and archeologistswere puzzled to know where the enormous blocks of stone still standing inthe ruins of Solomon's' temple at Jerusalem were quarried. One day a little dog chased 'a lizard down a holeamong the debris. The next' instantthe dog also disappeared.His master, coming to the opening,peered down in vain. He called, andto his amazement his voice came backas from great dep,hs. -He summonedassistance, and a passage was openedInto immense subterranean quarries.There were found huge masses ofstone almost ready to be hoisted ,above ground."And don't you remember," asksDoctor Moore, "that we are told in"our Bibles that the temple was builtwithout sound of saw or of hammer?The fact that the quarryman workedunderground partly explains that."Upon some of the stones were foundinscriptions that perplexed the explorers until one scholar pronounced themPhoenician. The stones were wroughtby some of that army of workmen sentby King Hiram of Tyre to aid KingSolomon In his task.
