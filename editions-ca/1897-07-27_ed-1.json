WHEEL NOTES
tines About Devotees Of The Wheel At
Home And Elsewhere v
Nineteen Maj s 113 cyclers who
wheeled up to Augusta last week rode
wheels valued at 1625
The Twenty fifth United States Infan
try Bicycle Corps has completed its ride
of 1900 miles from Fort Missoula Mon

TIRES THAT LEAK
The Morgan Wright single tube
quick repair tire must be regarded as
a distinct improvement in bicycle tire
construction It has the following- ad
vantages
While punctures in it can be re
paired with plugs or semi liquid in
jections as well as in any other
single tube tire it can be permanently
repaired by using- the quick repair
strip inside the tire See cut No 1
No 1
By injecting- M W quick repair
cement through the puncture and
then pressing- down on the tire with
me uiuiuu 3jj iio uui xhv Aj me repair
No 2
strip inside is picked up by the cement
No 3
thus closing the puncture as in cut
No 3
The Morgan Wright single tube
quick repair tire is guaranteed not
porous This is on account of the way
in which it is made Nearly every
rider has heard of tires that leak
like a sieve
Many tires rot because water gets
into the fabric between the two layers
of rubber The Morgan Wright
fabric is proof against moisture
Everybody knows how comfortable
Morgan Wright tires are and yet
how seldom they puncture This is
due to the fabric
Ask any bicycle dealer whether
other tires last as long as Morgan i
Wright tires Ask also what the
Morgan Wright g uarantee means

Stop where you are John said
Mulligan One step nearer and Ill kill
you
4 Coleman made another step forward
and Mulligan shot him through the
heart He permitted the others to take
the body away keeping them covered
with his pistols all the time A crowd
gathered in the hotel and the public
square which it faced and plans were
discussed for capturing Mulligan but
his character for deadly desperation
was such that volunteers were scarce
At last it was decided to call out the
militia company and take the desperado
in his stronghold by regular assault
The troops were mustered in double
line in the public square facing the ho
tel and waiting the order to advance
Through the window of his room in the
third story Mulligan could be seen now
and then as he walked to and fro be
tween the stairway and the window
keeping watch against a surprise in
either direction Then as the face of
the desperado appeared once more at the
window one of the soldiers fired with
his rifle killing him instantly It was
an unexpected shot which undoubtedly
saved several lives that would almost
certainly have been sacrificed in carry
ing the room by storm
Billy Mulligan was a New Yorker
by birth and was a typical representa
tive of the old time California tough
gambler a class which got its tone and
manners from the New York of the vol
unteer firemen and Dead Rabbit days
Quick of motion some of them could
pick a fly from the wall with the thumb
and finger four times out of five stem
and short spoken except where it was
part of their game to be suave rough
and tumble fighters fashionably
dressed with more of ornaments than
southern gamblers often wear and dis
tinguished by heavy black mustaches
they ran their course in San Francisco
which was headquarters from which
they went to the new mining communi
ties to stay while these flourished or
until they were driven out They had
their day most of them were shot or
hanged or they died in want Here
and there stranded in some out of the
way western community some decrepit
suiftivor is fomid of the old gambler
