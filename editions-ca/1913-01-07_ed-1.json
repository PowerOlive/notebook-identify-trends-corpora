Cold Wave Today.
The eastward advance of the firs
cold weather of the winter coming
down from Alaska and the Canadian
Northwest, has been effectually re
tarded by an area of high pressure
developed over the western Atlantic
Ocean and Coast StateB, the Weather
Bureau at Lexington announced yester
day mornmer. Very low temperatures
Drevail throughout the west, the line
of zero temperature extending into
the Texas panhandle.
Abnormally high temperatures for
this season of the year prevail east of
the Mississippi River except in the ex
treme Northeast, but the cold wave
will reach the East Gulf States, the
Ohio Valley, the upper lake and west
lower lake regions by Tuesday. It
will be accompanied by snow over the
north and central districts and by
rains over the southern districts.
Rain or snow will result in the Atlant
ic States Tuesday night, and will be
accompanied by a fall in temperatures.
Laugh and Grow Fat.
Democritus, vho was always laugh
ing, lived one hundred and nine
years; Heraclitus, who never ceased
crying, only sixty. Laughing, then, is
best, and to laugh at another is per
fectly justifiable, since we are told
that the gods themselves, though they
made us as they pleased, cannot help
laughing at us.
