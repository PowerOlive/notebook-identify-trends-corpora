LAST MAN ON EARTH
VyHAT IS THE DREAD FATE THAT
AWAITS THIS MORTAL
Many Theories as to the Manner of
Life and Death That Will Be the
Portion of the Luitt Relic of Hu
manity as It Now Exist
Astronomers tell us that the day
must come when the earth will like
the moon wheel through the heavens
a dead and barren ball of matter air
less waterless Lifeless But long long
before that time man will be extinct
will have disappeared so utterly that
doctors did me nogoodT though I took not so much as the bleached skeleton
fl
IScwi
of a human being will be visible on all
the millions of square miles of the
surface of this planet
Unless by some huge and universal
cataclysm the whole race is swept at
once into eternity it is but reasonable
to suppose that man like any other
race of animals will disappear slowly
and that eventually there will be but
a single human being left some old
old man gray headed and bearded and
left to wander alone In a solitude that
may be imagined but not described
How will he die this last relic of
the teeming millions that once trans
formed the face of the globe and ruled
undisputed masters of every other liv
ing thing There are many fates that
may befall him He may go mad with
the horror of loneliness and himself
end his own miserable existence He
may be eaten by the vast reptiles or
giant insects which will then probably
infest the solitudes
But his fate may be far weirder and
more dreadful Scientists say that as
we burn the coal and timber we are
I still so richly supplied with we let
loose into the atmosphere an ever in
creasing volume or caroonic aciu gas
Much of this is taken up by plants
but not all It must increase and
eventually poison the breathable air
filling the valleys and mounting slowly
to the hill tops where the last remains
of animal life are striving for exist
ence The last man will climb higher
and higher but eventually the suffocat
ing invisible flood win reach and
drown him
Again it is said that the earth as It
gets older is cracking like dry mud
These craqks will increase until at last
they will let the waters of the oceans
and rivers sink into the fiery center of
the globe Then will occur an explo
sion so terrible as may startle the in
habitants of neighboring worlds The
last man in this case will probably be
some arctic explorer or Eskimo whom
the vast plains of ice around will save
from instant death and leave to grill a
few moments till the ice continents are
swallowed by redhot gases and steam
Suppose these earth cracks develop
more slowly they may suck away the
water without devastating explosions
Then the last mans fate will be the
worst describable He will die of
thirst The scene of his death will
probably be the great valley in the bed
of the Atlantic ocean off the Brazilian
coast half way between Rio Janeiro
and the cape where now six miles of
green water lie between the steamers
keel and the abysmal slime beneath
There hopelessly digging in the ever
drying mud he must perish and leave
his bones to parch on a waterless
planet
The antarctic polar ice cap has been
SrowinS thicker and heavier for un
flV UTAVtf lift Til OTA1V
filJlSMlMCiAill IU MlHlb i counted ages The distance from the
south pole to the edge of this ice cap is
1400 miles The ice rises steadily from
the edge to the center At that center
it cannot be less than 12 miles In thick
nesstwice as thick as Mount Everest
Is high
Suppose it splits Imagine the gi
gantic mass of water and ice that will
come sweeping up north overthe oceans
ami continents of the earth Where
then will the last man breathe his
final gasp High up in the snows ef
some great range he will perish miser
ably of cold and starvation looking
down on a huge shallow sea beneath
whose tossing waters will lie the whole
of the races of the world
Or last and perhaps dreariest fate of
all the human race may outlive other
mammals and last until the sun as
some day it must grows dull and cold
and vegetation dies from the chilled
earth The miserable remnant of
earths people must then slowly die out
after ages of an existence to which
that of the Eskimo of today is a para
dise
Doing Without the Dot
The small letter i was formerly
written without the dot The dot was
introduced In the fourteenth century
to distinguish i from e in hasty
and indistinct writing The letter i
was originally used where the letter
j is now employed The distinction
between 4i and j was introduced
by tbe Dutck printers at a compara
dy recent date and the J was dot
ted because th M from which it was
derived was written with a dot
Hint For Writer
Dont moisten your uew pen between
your lips before you begin to write
Take your cheap steal pen dip it in the
ink then hold it in the tlame of a
match for a few seconds wipe it care
fully dip it into the ink again and
you have a pen that will make glad
the heart within you Try it once
