BIBLE CLASS UNDER PROF-
HENDRICKS HAS GOOD START
The Men's Bible Class of the
Christian church had a splendid be
ginning last Sunday under the instruc
tion of "Prof. T. A. Hendricks. The
class is exceedingly fortunate in se
curing the services of such an able
and practical teacher for an instruct
or. Those who failed to take advant
age of the opportunity to get a prac
tical lesson from the study of Moses
and Aaron as leaders of the people
were the losers by so doing.
One of the strong points brought
out in the study of the lesson was the
difference between "A leader who
really leads the people" and "A leader
who waits to see which way the peo
ple are going and then jumps in the
front ranks."
It is hoped that many more of the
men of the community will give en
couragement to the work by coming
out Sunday morning at 9:30 and en
listing in the cause.
A special appeal is made to the offi
cers of the church to lend the influ
ence of their presence.

"ROMANCE OF BILLY GOAT HILL"
Mrs. Alice Hagen Rice has won an
other triumph in the unqualified ap
proval on the dramatized version of
her latest novel. "Romance of
Billy Goat Hill." Its first perform
ance in Lexington was at the new
Ben Ali Theatre last night.
The plot, as in "Mrs. Wiggs," is
laid in Louisville, although the sec
tions of Louisville, in which these
scenes are laid chance to be on the
other eide of town. The play contin
ues in its high level "the humor that
made "Mrs. Wiggs" so delightful to
read.
At its opening performance in Lou
isville Monday night Mrs. Rice had
to bow her acknowledgment to the
cheering assembly and later Miss May
Buckley, the gifted little actress, who
plays the leading role, was compelled
by the insistent applause to give vo
cal expression to the satisfaction of
both author and company.
The scenic presentation is most
pleasing. The ouening act discloses
a squalid version of the famous Hill
mow traversed b the East Walnut
car line, with the tumbled down
shacks, a saloon, and a saloon keep
er's house. Posters on the fence an
nounce , the Kentucky Derby at the
Churchill Downs, and a sign board
points the way to Louisville, for the
story is related of a time when the
city had not crept eastward over the
botom and up the slope. In the dis
tance can be seen the heights along
the river and Thornwood, the colonial
home of Col. Bob Carsey and his
charming little dauynter, Miss Lady,
which is so admirably taken by Miss
May Buckley.
The char,m of her work was unfail
ing in its portrayal of the character,
l natural, delicate ant appealing, with
grace and beauty she moved sweetly
through the play, winning the hearts
of all.
"A Romance of Billy Goat Hill" has
been dramatized by George E. Par
ker, and it scored an immediate suc
cess in its stage form. It will be the
offering at the new Ben Ali Theatre
today and tomorrow with a mafinee
tomorrow, featuring Miss Mae Buck
ley in the leading role, together with
a company of well balanced talent
with which no flaws can be found in
their presentation of the delightful
and absorbing story.
