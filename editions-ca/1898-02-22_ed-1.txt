well known clubman as he seatedhimself in a chair in front of the fire inhis apartments and they did not manyand live happily ever afterwards aslovers do in all well constructed romancesWilson said he to his valet bringme some wine- -and if anyone calls tsee me tell them that I have gone out cftownThe vine was placed before him andthrice in the space of a few minutes didJack Madison fill and drain his glassYes he continued talking to himself as the valet left the room the diehas been cast and to morrow I shallhave to stand the jests of the boys atthe club And Carmena the beautifulSpanish danseuse will she care Whatshall I say to the boys I shall tellthem to go to the devilYes I might have been too hastyBut mine own eyes saw them standingthere half concealed by the portiereBoth of his arms were tenderly twim dabout her slender waist and her sinuoisarms encircled his neck as she stood ontip toe laying her cheek against h sbearded face Then their lips met inone long rapturous kiss and in amoment he was gone I should havekilled him as they stood in the doorwaybut my heart stopped and my bandresting on the dagger she gave meseemed to be stayed by an uuseen powerWhen she saw me her cheeks flushedcrimson and she started to speak but Iwould not hear her Instead I reproached her in bitter terms for herfaithlessness As I poured torth thetorrent of wrath she sank into a chairand buried her face in her hands andas I finished her form shook with emotion Thus I left herHow beautiful she was A truedaughter of Spain her form was litheand she was as gracef nl as a fairyHer laugh was a marry song and herdance was a terpsichorean symphonywhich nightly won applause at thetheatre Her hair was like unto aravenswing andjierjdark eyesjbeamedmischieviously from a face as fair

theCriticisms Tending to Offend theChief of a Friendly NationWashington Feb 18 The state department Thursday announced thatthe De Lome letter incident is closedSpain has disclaimed the reflectionscontained in the De Lome letterThe statement given out is as follows The following is an abstract oia note sent Wednesday evening by theSpanish government to Minister Woodford at MadridThe Spanish goveamrient on learning of theincident in -which Minister Dupuy De Lomewas concerned and being advised of his objectionable communication with entire sincerity laments the incident which was the causeof the interview with the minister states thatMinister De Lome had presented his resignation and it had been accepted before thepresentation of the matter by MinisterWoodford That the Spanish ministry Jn accepting the resignation of a functionary whoseservices they have been utilizing and valuingup to that time leaves it perfectly well established that they do not share and rather onthe contrary disauthorize the criticismstending to offend or censure the chiefof a friendly state although such criticismshad been written within the field oifriendship and had reached publicity by artfuland criminal means That this meaning hadtaken shape in a resolution by the council ofministers before Gen Woodford presented thematter and at a time when the Spanish government had only vague telegraphic reportsconcerning the sentiments alluded to Thatthe Spanish nation with equal and greateireason affirms its view and decision afterreading the words contained in the letter reflecting upon the president of the UnitedStatesAs to the paragraph concerning the desirability of negotiations of commercial relationsif even for effect and importance of using arepresentative for the purpose stated in SenorDupuy De Lomes letter the government expresses concern that in the light of its conductlong after the writing of the letter and inview of the unanswerable testimony of simultaneous and subsequent factsany doubt shouldexist that the Spanish government has giverproof of its real desire and of its innermostconvictions with respect to the new commercial system and the projected treaty of commerceThat the Spanish government does not nowconsider it necessary to lay stress upen or todemonstrate anew the truth and sincerity ofits purpose and the unstained good faith of itsintentionsThat publicly and solemnly the governmentof Spain contracted before the mother countryand its colonies a responsibility for the political and tariff changes which it has inauguratedin

Be Reported Cuba and MaineDisaster 3Iay Receive AttentionWashington Feb 21 The diplomatic and consular and the militaryacademy appropriation bills will beconsidered and passed by the senateduring- the week There will be moreor less debate in executive session ofthe Hawaiian annexation treaty andspeeches will be made on the claim ofMr Corbett to a seat in the senate onthe appointment of the governor oiOregon The Corbett matter will notbe pressed except to the end of havingthe speeches so far disposed of as tomake sure of getting a vote at the timefixed a week from MondayThe expectation is that the bill making appropriation for the consular anddiplomatic service will be made thebasis for considerable debate It isunderstood to by Senator Allens intention to make an effort to secure the incorporation in the bill as an amendment of his provision for the recognition of Cuban belligerency and if heshould make this effort the result mightbe a general discussion of the Cubanquestion While however this isamong the possibilities it does not atthis time appear probable for the senate is now in a mood for the openingof this question pending the Maine investigation so that if it should betaken up this week there would have tobe a radical change in sentiment Thereare some senators however who aredesirous of having the subject debated and they may force the issue AsMr Allens amendment was adverselyreported from the committe on foreignrelations Senator Hale will raise apoint of order against it This thevice president will sustain and MrAllen will of course appeal ThereWill be stubborn opposition to such anamendment if offered and the contest may be an animated one ifMr Allen persists in his purpose Independently of the Cubanamendment the diplomatic bill is likely to cause debate on other questionsIt seldom gets through the senatewithout being- made the basis of moreor less general discussion of the countrys foreign policyUnless the Cuban question or somephase of the Maine disaster shouldcome before the house this week thotime with the exception of Mondaywhich under an arrangement madelast week will be given up to the consideration of private bills will be devoted nominally at least to the sundry civil appropriation bill This billwill be reported to the house MondayIt is a very voluminous measure containing all the odds and ends of appropriations as its name indicatesand is usually productive ofmore protracted contests than any ofthe other appropriation bills It is understood that the information regarding the situation in Cuba asked for lastweek by the house has been preparedby the state department and is readyfor transmittal Some of the consular reports bearing- on the situation have been edited in someplaces but it is said that thesituation as presented probablywill call for some actioninformation goes to theand if thehouse thisweek an effort may be made to get itbefore the house in some manner Forthis reason and in view of the condition of public sentiment pending- theresult of the special investigation intothe cause of the disaster to the Maineit is considered probable that theanswer of the state department will bewithheld for several daysCRISIS COMINGThis Week Perhaps Says Ex-SuperintendentRobert PorterPhiladelphia Feb 21 The Inquirer will Monday print under Washington date a lengthy dispatch from Eobert P Porter ex superintendent ofcensus giving what he believes to be the policy of the administration regarding Cuba Mr Porter thinks that Spain shall be asked toallow the Cubans to purchase theirliberty by the issuance of Cuban

theaisles to listen The spectators in thegalleries leaned over with breathlessinterest as Secretary Longs letterwas -read It is unnecessary to saysaid Mr Boutelle at the conclusion ofthe reading of the letter from Secretary Long that the work of salvagebegin at once and that arrangementswith the wrecking companies whichhave necessary outfits should not bedelayed I deem it proper to call attention to the fact that Secretary Longrecognizing that congress was in session has come here for authority to dothis work instead of straining any authority he might possess independentlyMr Bailey called attention toAthefact that the resolution only spoke ofrecovering the bodies not of theirs oreturn this country but he addedVbhatthere need be no stickling on thispoint uMr Boutelle replied that

Citizenfrom Key West Fla saysSailors of the battleship Maine suffering from wounds in the Key Westhospital are smarting over the delayof the government in punishing whatthey term a Spanish outrageIn their minds there is no doubt asto the cause of the explosion and theyexplain the delay in taking summaryaction by saying that the president ismorally certain that there was no accident and wishing to deceive theSpaniards with a feeling of security is using the short time tomake the necessary preparations toenforce his ultimatum If no action istaken they say not a man amongthem will again pace the

days of advanced engineeringrailroads have sought and conqueredmany remarkable places Here in theUnited States we can ride up and downmountains just as if they were littlehills and hurry along the brink ofgorges that make us shiver when welook down From California howevercomes the strangest railroad story andpicture for a long time It tells of andshows a tradn that actually runs overtree topsWhat a singular sensation it mustbe to realize that one is following afuming spitting locomotive over thevery places where kind nature intendedbirds should nest and that delightfulquiet found among dense foliage reignssupreme This railroad down in Sonoma county Cal between the Clippermills and Stewart Point is not exactlya passenger line but it is a railroad inevery sense of the wordIt so happens that when the railroadcomes to a place about equi distant -fromthe two points mentioned a hugeravine is encountered the sides andbottom of which are heavily woodedtwo giant redwood monarchs of theforest towering far above the less pretentious growth and imparting an airof almost regal impressivenessNow it was very necessary that therailroad should cross this ravine Itwas also true that the- building of aregulation railroad bridge would hardly pay and this is where real geniuscame to the rescue If the reader couldstand either at the edge of this ravineor on one of its sloping sides he wouldsee that strangely enough the growthof the trees and their position is suchthat their tops can be cut off and an almost level surface of stumps be securedThis is what genius saw and hencethe railroad across the tree tops Inthe first place the big redwoods weresawed off 75 feet from the ground thiabeing the exact height from the bottom of the ravine to the level of thetops of the trees Next trees on eitherside were sawed off of sufficient lengthto render their tops in a direct linewith the tops of the redwoods as wellas of the edges of the banksIn this fashion was nature made toprovide the piers and superstructure ofthe desired bridge To the lumbermeneven the California veterans the projectseemed almost chimerical but thebuilders pushed ahead and presentlyone day with a snort of triumph a little logging engine pulled four fiat carsand a caboose over the tree topsNobody ever heard of such a thingbefore We have all been told of therope bridge have read of the great steelstructures that span several famouslivers and many of us have seen thesetriumphs of engineering genius butwho is there that ever heard anywhereelse of a railroad bridge over the topsof trees It

the beach he looked around andseeing all the other mules still beingcarried toward the steamer he wentinto the surf again and started in thedirection of the barge After he hadgone some distance a great wave came4along and turned him over When herighted himself he was absolutelywild and blindly headed out for midocean The men on the barge watchedhim for awhile and then the captainasked if it was proposed to let the animal drown Quick as a flash one of theKanakas sprang overboard swam ata tangent to intercept the mule andreaching the animal climbed upoevhisback and by clever tactics

partisansinterested solely in the honor and prosperity of our state we feel it our dutto say a few words about the ElectionBill now pending in the LegislatureWe hold that it is very undemocraticin prinsiple and calculated to destroythe freedom of our elections In realityit saps the very foundations of libertyand will render elections in thistate a farce That whenits despotic machinery as doubtless it finally will has fallen intopartisan and corrupt hands it fastensvenal clique rule upon the state indefinitely for it is easy for these commissioners to count out any reformLegislature elected to repeal it Abill more fraught with disaster anddegradation to the state of Kentuckyhas we believe never been offeredin the Kentucky LegislatureNotice that it entirely does away withhome rule and responsibility in regardt elections The State Commissionersa e elected by the Legislature all as amatter of course of the dominant partyThese Commissioners during recess ofthe Legislature and the Legislatureonly sits 60 days in two years fill vacancies in their own board They appoint all the Oountj Commissionersand can remoye them at any timeThese County Commissioners responsible only to this partisan State Boardappoint all the officers oE the electionsand at their will can remove them atany time The several boards count allreturns of elections declare results andissue certificates of election There isonly one reservation of power by theLegislature and that is to try a contested election for Governor orLieutenant GovernorA more ingenious scheme for givingthe state over to clique rule without regard to the wishes of the people wasneyer devised A more effective plan tocheat the people out of their right tochoose their rulers or change their policies as time may dictate the necessitywas never broached The friends ofthis bill as an excuse for it say the Republicans roll up to large majorities inthe Eleventh District Do not the Democrats do likewise in the First Thisplea is the plea of the wolf in JEsopwhen he wishes to devour the lambBut this matter should not be considered from a partisan standpoint eitherway but from the light of our libertiesand sound Democratic principlesWhen state after state is falling underthe dominion of boss rule let us takewarning at their example and protectour liberties while we can Rememberpatriotic men and true Democrats thatthis is a self perpetuating body thisState Election Commission that whenonce elected that even no Legislaturecan sit except such as they may selectthat they raised above the people andindependent of the people absolutelycontrol the whole machinery of yourelections llvit if any subordinateounty Board oppose their wishes thatthey can immediately remove them andthat any election officer can be removeda minute before the election commencesthat there is a complete subordinationof all appointees to the despotic controlof this State Board or a majority of itthat these boards give no bond and aresubject to no penalties and that if election returns are delayed by the machinery of which they have the control theycan declare results without the full re-turnsIf this is not despotism what is itIf this bill embodies the principles ofliberty then deliver us from such liberty Let all patriotic and conservativemen put their seal of condemnation upon this dangerous bill and let no member of the Legislature imagine that hecan shirk his duty and responsibility tohis people and his state by going into acaucus where the result is already predetermined in favor of this oligarchicaland tyrannical

remedy has been foundwhich in a number of instances atleast has proved successful I haveknown of a cure in the case of a charming little girl four years of age whowas addicted to this habit and uponwhom had been tried in vain all the devices usual in such cases The bitterremedies were of no avail red pepperwas equally futile while a good spanking produced repentant tears but noreformAt length the mother with an inspiration born of her despair adopted gentler tactics She first took the chubbyhands and kissed the dimples andshowed the child the ten tiny finger tiprof pink pearl She next called attenf tion to the ten little Vhite moons almost concealed at the base of the nailsThe next step was to give the child abit of white powder and a rag withpermission to rub it all over each littlepink pearl Then followed a gift of anail brush with the privilege of learning to brush and trim her own nailsNext came the chamois polisher andthe child was delighted by this time tosee the improvement in the appearanceof her hands A present now of a fewother of the most manicuring implements secured her awakenedinterest and it was not long before thehabit of disfiguring the nails was forgotten The whole secret lar in arousing in the child a roper respect forher own personal neatness togetherwith an ambition to succeed in whatshe had undertaken and a constantcare not to destroy

the president and the treasurercame bustling inWhats up Conway the presidentMr Perry asked Why man alivehow white you are he added lookingsearchingly at meOh sir what shall I do hardlyknowing in my consternation what Iwas saying Its gone all goneWhats all gone Your wits Areyou sick Mr Perry askedHere the treasurer uttered an exclamation and pointed toward the reserve vault Mr Perry craned his neckand danced inside Then he turnedquickly to me and his face was as whiteas his shirt bosomWhy God Almighty Conwaywheres all your currency he asked inhoarse tonesI dont know sir I left I beganbut the president cut me shortIs it that thats gone You meanstolen How could it be Who couldhave entered the vault You did notforget to lock up yesterday did youhe asked with terrible earnestnessNo indeed I answered Thevault was locked at usual I set thetimepiece for half past eight I expected to be on hand and get things inshape for the examining committeeAnd you have just discovered thelossYes sir I went out of town lastevening and returned but a few minutes agoSo then the lock was unprotected bythe timepiece a whole hour before thebookkeepers arrived Mr Perry saidwith a most piercing glance thrown atmeJackson promised me he would behere in my place I falteredJackson What has he to do withthe vault He doesnt know the combination does heNo sir It was only to have an employe in the room after the timepiecehad run down that I asked him to bepresentCall Jackson Mr Perry requestedof the treasurerWhile that gentleman was gone onhis errand Mr Perry and I made ahasty search through the other compartments We found some of them indisorder and judging from appearances many bonds missingThe president was completely overwhelmed by this new discovery Hestood gazing at me with a look of the1 greatest anguish on his white drawnfacej Oh Mr Perry I cried as God hearsI me I know nothing about this Oh believe me I am innocentj No one has accused you Conway sofar he replied seriously and withi nificanceYou cannot think I had anything todo with it I went on You know Ihave never betrayed any trust which Ihave held in this bankMy God I dont know what to thinkI cant think You never told

the receivingteller I repliedAnd they are away on their vacations are they notYes sir I faltered for I divined themeaning of his questionsHere the treasurer returned followedby Jackson Were you here this morning at the time you promised Mr Conway you would be the presidentasked JacksonJackson glanced around in surpriseat the group he saw inside the vaultIt was an impossibility for me to fulfill my promise he answered Anaunt of mine over in Camden who hasbeen ill for some time died last evening and as I am her sole relative andheir to what little she possessed I wascompelled to go over to Camden lastnight I expected to return in time tokeep my word with Mr -Conway ButI was unable to complete the arrangements for the funeral and some otherminor matters relating to the will untilthis morning and I had only just arrived at the bank when Mr Smithsonthe treasurer informed me youwished to see meThen he added in deep concern Isincerely hope the inability to keep mypromise has not been the cause of anytroubleWell whatever trouble there maybe the blame certainly cannot be attached to you Mr Jackson under thecircumstances jrou have mentionedYou may return to jour work Mr Perry said after a long pauseI intended to ask -leave of absencefor a few days Jackson began in ahesitating manner But if anythinghas happened which would preventyour granting itNo no nothing has happened whichwould keep you here Your request isgranted Every consideration mustgive way to death Mr Perry respondedJackson thanked the president in hisquiet and courteous way and left thevaultIt is past the time for beginningbusiness the treasurer suggestedThe remark aroused Mr Perry fromthe troubled and perplexed state theloss of the money had plunged himintoIs there any cash in the vault heaskedYes sir All the gold and silver andthe receipts of yesterday seem to behere I repliedWell get your money out to thewindows as quickly as you can Conway then come to my room Mr Smithson call the police and

his officeBefore the door leading out into thevestibule one of the special police ofthe bank was standingI smiled bitterly as I recognized thefact that steps had already been takento prevent my leaving the bankMr Perry was walking the floor hemotioned to me to be seated The trustees will wish to interview you heJisTHE BOUBON NEWS TUESDAY FEBRUARY 22 18981 ssaid significantlyWell let them Theyll get nothingout of me I replied1 doggedlyThe president paused in his walk andthrew a searching glance at me Iwould advise you not to incriminateyourself Conway before you are accused he said coldlyI started to my feet I mean justwhat I say Mr Perry I understandthe position I am in Why sir evenyou who have been my best friend Ican see even you whom I have nevergiven the least cause to doubt my honesty suspect meThere was such a look came into hisface such a sad look that it quite unmanned meNelson he began I dont wish todoubt you I have always consideredyou one of my safe men But do younot see my boy what is against youYou are the youngest man that has everheld such an important position as youhold in this bank There was considerable opposition to giving you the placeon account of your youth But I insistedon your advancement and pledged myofficial word that you would provefaithful to the trust I had such confidence in you that I did not even consider it necessary to put you on yourguard hy telling you this at the timeThere was no necessity sir to putme on my guard My duties would nothave been performed any better or morehonestly and faithfully had I knownthis I thank you for your kindnesshoweverStung by his implied doubt of meand knowing my absolute innocenceand how I had given my best effortsin the discharge of my duties I hadstraightened up proudlyMy grandfather before he died hadwritten on the fly leaf of a primer ofmine Be strong in adversity thatstamps the man I did not realize thefull meaning of the words then Butthey came to me now in full forceI am sorry I gave way so It wasa foolish fear I am innocent of anywrong and I am confident that my innocence will be proved some time Until it is I will try to bear the suspicionas patiently as possible I said calmlyHere some members of the examiningcommittee came hurriedly in What isthis I hear How did it happenWhom do you suspect These weresome of the exclamations that reachedmy ear as they crowded around thepresidentOne by one the trustees came in Oneof the last to arrive was Mr Morleybut he passed on to the committee roomwithout noticing meI thought of Florence and wonderedwhat she would think of it all Aftermy happiness of the evening before tobe crushed under such a blow of fafewas most cruel But I resolved not to becrushed There came to me a kind ofexhilaration of spirit in making thisresolve and when after awhile I wassummoned before the trustees it nervedme for the ordeal through which I Mknew I must passAfter telling all I knew which I didin as concise a manner as possible a jdeluge of questions was hurled at menearly every one of the 18 or 20 members of the board taking a hand in thecrossexaminationYou say you were out of town lastnight and did not return until a fewminutes before ten this morningasked one of the vice presidentsYes sir I answeredYou have not stated where youI were and how you spent the timethe man continued Perhaps the remaining trustees share with me a natural curiosity to know thisI hesitated in giving answer noticingwhich my questioner glanced aroundtriumphantly as though he had scoreda point against meYou do not answer he finally saidOf course you need not if your answerwill criminate yourselfIt is not the fear of criminating myself that causes me to hesitate in myanswer I replied casting afi appealingglance in the direction of Mr MorleyThat gentleman turned his eyes toward me and I thought there was rathera pleased expression about them Hesmiled gravely and bowed his headI spent the evening at Mr Morleysplace in Fairlawn I quietly said interpreting that gentlemans inclinationof his head as permission to tellMy answer created some surprise andall eyes were turned upon Mr MorleySuch were that gentlemans

he left my place I cannotsay But he was on the train thismorning as he said for I usually takethe same train in coming to town andI saw himMr Morley only stated the cold factbut nevertheless that he should speakat all in my defense seemed to me agood omenI was soon asked to retire As I wentout into the presidents room threeor four fellows went in I knew theywere detectivesThere is no need to tell of the examinations I was compelled to submit toby these same detectives and how theytried all their art wheedling threatening bullying to get me to confess toa crime I knew nothing of For alltheir trouTole they got nothing from mebut the truthWhen the trustees meeting broke upthe president came out to meNelson if you are guilty and wish toescape the consequences now is the timeto flee the country The trustees havedecided not to have you arrested justyet he said with a smileThey are very land sir But I wishto be arrested Nothing would pleaseme better than to stand trial I replieddefiantlyMr Morley came through the room asT spoke and at my loud tone he threwa glance at me Whether it indicateddisgust at what he might considerbravado or commendation at nry daring to take a firm stand on my innocence I could not sayYou may go home for the rest of theday Conway said the president without looking at me Come to my officein the morning Dont go into the bank-roomI went out

abstractedThe fact remained however that it wangoneOn mj way down to the bank the following morning I bought some newspapers and eagerly read all the accounts Every paper without actuallystating the facts in so many wordsgave out strong hints that I was somehow connected with the affair I no-ticed also that passers by lookedaround after me Many men with whomI had a bowing acquaintance turnedtheir heads and pretended not to seeme I realized in great bitterness ofspirit that I was already a marked mansuspected and therefore shunnedIt is a lamentable fact that often asuspicion of a man runs through thegeneral public without any just reasonThe current in such an event is overwhelming and it is useless to try tostem it as I soon realizedWhen I entered the lobby on my wayto Mr Perrys private office I was favored by having the curious glances ofmy former associates thrown at mebut only one of them extended to mea salutation That one was HoraceJackson and he smiled as he bowedTO BE

home and for nearly two months he and I took a close interest in each other he for the flies Iintroduced to him and I for the amusement he introduced to me I kept himin a milliners box letting him outwhen I visited him specially delighting myself and allowing him to dropfrom one hand by his fine spun threadand then either catching him in theother or gently compelling him to climbback again by apparently eating hisown ladderOne day I captured another spider ofthe same species I kept him for a fewdays in a separate box and then withthe kindly idea of companionship I introduced him to Tiger I

at least they once were womentill they became a confusion of bloodand hair and shredded garments butthe fullest sense I ever realized of madmurderous passion let ungovernablyloose centered in one destroying aimand summoning every physical energyto its devilish service I realized whenthose two spiders rushed to mortalcombat I stood in boyish terror attheir tangled legs dropped off torn bymutual rage and as with vicious dexterity they struck each other with theirpoisoned fangs using for their own destruction the weapons and applianceswith which nature has provided themfor the capture and slaughter of theirpre3r I visibly turned paleTiger was the victor but evenwhile with brutal wrath all mangledas he was he bit and spurned his deadand limbless foe he was seized withsymptoms I took to

EMERGENCIESFearless Courage o the Arctic Eplorer NansenWhen Fridtjof Nansen was a youngstudent he attended a ball and dancedwith many partners Returning longafter midnight through the streets tohis lodgings he heard loud outcriesfrom a woman who was strugglingwith two ruffians In another momentthe woman broke away from them andran toward the spot where Nansen waastanding The two men were close behind her in hot pursuitNansen was an athlete full of courage and vigor and put himself on guardas the men approached He allowed thewoman to pass but called upon the infuriated pursuers to halt standing directly in their way and hitting out firstat one and then at the other The ruffians angered by this unexpected attack turned resentfully upon the rescuer and would have overpowered himand possibly have murdered him if hehad not shown presence of mind Drawing himself up to his full height andthrowing back his coat collar so as toexpose the cotillion favors which hehad worn during the ball he sternlyasked them if they knew who he wasThe two assailants awed by his manner and supposing him to be a royal officer were at once cowed They apologized roughly for not recognizing himdropped

arecultivated Their beauty was recognized by our foremothers who calledthem painted ladies and indeed thedo have a very human appearance Thelate years have brought increasing- appreciation of these flowers and the oldpainted ladies have been broken intoinnumerable sorts covering almostevery shade from lemon yellow to a purple that is almost black They come inpure white and in variegations of manykinds and the size of the flowers hasbeen greatly increasedThey are of easiest culture and shouldbe planted as early as it is possibleto work the ground in the spring Evenif they are nipped by the frost aftercoming up they arc not hurt and thepeas will lie in the ground for weekswithout injurj They should be planted in moderately firm soil and do better if the soil is allowed to get hardabout

sixweeksSmoking an ancient pipe in the milkroom or where there is butter shows atonce that the smoker is not fit to be adairymanA cow should be cared for in proportion to her earnings Perhaps she observes the same rule and pays according to the care she gets InvestigatethisThe cow that is milked slowly makesless butter than she would if milkedquickly This may seem strange butProf Babcock has established the truthof this statementThere is no better absorbent for thecow stable than dry earth Even wherestraw is plentiful the use of earth willkeep the air pure and the platformsdryer than where straw or other litteris depended uponIt is not well to invest in those preparations which are advertised to increase the amount of butter to be madeifrom a given quantity of milk Theamount which can be made is strictlylimited iby the amount of butter fatwhich the milk contains Eural WorldKeeping Exact Dairy RecordsA dairyman should be as much of abusiness man as those in the

gauge and runningin the same track Provide that aftera date to be fixed no wagon carryingover 1000 pounds of freight shall beused unless one axel shall be at leastsix inches longer than the other andthe tread not less than three inchesThe use of such wagons will compelthe removal of rocks or other obstrucxions from the road track and will rolldown keep smooth and level the trackand be the most effiective agency forgood roads that can be deYisea vtoodCRUDE PETROLEUMIt Is an Effective Agent in Compactingr Dirt RoadsFor many years it has been knownthat the use of oil on troubled watersgreatly calms them Recently somerailway companies have experimentedwith it for the purpose of laying dustwhich it is claimed that it will do fora very long time and now its value inimproving country roads is forciblynsserted by J G Winger of GrandValley Pa This gentleman says thathe has devoted his whole life since thediscovery of oil to its development andhas made a study of the great blessingstli at it gives to man and believes thatthe time is not far in the future whendusty and muddy roads will be conditions unknown and that crude oil willbring this reform about The experience on which he principal bases hisopinion he describes in a letter to theOil City DerrickIn the winter of 1894 near GrandValley a small plug was forced outof an oil line and a quantity of oilsxmrted on the road The snow wasthoroughly saturated with oil for aboutone rod in diameter The oil was spreadover the road by the feet of horsesand the action of sleigh runners forthe distance of about four rods Theroads in this valey are clay bottom andvery dusty in dry weather and muddyin wet and it is no unusual thinig tosee dust from three to six inches deepand mud from ten to twenty inches inthe seasonThis bit of road and the crude oilreferred to has attracted my attentionever since for when the dry weatherreturned and dusty roads were thehailing salutation of everyone youmet these particular four rods of roadwere as free from dust as a well keptbrick paved street and after a showerwhen the dusty roads were convertedinto beds of mud this section of roadwas as dry as if no rain had fallenThe writer has explained the phenomenon to many observers who were ignorant of the cause At prebemt andafter the action of three summers andwinters there is still to be seen theunmistakable evidence of the preserving qualities of crude oil 2ow accepting the foregoing observation astruth is it not safe to conclude thata hope for a solution of the greatestpublic questions has a nucleus on whichto rest a hopeOil and earth have an affinity foreach other and when united in properproportions on a roadbed are for along time inseparable The oil on aroad bed prevents the earth from rising in dust and excludes water andhence the impossibility of mud It looksrcasona ble that an oil treated roadproperly shaped will remain mudlesswhen snow falls even in small quantities it will give good sleigning andwhen the snow goes in the spring itwill be ready for comfort pleasure andbusinessIn the employment of crude oil forgood roads no change need be madein the mode of construction now ingeneral use The roadbed should beproperly shaped with machinery andimmediately after working and forming rnd while the earth is loose andbest adapted for the absorbtion of oilthe oil should be applied after the manner of sprinkling streets The quantity of oil to the rod of road can only bedetermined by experiments and actualtests The writers opinion based onobservation is that one barrel of oilto each three rods of road will sufficeThis if the writer has not erred in figures will be oil to the depth of onethird of an inch Current price of oiland cost of applying will determineexpense of treating a mile of roadShould not all join issue for experiments in the interest of good roads anda demand for cheap oilBest Is None Too GoodNo dairyman should be satisfied withauy but the best of course they costmore but the cost of feed for a goodcow is no more than for a poor onewhile the returns are many times greater meither is the care and attentionany more It is a fact that feed laborcare and attention are disproportionatein a poor animal when compared witha good one It is not necessary thatcows should be thoroughbreds tosecure good results excellent animalsare found among natives and gradesand it is these that should be souarhtThe great object should be to securethose descended from well known milkand butter strains Rural WorldDnderdraining RoadbedsWhere the roadbed is made high withthe purpose of keeping it diy it isusually in winter blown clear of snowand therefore freezes very deepiy making all the greater depth of mud for thesoil that has been piled up The onlyeffectual remedy for this is an underdrain the length of the roadbed withside drains into the open ditches at allthe low places If this were done thesurplus water would be drawn from theroadbed so that even if exposed tofrost the soil would not degenerate intomud With the roadbed thus underdrained less than half the stone andgravel now required for road makingwould be neededHow It Helped the FarmersThe beauty of good roads
