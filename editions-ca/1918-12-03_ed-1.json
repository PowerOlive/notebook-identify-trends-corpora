Monday night when it was learned
that -Mr. Peter O'Donnell was in
'twh.' Those who first saw him at a
distance could not realize it was him,
andwere badly frightened, believing
his ghost had appeared in their
midst. Some indeavored to get out
ot the
way as "Pete" approached
them, and as they could go no further
he: made himself known to them and
Jlnally convinced them "that it was
"rot. his ghost, but old "Pete" himself,

old. Kentucky honte'v for several
weeks, returning again to Canada.
Shortly after this Messrs. J. M. and
F.M. Caldwell returned to Kentucky
having -made their fortune. How
ever, Mr. O'Donnell did not return
with therm After the Caldwell
"brothers had sold their possessions in
Canada, O'Donnell left their section
of the country and until last Mon
day night his whereabouts was un
known. Lietters were written to him
repeatedly and also to the postmas
ter of the town in which he had re
sided. It was soon learned that he
had ' gone f rom this - place but had
left ho address. For a long time af
ter this it was known that he had
'money in a Canadian bank, but same
had been uncalled for. His friends
were thoroughly aroused and an ef
fort "was made to locate him, which,
however, was uneffectual. About
fddr years ago the general public
who- had known Mr. O'Donnell came
to the conclusion that he was dead,
andfio the world in which he lived
seftled. down again to its normal

hear such exclamations as, "Poor

decided that he was, in a loud voice

NO WTHAT TJSE WAE IS OVER
Now that the war is over, the gov
ernment should make haste to cut
expenses which are eating up the
country with taxes. Secretary Mc
Adoo now wants six billions instead
of four, and it is said that babies will
not live long enough not to feel the
weight of the taxation that will nec
sarily have to be imposed. Of
course, it will take time to demob
ilize the army, but not a moment
ought to be lost in doing so. There
are now more than three million men
under arms and they are costing mil
lions' of money. An order ought to
be made permitting the retirement
from the army at once all who are
needed at home, and who can show
that a job awaits them. It would be
a hardship to throw millions of men
without prospect of employment on
"their own resources, but those who
can step right into useful employ
ment ought to be released with as lit
tle delay as possible.
Now that the war news is a thing
of the past, we respectfully suggest
that the dailies discontinue their
scare headlines. A great deal of good
white paper has been wasted with
them, the publishers seeming to go
on the nronosition that the average
i man is blind or. can "be fooled with
heads that are often misleading and
do not express the subject matter be
neath them. It was said of Mr. Wat-
terson years ago that he gave orders-
that not a double head should appear
on the first page of the Courier-Journal,
unless a story approaching the
crucifiction of Christ should be cov-

PAT'S SHARP -SHAVE.
( Pittsburg Chronicler-Telegraph )
The unconquerable Pat, being one
day in town, found his way into a
barber's shop to get a shave. As 'it
was near dinner time and the bar
ber was feeling the gnawings of hun
ger he became rather hasty over the
job and was unfortunate in inflicting
several cuts on Pat's cheeks. The
shave being coppleted, Pat arose and,
approaching a table on which was a
glass of water, he took a mouthful
and rocked his head from side to side.
"Anything the matter?" asked the
barber.
"Not much," came Pat's reply. "I
was only trying just to find out
whether my mouth would still hold
water without leaking."
EXPBESS BATES INCREASE AN
NOUNCED BY McADOO.
General increases in express rates
were announced by Director McAdoo,
of the Railroad Administration be
fore his resignation from that office.
East of the Mississippi and north of
the Ohio and Patomac rivers, the new
rates on merchandise will be about
-10 to 17 cents a hundred pounds
more than at present. The increase
on food rates will be about 75 per
cent as much. -
For the remainder of the country,
the merchandise rate will be increas
ed about 10 to 12 cents a hundred
pounds over the present scale andthe
increase in food rates will be approxi-
amtely 75 per cent. The increases,
it was announced', are due to increase
