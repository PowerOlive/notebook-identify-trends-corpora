A SIMPLE TIRE REPAIR
Punctures in the well known Mor
gan Wright tire are mended about
as easily as a man would close a hole
in his finger with a bib of court plas
ter Inside of the inner tube of the
tire lies a long- strip of patching rub
ber like this
sf
By injecting- M W quick repair
cement throug h the puncture into this
inner tube and then pressing- down
on the tire with the thumb like this
the repair strip inside is picked up by
the cement thus closing- the puncture
like this
Very simple but now every rider
should remember these two buts or
he will fail
Before injecting- cement pump up
the tire If you dont the inner tube
will be flabby like this
Kff r l
and the cement will not get inside of
it where the repair strip lies
After the tire has been repaired and
inflated ready for riding- if it still
leaks dont stick the injector into the
puncture again because that will
puncture the repair strip itself like
this
vl m J
and you will have to pull out the inner
tube and make an old fashioned repair
by putting a patch of rubber on the
outside of the inner tube
