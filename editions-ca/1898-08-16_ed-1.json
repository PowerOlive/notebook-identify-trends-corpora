Glass Weaving
I The key to the process of making
glass curtains in connection with knit
material consists in operating particu
lar needles of the machine at the right
1 time and allowing others to remain idle
tor which purpose a set of chain bars is
used so arranged as to render it possi
ble to command the different needles
according to the needs of the process
A chain is made Tip of bars links and
balls like those used on the loom for
weaving cloth and there is a lever at
tached to the shoulder of each needle
and extending from the part where the
goods circle the needles down to the
first bar of the chain the latter resting
in bearings On the turning of a crank
connecting beveled gears motion is im
parted through the agency of an upright
shaft to the chain cylinder and every
time the yarn is delivered to the needles
a revolution is made the chain bar cylin
der presenting a new bar to the levers
of the needles and whenever a ball on
the bar contacts on the lever the needle
to which it belongs is pushed forward
and a mechanical device causes the
needle to operate and form loops thus
knitting There are however blanks
on some of the bars and when these
blanks connect with the levers of the
needles no movement is made Uphol
sterer
Plant Propagation
Some very curious processes for propa
gation are practiced at the public gar
dens One consists in cutting with a
knife a ring around a branch of a plant
One might imagine that the intention
was to kill the branch but such is by
no means the object in view The cut
having been made a piece of wet moss
is wrapped and tied around the branch at
that point Beneath this protection the
sap exudes from the wound and little
rootlets are developed After a few days
the branch is cut away from the parent
stem being then itself a complete plant
with roots all ready to put in a pot
This plan is adopted with plants of slow
growth because one plant may thus be
split up into half a dozen or more of
good size instead of waiting for a
seedling or little slip to develop Wash

Insulted
An American traveler relates that
alighting at a hotel in Granada a man
at the door put out his hand toward
him The traveler supposed that the
man was the porter of the hotel and
offered him his valise The man step
ped back tossed his head and frowned
scornfully Caramba he exolaimed
Do you take me for a porter I would
have you understand that I am no por
ter Indeed Then may I ask you
senor what you are I am a beggar
sir and asked you for alms San
