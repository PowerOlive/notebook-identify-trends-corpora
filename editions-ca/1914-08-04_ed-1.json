There was some disappointment
experienced in the Millersburg Chau
tauqua Thursday afternoon when it
was learned that Maymie Wynne
Cox, the delinerator of negro dialect
and banjo lady, could not be present.
An improvised program was arranged,
made up partly of local talent, and a
lecture on "Home" by Mr. Fish, man
ager of the Flemingsburg Chautau
qua, which was well received. In the
evening a local prelude was made up
of Misses Alma Duke Jones, pianist,
Lucy Jones, vocalist and Annette
Hurst, reader, which was well receiv
ed, and each young lady received nu
merous applause. All were amply re
warded for the time occupied and in
the o lssof Maymie Wynne Cox when
Hon. Alf Taylor, speaker of the even
ing, was introduced, taking for his
subject, "The World's Greatest Ques
tion." Mr. Taylor is perhaps the most
profound thinker that ever stood upon
the Millersburg platform. Every ut
terance abounds in beautiful lan
guage. His thought is deep.
The Chautauqua was continued
Friday afternoon at 2:30 by the Cres
cent Club, a quartette of four young
ladies. These ladies gave a delight
ful, light parlor entertainment. The
violinist was good and played some
artistic numbers in a creditable man
ner. The vocalist and reader did not
come up to the full measure of the
other work of the Chautauqua. In
the evening ex-Ambassador to Mexico,
Hon. Henry Lane Wilson, addressed
us on the Mexican situation. Mr.
Wilson has occupied 13 years in for
eign affairs representing the TJ. S.
Government. He addressed us on the
Mexican situation and gave a history
of the war for the past four years,
and also a brief history of the coun
try for the past thirty years. 'In con
nection with this history he brought
forward a unmber of facts with
which we are not familiar and which
the newspapers have not published.
On Saturday morning at 9:30 the
athletic work of the Chautauqua was
held on the M. M. I. campus. There
were 13 various runs and jumps for
with good prizes were offered, and
were assigned at the evening enter
tainment, the Smith Bros, receiving
the lareer number of them. This
work was under the management of
Messrs. Willams and Sutherland, who
have been with us during the time of
the Chautauqua. Considerable em-

we were greeted by the Mendelsshon
Quartette made up entirely of Ital
ians. They furnished the prelude for
the lecture, playing for half an
hour.
We were then introduced to Theron
Alvin Harmon, of Yankton, S. C, who
delivered perhaps the most pleasing
addres thus far, taking as his subject
the "Way of the Open Road," which
led us through all the various phases
of life" and character. He is a fluent
speaker. In the evening we enjoyed
full concert by the Mendelssons and
Mad. Zoe Pearl Park, which was de
cidedly the best musical aggregation
thus far of the- Chautauqua. The vio
lin solo was sweet and pure. The
pure contralto voice of Mad. Park cap
tivates all, she sang with much ease
and grace. The harpist in his ex
quisite munipulations, was also the
recipient of numerous encores. His
technique was exquisite, and we
hope to have them with us another
1 season. At 10:45 Sunday, Dr. Cross

by the local choir. Dr. Crossfield did

Ex-Attorney-General John H. At

assemblage at the Chautauqua Sun

for his subject, "The Unrest of the
Times." He was by far the most
forceful speaker on the Chautauqua
program, and his address won high
praise from his auditors. The musi

Quartette was a distinct feature of
the program, which was thoroughly
enjoyed by all.

of course, the tango and all the dan
ces came in for a proper share of at
tention. In fact a majority of the
young people were of the younger so
ciety set, who patronize the dance in
all its forms. Some one mentioned
the popular crusade against the
show-it-all style of dresses affected by
the girls, when one demure maiden in
a rear seat who had hitherto not fig
ured largely in the wordfest, piped
up: "I realize that women are by na
ture and instinct bound to go in for
adornment in the matter of dress, but
they are getting more and more ex
travagant recklessly extravagant, I
might add. I believe in temperance
Jn dress." Now it happened that that
was not a temperance crowd. One
bold, independent maid spoke up:
"Temperance is all right. I believe
in temperance myself, but what with
the cobweb stockings, the keep-in-the-shade
skirts, and the open-front
hsirt waists, it looks more to me like
the women were going in for the total
abstinence."

bachelors in the crowd craned their
necks every time a sunny crossing
