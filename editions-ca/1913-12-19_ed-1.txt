C, Dec. 15David P. Houston, Secretarx of Agriculture, to-day published his annualreport for the year 1913. The reportwhich contains only 58 pages, differsJ from previous reports in that, insteador merely reviewing tne -agriculturalsituation, it presents in summarymany broad economic questions.Throughout the report strong emphasis is placed upon co-operation between the Department of Agricultureand other Federal departments andthe State Agricultural agencies to promote co-ordination and eliminate duplication of effort The keynote isgetting the Department's informationin all fields more directly and in morevaluableform to the people. The following are summarized statements ofthe more important subjects and recommendations discussed in thisport:re-The Problem of Production.Increased tenancy, absentee ownership, soils still depleted and exploited, inadequate business methods, the relative failure to induce agreat majority of farmers to applyexisting agricultural knowledge, andthe suggestions of dependence on foreign nations for food supplies warnus of our shortcomings and incite usto additional efforts to increase production. The report states that thereis no ground for thinking that wehave yet approximated the limit ofour output from the soil, but thatwe have just begun to attack theproblem, and have not reached theend -of the pioneer stage, and onlyin a few localities have developedconditions where .reasonably full returns are secured. We have unmistakably reached the period where wemust think and plan. 'Increases Asked.Increases in the appropriations forthe next fiscal year are recommendedas follows:250,860 for extending the work oferadicating animal diseases, feedingand breeding live stock, and for dairying and the, enforcement of the meatinspecting law.$45,660 for the introduction andbreeding of new plants, the controlof plant diseases, .and for improvingthe methods of crop production, especially cereals.$143,541 for the classification of agricultural lands and the survey ofhomesteads in the national forests.$60,441 for extending investigationsof the handling, shipping and storingof poultry, eggs and fish.$24,420 for investigating fertilizerresources, soil fertility and the chemical and physical properties of thesoil. -"$ a,uuu ior extending investigationsof insects attacking deciduous fruits.cereal and (orage crops and foresttrees.$90,000 to enforce the migratorybird law.$57,000 for gathering crop forecasts and estimates.$113,500 for road management androad building and maintenance.$144,000 for investigations of themarketing and distribution of farmproducts.$50,000 for live stock and otherdemonstration work in 'the sugar-caneand cotton areas of Louisiana. .A decreage of $37,340 is made inthe funds of the Weather Bureau.1 made possible by the increased efficiency shown in handling, its work.It is reconimended that the Congressional seed distribution as "nowconducted be discontinued, and that-constructive work, 'in. securing anddistributing new and valuable seedsand plants be substituted.Plan To Re-organize The DepartmentTo promote co-ordination,-, allowgreater latitude in carrying out ofprojects', and tp establish a morelogical handling "of regulatory workand research, investigation and demonstration work, the Secretary willask the Congress in the coming estimates for authority to prepare a planfor re-organizing, redirecting and systemizing the work of the departmentas he increase bf economical andefficient administration may require.This plan would be submitted in thefiscal estimates for 1916. It is believed that the department can bestcarry on its functions and carry itsinformation to the people it seeks toserve, probably by having its workconducted in five or six main groupssuch as. a research service, a regula-I tory service, a State weather serviceand others as special occasion mightwarrant. 0Promotion Dased'OnEfficency.A system of efficiency ratings afIfecting all clerical Vand sub-clerical?--&-.- W I ' , i i il . i -i, .... -employees, designed to eliminate alldanger q 'favoritism and to providefor promotion entirely upon merit, hasbeen established.Increased efficiency and considerable 'economy have been gainedthrough changes in the handling offiscal matters.It is recommended that the department be given authority to increasethe maximum salary of $4,000 whichnow can be paid to scientific investigators It is pointed out that manyof the leaders in the departmentcould command salaries in manycases more 'than twice what they are-receiving.Changes In Weather Bureau.Changes in the organization andwork of the Weather Bureau have resulted in increased efficiency andeconomies which make possible a re-'duction of $37,340 in its funds. Certain stations and sub-stations will beeliminated and the work - of otherstations not well located for animatological work will be limited to forcasting, crop, wanings, flood warningsor forecasting. Full co-operationWith the Hydrographic Office in theNavy Department in the publicationof marine meteorological charts hasbeen effected. Investigational workat Mount Weather will be discontinued and steps to make availablefor scientific work in more suitablelocations the funds thus saved, willbe taken. The crop and flood warning service designed to enable cropcrop growers or those along certainwaterways to have notice inijtime totake protective measures will bestrengthened. The scientific work ofthe Bureau will be empathized, especially in fields having a direct bearing,on agriculture, commerce, navigationand aviation.Postoffice To Aid In Census of CropAcreage.Changes have been made in the organization and work of the Bureau ofStatistics to effect economies and in-crease eumiwuuj. j-u io icv,ummcuuouthat the designation of this Bureaube changed to "The Bureau of Agricultural Forecasts," . which more accuartely defines its functions. Co-operationwith. the. Post Office to testthe practicability of an annual censusof acreage and stock through the rural route carriers has been effected.A committee on co-operation composed of representatives of variousbranches of the department and ofother Federal departments will, it isbelieved, eliminate duplication ofwork and improve statistical results.Increased accuracy of crop forecastswill be secured through improvementin the field forecasts agents, specialcrop reporting system and the fieldservice.Country To Be Districted To EnforceFood and Drug Act.Certain reorganizations have beeneffected in the Bureau of Chemistrylooking toward more effective admininstration of the Food and Drug Actand to greater constructive technological assistance to manufacturers inavoiding waste, reducing cost ofmanufacture and to help them develop purer products which will complywith the law. The contrary will bedivided into several districts each under the direction of a competent offi(Continued on page 6)Mere Is the HogLexington, Ky.BOURBON REMEDY CO.,Enclosed find photo of hog that wascured of cholera with your BourbonHog Cholera Remedy.

'WASHINGTON Dc. 15, The en-ormous 'losses due to forest insectshave led to the formation of a soci-oty for the advancement of forest en-omology in America. Th$ membersof this society hold that the work ofinlets has not Teceived the attentionvhich it deserves.Henry S. Graves, U. S. Forester,he newly elected president of theorganization, said that they were, ingeneral, to call attention to the part.Inch insects play in forest problems,"We have had." he said. "widesDreadand specific interests in insect pestsuch as San Jose cale and the bollweevil, which affect all of us as towhat we eat and what we wear,forest insects through their destruc-Jion of timber increase the cost of a1necessity which enters quite as muchuiu uu.u,y iilc: uj. liic oxiuiviuutti ao uuLilt; yiuuuuui ui lliu iiciu aiiu. uiuuaiu.If the importance of the protectionof our forest resources from insectsis generally recognized, a large partcan be prevented or avoided."Right now in the national foreststhe bureau of entomology and the for-est service are co-operating to stopinsect savages by discovering theirbeginnings, and stamping them out.A few isolated trees attacked by insects may form the nucleus of amountainside devastation quite as serious as that from a forest fire. Theopportunity for combatting insects,however, Is in one respect betterthan in the case of a fire, which runsrapidly, , because it takes severalyears for an insect devastation tospread until it becomes of such proportions as- that which overspread theyellow pine forests in the Black Hillsin 1906. Watchful care on the partof forest officers, lumbermen and private individuals will make it impossible to teach these infestations before they get a good start. By cutting and burning trees, or strippingoff the bark, the insects can be killed.As in all cases, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.""Who make up the memberhip ofthe organization?" was the next question asked of Mr. Graves."It is open .to any "One interestedin the subject," Mr. Graves replied."It seems to me that the relation offorest insects to forest protectiontouches almost every one. Of coursewe expect that new members shallbe recommended by the present membership, which is made up largely ofpersons who have studied the forestproblem at first hand. In order, however, that the objects of the societyshall be kept foremost, it is requiredthat at least four of the seven officers must be chosen from among professional forest entologists. It is expected that honorary vice-presidentsrepresent Federal, State and privateinterests will be elected to promotethe objects of the organization inmany localities throughout the country." "How will these objects be attained?" 'In the first place, the objects ofthe society are largely educational.As in all questions of large publicimportance, the main idea is to givethe public an opportunity to knowjust how important they are. In thesecond place, the society will form ablearing houBe for information, andits meetings will discuss the most advantageous methods of insect control.jfeke, for example, the ravage of theGypsy ,moth and the brown-tail mothm the Northeastern States. If wecan bring about general knowledge ofthese insects and of the harm theydo, and are able to instill into themind of the individual the necessityfor and the proper methods of theircontrol, how much easier it will be tocombat them than when the work isconfined only to governmental agencies !

The olg reptile is theonly original "hunger striker" in thecollection, and her Marathon per-formance in that direction makes allcompetitors "pikers" as comparedwith her achievement."Those English Suffragates are notin it with Princess," said CharlesSnyder, keeper of the reptiles andchief assistant of Raymond L. Ditmars, curator, when speaking recently of his latest attempt to get the".serpent to eat. Snyder says it istwenty-two months since Princesssuddenly decided to solve the cost ofliving problem in the reptile houseby going on a fast."Maybe she wanted to go back toSingapore," said the keeper. Or shemay have wanted to get out like theSuffragette,. Why, Mrs. Pankhurstand Zelie Emerson are amateursalongside Princess."in all the time of her feast the bigphyton has not lost a pound in herweight. She is as active as ever, andher temper has not been noticablydifferent than when she first came touie parK irom ine -ar ujast. Snydersaid it was no unusual thing for apython to go without food for a monthor two at certain seasons of the year."But when the feast was broken afqrty-pound pig generally furnishedsustance for at least another month.The pythons are night eaters, riotGaynor "guzzlers." They are usedto foraging for food, so the keeperdeclared, in the evening hours or inthe early morning. Every time anattempt has been made to feed Princess it has been after sundown.On Saturday night Snyder thoughtPrincess had shown signs of fallingoff the "hunger wagon." He broughtout a, rabbit that had been killedonly a ,few minutes before."I?thought sure Princess would takeit,'" headded. I put it into her cage,and wiggled it about on the floor asif it were alive, but she coiled uptighter and wentto sleep, I gave therabbit to Big Annie, the anaconda,Who went once for three months with-out eating."Two Plymouth Rock hens from thefarm in the Zoological Park were, of-fered to Princess, -out she gave nomore heed than she has at inter-vals 'during the nearly two years ofher fast.While Snyder and his chief, Mr.Ditmars, are not worrying about thepresent condition of the serpent, Sny-der finds himself walkining in thenight trying to figure out how he cancoax the serpent to eat.

They areput at from $35,000,000 to $50,000,-'000; and the sum does not seem un-!reasonable when one remembers thenumber of bridges destroyed, themiles of track washed away, the otherphysical property wiped out, besidesthe loss caused by demoralization oftrain service, delays, extraordinaryoutlay and the future diminution oftransportation business from the ruined districts. Now, ' we should liketo aBk the physical valuation menwhat place in their calculations theyreserve for such unforseeable andenormous impairments of railwayproperty. Will they undertake therole of an earthly Providence, andtell the managers just what the average loss will be from disasters ofthis kind, over a period of years? Or,granting that increased capital expenditure warrants higher freightcharges, would they say that thething for the railroads to do would beto impose higher rates at the verymoment when the people in the afflicted territory are least able to paythem?

AtGallup, McKinley county, New Mexico, the following nationalities wererepresented in a recently establishedevening school; American, Spanish,Slavonian, , Italian, Servian, Austrian,German, French, Danish, SwedishIrish, Scotch, English and CherokeeIndian. Twenty-five different occupations were represented. In agesthe pupils ranged from 15 to 62.Many of them, desired the ordinaryelementary branches, but there wasalso a strong demand for such subjects as bookkeeping, shorthand, typewriting, Spanish, mechanical and architectural drawing., The tragic death of King George,of Greece, who was shot through theheart while walking in the streets ofSalonica, recalls a remark which hisMajesty once made to the effect thathe believed it was fate to die at thehands of the assassin. This was aftera deliberate attempt to kil lhim onFebruary 26, 1898, when he was shotat while driving with his daughter,jrnncess Mane.The determination of assassins ofRoyalty is one of the most remarkable features of these dastardly crimes.No fewer than three attempts weremade on the life of King Humbert,of Italy. On November 17, 1878, tenmonths after his accession to thethrone, a man attempted to stab himwith a dagger, the King escapingwith a slight scratch. The ceondunsuccessful attempt was in 1897,when, a wokman struck at him witha dagger while he was driving to theraces, the murder's blow being againaverted. Three years later, however,the assassin Bresci accomplished hisfellpurpose by shooting King Humbert at Monza.The Emeror Francis Joseph, ofAustria, has reason to be greatly embittered against assassins, for notonly was his wife, the Empress Elizabeth, was fatally stabbed while walking from her hotel at Geneva in 1898,but twice attempts have been madeon his own life. In 1853 a tailor named Libeny tried to stab the monarchin the neck, his knife sliding downthe military cravat of the Emperor'suniform, only a slight wound beinginflicted, while in 1882 he was shot atby a youth named Overdank, theshot, however, missing its inetndedmark.' Four Czars of Russia have beenassassinated, the last being Alexan-der II, in 1881. Six attempts weremade on this monarch's life beforethe fatal end. On one occasion heonly escaped through the barrel ofthe assassin's pistol bursting, whilein 1866, when the dinner hall of thewinter palace was wrecked by an explosion from the cellars, the Emperorowed his life to the fact that the company did not sit down to dinner atthe usual hour, and so the explosionwas ineffective. "Ultimately Alexander was blown to pieces with nitroglycerine while driving through St.Petersburg on March 13, 1881.Three attempts have been made onthe life of the present Czar, the lastbeing iu 1905, when celebrating whatis known as the Twelfth Day Festival. A pavilion had been erected infront of the Winter Palace, and afterthe Czar and Grand Duke had finished prayers in this pavilion, a salute o.f guns was fired from the fortress of St. Peter opposite the palaceon the the other side of the RiverNeva. To the consternation of theattendants, the pole of the bannerover the pavilion was broken in two, 1while the windows of the palace wereshattered. It was afterward discovered that one of the guns from thefortress had been loaded by an unknown hand.Three attempts were made to killQueen Victora, while twice an assassin tried to take the life of the lateKing Edward, hut without success.The last occasion was in 1900, whenSipido tried to shoot King Edward atBrussels.Perhap the most narrow escapewhich Queen Victoria had was whenher life was attempted by RoderickMaclean in 1882 at Windsor Station.Had he been a little more cool or amore excellent shot, this assailantwould most certainly have succeededin his purpose.Christmas Suggestions.BEAUTIFUL ENGRAVING.'A:C440Call and see our samples of embossed Monogram Stationery, Engraved Private Greeting Cards, CallingCards, etc. Place your order now forthe Holiday season.(28-tf) PARIS BOOK STORE.CHRISTMAS WHISKIES.For you Christmas whiskies, wines,etc., try Ed.

Yet theState Board of Health of Kansas saysthat good roads can and will preventdisease. How? By the removal ofweeds and trash. Weeds and trashprevent the prompt evaporation ofmoisture and promote retention ofground water. This makes idealbreeding spots for mosquitoes, fliesand other insects, which are knownas disease carriers, not to mentionchinch bugs, grasshoppers and otherinsects which are crop damagers. Further,more, an undergrowth of weedsinvites the dumping of garbage andmanure by offering concealment, ofwhich fact careless and thoughtlesspeople are prone to take advantage,thus increasing the facilities of insect breeding and providing theseinsects carriers with proper materialfor disease transmission. Good roadalso prevent disease by providing gooddrainage. Many farms have nomeans of drainage except by ditchesalong roadways. Open ditches, clearof brush and debris, with hardenedsurface and proper fall, afford thefarms the opportunity of riddingthemselves of many a stagnant pool.The removal of weeds, proper roadgrading, surface hardening and oilinginsures prompt drainage of all pool,ditch and surface water, removingthe possibility of insect breeders, fornone can multiply without moisture.Road oiling in itself is destructive ofinsect larvae, especially mosquitoes! n. wpll-known fanf.. Tirv rnadn nffprpedestrians, and notably children whoare compelled to walk to and fro fromschool, dry shoes and feet. Whilecolds are due to specific germs, yetit is a well-known fact that cold, wetfeet and chilled limbs lower the resistance of individuals and makesthem more favarable subjects for infections of the respiratory passages,'including pneumonia and tuberculo-i sis.

J "-r .VTHE BOURBON NEWS, PARIS, KENTUCKY, DECEMBER 19, 191mAgricultural Secretary's Report.; (Continued from page 2)cil. All branch labaratories -nd foodinspectors will be under single direction and will work together instead. being independent of each other, acondition which led to lack of co-ordinationin the past. Certain branchlaboratories will be consolidated be--cause the work can be done more effectively and more cheaply in the lapgev; central laboratories which areprovided with, complete equipmentand specilizing chemists. Effor willbe made to make the act more of aiygienic measure through increasedattention to milk, eggs, wasters andfish, which are subject to organic contamination and may become carriersf disease.To bring about greater harmony intie work of the State food officialsand the department in food and drugwork, the Secretary called a conference which was attended by representatives of 32 States, the District ofColumbia, and Porto Rico. It is believed that this conference has promoted much better understanding.' An office which will act as a clearingkouse of information among the Stateand Federal food and drug officialswill be established to prevent duplication of work and promote harmonious action and co-operation. Experience has revealed certain weakmesses in -the food and drug act notably the lack of provision for legalstandards, and its failure to apply to. certain external remedies. The Secretary will ask that authority begranted to prepare and submit suchamendments to this law as may bedeemed needful to safeguard thehealth of the people, establish standards, better define drugs, improve theXooi supply and promote uniformityia the matter of food legislation.Prosecutions Under Food and DrugAct and Oother Regulatory Acts.Prosecutions under the Food andDrugs Act and other regulatory statutes will be expected and made stillsaore effective through co-operationwih the Department of Justice where' by the Solicitor will prepare cases inthe form of criminal informations andplace at the service of the U. S. District Attorneys in the trial of casesthe Department's attorneys who arethoroughly familiar with the highlytechnical and technological aspects ofmany of these causes. Under theFood and Drug Act, 1,048 caseswere transmitted to the Departmentof Justice. Fines amounting to $23,453.50 were imposed in 596 criminalcases, and decrees or condemnationand forfeiture entered in 365 othercases. Eight hundred and sixty-sevenNotices of Judgment were published.The courts have envinced a disposition to impose more severe penaltiesin food and drug cases. Under theMeat-Inspection Act, 81 seeming violations were reported and convictions-secured in 64 cases, in seven carryingsentences of imprisonment. Underthe Live Stock Quarantine Acts, finesaggregating $10,275 were imposed in93 cases. Under the Lacy Act regulating interstate traffic in game, 154cases were submitted, and convictionssecured in 73 actions.

The Twentyeight Hour Law governing the shipment of live stock was vigorously enforced; 1,037 apparent violations werereported and penalties aggregating$61,695 recovered.Marketing.In many direction further production wa.its on better distribution,and the field of distruction presentsproblems which, raise in very graveways the simple issue of justice. Under existing conditions tne farmerdoes not get what he should for hisporduct; the consumer is required topay unfair price, and unnecessaryburdens are imposed under the existing systems of idstribu.tion. No onecan see off-hand just what part of theburden is due to lack of systematicplanning or inefficiency, economicwaste, or to unfair manipulation. Thereport outlines the project in thisfield as covering marketing suveys,methods and costs of marketing, including available market supplies ingiving production rates, demand atconsuming centers, cold and othermethods of storage, marketing systems and prices, and costs of wholesale and retail distribution of farmproducts. Other strides in thisbrance included: Investigation oftransportation problems and the elimination of waste in shipment, studyof city marketing and distribution,study of grades, ana finally co-operativeproduction and marketing. Thenecessity for standardizing agricultural products as a prerequisite toproper marketing is given specialemphasis. The adoption and universal application of one uniform stand--ardfor cotton would result in greatsimplification of all transactions anddo away with, the complex methodsof figuring buyers limits, practically the same results would follow andthe same evils would be removed ifstandard grades for corn and wereunivesrally adopted.The individual farmer acting aloneis helpless before the problems ofrural credit and of marketing. Concentrated action does not mean thatan organization shall attempt to establish a closed market and to fix theprices. This should be condemned asstrongly in one field of industry as inany other. . .It is recommended that provisionbe made for the establishment ofgrading standards for various farmproducts and for the promulgation ofthe standards already established bythe Department for cotton and corngardes.Rurl Credit.Condition vary widely in the UnitedStates Farmers do not equally needGALLEY TWO . . .;bette credit arrangements and all sections are not similarly circumstancedThe report cites the variation of theintrests paid by farmers on long andshort time loans as among States andas among different sections of thesame area. Among "the many factorsentering into these variations are climatic conditions, soil conditons, stablity of industry, methods of farming,distance from markets, distance fromcenters of large wealth, the nature ofQroQI98:juctncial agencies through" wliichcapitals is secured.'When all necessary allowance has'been made for these fundamental.actors, it is probably clear that the-ural communities are not as' efficiently served as they should be by existing financial arrangements. Longtime loans are .needed for permanentnvestments, such as the purchaseprice of a farm for the erection ofouildings. It is wise economy to encourage the extension of credit forsafe productive use, and no less wiseto discourage the use of capitalalong non-productive or speculativelines. The rapid increase in farmvalhes and the difficulties in securing land has given impetus to the importance of devising farm loans onterms such as will enable the producers to make the necessary paymentson the interest and principal, so faras possible, from the returns of theland itself.The report also -discusses shorttime loans, building and loan associations, land debentures, land mortgage,banks and various other domestican dforeign metohds of rural investment and credit mechanisms. Theredoes not appear to be need for uniqueor special legislation or for legislation which shall aim to give the farmer credit on easier terms than anyother members, of society. What isneeded is the creation of conditionsand machinery which shall enable himon similar credit foundations to secure money at the same rates asthose Oat prevail for othrer classesand for other sections.Other Rural Organization Problems.Even though the problem of howthe farmer can best sell his productand can improve the conditions underwhich he can sell his product andcan improve the conditions underwhich he can secure the necessarycapital were solved, there would stillremain , vital tilings to be accomplished before rural life can be made fully efficient, profitable, healthful, pleasurable and attractive, and before alarger disposition to remain on thefarm develops. Good roads are prerequisite for better marketing, forbetter schools, and for more comfortable rural living. Better sanitation'and hygiene in the home, in theschool and in the community are justas vital for the rural community asfor the urban.To Study Disease Carrying InsectsWhich Affect Agriculture.II The effect of the malaria-carryingJ mosquito on agricultural productionihas been made the subject of investitgation on Southern nlantations. At-, tention will be given to other disease- Viransmimng insects, such as thehouse fly, stable fly and spotted fevertick, which have a bearing on thehealth of rural populations. Satisfactory progress has been made in astudy to discover means whereby thebreeding of flies in manure may beprevented without lessening its fertilizing value.Soil Surveys.The value of the soil survey workwill be enhanced by giving prece'dence in surveys to those Stateswhich offer active co-operation. Nineteen States during tne past year haveentered into this plan.- Reconnaissance surveys will be confined, toI classification of agricultural lands inthe National Forests and the undeveloped areas of the community ,The Farm Woman.To gain information that would enable the Department better to serverural women, the Secretary addressed letters of inpuiry to the women on55,000 selected farms covering everycounty. Other surveys and studiejswere also conducted. Analysis of thesmall port of the letters as yet digested shows that farm women desire assistance in all phases of homemanagement, especially as to ways ofsecuring running water, intorducinghoushold power machinery and laborsaving arrangements, and providingbetter hygienic and sanitary conditions. Many seek advice as to thebetter making of the articles of proruct. Others ask the Department, toprove to the man that their work isworth something in dollars and cents.The overworked women and childrenand difficulty of securing domestichelp are mentioned by a number of"the writers. These letters havesfurnished valuable suggestions for constructive work in this .field. The Department believes that intelligenthelp to women in matters of homemanagement will contribute directlyto the agricultural success of thefarm. It proposes, therefore, to askCongress lor means and authority tomake more complete studies of domestic conditions on the farm, to experiment with labor-saving devicesand methods, and to study completelythe question of practical sanitationand hygienic protection for the farmand family.Reajons With State CollegesStations.andTo eliminate duplication of effortand friction" and bring about greaterco-ordinaion between the State landgrant colleges and experiment stations and the Department, severalconferences were held with representatives of these institutions. TheExecutive Committee and the Secretary signed a memorandum formulating certain views. In substance,this memorandum holds that the Department's primary function is to undertake the study of problems andregulatory work hat are moreparticlarly regional, interstete alid international in character and that uponthe station should rest the responsibility of investigating problems within is State. Provision is made forunion effort where co-operation seemsnecessary. Committees on projectsand correlation of work, relations andpublication of research will be appointed to bring about closer relations. It was agreed that the exten-,sion and demonstration. servicethough which information is carrieddirectly to the people should shouldbe administered under thu immediatedirection of the colleges ; that extension .service projects maintained by ;Federal funds should be entered upon,only a'fter mutual approval by the de- jpartmqnt and the colleges, and that iFederal funds be distributed and exnended. under proper. Federal check:and that extension appropriations bylP'the States be under State 'controlsThe Congress will be asked to provide necessary legislation, which isembodied in the Smith-Lever bill toestablish machinery for extensionwork throughout the States . bringabout a decentralization in this workand enable the Department to conduct this service with the full co-operationof the agricultural colleges.Legislation whereby the department,the colleges and the stations may coordinate their research activities andavoid duplication Oi work should beenacted. The Department is of theopinion that in the administration ofthe Hatch and Adams Acts, it will regard unwarranted change in the personnel and unnecessary interruptionof projects as calling for inquiry andpossibly warranting the withholdingof funds.Federal Road. Policies.There has been a steady movementfor better roads during the past 20years, and today 34 States have highway commissioin or some other Statehighway agency. The total annualexpenditure of the State for construction and maintenance of roadswhich ten years ago amounted to but$2,000,000, has grown to $43,00,000in 1912. The Federal Governmentshould take the lead in investigational and experimental work, and thereis need for a "central agency whichcan furnish best information on allproblems of road building and maintenance. Recently Congress made anappropriation of $500,000 for improving post roads, expenditure to becontingent on the appropriation ofdouble the amount of money by theState or local subdivision. If Federalaid is to be furather extended inhighway development, legislation tothat end should incorporate this cooperative principle. The FederalGovernment should deal with theState as the lowest unit, through anexpert highway commissioner as itsagency. The plan should provide' formaintenance as well as construction.Preference should be given to the improvement of roads over which proproducts from farms can be taken tothe nearest railway station. Ascheme of road construction andmaintenance within a State should bedeveloped and mutually agreed upon.Money appropriated by the FederalGovernment should be apportionedon the basis of such factors as totalpopulation, farm population, area,taxable valuation, and mileage.Power and Recreational Permits inthe National Forests.The National Forests are beingclassified to segregate lands valuable!for agriculture ana to esiaunsii. permanent boundaries for timber production and water protection. Theearnings from timber sales and other sources increased $300,000, or 15per cent, over 1912. The forestsshould produce all the timber theycan and supply the public need atlowest possible cost under conditionsthat protect the public against mo- jnopoly. 'Seventy-six water-power projects ihave been developed and thirty moreare under consideration. The lawpermitting only a revocable franchiseshould be changed to allow a 50-yearnermit for nower nurnoses. under jprovisions protecting the investorand the public.Future use oE the 167,000,000 acres,which does not interfere with moreimportant employment, should be encouraged; the people should get thehighest net total of recreational andother benefit from them. Fifteenthousand special permits for variouspurposes are in force, and last yearover 1,500,000 visitors made recreational use of the forests. Legislation is needed to allow term permitsfor the construction of hotel and cottages, and for certain recreationaluse of the forests, with safeguardsagainst damage, vandalism and contamination of water. Twelve hun-dred cities and towns now draw their jwater supply from these watersheds.Adequate legal authority to preventwater pollution and permit sanitaryregulation of watersheds is sorelyneeded.The Crop Outlook.Special emphasis is laid on thefact that that the figures for .thecrops quoted are estimates, and it ispointed out that this fact should beconstantly kept in min'd. From theestimates at hand it appears thatthe production of crops in 1913 wasmaterially below the average, theyield per acre of all crops combinedbeing smaller than in any year in theDast decade with the exception of1911. The corn crop, the most valuable product of this country, accord-!ing to the estimates, fell below 2,500,-1000,000 bushels, which is smallerthanany crop since 1903. Wheatproduction, with an estimated totalof 753,000,000 bushels, is the largesteVer recorded in this country, Thiscrop was nature J before the drought Ibecame effective. Brief mention is jmade as to crop conditions through- jout the world. Fro mthe estimatesit appears that there were increasedareas sown to wheat, oats, barley, ,rye and corn, and that the wheat!acreage has probably yielded a recordOut-turn. Barley, oatjs and rye are ,bountiful crops, but corn wil 1 probably give the poorest results in 1 20years.- "'" ICALIFORNIAMVOMAN ;' SERIOUSLY ALARMED.-I"X short time ago I contracted a jsevere cold which settled on my lungsand caused me a great deal of annoyance.
