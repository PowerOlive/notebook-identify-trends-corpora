KENTUCKY SHOULD OWN MAM
MOTH CAVE
(Frankfort State Journal)
Twenty-six States have establish
ed, or have on' foot, projects to es
tablish State parks.
A few States are fortunate in
having national parks.
Kentucky has no State park and
has no plan to procure one.
Kentucky has a chance to get a
national park by acquiring land
about the entrance of Mammoth
Cave and letting the Federal Gov
ernment make it a national park.
The Secretary of the Interior is in
terested in the idea.
Provided the necessary land can
be procured reasonably it should be
a gilt edge investment for the State.
Public reservations are valued in
other States not on sentimental
grounds merely, but as having a
"gate money" valae; as attractions
which cause money to be spent in
the State by travelers who come into
the State and by citizens of the State
who spend their holidays and their
holiday funds at home.
Of course, Kentucky cannot afford
reckless expenditures, but a national
park is worth getting if it can be
procured without reckless expendi
ture. MAY LOSE PEEE DELIVEEY
If Congress acts upon the recom
mendation of Postmaster General
Hays the people of the following
small towns in Kentucky which now
have free mail delivery service will
have it discontinued: -Berea, Carlisle,-
Carrollton, Clinton, Corbin,
Dawson Springs, Eminence, Fal
mouth, Franklin, Greenville, La
grange, Lawrenceburg, Morganfield,
Murray, Pikevllle, Princeton, Provi
dnce, Stanford, Sturgis, Walton and
Williamstown.

Recruiting for the regular army
has been resumed. The picturesque

hundreds of young men anxious to

The staff and technical depart

Fort Thomas is the training center,
is leading the country in securing

to the popularity of Fort Thomas,
which post ranks second to none in
the matter of athletic diversions.
