Paris' Fire Chief Exonorated.
Henry McGinley, chief of. the Paris
fire department, against whom charges
were preferred everal weeks ago and
which,have been under the course of
investigation bt the membars of the
fire committee of Hie City Council,
was exonerated in a report presented
to the council at its meeting last
night.
The report recites that after inves
tigating the affair fully it was found
that the charges that McGinley appro
priated certain articles of the city for
his own use were not only false but
absolutely without foundation. It is
as folluws
"To the Mayor and Board of Council
of the City ot Paria, Ky.
"Gentlemen Some time -ago certain
charges and statements affecting the
conduct and honesty ot Henry McGin
lev, chief of tha fire department,
were made, said charges being set
out in articles'appearing in .' the vari
ous newspapers published in ths .city.
These chargss were to the effect
that Mr. McGinley had appropriated
certain property belonging to the citv
and converting it to his own use.
When these matters were made public
the chairman of the engine and hose
committee brought themto the atten
tion of this body and that committee
was ordered to make an investigation
of the whole affair. That order has
been carried into effect and we, the
undersigned members of the above
mentioned committee, submit Jhe fol
lowing report:
"After a careful, thorough "and
painstaking investigation of the
charges that Henry McGinley had ap
propriated to his own use certain prop
erty of the city of Paris, wo are of
the opinion that such ehargesjwere not
onlv falbe but absolutely without fcun
dation, and we hereby exonerate Mr.
McGinley from anv and all charges of
wrongdoing. In justice to Mr. McGin
ley, who has been a faithful and effici
ent employe of the city for many
years, we suggest that thi3 report,
when adopted be spread upon the min
utes and published in every newspaper
in Paris so that his vindication may
obtain the same publicity that the
charges did.
"Respectfully submitted,
"D. C. PARRISH,
"W. T. BROOKS,
"Committee."
When the report was presented to
the council and adopted a motion was
made to suspend J. W. King, a member
of the department; who, it ib alleged,
preferred the charges against McGin
ley, but by a vote of four to three he
was sustained in his present capacity.
The council elected Mr. William. Col
lins city electrician to serve in the
position made vacant by the resigna
vion of Chas. Thomas several weeks
ago. Mr. Collins has been acting by
order of the fire commtitee since De
cember 15. He was formerly connect
ed with the East Tennessee TeleDhone
Co.
Mr. Catesby Spears, recently ap
pointed a member of the hoard of trus
tees of the-W. W. Massie Memorial
Hospital, presented a communication
to the council to the effect hut owing
to Dusiness arrangements which kept
him in Canada a greater portion of his
time he would be forcod to decline the
honor, and Mayor Hinton apDointed
Prof. W. L. Yerkes, of this city, in
his stead.

Humility First.
We shall never be the "light of the
"world" except on condition of being
the "salt of the earth." You have to
do the humble, inconspicuous, silent
work of checking corruption by a pure
example before yon can aspire to fio
the other work of ravins out light into
the darkness, and so drawing men to
Christ himself. Alexander iMcLaren.
