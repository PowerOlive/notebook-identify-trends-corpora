NORMA TALMADGE, IN "THEi
MOTH," T0-M0RR0W.
From a would-be modern Celopa
tra trifling with fate and forever in
pursuit of pleasure to an unselfish
and devoted woman wrapped up in
her two small children that is the
character transaction portrayed by
the versatile Norma fTalmadge in
her screen impersonation of the
heroine of "The Moth," her newest
Selznick-Picture, which will be at
The Alamo and the Paris Grand,
to-morrow afternoon auv evening.
Abounding in emotional possibili
ties and dramatic incidents, the plot
is calculated to give the charming
young star an opportunity to add
one more artistic interpretation to
her already amazing list of suc
cesses. "The Moth" tells the story of a
young girl of wealth and social posi
tion who determines to emulate the
example of Cleopatra and "flirt her
way to immortality."
In this case "The Moth" is a
young society woman who wastes
her time seeking diversion and
flirting with fate until sharply
brought to her senses by a dramatic
incident calculated to thrill the
most blase of movie fans.
