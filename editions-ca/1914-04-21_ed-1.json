Twenty- one out of the twenty-four
members of the Bible Class were also
present. The exercises were under
the management of Rev. A. S. Ven
able, pastor of the church and teacher
of the class. He also acted as toast
master for the occasion. About eight
o'clock all of the guests were present
and were assigned their places at the
various tables, and as soon as this
was the program began. The pro
gram was opened by a song, "Onward
Christian Soldiers,"- by the class, fol
lowed by a prayer, and welcome ad
dress by Thomas McClintock. The
quartette composed of Cochran, Ven
able, Barnes and Herbert, The ban
quet was then served by the Pastors'
Aid Society of the church, composed
of thirty, twenty-five of whom were
present. After the feast was. over the
program was then continued as fol
lows: "How to Build Up a Men's Bible
Class," by Mr. Shanklin; Quartette;
"Value .of Bible Study," Dr. B. M.
Shive; Organ Solo, Capt Freas; Sub
ject selected, Rev. Verhulst;' Quar
Recitation, Rev. Venable; Closing ad
dress, Pastor; Quartette. Rev. Ven
able made an excellent toastmaster,
and quite a bit of humor was indulged
in as he introduced each speaker. The
addresses of Dr. Shive, of Paris, and
Rev. Verhulst, of Carlisle, were es
pecially good. The occasion was very
enjoyable. The social feature of the
Sunday school will be indulged in
more frequently in -the future than it
has in the past.
The opening game of the M. M.
I. base ball team was played Satur
day afternoon with the Lexington
High School on the grounds of the-latter.
The score resulted 8 to 7 in fa
vor of Lexington. " Notwithstanding
the fact that M. M. I. went down in
defeat they played a brilliant game.
The team is being coached by Capt.
A. H. Miller, and the prospects are
llattering for a good season. A com
plete schedule of the season will De
announced later.
The most brilliant piano recital
given in Millersburg in years ywas the
one given by Miss Alma Duke Jones,
assisted by Miss Esther Thiele, Satur
day evening at the M. F. C. auditori
um, under the auspices oi the McDow
ell Musical Club. Miss Jones being
a Millersburg girl, and a promising
young artist, naturally drew a large
crowd. The audience began assem
bling early, and it was certainly an
audience of culture. Miss Jones is a
graduate in music of the M. F. C, and
entered, the Cincinnati Conservatory
of Music last September. She was
thought to be brilliant when she com
pleted her course here, and every pos
sible hope for her future has thus far
been realized. Her improvement has
indeed been very marked, and she
gives promise of -being one of the
most brilliant pianists in Kentucky.
This, too, in view of the fact that she
is but eighteen years old. Miss
Thiele, who is in the Conserdvatory
with her, is certainly a promising
voung vocalist. She is but nineteen

The program while classical, was not
tedious. It was divided into five
parts, two each for Miss Jones
Miss Thiele. The fifth part of
program was the most brilliant
the most difficult. Misses Jones
Thiele were the recipients of showers
of compliments, and at the close of
the entertainment an informal recep
tion was held in the parlors of the
College. So enthusiastic was the au
dience that most everyone present
took advantage of this opportunity.
