Campbell Cantrill,one of the largest growers of burley Is tobacco m Scott county, in an address to about 1,000 tobacco growersVHere Monday endorsed without reser?y vation the contract of the Burley To-oacco luarneuug -tt-ssuciaiion anaurged his neighbors to join the association. Almost every man in theaudience, which filled the courthouse,rose when Congressman Cantrill, atthe "close of his -address asked those"who favored the plan of obtainingbetter prices for the growers tostand up.v v Not only did Congressman Cantrill" go on record as favoring the contractof the marketing association, but he, t answered objections of those who hadobjfcted to entering the association.'He said he had heard in some quarters the objection advanced that themovement was a "scheme" to unloadthe warehouses on the farmers." Heanswered this by showing that, according to the rates charged by thewarehouses last year and the pro--posedrate under the new system, thegrowers would save $300,000 a yearwith tobacco at 10 cents a pound,based on the normal crop of 300,000,000 pounds, and that if the cropbrought a better price the savingwould be in proportion, and that atthe end, of five years the farmersthemselves would own the warehouse.-tC,-- Can Borrow On Receipts' Congressman Cantrill made an inspiring address, an appeal to thegrowers of home county to standtogether to prevent the organised"-buyers from ''taking your tobacco,away from you," and said thatif -the growers did go into the organization they would, be enable to bbrtow on their warehouse receipts asonuch of an advance on their tobaccothis yea? oa the entire price wouldamount td if the farmers, withoutOrganization would dump their cropson .the market as they did last year."Rather than go under the presentsystem," he declared, "I would hope.that not another tobacco plant is everset out again in Kentucky.Recalling the success of the cut-outof 1908, Congressman Cantrill declared the pooling of 75 per cent ofthis year's crop would be practicallya cut-out, so far as the manufacturerswere concerned and that they would"you to name your price for your tobacco," instead ot tne iarmers dumping it on the market and taking whatever they could get for it.Congressman Cantrill told of the- new federal warehousing act that hadbeen made a law by congress andsaid that under this- act there wouldbe no dangers that the farmers wouldnot be able to finance their undertaking, for the warehouse receipts,he said, would "constitute the bestcollateral in the world" for any loansthe farmers might need, that localbanks would be able to handle theseadvances, and if they were not, outside banks would be glad to loanmoney on such a gilt-edge security."Only Hope of Growers"Quite a number of women werein the audience and not a man lefthis place until Mr. Cantrill had finshed. Practically every big tobaccogrower in the county was in attendance and after the address of Congressman Cantrill many came forward and signed the contracts withthe marketing association.Cantrill made an unanswerable argument for the contract, assertingthat it was"the only hope of thegrowers of the burley district" andthat "if you farmers do not sign thiscontract the tobacco trust will comedown here in ELenucky and take your;rop away from you, just as they didlast year, while if you do sign andmake it nossible to obtain pledges of75 per cent of the acreage, it is notat all impossible that you will4 get anaverage of 35 to 40 cents a pound foryour tobacco."Mr. Cantrill was introduced byChairman Reuben F. Offutt, of Scottcounty. " He said that no matter howbusy Mr. Cantrill might be in Congress, he always came back home tolielp his neighbors in any trouble. Herecalled Mr. Cantrill's services toformer burley pooling movements anddeclared that had the growers heededMr. CantrilPs advice last year to keepthe low grades off the market, Scottcounty alone would have been$1,000,000 better off.Farmers Facing CrisisIn opening hs address Mr. Cantrilldeclared that the growers are facinga great crisis and that it lies entirely-within their own hands whether thepresent "depression and want andpoverty in the burley district is tocontinue," or "peace, happiness andplenty shall be the lot of the farmerin this God-given land of ours." He- said he had given the contract offeredto the growers his careful and painstaking consideration and that as a.. result "he intended fo contract all of"his tobacco and do everything withinhis power to induce every one of hisneighbors to do so. He said he believed it his duty fo do this, as a citizen, as a tobacco grower, and as anofficial, in order to bring about theadoption of what he regarded as theonly feasible plan to bring prosDiiWaddeirsPile RemedyWt Suffer EWt be Operatedit yoa here tried Dr. WfcddelT.dy. AbrelntelykriUn. Gau.to fr dbaolatt Wtiafftc6oa orFwnhrT $LSOprfcoqt-If bo write."rfm qperity' and happiness to growers ofthe Burley district.He urged a determined and unitedstand on the part of the growers tosend word to other counties thatScott county growers "intend to havej justice."The Congressman then went intoan explanation of the amount to bepledged and the time for which it wasto be pledged. Recalling the constantcampaign made necessary under theold burley pooling plan because of thefact that the tobacco was pledged foronly a year at the time, he said that ifthe plan was a success one year -itwould be a success for five years andthat unless 75 per cent of the cropwas pledged by November 15 not aman would be bound by the contract.Outsiders Profited by PoolHe told how Scott county, in theold days, stood 85 per cent for thepool, a larger proportion of the tobacco grown probably than any of theCentral Kentucky counties, at a timewhen not over 35 to 40 per cent ofthe crop was actually in the pool. Thetwo-thirds who stayed out of thepool, he said, profited by the priceconditions created by the one-thirdwho went in. He said that if such apool as the old one could increaseprices as it did, how much more successful would one be which includedthree-fourths of the crop.Congressman. Cantrill said the California plan was simply the Kentuckyplan of 12 years ago, strengthened bythe provision that 75 per cent of thecrop must be pledged or the contractswould be void, and with the five-yearfeature instead of the yearly contractprovided for under the old Burleypool contacts. Otherwise, he said, .the npw contract waS tlje e&me thingin principile as the contracts thatwere offered in former pooling campaigns, "When 76 per cent of us get together," said the Congressman, "wecan set out our own prices, and as atobacco grower I intend to stand withmy neighbors. If 75 per cent of ,theacreage pledged to be handled as ifsold by one man can stabilize themarket for one year and make itprofitable for you to grow tobacco, itwill do it for five years, and so youneed have no fears on that account."Can Demand Own PriceHe pointed out that the contractprovides "representative governmentof the growers.44 He said the growersin each county would name the manthey thought best fitted and mostworthy of their confidence to represent them and that this was the samesystem of government in force in city,state and nation, and by which banks,churches and all other successful organizations were governed,"These men of your own selection," he said, "will handle your tobacco, sell it and divide the proceedsamong you who produce it.""You and I know," he said, "fromprevious sad experience, that whenwe sell our crops as individuals tothe buyers acting practically as oneman, we get the hot end of the deal.It is inevitable that this should be soand it will contnue inevitable untilwe adopt the same system of sellingthe manufacturers have adopted forthe buying end of the business. Banded together in union 40,000 strong wecan demand and receive a. fair pricefor our product."Half the farmers in the UnitedStates, Mr. Cantrill said, are in astate of suspense over the conditionof their business, facing the possibleloss of their homes through failureto make payments on mortgage indebtedness, which he declared had increased 400 per cent over the mortgage debt of five years ago. ""Vhynot take advantage of the only hopethere is for us?" he asked. "Whynot, as red blooded Americans, jointogether for the protection of ourproperty and our fireside?"Warns Against Low PricesMr. Cantrill warned the growersthat the probability was that if theydid not get together they would receive from 8 to 12 cents? a nnimH fnrtheir tobacco, on the average, but saidinat ii xney put through the contractunder its terms and joined the association in numbers called for by thecontract by November 15, it was notat all improbable that they would get35 to 40 cents a pound, on the average, for their 1921 cropDeclaring that conditions for thefarmer could not well be worse, hesaid that there was nothing to loseby joining the associaiton and combining to market their crop throughone selling agency. He said thatwhen the cut-out went into effect andthe time to plant tobacco passed withno crop set out in Kentucky themanufacturers hurried their mendown to Kentucky to do business withthe pool and they asked the growerswhat they would take for their pooledcrops of 1907 and previous years, and;;;? nrrr1: - '? periV J.T. ""-' y i-cquneu Dy tne terms2f-ii ?ntFact is pledged, Mr. Cantrill said, the manufacturers wouldagain send their men to Kentucky,asking what the united growers wouldtake for their crop.Mr. uantrill declared thetobaccomanutacturers mademost of tlim-piiuxiey out oi ouriey tobacco. Theleading brands of cigarettes, he said,were made of burley and the growerneed have no fear of any substitutebeing used, for the manufacturershad educated the American smoker toburley and he would have no othereven if they4 tried to substitute another kind for the burley,"Your day of salvation is at hand,"he said. "The door of hope is openTake a stand now, I appeal to you, sothat when I go into other counties,as I expect to do, I can point withP"?e J my home county as onewhich has pledged all its tobacco tothe marketing association."CARLISLE POSTMASTER OFFERSTO BESIGNPostmaster A.

Just a fewbottles have relieved me of a caseof rheumatism, nervousness and indigestion that had troubled me fortwenty-three years" said Mrs. NannieChappell, 31713 Fourth Street, Louisville, Ky."Sometimes my legs hurt me so Icouldn't walk and I 'couldn't raisemy hands to comb my hair. I hadseveral attacks every year aalwhile they were on I could neitherget up nor down without help. Myappetite left me and everything I atedisagreed with me."My son persuaded me to try Tanlac and it's just wonderful the changethat came over me in a short time.I feel like a different person now,every sign of the rheumatism isgone and I sleep sound all nightlong. Tanlac is certainly a finemedicine for "old people and I willgladly tell anyone personally whatit has done for me."When people grow to the ripe oldage of Mrs. Chappell their .digestiveorans lack vitality and begin to actmore slowly and less effectually thanin youth. The-circulation becomespoor, the bloodj gets thin, the appetite fails and the digestion weakens. Tanlac, the powerful reconstructive tonic, is the strength andbody-builder for old folks, becauseit creates an appetite, strengthensdigestion and, in a natural way,strengthens and invigorates rundown, nervous and aged people.Tanlac is sold by all leading drugstores.
