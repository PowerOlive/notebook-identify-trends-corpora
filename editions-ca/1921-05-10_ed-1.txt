TheFox play presents Kentucky in a wayto excite feelings ordinarily dormanti in the breast of the Kentuckian,Dusiiy engaged in anairs or seeminglymore pressing concern. There is adistinction and dignity in the storynot confined to the picturization ofthe Bluegrass and the Capitol. Theinnate nobility of the blood of thetrue Kentuckian is brought out injthe cabin on the hillside as force-xuuy as in tne lanascapea gardensof the rich.Too little has been known of theoriginal of "My Old KentuckyHome." The recent republication ofYoung E. Allison's notable sketchof the Rowans in whose house of hospitality Stephen Collins Foster wasinspired to write the immortal melody, must have force in bringingKentucky people to a realization ofwhat Kentucky meant, in honor,chivalry, and accomplishment tothose who were Kentuckians whenthe foundations of to-day's rich heritage were laid. It cost somethingto be a Kentuckian in those days.State pride was built on a firm determination to uphold State tradition atany sacrifice, life itself being heldlightly in the balance against thethings that made life precious.To-day the claim of being a Kentuckian falls glibly from the lips.The duelling days are over and thefruit of the early planting is gathered in comparative ease. The test ofState pride is not so great a testnow, for it is merely a call upon allreal Kentuckians to pay tribute tothe memory of one who put Kentucky and the Kentucky home intothe hearts of millions who must envythe sons and daughters of a favoredland. To pay homage properly willrequire a little sacrifice in money,but it is worth a great deal to subscribe as a Kentuckian.ing-up of enen;en caused by hrThe crispness andflavorofCraJefr area delight to the taste.Made by Potum Cereal CoIncBattle Creek, Mic)CORNSLift Off with FingersM FJ J ixVisit Mabley's, CincinnatiOr use our Proficient Personal ServiceBureau, which is of invaluable assistanceto Our Customers' in this Community- - rThe May days are here the time when everybody is donningnew apparel.There is an added pleasure in shopping personally at Mabley's,of course, but shopping in person is not at all necessary,--Our Personal Service Bureau serves our friends in this community as carefully, as accurately, as interestedly and as courteously as Mabley's does its personal shoppers.It is the pride of the Personal Service Fureau to fill all ordersthe sameday they are received.fWefyfabley 'and (aiew (aCINCINNATI'S CREATES?
