Just a
little Pain
iS -
The first touch of Rheumatism is a
- fair warning of much torture to follow
-The little pains which dart through the
body are not so severe at first possibly a
mere pang and cause little
ieitce but if the warning is unheeded
tbey will multiply rapidly and increase
Am severity until they become almost
iirvjikearable
Rheumatism as a rule is much severer
-lie winter though many are so afflicted
with it that they are crippled all the
ryear round Those who felt its first
last year may be sure that with
the first season of cold or disagreeable
weather the mild pain of last year will
refitrn as a severe one and become more
ana more intense until the disease has
them completely in its grasp
Being a disease of the blood of the
ost obstinate type Rheumatism can
Tbeicured only by a real blood remedy
No liniments or ointments can possibly
legch the disease Swifts Specific
S S S is the only cure for Rheuma
tism because it is the only blood remedy
thatgoes down to the very bottom of arl
obstinate blood troubles and cures cases
whch other remedies cannot reach
Capt O E Hughes the popular rail
road man of Columbia S C says
At first I paid very little attention to
the little pains but they became so
miich sharper and more frequent that
before long I was almost disabled The
diease attacked my muscles which
would swell to many times their natural
sie and give me the most intense pain
I was ready to doubt that Rheuma
tism could be cured when I was advised
to try S S S This remedy seemed to
get right at the cause of the disease and
soon cured me completely I believe
that S S S is the only cure for Rheu
aaatism for I have had no return of the
disease for eight years
The mercurial and potash remedies
which the doctors always prescribe for
Xjieumatism only aggravate the trouble
ad cause a stiffness in the joints and
kciiing of thebones which add so much to
the distress of the disease besides serious
lyaffecting the digestive organs SSS
Swifts Specific is the only cure for
Jieumatism because it is absolutely free
jpm potash mercury or other minerals
cSs the onlv blood remedv enaranteed
purely Vegetable
and never fails to cure Rheumatism
Catarrh Scrofula Contagious Blood
Poison Cancer Eczema or any other
blood disease no matter how obstinate

before the actual beginning of the showj
Mr John Martin of Sharpsburg has mveaband concert and Mr
Jl I 1 -
been the guest or inenaa
eral days
Btulkimton weuld begin to get in hi
fine work there As the people listened
to his first thunderous oomphahs they-
were amazed But when they heard the
canvas of the great tent flap in unison
with the blasts of his horn they all
laughed and thereafter throughout the
performance they all paid close atten
tion when Enos raised the instrument
We tried of course always to make
a route for the show that wouldnt conX
flict with anybody else for there were
plenty of towns that wouldnt stand bmV
one show at a time Two would lose
money in them however good they
might be But sometimes we ran against
some stubborn man that wouldnt give
way and then there was nothing to do
but to show and beat him if we could
Once when we struck a town with
another show we learned somehow that
they had a great bass horn player in
their band and of course we challenged
em for a contest And they took up the
challenge very -promptly There wasnt
much time to prepare for it but we
billed the town in an hour and got per
mission to put up a stand on the public
square because it was to be a free ex
hibition and that attracted attention
The contest was at noon and of
course the two bands played as accom
panists of the horn players And that
made a big band concert and the crowd
was something enormous The terms
were that each man was to play once
and then a vote of the people was to be
taken The man defeated in that round
had a right to call for another If the
man defeated in the first round won the
second the man who won the first
round had a right to oall for a third
round But the winner of two rounds
by the vote of the people was to be de
clared the winner of the contest -
Well the men in our show bet
every dollar they could rake and scrape
on Enos and some of the more gentle
hearted of them thought they werejnstj
robbing the men in the other snow yur
old man not only bet all his money ut
he bet the idol of his Heart the famous
old giraffe of our show against the
other shows moth eaten buffalo and he
was so dead sure that he threw in a cin
namon bear to boot
Our side had the first inning and
our band showed em How to play and
then Enos stood up for his solo And
j how he did make the thunder 1 It was
joomphah oomphah oomphahl as it
had never been heard before and he
fairly carried the people off their feet
Then the other band played a tune
and their man got up And theres no
use talking he raised more thunder
than Enos did and set the people
shouting
Then the
vote as hed agreed to do and he was
interested now as much as anybody
And the people voted for the other man
as we expected they would But we
hadnt any doubt about the final result
for we thought that Enos would un
shackle now and break away and make
the blow of his life And he did We
who had been hearing him for years
had never heard him approach what he
did now It was wonderful He set the
people wild and we thought we had
em sure
But the other mans very first oom
phah 1 made us tremble and as he vvent
on we knew we were lost money gi
raffe everything Wed never Heard
anything like this before It wasnt just
simple peals of thunder it was a thun
der factory in full blast and working
with a double force of men There could
be only one verdict
That afternoon the whole town
went to the other show and left our big
tent empty The other people cameover
for the animals theyd won beforeshow
time They wanted to take em over
and walk em around in their ring The
old man had em brought out When
the giraffe realized what had happened
he wound his neck around the center
pole and wouldnt budge But the did
man finally persuaded him and over he
went to be made a show of in the other
circus
Enos Stulkinton never blew a bass
horn again Hed had the opportunity
of his life had missed it and he hadnt
the hearfe After that he always blew a
baritone
For my own part I always thought
there was a trick in it Dont you know
there are things that look fair and
square on the face of them that you feel
certain all the same are off in some
way Well I knew there was something
wrong about that mans bass hdrh play
ing and years afterward I heard what
it was He had a bellows attached to
the horn with a hole in the side of the
horn for the nozzle of the bellows and
the bellows inside his clothes out of
sight and a rod running down to a
treadle under his foot He reinforced
his own blowing with blasts from this
bellows and of course the man didnt
live that could stand up against him
We told Etios about this 5 But it was
too hit- Rfrf lost

Fill a bottle or common glass with urine
and let it stand twenty four hours a sedi

dition of the kidneys When urine stains
linen it is evidence of kidney trouble Too
frequent desire to urinate or pain in the

WHAT TO DO
There is comfort in the knowledge so often
expressed that Dr Kilmers Swamp Root
the great kidoey remedy fulfills every wish
in relieving pain in the back kidneys liver
bladder and every part of the urinary pas
sages It corrects inability to hold urine and
scalding pain in passing i or bad effects fol

nicrht to urinate The mild and the
