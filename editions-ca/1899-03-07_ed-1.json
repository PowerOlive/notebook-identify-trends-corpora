DIALECT
Critics pray do not reject
What is writ in dialect
For the common peorles thought
Should in common t peech be wrought
And the crude hut pungent word
Should be written as its heard
Wise or foolish if tis true
That should be Hiiough for youl
With mans speech l onijthin blent
Cuught from Iiih environment
Strong rebellious and the schools
Only scotch it with their rules
Man may fashion a disguise
Baffling to his neighbors eyes
But upon his tongue will be
Stamped his true identity
Therefore critics pray reject
Nothing writ in dialect
Which in story or in rhyme
Is a record of the rime
Vital fresh and fit to be
Found In honest company

WHEN NAPOLEON WALKED
An Incident of the Memorable Re
treat From Moscow
It was on Nov 25 at about oolook
in the morning when we saw the head
of the column The first we saw were
generals a few of whom were on horse
back but the majority on foot The
latter painfully dragged themselves
along almost all having their feet fro
zen and bound up in rags and pieces of
6heepskin and dying of hunger We
then saw what was left of the oavalry
of the guard The emperor came next
on foot with a stick in his hand He
was muffled up in a large capote lined
with fur and wore on his head an
amaranthine velvet cap edged with
black foxskin On his right marched
also on foot King Murat on his left
Prince Eugene viceroy of Italy then
Marshals Berthier prince of Neufchatel
Key Mortier Lefebvre and other mar
shals and generals whose corps had
been partly destroyed
They were followed by 700 to 800
officers and suboCicers marching in or
der and bearing in the greatest silence
the eagles of the regiments to which
they had belonged and that had so often
led them to victory They were the
remnant of over 00000 men My poor
Picart who had not seen the army for
a mouth gazed on silently but his con
vulsive movements showed only too
well what be felt 1 saw big tears roll
down the cheeks and fall on his mus
tache from which icicles were bang
ing Then turning to me Really
compatriot 1 do not know whether I
am asleep or awake 1 weep because I
have seen our emperor marching on
foot a stick in his hand he that was so
great and who made us so proud
Memoires of Sergent Bourgogue
Few Class Distinctions In Siberia
There is not much caste or class dis
tinction in Siberia and the few social
rules are lax The Russian Siberians
mingle freely with the native tribes
and their customs and habits have in
consequence been considerably modi
fied I have often seen groups of boys
playing on the street where the Kirghiz
or Buriat boys were mixed indiscrim
inately with the Russians From their
dress or language it was impossible to
distinguish them for both costume and
language were a strange mixture Only
the peculiar features of the native or
the more slovenly appearance of tbe
Russian would betray the slightest dif
ference It is an old saying that you
scratch a Russian and find a Tartar
It might be more appropriately said
at least of the Russian peasant- that
you scrape the dirt off a Russian and
find a clean Tartar for the latter are
decidedly the more cleanly St Nich

A False Alarm
Oh John dear said Mrs Nerv
ous Im so glad youve come homol 1
want you to go right out and have that
new neighbor of ours arrested He has
been beating his wife and family all
the morning and the way they moan
is too horrible for anything It has
thrown me into hysterics and a nervous
headache and there there Do you
hear that Isnt it awful
But John dear looked out the win
dow and only smiled
Why what do you mean scream
ed his wifa Are you as heartless as
he Will you too look on and hear a
poor woman and her innocent children
beaten to
There there my dear calm your
self Its only the pulley on the new
building thats going up on the next
corner It needs a little oil Detroit

PA AND FREDDIE ABOARD
An Elxcitlns Time For Which There
Wai Really No Occasion
As a passenger train on the Hannibal
was puling out a tall countryman in
cumbered with four bundles a scythe
snath an ax handle a bag of bananas
and a small boy came out of the depot
and began to take his bearings Up and
down the tracks his gaze wandered up
and down the long lines of coaches
drawn up under the sheds and at last
aa iua xeai uuuuu was jjaoaiug uiui us
caught sight of the moving train
Come on Freddie 1 Thar she goes
he yelled and began to transfer some of
his belongings from his right hand to
his left as he ran Freddie made an
amazing record for one whose legs were
so short and they were soon beside tbe
steps on the rear end of the last coach
There was a man standing on the plat
form
Hay stop er stop er cried Fred
dies pa Put on that ar wind brake
mister Pull that ar rope up over your
head and make er stop
But the man only reached down and
caught Freddie who was leaping and
swinging and dragging by turns in his
vain efforts to make his short legs
stretch far enough to get his feet on the
lower step Pa held on to him with one
hand and the man on the platform
finally succeeded in drawing him up
Pa slung the banana bag after him It
slid on across the platform and went
overboard on the other side Pa made a
leap for the steps dropped a bundle and
stooped to pick it up The recovery of
the bundle took but a second but the
train was getting well under way and
was a tails length ahead when he be
gan the chase again One wild spurt
with his coattails standing out behind
him a reckless leap and pa too was
aboard but a bundle containing an un
dershirt had been lost in the tussle
An employee of the depot picked the
bundle up and a section man who hap
pened by appropriated the bananas to
his own refreshment The crowd that
had breathlessly awaited the result of
the race melted away and the depot at
tendants who had been preparing to
pick pa up with shovels went about
their duties
Half an hour later a very anry man
came prancing down the depot platform
He was holding a small boy by one
hand and the ends of an ax handle and
scythe snath protruded from under his
arm
It was pa He approached a depot
official and said
Why didnt you tell me that wasnt
the Wabash I wanted the Wabash
thats what I wanted
The official tenderly handed pa his
new undershirt and replied in the soft
tones that soothe the ruffled soul
I believe you forgot to ask me

INSISTED ON PAYING
A Man Who Wouldnt Accept Lejyl
Advice For Nothing
The other day an old fellow slouched
into Attorney Oscar Kahns office on
Legal row and introduced himself as
Mr Smith Jones Brown or something
of a neighboring county He said he
wanted to consult a lawyer and was ac
corded a seat and one of the attorneys
sweetest smiles
He then explained that while he was
away from home the sheria or some
deputy had attached his wifes sewing
machine and bureau for taxes He did
not propose to tolerate such imposition
he declared
What is the amount of taxes in
quired the lawyer
Lemme see 138 was the reply
The lawyer could not conceal a smile
but hastened to say Well Mr Smith
if you want my advice it is to go back
and settle that small amount It looks
like the easiest and best way ont of it
The old fellow thought a moment
and replied that he believed he would
Answering he asked How much do I
owe you
Ob nothirjr sir M was the reply
I wont charge you anything for a lit
tle adice like that
But I alius pays fer whut I git and
want ter pay yer jes the same
Oh thats all right come in again
some time when you need advice on
something more important and well
square it then
Naw I want ter pay it now Jes

Ef ye want 50 there it is And he
threw down a half dollar and left
