Colonel Horns Letter to General Logan
Explaining an Attack on Grant Shan
non His Associate Was an Ambitious
JTried Chicken Eater
Ttfrs John A Logan once gave to a
newspaper reporter in this city a letter
from a southern editor that created a
lot ot talk It was immediately after
the death of General Grant The re
porter had gone to the Logan residence
to interview the general abont some
matter then before congress The gen
eral was in bed and the reporter was t
shown to his room In the course of the
evening Mrs Logan entered the bed
chamber and took part in the conversa
tion In her hand she held a letter the
contents of which her husband knew
about She wanted to give it to the re
porter hut the ceneral objected But
as the newspaper man started to leave
Mrs Logan slipped the envelope into
his hand The next morning nearly j
every newspaper in the country printed j
a copy oi it it was a rare ana racy
document
Colonel Alexander G Horn of Meridi
an Miss then the editor of The Daily
Mercury was its author The letter
was intended as an explanation of an
editorial that had appeared a few weeks
before in The Mercury Colonel Horn
contained one of the most cruel articles
about General Grant ever printed by a
press It dared any true southerner to
grieve or show signs of sorrow over his
cemise It called upon the people of
Dixie land to exult and rejoice at the
death of the man who had slain their
sons and burned their homes The peo
ple of Meridian were astounded They
went to the editor Colonel Horn and
asked him in the name of peace to
write another article withdrawing it
He was obdurate and instead of doing

er one equally as fierce as the first
At that moment the name of Colonel
Shannon was before the senate awaiting
confirmation as postmaster at Meridian
An enemy of his knowing the love that
General Logan had for General Grant
inclosed copies of the paper to him ex
pecting that Logan would oppose Shan
nons nomination Shannon and Horn
Lad a dispute over the editorial and
their relations became so strained that
a street duel was only averted by the
interference of mutual friends Colonel
Horns letter to General Logan was to
the effect that Colonel Shannon was in
nocent of the article and had known
nothing about it until he saw it in the
Xaper I cannot quote the letter with
literal exactness but a part of it was as
follows
No Shannon had nothing to do
with it In the first place he hasnt
sense enough to conceive such a senti
ment as was expressed in the editorial
and if he had he would be too cowardly
to write it He is my partner I am sor
ry to say but by making him postmaster
you will afford me the opportunity of
getting rid of him
And why not take him John There
is a mighty narrow strip between the
radical republicanism that you repre
sent and the Cleveland Mugwumpery
that Shannon tries to represent He is
not a Democrat never was and never
will be I predict that you will soon
have him over on your side and God
speed the day We Democrats down
here dont want him
I am growing old but I am still in
possession cf my mental faculties and
I hope to live many years longer to tell
the truth from day to day about the
despised Yankees and their politics I
am eeriously afflicted with hemiplegia
else I would have mauled h 1 out of
Shannon long ago
Logan you ought to remember me
as one of the fellows that figured some
what conspicuously in the Kemper
county trials I guess I can take the
credit to myself of having had the Dem
ocrats who killed the Radicals there
acquitted before the courts I would
like another job of the same kind
You and I ought to be friends Op
posites beget liking You have been a
broth of a boy in your party and I have
been a sheol of a fellow in mine
General Logan replied good natured
ly to this epistle after which a friend
ly correspondence sprang up between
the erratic genius at Meridian and the
senator Logan read the Shannon letter
in the committee room of the senate
and then laughingly said that inasmuch
as his friend Colonel Horn wanted
Shannon confirmed he didnt see how
he could oppose him Colonel Horn
unreconstructed has long since passed
into silence and a few years later Colo
nel Shannon was buried at his old
home in Paulding Miss a town onge
made famous by the publication of The
Weekly Clarion many years ago of
which paper he was one of the founders
During the Sullivan Kilrain trial at
Purvis some years ago I sat at the break
fast table with Sullivan and Colonel
Shannon Sullivan ate three fried chick
ens Shannon four Charlie Rich the
great sportsman got the two to enter a
f ried chicken eating match Some one
asked Sullivan how many he thought
he could get away with and Sullivan
said about eight
Eight spoke up Shannon Well
you will have to do better than that
You may be the champion prizefighter
but you will have to whet up that ap
petite of yours before you can take
away the chicken eating champion
ship
The chickens were bought and cleaned
and were ready for the iron when the
j colonel was taken violently ill Before
he could recover Sullivan was out of
