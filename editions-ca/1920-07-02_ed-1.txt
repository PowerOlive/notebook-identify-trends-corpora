Having successfully served this purpose that platform should be discarded and another should be drawn to let thepeople know what the Republicanji&rty stands for this year. By pretending the Chicago platform wasxiade for this latter purpose, instead of openly- admitting its realjpurpose, and attempting to readinto it interpretations, to serve annd not contemplated in the original draft, will only add clumsinessto insincerity and thus endanger thewhole proceeding.i riHEAP OF WASTE TALKThere has been a great amountef waste talk about certain ele- j iiss Ellen Elanding, instructor inments in the Republican part rep- , public school music, is in summerresented by the different aspirants j PChool at Cornell University, Newa.t Chicago, forming an insurgent York, taking special course in pubmovement to express their dissatis-1 jjc school music.

Not many men would careabout going out in the woods andlean up against a tree day after day,but there must be some benefit derived from leaning against a building, the door casing of a businesshouse, or on the show case of a merchant's store. There would benothing very exciting in taking asoap box out into the pasture, tilting it against the fence and watching the cows go by, but a seat infront of a hotel or even the curbingevidently has some value to theloafer for which, he t-hould be madeto pay.

Flynn, "I have never run acros-sa medicine that I consider in a classwith Tanlac. Why, I nave oniytaken three bottles so far, but 1have gained live or six pounds already, this being remarkable fora person of my age."I had been feeling all run-downand no-acccunt for about six years.'My appetite was very poor, mystomach was in a bad fix and I hadno relish for my food. My heartaction was bad on account of thegas on my stomach, my kidneys andbladder were also out of order andI had intense pains in the small ofmy back. I was habitually constipated, my circulation' was poor andthat lired, weak feeling was withme all the time"I thought my troubles were dueto my age, but all I needed to putme in shape was the right medicine. In four days after I startedon Tanlac I felt better and sincethen I have been gaining ground allthe time. The pains about the region of my kidneys have disappeared entirely and I am so muchstronger that I am able to workwith some pleasure. My appetite isgood now and since I have gottenrid of indigestion my heart hasquit acting strangely. I am nolonger troubled with constipation,my circulation is good, and I amfeeling about as well as I ever did.3 am going to take a few more bottles of Tanlac, though I am already feeling fine and am able to iwork ever day. I am glad to givtthis testimonial, for a medicinethat will do as much for old folkoas Tanlac has done for me is certainly worth recommending toeverybody."Tanlac is sold in Paiis at thePeople's Pharmacy.
