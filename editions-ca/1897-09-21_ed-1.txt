an unknownmob Gordon and Andrews by hangingthe others in jail by blows and shotsThe leader of the mob is known tonearly every citizen here but not oneman will mention his name in connection with the lynching He is said tobe either an official or ex official of thecounty He laid the groundwork forthe mobs raid on Tuesday night andit is said that no one will ever serveon a jury to convict himSaid a man who is thought to havebeen in the mobNo one will be found to tell anything and no jury can be found to convict any one In fact I dont thinka jury could be found in the countywithout some one on it

received to the governors instructionssent to Sheriff Busching In sendinga representative to ascertain the truestate of things he held the railroadtrains until the assistant attorney general could make direct connection andget through without delayI think the lax enforcement of thelaw has brought about this disgracefulact at the hands of lynchers in Ripleycounty the governor said I understand that thieving and systematicrdbbery have been carried on thereand that the criminals have not beenpromptly brought to justioeWhile this failure to enforce lawmay have occurred yet it is nocation for mob law No matter whatthe pretext is men who take the enforcement of law into their own handsand lynch men shall be punished inIndianaIt makes no difference what crimethese outlaws have committed theyare entitled to an impartial trial before punishment When men are denied the right to a fair trial at thehands of a competent court we are inthe midst of revolution and anarchyand that condition

and from the houses andprivate residences some of the morepalatial buildings were profuselyadorned with the national colors foreign flags and magnificent floral displays Gendarmes lining either side ofthe street kept the crowd from pressing in the open space through whichpassed the various bodies of civic andfederal marchers on the way totake part in the public exercises at Alameda after which themilitary parade was to marchthrough the same street on its way tothe national palace to be reviewed byPresident Diaz The scene was immensely picturesque the historicavenue called by George Augustus Salaone of the famous streets of the worldbeing all aglow with color and theSpanish fashioned balconies filled withladies in brilliant toilets Aftera short wait the murmur ranthrough the crowd that the presidentwas coming and on foot dressed in theuniform of a general of division Thepresident bowing right and left to theapplauding crowd came immediatelybehind him being Gen Pradillo thegovernor of the national palace whoserved in the same capacity under Jbmperor Maxmillian Following themwere other officers cabinet ministersetcSuddenly near the Alameda therewas a disturbance in the crowd on thesidewalk and a well built muscularman with flowing black hair and moustache forced his way by a tremendouseffort past the gendarmes and soldiersand jumped between the president andGen Pradillo and the chief ofstaff Monasterio and dealt ablow at the back of the presidentsneck but the violence of the blow wasdiminished by the fact that he wascrowded between the president and officers immediately

isIgnacio Anulfo who has of latebeen employed in a notarys office asa clerk and is said by the chiefof police to have a record as a man ofviolent habits given to drink andquarrelsome Various stories are toldregarding his design on the presidentone theory being that he was armedwith a dagger as many police believebut if so he must have thrown it awayas no weapon was found on him Itseems almost certain that he intendedharm for at the moment of dealingthe blow he used approbious termsand seemed most maniacalGen Powell Clayton the UnitedStates minister immediately calledupon the president and offered his congratulations as did other diplomatsand many other prominent peopleThere is no doubt that if Anulfo hadfallen into the hands of the people hewould have been torn to pieces so intense was

STICKNEYCopyright 1896 by J B Lippincott CoCHAPTER VHarvey Neil rode over to Tomtownthe next morning pursuing his waythence to Orodelphia the county seatand the one town of considerable importance in that part of the countrywhere he betook himself to his attorney Donald BartelsBrig ham has gone back on us washis abrupt announcement as he sankwearily into the- chair the lawyer hadhospitably pushed forwardv -0 j saia Bartels looking very graveWhat are your reasons for thinkingsoCol Meredith rode over to see himyesterday I found that out by accident and of course my suspicions werearoused at once To day I rode over toTomtown myself and the first look atthe fellows face told me that I wasrightDid you put the question to himstraightNo where would have been theuse He was prepared to deny it naturally I thought it more to the purpose to raise my own bid and did notraise it high enough I saw that in hisface too although he was cannily noncommittal Either he is intending- toskip out before the trial orWe can have a subpoena issued forhim put in Bartels thoughtfullyBut if he has gone over to the otherside he would be of mighty little usetj us I believe you will have to raiselagpnNeilvWKatjsudid youSffPTiTh - - -A thousand dollars if we win andhis expenses from the time I got himhere I paid him good wages as longas he was working in the Grubstakeyou knowYes but you will have to make thefigure a good deal more than that Iimagine if the colonel is in the marketagainst you We want him if it is apossible thingYes but the question is what ishe worth to usWell with the average jury hewould be worth a good deal He notonly worked the Grubstake long enoughto have the lay of the land and all hisfigures down pat but he had that conversation with McCready which isworth more to us than all the rest Ifwe can bring him to swear that McCready told him he didnt care if theywere on Mascot ground that he owedyou one anyway and hed see thatthe ground was stripped so clean thatthere would be mighty little left foryou by the time the court could stophim that might be mighty good testimony for us In fact Brigham is ourprincipal witness of course and wevegot to hold on to him if it is within therange of possibility Youd better seehim and have a- perfectly clear understanding-at once Find out what thecolonels figure was and go him onebetterAnd next thing the colonel will be outbidding me again and I shall be facingthe same proposition with an addedcipher I suppose Neil gloomily rejoined The poor old Mascot seems tohave been hoodooed from the first tolastOh I dont know I am not particularly concerned about the results in thiscase I can tell you The decision of theUnited States supreme court in theAmy Silversmith case has put a stopto all controversy in respect to anowners right to follow his lode in itsdownward course beyond his side linesThe rulogis clear beyond question thatthe owner of a claim where the apexof his vein crosses the side lines and notits end lines has no extra lateral rightsat all that is he cannot go outside hislines upon any pretext whatever Thefact that the Grubstake was the priorlocation cuts no figure As was held inthe caee of the Iron Silver versus theElgin Mining companj if the originallocator of a claim cannot or does notmake the explorations necessary to ascertain the true trend of his vein anddraws his end lines ignorantly he musttake the consequences The claim ofthe Grubstake that its vein makes aturn at the point where it crosses theMascot assuming- that it would holdwater effectual disposes of any extralateral rights by virtually concedingthat the apex of the vein crosses theside line It only remains for us toprove the continuance of the Mascotvein which with the developments youhave been making should be easy-enough Oh no if we only get theright kind of a jury I have noto the verdictBut what possible chance have weto get the right kind of a jury returned the young man dejectedly retgarding the cigar he was nervously jturning- in his fingers as though thefact that it had gond out was one morehappening- in the train of ill luck thatpursued him It seems to me that tpaverage jury is simply a pack ofassesToo true But asses may sometimesbe led by the nose you knowAnd sometimes they are up for saleto the highest bidderOh as to that you know the sheriffand if you think that Meredith is goingto touch him with any ordinary figuresIn the case of Brigham we seem tohave evidence that the colonel is capable of extraordinary figures upon occasionWell he can afford to pay a prettyliberal percentage to win for a factBartels imperturbably rejoined Butyou carry a check book as well as heTo tell the truth though the jury isnot trbubling me I am a good dealmore disposed to be doubtful about thejudge although as to him well I maybe borrowing- troubleWhy whats the matter with himAnd the match which he had lighted wasallowed to burn Neils fingers in hissurprise I thought Duval was allrightWell so he is probablj returnedthe lawyer with some embarrassmentOnly well I accidentally discoveredthe other day that he had been mixedup with the colonel in some miningdeals down in Mexico I dont knowwhat it amounts to I dont know thathe would dare go too far anywaybuWCant weget achange of venuedemanded Neil looking worn and sickOh I dont think it would do to goas far as that It would prejudice himagainst the case and if he were predisposed against us of course he wouldoppose the motion and Oh no itwould hardly pay us to make such abreak as that all things consideredBut I was- thinking if he could be approached just rightAgain the check book might provemightier than pen or sword exclaimed Neil bitterly as he bent toscratch a new match against his bootsole He relighted his cigar smokingfor a moment in gloomy silence beforehe added And this is justice in ColoradoIt is life not much worse in Colorado than in the rest of these UnitedStates I fancy As Senator Ingallsputs it Purity in politics is an iridescent dream He might have gonefurther and said that purity in anything is a dream little likely to be realized before the millennium But donttake it all too seriously Neil As I saidbefore I doubt if Duval would dare gotoo far in any case He is working forreelection And our main reliance ison the jury anyway and with themyou certainly have an equal chance withthe other sideFor which I should be liftinir mveyes m thankstqheayen and devotingmyself to burnt offerings and sacrifices1 suppose rejoined Neil hotly ByJove Bartels look at it Can youimagine a greater outrage Here I giveup some of the best years of my life totoiling- and moiling in that mine laboring like a convict until at last I make astrike A rich strike but what has itcost me Nobody knows who has nottried it what it takes out of a man tolive and work for years like that nepays the price 01 success out 01 nisvery arteries he is just so much thepoorer in actual life blood he hasburned out that much of his candle oflife and it is gone never to be regainedHe is old and all the wealth of theworld will never give him back hissquandered youth It would seem considering all things that he should beentitled to his paltry wages but farfrom that every highwayman in theland is at liberty to harass and despoilhim provided only the methods arechosen with reference to the accommodating blindness of the law ColMeredith walks into my mine and stealsmy ore I call upon the courts for redress and justice in beautiful impartiality grants Col Meredith as well asmyself an injunction shutting me outof my own ore body until an addlepated jury can decide to whom it reallybelongs If a tramp should come alongand steal my coat 1 could have him sentup for sixty days with hardlj the delay of an hour but thisthief can rob me of thousands and myonly redress seems to be to allow judgeand jury and witnesses to rob me ofthousands more It is enough to makea man swearWell swear then It may do yougood laughed the law3rer but hisglance was sympathetic It is toughfor a fact Neil But youve gone a little too far over to the pessimistic sidenow It might be worseThat is such a consolation ejaculated the young man savagely Theysmoked on in silence for a few momentswhen in a milder tone he went on tosay And by the way of course itmight be worseYou dont mean that there is anotheritem of trouble ejaculated the lawyerwith a laugh of joking dismay WellI dont wonder you are downI should say not And in this instance another fellow is down as wellThe superintendent has inflammatoryrheumatism and from the doctors report to day it looks as though therewould hardly be a chance in a hundredof his getting upon bis legs again intime to be in court when the case iscalled His testimony doesnt amountto much to be sure but to have it happen goes to prove as I said before thatthe case is hoodooed from first tolastWe need all the help we cau getrejoined Bartels gravely We cantake his deposition de bene esse ofcourse but we would have to apply tothe courts for leave and give the otherside time for cross examination youknow It would make delayThen in heavens namevletus dowithout him exclaimed Neil with anrun my chances than drag- along thisway a day longer than necessary Letus know the worst and be done with itOh in this case it will be the bestNever fear old fellow Only we wantto make as good a fight as we can Perhaps we can get along- without yourman though I will think it over anddecide Meantime remember that aman is never undone till he is hangedand a case is not to be counted lost tillit has passed the court of appealsCHAPTER VIWindy Gulch seemed bare and baking in the sultry afternoon sunshine asDorothy Meredith idly looked out uponits one dusty street

disputed with the road for rigtht of wayall through the narrow defile in whichthe camp had located itself Across thestreet was a general store which alsoserved as post office flanked on eitherside by

street whichgave it an air of burrowing into thesteep hillside behind Farther alongas one looked in either direction wereto be seen other stores and saloons thelatter considerably predominating-their lines broken at near intervals bythe door yards of modest residenceswhere the homemaking- instinct struggled against heavy climatic odds in asickly showing of geraniums and morning glories There were a Chineselaundry and a bakery a rickety frameblacksmith shop flaunting a covering ofout-of-date circus posters and an unpretentious drug store developed outof the office of the one physician whogenerally attested the healthfulncss ofthe place by sitting- all day long beforehis door idly occupied with literaturewhich bore no outward resemblance tomedical treatisesThe houses were generally of logs thefew of frame for the most part left unpainted and like their more primitiveneighbors wearing an air of prematureage and decrepitude from the darkbrown stains which the fierce Coloradosunshine had wrought on those sideswhich looked to east and west Fewwere of more than a single story inheight although th stores and saloons0 1Dorothy drew back hastilyas a rule had readied

the sort of faceIve always admired and as soon as Tcaught a back view of her I felt certainshe would have that sort of face Thatswhy I wanted to get a look at itSuch men as you began my neighborNow if I were not a married manI continued reflectively that is thevery girl I would marry at once As itas of course I cant But thats not myfault is itYou are married said the ladyI am I repliedThat makes it much worse shesaidjn the contrary it is my excuseI said It is all owing to my wifeIf it were not for her I should be wellverv differentShe must be a miserable womansaid the lady if she knows of yourconduct My heart bleeds for herNot at all I said She is quitehappy as happy as that girl Now didyou ever see a more charming girlI turned and sent a nod in the direction of the girl who was pedaling alongquietly just behind the bus She lif ted one hand from the handle bar andwaved it to me in friendly responseUnder the circumstances I saidI think I shall speak to her otherwiseI might miss her when I get off at Sloanestreet Do you think she would mindLet me implore you saidmy neighbor if you do I shall speak to the conductorIt would be grossly improper Isaid unless he happens to be yourbrother or your cousin orThe lady sniffed and looked roundBut the conductor was not in viewI leaned down and the girl looked upinquiringly riding to the side of thebusI am going to get off at Sloanestreet I called to her will you stopthereShe nodded andbending slightly overher handles quickly outstripped thebus and rode on past St Georges hospital and down the slope I leanedback in my seat and watched her appreciatively as she floated awayNever in my life I murmuredhave I seen anyone whom I admiremore A most delightful girl IA most disgraceful incident saidmy neighbor- You see -I said

FARMERS ARGUMENTHe Takes a Really Sensible Stand okthe Road QuestionIf we study social and financial questions we find that to a great extentwe fall over the stones we ourselveshave laid in the way There is no endof- fault finding and justly so overthe money sharks the combines thegreediness of public officials and politicians There is no doubt that thesecollectively in many instances get fullyone half of the peoples earnings Ofthe remaining half one half ofthat is lost to the farmer byweeds and vermin by bad financialmanagement and by bad roads Theseare the stones he lays in his own wayo allows to lie there to stumble overThe farmers themselves are principally to blame for the poor and miserable condition of our country roadsThe way of maintaining these roads isabout the same that was customary inour colonial times when any road wasgood enough if rocks stumps or holesdid not make them entirely impassablefor vehicles It is very likely that moreattention would have been paid to ourcountry roads were it not for the introduction of railroads What the railroads are for traffic on a large scale soare our county roads for traffic on asmall scale alike beneficial to all people It is a fact that railroads haulcheaper and is it not a fact that railroads cost more Is it not likewise afact that railroads earn enormousriches out of the people by hauling forthe peopleNow if the farmer could haul hisproduce at half the present cost howmuch would that save him I do notknow some one may answer Well ifI did not see the railroads I would noteither But the fact is if we had goodwugon roads all the year round thewould not cost half what itcosts now besides the quicker trip andbigger load and man team harnessand wagon would last longer Theprice for the load hauled would be better in winter and early spring than inmid summer when team and man arenearly suffocated by dust and whenthey ought to be at home cultivatingcorn and potatoes cleaning up aroundthe hog house and yard and makingnumerous other improvementsThe country road question is generally misconceived therefore insufficiently discussed and will not be solvedsatifactorily by old ways and meansInstead of treating it as a question ofnational economy it is regarded as alocal matter for which there is a greatlack of comprehension or of means tosolve or carry it out In the far westwhere the settlers build their homesfar apart nobody thought of arrangingor maintaining regular roads All roadmaking was confined to poorly passable approaches to the railroads veryoften however thev found what agreat damage an impassable road is Agreat deal has been written about howto make farmers comprehend that it isin their own interest to maintain goodrq1rBi6afioi all itfvainFarmers are averse to the cost ofconstructing durable roads and not farsighted enough to see the benefits theywould derive from it That the cost ofconstructing such a road is considerable may be comprehended by everybody but that it is as high as generallysupposed is a mistake and this seems tobe the main reason that so little hasbeen accomplished in this directionOf course the roads are repaired eveiyyear according to the nature and condition of the soil Gravel will producethe best and cheapest roads but issquandered in many places We oftensee gravel put in places where the roadIs not sufficiently graded There ismixed with the water inholes to a mushand entirely disappears in a few yearsIn many places gravel and stones arenot to be had In such cases the largestholes in the Toad are annually filledwith dirt by plow and scraper andthen left alone till the next year andbo ad infinitum Here wide wagonwheels would be better than narrowones it is not to be wondered that theroads grow from bad to worse in someplacesThe manner in which roads in Wisconsin have been maintained for manyyears is not a correct one nor is thesystem of roadmasters It should havebeen abolished long ago These roadmasters are elected by acclamationwhether the man is competent to earnhis salary or not influence conquersand often the beer glass decides theelection To some it is great fun toelect somebody who does not wantand does not care for the office Insome places it is the rule when haulinggravel in payment of road taxesto loadon as little as possible If the roadmasters would see that every teamhaxiled at least one cubic yard considerably more would be accomplishedEn some districts where capitalists livewho do not work their road taxes themselves the cash is collected br roadmasters who promised to have thetaxes worked but most of it remainsin his pocket or is used to fumigateor irrigate the throat A roadanasterwho really and earnestly sees to it thatevery tax paper does his duty is seldomreelectedIf we want good roads we must electmen to the legislature who are interested in exacting more suitable lawsThings would be much different ifwhen a piece of road is to be made thejob was entrusted to expert and competent hands Every roadmaster shouldbe required to have a knowledge ofbridge construction with tools and theproper handling of the same In nearlyevery state suitable material for theconstruction of good roads may befound and if in consequence of thegreat amount of labor wages shouldrise it would be far from a misfortunethe money would remain in the country and ever- tax payer would have anopportunity to earn his money backagain It would not be Jong before theUkc rodg af tar going through numerous channels of trade would find itsway back to jhe pockets of those fromwhom it had been taken for a good purposeThere should be permanently employed a few men with pick and shoveltqf make necessary repairs drain theroads after heavy rains etc Thiswould save considerable money to everytown and our roads would by rationalwork always be in good condition Nowasmentioned before a great deal couldbe done to improve our roads but suchstatements as we often hear that theroads are in worse condition than theywere 50 years ago is surely overdrawn This is comparatively a newcountry and cannot compare with European countries During the past 45years in our own town we have clearedthe land from heavy timber stones andstumps drained mud holes and swampsbuilt substantial barns and housesraised blooded stock of all kinds andkept the roads in as good condition aswe know how But laws that were allright in colonial times should be abolished that we may keep up with theprogress of the times A Selle inRural WorldMILK CAN TROUGHA Convenience in Hun tiling- tlie DailyDairy

C opSome western farm journals are won-deringwhy flax is not more grownthan it is The reason is that it is a veryexhaustive crop and can only be grownprofitafbly where fertility is little regarded or where there is good marketfor both fiber and seed It is- a goodsign for western fi arm ecs that iiax- -- i --T l j e igxuwiiijjiKj jlii was pituiiusu u JUW jcaiago is going out of their farm rotation The stalk and fibre were alwaysthrown away Only the seed was marketed and this sold so low that theraw seed or better still flaxseed mealwas one of the cheapest fertilizers thatcan be used Not until we have millsfor making linen cloth and conveniences for separating the fiber fromthe stalk will flax growing be profitablein 1 this country When both seed andfiber can be sold the crop will pay forthe heavy manuring it requires to keepthe land fertile American CultivatorTraining1 Up the HeiferTrain up a heifer in the way sheshould go and when she becomes a cowshe will not depart from it With

such that it was impossible todress him for three yearsCHARLIE MABRYHis head and body were a massof sores and his nose was swollen toseveral times its natural size to add tohis misery he had catarrh which madehim almost deaf and his eyesight alsobecame affected No treatment wasspared that we thought would relievehim but he grew worse until his condition was indeed pitiable A dozen bloodremedies were given him by the wholesale but they did not the slightest goodI had almost despaired of his ever beingcured when by the advice of a friend wegave him SSS Swifts Specific andat first the inflammation seemed to increase but as this is- the way the remedygets rid of the poison by forcing it outof the system we were encouraged andcontinued the medicine A decided improvement was the
