CARJ) OF THANKS.
We desire to thank all our friends
who were so good to us in. the last
illness of our mother, Mrs. Mary
Dykes. It being impossible for us
to see everyone and thank them in
person, we take this method of ex
tending our thanks to each and ev
eryone. True friendship comes to the sur
face in times of trouble and trials,
and we feel that we have been bless
ed in this way. May every blessing
come to those who were our com
forters and friends in this sad hour
of bereavement.
THE FAMILY.
The funeral of Mrs. Nellie
Woods Cain, aged about sixty-four,
who died at her home on Higgins
avenue, Tuesday morning, after a
shrt illness of meningitis and heart
trouble, was held atthe Church of
the Annunciation, in this city, yes
terday (morning, at ten o'clock, with
services conducted by Rev. Father
Eugene De Bruyn. The burial fol
lowed on the family lot in the Paris
Cemetery.
The pall-bearers were Thomas P-.
Woods,, Edward Woods, John Mal
laney, Charles Peddicord, James
Burke, John Connell and Stamps
Moore.
Mrs. Cain's death was a peculiarly
pad one, coming as it did, after a
series of troubles such as seldom fall
to the lot of one family. That her
death was directly due to worry over
tbTe unfortunate death of her son,
James Cain, who was killed in battle
in France, in July of last year, has
been the unanimous verdict of her
friends. For almost four months she
anxiously awaited news from her son,
who was a member of the American
Expeditionary Forces engaged on the
battle front in France.
Writing to her regularly from
France young Cain's letters suddenly
ceased, and for a period of over 'four
months nothing whatever was heard
from him. Hope at first that she
would-soon receive a letterfrom him
gave way to despair, and avTew weeks
ago a telegram was received from the
War Department at Washington con
veying the sad news of his having
made the supreme sacrifice on the
battlefield on July 26. Owing to the
critical ' condition of Mrs. Cain's
health the news was withheld
from her for a while, but her per
sistent inquiries compelled revealing
the truth when it could no longer be
held back. Her already weakened
heart could not stand the shock, and
she passed away, murmuring the
name of her son.
Mrs. Cain was a daughter of the
late Mr. and Mrs. Ned Woods, pio
neer residents of Paris, who preceded
Iher to the garve many years ago.
Besides her husband, Mr. John P.
Cain, she is survived by the follow
ing children: Miss Helen Cain,
Thos. Cain, John Cain, Jr., and Jlobt.
Cain, all residents of Paris; two sis
ters, Mrs. George Rassenfoss, of Mt.
Sterling, and Mrs. Maggie Jacobs, of
Paris, and two brothers, Thomas P.
Woods and Mike L. Woods, of Paris.
