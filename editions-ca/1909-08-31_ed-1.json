Delivery of Tobacco TobaccoAnother TobaccoAnother TobaccoAnother
Another question that has come up upin upIn
in the recent trials of the different differentcases differentcases I
cases is this Where is the point poIntof pointof
of delivery of this tobacco And what whattime whattime
time is fixed Neither of these ques questions ¬
tions were answered in the former formerpledges
pledges To strengthen that point it is isprovIded isprovided
provided in this pledge that the owner ownerbecomes
becomes a member of the organiza organizaLion ¬
tion and his tobacco is subject to its Itsrules
rules and regulations And further furthermore ¬
more that the signer must deliver his histobhcco
tobacco at some point in his county countythat countythat
that may maybe be named by the Board ofControl of ofControl
Control of his county There are two tworea tworeasons
reasons rea sons why that should be in the thepledge
pledge One is that when a man re raI rafuses refuses ¬ I
fuses to deliver his tobacco or at ate atetempts attempts ¬
tempts to sell it outside of the so S society ¬
ciety it is is isnecessary necessary when you under undertake undertake1 ¬
take takei taketo take1to i to bring suit against him that thatyou thatyou
you should be able to designate the theplace theplace
place and time when the tobacco is isto isto
to be delivered to the society An Another Another ¬
other Is that upon the final sale of ofthis ofthis
this tobacco toba co it is of the utmost im importance Importance ¬
portance that you have a central au auhority auhority
hority to direct dire t the sale of it If you youhave I
have a central authority you shouldhave should shouldhave
have at the same time authority to tosay tosay
say where tht tobacco is to be de deliered dellvered ¬
livered That Tha authority should neces necessarily necessarily ¬
sarily be vested in the Burley TobaccoSociety Tobacco TobaccoI TobaccoSociety I
Society or Board of Control ControlPooling
Pooling All of Tobacco TobaccoAnother TobaccoAnother
Another provision that hasbeen has been been discussed dis discussed ¬
cussed a great deal is the question of ofrequiring ofrequlrin
requiring the signer of this pledge to topool topool
pool all of his tobacco That created createdI createda I
a great gr eat deal of trouble in the 1906 and an
1907 pool Some of the signers would wouldpool wouldpool aIP1
pool a part of their tobacco and sell sellthe sellthe
the balance outside of the pool Thaf Thafl Thaflwould Thafwould
would create more feeling than if he hehad hehad
had never pooled at all He was re regarded regarded heI ¬ I
garded as a traitor he might have havehad havehad
had some good reason for doing this thisbut thisbut
but you never could get his reason or orreasons i ireasons
reasons before all of the people so soI sothat Sothat I
that they might know that this man manwas manwas
was justified In what he did It has hasbeen hasbeen
been argued that this clause might mightprevent i iprevent
prevent the pooling of some tobacco tobaccoAlro fobaccoAlso
Also that a man could not divide his hiscrop hiscrop
crop If his tenant objected to having havingit
it divided before selling For instance instanceif
if a man had three crops grown by bytenants bytenants
tenants A B Band and C He might be will willing willing
Ing to pledge all three of them but if ifA ifA
A was willing and B or C objected or orB orB
B or C was willing and the other ob objected objected ¬
jected this would prevent his sign signing signlug
Ing for any of the three crops cropsI
I believe some one In the meeting meetinghas meetinghas
has suggested that this matter has hasbeen hasbeen
been referred to some of the local attorneys at attorneys ¬
torneys and it was their opinion that thata
a landlord could not compel a division divisionof
of his crop but it would have to be besold besold
sold as a whole because a divisionmight division divisionmight
might injure the tenant financially It Itwould Itwould
would not injure the landlord as his hishalt hishaif
half would go into the pool but it itmight itmight
might injure the tenant because jie jiewas he e ewas
was standing on the outside I believe believeit
it was agreed upon by all the attor attorI attorneys attorneys ¬
I neys here ill conference yesterday that thatsuch thatsuch
such was not the law Even taking takingit
It from the common sense standpoint standpointthe
the customary trade a man makes makeswith makeswith
with his tenant Is that he agrees to togive togive
give the tenant half the crop for rais raising raisIng ¬
ing it onehalf for the other otherIt otherIt otherIt
It Is true that some landlord might mIghtmake mightmake
make a trade and bind himself by anexpress an anexpress
express contract that he would not notsell notsell
sell without the consent ot the tenant tenantor
or that the crop should be sold as a awhole awhole
whole Of course if he makes that thatagreement thatagreement
agreement agreement he would wo ld be bound but buttake buttake
take the ordinary trade that is made madeit madeit
It is that the tenant is to get onehalf onehalfof
of the for producing roducing it and pr pre ¬
paring It for market Now
does not mean onehalf of the proceeds proceedsin
in case of a sale It Is the usual procedure pro procedure ¬
cedure for the landlord to sell the thewhole thewhole
whole together but that is not the con contract contract ¬
tract His tenant is to get onehalf onehalfof
of that that crop and that being the contract con contract ¬
tract the law would of necessity allow allowthe allowthe
the landlord a division in the selling sellingThey sellingThey
They are not partners in selling that thattobacco thattobacco
tobacco on account of the contractbut contract ontractbut
but it is by agreement that they do dosell dosell
sell together It was the opinion that thatthe I Ithe
the society would benefit and that thatthose thatthose
those who did sign would be counted countedas
as loyal to each other if their tobacco tobaccowould tobaccowould
would go in as a whole wholeNo wholeNo
No Way of Fixing Damage DamageAnother DamageAnother
Another occasion of trouble in the thepast thepast
past was that when a man would sell sellhis sellhis
his tobacco out of the society in viola violationot violation ¬
tion tionot of his contract there was no way wayof wayof
of arriving at the damages How was wasthe wasthe
the society damaged It was a so society society ¬
ciety without capital It was repre representing represeating ¬
senting other people and it was a ques question question ¬
tion what the damage would be and it itwas itwas
was even a question whether there therewas therewas
was any damage at all If you had no nofinancial nofinancial
financial Interest and were not holding holdingit
it fQr the purpose of making money moneyhow moneyhow
how could you be damaged or to towhat towhat
what extent That feature of the con contract contract ¬
tract was never properly guarded guardedThere guardedThere
There is a provision here that the thedamage thedamage
damage is fixed at 20 per cent of the thevalue thevalue
value of the crop pledged in case ofa of ofa ofobreach
a obreach breach of contract by the signer signerThat signerThat
That is a fixed penalty The law usual usually usually ¬
ly abhors a penalty But where the thedamages thedamages
damages are of f such a nature thatthe that taatthe
the courts cannot determine what the thetamage theamage
damage amage is and make it definite and andc andcertain

fix a penalty and that will be upheld upheldby upheldby
by the courts for the reason that with without without ¬
out that fixed amount it would be im impossible impossible ¬
possible for the court to determine the thedamage thedamage

Another change in this contract was wasthat wasthat
that this pledge should be deposited depositedin
in a bank in the county so that the thepeople thepeople
people signing in that county would wouldknow wouldknow
know it was there ere and that it would wouldnot wouldnot
not be used unless the pool were de declared dcdared ¬
