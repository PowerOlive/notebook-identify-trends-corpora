Hardwork by the Paris fire department,supplemented by the aid of willing.and zealous volunteers kept the blazeconfined to the locality where itstarted and thereby saved a largoamount of valuable business propertyfrom destruction.About -1:30 o'clock Wednesdaymorning Miss Julia McCarthy,night chief operator at the Cumberland Telephone office, saw smokeI coming from the building occupiedby the Gatewood confectionery, onMain .street, near the corner ofFourth and Main streets. She sentin a silent alarm to the fire department.. When the firemen arrivedflames were issuing from the roof ofthe building. The department wasbadly handicapped in fighting thefire by the low water pressure, butthis was soon remedied, and theirheroic efforts beyond a doubt savedthe entire block from destruction.The flames were said to have originated from defective wiring in theattic of the confectionery. Theblaze soon spread to the Kid Stoutrestaurant adjoining, and to thebuilding occupied by the Fair Store,and the annex used by the FairStore as a wall paper and paint department. The firemen found theirwork hampered also by the heavytin roofs covering the buildings.The upper floors of the buildingswere gutted, and water added tothe damage done to stocks andequipment by the blaze. The flatover the Fair Store was occupied byMr. J. A. Stern and family. Hisaged mother, Mrs. B. Stem, who isover ninety years old, and an invalid was carried from .the burningbuilding in the arms of PatrolmanGeorge M. Hill. After several hourshard work, the firemen succeeded incontroling the blaze, and kept itfrom spreading. The Rus Corbinbarber shop, and flat above occupiedby Mrs. J. V. Lytle and son, Foster,was protected by a heavy fire wall,which kept the flames from spreading in that diiection.Mr. Gatewood, proprietor of theconfectionery, had lately purchased'the "place from Frank Burton, who gTeturned to the railroad ousmeBsrand his insurance had just beentransferred. He had just sold ahalf-interest in the business to aLexington man. Both were out ofthe city at the time of the fire,Gatewood being in Frankfort andhis new partner in Lexington.Very little of the stock from anyof the stores' was carried out, all being heavy losses from the combinedeffects of water and fire. Arrangements are being made to rebuild thedamaged buildings, and all hope toresume business in a few weeks.The loss to the occupants will bedoubly severe, owing to the factthat there are no vacant store roomsinto which they can move theirstocks at present.Estimates made on the losses andthe insurance on the damaged stocksand buildings yesterday was as follows: J. A. Stern, loss on building,$6,500, insurance, $4,000; loss onstock of goods, $5,000, insurance,$3,000; Frank Sifters, owners of theStout Restaurant building, Joss, onbuilding, $7,500, insurance, $6,000,Mrs. Cannie Stout, loss on restaurant property, $5,000, insurance, $2,-200; Q.

JThomas, Woodford & BryanO :SENATE PASSES HOUSE BILLTAXING GASOLINEA tax of one cent a gallon ongasoline used in motor vehicles isimposed by a bill originating in theHouse, which was passed by the Senate. A-clause placed in the bill by theHouse exempting gasoline used infarm tractors was stricken out bythe Senate because it was thoughtthat this would make the bill unconstitutional. It is estimated that this bill willyield ?500,000 a year, to be placedin the road fund.The bill was attacked by Senatorsfrom the central section of theState on the ground that such a taxwas unjust in view of the fact thatno production tax is placed on coal,and for that reason Eastern Kentucky escapes the payment of itsjust share of taxes.BOURBON C01TIITY BOARD OFSUPERVISORS CONVENE.The' Bourbon County Board of TaxSupervisors composed, of SamuelHouston, Ben Woodford, Alex -Mil-jler,B.

In five years building cost has increased 60 per cent; furniture 127per cent; clothing cost 129 perper cent. Consequently there hasbeen a great increase in the valuescovered by the usual policy covering"Dwelling and Contents," or "Mercantile Building and Contents." Thesame is true of nearly every otherkind of insurable property.Late increase in values has morethan covered depreciation. Whatwas sufficient insurance five yearsyears ago may not be half enoughnow. To you the real value of yourproperty is what it would cost youto replace it.If you were burn,ed out to-daywould your loss check from the insurance company pay its rightfulshare of the present cost of replacing your property?If you haven't enough insurance,let us talk with you about whatamount you should properly carry.YERKES & PEED,Agents For Five Strong Companies.(It)oBASKET BALLTtieaParis"and Versailles T.

Do you know that the de-,raand for export ajnd the increased 'consumption of "Bright Leaf" forcedunusually high prices and really 'iORCED the market above what itwould have been under normal export and ordinary increase? YouKnow that every abnormal market .must react. Well that's history andpart of it caused by the late war, but it all has to do with, eur question, "WHAT'S YOUR FARM WORTH?" If tobacco prices hold up,farm lands in Kentucky -will continue to hold up. If the bright leafmarket is lost by the destruction of cigarettes, farm lands will godown with falling pricee. One farmer was bemoaning the increase inhis land tax. He seemed to forget that land he bought for $125.00 anacre now commands $450.00. We can't keep it all. Even Uncle Sa;nwants his share. So if our Zand is valued at two or three tines whatwe paid for it, we must pay higher taxes. That is settled. Now whatwill your farm land be worth if you cannot raise tobacco? Somefolks are mighty 'busy already against tobacco, and we suggest that if.you do not know what Is going on, that you write the ALLIED TOBACCO LEAGUE OF AMERICA; Pickering Building, Cincinnati, O. Ifyour farm is worth it better keep posted anyway. Are you interestedenough to write for information on "How To Keep Farm Land Producing Profits?"

'The House of Representativespassed the bill introduced by Representative B. A. Roth, of Louisvilleto regulate-. traffic on public highways, fix automobile licenses andprovide for their being issued byCounty Clerks, by the vote of 54 to14. The bill was backed by theLouisville Automobile Club and similar clubs throughout the State..The House went into a committeeof the whole to hear former Attorney General Charles Morris explainthe provisions of the measure. Thethree outstanding feaures of themeasure, he said, look to expediency in obtaining metal tags forcars by having County Clerks issuelicense; provide better traffic regulations and prevent traffic in stolenautomobiles. Another good featureof the bill, he said, solves the question of refund on license where carschange hands.The bill allowed the CountyClerks a fee of 40 cents for issuinglicense, the fee to be paid by the automobile owner. This feature of thebill Representative Ciario thoughtobjectionable on the grounds thatautomobile owners are already paying more than their, just amount oftaxes. He offered an amendmentwhich provided that the 40-cent feeis to be deducted from the licensecollected, and the amendment wasadopted by the House.Motorcycle license fees are fixedat $10 and automobile fees sixtycents for each horse power. Theregistration fees on trucks are $22for 1,000 pounds or less! $33 formore than 1,000 pounds and lessthan 2,000 pounds; $40 for morethan 2,000 pounds and less than 3,000 pounds; $50 for more than 3,000 pounds and less than 4,000pounds and less than 5,000 pounds;$70 for more than 5,000 pounds andless than 6,000 pounds; $90 for morethan 6,000 pounds and less than 7,000 pounds; $100 for more than 7,000 pounds and less than 8,000pounds and less than 9,000 pounds;$150 for more than 9,000 poundsand less than 10,000 pounds; morethan 10,000 pounds; $150 for eachadditional ton.The amendment of RepresentativeJames H.

Plowing for spring crops hasbeen retarded by the cold and rains,and it will push many farmers iocatch up with their work unlessthere is a return to more favorableconditions.The sales of the 1919 tobacco cropis as good as ended, as to-day willmark the last sale to be held at thelocal houses. The acreage of the1920 crop will beN very large. Already timber is being hauled andpreparations being made for burningbeds for the sowing of seed. Manyare experiencing difficulty in securing land for tobacco this season, aswell as the procuring of sufficientlabor for handling the crop throughthe vr'ious processes from plantingto selling.The wheat crop has weatheredthe winter in fine shape, and the recent snows have been very beneficial to the young sprouts. Theacreage is said to be rather small,due to the adverse conditions atseeding time.Strong sales on live stock are therule, with mules the outstandingfeature of the sales reports.

Well, that's what Tanlac hasdone for me, besides I n now fifteen pounds heavier than I was theday I began taking it, a few weeksago."The above statement was madeby T. H.

I was in such badfchape that it looked like I wouldhave to quit entirely."Nothing agreed with me andwhat little I did eat felt like lead inmy stomach. My food would invariably sour, causing gas, bloating andworst kind of pains. I was constipated all the time, continually lostweight, and for three years I wasmiserable."But since taking Tanlac I amfeeling fine and always draw fullpay, fpr I am on the job every daynow. I decided to try Tanlac because a lady living at Valley Stationtold 'me that Tanlac relieved her indigestion completely. I got a bottleand soon after starting on it I commenced to feel better. I have takenfive bottles now and can eat cabbage, turnips or just anything elseT want and never feel a touch of indigestion. Why, my stomach simplyfeels like a new one, and I n justlike a different man. Whenever anyof my family complains of feelingbad I give them Tanlac. It is myfamily medicine and has saved memany a dollar and would have savedme lots more if I had known aboutit three years ago. Yes, sir, I certainly can recommend Tanlac, for Ibelieve it's the best medicine eversold in a drug store for any sort ofstcbiach trouble.""Tanlac is sold in Paris at People'sPharmacy.

As long as the war lasted theseincidental lessons were lost sight ofunder the pressure of meeting, theemergency created by the shortage offuels, but with the return of peacethe experience gained during the waris being gathered together in a seriesof reports on the industry, the firstof which, "Coal in 1917,'r by C. B.Lesher, has been published by theUnited States geological survey, department of the interior.The period from 1914 through 1917and 1918 and into 1919 may be regarded as a distinct epoch in the coal industry, of which the year 1917 represented only one section, but a sectionwhich, if not the most remarkable forits achievements, was at once the mostchaotic and the most momentous in thehistory of the industry.In response to the unprecedented demand-the bituminous mines produced551,790,563 tons, or nearly 10 per centmore than the output of the year before. The anthracite output was 99,611,811 net tons, an increase over 1916of 13.7 per cent The total output ofboth hard and soft coal was thus over650,000,000 tons.This record output was accomplished by a labor force of 603,143 men inthe bituminous and 154,174 in the anthracite mines. In spite of the draff:the number of workers in the bituminous industry was greater in 1917 thatin 1916.THE TRAIN SHEET.xae : .laminar railroad time table, iwun its ngures and dotted lines, is iomy a. smaii edition of the real tableby which trains are run. The officialtime table is a very large and complicated affair and - could not possibly be carried about in one's pocket.It would require a sheet nine feetlong and three feet wide, ruled inthree eight-inch spaces, to recordthe trains which pass out of a largeterminal station, in a single day. Toovercome the necessity of so cumbersome a piece of literature, an hourlytitaae table is used. The train dispatcher's time table, for example,contains the number of trains, nameof conductor and engineman in full,the number and kind of cars in thetrain, the time it left the station,the time it left the train yard andthe time is passes various signalstations for many miles.o. f,-: Kf ? & O'KENTUCKY NEAR TOP INCROSS STAMP SALERED.

It is called Afognakand is about 65 miles long by 40 inwidth, with a very irregular shore lineand deeply indented by bays.It is the property of the government,and in 1892 was set aside by PresidentHarrison as a game and fish reserve.The important purpose that it servesis that of a preserve for salmon, allthe finest varieties of which run up itsstream in great numbers at the breeding season to spawn.Afognak is a mountainous island,of volcanic origin, its loftiest peakrising to an elevation of 1,300 feet.In the interior are a number of largelakes, which are the breedinggrounds of the salmon. One ofthese, Letnik lake, is seven miles long,and on its shore is located a big government fish hatchery.In the days of long ago, before theUnited .States bought Alaska, the 'salmon fishery of Afognak was operatedby the Russian-American company,which established on the island a colony of its superannuated and pensionedemployes. These were Aleuts, whosedescendants today compose the nativepopulation, somewhat more than 400,though their blood is much mixed.Herbert Hoover will not permithis name to be used in the California presidential primary, as he is nota candidate for the office, accordingto a telegraJm from him. read byGalvin McNab, and the DemocraticState committee meeting at SanFrancisco."While highly sensible of thegreat honor implied in the desire ofmany friends to place my nane innomination as a candidate in Democratic primaries," the telegram read,"I deem it due to thelm to advisethem that I am not a candidate.

Rice. "The blue jay sounds histrumpet call, the crows hold noisyconsultation over their plans for theiay and a ruffled grouse whips thetwigs-of the pine with her wing asshe leaves her roost. The chipttiunks scurry about from stump to'Stump, now rushing precipitably tocover, now coming forth again totake a critical view of the intruder.Their larger cousins, the red squir- Jrels, come out from theand, perching on a dead branch, rat-tie out a challenge to all comers.At last comes the sound for whichyou have been waiting and whichsnakes the-heart beat faster.

Of all the soundsin nature, there are few which thrillfie like thcr bark of the gray squirrel." oAn, oauce of action , is worth aSeveral scientific investigatorsaeree that the Indian as we knowMm is a comparatively late ccmer.Whether he arrived by way ofAlaska frchi Asia may never be discovered, but the relics of his civiliation are believed to date back notmore than a few thousand years atmost. There is much evidence onthe other band to indicate that menlived in North America at the closeof the Ice Age and perhaps duringthe glacial period. The evidence isfound for the most part in the Ohioand Delaware valleys. The rude inrstruhient these men used in theirhunting and homes have been foundburied deep in gravel which is believed to date back to the close of theIce Age. If this be the case men lived in America -10,000 or 15,000years ago. Some geologists believethat the gravel deposits are considerably older. How these men found1 heir "way to America in re .note antiquity, how much of the land theyoccupied and where they disappearedare perhaps ihe most fascinatingproblems in American archaeology.The patient investigations of manytrained scientists are carrying -usevery day nearer the answer.ohemlocks KENTUCKIANS IN NEW YORKAlamo Afternoon and NightTODAY, FRIDAYALICE BRAW"The Fear Market"inAlsoPEARL WHITE in 'The Black Secret'and Mutt and Jeff (Comedy"West Is East"Tomorrow, SaturdayMAY ALLISON"The Walkotfs"in,s The iirst thing he learned to write wasI.
