GENIUS OF THE ROADSIDE
Sow a States maus Rustic Protege Was
Helped on Way to Fame
The off horse has lost a shoe from
the right fore foot said the coachman
s he drew up opposite a wayside black
smith shop SLall I stop and haTe it
replaced
By all means replied the owner
of the curricle Senator Aaron Burr of
Jgw York it is always the proper
thing to keep your horses well shod
ud besklts I am only too glad of a
chance to stretch my legs after so long
drive While the smith is busy I will
stroll to the top of oua of these beaufci
u Ulster connty hills
When he returned half an hour later
lie happened to glance at the side of a
toava near the shop and saw with stir-
prise an accurate though hurriedly
-drawn charcoal picture of his curricle
and horses
Who drew that he inquired
That lirle trouzy head yonder
Tt plied the blacksmith pointing to a
looy in homespnu who was chopping
ivood in the dooryard opposite as if his
whole mind was occupied with his task
Halloo my lad called Burr and
when the little fellow looked up with
the air of one who has been caught in
some misdemeanor he added pleasantly
If ever you want to change your occu
pation and see life just put a clean
sliirfc in your bundle and go to this ad
dress in New York and he crossed
- the road to hand the boy a slip of paper
The team was soon on its homeward
way and in a short time the incident
jpassed from the crowded mind of Aaron
33urr Months afterward as he sat at
3br8akfast a servant brought him a pack
age containing a homemade clean shirt
find said thai a boy at the door had
-asked her to deliver it as an all suffi
cient introduction But the senator
-could not understand its significance so
he sent for the boy whom he at once
recognized as the youthful genius of the
roadside j
With all his frults Burr was a
serous man at heart and he spared
neither pains nor expense to give the
jyouth the best of instruction in his j
-chosen profession From an artistic
point of view the student became very
as the great painter
iyu although he lived a life of poverty
He painted the portraits of Aaron
IBnrr and his daughter Theodosia from
I 1 t I
ynicn were tanen tne nne engravings
lay which we know them He died near
the spot where he drew the picture of
the waiting team His career is a noble
monument to the better side of the na
ture of his benefactor a nature not
wholly devoid of sweetness and light
although darkened by frequent clouds
through his mature life and finally
eclipsed in the murky gloom of a purely
jselfish ambition Atlanta Constitution
GOLFING PHILOLOGY
Derivation of Carious Tormg Which Be
long to the Game
To the enthusiastic golfer the game is
aever out of season Fitted with arc
tio goloshes and a warm knitted
waistcoat he is seen upon the links on
nany a day which appears inclement to
the uninitiated Perhaps this disregard
of snow ani ice is natural when one
comes to look up the derivation of golf
ing terms Many of the words come
Ieucly from the Icelandic languages
Swedish lynka meaning a twist
or crook hence itsannlication to tho
- windings of the coast the sandy barren
ground called links in Scotland
To put pronounced putt comes
from the Gaelic put signifying to
push or throw as when the useful put
ter propels the golf ball from the
putting green into the hole
The lofter is derived from the Ice
landic loft that is shy or air a
Danish form being loft for ceiling or
loft Philadelphia Inquirer
One Tcteran Witlioat a Pension
I sat on a hill with a sergeant who
knew history and horses He
borod Pansy which had served 16 years
in the troop and a first rate old horse
then but a d d inspector with no
soul came browsing around one day and
condemned that old horse Government
Egot a measly 10 or something like
that This ran along for a time when
one day they were trooping up some
lonely valley and behold there stood
-Pansy as thin as a snake tied by a
wickieup He greeted the troop with
joyful neighs The soldiers asked the
captain to be allowed to shoot him but
of course he said no I could not learn
if he winked when he said it
wound over the hill a carbine
lang from its rear and Pansy lay down
in the dust without a kick Death is
- better than Indian for a horse The
thing was not noticed at the time
4bufc made a world of fuss afterward
rhongh how it all came out the sergeant
did not develop nor was it necessary

Delicate Instruments

Ing through the earth from the adjacent
