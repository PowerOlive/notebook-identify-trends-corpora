The April number of bverystu-

has been issued from TIIE BOURBON
NEWS job rooms.
The April number, like its pre.leces
sors. is an excellent and most inter
esting one, being full of good things,
in a literary way, from the first
page to the last.
The contents embrace, besides the
athletic and editorial contributions,
contributions as follows: "A Story
With a Moral," by Lutie Crowe; "In
Memoriam," by Edna Snapp; "A
Letter From Willowmore Vale," by
Lilly Kennedy; "The Biography of My
Greatgrandmother," by Dorothy Har
ris; "Why Go To College," by Jen
nings JTaylor; "Toasts For the Teams,"
by C .C. Dawes and Raymond Con-
nell; "Revised," by Jennings Taylor,
"Transcendentalism," by J. Taylor,
"The Sun Fairies' Strike," by Lutie
Crowe, and two unsigned contribu
tions comprise articles dealing with
the basket ball teams' successful sea-
son. Among the news features are a
review of the Girls' Glee Club pro-1
gram; the honor roll, and expressions
of esteem and sympathy to Mrs. Ern
est Harris in the death of her lovely
daughter, Dorothy, a P. H. S. student
loved by all; also sympathy resolu
tions to Charles Chappell, on the
death of his father. A remarkably
brilliant and clever contribution by
Miss Dorothy Harris is one of the fea
tures of the publication.
THE CENSORSHIP.
It is not probable that the Govern
ment and the press will have any dif
ferences as to the manner in which
war news should be handled. Such
requests as that the press refrain
from publishing the date of- the de
parture of steamers, or their destina
tion, are too reasonable to be refused
Tho nr-nUnUllil,. : 1. i

it will be necessary to get rid of th?
spies before any real sececy as to de-
partures and destinations can be main-
tained. but the press will do all it can
io neip uie cause. Jt will in all mat
ters be responsive to the reasonable
requests, demands or orders of the
Government, assured that the Govern

rights as has been done in Europe.

A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE.
s enne nnstjihlfk pnpmiPR of Hip Amfiripjtii
Bar-;rnment orders have been issued
c managers of all exchanges of the
rumberland Telenhone Co to have all
?l!!?l?
the State. It has been pointed out
that it would be a comparatively easy
matter for someone with an cxper1
knowledge of the workings of a tele
phone system to get possession of val-
uab,0 information by means of the
local telephone booth. It was rumor
ed Sunday that guards would also be
placed in the exchanges to protect the
night operators and to watch for inter
ference with the service.
The general public will understand
from this why the Main street doors
of the Paris exchange, in the Odd Fel
lows building, are closed and locked
from five p. m. to eight a. m. the fol
lowing morning, and govern them
selves accordingly.
