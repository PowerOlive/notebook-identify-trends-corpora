arisen whichmay furnish a dramatic interruptionto the counting of the electoral votesnext Wednesday RepresentativeGeorge Washington Murray the onlycolored member of the house who represents the Charleston district will bethe chief actor in the dramatic episodeHe has just returned from SouthCarolina where he was in consultationwith the leading republicans of thePalmetto state He is armed with amonster petition signed by thousandsof republicans of the state protestingagainst the counting of the electoralvote and asking for an investigation ofthe election laws and the state constitutionThe claim is made that the electionlaws and the state constitution uponwhich they are based are not in accordwith the federal constitutionWhile the dispute over the vote ofSouth Carolina can not in any way affect the final result it may give rise tocomplication of a serious nature Thebest authorities agree that the petitioncan not be ignored and the investigation of the precedents shows thatwhen such a protest is entered thecount must immediately stop until thequestion is settledWhatever the immediate result ofthis attempt to discredit South Carolinas vote may be there is no doubtthat the programme which is to bethus inaugurated is a part of a gigantic scheme on the part of southern republicans to overthrow the iegistration and election laws in varioussouthern states where the Negro

Theonly persons who appear satisfiedare a few Spaniards of the old reformist party the officials and a half dozenautonomists who follow the marquisof Montoro The thoughtful elementof all classes is very much disappointed The Cubans see in the schememerely a rehash of the futile Abarzuzalaw of 1895 without any real concessions to the colonyThose who are interested in tariffreforms say that the plan of SenorCanovas can have no practical benefitfor Cuba inasmuch as it leaves untouched the nnjust commercial privileges of Catalonia and other northernprovinces of SpainThey do not see furthermore

citizens explain it by saying that the noisemakes the hens nervous The officershave worked it out to their satisfactionthat the fecundity of eggs within thedepression and the lack of it in

OF GONDiFORUSGondoforus King of the Indies was one ofthe richest monarchs of his time He had bydegrees amassed an immense fortune and-possessed so much gold and silver so manyprecious stones and superb tapestries thatthe whole world envied him his treasuresHaving accumulated all this he decidedfinally to have a magnificent palace constructed and sought an architect capable ofexecuting the colossal work which homeditatedAll at once St Thomas arrived at his courtto offer his services because the Lord had appeared to him at Caesarea and commandedhim to repair to the abode of Gondoforus inorder to undertake this work Delighted athaving the services of such a well knownarchitect the king entrusted to him all hiBtreasures and showed him the place upon-which to erect his new castle Then aftergiving him carte blanche he left him sayinghe was going on a long journey and upon hisreturn at the end of two years he honed tofind the palace completed iDuring the two years spent in travelGondoforus admired all the beautiful buildings and palaces of Europe Asia and AfricaHe found them magnificent but his heartswelled with pride at the thought that hisnew palace would eclipse them all and having returned into his kingdom he went immediately to the spot where he had orderedhis new dwelling to be builtWhen he arrived expecting to be dazzledbythe splendor of the precious stones andcostly marbles he paled with anger seeingthat not a single stone had been put in placeHe sent for St Thomas and sternly demandedof him what -he had done with the immensetreasure he had confided to bim and thearchitect replied that he had distributed themamong the poorThe king enraged at having been deceivedcaused th s singular architect to be throwninto prison and began to meditate somemeans of torture which he might employ topunish him sufficiently for his treason Hefell asleep thinking about it and while hewas sleeping his deceased brother appearedsuddenly before him and said Brother dono harm to this brave architect He is a servant of tiod and has not failed of his promiseThe angels have shown me a marvelouspalace of gold silver and precious stoneswhich has been built for you in ParadiseThere are many beautiful mansions on highmy brother but not one is to be compared tothat which has been prepared for youthanks to the efforts of this holy manSaying these words the apparition disappeared and Gondoforus waking up surprised ran and cast himself at the feet of hisErisoneraud humbly asked his pardon foraving thus outraged himSt Thomas kindly raising him saidDont you know O King that the only enduring mansions are those which are prepared for us in Heaven by our faith andby our CharityThe wing convinced by these words and bythe vision which he had seen spent the remain

various times during the last fewyears I have read with much interestfliscussions as to how the woodcockTisakes his whistle that delicious rippleof melody so fascinating to the ear ofthe sportsman who hunts the shy andhandsome game birdWhile shooting woodcock recently incompany with a friend this question was-discussed my friend at once asserverating that the whistle was made bv thebirds wing and not through the billby the aid of the throat at the sametime saying to me When next youshoot a woodcock without injuring itswings and without killing it simplymaking a body shot sufficiently hardto bring the bird to the ground callyour dog to heel retrieve the bird yourself hold him by the bill suspended inthe air at arms length and in a flutteriii to escape from your hand the whistle will be made by the birds wingsWhile shooting a few days later withanother friend I was fortunate enoughto make a body shot on a woodcocksvMcli came to the ground with the1wings unbroken The dog caught theird which had attempted to fly afterit struck the ground I took it from theclogs mouth and seeing its wings wereunbroken I determined to make the teslIhen and thereAfter telling my friend what I wasabout to do I heldthe bird by its billat arms length and the result was thatit made the whittle three times eachtime by executing a rotary movementof the wings and body while flutteringIf any sportsman doubts this statement I wish he would do as I have donestud all doubt will be dispelled from hisimind as to how this enchanting whistleis produced Forest and StreamHeart Disease in a MonkeyA new

withtheir reason and consequently thosewere the halcyon days of travelingcard ilayers abroad for what was intheir professionI used to like a quiet game of drawmyself and indulged my liking whenever my duty gave me opportunityThis of course placed me in sympathyWith others who played and one day Igot into a pretty stiff game on boardmy own train while in the actual disicharge of my duty and yet withoutholding a hand I had been on the roadbut a week or two and was not yetacquainted with all its patrons In going through the train collecting faresthis day I speak of I came to four passengers who were absorbed in a gameof poker a newspaper spread on theirlaps to play onFares please I saidPeople didnt bother much about buying tickets in those days and a largeproportion of the fares were paid onthe trains Three of the men handedover their money The fourth whoseemed somewhat excited saidConductor cant you come round alittle laterI told him I must have his fare thenand there He looked

were generallyeasy and profitable game for the pro-fessional card players Some of thedrovers though had the reputation ofbeing very handy with cards themselevs and bragged of it I used to hearof Uncle Joe Ileddy Big Ike Sloat andothers as among the quick witted drovers who were said to be able to takecare of themselves against the tricksof the sharpers One day I noticedamong my passengers a noted cardsharp known f amiliarly as Jersey Jerry At a way station a little old mangray and wrinkled but still active andspry got aboard the train He was avery loquacious old gentleman andgave me the impression that he hadbeen indulging overmuch in applejackthat being a belt of country famous forthat insinuating and lingering tippleHe talked to everybody within hearingand finally expressed a willingness toplay anyone a game of old sledge fora quarter a corner Nobody paid anyattention to the garrulous old fellowfor a long time and then Jersey Jerrybegan to take an interest in him Thissurprised me as the old man seemedto me to be rather small game for thatfar reaching individual At any ratebefore long Jerry was busy playing himGld sledge for a quarter a corner andthe old man was winning every gamemuch to his apparent delight and inthe process of putting away and producing his stakes he displaj cd a walletthe plethora of which explained the interest Jersey Jerry was manifesting inhimAfter awhile in going through thetrain I noticed that the game hadchanged to poker and that Jerry hadevidently led his intended victim alonguntil they were playing a pretty stiftgame but the old man was winningand he was elated beyond measure andmore garrulous than ever I stoppedto watch the play It was Jerrys dealI knew somehow that now he hadworked up to his game and that theclimax was at hand I felt sorry forthe old man but it was not my affairHe had paraded himself too much anyhow As Jerry tossed his opponentscards to him I caught a glance of eachand would have sworn that foursofthem were kings The old rnah tookthem up cautiously and held them closeFOUR ACES POP SAID JERRYHe seemed to gloat over the possessionoi them He drew no cards Jerrydrew one Then they began to bet Theold man was game and came back atJerry without a quiver Four kingswas a tremendous hand but I knewthat Jersey Jerry had given himself abetter one as Avell as I knew I wasthere By and by

still less those thatwill continue in the far off ages toserve a useful purpose Yet there is atleast one great undertaking conceivedand executed by an engineer which during the space of 4000 years has neverceased its office on which the life of afertile province absolutely depends today We refer to the Bahr Joussuf-the canal of Joseph built accordingrito tradition by the son of Jacob andwhich constitutes not the least of themany blessings he conferred on Egyptduring the years of his prosperous ruleThis canal took its rise from the Nileat Asiut and ran almost parallel withit for nearly 250 miles creeping alongunder the western cliffs of the Nilevalley with many a bend and windinguntil at length it gained an eminenceas compared with the river bed whichenabled it to turn westward through anarrow pass and enter a district whichwas otherwise shut off from the fertilizing floods on which all vegetation inFgypt depends The northern endstood 17 feet above low Nile while atthe southern end it wras at an equal elevation from the river Through thiscut ran a perennial stream which watered a province named the Fayoumendowing it with fertility and supporting a large population In the time oithe annual flood a great part of thecanal was under water and then therivers current would rush in a moredirect course into the pass carryingwith it the rich salt which takes theplace of manure and keeps the sod in astate of constant productivenessAll this with tie exception of thetraditions that Joseph built it can beverified to day and it is not mere supposition or rumor Until eight yearsago it was firmly believed that the design has always been limited to an irrigation scheme larger no doubt thanthat now in operation as shown by thetraces of abandoned canals and by theslow aggregation of waste water whichhad acumulated ini the Birket elQuiirunbut still essentially the same in character Many accounts have been writtenby Greek and Roman historians such asHerodotus Strabo Mutianus and Plinyarid repeated in monkish legends orportrayed in the maps of the middleages which agreed with the f olldore of-the district These tales explained tha tthe canal dug by the ancient Israelitesserved to carry the surplus waters ofthe Nile into an extensive lake lyingsouth of the Fayoum and so large thatit not only modified the climate tempering the arid winds of the desert and converting them into the balmy airs whichnourished the vines and the olives intoa fullness and fragrance unknown inany part of the country but also addedto the food supply of the land such immense quantities of fish that the royalprerogative of the right of piscary atthe great weir was valued at 250000annually This lake was said to be 450miles round and to be navigated by afleet of vessels and the whole circumference

contrary tothe laws of the state Ever since I havebeen a member of the house I have consistently and persistently voted for everymeasure that looked to the suppression ofoleomargarine imitation butter or imitation cheese Every one of us has apersonal interest in this matter I for onetlo not want to butter my bread with soapgrease even if it has been chemicallytreatedThe board of health of Massachusettswas called upon while I was a member ofthe state legislature to pass upon rhehealthfulness of this product and thatboard composed of some of the most prorrinent men in our commonwealth saidamong other things that the door for thepropagation of that awful disease knownas trichinosis was thrown open to someextent at least by the manufacture ofthis product And why They explainedwhy They said that the oil of the hogin order to be made into oleomargarine orbutterine or any of these other productsnamed here could not be brought up tosuch a temperature that the disease germswould be destroyed because this extremeheat would break the globules and thebutter could not be churned On thestrength of that report by the board ofhealth of Massachusetts the legislature ofwhich I was at the time a member passedthis very stringent measure to which Ihave called attentionThe manufacture of imitation butterand cheese is a fraud upon the great farming interests of this country I have sinceI have been a member of this house voteduniformly consistently and persistentlyfor every measure in the interests of thegreat farming class of our country Thereare a great many tribunes of the farmerwho are demagogues who stand up anddemand in the interest of the farmersthings which would be against their interest But I do believe it to be in the interest of the farmer I believe it to be wisejust and proper to legislate- in behalf ofthe great dairy interests of this countryI have listened to some of the constitutional arguments of the learned gentlemanfrom Louisiana and the learned gentlemanfrom Virginia And when I hear some of theselearned lawyers judges and jurists discourse upon the constitution I sometimesthink of a minister that I heard of of whomit was said that his principal qualification was that he could split a theologicalhair and it was not so good after he hadsplit itas it was beforeNow Mr Speaker I am loyal to ihconstitution of my country I find in 1a provision about interstate commerce Tthere is anything in that provision tharwill enable us to suppress control or restrain the sale of this vile dirty compoundunfit for human food I will vote for such ameasure every timeIt has been said in the course of the debate on this floor by the way of justifyingthis oleomargarine fraud upon tlie greatfarming interests and consumers of thiscountry that the manufacturers of Massachusetts are not honorable merchants avtibusiness men and are guilty of fraud inthe manufacture of leather shoes wcflens etc Lest by silence I should appearto give consent to that charge 1 wish to saya word here in my placeI call the attention of the house to thefact that a distinguished representative ofMassachusetts on one occasion in antebellum times when the dark crisis was impending and the mutterings of war andsecession were heard stood on this floorand said in answer to an attack on ourcommonwealth that he threw down herglove to the whole band of assailantsThat man was Anson Buriingame NowI stand in my place and in behalf of themanufacturers of Masachusetts and measuring mv words I say that for businesshonor for enterprise for integrity 1 throwdown the glove of her manufacturersbankers and business men to the wormApplauseMr Speaker the manufacturer ofMassachusetts sell woolen goods andwhat they are There is no attempt asin the case of oleomargarine to palm ioff for something it is not If there iany split leather in their shoes they aresold for split leather and for half the priceof whole leather If their clothes are madein part of cotton as charged it is to cheapen them and bring them in the reach of thepoor and they are sold for what theyareMs Speaker I might go through thewhole category of articles made by themanufacturers of Massachusetts and usedin civilized life and prove by statistics thatour manufacturers for honor for enterprise for integrity and for success cansafely challenge the world More thanthat Mr Speaker when the yellow wingsof a pestilence flap -themselves in a southern sky when fire or famine or flood or pestilence overtake any section of our country or overtake humanity anywhere in thewide wide world in starving Ireland infamine stricken Russia or in the far awayvictims of the sultan in Armenia I saywho pours out its treasure like water torelieve affliction and distress Why thesesame manufacturers who have been abusedand misrepiesented on this floor to daythese men who are accused of makingclothes out of shoddy and shoes cut ofpasteboardMr Speaker Massachusetts needs no euJogium or defense from me in these elosimrJiouxs of my service here In the languageof one of her great sons we say There shestands Mr Speaker if this is the lastword I shall speak in this house I stand inmy placii and tltrow back to the gentlemenwho make these charges against the snanufacturers of the commonwealth I have inpart the honor to represent I say I deny jthat her irumutacturers are guuty ut irauajind

oithe agricultural bureau gives somevaluable information to growers whointend shipping apples to Europe and-especially to English markets The season begins in August when the domestic crops come into the market and apples bring comparatively low pricesAn occasional large crop in Spain orPortugal may result in shipments toEngland in August and September butusually the supplies are confined to thehome product The bulk of Englishapples an average year bring aboutSI to 175 per 112 pounds but superiorkinds fetch much higher prices Ordinarily they are seen in the marketup to the end of January This yearthe crop was deficient and was practieallyvused up early in October and themarket left clear for American andCanadian fruit which is practically ailthat is available Our early shipmen sdid not fairly represent us and broughtlow juices Our European agent hasheard complaint of a decrease in thesize of the barrel which usually nettedrather less than 100 pounds each thishould not be it is a mistake whichmust be avoided Canadian barrelsweigh from 130 to 340 pounds Whenour shippers see Canadian Baldwinsquoted at from 2 to 250 per barrelthis difference in weight will accountfor it and is no evidence of superiorquality on the part of Canadian fruitThe bulk of the shipment consists olBaldwinsTorthern Spy and Greeningsour Baldwins are finer than Canadian but are not such good keepersThey range from 250 to 350 forCanadian barrels and 2 to 275 forAmerican barrels but it is thought thatthese prices can hardly be maintainedon account of the large Canadian andAmerican croxs Greenings must belarge as they are used for dumplingssmall samples would easily fall off idollar a barrel and make the shipmentimremunerativc Northern Spys bringabout the same price as BaldwinsFreights to London Liverpool Glasgow or Bristol all of them good applemarkets are approximately 1 a barrel and all charges including salesmancommission would be covered by 25cents Apples are sold at auction cashon

cellars are not so proofagainst frosts as to make the storing offruit in them an entirely safe matterA low temperature is certainly neededto keep fruit in the best condition butthe possibility oi the mercury fall vugbelow the safety point during a coldsnap is a factor to be guarded againstA cellar can be made frost proof by laying a single wall of brick inside theunderpinning leaving an air space between the bricks and the outer wall butthis is somewhat expensive An easieiand cheaper way is to put up some shortstuds just inside the underpinning andto nail upon these thin matched boardsdown to

crazyunless I rid myself of it It will soundstrauge no doubt to some but my heartdid not beat as it should Its action was irregular There would be two pulsations orperhaps three and then a sudden cessationMy heart seemed to rest for the period ofone or two beats and then resume its actionSometimes such lapses would not be so frequent as that but scarcely a day passed thatthey did not occur It felt as though something would strike the heart with greatforce and push it out of place During theperiod whenever I lay down to sleep orrest my hands would become perfectlynumb and helpless I could feel the temporary parary sis coming over them but Icould do nothing which would prevent itHy feet were affected in a like manner andI had considerable difficulty in walkingwhen such a spell had
