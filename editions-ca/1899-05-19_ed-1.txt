onspecified dates to receive paymentThey are to be accompanied by theircompany officers for the purpose of identification Both Gen Gomez and theEfovernor general feel that the privatesought not to lose their share in theAmerican gratuity merely because theschemes of certain high officers in theCuban army have interposed obstaclesThe belief among the Americans isthat the company officers will assist inthis way Gen Brookes order will bedisseminated through the newspapersplacarded in the post offices and giventhe widest circulation practicableWashington May 16 High officialsin the war

animpression also that the intention ofGen Brooke to see that the 53000000are distributed among all the Cubantroops has caused disappointmentamong the many generals and otherhigh officers who were evidently expecting to secure a large share of themoneyThe belief was expressed that thesituation in Cuba is serious and thatcareful and diplomatic managementwill be neededIt was stated that no orders

Commander Todd of the Wilmington aninteresting account of the remarkablevoyage of an exploration up the Amazon river made b3 that ve sel in Aprillast The Wilmington was instructedby the navy department to push on upthe great river and ascertain how farit was navigable Capt Todd reportsthat he ascended to Yuquitos in Peruwhich is about 2100 miles up the riverThis voyage was made as he saysagainst an adverse current averagingthree knots for the entire distanceManaos at the junction of the RioNegro with the Amazon has heretofore been regarded as the head ofnavigation for steam vessels and fromthat fact it has grown to be a prosperous city of 40000 inhabitants Consequently the intention of Capt Toddto ascend the river above that pointcaused consternation and in the endas revealed by sub equent reports ledto some adverse demonstrations againstthe American consul and against the native pilots who assisted the Wilmingtons commander to make the voyageCapt Todd succeeded notwithstanding these obstacles in ascending theAmazon for 1000 miles above Manaosand had it not been for lack of fuel hecould have steamed about o00 milesfurther he believes As it was theWilmington which entered the Amazon from the Atlantic was within 400miles of the Pacific and well into Perubefore she turned back down the riverThe possibilities of the successfulnavigation of the vast and hithertounknown interior of South Americarevealed by Capt Todds voyage willit is believed be of the greatest commercial importance Capt Todd showsthat the Amazon like the Mississippiis so changeable in its channel as notto permit of successful charting sothat expert pilots will alwa s be requiredBETTER SENSE RULES CUBAPolitical Groups and the Fifteen DailyNewspapers Realize That a Cessationof

which is out oiler in thebay Could we reach it we might hidein a certain wine cellar which lam almost sure a few moments labor wouldmake secret I had remained and hidden in it indeed only I was persuadedthe city was safer Could we but reachthe water I believe we could secure aboat and so reach the islandYou are brave senorita I said forI could not help admiring this command of her wits at such a time RutI fear your plan would not serve Forone thing where would you obtain aboat Our men must have seized themallShe faltered a moment but againher wonderful dark eyea lighted andshe answered eagerlyBut the fisher village I conceivethere must be boats there It is abovehalf a league from here and I am sureyour bands have not gone so far Moreover it has nothing to tempt robberyAh could we but reach the villageWhy so you shall if the thing isiobe mortally compassed I cried In aburst of great pity and compassionvStay a moment T went on and Iwill take counsel with my comradesIn the fewest words possible 1 repeated our talk and stated her plan1 believe they might fetch out uponthe beach said Sellinger for as Ihave told you there is a pretty quietwav to it but the rub comes afterwardCaptain put in Mac Ivrach whohad been quietly listening whatthink ye o a disguise Clap the halethree into add elaes pitting the women in breeks and daub a bit o smut ontheir faces Our laddies will hae theirdrop lang syne and gae aboot mi nosharp eerWhy that is not so bad said thecaptain brightening What say youtr Tym and ArdickIt is at least something definitesaid Mr Tym I am for trying it onthe wholeI agreed with him and without moreado turned to Don Enrique and theladies and put the business into SpanishThey listened eagerly and lost notime in deciding Indeed they barelytook the words off my tongue ere thejbroke out in consent But in fact itwas easy to see by their anxious looksand pale cheeks that they were desperate enough for almost anythingThis was a great relief to us for certainly we had nothing left to turn tounless it might be some desperate action and that with no reasonable hopeof successI saw the senorita and the other incline their heads a moment as thoughin prayer and the don murmuredsomething under his heavy mustacheI think we were not two minutes offthe stairs when we heard a confusedand swelling sound of voices and onunbarring one of the neighbor windows I immediately detected the loudrough tones of some of the buccaneers They were approaching thehouse though as vet the high wall hidthem from viewThe fellows are upon us I calledsoftly to the othersThey hurried into the room andstood by mv shoulderThere could be no mistake about it II The buccaneers were coming along by jtje wall and wire already close uponth gate Where we stood the treescut olT 1 he iew but the sound was certain and distinctTh y will scarce give this place theslight Whoever they are said MrTym Should they be the same rascals thai fell upon the don we musthear

the mannei f their disguise the old ron wore a kind ofDutch -oat belted about Uve waist andextending to the tops of Dair of roughsea boots and on his heal was a greatflapping hat with the forrSrim loppeddown His face and bands weresmeared with dirt and unver his armht carried an old basketThe ladies were attired i a somewhat similar fashion Don- Isabellawore a long coat and heavy tAots herskirts she had of course dissardedand the rest of her visible drtss consisted of an old cap with side fups anda curly wig The wig was tucked chiefly under the cap and at a glance nightwell pass for her proper hair ShQ h3cbedaubed her face and hands and carried a fishers spear As for poor IonaCarmen 1 observed that she had puton a kind of mixed garb consisting ofa high straw hat a blue jacket a leugknit vest coarse hose and well wernjackboots She had smutted her fa -eand hands and carried over her EhovJder a wcll stuffcd bag the seemingweigh of which made her stoop a little so that her face was not quiteealcdThey must hasten exclaimed 2CrTym It i a wonder our fellow- annot already at the door Fetch a goodlook rearward Ardick to see that thcoast is clear and after that no delay1 was only too willing 1 clu y for thecase indeed pressed and with the single word Come to the don I flew tothe rearward door and unbarred itA glance out showed no person in sightA considerable court walled in onboth sides extended to the little rearward street From here it was thelirst and most dangerous stage of thejourney to the shoreGod reward you all said the donwith a sign of bi hand in farewelland he stepped bravely out His companions followed not forgetting a fervent Adios ami we stood in the doorand in a silence of anxiety saw thempass down the courtNothing as yet appeared and presently they were at the opening of thestreet Another breath of suspenseand they had rounded the cornerPy heaven happily compassedexclaimed the captain with a greatbreath of reliefIt is indeed a good start said MrTym himself giving over something ofhis anxious bearingI trust the disguises will serve Isaid with a sigh In truth they werenot of the bestBut at this point we heard a loudshouting from the front of the houseAh our fellows are in said MrTym and forthwith we shut andoarred this door and hastened to theotherMr Tym proved to be right Onopening the wicket we saw one leaf ofthe gate open and the buccaneerscrowding inThe captain looked inquiringly atAir Tym and fetched a good courageous breath and Mac Ivrach and Isaw to our weapons Of course we hadno wish to fight but we eoidd not tellwhat our reckless and angry comradesmight attempt and were resolved tobe preparedWe must parley with them saidMr Tym All will gain timeDo you be spokesman said thecaptain Here come and wellswollen with eholer

face to the wicketand coolly answered Have we not asgood a right to the loot of this placeas youWhy tis the little graybeardcried one man and at that they madea stir of their arms letting the buttsof

intent on the capture of a slavefor instance must he needs let everybody in while he is about it Slav-you are aware are not common spoilas are goods and moneyAay this is all idle talk and awafrom the

At last as ione of the men returned the most Of them were nowabove where we rmld hear themknocking about and railing to one anotherwe passed a whispered wordand all stole quietly cut As we madedown the walk I heard a considerablenoise and thought that the men wereLdemolishing some doors or partitionsbut fortunately no further heedseemed to be paid to usFetching at last into the street weturned in the direction of the waterand pushed along at a sharp walk Itwas in all our minds though we stayednot to talk about it to gain the firstleftward street or passage andthence continne till we obtained someknowledge or were satisfied of thesafety of the fugitives We at lastcame to the leftward turning streetand gladly turned the corner andbroke into a runI think they have got fairly offsaid the captain with a breath of relief It is clear the buccaneers havenot yet penetrated to this quarter andthe time is more than sufficient tofetch the beachI would not croak said I but Iam less hopeful There is the guard onthe ships who might easily espy themand then our straggling parties arepoking about in all directionsWe can soon learn how the matter has gone said M r Tym We havebut to continue to the water side andproceed a little way from there toward this fisher village If we see andhear nothing amiss we mav rest inreasonable content that they aresafeWell we would not turn backwithout that assurance said I Letus proceedWe pushed on down this street accordingly and when we had com intothe next turned to the left and so continued to the outskirts of the townWe learned nothing of moment ortouching the business in hand andthinking it of no use to proceed far-ther and indeed supposing it mightnot be prudent to do so lest we mightbe spied upon by some of Tow landsparty we descended to the beach andso walked for a time up and downAfter some little time it being nownear noon and we beginning to behungry we thought it best to returnto the castle We bent our steps thatway then fore and might have proceeded a fourth part of the distancewhen Mac Ivrach suddenly gave a little cryLook yonmr y asamissWe hastily -prang to his side for hewas standing at the moment on a bitof

gulf stream flowingnorth Here were on the Kurosivo4the Japanese current that flows southand gives us this fishing but the trouble with the old thing is that it wabblesSometimes its off shore sometimesclean in sometimes it runs up into theArctic sometimes cutting across below and thats what affects our fishing and climate according to my mindWhen the Kurosiwo is oil shore as iwas five years ago the fishing is oivtoo That year the yellow tail wereas scarce as hens teeth and the reason was the warm current was off shoreand just touched the islands of southern California This year were rightin it People have been bathing all winter at Avalon which shows that tiewater is warm thats the reason theyellow tail have struck in so soon Joesaw a school going north yrsterdaythat covered

You may talk abouthigh they simply hummed and theline was jerked off so quick that beforeI could think 500 feet was gone whilethe fish my friend had hooked hadtaken everything and was off Therewas a sort of a shriek from the steelthroat of that reel and 900 feet of goodline went I kept my fish well in handI confess by a species of luck andstopped him in less than 800 feet andwhen I felt that the brake was tellingand that he was towing the boat andnot taking line I thought 1 hadchance but just then began some ofthe strangest maneuvers I ever saw ina fish Suddenly I thought he was goneYou who have caught tunas perhapsknow this peculiarity of the fish in getting off when there is no strain en theline another tuna sometimes cuts itwith Its back Well I thought this hadhappened but a Eecond latfr I saw agleam o the water it was my fishhe was coming for me like a shot and ontfel surface his blue back and yellowfins blazing in the sunlight I reeledfor my life there was no doubt aboutthat I had a big nfultiplier that ateup line like a windmill but no reelingon top of the earth could have met thatrush and I saw my line slack and madeup my mind that the game was up Thefish stopped 20 feet from the boat or assoon as he saw me whirled about andfairly dazzled me as the sun struckhim and was off again with 200 feet before I could stop him Then he beganto plunge to the bottom and drag theline like a steam engine hauling theboat round then he came to the topagain and rushed in on me as beforeJ Finally after nearly three hours ofxnis me nsn started down tne coast anntowed us five miles sometimes stopping to rush away occasionally turningand towing the boat against a heavysea that had picked up but invariablyturning south again and in four hoursfrom the start was gaffed after a hardstruggle He broke the first gaff inpieces and tore it from the hands of theboatman The fish was fought hardI XIU1I1 IIICMUI l IU 11JC JIIHMIUIIU MClgllL U183 poundsIts a good fish story no doubt

coast andheaded for San Nicolas 70 miles awaythen I said to Jim T reckon wes outclassed The bass was as long as theboat as near as we could judge and Iwould have given a thousand dollars tosee him weighed He would have tippedthe scales at S00 pounds sure But itwas not our day he suddenly gave alunge and got away for a hundred feetWhile I was reeling him in we saw a bigflurry and a 1 5 foot man eater cane rightout of the water with that bass in hismouth and bit the fish square in twoleaving me the head which I hadmounted as a trophyMy 327 pound fish which has accorded me the championship of the worldI landed fairly and sqtiarely in 55 minutes We were fishing on the bottomwith 12 ounce rods and 21 strand linesAll at once my line began to run out Igave the fish about ten feet and
