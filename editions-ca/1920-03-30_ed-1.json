LOUISVILLE, KY., March 29.
Another striking' bit of proof of
Trutona's remarkable recanstructive
poweis for overcoming after-eifects
of influenza, pneumonia and the Iikg
is to be seen in t-he following- state-
ment made recently hv Mrs. A. ffl !
Franklin. Louisville woman, of 1359 III
Preston street.
"After I had sufficiently recover
ed trom the 'flu' to get out of bed,"
Airs. Franklin said, "I found that 1
was very weak and a dizziness in my
1'ead whenever I would walk render
t d me unfit to do any kind of work.
I had been trouhled with constipa
tion for several years before I con
tracted influenza."
"Well, of course, I tried several
different kinds of medicines for' my
troubles, but about the only result5
I got from them were bills. It
teemed that nothing would do me
any good. Finally I got a bottle of
Trutona and began taking it. li
addition to this I feel strong- and
find I can do more work than I've
been able to do for a long1 time.
That's why I recommend Trutona."
JiiFt as Mrs. Franklin did, thous
ands of people have found Trulona
to be everything that is claimed foi
st as a reconstructive, agency sys
tem purifier and body invigorant, as
well as an unsurpassed combatant
for stomach, liver and bowel troub
les, nervousness, sleeplessness, loss
of appetite and the like.
