Chroniclepays a tribute to the sober soundcommon sense and straightforwardlanguage of the message pointingout that President McKinleys references to the military occupation of Cuba virtually outlines a policy precisely the same as that of Great Britain inEgypt and likely to have the same effectCommenting upon the presidentssurprising language concerning theNicaragua canal which utterly ignores British treaty rights the DailyChronicle says that this matter willarise ere long in a more acute formThe editorial highly approves MrMcKinleys reference to China andGreat BritainThe Standard says Few could havoforetold that the war would work sorapid and drastic a change How absolute the metamorphosis is may bestbe gathered from a comparison withprevious messages It is not rash topredict that the United States will advance in the path upon which theirfeet are now firmly setThe Standard construes Mr McKinleys reference to China as a declaration that had the open door beenclosed or obstructed

OfficesWashington Dec 8 The senate hada long debate in executive sessionWednesday upon the subject of confirmation of the Hawaiian commissionersThe debate wTas started by SenatorHoar who made a vigorous protestagainst the practice of appointing senators upon such a commission Hesaid these senators were when appointed acting under the direction of andbecame the duly authorized agents ofthe president to carry out his ideasand wishes What became oftheir functions as senators he askedwhen the report they make as in thecase of the Hawaiian commission camebefore the senate a co ordinate branchof the government In the case of thejoint high commission now negotiatinga treaty with Great Britain andthe ipeace commission now in Paristhere were the same objections butapplied with greater force Senators should hold aloof from suchpositions because their acts as commissioners were to be passed upon by themselves as senators a very reprehensiblepractice in the opinion of Mr Hoar Heintimated that senators acting for thepresident as a commission which whendealing with a foreign country had toact as a body might be placed in theposition of supporting a cause whichthey as senators would rejectThe method of appointing senatorson commissions wras defended by Senators Morgan and Piatt of Connecticutwho claim there was nothing inconsistent in so doing The debate thenbecame somewhat general and theconstitutional prerogatives of the president and the rights of the senate werediscussed at length upon the legal andtechnical phase of the subjectOther speakers in the controversywere Senators Chandler and Bacon inopposition to the too free exercise bythe president of the power of appointing senators to othrr positions Theypointed out that there was a law onthe statute books inhibiting citizensfrom holding two offices with pay atthe same time and insisted that suchappointments were contrary to thespirit of American institutionsSenator Aldrich was among thosewho contended for the right of thepresident to call into the service of thecountry the talents of senators andmembers of congress in other linesthan those in which their offices indicated The contention on this sidewas to the effect that the practice wasan old one and they cited a supremecourt decision to show that two officesmight be occupied by the same personin cases where the services did notconflictAfter two and a half hours ofWssion the question was referred tothe judiciary committee with instructions to investigate and report uponthe nomination of the commissionersWITH IMPOSING

defended afellow for murder in a little southern townand the worst witness we had against us wasan old German who was a stackbuilder bytrade A stack by the way is merely anothername for a big chimney The old fellow wasperfectly honest and gave his evidence insuch a clear straightforward manner that Ifelt my client was doomed unless I couldthink of some way to break him down WhileI was cudgeling my brains a friend whisperedto me to ask him how high he could build astack What do you mean I asked in surprise Never mind said my friend justslip in that question and see So at the tailend of the cross examination I paused asif struek by an afterthought and said Youare a stackbuilder I believe Yes sir replied the witness Well sir I continuedabout how high could you build I nevergot any further A swift inscrutable changeflashed over the Germans face and he roseexcitedly from his chair As high as dersky he roared So high dose angels comearound it like birds In five seconds he wasraving You see the man was a monomaniac sane on every subject but one andmy friend happened to know his weak spotIt is hardly necessary to say that his evidence in regard to the homicide was promptly ruled out by the judge and as there was noother witness of importance my man wascleared The rascal should have been hangedand would have been but for the lucky reference to the stack N 0 Times-DemocratEsper and

100000 MenWashington Dec 3 The annual reportof Secretary Alger is a practically completeofficial history of the Spanish Americanwar The secretary has given to the publicnot only all the official dispatches thatpassed directly between his own office andcommanding officers in the field and campbut has supplemented these with short explanatory notes setting forth the reasonsfor various movements and then to complete the record of events he has includedin the body of his report the report of GenMiles of all the generals who participatedin the campaign in Cuba Porto Rico or thePhilippines and finally the reports of allof the bureau officers of the war department Nowhere is there shown a disposition to criticise the official dispatches being allowed to tell their own story andgenerally the secretary finds muh topraise and cause for sincere congratulationin the results obtainedHad a Bis Force of SurgeonsThe report proper begins with what maybe described as a chronological history ofthe war consisting of a number of shortparagraphs beginning with the declarationof war on April 21 and setting forth thedate upon which any event of importanceoccurred but making no comment whatever upon the facts The only exception tothis rule is in a reference to the casualtiesat Santiago Some criticism having beenmade that there was a lack of surgeonspresent the report states that there v ere140 surgeons in attendance and that of1431 wounded only 13 died of their woijndsSurrender of SantiaeroTouching the surrender at Santiago thereport shows that Shafter demanded thesurrender on the 3d and renewed this demand on the 4th On the morning of the11th another demand was made On theevening of that day Gen Miles arrived andon the 3th and 14th of July he with GenShafter met the Spanish commander under a iag of truce to discuss the surrender On the afternoon of the 14th GenMiles left Gen Shatters headquartersand soon thereafter went aboard ship preparatory to sailing for Porto Ilico July 17Toral surrendered 23C0O men upon ourterms and the American flag was hoistedby order of Gen ShafterA Great AchievementThe secretary coming down In his history co the middle of August when an order was issued and is now in execution tomuster out 100000 volunteers says Thusan army of about 250000 volunteers andrecruits for the regulars was called intoexistence fiom civil life and including theregular army the total force was 274717men It was organized armed andequipped no supplies being on hand otherthan those for the regulars save Springfield muskets and 50000 men of this forcewere transported by land and sea to battlefields in the tropics 10000 miles apartwhere they won their victories without asingle defeat and all within the period of113 days from the declaration of war to thesigning of the protocolTo No Individual Belongs the CreditThis great achievement can be creditedto no individual it belongs u the nationIt was accomplished through the Intelligence and patriotism ol all who servedfrom the commander in chief to the prKateIn the ranks It also speaks volumes forthe prompt patriotic and intelligent assistTance of the people who furnished in soshort a period the supplies necessary toprepare this great army for the field Tothe heroic men who served in distant landsthe country will ever offer a true meed ofpraise but the mighty army In campready and eager to take the field shouldalso be given equal credit It was theirpresence ready at an hours notice for anyemergency that overawed the enemv andproved to him that further resistancewould be in vainDeatli Rate of the ArmyThe deaths in the army from May 1 toOctober 1 including killed died of woundsand of disease were 2910 the smallestdeath rate recorded of any army in historya remarkable fact when it is consideredthat over 50000 of our troops born and-reared in the temperate zone were campaigning in tropical climates subject torain and heat almost unprecedentedThe secretary says of the volunteers thatto furlough them in winter would be ahardship so he recommends that in lieuof the furlough the officers and men begiven cwo months pay at the time of theirdischarge thus admitting of their promptdischarge in their present camps in thesouthWants Army of 100000 MenUnder the head of Increase In the permanent establishment the secretary says Inview of the needs of a military force in theislands occupied by the United States itis earnestly recommended that the regular army be permanently increased to100000 men and the requisite officers thata portion of this army be recruited fromthe inhabitants of those islands to be mustered into the service of the United Statescommanded by officers of our army discretion however to be given to the president vO make appointments of officersfrom the force so recruitedThese men are acclimated understandthe language and habits of their countrymen and their enlistment will not onlygive them employment but also have thetendency to enable the government to getinto closer touch with their people than itwould otherwise be able to do This wouldalso relieve our own people from serving in those climates to a large extent andwould moreover enable the volunteersto be mustered out of the service and return to the avocations of civil lifeAnother suggestion is that there shouldbe employed in the United States servicea constabulary force for the cities of CubaPorto IUco and the Philippines who havehad the experience and can speak the language of the islandsRelief for CubansSecretary Alger thinks that the government will be greatly taxed to supply foodto the destitute especially in Cuba Theaffort should be made he thinks io givethe people work instead of allowing memto dwell in idleness living upon charityHe says Would it not be wise econcmyfor the government of the United Statesto construct a substantial railroad practically the whole length of the island ofCuba with branch roads to the leading- cities on the coast Such a road would ofcourse cost a large sum perhaps 20000000 but it would give employment to thepeople of Cuba teach them habits nj industry be an inducement for them to cultivate their farms and thus lurnish suppliesfor the laborers and for market when theroad is constructed This in my judgmentIs absolutely essential to the pacificationand development of that great Island Itwill bring its minerals lumber and agricultural products to market and open upcommunication with all parts of the slnndwith the least possible delay The roadwould be a good property and when It hasserved its purpose for the governmentcould be sold for its cose If such an improvement is not made the governmentwill no doubt expend rully that amountcharityThe secretary says that even if this roadis to be built there s necessity for a largeappropriation to relieve the destitute Thequestion of sanitation of the cities shouldalso have Immediate Attention and - portion Of the taxes collected in tho Islandshould be expended forthat workEstimatesThe statement of expenditures and estimates presents some formidable figuresisThe expenditures for the fiscal year endedJune 30 last were 62534784 and the estimates for the next fiscal year beginningJuly l 1889 are S195250377 Ofgreat estimate the sum of 55430909 ischarged to pay- of the army The estimateof extraordinary appropriations requiredfor the six months ending June 30 1899 are60177539 and the estimate for that periodcombined with those for the next fiscalyear reach a total of 255427917At this point the secretary includes inhis report the reports of Gen Miles and allthe other generals who participated in active operations He then takes up the telegraphic and other correspondence relating to the war and that matter occupiesmore than a fourth of the secretaryswhole report As already stated the dispatches are allowed to tell the story of thewar without comment as far as possible although in instances the secretary prefacesthem with short notes explanatory of thereasons which led to their transmissionRecommendationsNext follow a number of reports of various officers and officials to the secretary of war some of which are Indorsed bythe secretary Of the military academyfor instance he indorses the recommendation for an Increase of the number of cadets by 20 annually to be appointed bythe president and one by each senator tosupply the officers needed for the army oithe futureDiscussing the surgeon generals reporthe says it was a mistake to detail regimental surgeons to large hospitals but thiscould not have been avoided and divisionand general hospitals which were indispensable maintained Ample provisionshould be made to supply the places of surgeons who fall sick One of the great mercies of the campaign was the womennurses The report says that until one haahad experience or made ireful observation he cannot realize the work that thesenoble women did for our sick soldiers in thehospitals but they cannot be weil employed at regimental hospitals in a campaignThe secretary says the Red Cross andother relief associations contributed in avery large degree to the care and comforts of our sick soldiers and should receive tne grateful thanks of the nationThe secretary calls attention to SurgeonGeneral Sternbergs circular of instruct ionsto the army issued April 25 and says hadit been strictly followed less sickness vv ouldhave resultedThe manufacture of theor a similar magazine gun should continue until we have at an early date atleast 501000 of these arms in our arsenalswith a full supply of ammunitionOur Dead in CnbaThe graves of the soldiers at Santiagoin Porto Rico and the Philippines havebeen marked and their remains will bebrought home as soon as the plan3 arecompleteaThe entire

sixth session of the LondonMedical society was begun on Mondayevening at the rooms of the society inChandos street by a short introductoryaddress from the president EdmundOwen surgeon to St Marys hospitalwho remarked that among the manytreasures of their library were 15 volumes of manuscript which formed thediary or commonplace book of EevJohn Ward M A Oxon who was vicarof Stratf from 1662 to 1681Having taken his M A degree in 1652Ward left Oxford for London to studyanatomy at the Barber Chyrurgeonshall in Monkwell street where DrScarborough the friend of Harvey wasgiving demonstrations and to acquirea general knowledge of the healing artNot very many years ago it was quiteusual for the professions of divinity andmedicine to be combined in the one individual and it was to be admitted thatthe custom still lingered in the personsof certain vicars and vicaresses whowere unable to keep themselves fromdabbling in parochial medicine andquack remedies Not a few country villages stiil contained such unorthodoxpractitioners who dispensed medicaladvice to the peril of their too-confidingparishioners and often to theof the local doctorBut Rev John Ward was not an empiric of this sort He had worked diligentl to acquire a knowledge of themedical profession and was doubtlesswell fitted to practice it under the license which he probably received fromhis bishop at the time that he enteredupon his clerical duties In his diaryWard asked himself specially to remember that he must study such diseases as are peculiar to women and alsoto children so as to be ready at themwhen I come into the country Heevidently meant to be a good all roundmanBut the point to which Mr Owen specially referred was that on taking uphis work in Stratf in theforty sixth year after Shakespearesdeath Ward must both as vicar anddoctor have been told of many factsconcerning the bard by those who hadbeen intimately acquainted with himUnfortunately he did not record muchabout him in those memorandumbooks what he did say had been seizedupon by the industriousand duly recorded in his Life ofShakespeareThis was one of the extracts andcoming as it did from a highly educatedman who had lived in the village of theShakespeares it was of undoubted biographical value I have heard thatMr Shakespeare was a natural witwithout any art at all he frequentedthe plays all his younger time but in hiselder days lived at Stratford and supplied the stage with two plays everyyear and for that had an allowance solarge that he spent at the rate of 1000a year which in those times was avery considerable amount corresponding perhaps to 3000 or 4000 of todayAnother extract ran as followsShakespeare Drayton and Ben Jonson had a merry meeting and it seemsdrank too hard for Shakespeare diedof a feavour there contracted Inthose times said Mr Owen it was customary to call obscure diseases feavours just as they are now called influenzas or neuroses but whateverthe actual cause of Shakespearesdeath might have been it was evidentthat local tradition ascribed it rightlyor wrongly to the effects of that merry meeting One had only to think ofthose three cheery friends togetherShakespeare Ben Jonson and Drayton to be assured that it was A pityhowever that Ward unperceived couldnot have been there with his notebookLondon ChronicleINDIANS SWEAR PIOUSLYThey Have a God

between ElCaney and SiboneyAlthough afraid of a possible courtmartial members of the command inclose touch with the hospital tell of oneinstance where an unconscious yellowfever patient was being buried alive bycareless attendants when the unfortunate man was opportunely rescuedIt was on July 14 of the present yearin the yellow fever hospital under thecare of Dr Hamilton Jones One patient died in a tent in which there weresix soldier laid low by the saffronscourge The two worst cases restedupon litters covered with the regulation blanketsOne of the assistant stewards whilewalking through

the yellow death These factswere reported to the doctor whopromptly had the matter referred tothe steward Sergt Meyer with instructions to get the Cuban burial detailand bury the man in the trench as soonas he breathed his lastIt was only a few minutes later thatthe assistant steward saw the Cubansmarch off with a litter bearing a silentform covered by a blanketWell his folks will go in mourningat

increasing size of femininehandwriting It is quite true that themodern young woman will take up witha few words in her slapdash caligraphyas much room as her maiden aunt wouldhave needed for a judicious epistle upon a serious subject But it is not fairto argue that as the size of hands hasgrown the letters formed by them mustnecessarily follow suit Because sevensare now habitually stocked in glovesand five-and-a-half s quite difficult toobtain largeness of handwriting isnone the iess of moral rather than physical significance The biggest man Iknow writes a microscopic hand thewoman whose pen describes the largestcurves has tiny and dainty fingersOther observers will find similar results It is the brain that influencesthe writing Viewed from this standpoint one is able to congratulate thepresent day woman upon at least oneof her characteristics breadth ofnrL She would seem to be emancipating herself from the habit so distressing in her sex of paying undueregard to the little things of lifeIt should be added however thatthere is a large type of writing ago-restiveobstinate and complicatedwith certain well defined signs of egotism which in lieu of breadth meansnothin j more elevated than morbid andpassionate absorption in one subjectonly that subject being frequently thegratification of selfBut we are speaking of the normaltyne Of this I say without fear

view of the graywalls of Bidache and on the wide stonestaircase that led to the great hall wesaw the servants of the household assembled Madame waved her hand ingreeting and the cheer which brokefrom them was drowned in the boomof the bombard from the keep As theblue wreaths of smoke curled upwarda little ball ran to the top of the flagstaff on the keep and the next momentthe banner of Treruouille with the armsof ttochemars of Bidache quarteredthereon spread out its folds to themorning and madame was come homeonce moreWe dined an hour or so later thanasual madame dAyen Palin and myself at the high table and the rest of thehousehold with all Bidache at the nextMadame who seemed in nowise fatigued with her long ride was in thegayest of spirits and rippled with talkAs if thinking she had punished dAyenenough she directed all her conversation towards him and the old beauwas in his element in discussing the intrigues of court life and let me addinteresting for his memory went farbackAt last the dinner came to a closeand Palin rising opened his lips in along thanksgiving to which all madameincluded listened devoutly Our hostess then retired and we three were lefttogether in an absolute silence Had itbeen any other place I would have feltbound to call DAyen to account andask him to name a proxy if he was unable to meet me by reason of his ageBut as it was this was impossible andI contented myself with a frigid reserve in which I was joined bj theHuguenot He looked from one to theother of us with a satirical smile onhis thin lips and then rising made aslight bow and left us to ourselves Aswe returned to our seats from our response to his greeting I blurted out thequestions-Who is M dAyen Why is he hereWho is he It is enough to say lie isone of those menwho live on the folliesof kings And it is enough to say thathis company isorced upon usI have heard that before but madame seemed to like him well enough atdinner I felt I was wrong as I saidthis but the words came outHe is here by the kings orders bythe order of Henry the Great saidPalin with bitterness monsieur youseem a man of iionor What do youthink of a king who would force a mar-riage on a woman to and heI pered words in my ear which struck mespeechlessI could not believe him It was incredible Was this the hero king thegallant soldier the father of his people It could not be truePalin saw the doubt on my faceEven you he said will go to Parisind seeI shall go I am going to dayft will be at the risk of your lifeHaitre Palin there is thekingspeace and even if it were not so 1 willgoHe looked at me long and attentively-Let it be so he muttered to himself and then loudly Well chevalierI have warned you if jtou go 3 ou willwant a safe lodging seek out Pantin inthe Hue des Deux Mondes and mentionmy name The house faces the PontNeuf you cant miss itThank you I will do soThen after a few minutes more of talkwe wished each other good by andpartedAs for myself I was on the cross withwhat I had heard My mind was rackedwith doubt and at last in despair Isought my own room to think over thematter I could make nothing of itturn which way I would To me Palinsstory was incredible But yet it explained and made clear so much Itwas not to offer my sword to the kingthat I would now go to Paris It wouldbe to save the woman I loved if possible How I was to do this I had nodefinite idea the one thing at presentin my mind was Paris Paris I therefore gave the necessary orders toJacques to make ready to start at onceand descending the winding staircaseof the tower wherein my room laysought the great hall with the view ofeither finding madame there or ofsending some one with the request topermit my waiting on her to say goodby The staircase ended in a long darkcorridor hung on each side withtrophies of the chase old armor andfrayed and tattered banners At theend of this was an arched doorway hidden by a heavy curtain I lifted the curtain and passed into the great hall Atfirst I thought it was empty but a second glance showed me madame seatedat a small table in the recess of the bowwindow that overlooked the park Herface leaning on her hand was halfaverted from me and I caught aglimpse of a small foot resting on oneof the lions heads in which the legs ofthe table finished The foot was beating-up and down as if in unison withthe impatience of madames thoughtsbut I could see nothing of her face beyond its contour She was as usualrobed in black wearing no jewels except a old collar round her neck Fora moment I stood in silence looking ather half thinking that here was achance to speak out what was in myheart and then stilling the words bythe thought of how impossible it wasfor a poor man to woo a rich womanAs I stood hat in hand madame suddenly turned with a little start andhastily concealed something as shecaught sight of me I went up at onceand she rose to meet meI have come to say farewell madame and I held out my handSo soon she said as she took it fora moment her eyes not meeting mineYes Paris is far and it will be wellfor me to be there as quickly as possibleParis You are surely not andshe stoppedWhy not madame0 I dont know and hastily onesometimes says things that dont exactly convey ones meaning But I canimagine why you go to Paris you aretired of Bidache and pine for the greatcityIt is not that but and I pointed tothe rolling woods and wide lands thatspread before us I have no responsibilities like these and Auriac whichstands by the sea takes care of itselfbesides I have my way to make as yetYou have friendsOne at any rate and that was restored to me by you and I glanced tothe hilt of my swordShe shook her head in deprecationVery well then I will not recall it toyou but I can never forget life isweet of savor and you gave it back tome We will meet again in Paris tillthen good byAt the Louvre As she glanced upat me trying to smile I saw her eyeswere moist with tears and then butthe wide lands of Bidache were beforeme and I held myself in somehowGood byGood byI turned and without another lookpassed out of the hall As I went downthe stairway I saw on the terrace to myright the figure of dAyen He hadchanged his costume to the slashed andpuffed dress which earned for the gaygentlemen of Henrys court the nickname Bergarrets from M de Savoyescaustic tongue and his wizened facestood out of his snowy ruff in all theglow of its fresh paint With one footresting on the parapet he was engagedin throwing crumbs to the peacocksthat basked on the turf beneath him Iwould have passed but he called outM le

stretching forestYou mistake M dAyen I am nota timber merchant0 A good price he went on notheeding my reply M le -Chevalier Iwas going to say I will have themdown when I am master here Theyobstruct the viewI could have flung him from the terrace but held myself in and turned onmy heelAdieu chevalier he called outafter me and remember what I havesaidI took no notice The man was oldand his gibing

COMESROOSTanHBBj3KdWilBWnJLJUu21AHllHMHnHiaEV ifr tHOMEWe dashed through the streets of Bidache arousing the village dogs asleepin the yellow sunlight to a chorus ofdisapprobation About a dozen sought-I lFjitjJZ ejto revenge tneir disturbed slumbersand following the horses snappedviciously at their heels but we soondistanced them and flinging a curse orso after us in dog language they gaveup the pursuit and returned to blinkaway the afternoon It was my intention to keep to the right of Ivry andafter crossing the Eure head straightfor Paris which I would enter eitherby way of Versailles or St Germains itmattered little what road and therewas plenty of time to decideFor a league or so we galloped alongthe undulating ground which sloped toward the ford near Ezy but as we began to approach the river the countrystudded with apple orchards and trimwith hedgerows of lolly and hawthornbroke in to a wild and rugged moorlandintersected by ratines whose depthswere concealed by a tall undergrowthof Christs thorn and hornbeam whilstbeyond this in russet in sombergreensand grays that faded into absolute bluestretched the forests and woods of Anetand Croth SoreiAs we slid rather than rode downone of these banks my horse cast ashoe and this put a stop to any further hard riding until the mishap couldbe repairedThere is a smith at Ezy monsieursaid Jacques where we can get whatwe want done and flhe i push on toKouvres where there is food accommodation at the Grand CerfIn this manner we jogged along making but slow progress and the sun wassetting when we came into view of thewillow lined banks of the Eure and entered the walnut groves of the outlyingforest in which Ezy lay As we approached we saw that the village wasthree parts deserted and the ruined orchards and smokeless chimneys toldtheir own tale Turning a bend of thegrass grown road we came upon a fewchildren shaking walnuts from a treeabout 200 paces from us whilst a manand a woman stood hard by observingthem At the sight of us the womanturned to the man with an alarmed gesture and he half drew a sword we sawthe white flash and then changing hismind ran off into the forest The children followed suit sliding down thetrunk 6f the tree and fleeing into thebrushwood looking for all the worldlike little brown rabbits as they dashedinto the gaps in the thornAs for the woman she turned slowlyand began to walk toward the villageThey are very bashful here JacquesI mid quickening my paceExcept the lady monsieur and thenwe trotted up alongside herReining in I asked if she could directme to the blacksmiths for thereI WILL GUIDE YOUseemed no sign of a forage about Shemade no answer but stopped and staredat us through her hair which fell inthick masses over her forehead andneck As she did this I saw that sheappeared to be of the superior peasantclass but evidently sunk in povertyShe was young and her features wereso correct that with circumstances alittle altered she would have beenmore than ordinarily good lookingAt present however the face was wanwith privation and there was a frightened look in her eyes I repeated myquestion in as gentle a tone as Lcouldcommand and she found tongueMonsieur pardon I will guideyou0 That isJacques but Idering a littleall very well beganinterrupted him wonto myself what thismeantVery well and thanksShe dropped a courtesy and thenasked with a timid eagernessMonsieur docs not come from theBlaisoisMa foil No This is hardly theway from the Orleannois but lead onplease it grows lateShe glanced up again a suspicion inher eyes and then without anotherword went on before us We followedher down the winding grass grownlane past a few straggling cottageswhere not a soul was visible and upthrough the narrow street where thesight of us drove the few wretched inhabitants into their tumble downhouses as if we had the plague itself atour saddle bows Finally we stoppedbefore a cottage of some pretensions tosize but decayed and worn as all elsewas m tins village wnicn seemcu uulhalf alive Over the entrance to thecottage hung a faded signboard marking that it was the local hostelry and tothe right was a small shed apparentlyused as a workshop and here the smithwas seated on a rough bench gazinginto spaceHe rose at our approach and made asif lid would be off but his daughter asthe young woman turned out to begave him a sign to stay and he haltedmuttering something I could not catchand as I looked at the gloomy figure ofthe man and the musty inn I said outloud Morbleu But it is well wehave time to mend our trouble andmake Rouvres thanks my girl anbending from the saddle I offered ourguide a coin She fairly snatched at itand then coloring up turned and raninto the inn I threw another coin tothe smith and baav mm set cioui shoeing the horseHe shuffled this way and that and answered dully that he would do theJobwillingly but it would take tinffcwohoursBut it will be night by then 1 expostulated and I have to go on I cannot stay hereAs monsieur chooses answered theclcV but you see I have nothingreauy and I am slow now 1 cannothelp itThis is a devil of a place I exclaimedi resigning myself to circumstances and dismounting handed thereins to Jacques As I did so I heardvoices from the inn one apparentlythat of a girl and the other that of aman and it would seem that she wasurging something but what it was Icould aot catch nor was I curious as tothe point of discussion but it struckme that as we had to wait here twohours it would be well to inquire if Icould get some refreshments for ourselves and a feed for the beasts Foranswer to my question I got a gruff goand ask my daughter from the smithwho turned as he spoke and began tofumble with his tools I felt my temper rising hotly but stayed my armand bidding Jacques keep an eye on thehorses stepped toward the door of theinn As I put my hand on it to press itopen some one from within made aneffort to keep it shut but I was in nomood to be trifled with further andpushing back the door without furtherceremony stepped in In doing so Ithrust some one back a yard or so andfound that it was the girl who was trying to bar me out Ashamed cf the violence I had shown I began to apologize whilst she stood before merubbingherChicago PostoThfvnand her faceflushed and red The room wasbare and drear beyond descriptionThere were a couple of rougli tables achair or so an iron pot simmering overa fire of reen wood whose rjunentr odorfilled the chamber In a corner a manlay apparently asleep a tattered cloakdrawn over his features so as to entirely conceal them I felt in a momentthat this was the stranger who had fledoil our approach and that he was plajing fox Guessing there was more behind this than appeared but not showing my suspicions in the least I addressed the girlI am truly sorry and hope 3ou arenot hurt had I known it was you Ishould have been gentler I have butcome to ask if I can get some wine forourselves and food for the horsesIt is nothing she stammered I amnot hurt There is but a little souphere and for the horses the grass thaigrows outsideThere is some wine there at anyrate and I rested my eye on a horrcup down whose side a red drop wastrickling and then let it fall on the stilifigure in the corner of the roomThere is no fear I continued youwill be paid I do not took like a gentleman of the road

minl it is verydifficult to change it especially in thecase of extremely sensitive and highlynervous persons asked a Brooklynexpert on nerves Not long ago I hada visit from a man who was afraid hewas losing his reason because of a verysimple persistence of a certain thoughtor idea which he could not snake offThe history of the case is one oftenfound in cases of hypochondriasis developed from using the telephone Mypatient for about a years time had occasion to telephone every day to a tradecustomer in New York Manhattan ifyou like The New Yorker had a peculiar high tenor squeak to his voiceand somehow my friend got to picturing him as a little chap with a thin faceThis habit grew day after day until thecustomer took a real shape and fcrmihthe mind of my patient all based ofcourse upon his voice As he talkedover the telephone there always wamentally pictured that little chap withthe thin face and squeaky voice Wellone day my patient called at The offictof his New York customer and as hewalked into the lace and saw a tallVfat man weighing nearly 300 pounds hecould scarcelj believe his eyes Whenthe fat man opened his mouth andtalked my patient says the squeakyvoice with which he was familiar sounded strange and unnatural He told theowner of the absurd voice in view ofhis size about having pictured him as alittle thin person and there was a goodlaugh over the odd difference of therealityBut the next day when my friendused the telephone and the squeakyvoice came to him he had to struggleto get away from thinking of his fatpatron as being little and thin Hetalked the matter over with his wifeand laughed about it bnt soon therecame a time when he forgot al aboutthe actual existence of his customerand the little thin faced chap vas againtalking to him over the wire Then itwTas that he came to me He feared hesaid that his mind was giving way because of the persistence of th e odd picture of the thin man I thotrght thecase was easilj disposed of ard told myfriend to go to New York every day fora week and visit his fat customer Thishe did but every time he telephonedthe squeaky voice would bring up themental picture formed before he hadset eyes on its owner JI was in despair and my patient wa 3growing gray from worryingwhen I hitupon the happy expedient of placing aphotograph of the fat man an the telephone where the e3e of the patientcould rest upon it as he talked Theresult was the disappearance forever o 5the thin chap My patient in lookingat the picture of the owner of thesqueaky voice got his mind working -uponthe same lines that wuuld havabeen followed had he met the fat manface to face the first time he heard hisvoice These cases are common evevvday We form queerlr opposite pictures of men and women we hear overthe telephone and never see but in thfgreat majority of instances the impression is a momentary one and it is seldom that the mistake is ever forcedupon us in the startling way describedby the patient I told ofThe telephone by the way has produoed very many queer cases of neurasthenia that remain unaccountablethe Ivypothesis that thenewhabit brings them into existence Xhave had very many patients who hadto give up the use

coursea cold storage house is the desirablething yet to many farmers this is animpossible opportunitj for the reaEon that most farms are so farfrom a cold storage plant that itwould not pay to haul the roots thereBesides the farmer frequently wantsto store roots that he intends to useTHE NEBRASKA METHODhimself in feeding stock or for household consumption later on In the storage of sugar beets for factory use various ways have been tried In ourfirst illustration we give a method usedin Nebraska for the purpose mentioned In this case the pile of beets isabout four feet wide and the pile ofdirt over them is six inches in thickness Above the rst layer of earth isa layer of six inches of straw and before cold weather comes on two inchesmore of dirt are put on The holeshown at V is a ventilating holeonefoot in diameterIs reported to doThis kind of a pitvery well inIVA WISCONSIN WAYbraska Whether it will be found equally serviceable in some other parts of thecountry can only be told by experienceIn our second illustration is shownthe method as followed in some partsof Wisconsin Notice is taken of thefact that greater cold and more adverseconditions must be faced The cutshows a cross section only as the beetsare really placed in a deep and widefurrow and may be any number of feetin length The pile here shown is aboutsix feet wide and three feet high Ontop of it is 18 inches of earth with ventilating tile every six feet This tileis left open while the roots are sweat-ing but can be closed after that process is completed Farmers ReviewPITTING POTATOESAfter All Has Been Done or Said ThtIs the Safest Way of Keeping the TubersrPotatoes keep better in a pit thananywhere else but they must be wellprotected to prevent zero weather fromcatching them They should never becovered deeply enough to allow them tobecome at all heated or they will startto grow The first covering should benot more than six inches deep and thisshould not be increased until theground has frozen enough to bear up aman Then put on a covering of strawever the soil already on and put onmore soil patting it down to make itshed rain Leave the pit until aetualwinter has come and the ground is wellfrozen and then over all put a foot offresh manure from the stables Dontbe afraid of driving the frost in for thiswill not happen Keep the manure onuntil the potatoes are needed in thespring for the covered pit will notthaw out nor will the manure allow it tofreeze any more and the potatoes willnot sprout until time for planting in thespring if left in the pitI Aouiabe placed in a pit by

PAPJS EX EEIDAY DECEMBER 9 1898FEEDING DAIRY COWSTrne Secret of Success with AnimalsLies iu the Farmers Ingenuityand AbilitySuccessful dairy feeding does not depend wholly upon the kind of foodusedor the relative amounts of each kindfed but it depends largely upon howit is fed and when itis fedThe successful feeder will study thewants of his cows just as much as thesuccessful caterer studies the tastesof his customers He will try to givethem their food i as palatable a condition as possible though not necessarily in what may be termed a fancystyle which would be impractical Hewill also see to the comfort of his animals This point we consider as beingdirectly in connection with feedingfor a cow which is uncomfortable mustnecessarily use more of her feed forbodily repair than she otherwisewould No dairyman would ever thinkof using a milk bucket which leakedyet there are many dairymen whoduring a single winter lose milk by thepound through the cracks of theirstable Such conditions must necessarily increase the expenses and hencelower the profit It is a point whichwe consider most directly connectedwith the subject of practical and scientific dairy feedingRegularity in feeding is another important factor If cattle are fed atcertain times of the day and onlj7 atihose times as far as practical thevwill learn to expect it then and onlythen This will remove the uneasinessoften exhibited when persons enterthe stable or are working1 about themat other times It is also a saving ontheir digestive organsNo permanent rule can be laid downby which to feed dairy cattle No onefeed no one way of feeding or no oneamount of feed will suit all conditionsor all animals The true secret of success in the business lies in the abilityand ingenuitj of the dairyman himself He must be capable of decidingwhat feeds he can use and how he canuse tnem to produce the greatestamount of his particular productmilk etc of best quality and withleast expense Unless he is in

buiftding In the expectation that warm weather wouldquickly melt it but little was put upIt kept surprisingly and thereafterlarge quantities were stacked yearlyuntil for several years past the out ofdoors stack has furnished ice for creamery and household uniil about September 1 There being a scarcity of icethis year I had to use an inferior quality four or five inches thick The stackwas about thirty feet square and fourfeet high It has furnished ice to coolabout 300 quarts of milk per day ucreamery -besides refrigerator inhouse Mj method is to spread a fewinches of shavings on the ground forthe ice to rest on stack the ice undcover with shaviugs to a depth ofabout a foot I have found a low stacicbest as there seems to be comparatively little melted from top to bottombut if an opening through the side covering lets the air in it will cut awayvery fast and the higher the stack isthe more difficulty in keeping the sidescovered I have used the same shapingsyear after year I doubt whether it jsimportcnt to have the stack in theshade the shavings getting moisturefrom rain and from the ice evaporationkeeps down the temperatureDo not expect to sell butter at extraprices to private
