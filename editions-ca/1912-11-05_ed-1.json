probably heard tha someon knw a
girl who was tortunate enough to se
cure a two year subesription and has a
few votes reserved.
Don't believe all these tales about
the tremendous reserve vote that this
candidate has or that the other candi
date is holding out. And don't believe
the story about the candidate who has
fifty or a hundred dollarsgand says that
she is going to spend it to win the
prize. That's simply more idle rumor
and when the stories are traced down
to the source there is nothing to them.
Probably the candidate who started
the story is your competitor and sim
ply started the story to irignten you
and cause you to quit so she will have
a better chance. Just remember that

into a dimly lighted hall in which
stood a shock of corn surrounded by
the fruits and vegetables of the season.
The ghost and his stories were there.
Pumpkins heaped with fruit were con
veniently placed and over all shown
the ghostly light from the grinning
jack-o-lantern. They reported an en
joyable evening that turned the year
back to childhood's freedom from
cares in its gladsomeness. The hos
tesses were complimented on their
ability to make every one welcome and
at ease.
