writes For twenty seven years I had been
a constant sufferer from nervous prostra
tion and paid largo sums of money for doc
tors and advertised remedies without bene
fit Three years ago my condition was
alarming the least noise would startle and
unnerve me I was unable to sleep had a
number of sinking spells and slowly grew
worse I began using Dr Miles Restorative
Nervine and Nerve and Liver Pills At first
the medicine seemed to have no effect but
after taking a few bottles I began to notice
a change I rested better at night my appe
tite began to improve and I rapidly grew
better until now I am as nearly restored
to health as one cf my age may expect God

row wmio nis restless comruues pruspuuu
ed hero and there persistently ho followed
the same tiny streak of pay dirt with a
do rgedness of purpose sure of success
W lien the provisions for which his last
dollar had been expended gave out and ho
secnicd no nearer his find than when he
began determinedly as ever he went into
camp and after much coaxing prevailed
oil a comrade to divide up with him
Its no use I tell you Youll follow
that lead till youro gray haired and be
nono the better I dont mind tho grub
so nuch as 1 do sccin you waste your time
for nuthin Give it up and go higher up
tho gulch said his friend
Well Ill stick to it just as long as this
grub lasts and if I dont make a strike
then Ill take your advice and give it up
But Im sure theres gold round there
somewhere All the signs point to it
And Frederick went his way
Although he worked harder and ate more
sparingly than ever ho reached tho bottom
of his meal sack and the last of his bacon
and still no sign of tho realization of his
dreams Tired and discouraged he light
ed a fuso for a final blast and sat down
souc littlo distance away to await the re
sult
Lucks against mo ho thought
himself No grub no money and no
letter from homo for months 1 Im sure of
getting one tonight though he said half
aloud and regaining his hopeful framo
of mind ho arose and went to take a final
look at the hole where he had seemingly
wasted so much timo and labor
MinoGott in himmel said he un
consciously reverting to his mother tongue
at tho sight that met his gaze Therein
a heap all mixed with the earth and rock
was moro gold than ho had ever thought
of even in his wildest dreams There
were little nuggets and big nuggets in a
shining heap Ho had at last found the
wonderful pocket for which he had
been searching so long the pocket that
made his name famous throughout Devils
gulch to this day
It was too good to be true Hardly
could he wait to gather up tho precious
bits before rushing into camp with his
news tho proofs of which bulged from tho
sack ho had improvised from his under
shirt
And tho heft of it boys said Pat
Doncgan admiringly lifting for tho fifth
time tho precious bag and letting it down
on tho table with a thud Bo dad and
shes as heavy fur her size as a bad con
science and niver a word out av im as to
Wheres the nest of his findins and thus
the attention of tho rough crowd of miners
grouped round tho able was again turned
toward Frederick
If a thunder bolt had descended in camp
there could not have been greater surprise
than at the change that had come over the
jubilant Frederick Ho sat there on a
box in tho corner transformed from the
happy fellow of a half hour before into a
picture of tho most hopeless dejection To
tho many awkwardly kind inquiries of his
comrades ho only groaned out bad news
from home and wiping tho perspiration
from his forehead ho took up his bundlo
and rushed out into the night
No one ever knew the cruel contents of
that letter How the fickle Gretchen when
sho finally had received a letter with loss
hopo though more fond in its devotion
than usual had felt called upon to write
some truths to her faithful lover This
was when sho had decided to marry her
mothers choice his rival
The blow coming as it did at tho mo
ment of his supreme joy was too much
tho reaction too great Ho never fully re
covered from tho shock
When after several hours he did not
return his friends growing alarmed went
out to look for him they only heard the
echo of their calling and tho rush of the
foaming river For weeks ho disappeared
and when next heard of ho was living as
ho is to this day on the top of Bear moun
tain a changed man His best friends
could scarcely recognize in him their light
hearted comrade of old
The saddest fate that can befall a soul
Is when it loses faith in God and woman
Hes not at home up here they said
to each other sadly wisely tapping their
foreheads and many and deep laid were
tho schemes to surprise him into telling
the hiding place of his famous pocket find
He was as reticent on that subjeot as he
was as to tho cause of his living up there
all alone
I want nothing between me and heav
en was all the satisfaction they could get
out of him and they finally gave it up
concluding ho had forgotten where his
gold was hidden As the years rolled on
by ones and twos they hit the trail in
searchof pastur6s new and loft Fritz

of hor affections Her family means had
fallen far below what was necessary to
