It's true the amount lookj.Tiall, and some may wonder why weare so persistent over so small anamount, but five hundred $2.00 accounts total $1,000, and that would buyseveral months' supply of newsprintpaper.

Thesechecks are made payable on localbanks, and are forwarded to the genjeral agent of each town where theyare distributed to the employes. Thisgreatly reduces the expenses of theroad, and facilitates the way of paying off.! With the last visit of the pay cato Paris there passed fron railroadhistory a time-honored institution, onewhose visits was always eagerly looked forward to by the employes, theirfamilies and the merchants of thecity and county.
