NOTEImpresses the Hope on the Part of thUnited States That the War Will BBrought to a Speedy Close In the Interestof All ConcernedChicago Oct 2 A Washington special to the Times Herald says It isnow possible for the Times Herald togive not the exact text of the famousWoodford note to Spain but a fairstatement of its substanceThis celebrated and much discusseddocument simply expresses on thepart of the United States the hopethat the war will be brought to a closeas speedily as possible but there is nodae fixed when the consummation is tobe reached and that the interests ofSpain no less than the interests of theUnited States the interests of humanity and the interests of the world atlarge are reasons why the war shouldbe ended with the least possible delayAnd with that in view acting as afriend of Spain because of the greatstake which the United States has inCuba financially and otherwise because of the annoyance to which theUnited States has been put by maintaining a patrol over and preventingthe sailing of filibustering expeditionsand because civilization opposes warthe United States tenders to Spain itsgood offices to act as a friend betweenthe mother country and her rebelliouscolony in the hope that she may beable to effect a settlement and bringthe warfare to a closeThis is all there is in the note Thereis not the faintest suggestion of thisgovernment forcing upon Spain hergood offices if she does not care to voluntarily accept them nor is there anintimation that the war must bebrought to an end by a certain time orthat Spain must return answer to thisnote

thought Suddenly realizeing that this would not do she seatedherself by the window steadily gazing out at the flame fringed clouds rimming the western hills She must becalm to think what was to be done foraction of some sort appeared to her inevitable The idea of appealing to herfather she impatiently abandoned asuseless Fair rather would she getwarning to Neil himself but where wasthe messenger who would serve herpurpose without danger of betrayalCould she wait until her father had retired for the night and go herself Twomiles of lonely mountain climbingmight have seemed a

their meaningseemed luminous Ah there must behelp God could not mean that she wasto sit helpless while that great wrongwas being perpetrated He would showherAnd a moment later her f aitli

knew Hop Sing only bysight but this was enough to assure herthat hewas the one for the missionIn a moment a few words had beenwritten conveying the warning in simplest phrase the note unsigned but soexpressed that she felt its sinceritycould not be questioned and then hurriedly pinning on her hat and seizingher purse she flew down the stairsShe could not wait for the girls message to bring the

transferring freight from theshore to the deck of the craft on whichthey were about to take passageThe elder of the two who had beencontinually looking about in an expectnnt manner suddenly called out Hereyou are at last old fellow What inthe world has kept youThen came running- toward him skilfully and yet politely eluding all playful attempts to impede his progressa little boy infant five years of agewho was a perfect picture of ruggedhealth and childish beauty His hatperched carelessly on his head formedthe background for a mass of goldenhair blown hither and thither as hissturdy little legs sped down the gravelslope His round happy face glowedin the morning air and his eyes sparkled with ill suppressed excitementOh papa he began before he hadquite recovered his breath I have hadsuch a time with MaxI was beginning to fear he had madea breakfast of you was the fathersanswer as the child slipped one littlehand in hisHe might try if he could get at menow rejoined the little fellow Butlies safe enough in one of the storerooms if some one dont let him outBut at that moment the steamboatgave a shrill whistle and Jack walkingbetween his father and his fathersfriend turned to go on board the boatAmong the passengers assembled onthe upper deck stood a little girl of morthan ordinary attractiveness She wasjust passiug that line of life on oneside of which people write girl andon the other young lady She attracted not a little attention as shestood there leaning- lightly over therail When Jack and his guardiansreached the deck she was saying goodby to a sun bonneted friend on thelanding and Towle the younger of thetwo men caught the full beauty ofthe fresh face as she laughed out somepert reply to her friends earnest caution Now do be careful PriscillaAlreadj the time for casting off themoorings had passed The captain wasvigorously ordering about the deckhands and confusion reigned Thepretty girl stood up on a seat to getclear of a line that was being hauled instill talking with her friend on shorePretty as a picture thought Towleas he watched the lissome figure swaying with the motion of the boat Priscilla waved her last adieu and then herfriend mingling with those left on thelanding turned awajrThe young girl still stood on the railseat Towle hovered in her immediatevicinity Jack was watching the receding shore Presently the childs voicerose in a cry that was almost a screamLook papa There comes MaxDown the slope toward the waterbounded the bigfewfoundland Bushing through the little party that hadjust left the landing- the dog broughtup with a mighty effort on the veryedge of the wharfJack jumping up on the rail seatwaved both hands and shouted Goodby old fellow Good b MaxBut Max misinterpreted the gesturePrompt in obedience to the supposedsignal he jumped into the water andstruck out in the wake of the boatIt was not under much headway yetbut Max could make but a poor showing in the race Jack became verynervous He scarcely knew whetherMax was swimming or droAvningCant we stop the boat lie askedOh no said his father Max willget tired iu a minute and make for theshoreTowle leaned over the stern and calledto the dog to go buck but Max took itill for encouragement and swam onsteadily Th boat as steadily gainedan him Thts channel was wideningnow and Max evidently had no intention of abandoning the raceEveryone on the boat presently became much excited and beginning withsympathy for Little Jack ended in thedeepest anxiety as to the fate of the dogJack was still standing beside the girlvho was making no effort to hide theexcitement that was taking possessionzS her Jacks father stood just behindwith a light hand on his childs shoulter Towle was not far awayThe boy was trembling- in every limbOh Max Dear Max he cried Youcant catelx uel Then recalled by hisfathers touch Why papa We muststop the boat so he can catch tipThe girl reached out her hand andtook hold of Jacks She said nothingbut her teeth vrere pressed tightlyagainst her lower lip and the big browneyes were beginning to fillThe only apparently uninterested person on the boat was the captain Theawning had not yet been spread over thedeck and he could plainly be seen standing in the pilot house Towle turnedtoward him and called out I say captain cant you slow down and let mydog come up with us He wont goback and Im afraid he cant hold outmuch longerThe captain turned from the wheelfor a moment and glanced lazily towardthe dog bravely paddling away for hislifeOh hell get along well enough Hellsoon give up and go back I cant stopfor a dogMurmurs of indignation were heardon every hand Jacks face bore a lookof the most complete surprise at thediscovery that the captain could possibly refuse to stop for Maxs sake Thesympathetic tears in Priscillas eyesturned to glittering evidences of deepindignation as she stamped her footand seemed about to speak ButTowleswords came firstI dont ask you to stop for the sakeof the dog said he to the captain Tilmake it well worth your while to slowdown a bitYes indeed chimed in a young fellow who had been growing particularly interested in the situation Besides he went on raising his voice sothat the captain could not fail to hearit makes no difference except to yourpassengers if -we get in a few minuteslate and if we dont care why shouldyouThats whats the matter cameloudly from the little crowd that wasnow facing the pilot house This uprising of the whole ships company wasmore than the captain could quietly endureLeaving the wheel to his mate hestepped out on the hurricane deck andlooking down upon the passengers hishands in his pockets and determinationin his e3re blurted outYou may as well understand me nowas ever I am captain of this boat andI know how to run her Ive no time toTHE

in accord with thepassengers had the engines reversedJacks father was astounded at theturn of affairsDid you ever dream of suchafoolishact he exclaimed The child actuallytook up my words and leaped overboardto save the dogSo impressed was he with the noblefolly of the girl that had it not beenfor Jack he would certainly have madeone of the boats crew But Towle forestalled him Yet after all the girl didnot appear to need much help Whenshe rose after her plunge into the watersho turned her face toward the dog andstruck out as if she had been a veritablewater nymph The sailor was soonclose behind herDont tire yourself out miss hecried Lie on your back and floatTheyll soon pick us all up nowBut the girl swam on Her bath hadcompletely dispelled the momentaryfrenzy of excitement that had impelledher to jump She felt nothing but chagrin now She did not want to look anybody in the face and there was not onlythe sailor close behind but a boat loadof others were coming She wished thatshe dared to go on with the part anddive down to the bottom of the seaThe sailors breathing sounded awfully near and the click of the oarlocks told how near tfye boat was alsoEven Max who -now was hardly able toswim a stroke and who seemed to recognize in all this excitement somethingwhich might accrue to his benefitseemed to her to be laughing at herpredicament She was beginning tothink she had better drown herselfthan to face all the mortification thatseemed to threaten when she suddenlystopped swimming and disappearedThe sailor reached the spot where thegirl had gone down just in time to seoher black hair gleaming- at the surfaceagain Placing one arm under her bodyhe supported it as best he might untilthe boat came up Towle was im thebow terribly frightened to see the girllying so still in the waterIs she dead he asked in a hoarsewhisperOh no said some one Shell sooncome to Theres too much color therefor a bad faintThey lifted her in and laid her carefully in the thwarts a pea jacket underher with Towles coat for a pillow-HED STOP QUICK ENOUGH IP THERE WERE A MAN OVERBOARDstop for dogs and I wont stop andyou can make the most of itThe girl looking prettier than everstood erect as an arrow her handsclutching the folds of her blue flannelyachting dress every nerve tinglingwith indignation The captain retiredamid a chorus of groans and hissesAll eyes turned again toward thewater Max was evidently b ecoming exhausted the pace was telling on himHis red tongue now and again showedclear against the background of hisblack head as he gulped in the air andonce Jack thought he heard a faintyelp The father had all he could do torestrain the bo3rs excitementTowle was so angry that he couldscarcely speak He hardly dared looktoward Max Bfe could almost fancythe look of mingled questions and reproach that must be in the dogs eyesWhat does it all mean Why must Iswim so far I thought you wanted meto come to you I am doing my bestYes poor fellow said Towle as ifin answer to these unspoken queries ifyou were a man now instead of a dogthat brute of a captain miiit deign tolose a moment or so of his valuabletimeIm not so sure of that remarkedthe 3royng man who had participated inthe vain effort to persuade the captainTheres very little of the milk of human kindness in that fellow I fancyPossibly said Jacks father butthe law would bring him to terms insuch a case Hed stop quick enoughif there was a man overboardScarcely were the words spoken before theyAvere echoed back from thelower deckMan overboard was the cry indeedSo suddenly it came that it almostseemed like a trick to bring the captainto terms In the confusion of the moment the reality appeared strangely unreal Eveiu little Jack was at firstscarcely able to understand when hemanaged to cry outThere she is Dont let her drowntooNo one but Jack had noticed howsomething his father said seemed to addto the excitement of the pretty girl byhis side and in his terror for the fate ofpoor Max he hardly realized what shewas doing when she put one foot up on Jthe rail and vaulted over the sideIt was all done in an instant she wasin the water before three persons knewthat she had disappeared Towle hadDont forget the dog said a sailorThats so said Towle coming backfrom the realm of fancy into which hefound himself drifting Pick up thepoor beast and you shant lose by itboysAnd so Max in full worse plight thanthe girl herself seemed to be was hauledin and placed beside herEverybody on the steamer crowded jto the side to catch a glimpse of theheroine of the hour The stewardessknelt down beside the drenched figureas soon as it was brought on deck andofficially announced that the girl wasonly in a faint The crUfcvd was presently induced to stand back and finallyMax with Jacks arms around his neckbecame the temporary center of attraction while the stewardess had the girlcarried down into her cabinThe burden bearers had scarcely disappeared up the companion way whenthe girl jumped from he sofa on whichthey had placed her and falling onher knees in front of the startled stewardess cried outYoull never tell anybody will youI didnt faint at all I just couldnt lookanybody in the face and I didnt I believe I should have died if they had suspected that I was shamming And thepoor girl burst into tersMeanwhile the boat passed throughHell Gate and presently neared thepier The stewardess kept the girl below until all the other passengers haddisembarked Towle waited in vain forher reappearance In answer to his inquiry he was told that the young ladyhad quite recovered but must not bedisturbed Nobody found out whoshe was Whether Towle was more fortunate subsequently pertains not to thisstoryEven Jack and Mack had to go ashorewithout so much as saying good by toPriscilla

iacommitted in this state by men 29 yearsold This is not only true of the lesserbut also of the greater crimes althougha man is presumed to be at that periodof his life not only in zenith of hisphysical but also in full and completepossession of his mental powers with acomplete appreciation of right andwrong and their respective consequences This condition is a problemwhich has not been solved by the student of criminology and one which ismade the more complex by the factthat the ages of 21 27 and 45 years nearly equal it with the intervening yearsshowing a far less percentage of crimeIt is indeed peculiar that the criminaltendency should be so strong at 29 withno such inclination so far as criminalstatistics show in as great a degree forthe succeeding 16 years and then another outburst of the animal in manThis condition is found to be true byactual figures and as all statisticalcomputations at which average condition are sought to be determined are arrived at this method so may thestudent of this subject as well as theinsurance magnate who bases his rateson the general average of losses in proportion to the risks taken and does sowith full safety employ it in solvingthe jroblem before himCharles KBaker chief clerk to Superintendent Lathrop has made this subject one of close study and will soonhave completed a table showing this tohe true He has already completed onerelative to murderers serving life sentences in the penal institutions and itsfigures bear out the general conclusionHe offers at this time no explanationfor this but hopes after he has exhausted the subject so far as thipresentation of figures is concernedto be able to set forth reasons whythese years should be productive of thimost crimeThe following figures show how oldthe various

exception to the rule He wasjtill contemplating a second slice ofcake when he received a hasty summonsito a case in Lavender courtThats just like him she growledin -monologue Hell never be richwhile

depravityperliaps sown in long generations pastearly developed in young Jack Afterrushing through various vicissitudes ofgambling and drink he devoted the remaining part of his sodden intellect tothe eriuaanal science of burglaryHis distracted brother for severalyears griecved for his saered trust asu tbing lost to him until one nightJack had appeared craving protectionfrom the law For the sake of his deadmother Paul had shielded the bojwho when the danger was over brokeJoose again and in the course of timehis dexterity earned him in the crimsnxl world the sobriquet of LightningSsurAt Lavender

the work I hate itBut it isnt compulsory he exclaimed Why do you Jo itBecause I must she said bitterlyPaul Mayland was not a rapid thinker and not until they had turned intothe street where she lived had he cometo some sort of t conclusion Perhapsshe was performing deeds of charity inexpiation of some trifling sin magnified by her tender conscienceYes he loved her She had guessedit lonr aero It was in that momentwhen he had once unconsciously revealed his secret that her work hadbecome suddenly hateful to herselfDont go in yet he said I wantto tell you something Let us walkback to the end of the streetI love you Hester I love you Hislow voice penetrated through the traffic of the street I am not a youngman but my feeling for you is deepand strong enough to last my lifetimeeven unto

pain blind to justice blindto his very love for herWell your victim is ready at yourhand he said bitterly to the trembling representative of Scotland YardOf course you will do your dutyHe walked from the room withouta backward glance For an instant sheremained thus spiritless and daredThen a gradual indignation worked itswav through her clouded brainWhat had she done to evoke contempt or forfeit happiness Born ofa detective father she had been carefully trained by the clever parent incertainintricacies of the profession andsince his death the work had been toher a means of livelihoodThe cheap clock on rthe mantelpiecestruck 11 and she raised her face atlast a wonderous pity looking out ofher burning eyes His seeming crueltyhad been but the outcome of fear forthe safety of his brotherWhen the dawn showed through thechinks of the blind she threw open thewindow and leaned out her face in thechilly breezeHester I have been waiting for youhoping against hope that you did notgo lasrt night

AdviceThere was once a western judge whowas never heard to use the pronounT outside of his own immediate family circle after his appointment to thebench At times his habit of referenceto himself lent an air of dignity to hisspeech at other times his listenersseemed to be decidedly more impressedwith the humorous side of his addressesthan with the subject matter thereofOne day a young man slightly under theinfluence of liquor was brought beforethe judge Young man said thejudge impressively when this courtwas about your age it sometimes indulged in drink in consequence ofwhich it nearly committed on one occasion the crime of murder upon oneof the coasts second cousins But thecourt sv the error of its ways reformed and in time was elected judgeas you now see This court howeverhas not the slightest doubt that if ithad not abandoned its youthful courseit would long since have been immuredeither behind prison bars or in itsgrave And it is therefore especiallyfit young mon that this

A W BulletiningsDWARF PEAR HEDGEIt In a Source of Proilt n WellViJs tczas aTiling of BeautyThere are numerous shrubs that aresuitable for making hedges about oneslawn whether one prefers evergreensor deciduous shrubs but the number islimited that can be used in hedgerowsthat are of both use and beauty Thebarberry is one of the latter thesebushes making a very graceful but notdensely leaved growth but the barberrys fruit is not desired in largequantities nor is it a desirable plantto have near wheat fields as it harborsone stage of the rust fungus of thewheatOn my place I am planting hedgerowsof dwarf pear trees using winter varieties of the fruit almost exclusivelySuch a hedgerow is of eourse hardlysuitable for the front of ones lawn butfor side rows and for use in the rear ofones house the dwarf pear is quite unobjectionable As for beauty wellanjrone who has seen a long- row ofthese little trees in full blossom will notsoon forget the sight They are veryattractive little trees also when infull leaf without the bloom as theyshould be kept well trimmed back tosecure good fruiting as well as a goodhedge It is surprising too what anamount of fruit one can thus raise uponeven a small place In my own case Iam running a pear hedge around a twoacre lot and am now using also somecross hedges in the rear of the build-It will take at least 300 trees toDWARF PEAR HEDGEcomplete the outside row As this willinterfere very little with the plantingof fruit trees over the whole interiorsurface of the two acres it will be seenthat on a given amount of ground onecan raise much more fruit Iby usingthis outside hedgerow method It ispossible to crowd the little trees in ahedgerow because they will be on theoutside and can thus have plenty of airand sunshine though very close in therow and though the row of dwarf peartrees may be quite close to the insidelarger fruit trees the latter are notcrowded by the former since they standup above them This sort of work isnot advisable on large commercial orchards but on the home acre in the village lot one wishes to make the mostof every foot of groundPlanting so many of these little peartrees Iselected winter sorts and chosethat king among pears the Anjou andthe scarcely less inferior LawrenceBoth these pears do finely on the quincestock and both are winter varietiesWith such fruit one can store in a coolcellar and unload upon the marketwhen the market is most in need of winter pears With fall fruit one is verynearly at the mercy of the market forhe cannot hold the fruit for any lengthof timeMy own trees are set about four feetapart In future plantings I shall increase the distance somewhat In setting the trees be careful to get the pointwhere the pear stock and quince rootjoin several inches below the surfaceand for the first winter at least givethe roots a mulch for protectionAmerican GardeningVaccine for Black Leg-The department of agriculturethrough its bureau of animal industryhas just prepared

a common observation that thoutrows of trees in established orchards are finer and more productivethan the trees in the interior plantation This superiority is all the moreconspicuous if the orchard is borderedby cultivated fields and it is fair toj presume the extr luxuriance is owingto the trees having a greater extent oiunoccupied soil for the ramification oitheir roots Something is also undoubtedly due to the greater spaceavailable for the expansion and spreadof the branches but it is in accordancewith all experience in the cultivation ofplants that a rotation of crops is absolutely essential toward securing thebest results of the fertility of the soilKeeping these facts in view it is suggested that an improvement upon thepresent method of planting orchardswould be gained by planting two rowaof trees from 18 to 25 or more feet apartdepending upon the nature of thetrees and alternating the plants in therows Then allow a space varying inextent from 300 feet to anjr greater distance before planting another seriesof rows and so increase the plantationas may be desired The interveningspaces between these double rows oftrees would be available for the cultivation of the ordinary crops of thefarm The roots of the trees would notonly participate in the benefits of cultivation but would have practicallyunlimited room for extension beforemeeting other roots of their kind Immediately under the trees and for a distance on each side of the rows as far asthe branches spread the surface couldbe kept in grass If not sown down immediately after planting which mightnot be desirable in all cases it shouldbe done after the trees attain a fruitbearing size or from five to seven yearsafter setting out The shelter whichwill be afforded to other crops by theseorchards will be found valuable as aprotection from winds as well as in forwarding early crops This method isparticularly applicable to apple andpear trees Dakota Field and FarmGOOD USE FOR WEEDSWlteii Properly
