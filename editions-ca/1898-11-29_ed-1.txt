whichSpain yields to the American demandswill occur on Monday It is understood here that the Americans haveproposed to the Spaniards a tariff foirevenue only in the Philippines Spainwanted special

from Madrid says that SenoiMontero Rios chairman of the Spanish peace commission has informedthe government that the Americans include possession of the Sooloopelago in their demandsThe Sooloo or Sulu Archipelagowhich the Americans are said to haveincluded in their demand on Spain liesbetween Borneo and Mindanao of thePhilippine group It would be of greatstrategic value in naval operationsand affords opportunities for guardingthe southern islands of the Philippinegroup that could not otherwise be hadParis Nov 2S The result of thepeace negotiations between Spain andthe United States will probably beknown Monday when the time limitof the ulimatum delivered by theAmericans expiresNegotiations have been carried onthrough written communications onthe part of both sides Senor Puos hasjnade

of a possibility of acessation of negotiations has alsobeen con vejed but it will be in vainThe prospects are that all of thecounter proposals will be answeredSaturday as the American commissioners have received further instructions from Washington covering the new points It isintimated that all of the proposals willbe rejected and that the Americanswill stick to their demands as formulated in the ultimatum of last MondayThe belief is general that the Spaplards will accept the situation with thebest grace possibleLondon Nov 2S The Madrid correspondent of the Standard saysThe cabinet has concluded that thewisestpolicy is to accept the Americanterms leaving to the Spanish commissioners f nil power to secure the bestpossible indemnity and to place on record if the American

hundredpaces or so and then sloped gentlydownward towards the junction of theSerre and the Oise Beyond rose thewalls of La Fere whose gray outlineslit up here and there by the flare of alamp or lire

floor of the deserted and halfruined hut wherein we were beguiling-the weariness of our picket dutybefore La Fere with a shake of our elbows and a few flagons of nine captured from Monsieur the King of Navarre as we in our folly called himstillI knew little of de Gomeron exceptthat he was of the Camargue and hadfollowed the fortunes of dAumale fromArques to Ivrv from Ivrv to the Exilein the Low Countries and that he helda commission from the duke as captain in his guards Of our personal relations it is enough to say that wehated each other and would havecrossed swords ere now but for theiron discipline maintained by de Bonea discipline the bouquet of which Ihad already scented having escaped bythe skin of my teeth after an affairwith de Connor who trod on my toe atthe generals levee and was runthrough the ribs at sunrise the nextmorningUp to the time this occurred I hadbeen attached to de Bones staff butafter the accident to de Connor wasbanished to the outposts thinking- anyself lucky to escape with thatAt any rate the outpost was undermy command Imagine therefore mydisgust when I found that de Gomeronhad been detached to examine into andreport upon my charge He did thismoreover in so offensive a manner thatI could barely restrain myself from parading-him on the stretch of turf behind the thorn hedge that fenced inthe inclosure to the hovelOur feelings towards each other being-as they were it would seem oddthat we should have diced and drunktogether but the situation was one oarmed peace and besides time hadto be killed as for the past week Mde Bethelois formerly as livety as acricket had kept himself close as a nunof Tort- Jloyal behind the walls of LaFere and affairs were jneiiablj dullI was certain hotrever that we shouldsoon break into open

theresultIt was at this moment that we heardthe quick challenge of the sentry outside the password as sharply answeredand the tramp of feetThe same idea flashed through bothour minds it must be th

Gomeron s eyes as he looked at herand she shrank back at the serg eantswords and action whilst the old manstrained at the cords that bound hiswrists till the lines of the blue veinsstood out on his forehead Madame wasunbound but her hood had fallen backloosening- in its fall a mass of chestnuthair and from this framework her eyesglanced from one to another of us halfin fear and half in

ControversyIn discussing the liability of the banksfor back taxes this important fact mustbe kept in mind what the highestcourt says is the law and remains thelaw as long as that decision standsWhen reversed a new law takes its placebut the new law dates only from thenew decision and cannot cover the timecovered by the first decisionThere have been two decisions of thebank tax case one in 1895 and the otherin 1897 Before the first decision threhad been since the adoption of the newconstitutionuo interpretation of the lawgoverning bank taxation and that lawwas in disputeThe dispute fint went into the courtsin 1893 and was decided by the Courtof Appeals in 1895 and that decisionstood as the law until reversed by thenew decisiou in April 1897 The decision of 1895 ending the litigation begun in 1893 held tht the banks mustpay tax as required by the Hewitt LawThis dtcisiou being the first judicialdetermination oi the law necessarilly related back to the beginning of the litigation of which the decision was an endanu declared what the law was notmerely trom the time the decision wasrendered but tor the entire time whichhad elapsed since the coutroveisy originatedA judicial interpretation fust obtaineddiffers from a second decision reversingthe first in this that the first decisionthe law having had no provious interpretation or in other words havingbeen judicially construed and declaredrelates back to the enactment of thelaw or to the beginning of the legaldispute concerning it and expounds ordeclares what the law is and has beenfrom the beginning of the dispute andstands also as the law for the future until the date of the decision reversing itThe new decision becomes the lawfrom the date of such decision Itseffect is entirely for the future It defines the law from that date on but doesnot relate bat k Why Because forthe years that are back the law wasalready fully defined and determined bythe first decision and the second decision instead of being strictly ajudicia1 determination or definition ofthe law is in effect and to all intentsand purposes the enactment of a newlaw and governs only from the date ofsuch enacticebtNow after the decision of 1S95

but when it was knownthat Aunt Bina had sacrificed her treasure it aroused a splendid rivalry whichbrought together just such stores aswere neededAll day the good work went on andat night the men weary of their enforced idleness packed barrels andboxes read to ship in the early morningAunt Bina reached her room againat twilight taking with her IleliyBarton You know Ive sent my quiltto the soldiers she said hesitatinglyYes they told me so 1 think itwas so generous of you Hetty replied in an absent minded way as shetwisted the plain gold ring on herfingerI had planned to give it to

wants to die she saidto the surgeon I can hardly persuadehim to eatProbably he does replied theweary eyed man He had a magnificent physique and such a fellow feelsthat he cannot face life maimed in thisfashion Ive often had such cases Ifyou can only get him past this firstshockThe busy man hurried away withoutfinishing his sentence but the nurseunderstoodA few nights later a lot of boxes arrived in response to the urgent call forhospital supplies and Johns nurseeagerly claimed some of their preciouscontents I need blankets in myward she said and oh here is abeauiiful quilt This will cheer mypoor boys like a bouquet of flowersThe nurse from Maine was one of thebest in the hospital ancl no one objected when she carried away the quiltand placed it gently over her favoritepatientPerhaps it will keep his eyes off theblank wall she said to herself with asighWhen the first morrJng light shone inthrough the long narrow windowsthe young soldier opened his eyes almost resenting the knowledge that hehad slept better than usual As helooked languidly to see if his nurse hadgiven him an extra blanket he sawthe new quilt and at the same momentwas conscious of a faint perfume ofrose leaves perceptible even in thatsickening atmosphereHe closed his eyes and saw the bushesunder the parlor window at homeladen with great red roses as they hadbeen the morning he left Eden Hehad sttrted out that morning with abud in his buttonhole and another between his lips decked for the sacrifice he thought with a spasm of bitternessWith his left hand he pulled the quiltnearer It was made of many

American war hadbeen particularly imxiressed by the excellence of the citizen soldiery of theUnited States and by the efficient aidwhich they rendered the regular troopsThis however was no surprise to mefor I have long been of the opinionthat even in the art of war the thousand aud one complications with whichthe old world is saddled are in no wiseindispensable and that although itmay n t be possible to improvise soldiers here should be little difficultyin making good soldiers out of free citizens In short we see that throughEurope through all phases of nationalexistence lias remained

a cafe could hardly do businessjvithout one Every main street during the latter part of the day has itsittle itinerant band of guitar and vioin players and the warm nights aremade pleasant to the strollers alongthe streets by the sound of stringed instruments which floats from behind thelatticed vine clad screen of private residencesNearly all of the airs are pitchedini minor key which even when intended to be joyous contains a plaint tothe Anglo Saxon fond of Sousas robust music To one who has traveledn Spanish lands the music of PuertoRico at first seems very familiar butthe ear is not long in discovering something novel in the accompaniment tothe melodyIt sounds at first like the rhythmicalshuffle of feet upon a sauded floor andone might suppose some expert clogliancer was nimbly stexping to themusic made by the violins and guitarsThe motion is almost too quick toocomplicated for this however and itIs the deftness of fingers and not offeet that produces itIt comes from the only musical instrument native to the West Indies theguira which word is ronouncedwith a soft roll and twistto the tongue only possible to the native The guira is a gourd varying insize in different instruments On theinverse curve of the gourd are cut holeslike those in the back of a violin Onthe other side of the gourd oppositethe holes is a series of deep scratchesThe player balances the gourd in hisleft hand holding it lightly that noneof the resonance may be lostWith the right hand he rapidly rubsthis roughened side of the gourd witha two tined teel fork In the handsni a novice this produces nothing buta harsh disagresole noise In thehands of a nature guira player a wonderful rhymic sound comes fromthis drVi vegetable shell a soundwhie in its place in the orchestrabecomes music and most certaingives splendid time and considerablerolume to the performanceThe players hand moves with lightning rapidity The steel fork at timesmakes long sweeps the whole lengthof the gourd and then again vibrateswith incredible swiftness over but aninch or two of its surface There seemsto be a xerfeet method in its phiingthough no musical record is before theplayer and it seems to be a mattermerely of his fancy and his ear as tohow his part shall harmonize with themelody of the stringed instrumentsThe guira is found in all the WstIndies but seems specially popular inPuerto liico The players generallymake their own instruments and apparently become attached to them foras poor as these strolling players arethey will hardly part with their guiraseven when offered ten times their realvalue They are distinctly a PuertoEican curio and strange as it mayseem Puerto Bico is probably movedestitute of tourists loot than anyforeign country known to the traveling American The tourist who cansecure a guira may congratulate himself for it will be hard to get and isthe very thing which can be carriedaway from the island as a souvenirwhich is distinctly native and peculiarKansas Citv

jewels of great price were notthe onty things bequeathed to herdaughters by the empress of AustriaShe left a fortune in a collection oflaces to the eldest that has alreadyproved a bone of contention betweenthe two ladies These laces it isclaimed by connoisseurs are pricelessand should never be trusted beyond thewalls of a museum Should they beseen however a fresh impetus mightbe given to the industry of lace making now in a languishing conditionThe queen of the Belgians was thefirst to sound the trumpet of alarmnbout this falling off in Flanders thecradle of the art of lace making Asthe legend runs it was Jacquelinecountess of Flanders who was deeplyin love with her noble husband thehandsome Henelick but who did notreturn this tender feeling with theardor it deserved He had even madeeyes at the countess maid Serena whofor the sole crime of being beautifulwas sent by her mistress to a darkand noisome place of concealment ina corner of the palace The room wherethe poor girl was confined opened ona small damp garden and there sheAvould sadly sit and mourn for her beloved the equerry Luitpold One dayher eyes filled with tears she prajredto the Virgin to come to her rescueby some miracle and then raising herheavy eyelids she beheld a million olwhite silky threads so tenuous and arranged in such wonderful patterns thatshe was lost in admiration before themBy and by she began to wish shecould imitate the lovely patterns ofgood Marys threads for evidently theyhad been placed there in answer to hersupplication At last after a month ofpatient and arduous toil and manyprayers she achieved a piece of gossamer cobweb like work that rivaledtne miraculous threads arrayed by herholy patron The lace was sen t to thecountess who shed tears of delight atthe sight of so much beauty The nextstep was to send for the captive andmarry her to the equerry bestowinga sum of money on the happy pairthat would have kept them in comfortever after but independently of thecountess they became rich for theyoung woman taught her art to sevendaughters from whom descended allthe Bruges lace makers This is asweet romance but from whom did thispious Serena receive the threads withwhich she imitated the heavenly cobwebs It has been suggested she unraveled her stockings and again thatshe plucked the golden hairs from herhead but why will folks be so dreadfully practical It is sufficient that thehand made lace of Flanders is the mostexquisite thing wrought by humanfingers and the fatal looms have almostdestroyed its art with their new industry It was the elegant Marie Antoinette who gave the first blow tolace making The splendid lace wornIn profusion at the courts of LouisXIV and XV was replaced by thegauzes and muslins of the queen andthough Empress Jossphine broughtback the fashion it has never been Thesame as then The looms have produced perfect too perfect imitationsnnd cheapened the marvelous labor olyears It is now proposed by the Belgian queen and some other sovereignladies to make a point of wearing onlyhand made lace ami binding themselves by solemn compact not to allowan inch of machine made lace on theirpetticoats and under linen

InventedDynamiteAlfred Nobel -the remarkable manwho invented dynamite is thus described by Henry De Mosenthal in theNinteenth centuryPhysically weak of a nervous highly strung and exceptionally sensitivedisposition he was endowed with astrong will unbounded energy andwonderful perseverance he feared nodanger and never 3ielded to adversityMany wotild have succumbed undersimilar circumstances but the succession of almost insurmountable difficulties the explosion of his factory causing a general scare and dread of thedeadl3 compound he was making theloss of his youngest brother to whombe was devotedly attached the consequent paralysis of his old father andhis mothers grief and anxiety couldnot deter him from pursuing his aimThe coexistence of impulsive daringand sensitive timidit3r was a strikingfeature in his character He frequently demonstrated the value and safetyof his explosives with his own handsalthough he was particularly susceptible to headaches caused by bringingnitrog3lcerin into contact with theskin They affected him so violentlythat he was often obliged to lie downon the ground in the mine or quarryin which he was experimenting Onone occasion when some dynamitecould not be removed from a large caskhe crept into it and dug the explosiveout with a knifeNEW METHOD OF POACHINGFish Are Killed by the Simple Firingof a Rifle Rnllet Intothe WaterIn England where the game and fishlaws are much more strictly observedthan in this country the poacher onforbidden waters who is too anxious toescape discovery to spend the time necessary to catching fish with a rod andline will drop a dynamite cartridgeinto a river hole and after exploding itwill scoop up a bagful of fish whichhave floated to the surface from theconcussion An Italian officer MajMichelini who has been investigatingthe qualities of bullet and rifles hasdiscovered that fish can be killed moreeasily than even by the dynamite cartridge The Italian rifle which is but256 inch in diameter proved very deficient in stopping power at the battleof Adowa Nevertheless at short rangesthe very high velocity of the bulletgives rise to a powerful explosive effect Maj Michelini one day fired oneof these g uns into the water at an angleof about 45 degrees A dead fish almost immediately rose to the surfaceOn examination no wound was discoverable in the body the death being dueentirely to the hydraulic shock arisingfrom the impact of the bullet with thewater This view was amply confirmedby further experiments and many fishwere lulled by the blow of the bulleton the water exactly as if by an explosion of a dynamite shell The effectsof the hjdraulic shocks seemed to besufficient to kill all fish within two feetto two feet six inches of the point oithe impactSensible GovernmentThe
