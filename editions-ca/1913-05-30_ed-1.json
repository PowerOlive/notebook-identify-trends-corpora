Chester" Park is Opened With Many
Amusements.
The ending of the street car strike
put Chester Park on its feet agairii
For nearly ten days the big amuse
ment part was practically lost, as far
cause of the strike, as the street
cars were as essential to the welfare
of Cheter Park as is an engine to a
motor boat.
Manager I. N. Martin lost no time
time to elapse in opening after the
car service had been resumed and
everything is now running along just
been no interruption. The crowds
which were kept away, first by the
cold weather, and then by the strike,
have at least found conditions suit
able to outdoor amusements and are
making the best of the opportunity.
Some special features have been in
corporated in the big free vaudeville
bill which .will be given next week
beginning Sunday afternoon. It is
headed Hy the four Juggling Jewells,
a quartette of very pretty girls, who
have worke d out a very novel act of
this kind. Others on the bill are
Dale and Doyle in a comedy singing
physical culture girls; Sam Barton
in a novelty pantomime bicycle act;
and Olive Carew, singing and danc
ing comedienne.
Freehand concerts, cabaret shows
at club house and free motion pic
tures are included as a part of the
regular daily, program. The bathing
beach is now open and it will be
found as delightful as ever. New ap
paratus will be added ahd many new
improvements have been made.
The swimming classes start June
1. The classes are made up from
time to time and it is possible for
anyone wishing to swim, either man
or woman, to join at any time. The
water in Chester's lake is the same as
that which comes out of the faucets
in the hoin the home and is brought
from the city at the same rate as is
paid by every other consumer. Spec
ial Decoration Day features will be
arranged by the management.
Americans Complain.
Several American cereal companies
are complaining because their product
is classified by the German customs
house authorities as "made by a spe
cial process." and as such is subject
to a high rate of duty.

MUCH TOBACCO HfeLD.
Almost Billion .and Haif Pounds in
Factory Warehouses.
"Tobbacco statistics, issued by the
Census Office Monday in accordance
with the provisions of the Cantrill law,
show that 43 per cent, of the unmanu
factured leaf tobacco held by manufac
turers and dealers on April 1, 1913,
was of Kentucky origin. The total
held in pounds, isl,359,252,597. On
October 1, 1912, the first date when
the report was made under the Can
trill law, the total held was 1,047,404,
560 pounds, of which 35 per cent, was
Kentucky tobacco.
When Mr. Cantrill and Senator
Bradley were passing the law through
Congress their argument for its exis
tence was that it would provide a
price-fixing guide for the tobacco
grower. The manufacturer had the
government crop report to tell him
the condition .of the tobacco crop,
they argued, and it was only fair to
have the Government issue a report
semi-annually on the number of
tobacco unmanufactured so that the
grower could set an idea how much
tobacco planting was needed and how
much to charge. This argument was
accepted and the law passed.
"The leaf tobacco reported on hand
April 1, 1913," according to the Cen
sus Office,"includes 825,350,781 pounds
for which the 'marked weight' (the
weight at the time it was placed in the
warehouse) is reported; and 533,901,
816 pounds for which the actual
weight is reported. The corresDond-
ing amounts included in the total held t
on October 1 last were 578,468,729 and
468,935,831 pounds respectively. Al
lowance should be made for shrinkage
on the amounts for which marked
weight was reported to ascertain the
exact weight."
The dealers from whom the statis
tics were recorded are those who man
ufactured more than 50,000 pounds of
tobacco, 250,000 cigars or 1,000,000
cigarettes, or those who had on ao
average more than 50,000 pounds of
leaf tobacco in stok at the nd of the
four quarters of the calendar years of
1911 and 1912. Also all the imported
leaf tobacco in the Government bond
ed ware houses on April 1 is listed.
