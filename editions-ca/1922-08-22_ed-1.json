At a conference in Winchester,
between attorneys of Re'ese Fox,
charged with complicity in the mur
der of Leon Renaker and County At
torney H. H. Moore, it was decided
to fix the date for the examining
trial Tuesday, when the common
wealth and the defense will have a
second conference. G. F. Wycoff,
who, with Colonel J. S. Winn is de
fending Fox, stated that the trial
would be held shortly after the con
ference Tuesday. County Judge R.
S. Scobee will probably be the ex
amining officer.
Fox was brought from his "bridal
suite" in the jail to the office of
Colonel Winn, his attorneys, Satur
day afternoon, where he and his
lawyers conferred the greater part
of the afternoon. Fox still sticks to
his story of not guilty.
Officials denied published reports
to the effect that the body of Leon
Renaker was disinterred Friday for
the purpose of determining whether
a piece of lead pipe, reported to have
been found, would fit into the
wounds on Renaker's head.
They asserted that no weapon had
been found, although it was pre
sumed the blunt instrument used by
the slayer was a piece of lead pipe.
A reward of $50 has been offered
for the finding of the weapon.

DEATHS
HANSON
Miss Sarah Hanson, 98 years
old, a former resident of Paris, be
lieved to have been Lexington's old
est resident, died Saturday morn
ing at St. Joseph's Hospital of the
effects of a fall she suffered several
weeks ago. Miss Hanson was a
member of distinguished families
who have taken prominent part in
Kentucky affairs for generations.
' She was the daughter of the Hon.
Samuel Hanson and Matilda Callo
way Hanson, and her mother was a
daughter of Col. Richard Calloway,
a pioneer among Kentucky lawyers.
Mr. Hanson served often in the
House and Senate in Kentucky and
was president pro tern of the Senate
when Governor James Clark died
and was succeeded by Lieutenant
Governor Charles A. Wickliffe. Mr.
Hanson then became acting lieuten
ant governor. Three sons, General
Roger Hanson, R. H. Hanson and
Colonel Charles Hanson, were law
yers at Paris. Samuel Hanson serv
ed in the Union Army and Col. Chas.
S. Hanson and Isaac Hanson served
in the Confederate Army during the
Civil War.
Funeral services were held at the
grave in the family lot in the Win
'chester Cemetery, Sunday afternoon
at 5 o'clock, the Rev. J. H. Mac
Neill officiating. The body was re
moved from the hospital to the home
of Mrs. W. R. Thomas, 472 East
Main street. Miss Hanson is sur
vived by two nephews, Charles and
R. H. Hanson; one niece, Mrs. W.
R. Thomas, and v a sister-in-law,
Mrs. C. W. Hanson.
POLITICAL CUSTOMS CHANGED
IN KENTUCKY.
Like everything else political cus
toms have changed in Kentucky and
demagogy has lost much of its cun
ning with the electorate. The dem
agogue that would try to "pull some
of the stuff" that made for votes in
other days would be laughed to
scorn and regarded as a fit subject
to be borecl for the simples.
A dozen years ago a candidate for
office hardly would have dared to
venture forth in quest of votes rid
ing in an automobile. Now even the
candidate for constable rides in a
machine on his electioneering trips.
It used to be the vote getting way
for a candidate when he started to
canvass a rural district, to go un
shaven and shabbily dressed osten
sibly to curry favor with the rural
voters, but now such a makeup
would make him ridiculous with the
same voters.
Then he kissed the babies and di-
lated on how they took after their
'mother and how she baked better
! biscuits than anyone else and so on.
'He knows better than to try that
now. About the only thing that the
old-time candidate did that some of
the dear "peepul" might stand for at
this day, would be a nip of the
"campaign" whisky he usually car
ried with him.
The erstwhile candidate had a
habit of running on the demerits of
his opponents instead of running
upon his own merits and usually he
got away with it. Now it is differ
ent and the least he has to say
about the shortcomings of the other
fellow the better. This is due to
more of a spirit of fair play and
sympathy for the underdog among
those who now do the voting. There
are tricks in all trades, but many ot
the old ones no longer work in Ken
tucky politics.
An optimist is a fellow who loan3
a guy $10 when said guy already
owes him $20.

PURCHASE OF WHISKAWAY HELP
TO KENTUCKY
The purchase of Whiskaway, win
ner of the f 50,000 added Kentucky
Special last spring, by C. W. Clark,
and the addition of Bo McMillan to
the T. J. Pendergast stable, will
mean much fpr Kentutucky racing
during the coming season. Whiska
way should prove easily the cham
pion of his age in the West, while it
will take a sharp youngster to trim
Bo McMillan. He won the Sanford
Memorial and came from far back
to turn the trick. Pendergast paid
only $12,000 for him, and he looks
like the prize buy of the year.
Trainer L. Cahn named him
for all the two-year-old stakes at the
three Kentucky tracks.
THE OLD COON DOG
X.ike the rest of the country, Ken
tucky in recent years has gone in
for fine dogs and many breeding
kennels are operated for the produc
tion of fashionable strains. The
breeding embraces practically the
entire range of the canine species
and the interest is sustained by
bench shows and field trials to de
termine the individual fine points.
In rural Kentucky, however, there
is a type of dog that seems secure
against any displacement "by the
iancy-breed species. This is a 'good
"coon" dog. Ordinarily a mongrel
with no claim to pedigree, the Veal
"coon" dog is a find that develops
the essential qualities of "treeing"
and strategy in combat witlr& its
game and wily prey. It mighty be
said that every dog has . its price,
but a, good "cooa" dog is pradkc&lly
s invaluable andrarelypart -with
