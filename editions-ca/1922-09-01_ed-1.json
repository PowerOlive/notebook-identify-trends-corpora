TOWLES BEDFORD
At St. Peter's Episcopal church,
in this city, Wednesday morning,
the rector, Rev. Walter S. Cain,
pronounced the ceremony which
united for MisS Ellen Adair Towles
and Dr. Mathew Hume Bedford,
both, of Paris. The wedding was
witnessed by members of the two
families, the only ones present for
the ceremony. After the wedding
