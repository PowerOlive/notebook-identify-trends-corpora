Never Complain Against Hello
"Hello Girl."
Although he has used the teephone
practicay ever sinte it has fceen in
vented Dr. Geo. H. Detwiler. pastor
of the West End Methodist, church
Chicago, said in a recent sermon that
he had never found cause for com
plaint against the telephone girl. Dr.
Detwiler delivered aa sermon upon
"Courtesy," and severely criticized
some people on their conduct. He re
ferred" to a church member who had
sDoken in suchmanner to a street car
conducter that he was compelled to
make an apology to the company. He
showed now it pays to be courteous
on trains, in hotels and other places.
On several occasions he showed how
by standing aside quietly when there
was a scramble and confusion he had
secured the best room in a hotel tand a
lower berth in a Pullman car, while
others in a scramble ahead ot him lost
out.
Dr. Detwiler showed how courtesy is
a big factor in practical religion. He
adm tted'.that there are provocations
and sometimes things don't work ex
actly right. In using the telephone
whenihis occurs he thinks of how the
operator has been at her post since 7
o'clock in the morning and has been
persecuted by many others, and he is
willing to hold his peace. Dr. Det
wiler said there is probably nothing
more harmful to the church short of
downright viciousness than lack of
kindly courteousness on the part of
those claiming to be'deciples of Christ'.
Paris Agein Dawns the Orphans.
At White Park yesterday afternoon
the Bourbonites, for the second time
this week, took into camp the lowly
Orphansby a score of 4 to 1, and
moved above the Richmond team in
the percentage.
Dunian was on the mound for the lo
cals and kept them well in hand
throughout the contest. Only in one
inning did he allow :he visitors to
bunch hits and this was responsible
for the only run secured bv the cellar
champs..
Errors were responsible for two of
the runs secured by the Paris team,
but timely hitting netted the remain
der. Dunlap was wild at stages, but
was successful in securing control and
very effective- in pinches.
The Bourbonites put un a splendid
game, not an error being registered
agajnst them throughout the contest.
The fielding of Locke was a feature.
Richmond'losing to Frankfort yes
terday af ternoonlput Paris a few points
to the good in fourth position, with
Lexington within hailing distance in
the advance. There is a oossibility
that Paris may close the season in the
first division and with this object m
view, the services of another pitcher
have been secured and he will report
to the local club at Maysville.
Today Pans will go to the river town
for a series of thiee games and will
make an effort to come out with the
long end. This series will nrobably
determine the result in the finish and
the locals are determined to trounce
the Rivermen in at least two of the
games. .
TUESDAY.
In the double header with the Pi
oneers at Richmond Tuesday, Paris
won the first by a score of 3 to 1 and
the'second 10 to 5 . Apulegate was on
the rubber for Paris in the first exhi
bition and Dunlap, who was driven
from the rubber in the game Monday
came back and held the visitors to six
hits. The five runs made by the Pio
neers came in thefirstj two innings.
WEDNESDAY.
Paris'easily defeated the Orphans in
Mt. Sterling , Wednesday afternoon,
winning by a'score of 11 to 1. Hausei,
who pitched for Paris was never in
danger of defeat, as his teammates
were hitting well behind him while
his effectiveness kept the Orphan bat
ters guessing throughout the game.

Girls Take the Lead.
Judging by the facts, women art
pretty fully In possession of formal
education. If we examine this monop
oly a little more carefully we shall
find that while in the kindergarten
and in the elementary schools boys
furnish 51 per cent of the enrollment,
simply because more boys are born in
civilized communities than girls, at
soon as we reach the high schools
girls increasingly take the lead.
Fined For Selling Lipuor.
At Carlisle, Lweis Ishmaelwas fined

The wheat croD in Bourbon county
this year is reported as averaging up
well, and, as a rule, it is of good qual
ity. The gram is being eagerly soughs
after by the dealers and the prevailing
price is $1 ner bushel although several
small sales have been made at $1.03
and $1.05 per bushel. The prices be
ing paid for wheat in Paris has been
unaffected by the slump in Chicago,
which is attributed to the fact that
most of our grain is used for local con
sumption. The Winchester Democrat saya:
"Peaches that weigh 14 oz. are noth,
ing for this section, for Mr. Winn, the
furniture man, is displaying some in
his store, which grew at bis home on
Main street. He has a big'crop on two
trees and they are nerfect in shape.
Mr.fcWinn does not know the variety,
but the seedling was given to him by
Mr. Hood Smith. This proves that
you don't have to go to the" far west to
raise fruit. , If you'll work in Kentucky
the weather and soil will do the rest.
Get busy."
Bath county farmers have'signed a
call for a conferenca oftobacco grow

for the purpose of inaugurating a
movement inthe Burley toDacco dis
trict to secure a paving price for the
1912 crop of tobacco, according to a
dispatch from Owingsville. Thi?
movement is believed to be inspired
by the Farmers' Union sentiment,
which is known to be strong in that
section of the State, where the Union
ha3 a co-operative store and large
membeiship.
CARLISLE COURT The Mer
cury says : "There was a big crowd
in Carlisle Monday and considerable
stock changed hands. The greatest
interest centered in the weanling mule
market and something like fifty or
seveutv-five were sold at Drices rang
ing from $50 to $125. H. N. Rankin
was the largest buyer, he having se
cured forty head. Medium cattle sold
at from 4l-2 to 5 1-2 cents. Hogs at
6 1-2 to .7 1-2 cents. Quite a number
of sheep offered and a few sold at Jfair
prices. The traders on the streets
were quite active during the day, but
were cautious in huying.
Heavy rains in portions of Nicholas
county have caused considerable dam
age to land. In some places land pre
pared for alfalfa has been literallv
washed to pieces, while tobacco and
corn land has been greatly damaged.
The rain, extending over most of the
county, has been of great value to
growing crops, the condition of which
on the average greatly is improved.
The tobacco in sections is short, but
with a favorable season will grow out.
In some parts of the county, where it
has been dry, the corn is vry'DOor and
will not make half a crop. Whern it
has been seasonable the corn crop will
be about an aevrage.
The House Tuesday afternoon
passed the wool bill over President
Tatt's veto. One hundred and seventy
fuor members voted yea, eighty
voted nay, and ten "present". Nine
teen Republicans voted with the Dem
ocrats to pass the bill over the veto.
Speaker Clark set the Demociats wild
by ruling that ten members who voted
"present" were not to oe counted in
the final vote, and hat Democrats had
theretore carried the bill over the Pres
ident's head. By eliminating the ter
membars who voted "present" the to
tal number on the floor wa s reduceJ
from 264 to 254, and 174 yeas consti

That Kentucky farmers actualij
lost $3.50 on every acre of wheat thT
raised this year was the declaration
made by J. W. Newman, Comm.
sioner ot Argiculture, in a statemt' z
to the Educational Committee of tne
Louisville Commercial Club. Com
missioner Newman has completed his
crop reDorl which shows that the av
erage yield of wheat per acre in the
btate for 1912 was 9.3 bushels, while
governments reports show tpn bushels,
the two being very close. Either fig
ure he said.would mean a loss ot more
than $3 an acre for wheat raised in
Kentucky in 1912 . Lack of agricul
tural knowledge he held responsible
fcr this poor showing.
