MINA EABER,Anrora, 111.A short time ago I was one of themost nervous and miserable personson the earth, but thanks to TanlacI'm well and happy ,now," said Mrs.Mina Raber, 446 Farnsworth Ave.,Aurora, 111."It was just about two years agothat L began to-be distressed ?afterevery meal. I had awful smotheringspells at times and my heart beat soirregularly that I often thought Iwouldn,t' live,. through - the attack.Headaches yere te bane of my existence and I shudder even now whenI think of them. My back hurt me,too, and it was just agony for me tobend over and straighten up again."Tanlac had done for me far morethan I ever expected and I'm like adifferent person altogether. In fact,I'm in perfect health now. In myopinion, Tanlac is the best medicineunder the sun."Tanlac is sold at Roche's DrugStore.The farmers in the KentuckyGeneral Assembly are determinedthat something be done to relievethe farmers of the State of the burdens of taxation. It was as move inthis direction that RepresentativeIra D. Smith, of Hopkinsville, introduced a resolution in the Houseasking the State Tax Commission forcomparative figures between 1917and 1921.Not only are plans being workedout for the relief of the taxationsituation on farms but blocs alreadyare being formed with a view tofurthering legislation in which certain sections of the State are interested. The first open bloc of the kirid hasbeen formed by the nine members ofthe house from the first Congressional District. While presumablyfor the purpose of pushing a bill torepeal the section of the 1920school law making County Superintendents appointive instead of elective, members from the district saythat it will remain operativethroughout the session in gettinglegislation of value to the first district.The Central Kentucky members ofthe Legislature are among the mostf determined in the matter of findingmeans of aiding the farmers. An indication of the attitude vof thesemen on the matter is seen in thestatement of former Speaker H. C.Duffy, of Cynthiana, that "something must be done to relieve thefarmer," and to help those who already have not lost all their lifeearnings retain what they have.The passage of the Bingham Cooperative Marketing act "by the .Senate without a dissenting vote" wasthe first move toward the plan for"aiding the farmer," but it is freelypredicted that with forty-threefarmers in the House and about thesame percentage in the Senate, thisis only a beginning of the work forthe farmer..vi. y 'r-."v-t Jud TunkincJud Tunkins says he doesn't care tovery much for the sunny smile that &man puts on. the .same as he does ahigh hat, merely because it suits theoccasion.Machine Skins Animals.A motor-driven knife has been Invented for skinn'nr animals.or your money backPositively Contains no AspiriaFoe Sale at'all Drug Scon30 Tablets ' 25c(till-25mar) 'DnWaddctl'sI Pile RemedyDon't Suffer Don't be Operatedjm. until you have tried Dr. Waddcll'sFfle Remedy.
