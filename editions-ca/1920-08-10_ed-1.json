is a most charming and attractive
young woman, one whose lovely
traits of character have endeared
her to a host of friends. She has
been for several years private sec

where she was highly esteemed for
her social and business qualities.

Many years ago, even in Paris, as
we have, noted merchants and clerks
would sometimes get very jmad
if prospective customers and snop
pers didn't buy. But the modern
merchant has long ago gotten away
from that disagreeable trait. If they
can't sell an article, they are anx
ious to be particularly pome, o
that the customer will at least leave
l-lie store with a good feeling and a
disposition to come again.
It would be a hard jnratter, accord
ing to our view, to find a city or
want any customer to feel that ne
or she must make a purchase, If
they are not satisfied with the gooas
and if the prices are not right.
