expected. Well, when I woke -up
train was standing in he station in
Marseilles, and the latter place- being
a hundred cso kilos past the place
where I was supposed to change for
Nimes, (the area I was assigned! to) ,
I decided to stay right on the train,
which went right through to the
Italian border, and see all the coun
try possible.
"About all they could do was to
send me back to Chagney or Nimes.
And had my leave been cancelled
when I arrived at Monaco, the point j
where I eventually unloaded, I would
have been well satisfied fwith what I
had done, because the beauty of the
trip more than made up 'for anything
I saw afterwards. The railroad skirts
the Mediterranean Sea after getting
out of Marseilles a ways, and let me
tell you, folks, it is just about the
most beautiful thing I've seen.
"Of course the sights of a tropical
country are new to me. There may
be places on' the globe that are more
beautiful, but this one -particularly
appealed to me. We passed groves
and groves of olive trees, and it was
quite a novel sight when getting near
Monaco to look out of the car wiib
dows and see people picking oranges
in their yards, then to glance ahead
and see the snow-capped Alps in
Italy. Nearly all the rocks that
jotted out from shore were orna
mented in 'some way. Sometimes,
with a stone railing, an odd building
or group of buildings. The build

only wish I could have had one more
day there, and done the town in day
light. "It was wonderful, anyway. All
the buildings are of white stone;
everything was so very clean:
"I particularly wanted to1 see the
Prince of Monaco's palace, the inte
rior of the Casino, and a big museum
of ocean life, but my time was too
limited. If I-m iiere long enough to
be entitled to another leave, I hope
to se more of Southern France.
"I got out of Monaco at 9:20pi m.

Nice and Marseilles, which I had in
tended to attempt to take in. Arriv
ed at Nimes about noon next day,
went to bed right after suppen. GUess
they'll keep me here for about ten
days at the hospital, but I hope to be
all right soon:

"For beauty, the trip was one
which I do not believe 111 ever forget.
Well, I arrived at Monaco about noon
and told the R. T. O. my troubles
about sleeping past my junction
point. They took up my pass, told
me to go up town, look around, and J
i that I'd have to leave town at nine
o'clock the same night. In order not
to miss any of the sights, I even pass
ed up 'eats,' expecting to take some
oranges or something on the run.
Went around to the Y,' washed up,
and by the way they have beautiful
quarters at Monaco. It was formerly
a Casino; don't know if that is a
theatre or erambline: house m that
part of the country, but for the
stage in one end of it, it resembled a
palace.
"My next move was totake on a
cog road about 2,000 feet up on a
mountain. For the short time I had,
I could not have made a more inter
esting trip. It gave me a complete
view of the principality of Monaco,
and of Monte Carlo, the surrounding
country and the sea. Likewise a
good view of the Italian coast and
the Alps in Italy. At the top of this
mountain, reached by the cog road,
was some old Roman ruins, the re
mains of a tower built 12 B. C. It
was almost dark when I came down
off the mountain, and I had a head
ache second to none, partly through
loss of sleep, but mostly I believe,
through lack of eating. Anyway, I
walked around Monte Carlo next.
Saw the famous Casino where the big
games are pulled off. The hours for
American soldiers to go sight seeing
through the gambling rooms are
from 8:30 a.em. till 9:00 a. m., so I
lost out on tliat.
