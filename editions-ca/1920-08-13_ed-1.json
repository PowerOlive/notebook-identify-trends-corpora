Jacobs, of Danville, Centre College

collection of picture, books and doc

Another feature of the collection

as fallows:
"To Jabez Huntington, Esq., of
Windham, Connecticut:
"Sir At the urgent requfst of
several of the Selectmen and re
spectable inhabitants of the town,
of Hudson, I hereby authorize you
to discharge from custody James
Keating, now prisoner and confined
by military warrant in the goal of
P. county.

11, 1781."
There are pictures of the Alham
bra and other historic pictures of
rare worth. All of these gfts are in
a splendid state of preservation.
ANOTHEE GOOD MISSING- TEETH
STORY.
Probably the most unique acci
dent ever occurred in Franklin
county occurred when J. L. Phillips
of Shelbyville, lost his teeth. How
he came to lose them -he does not
know. Whether he had them in his
pocket or lost thepi out of his
mouth he is unable to say. He did
not miss them until he went to eat
supper, and the last thing- he could
recall about his teeth was that lw
had Ihem in-his mouth when he ate
dinner.
o
CATERPILLERS ATTACKING
TREES.
Since the rcent heavy rains, cat
erpillers in increasing numbers
have made their appearance in
trees on many Paris lawns. The
residents of many sections of the
city report thiV pests as attacking
the trees with considerable vigor.
One housekeeper reported , that
trees on the lawn at her home have
become infestr.d with the caterpillers
and that, as a result of their attack,
the leaves are beginning to curl up.
It is feared that there will be an
invasion of these pests, tending to
disfigure it not entirely destroy
foliage on handsome shade trees on
lawns.
o
DON'T USE MUFFLERS
There has been considerable com
ment about the noises made by the
big motor trucks employed by the
city and county, and by others in
hauling material through the
streets of Paris. Many have won
dered why the drivers do not close
the mufflers. That matter is best
settled by the drivers ' themsevest
vho will very quickly infonrn you,
should you ask, that the tiucks are
not provided with mufflers. There
fore we mortals must in course or'
ihne, try to get accustomed to the
nerve-racking noises they make.

BLUEGRASS.
The arctic region, according to a
unique theory tentatively advanced
by Yilhamur Stefansson, noted ex
plorer, is the original home of the
bluegrass tha has jmade Kentucky
famous and the Bluegrass region of
that Southern Commonwealth may
have evolved from seed first cropped
from an iceberg drifting down from
the North in the glacial epoch.
Stefansson, while on a visit to his
mother in Winnipeg, Manitoba, de
plored the general ignorance re
garding the Far North and said
school geographies and textbooks
which give children false ideas of
the region should be rewritten.
"There are 640 species of flower
ing plants in Arctic Canada," said
Mr. Stefansson, "and three times as
many non-flowering species. The
land, that is popularly supposed to
be a frozen desert, is in summer one
great flower garden, gorgeous with
golden rod, poppies, bluebells, dan
delions, watercress, tiimothy, and
bluegiass as deep and lush as that
in the thoroughbred pastures of
Kentucky. If one were inclined to

NYE
THE HYDROPHONE
All danger from heavy fogs which
have been the terror of seamen in
all ages is ended it is believed by
the invention of the hydrophone.
In a series of tests made with ships
of the navy it has been found that
signals may now be sent under water
for more than forty miles. It is not
only possible for a ship equipped
with the new device to tell its exact
distance from land, but the presence
of other ships (may be detected in
plenty of time to avoid collision,
and even the depth of the water
may be measured. The apparatus
consists of a tank placed on the keel
of the ship, about three feet deep
and twenty feet long, which is fill
ed with water. A sensitive re
cording device picks up the vibra
tions sent under the sea. This is in
turn connected with a device, call
ed the compensator, on the ship's
bridge which indicates the direction
in which the sound travels. A sub-
! marine recently made a long trip
under water guided past all danger
ous points and kept in the proper
channel entirely by means of the
hydrophone.
