Warehousemen were in touch Sunday with the growers throughout thecounty and learned that the tobaccowas in case, and that the tobaccothaf had already been stripped wras being loaded for the market, and thatthe unstripped tobacco was beingbulked down for immediate preparation for the market, which opens atthe local house 'on next Saturday, December 5.Sunday, usually a day of rest on thefarm, wras turned into a day of activity, and every available man whocould be persuaded, coaxed or cajoledto forego his regular vacation fromfarm work, was pressed into serviceand went to work getting the weed inshape for market. The rains were aswelcome as they are in the summerseason drouths, when the growingcrops are suffering for moisture.Reports to the management of theBourbon Tobacco Warehouse statethat there has been less houseburn intobacco this season than was predicted some time ago, while the percent,of green and frozen tobacco is lessthan for several years.Prices for tobacco which severalweeks ago looked discouraging, arenow much improved, the Louisvillemarket reporting an average on tenhogsheads of over nine cents perpound.The opening of the Bourbon countymarket next Saturday will no doubtbe attended by farmers and tobaccogrowers from a number of adjoiningcounties, as well as by those fromthis county The Paris market lastseason wras accounted one of thestrongest in the Blue Grass section,and compared very favorably with themarkets at much larger centers oftrade.The clerical force that will assist inreceiving and liandling the local tradehas been made up, but not yet givenout for publication. The auctionsales will be held by Auctioneer Oliver Clay, who conducted them so successfully last season.With the rigid quarantine recentlyplaced on livestock shipments in orfrom this county, with the resultantloss of revenue to the livestock dealers of the county, it looks as if thetobacco sales will have to play thepart of "saving grace" to the farmersof Bourbon county.The Bourbon Tobacco Warehousewas opened to-day for the reception oftobacco, and several crops were received and stored.

The suggestion, which was firstbroached by Mr. L. A. Soper, Superintendent of the Sunday school, metwith an immediate and eager responsefrom all the members of the church,and the sum of 50 was promised,which will likely be doubled. Thismoney will be spent among the merchants of Little Rock, for shoes, hoodsand clothing of various descriptions.The goods when ready for deliverywill be packed and brought to Pans,where it will be taken in charge bythe Relief Committee and sent to Lexington, from where it will go to theEast as part of the big donation to besent from there to the sufferers.A committee composed of Mrs. Edsell Clarke, B. F. Hopkins and Be v.Carl Agee was appointed to takecharge of the fund and to attend toits proper distribution.This is said to be the first instanceon record in the present campaignwhere a whole school has taken suchan action, and it is likely to prove themeans of inciting others to a similaraction in so praiseworthy a cause."

"Madam,"said Johnson, "it all depends uponthe weight of the boy. My schoolfellow, David Garrick, a little fellow,robbed a dozen orchards with impunity. But the first time I climbed a-tree I was always a heavy boy thebough broke with me; and it wascalled a judgment.

Ifin his opinion the price offered is notwhat he considers a fair and just one,he has the privilege of rejecting it atthe close of the sale.
