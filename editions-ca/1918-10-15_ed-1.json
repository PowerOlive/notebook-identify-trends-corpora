J TURNBY.
, Mr. Amos. Tiirney, aged ahout
seventy-fie y.ears, one of the most
prominent" members of the racing fra
ternity and one of Bourbon county's
most' prominent farmers, was found
fdead in 'a fieljl near .his home on the
Maysville pike, Sunday morning, by
his niece. Miss litav Colville. who had
gone in search 6f fii,m.
mt. rurney, wno naq. oeen appar
ently in the very best of health, left
his home earlyin the morning to in
spect some work that had been fin
ished the day previously, and told
the family that he would be back in
a very few minutes. His prolonged
absence led to the suspicion that
something was 'wrong, and Miss Col
ville went to the field to investigate.
She found Mr. Turney's horse wan
dering aimlessly around the field, and
upon further investigation, was hor
rified to find Mr. Turney lying prone
on the ground, where sudden death
had overtaken him in the midst of his
inspection work. From all appear
ances he had been dead about two
hours. The body was removed to the
home, where it was prepared for bur
ial. Mr. Turney, in connection with
his brother, Mr. Jesse Turney, had
for ,many years been engaged in
breeding and racing thoroughbreds
under the firm name of Turney Bros.
Their colors had been carried to vic
tory on many of the most prominent
tracks of the country. They had also
raced in Canada and in Cuba, where
their horses had been winners in
many a notable event. The firm of
Turney Bros., up to the time of their
retirement from the turf, about two
years ago, was probably the most not
ed in their line of any in the racing
world. Their winnings on the tracks
of America, Ganada, and Cuba were
very large. In their string were
such notable racers as Wafer Bass,
Cleburne, Flabbergast, Martin Doyle,
Theo. Cook, Clell Turney, Horron,
Dr..tCatlett7'Newah, Dr. Eichberg, and
,many others, . '
Mr. Turney is survived by his
widow, who was formerly Miss Xiiz
zie, Manning;' of Mason county; two
daughters, Mrs. . Ezekiel Arnold, of
Covington, and Mrs. Louis Taylor, of
Paris, who has been- very ill in New
York, and .one brother, Mr. Jesse
T.urnjey,- of. Paris. During the past
few, years thfcee brothers and one
lister of Mr. turney have passed to
the other land, Capt. Dan Turney, a
Confederate veteran, and former pro
prietor of the Bourbon House, in its
days one of the most notable hotels
in this section; Matt Turney, for sev
eral terms Judge of the Bourbon
County Court; Henry Turney, at one
time also proprietor of the Bourbon
House and ' a well-known business
man afterwards in other lines, and
Mrs. John Current.
Last Thursday Mr. and Mrs. Tur
ney celebrated their forty-seventh
wedding anniversary at their home.
They were the recipients of many
handsome presents and congratula
tions. -The most highly-prized one
was a telegram from their daughter,
Mrs. Louis Taylor,, who was ill in
New York, stating that she was im
proving. Her physician upon hear
ing of Mr. Turney's death, advised
her, in view of her illness, not to at
tempt making the journey back to
Paris.

GATHER NUT SHELLS AND SAVE
A LIFE.
Now that the schools of Paris and
the county are closed during the in
fluenza prevalent to a limited extent,
the school children of Bo'irbon county
are urged to render a patriotic duty
to their country that will be both
a pleasure to them and of inestima
ble service to the boys in France'
To combat the use of "gas" y the
enemy, masks must be used by our
soldiers to filter the gas out of the
air and give the soldier the oxygen
that is necessary to sustain life. The
only satisfactory filler for tthese
masks is charcoal made from the
shells and seeds or stones of nuts and
fruits. Bourbon county is fortunate
at this time to have an abundance of
walnuts and hickory nuts, the shells
of which are ideal material for the
masks
i" It -is these that the children are
urged to gather. They will lay up
the broken sliells to dry thoroughly,
and when the sap is out of them
bring themHo the Red Cross room in
Paris, to be forwarded to, the proper
nlace.
County School Superintendent J.
B. Caywood has offered a flag as a
premium to the pupil gathering the
largest number of peach seeds, prune,
cherry, apricot, plum and olive pits,
Brazil, walnut, hickory nut and
butternut shells. The public schools
of the county are now closed, and the
pupils can begin the work now and
later when the schools open turn in
their collections. Supt. Caywood
wants to collect as much as a carload
and appeals to every school boy and
girl to evidence their patriotism by
helping the Government in this mat
ter. " " .

TOYLESS CHRISTMAS LIKELY EOR
LOCAL CHILDREN.
The Kentucky Council of National
Defense campaign to educate the
public in the matter of Christmas
buying this year took on a State-wide
aspect when instructions for extend
ing the movement were issued to the
120 chairmen of County Councils of
Defense throughout Kentucky. The
instructions deal with the problem as
concerning the public, and also from
the standpoint of co-operation with
the merchants.
The outstanding feature of the
campaign is that it is intended spe
cifically to eradicate the custom of
giving toys to children. Useful pres
ents for all, persons is to be tne aim
of the movement. Early buyingnd
early selling,, designed to eliminate
the necessity of increasing sales and
delivery forces,' is urged in view of
the wartime scarcity of labor for pur
poses which are not strictly war-es-,
