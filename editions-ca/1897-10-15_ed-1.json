There is no reason forbeing despondent
nd considering diseases of the blood
Incurable simply because the treatment
of physicians and many so called blood
xemedies fail to effect a cure Though
it is naturally disheartening to the suf
ferer who faithfully takes the prescribed
-treatment of the physicians often at the
-expense of hundreds of dollars to find
liimselfj no better as time goes
by still a cure will result from the right
remedy SSS no matter what other
treatment has failed
The reason that SSS Swifts Spe
cific has so successfully cured even the
worst cases after other treatment had
been tried in vain is that it is the only
remedy which forces the poison from
the llood and permanently eliminates
at from the system which is the only
correct principle of curing the disease
Mercurial remedies bottle up the poison
and tear down the system while SSS
forces out the poison and builds up and
adds strength and vigor to the entire
system It is natures remedy and con
tains no harmful ingredient
Mr Charles Glenn of 1563 Dudley St
Cincinnati is one of the many who
constantly praise S SS for giving him
laack his health He says
From childhood I was afflicted with
a terrible blood disease and have
taken almost every blood remedy on the
market but my case was deepseated
and one by one they failed The large
red blotches increased in size and num
ber and soon covered my entire body
My parents had me treated by a num
ber of physicians but the disease was
too much for them and after their tem
porary relief was over I found myself
growing steadily worse Thus I grew
into manhood handicapped by a terrible
disease and having tried so many reme
dies without relief when a friend urged
jne to take SS S I had little faith in any
medicine I was happy to find however
that I had at last gotten the right remedy
for one bottle of SSS did me so much
good that I soon had hopes of being cured
I continued the remedy and was cured
completely the unsightly spots soon
disappeared leaving my skin perfectly
clear My general health was also built
up and I am robust and strong I be
lieve SSS will cure the worst case of
lalood poison in the world
SSS is a real blood remedy and will
cure the most obstinate cases of Cancer
Eczema Catarrh Scrofula Rheumatism
Contagious Blood Poison old sores
r any disease caused by impure blood
It is
Purely Vegetable
and is the only blood remedy guaranteed
to contain not a particle of mercury
potash arsenic or other mineral SSS
is sold by all druggists

Some Plain Facts -
Grave errors injustice wrongs of
greater or less degree arise from lack
of knowledge of the truth and more
frequently from deception
The most infamous case on record
of deception and injustice is the at
tempt to demonetize silver as a money
of final redemption in the United
States
There is no learned judge skilled
lawyer or court of justice that is
capable of reconciling the effort with
the constitutional laws that govern
the issue of money in this country
The people have been deceived
officials in power chosen to adminis
ter justice under the laws have
ignored their sworn duty and given
aid to the scheme that has paralyzed
industry reduced -property values
one half and beggared millions
There isno authority of law either
specific or by inference by which
gold alone is made the only money
with which to discharge debts either
public or private The effort to
make it so is unconstitutional and a
national calamity
Plain and ample information facts
and truth concerning this almost suc
cessful scheme to corner the wealth
of the people is now being printed
in the Cincinnati Enquirer a news
paper which the combined power of
money has failed to muzzle or buy

BUTTERWORTHS THEORY
His Iienlent Way of Treating For Reforma
tion Embryo Criminals
Commissioner of Patents Butterworth
is one of the men who believe that a
prosecuting attorney is better engaged
in side tracking embryo criminals on
the road to perdition and getting them
on the road to righteousness than in
corralling them for shipment to the
penitentiary where they are thrown
into association with professional crooks
Several years ago Major Butterworth
was prosecuting attorney in southern
Ohio and he had the opportunity to test
his theory regarding the discrimination
that should be used in dealing with
men newly launched into crime A
young farmer was arrested for passing
counterfeit shinplasters as the 50 cent
note was known and the case was put
in the hands of Major Butterworth
The young man told his story He had
saved several hundred dollars had left
his wife and little children and Lad
taken a boat down the Mississippi river
purposing to settle on a new farm he
was to buy with his hard earned sav
ings On the boat he met an extremely
pleasant and well dressed stranger who
learned of his mission and proceeded to
make himself agreeable In a moment
of extreme confidence the stranger fold
the young man of a large quantity of
money he had which was made from
plates that had formerly belonged to the
government and which the government
had long since sought to recover etc
The young man was struck by that re
markable method of acquiring wealth
when he had toiled and saved for years
to get his few hundred In a burst of
generosity the stranger offered to ex
change some of his money for green
backs belonging to his new found
friend so that the latter should have
two dollars for every one he possessed
The bait was tempting and the fish bit
At the next landing the well dressed
man disappeared from the boat and the
dupe became alarmed He became sus
picious of his new money and was
afraid to offer it in payment of his pas
sage He too left the boat determined
to go back home He started to walk
and became footsore He began shoving
the money to buy something to eat tlie
counterfeit was discovered and tile ar
rest was made Major Butterworthjook
in the situation f
I told that young man he said in
relating the story that if God had
made him a dishonest man he had failed
to put a sign on his face I told him to
go home to his wife and children as an
honest man He could scarcely realize
that he had escaped the penitentiary
He went home and a more honest or
better citizen I do not know today
That man had not the heart of a crimi
nal but if he had been sent to the -penitentiary
his children would have been
disgraced for life and probably he would
have belonged to the criminal class for
life St Louis Republic
Ants Witli Pluck and Brains1
To the intellectuality of ants yrhich
men like Sir John Lubbock have always
delighted to point out a new proof has
been added by the observations of a
well known scientist Professor
who has communicated it to the
Venetian institute He noticed tnat the
ants used as a bridge the twig of a tree
which touched a house they were desir
ous of reaching He accordingly cut off
the end of the twig so that it was im
possible for them to get across and then
watched
After the lapse of half an hour how
ever he found that the procession
which he had stopped had reformed
itself He proceeded to investigate the
matter and he found that the little ants
had discovered that there was another
twig which when it was blown by the
breeze touched the wall now and then
The army of ants had formed up in
line to this twig and whenever the
breeze blew it against the wall the fore
most members of the band took advan
tage of the opportunity to get across
Man with all his boasted genius
could da nothing more for not only did
the operation require clever timing but
absolute confidence in making what
under the circumstances must have
been a venturesome leap Strand Mag
