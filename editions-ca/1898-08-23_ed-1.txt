was running- as the second section of a long traiD crashed into thefirst section composed of local carsAs a result six persons were killedand 2G seriously injured The injuredwere nearly all removed to Boston ona special train which was met by ambulances and surgeons The rear carof the local train was complete demolished and a portion of the secondcar while the engine of the expresstrain was crippled The dead areFranklin M Waters SomervilleMassMrs William J Fitzpatrick Bostonher granddaughter Mary Fitzpatrick10 years of age and her grandson nve-years oldA woman supposed to he Mrs Watcon of Westerly R IMrs C H Briscoe RevereThe injured some 20 in number aremostly Bostom peopleThe two trains which were in thecollision were usually combined intoone long train but as the traffic Sunday was so heavy it was divided thefirst section running as a local accommodation while the second whichstarted from Mansfield 15 minuteslater than the first ran as an expressThe local train due at Sharon at 702was 13 minutes late It left Mansfieldon time making two stops and hadHost 13 minutes between Mansfield andSharon It was due in Canton Junction the next station beyond Sharontwo minutes ahead of the expresstrain which should have passed itthere Sharon is situated on a curveand both the outward and inwardtracks are protected by electric blocksignalsAfter the accident it was thoughtthe block signal protecting the inwardtrack was set at danger showing asit was intended that there was a trainin the stationThere was no warning given by theconductor of the Mansfield local toshow the approaching train that thetrack was not clear at the station andit was not until he was within 400feet of the station that the engineer ofthe express noticed anything wrongHe immediately set all brakes andwhistled the warning but it was toolate to stop the expressIt crashed into the rear car splittingit asunder and completely demolishingit with the exception of the roof Itsspeed was not slacked until the enginehad penetrated fully five feet in therear of the second car The escapingsteam entered the car and badly scalded a number of the occupants Theroof of the last car was forced on

Getchell was cut andbruised about the head He statedafter the accident that he left Mansfield promptly on time and there wasno incident until he was within 400feet of the Mansfield train Then hesaw the rear lights of that train andshut off all steam Meanwhile he hadwhistled for brakes and used every effort to stop his trainEvery one of the killed and injuredwere on the Mansfield train and theonh explanation of the fact that thenumber of fatalities is not larger isthat the passengers were all in the f orward end of the car in the act ofalighting at the station There wereabout 30 people in the last car andmost of them at the time of the accident were either upon the front platform or standing by the doorMary Fitzpatrick ten years old wastaken from the wreck but unconscious and died just as

nearly all branches of thearmy is following- close upon the cessation of hostilities Notably is thisthe case in the ordnance quartermasters and engineer bureaus where theneed for the supplies required and themen employed for the exigencies ofwar no longer exist In the ordnance bureau the force at the various arsenals is to be reducedin all cases wherethis can be accomplished without detriment to theservice The Rock Island arsenalprobably will be affected more thanany other There before the warabout 240 men were employed Whenthe peace protocol was signed therewere approximately 4000 menand orders have been issuedwhich will reduce this number by twothirds Before and during the warlarge numbers of contracts were madewith ordnance firms for supplying material In many cases these weremade conditional so that they could beterminated within a few days after thecessation of hostilities and the department has in every case availed itself ofthis privilege At the end of the civilwar the government had outstandingcontracts for furnishing a large number of big seacoast projectiles butas these were regarded unnecessarywhen hostilities came to an end amicable arrangements were made withthe companies by which their contracts were cancelledAt the present time contracts are inexistence also for furnishing sea coastprojectiles but as the government isdesirous of obtaining all contractedfor there will be no necessity to resortto such action as was taken at theclose of the civil warThe quartermasters department isdispensing as rapidly as possible withsuch of the transports that were chartered and for which there is now nonecessity Considerable labor is involved in this work as a board of survey has to be appointed to determinethe various incidental questions thatarise

in EuropeTerms of Capitulation as Agreed To I3etiveen den Merritt and Gen JandenesInclude Cession of the PhilippineArchipelago to Uncle SamPaius Aug 19 The American position in the far east is attracting greatattention The Soleil saysThe Americans will quadruple thevalue of the Philippines and Manilawill become the rival of Hong KongThe United States will have a preponderating situation in Chinese watersThere is no market they desire moreeagerly than the Chinese and thoughchey have been forestalled by otherpowers they will assuredly overtaketheir rivals by the rapidity of theirprogress in that region and in thecoming break up of the Chinese empire the United States will not be content with the worst fortunes for theirheritageThe Temps while congratulatingFrance upon the role of peacemakerrecognizes the fact that it is not always a good thing to put a finger between the hammer and the anviL TheTemps says The United States willnot hear a word of intervention andFrance has no interests in compromising herself gratuitously with a country evidently destined for a more active part in great international affairsIt would be artless to count overmuchon Spanish gratitude Therefore theFrench watchword should be messuirspoint de zeleLondon Aug 19 The Hong Kongcorrespondent of the Daily Mail saysThe terms of the capitulation ofManila as agreed upon Saturday between Gen Jaudenes and Gen Merritt include the cession of the Philippine archipelago to the United StatesAn American naval officer who arrived from Manila on the Zafirotells me that the Americanspractically walked into ManilaThe operations he says were confined to the Malate side of thecity where the Spaniards had a fortand two lines of trenches The troopswaded through the Malate river andwalked up the beach as though goingto lunch meeting practically no oppositionI learn that when Gen Merrittwent ashore after the capitulation ofManila he experienced some difficultyin finding Gen Jaudenes who ultimately was found in a church amongcrowds of women and childrenLondon Aug 19 The Vienna correspondent of the Times saysThe development of the Philippinesquestion will be watched here withkeenest interest Circumstances appear to point to the retention of theislands by America The fact thatSenator Davis who is a public advocate of complete annexation and secretary of state a supporter of theHawaiian policj are appointed commissioners is regarded as indicating that President McKinley favorstheir retention It is acknowledgedthat President McKinley has hithertomanifested exceptional diplomatictact in his treatment both of the Spanish government and of public opinionin the United States He conductednegotiations with such foresight andconsideration that the Madrid Cabinethas been able gradually to accustom thepopulation to the inevitable sacrificesimposed by the outcome of the warFor this reason the mere fact thatabsolute cession of the Philippineswas not expressly stated in the protocol by no means should be regardedas excluding that possibility of atleast some approximating to the growing demands of the American peopleThe prospect of a partition of Chinais likely to confirm this tendency ofAmerican people The United Statesare deeply interested from a commercial and industrial standpointin the future of East Asia They havethe most favorable geographical situation of all the great manufacturingcountries competing there and it isargued that such an enterprisingenergetic people will not willinglyforegosecuringthe present opportunity ofa footing in those seaswhich will enable them to establish large merchantile emporiumssimilar to those already possessedby the English on the mainland andwhich other states are about to foundThis consideration is expected to haveweight in the final decision of the Philippine questionThere is a suspicion here that themeeting of the peace commission inParis was intentionally delayed to enable the preparation and formation

lawis out and these bragging bullies havehad their combs cut I shall be in a better position to ask for what I want Atreaty on the basis of such pretensionsas mine would be rather absurd justnowThat sounds verj sensible its justwhat I thinkBut in the meantime why so muchiimiking Why not be ourselves sincethe main thing is settledIs there no other thing in the waynot anything at all You spoke ofmy forgiving something- withoutknowing what it was Will you nottell me now what it was that you spokeofIt is all past history I told 3 011 Ishould get out of the fix I was in and Idid I haveBut what was itDearest I cannot tell 3ou The matter is confidential and it relates tobusiness which is not my own The position it placed me in became insupportable from the moment I saw youand I resigned my part in it but having done so I cannot now give it awayI do not like mysteries I have toldyou everything about myself even tomy sillies dreams and fanciesThis is no dream my darling it isserious business and it is not my ownAny trust is serious and though I tookthis one on me rather lightly it is notlightly that I give it up and if I shouldnow betray itTo tell it to me merely to satisfya shade of

distinguished French dramatistScribe On one occasion he visited atthe country house of a friend and theevenings were spent over English novels which were read aloud by the English governess residing with the familyOne evening the young lady pausedfor a moment when she had finished achapterAh she said with a sigh if I couldonly realize my dreamAnd what is your dream askedScribeThe little governess blushed Tohave some day after a long longtime an income of 1200 francs sothat I might have independence andrestSeveral days afterward as the lastchapter of a rather insignificant novelwas finished the dramatist turned tothe reader- and said Do you knowI think that in- this there is a prettysubject for a one act comedy Youhave suggested the idea to me arejouwilling to write the play with meThe proposition was joyfully accepted Three days later Scribe entered thesalon with the comedy finished andthree months afterward it was announced that the piece would be performed in Paris Scribe hurried to thehouse of his dramatic agent and saidto him under the seal of secrecyThey are going to produce a piece ofmine to day I had a young lady collaborator in the work I do notknowwhether it will be a success but I doknow that it raust bring her 1200 francsa 3iear as long as she lives Arrange thematter so that it will have a perfectly natural air-The sequence of this story illustratesa curious trait of human natureCharmed with her success the youngEnglish teacher now spends a greatdeal of time in hunting up plots for playsfrom English novels all of which shecarries to M Scribe who always gentlydeclines them One day some one wasexpressing very -warm admiration forScribe in the 3oung ladys presenceOh yes she replied he is a charming man but well in fact he is alittle ungrateful We made a verypretty comedy together which hasbrought us 3200 francs a year but hewill not write with me again YouthsCompanionThe Professors Wife as a CriticA college professor who prided himself on his

Under to oil by Many Amateur Road BuildersThe function of a pavement or roadsurface is very imperfectly understood even in sections where stoneroads have been in use for long- periods It is commonly supposed that awet spot or bog- will become dry ifiilled in that -a good road may bemade anywhere simply by making ashallow trench of the desired widthand filling it with stone and that thefiurface of a stone road needs to beprotected from wear by covering itwith loose screenings sod earth orany old stuff that is handy in hotweatherTo these erroneous notions are duePS rfeT- -UNCOMFORTABLE

it will always be wet at least inthe wet season no matter what else isdone to it Water under a roadbed isas fatal to the life of the road as waterin a mans lungs is fatal to his existenceThe not

passing vehicle Aiaised and crowned roadbed whichwill shed water readily is essential Adry base with a slightly arched coverof stone capable of shedding the rainis requisite for a dry permanentstructureThe stone roadway is not only toserve as a roof f pr the natural base beneath but is to take the wear of traffic and not to be covered with othermaterial as a protection to it Inplaces where earth is used for binding purposes and little regular attention is paid to the roads andsprinkling is not done in dry weatherthe road surface breaks up rapidly under the influence of the sun It isthen that it has heaped upon it toprotect it quantities of fine screenings or earth and stones and sometimes even claj and sod from the gutters The result is a poor road foemonths

is fastened up so that she cannotget it down she cannot kick Eachvicious kick is accompanied with a lowering of the head as if to hook Whenthe cow goes to lower her head shefinds that the ring in her

aspect or how muchmoney it will bring in although thereceipts from the sale of the surplusare not to be despised either it israther the health of good living thatcomes from an abundant supply of allkinds of fruit that may be readilygrown in that locality so that all theyear round the family may have allthey can consume There are fruitspecialists the Homestead remarksof course just as there are specialistsin other lines of farm industry whomake a handsome income out of theorchard and small fruit plantingsThey like the work and therefore learnit easily and keep on learning untilthey are gray and their knowledge becomes more valuable every jear byaccretion Any young farmer who begins on a scale adapted to his homeneeds may grow into a specialist ofthis kind but thousands never doThis is no reason why the thousandsshould not have all the fruit their families can use Beginning with the mostuseful kinds and those most easilygrown the farmer can gradually surround himself with a good home orchard and small fruits of all kindsthat improve his living and reduceits cost thus adding to his comfortand independence We do not find itnecessary to do much in the way ofurging horticulture Those who arealready fitted for it -know enoughabout it to determine for themselveswhether or not they shall engage in itwhile those who are not sufficientlyinformed must work their way to itif at all by beginning at the bottomof the ladder and there is no betterway to do this than hy beginning witha few good trees in a home orchardand small areas of small fruit forhome use We do urge thistipon

into Indiana and finally overhauled his special car and knocked atthe door Mr Gould responded in person and the reporter held up his cardso that his victim could read it throughthe glass windowThe

and isanxious to give them away to spite oldPloodGould always believed that the secretof his ability to overcome others in anycontest of wits was his temperate habitof life He never tasted whisky but onceIn the days when he was a surveyor ina small way and was mapping a countyon the practical line of getting lodgingsand meals of the farmers in exchangefor marking correct sundials on theirdoorafceps he became tired one hotdusty afternoon He came to a countrytavern In hi pocket was a 5 cent pieceIt suddenly struck him that as i medicine to relieve f aintness he ought to buy aglass of whisky with his nickel I wasignorant of bar usage he said once indescribing the incident to a t riena andso when a glass and a bottle were setbefore me I filled the tumbler chockfull The bartender made no protestand I swallowed the big horn Then 1went my way trundling my wheelbarrow like measure of distances and occasionally taking the bearings with a sextant Never in my life had my workgone off half so blithesomely and forawhile I felt as though making a map ofthe starry heavens instead of a Terydusty portiort of this mundane spheraAfter an hour or more of exaltation Igrew sleepy and took a long nap undera tree in a field I awoke with an awfulheadache and found that the figures entered in my notebook during the time ofextra steam were quite incoherent Iwas fully convinced that whisky was abad surveyor and I have never tried itfor any other purpose Cor KateFields WashingtonTea as MedicineIn some forms of heart disease teaproves a useful sedative while in othersit is

will callJake who was arrested for burglary Hewas only 19 good looking and exceedinglybright According to his story which Ifound was true lie was left an orphan atan early age and was brought up by hisgrandmother who kept a small store in acountry town in Pennsylvania While howas reading with a Presbyterian clergyman preparatory to his entering collegehe became disgusted with his mode of lifeand started off to look for adventures Howandered away on foot and his moneywas soon spent and he found himself onenight moneyless and houseless and almost in rars He came across a plantation and tne lights in the great houseshone out bright and cheerful He turnedup a narrow path and soon found himselfwith only a narrow coppice between himand the house He crept through the coppice and saw that a large company throngedtho big dwelling and were evidently having a good time Tho parlors were crowded and lie saw that preparations had beenmade for private theatricals Keeping inthe shadow he passed round to tho side ofthe house and saw a window in tho secondfloor brightly lighted Che sash was openand a young man was inside evidentlyputting on a dress for somo part in a playPresently the light was turned down andtho young man disappeared from tho roomAfter a time Jake went cautiously towardthe house and had a look at the situationof tho window Walking round to thorear ho came across a ladder which hobrought and placed so as to enable him toreacli the window Ho ascended the ladder and after satisfying himself that allws clear entered the roomOn the bed lay a full dress suit nodoubt laid aside by tho recent occupantand a handsome gold watch and chain attached to tho vest Patent leather shoeslay on the floor On tho dressing tablewas a pocketbook containing over 600 inbills and a diamond ring and pin lay nearby In a valise lying open on a chair werevarious articles of clothing He threw offhis brogues and put on the patent leathersThen he drew on tho trousers which werelying on tho bed His next act was to puton a shirt taken from the valise a collarand a necktie Ho arrayed himself in thevest and dress coat and took a view ofhimself in the large glass He unlockedthe door walked out boldly into the corridor and turned toward the capaciousstairway In tho hall below gayly dressedpeople were walking around Presentlya bell rang and these persons moved toward tho parlors into which they crowdedJake calmly walked down stairs to approach the door of the parlors Afterstanding for a few minutes gazing on thescene he went toward the rack where hatsand overcoats were hanging Selecting ahat which he thought would fit him hotook ic from the rack and placed it on hishead It fitted well At the moment hewas selecting an overcoat a servant approached and offered tolielp him He puton tho coat with tho aidof the servantand saying lam just going for a strollho walked out of the door and away Hoknew that there was a railroad station notfar away for he had seen the depot as hecame along and he turned his stepsthitherwardOn reaching it he found that a trainwas due and after asking the porter a fewquestions he took a ticket for a junction20 miles away The train camoJiina fewminutes later and ho got on board andwas soon steaming away In thepocketof tho overcoat he found a case of line cigars one of which he lit On reachingtho junction a train was waiting intowhich he got and was whirled awayr hocared not whitherAt daylight the train stopped for a quarter of an hour The young man who hadpurposely dropped his hat while lookingout the car window as the name on thehat might give hhn away asked the conductor where he could get another hatThere was a store opposite the station andto that the conductor directed him andthere he got a soft felt hat Then he gotsomething to eat and went off with thetrain Of course I could tell you justwhere Jake stopped but thats not necessary By dusk he had reached Ja populouscity and there he parted with his overcoat and his dress coat and got new onesin their places He went to a hoteL antLhad a good feed and treated himself to abottle of wineHe was too restless to- stay there allnightr and so he took a train north andin due time reached New York He boughtsome things needful and put them in avalise After seeing the town he determined to visit his old home and you maybe sure his old grandmother was surprisedto see him It was dusk when he arrivedand he invented a story to- account for hisabsence and improved appearance- Theold lady was suspicious- and told him hermind and he grew alarmed fearing thatshe might do something to endanger hissafety After she was fast asleep he leftthe house went to the railroad station amile away and took a train for OhioHow comes the- remarkable part of thestory It looks like an invention but it isevery word true Jake reached the placeto which he had taken his ticket next dayand staid there for a few hours Late inthe afternoon lie resolved to go fartherwest and went to the station Many per-sons were waiting as it was a junctionand several trains were expected A seriesof whistles rang out and an engine andtender appeared in a cutting approachingat a rapid rate As the en sine passedthere was a loud report and somethingshot up into the air It turned out to be abroken nut It descended with terrificforce and injured a passenger on the platform of the station His son and daughter who were accompanying him homerushed to the spot and among the first torender aid was Jake A doctor attendedto the in juredL man and he was removed toa hotel near by The son had been attentively observing Jake for some time andjust as the wounded man was carriedaway his son said to JakeWill you be good enough to tell me thetimeThe young fellow drew out the watchwhich he had stolen and told the timeThe son turned aside and spoke to an official and presently both came up to Jakeaccompanied by another man This person said the son has in his possession awatch and chain stolen from me at such atime and place And he also wears a diamond pin taken at the same time I request you to arrest him ExchangePreferable to OperaHerr Hugelspiel sadly Ach hlmmellHow is it
