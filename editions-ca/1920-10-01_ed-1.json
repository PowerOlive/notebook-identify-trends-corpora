James D. Condon, aged about
sixty-five, a formei resident of
Paris, died in the St. Francis Hospi

ucation in the school of th- day, set
out in life for himself. He secured
employment as eirand boy in the A.
Newhoff dry goods store, and by his

PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.
During the month of October the
Presbyterian church will have its
fall Church Attendance Rally, the
ambition being to have a record at
tendance during the month of Octo
ber. This record attendance for the
month will be the beginoer of a rec
ord attendance for the entire year.
Mr. Nelson, of the Bourbon Lumber
Company, is making a large chare
10 dc piacea in tne church, on
which the record of the attendance
of tie successive Sundays will be
shown. Every member of the con
gregation is asked to make a special
effort to push the "mercury" out of
the top of the Church Attendance
Thermometer. The' church is veiy
fortunate in having the best quar
tette in the Blue Giass to lead its
imusic. Mis. Macie Fithian, Miss
Flora Hill, Mr. Robert Harbison and
Mr. Charles Mitchell, assisted by an
excellent chorus, give the congrega
tion a musical tieat each Sunday.
The subjects for Sunday are morn

Poultry pi ices are lower, due to
increasing supplies and lighter de
mand. Prices, however, aie higher
than the conespondirg wepk a year
ago.
Ppultry packing plants are now
generally so fixed that they have
sufficient help to take care of a lib
eral volume of poultry. Even mar
keting is suggested, in order to pre
vent a glut a few weeks hence,
which would have a tendency fur
ther to reduce prices.
Buttei consumption is leported
generally to be larger and market
and crop conditions justify a .strong
effort being made to maintain fall
and winter production.
Nearly 1,000,000 pounds of but
ter arrived during the week from
South America, selling at some dis
count under home production.
Egg receipts continue light, but
to obtain top prices, must he
strictly fresh. Old and held stock
are not as desirable as prime stor-1
