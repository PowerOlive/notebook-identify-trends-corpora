Negotiate With the Patriots MeetsWith No EncouragementHavana via Key West Fla Nov23 Gen Pando has started by trainfrom this city in order according- tothe official announcement to takecharge of the campaign against the insurgents He was accompanied by hisfull staff and was escorted by a company of artillery But it is stated onvery good authority that Gen Pandohas been commissioned by MarshalBlanco the aptain general to enterinto commu aication with the insurgent leaders with a view of arrangingfor peaceThis statement is based on an accurate knowledge of all the facts in thecase Gen Pando did not leave thiscity until he had taken steps calculatedto further the object which MarshalBlanco has in view Gen Pando aftera consultation with the captain general first thought about the release fromconfinement of Damian Caballero whohas been imprisoned on the Isle ofPines for some time past for it js alleged acting as a spy for the insurgents and bringing about a disaster for the Spanish troops atCacao province of Santiago deCuba Gen Pando furnishedCaballero who is the god father ofRabi looked upon as being the backbone of the insurgent movement in theprovince of Santiago de Cuba with aconsiderable sum of money and causedhim to be landed at Manzanillo province of Santiago de Cuba where agood horse was placed at his disposalGeneral Pandos peace emissary wasalso furnished official documents empowering-him to act in behalf o theSpanish commander and from Manzanillo Caballero made his way secretlyto the Jiguani hills where GenRabi has his headquarters GensPando instructed Caballero to offer Gen Rabi a high rank inthe Spanish army and a large sumof money to be distributed among theother insurgent leaders of that part oiCuba and in addition a large amountof money for himself in the event oihis succeeding in arranging terms forpeace Besides this Caballero was instructed to inform the insurgent leaders that the Spanish authorities undertook to honestly establish the new autonomist regime if the leaders of theinsurgents would accept the propositions made to themThere seems to be no intimation asto the result of Caballeros negotiations with Gen Du Valon although itmay be judged from the attitude assumed by Gen Rabi that the peacenegotiations are likely to fall flat inSantiago de Cuba Gen Pando inthe meanwhile acting after consultation with Marshal Blanco has t putother irons in the fire in the hope ofprevailing upon the insurgents to cometo terms He has been and still is innegotiation with three leaders of theCuban revolution and lias been endeavoring to induce them to go to different insurgent camps to use theirinfluence to bring about peace on thepromise of Cuba being accorded a real-ly autonomous form of governmentt These men were also offered money forthemselves and were to have beenfurnished with large sums to distribute among their friends But it isunderstood they have hitherto declinedto become agents of Gen Pando alleging-as their excuses that they have noinfluence with the insurgent leadersIn some quarters it is believed thatthis reluctance to accept the overturesof Gen Pando is due to the fact thatthe insurgents are anticipating- somestrong steps in their favor when theUnited States congress meets Itis generally admitted that GenPando is somewhat mortified atthe non success of his plans upto the present and has informed the three ex insurgent leadersreferred to that he doubts their sincerity and he indirectly gave them tounderstand that he -was of the opinionthat they were opposed to the sovereignty of Spain over Cuba and hadno desire to assist the Spanish authorities in their efforts to bring abouta peaceful settlement of thetroubles The -Cubans protestedthat thej wTere sincere and repeated the excuses they had alreadymade for their non compliance withthe requests of the Spanish generalThe latter though somewhat disappointed it is understood will continuehis efforts to come to an ainderstandinsrwith the insurgents and the militaryauthorities believe the best way to dothis is to inflict upon the enemy a signal defeat which Gen Pando hopes toaccomplishOn the other hand it is believed theinsurgents have similar plans thoughfrom an opposite direction and with atotally different object in view Ifcurrent reports among the friends ofthe insurgents are to be believed therevolutionary leaders hope to strike adecisive blow at Spain before congressmeets as an encouragement to theirfriends in the United States who areurging a recognition upon the part ofthe United States government of thebelligerency of the insurgents of CubaThe Black Diamond RouteWilson O Nov 23 The surveyorson che proposed Columbus Ohio Riverand Tidewater railroad Black Diamond route reached

ofLieut Gibbons who has charge of thenaval militia matters The reportspeaks in high terms of the operationsof the naval onilitia and is approved byMr RooseveltCommenting on the inspection madeby himself Mr Roosevelt saysI was greatly pleased with the zealand efficiency shown by the differentorganizations which I personally visited Ohio Michigan Illinois and NewYork and no less with the showingmade by most of the others as set forthin the accompanying reports Therewere two or three concerning whichthe reports were less favorableThe different state organizationsare continually asking for old vesselsand the department has finally triedthe experiment of sending the Yanticto the lakes for the use of the Michigan militia The supply of theseold wooden vessels has now becomepractically exhausted The department has tried the experiment of loaning monitors to the different organizations but the results have not so farbeen satisfactory as monitors are poorships for cruising or for use as barracksThere are three or four of these organizations which in the event of asudden emergency could be utilized atonce for manning the smaller nationalcruisers but this of course can notgenerally be the case with the majority of the organizations They mustbe depended upon primarily as a second line of defense There are twovery important features which shouldbe attended to by such a secondline One is the placing- of mines theother the establishment of signalstations for coast defense The department should request that thereshould be inserted in the provision forthe maintenance of the naval militiathe words submarine mining outfits5so as to allow of training them for thispurpose The department has alsobeen maturing plans for the signalstations for the coast defenseand a very slight expenditure ofmoney with the co operation of thetreasury department will put this ona satisfactory basis The organizations are continually requesting thedetail of officers to instruct them andthey can best of all be instructed byactual service on regular war vesselsor under the supervision of naval officers and in conjunction with thesailorsIt is much to be wished that congress will authorize in the first placethe substitution for the old paddlewheel steamer Michigan on the lakesof a small modern gunboat perhaps onthe Petrel type to be devoteorganizations and to overseeing themand furthermore

when he gotup on the fatal night or not askedHendricksAh No I was a fool not to thinkof that but I could not watch everything One has to concentrate his mindon a single idea to hypnotize successfullyQuite rjght doctor but having myeyes well open last night though Idid have to look through a slit in thatscreen over there I observed that MrWhidby before getting up seemed tobe trying to push something away fromhim It was a knife the murderer wastrying to give him And finally whenMr Whidby did get out of bed his handwas not closedAh I see cried Dr Lumpkin Iwas verjr stupidNot at all returned the detectivewith a laugh I make a great manymistakes and sometimes my mistakeshelp me to get on the right track inthe end That was one point youmissed Here is the other Come overto this window Do you see anythingunusual hereI examined it early this morningbroke in Col Warrenton putting on hiseye glasses but to save ray life I couldnot guess what you were looking atList nightThe detective put his linger on thewindow sillDont you see that little crackPlainly now said Dr Lampklnbut it means nothing to meHendricks looked around at the circleof faces- V After failing to putthe knife intoMr Whidbys hand the murderer stuckit a big one it was too right herewith the handle up then he stood awayand tried to make Mr Whidb go toit and take it He failed three timesYou remember how Mr Whidby wouldslowly draw near the window and thengo back Well that is the explanationThe hypnotist could not control hissubject sufficiently What did he donext He made Mr Whidby sit onthe side of the bed just as he did lastnight you know for about ten minutes Then he took the knife himselfhastily perhaps angrily for you noticethe wood is splintered a little If hehad been perfectly cool he would havedrawn it out carefully He was vexedover his failure to control Mr WhidbyHis next move was to hypnotize MrStrong into a merry mood and thenhe committed the deedWhat did he do after that To meit is as plain as the nose on a mansface for I made a thorough examination of that corner last night He stoodthere with his dripping knife in hisband and succeeded in controlling MrWhidby to the extent of making himgo into the other room He made himtouch the murdered mans throat andreturn to bed His plan was to makeMr Whidby sleep till he was foundnext morning with signs of guilt onhim But as you know the cook whousually called the two men in the morning was absent Mr Whidby slept tilllate waked of his own accord andsummoned the police with such an appearance of innocence that he was notarrestedWe are delighted and very gratefulto you Mr Hendricks said Col Warrenton when the detective had concluded Im sure it has taken a load oilthe minds of this young coupleI can only say that I am so happyI cannot express my feelings on thesubject said Miss Delmar She blushedas she caught Whidbys arm and theywalked from the roomHendricks found them in the library1 a few minutes later Col Warrenton andDr Lampkin having left the houseI have explained all this for a purpose Mr Whidby said he As a ruleI make no explanations to anyone tilla mystery is completely solved but Imust have your assistance at this pointand I wanted to put you into a morehopeful humor I think I may add thatthere is no one so deeply concerned inthe discovery and detection of the criminal as 3ou are -Thats true said Whidby and Ifeel so pleased with what you haye justsaid that I would work my fingers tothe bone to lielp youDo you think Mr HendricksaskedMiss Delmar that if you dont succeedhi capturing the -criminal the circumstances surrounding the affair will reflect on Mr WhidbyIn a way yes decidedly was thereply There is not I think quiteenough evidence to convict Mr Whidbybut the circumstances are very awkward If we dont catch sdmcoutsideparty half the world will continueto believe Mr Whidby guiltyJ- rrtrt iiContinue asked Miss Delmar witha sudden upward glance then youthinkThat public opinion is about halfdivided Yes You see even if weoffer the theory of hypnotism it wont0 down with the oiihodox worldwhich doesnt believe in such thingsBy reading the papers you will seethat there is really a great deal of honest doubt of Mr Whidbys innocencein all parts of the countryThats true sighed the girl Ohplease let me help you in some wayFm sure I ought to be able to do somethingYou shall help me and Mr Whidbyvery soon butl cant remain with youlonger now to explain Could youhow would it suit both of you to meetme here this afternoon at two oclockI think I can come gladly answeredMiss Delmar Father has forbiddenme to seeI know that very well smiled Hendricks You see that you too havebeen watchpdI understood so replied the girlbut I didnt care 1 knew my intentions were goodI discovered that pretty soon infact the moment I saw you with yourveil off said the detective and feltashamed of my precaution He hadrisen and held his watch in his handWill the arrangement suit you MrWhidbyPerfectly answered Whidby andHendricks bowed himself out of theroomCHAPTER XIIIHendricks called a cab at the doorand drove to the office of Capt WelshHe found Welsh pacing the floor in alfever of impatienceI thought you would never turn upin the world said Welsh as they tookseats It seems to me that everythingis at a standstill The city is wild withexcitement and demanding that something be doneHendricks shrugged his shoulders asif he had only half heard the remarkand had been disturbed in some train ofthought He reached for a cigar in abox on the captains desk bit the endof it and then seemed to sink into areverie againWelsh stared at him a moment invexation then he saidI was on the watch mjself at themayors last uight About ten oclockI saw Mrs Walters slip out on the lawnShe came very cautiously from therear of the house I saw her stoop topick up something near where your umbrella was left and then she returnedby the front doorHendricks nodded slowly but did notlook up from the spot on the carpetat which he had been staring for several minutes Welsh flushed slightlyand went on awkwardlyI had expected to find out a lot abouther early life from a lady friend otmine but as bad luck will have itthe lady has left the city for the summer and I dont exactly knowshe has gone I was thinking of hunting her up and going to see her if youthinkHendricks rose abruptlyI must write a letter he said Giveme some paper pleaseWelshs face fell as he rose and drewsome writing materials from a drawerand put them before the detectiveDo you want me to cease my investigations he asked impatientlyHendricks dipped a pen in the inkwell and as he did so he looked up andcaught sight of the captains faceOh hang it all captain he saidpardon me I have not heard half ofwhat you were saying I only caughtenough at the start to know that youwere not on the right track Let thewoman alone for awhile Do you remember I said that if I discovered certain things about a mysteriousstranger in the city I should have tobegin all over againYes certainly butI have begun all over again AndHendricks began to write hurriedlyCan I help you in any wayI am afraid not now captain Alittle later perhaps but time is too valuable just now for useless explanations every minute must count Thisis the hardest nut I ever tried to crackWelsh said nothing further He sankinto a chair and looked cut of a window till Hendricks had finished andsealed his letterNow said the detective as he roseand grasped his hat I am going outfor a little lunch and then I have anappointment- I shall see you laterAt two oclock Hendricks rang thebell at the Strong homestead Whidbyhimself opened the doorIs Miss Delmar here asked the detectiveShe has been here several minutesanswered Whidby She is in the libraryGood said Hendricks Now forbusiness he went on cheerily as heentered the library and bowed to MissDelmar Move tip your chairs bothof you There that will do Nowheres what I want to get at ColWarrenton was good enough to put meon to a little circumstance which hesays he has not mentioned to you MrWhidby but which we must sift to thebottom It may lead us to a niotivefor the crime and that is what waare looking for Do you happen toknow if your uncle had an enemy ofany sortWhidby shook his head though tfullyI cant think who it could be if hehad one he said On the contraryuncle seemrd to make friends

DelmarThats what Im here for repliedHendricks And you are both going tohelp me Now that visitor came hereand threatened Mr Strbng about some 1thing so Matthews says and one whowill threaten a man to his face is aptto do so in other ways Mr Whidby vdo you remember ever having seen youruncle receive any letter which seemedto disturb him at allWhidby reflected a moment then helooked up with a startYes I had not thought of it beforebut my uncle has once or twice actedpeculiarly after receiving letters Abouta month ago he opened a letter at thebreakfast table and seemed almost toturn sick over it He was white andtrembled all over I asked him whatwas the matter but he said he feltsuddenly faint and that was all hewould tell me I was concerned abouthim and wanted to send for a doctorbut he refused to let me and declaredhe was all right He seemed so Tin-strung that I felt uneasj I reallyfeared his mind was affected so Twatched him through the curtains forawhile after he went into the roomwhere he keeps his papersWhat did he do there Try try tothink of everything urged the detec rtive his eyes glittering as he fixed themon the young mans faceHe stood at the window went onWhidby and read the letter againFrom where I was in the hall I could seethe paper quivering in his hands Heremained there for a long time as ifin deep thought and then threw theenvelope into a waste paper baskettook down a file and put the letter carefully awayAh I see Good so far exclaimedHendricks Do you think you wouldknow that letter againI dont know perhaps so It was ira large square bluish

DansrerousThe bicycle has increased both thehealth and the hazards the perils andthe pleasures of life but in exactlywhich proportion no one knows and inthe nature of things it is extremely difficult to determine how far the bicyclehas made life more dangerousAccident Assurance a Boston paperhas collected from the newspapers thebicycle accidents in the United Statesin August They numbered 1450 andthe journal which collected themreaches the conclusion that they areabout 15 per cent of the whole numberThis is of course not much better thana mere guess though the paper fromwhich we are quoting claims to havereached this conclusion after carefulinvestigation These August accidents consist of 46 deaths 244fractures 224 cuts and lacerations 420 contusions and bruises 44 dislocations 89sprains and 297 injuries to the headFor an innocent recreation in a singlemonth this will strike most people as apretty fair list of casualties Besidesthe 46 persons reported instantly killedIn August there were 48 persons reported as likely to die Assuming onehalf of them as terminating fatally andthere would be 70 deaths from bicjclesin August August is a favorite monthfor riding Fairmount park had forinstance 219364 riders in Augustagainst 163675 in September AccidentAssurance concludes that the averagenumber of deaths for the month is 65of 780 a year Xearly all the deathsfrom accidents probably get in thenewspapers so that one may fairly saythat the fatal bicycle accidents in thiscountry are from 700 to 800 and nearer800 than 700 It would surprise no onewho knows how much the newspapersdo not get to learn that the fatalitiesreached 1000Taking even 800 this compares with181 passengers killed in 1896 year ending June 30 1900 railroad employesan 4406 persons run over by trainsThese things are howevei relativeAbout 5000000 bicycles are believed tobe in use If there are 800 deaths andthis means a pretty fair proportionthere is one death annually for 6250bicycles Among trainmen there wasin 1S96 one death for every 152 employed This indicates that it is 41times as dangerous to be a brakemanas to ride a bicycle No one can certainly object to a risk as small as this Noone looks on a brakeman as foolhardyand his risk of getting killed is fortyfold that of a bicycle owners Out ofthe passengers carried one out of 2827474 was killed These are not separatepassengers as individuals but as tripsGiving each bicycle owner in 5000000five trips a week of all sorts long andshort andi with 800 deaths there wouldbe one to every 1562500 trips Thiswould make the bicycle just about twiceas dangerous trip for trip not mile formile a very different matter as rail-road ridingAll this is mere approximation butas far as the death risk goes one maysafely say that the bicycle rider has avery much less risk of a fatal accidentthan a trainman and that his risk is agood deal greater say twice as greatas a railroad passengers So far thereis some basis for calculation no verygood basis but better than nothingWhen it comes to mere accidents Accident Assurance is at sea It assumesthat only one sixth to one seventh or15 per cent of the accidents are reported and taking the reported non fatalaccidents only 1404 for a single monthit concludes that the entire numberis about 9000 per month or 108000 ayearNo great trust can be put in a calculation of this sort If there are about100000 bicycle accidents in a year thenabout one bicycle owner in 50 is injured in each year Among the trainmen oue in ten is injured so that whilethe bicycle owners chance ot beingkilled is 40 times less than a trainmanshis chance of being hurt is only onefifth as great Again assuming thatbicycles are ridden on the average fivetimes a week about one bicycle passenger or tripper so to speak is hurtout of every 115000 while among passengers one out of 178132 is injuredso that the chances of injury on the bicycle to the chances on a railroad trainare about as three to twoThe sound conclusion therefore isthat while bicycle ridingis on the wh aleless safe than ridingon a railroad it hasfar less hazards than work on railroadsHazards and perils bicycle riding unquestionably has This is one of thevery best things about it Our civilization would be but a poor weak andspiritless thing if 5000000 bicycle owners were not glad to face some risk foran

were in Bangormarketing they received two half dollars fresh from the mint As both wereyoung men with plenty of money fortheir immediate wants they stampedtheir initials in stencil upon the coinsand took them to a hotel where theyexchanged them for two dinners Inthe Lincoln Douglas campaign of 1SG0the two young men who had becomevoters joined the Wide Awakes anorganization of uniformed republicanswho paraded the towns with torchlights One evening after a parade inRockland they went out to supper andin exchange for a bill paid to the cashier Pinhorn received a half dollarmarked H P It was the coin he hadsent adrift four 3ears beforeThe war came on and both of theyoung men enlisted following the fortunes of the Twenty second Maineregiment For five or six vears afterthe war there was no silver or gold incirculation and nothing was seen ofthe marked coins until the GarfieldHancock campaign of 1880 Then MrGeorge received the half dollar markedH P in exchange for beef which hehad sold He turned it over to MrPinhorn whb paid it out for tobaccoat the local store After that the HP half dollar returned frequentlyMr Pinhorn got it in 1883 Mr Georgoin 1884 and again in 1885 and Mr Pinhorn had it three times and in 1891 MrGeorge received it and paid it out fourtimes It was taken in by Mr Georgein 1S94 after which it made a long sojourn in other partsMeantime Mr George grew anxiousabout the half dollar which bore hisinitials and advertised offering five dollars for its return to him Severalspurious imitations of the real articlewere sent in and promptly returned asthe stencil marks were not made in theright kind of type Though he kept anadvertisement standing in all the localpapers and in two of the Boston dailiesfor nearly a year he received no tidings of what he wanted Recently hewent to a Bangor bank to getsion check cashed anl in the moneywhich the cashier passed out were twohalf dollars Upon the face of onewere the old initials H P and onthe other were the letters of his ownname A A G It was the long losthalf dollar which he had stamped andspent for a dinner in 1S5G and for whichhe had been offering a reward MrGeorge has framed his half dollar andhung it up over his desk with orders tohave it placed in his coffin The coinmarked H P was turned looseagain to go out and make a history foritself N Y SunThe Art of Conversation Is a GiftA good talker is

of Clarence also extended herhand in kindly greeting and as Francisco looked at her smiling face flossyblond hair big blue eyes and becoming toilet he thought her a very angelHe made his grandest bow thenpressed her hand to his lips Theothers smiled and Mary blushed butthe evident sincerity of his admirationpleased her greatlyAfter the boys had retired that nightthe older people held a short

they saw the Rabbit comingback on the run making vicious kicksat every team his ears laid back andhis teeth snappingFrancisco ran out and called him byname Immediately the horse stoppedand allowed himself to be caughtBlack Ben came running up breathlessand indignant Again he took the halter to lead the horse away butthe Rabbit braced himself stiffly andrefused to moyeA crowd began to gather Clarencewas greatly mortified but Franciscotook it as a matter of course Accosting a truckman he politely asked theloan of a blaclcsnake whip Taking thehalter from Ben he laid the whipover the Rabbits

avery important part of the business forto us a dairy without some good thriftycalves is not what it should be If a calfis worth raising at all it is worth raising well To begin with we watch thedam closely to see that she has a goodcomfortable place to drop her calf inIn cold weather a stall box with plentyof bedding is a good place Then weleave matters with her unless we seethat she needs assistance which sheoften does especially if she is a youngcow We do not remove the calf immediately after birth as some people dobut leave it to suck two or three timesat least If its mother is an old cowwe let it suck five or six times takinggreat care that the youngster does notget too much milk and therefore get thescours We then put the calf in a penin the barn where the mother can seeit and not worry over it and teach itto drink its mothers milk as soon asdrawn for a week or ten days then begin feeding skimmed milk with abouta tablespoonful of ground flaxseedscalded by pouring a little boilingvf ater over it and letting it stand a fewminutes before mixing it with the milkAfter about three or four weeks theration is composed entirely of skimmedmilk and ground flaxseedBeing placed in the pen with the oldercalves it soon learns to eat clover hayand grain composed of equal parts ofshelled corn oats and wheat branwhich are fed liberally We feed theground flaxseed in preference to oilmeal because it contains more fat andis the best substitute for the creamtaken from the milk that we have evertried After the calf gets to be aboutten or twelve weeks old we substituteoil meal for the flaxseed until the calfis weaned from milk entirely at theage of five or six months and then addthe oil meal to the grain in a dry stateA calf needs its grain ration twice a dafor a 3ear at least before it is turnedout to grass alone By following thisplan we have never failed to raise calvesthat would weigh from 800 to 1100pounds at one year oldFrom this time on they need the attention of some one to see f hat they arebred at the right time Fifteen toeighteen months is pur rule so as tohave them drop their first calf soonafter they are two years old Havingmost of our heifers come in fresh in thespring they are put in the barn the fallbefore and handled during the winterand fed a little grain to keep them ingood condition and the udders developed as much as possible by hand rubbing This we think is an excellentplan because the cow is invariablygentle after this kind of treatment andit is no trouble to break her DakptaField and FarmCHEAP CRIB ROOFS-Made

Michigan agricultural college but used it stronger thanhe commends and much stronger than7 n-DEVICE FOR SPRAYING VINESwould be safe on peach trees We alsomade the machine shown in the cutwhich does good work We made a cartto track ten feet wide as our rows arethree feet four inches apart withthree rows between the wheels whichcomes in good form for working twohorses we used front wagon wheelsand a pair of old skeins found ata wagon shop On this we made a platform five feet long and six feet widewell bolted on A common spray pumpand barrel were secured to this andtwo hose connected to the pump eachhose is connected to two spray nozzlesby galvanized iron pipe three feet fourinches long with stop cock where thehose joins the pipe These were secured to a light strip of wood so thatthe nozzles were three feet four inchesapart By spraying the three rows between the wheels and one outside thefour rows are easily reached This isreadily manipulated by the person sitting at the back end of the platformand much better on hilly land than iffastened to the cartIt is important to secure good nozzles Great care should be taken tostrain all material before it enters thepump We strain everything

FIffht the Pest Known as theFiat Headed BorerA correspondent tells the Northwestern Agriculturist that many are inquiring as to the cause Of their orchardtrees failing by being girdled underthe bark and bored through the trunkand in small trees causing them tobreak off at that point This is donebv the flat headed borer The ejre s arelaid by the beetle early in June Arehatched in a few days and the slugcommences operations at once by boring through the bark and then cuttinghis way around the tree in the sapwood till about time to change whenhe turns and strikes for the center andmakes his change to the beetle formand the following June is ready for hisuext annual job It is said that thetrees whose sap has become partiallysonred by sun scald or any othercause or their vigor checked in anyway that the odor arising from thechanged condition of the sap attractsthe beetle who is looking for just suchconditions as the suitable place to deposit her eggs Thus newly plantedtrees are especially susceptible to theattacks of the beetleFirst Remedy One quart of softsoap to two gallons of water heated tothi boiling point when one pint ofcrude carbolic acid is added stirringthe solution well at the same timeThis should be applied early in Juneand again some weeks later with acloth or scrubbing brush to the trunkand base of large limbs being carefulnot to sprinkle the foliageRemedy Second Paint the trunk andbase of large branches with coal tarApply with brush after warming it alittle not hot It will not hurt thetree but is specially disagreeable toMrs Beetle from

extremelyfarreaching The life f an officer sentto Coventry by his fellows is unendurable and his only chance is to eschangaBut all this is moral suasion onlyand in the end disputes are

crack and thebig hearted plebeian who by the byeis now a general weakened by his exertions was getting worsted so another of the same social status who wasan expert boxer took up the runningHe soon finished off the third manand obligingly offered to take on anyone who sympathized with the trio Bythis means appropriate to their profession these two officers opened thedoor in that regiment to others thanoffshoots of the peerage by whom ithad previously been regarded as a preserveAmong officers exchanging from oneregiment to another is common Onelittle man a lieutenant incurred theenmity of

if it continuedIt so happened that he had also carried his insulting comparisons inta themess and as he wouldnt take adviceand drop it his brother officers tookthe matter into their own hands withthe result that one cold night in February there was a hubbub within the officers quarters a window was presentlyopened and little Joey clad only inhis nightshirt was handed out seizedplaced and held down
