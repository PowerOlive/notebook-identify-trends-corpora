SWIFT & CO.'S WEEKLY PRODUCE
MARKET REVIEW
Poultry movement was very light,
a usual, duiing holiday week.
There is still a 'air amount of poul
try to be moved in some sections,
-o.nd indications point to somewhat
higher values. The demand for
Pressed poultry from the cor.Fuming
trade is very good
Fresh egg production continues
above normal for The time of the
year The egg market will be gov
erned mostly b weather conditions
lor the next sixty days, wTith prob
sbly pretty wide fluctuations in the
-giiTerent markets.
Butter at its present level of
-values is meeting with better dc
atand, and as this demand is mostly
far fresh product, the tendency is
jtor advancing prices.
The demand is also better for
sxorage butter, due to the shortage
of fresh stock.
