BOULDEN.
Our community was startled Fri
day morning when it was learned
that a telegram had been received
announcing the death of Mr. Resin
Baker Boulden, at the home of his
daughter, Mrs. Leonard Morgan West,
in Pueblo, Colo. Mr. Boulden was
seized with an attack of grippe some
weeks ago, and his condition was seri
ous. About a week ago a letter re
ceived from his daughter, Mrs. West,
was to the effect that her father was
much better, and was thought to be
on the road to recovery. His daugh
ter, Mrs. Crouch, received a tele
gram Thursday morning, saying her
father was sinking rapidly, and an
other in the evening announcing his
death. Mr. Boulden was in his 83rd
year, and the larger part of a long
useful life was spent in Millersburg,
the home of his birth. He began life
when a young man as a school teach
er, teaching country schools in Bour
bon, Nicholas, Mason and Bracken
counties. He afterward accepted
work as clerk on steamboats on the
Ohio and Mississippi "Rivers, and held
the honored position of captain on
a government boat during the Civil
War. After the close of the war he
returned to Millersburg and for a
number of years held the office of
Postmaster under part of the admin
istrations of Grant, Hayes, Garfield
and Arthur. After the election of
President Cleveland he gave up the

After the close of the civil war Mr.
Boulden was united in marriage to
Miss Carrie Conway, the eldest
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. James Con
way. Their married life was blessed
with two daughter, Mrs. Leon
ard Morgan West, of Pueblo, Col.,

life long member of the Christian

his long and useful life in Millers

He was a cripple from early child
hood, and though he was never a
man of means, was perhaps the most
useful and one of the best-known
citizens that ever resided here. He
has written more wills, deeds and
contracts, than any one man in Mil

from us for about ten. years his
name is mentioned in public almost

VOCATIONAL
TION.
EDUCA-
At the recent meeting of the North
Middletown Mothers' Club, held in
that city, Secretary Wm. E. Hacker,
of the Paris Commercial Club, de
livered an instructive and compre
hensive address on the subject of
"Vocational Education." In his ad
dress Mr. Hacker emphasized the fact
that "education consists of the full
rounded development of the mental,
moral and spiritual attributes of the
child," and that this development
must be along practical as well as
theoretical lines at the present time.
He stated that this is an age of spec
ialization, and that the "jack-of-all-trades"
will soon be a thing of the
past.
The occasion was a display of boys'
homecraft work as exemplified in the
work done in the Graded School. The

doll's hat. The exhibit was held in

tendance, and great interest was
manifested in the exhibits. Short
talks were made by Rev. F. M. Tinder
and J. O. Evans.
