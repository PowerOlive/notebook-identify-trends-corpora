Itwas filed on Oct. 3, 1725, and It setsforth very clearly that John Everitand Joseph Williams were highwayrobbers. In its succinct legal phrasesthe complaint says that the men formed a partnership for the purpose ofcarrying on business as highwaymen.It was mighty profitable, as wasshown by the fact that Everit suedWilliams for the equivalent of $5,000."being for moneys wrongfully appropriated to defendant's private purse."This was the amount in dispute afterthe partnership had lasted only a year.Then Everit claimed that he discovered that his partner had not made afair division of the spoils. The actionwas adjudged to be a gross contemptof court, and the plaintiff was orderedto pay all costs, while the solicitorsI who served the writ were fined. One, of the solicitors, a man namedpWreathcock. refused to pay the fine.and was sent to prison for six months.Both plaintiff and defendant to the ac- jj tion were subsequently hanged, one atI Tyburn and the other at Maidstone.

Many criminals become so fu-; miliar with the prison routine as tolose all horror of it. In fact, life is soI wretched for certain classes of und.-, sirables in London that they wouldcommit pettj' crimes as a means ofgaining entrance to a prison were itnot for the wholesome fear of ilog-ings.

"The obvious meaning is never the one weshould read into a woman's letter.There is aiways a veiled meaning.Woman makes use of a letter just asshe employs a glance or a smile, in away that is carefully thought out audwith an eye to effect. And. after all,does a woman's hat serve to cover herhead? Does a woman's parasol keepoff the sun? Why, then, should a woman's letter serve to convey her realthoughts to the person addressed, justlike the letters of some honest grocer,who writes, 'I send you five pounds ofcoffee," because he really does sendy.ou five pounds of coffee?"

Creates strength.VARDEN & SON, Scle Agents.Jealous Lexington.Lexington, now a little more than aflag statiaon on th" Louisville & Nashville railroad, through its CommercialClub will make an effort, to induce therailroad company to recognize it as acity of "remunerative and attractiveadvantages" and place it on the Mainline to the South.In a lengthy communi ':tion published in the Lexington hf. Jd Sunday,John G. Cramer, Secii9ry of theCommercial Club of the "nr-it city ofimagination," urges that oody to takeimmediate action with tli..s object inview and -ubmits arguments in greatprofusion as to the benefits Lexingtonwholesale and (retail (merchants couldreap from the surrounding territorythrough which the LL. & N. line extends. Through the article of SecretaryCramer can readily be sent the spiritof jealousy existing among Lexingtonpeople because of the fact Paris isnow the recognized center of the division. Every promise is , given .that assoon as the extenison of the L. & E.is completed Paris will be made theterminus of that line, much to the embarrassment of Lexington who hasawakened to the realization that ithasn't even a ghost of a show to become anything more than a stoppingpoint on this line.In his communication Secretary Cramer overlooks Paris as the center ofthe division and points to Lexingtonas being the only logical place as abase of operation for promoters in thedevelopment of the State's resources,in territory yet unopened by a railroadIn referring to a proposed line fromLexington to Richmond some yearsago, and which was discouraged byLexington people and not allowed logo through he sayB :"Some years ago the Kentucky Central Railroad wanted to build a line direct from Lexington to Richmond inorder to connect Cincinnati and Knoxville, but our enterprising citizens ofthat time discouraged the scheme andwould not allow it to be done. i, I"The consequence was that the Kentucky Central was forced to build asemi-subway from Paris through Win-jChester, to Richmond, which is nowthe teeming main line, crowded withtrains that we want through here.The most expert mathematican in theworld could noi now compute the Jossthat shortsightedness has coHt Lexington since that time. ."We now have an opportunity to recuperate that loss to some extent if wetry."Referring to the "Lexington Terminal" Secretary Cramer says:"The purchase of the. Kentucky Midland makes possible the hauling oftraffic between Louivsille and the Cincinnati and Maysville divisions of theKentucky Central through Paris andGeorgetown, and the "Lexington Terminal" is set back another notch inthe "local yard" class, and yet notone of our citizens has a word to say,or seemingly cares a rap."The Queen & Crescent has 'localized' Lexington and made its big terminals elsewhere, and still not acroak."The wail now goes up after it isrealized what Lexington has lost andthey want to get on the main line.There is a great probability the L. &N. will do as much for it has been given out by ofiicials that this was theoriginal intention.Fruit Prospects.Mr. Hillenmeyer, the noted Fayetiecounty nurseryman, has given out thefollowing concerning the fruit outlookin Kentucky: "Fruit in Central Kentucky is yet uninjured, thanks to therecent heavy sleet. The fruit budswere developed fat a a result of thedays of rising temperature, but thecold wave came in time to check nature's advance and the sleet that followed protected the buds. CentralKentucky is about due for a good fruitcrop, and the old adage of a haevysleet, meanirg a full fruit crop, islikely to be realized. The sleet toldheavily en peach trees and many ayoung tree was almost barren of twigs'when the weight of the ice lifted.Cherriies, pluns, pears, peaches andapples promise abundant j ields, whilethe strawberry crop which last yearwas ruined by a light freeze in May,will prboably, this year, make arecord breaking yield. When the generally accepted theory of setting smallfruits in the spring of the year ardfruit and foilage trees in the fall, isconsidered the surest way, yet gocdresults are obtainable in the spring ofthe year in setting out fruit trees, inthe spring of the year in setting outfruit trees, in the fall. The prunirgseason i3 now en in full olast, in face,it is nearing its clu?e, and jet we venture the assertion that many farmeisand orchard its have neglected this important work.
