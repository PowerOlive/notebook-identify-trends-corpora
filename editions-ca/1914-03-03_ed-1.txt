Examination of the stomach contents of the animals fatally affected eliminating suspicion.The cause of this disease is closelyrelated to the feed, jn the majorityof outbreaks observed in the BlueGrass section and along the Ohio River counties, where it has been themost prevalent, the cause is attributed to moldy or inferior ensilage.Samples of ensilage have been received at the Experiment Station fordetailed study, and Dr. H. Garman reports the presence of molds which areconsidered the cause of forage poison:ing in one of the middle westernStates.Samples of ensilage that proved fatal In different outbreaks were secured by the Station and for the pastthirty days have been fed to an experimental horse. As yet this animal has not suffered from the disease,but inasmuch as the animal used inthis experiment is aged and as suchanimals possess much natural resistance that young and growing animalsdo not, just conclusions cannot bedrawn.The disease has occurred morecommonly in horses and mules whereensilage was the principal food. Ensilage of a high grade can be fedto horses and mules with both safetyand profit, but when tainted or inferior, ensilage should be fed very sparingly to any class of live stock. Cattle, however, are not so subject to itsill effects as are horses and mules.The practice of feeding ensilage tothe latter must be carried on withcare, and careful inspection of theensilaget must be made at" each feeding time in order to discard all inferior portions. It should not be fedearly in the morning or late in theevening when it is impossible to detect the spoiled and mrerior feed.There seems to be but little doubtthat this trouble could be wholly eliminated, or partially so, by the correctconstruction of the silo, as a majorityof the outbreaks have occurred wherethe silo was improperly built. Allsilos should be covered. The silo expert may not concede that this is essential, but our observations lead usto believe that this is an excellentprecaution. Any growth of mould ordecomposition in the upper layers ofthe silage will be carried downwardby rain and continue ho spoil the ensilage. The elimination of the losses, whichthis year will approximate 25,000,lies therefore, in prevention. Someoutbreaks have occurred followingthe feeding of moldy corn or hay, allof which must be discarded and destroyed if the loss is to be entirely prevented. Animals suffering from forage poisoning do not as a rule resnond readily to treatment. This wasshown In the outbreak of 1912, whenonly 34 cattle were saved from the134 affected; 147 horses out of 612 affected; 16 mules out of 115 affected.On the appearance of the disease acomplete change of feed and quartersis quite essential, and each animalshould be given a laxative to rid theintestinal canal of its contents andprevent the development of othercases.For further information on this sub- iject. address,E.

The real issue is one oflaw."The plaintiffs will carry the case backto the Court of Appeals.As this case is one of general interest we give the opinion in full:Clark Circuit Court.D. S. Gay Et Al., Plaintiffsvs.N. Ford Brent, Defendant.OPINION AND JUDGMENT.Since this case was before the Courtof Appeals and that tribunal held(149 Ky., 615) that the answer andamended answerfpresented a good defense to the plaintiffs' claim, therehave been two jury trials of the case,both juries failing to agree npon averdict.On the first trial, influenced largelyby what the trial judge conceived to bethe views of the Court of Appeals, asexpressed in Merchants Ice & ColdStorage Co. vs. Rohrman, 138 Ky., 530,he instructed the iury to find for thedefendant, "If they (the jury) believed from the evidence that the plaintiffs,Gay, E. F. Spears & Sons, and Wilson,formed a pool, trust, combine, confederation or agreement for the purposeof controlling the market and fixingand regulating the price of bluegrassseed, and that plaintiffs bought the carload of seed in question in furtheianceot, and as a part of, such plan, pool,trust, combine, confederation or agreement, if any, to control the market, andhx and regulate the price of bluegiassseed."This instruction presented the viewof the law then con1 ended for by defendants' c ounsel, while counsel for theplaintiffs urged that the instructionshould have embraced the idea, thatbefore the juiy could find for the defendant, they must believe, that thepurpose of the plaintiffs was to enhancetne price oi Diuegrass seea Deyonu ltireal value.Before the case was again tried, theCourt of Appeals in the case ofGathright vs. H. M. Byllesby & Co.,154 Ky., 106, made this pronouncement: "Under the law of Kentuckyas it exists to-day there is no prohibition against the formation of trusts,or monopolies, but that they are liable to a fine if they sell their products above or below their real value,such real value to be fixed by a jury.The law has so stood since 1906, without change by the Legislature, asmust be accepted as the public policyof the State upon the subject." TheCourt added: "When properly construed and applied, we do not findanything in Stites vs. Norton, 125Ky., 672 or in Merchants Ice & ColdStorage Co. vs. Bohrman, 138 Ky., 530,and kindred cases relied upon by theplaintiffs, that can take this case outof the operation of the rule laid downbv the act of 1906."

Stoll Oil Co.Lexington, Ky.Refinery at Warren, Pa.(149 Ky., 403) wrote the opinion inthe Brent-Gay case.The Court of Appeals in' this BrentGay case distinguished the defensemade in this case from the defensepermitted under the anti-trust statutes. It says: "Nor do we find it necessary in disposing of the case to consider at all tho anti-trust statutes ofthe State. Leaving out of view entirely the applicability of the anti-truststatutes, we think the controlling anddecisive question in the case is "didthe averments of the answer, whichmust be treated as true, state the detense of the unlawful and unreasonable restraint of trade upon whichBrent was entitled to introduce evidence and have a decision on themerits." Again in the same case,quoting from the Opinion in Merchants Ice & Cold Storage Companycase, the Court says: "If a contract ismade that suppresses competition, andcontrols the market, and that contractis entered into betweo(a those who havetheretofore engaged in competition inthe market sought to be controlled, itis a contract in restraint of trade.It may be more. It may amountto a, trust, or conspiracy, ormonopoly, but it is -nevertheless acontract in restraint of trade. To restrain trade is the essential featureof the contract the reason why itwas made. If trade that is in competition, could not be restrained, thepromoters would not go into thescheme; and when such a contractis made, whatever form it may assume, or by whatever name it may becalled, and although it may be reached under the law of monopolies, trustsand conspiracies, it will be declaredvoid as being in unreasonable restraint of trade." The Court againreferring to the agreement betweenGay and his associates says: "Nor dowe think that in ruling that thescheme of Gay and Company was anagreement in restraint of trade, wehave unduly extended the scope ofthe principle upon v.TiIch. the doctrinerests. It is true that by the commonlaw contracts treated as being in restraint of trade were limited to contracts having for their purpose thepurchase of some trade or business, asa part of which the seller agreed notto engage in the trade or business hehad disposed of. But in dealing withconditions brought about by modernbusiness methods, it has been foundnecessary for the public's good toextend the common law prohibitionagainst contracts in restraint of tradeto states of cases involving more thanthe mere purchasing and selling of atrade or business, so as to give theCourts, for the good of the public, authority to prevent as much as possible combinations and arrangementshaving for their purpose the creationof a monopoly, the control of prices,and the suppression of competition."Proceeding the Court says: "Lookingnow to the case we have, we find thatunder the admitted averments of theanswer Gay and his associates conceived the plan of controlling the bluegrass seed of the country, and of fixing and regulating the price of theuseful article, and, in pursuance ofthis plan, which had as one of its chiefpurposes the restraint of trade andthe suppression of competition inthis article by competitors, theysought to secretly secure from Brentformed to what the trial judge had nd Qther aeal&rs in Diue grass seedconceived to be the true rule, and onthe second trial of wie case, the jurywere instructed to find for the defendant "if they (the jury) believed froma sufficient quantity of the seed to enable them to effectually carry outtheir scheme to restrain and monopolize." The Opinion concluded withenforce his contract would be to depart from the principles that havebeen expressly recognized by thisCourt in the Rohrman case, as well asin Arctic Ice Co. vs. Franklin Electric & Ice Co., 145 Ky., 32; Commons vs. Meadows, 332 Ky., 179; Anderson vs. Jett, 89 Ky., 375, and othercases."We sell the celebratedAuto OiL'No CarbPILES!

He failed tocarry that burden, for he failed to geta verdict from either jury, 'mat iactalone would have gret weight in influencing the trial jude, now a trierof the facts, to hold that the evidencedoes not sustain the defense presented by the instructions above quoted.It may be fairly found from the evidence, that the purpose of the plaintiffs was not to enhance the price ofhiup ctsrs seed beyond its real value,but to create a stapve market for thisproduct, and enable the producers toI realize a fair and reasonable price forfit. That is the view that the trial,M c innHnprt tn acceDt as war-In the case of the International Harvester Company of America vs. Commonwealth, 137 Ky., 668, the Court ofAppeals said; It is not true that allcombinations of producers are illegal,or even wrong or hurtful. Co-operationis as essential in many kinds ofbusiness as is competition. In nearlyevery business it is practiced, and hapbeen in some form or other since society was organized. The legislativeaction was not aimed to prevent cooperation. It was aimed against monopoly. Therefore it is not enough,under a prosecution under our Statute, to show that mere has been acombination among producers of theirproducts or plants. Human nature isuch that we must know the combination was intended to improve the affairs of those entering into it. Theyexpected to make more money out offiion tiiAv mafle Deiore. aiicu.sented. The real issue is one o"law.Theparties having requested a separation of the findings of law andfact, the following findings of law aresubmitted:1. The present law of Kentucky is,that for any pool, trust, combine, confederation or agreement for the purpose of controlling the market or fixing the price of a commodity to violate the Statute against pools, trustsand conspiracies, the purpose must beshown to be to fix the price of thecommodity either above or below itsreal value.2. The Kentucky Statute againstpools, trusts and conspiracies doesnot apply to contracts in restraint oftrade.3. Contracts in restraint of tradeare controlled by the common law andwhen they are unreasonable, they aredeclared to be void.4. A contract entered into between those who have theretoforeengaged in competition with referenceto ,any particular product or commodity, which suppresses competitionand controls the marxet with .reference to that product or commodity, isin unreasonable restraint of trade;and this suppression is not repuired tobe total in order to ring it within thecondemnation of the law.5. When the enforcement of an executory contract would be a step inthe perfection of a scheme to restraintrade in a product or commodity, thelaw will not aid the perfection ofsuch a scheme by enforcing such anexecutory contract.The following facts are found:1. Thesale 'of defendant to Pruntywas for the benefit of the plaintiffsand Prunty acted as their undisclosedagent.2. The fair cash value of the carload of seed in question at Paris, Ky.,in September, 1906, vas $814.23 morethan it came to at the contract priceof $1.30 per bushel.3. It was not the purpose of theplaintiffs in entering into the writtenagreement of June 1, 1906, to fix theprice of blue grass seed above or below its real value.4. Thepurpose of the parties in entering into that agreement was to establish a stable market for blue grassseed, and thereby enable the producers to realize a fair and reasonableprice for it.5. The effect of that agreementand what was done under it by theplaintiffs was to substantially suppress competition in the purchase andsale of blue grass seed.6. The purchase of the car load ofseed from defendant was a part of ascheme of plaintiffs to control theblue grass seed market and makeeffective the agreement of June 1,1906.It follows from these views andthese findings of law and fact that thedefense of unreasonable restraint oftrade has been sustained by the defendant, and it is therefore adjudgedthat the petition be dismissed, andthat the defendant, N. Ford Brent, recover of the plaintiffs, David S. Gay,'E. F. Spears & Sons and J. S. Wilson,his costs herein expended.To the second, third, fourth andfifth findings of fact, the plaintiffs except; and to make judgment dismissing the petition and adjudging the defendant's cost against them they alsoexcept.To the first finding of law, and thefirst, second, third and fourth findings of fact, the defendant excepts.And it is further ordered that theparties are hence dismissed withoutday.BSHUHMHKrJSi!zuiTO WfHTER PURCHflHERSrIf you are looking for a goodSuit or Overcoatat reasonable prices for Fall and Winter,.

The Opinion inthe Brent-Gay case quotes copiouslyfrom the opinion in the Rohrmancase, which was also written byJudge Carroll. While the opinion inthis latter case discusses vigorouslyand thoroughly the question of contracts in restraint of trade, it will notbe necessary for the purpose of thiscase to do more than make one quotation from it to answer the suggestion that the purpose of Gay and hisassociates was a laudable one, beingto establish a stable market for bluegrass seed, ana tnat tnereiore sucnan arrangement should not be condemned by law. Answering a similarsuggestion, the Court, in the Rohrmancase, said: "The argument is furthermade that the contract should be upheld because the purpose of the purchaser was only to economize in thecost of producing and selling ice, andprevent competition that was destructive to the conduct of the business,and not to fix regulate, or raise theprice of the article. And it is true,there is no evidence that any attemptwas made to raise the price of ice.But the mere fact that no effort wasmade to control or fix or raise theprice has little to do with the question. It is the purpose to control themarket and suppress competition thatconstitutes the essential vice in thecontract."The trial judge is frank to say, thatwhen .e first read the opinion of theCourt of Appeals in the GathrightByllesby caEe, in favor of the plaintiffs, and that when this case was firstargued and submitted to him, he wasstill of that opinion, but a carefulstudy of the Opinion of the Court ( ofAppeals m tne Jarent-uay case, wnerethat court has under consideration theidentical contract upon which the defense to this action is based, zvnd ineffect condemned it as being in restraint of trade, requires him tochange his" original view, and constrains him to hold that the unreasonable restraint of trade, as that doctrine has been extended and declaredby the Court of Appeals of Kentucky,has been sustained.The evidence has not been discussed in this opinion, for the reasonSIlin BlemishesMEZHEED'a Parts Odorless Cleaning Co.
