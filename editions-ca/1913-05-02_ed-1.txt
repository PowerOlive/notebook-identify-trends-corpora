B. M. Shive of Paris.Miss Howell is the daughter of Mrs.Hattie Howell j and an 'accomplished:young woman while Mr. Shackelfordis a prominent young -farmer.2 Oeoi the most disasterous fires involving the loss of blooded mares thatever occurred in the Blue Grass tookplace at an early .hour Tuesday morning at Kingston Farm, ""fif Fayettecounty, resulting in the death of fifteen of the best bred and most valuable mares in the It lute Grass togetherwith their foal. Fourteen of the fifteen mares were the property of thelate James R Keene, and the otherFlying Ship, was owned by E. F. Clay,Jr., of Paris. Her foal was by Plaudit. The youngsters from the Keenemares were the get of the Keene stallions Ben Brush, Voter, Gisguse, Delha, Sweep-and Peter Pan. Bv thetime the fire was noticed, it was toolate to save any of the horses then inthe barn: but two of the mates, Dominoes and'Oleiva. that had been in thebarn, were outside, which seemed im-' possible, unless they had been led out,and this led to the beliet that tne nrewas probably of incendiary origin orcaused try some tramp sleeping thereor by a thief who was stealing teed.The loss is an especially large one,coming as it does just at the timewhen the breeding and racing of thethoroughbred seem likely to assumesomething like their old i time proportions, and with the scarcity i of reallyhigh class thorughbreds left on thisside of the Atlantic, the value of thislot would Jhave been great and indeedbenig placed conservatively in theneighborhood of $100,000.

Supposingyou feed a hen which weighs 3.5pounds 3.25 ounces of wheat a day."Of course, a hen of that weightwould not long consume its weightof wheat alone. Supposing, further,then the hen uses 2.75 ounces of thatfor the maintenance of the body; thatleaves half an ounce to be conveyedinto eggs, assuming that all food isdigested, which, of course, is not thecase. In half an ounce of wheat thereis about .06 of an ounce of protein.So that assuming that the hen consumes and digests 3.25 ounces ofwheat per day: and that she uses2.75 ounces of that for maintenanceof her body, there is available eachday just one-fourth enough egg protein for an egg."In other words, it will take fourdays to get the necessary amount ofprotein for one egg. But the egg hasother constituents; so has wheat. Thehalf ounce of wheat contains aboutone and one-half times as much carbohydrates and fat as one egg contains. The hen fed on wheat alonehas a surplus of one material. Inother words, she has enough carbohydrates and fat to make an eggand a half day, but she has only protein enough to make one egg in sixdays. You place the hen in an awkward position by feeding her wheatalone."Wheat does not contain the eggmaking materials in proper proportion. Corn is even worse than wheatin this respect."HANDY FOR THE P0ULTRYMANPowerful Lamp Arranged in Apparatus Invented by Indiana ManShows State of Eggs.At their present price eggs occupythe same relation to foods that diamonds do to jewels, and because ofthe price that any old egg will bringgood, fresh eggs are all the harderto get.

Six years afterward I met him at Budapest and hereminded me of the incident. He hadremembered my face."It was on his coronation day, however, that I first saw him as emperor.I remember it was a warm June dayin 1867, and he had assumed the titleof king of Hungary. He was seatedon a white charger shod with gold, adozen orders blazed on his breast inthe sunlight, and, urging his horse tothe top of a mound, he waved hissword to the four corners of the compass and uttered the coronation oathto protect the kingdom from all invaders. "Now, please follow me closely.Had Franz Josef declined to do thi3,had he taken his seat on the throneas emperor of Austria only, he wouldprobably have been assassinatedwithin a short, space For your Magyar is a man who when he hates Isthe worst enemy on earth, and theInhabitants of Hungary had got it intotheir heads that Franz Josef meant togrind down the Hungarians beneaththe Austrian heel."No man, however, brilliant a diplomat he may be, can exceed the emperor as far as his hold upon thesetwo nations is concerned, and directly he dies there will he, politiciansdeclare, a sharp move on the part ofa certain European empire in thenorth for war between Austria andHungary, it is not ill health alonethat binds the emperor to his palaceso much as the fear that his absencefrom the territory will be like removing the buffer that keeps two enemiesapart."I wonder how many secrets ofsuch import that any of the biggestnewspapers in Europe would pay aking's ransom to secure a single copyfor publication are locked in that little egrlot wood cabinet in the emperor's study."The house of Hapsburg has eversince his accession been absolutelydogged by disaster.

The duke of Connaught,accompanied by his wife and daughter,left Canada recently for England, andit 1b generally understood here that hewill not return to Ottawa, though asyet there has been no official announcement to that effect The duke1b known to have a strong and sincereliking for Canada, and doubtless wouldbe pleased to remain there anothertwo years. But the climate apparently,has never agreed with the duchess ofConnaught and, in view of this fact,it is believed certain that the dukehas now practically ended his tenureof office as governor general of thedominion.The question as to who will benamed to succeed the duke of Connaught at Ottawa has become a subject of lively speculation here. Thenames of half a dozen prominent persons have been mentioned, amongthem at least two close connections ofthe royal family. But the best authorities seem to agree that the young earlof Beauchamp has the inside track andis most likely to win the race. He hasthe backing of the cabinet, whichshould count 99 points in his favor.Lord Beauchamp is at present firstcommissioner of works, a position involving mainly the care of all nationalbuildings and royal palaces, and theholder of which is also a cabinet minister. For a man of his years he hasjust passed forty his career has beenDuke of Connaught.one of rather unusual distinction. Atthe age of twenty-four he was mayorof the city of Worcester, and before hehad reached his twenty-eighth birthday he was governor of New SouthWales, one of the most desirable officesof its kind in the gift of the crown.As governor of New South Wales heis said to have displayed executiveability of a high order.In conclusion, it may be said thatLord Beauchamp is of a very piousturn of mind. He has always takenan active interest in school and Sunday school work, and in his youth hecarried his enthusiasm so far as to appear in the role of a street preacher.The Canadian post, there is littledoubt, would be highly acceptable tothe Countess Beauchamp, who is asister of the immensely wealthy dukeof Westminster, and before her marriage, some ten years ago, was LaryLettice Grosvenor. She has alwaystaken a keen interest in her husband'spolitical work.It is rather an interesting conincidence that one of her warmest friendsis Princess Patricia of Connaught, whohas been a frequent visitor to Madresfield court, near Malvern, the beautiful home of Lord and Lady Beauchamp. Their eldest son, ViscountElmley, is nine years old, and theyhave four other children.USES "DUMMY" TO FLEE JAILMan Sought for Two Years forFrauds Escapes to CanadaIn Auto.MallCleveland, O. By placing a "dummy" in his cot and by sneaking out acellar window, James H.

The escape wasspectacular. When an accomplicebrought a plate of chop suey at midnight from a neighboring restaurant,McNicholas, who had been allowedthe freedom of the "bull pen," riggedup a dummy, placed It on his cot, andthen sneaked down the cellar stairs.The accomplice then left the jail, obtained an auto and waited outside.McNicholas forced a cellar window,got to the aato and fled.Klg-rallBifisa'sflflSSKWBfsBBHBHHsSBBIBllllVBllV&V2n9BwfisWw9HBHsillllllllllMIErSsi&flBsSSinBBHSHuHBBlllllllVPAINTSGBEBPEBProperty Owners In Parisand Bourbon CountyCan Save Big Money byTaking Advantage ofThese Prices.Onr new paint department is nowready for business.

Prince Wilhelm ofSweden and his charming wife, Princess Marie, a daughter of Grand DukePaul Alexandrowich, uncle of theczar, have become baseball "fans,"with the intention of interesting theofficers of the capital and their wivesin the sport.For many years the prince has beenrated a keen, football player, makinghis fellow 'countrymen realize that thespring and autumn months should beutilized with games, as well as thewinter days, when skiing, snowshoeing and skating are the "pastimes.But with the advent of the lastOlympic games, in the capital camethe great American game of baseball.Daily the prince and his wife couldbe seen in the midst of an interestedgroup of nobility watching the American athletes play.As the prince watched Thorpe andhis colleagues pitching and battingthe ball he would grow greatly excited, picking up the American "fan"phrases and urging on the men. Theprincess, too, would follow the intricacies of the game, now and then questioning her royal hueband on themeaning of certain plays.So when Prince Wilhelm started abaseball club his wife at once beganto interest her friends. Every day atthe practice of her husband's team,which was one of the four organizedPrincess Marie of Sweden.in the capital, the princess, dressed ina manner that has won her the titleof the "most smartly gowned woman"of Norway, Sweden and Denmark,would be in the bleachers learningthe fine points of the game.The entire country then grew interested in baseball, since it had, as itwere, received royal sanction, andsoon Malmo, that quaint and churchlytown, was ringing with the enthusiasm of the new sport and a team wasat once formed. Upsala, too, venturedinto this recently learned game, andthe rivalry of the two cowns becamemost intense.With the sanction of the prince, aleague has been formed and baseballis bound to become as popular inSweden as it has in America. Theprincess delights especially in havingwith her at all the games the wivesand 'daughters of the American minister and the attaches of the legationin Strandvagen. Her pretty Englishis becoming charmingly studded withphrases such as one hears at everygame of baseball in America, and herknowledge of the game is very nearlyas great as that of Prince Wilhelm.ONCE HOUSED QUEEN'S MAIDSGumiey Cottage, Near London, With-Its Quaint Rooms, Is forSale.London.

'.,WOMEN, DDGE JURY DUTYSex Shown by Kansas Example toStand on Same Plane s Men DcNot Seek Superiority.Toledo, O. Advocates of equalrights for women must have felt immensely encouraged by the news thatthe women of equal rights Kansaswere dodging jury service. It wasone more proof that women stood upon the same plane in nature as men.It was additional evidence that difference of sex did not necessarilymean that that which was irksome tomen was enjoyed by women.Save those few score men who cansit for wearisome hours in a chairand never squirm and who can keepawake in a courtroom at the wage thecounty establishes, there is no civicduty more warranted to Tender mensuddenly deaf, surprisingly biased inopinion and calloused in the matter ofminor patriotism than receiving notice to appear for jury service. Citizens who will not dodge taxes rarities worthy of special distinctionwill yet search their souls for excusesthat will keep them out of the jurybox. Occupations which are ordinarilyheld in little esteem by the occupantsthereof acquire remarkable valuewhen it is learned that they exemptone from jury' service. To get aroundthe subpoena sometimes entails tremendous expenditure of energy andthe exercise of much ingenuity. Yetthe labor is held well worth whilewhen successful.It might have been expected thatwomen would delight to show a superiority to men, when, as in Kansas,they have acquired the privilege ofsitting-on juries. But this is no partof the true equal rights' movement.The serious-minded feminist do notwish to demonstrate superiority onlyequality. This news from Kansasshows they have won another scrimmage for the cause.CANNIBALS LIVED IN BOSTONProfessor Harvey W. Shimer FindsActual First Settlers RelishedHuman Beings.Boston. That New England's prehistoric man who antedates the oldest inhabitants from 3,000 to 10,000years, was a cannibal and of theorang-outang type, is the contentionof Harvey W. Shimmer, assistant professor of palentology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Professor Shimer has unearthedstrange utensils and remains in ashell mound at Ipswich which showthat the earliest ' type there dweltfrom 3,000 to 5,000, and perhaps 10,000years ago, less than 40 miles fromthe heart of Boston.At Ipswich also pieces of brokenbones of a human victim that, Professor Shimer declares, was undoubtedly being sacrificed to gratify a cannibal appetite, were found.Professor Shimer said: "There werea number of bones broken into shorter pieces human bones which indicate that the earliest type of manwas a cannibal."At another kitchen-midden, whichI explored at Gardner's Island, off theLong Island shore, I found that theremains of a great auk, a bird now extinct, and pottery utensils made Inthe most primitive fashion, whollyunlike the European prehistoric pottery, indicating that these early people lived here before the invasion ofthe European types."CHURCH FOLK JOIN SCRAPJapanese Butler, With Jlu-Jitsu, HoldsPolicemen and Presbyteriansat Bay.New York.
