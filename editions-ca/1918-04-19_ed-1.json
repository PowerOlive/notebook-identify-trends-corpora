DEATHS.
HEDGES.
The funeral of Mr. Edward B.
Hedges, aged sixty-nine, who died in
a Cincinnati hospital after a long
illness due to throat
trouble, was
held at his late residence on Stone r
avenue yesterday afternoon at 2:30
o'clock, with services conducted by
Rev. W. E. Ellis, pastor of the Paris
Christian church, assisted by Rev.
J. T. Sharrard, of Paris. The inter
ment followed in the Paris Cemetery,
with committal services at the
grave by the Knights of Pythias and
Masonic lodges, of which he was a
member.
Mr. Hedges was one of the beat
known traveling men in this section,
representing several of the largest
packing houses in the country. He
was the son of the late Samuel and
Rebecca Moran Hedges, who reside.!
on the Cane Ridge pike, near Paris
in the home now occupied by Mr. J.
W. Ockerman. For several years he
was in the revenue service as store
keeper and guager under the admin
istration of President Grover Cleve
land. He was a member of the Paris
Christian church, and was prominent
in fraternal circles, having been a
member of the local Masonic and
Knights of Pythias lodges.
Mr. Hedges had been in failing
health for several months, and sev
eral operations for throat trouble
had been performed at a Cincinnati
hospital in hope of giving liim relief,
but to no avail. After the last op
eration his physicians gave up hope
of restoring their patient, and his
family were so advised. His death
occurred at four o'clock Tuesday
morning. The body was brought to
his late residence on Stoner avenue
in this city Tuesday evening.
Mr. Hedges is survived by his
widow, Mrs. Mariammi Hildretl
Hedges, and one daughter, Mr:.
Samuel Biggs, of Huntington, W.
Va., also by one sister, Miss Letitiu
Hedges, of this county, and one
brother, Mr. Jos. Hedges, of Pewee
Valley, Ky.
The pall-bearers were: Active
Edward Prichard, Wolf oik Ewalt,
Joseph. Ewalt, Will Grimes, Erskin
Spillman and Frank Clay; Honoraiy
L. J. Fretwell, Arthur Calvert,
John Roseberry, Asa Jewell, James
E. Kern, Warren Rogers, Dr. J. T.
Brown and Dr. J. M. Williams.
BETTER RESPECT LAW AND
AVOID TROUBLE.
That no mercy or favor will he
shown violators of the game and fish
laws was evidenced in the County
Court when County Judge George
Batterton assessed c. fine of $23.50
against J. N. Crockett, of the coun
ty, who had been placed under ar
rest by County Game Warden Doug
las Thomas, Sr., on a charge of Il
legal fishing in Stoner creek. Crock
ett entered a plea of guilty to the
charge.
Many persons seem to be under
the- impression" that the recent Leg
islature repealed the game and. fish
laws, which is" a great mistake, and
one that is apt to get them in seri
ous trouble. It is still unlawful to
take fish from the streams of Bour
bon county in any way (even with a
minnow net, save getting minnows
for bait) except by hook and lim.
Any one catching or attempting to
catoh fish in any other way except
by hook and line or by, trot liner,
are subject to a fine of from $15 to
$100, in the discretion of the Court.
Hunters must still take out a license
to hunt, except to hunt on their
own premises.

to pillory the German leaders in such
fashion, but then it has to be done.

AN APPEAL TO PATRIOTIC PARIS
PEOPLE.
To the People of Paris:
W,e are warned from Washington
there is a serious food 'crisis ahead,
for our own people, unless food pro
duction is promptly and greatly in
creased. There is already an acute
food crisis in Italy and France.
The dire needs of their people must
be relieved by our Government if
they are to support their brave men
in the trenches. If they fail, wi
fail; if their lines are broken, hun
dreds of thousands of our boys
"over there" will be slaughtered
No starved army, no starved natioii
can fight.
We are assured that the people
of the towns of America can easily
raise enough food, in yards and out
lying lots to release for our haid
pressed Allies all they need.. Will
we do it? The answer to that ques
tion is up to the people of eveiy
American town; up to every citizen
in it; up to your town and you.
There would hare been a far more
serious shortage fn food supplfp;?
the past winter but for the increas
ed home garden last year. But this
year, they must be -multiplied manv
time to avert suffering here and
ruin abroad.
No family of limited means can
afford this year to be without a gar
den. Food will be hard to get in
many places, at any price, for rail
roads and shipping will be straineJ
as never before, to meet war needs,
and foods from a distance cannot he
depended on. Fortunately garden
production is quick-.
There are many thousands of vil
lages, towns and cities in this coun
try. In and about nearly every on
of them there are idle lands that can,
be gardened and men, women, boys
and girls who have the strength and,
can take the time to do it. In praq-
tically every one- of them there aii
people who understand how to do Jt
and can direct those, who do not, and'
teams, implements, manures and oth-i
er needed things. Shall these vat
human, land and other productive'
means, in and about our thousanag
of towns, he wasted, w.hen the fate
of our Allies, the fate of our own
brave soldiers and the fate of this
nation depend on their being used
to produce food? That question,
Mr. Hoover tells us, depends on th2
American people, upon us and yoI
If the people of American towns
have not got men and women intel
ligent enough to realize the need Zor
action and patriotic enough to or
ganize, on their own account, and get:
action and results, we may expect
disaster. Shall our children an-i
our children's children say we threw
away the liberty our ancestors won
for us and them?
This Committee, serving under
our able, strenuous and patriotic
Food Administrator, Mr. Hoover, is
working without pay or funds. We
have accomplished much, but can
do little more than endeavor to
arouse the people to the need of
the hour.

Chairman United States Food Ad
ministrator's War Garden Com

RIGHT YOU ARE!
Editor James Allen strikes the
right note in his "Pert and Perti
nent Column" when he writes as
follows:
"We regret to note that American
soldiers in the big battle on th3
WJestern front have taken a few
prisoners. There ought to be no Ger
man prisoners, when the Germans
have been cutting the throats of
American boys who fell into their
hands."
