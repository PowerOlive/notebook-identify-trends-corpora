F. Bryant, Kentucky agent of the U. S. Bureau ofCrop Estimates, and W. C. Hanna,State Commissioner of Agriculture.Oats are estimated at 11,585,000bushels, compared to 9,900,000bushels produced last year; potatoes6,523,000 bushels compared to 5,040,000 last year; sweet potatoes1,633,000 bushels, compared to 1.6S0.000; barley 11,000 bushels,compared to 100,000; apples 5,223,000 bushels, compared to 1,4 SO,000: peaches 1,560,000 bushels,compared to 726,000 bushels lastyear; and sorghum for sirup 3,039,000 gallons, compared to 2,542,000made last ye?r.All these forecasts are subject tcrevision upward or downward laterin the season, depending on whetherconditions are favorable or unfavorable for proper matuiity.The lecent weather will have atendency to increase the tobaccoestimate, while the damage Xromrust and "wildfire" may 'tend slightly to reduce it. The excitement. overdamage from rust and "wildfire"apparently has caused over-estimatesof the percent of damage to thecrop as a whole, although individuallosses may be severe, even complete in some cases. The State'stotal tobacco acreage is about 10percent less than last year, representing a heavy cut in acreage inthe Western Kentucky tobacco districts and a big increase of acreagein the burley counties.

One mother had inquiredif he thought it was "catching;"and another asked if the diseasewas confined to school children andwhy to little girls in particular?It is an accented fact that a cer-rtain amount of starch is necessaryfor the formation of bones m tnehuman body, but when we are confronted with a mental picture ofhundreds of little school 'girls, whoare both "starched and berilboned," it opens up an endless avenue of scientific research.I TTlREGULAR BOYS' STORE-THIRD FLOORReal Clothes tor Real5F"v TORSUITS FOR BOYSAll-Wool$15.00 and upCORDUROY SUITS$12 $14 $16They're some suits finematerials and tailored assmartly as any boy couldwish..Kii.SHIRTS FORBOYS$1.50 and upWith collars attached orwithout collars.

The second cropof "clover made a good growth inmany parts ' of the State this year.Despite the fact that eeeds savedwithout a huller are difficult to sowit is, however, practical to save forhome use.The seed should be cut and raked into small windrows as soon asthe seed heads are brow.n and theseed hard and glossy. It i& a goodplan to set the cutter as high aspossible as the apiount of straw tobe handled will- thus be reduced.Put the clover uirder cover when itis thoroughly dried or stack it andcover the stack with straw. Duringthe late winter this material can bespread in a thin, cover over the fieldto be sowft to clover, thus givinga liberal seeding.The seed may be freed from thestraw by running the clover throughthe separator if a grain, separator is available. Although muchof the clover ' seed will still bein chaff' it cr.n be sown withoutmuch trouble; also the chaff seedcan be procured finally by flailingthe seed out by hand. Chaff seedgive just as good results as theclean seed and the only disadvantage in its use; is the difficulty of distribution. It ought to be possible toget attachments fon their machinesfor cleaning clover seed, wherethere is a considerable amount ofclover in a county.
