ALEXANDERIS RELEASED ONBOND OF $50,500Head of Defunct Bank Arrested onThree ChargesGives BondASSIGNS HISPERSONAL ESTATEAffairs of Bank Still in Tanv gled Shape, With Accountants ProbingAs a climax to the closing of thebank of George Alexander & Co., inthis city, last Tuesday, George Alexander, president of the defunct institution, was arrested Friday night onthree statutory warrants, sworn outby 3anking Commissioner ThomasJ. Smith.One of the warrants charged Alexander with misappropriating the bankfunds, another with making false entries and having made false entries. on the bank's books, and in the third' he is accused of having made falsereturns to the State Banking Department Information secured from Bank Examiner John B. Chenault and DeputyCommissioner Rankin Revill, causedMr. Smith to have the warrants issued. He came here Friday- afternoon, and, after meeting witbrthe directors, decided upon that course.The warrants were sworn out beforeCounty Judge C. A. McMillan andplaced in the hands of Sheriff W. F.Talbott Mr. Alexander was placedunder arrest at his home on Pleasant' 'street, shortly after six o'clock,where he was held in the custody of- the officials until bond was arranged,whicn was shortly after 9 o'clock.County Judge McMillan -fixed thebond at $50,500, $25,000 on each of thefirst two warrants and $500 on thefalse statement charge. He was dis-charged from custody after the foli rlowlng had signed his bond: A. H.Hancock, Charlton Clay, O. H. Peddicord. Samuel Clay, John Wiggins,Oscar Taylor, of New York; andCatesby Spears. He appeared beforeJudge McMillan at the court houseFriday evening and through his attor-neys, Talbott & Whitley, waived examination and was held to the grand.jury, which will convene in this city, June S.The people of the city and countywho reposed their trust in GeorgeAlexander will subtain losses that willaggregate more than a quarter milliondollars when the bank failed. Therehas been no demonstration and in theface of the apparent heavy losses,they are not taking it uncomplainingly. There are seven directors of thebank, including Alexander. They areR. B. Hutchcraft, B. P. Claybrook, J.W. Bacon, W. W. Mitchell, J. M.Breilnan and Harry B. Clay. Thebanks' employes were O. L. Davis,Cashier, and Joseph Mitchell. Mr.Davis has been retained by the Banking Commission to assist in straightening out the bank's affairsUndue criticism has been heapedupon the cashier of the institution foraccepting deposits on the day thebank was closed. This, however, isexplained when it is positively knownthat Mr. Davis knew nothing of thecondition of the 1 "ik other than thatwhich his booli howod. He hasbeen retained b. -nidus Commissioner Smith and Ex it"-er Chenault.He declares he knew 'oiNig pi several business transaction . regardingAlexander's private affairs.The depositors and other creditorsof the bank number approximatelyone thousand, and notices were print-ed Saturday by direction of SpecialBanking Commissioner Woodford andattorney John J. Williams, the latteracting as attorney for the State.The officers declare it will be several days before the exact conditionsare known, and as soon as possibleit will be given to the public. Further than this they will give out nostatement of the situation and developments, if any, will be very slowuntil the books are gone over and all-of the affairs straightened out by theaccountants.There has been an inclination onthe part of many to criticise the directors, charging negligence, but thereis, according to reliable information,no grounds for such accusations. Oneof the directors stated that the bankexaminers who would come twice a3rear would examine the books in thepresence of the President and directors and make the report that theaffairs were straight.' Suits in large numbers are certainto be instituted and scores have employed council and one local attorneyhas amounts aggregating almost $100,000 for collection.The directors are good for everydollar of the loss if it is held by thecourts that George Alexander, asPresident, had their sanction to signmade to individuals without propersecurity.The directors are denying that theygave any such sanction and that theyhad any knowledge of many of Alexander's largest transactions. Thestock of the bank was held to the extent of 51 per cent, by Alexander andthe members of his family.He personally had 187 of the 400shares, E. P. Claybrook was the nextlargest stockholder. He had 27shares. Mrs. Harry B. Clay, as trustee for her sister, Mrs. Frank Clay,had 19 shares and Harry B. Clay had4 shares.The holdings of other directorswere in sblocks of 5 to 10 shares,while the remainder of the stock washeld in 1, 2 and 3 shares by small investors. Under the law the stockholders willbe required to put up $100 a share inaddition to its original cost to them,which in the greatest number of instances was $250 a share.Depositors who have been veryhopeful of securing at least 50 centson the dollar have about given up,as it has been found the condition ofthe bank is much worse than first anticipated. There has been some talkof forcing Alexander into involuntarybankruptcy, with a view of gettingdeeper into the situation.Mr. Alexander several days agomade an assignment to Samuel Clay,his nephew. Mr. Clay appeared before County Judge C. A. McMillanyesterday and waived his right toqualify as the assignee. There hasbeen no mention of any one to takecharge of the assigned estate.A list of the liabilities and assetsof the individual estate .of GeorgeAlexander were filed Saturday withCounty Clerk Pearce Paton.

No oneknows the Mexicans better than heno one knows the country and theconditions of warfare better."Two things Ave must keep in mindthe Mexican climate the heat thatwithers a white mai and the certainty that Mexicans, instead of fightingin the open, will take to the mountains, where artilery can't penetrate,and there are the places men afootmust pick their way," said WylieSmith."Reaching down into Western Mexico are the Sierra Madre Monutains,the Mother's Teeth they mean literally, which are a continuation of theRocky Mountains. They rise in broken and high peaks in the counties ofSonora, Chihuahua, Durango, Sinaloaand Guerrero."During a let-up in our fighting,when I was down there I got newsthat the Pacific Coast Magazine coulduse a story about Zapata, a namewhich means 'Shoe,' the man whomade it his business always to fightagainst the Government, and the fellow who had himself fortified in thehill in a way that reminded me ofthe Doones. But I didn't see' anyLorna there."He had 3,500 men camped in aplace in the mountains that made aperfect dipper. There was only oneway of getting in and going out, andit was a passage only about 50 feetwide, narrow, rugged, steep, up whicha man could climb only slowly. AndZapata had machine guns trained onthis monutain pass and obstacles inthe way until he, with his 3,500 men,could have held off 100,000."I don't see how you could attackthe fellow, except with airships. Theyare about the only way of getting athim."And believe me he's a fighter. Histrade is fighting, just as that of theother mountain bandits. .When a rebellion is started he joins with therebels. When it succeeds he startsanother rebellion."On the way up a guide I had toldme a story about the 'Shoe' thatwasn't nice to hear when I was soonto be Zapata's guest."Zapata demanded tribute from arich rancher in that neighborhood.The fellow answered with courtesies,but no money."He woke up next morning withZapata at his front door. He foundhimself the next afternoon tied to apost in the middle of a bull pen, hisbody out of reach, but his legs lowenough to be gored."Red cloth was tied around the fellow's legs and soldiers were set totorturing a bull. The beast was turned loose in the pen "and saw the redcloth on the post. Maybe you canguess what happened. The flesh wasgored from the man's legs and hedied as he hung on the post."Did I say that Zapata had broughtthe rancher's wife to the edge of thepen and made her sit there?"That explains to you what thosefellows are utterly merciless, someof them not human. But this fellowZapata was partly a Guerro Indianand that helps to explain him.a ary, aarK-iacea, meager, impassive and yet nervous man I foundhim. And he insisted it seemedfunny to me that he be quoted correctly. He didn't want people to geta wrong impression of him.I want to impress the fact thatMexicans are not cowardly; that theyfight well in their own way, and thatthey can shoot."To illustrate: I'd been with therebels about a year when they choseme to pick out 30 sharpshooters from100 soldiers. I had them set up a traget at 1,000 yards and put them tofiring at it. Not a man made lessthan 30 per cent. Over half of themgot better than 45 per cent, and thefelloV who was selected as Sergeantgot 70 per cent. That man wouldhave killed seven out of ten soldiersat 1,000 yards."I remember ,a time when a smallforce of our rebels attacked a townas a ruse, then retreated, and the Federals came after us. Our men drewthe pursuers into a small, narrowpass with thickets on both sides."They swarmed into the pass, packed it full of men, then we opened fire.Not one of them got away. We shotdown 300 in that place. It's something like this the Mexicans wouldlike to try on our men."FOR A TORPID LIVER."I have used Chamberlain's Tabletsoff and on for the past six yearswhenever my liver shows signs of being in a disordered condition.

Mr. Leer's plan is to construct a concrete track, correspondingto the rails of a railroad or street carline, only instead of steel rails hisidea is to have concrete about 18inches wide, with a slight depressionin which the wheels of the auto willglide smoothly along. This arrangement, he claims, will furnish a solid,substantial track for autopiobiles,and will prevent the rest of the macadam Section of the road being wornout by the speed o the cars. It willhold them in the grooved track.These 18-inch wide strips of concrete, from 3 to 4 feet apart, will bemuch less expensive than to construct the entire roadway with asphalt or brick, as is being done withsome of the country roads in theNorth, notably in the State of Ohio.There are lots of men whose ideaof eternity is the space between onepay day and the next pay day.Most men have to hustle to catchup on the time they -spent loafing andthis gives them a chance to yelpabout how they are being over worked.

Our treaty with Panama notonly recognizes the sovereignty ofrepublic and clearly defines our rightsas a lessee, for which we are to pay$250,000 a year, but it incorporatesthe Hay-Paunceforte treaty. We thusstand with Panama in the relations oflandlord and tenant, and joint guarantors of a treaty with Great Britainwhich many of our public men wouldlike to disregard.In strict law a violation of theHayPaunceforte treaty by the UnitedStates would amount to a forfeitureof the privileges acquired under ourlease at Panama.

Cultivation should begin immediately afterplanting by running once or twiceacross the rows with a weeder or section harrow. After the plants comeup at least two additional cultivationsshould beg iven with either the weeder or harrow in the case of eithercorn or cotton before the regular cultivators are used. Run diagonallyacross the rows with either of theseimplements, using the section harrowwith the teeth slanting backward withan angle of 45 degrees and repeat aweek later at right angles with thefirst cultivation.The use of the weeder or sectionharrow is strongly advised for theearly cultivation of corn, cotton andmany other crops. It is best to usethe weeder on very loose or sandysoils. This early cultivation with theweeder or harrow destroys all younggrass and weeds and leaves the soilin fine condition and the cotton readyfor chopping or thinning. The useof the section harrow for the earlycultivation of corn and cotton in theJSouth is cmparatively recent, but israpidly becoming general. One ofthe great advantages in its use, in ad-dition to the excellent work done, isthe extra amount of land that can becultivated in a given time.You can get used to anything.That's the reason why an ice mandoesn't spend any time on sunnystreet corners waiting for silhouetskirts to pass.You would imagine that a homelygirl would feel complimented whenyou stared at her.

TheI first crop report for the year 19145 I would indicate that this year wouldbe no exception to the rule. Probably never in the history of the Statewas there a more promising outlookfor a "good crop year" than at the beginning of the -season.The wheat acreage of last fall isgiven at 95 and practically none ofthis was plowed up this Spring. Ninety-sevenper cent, of the original sowing was left standing May 1st. Thecondition of this large acreage is 99.This would indicate an unusuallylarge yield of wheat. The originalacreage of rye sown last fall was 95.Rye is used more as a clover cropthan wheat, a large - per cent ofwhich is plowed up in the Spring forcorn or oats. For the last few yearsrye has proven a more profitable cropthan wheat per acre and it is no surprise to find that 82 per cent, of theoriginal acreage is left standing. Theamount of barley originally sown was77 and the condition of both rye andbarley is given at 98. The corn acreage planted is 91 per cent, while 76per cent, of the plowing intended forcorn was done May 1st. Planting isnow in full swing with conditions favorable. Deep plowing has been practiced this year more than ever before.Favorable weather for the next fewweeks will insure a large acreage ofcorn in a first-class seed bed. Theoat acreage planned is given at 89with 80 per cent, of it sown May 1st.While the dark tobacco crop planned is only 79, the condition of plantbeds is given at 96. The acreageplanned of Burley is given at 81 withthe condition of plant beds 91. Thereis some complaint of insects and cutworms injuring the tobacco beds.The pastures are in unusually goodcondition. The condition of bluegrass is given at 93 with every promise of a large crop of blue grass seed.Clover is given at 85, alfalfa 93, andorchard grass at 92.Fruits of all kinds have escapeddestruction by freezing and the apple,cherry and plum crop is unusuallypromising. Pears and peaches suffered some from late frost, especially inthe central part of the State, however,we will have more than three-fourthsof a pear and peach crop. The strawberries are in good condition withpromise of a bountiful yield. Ninetyfive per cent, of a potato crop isplanted.Live stock of all kinds came throughthe winter in good condition. It is estimated that 4 per cent, of the horsesdied in the last 12 months, 3 per cent,of the mules and 3.7 per cent, of thecattle. The loss of sheSp is estimatedat 6 per cent, and lambs at 10 percent. The greatest loss is from hogcholera and it is estimated that 11.3per dent. Of the hogs of the Statewere lost by this disease, some sections of the State being entirely freefrom this disease, while the loss runsas high as 50 per cent, in other sections. This report indicates thatthere is an unusual amount of attention being paid to live stock. Thenumber of brood mares used is increasing and the number of mules used upon the farm decreasing. It isalso worthy of note that a great dealmore attention has been paid to alfalfa this Spring than ever before.The amount of ground limestone usedupon the clover land has greatly increased. Summing up the first report of theyear, one cannot but be impressedwith the determination of the farmers to make the coming crop thegreatest ever grown in the State.J. W.
