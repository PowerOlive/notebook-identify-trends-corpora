90000 in Bogus WarrantsWashington Oct 27 The gradualreplacement on war vessels of the familiar cylindrical boiler by variousforms of the water tube boiler constitutes the most important fact in marine engineering at this time according to Engineer-in-Chief George WMelville who has just published hisannual report to the secretary of thenavy For torpedo boats he says theadvantage of these boilers were soevident that they quickly displaced theold types and have now been used forseveral years exclusively for this kindof craftTouching liquid fuel with whichmany nations are experimenting as asubstitute for coal the report gives aninteresting history of those made inthis country Included in this list isthe test made by the PennsylvaniaRailroad Co about ten years agowhich while proving the practicability of using crude coal oil forfuel for boilers demonstrated that thePennsylvania railroad itself would consume more than one third of the entireoutput of coal oil at that time if it wereused for fuel instead of coalNevertheless the balances of advan tage are so greatly in favor of theliquid fuel for small craft that the bureau expresses the intention of makinguse of coal oil on torpedo boatsCommodore Melville makes a strongargument in favor of building oujships in future in classes so as to secure the great advantages that followthe training of men for whole classesof ships instead of for one vessel andalso the ability to use duplicate partsof machinery It is recommended thatthe machinery of ships laid up in reserve with skeleton crews be subjectedevery six months to a dock trial withfull steam pressure to make sure theyare ready for use at short noticeThe bureau has been making someinquiries as to the possibility of procuring large merchant ships in anemergency to serve as machine shopsfor fleets and having secured a list ofsome suitable vessels now submits anestimate of 25000 for machine tools tobe laid aside for fitting one of them outwhen neededThe engineer-in-chief has a good dealto say in his report on the subject ofpersonnel and he insists that he iswarranted in urging after many yearsof careful observation and study twothings as necessary to the highest efficiency of the engineer corps First anincrease of numbers of the corps from195 officers of all grades to about 300so divided as to the various grades asto give fair promotion Second

government refuses to furnish for publication the text of the note of Spainwhich has been handed to the UnitedStates minister here Gen Stewart LWoodford as an answer to the communication which the general placedin the hands of the duke of Tetaunearly in September last when the latter was minister of foreign affairs onthe subject of the insurrection in theisland of CubaThe United States minister admitshaving received Spains reply to thenote of the United States but he declines to discuss the matter beyondsaying that the text of the Spanishanswer will be immediately transmitted to WashingtonFrom other sources it was learnedthat the officials of the United Stateslegation were engaged Tuesday intranslating Spains answer and it wasreported that the United States minister would cable to Washington Tuesday the full text of the Spanish noteAlthough the government of Spainwill not give out the text of its replyto the United States on the subject ofCuba it was officially announced thatthe reply of the Spanish minister forforeign affairs Senor Gullon is on thefollowing lines It expresses regret atthe fact that the insurrection in Cubareceives support from frequent American filibustering expeditions andthat otherwise the rebellion in Cubawould probably not exist It is hopedby the Spanish government and bygranting autonomy to Cuba and thewithdrawing of American support ofthe insurgents the insurrection willshortly be endedIt is further officially announced thatthe Spanish note is marked throughoutby an energetic toneAccording to the reports in officialcircles here the United States ministerwill confine himself to acknowledgingthe receipt of the Spanish reply andafter forwarding it to the UnitedStates government will request instructions from Washington beforeproceeding any further in the matterWashington Oct 27 Confirmationfrom official sources is given that theSpanish authorities at Madrid delivered to Minister Woodford Mondayevening the answer of Spain to therepresentations of the United Statescontained in Mr Woodfords instructions Under these circumstances it isnot doubted that the United Statesminister has advised the authoritieshere on the essential features of thereply The text of the reply is knownto be very lengthy so much so that itis doubted whether the full answerwill be sent by cableIf this is attempted however it willbe a ong and laborious process oftranslation and transmission the original Spanish being first translated toEnglish then reduced to cipher thenoabled then translated back fromcipher to English As the actualdelivery of the document into MrWoodfords hands did not occuruntil late Monday these processes would delay the receipt ofthe text probably beyond Tuesday ifany attempt was made to cable it infull The statement is reaffirmed byofficials that no publicity of the Woodford instructions or of Spains answer will be made at Madrid or Washington until after the assembling ofcongress

MinisterWoodford at Madrid transmitting theanswer of the Spanish government tohis representatives in the interest ofpeace in Cuba This message began tocome in installments at two oclockTuesday night and it was nearly noonWednesday before it was all in hand atthe state department It was not thelength of the message that occupiedthe wires all that time but thefact that it was in all groupsof figures and it was probablyfiled in small batches as itwas turned into the complicated statedepartment cipher in Madrid All ofthis work had to be undone at the statedepartment and the message translated from the cipher back again intogood English This occupied nearlyall of the day so that it was half past3 before the first fair copy of the message was turned out It was not solong in fact there were a little lessthan 1000 words in the message forMr Woodford instead of cabling thewhole of the Spanish answer to his notecontented himself with reducing thematter to a brief outline The firstcopy was taken at once to the president not being entrusted to a messenger but being delivered by ChiefClerk Michaels in person at the whitehouse After due opportunity hadbeen allowed the

bemade public before consideration bythe cabinetFrom unofficial information that hasreached certain administration officialsin advance of this message of MrWoodfords as to the nature of theSpanish

nexthouse in the street The iceman camealong half an hour later looked curiousy at the closed door as he unfastenedthe hooks from a block of ice andrapped loudly on the step but no onecame to answer his callAn hour later a young man sleepingin the front room downstairs awokesuddenly and sat up in bed He wasastonished to note that the sunlight onthe carpet extended from the windowfar into the room indicating that thesun had risen above the tall buildingsacross the street He felt a strangeheaviness in his head and a desire to liedown again but he shook off the feeling and rose and began to dressWhat could be the matter The little clock on his dressing case pointedto ten What had caused him to oversleep Why had Mr Strong not wakedhim as usual The old man was alwaysup with the sun and had never allowedJiim to sleep later than eightThe young man hurriedly put on histrousers thrust his feet into his slippers and drew aside the portieire thatliung between his room and his unclesStrongs bed was in the righthandcorner of the room and Whidby couldsee the back part of his head and oneside of his gray whiskersWhidby called to him softly butStrong did not stir Whidby calledagain and stamped his foot but stillthe old man remained motionlessThats queer murmured Whidbyas he approached the bed Strongs facewas towards the window his eyes wereopen a ghastly smile was on his faceHe was dead Whidby saw that by theawful pallor of hs face which madeeach hair of the beard stand out as ifunder a magnifying glass For a moment Whidby stood as if turned tostone then he drew down the sheetwhich had been drawn up closely underthe old mans chin and saw the longdeep gash in the throat and the darkclots of tihebloodwhich had soaked intothe mattressWhidby was strangely calm In aninstant he had decided on a course ofaction He stepped to the telephoneacross the room arid looked over thedirectory then he rang and held thereceiver to his earHello he said thats the centraloffice isnt it Well all right oneseventy six on four eighty two pleaseWell what is it presently camefrom the telephoneIs that police headquartersYesI am Alfred Whidby 278 Leightonavenue A horrible thing has occunredhere during the night I have just discovered that my uncle Mr StrongRichard N Strong the banker hasbeen murdered Come and attend toitThere was a silence broken by a lowindistinct murmuring as if people weretalking at the other end of the wirethen the reply cameAll right as soon as we can getthereThen Whidby hung up the receiverand rang the bell He went back intobis room put on his shirt collar andnecktie and brushed his hair Hishead still felt heavy and ached a littleThe electric cars were whirring past thebouse and a blind man was playing anaccordion a few doors away Thorewas a crunching step on the graveledwalk near his window Whidby raisedthe sash and looked out It was Matthews the gardenerSeeing Whidbj he touched his hatstopped amd asked after Mr StrongWhidby made no reply but sat down ontho window sill and stared at the oldman He was wondering if the policewould prefer for him to keep the newsfrom the gardener It was the look ofelow astonishment coming into Matthews eyes that made him decide whatto sayMatthews he said something hashappened I can tell you that muchbut that is all I have telephoned thepolice youd better not come in tillthey get here If I were you Id go onwith my work the rose bushes near thefountain need trimmingMatthews stared and started to speakbut Whidby withdrew sat down on theside of his bed and tried to collect histhoughts Suddenly he was roused bya sharp ring at the door bell Whidby s heart sank and he was all in aquiver but he rose calniljr and went tothe door It was abo with the morning paper He held also a bill in hishand and wanted to collect the moneydue to him for delivering the paper forthe month past but Whidby sent himaway and stood for several minutes inthe doorway watching the crowd passing in the street Then he closed thedoor and went into his uncles roomand walked restlessly to and fro at thefoot of the bed Suddenly he stoppedat the telephone and rang the bellOne seven ty five on i our eighty

intownAh I see said Whidby the timedrags with me you know I am allaloneI understand Good byGood byThe young man turned and walkedround the bed for another look atStrongs face Surely he thought thatweird smile and the twinkle in the deadmans eyes were the most remarkablethings ever connected with a murdercase He could not bear to look at theface so he went into his own room Hewondered what had caused him to oversleep He went to his bed and smeltthe pillows1 to Bee if he could detecttraces of chloroform He had decidedthat he could not have been druggedwhen the bell of a passing car caughthis ear He knew that the car hadstopped in front of the house by thewhirring chromatic sound as it started on again Then he heard steps onthe veranda and went to the doorCHAPTER nIt was Capt Welsh the chief of police and Mr Minard Hendricks the detective from New York The latterscarcely nodded when he was introduced to Whidby His sharp gray eyesunder massive shaggy brows rested onthe key which he had just heard Whidbyturn in the lockHas no one been out at this doorthis morning he asked abruptlyNo stammered Whidby yes fthatis I came to answer the ring of a newsboy a moment agoAnd you locked the door after heleftYes -Why did you do it The detectiveseyes were roving about the veranda halland yard but his tone sounded sharpand to the point Whidby felt that hewas waiting for a replyI dont know replied the youngman helplessly I suppose I was excited and it seemed to me that it wouldbe best to keep curious people out tillyou cameCertainly replied Capt Welsh butthe detective went on with a frownWas the door unlocked when youopened it for the newsboyI Im afraid I cant remember answered WhidbyThat is unfortunate said HendricksWhere is the bodyThis way replied Whidby Thesecond door on the rightThe detective opened the door andthe others followed him to the bedHe looked long and silently at the faceof the dead man then he said Hasanyone touched this sheet since you discovered the imirderI drew it down to see where he waswounded If I had thoughtNo matter replied the detectiveand he lifted the sheet and examined thegash Then he replaced it carefullyand asked How was the sheet arranged when you found himJust as itis now I think said Whidb Just as if the murderer had replaced it with both hands one on eachside as you didStand where you are Hendrickssuddenly ordered He raised the window-shadewentTlown on his hands andknees and made a minute examinationof the carpet Then he rose and surveyed the room Where did you sleephe askedWhidby pointed to the portiere Inthat ToomThe detective drew the heavy curtains asideYou came through here this morning he askedYesHendricks looked at Whidbys bedSlept later than usual this morningeh he askedYes I dont know what was thematter

and handsStop cried Hendricks and hecaught Whidbye arm as his hands were 1almost in the water Pardon me but3rouve stained your fingers somehowThe young man stared at his righthand in surprise There was a faint redsmudge on the thumb and fingersWhy he said 1 dont see how itcould have got there unless I wonder if Whidby turned quickly intothe other room and bent over Strongsbed Ah he criSd to the othersSee I must have gotitfrom the cornerof the sheet when I put it back you seethere is blood on the under sideThe detective had followed Whidbyno further than the portiere where hestood indifferently watching the youngmans movementsYes from the sheet or this curtainhe replied pointing to an almost invisible spot of blood on the portiereThen the fellow must have been inmy room too said Whidby wonderinglyAnd just after the deed was doneHendricks remarkedThe young man stared at the detective curiously as he returned to thewashstand and took off his coatLook he cried to him here is someof it on my cuffI noticed thatreplied the detective It is a drop of blood Perhapsyou had better detach the cuff and giveit to me You did not sleep in thatshirtNo Whidby gave him the cufEWhere did you lay the shirt lastnight when you took it offOn that chair near my bed answered WhidbyThat is all you can do for us saidHendricks Youd better go to breakfastWhidby crossed the street and entered the restaurant on the corner HemG3 4 In-nBP e cret to m here is some of it onV my cufftook a seat at the table farthest fromthe door and ordered some eggs coffeerolls and butter but he found that hehad no appetite and he drank his coffee when it was so hot that it burnthis lips Then he bought a newspaperand sat for ten minutes gazing at it absentlyOn his return home he found the yardfilled with a crowd of curious peopleSome of them stood on the verandanear the windows The door was closedWhidby tried the knob but it waslocked Turning he saw Matthews coming round the corner of the houseCapt Welsh asked me to send you inat the rear door the man saidTheyre goin to hold a inquest on imWhidby followed the gardener intothe house How he disliked to see thebod again and the strange smile onthe dead mans face But there was nohcli for it He must do what he couldtowards bringing the criminal to justiceThe atmosphere of Strongs room wasso close that Whidby could hardlybreathe and the perfume from the conservatory sickened him Tho coronerand his jury had arrived Indeed theyseemed to be waiting for him lie satdown near a window ne wonderedwhat they would ask him and if hecould make intelligent repliesThe coroner opened the proceedingswith a few words to the jury and Whidby thought they stared at him furtivelywhenever his name was mentionedThen his testimony was called for andWliidby felt that he was repeating wordfor word the account he had given Hendricks a short while beforeThe detective rose next and told incareful detail how the police had beencalled to the telephone by Whidby andfirst informed of the murder how theyoung man had met him and Welsh atthe door and what was said aboutwhether the door was locked He spokeof the blood stain on Whidbys handand produced the cuff with the drop ofblood on it It was his opinion he saidthat the cuff could not have been wornat the time it received the drop nor forat least half an hour afterwards foras the jury could see the blood haddried in such a shape as to prove thatit had remained motionless for sometime Mr Whidby had said that theshirt with the cuff attached had lain ona chair near his bed all nightThen the coroner called for Whidbysnightshirt and the jury passed it fromi T --on o the other and examined it carefully At that moment Whidby rose tocall attention to the blood on the portiere ad on the corner of the sheetwhich jhe thought Hendricks and CaptWelslphad forgotten to mention butthe coroner ordered him rather coldlyto sit downMatthews was next called but hecouldtestify to nothing except that hesleptin the cottage behind the houseand had not waked during the nightThenfthe coroner requested Whidbyand Matthews to leave the room andWhidby went into the library across

balloonippear to have forgotten if indeedthey ever knew that carrier pigeonshave previously been taken to the arcticregions by other explorers and that inone instance it is believed a bird madeits way south to its old home in ScotlandWhen Sir John Eoss set out in theFelix in search of Sir John Pranklinsexpedition in 1850 he took with himfour homing pigeons belonging to alady in Ayrshire intending to liberatetwo of them when the state of the icerendered it necessary to lay up hisvessel for the winter and the other twowhen he discovered the missing explorer if he should be so fortunateA pigeon made its appearance at thedovecote in Ayrshire on October 31which the lady recognized by marksand circumstances that left no doubtin her mind of its being one ofthe younger pair presented by herto Sir John It carried no billet but there were indications inthe loss of feathers on the breastof one having been torn from under the wing Though it is knownthat the speed of pigeons is equal to100 miles an hour the distance fromMelville island to Ayrshire being in adirect line about 2400 miles is so greatthat evidence of the bird having beensent off as early as October 10 was required before it could be believed thatno mistake was made in the identification of the individual which came to thecoteIt was afterwards ascertained that SirJohn Iioss dispatched the youngest pairOctober G and 7 1S50 in a basket suspended from a balloon during a westnorthwest gale By a contrivance of aslow match the birds were to be liberated at the end of 24 hours The readercan form his own opinion as to the identity of the pigeon in question but atthe time it was fully believed that thebird was one of the two sent off fromthe expedition in Melville bayThe expedition fitted out by LadyFranklin in 1851 which sailed

1885and as the age of a tree can be inferredfrom the number of rings which itscross section discloses this one musthave been 533 years old In otherwords it was born in 1352 and it livedthrough the most interesting part ofEnglish history from Edward III toVictoriaIt is therefore a simple matter tomark different rings with their datesand the names of the events that werehappening- while they were being bornThis is what has been done from thecenter of the tree in two directionsright away to the bark The markingswhich are neatly executed in whitepaint reveal some interesting factsThus when this

armament has necessarilybeen accomplished by increase in costIn 1637 the Sovereign of the Seas cost41000 half of which was for laborThis was quite an exceptional outlayand no doubt other than legitimateexpenses were charged against thatvessel At the beginning of this century a 100 gun line of battleship costfrom 65000 to 70000 exclusive ofarmament The 121 gun sailing threedecker of 1837 cost nearly 120000and the screw three decker of 1857about 220000The nse of armor added greatly tothe cost and the Warrior of 1859 figured up nearly 380000 The Dreadnaught of 1S73 cost 620000 and theInflexible which followed her costSlO000 These large amounts werepartly due to the introduction of costly mechanisms required for mounting-and working the heavy guns and part-ly to large increase in the outlay ofarmorThen came the reaction in favor ofless costly ships and vessels were produced for 600000 to 650000 between 1875 and 1885 The inevitabletendency reasserted itself in 18S5 theNile and Trafalgar each costing about850000 The Eoyal Sovereign classof 1889 cost about 775000 and theMajestic about 840000 All these figures are for ships built in the Royaldockyards and exclude incidentalcharges as well as cost of armamentsThey include gun mountings with theircostly mechanisms and torpedo gearCruisers have similarly increased incost The Blake cost about 440000or about twice as much as the unarmpred Inconstant laid down in 1856The Powerful will cost about 6S0000 She carries a considerable weightof expensive armor and gun mountingscosting over 50000j Other navies spend even more ontheir nnits of naval force A Frenchfirst class battle ship costs about 1000000 and so do the correspondingships in the Russian and Italian fleetsThe American battle ship Indiana costover 600000 exclusive of armor andthat involved an expenditure of nearly 340000 Por the German battloships now building of which 11000 tonsthe estimated cost is about 700000It will be seen therefore that Britishbattle ships are in proportion to theirdimensions less costly than battleships of other navies and actually lesscostly than most foreign battle shipsof about the same dateThe same thing may be said ofcruisers The French Jeanne dArc isestimated to cost about 800000 aGerman first class cruiser about 650000 and the American jNTew York costexclusive of armor etc about 600-000 The actual cost of the great Russian cruisers is not known but mustreach high figuresAs compared with the costs of thelargest passenger steamers the foregoing figures no doubt will appearvery large But if deductions are madefor the expenses incurred on armorgun mountings and mechanisms torpedo gear and special fittings representing together say 330000 to 400000 in a first class battle ship the comparison is made fairer and the warshipapproximates in cost very closely tothe largest passenger steamers SirWilliam H WTiite in Cassiers MagazineAncient System of CharityA regularly organized system of relieving

Established 1S81J1 Published Every Tuesday and Friday byA STRANGE DISCOVERYThe Bile of a Serpent an Antidote feiIts BiteAnother very effective agent foiovercoming the venom of serpents hasbeen discovered by Prof Thomas EEraser of the University of EdinburghIt is not -whisky wherewith Americansantagonize the poison of rattlesnakesnor is it M Calmettes antitoxic serumobtained from the blood of animalswhich have been rendered immune bysuccessive inoculations with smallquantities of the venom The new antidote is nothing more or less than theserpents own bile In reporting aseries of elaborate experiments conducted by himself Prof Fraser recentlysaidThe bile from the gall bladder of theAfrican cobra pu adder rattlesnakeand grass snake was used and each bile-was tested against the venom of therican and Indian cobra For the mostpart the experiments were made bymixing Tarious quantities of each bilewith a little more than the minimumfatal dose of the venom and then injecting this mixture under the skin oithe animal The object of the experiments was not only to determine if thebile can render venom innocuous butalso if it have this power what is thesmallest quantity of bile capable of doing itHaving recounted the various doseswhich he employed and their effectshe thus summarizes the result It- was thus shown that the bile of venomous serpents is able when mixed withthe venom of serpents to prevent lethaldoses of the latter from producingdeath and that the bile is indeed sopowerful an agent in doing this that aquantity actually smaller than the quantity of venom may be sufficient for thepurpose It need scarcely be added thatthe doses of bile thus shown to be sufficient represent only minute portionsof the bile stored in the gall bladder ofa serpent and that a serpent thereforehas at its disposal enough bile to prevent injury from venom introduced intothe stomach in quantities many timesgreater than the minimum lethalThe bile of harmless serpents wasalso tested and found to be effectivethough in a less degree The same secretion from an animal like the ox wasanade the subject of other experimentsIt was even less powerful than the bileof innocuous snakes and about oneseventh as strong in its antitoxic influence as the bite of the cobra or aspBut if enough of it were used it wouldovercome a fatal dose of the poisonDr Fraser found that he could isolatethe particular element in a serpentsbite which has this surprising propertyso that the antidote can be prepared forthe market in very compact form Andthe process of manufacture is probablyquite as simple as and perhaps morerapid than that of M CalmettePrecisely how he obtained his clewthe Edinburgh savant does not say Buthe incidentally remarks that som ofthe native snake doctors in Africa havea compounded of several substances of which one is snake bile andthey are accustomed to administer itnot only by introducing it into the patients stomach where it is probablywithout effect but also by rubbing itinto the Avound where it would be absorbed into the blood- It is probabletherefore that this wonderful provisionof nature which compels a serpent tosecrete in one part of its system a curefor the poison that it seoretes in another has long been known in some ofthose countries where the informationis most likely to prove beneficial tomankind St Louis Globe DemocratCOUNTRY WITHOUT CRIMINALSOnly Two Thefts Have Occurred in1000 Years in IcelandIn Iceland there are no prisons andthe inhabitants are so honest in theirhabits that such defeases to propertyas locks bolts and bars are not requirednor are there any police in the islandYet its history for 1000 years recordsno more than two thefts Of these twoi cases one was that of a native who wasdetected after stealing several sheepbut as he had done so to supply hisfamily who were suffering for want offood when he had broken his arm provisions were furnished to them andwork was found for him when able todo it and meanwhile he was placed under medical care but the stigma attached to his crime was considered sufficient punishmentThe other theft was by a German whostole 17 sheep But as he was in comfortable circumstances and the robberywas malicious the sentence passed uponhim was that he should sell all his property restore the value of what he hadstolen and then leave the country orbe executed and he left at once Butthough crime is rare in Iceland and itsinhabitants are distinguishedesty and purity of morals there is ofcpurse provision for the administration of justice which consists first ofall in the

Mediterranean class They are the premiers inlaying and the standard by which theprolificacy of the other breeds isjudged Of the origin of the Leghornfovl there are differences of opinionand there is but little information tobe found - any where concerning theirearly history It U coBcededFthat a race of fowls bearing a ciee tsemblance in many respects to theLeghorn has existed in Italy and otkerparts of the continent of Europe for afirst introducedwereLeghornslong periodtroduced into America from Italy Thestory goes that as early as 1834 a yesselfrom Leghorn Italy brought to thiscountry as a part of its cargo a smallshipment of fowls which were at oncenamed Leghorns They immediatelybecame popular their prolific layingand nonsitting qualities being recognized at this early dateWhite and brawn Leghorns were thefirst varieties known Modern breeders are responsible for some of thesubvarieties of the breed and in pointof color at least exhibition birds of today even of the older varieties varyconsiderably from those seen at thepresent time in ItalyThe Leghorn fowl holds the sameplace among poultry that the Jerseyholds among cattle The question ofprofit in poultry has been decided infavor of egg producing breeds Theyare lively active and of a restless disposition the best of foragers and willpick up a good part of their living during the year Leghorns are light eaters and the cost of raising them to maturity is about one half that of theAsiatic varieties Their eggs are purewhite in color and weigh about ten tothe pound As table fowls they arefairly good By many they are considered excellent The only thing thatcan be said against them is that theyare small in size They must be warmly housed in winter to lay well and protect their pendulous wattles

to those who growlettuceKunder glass either m the amateur way or as a commercial productThe preparation of soil for lettuceshould not be too heavy It should becomposed of three parts by measureof loam one of manure and on e of sandThe seed is sown in boxes about 12by 10 inches and three inches deep oron the bench Benches are six inchesdeep the lower three inches beingfilled with well rotted manure and theupper three inches with potted soil prepared as described aboveWhen the plants are about two incheshig h they are transplanted to two inchpots The benches are filled with soilin which the pots containing- the lettuce are plunged so that the tops of thepots are covered with about half aninch of soil A little drainage materialis put in the bottom of each pot Theplants are usually set on -the benchesabout ten inches apart each way TheLETTUCE GROWN IN A POTroots soon fill the pot and grow oufcintothe soil of the bench through the drainage hole in the bottom of the pot Being thus buried in the soil the little potsdo not dry out as rapidly as they woulddo were they exposed to the airThe moment a pot is removed fromthe bench another may be set in itsplace without waiting to clear thebench or any portion of it of the restof the lettuce The method thus proveseconomical both of time and spaceGrocers and other retail dealers readily appreciate the advantage of havinglettuce grown in this way It ijermitsthem to keep the lettuce on hand for aconsiderable length of time and stillpresent it to their customers crispfresh and attractive instead of wiltedand unattractiveWhen the plant is ready for marketit may be knocked out of the pot andthe ball of earth and roots undisturbedmay be wrapped sungly in old paperThe earth will thus keep moist for along time and furnish moisture to theplants through the roots which are imbedded in it Local customers may besupplied with lettuce in the pots andthe pots returned after the plants aretaken from themWhile the subject of forcing is

branches and the dying off yearby year of the small twiggy terminalshootsWhen the land has been seeded tograss for a considerable time and especially when no manure has been applied trees will begin to show signs ofunthriftinessPlowing the ground in good season inthe fall giving the trees a good pruning and then before severe cold weathersets in applying a good dressing of manure scattering broadcast as far outunder the trees as the branches extendWhen the tree is healthy the top isluxuriant but if the tree gets weak orold the top makes but little growth ifit does not dieIn pruning all of the dead or decaying limbs should be cut out and sufficient growth to leave an open headIn many cases proper pruning and manuring will be all that is necessary torevive a reasonably young tree Whena tree is dying of old age very littlecan be done to sustain the loweringvitalityIn some cases trees are unthrifty forwant of proper drainage If waterstands around the roots the tree willnot make a healthy growth and providing proper drainage is of course theproper remedyA little needed work in the orcharddone in erood season in the fall willoften make an orchard that has beenin a great sense

bodyand taken to the rear Our troops fellback after the fight and we had morewounded than we had transportationfor but two men out of his own tentset out to carry this man wherever wewere going which was presumablythe camp behind intrenchments thatwed left in the morningThey took turns at backing him forhalf a mile or so until they came to afarmhouse that had a grassy yard infront They laid him down on the grassand took a little look af ound the houseto see what they could see In a building at the rear they came across something that made em stand still andlook at each other and laugh It was a-hand cart What use the folks here hadmade of it they couldnt guess but theyknew what use they were going to makeof it T hey got it out f the buildingand polled it around the side of thehouse alongside the wounded man anddropped the handle on the grass Helaughed too when he saw it He wasgoing the rest of the way in a privateambulanceThe two men took their blankets offtheir shoulders and untied them andspread their rubbers down on the bottom of the hand cart and spread theirwoolen blankets down on them andthen they ran the hand cart up and rested the handle on the front steps of thehouse and lifted in the wounded manand laid their guns in beside him Thenthey turned the cart around again andone man got inside the shafts with thecrosspiece aganst his waist belt andthe other man got behind to push Theyall smiled again when they startedwounded man and allIt beat backing him out of sight Itwas dry weather and the roads weresandy and up hill and on the level thewheeling was hard

Journal says Thegarbage of a great city is worth a fortune every year if properly utilized InSt Louis the refuse is placed in enormous vertical cylinders surrounded bysteam jackets which evaporate the 75to 80 per cent of water in the garbageThe fatty substances are dissolved andas the result of a number of processes afertilizer is produced which is worthfrom 9 to 12 per ton the demand exceeding the supply One of the purestand best soaps of the country was madeof garbage grease before cottonseed oilentered the field It is now proposed tolight London by electricity for nothingIt now costs that city 108 4s 8d toget rid of a ton of garbage A combination of rollers and other apparatus hasbeen devised that can burn the garbageat 24 cents 1 shilling per ton and generate steam sufficient to run enough dynamos to light the entire city Londoncan thus save 3s 8d on each ton andin addition illuminate its city withoutcost Garbage by a machine called thedust destructor is converted into clinkers
