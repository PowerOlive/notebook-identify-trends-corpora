A Sudden
Transformation
By R. W. KEENAN
Copyright by American Press Asso
ciation. 1911.
1 went from America to South
Africa, leaving my -wife and children
at home. 1 was run down in health,
discouraged and felt that the only
way to pluck up courage and get on
my feet was to light out, leave all
cares behind me and strike a new
field. My wife's father an excellent
man, by the way agreed to take care
of my family till 1 could send for them
or return to them restored in health
and pluck.
I left America sick and disheartened.
A man sick is usually a man disheart
ened, and when he is obliged to go
away by himself to recover his health
he feels a3 if the bottom has dropped
out of his life. I never expected to see
my family xigain. However, the sea
voyage helped me, and by the time I
reached Africa I felt able to do some
thing for myself.
I went to work in the Kimberley dia
mond mines, where I learned to tell a
diamond when I saw it, no matter if
it was in the rough. One day in walk
ing across a field I saw one and recog
nized it at once. It was as big as a
small English walnut and about the
same shape. I pounced upon it, look
ed it over and, sure I was right about
it being a 'diamond, put it in my
pocket. Even if of a poor grade it
would make me rich.
I made up my mind to return to
America with my find. So. procuring
a little chamois skin bag. I put the
diamond in it, first marking my name
on the bag in ink. Then I took a trav
eling wagon for the coast.
There were half a dozen of us trav
eling together, but only two of my
fellow passengers attracted my atten
tion. One was a big, rough looking
man, who sat beside me, noticeable
for his villainous appearance. The
other was a little man in the garb of
a curate of the English church. He
was reading his prayer book most of
the time, seeming to be only interested
in holy matters, a typical British par
son of the inferior grade, one of those
miserable creatures who for some dirty
work done a lord gets a living, though
this one, being in Africa, it appeared
more likely that he was a missionary
clergyman.
I hadn't been sitting long by the big,
rough man, whose accent marked him
for a Yorkshire man. when 1 thought
of niy diamond, which was in one of
my pockets next to him. I clapped my
hand on the place where it should be,
and, lo, it was gonel
I knew 'it had passed into the pos
session of Jthe Yorkshircinan. Bnf
what was I to do? T was unjirrnecl,
and I could see the butt of his pistol
extending from his hip pocket. I look
ed over the passengers to see if there
was one I could rely on to help me in
case I should accuse the man and
claim my property. But two of them
were women, and the men in the
coach, except the two I have men
tioned; were weakly chaps, who ap
peared to have very little stuff in
them. There seemed nothing for me
to do but wait till we got to the end
of the route, keep the man in sight at
all hazards and take my chances for
an opportunity to recover my diamond.
This I decided on and did not show by
word or act that I had been robbed.
The opportunity came sooner than I
looked for it. Suddenly the wagon
was stopped by a single man, who or
dered us all out and to line up, as
road agents do in western America.
Only the curate refused, and he ap
peared to do so from abject coward
ice. Retreating to a far corner, he
begged the robber not to kill him.
The robber threatened to do so if he
didn't get out at once, but the clergy
man only whimpered and covered his
face with his hands. The robber,
transferring his revolver to his left
hand, entered the wagon, seized the
little man by the collar with his right
hand and was pulling him out when
a sharp crack rang out and the robber
fell back out of the wagon dead.
If there was any life left in him it
was knocked out by the curate, who
jumped on him with both feet. I
never saw a small man grow big so
quickly in my life. The next thing he
did was to plant his fist under the
jaw of the Yorkshireman, who. re
covering from the surprise of the epi
sode, was putting his hand to his hip
for his revolver. The big man did not
have time to get up before the curate
was on him, hammering him in the
face with a Derringer. Having stunned
him, he took a pair of handcuffs out
of his pocket and clapped them on his
wrists.
"What can I do for you?" I asked
of the parson.
"Get things in order to go on. I'm
Jack Sharp of Scotland Yard. This
man was the other's pard. I have been
following him to take him to England.
I saw him rob you, and I knew he was
here to help the other."
I did as he directed, got the driver
into place, and. finding some rope urn
der a seat. Jack Sharp bound the
prisoner firmly. Then we proceeded
on the journey. Sharp took my gem
out of the man's pocket and handed it
to me. I got safely home with it. had
it ground and turned into cash. I
wouldn't like to say how much money
it brought me, but since I sold it I don't
have to work unless I wish to.
Talk about transformations! When
the sniveling curate changed himself
into the celebrated Jack Sharp of Scot
land Yard I saw the quickest one on
record. " -
Hundreds Killed in Explosion.
Death to more than half the crew of
793 officers and men of the batleship
Liberte, counted one of the finest ves
sels in the French navy, followed a
fire and exploison whicn wrecked the
great ship yesterday.
xhe fire was discovered at 5 o clock.
At first it did not appear to be serions
but somehow or other it gained quick
advantage over the squad of sailors
sent to extinguish it, and suddenly
without warning it reached the maga
zines, which had not been Hooded on
account of the apparently trifling
nature of the blaze.
The force of the explosions was
terrific. They shook the vessel fore
and aft, each one seemingly stronger
than that preceding, opening up great
fissures in the armor and framework
of the vessel.
"The vessel imediately became a mass
of fire and smoke and soon, almost
demolished by the terrific detonations,
sank to the bottom of the Toulon har
bor. it was all over in a comparatively
short time.

The Proof is in. Paris Almost at

The public statement of a Paris citi
zen is in itself strong proof for Paris
people, but confirmation strengthens
the evidence.
Here is a Paris citizen who testified
years ago that Doan's Kidney Pills
relieved sick kidneys and now states
the cure was permanent. Can any
sufferer from kidney ills ask better
proof? You can investigate. The
case is right at home.
Mrs. J. T. Martin, Eleventh and
Main streets, Paris, Ky., says: "Kid
ney trouble in my case was brought on
by a fall I received two years ago.
My back ached until I thought ifc
would break and sharp twinges often
shot through my kidneys. I tried
various remedies, but could not find
relief until I procared Doan's Kidney
Pills at Wilscn's drug store. After
using them one week I felt like a
different woman and I was soon com-

Misuse of Via.
A stroll through the shipping dls
trict gives many a wrench to the pur
Ist's soul. "In front of all the com
mission houses," he said, "I see bales
and barrels labeled 'via boat' or 'via
train.' Why does not somebody tell
the shipping clerks that every time
they write that they are insulting the
English and every other language?
'Via' can be applied properly only to
the place through widen a parcel
passes, not to the means of transportation,"

highly of them than ever."

Myth Concerning the Salamander.
Newts and salamanders are pretty

give the cent of fresh roses.
