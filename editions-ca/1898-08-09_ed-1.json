JOHNSONS QUICK WIT
How the Ex President Displayed It on the
Stump In Tennessee
There is in the city of Memphis a
preciuct known as Pinch in which a
majority of the voters were Irish It so
happened that Andrew Johnson and his
opponent for the United States senate
Gus Henry were to meet in joint de
bate in this precinct The evening came
and hundreds of blue Irish eyes were on
the two speakers as they ascended the
rostrum Henry opened and as a bid
for the Irish vote he told in withering
terms how Johnson when in congress
before had voted against a bill for an
appropriation to assist Ireland during a
time of famine He himself had done
yeoman work for the passage of the bill
while this other man who was now
asking their support had done every
thing possible to defeat it It was a fine
point and the speaker made the most
of it burning before it the lamp of his
eloquence until the crowd were wild
with excitement Then Henry sat down
and Johnson got up amid catcalls and
scoffs to answer him
What my opponent has told you is
true he said Ireland was suffering
and I voted against an appropriation for
her relief for the money which it was
thus proposed to give away was not
mine but yours yours because it was
in the puLlic coffers I refused to give
away money which did not belong to
me but I went down into my own pock
et and out of my own private funds
which I had a right to bestow I sub
scribed 260 to the relief fund which was
being quietly raised How much of his
own money did Mr Henry give Not a
cent He was too busy trying to give
away yours Now gentlemen which of
us two did the better part by suffering
Ireland The effect of this was magical
The catcalls were now for Henry and
the cheers for Johnson
Thus the campaign went on ending
in a victory for the ex tailor who once
more took his place among the statesmen
of the land But his term was a short
one for death soon claimed him But
he left behind him a reputation as a
stump speaker which abides still
upon the hustings down in Tennessee

NEW YORK JUSTICE
A City In Wbich a Rival Is Not Held
In
Great Esteem
As is generally known it is a pun
ishable offense in the state of New York
for any person to attempt to take his
life although it is not so if the attempt
be successful which makes self murder
somewhat different legally from the
other kind As is also very generally
known New York individually and
collectively is disposed to forever point
the finger of scorn at her large and
growing neighbor Philadelphia
Not long ago a prisoner was before a
New York judge charged with attempt
ed suicide and the judge being a man
who lived on Easy street where it was
sunny in winter and shady in summer
frowned fiercely on the culprit because
he couldnt understand how any man
would want to quit this life until he
was forced to do so
Your honor pleaded the culprit
looking iLo the frowning face of jus
tice there were mitigating circum
stances
The judge frowned more fiercely at

With feathers as blaclt as night
A plume laden hat with an upturned rim
And a red rose like her cheek
The tall pompons nod and the velvety rim
Shades a face Madonna meek
Is it true that a kiss is far better than that
Im dumb as I win Ifer smile yJ -

My heart keeps throbbing the while
Ten tips -gently nodding and each one fa curl
I vow I am dizzy with bliss I
Tis an audacious hat shes a mute modest

Shall I woo with words or a kiss -
Now the lass in the Gainsborough hat who
was kissed i

Simply looked so coquettish he could not resist
But this lassie might think it wrong
Still Ill follow his method of courting and try
To steal a draft from her lips
She is timid and chaste and alarminglyshy
The girl with bold ostrich tips
The chapeau top heavy almost hides her eyes
Of fond forgetmenot blue
Oh will sho be angry or show sad surprise
vfrien I dare begin to woo
Hcighol something soft swept my cheek I de

And my yet innocent lipsl
But if it were kisses Im quite unaware

How Mncb Worry and Vexation May Be
Saved the Mistress
Much of the cry against the tyranny
and impudence of servants comes from
those who exercise their authority in a
disagreeable way and who do not know
the first principles of successful man
agement argues Jane Lowry Gum
mings in a thoughtful paper on Man
aging the Servants in The Womans
Home Companion
Every woman has her own theory
of how the housework should be done
but it is not always necessary to insist
upon having it done in her way provid
ed it is done satisfactorily in another
way Bridget may come well recom
mended and be discharged at the end of
a week or a month because her method
is net what her mistress considers the
proper one Wherever she goes she is

A Cord of Wood
Few persons comprehend the produce
tive capacity of a cord of wood Chem
ical experiments are occasionally de
veloping new uses for wood in matters
remote from its ordinary adaptability
and tho feature that is exciting a great
deal oS interest just now is the trans
formation oZ wood products into liquids
Although under the strongest kind o
pressure wood yields scarcely any mois
ture by means of heat wood will evolve
gases and liquids of marked potency aad
utility In converting wood into char
coal gases and smoke arise which can be
condensed into pyroligneous acid It is
estimated that there is fully 65 per cant
of this acid in a given quantity of wood
and from it are- extracted wood alcohol
acetates of lime- and wood tars The al
cohol thus obtained is said to be a very
satisfactory substitute for grain alcohol
for mechanical and manufacturing pur
poses and it can be produced at less
than one third of the cost of the grain
alcohoL
Investigations conducted with prac
tical objects in view have disposed
these interesting facts A cord of wood
which- weighs 4000 pounds w4l yield
aboutr 2 Q5G pounds of pyroligneous acid
and 700 pounds of charcoal the acidi
wiU produce about 9 gallons ot 82 per
cent crude wood alcohol about 25 gal
lons of tar and fully 200- pounete of aca
tate of lime These facts indicate a fu

machine upon which each succeeding
mistress imposes her own pet theories
to the exclusion of all others Without
reference to results she is compelled to
change her method of handling the
broom building fires attending to the
bedchambers etc and because she is
awkward at doing things in a new way
she is probably upbraided and told that
she does not know her business If
Bridget is quick tempered she may re
