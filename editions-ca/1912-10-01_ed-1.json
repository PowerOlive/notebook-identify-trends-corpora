the livery stable of Jesse Ham.
All of the buildings burned faced on
Main street with the exception of the
property of Mr. Ham. which was on
the rear of the King hardware establishment.
'For a time it was thought the entire
business section on Main street would
be wiped out by the flames, as the fire
men seemed powerless to check the
progress.
Paris was appealed to for assistance
about eight o'clock, and the engine,
together with several hundred feet oi
hose, was about to be loaded on a
freight car when a message was re
ceived that the fire was under control.

approximate 535,000, partly covered by

suit, whicb was brought on the ground
of cruel treatment?

understanding with her husband that
the action was not to be contested, as
