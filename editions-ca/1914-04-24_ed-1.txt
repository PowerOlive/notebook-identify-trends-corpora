No wordhas been received by his rela-tives or friends here for some4 time and his last letter wassent from Tampico. Many ofhis friends received cards from$ that point, and in his commu-nications he stated he was en-joying life as a sailor, and was. in the best of health. ,Other Paris boys in the navyare WJieritt and McVey How-ard, brothers of Mrs. Taylor tChandler, Miss Jennie Howardand Logan Howard, of thiscity.

T. Hinton has been in conference with several contractors during the past few days.Since the contract of the NationalBitumen Co., which constructed Mainstreet several years ago expried, thethoroughfare has gone without repairs,due to the fact that patching thestreet in unmerous places, would instreet in numerous places, would inuseless expenditure of money andmany plans have been suggested toput the street in the proper condition.Mayor Hinton is of the opinion thatasphalt would be the most serviceable material to use in repaving Mainstreet and he has conferred with several contractors with, the object inview of ascertaining the approximatecost. A representative of the CareyReed Company of Lexington, whichrecently completed the large contractof paving a number of streets in Lexington, was here this wreek and lookedover the street. An estimate of thecost of laying the street will be furnished Mayor Hinton the early partof next week by this company. Otherconcerns will submit bids for thework, when they will be placed before the Council.For many months Main street hasbeen in a horrible condition, deepholes appearing at intervals, due tofaulty construction and repairing,which render it almost unfit for travel. It is expected that early this summer work bf reconstruction will beginas it is the intention to push the matter before the Council at the earliestpossible date.fche officials of the Government atWashington.Two events, each developing thisevening, suddenly altered the entirewar situation as it appeared to optimistic Administration officials last nightwhen they were hoping they wouldhave only Huerta to deal with.One was the halting of a large shipment of arms and ammunition at ElPaso, -which was consigned to the revolutionists. The other was the announcement of Carranza, reported inthe press dispatches from ChiuhuahuaWednesday night, that the revolutionary chief regarded the seizure of VeraCruz as an "act of hostility to allMexico."The consignment of munitions -xofwar to Carranza's army was stoppedat the border at the instigation of thearmy and navy Council of Defense,which feared lest eventually thesearms would be turned against American troops.

And from then a jump is taken to the mid-Victorian era.The hitched-up skirt at the back isvery similar to one worn during theearly 80's.Anyway, it recalls a flat crownedhat, the brim also swept up at theback the erstwhile Dolly Varden.And this is a piece of millinery whichis reinstated. Glorified visions are already on view, the brims of thesechapeaux in every case showing apronounced upward tilt at the back.The evening toilettes, by the way,are nowadays worn at restaurants, aremore replete with lovliness than theyhave ever been, ahd the eveningwraps are truly sumptuous, and forthe most part as limp as the frocks.Black and gold is a particularly favorite alliance; gold gauze, gold laceand black transparent brocades, variously accompanying black, velours,and black touches, .too, on a whitemousseline de soi gown have a particular cachet. But the bodices, forthe most part, are rien de tout. Lace,tulle, everything employed in theirconnection, appear to get more frailand shadowy every day.A great deal of black Chantilly laceis being worn, and likely to continueto be; but it is of cobweb fineness.Nothing like it has ever been made before, and one has only to place a pieceof this modern dpntelle side by sidewith the very finest of the old weavesto realize the difference. It is an aggravating condition of affairs forthose who are possessed of heirloomsand stores. But there is comfort inthe reflection that nothing lasts in theworld of dress, and ere we know it wemay be back among the heavier laces.Certainly the latter day Chantilly willnever live to be an heirloom; it is fartoo ephemeral.It is quite improbable, though, thatthe coatee and the bolero will entirelymonopolize the situation. Certainlythe older women will see the advisability of considering the greater elegance and suitability to them of somelonger coats that are making a tentative appearance. Those also hangquite free of the figure, and are considerably deeper at the back than infront; but the length is appreciable,and is frequently contrived by meansof one or two flat volants. Save forthe sleeves, these could be likened tothe mantles worn during the early60's.Pennsylvania has about TVs millionacres of timber-land', one-eighth ofwhich is owned by the State.

The sole function ofthe Station will be to put prospectivebuyers and sellers in communicationwith each other, leaving them to maketheir own transactions on their ownresponsibility. The Station will makeno charge for its services.When stock that has been listedwith this exchange have been disposed of by any means, the one who originally listed them will be required tonotify the Station, otherwise he willnot be allowed to list stock thereafter.The proposed exchange will handlehorses, beef and dairy cattle, sheepand swine.Communication with this department should be frequent as permanentadvertisement is not the object of theexchange, but rather the selling ofcertain individual animals listed anddescribed.In case this service works satisfactorily it is hoped later to add a department for the exchange of implements and sundry farming appliances,also to act as a medium for gettingprospective tenants and landlords together. Nearly all professions and industries except farming, have effectualworking organizations, these beinglocal, county and State, or even Nation wide. Any agency that will facilitate the prompt exchange of livestock and other farming necessitiesshould be a great convenience to thefarming public. The Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station is thefirst servant of the Kentucky farmerand if rightly used he can get moreassistance there than from any othersource.SPRING LAXATIVEAND BLOOD CLEANSER,Of all interpretations of variousroles last season in New York City,none received higher commendationthan that of Madame Nazimova forher portrayal of "Mrs. Chepstow," inJames Bernard Fagan's adaptation of"Bella Donna."

A number of poultry raisers, itseems, are putting on the market infertile eggs that have been tested inincubators from three days to a week.As soon as the breeder finds that theeggs will not hatch he takes them outandxsends them to the market alongwith his fresh eggs. After the eggshave been in the incubator for thisperiod they are distinctly stale androt very quickly if kept any length oftime. Even when just taken frqm theI incubator these infertile eggs are notfit for boiling on poaching, althoughthey may be used for frying, and aregood for cake or certain other bakedfoods. These eggs when they reacht the market, however, are classified aslow grade, No. 2.The mixing of incubator eggswitli fresh spring eggs leads the eggI packers, who get their principal coldstorage supply in the spring, to cutthe price they pay the farmer, department investigators find. Thespring eggs designed for keepingfor winter consumption must be absolutely good. Moreover, the egg pack-I ers in the spring do not candle eggs,but hold them three at a time in thehand and clink them to discover anycrack; and then judge; their freshness, by their fresh, powdery look on theshell. The mixture of infertile incubator eggs with fresh eggs interferesseriously with the clinking and forcesthe packer to candle the eggs. Hethen deducts this added expense fromthe price he offers to the producer.Eggs which have once been subjectedto the heat of the incubator can not' be stored, even though frozen.Cheerfully-Wish to have.

The herd consistedof ordinary cows of mixed breedingwhich were allowed to run most of theyear, but were tied up in the "overshoot" at milking time. In 1911, becoming dissatisfied with results, theowners decided to ship cream toWashington, D. C. This was foundto be more profitable, as they received 45 to 50 cents a pound 'for butterfat; but on the first visit of the district inspector the building were pronounced insanitary. The 'cellar ofthe dwejling hous was used as adairy house; the barn was an oldtime general-purpose barn; there wasno silo on the place. The water supply, which was pumped by a windmillfrom the neighboring creek, was considered unfit for washing dirty utensils. The owner built a new barn, adairy house, and a silo at a cost of$1,789, according to plans furnishedby the department. The' departmentfurnishes such plans to persons contemplating the erection of a newdairy barn, milk house or silo, or forthe remodeling of an old building, ifrequests are accompanied by statements of character and size of building desired. The new barn is a onestory building large enough for 30cows, but so constructed that thecows can be kept clean with the leastamount of labor. The old barn retained for storage purposes.Record sheets and scales for weighing miljfc were obtained and dailyweighings of milk were made. Arepresentative for the departmentassisted in making tests of the milkwith the Babcock tester, and gaveadvice about feeding and generalmanagement.At the present time the herd hasbeen increased to 30 head of as goodcows of mixed breeds as could be purchased, but it is doubtful if they areas good as those in the original herd.A pure-bred Holstein bull has beenplaced at the head of the herd. Fourpure-bred animals of the same breedhave recently been added. Followingthe advice" of the dairy expert, bettermethods of feeding increased thethat during the year ending September 30, 1913, the average yield oxmilk per cow was 502 pounds morethan during the previous year. Because of the improved condition ofthe buildings a better price is received for the milk, so with the increasedyield, combined with the higher valueof the product, the average- profiteach cow was increased to the extentof $24.79 per annum.Paris,yWednesday, AprilDBIN5DN5Fahbus SHOWSifii li-vjir .-:(,- I n ft!YOUR WM'Jk4 1S1E"GRAND PSNKw !FATHER it FDR Skij II &tMmwk ' i un.liOnly Big Show Here This YearROBINSON'S FAMOUS SHOWSIt takes a $10-a-week employe toisotice how many fool mistakes a $500-ii-weekjoss makes.DEAFNESS CANNOT BE GUREDSeventh and Main Sts,, Paris, Ky.T5 trofessionai CardsDr. Win.

G. Thomson, toMr. Clifton Arnsparger, at a price saidto have been about $15,000, thoughthe exact figure was not made public.The property has been used for aschool since 1870, when the Sisters ofVisitation organized St. Joseph'sAcademy. They conducted the institute for about fifteen years, when itwas purchased by Mrs. Mary WareBerry, who conducted a school forgirls. Prof,. M. G. Thomson boughtthe place fourteen years ago from Mr.W. H. McMillan, and continued it as aschool for girls -and young women.About two months go'.Mrs. Thomson,who has had -charge of the schoolsince the death, of Prof. Thomson lastJuly, decided to accept the principalship of Hamilton College, in Lexington, and since that time the propertyhas been on the market.It was hoped that some one wouldbuy it for educational purposes andcontinue the schoolon the same highplane that it has occupied for so manyyears, but no offer being made to thisend, Mrs. Thomson made the abovementioned disposition of the place.It is admirably adapted for divisioninto city building lots and will makean ideal sub-division for those desir-ing. homes removed from the citynuise mm cumusion, ana yet conveniently located from every point of interest business, schools, churches,interurban car line, etc. Mr. Arnsparger will make this disposition ofthe grounds, and convert the buildings into flats.DESIRABLE RESIDENCE ADDITION TO BE THROWN OPEN'Attorney Clifton Arnsparger, whorecently acquired the Bourbon Collesre InroDertv on CvDress street, will subdivide the grounds into buildimr int-.n.and will hold a lot sale within thenext thirty days. .This should prove to be one of themost desirable additions yet thrownopen to the public in Paris. Thegrounds are in an ideal location, closeto the business district, and no doubtwill be eagerly sought after by prospective home owners.It is said a street will be run fromCypress street through the center ofthe grounds to connect with Walkeravenue, which will be extended fromShort street through the property tothe Fretwell line. This arrangementwill open up quite a number ot desirable sites, and will not interfere withthe old college building. Mr. Arnsparger will tear away the smallframe cottage on the grounds, as itwould not be in keeping with the classof homes that it is expected will bebuilt.Watch for the date of this sale, andtake advantage of this opportunity tobuy high-class and well located building lots in the heart of Paris.(24-lt)SCHOOL BAORD ELECTSTEACHERS FOR NEXT YEARMr. O.

The Kentucky case was the suit of the Citizens' Insurance Company of Missouri and others against InsuranceCommissioner Matt C. Clay, to test theconstitutionality of the act of 1912,ci eating the State insurance ratingboard and giving it the power to reduce rates when too high. This!case, Attorney General Garnett said,was continued by agreement until theivansas case was decided, and was notargued.oo !HEDGES! HEDGES!

TT. vvriThe increasing use of motion pictures by non-commercial agencies,such as schools, churches and recrea"tion centers, is one of the significantsigns of the times.It proves that the motion picturehas a bigger place in the world thanmere amusement. The motion picture amuses ,but it also instructs. Because it visualizes its instructions, theteaching remains in the mind. Insome factories untrained men arelearning intricate processes, throughseeing on the screen a master workman doing the job. In others safetymethods are being taught in a similarway.In schools animal life ' and plantgrowth are illustrated by motionpictures. In a few moments the development of a plant from a tiny cell toits complete fruition can be shown.Hours would be necessary to tell thesame facts and the chances are thatthen the student would not understand them.The processes of industry are madereal in pictures. A long and tiresome walk through a factory wouldnot reveal half as much as one reelwill show. In the same way pupilsare taken to foreign lands and seebefore their eyes the people themselves, their buildings, their customs,their trade and their chief landmarks.They see scenery which formerly wasaccessible only by visiting the spot orthrough picture books. And picturebooks are lifeless compared with thefilms.The motion picture can tell thelight stories of the day very well, asall visitors to the vaudettes know, "butit also can tell the great stories ofi history. Momentous events are beingstaged before the camera in a farmore impressive form than the mostgifted author could tell them. Greatnovels like "Quo Vadis" and "LesMiserables" are being made to liveon the screen. Dramas are beinggiven immortal life.Commercially the motion picturelong ago demonstrated its worth. Asthe years pass, it isproving that ithas a bigger place to fill as an educational agent for all the people.CLEARS COMPLEXIONREMOVES SKIN BLEMISHESWhy go through life embarrassed anddisfigured with pimples, eruptions,blackheads, red roueh skin, or suffer-1 1 ing the tortures of eczema, itch, tet5 for cnlt rhpnm?
