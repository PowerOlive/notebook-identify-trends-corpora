REMINISCENCES OF THE LATE
CHAMP CLARK
(R. S. Porter, in Lexington Leader)
During their younger manhood Mr.
Clark and the late Joseph C. S.
Blackburn, of Versailles, were inti
mate friends, and visited Paris to
gether on many occasions. On one
occasion at the old Bourbon Fan,
Mr. Clark and Mr. Blackburn were
announced to debate on a popular
subject, and it was widely advertised
throughout the State, with the result
that one of the largest crowds ever
seen in Paris gathered at the Fair
grounds to hear two of the leading
orators of the country.
Each becajme so enthused over his
subject that they used vsome very
harsh words, and finally it was be
lieved were about to come to blows,
when they -were separated by mutual
friends and taken to their rooms at
the old Bourbon House.
After cooling off to a degree, each,
it is related, penned a note to the
other.asking him to call at the
other's room and renew the friend
ship by partaking of a mint julep,
then the prevailing drink in old
Bourbon. It is said that the tv-n
messengers met in the hallway, and
after some discussion decided the
best way for each of the principals
to the quarrel to make the amend
honorable without loss of dignity to
either, was for all hands to adjourn
to the hotel bar, which was done.
While quaffing the fragrant and ex
hilerating drink' each pledged eter
nal friendship and the jmatter was
finally and for all timesettled.
Mr. Clark visited Paris about
thirty years ago, and stopped at the
same hotel, where, surrounded hy
some of the older acquainances of his
younger days, he told vmany inter
esting anecdotes of his early life in
the Bluegrass.

Warren G. Harding, country news
paper publisher, is in the White
House President of the United
States. May he become the greatest
of American Presidents. Certainly
this newspaper pledges its earnest
effort to help him to that end. Ho
faces perplexing problems both at
hcjme and abroad, but none so be
wildering that it cannot be solved by
the application of correct reasoning
and honesty of pWpose. We have an
abiding faith in the sound thought
of the American people,, and we re
joice because President Harding, as
a publisher, need not be taught the
value of wholesome contract with his
fellow men and fromen. If he
ovQ nminspi with the nation he is
pledged to serve the great voice will
not lead him astray. In the days to
come should we offer fatts in criti
cism of his policies it will come be
cauce we fear our President may err
as a result ofsilence. Our wish is tc
be helpful, to put at the disposal of
the President the best of our
thought always in the interest of the
people to whose service the life or
this good man is dedicated. The
President of the United States does
not represent the Republican party,
the Democratic party or any other
i... xr oTvocp,rtR America, and
we stand for that with face uplifted,
with pen in .hand and unafraid.
