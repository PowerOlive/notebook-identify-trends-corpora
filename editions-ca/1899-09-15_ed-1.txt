flag to foreign portson her way back to the waters in whchshe won fame and everlasting gloryIt is well indeed that the old battle-tive officer He is one of our navalheroes and deserves greater celebritythan has been given to him His namehas been overshadowed by the nameof Schley Evans Philip Clarke andothers of higher rank who participatedin the battle off Santiago on JulyL898 when Spanish Admiral Cervtrasfleet was destroyed Put he was anactive participant in that battle as thecommander of the converted yachtVixen a little vessel which was in thebattle from start to finish and whichrendered particularly valient serviceAlthough a well directed shot from an jone of the Spanish ships might haredestroyed the Vixen Lieut Sharp kepther j to the fore all the time andshe sent death dealing missiles throughthe Spanish torpedo boat destroyersThe navy department did wed in selecting such a man for the special recruiting service for the Hartford andalso in designating him to be the executive officer or first luff as the sailorscall that officerCommander Hawiey who also participated in the great naval engagement has been designated to commandfhe Hartford and he has diligently attended to the work of supervising enlistments He says The desirabilityof having western men for jackies wasdemonstrated during our late war withSpain We had a number of recruitsfrom the west particularly from Iilinois who performed splendid serviceduring those trying months and theymay well be proud of the records theymade Although they lacked the original training of sailor men they soonTHE OLD CRUISER HARTFORD ADMIRAL FARRAGUTS FLAGSHIPjourney of the Hartford in Deweyswake because it was upon her old deckand in the fleets of which she was theflagship and under the command ofFarragut that George Dewey learnedhis first lessons of actual warfarehen the Hartford reaches Atlanticports she will in her new sphere occupy the unique position of being the firstone of Uncle Sams fighting craft to beused exclusively for the training ofgreen landsmen into the ways of typicalThe mayor of Hartford has requested that the staunchand sturdy old ship be sent to that cityand the secretary of the navy has issued the appropriate orders so that assoon as she arrives on our Atlanticcoast she will sail to Hartford wherefor the city of Hartford the mayor willpresent a silver service as magnificentas any that has yet been given to ourmodern cruisers and battleshipsAfter that the Hartford will cruiseabout the principal coast cities visitingthose places where almost 55 yearsago the Hartford cvuised with AdmiralFarragut on board the hero of the nation just as the Olympia has just beencruising about bearing proudly the heroof ManilaBut not only the people of the coastcities are to be interested in the rejuvenation of the famous Hartford butthe people of the middle west and farwest are being given an opportunity toinfuse their vigorous blood into the enlisted branch of the navy and 300 ablebodied men of the sections named arerecruited for terms of four years andthey are to serve first on the Hartfordstudying practical seamanship Similar crews are to be enlisted and serveon the old Constitution It is the theorv of the older naval officers that enlisted men of the new navy ought toknow how to sail any kind of a shipwhereas it has recently been customaryto enlist men and set them instantly atwork on the steelclad cruisers and battleships of the new navy It is believedthat patriotism will be infused into theyoung men by having them serve on theold battleships win re they will learntheir history and with it the history ofthe glories and achievements of thenavy After that with other youngmen to take their places they may besent on board of the modern cruisersand battleshipsThey must learn bowto go aloft torun about the rigging and beat homeWith sure footing in calm and stormThey most learn all about the foremain and mizzjjn masts their sparsgarnets and shrouds They must learnto furl unfurl and clew garnets justas the American satfors did under JohnPevi Jones Ingraham Farragut Footovercame this handicap b3 their intelligence and zeal and they rapidly became familiar with their duties in hestrictest sense Besides they werehardy and endured climatic conditionswhich would have prostrated less hardymenHe further said it is unfortunatethat the United States lacks a big merchant marine such as European nations have upon which to draw for theirwarships in time of hostilities GreatBritain greatly outstrips us in thasparticular for the present In myopinion the merchant marine of ourcountry will develop with wonderfulrapidity during the coming ten yearsIn the meantime we can find and havefound in the middle and far west asufficient number of sturdv youngAmericans born on our soil with patriotism bred in their bynes and sinewsSuch men we need for the Hartfordand for our entire navy Heretofore wehave had in our navy too many men offoreign birth and without naturalization We must have a strictly Americannavy and the Hartford is beginning toform a nucleus of such a navyYou see we are not going to takelandsmen directly on board of the shipsof the new navy We are going to takethem on the Hartford and teach themto shoot straight and often and keepup our well earned reputation forAmerican gunnery Then when theygo aboard the big modern vessels theywill be ready for the most efficient service YYe want the nations of the worldto know that in all times and under ailcircumstances our American jackieswill shoot as well and as effectively asthey did in Manila bay and on thesouth coast of Cuba whih they mannedtheir guns under the inspiration of thefloating signal Remember tin- MaineThe new men will serve six totwelve months on the Hartford andwill then be portioned off among theships of the new nivySo the old Hartford has not outlivedher usefulness In her old age sh willfurnish the sinews oi strength for thenavy and will give to all of our fleetsmen of intelligence and skill who willbe the peers of all modern artilleristsand probably the superiors of those inother navies men who have been givenample opportunities to prove what theycan do to targets a thousand or moreyards distantIf Admiral Farragut is to day wherehe can view the American navy and ifthere be tears of joy in the heaven ofthe heroel his eyes must be moist withpride in his old flagship the Hartforathe ship once so dear to him the shipwhich never knew defeatSMITH D FRYLEGEND OF A PRAIRIE GRAVEbeneath the Wild Flowers Lies theRemains of a Soldiers BelovedYoung WifeNear the top of the highest knoll onthe rolling prairie three miles southwest of old Fort Hays in Kansas is alonely grave in the prairie grass Thereis a board at the head and another at thefoot These boards may once haveborne an epitaph but now they arebrowned and worn by the sun andstorms of many years and they are decayed at the ground and stand at anangle almost ready to fall A prairierabbit has made its burrow at the footof the grave All around it the grassis full of purple and yellow flowersStanding by the grave and lookingnorth and east there lies stretched outa landscape of wondrous beauty Thegreen sod of the plains slopes gradually down from the grave a distance ofthree miles to the cluster of long grayand yellow empty bulidings which werethe barracks and officers quarters ofFort Hays when this was the far westyears before there was a railroad inKansas Beyond the fort is the town ofHays a group of yellow stone andred brick buildings Beyond stretchesthe prairie north and east to the horizon lire BQ and 30 miles away Diagonally across this stretch of levelplains runs a thread of vivid greenfrom the northwest to southwest thetrees that fringe Big creek There areno other trees anywhere else on thelandscapeThe U gi nd of the lonely grave is thatyears ago when the Fort Hays barrackswere full of troops an army hospitalsteward broujrht his young wife thereto live with him Each Sunday the officer and his wife walked out to this hilland they used to sit down on the shadyside of it near the summit and gaze forhours out at the landscape below Thenthey could see the herds of buffaloroaming over the prairie andnce inawhile a band of Indians scurryingacross itOne day the young wife was strickenwith a deadly fever IJefore she diedshe asked her husband to promise thathe would bury her body near the topif the hill at the very spot where theyused to sit and look out over the wonderful landscape He kept the promise and there is her grave The onlyflowers he could get to plant upon itwere the wild flowers of the prairiesand they are blooming there yet Chicago ChronicleMARK TWAIN ON

becameaware that the man whom Jacopo had ridden over had risen on his hands andknees and was crawling off in the brushwoodSteady friend I said and running upto him gave him a prick with my sword asa hint to stop He made a little outcrybut bad the good sense to take the hintand easting the light of the torch on hisface I recognized my old acquaintance theancient BricoSo signore I said 1 have again tobe thankful to youJacopo too came up and recognized theman at a glancelappita he burst out but it is theancient Brico Shall 1 beat his brains outexcellencyMercy most noble cavalier exclaimedBrico l

with the moonFetch me the bridle from my poor horseyonder and bind this knave firmlyJacopo needed no second bidding and infivfc minutes the ancient securely boundwas sitting like a trussed fowl in the middle of the road alternately cursing andweepingPerhaps excellency we had better lookat the other and Jacopo pointed to theman whom he had shot who lay on hisface Perchance he added he toomight turn out an old acquaintanceWe did so and as we bent over him I sawit was Bernabo Ceci gone to his last account lie was shot through the heart andlay quite dead with a frown on his foreheadand his teeth clenched in the death agonI looked at him in a sad silence which Jacopo broke1 never knew a cross marked bullet tofail excellency lie is stone deadMay he rest in peace I answered hewas a brave man although my enemyHe is still enough now your worshipand see There is his horse grazing quietlyIt will do excellently to replace the lostoneHe ran forward and secured the animalwhilst 1 had a final look at my dead beastHis neck wis broken and there was anend of him Whilst Jacopo at my requestwas changing the saddles I stirred up theancient who had lapsed into silence andjlejated the favor of his informing me towhom 1 was indebted for the excitement othe night Brko at first would not answerbut an inch of steel removed his suikinessand he told me all that I believe he knewwhich was to the effect that he and someothers had been hired by a great Florentine called Strozzi to stop me at all hazards on my journey to Rome and that Mieparty was commanded by Ceci Who was top n them 200 crowns for their trouble Mo-he evidently did not know and disregarding all his entreaties to loosen him we rodeoff wishing him a good night Nevertheless I am afraid he suffered considerable discomfortThat rascal monk said Jacopo as wejogged along has gone on ahead ot us andto morrow perhaps will rouse the country in advance of usNever fear Jacopo 1 answered ha isno monk as I well know and his onlychance was to escape as he did He willhark back soon enough to Florence Suchhawks as lie do not fjy far from theireyriesAnd in this 1 proved to be tight and Ihelibrary scribe vas never seen by me

continued ur journey halting by day and traveling by nightand finally reached Leghorn in safety Herexve took passage in a ship bound for Romebut were compelled to wait two days inLeghorn as the master was not ready tosail at once At last all things being arranged we got our horses and ourselvesaboard and put to sea with a fair windThe master of the ship had sailed withMiscr Columbus to the new world andlost no time in giving us the history of hisadventures which were in truth marvelousbeyond imagination I listened with asmooth face and the good man no doubtthought that 1 believed his stories In thishowever he was mistaken neverthelessthey were diverting in the extreme Jacopowas overcome by the sickness of the seaand flung himself down in a corner on thedeck of the ship from which spot nothingwould induce him to move At every lurchhe threw out a prayer which ended in agroan and so great was his distress thatas be afterwards stated he would have soldhis soul to Satan for a paul if only to obtain an hours relief As for me I wtfswellof the beforehaving luid some experience oceanfore when employed by the most serenerepublic for service agimst the Turk andfound contentment in the masters storiesand in pacing up and down watching suchtiling as ame under my view I had plentyof opportunity for reflection on the voyage and cam to the conclusion that on delivering my letter to the cardinal at Rome1 would seek out Bayard if he were therelay my story before him and beseech hishelp to euable me to recover myselfAt last one fine day we reached Ostiaand there disembarked after bidding fare-well to the master and sot out on our wayto Rome Jacopo recovered his spirits ashis foot touched land and though the ruddiness of his cheek had paled a little hexvas quite himself again

of my forefathers history men who had for centuriesplayed so great a part in its fate until ourhouse was cast forth by the mother cityto wander as exiles over the land It istrue that since the days of my childhood1 had not seen Rome it is true that suchmemories of it as I had were dim aud mistyand that to recall them was like trying tobring back before ones eyes when awakethe vague but pleasant visions of a delightful dream nevertheless my heart filledwith a strange joy and my pulse began tobeat more rapidly as each stride ot my horsebrought me nearer home In short 1 wasa Roman come back to

themonastery of the Aracoeli on the Capitolbut unluckily 1 discovered that my horsehad cast a shoe and this was a matter notto be neglected So we turned to the rightand entered the Campo Vaccino formerlythe Forum of Rome It being new sunsethere were collected hundreds of oxen andbuffaloes and from the height of MonteCaprino we could hear the bleating of theherds of goats which vere pastured thereon and the tinkling of their bells as theymoved slowly down towards their shelterfor the night A hundred fires were blazingcheerfully and served to dissipate the bluevapor which began to hang over the placeRound these fires were groups of peoplemostly countrymen who seemed in the bestof spirits as they listened to songs orwatched numbers of their party who dancedmerrily to the tune of pipe

it was little better than one of the common osterie or wineshops with which Romeabounded but it was too late to pick andchoose and for the night at least I determined to stay here Our first duty was

Prof D H Otla at the Kansas State StationIt is a well known fact that cowi notmilked clean will tend to dry up in shortorder Another important reason formilking clean is to get all of the butterfat which is contained in a much largerper cent in the last than in the firstmilk drawn as is shown by the following experiment The college dairy hasconducted an experiment showing theimportance of clean milking Fivecows were selected and their milk collected in half pint bottles each teatcontributing its share to every bottleThese samples were tested with theBabcock test with the following resultsCow No 6 varied from 6 of one percent to 72 per centCow No 10 varied from 2 of one percent to 66 per centCow No 14 varied from 16 per centto 5S per centCow No 15 varied from 15 per centto 6S per centCow No 20 varied from 8 of cne percent to 7S per centThe results show a gradual althoughnot entirely uniform increase in theper cent of fat from th beginning tothe last of the milking v Kcept with thelast two samples drawn irom each cowHere the per cent of fat would take asudden leap amounting often to a thirdor a half of the total variation This6hows very clearly how important it isto get all the milk Uy averaging theresults it was found that the last quarter of a pint was worth from threefourths to l1 pints of milk first drawnfrom the udder Moral Milk cleanand get fat D H Otis Kansas Experiment StationApplying Poultry ManureDo not neglect to make use of thepoultry droppings says the FarmerThere is no manure on the farm thatequals it and if properly gatheredfrom droppings boards it will be entirely free from weed seeds a very important characteristic of fertilizers Agreat many are afraid to use it fearing it is so strong as to burn up theplants which it is intended to benefitThere is only one proper method of applying poultry manure to the soil before planting and that is broadcastingit upon the soil after plowing and thoroughly mixing it with the soil by harrowing Applied in this way thegrowth of the crops grown on thatpiece of ground will be simply wonderful It should bespread rather thinct least a wheelbarrowful will go asfar as a wagon load of coarse stablemanure The thicker it is spread thenore thoroughly it should be harrowedinto the soilLiOaa from Poor MilkerA good milker should have a stronggrip in his hands He will have it if hemilks cows many years The grip

1899RURAL MAIL DELIVERYUniversal Introduction of the System Must Lead to the Construction of Better RoadaThe Chicago Kecord in a recent issuegives an interesting resume of the operation of numerous free rural deliveryroutes in Montgomery county Ind atypical community of the middle westIt has demonstrated that all of thenhave been operated to the entire satisfaction of the Indiana people enjoyingthe convenience and also of the postoffice department The Kecords correspondent gives figures which sufficiently vindicate the action of the department The routes are about 30 mileslong During the first month of the delivery each of the carriers deliveredabout 1000 pieces of mail matter at theend of the first year they were delivering more than 5000 pieces a monthDuring the first three months theywould each collect from eight to tenletters daily now they collect 50 to60 daily besides many packages Factaare cited to show the many improvements that have come about and thethree most significant are those whichshow the concrete fact that farms haveraised in value the department is receiving a net profit of 40 per monthand that the convenience has stimulated the building of two new macadamized roads to induce the government toestablish more routes With theseroads and without the free delivery system has come a greater value to thefarms lying along them than has cometo those with free delivery and poorroads and the net result has been alarger and more vital interest in themovement that was first inauguratedby the League of American WheelmenIt will only be a matter of time anda comparatively short time at thatwhen the motor vehicle will assumelarge proportions in this matter of freerural mail delivery Already the bicycle has become the one great featurebut in the system

local fathers will have before them Belfish inducements to advance the cause that thewheelmen have so long and unselfishly fought for It would be strictlywithin reason and should not be beyond the province of the postal department to make it a sine qua non that tobe without roads would mean to bewithout free delivery Under such conditions matters would soon assume ashape that would promise the

bleached skeletonflIScwiof a human being will be visible on allthe millions of square miles of thesurface of this planetUnless by some huge and universalcataclysm the whole race is swept atonce into eternity it is but reasonableto suppose that man like any otherrace of animals will disappear slowlyand that eventually there will be buta single human being left some oldold man gray headed and bearded andleft to wander alone In a solitude thatmay be imagined but not describedHow will he die this last relic ofthe teeming millions that once transformed the face of the globe and ruledundisputed masters of every other living thing There are many fates thatmay befall him He may go mad withthe horror of loneliness and himselfend his own miserable existence Hemay be eaten by the vast reptiles orgiant insects which will then probablyinfest the solitudesBut his fate may be far weirder andmore dreadful Scientists say that aswe burn the coal and timber we areI still so richly supplied with we letloose into the atmosphere an ever increasing volume or caroonic aciu gasMuch of this is taken up by plantsbut not all It must increase andeventually poison the breathable

invisible flood win reach anddrown himAgain it is said that the earth as Itgets older is cracking like dry mudThese craqks will increase until at lastthey will let the waters of the oceansand rivers sink into the fiery center ofthe globe Then will occur an explosion so terrible as may startle the inhabitants of neighboring worlds Thelast man in this case will probably besome arctic explorer or Eskimo whomthe vast plains of ice around will savefrom instant death and leave to grill afew moments till the ice continents areswallowed by redhot gases and steamSuppose these earth cracks developmore slowly they may suck away thewater without devastating explosionsThen the last mans fate will be theworst describable He will die ofthirst The scene of his death willprobably be the great valley in the bedof the Atlantic ocean off the Braziliancoast half way between Rio Janeiroand the cape where now six miles ofgreen water lie between the steamerskeel and the abysmal slime beneathThere
