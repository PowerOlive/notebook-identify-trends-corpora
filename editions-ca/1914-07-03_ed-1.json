On Friday afternoon while the
temperature was hovering around the
100 mark, Mr. Thos. McClintock, who
had just made a hog trough in the
yard of the Millersburg Coal and
Lumber Co., offered Mr. Lindsey
Stewart a dollar to carry the trough
from the yard to the farm of Mr.
Wallace Shannon, which is more than
a, mile from the Lumber Co.'s office.
Mr. Stewart attempted to bluff Mr.
McClintock, but when he found ho
was in earnest was compelled to back
down. Mr. J. F. Caldwell, who was
standing near by, said that he would
carry the trough to the farm for a
dollar. It was no sooner said than he
picked up the trough, shouldered it
and carried it to the farm, Mr. Mc
Clintock driving the buggy behind
him. When Mr. McClintock saw that
Mr. Caldwell was in earnest he want
ed to back down, because' he feared
the heat would overcome Mr. Cald
well. TJndonted by this Mr. Caldwell
went on with the trough. He rested
three times on the road for a few
moments only, carried the trough to
the farm, pumped it full of water, and
rode back to town with Mr. McClin
tock. Mr. Caldwell is a man of about
70 years, who for several years has
been in delicate health, and was crit
icaly ill last' spring with a compli
cated heart and stomach trouble.
