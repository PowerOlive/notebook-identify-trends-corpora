CATHEDRAL AT MILAN.
The'world renowned white marble
cathedral of Milan, 'adorned with
nearly two thousand statues, contrib
utes one of the many new features of
Lyman H. Howe's Travel Festival
which comes to the Paris Grand on
Thursday, April 10. The especial
glory of this wonderful structure is its
architectural detail. Its creation
marked a new epoch in the history of
architecture. Itstsplendid spires and
pinnacles, and its silent statues, form
a veritable symphony in stone

wars and revolutions, mere

"THE NATIONAL FLOWER."
Carrie B. Adams' operetta in three
acts, "The National Flower," which is
to be civen at the Paris Grand on Fri
day night, April 11, promises to be one
of the most spectacular productions of
the season. It will be presented by
over 100 people of the Public School.
The substance of the play is set forth
in following argument:
Candidates for the position of the
National Flower have been summoned
before a judge and jury, there each one
to plead his own case. After giving
reasons for desiring to be the National
Flower, each aspirant remains to listen
to the stories of his rivals. Occasional
ly weeds stray in, to the horror of the
assembled flowers, and consternation is
great when an onion chances to look
in upon the scene. The jury which
will happily illustrate the way judical
affairs will be disposed of when women
are eligible to office - acting under the
instructions from the judge endeavors
to decide in favor of the most useful,
as well as the most beautiful flower.
Uncle Sam volunteers some valuable
information, after which the flowers
express their hearty approval of the
one chosen, and the contest is happily
and satisfactorily ended.
The following is the cast of char
acters: Judge Jerome Chapman.
Bailiff Paul Brannon.
Lawyers John Mahorney and Em
mett Curtis.
Sunflower J. S. Johnson.
Onion Sello Wollstein.
Oak Tree Allen Smith.

Postmasters Must Give All Time
to Job
A special trom Washington says:
"Hereafter Postmasters in the larger
offices uf the country are to be held
strictly accountable tor the time and
personal attention they give their offi
cial duties.
"Poslmaster General Burleson an
nounced today that he proposed not
merely to discourage, but to stamp
out the practice said to be followed
by many first and second class post
masters of imposing a considerable
Dart of their duties upon subordinates
in order to utilize the time for person

"r urthermore, the Postmaster Gen

first dose, and finally the cough will
disappear. O. H. Brown, of Musca
dine, Ala., writes: "My wife was

would not be living today." Known

edy for coughs and colds. Price 50c
