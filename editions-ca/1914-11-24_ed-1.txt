Comparativeclaim in the west and reawakened activity in the east, are taken by London to indicate that the German military chiefs have decided to concentrate their energies at the presentstag of the war toward dealing, ifpossible, a crushing blow to Russia.The storm continues and the watersof the North Sea flow through thelocks at Nieuport, which the alliesopened to flood the lowlands and holdback the German advance. Notwithstanding the extent of the . floodedarea the invaders hope to renew theiradvance. Large numbers of engineers are being sent -to the front andGerman ingenuity is to be put to thetest to provide a scientific method ofcrossing the inundated country.U. S. DETERMINED TO AVOID COMPLICATIONS.WASHINGTON, Nov. 20. On "theintent" of the Turks at Smyrna in firing on the launch of the cruiser Tennessee depends the outcome of the episode. Acting Secretary of State Lansing,Thursday night said the instructionsof the department to Ambassador Morgenthau were to make "inquiries" concerning the affair and advise thisGovernment fully.He drew a distinction between making "inquiries" and asking for an "explanation," although he admitted thatunder the instructions the Ambassador would be expected to find out howand why the firing occurred.President Wilson conferred Thursday night with Secretary Daniels, ofthe Navy Department, and Acting Secretary Lansing. The President sum-J moned the two Secretaries to learnii' there had been any word from Tur-Rey feiiedvung light on the reason3 forfiring. It there is continued delay, itis probable that the American Government will ask the British Admiraltyfor the courtesy of its wireless in thej Mediterranean to reach the Americansnips.Officials of the State Departmentemphasized the determination of this: Government to avoid becoming involved, in me hiuropean war. They indicate their intention to go to almostany length to avoid complications withTurkey.This is interpreted to mean that inthe event of an open rupture this Government would take no aggressiveaction. Its course would probably beto get all Americans out of Turkishterritory quickly. Inasmuch as theUnited States has assumed charge ofthe diplomatic interests of the allies, Iits activities would probably be ex- Jtended to getting out all Christians,even if in doing so it had to make useof armed forces.The belief is that when that is accomplished the United States will iwithdraw its ships and allow the ihole matter to hang fire until afterthe close of the European war. Thenit will present its bill tor indemnities, jand, if neccessary to use Lorce to obtain satisfaction, will do it at thatjtime, when it will be possible to evadehaving a part in the world war.wrA-a mappu TTMrmQ'rRTTnT'TT'nWASHINGTON,, Nov. 20.

In a very recent film storyon which he was at work, he engaged the services of a sharpshooter,whose duty was to make a "hit" asclose to the director as he dared.The scene of the picture shows Mr.Pinley shooting from a dismantledbarn with bullets splintering thewood within a few inches of his body.In the same picture, Mr. Pinley fallsfrom a horse and rolls down an embankment. The first time he essayedthe fall, it was so realistic that anew camera man became so interested in its sensational realism he neglected to film the scene. A secondattempt, the next day, was spoiledby a spectator, who, thinking Mr.Finley was hurt, rushed in front ofthe camera. The third time wassuccessful, so far as the actual taking of the scene was concerned, butMr. Finley, in his headlong descentdown the embankment, failed to notice a tree stump and a collision resulted in a very much bruised director, but a happy one, because of hisrealistic ambitions being fully realized.
