While both are intent upon management of the canal insuch a.manner as to insure free andunfavored competition, one group ofstatesmen believe that tnis can be accomplished by legislation regulatingprivate enterprise engaged in this territory, which another element is insistent that this can only be accomplishedby govprnmental ownership of a lineof ships to be built expressly for thistrade.Senator Bristow, of Kansas, who hasmade an exhaustive study of the affairsot the Pacific Mail steamship company, its relations to the transcontinental railroads and its suppression ofcompetition by water, is a determinedadvocate of Governmental control ofthe canal in such a manner as to assure that it will be a real competitorof the railroads. He and Senator Cummins, of Iowa, who wishes Uncle Samto build and operate a fleet of vesselsfor isthmian transportation, will worktogether :n formulating a logical andfeasible program to be presented forthe consideration of Congress this winter.Coroner's Jury Does Not FixBlame.The inquest over the bodies of Mrs.Barton ;C.

Describing the adventure, Herr Wagnerstates:"While we were on the way toTarndant, near Mount Elmue, a bandof thirty brigands surrounded us, andpointing their rifles, demanded $200.Sintes and I tried to come to an amicable settlement by offering to leaveour two mulus as guarantee in theirhands while we fetched the moneyfrom Tarndant and reclaimed the animals. "But the brigands refused and,keeping their rifles pointed at us,drove us along the roughest conceivable paths into the hills till we arrived at a lonely house belonging toSheikh All, captain of the band. OurMoorish servants were then plundered, stripped of their clothes, andturned adrift naked."One brigand wanted to cut off myservant's finger to obtain possessionof an almost worthless silver ringfixed firmly on it. But the servantrescued the finger by tearing off thering with his teeth. The brigandsthen placed us in a room four yardssquare, and fed us on bread and water for five days. We slept on theearthen floor."On the fifth day, the brigands having taken nearly all our clothes, thechief, with four followers, removedus to a deep, damp cellar where itwas dark day and night On the sixthday the brigand chief again appearedwith several followers, bearing a jugof water and two long sharpenedknives, and informed us he had sentthe Kaid of Tarndant an ultimatumthat unless a ransom of $500 was paidbefore 3 o'clock next morning, both ofus would be beheaded with theknives."They departed, locking the door,and leaving us to ponder on our approaching fate. Shortly before 3o'clock we heard a noise outside thedoor, and the Sheikh of Menisla andMulal Ammar, a friend of the Kaid ofTarndant, appeared with the brigandchief. They told ns the ransom waspaid, and we were liberated hurriedly."We left the place with our twomules along paths so rough that wewere unable to mount. We wereobliged to walk the whole distance.Sintes fainted from exhaustion several times, and we were, obliged tocarry ani drag him the last part ofthe wasr to Menisla."TAfXTf;fA vriFree ExhibitionWe Are Pleased to Exhibit Our Fall NoveltiesLadies5 Suits and SkirtsMillinery and Ladies' Long CoatsAlso Ladies' and Misses' FootwearSee our Ladies' Special Suits at $12.75Our Fall Drygoods, Dressgoods, Silk Department, Blanket and Comfort Now Completesh:j' - i.Kindly Call att.'tSfl i- JTWIN BROS.,Two Big Stores in One Cor. 7th and MainParis, KentuckytwVVfSlivKvaBGXliSliL-SSCured by the Marvel of the; Century, B.

Reformers Present SomeStartling Facts.Most Remarkable Development of AllIs Way In Which Those FromMiddle Class Patronize thePublic Houses.London. Once more the ultra temperance folk of England are "appalledby the growth of the drinking habitamong society women," and as if thiswere not bad enough the Band ofHope conference at Swansea is fairlyaghast at the increase of tipplingamong women of the middle classes.Samuel Manger, one time postmaster general of Australia, while deploring the fact that the society womandrinks, says that .as a rule she is careful not from any particular morality,but as a matter of expediency and topreserve her looks and that, moreover, she usually confines herself tochoice wines and. liquors. It is themiddle class Woman who has begoP3the 'Mr am drinker."Quoting the vicar of a select residential Jibndon suburb, Mr. Mangerdeclares the reverend gentleman said:"If only you could see into the drawing-roomsof my well-to-do narishioners you would find in 75 per cent, oflj$m ST.9JSe. in many cases younggirts, sitting' round playing firldge,smoking and drinking whisky andsoda."Go into any restaurant patronizedhy the middle classes " said Mr. Manger, "and you will see well-dressedwomen and even young girls-drinkingspirits, not only at dinner, but atluncheon."As if this were not sufficientlyshocking, the announcement is made"that "the most remarkable development of all is the way in which middle-classwomen patronize publichouses." In London we are told thewomenklnd of even professional andbusiness men make free use of the"pubs," while thirty years ago theupper middle class woman rarelytouched wines, and spirits not at all,and would have been ashamed of herself if seen in a public house.According to the reformers, this remarkable change in the customs andtastes of the middle class women isthe outgrowth of the practice of dining at restaurants. Society set thefashion of restaurant meals and themiddle class women followed their example, finding in whisky and soda atthe "pub" a convenient medium between the expense of wine and theplebeanism of beer.The hotel smoking lounge, too, weare told, has made dram drinkers ofmany women. Formerly, accordingto the temperance folk, if a man staying at a hotel wanted to smoke hewent to the smoking room, but now hejoins the ladies in the lounge and ifhe feels inclined to have a drink henaturally asks his fair companions tojoin him, and the modern womanmakes no bones about asking for a"peg" or a "whisky and."After declaring that drunkenness ina woman is much harder to cure thanin a man'. Mr. Manger announces thatof 3,031 persons admitted to inebriatereformatories during the last fewyears no fewer than 2,548 were women. POWER OF AUTOMATIC RIFLESwedish Inventor's Device Makes Ordinary Infantryman Much MoreFormidable in Battle.London. A Swede named Svensonclaims to have invented a new automatic rifle which may do away withmachine guns on the field of battle,while the ordinary infantry soldier,armed with this weapon, would become much more formidable than heis with his present eqpipment.The new invention has not onlybeen applied to rifles, but to fowlingpieces and other weapons. As regardsrifles, Mr. Svenson has invented twokinds of appliances, one of which canbe used as an ordinary rifle and another as a machine gun. Mr. Svensonclaims that his weapon can at will bemade to perform both functions without its weight in any way being increased. It can be loaded either atthe breach or underneath by insertingthe cartridge magazine.A company of infantry equippedwith the new rifle and forming a frontof 15 paces, can fire, it is said, 7ftshots per second, or if fitted with alarger magazine 240 to 2j0 shots inthree seconds. A battery of machineguns, consisting of four pieces servedby 16 men, with their officers, would,occupy a front of 15 paces and fire under the same conditions only 32 to 95shots, respectively, in th same spaceof time.In addition to this, machine gunsare difficult to transport, or to placein position, or to hide from the enemy,which is not the case with the rifleof the Svenson type.The new weapon is about the sameweight as the Mauser rifle, and hasthe same kind of barrel, but its entirelength is five centimeters shorter.Another advantage is its simplicityof constuction, possessing, as it does,only seventeen movable parts, Including the spiral springs.Get a Job Before Marrying.Chicago.

The ceremony is largely a matter of purchase.The men marry -when they are abouteighteen years of age and the girls atfourteen or even earlier.When a young lake man desires toget married he visits the father of hisprospective bride and puts forwardhis personal belongings as an inducement to the father to consent to theunion.If a man has a gun he is a great personage and can demand anything, butbesides their bows and arrows andspears most of the the Fapuans havevery little. Even agricultural produceis scarce, the only cultivation undertaken being on a very primitive scale.A little clearing is made by bothmen and women, and the women thengrow bananas and sweet potatoes.The men are always armed, and whenthe women go to the patch to attendto their crops or gather the producethe men go with them as a protection.The women, however, do the w6rk.Many families have a bundle of ancient Portuguese cloth centuries old,and when a young man is seeking abride one of these heirlooms is generally part of the deal. The youth andthe girl's father haggle over the marriage until eventually they agree toterms, and then the thing is done.The men are not limited to one wife,andonce a girl is married she is subject to her husband in everything andis practically his slave."In another part of New Guinea,"says a writer in the Wide World magazine, "I remember a distinctlj- strongconfirmation of the custom whichplaces a woman at the entire mercyof her husband. At one house I visited I saw standing outside the doorwaythree huge stone clubs, .each largeenough to fell a bullock."On making inquiries I found thatthey tallied with the number of wivesowing allegiance to the householder.The clubs were used by the man tobeat his wives with if they annoyedhim. The quaint part of it was thatwhile the women seemed to raise noobjection to being flogged unmercifully by their lord and master theywould not be beaten with the sameweapon as that used on another woman, so the native kept a separate clubfor each wife."Joke With a Sermon In It.A noted sociologist tells tho followingjj story of a woman In a manufacturing town.
