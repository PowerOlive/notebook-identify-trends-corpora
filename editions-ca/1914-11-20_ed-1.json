Burley tobacco is estimated at G54
pounds per acre as against 655 pounds

less tobacco is damaged in quality as
a result of excessive rain during the
early part of October. The damage
is estimated at 17 per cent. For the

ed to be damaged at 13 per cent, with
a yield of 840 pounds per acre as

The area of wheat sown was in
creased over last year's acreage 2

is more late sown wheat than usual,
