Butthe double defeat could not effect thestanding ot the Paris club and theywill meet the Hustlers in the firstgame cf the deciding series Wednesday afternoon at Garner's Park.The contest yesterday afternoon atWhite Park between the Rivermenand the Bourbonites was brilliant inthe extreme, resulting in a completeshutout for the locals. Frank Romine,who twirled the opening game atMaysville on the ninth of May andwon, pitched the last game of the season for his club and came out the victor. Th game was snappy all the waythrough, both teams putting up an excellent article of ball, but the Bourbonites were extremely weak beforethe big right-hander, and hits camefew and far between. Besides allowing but three hits, Romine fannedseven of the opposing batsmen, andfor six innings did not allow a singleBourbonite to anchor uafely on thefirst station.Hauser as well as Romine pitchedfaultless ball, faring badly in the fourthsession when the visitors buenhedtheir bingles and counted the onlyruns of the game. Not until two weredown in the three last rounds did Romine allow a Bourbonite to reach thefirst station, and invairably the following batter would hit into an easy out.Practically the only chance thelocals had to score was in the eighthwhen after Maxwell and Kuhlman hadgone out, Chapman doubled to rihtcenter and Hauser reached first onCarmony 's error.

Thier revival of the sweetmelodies of the South reminiscentante-bellum days the plantation thecotton fields and the levee has been amusical revelation to millions,The event of the season, commencing today, marks the sixty-third annual exhibition of theBourbon County AgritulturalSociety and the gates of the historic organization will be thrownopen to the public this morning.The annual fair in this city hasfor years past attracted peoplefrom far and near, and the exhibition which will begin thismorning, give promise of a successful week from every point ofview.Lacking a little less than amonth it has been seventy-fiveyears since the Bourbon CountyAgricultural Society was first organized and the first fair heldunder the direction of the organization. During the many years intervening the popularity of theBourbon fair has been attestedfay the world-wide reputation itattained, and since its birth hasbeen at the head of the countyfairs of the State, and widelyknown as the oldest fair west ofthe Allegheny mountains.Few are alive today who canrecall the first fair held in Parisunder this organization. Theoriginal charter of the Society ison record in the County Clerk'soffice and is regarded as a raredocument.While history shows the firstfair was held in Bourbon countyin 1836, there are records to showthat as early as 1821 a fair washeld in Col. Clay's woods, a fewmiles from Paris on the Winchester pike, It is understoodto have been an exhibition ofstock alone.The organization of the Bourbon County Agricultural Societywas first determined upon June6, 1836, when a number of farmers met in this city on court daywhen the subject was taken upresulting in the calling of a meeting for that purpose to be heldon the ninth of July. GeneralGarrard at this meeting waselected as president of the neworganization, Wm. P. Hume andNimrod Lindsay, vice presidents;Thomas Y. Brent, treasurer;Thos. P. Thornton, corresponding secretary, and Hiram Bledsoem, recording secretary.A committee was appointed toprepare a constitution and at ameeting on July 30, 1836. the organization was completed by theby the adoption of the constitution and the election of a boardof directors composed of Geo. W.Williams, Henry T. Duncan,Henry Clay, Sr., Jas. W. Coggswell, Brutus J. Clay, Col. JohnCunningham, Wm. Hickman,Jere Duncan, Chas. S. Brent andHenry Towles.The first fair under the neworganization was held the lastday of September and the firstday of October, 1836. The listof premiums was not very attractive and the schedule of entrieswas very short. The entire resources of the Society, includingsubscriptions, donations, entrancefees, etc., aggregated $584.50, ofwhich amount $450 were paid outin nremiums and 35 for otherexpenses.After serving the Society fortwo years President Garrard diedand in 1838 Wm. P. Hume succeeded him, filling the office until 1841, when Major George W.Williams was chosen.Up until the year of 1845 similar societies teroughout the statesuffered a decline under thepressure of financial troubles.Leaving the Bourbon Society theonly survivor, with its conditionweakened by the financial strain,but during the year followingconditions and prospects wereconsiderably improved.Up to that time the'exhibitionshad been held on the piece ofbottom land near the junction ofStoner and Houston creeks, anda portion of what is now knownas White Addition.

'S4v4il'the old Kentucky Midland depotand the grounds improved. Theamphitheatre was constrscted ina circular hollow, the side beinggraded in seats for the accommodation of the spectators. Aboard fence four feet high separated this from the show ring.Marks of this rude arrangementremained for several years.Four years later, in 1850, atract of ten acres was added tothe first purchase and the wholewas enclosed by a high boardfence. In 1852 Major Williamstendered his resignation as president of the Society and BrutusJ. Clay was elected to succeedhim. At a cost of approximately $10,000 a new amphitheatre,handsome cottages and convenient booths were erected. Shortly afterwards eight more acresof ground was added, making atotal of twenty-eight acres. In1856 the State Agricultural Society erected a floral hall and anumber of box stalls which weresubsequently purchased by theBourbon County AgriculturalSociety. To these more improvements were added.With the guidance of tEe organization gradually passing intoyounger hands, the young mencomposing the majority of theBoard of Directors desiring tokeep fully abreast with the timesdecided to introduce new features in the way of trotting, running and pacing races. To thisend the old circular amphitheatre was torn down in 1886 andin the early spring of the yearfollowing several more acres ofground was purchased, a splendid half-mile track built, and anew grandstand seating 7,000people, judges and music standsand new stables built. A newfloral hall was erected just southof the grandstand. At this meeting the fiftieth anniversary ofthe existence of the Society wascelebrated in an appropriatemanner and in the presence of alarge crowd.The change from the old to thenew ideas of conducting thecounty fair did not meet with theapproval of the farming classesand, the attendance dwindleddown year after year until 1896the society was confronted by anoverwhelming debt. The fateof the organization was decidedon December 10, 1896, when firedestroyed the amphitheatre,stands and a goodly portion ofthe fence around the race track.Already burdened with debtthe society decided not to rebuildand with this decision passed thehope of reviving the famous oldBourbon Fair, and ten yearspassed before the movement forreorganizing the Society wasconsidered.The question of reorganizing theSociety was agitated year afteryear following the destructionby fire of the buildings, butwithout any result and thegrounds of tee Society were divided into small tracts and passed into the hands of real estatespeculators and home buildersand is rapidly becoming one ofthe most attractive residene sections of the city.The reorganization of the Society was undertaken in the early spring of 1906, when it wasproposed by the promoters tofloat enough stock to purchasesuitable grounds and erect astand, stalls and other necessarybuildings.The proposed movement metwith hearty support and a tractoi land containing AZ 3-4 acresat the intersection of the Bethlehem and Maysville and Lexington turnpikes was purchasedfrom Mr. E. K. Thomas at a costof $8,500.An amphitheatre fashionedafter that erected in 1852 wasbuilt and stock stalls erected.The grounds were improved bythe planting of trees, andlbeaufful walks were laid from eachentrance. All this work wascompleted before scheduled dateof the fair, and the first exhibition held by the newly organizedSociety was held in September,1906.With each succeeding year theSociety has added i mprovementsto the extent of whatever theirsurplus would permit, and extended many premiums whichhave attracted the finest exhibibitions of stock of any fair inKentucky.Since the organizationLook at my bargains in wallthis week.
