BURLESON INAUGURATES
NEW PARCEL POST RATES.
Postmaster General Burleson has in
augurated the new regulations chang
ing the parcel post rates and weight
limit by mailing President Wilson a
box of fine Georgia peaches. The box
which weighed seventeen pounds with
a postage of 13 cents, was delivered
at the White House early in the day.
With it came a note in which the
Posmaster Genei.1 said:
"This is an illustration of the oppor
untunity which has been opened to the
farmer, the horticulturist, the manu
facturer and to every citizen of the
country who will avail himself of this
valuable adjunct of the postal service
in the promotion of commerce and
hppiness of our peoyfe."
The new regulation which is now
in effect, raises the maximum weight
of parcel post packages from eleven
to twenty pounds, and ,makes certain
changes in the rates. The local deliv
ery rate of postage are reduced from
5 cents for the first pound and 1 cent
for each additional two pounds or
fraction thereof. The first and second
zones, covering a radious of 150miles
from each local postoffice, were con
solidated and rates in them reduced
from 5 cents for the first pound and 3
cents for each additional pound (the
first zone rate) and 6 cents for the
first pound and 4 cents for each addi
tional pound (second zone rate) to 5
cents for the first pound and 1 cent for
each additional pound.
