For somemonths the colony had been In danger of extinction at the hands of theIroquoR Dollard, who had come tothe colony three years before, at theap;e of twenty-two, asked leave ofMalsonneuve to lead a party of Volunteers against the Iroquois. It wasknown that hundreds of Indian warriors lay at the mouth of the Richelieu river, below Montreal, while nun- 1dreds more were on the Ottawa river,above Montreal, Three Rivers and Quebec were to be wiped out. Dollard'splan was to meet the Indian warriorson their way down the Ottawa andgive battle, regardless of numbers.Sixteen men joined him in his desperate enterprise.

Dollard and his men tookpossession of a palisade fort near theriver's edjre, built by an Algonquin warparty some months before. They wereJ .oon joined by 40 friendly Hurons andfour Algonquin.In a day or two the Iroquois madetheir appearance. Tlieir advance guard,while making an attempt to land, wasfired upon.

The Indians quickly descend-I ed the rapid in their war canoes andfell to the attack.They rushed upon the little garrison,but were driven back. Capturing thebirch canoes of the Frenchmen andtheir Indian companions, they set themablaze and attempted to do the samewith the palisade. A withering firegreeted them and they retired in defeat.

Calvary is not a story of twothousand years ago. It has been repeated a thousand times in Armeniawhere the merciless hand of theTurk has defiled everything withinhis touch. For 1,300 years thepeople of the Near East have beenrighting the battle of Christianity.They have been burned at the stake,flayed alive and crucified but havenot renounced their faith. Theyhave been exiled in the wildernessand the road from the Caspian Seato the Persian Gulf is strewn withthe skulls' of their saints.The Turkish sword has taken halfof the oldest Christian nation andhunger is threatening the other half.Shall we permit them to perish ofhunger this winter and allow theTurk to rejoice that he has accomplished the purpose of the ages?Christmas morn in America willbe vastly different from Armenia.Far away across the ocean in theBible Lands made sacred by thefootsteps of our Saviour, other littlechildren awake on the same Christmas morn to find what?Gifts? No not even stockings toput them in if there were gifts noteven stockings to wear! The fireplace if there be one is cold anddreary. Down its bleak and cheerless chimney no jolly Santa Claushas ever ventured. His reindeer donot know the road. And yet ifSanta Claus were to come that way,what do you suppose would be thedearest treasure in his pack?Candy? Fancy handkerchiefs, Golden trinkets? No!Bread; only bread that to thousands of little starving tots, wouldbe the greatest boon of all on Christmas morn.It is not so much what will happento Armenia but what will happen toAmerica if she fails to respond tothe cry of these Christian peoples.Armenia is perilously near losing herpopulation but America is dangerously near losing her soul unless shesteps forward and succors thesedown-trodden people.Five dollars a month will feed achild; ten dollars a month will feedand clothe it and fifteen dollars amonth feed, clothe and educate it.How much can you undertake?Make check payable to Dr. E.
