Committee announced$16,000 raised. Court House andfire bells rine. whistles shriek.The generous responses made to theRed Cross appeals"?or contributionsby the people of Paris and Bourboncounty during the "National RedCross Week," demonstrates one factthat they are ever ready to heedthe call of suffering and distressand to be ready with their funds forjust such a call as that voiced bythe Red Cross. In that week theywere called upon to raise the sum of$15,000 for Red Cross purposes, andthey set to work with a vengeanceand right hearty good will that nodoubt must have astonished even themost sanguine.They were called upon to assist inone of the most gigantic philanthropic undertakings in the history of theworld to raise their apportionmentof the immense sum of $100,000,000for the National Red Cross, and inthe language of the Bowery "Theydone it." They used every honorable endeavor, and met with not asingle refusal so far as known. Bymass-meeting methods' by personalsolicitation by the members of theRed Cross Chapter, by handsomeyoung women, by committees appointed by the Red Cross organization, and by other equally effectivemethods, the contributions rolled inuntil Bourbon county stands tonight with the debit side cleared andthe balance carried to the creditside of the Red Cross ledger.One of the methods employed wa3a feature of Saturday afternoon. Alarge American flag, carried by fourpretty young members of the localRed Cross Chapter, preceded by adetachment of the National Guardstationed here, and two buglers, paraded the streets of Paris, solicitingcontributions for the fund in sumsof five cents to any amount the contributor might wish to donate.They secured quite a large sum thisway, which was promptly turnedinto the fund. They missed no one,and no one refused to contribute.All day long yesterday bands ofunselfish women spent the day in theheadquarters of the Red Cross in theKriener building, and at the sewing room at the corner of Main andThird streets, in making supplies ofdifferent kinds for Red Cross work.Fifteen thousand dollars seemslike a large sum, but when it is real-.ized that it goes to make up part ofa still greater sum to relieve thesufferings of more men, women andchildren than ever before in the history of any war; when you thinkthat about one hundred millions isabout the sum expended every dayby the nations at war; when we- realize that $350,000,000 was expendedIn Belgium relief alone, it is easyto &e that $15,000 seems a pitifulsum. But it will do its bit, just thesame, and grateful hearts will acknowledge it.The money which has been collected from the public will be carefullyaccounted for and statements will bemade to Congress covering all expenditures. The needs of the Red Crossare world-wide, and the need of thefund will be brought to our owndoors, when some of "our boys" comeback from the front, maimed,- sick,suffering, in need of help of a material kind. And, there, as always,will be found the angels of mercy,the Red Cross nurses, those sweet-faced, ministering ones wnobe ia-bors have been made possible by yourcontributions. That will be the realwork of the Red Cross.Af n1A lirkiir nf rinsincr our renort'Mrs. VannooKthe amount totaled $15,400 and itwas estimated it would reach$16,000. It was impossible to get acomplete list of the contributions tothe fund.

The work ofthe committees went far into thenight and exeact figures could not-obtained, but it will more than coverthe allotted $15,000 asked for.Xittle Rock's donations amounted to$513.25 and Millersburg contributed the handsome sum of $2,000.JUNE 23, 1917 SIXTH DAY.Itfr.

He was knocked down, the machine passing overhim. His face was cut and he sustained severe bruises on the arms,but was otherwise uninjured. Hewas removed to his home, where hisinjuries received medical attention.Mr. Denton stated that he dideverything in his power to warn Mr.Wilder, but to no avail. He sounded his horn several times, but Mr.Wilder either did not hear it, or,hearing it, thought he could getacross the street before the machinereached him. The fender of the machine was bent by. the force of thecollision.fa las faMAY HAVE A NEW DAM ON OLDDAM SITE.There is a probability of the different interests using the water inStoner Creek getting together at laston the matter of replacing the present dam across Stoner at the ParisMilling Co.'s plant with a concretestructure of the most approved paltern. It was stated Saturday by a representative of the Milling Companythat engineers had inspected the location, and the condition of the olddam, and that plans would be madesoon for a new structure, to beerected at low water some time inthe fall. Extensive repairs are contemplated on the old wooden dam assoon as the stage of water will permit. The new dam may not be placed in the same location as the present one, but will not be very faraway.Fishermen have expressed somedisapprobation of the bathing privileges being granted to youngsters atthe dam, but Mr. Renick, heedingthe call of his own youth, refuses tointerfere with the boys' and girls'pleasures, telling the kickers there'splenty of fish and water in otherparts of the creek.

The successful man accepts only the best sideof conditions. He is active we haveheard of the "psychological effect."Get busy!This is not the time to waste;this is the time to make your initiative. Every shot must hit the mark.. This is the time when returns must-be obtained. The man who does notaccept defeat Is the man who conducts his business at the present timeand through present and coming conditions with an aggressiveness thatwill bring results and accomplish thepurpose for which he Is working.The present war has heen calledan industrial war. This would indicate that the pressure and demandfor efficiency is greater now and willbe in the future than in the past.To meet the situation must meanthat the utmost energy must begiven to all kinds of business.Prepare to handle your share, asyour share will be in proportion toyour energy and activity. Let'o"Business As Usual."t m taSTUNG AGAIN.Doubtless that's the expressionmany merchants of Paris are usingwho invested their coin on a four byAve directory gotten out by a Lexington concern, purporting to be a complete directory of Paris and otherplaces. The alleged directory ismainly an advertisement for Lexington, and the space occupied for Parisand Bourbon county is comparativelyInsignificant.The "directory" gives one barber. shop; one newspaper; one attorney;one furniture concern; one funeraldirector (colored), one dentist; oneautomobile firm; one departmenttore; one printing establishment;'oa reterinarian; three physicians;' . transfer company, and a few oth-r ictttering lines of business! Andtkis is a directory for a town of overrren thousand people. There's mostanything in a name, it seems, if thislittle pamphlet can be called a dlrec-tryfy?It seems that Paris people willmerer learn not to go up against oneof these things. Some time ago arepresentative of one of the largest' directory publishing firms in the-United States was in Paris, sounding:the people on the prospects of -gettingout a real complete directory of thelatest approved kind, for the city.Nothing more has been heard fromthe firm, but it is probable that thework will be undertaken soon. Thesepeople propose to publish a directory complete In every respect. Butas long as Paris merchants continueto sink their money in these littlefly-by-night concerns, they oughtnot to complain if they are stung.This "directory" even failed to givethe name of Judge B. B. January,Police Judge of Paris, in the list ofcity officials. Other branches of the.city government were also ignored.Aadthat is called a "directory."Parish the thought!'t-tz z miti-20?.

They were"traveling light," and when theywere not able to make a town intime for refreshments, rustled theirown nieals, and had a good timegenerally, regardless of consequences. From the time they left Cincinnati, coming through CentralKentucky, they had not one unpleasant experience, and found that Kentucky hospitality had not sufferedany by the laps of time or circumstances. They were often entertained at farmhouses on the way,where every attention was shownthem, and started on their way tothe next place with a hearty "Godbless you, and good luck to you.".

Tropical temperatureswere also reported everywhere westof the Oder River. News reports Ofhorse races and other sporting eventfeature "the terrific, abnormal,scorching" heat. Many horses werescratched on the opening day of theHamburg Derby week because thetrack, built on a marshy cornermoor, was baked too hard for safety.The weather bureau states thatthe prospects for rain or lower temperatures are very slight. The effectof the drouth on grain, crops aroundBerlin, where only eight millimetersof rain have fallen since May 1, isdescribed by a neutral who arrived inCopenhagen recently as almost catas1trophal.

The Allies, on the otherhand, have taken from Germany,Togoland, Kamerun, German Southwest Africa, German East Africa, theBismarck, Archipelago, the CarolineIslands, the German islands of theSamoan group, Kiao Chao, and territory in Galicia, Bukowina and Armenia a total area of 3,228,341square kilometres, or ten times asmuch territory as Germany's seizures amount to. While the Frenchman is not in favor of any settlement on the war map basis, he holdsthat Germany could not afford sucha settlement, because she cannotexist without colonies.I5i 5i SnTOR YOUR SCRAP BOOK.THE SOUTH WILL ANSWER.American eagles are soaring high, asAmerica draws the sword.And the grand old flag, that in battle's fray has never yet beenlowered,TTrts hpfn raisArl aerain for thfi rlerhtsof wen, nsla.Y$i by a selfish IAna te -cep to cover the nlrnf.flag, and the seas of the piratecrew.'

The press ofEngland made the first successes ofthe Allies possible, and the Englishpapers continued loyal to the government.

While the W. C.

S. Department of Agriculture, who describe measuresthat may be employed.For cutworms, lumps of poisonedbait, made by mixing about 50pounds of bran or corn meal withtwo pounds of Paris green, six finelychopped oranges or lemons, andcheap molasses to make a stiff dough,should be scattered along the cornrows at planting time or as soon asinjury from the cutworms is noticed.Information as to these poison baitswill be furnished on application tothe Bureau of Entomology.Treating the seed with coal tarwill usually repel attacks of brids,and, in some cases, those of burrowing rodents. A teaspoonful of tar isenough for a peck of corn. Mix thetar with a quart of boiling water.After the mixture has cooled somewhat, but is still hot, stir in thecorn until every grain is coated, andthen spread it out to dry beforei planting. Corn may be immersedseveral minutes in moderately hotwater without affecting germination.The tar treatment does not repel miceor ground squirrels.Destruction of corn ' by groundsquirrels, prairie-dogs, pocket gophers, or mice is best prevented bypoisoning the animals a few days before the corn is planted. Strychnineis the best poison in all cases, but toobtain satisfactory results a specialformula is needed for preparing thepoison for each kind of animal.Such formulas have been worked outby the Bureau of Biological Surveyand special instructions will be furnished upon application. Paris greenand strychnine are poisons and shouldnot be placed where children or domestic animals can get them.
