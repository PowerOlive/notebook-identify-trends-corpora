negotiations looking toward theconfirmation of peace advanced a longstep Wednesday -when tluy secretary ofstate and the French ambassadoragreed upon the terms upon whichfuture negotiations for a treaty are tobe conducted andreduced these to theform of a protocol This protocolit is true is yet -to be signedand it is to y be submitted tothe Spanish before theformal signatures are affixed butthe administrations view as to theprogress made Wednesday was set outin Secretary bays sentence It isexpected that this pi otocol will be executed There is alwa3s the possibility in dealing with the Spanish government that it may recede at the lastmoment from an implied agreementbut it is scarcely probable that itwould be willing to involve the Frenchambassador in the difficulties thatwould follow what to the world wouldseem to be a repudiation of his benevolent efforts in behalf of SpainThere must be a delay possiblyfrom 24 to 4 hours before the nextstep can be taken and the protocolmade binding upon both the UnitedStates and Spain bv the attachment ofthe signatures of the plenipotentiariesSecretary Day for the United Statesand M Cambon for Spain The delaywill be largely attributable to physicalcauses The protocol is long it mustbe translated and turned back and forthinto code and simple language no lessthan five times before it reaches Madrid through the French foreign officeThis work was not begun until lateWednesday afternoon after it had consumed the best energies of AssistantSecretary Adce of the state department and M Thinbeaut secretary ofthe French embass3T in the preparation in formal shape of two copies ofthe protocol one in English and onein French These were prepared caref ull the idiomatic variance in the twolanguages necessitating the greatestcaution in order that the identicalcharacter of the two copies should bepreserved The length of the protocolimposed a great amount of labor uponthe cipher clerks or whoever ischarged with the work of renderingthe original into cipher so that altogether it is apparent that the consumption of time involved in purelytechnical functions will be considerable as to makeUie rendition of aveiy early answer improbableAs to the character of the protocolit can be stated on authority that theterms are in all practical points thoseset out in the abstract of the presidents conditions published from thewhite house a week ago From thisfact it is deduced that the extra conditions or qualifications sought to beimposed by the4 Spanish governmentwere abandoned at least in large partby the French ambassador This deduction is supported by the circumstance that in the early morningand before the conference between feecx etaryDay and M Cambon which resulted inthe agreement there was a prevalentimpression based Upon the utterancesof public men whofhad talked with thepresident that the Spanish answerwas unsatisfactory and that the negotiations looked as if they mightterminate suddenly As this situation changed so suddenly after theconference it may be fainy assumed that the ambassador abandonedthe conditions which the presidentwas reputed to have regarded as unsatisfactorv It is believed that theprotocol carries within itself provisionfor the cessation of hostilities Onthis point the naval contingent isurgent that our government adoDtthe Napoleonic policy of refusingto enter into an armistice without requiring some substantial pledgeto secure the consummation ofpeace What they particularly desireis that our government shall demandas a condition of the cessation of hostilities the surrender to the UnitedStates military forces of Morro castleat the entrance of Havana harbor andsome such points of vantage at theother important ports in the territorysoon to fall under our cmtrolThe peace negotiations are now believed to be advanced to a point wherethe president has felt warranted inturning his attention to the selectionof the commissioners to be charged bythe United Slates with the drafting- ofa treaty of peaceThe Sixth May lie Returned to CincinnatiCincinnati Aug 11 A telegramfrom the secretary of war to ExecutiveDirector Melish of the citizens G AR

second national encampment of the Grand Armyof the Republic promises to beTeplete with interesting features3rour hundred of Cincinnatis leadingcitizens have been engaged since last-winter planning and preparing thesefeaturesKot the least interesting is the policepreparations Cincinnatis policeforce is recognized the country overas having attained an unusually highdegree of proficiency The citys reputation in that respect is not excelledby any other city in the country Formany years Col Philip Deitsch an oldsoldier has been at the head of the police -force of Cincinnati Years ofpatient and earnest endeavor on hispart encouraged by the support of anonpartisan police board have enabledhim to reach present resultsAs soon as it was known that the1898 encampment was to come to Cinoinnati Chief Deitsch began planningfor a 3rear hence lie recognized thefact that the citys present force whileample protection in ordinary timesrcas not sufficient to cope with thelarge crowds to be found at every encampment Not in years has an encampment been held at which Cincinnati did not have at least three or fourfletectives to assist the departmentiii the encampment city These experienced men Chief Deitsch decidedto make the nucleus around whichto build a large and adequate force ofthief takers to work in conjunctionith the police properThe standing force consists of 350policemen Prom these Chief Dietschselected 50 of the oldest and most reliable men their record for arrests andbrilliant captures of men wanted in1 -imam mGRAND ARMY ENCAMPMENT AT CINCINNATIGrand Triumphal Arch to Be Erected on Government Squareother cities being taken into consideration For the past six months these50 men have been in constant trainingfor detectives Cincinnati has an unusually complete rogues gallery wherepictures of every noted criminal in thecountry and many from abroad are tobe found Cincinnati was also one ofthe first American cities to adopt theBertillion system of identifying criminals Chief Deitsch being to day at thehead of the national Bertillion systemWith these two anrple records of roguesmake ups to stud the 50 picked menare to day experienced detectives atleast in that part of the art of pickingoufcriminals which is so essential ata large gathering These -50 menadded to the already large present force were placed underthe direct charge of Chief of Detectives Larry Hazen The force is nowwell organized and at least a week before the encampment they will be stationed at all the depots hotels and onfrequented thoroughfares to interceptsuch members of the light fingeredgentry as may venture to Cincinnati toply their nefarious trade With such awell organized force of detectives tocome in contact with it is safe to saythat few of those who do yield to thetemptation to visit Cincinnati the firstweek in September will remain in thecity long after learning the exhaustivepreparations made for their captureThe force of patrolmen will also begreatly augmented and will include allprivate watchmen of the city Thesemen are also receiving special weeklyinstructions to put them in readinessfor the encampment work It is safeto say that at least 1000 patrolmenand detectives will be on duty to guardthe hundreds of thousands of visitorsexpected from all parts of the countryIn addition to this general policeprotection arrangements have beenmade to extend special protection tothe veterans who will occupy freequarters in the school buildings of thecity Two special officers will be assigned to each building each standing watch 12 hours They will be under the supervision of an officer of theday for each building life usual planthe bir parade by stretching wires onloth sides of the streets over whichthe veterans will march will be followed in this city To accomplish allthis requires- no little expenditure ofmoney and Q000 has been set asidely the citj authorities for arranginglor these special protectivefeaturesFrom this 10000 also will be provided an elaborate system of sanitar3rregulations for public comfort TheTjoard of city affairs having in mindthe mealth of citizens and visitorsalik4 will establish in all sectidnsofTHE BOTJKBON

takento minister to the physical wants particularly of the veterans There is noworganized a medical staff consistingof more than 300 reputable Cincinnatiphysicians who will devote their timeand talent encampment week to treating sick visitors This staff has beenorganized by Dr J C Culbertson editor of the Lancet and Clinic He isan old soldier and a member of thegrand army and all the ranking members of his staff are physicians whosaw active service as surgeons in thewar of 01 to 05 These physicians willbe uniformed and each will be provided with a special medicine bag containing remedies which are of valuein cases of sudden illnessThe bags and medicine were presented to Dr Culbertson by a prominent Philadelphia drug house as acompliment to him To make the workof these 300 physicians practical andeffective the city will be districted andeach physician will be assigned to acertain district One physician willalso be assigned to each school building where veterans are quartered andwill make a daily visit to see if hisservices are needed These men willlook after the general health of theold soldiers Another division of themedical corps will be assigned topoints at which large crowds are likely to gather the desire being to havemedical or surgical aid always instantly available Accordingly some physicians will be assigued to ConeyIsland the Lagoon Chester park andother of the pleasure resorts On theboats plying to and from Coney islandstill other physicians will be stationedOn Thursday nightwhenthe fireworksdisplay will be given at three differentparts of the city simultaneously nnumber of phyicians will be scatteredthrough the crowd Their uniformwill be of such a nature as to plainly indicate their callingThe efforts of the citizens of Cincinnati along this line will not however be confined to necessities Beside the protection afforded by thepolice and the physicians a committeeon public comfort will go even fur-ther and provide some of the luxuriesof life Doing an encampment is atbest tiresome work In other citiesit has been no uncommon sight to see-well-dressedpeople sitting on the curbstones to rest their weary limbs Inthis city- a committee of which W CJohnson -a grand army veteran ischairman will provide places of restfor men and women separately onnearly every square in the heart of theeity All vncant storerooms vtill beconverted into comfortable quarterswith a profusion of chairs and cotsand a liberal supply of ice waterThese piaces will be marked sothat anyone who becomes tired on thesidewalk can look forward or backward and find one within his view Inthese retreats the old soldiers can sitdown ami read or write or can take anap on one of the cots The placesof rest for the ladies will be in thechurches in the downtown districtsThey will be fitted up with all theequipments that tend to bring comfort to a weary womanThe one ambition of the people ofCincinnati is to send the old soldierand his friends home as well as theycame and satisfied with their enter-tainment VtflLL L FINCHThe Annexation of TexasThe annexation of Texas brought onthe Mexican war That brought a largeaddition to our territory It wasnecessary to

Thousands of tons ofthis liber is raised annually on thePacific slopes of the southern islandswhere it also grows wild That thisis the leading product oE the Philippines is due to the fact that its cultivation requires the least effort Withonjy careless attention it is possible toraise many tons to the acre Theiiber is obtained from u species ofplantain cabled abaca a tree whichgrows to the height of from 15 to 20feet and i5 from 8 to 12 inches indiameter The trunk may be as easily separated as a stalk of celeiy Anordinary knife only is required tocut down the tree and a rude instrument is used to press out the juiceand shred the fiber After a littledryiiig in the sun and packing it intobales of 240 pounds each it is readyfor shipment The United States andi England take almost the entire cropHemp of this kind is grown nowhereelse in the world It is said that afori une awaits one who can invent amachine which will accelerate theprocess of pressing out the juice andpulp leaving only the fiber A rudeIvnife and a lever for holding it strongly in position are the instruments now j3n iiseNext in the order of importance asa product of the soil is sugar Thepoorest sugar in the world is producedIn the Philippines and yet the islandsare capable of producing- the bestThe reason for the poor quality liesin the method of manufacturing and-not in any disadvantage of sil climateor character of the cane which isrsuperior in saccharine The methodsof sugar manufacture which prevailedin the fifteenth century are still invogue in the PhilippinesThe third product of the Philippinesm the order of importance is tobaccoWhile the United States furnishes amarket for the hemp and sugar ofManila scarcely any of its tobaccoor cigars is brought to this countryexcept now and then upon sailing vessels engaged in eastern trade Butthe crop is an important one and tobacco and cigars have long held thesame reputation in the east that theHavana product holds in the westXately the industry has shown a tendency to expand owing to the factthat the Spanish government realizing in one instance at least the effectsof aji evil policy has abandoned itsmonopoly ofthe tradeThere are few other products of agriculture to be mentioned Fruit isrip t cultivated but grows wild inabundance and variety characteristicof a tropical country Bananas of delicious flavor oranges of poor qualitymangos guavas and many other native fruits grow wild There are noolives or tigs and there is no vineculture Dairy farming has not yetbeen established in the islands although there is said to be

massacred by Indians in1799 has just been honored by a celebration in the town of Colesville nearBinghamton X Y by her descendantsOn the farm of Thomas Taylor in thetown of Colesville stands a tumble-down log cabin The cabin originallyx was the property of Zedekiah Hamlinwho with his family came to thissection from Connecticut before thebreaking out of the revolution Thevalley was a meeting place for the Indians and while the tribes were allfriendly Mr Hamlin with an eye tothe necessity fofc possible future defense built his house like a miniaturefort One daughter Dorothy wasknown far and wide among the redinhabitants of the valley as Wachitathe song bird If ajiapoose was illshe would visit the lodge sometimestraveling miles on foot or horsebackto administer simple remedies andcroon it to sleep Thus she gained thegood will of the red men and was safeat any time of the day or night in thedepths of the forestThis was the state of things whenin 1799 the news was flashed amongthe tribes in this section that GenSullivan with troops was comingdown the valley to avenge the Cherryvalley massacre and tliough the Indians in this vicinity had no hand init all would be slain Night saw thehills in and around Binghamton redwith signal tires summoning tribesfrom all quarters to a conference atthe junction of the two rivers MissHamlin had a brother in Sullivanst army and this was known to a squawwhose baby the yirl hadsaved bj careful mirsing At dusk the second davafter the big talk the squaw creptto the threshold of the Hamlin cabinand whispered to Miss Dorothy that ifshe wished to save her brother sheshould warn the white soldiers totvoid the main road at a spot be tweenthis city and Union as a large bodyof Indians was in ambush there Inorder to find him Miss Dorothy mustgo alone The brave girl did not hesiTate for a moment but hastily preparing she started out with only thestars for a guide Her travels throughthe country and contact with the Indians had given her an insight intowood lore that now proved valuableAfter 54 hours of continuous travelshe reached the outpost of Gen Sullivans camp and delivered her messageA company of soldiers was detailed tomake a flank movement on the enemyand drive them from ambush Theattack was such a complete surprise tothe Indians that they retreated inhasteNow once a 3ear on the anniversary of this day- the descendants ofMiss Hamlin and a few invited neighbors commemorate the event by a picnic in the woods near the log cabinand -at each gathering the history ofthe brave act is read The picnic hasbeen a family

height the actor whoimpersonated Sir Joseph Porter duringa production of that opera at the Varieties theater New Orleans had a makeup which transformed him into anexact facsimile of Admiral Murray ofthe United States navy who was thenstationed at New Orleans One night anold salt of Murrays command was sitting in the front jaw of the galleryWhen Sir Joseph Porter made his firstentrance ho gazed upon him for a moment as if doubting the evidence of hissenses and then muttered to himselfBottovoce I m blest if that isnt oldMurrayRising fronf his seat and making asea scrape ho called out Good dayyour honor v The special officer wasgoing to eject him but the manager ofthe house who had observed him forbade it and told the officer to let the oldfellow enjoy himself to his hearts content so long as he did not become soboisterous as to disturb the performanceWhenever Sir Joseph came on orwent off the stage the old salt wouldrise and honor him with a salute andafter the fall of the curtain he proposedand gave three cheers for Admiral Murray A naval lieutenant who was present subsequently told me that when theold fellow went on board his skip nextday he had to bo put in irons for refusing to obey an order from his superiorofficer unless that functionary wouldfollow the example of the gallant eaptain of tho Pinafore and say If youplease De Wolf Hopper in NewYork HeraldBathing
