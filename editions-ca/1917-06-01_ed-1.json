those little lines, "O, what so rare
Qh a day in June?" had been a resi

would have wondered why he ever
went into hysterics over such a thing

STRONG LANGUAGE
PROM A PARSON!
'
One of the most unusual and most
sensational utterances ever made in
ttle South caused tears to spring to
the eyes of hundreds of business men
at El Paso, Texas, Tuesday night, in
the course of an address to an audi-
ennfi nf Tfixans. hv "Rpv Dr. Newton
Dwight Hillis, the noted Brooklyn,
New York, pulpit orator.
Dr. Hillis had been telling his au
dience of the fearful conditions in
ruined and despoiled Belgium,
Northern France and Serbia, under
German rule. They cheered wildly
when the noted minister vehemently
denounced the German Hohenzol
lerns and Hapsburgs, and wept when
he dramatically uttered these words:
"The Kaiser sent a message to the
Sultan of Turkey, saying, 'God bless
you, my friend.' My friends, if I
were a layman, not a clergyman, I
would say, without meaning to be
sacreligious. 'God damn the Sulto.n
and the Kaiser.' "
Dr. Hillis and Lawrence Chamber
lain, of New York, spoke at a pub
lic meeting of over ten thousand peo
ple in El Paso, inaugurating the Lib
erty Loan campaign there. They left
J afterward for Los Angeles, Cali., on
a tour of the Southwest in the in-
terest of the Liberty Loan campaign.
