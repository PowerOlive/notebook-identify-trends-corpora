BASKET BALL
The Lexington NHigh School girls
net team will open their schedule
on January 5, when they will meet
the Paris team as a curtain raiser
for the boys' game.
The "Y" quintet suffeied their
second defeat of the season at the
hands of the Lewrenceburg team in
a game played on the latter's floor
Friday night. The score was 33 to
25, but the game was more closely
contested than the result would in
dicate. The count was 15 to 14 at
the end of the first half in favor of
the enemy, and the long trip may
have had something to do with the
let-down the local boys suffered in
the second half. The five men that
started in the encounter played the
entire game, and at no time were
any of them winded, due to the ref
eree's tactics, which slowed up tne
game to an appreciable degree.
A return game with Lawrence
burg is scheduled to be played at
the local gym New Year's nighty and
the boys are determined to atone
for their defeat by plastering their
opponents with a top-heavy score on
this occasion.
The Cynthiana Athletic Club will
furnish the entertainment Thursday
night, December 28, at the Y. M. C.
A., and, as there has always been
keen rivalry between the two towns
in any athletic exhibition, this game
should be a thriller. v .
An engine cannot run without
steam, and a man will never get
anywherer without enthusiasm.
