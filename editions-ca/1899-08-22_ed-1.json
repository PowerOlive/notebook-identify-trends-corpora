Sacrificed to
Blood Poison
Those who have never had Blood Poi
son can not know what a desperate con
dition it can produce This terrible
disease which the doctors are totally
unable to cure is communicated from
one generation to another inflicting its
taint upon countless innocent ones
Some years ago I was inoculated with poison
by a nurse who infected my babe with blood
taint The little one was
unequal to the strucijie
and its life was yielded
up to the fearful poison
For six long years I suf
fered untold misery I
was covered with sores
and ulcers from head to
foot and no language
can express my feelings
of woe during those long
years I had the best
medical treatment Sev
eral physicians succes
sively treated me but all
to no purpose xne mer
cury and potash seemed to add fuel to the
awful flame which was devouring me I was
advised by friends who had seen wonderful
curesmadeby it to try Swifts Specific We
got two bottle and I felt hope again revive in
my breast hope for health and happiness
again I improved from the start and a com
plete and perfect cure was the result S S 8
is the only blood remedy which reaches des
perate cases Mrs T W Lee
Montgomery aib
Of the many blood remedies S S S
is the only one which can reach deep
seated violent cases It never fails to
cure perfectly and permanently the
most desperate cases which are beyond
the reach of other remedies
SSSSeBlood
is purely vegetable and is the only
blood remedy guaranteed to contain no
mercury potash or other mineral

He was 6 years old and engaged in

Hadley of Yale
Lacking an ingredient he appealed to
the heads of the household Mother
have we any carbonate of soda in the
house I dont know indifferently
Father have we any carbonate of soda
I dont know my son still more in
differently
The young philosopher pondered the
replies and then gave judgment I know
the reason why neither my father nor
my mother can tell whether there is
any carbonate of soda in the house
Mother does not know what carbonate
of soda is and father does not know
what is in the closet
