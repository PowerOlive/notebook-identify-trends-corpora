Perhaps his greatestachievements were accomplished inthe class in Public Speaking. He hadjust the style calculated to bringtears, to sway the multitude and tomelt the heart of stone to mutiny andpity. He was also a bright light inGreek Literature, where he acquiredthe name of Poseidon, renownedShaker of the Earth. Now that John'scareer at Centre is ended he leaves ahost of friends who will always beinterested in his welfare."P3 im' isFEEL LIKE GIVING UP ?Many Paris People On the Verge ofCollapse.A bad back makes you miserableall the timeLame every morning; sore all day.It hurts to stoop it hurts tostraighten.What with headache; dizzy spells,urinary weaknessNo wonder people are discouraged.Who do not know the kidneys maybe the cause of it all.Give the weakened kidneys needfulhelp.Use a tested and proven kidneyremedy.None endorsed like Doan's KidneyPills.Mrs. John Mastin, 1439 High St.,Paris,, says: "I have used Doan'sKidney Pills with good results and Iknow from the help they gave methat they would be just as beneficialin other cases of kidney trouble. Ihad a dead, dull ache across the smallof my back and my kidneys acted irregularly. Doan's Kidney Pills ridme of those complaints and if Ishould need a kidney remedy again,I would certainly take Doan's."Mrs. Mastin is only one of manyParis people who have gratefully endorsed Doan's Kidney Pills.

MacIngaUs, Noted Surgeon, Gives Interesting lecture onModern Methods of Treating "Spring Fever."NEW YORK, June 5. Speakingtoefore an audience composed largelyof nerve specialists and dietitians atthe Waldorf here, Dr. Robert J. MacIngels, the distinguished surgeon,laid particular stress upon the importance of keeping the blood in aWealthy condition as a means ofwarding off disease; and called attention to the fact that many people, inan endeavor to stave off or relieve socalled "spring fever," gorge themselves with sulphur, calomel, sarsaparilla and similar concoctions whichnot only thin the blood, but cause itto become "watery" and unhealthy,thus exposing themselves to the ravages of any disease which may besetthepi, and at the same time weakening and underminding their entiresystem. He said in part:"Very few people are cognizant ofthe importance of keeping the bloodIn strong and healthy condition as aprophylaxis against disease, and it isthe duty of the medical profession toinstruct the public in this prime essential of good health."I am sorry to have to confess thatthere are members of our professionwho, for the love of the almighty dollar, still keep their patients in ignorance on this most important subject; and still others, styling themselves physicians, who resort to theBlack-Age doctrine of prescribingsuch nostrums as tend to weaken theblood, thus causing it to become'watery,' and thereby superinducingvarious forms of anaemia and general debility."This practice should be vigorously prosecuted, and only such remedies should be employed as will tendto strengthen, as well as thin theblood. A certain amount of bothwhite and red corpuscles are prerequisite to good health and to properly ward off disease; thus to prescribe various forms of calomel, sarsaparilla, sulphur and similar medicants is like prescribing salt and vinegar to the victim of obesity."Acid Iron Mineral not only thinsthe blood, but strengthens and invigorates it. For those who sufferfrom the effects of thickened, heavyblood.coagulated and polluted withthe waste matter of the winter's accumulation, A-I-M stands without apeer; for it not only thins and purifiesthe blood, but carries the various impurities out of the system naturallyand effectively. As a general "springtonic" and as a prompt relief for that"tired feeling" and rundown condition so prevalent at this season, it remains the only natural, non-corrosive,fully assimilable and digestibleiron known to medical science.On the market over thirty yearsand with thousands upon thousandsof testimonials from physicians, lawyers, clergymen, pharmacists and laymen who testify to its merits, A-I-Mis the only remedy on the marketwhich is sold with the distinct understanding that its purchase pricewill be refunded if it fails to benefitin every possible degree.

In the first place it is almostunnecessary to say they are the safestinvestment that can be made, backed as they are by the strongest govrernment in the world. They will always 'remain at par, not. being subject to the market fluctuations ofother securities, even of the LibertyBond. They are free from tax. Theirearly maturity (five years) makesthem ideal investments for youngpeople who may need the moneywithin a few years for educational orother purposes at a time in life whena few hundred dollars will countmore than thousands later. Theybear a good rate of interest and areworth their face value from the daythey are bought until they are redeemed by the Government. Best ofall, they fill the card and certificateswith amazing rapidity, through thesetting aside of unmissed pennies,quarters and dollars, until with theaccumulation of stamps, comes thenational habit of saving, and thedouble service to self and nation.Lloyd George's attitude towardthe world is very much like that ofour own Teddy Roosevelt.

Dana Hubbard, the newlyappointed director of the Bureau ofPublic Health Education, who inaugurated "swat-the-fly" day in NewYork by publishing some new rulesfor getting rid of the pests. It hasbeen learned from tests that flies willnot go through slats of a blue shutter, Mr. Hubbard declared. Otheradvice to fly swatters follows:"Flies hate oil of lavender. If thisis mixed with an equal quantity ofwater and sprayed froni an atomizerabout a dining room, the room willbe free from flies."Flies hate the perfume of geraniums, mignonette, heliotrope, whiteclover, honeysuckle and hop blossoms.
