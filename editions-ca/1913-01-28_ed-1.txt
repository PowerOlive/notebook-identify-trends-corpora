There was a large courtday crod in town and the affray as witnessed by a large number of people.According to the reports a noteagainst Arnold had been placed inBailey's bands tor collection. The twomen met at the corner Main andPikestreets when it is said Bailey accostedArnold and demanded the payment ofthe note. The men engaged in aheated argument in which it is allegedArnold called Bailey a vile name,which the latter resented.Several blows were exchanged andin the scuffle the combatants fell tothe sidewalk. " Several men who witnessed the fight made an effort to separate them and when they were gottenon their feet it is said Arnold succeeded in getting his hand upon his revoiver,,which he drew from his hip pocket.The muzzle was placed against thebody ot Bailey and two shots werefired.The bullets from a 38 caliber revolver took effect in the right side a fewinches below the arm-nit severing avital organ. Bailey fell to the groundand expired in about a minute. Hisflesh was badly burned by powder.The unfortunate victim was pickedup and carried into a nearby store,where a hasty examination revealedthe fact that death resulted almost instantly. After the shooting Arnoldmade no effort to escape, and wastaken into custody by Chief of PoliceD. J. Hughes and Deputy Sheriff JohnStewart. Both of the officers werewithin half a block of the scene of thekilling when it occurred.When locked up Arnold declined todiscuss the affair. It is said that hehad been drinking heavily during theday and was greatly under the influence of liquor when he fired the shotthat took the life of Bailey.Reports from Cynthiana last nightand information gained from a numberot people who were parsing throughParis yesterday afternoon were to theeffect that feeling against the slayerof Bailey is running very high andowing to.the prominence of the deadman it is feared an attempt may "bemade to lynch the prisoner.The remains of Bailey were viewedby Dr. Charles Swinford, Coroner ofHarrison county, and an inquest washeld the jury returning a verdict ofdeath due to a gunshot wound fired byNewton Arnold. The body was takento an undertaking establishment whereit was prepared for burial.Mr. Bailey was one of the mostprominent men of Harrison county.He was aged about 4z years and tor anumber of years had been practicingat the Harrison bar. Last fall hemade the race for Congress on the Republican ticket in the Ninth Congressional .district but was defeated byCongressman Fields. He was one ofthe most prominent members of theMasonic or.ier in Kentucky and wasPast Grand Master and Past GrandHigh Priest of the Kentucky GrandLodge.Mr. Bailey was born at Colville,near the Bourbon-Harrison line Hewas unmarried and is survived by hisaged mother and three brothers.Arnold, who is in jail, charged withthe crime, tenanted the farm of Mrs.Nellie Highland on the Georgetownpike, near this city. Before movingot Bourbon, he lived at Lair Station,a tew miles JSouth iof Cvnthiana.

Questions asked bywitnesses before the Ways and MeansCommittee indicated that meats andsugar may go on the free list. An income taxTtomake up for gthe' loss ofrevenue from the tariff on meats andsugar will soon come into existence asa resulifof the ratification of the income tax amendments the constitution by the necessary three g fourths ofthe states.This program should spell some rduction in the cost of living. Thewholesale price of sugar in London,where there is no tax on sugar, averages two cents a pound less than inNew York. The same thing is true ofbeef. The cables frequently reportthat American beef, on which thetransportation has been paid across theAtlantic, is being sold on the block inLondon two cents a pound less than inthe "United States; This shows howthese tiusts have been taking advantage of home consumers who they haveat thei mercy because of the PayneAldrich tariff law.Naturally the sugar trust and beeftrustwill not approve a policy of freesugar and free meat, but the sugartrust and the beef trust will not be inthe saddle in Washington after March4.The New York Journal which ha3from "time to time carried in its columns valuable and iustiuctive editorials regarding the country editor in arecent issue published the following:We repeat that advertising in country newpsapers, prcperly utilized, isthe most valuable advertising in theworld for its cost. We urge advertisers to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the country newspapers. We add, incidentally, that wedon't own and never expect, to ownany country newspaper or to have aninterest in a country newspaper.A country editor with five hundredcirculation or more for his daily orweekly can talk to five hundred goodtypical American families.all purchasers, all desirable customers.Every publisher of a country newspaper should be, through his advertising columns, the trusted and valuedagent and promoter of at least tengreat industrial merchandising concerns. The country publisher is alone ablethrough his columns to sell everything. His readers buy everythingthat is for sale from .nails to pianos,from pills to automobies. They buypaint'and roofing and stoves and lampshundreds of commodities that thecity dweller never buys.There is not a community in theUnited States in every one of whichten or even fifty great American merchants and manufacturers would notgladly hire at high pav a competent.earnest representative able to talk every day to five hundred or more families. .And every business like, hardworking country publisher is such an agent,able every day tor each the consumersthat nobody else can reach.The country newspaper is the bestof all advertising mediums.And the publisher's profits should benot less than six dollars annually forevery copy of the paper sold.Little by little the advertisers willcome to learn the value of the countrynewspaper and very rapidlyjet us hopethe country editors will come to learnthe value of which they have for saleand will demand andgetj;hefr share ofthe national prosperity, acting as national industrial and commercial representatives, and not merely as the local mouthpieces of local merchantsbarely able to euDport themselves.The publishers that really protectthe people the hard working ownersand editors of the fifeen thousand ormore country dailies and weekliesmust unite to protect themselves andget their share of national prosperity.They must free themselves from th9idea that the country editor is the pri-vate'property of the local druggist"groceryman, butcher and hardwaredealer.They must give good and faithfulservice to their local business men,and at the same time good and faithfulservice to the great mass of so calledforeign advertisers. Thus their prosperity will be'doubled and quadrupledand their capacity for usefulness accordingly. The country editor with a thousandcirculation can make himself worth tothe community at least six thousanddollars a year. He can make his paper earn that if he chooses to do it."He must be his own master, not ruled by local merchants oi politics recogniizng only his readers as clients,customers, advisers and equals.Mre You Blue and Worried ?Nervous ?

Lloyd has let it beknown among his friends Lthat he willnot stand for re-election to the chairmanship of the National DemocraticCongressional Committee. Mr. Lloydhas served as chairman of this important committee six years, throughthree' Conerressionalelections, which islonger than any Democrat was everhonored with the place.When Mr. Lloyd, who comes fromthe first Missouri district and has longbeen one of the Democratic leaders ofthe house, first took hold of the chairmanship of the Congressional Committee the Republicans were in power inbothjbranches of Congress and seemedlikely to be for several years to come.Mr. Lloyd inaugurated a plan of closeco-operation with Democratic candidates'for Congress thai was more syBte maticr and effective than any policythat has ever been worked out before.Then he built up one of the largestDemocratic news .syndicates in thecountry.Mr. Lloyd felt the people were notgetting the Washington news from theDemocratic viewpoint, and he determined to supply it to them through thecountry press, not only during campaigns.b ut all the time. Ever sinceMr. Lloyd has been chairman of thecommittee the country Democraticnewspapers have been furnished witha wekely Washington letter of Democratic news. The publication of theseletters has been of the greatest helpto the Congressional candidates. Mr.Lloyd also originated a statistical bureau to gatherdata for the newspaperletters as well as the Congressionalcandidates. Mr. Lloyd has devotedmuch hard work to the cause and feelsthat thetime has come now that theDemocrats are in the ascendancy forsome good man to step in and take hisplace.fwiOioOiieiii sioieCorner Seventh and Main Sts.CLEARANCE SALENow Going On -Great Bargains in All DepartmentsDressgoods, Drygoods, Silks,Ladies' and Misses' Suits, Skirts, Cloaks,Shirt Waists and Millinery.Call In and See Us.TWIN BROS.'

It is only abouthalf what it was eariler in the seasonwhen I first saw it and I think it will,be becoming to me.""How would you like the benefit of !my advice," I asked, laughingly. "I'vea notion to go with you and give youan expert opinion.""That's very good of you," saidLouise. So, an hour latei, Louise stood be-fore me with a childishly pleased andexpectant look on her face. Althoughshe is two years older than I, Louiseoften seems ridiculously young and.inexperienced."Well, what do you think of it?"she asked, glancing into a long mirrorcomplacently."It's quite pretty," I replied, "butJJ;aren't you afraid that chiffon tunic willbe quite out of style next fall? Thatsort of thing has been worn so muchthis winter that probably it will' bedropped altogther.""Yfcu known I don't try to keep upwith the fashions," said Louise. "IfI can get something that is pretty andbecoming I don't care whether it'sthe latest thing or not.""Well, of course, if you don't mindbeing a back number," I began."This is the latest design," interposed the saleswoman, "and it willbe good style for as long as any onewould wish to wear it.""But my friend wears her thingslonger than most persons," I explained,"and I don't like to see her get something that isn't especially becoming.""Why, don't you think I look wellin this gown?" Louise asked, rathersharply. She appeared to be vexedbecause I did not rave over the gown."Well, you know, dear, an overdresseffect like that is apt to make a person look rather stout," I explained."I think one should be particularlycareful not to wear anything that addsto the size. Still, if you like it andif you don't mind looking rather large,get it by all means.""I certainly don't want it if I'm going to look like a mountain in it."Louise began to take off the frockvery crossly. "I suppose you haven'tanything else that would suit me? 'she turned to the . saleswoman."Nothing at this price that is nearlyso beautiful. You see, this is one ofour imported models. I don't understand how it happened to be markedso low. I can show you somethingless dressy.""No, thank you, I want a reallyhandsome costume," said Louise, looking regretfully at the soft folds of silkand chiffon. Then as we left the storeshe asked me: "What are you goingto wear at our Dix Amies receptionSaturday night?""Oh, I don't know yet," I replied. "Iusually wait till the last moment to decide." "I had thought of wearing that gown.I do wish it had been all right for me.""It's too bad that you are disappointed," I said, sympathetically."But surely there's no occasion for anyspecial dressing at our Dix Amies reception. You will look nice in any ofyour pretty little frocks."Saturday evening I was taking offmy wraps at the reception whenLouise came toward me in a nun-likegown of gray."You see," she said, "I took yourhint to dress plainly and "Then, looking at me in astonishment, she exlaimed, "Why, Lucile,what have you got on? You don'tmean to say that you bought thatlonely frock you wouldn't let me get!"'I laughed gently. "You were a freeagent, Louise," I replied, "and as youdecided against the frock it occurredto me that perhaps I could use it.1so I went back to the store yesterdayand found that it fitted me perfectly.Then I thought I might as well wearit tonight.""Weren't you afraid of looking stoutin it?" she asked in a really unpleasant tone."Oh, no, I have no reason to worryabout stoutness," I returned merrily,for I always try to overlook Louise'slittle exhibitions of temper. The poorgirl has such an unfortunate disposition. Carl Bates and Arthur Knight bothcomplimented me upon my appearance. It is always worth one's whileto dress well.Lacking.An old Englishwoman, who was extremely stout, was making vain efforts to enter the rear door of anomnibus.

Bowen. ex-Confederatesolidier, former Sheriff of Bourboncounty, and for years one of the foremost figures in the farming and distilling industries of the county, diedat the home of his daughter, Mrs.Calla Keller, on Fourth Street, Thursday morning, following a protractedillness of a complication of diseases.Mr. Bowen had been in feeble healthfor several months and for the pasttwo weeks his condition had been regarded as critical. His family andfriends entertained little hope for hisrecovery and since Saturday his demise has been momentarily expected.Everything known to medical scienceWas employed to relieve his suffering,which, coupled with his remarkableconstitution, prolonged his life.Mr. Bowen, who was in his eighty-fifthyear, was the eldest son of Benjaminand Mary Current Bowen. His parents were natives of Bourbon countyand he was born near Ruddles Mills, inBourbon county, on October 18, 1828.He was educated in the district schoolsat Ruduies Mills, and remained withhis father until he had grown to manhood. On March 28, 1852 he was, united inmarriage to Miss Lucy B. Wyatt,daughter of Fleming and MarthaWyatt, residing near Ruddles Mills,and a sister of Mr George Wyatt,of near Paris. His wife preceded himto the grave a number of years.In the same year Mr. Bowen engagedin the mercantile business in RuddlesMills which he continued most; successfully for 4 years when he fitted up andoperated the Abe Spears cotton andwoolen factory about one mile fromKiser station on Stoner creek. In connection with this he operated a flouringmill and being .very succesful in business amassed a' considerable fortune.Thd woolenmill was later convertedinto a distillery which he operated fora numbeiof years, making the famousBowen copper whiskey which had awide reputation the country over.At the outbreak of the Civil war,Mr. Bowen espoused the cause of theSouth, and answering the call for volunteers, enlisted in the Confederatearmy in the spring of 1862. On entering the army he was given a commission of first Lieutenant in Company Cof the Fifth Kentucky Cavalry, servingin the regiment of Col. Howard Smith,and in the Brigade of Gen. Abe Buford, until transferred to the commandof Gen. John H. Morgan.He won the reputation as a fearlessofficer by his gallantry in many engagements and was later promoted to theposition of Captain. He participatedin all of the principal engagements inwhich the command of Gen. Morganfought, and in July, 1863, was taken aprisoner by the Union troops at thememorable battle at Buffington's Island, Ohio, when the gallant band ofcavalrymen under the intrepid leaderinvaded the North.With his brother officers, Mr. Bowenwas sent to Johnson's Island, where hewas confined in prison for about fourweeks, when he was transferred to Allegheny City, Pa., and imprisoned with115 others in the State Penitentiary,remaining in confinement for abouteight months. The ranking officers,from Lieutenant up, were ordered toCamp Chase, Ohio, where Mr. Bowenwas confined for six months, when hewas released through the influence offriends.Returning home at the close of thewar, Mr. Bowen again resumed business activities, and by thrift and energy acquired valuable land estates, atone time having in his possession 670acres of fine bluegrassJJ land locatednear Shawhan. Much of his time wasdevoted to the raising of thoroughbredhorses and he owned fully 80 head ofhigh class runners. He made a number of sales, among the most notablebeing that of Runnymede, 2-year-old,bred on his farm, which in 1881 soldfor $10,000; Wallenstine, $9,000; Quinto and JElias Lawrence, the two for$5,000.In 1875, Mr. Bowen engaged in thehardware business in Paris, under thefirm name of Ford& Bowen, and a fewyears following met with reverseswhich swept away the majority of hisestate.Mr. Bowen occupied the handsomeresidence on the Cynthiana pike aboutone mile South of Shawhan, which wasdesigned by himself and built according to his plans. The place was laterpurchased by the father of Messrs.John and Robert Larue who havesince occupied it, together with a largeacreage of the land which was ownedby Mr. Bowen.For a number of years Mr. Bowencontinued in the capacity of managerof the distillery at Kiserton which heformerly owned and which had beenacquired by Cincinnati capitalists.In 1897 he moved to Paris and afterbeine here a short time was elected tothe office of sheriff of Bourbon county,holding the position for four yearswhen he was succeeded by Mr. W. W.Mitchell.During his late years he lias lived inretirement, residing with his daughter,Mrs. Keller, who with the other members of the family contributed to hisevery need during his declining years.He is survived by three daughters,Mrs. Calla Keller and Mrs. A. H.Keller, of Paris and Mrs. Arthur Newsum, of Dallas. Texas, who arrived atthe bedside of her father Sunday nightonly a few liours before his sufferingswere relieved by death. Three sisters,Mrs. Harriett Duval, of near this city,Mrs. James Tate.of Shawhan, and Mrs.Mary C. Bell, of Lexington, also survive.

M. Hall, with the newly-electedSecretary. Mr. John Wiggins, present, and the following newmembers of the board were elected :W. W. Haley, John T. Collins, V. W.Ferguson, Peale Collier, W. D.

Secretary Wiggins, who has taken the reins of office,stateB that every effort will be madeto secure the highest class attractionsfor the fair, and that thev will becontracted for at the earliest possibledate. The premium list for the coming fairjwillibegpractically the same asthat of former years, with perhaps anumber of additions.The Sociey claimed the dates for thefirst week in September, and the failwill be held from the first to sixth inclusive. Recently it was reportedthat the Society would make an effortto have the dates changed to earlier inthe summer, as the late seasons ot recent years have had the effect of reducing the attendance, but from thefact that the fair which for morethan half a century has been in existence has in previous.'years been heldthe first week in September it wasdeemed advisable to continue the exhibition without-making this change.sion will be held in Lexington Januaryxi At the meetmcr Mr. Ward willsubmit for adoption the plan underwhich the county game wardens of In-,diana work, and which he thinks willbe ot great benefit to thi3 state. ,Best Made.The celebrated Marion .'Kitchen Cabinet S27.50, most complete cabinetmade.tf A.

Judge.Local FansMust Display SomeInterest.Unless there is some disposition onthe part of the base ball fans of thiscity within the next few weeks looking to the revival of interest in thegame there will be no base ball clubin Paris during the coming season.This is pretty straight dope and itis our adviceJJ Jo the admirers ot thegame to get busy at the earliest possible date and start a campaign forfunds with which to sustain the" teamduring practice season and.until it canbe m2de self-sustainrng by the leceiptat the gate.As everyone knows, or should know,the club is at present heavily in debt.Last year was very, disastrous froma financial standpoint, but it is wellknown fact that baseball failed . toprove profitable in many cities. Pariswas not an exception and lost moneywith a score of others.No doubt thisseason will show a decidided improvement in the conditionsand with a proper start our teamshould proveja paying proposition fromthe opening game, vIt is ihe general opinion among thefans that Jhere will be a club ar.dsome are very enthusiastic but themajority are content to trust to providence and express the hope that Pariswill be represented in the" Blue Grassthis year.This is not the proper gspirit to display at such a critical time. Whatthe team needs is good substantialsupporters, more so now than everbefore and from the fact that thereis a certan wave of opposition nowon foot, the efforts should be strongerthan ever.According m to President Bacon hehas communicated with a number ofplayers who are anxious for a berthon the local team. About Feb. 1 contracts will be mailed out to all of-themen. Now itfis up to the fans totake a hand in the affair and make agreater success of the team ;this yearthan ever. It would be a wise movetu'get the ball to rolling as soon aspossible that there may be no drawbacks at the beginning and when theseason isfairly launched it is safe topredict the team will take care ofitself.The'annual meeting of the stockholders of the Muysville baseball clubresulted in the election of James F.Summers as president and secretaryand John Leonard treasurer.

THOMPSONSheriff of Bourbon County,22Zi j23ZS3KRTHEATRICALMarjor'e Cortland, who plays thepart ot the child-wife in the MargaretMayo Comedy, "Baby Mine," whichcomes to tha opera house January 29tb,takes as much care to select handsomegowns as certain stars do to surroundthemselves with nobodies unlikely toeclipse them."It's a safe venture that there isnot a woman who goes to see 'BabyMine' that isn't literally filled withenvy of these dainty things. Ofcourse some allowance must be madefor Miss Cortland. She's such a smallmorsel of humanity that a paDer sacktied in with a blue ribbon wouldtransform itself into a suggestion ofdaintiness and call forth xhe sameejaculations of Ohs' and 'Ahs.Still, these gowns that 1 speak of.although they have a pleasing simplicity in common with a Dapersack, are very far from being in" thesame class. More than one among thefashionable dressmakers, it is safe toventure, have taken points from thepretty neglige with its lace flounces,or from the beguiling little second actfrock, a dream in the palest and softestt:f blues, with lace flouncing at thefoot and three deep tucks above.In the first act, the gown is whitecloth with patch pockets, purely ornamental, a section of deep plaits beinginserted at the sides of the skirt belowthe hips and fitted in with a largeyoke. A like ornament continuesdown the full length of the front.Three bettpr suggestions for girls'frocks cuuld not be fourd in Tsearch ofthe best establishments. There arefew models for girla' dresses whichare at the same time smart and appropriate, and Miss Cottland, althoughas Zoie she is a married woman, isnevertheless very much'a girl.STOCK, CROP AND FARM NOTESlhat Blue Grass land brings a goodprice was evidenced when JeffersonDavis Grover Daid about $250 per acrefor the farm of Mrs Mai KankinsRoberts located in Scott county on theLexington and Georgetown pike.
