of such treatment is illustrated in the

Mothers advice is worth more than
the advice of any other woman to the
daughter who is perplexed by the prob
lems of phyiscal health and comfort
Theres no need therefore to 4 write to a
woman who is a stranger
There may however be need for a
physicians advice to supplement the ad
vice of the mother In such a case the
offer of free consultation by letter made
by Dr Pierce opens the way to health
and at the same time avoids the un
pleasant questionings the repulsive ex
aminations and offensive local treatments
which less experienced physicians often
insist on
Any sick or ailing woman is invited to
write to Dr Pierce Buffalo in the strict
est privacy Each letter is held as a
sacred confidence and its answer is sent
in a plain envelope bearing no printing
upon it
Do not be misled by advertisements
offering 44 medical advice which are
published by those who not being phy
sicians are not qualified to give such ad
vice Any physician or doctor who has
a legal and professional right to the title
will publicly claim that title Those
who offer 44 medical advice and invite
you to 4 write to a woman do not claim
that the woman is a doctor The medi
cal advice of an unprofessional woman
is just as dangerous as the 4 medical
advice of an unprofessional man In
more than thirty years Dr Pierce and his
staff of nearly a score of medical special
ists have successfully treated over half a
million women You can write without
fear as without fee to Dr R V Pierce
