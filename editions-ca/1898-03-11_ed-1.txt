What seemsto be an accurate forecast of the reportof the court of inquiry was receivedhere Tuesda night It was broughtdirect from Havana The court willfind according to this authority thatthe Maine was destroyed by the employment of external agencyThe findings will be arranged undertwo heads In detail the court will setforth the conditions which go to disprove that the destruction was causedby an internal explosion The factswhich are contrary to any possibletheory of accident will be presentedThis array will dispose most thoroughly of internal accident as the causeThe second part of the

theloss of the battleship Maine which isat present in session here pursued insome respects a different course fromthat adopted upon the occasion of theformer visit of the court to Havana Itis now not uncommon to see members ofthe court on the wreck personallydirecting the navy divers and obtaining from them direct reports on thestructural condition of the submergedportions of the wreck and making individual notes for future considerationAll sorts of excuses are made to geton board the wreck but only authorized persons Americans or Spanishare allowed to set foot on the remainsof the

following addressThe National Association of Democraticclubs will celebrate the 155th birthday anniversary of Thomas Jefferson at Washington D CWednesday April 13 by a subscription dinnerunder the au pices of the executive committeeof the association The reverential observanceof Jeffersons day has become a significant usageof the democratic clubs and of the democraticparty It furnishes a fitting occasion for reneweddeclarations of devotion to the fundamentalprinciples of human liberty for whichthe party was originally formed touphold and defend for the revision ofour party doctrines as applied to the conflictsof the hour and for a timely review of the centralizing corrupting and oppressive measuresof our federalist opponents who under onename or another have from the foundation ofthe republic sought to revolutionize the constitution by false construction and false administrationIt is believed that never since the issuesbeen these contending forces class privilegeand wealth on one side and the people on theother were first clearly joined in 1796 or in1800 when the first great triumph of the peoplewas achieved has there been an hour whenthe bold reassertion of the sound traditionalprinciples of the democratic party was moreimperatively required than at this timeWe therefore earnestly advise the democratic associations of the United Stateswhether large or small to join with the National association of democratic clubs on the13th of April next at such hour and in suchmanner as may best serve the wishes of eachseparate orgmization in a common homageto the memory of the great apostleof American liberty the author of thedeclaration of independence and the founderof the democratic party and in afresh expression of our unalterable determination to preserve the heritage of freedom as itcame to us from our forefathers and to resistby every lawful means in our power the encroachments of organized wealth and monopoly on the constitutional rights of the peopleWe need not particularize here in what practical forms these encroachments appearto day They are seen and known ofall men If they are not met and defeated before the dawn of the 20thcenturywe must be content to see the republicof Washington and Jefferson replaced by anoligarchy of wealth trusts and sordid conspiracies in many disguises taxing for privatepurposes safe guarding monopolies

roadsFlorence insisted on riding her horsethe rest of the way to her homeA thought occurred to me after I hadassisted her to remount I laid my handon the bridle to restrain her going -Do you mind if I ask you a question I inquiredAssuredly notThen tell me do you see much ofHorace Jackson Has he asked you tomarry himYes he has asked me to marry himshe replied drooping her head Indeed there is a compact between usabout itOhYes Now please do not be foolishand feel badly over it But I have promised Mr Jackson that I will marry himif the robbery can be traced to you andthe stolen property or a portion of ithe found in your possession-Good heavens Why did you givehim that promiseWell he bothered me so lately thatI gave him the promise to get rid ofhim His part of the compact is not tomentionthe subject again until you areshown to be the robber So you see howabsolutely safe I am in thisDoes Jackson believe I am guiltyI askedNo he does not In his inmost hearthe does not And he used to affirm hisbelief in your innocence until She-hesitated here and seemed reluctant toproceed I waited in anxiety ana shefinally went on until lately he forsome reason has changed his opinionAt least so he says And it made meangry when he told me that he hadThen it was I gave him the promiseHow long is it since you discoveredthat he had changedAbout six weeks ago I have notseen him since He and his father hada terrible quarrel that day and he hasnot been here since thenWhat reason did he give for now believing I was the eruilty party IaskedOh he mumbled something aboutdiscoveries recently made which wouldthrow new light on the caseFlorence gazed earnestly into myface and she must have noticed thetroubled expression upon it For shei leaned toward me and with great earnestness exclaimed Nelson oh tellme you had nothing to do with it didyouFlorenceForgive me I know jou are honest and true She laid her hand uponmine I will not wrong you by theleast doubt But Jackson seemed soconfident There is no way by whicha- seeming proof of the robbery couldbe shown against you is thereGood heavens how could there beI exclaimed Oh I see it all I wenton bitterly Jackson has becomewealthy and is trying to ingratiatehimself with your father and undermine my reputation with you and sofinally gain your handFlorence listened to my incoherentoutburst with an amused smileDo you like Jackson at all Is heagreeable to you I asked in jealousyThe smile died from her face and hereyes flashed with an angry fireLike him No indeed I detest theman I hate him This outburst mademe happy and I laughed merrilyIt is not kind of you to compel me toshow temper she said But remember sir you provoked me to it It is notonly for myself alone that I dislike himbut it seems to me that he is the causeof the change that has come over myfather lately Ever since that quarrelfather has been so different1n what respect I asked sympatheticallyHe seems terribly worried andanxiousIt is probably business care Thereare very few men directing great enterprises who have not times of worryand anxiety who have not financialstorms and the fear of wreck to faceI added consolingly And as for thequarrel with Jackson that was probably no more than a difference of opinion regarding business methods Jackson told me once he had business relations with your father and that is whatmakes me almost fearful that he willgain you after allBut I have promised you what snore-an vou ask I would not marry MrJackson even if I had never met youFlorence said with a decided shake ofher headUnless it was proved I rohbed thebank I sug gestedIasNo not even then Id rather dieOh my darling- love I burst outI must be first in your heart or nothing1 first or nothing-What a foolish fellow you areYou make me feel quite hurt at yourimplied doubt of meShe urged her horse forward a fewsteps then turned her face toward meRest easy about that with the truelight in her eyes You are first dearone first now first alwaysI made a spring- for the bridle butwith a merry laugh she gave her horsethe whip and eluded meI watched the dear form rising- andfalling like a bird along the road thenclimbed into the buggy and slowlydrove homeCHAPTER IXAfter supper I lit a cigar and walkedup and down in front of the houseDuring the meal Mrs Snyder had keptup an incessant chatter concerning themysteries about my house I did nothear half her words but neverthelessthere was an element so foreign to mythoughts in the few sentences I caughtthat I was glad to escape herThe evening shadows were settlingover the valley and the moon was rising in splendorLeisurely I tramped to and fro giving up my thoughts undisturbed to thepleasant realization of new found happiness and t anticipations of futurejoy in the constant companionship ofmy sweetheartThe cigar finished I repaired to myroom with the intention ofreadingBut the evening was so fine that I soonblew out the light and sat down by thewindowThen I remembered how On risingfrom the same chair the evening before a tall white specter had confronted me This recollection coming tome suddenly in the midst of happythoughts caused me to glance somewhat nervously toward the closed window oppositeI could see a faint image of myselfswaying to and fro in unison with themotion of the rocking chair in whichI was seatedDirectly underneath was the cellarwhose solid walls defying investigationof the interior had so impressed the oldnurse Sarah with an unreasonable fearEven Sonntag who from his vocationwas accustomed to hold himself well inhand against surprise had exhibitedprofound amazement when informedof the circumstanceIt was irritating to have thoughtsconcerning the mysteries which seemedto abound in the old homestead comecrowding up and play at cross purposeswith the happy state that the meetingwith Florence had inducedThe mysteries had seemed trivial inthe daytime had been wholly forgottenin Florences society but now that Iwas again alone and the night comingon the thought of the cellar came backto me tinged with a shadow of fearAnd the voice the unearthly voicewhat was itAtfirstlhad felt a hope that the vagueaccount given by Mrs Snyder mighthave something of truth in it The unraveling of a chain of events whichseemed to border on the supernaturalwould be a new experience to me andtherefore furnish a diversion in thequiet uneventful life I expected to leadin NelsonvilleBut now I needed no such diversionto lead my thoughts away from the robbery and its blighting effect upon mylife and honor I did not regard thataffair any longer as the one great barrier which stood between me and happiness although the desire for exculpation was keener than everI was sure of Florences love andtrust but I could not wish her sweetself linked forever to one over whoselife a cloud of suspicion hung Her lovewas an inspiration an incentive underits influence I hoped to accomplish results which even the vast resources ofthe bank had failed inTo devote all my thought all theenergy I possessed to this one end wasnow my purpose That small mysterious events were arising with their attendant irritations threatening to divide the resources of my mind andbody which I desired concentrated toone end filled me with impatienceThen too the certainty that HoraceJackson seemed to feel that Florencewould be compelled to fulfill her promise weighed heavily upon me Whyhad Jackson changed his opinion regarding my innocence What developments had arisen which would thrownew light on the case and make an innocent man bear the consequences of acrime he knew nothing ofJust before retiring it occurred to methat the lights of Mr Morleys housemight be seen from the attic windowIt seemed as though sleep would besweeter after a glimpse of those lightssome of which were casting radianceover Florences loved formI left my room and quietly ascendedthe stairs Arrived at the attic Igrouped my way to the small windowthrough which I had gazed that morning I stood for a few minutes contemplating the lights of theMorley residence on the hill oppositeA brisk breeze was piping down thevalley Through cracks and crevicesit crept into the old attic with soft wailing and moaning There was homesickness in the mournful tones and a sadness as though the spirits of the departed were sighing for a return to oldfamiliar scenesWhat was there about my old placethat produced such a depressing effectupon my spiritsThe happiest moments of life have aslight shadow to them as though towarn us that all joy is fleeting Perhaps it was only this shadow whichcaused the undefinable feeling of insecurity But there was a quality alsowhich breathed of events to come ofdire import I seemed like the marineron a dark sea conscious of breakersahead and knowing noij which way tosteer Even my dreams in the restlessslumber of the past night seemed premonitionsTHE BOURBON NEWS ERIUAYi MAECH 11 1898That vague forebodings should comewhen my mind was filled with thoughtsof the beloved one who had given meher heart was most strange I couldnot shake off the depression The darkness of the attic deepened itI was about to retrace my steps tothe stairway when sounds reached myear which caused me to pause and listena series of raps alternating with arasping noise but so feeble and indistinct that I was unable to form an opinion of the cause All I could determinewas that they seemed to come fromaboveA loose shingle or piece of timberrattling in the wind would have madea dull heavy sound while the gentleraps I heard had a clear mellow ringlike that produced by the vibrations ofa tuning forkAfter lighting all the matches I hadwith me and making as thorough anexamination of the roof as the briefflickering lights would allow I gropedtoward the stairsProbably half the distance to thelanding was passed when upon my earfell the voice the unearthly voice theweird tones of which I had first heardin my room downstairsIt could not possibly be heard up inthe attic when speaking in my chamber So then it must have the facultyof being able to change from one apartment to another just as the whim seizeditLike the voice which had soundeddownstairs the tones were intermittent in the present instance they alternated with the rappingsAfter standing motionless with hearing strained to the utmost I noticedthat at no time did the voice and therappings sound togetherThe few detached words I distinguished had no possible reference tomyself nevertheless the voice seemedto follow me I was unwilling to attribute the sounds to supernaturalcauses for I was not a believer in thesupernatural It might be that the parties who had walled up the cellar foundsome of their plans whatever theymay have been upset by my adventand had taken this way to frighten meand cause nry departureOn second thought the idea did notappear tenable For if the purpose wasto frighten me a fiercer and more terrifying demonstration would be usedWas there only one voice which insome way sounded both in my room andin the attic or were there various voicesall over the place each independent ofthe otherI hastened downstairs but when Ireached my room no sounds were heardthereWhile in my bedroom I had no wayof knowing if the voice in the attic wasstill soundingThe remainder of the evening I spentin rushing from my room to the atticand back again ar 1 quietly stealingthrough the vacant rooms in the hopeof laying hold of some explanation ofthe strange voice I did hear it againin the attic but there was no sound inmy room though I had immediatelyhastened theretFinally I gave up the quest for thetime and thoroughly fatigued undressed and went to bedMy head had hardly touched the pillow when the report of a pistol reachedmy ear The sound was muffled asthough coming from a distant apartment Indeed it seemed to come fromunderneath as had the sound of theslamming door but yet not directly beneath it would undoubtedly havesounded much plainer had the shooting taken place in the walled up cellarbelow my roomThere was no answering shot and nomore unaccountable noises though Ihearkened intentlyAll through the night I lay vainlytrying to find repose but sleep wouldnot come I was resolved to leave nostone unturned to unravel these mysteries For the events trivial as theyseemed and as they probably wouldprove when explained were certainlyirritating and threatened wholly to destroy the rest and peace I had expectedto find in NelsonvilleIt was exasperating that besides being burdened with a load of guilt whichrightf ullj belonged on other shouldersI should also be subjected to petty annoyances which promised to make mystay in Nelsonville anything but peaceful True I was my own master Icould leave the old house on the morrow But to be utterly routed anddriven from the field by a few harmlessthough inexplicable happenings wascontrary to my nature Then tooFlorence how could I leave the placenow that I had found my love abidinghereWhen the first rosy tints of dawnshowed in the east slumber closed myweary eyesAs on the previous morning MrsSnyder was compelled to arouse me iuvbreakfast On the present occasion sheannounced rather testily tha t the morning meal had been waiting for over anhourI could not resist the desire to begininvestigations immediately and therefore after hastily dressing I walked allaround the house keeping at such distance from it that every part of theroof could be seenThere was a line of wire runningalong the side of the road which as Iafterward ascertained belonged to atelephone circuit embracing half adozen towns and villages in the vicinity This wire crossed the roof of thehouse but was not fastened to it in anyway swinging at least three feet clearof the ridge pole Within a few inchesof the wire was a section of lightningrod The air was still and the wirehung motionless On the previousnight a strong breeze had been blowing as I remembered from the mournful cadences it produced up in the atticHere was one mystery which could bevery reasonably explained The windhad swung the wire causing it to strikeagainst the perpendicular portion ofthe lightning rod thereby causing theseries of gentle vibratory raps I hadheardSatisfied tLt toe other mysteriousevents would also give up their secretsupon investigation I went to breakfast Mrs Snyder was not nearly sotalkative as during former meals Indeed she appeared rather glum Thereason of the old widows taciturn manner was soon explainedAfter pouring my coffee she watchedme in silence for some itme But silence was not the widows forte and asI was busy with my own speculationsshe was compelled to beginI guess you tont like my cookinYhe saidIndeed I do the proof lies in thequantity i find room for You are anexcellent cookThe old womans face relaxed somewhat under my praiseVeil bud you tont come rite avaywhen id is retty she continued undI tought maybe you not like de

I knew questions relating to thestrange things which had come underher observation were trembling on herlipsYou remember our discovery of thewalled up cellar I continued MrSonntags suggestion regarding thewisdom of secrecy coming to mindShe nodded and her old eyes brightened expectantlyIt is advisable to keep the matter asecret I continued You have notmentioned it to anyone have jrouAch noThen please do not for the presentShe promised compliance with my requestAs the cellar was the next mystery Idetermined to turn my attention to Iwent home immediately after finishingmy breakfast

for space to have his pigeonholes ranged about him in a semicircular formHe was all hedged in by the desksand so had neither the opportunity northe inclination to move about muchThe man weighed when

speak about their eyes beingtired meaning that the retina or seeingportion of the eye is fatigued but suchis not the case as the retina hardlyever gets tired Thie fatigue is in theinner and outer muscle attached to theeyeball and the muscle of accommodation which surrounds the lens of theeye When a near object is to be lookedat this muscle relaxes and allows thelens to thicken increasing its refractive power The inner and outermuscles are used in covering the eveon the object to be looked at the innerone being especially used when a nearobject is looked at It is in the threemuscles

DispatchMYSTERIES OF CIENEGADeserted Arizona Station the Scene ofBloody Robbers OperationsThose who can remember back to1S72 and thereabouts in this part of theterritory recall that Cienega stationhad a remarkably tragic history Itwas once the abode of a small thoughdesperate band of cutthroats mainlythe employes of the stage companywho posed as honest hosts while operating a private graveyard for unfortunatetravelers not unlike nor inferior to thatwhich has clothed the name of Benderwith its world wide terror and abhorrence It was the most important station between Tucson and Silver Cityon the old Butterfield stage route thatran between San Diego and El PasoThe tragic mysteries of Cienega station were never entirely cleared up formurders and robberies and hold upsfollowed so swiftly on the heels of eachother that the real miscreants werenever dealt with by the authoritiesThat their crimes were avenged however as crimes always are is shown inthe Indian massacre which occurrffithere in the fall of 3873 One darknight the Apaches gathered in silenceon the surrounding hills and at daybreak with a whoop and yell theyrushed in on the little band at the station and massacred all If any escapedno one knows who it was or where hewent and the presumption is that allwere killed On a little knoll back ofthe station are the mounds of 38 unknown graves marked by a singleshaft that tells the work of the avengers Most of the crimes perpetrated bythe white men at Cienega were laidto the door of the Apaches and it wasafterward found that moccasins werekept the robbers as part of theirhighway paraphernaliaThe most widely known crime of theCienega fiends was the capture of 75000 en route from El Paso to San Diegoin charge of a small government guardThese were funds of the United Statespaymaster and the three men who attempted to convey them in abuckboardpast Cienega station wrere murdered onthe spot It was known that this crimewas perpetrated by Americans disguised as Apaches At this time it wasimpossible for these Cienega Bendersto get out of the country with theirtreasure so most of it was buried insecret Then came the Apache avengers Often since then idle

secured a civic and socialstatus of the utmost respectability intheir native city Hitherto their rightsand privileges though unreservedlyrecognized and acquiesced in by townsmen and tourists alike were not firmlyestablished upon any indisputable legalbasis and had nothing more solid tostand upon than the unwritten statutesof ancient usages The drawbacks ofa questionable tenure such as thatwhich these interesting birds have exercised in therpurlieus of St Marks cathedral from time immemorial in virtue of tradition and sentiment havenow been finally swept away at the costof a few innocent lives the sacrifice ofwhich recently gave rise to judicial investigations of a curiously elaborateand protracted character Figuratively speaking the pigeons of Venice havebeen to law in sheer self defense havecarried their case with the aid of theirbest friends the Venetian municipalcouncilors through the Italian courtsof three instances and are now legally guaranteed against molestation andwant by a conclusive decision of theroyal tribune of appeal which virtuallyacknowledges them as the adopted children of the local mayor and corporation and entitles them for evermore tothe protection of the authorities whowill henceforth stand to them in locoparentisOne can scarcely conceive that suchpretty harmless confiding creaturesas the public pests of Venice shouldhave been constrained by cruel persecution to set the clumsy machineryof Italian law in motion in order toformally regulate their physical position To such straits as these however the pigeons of St Mark were

eye on themain chance and briskly expectant ofthe goods n gods provide whichindeed seldom fail to satisfy their ex ipectations The juvenile miscreantswere promptly seized and hauled awayby the executive to answer for theircrimes before a Venetian tribunal Itmay be hoped that while they were incustody awaiting arraignment theywere haunted by dread visions of Casanova and Silvio Pellico shivering orsweltering sotto i piombi or of thedamp dungeons far beneath the waterlevel that are still accessible from theback of the ducal palace by the dismalBridge of SighsBefore they could be tried and sentenced however it was indispensablethat they should be prosecuted and thequestion arose how could an indictmentbe legally framed against them for killing pigeons which belonged to no onein particular and were only publicproperty in the sense that they subsisted upon voluntary contributions ofmiscellaneous food This question wassatisfactorily answered after the culprits had been subjected to a certainamount of preventive detention bythe municipality of Venice which cameto the front as one man and claimedthe feathered occupants of the piazzi asthe property of the amphibious queenof the Adriatic The court of first instance allowed the claim of the Venetian common council and the ragamuffins were duly fined and imprisonedbut as we have already stated thepigeons case was reconsidered by tribunals of still higher rank and hasonly just been definitely decided intheir favor by thesupreme court of appeal London TelegraphBlowing Out RabbitsEnglish farmers who know it

itsucceeds well if the surplus water is removed by the drainage It grows mostluxuriously in dark loamy soils witha gravel or sand drainage not too closeto the surface Still by artificial drainage and the application of stable andbarn yard manure it can be made toproduce a heavy crop on stiff clay landsIn any system of first class farming onsoils that will produce grain crops regularly it can be made to play an important part and produce profitablecrops its successtui growth in thewest is onljT limited by the lack of moisture It is out of the question to growit on soil too wet or too dry It can begrown successfully in rotation with allfarm crops and we doubt not withmany of the garden crops The part ittakes In a rotation depends very muchon the section of country in which it isgrown and the crop most in demandSuffice it to say that we cannot get toomuch of it As a rule farmers are satisfied with too little The short est rotation profitable running through aseries of years is one in which it occupies the land every third year Say in3i rotation of corn wheat and clover orDf potatoes wheat and clover or of cornrye and clover Where the hay crop isa profitable one clover and timothycan follow wheat In the first crop ofhay the clover will predominate thesecond will be timothy in the main thefertilizing benefits of the clover stimulating the timothy to a remarkable degree It should be understood by farmers that in our great farming areawhere mixed farming ds practiced thatslover reaches the highest state of perfection the second year after sowingLeaving it to occupy the land longerthan this results in loss Very seldomis the thhd years crop as good as thesecond Usually not much more thanone half as good aftentimes nearly acomplete failure If there is a farmerwho grows wheat corn and timothy onhis land and thinks he cannot growclover the best thing he can do is toknow why he cannot By his systemoffarming he or his progeny are sure tocome to want with the

the placeEconomy is the first lesson for anybodyto learn if he would succeed in his business But economy does not imply anything unreasonable The picking upof a lost horseshoe a strap a bolt ornut an ear of corn that fell from thewagon a fork full of hay that droppedfrom a load is a small matter but athousand such items if put togetherwould amount tp a good deal and wouldgo a long way toward helping a manout of troubleTo save is better than to earn Toutilize small things is better than tostrive for what is beyond our reachThe small farmer he who has a smalltract etf land may be just as
