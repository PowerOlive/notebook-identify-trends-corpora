Hutchcraft, of Paris, in which the TrustCompany seeks to place the Hutchcraft estate in involuntary bankruptcy. It is said that the bulk of Mr.Hutchcraft's indebtedness is in Bourbon county, and that they are anxiousfor the estate to be administered byMr. McClure, believing that he willconvert it into money as rapidly aspossible and turn the proceeds over tothe creditors.It is said that the law forbids theplacing of a man in involuntary bank- ruptcy whose principal occupation isthat of a farmer, and the contentionof the litigants is along that line.The petition of the Security TrusfCompany will be strenuously fought"by rest of the creditors.ATTEND DEMONSTRATION.Free demonstration of National Bisc uit Co.'s crackers, cakes, etc. Heinz s57 varieties and Breakfast DelightCoffee on Thursday and Friday, at our(S-lt) N.

Claude M. Thomas, who presided,scored the United States Governmentfor allowing through its alleged laxmethods the disease to enter thiscounty and then proposing to pay onlyhalf of the value of the slaughteredanimals, compelling the State to paythe balance. James Thompson, jpnthe other hand insisted on hearty cooperation with the officials.It was decided to print the laws relating to the quarantine in the localpapers in order to instruct the farmersas to their duties. The large herd ofThomas Henry Clay, Jr., which hasbeen under suspicion was declared bythe inspectors to be entirely free ofthe disease.County Judge Chas. A. McMillan received a telegram Friday from Mr. J.W.

Thetelegram follows:Louisville, Ky., Dec. 4.Chas. A. McMillan,Paris Ky:Washington advises that fat stockfrom your county can move for immediate slaughter interstate, under Federal inspection. Am now working toget inspector provided for your county. What arrangements can youmake for paying salary of same? Thisis Federal requirement and not State.J. W. NEWMAN,Chairman State Live Stock SanitaryBoard.The situation here is not regardedas being serious, and no spread ofthe infection has been reported, everypossible precaution having been takenby Dr. H. M. Hamilton, Livestock Inspector for Bourbon County, acting inconjunction with the Federal Inspectors. Kentucky has no appropriation tvail-f.able for reimbursing owners,'. w1isjlstock is killed by Federal author!ties in the campaign for the eradication of the foot-and-mouth disease; theGovernor has no power to bind theState by any agreement to reimbursethe owners, and before the next session of the General Assembly, in January, 1916, a new Governor -will be inaugurated. Nevertheless, Gov. McCreary statedthat he is in favor of the State reimbursing the owners for such part ofthe loss as the Federal Governmentdoes not pay for, providing otherStates do it, but he believes that Con- jgress siiouia toot tne enure diii, sincethe cattle are to be killed for the protection of other States not infectedas well as Kentucky, and the slaughtering is being done by Federal authorities. This was the substance of his replyto the telegram from Secretary ofAgriculture Houston, asking him togive assurance that Kentucky will reimburse the onwers for half the valueof the stock slaughtered, and he tolda delegation of farmers from Woodford county practically the samething.NOTICE TO TURKEY HANDLERS.Chas.

The disease mayalso be carried on wheels of vehiclesand in various other ways. Henceone method of spreading the infectionresults from the visiting of infectedfarms by farmers and other personsintent on seeing the disease. From aneducational standpoint, farmers andcattle men are, in a measure, justifiedin desiring to observe the disease atfirst hand, jret the danger resultingfrom this greatly over-balances the information to be gained and is a practice which should be condemned byall having the interests of live stockraisers at heart. Dogs and cats shouldbe kept tied up, and every method employed to destroy pigeons, buzzards,sparrows and other carriers of the infection. Birds and dogs are not susceptible to the disease, but are capable of spreading the infection to adjoining farms.It is imperative that all suspectedcases of foot-and-mouth disease be reported to State and Federal authorities at once, and that no animals suffering from this disease be concealed.They will eventually be uncovered inthe routine inspection which will involve a long quarantine of the entireState and which works a hardship onthe people and causes a great depression in business. Some farmers arenot aware of the seriousness of thisdisease and the inconvenience it willbring about until suppressed. Theheartiest co-operation should be forthcoming from all cattlemen. All suspected cases should be reported toDr. S. F. Musselman, State Veterinarian, Louisville, Kentucky.There is no cure for this disease.There are several remedies suggestedfrom unreliable sources that are absolutely worthless, both as preventativesand as cures for this disease. Do notbuy any remedy for this purpose, regardless of testimonials.Avoid "sure cures" and so-calledserums for this disease, and do notpermit the promulgators of same onyour premises. They might bring theinfection to your farm from infectedherds.For further information, write to theVeterinary Department of the Experiment Station, Lexington, Kentucky,for Circular 28.NO NEED TO FEAR MEAT.According to the specialists of theDepartment of Agriculture peopleeven in States quarantined for thefoot-and-mouth disease need have nofear of eating meat, provided theyGook it thoroughly. The foot-and-mouthdisease is not easily communicated to human beings through food,although milk from a diseased cowmight transmit the disease to a humanbeing. In the case of milk, however,pasteurization will render it entirelysafe. Human beings who do get thedisease commonly get it from directcontact with a sick animal. It is wisest, therefore, for people to keep awayfrom all animals having the diseaseunless they are properly provided withrubber gloves, coats and boots, andthese are thoroughly disinfected aftereach visit to the animals.In the case of meat, as in the caseof milk, it must be remembered thatall herds which actually show thedisease a e quarantined, and neithermilk nor meat from the sick animalscan be sold. Sixty per cent, of themeat used in this country is producedin the nearly. 900 federally inspectedslaughtering and packing establishments located in 240 cities. In theseestablishments no animal is slaughtered until it has passed an ante-morteminspection and also a most rigid postmortem inspection by a veterinarianat the time of slaughter. Afterslaughter its meat can not leave theestablishment until it has been carefully examined and stamped "U. S.Inspected and Passed." In all theseestablishments no animal showing anysymptoms whatever of foot-and-mouthdisease is allowed to go to slaughter,and no meat which, on postmorteminspection, shows any suspicioussymptoms of this complaint can beshipped out of the establishment. Allmeat suspected of coming from an animal suffering with this complaint issent, under Government seal, tothe itanks to be rendered into fertilizer.The Federal inspection stamp on meat,therefore means that it is entirelysafe.The Federal Government, however,has no jurisdiction over local slaughterhouses which do not ship meat outside of the State in which it is slaughtered. If, however, meat from suchan animal did escape from one oflocal slaughterhouses, which are purely Uliuer oid.it: ui muuxuiyai i:uuuui, a.n tdanger of its communicating the dis-.ease to human beings would be re-,moved wnen it is tnorougniy cooKeuand sterilized. Those who are locatednear an infected region and wish tobe absolutely certain of the safety oftheir meat should cook it thoroughly.The disease when contracted byadults is not at all a serious illness.It commonly takes the form of slightfever sores in the mouth and a slighteruption on the fingers. In the caseof small or sickly children it may takea more serious form, especially ifcomplicated by other illness.Not New to Her.He (moony) "Was there ever alove like ours?"

On Its site, according tolegend, Clovis was baptized in thefifth century, and there Joanof Arcsaw the consecration bf CharlesJVII.There also, the kings of France werebrowned and anointed. . - .-Two of the chief features of thecathedral, which, dates hack to 1211,were the inost famous rose window"of 'the world, almost forty feet in diameter, an'd the 530 statues, adorningVhe portals and facades, Including 42Colossal statues jof French kings.Near the north portal was one of themasterpieces bf Gothic sculpture, representing the '"Last Judgment," witha figure bf Christ in Vhe attitude bfbenediction.The interior was wbrjd-renbwnedtor. its exquisite stained glass, its six-'teenVh-benVury'tapestries and greatorgan, one of the finest in Europe.'Although not uite so .rich in "historical interest, the cathedral of NotreDame In Paris is more ancient thanthat bf Reims, the main building having been begun In 'the twelfth ben'tury. It is said foa't if the pillars ofNotre -Dame could speakthey mighttell 'the whole history bf France.

There are 420 mills and 790logging camps in the province, employing 60,000 men.The Massachusetts forestry association offers as a prize the planting offifty acres of white pine, to the town Jwhich gains first place in a contestfor town forests.The Boise National forest in Idaho ihad 30 fires during the past summer,yet 28 were down to less than 10acres, and of these 15 were less thanone-quarter of an acre. The supervisor says this success was due to alookout tower, and to efficient telephone and heliograph service.Because of the war, English manufacturers and consumers, of woodpulp have been caused considerableuneasiness. Production is at a standstill in the countries at war, and inNorway and Sweden, principal sourcesof supply, mills have been greatlyhampered because of a lack of coaland of chemicals.

She says if she can take awhack at consumption afore she diesshe'll rest easier, an' I guess she will."He wiped his eyes with his knucklesand reached for Ihe package of bealswhich the pretty attendant had put upfor him."Where do you live?" said the richlydressed woman, who had been an interested listener to the shabby man'sbrief story. He gave an address In oneof the poorest tenement house neighborhoods. "I was going to buy a few seals formy little girl," said the woman, "butyour wife's desire to get a whack atconsumption has shown me what Ishould do. Please give me $30 worth,miss.

Cohan's galloping farce, based onEarl Deer Biggar's novel, which willbe seen at the Ben Ali Theatre, inLexington, is Cohan at his best. Hehas constructed something entirelydifferent in stagq offerings,a farcewith tense dramatic moments andand without horse play. In fact theaudience is the one on which the jokeis played. Cohan has achieved a newheight in his career with one of hispeculiar gifts, drawing characters sotrue to life that they have a chanceat immortality, and this through themedium of a farce, until Cohan hadbrought his genius and stagecraft tobear shudderingly melodramatic situations have never been able to workin harmony with gales of laughter.But that is what "Seven ' Keys toBaldpate" exemplifies. The plot ofthe play is so clever that to tell of itin detail .would detract from the enjoyment of witnessing it. The mainbody of a play within a play or theplay within the play is in two actsa prolugue preceding the play and anepilogue succeeding the concrete playitself."Seven Keys to Baldpate" is one ofthe greatest successes of the stagetoday. It played over a year at theGaiety Theatre in New York, and forsix months at the Cohan Grand OperaHouse, in Chicago. The original castand production will be seen in Lexington. Included in the company aresuch sterling players as Cyril Scott,John O'Hara, Ia Sterett, WilliamGibson, Spencer Charters, Walter D.Green, Frank Monroe, J.

Justas the nurse was on the point of applying it to Wallower's back thedarned ear pulled out and the bagbusted and squirted boiling water allover the patient."That cured Wallower. If it hadn'tbeen for .the interference of other parties Wall would have killed that attendant.
