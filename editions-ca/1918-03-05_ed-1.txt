Theother removes the ban on mutton andlamb on the meatless Tuesdays untilApril 15.Mr. Sackett received word directfrom Washington that the prohibition against the sale of 'live andfreshly killed hens ana pullets,which went into effect February 11,does not apply to broiling chicken-5weighing two pounds or less. Therefore those who enjoy the tenderchickens may obtain the lightweightbroiler from their dealers as usual.The State of Kentucky was included in the list of States wherein theuse of mutton and lamb will be permitted on the meatless Tuesdays until April 15, in another order issuedin Washington. The Food Administration has found that the saving inmutton and lamb which has beenmade through the conservation movement is sufficient to take care of theneeds at the present time, and inorder to relieve the people of Kentucky from as much as possible ofthe inconvenience caused by the foodrestrictions they have been withdrawn thus far.This relief will be greatly appreciated by the hotels and restaurants,it is believed, as they have found itdifficult to make their menus completely satisfactory on meatless day3.m i mREPORT OF DANIELS SALEAuctioneer M.

Smith, of Hart county, oughtnot to pass and pointing out the factthat the three counties said to dointerested in the resolution had theirlepiedy in the courts under Statelaws already in effect if evidencecould be obtained.The committee frankly reportsthat its action is based on the factthat tobacco is commanding: thehighest price in the history of the!State, or of the trade, and that thecrop of 1917 has been "the most enormously profitable of any in the history of our agricultural life."Mr. Thomas urged the House to letthe tobacco market alone this yeai,at least. He said he had been in thethick of the fight for tobacco prices,had been threatened with assassination 'and jail, and that he did not believe there ever had been any dissolution of the tobacco trust and thatthat great organization still had thepower to depress or to raise price.An act to prohibit the manufactureand sale of cigarettes was introducedby Senator Richardson. The bill fixesa fine of not less than ten nor morethan a hundred dollars and imprisonment in county jail for not lessthan five nor more than fifty days foeviolations of the act.The Senate by the vote of 16 to 13passed the bill of Senator W.

These subscribers submit to such inconveniencerather than offend their neighbors2jy refusing to lend the paper.,; -Recently we had' a subscriber todiscontinue his paper, saying he likedIt and "hated to give it up, but hisneighbors borrowed it regularly, even"before he had time to read it, andhe would therefore quit taking it fora month and see whether the neigh"bors would subscribe for it themselves. People who borrow papers doubtless do not realize that they .are annoying and inconveniencing the subscriber, or they would stop the practice -of borrowing. A little thought-fulness on the part of the borrower-will lead to the conclusion that borrowing is a bad practice. Remember the old saying, "Neither a borrower or lender be?"If you have been a borrower whynot now become a subscriber yourself and have the paper reach youregularly twice each week?

AThe average street fakir can takea stand and a dry goods box on aprominent street corner in Paris andin an hour can talk an audience ofthree dozen people out of $50 to$100. The editor of a first-classpaper like THE NEWS might assume the position and plead twice aslong to twice the number of peoplefor the price of the year's subscription to the paper that congratulatesa man on- his marriage; that announces the birth of his children;that tells where his neighbors spendSunday; warnsjiim of tricksters andfakirs; brands him out as a wretchand scoundrel he goes to jail;and bears the burden of grief andsympathy of the entire communityfor a whole' week when he dies, andat the same time bids him a successful journey to "the happy hunting grounds."

CONSERVATION."The average American home isoverheated," declares Dr. Garfield,head of the Federal Fuel Administration. "A room heated above 68 degrees Fahrenheit is too warm forhealth and exposes its occupants tocatarrhal diseases and pneumonia."i -While the foregoing health recommendation is primarily intended topromote the conservation of coal, theFuel Administration is supported bysome of the most eminent medicalauthorities in the country in urgingits eeneral adoption. Even a babyis warm enough in a temperature of68 degrees, according to Dr. S. JosetTiitip Tlaker. head of the Bureau ofChild Hvsiene. of New York.With the gradual development ofthe tremendous demands the war industrial program will eventuallymake on the fuel supplies of thecountry, the urgent need of coal conservation becomes manifesto Eventhe most effective fuel control measures will be impotent to prevent acoal shortage unless the Americanhousewife practices the most rigideconomy, according .to the government fuel experts. Among tne qoaiconservation practices suggested arethe following:""Burn wood instead of coal wherever that is possible. Use the crookedand defective trees from the woodlotif you live in the country. One cordof. hard wood is equivalent to a tonof coal, according to the Fuel Administration. "Rural churches and grange hallgshould substitute wood for coaUWood makes a quicker fire, dies downsnnnfir and its use will release coalfor other purposes." "Don't burn coal in your opengrate fires.

Fred Miles, formerly of Tulsa, Okla.;now of Lexington, Ky.f against the Union OilCompany, which has offices here anaat Cleveland, Ohio.The petition, one of the most voluminous and exhaustive documentsever filed in Eastern Kentucky, wasprepared by Messrs. Robt. B. FranKlin, of Lexington, and Robert C. Tabott, of Paris, and Judge Ed. C.O'Rear, of Frankfort, atorneys forthe plaintiff.The Union Oil Company, the petition recites, is a Kentucky corporation, holding leases on 1,280 acresof land in. Estill and Powell Counties,,the greater portion being in EstillCounty. Its capital stock is $75,000,and its officers are W. R. Thompson,Jacksonville, Fla., President,' Norwood Johnson, Pittsburg, Penn., VicePresident; Carl J. Weidman,, Cleveland, Ohio, Treasurer, '.and M. O.Thompson, Irvine, Ky., Secretary.J. Fred Miles is an experienced oiloperator from the Oklahoma field,and is one of the pioneers in the Kentucky field. His attention was calledto the properties of the United OilCompany by James Hillis, who hasthe distinction of having drilled thefirst thirteen producing wells in theTickey Fork district and of havinginduced the building of the Cumberland pipe line to the Estill Countyfield.About May 1, 1917, the petitionrecites, J. Fred Miles was introducedto Carl J. Weidman and other stockholders of the United Oil Company,and it was agreed that Miles shouldsend his field men to the property tomake an investigation of its approximate value, with the understandingthat if the reports of the investigators should be favorable Miles wouldenter into negotiations with the United Oil Company -for the purchase ofthe property.The reports were favorable, andon May 10 Miles went to IsTew Yorkand consulted his financial backers,former Governor Myron T. Herrick,of Cleveland, and William F. Bonbright & Co., bankers of New York,to the end that he went to Cleveland,and on May 15, tlie petition setsforth, closed an agreement with theUnited Oil Company, through Carl J. iWeideman, under which he procured ian option on the properties at a priceto be $1,500,000 net cash to the company. The following day, Miles, according to the petition and substantiatedby papers filed as exhibits, advisedthe company that he would take theproperty at the price stipulated, subject to the settlement of litigationthen pending in the Estill CircuitCourt, concerning a portion of theW. L. Marcum farm, covering approximately 50 acres above the cliff, andknown as the Christopher tract.A $3,000,000 corporation was organized to take over the propertiesof the United Oil Company throughJ. Fred Miles, together with theholdings of J. Fred Miles, and intothis corporation with Miles and Bonbright & Co. came J. I. Lamprechl,of Cleveland.The $1,500,000 to be paid the United Oil Company was provided, andMiles and his associates in the53,000,000 corporation, the petitionstates, called upon the United OilCompany to deliver the propertieswith titles clear, with the exceptionof the Marcum litigation, to coverwhich it had been agreed, "$180,000,would be held in escrow.But the petition recites, defects inthe title were discovered and mad3known to the buyer and seller andtheir attorneys.Thereupon Miles and associates inthe $3,000,000 corporation demandedof the United Oil Company that itclear up and "deliver to them goodand merchantable titles," which todate, according to the petition, theUnited Oil Company has failed to do.It is generally believed in this section that the holding of the United'Oil Company combined with the holdings of J. Fred Miles were worm$4,500,000 to $5,000,000. At thetime of the purchase by Miles theUnited Oil Company had 40 wellsproducing 2,2-00 barrels daily, and50 or 60 undrilled locations.m pa P3EAT BIG MEALS!
