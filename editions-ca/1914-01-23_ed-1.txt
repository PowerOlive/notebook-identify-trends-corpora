"The opinion of the country wouldinstantly approve of such a commission. It would not wish to see it empowered to make terms with monopoy or in any sort to assume control ofbusiness, as if the government- madeitself responsible. It demands .such acommission only as an indispensableinstrument of information and publicity, as a clearing-house for the factsby which both the public mind andthe managers of great business undertakings should, be guided, and asan instrumentality for doing justiceto business where the processes ofthe courts or the natural forces ofcorrection, outside the courts, areinadequate to adjust the remedy tothe wrong in a way that will meet allthe equities -and clrcumstancesof thecase.

"'- -HIS" MESSAGETO CONGSESS'(Continued from page 2)imperative considerations of justiceand fair play suggest thoughtful remedial action. Not only do many ofthe' combinations effected or soughtto be effected in the industrial worldwork an injustice upon the public ingeneral; they also, directly and seriously injure the individuals who areput out of business in one unfair wayor another by the many, dislodgingand exterminating forces of combina- ptioii. I hope that we shall "agree ingiving private individuals who claimto have been injured by these processes the right to found their suits.for redress upon the facts and judg-jments proved ana enteream suits oythe government where the government has upon its own initiative suedthe combinations complained of andwon its suit, and that the statute of)limitations shall be sunerea to runagainst such litigants only from thedate of the conclusion of the government's action. It is not fair that theprivate litigant should be obliged toset up and establish again the factswhich the government hasv proved.He cannot afford, he has not the power, to make use of such processes ofinquiry as "the government has command of. Thus shall individual justice be done while the processes ofbusiness are rectified and squaredwith the general conscience."I have laid the case before you,no doubt, as it lies in your own mind,as it lies In the thought ofthecountry.What must every candid man say ofyou, of the plain obligations of whichnew things for which the country' isnot prepared? No; but that they areold things, now familiar, and must, ofcourse, be undertaken if we are tosquare our laws with the thought anddesire of the country. Until thesethings are done, conscientious business men the country over will beunsatisfied. They are in these thingsour mentors and our colleagues.

Mary Turner,the central character. Is falsely accused of the theft of gpods'from theestablishment in which she is employed, and sente4ced to three years' imprisonment. She serves her time,tries to support herself honestly afterward, but the police harass and"hound" her. When they have' forced her 'out of several places byrecalling her imprisonment, the girl,in desperation, defies them, and proclaims' that as they have compelledher to a career of crime she will beatthem, and stay "witnin the law," too.Then retribution begins to shapeitself. She becomes the leader of aband of crooks. Any scheme thatcan be profitably handled withoutoverstepping the legal boundariesshe takes up beats a sharp, unscrupulous swindler at his own game,steers skillfully between blackmailand perfectly proper 'compromise, explaining that it's all a matter of having a lawyer to make anything safethrough the queer ethics X)f his profession. Meanwhile she avengesherself on the canting hypocrite whosent, her to prison by marrying hisson'. Then one of her associates, anex-burglar, is tempted against hercommand iato robbing the residenceof the father of the man she hadwedded. A "stool pigeon" (meaning,a police spy, in the vernacular) hasarranged it. The girl "tries to savethem, even after .they have enteredthe house, liut It is too late. In therush the informer ' is killed. Andwhen the police break in, husbandand wife are chatting together nervously to stave off disaster.Then - comes the big thrill "thethird degree examination of all parties by a police inspector made to getthe murdexer. In an intense scenethe guilty man finally confesses, partly because of nervous strain and partly because of his lore for the girl.From thia joint the play in a seriesof artful aad tinewy tcenes, reachesa climax that ! fairly nerve-grippingin its .dramatic intensity.(adv)--,- titfPirriKr.comflirtB'tlM oast:.

Miss Swinburne comes here direct from theGlobe Theatre in New York, whereshe. has been appearing successfullysince early last fall. The Lexingtonengagement is limited to one performance, Wednesday night, January28,, at the Lexington Opera House."The Madcap Duchess" is an exquisite light opera and in the long historyof light opera in this country therehas never been a more delightfulwork than this Victor Herbert's latest offering. Every melody has beenwritten lovingly, and in harmonizingthe accompaniments and working outthe esemble, the composer has produced some of the most delicate effects. "Love is a Story That's Old'"Do You Kow," the Madrigal and theShepherd's Dance are numbers thatare sure to charm one. While MissSwinburne has not 'been seen in Lexingto in over three years she hasmade wonderful progress during thattime and she stands today at thehead of prima donnas associated withlight operain this country. MessrsDavid Stevens and Justin HuntlyMcCarty have supplied her with a rolethat fits her like a glove.
