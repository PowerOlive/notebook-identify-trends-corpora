IeftOpen for the Present to 15e Deterxnined by a Commission to Be Appointed by the Two CountriesWashington 1 The cabinetconvened in a special session Saturdayto approve formally the answer of theUnited States to the Spanish note asking-peace Practically all was in readiness for a final vote the language ofthe diplomatic note to be coufmunicated to Spain having- been practically settled upon FridayIt is understood that the questionleft open as to the Philippines hasbeen settled by leaving- the government of the islands to the decision ofa joint commission under certainbroad conditions to be required ofSpain these conditions being protective of American lifeStill the general principle underlying-the arrangement is understood tobe the development of the sober second thought of the American people asto the disposition of the Philippinesunclouded by the clash of war and unaffected by the momentary lust forterritorial acquisition Of course it isunderstood with regard to other questions than the Philippines the situation is as stated FridayAbsolute cession to the United Statesof Porto Rico and all the islands inthe West Indies save CubaRelinquishment by Spain of sovereignty in Cuba The United Stateswill exercise control there until astable g overnment can be establishedAcquisition of coal station in theLadrone islands and perhaps the CarolinesNo assumption of Spain s Cuban orPorto Rican debts by the UnitedStatesNo war indemnity from SpainThe answer of the United States wassubmitted to M Cambon the Frenchambassador at 2 oclock SaturdayafternoonWashington July 30 There wereintimations at the state departmentSaturday that Spain will accept theterms as laid down by the presidentand that the next move on the partof the Madrid government will besuch a notification and a requestfor the cessation of hostilities Ofcourse this will be granted if the request for the stopping of the war iscoupled with a positive acceptance ofour termsWashington Aug 1 The personsbest informed as to the probabilitiesdeclare that the answer of the Spanishgovernment to the terms of peace outlined by the government of the UnitedStates is not expected before TuesdayThis opinion is based upon a knowledge of the time when the UnitedStates communication was received inMadrid which was not until an earlyhour Sunday morning the time required to deciDher it the necessity foran extended consideration of the matter bj the Spanish cabinet and also thefor carefully framing the rejoinder It is not meant by this statement to question in any manner thefull plenipotentiary powers of MCambon the French ambassador indealing with the subject On thecontrary they are in latitude widerthan those usually confered in suchcases But his position is somewhatsimilar to that of the president himself who is obliged to secure thesanction of the United States senateto any treaty of peace that he mayprepare for the ambassador must submit to the Madrid cabinet for its approval imy agreement that he mayenter into But in the drafting ofsuch an agreement he is fully authorized to proceed in his discretionand to guard against any possibilityof repudiation of his action he hasbeen given the minutest definition ofthe concessions that will be made bythe Spanish government on every pointthat by any possibility could be expected to arise in the course of the negotiations It was not known to ourg overnment that M Cambon hadsuch powers when he appeared Saturday afternoon at the white house tcreceive the American answer butwhen once the president was satisfiedthat he was competent to deal in anauthorized manner with our government the production of his credentialswas hailed with satisfaction as tending to hasten the reaching of an agreement without loss of time and in themost direct manner for technicallythe United States is now treatingwith Spain without the interventionof any third power It may be saidalso that M Cambon is proceeding-with straightforwardness towardshis object and that there is no fear ofdevious diplomacy being- introducedinto the negotiationsPerpetual Light Man ArrestedLoGANSPORT Ind Aug 1 S BINickum

wereworking it and sharing the cabin ofmud chinked logs that made a triflingexcrescence on the profile of the hillnto which the tunnel of the BlackDwarf retreated The senior partnerand more experienced miner of theSrm was a big valiant hilarious Irishrrnan Mike McGowan a man of hishands yet not disdaining weapons theother was a young gentleman of prepossessing appearance and uncertainantecedents who had come into thepartnership rather on the strength ofa small capital than of his muscle Mikecalled him little Darcie but thismust be understood as a term of endearment for Darcies inches were asmony as Mikes though his poundsavoirdupois were fewerMike had learned that his partner wasof Scottish family and English education and that he had traveled in various parts Oi the world He was easy-tempered and clever in ways in which iMike had the skill of a bear but hewas slack about camp work and cleaning up after meals Mikes acquaintances said he -was too tonj for aminer People called him Darcie because he seemed to expect it but doubtswere entertained in cautious circles asto its being his name or all of itdfaution not to say suspicion being thecommon attitude

her lips smiled xdeasure andsympathy and appreciation She wasan adorable girlIn despair Darcie placed at her disposal his entire wardrobe including hisboots and she made clever selection ofa Turkish

CONTINTJEDTheA BRIEF BATTLEConstitution Famous Pijjhtwith the GnerriereHull ran dawn before the wind totake a look at the stranger and foundhim with his main topsail aback waiting for the Constitution to come upBoth ships cleared for action and whenthe Constitution was still far astern theGuerriere began firing at long rangeOnly two or three shots ware fired inreturn and then the American boredown upon the Englishman in silenceNothing shows more forcibly the perfect discipline of theship than thi hourof waiting with men standing- at quarters and their comrades falling aroundthem Even Mr Morris the first lieutenant found it hard to restrain hisimpatience and he asked to be allowedto fire 2sTot till the ships were fairlyabreast and within pistol shot of eachother was the word finally given Theeffect was almost instantaneous as awhole broadside struck the Guerrierefollowed quickly by a second staggering blow Her mizzenmast went overboard and the Constitution was- ableto pass around the Guerrieres bowwhere she delivered -a raking fire whichcut away the foremast and much of therigging In wearing to return acrossher bow the Guerrieres starboard bowfouled the port quarter of the Constitution Jlfc was while in this positionthat both sides tried to board andLieut Bush of the Marine corps wajkilled and Lieut Morris was dangerously wounded Two guns in the howof the Guerriere were fired point blanlinto the cabin of the Constitution oneset fire to the ship The danger wagrave but the wind and sea swept thenclear and Lieut Hoffman put out thefire As the ships separated the Guerrieres foremast and mainmast went bjthe board leaving her a nelpless hullin the trough of the sea Capt Dacresmuch desired interview was overhaving lasted from the first broadsidiof the Constitution just 30 minutesHe was wounded 79 of his -men out of icrew of 272 were killed and woundedand not a stick was left standing on Hisdeck There was no need to haul dowrthe flag it was gone with the riggingand Capt Dacres surrendered perforceThe Constitution had lost 14 men andsustained comparatively smallWithin a few hours she was ready foranother fight The Guerriere was socut to pieces that she could not be takeninto pgrt and Hull burned her Thelast act after removing the prisonersand wounded gives one a glimpse ofthe Christianity and chivalry of thesetwo captains who spoke the sametongue and in whose veins flowed thesame blood Capt Hull asked CaptDacres if there was anything he wouldlike to save from his ship He saidyes his mothers Bible which he hadcarried with him for years An officerwas sent to get it Thus began a friendship between these enemies whichlasted till Hulls death in 1843 Tradition has it that in this fight the Constitution obtained her sobriquet

JreFrom Spanish Rule When theTreaty Has Been SignedWashington July 30 The cabinetdiscussed the presidents answer toSpains peace proposal and reachedthe following decisionsThe absolute surrender of Porto Rico to the United StatesRecognition of the independence ofCubaCession of one of the Ladrone islands to the United States as a coalinjrstation and the cession to the UnitedStates of at least a coaling station inthe PhilippinesThe question undecided is what disposition shall be made of the Philippine islands as a whole It can bestated that there is practically no difference of opinion in the cabinet onthe question of the retention of thePhilippine islands as a whole allthe members being opposed to ouracquisition of these islands Therehas been no decision however as yeton the extent to which the government will go in its decision respectingthe future of these islands but it isprobable that the answer of the president will express the willingness ofthis government to leave the matter ofthe f ature government of the Philippines entirely in the hands of a jointcommission to be appointed by thisgovernment and the government ofSpain The probability is that theUnited States will insist upon a guarantee of certain reforms in government in the Philippine islandsOur answer will make no mention ofthe money indemnity Neither willthere be any armistice at alL Theanswer will be in the nature of anultimatum and if Spain does not accept it she will fare worse in thefuture The note from Spain it issaid was a very adriot and equivocaldocument from reading which onewould think the onlmy question involved was Cuba Apparently Spain mightnot really have intended getting a direct answer from us but only to opendiplomatic correspondence This government will not have any such correspondence but will make a straightforward statement of its present peaceterms for Spains acceptance or rejection naming conditions that underthe circumstances are reasonable andeven generousPublic men who talked with thepresident and members of the cabinetFriday positively assert the administration has confidence in the sincerityand motive of the Spanish note thatthe administration takes the view thatthis note is the beginning of the endand that the administration is practically certain the answer of this government and the general terms it will-propose will be accepted by SpainAdm Dewey may be called to Washington later on to consult with the administration as to the general situation in the Philippines the reformsthat are needed in the present form ofgovernment of the islands and the location that should be reserved for ourcoaling station thereThe cabinet also decided that Spanish sovereignty in the entire Carribean and West Indian waters must beutterly removed This means thatnot only Porto Rico and Cuba be relinquished but that the Spanish flagmust be taken down on every one ofthe numerous small islands in thishemisphere This is in accordancewith a sentiment that has been growing for some weeksTwo other propositions were alsodisposed of The indebtedness assumedby Spain and charged against both theislands of Cuba and Porto Rico willnot be assumed by this governmentand moreover commercial treaties nowexisting between these island and other portions of Spanish domain will beinvalidated by the transfer of authority the cabinet having decided not torecognize themThe cabinet met again at 330 p mFriday and at 520 adjourned until Saturday morning at 1030 It was statedafter adjournment that no decision hadyet been reached as to

he had the good sense notto spoil with a comb and brushThere was also a square shoulderedfellow who bristled with energy Heseemed to be employed in outsidework and it was only in the earlyhours that he had a chance to talkwith her She treated him with sufficient cordiality to cause jealous feelings on my side of the canyon for itpleased me to fancy myself in love withherLastly there was the old bookkeeper who must have lived somewhere inthe country for he brought her suchflowers as the florists do not sell andlaid them on her desk before she camedown He would be alone in the officethen and he did not know that I waswatching him from across the chasmI have seen him spend 20 minutes inarranging half a dozen wild flowersand then dodge quietly away at thesound of a step in the hall In all mydays at the window I never saw him address her till she had first spoken tohimThere was a day in Tune when shedid not come to the office A tributeof blossoms awaited her and I couldread anxiety in the old bookkeepersback where he stood by his desk on thefar side of the room as the minutespassed on beyond the usual time ofher appearance When the gray hairedyoung man came in his first glance wasdirected toward the desk of which thelid was closed for the first time at thathour in many monthsImmediately a messenger boy camein with a telegram and when the headof the firm had read it he lookedtoward the closed desk again so Iknew what must be in the dispatchThe bookkeeper was watching over hisshoulder and by and by he plucked upcourage to ask a timid question of hisemplojer The answer made him lookvery graveWhatever the news may have beenhe communicated it to the light hairedyouth and the square shouldered fellow in the latter edge of the luncheonhour before the chief had returnedThey took it very hard and the younger of them stood by the window afterwards when he should have been atwork and he looked the picture ofgriefYet the girl was on hand at the usualhour next morning and was the recipient of cordial greetings though shehad to ask the bookkeeper for his Intne aiternoon when she stood by theopen window for a few minutes Ithought she looked quite ill and worsethan that she seemed apprehensiveThe blight of melancholy was on herI fancied her as one of those unfortunates who in youth are told that therewill be no maturity that the seeds ofdeath are planted and must growThree days later she was absentagain Then I saw her on three successive days leaving out of account anintervening Sunday Again she failedto appear but only for a day and theremainder of the week she was in heraccustomed placeMonday Tuesday and Wednesdaypassed with no glimpse of her In thelate afternoon of that last day a manwho could be known for a doctor halfa mile away made a long call upon thehead of the firm They conversed veryseriously for a few minutes and thendrifted to general themes and laughedand puffed their cigars as if nothingwere wrong That fixed my estimate ofthe gray haired young man at a verylow point in the scaleThere was no sign of her during theweek On Monday I saw unusual sightsin the office across the way First theold bookkeeper came in and while hehad the office to himself he sat in herchair and T saw him shed tears Thenthe young man with the corn coloredhair appeared and upon my word Iwas afraid to see him stand by the openwindow with such a look upon hisface lest he should east himself downto the bottom of the gulfA little later the three clerks thegray haired man and an elderly person whom I took to be the second member of the firm just arrived fromabroad for I had heard a rumor thatone of them had been in Europe nearlya year assembled in conference on aptane ot equality which only a mutualdeep sorrow could have justified Afterawhile the two clerks came backbringing some large pasteboard boxeswhich contained flowers for thou hthey were opened in a part of the officethat my view did not command Igot a glimpse of white blossoms andgreen leavesI think those men were all sincerebut not one of them not even the oldbookkeeper felt a grief that matchedmine Nothing just like that has evercome into my life Perhaps I shouldhave found nothing sympathetic or attractive in that woman if I had mether face to face but when that meeting on this side of the grave had become impossible I pictured her inspeech and in hearf and soul as allthat her sweet face had promisedJ longed to share with those who hadknown her the privilege of expressingmy sorrow at her early death indeedI resolved to do so even at the risk oicommitting an impropriety Therefore when I saw the pasteboard boxe3dispatched in the custody of the messenger boys I hastened to interceptthem on the street It was easy enoughto read the address upon the boxesbut there was no name only a streetand number in BrooklynThat was sufficient however Ihastened to a florists and gave orders for such tokens as seemed to beappropriateAnd so that was the end The -sightof her at the window day after daya feeling of cheer from her bright presence near me and then the sorrow forthe loss of one whose very name 1 didnot know I missed her heartily inthose succeeding weeksEven so late as September I had byno means forgotten her or thedents connected with that time ofstrange and fanciful sorrow It wason the fifth day of that month whena man of a familiar aspect yet certainly not an acquaintance walked intomy office He came slowly up to meand laid two cards upon my desk Onewas my own and the other bore theinscriptionJOHN M DOUGLAS M JJThe name- was not familiar but theman himself I had certainly seen Ahto be sure He was the doctor who hadcome to the office across the way whenthe end was drawing nearThats my card and the other oneis yours isnt it said heInoddedYou sent it with some flowers toSll De Yaux street Brooklyn on June28 didnt youYes I replied they were for herAnd I glanced across the wavWell you probably have some rational explanation of it said he buthang me if I know why you shouldhave sent that cartload of funeral emblems to her on the occasion of herwedding If you wished to intimatethat marriage with me was equivalentto death it was a bad joke sir and ifyou dont then what in thunder didwon mean Ive carried that puzzlewith me 2000 miles this summer onour wedding journey and now byLucifer youve got to tell me the answerI dont want to go any further withthis story It has come to a pointwhere the recollections aroused arereally too painfulVALERIAS PRAYERSA Girl Who Is n Family 13ntertuiner with HerUnique SupplicationsValeria ager seven and a source ofmuch entertainment to the familywas being put to bed by her motherthe other night First she said NowI lay me down to sleep closing ordelaying to close

Jerry and Pedro andJerry is the family horse and Pedrois the dog also given away like Plajfulthe kitten It was evident that theprayer was being made simply a pretext for keeping her mother soValeria

dayValeria climbed into bed with hermother and asked if she might go outto the cemetery and put flowers on thegraves Her mother readily assentedand said she thought it would be a verylovely thing for a little girl to doValeria announced that Mrs Smitha neighbor was going to put flowerson Mr Smiths graveWhat was he she demandedHe wasnt a soldier but it has become a custom for people to put

cometo an end and after the noble lady hadretired to the country for her somewhatprolonged rest from urban gayeties andtemptations a too careful official discovered that among the papers in the casewas the princess certificate of baptismand that she had changed the date of itfrom 1847 to 1867 Instantly this gravecrime was brought to the notice of theauthorities and the convicted embezzlerwas summoned to meet the charge offalsifying an official document Then acurious fact was disclosed and aprising amount of light was thrown onRussian societyThe Prince Eugalytcheff who wascited aso a witness by the prosecutorsaid that whether his bride was 20 yearsolder or younger than her certified agewas a matter of absolute indifference tohim All he could say was that he received the sum of 3
