theExpress Safe Was MadeKansas City Mo Oct 7 Banditsheld up a Chicago Alton expresstrain Wednesday night at a point lessthan six miles from Kansas City Therobbery is the third occurring on thatrailroad within a year all within 15miles of this cityThe Chicago St Louis expresswhich pulled out of the Union depot at880 Wednesday evening was stoppedby eight masked men at Evanston asuburban stopping place just beyondWashington Park Evanston is abouteight miles nearer to Kansas City thanBlue Cut made celebrated by the notorious James gangThe train was stopped at the Evanston siding by the Explosion of torpedoes -which had been placed on thetrack When the conductor and brakemen went out to ascertain the cause ofthe trouble they were covered with revolvers in the hands of four of theeight road agents The other fourquickly covered the engineer and fireman The brakemen was compelled touncouple the baggage and express carsfrom the passenger coaches Whilethis was being done one of the robbersbusied himself by going through thepockets of Conductor Graves who wasrobbed of 22 in coinIn the meantime the bandits at thehead of the train had ordered Engineer Vollctte and his fireman to climbdown out of their cab Engineer Vollette hesitated until a pistol ball wassent whistling by his ears He andthe fireman after this persuasionclimbed down quickly and two of therobbers immediately took their placesThe others of the crowd jumped aboardthe baggage and express cars Thispart of the train they ran up the tracktoward Independence Mo about aquarter of a mile There they compelled the frightened express messenger to open the door of his car Thedoor once open they dragged the messenger out by the legs throwing himto the ground and then took his gunaway fi om him The messenger wasthen compelled to walk back towardthe other portion of the trainAfter securing complete possessionof the engine and the baggage and express cars the bandits placed 24 sticksof dynamite upon the big through safeand then lifted the smaller way safeup on top of it They appliedthe fuse and the match andthen evidently waited for theexplosive to reveal the treasurefor which so much had been riskedBut for some reason the explosivedid not go off and from the subsequentdevelopments it is evident that dynamite had great terrors for the menwho were not afraid to run the ordinary risks of train robberyIt is clear that they were afraid toreturn to the express car for afterwaiting a few minutes for the expectedexplosion they hurriedly left the placerunning into the underbrush whichskirts the railway in that sectionThe trainmen -who had been left behind with the passenger coaches politely waited a reasonable lengthvoftime for the robbers to complete theirwork and then ran ahead to the engineand the two cars After some delayfor they too were afraid of the dynamite they succeeded in lifting downthe small safe and throwing out thedynamite The engine was then runback to the rest of the train andcoupled on and after a full two hoursdelay the express resumed the journeytoward St LouisDETROIT FIREThree Large Buildings With Contents andSeveral Others Damaged as the ResultDetroit Mich

businessbrought over from the day before promised some delay not a little to the relief of Donald Bartels whose client wasunaccountably missing at the appointed hour Brigham had also failed toappear as well as the other witnesseswhom Neil had promised but thisvexatious as it was could not rouse thecame degree of surprise and concernas did the defection of Neil himselfAn ugly suspicion had crept into thelawyers mind to be dismissed at firstas hardly tenable but insidiously growing into conviction as he furtively eyedthe Grubstake people grouped togetherat the other side of the room Did Neilsnonappearance no less than that ofthe others mean some deviltry of theircontrivingCol Meredith sat unconcernedly reading a morning paper his chair somewhat withdrawn from his neighborsThe colonel generally was distinguishedby this little air of aloofness rarelywas he to be seen in any attitude offriendly hobnobbing with an3body Itseemed a part of his natural reserveof character no less than the outgrowthof his profound indifference toward allhumankind that for his comfort hemust demand the widest possible allotment of elbow room At a respectful distance from his employer whoseimpassive nonchalance he seemed unsuccessfully trying to imitate sat themanager of the mine at intervals addressing whispered remarks to the altornevsfevHo -had jeomcyup f 6mDen cverto appear for the defendantfin thecase This last gentleman eminent forhis skill in handling criminal cases ofmore or less shady character enjoyedalmost a greater measure of fame iucertain circles for his zeal in the workof the Sunday school Donald Bartelslegarded him as an arrant sneak andhypocrite despising him no more forthe shyster methods he felt warrantedin crediting to him than for the cloakof sanctimony he assumed for their disguise Keen dislike for the man anddesire to down him on general principles had added peculiar zest to thepresent encounter which proportionately enhanced Bartels exasperation atfinding himself thus handicapped at theoutset by lack of both client and witnessesThe great clock high up on the wallat one side of the room marked thehour of ten and Harvey Neil was stillderelict The case before the court wasplainly drawing to a close The witnessin the chair was the last to be heardand the judge was furtively fingeringthe notes on his desk preparatory to delivering his charge to the jury It happened that Carlton Bartels partnerwas attorney for the defendant iu thatcase and before this the unhappy attorney had hastily scribbled a note explaining his plight and begging thatCarlton would consume all the timepossible in his closing speech to thejury Their only hope now lay in delaying the hearing of the Mascot-Grubstakecase until the plaintiff should beheard fromA clerk who had been below anxiously looking out for the absentees slippedinto the chair at Bartels side Looksmighty queer he superfluously observed I have sent men to look themal up but theres hardly a chance in athousand of getting them here on timenow I should say Whats to be doneWe must demand a continuance 1suppose though Heaven knows whatgood it will do returned Bartels impatiently Who went after NeilMartin from Youngs corral Youknow how he can ride and I told him hemust just hit the high places this timeEn t what on earth can it meanMr Criley the Denver attorney was-crossing the room with a deprecatingtiptoe tread stooping a little as thoughin excess of meekness Tie had givenBartels ceremonious greeting earlier inthe day but now he came with moresociable intention the smile thattwisted his thin lips producing a curious effect of whining ugliness upon hiscadaverous smoothly shaven faceIt rather looks as though theremight be a chance for us presently heobserved clasping his bloodless handstogether in a gesture which for somereason not altogether clear seems to berather commonly cultivated by oratorsaccustomed to address themselves toSunday school audiences You fellows up here in the country are in greatluck let me tell you he went on in au hining whisper In all our Denvercourts we are away behind with ourand losing all the time- It israther the worst in La Hues I just now3ie has been hearing divorce cases rightalong and where a woman is concernedwell you knowXa Eue Your Bennethere is made of sterner stuff Ah whatis that he says pausing as the judgeaddressed a few terse sentences to theattorneys in the case before him Helimits them to five minutes apiece fortheir closing arguments thats business in a tone ofXcordial approvalNo shilly shally nonsense about himI believe there is not a judge on thebench in Colorado who is his equal inall around ability He ought to be madeattorney generalIt is hinted that he is rather of thatopinion himself returned Bartelsiirpatiently Carlton had made a nobleeffort to gain more than the allottedfive minutes but the judge was inexorable Too much time already hadbeen consumed on the case he curtlysaid Other parties were waiting parties from a distance who might be putto serious inconvenience by delay hefelt himself obliged to hasten mattersThats business declared Mr Crileyagain his pale blue eyes beaming satisfaction But by the way Mr Bar-telsisyour client present I am not surethat I know the gentleman even bysightHes not here answered BartelsshortlyDo you mean that he has not yet arrived the tone expressing the mostprofound astonishment But of coursehe will be in presently It will make nodifference in opening the caseI am afraid it will make all the difference in the world sharply retortedthe attorney for the delinquent plaintiff Mr Criley was punctiliously mindful of the Biblical injunction in respectto soft answers but without alwaysachieving the proper Biblical result Sofar from turning away wrath his whining gentleness always roused in DonaldBartels a fever of antagonism If hedoes not get here before the case iscalled I shall of course ask for a continuanceBut my dear sir that will workgreat hardship to us protested theother almost forgetting to be sanctimonious in the excitement of this ideaHere is my client come on from NewYork especially for this case here amI up from Denver at a cost of great personal inconvenience here are our witnesses ready and waiting We are prepared to go on with the trial and shallcertainly protest against any delayAnd I shall most certainly protestagainst trying the case until I am giventime to find out what has befallenmy client returned Bartels hotlyIf parties interested in keeping himfrom appearing in court have been upto any monkey businessOh my dear dear sir interruptedCrily in a tone of righteous grief andprotestThe closing words had been spokenin the case before the court and withan air of relief the jury was filing outof the room Bartels clerk appearedagain breathlessly beckoning him onesideFJveviust got onto a man from Tomrtown who says he saw Neil drinkingbeer at the Busted Prospector saloonearty last evening he hurriedly explained You dont supposeNo I dont retorted Bartelsangrily Neil is a gentleman ne mayhave drunk a glass of beer last evening but I can swear that he did not takeenough to keep him away from court today Of course theres a possibilitythat the beer may have been doctoredthough Was Brigham drinking withhimOh Brigham no he hit the roadfor somawhere yesterday onorningGave it out cold that he was going toAlaska which makes it more than likely that hes bound for MexicoThe pair were joined by Carlton alertand anxious What does it mean heexcitedly demanded Wheres NeilSimply non est and Im afraid itmeans that theres the devil to payBartels gloomily explainedParties concerned in the last suitdrifted away in groups of twos andthrees some to sit dejectedly whispering together in the back of the roomotthers to nervously pace the corridoroutside until the verdict should beknown Certain of the loungers in thechairs allotted to visitors surmisingthat no salacious details need be lookedfor in the Mascot Grubstake case lazilybetook themselves elsewhere in searchof fresh excitement while certain others perceiving Neils defection and nowcomprehending the pressing need of hispresence hurried outside to stare upthe street in fruitless quest of him interested discussing among themselveswhat it might mean The judge leaneddown ait one side of his desk to discusssome matter with a pretty typewritergirl who had come out of an inner roomHe had the strong ruddy physique ofone who enjoys a good appetite and asound digestion the somewhat sensuallines of his mouth softened by a heavyiron gray mustache to which his barber had imparted a youthful curl at theends A deep dimple was in his chinand as he smiled and he smiled a gooddeal in his talk with the pretty typewriter there apxearcd a dianple tomatch in either cheek He was a manwhom the majority of women wouldhave admired while few men wouldhave hesitated to pronounce him a raregood fellow if they met him with thatsmile upon his face but the expressionchanged as the young woman vanishedthrough the door at the end of theroom and the judge straightened himself up in renewed consciousness of hisoffice his keen gray eyes betokeningno consciousness of anything amiss asI he opened his trial docket and quietlyturned the leaves unconcernedly reading as though for his own information Neil versus Meredith Bartelsand Carlton for plaintiff Criley for defendant Are you ready gentlemenDonald Bartels was stepping forwardto address the court when the clerkwho had been outloraging for freshtidings hurriedly entered whisperinga few words in his employerstels was very grave as he turhedjbackfacing thcTjudgeVvibrant with excitement I have tomove for a continuance in this caseon the ground that our client is absent and we have reason to believeis willfully and maliciously detained byparties having an interest in withholding his testimony from this suit Ihave just ascertained that Mr Neil disappeared from his room last night afterhaving ordered his horse for sevenoclock this morning with the avowedintention of making an early start tobe here before the opening of courtA man was seen going toward his cabinafter he had retired for the night butso far as can be ascertairied nothinghas been seen of Mr Neil himself sincethat hour Parties are now searchingall the Silver Trail country to get sometrace of him and he may be foundwithin the hour but pending his arrival and in view of the fact that twoof our principal witnesses are likewiseunaccountably missing I must beg fora continuance of this caseBut Mr Criley of Denver was uponhis feet on the instant excitedly protesting Your honor he cried Imust protest against any delay in trying this case as working unnecessaryhardship to my client and others concerned My client has come on fromNew York for the express purpose ofbeing present at this time He has incontemplation a trip to Europe whichcannot be delayed without involvingpossibilities of grave loss to him whileseveral of our witnesses are from a distance brought together at this timewith more or less difficulty In respectto Mr Neils disappearance while fromsome points of view it may be regardedas peculiar ah this juncture yet I venture to suggest that the gentleman wasundoubtedly cognizant of the fact thatthe case was set for this morning andif he is not here it may be certainlywithin the range of possibility thathe has reasons of bis own for absentinghimself We would most respectfullycall the attention of the court to thefact that no sufficient grounds havebeen presented for granting a continuance Talk of malicious detentionhints and innuendoes cannot be offered as valid reason for delay On ourside we are ready to proceed and onbehalf of my client I most emphaticallyprotest against the granting of any continuanceThe judge looked deliberately fromone attorney to the other absentlyplaying wTith a paper knife Did MrNeil understand that the case was setfor this morning he asked coldlyglancing at Donald BartelsHe did your honor and when heleft my office at four oclock yesterday afternoon he expressed his -intentionof being here while as beforestated his purpose was further shownin ordering his horse to be ready forhimThe judge glanced rather listlessly to-ward the clock at the side of the roomTour honor I have to move for a continuation of this caseI do not see any sufficient groundsfor a continuance he imperturbablydecided after a moment taking up thepaper knife once more and attentivelyexamining the pattern of its handleYour client was aware that the casewas set for trial this morning if hedisappeared from his room last nightit would seem that he went voluntarilyat least you have made no showing ofviolence or coercion Surmises and suggestion are not to be accepted as evidence Gentlemen we will proceedwith the caseBartels fair face flushed an angry redbut comprehending the uselessness offurther appeal he resumed his seat i 11silence Just as I told you mutteredCarlton in his ear Theyve gotBenneton their side fast enough Your onlyshow now is to kill time the best youcan and trust in Providence for Neilto show up at the eleventh hour Im going down to stir up the sheriff and seewhat he is good for if he has not gonealreadyAnd accepting his partners view ofthe ease Bartels grimly gave himselfto the task of consuming time He addressed himself to the impanelling ofa jury with a drawling hesitancy whichto the few among them who werestrangers to him fairly suggested animpediment in his speech Had he beencalled to cope with hopeless idiocy hecould npt have been more minutelypainstaking in his deliberate explanation ofMhe grounds upon whichthatsuit was brought he reiterated withtireless suavity by no possible chancecould any misunderstanding have lingered in the mind of the dullest Hewavered uncertainly in respect to hischallenges frequently he was interrupted by a small nervous cough impelling him to begin anew almost completed sentences while his questionswere put in such searching- impressivefashion that the unhappy companyseized for that form of vicarious atonement ordained by the law felt as thoughtacitly accused and in some instancesalmost convicted of unholy league withthe defendant in the case But with allhis dragging methods Mr Criley withbusiness like

disheartenedfervorNews of Neils disappearance had bythis time become noised about thestreet stirring up such excitement ashad not been known in Orodelphia formany a day That he should voluntarily

ofinterestWhy should she look so happy theelder who was something- of a belledemand She cant have anyadmirersWhy should she look so happy theyounger who spoke of Art and Missions with capitals in her voice wouldask She cant regard being secretaryto that lawyer as a noble callingAnd the wives of the boarding houseused also to puzzle over the Old Maidsjoyousness for she has no husbandthey said and at her age can hardlyhope to get oneBut I never marveled at the gentlespinsters radiant face after we had- heard the Singer not because hearingWhis voice was enough to provide hisjffffrearers with a fund of inner joy for theremainder of their days but because ofthe song he sangNow the Old Maid had lived so long inthe boarding house on the square thatit had become second nature for her tochoose the less tarnished spoons in theholder and to avoid instinctively thetop slices of bread on the bread plateShe was familiar with all varieties ofboarding house servants and she knewthat all alike despised her as the fourthfloor front She knew by heart thelandladys stories of pressing presentneed and of past affluence She hadnothing to learn in the matter of substituted eras iets and her feet weretrained to skip the torn spots in thestair carpet Altogether there was nothing in the Old Maids position in herboarding house to account for her serenityDowntown the Old Maid was a stenographer in a law office where prettiness was at a discount as a hindranceto unremitting toil She did not realizethat her chief attraction to her employers was this lack of distracting featuresand complexion Long as she had livedin the sordid but educating boardinghouse she had not learned everythingSthat was to be learned about motivesand she believed that her fathers oldfriendship with the lawyer had much todo with her positionBefore that remote day when the OldMaid first came to the law office and theboarding house she had lived in thecountry jjven yet when the springrains came down and drenched thegrim pavements she had a swift fleeting sense of late snows melting by therim of the brooks and of timid flowerspushing through the soft earth Andwhenever there was the fresh odor ofnew growing grass and new sproutingleaves in the city parks her mind turnedtoward peaceful pastoral ways and hereyes were filled with visions of billowyblossoming trees of plowmen moving across upland fields of the waking-up of life and industry Tn short theOld Maid was a poet although the crudelittle expressions of her emotions nevermet the keen eyes of critics or even thekindly eyes of her friendsWell once upon a time the Singercame to the boarding house on thesquare He was young and his audiences they were largery femininedeclared that nowhere else was there asinger who caroled out songs andsobbed out ballads so movinglyWhether or not he was peerless is aquestion but at any i ate he had madea great success and people wonderedthat he should come to the dingy abodeof the boarders and the Old Maid Somesaid that it was because he had livedthere in the days he was known to fashion and some whispered knowinglythat the lady to whom the Singer sanglived over the way in the stone housewith the balconies at the windows andthe guarding lionsat the door Be thatsis it may it is a fact that when theSinger came to the city for his series ofconcerts and recitals he sanctified theabode of the Old Maid with his presencefor a whole week Acd ihe Old Maidwas agitated mysteriously by hi presence though it is doubtful if- he evensaw her shabby little figureOne night she crept down the stairway when the house was still andslipped a paper beneath the Singersdoor sill The paper bore a set of verseswritten in the fine hand of a womanwho was educated a quarter of a century ago and a little note that readIf you should sometimes find thisworthy to sing I would be the happiestwoman on earthNow the Singer felt a brutal indifference about all happiness save hisown which had been sorely tried thatnight by the lady of his songs So hemerely muttered Confound imbecilewomen Then he looked at the versesand then he went gloomily to bed Butthrough the night as he reflected uponhis blighted hopes and the hardness ofhis fate some of the Old Maids linessang themselves through his mindIll see thee in each flower that growsThou art not lost while lives the roseNot lost while lives the rosethe foolish refrain insistedIn the morning the silly rhymeswould not be banished He found himself humming them to an air and byand by so weak was he owing to thecruel lady he sat down at the pianoand played the air softlyIt was that same week that he gavehis great concert at the hall uptownWith indifferent generosity he offeredthe landlady tickets to be distributedand so it happened that the Old Maidand I went togetherThe Old Maid was very pink and verytremulous and not being in her confidence I could not understand her stateAfter all there -was nothing in a successful singer of 33 to excite a spinsterstenographer of 50The Singer had sung grand operaarias and the music from masses Hehad sung Scotch ballads and Germanlove songs But he could not singenough to satisfy his audience Aftereach properly numbered selection hewas recalled again and again Finallyhe came out and saidI wish I could tell you the author ofthe words I am going to sing Theywere sent to me anonymously in manuscript and I have no means of givingcredit to whom it is dueThe Old Maids figure quivered Shebreathed sobbingly and drew closer tome and I wondered if she were goingcrazyThen the Singer sang the simplevreses They may have been very badtilh SlPtlSLIPPED A PAPER BENEATH THEDOORas verses but as a song they were asuccess The audience listened intently the women looking up as womenlook when lowered eyelids would letthe tears brim over And when the lastverse rang out plaintively and proudlyAnd though thou hast banished meI touch thee in each nodding flowerI see thee dear one every hourIn sky or star or seaAll beauty holds some hint of theeAnd so thou canst not banish meThou canst not banish methe hall forgot to applaud for fullythree seconds when it caught its breathand surreptitiously wiped its eyesThat is all but the Old Maid She weptquite openly turning her radiant tearstained face toward meIts mine Its mine she halfsobbed Oh its mine and I am sohappyAnd then she told me the whole storyBut neither prayers nor entreatiescould prevail upon her to let me tell hersecret And the boarders still wonderwhy it is that a colorless little lady likethe Old Maid sometimes wears a lookof pride

were tions for the sweets which flowers fa boy I did I know 1 can t aate back nisn But some well ascertained factsto the time when the men used tocradle the grain and then beat it outwith flails but I happened along in thetime of the reaping machines The selfbinder hadnt come in yet We usedto thresh the grain with one of thosehorse power separators that you couldhear two miles away when it got togrinding You know the land1 I suppose five or six teams of horses goingaround on the power and a man up onthe big cogwheel platform in the center cracking a whip over them Thatkind of a machine was a horse killerand no mistake It took about fiveminutes of digging to get started andit was hard pulling all the time Thenif the feeder happened to let a wetsheaf get in crosswise the cylinderwould stick and every horse would goup in the air You probably rememberthat when the traction engine came ineveryone said that it was the final improvement It knocked out so muchgrain that the separator had to be fedfrom both sides two hand cutters twomen to put the grain into the wagonand three or four men to stack thestraw IMd you ever work at the tailend of the machine as they used tocall it Had to wear goggles you knowChaff flying so thick that it got in yourears nose and mouth down your backsticking to you and tickling whereveryou were wet with perspiration whichwas everywhere straw piling up aroundyou and threatening to bury you unlessyou worked your way out sun about98 and no shade And yet the agricultural papers used to wonder why boysleft the farmWell when I was at Ezras I wentover with him to look at an improvedthresher I wouldnt have believed itThey dont need anyone at the tailend of the machine any more Instead of the old fashioned straw carrier with its belts and slats the improved separator is provided with ablower shaped just like a big smokestack and all the straw and chaff isforced through this by powerful fansThis blower carries all the dust andchafE away from the machine In theold days you couldnt see the machinefor a cloud of dust surrounded it Butas -I started to tell you there are nomen on the strawstack any more Thatbig blower swings around and distributes the straw making a good semicircular stack There are no men atthe other end of the machine eitherThe twine bands are cut by a patentcutter and the sheaves are carried tothe cylinder by an automatic feeder-All the menhave todbJS to pitch thesheaves up on the platform and themachine does the rest After the oatsare threshed out they are carried tothetop of the machine weighed and measured and dumped into the wagon Allthat the man at the wagon has to dois to keep the gtrain scooped awayThe way that grain comes out isa caution It takes a very few minutesto fill a wagon As a matter of factabout the only labor in threshing nowadays is the hauling to and from thejmachine You can probably remeutberthe time Miller when 1000 bushels wasconsidered a big days threshing butI understand nowadays they can knockout 3500 to 4000 bushels If they couldonly invent some device to keep grainat a good price theyd be all rightwouldnt theyIts remarkable said Miller Ididnt knowr that the

discussion in the deuce thev dont have namescover but a small portion of the groundThe fertilization is as often accomplished by insects in search of pollen asin search of honey but it is not contended that polien is given to flowers inorder to make them attractive to insects as is said of the sweet secretionsIt is believed that nectar must be ofsome direct value to the plant as wellas the pollen and the effort is to findout what is the chief office of nectar inthe life history of the flower Sincethought has been turned in this direction a new class of facts is being recordedIn California grows a lupine lupinusconf ertus which often takes exclusivepossession of large tracts of land Itdoes not yield a particle of nectar Ithas bright crimson violet flowers andthese are produced in such abundancethat the color of the mass may be noteda t long distances But it has fragranceThis is so powerful that the travelernotes it long before he meets with thegrowing plants The pollen collectinginsects visit the flower in great numbers It is believed that cross fertilization can be effected by theseintruders At any rate the fragrance would be thrown away if it wereprovided for the mere sake of advertising for insect aid as the other numerous species of lupine which have nofragrance are as freely visited by beesfor the sake of the pollen as is thisspeciesThe cross

this article the writer spoke of thegreat things to be expeetedi in- a shorttime in Alaska and went on to say thatwonderful developments were to belooked for on Stewart river andi thatthe Canadian government haic secretinformation about the river that wouldprove startlingStewart river is not an untriedstream It was worke S by Iran dr ed s ofminers before the riches of Forty Milecreek were known and the gold cannotbe picked off the bars in chunks and isnot awaiting the touch of the first comers McQuestin Harper and Mayo had astore there and did not leave until thestream was practically abandoned bymaners In my conversations withanying more than fair wages on it The vstream was followed far to its headparticularly by two men an old American trapper andi miner named Joe Geeand a Canadian Scotchman namedMcDonald The latter was very patriotic and would not desert British soiland this the3r say is why he remainedin Stewart and refused to go to FortyMile creek when the rest stampeded tothe new diggings As this man musthave spent at least eight years prospecting the stream andv so many men hadbeen in it before no virgin field is to befound there with all the richness of ElDoradoThe first application of machineryand1 steam to mining was made in thisriver The bars were known to containa fair average of gold but being veryfine the gold could not profitably bettaken out by rmen working by handSo in 1SS9 McQuestin sent the littlesteamboat Kew Racket up to Stewartwith two men Al Mayo and FrankDinsrnore in charge They ha pumpsand were to use the engine of the

tosell tthem in another quarter He hada peculiar way of managing that partof his business One of this men wouldrtell a negro for example torrun awayfrom his master and allow ihhn to sellShim to

After this for feardetection the method would be toget rid of the only witness againstthem which was the negro himselfiHe was murdered andr his body throwninto the MississippiriverThe general

outlaws it wasdifficult to obtain proof against himA young man named Stewart finallygained his confidence turned traitorand exposed the whole concern bringing home sufficient evidence againstMurrell to send him to the penitentiary for 14 jiearsIt was found that- a good many menwho bore respectable names in the sections in which they lived were connected1 with Murrells gang and every effortwas made to discredit Stewarts statements He was obliged to leave thesouthern states iiil consequenceOne of the most daring deeds of themotorious outlaw was the rebellion heincited in NewiOrleans

numbervof Indiansof both sexes and of aljL ages ua encamped1 on the bank opposite wheretheboat was discharging- They all hadaeeess to the boat and were constantlypassing to and froThe bar on the boat had been closedby the order of Charles P Chouteauthe owner of the line and no excessivedrinking was allowed They had onboard a o passenger all the way fromSt Louis a Mr dark formerly fromPhiladelphia a quiet gentlemanlymancf education who for ten or twelveyears had been living- among- theat BsntonAfter the boat had been lying- therefor several hours Mr McEenzie cameaboard with others and stepped intot cabin Just as he got abreast ofthe stove in the hall Clark came outof his stateroom one of the first in thecabSu with pistol in hand and withouta wonfc fired at McKenzie The latterfell dead shot

body of fightingIndians atod the Nellie Eogers was RevFather Be Smet for many years a missionary and manager of Catholic missions among the Indians He happenedto be on board the boat as he frequently was on expeditions of this kind Itwas decided that Clark should be disposed of for it was evident that therewas no safety for the boat while he remained on board Ponies were securedfrom the traders at Fort Peck 12 milesdistant who had come to see thesteamboat Clark with two or three otherswho were anxious to get to Fort Benton started with very tittle preparations Before the Indians had got overtheir consternation Clark whom noneof them knew personally had got beyond the reach of their fleetest horsesand through the influence of FatherDe Smet they probably never pursuedhimAmong the passengers on the NellieEogers on that day was Tom Dorrisa young man from St Louis bound forthe gold mines at Helena He was oneof Clarks companions in the Gilpinrace The riders traveresed the distance of 200 miles in three -days Thecause for the murd erof young McKenzie was never dcfinitiely ascertainedIt was believed that an old grudge existed that was to be settled in that waywhenever the parties met Nothing wasever heard of Clark afterward beyonda letter written by a gentleman livingat Findlay 0 in 188G The story heretold was published in aCincinnati paperat that time and the announcementwas made of Capt E W Goulds forthcoming book This gentleman who requested that his name be not usedwrote that he met Malcolm Clark atFort Benton dn 1862 Clark he saidwas a man to be feared but a gentleman when not angry He was marriedto a beautiful half breed girl withwhom he seemed to livequite pleasantly She had a brother named Isadorewho made his home -with Clark andhunted and traded with him In 1865Clark moved to Prickly Pear creek andlocated ranch there For-a some reason Clark became cruel and overbearing to 1iis wife After enduring it forawhile she appealed to her brother forprotection He and Clark had an altercation in which Isadore shot andkilled himOn the 3d of January 1844 the wholecity of St Louis was thrown into consternation and feverish excitement bythe report that the steamboat Shepherdess had been wrecked in Cahokiabend only three miles from the centerof the city Many lives were reported tohave been lost Several boats were immediately dispatched to the scene of thedisaster and the worst rumors werasoonwerifiedThe Shepherdess wile ascending theMississippi river on her -way from Cincinnati to St Louis struck a snag at11 oclock at night just above the mouthof Cahokia creek The night was darkand tormy The concussion was severe and several planks were torn fromthe bottom of the boat There were between 60 and 70 passengers on boardMost -of them had retired but four orfive gentlemen in the cabin were sittingaround the stove for it was cold winterweatherIn less ithan two minutes after thebeat struck the water rose to the lowerdeck where most of the passengers inthat part of the boat were asleep Thecaptain ran to the cabin occupied by thewomen and assnred them that there wasno danger Then he returned to theforecastle andis supposed to have

HIVE BEESSeme of tke Methods in General UaeAmong BeekeepersOnce the bees have clustered theoperation of getting them into the hiveis not so formidable as it would appear Like every other opera iioc

upon and to makesure of them stopping in the new abodemany beekeepers give them a com1from the parent hive containing broodand honeyAn ingenious device used by some ofour beekeepers for catching swarms isdescribed ns follows by Prairie FarmerTo make it get a forked stick bendthe forks together in the shape of ahoop and just large enough to go intoan ordinary sized coffee sack or otheropen material that will not smother thebees then fasten it to the mouth ofthe sack lBend the stick near the forkFor convenience cut the stick in twonear the fork and fasten the two partstogether again so that they can beeasily taken apart Shake the beesfrom the comb into the sack turn itover and no bees can escape Carrythem to the hive take the cover off andgently lay the sack on the top of theframes so bees can crawl out of thesack down into the hiveSome people merely place the hive onthe ground and put a wide board beforeit Then cut off the branch to whichthe swarm is clinging and bring- thewhole to the front of the hive Whenthe bees are brushed off on the boardthey will usually enter the hive prepared for them without much troubleOthers brush the bees off the branchinto a basket box

experience of growingworse all the while is proof that thetreatment is all wrong Manywho have been under treatment foryears and met with disappointment instead of benefit are willing to doubtthat there is any cure for CatarrhThe trouble is that all of the treatment they have received has been misdirected and has not touched theirtrouble Catarrh is a stubborn deepseated blood disease and everybodyshould know that to simply treat thesurface that is the local irritationdoes not reach the disease A bloodremedy is needed but it must be a goodone a remedy which goes down to thevery bottom

and washes and differentinhaling remedies in fact I could feelthat each winter I was worse than theyear previousFinally it was brought to my noticethat Catarrh was a blood disease andafter thinking

of letters of his time but he is rememberedchiefly as a humorist who could enlivena dinner table with his wit Like otherwise men who have a talent for makingpeople laugh he was jealous of hisreputation for good senseWhen he reprinted his essays fromthe Edinburgh Review his objecten in his ownt words was to show ifI could that I had not passed my lifemerely in making jokes but that I hadmade use of whatever little powers ofpleasantry I might be endowed with todiscountenance bad and to encourageliberal and wise principles In thisoujecc ne ianea ixis puuiic services anu iwisdom have been forgotten His jokes jare rememberedHis account of Dame Partington wholived upon the beach at Sidmouth andwho was seen during a violent stormtrundling her mop squeezing out thesea water and vigorously pushing awaythe Atlantic ocean is a household storywhich every one knows The circumstances in which it was told and theeffect produced by it have passed out ofmindIt was at the end of a long agitationfor political reform in England whenthe house of lords had thrown out thegreat measure of Lord John Russellwhich had been carried through thecommons Sydney Smith the politicalparson who had been advocating Liberal principles and reform measures formany years told this story at a political meeting in Taunton at whichspeeches were made protesting againstthe action of the lords It caught thepublic fancy and within a week everybody in England was laughing over itMrs Partingtons mop battle with thetempest tossed Atlantic portrayed thelords futile struggle with English public opinion That funny story was probably more effective than the most eloquent argument in disarming mobspreventing a breach of the peace andconverting hostility to the lords intogood natured contempt The Atlanticocean beat Mrs PartingtonDuring the 60 years nichiprecededthe Victorian -reign Sydney Smith waSjaimosu me oniy prominenp jngiisnclergyman who was interested in reform movements and in his writingsfor the Edinburgh Review he succeededby his wit in presenting the dullest argument with freshnessgujp force Witwith him was the vehicle which carriedgood sense and wisdom He has been inhis grave 60 years and his reputation isthat of a clerical jokerHe expected that a tablet would beerected to his memory in St Pauls cathedral London where as canon hewas a favorite preacher at the close ofhis life There i3 no memorial tabletthere nor is there one at either Fostoni or Combe Florey the two parishesI where most of his work was done Hisjokes have survived not only his writings but his services as a reformer wholoved religious toleration and politicalliberty as the breath of his lifeWhat his career proves is that wit isone of the most powerful weapons inthe world Without it he would haveexerted very much less influence as awriter or a preacher in politics Withit his name has been handed down asone of the great Englishmen of histimeRanch LifeIt is so difficult to imagine a youngAmerican voluntarily choosing a ranchas a start in life that it is hardly worthwhile trying to do so As a rule heeither thinks of the country as the placewhere market vegetables come fromand Thanksgiving turkeys are raisedor else it represents to him a large andexpensive establishment at Lakewoodor some such place with a casino andbowling alley and polo team attachedAnd as for the most part the Americandoes not play polo nor hunt nor shootnor fish with any real genuine enthusiasm the latter view he takes isscarcely more alluring than the formerDown deep in his heart he knows thathe would much rather be trying to runan electric railway or a bank or building bridges or losing money in Wallstreet than to be doing any of thosethings But the young Englishman isentirely different He has always knownand enjoyed outdoor sports It is thelife he likes best and he imagines thatranch life is first and foremost a sporting life Abbe Carter Goodloe in ScribnersA Business WomanMrs Emma
