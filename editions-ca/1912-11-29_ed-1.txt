Somefew, of course, make the burden heavier on the other members of the race.However, the depredations are thework of imported negroes.The wrecking of the Louisville randNashville passenger train nearParis,the murder of Deputy Sheriff Hart atWinchester, the firing upon a railroademploye near this city, by a desperateblack, and a number of other murder,shooting and cutting scrapes can besafely laid atthe doors of the imported negroes.Who is responsible for such conditions? Who is to blame for floodinggoodc ommunities with such objectionable characters? None other thanrailroad contractors, who gather together gangs for railroad labor.The negroes are the most desperateof their race. In most cases they arefugitives from justice, guilty of almosteverv conceivable offence murder,rape, arson driven from their homesbecause of some heinous crime, theyhave committed, they escape theclutches of the law, move to new localities,break the law and'again are compelled to vacate to thwart the arm ofjustice.Such classes of negroes are a menace to their own race, to the publicsafety and good. Their unlawful actsare bad examples to set before the lawabiding negroes. with the approachof cold weather, and . the scarcity ofwork, they must resort to somethingto gain a livelihood. Thetts and murder may be the result, but how arethev to be prevented?The policeof Paris have made everyeffort to put a stop to the practices ofthe negroes, who spend most of theirtime in town when not working. Manycarry concealed weapons, and wouldnot hesitate to tae a human life toaccomplish their purpose. 1 There mustbe some measures adopted to rid thecommunity of the "bad" men, anddone before it is too late, and before agood life pavs the forfeit.-' Anoiher serious objection that couldbe revised is the lower element of negroes who make Paris their permanenthomes, Vagrants, both male and female, are to be seen every day. Complaints are numerous that housekeepers are unable to secure negro laborj for housework. Ihere should be aremedv for this a jail sentence doesno good, and the workhouse has butlittle effect. Something should bedone to relieve the condition even ifextreme measures have to be resortedto.m JgrkHlttral Bank o( Paris.Children's Right of Liberty.Do not forget that every child hasa right to some leisure and some freedom from observation. It is possibleto be too watchful. If children aretaught to drink after food and notwith it, as a normal thing they will doit naturally, and suffer less from digestive troubles than if they drink frequently during a meal.Stay at Home Vote.That there was a big stay at homevote in the recent presidential electionin Kentucky is evidenced by the official figures as given out from Frank-lort.The vote cast for Wilson was smaller by 24,598 than the vote lecorded forBryan in 1908, and the combined voteof Taft and Roosevelt was smaller by17,433 than Taft's yote of four yearsago. This a loss of 42,021 from theaggregate Democratic and Republicanvote. Viewed in connection withthe natural increase in the number ofvoters during the four year period itshows clearly that a great number ofKentucky voters did not take the trouble to vote.It is easily seen that the Democratssuffered most by reason of this stay athome vote. In Jefferson county alonethe Democratic vote fell off over twohousand as compared with the Bryanvote of four years ago. while the combined Taft and Roosevelt vote was only 155 below the Taft vote of fouryears ago. The tremendous Democratic plurality of 104.072 over the tTaf telectors in the State dwindles to a majority of 1,032 "overthe combined voteof the Taft and Roosevelt electoraltickets. There is a falling off of morethan 7,000 in the Democratic presidential vote in 1912 as compared with theDemocratic gubernatorial vote in 1911.On the contrary the combined Taftand Roosevelt presidential vote is larger bv nearly 23,000 than the Republian gubernatorial vote in 1911.The Socialist party increased itstotal vote from 4.060 in H08 tj 11,674.Assuming that all this increase samefrom the old parties there remainmany thousands of voters who failedto work up enough enthusiasm in therecent campaigns to go to the polls.SE!HAH AM3 "PHEDr. R.

The dignified statement will increase the respect won by Mr. Camden by the conduct of the campaign of 1912. Whenthe friends of Mr. Camden desire tosuggest his name for any office in thefuture they can rest their argument onthe services rendered in 1911 and in1912.In this regeneration of the Democratic party other men have had anactive and honoraole part. The Kentucky delegation in Congress have hada part in the national success of theparty, and the State Administration,the late Legislature and the managersof the campaign have pursued a wise,sagacious and successful course.Much remains to do. The Democratic Darty can remain in power only bycontinued services in promoting thosepolicies, city, State and National, towhich the party has pledged itselt.In this direction Mr. Camden hasdone much to awaken a proper Dartyspirit; a spirit of loyalty and devotion;a spirit that serves instead of plunders. It is difficult, as the recordsshow, to make the average voter understand that he should support theparty rather than look to the party forpersonal support. Mr. Camden has setan example which should have itseffect throughout the State. If otherDemocrats will follow the example of iMr. Camden the Democratic partywill soon resume its former commanding position.THE BESTNo Clinkers. 1 per cent ash.Lots of Heat.k Denton9CSD5XSJsCfer:lXgeccS SBa ICI Tilt SC A Il fWf ET OlH ilr i AltrlrKFulfilment.He (in a restaurant with his bestgirl) You don't know how happy youhave made me by saying "Yes," darling.
