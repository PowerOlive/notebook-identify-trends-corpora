theAmerican lines and looked directlydown on both Caney and SantiagoCaney now seems to hold onty about500 Spanish troops the number reported by the Cuban scouts in spite ofthe belief of the Americans first herethat the 3000 Spaniards driven forward by our advance on Baiquiri andJuragua had all retreated on Caneyand not to Santiago The small number of troops now at Caney indicatesthat the Spaniards have practicallyevacuated the place and this is believed to be the case Lieut Standing was not molested during hisobservation though he passedthrough a camp which 24 hourspreviously had been occupied by astrong Spanish outpost Corporal Huchtof Company D 7th United States infantry who with seven men was sent onoutpost two miles from Santiagode Cuba Wednesday morning and whowas forgotten until the

put an end to the matterby saying No let them get intoSantiago and then we will knowwhere we have got themThe Spaniards are falling baek uponSantiago and it is believed that theywill make a determined

beyond a single scratch suchas a man might make with his thumbnailThat was the end of the mights business Soon after with a drinkall roundwe lay down to sleep and the outsideof Silvers vengeance was to put GeorgeMerry up for sentinel and threatenhim with death if he should prove unfaithfulIt was long ere I could close an eyeand Heaven knows Ihad matter enoughfor thought in the man whom I hadslain that afternoon in my own mostperilous position and above all in theremarkable game that I saw Silvernow engaged upon keeping the mutineers together with one hand andgrasping with the other after everymeans possible and impossible tomake his peace and save his miserablelife He himself slept peacefully andsnored aloud yet my heart was sorefor him wicked as he was to think onthe dark perils that environed and theshameful gibbet that awaited himCHAPTER XXXON PAROLEI was wakened indeed we were allwakened for I could see even the sentinel shake himself together from wherehe had fallen against the doorpost bya clear hearty voice hailing us from themargin of the wcodtBlock house ahoy it cried Heresthe doctorAnd the doctor it was Although Iwas glad to hear the sound yet mygladness was not without admixtureI remembered with confusion my insubordinate and stealthy conduct andwhen I saw where it had brought meamong what companions and surrounded by what dangers I felt ashamed tolook him in the faceHe must have risen in the dark forthe day had hardly come and when Iran to a loop hole and looked out I sawhim standing like Silver once beforeup to the mid leg in creeping vaporYou doctor

he said at last dutyfirst and pleasure afterward as youmight have said yourelf Silver Letus overhaul these patients of yoursA moment afterward he had enteredthe block house and with one grimnod to me proceeded with his workamong the sick He seemed to me under no apprehension though he musthave known that his life among thesetreacherous demons depended oil a hairand he rattled on to his patients as ifhe were paying an ordinary professional visit in a quiet English familyHis manner I suppose reacted on themen for they behaved to him as ifnothing occurred as if he were stillships doctor and they

confidencein his discretion his bravery and hisenergy The attack Friday severaldays before the public mind expectedthe battle is a tribute to his energyas well as to his judgment accordingto the present lights for he undoubtedly found it necessary to crush thefoe in detail following Napoleonsfavorite maxim instead of alio winthem to consolidate and outnumberhimGen Miles was of the opinion thatthe action of Friday was in the natureof a heavy skirmish ail along theAmerican front particularly on theright and that its main purpose wasto develop the strength of the enemyand if possible learn the vulnerablepoint along the Spanish front - ihishowever was based only on thelack of definite information and Genj Miles felt that any hour might bringword of a general engagement Brio-Gen

it by a series oZexperiments recently carried out byProfessor Plateau of the University ofGhent Professor Plateau has arrived atthe ccuclusion that insects are indifferent to the colors of the flowers theyvisit and that they are guided to themin a very subordinate way by sightThe experiments on wh4oh the Belgianprofessor bases his farreaching conclusions are briefly these Having coveredthe brightly colored flowers of singledahlias in his garden with bits of greenleaf he found that they were still visited by insects This seemed so much atvariance with the generally receivedview that insects are attracted to flow-time to join the Elks Short speeches i ers chiefly by their color that ProfessorPlateau institutedwere made by Col Melishdard Johnson and ColGaines after the luncheonCol StodLoving Ba prolonged series ofexperiments aud observations to put thematter still further to the proof Theresult has been to oonfirm and strengthen the conclusions drawn from the firstexperiments Cutting off the brightlycolored corollas of such flowers as lobelia evening primrose foxglove etcbe fonnd the remaining green partswere still visited Again there are somebrightly colored flowers which are seldom or never visited by insects owingto their lack of honey Notable amongthese is the scarlet geranium of our garden But when a little honey was placedon geranium flowers bees came to themat once those blossoms which had notreceived honey being passed overOther conspicuous flowers were triedin a similar way with like results Theexperiment of removing the honey bearing parts of a flower and leaving thebrightly colored part which was supposed to be attractive was also triedwith the single dahlia Its inner floretswere removed leaving the conspicuousouter ones a piece of yellow leaf beingplaced i the center No insects wentto these honeyless flowers But as soonas a drop of nectar was placed on thenithey visited them as freely as beforeAgain Professor Plateau made artificialflowers with pieces of green leaf eaehfurnished with a little honey Thesewere freely visited by insects But artificial flowers made of colored materialwere neglected even when suppliedwith honeyIn further support of his views Professor Plateau is able to bring forwardthe following facts as to the habits ofinsects in visiting flowers They willpass freely and with apparent indifference from one color to another of varieties of the same species growing together in our gardens they visit a greatnumber of green and greenish coloredfjbwere there are many small and inconspicuous flowers which are also freely visited Such is a brief outline ofProfessor Plateaus observations And experiments from which he believes himself justified in drawing the conclusionthat sight plays a very subordinate partin attracting insects to flowers Theirbearing on the theory of the insect originof flowers is obvious London TimesThe Old Man Wm CaredTalk about curing people of badhabits one of the funniest cases I everknew occurred on the south side someyears ago said Detective Thomas MoQuaide There wan an old fellow overthere who would insist on fussing withhis wife who would invariably givehim the worst of it Then he would runup stains and hang out of the secondstory window holding to the ledgeshouting like wildfire that he was goingto drop and kill himself Of course thewife would relent and set up a noisethat would bring out the neighbors forblocks and the man would be pulledin the window by friendsThis got to becoming too frequentlyand some pf the boys who lived nearand who had loosened several joints intheir spines at different times pullinghim in decided to stop it One fine dayit came again The old fellow hung outof the window shouting that he wouldsurely jump and end it all the wifecame rushing into the street in hystericsand the neighbors ran as before to pullhim up The first man who got therehit the mans fingers with a stick making him loosen bis hold and to thehorror of all he dropped to the hardpavement with a howl that was pitifulHe was not badly hurt but it curedhim of that bad habit Pittsburg DispatchQueen Wilhelminas OathThe coronation of the young queen ofHolland will take place

therewas about No 16 his heavy solidlybuilt engine or about the big sleekgrass fed steers that generally formedthe greater part of the load on thetrains that he pulled He was considered one of the most faithful men onthe Denver road but somehow his verjfaithfulness was of a kind which isgenerally associated with dullness Inmany respects his character was strikingly like that of the road on which heran The Denver is a long monotonousroad that stretches up into the Panhandle of Texas over almost endlessreaches of seemingly dead level prairiebut all the time is gradually rising toward the lava beds of the foothills ofNew Mexico and eventually finds itsway across the mountains and into thecity of Denver In much the same waythere was a kind of monotony aboutDan Russell but it was a monotony ofvastness It rose by imperceptiblegradations to the heights of heroismand it is barely possible that in the endit also may have found its way intosome continuing cityDan never achieved even the distinction of being given a passenger run Inspite of his faithfulness men of a different turn of mind always seemedto get the promotions Den Stikcs hisfireman was a much younger man andmuch less experienced in railroad matters but it was frequently remarkedamong their friends that Ben was already better liked in official circles thanDan and that the fireman was likely toget a passenger run firstThere was a certain town on Dansrun known as the Chicken and Breadtown It was so called because of theswarm of semicivilized and totally depraved small boys who always mettrains there and tried to beguile passengers into buying alleged samples ofthose two articles of diet The town isstill known by this name from one endof the Denver to the other It is-hardlyworth while to mention its othername as this one really lends all thedignity to the town which the facts inthe case will justify The town consists principally of sand hills and saloons but as it f at the junction of

whom Dan Russell loved cannothave been all bad How Dan managedto become engaged to her or even tojnake love to her I cannotjiretend tosay How he managed it even his mostintimate friends never could imagineIt is a matter oT record though that abrakeman once punched him in the ribsand asked him what the date was andthat Dan blushed violently and stammered something about promotionEverything weut well with the affairuntil the unfortunate day when BenStikes was transferred to a seat in thecab of No 10 and to the position offireman to Dan Russell Before thishappened Grace made it a point to meetDans train nearly every time it passedthrough the Chicken and Breadtown but afterward she alwaysmet itSomethin new under the sun remarked ore of the habitual louncrersaround the depot oue day justaf ter No1G had pulled outWhat is it inquired anotherGrace StikesYes Well she is tolhU new Sheaint met No 1G but about 40 limes thislaf monthShe aint never met it on the rightside of the cab before Did you noticeit She allers stood on the left sidetill to dayAt this there were several significantgrins in the crowd and several shoulders wore shrugged After several moments of silence spent in looking afterthe disappearing train one of the loafers remarked sententiouslyD n good looking man any wayEven Dan Russells most ardentfriend could never have claimed thatthis imprecation was intended for himAfter this the loafers noticed thatGrace stood on one side of the cab justabout as often as she did on the otherIt is barely possible that Dan may havenoticed it also but there was never anything about his swarthy firm set faceto show it As the months went on hisfireman continued to be as good lookring as ever -and showed no sin of anyf In rinjury from the damning he had received Finally a time came whenGrace failed to stand on either side ofXo 16 or to meet it at all for over aweek Neither man in the cab showedthe slightest sign of missing- herSomethings up the loungers whispered one to another but no one hadan opinion to venture as to what thatsomethin might benOne evening as Pains train wasstanding on a side track waiting forthe south bound passenger to pass JimAtkins a long lazy boy of about 18 abrother of Graces shambled up to thecab and said in a voice too low for theloungers to overhearSay Dan Grace sez she want tersee you jest a minuteAll right said Dan with somethingin his voice as near like eagerness as hewas ever known to come Whereabouts is sheIn the little room jest back of thasloon Dans countenance fell at thelast wordYou know what the rules of the Denver is bout their men goin into sloonswhile on duty faltered DanShucks ejaculated Jim contemptuously A man that aint gotsand enough to take a little risk to getto see his gal aint much good Gracesaid tell you she aint well nohowNot well interrupted Ben Stikesbriskly Dan you just stay here anIll go an see ifNaw you wont exclaimed Danhurriedly as he jumped down from thecab Im goin myselfThis was the nearest that Dan wasever known to come toward displajingany resentment toward Ben As hestrode away one of his brakemen camehurrying after himSay Dan he queried anxiouslyyou aint

that saloon hed fire you shoreDan muttered some confused repl3but still kept on toward the saloon Itwas nearly dark now and when heopened the door the big coal oil lamphanging behind the bar had been lighted Passing through without stoppinghe hurried iuto the room behind Therehe remained for about five minutes inconversation vtith Grace Just whatpassed between them nobody knowsbut when Dan reappeared in the saloonit was noticed that a broad smile was onhis faceMade up did you Dan Glad to hearit said big Bill the proprietorof the saloon as he whajeked Dan in theribs good naturedly with his ponderousfistDan said nothing but nodded mysteriouslyThen he hurried to the front door inso much confusion that he collided atfull tilt with a man -who had just enteredWhy dont you run over a fellowexclaimed the newcomer rather roughly Then stepping back he took a goodlook at the offenderGreat Scott If it aint Dan RussellYou are the last man on the Denver Idever have expected to see in here Andin such a fix tooIt was the Old Man There is noneed to give his name or his official station He was Dans superior officer inrailroad circles and that settled thematter Dan hung his headland

Man who was not so veryold after all bowed rather dapA young lady sent me a note requesting me to call I suppose it wason business of some kind It was MissAtkins your daughter I presumeThat night Grace had a stormy interview with her father The more hestormed the more she wept Ifhad allbeer intended for a joke She had sentfor the Old Man just to tease Danand to make him a little jealous Shehad never once thought any harm couldcome of it So she protested betweenher sobs But her father only reiteratedwith a lion like roar that although heknew she was one of the blankedestfools in Texas he knew very well shehad never been such a fool as thatOf course Dan was not dischargedthat distinction is reserved for higherofficers in railroad circles Engineersmerely et fired and ihat was whathappened to Dan If he had been a manof another kind he might have workedthe proper wires and got off with only ashort lay off Even if he himself hadbegged hard enough matters mighthave been compromised As it was hemerely gave up his place without saying a word Nobody was surprised tolearn that Ben Stikes had been promoted to Dans place at the throttle ofNo 1G In a few days Dan began quietly to look about for another job Hesoon obtained a place under the sectionforeman of a section only a few milesfrom the Chicken and Bread town Asthe foreman was a married man he andhis family

village of Towton near York there is an exceedinglyinteresfiug and curious old churchknow n as the Lead Hall chapel It is remarkable for several reasons chieflybecause of its age its small size probably it would not seat 20 people altogether its main fittings and lastly because of its curious choirTo understand about this choir it isnecessary to review a little o the history of this famous old place of worship There arc two theories ns to itsorigin It is imost commonly believedthat this chapel is the one known tohave been built by Richard III in 3461It is claimed that the yearly servicesnow takiug place in it are a survival ofthose that were formerly ordered forthe purpose of praying for the soulsiofthe good Christians who fell in the greatbattle Another supposition declaresthis chapel to be attached to the oldmanor house of the Tyas family at LeadHall and that the memorial chapel ofRichard III has long since disappearedIt is obvious however that if thiswera the case a service every sixmonths would not greatly edify the people in their spiritual lifeHaving thus explained the chapelshistory we may go to the choir Thereare two services yearly held at the LeadHali church one in April and anotherin October There is therefore no regular body of choristers but on such occasions a choir is made up from thechief singcrsin the neighboring townswho are under the control for hispurpose of a well known musical professorin Yorkshire The majority of the menand boys who make up the choir aredrawn from York and Leeds They receive a stated fee for their days servicesand are provided with refreshmentsThe regulir service of the Church ofEngland is used The congregation atthese services often does not exceed halfa dozen people or half the size of thechoir The vicar of a neighboringparish conducts the servicesThose who maintain the theory of thechapels origin in the time of RichardHI declare that the king made a grantof money for the holding of memorialservices anil that it is for this reasonthat two services a year arc regularlyheld Sunday ReaderAn Upto Date PrincePrincess Laetitia dowager uuchessi ofAosta is one of the most cheeinul

feet high with fourplates at the top to hold the posts inposition and keep them plumb Theroof was placed in position before theposts were set up having the corners atthe eave ends of the roof set so as topermit the roof to slide up or down onor between the posts Holes were boredin the posts to put in pins to hold theroof up When it is time to beginstacking fasten the roof at the top ofthe posts and begin the stack betweenthe posts Build to a finish or in casethere is not enough hay cut put inwhat there is stopping work on thestack for any length of time take outthe pins and lower the roof

Very Little Protein and IsDeficient in Rone FormingConstituents- Prof Snyder of the Minnesota experiment station has recently made achemical analysis of flourine the byypoduct of the glucose mills that is nowbeing used as an adulterant of wheatflour His report which appears in theNorthwestern Miller is not in accordwith the claims which have been madefor this product especially in the important feature of nutritive value Analysis shows the flourine contains so little protein that a man would have to eat350 pounds of it in order to get enoughprotein to enable him to do a days workIt is deficient in bone forming constituents and fat as well and in fact containslittle of food value except starch Butstill worse it contains sulphate of sodaand sulphuric acid enough to make itinjurious to health Is it any wonder thatEuropean consumers of American flourare regarding it with suspicion whenthere is possibility of it containing sucha worthless- and worse than worthlesssubstance Is it strange that European governments which rejresentpeople who dare not waste a penny evenfor bread are on the alert to protecttheir people against such an impositionns flour adulterated with

young breeder to be successful isto buy the blood and the balance wouldtake care of itself We might just aswell expect a good crop of corn if weplant an excellent variety in a well-preparedrich soil and then not give itany further attention as to supposethat our pigs will develop into fine hogsno matter how well bred without theproper food and attention In fact thework of making the fine hog is only liegun at weaning time so says Jamesltile3r in American Swineherd It- isvery important to have the pig wellbred as that is the foundation and likebuilding a house it is important tohave a good foundation Then by usinggood material and skill in architecturewe build a good substantial house sowith the pig We want it well bred asa foundation then by the proper method of feeding we develop it into a finehog Xo young breeder will ever succeed in the business unless he makes astudy of the proper method of feedingpigs as feed is the principal factor mthe improvement of swine It is wellknown that by grading seed wheat andseed corn and planting the largest andbest developed grains the grain will beimproved from year to year so withthe pig By feeding the pig a well-balancedration a ration that will build upall the different- parts of the hog especially the valuable parts the loin andham the muscular or lean The pigsthus fed till they arrive at the properage to breed will transmit their goodqualities to their offspring and like thelarge grains of corn or wheat the improvement will go on from generationto generation Pigs should be fed a varietj of feeds The best feed for youngpigs is shorts mixed with skimmedmilk fed sweet or ground wheat orground oats with the hulls sieved outOat hulls are not good for pigs butthere is nothing better than groundoats with the hulls extracted mixedwith sweet milk This with a littlecorn will make a good balanced ration feed them regular and enoughto keep them rapidly growing The pigshould never stop growing Our bestimproved pigs should gain

can afford to pay more for a cowthat will make 300 pounds of butterthan you can for one making 20Cpounds In fact under ordinary conditions the former will make enoughbutter to give a profit on her keep andthe latter will require more expendedon her than she gives in return Toall who are interested in the dairy atall whether it be few or many cowsthe only way to improve your herd andbe reasonably sure that you will getwhat you are after is to select carefully weed out and breed and raise aherd This can be done bjr using agocdmale from well known milk and butterstrains upon your best
