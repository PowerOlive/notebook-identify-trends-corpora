Howe at the Paris Grand, October 1st.These productions of the shy, timid,and wary creatures were .secured onlyby exercising infinite patience and extraordinary skill and resourcefulness.The mother bird's solicitude for" thewelfare of her young, and the absoluteconfidence of the latter are shown witha fidelity and naturaless that are mostappealing.- Weeks of patient. waitingwere necessary to familiarize the anxious mother bird with the Camera before her natural distrust of human intrusion -could be overcome. Anotherdistrict photographic triumph of thisfilm is tliat'' which "caught" the kingrfisher at the moment of diving for afish, capturing it, and then enjoyinghis repast though with considerableeffort. Then there are brightly huedwood-peckers "at home" looking askance out of an tree trunk, the fascinating shrike, the astute -magpie "a singing lesson" with young "crowns aspupils, young duckling; gracefulswans and a heron in fight.
