, H. C. L. IN AFRICA.
In 1914 a bag of rice in Africa
cost ?3.84. To-day it costs ?18.
At that time a bag of salt sold for
30 cents. Now one must pay 96
cents per pound if he wishes to salt
his potatoes. Before the war a tin
of kerosene sold for $1.50. If the
lights are to be kept burning now
after the war the oil will cost $5.04
per tin. Not all of the natives
wear shirts. The missionaries often
do. In 1914, a shirt could be bought
in Africa for 46 cents. Now the
price has risen to $2.40. One pair
of khaki trousers at that time
punched a dollar and thirty-two
cent hole in the five dollar bill. Now
U will punch out of the bill one
dollar and ninety-two cents. You
could have bought one of each of
the articles six years ago for $7.42.
Now it would take $28.32. The
missionaries in Africa and the other
countries to which they have gone
to preach the gospel of Jesus
Christ to the people have to live
against the H. C. L. as well as we
here. Their salaries must be raised
if they are to live. The Southern
Presbyterian Church in its Progres
sive Campaign is hoping to
sionary work even against the pres
ent high prices of things. The First
Presbyterian Church of Paris plans
to do its bit on Sunday next when it
makes the canvass for raising the
local budget.
Rev. W. E. Ellis, pastor will
preach at both services Sunday at
the Christian church. At the morn
ing service, at 10:45 he will preach
on "Hosannah To The Prince of
Peace," and at the evening service
at 7:30 o'clock, on "Know Thy
self." The revival at the Paris Metho
dist church, which began last Sun
day, continues to grow m interest
with each day. Rev. C. H. Greer,
the pastor, is doing the preaching, j
His sermons are forceful, practical

and full of inspiration for his hear

at 7:30 o'clock. The musical ser
vices are in charge of a competent
choir, and is a pleasing feature of
the meeting. A cordial invitation
is extended to everyone to attend
the services.
At the business session of the
Woman's Society of the Christian
church, held Tuesday in the church
parlors, the following officers were
elected: President, Mrs. J. T.

Mrs. Ed. T. Hinton; Third
