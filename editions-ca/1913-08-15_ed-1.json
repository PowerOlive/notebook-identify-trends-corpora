vin to Mr. Berry Elam was quietly

JOHN S. RHEA ACCEPTS
APPOINTMENT AS JUDGE
Former Congressman John S. Rhea,
of Russellville, has accepted the ap
pointment as Judge of the Seventh
district to succeed W. P. Sandidge, re
signed. J. C. Browder, also 'of Russ
ellville, and Representative J. W. For
gy, of Elkton, and John J. Milliken, of
Franklin, were candidates.
The appointment of Mr. Rhea to the
bench makes a change in the Third
Congressional district situation. Mr.
Rhea was expected to enter for the
nomination again against Congress
man Thomas, but this appointment
eliminates him as a factor in that
race. Thomas Thomas, of Bowling
Green, is now said to be the most like
ly candidate" in opposition to Congress
man Thomas in the primary next
year, if any opposition at all is offered
,to his renomination.

STOCK ID FARM NOTES
Foreign buyers purchased most
all of the mules offered on the market
at Greensburg Monday. The condi
tion of the crops has created such un
easiness among the farmers that they
seem willing to dispose of all their
surplus stock.
A very heavy movement of live
stock from Nicholas county has set in
toward the river markets. Many
Nicholas county formers say they are
without water for their stock, and
with the prospects for little or no feed
they are selling off all the surplus
stock.
The Directors of the Kentucky
Asociation at a meeting at Lexington
Tuesday morning, voted that an ag
gregate of $21,000 be added to the
purses to be given during the nipne
days of the fall meeting at Lexing
ton, beginning Sept. 11. This is an in
crease of approximately $350 per day
in the added money.
One ofJ;he biggest sales of fat cat
tle made for some time was consum
mated when J. H. Baughman, of Stan
ford, sold to Monte Fox for the New
York market a bunch of sixty-eight
head at 8 cents. The cattle were fed
on grass, and weighed at the time of
delivery 1,402 pounds, each.
Offers of $15 per hundred are now
being made on every hand in Nicholas
county, but the tobacco growers are
holding off on the present prospect
for a short crop. They say that every
day of the drouth is cutting the crop
shorter and making 'the early tobacco
more valuable.
The drouth, which has practically
ruined the corn crop in many sections,
has caused an overwhelming demand
on the Department of Agriculture at
Fankrfort for silo building assistance.
Two men are in the field superintend
ing the work of erection for afrmers,
I but Commissioner Newman said that
he could keep 100 men busy if all the
requests that have reached him in the
last week should be granted this sum
mer. The corn in many counties
amounts to nothing more than short
fodder, with some nubbins. The pas
ure is burned up and the farmers now
want to convert the whole stock into
silage.
NEW RATES FOR
TOBACCO HOUSES.
The State Insurance Rating Board
sent out notices Tuesday to the insu
rance companies of the new basic
rates for tobacco insurance to go into
effect today. The companies have
thirty days in which to protest the
rates. The board estimates hat the
new rates will effect a reduction of 40
to 46 per cent, on brick loose leaf
warehouses, and 23 to 33 per cent, on
the contents; 15 to 27 per cent, on
frame loose leaf warehouses and 15 to
21 per cent, on the contents. The
schedule does not include rates on to
bacco factories.
A SURE CURE GUARANTEE.
If your fowls have cholera, roup,
limberneck, white diarrhea, or black
head, use Laughlin's Cholera Cure and
if it don't cure I will refund ' your
money.

NERVE SAVED HER LIFE.
An Englishman in traveling through -Ceylon
was the guest of a, dockyard
official at Trincomalie. "The dinner
was excellent, but when it was about
half over I was startled by hearing the
wife of my host tell the native serv
ant to place a bowl of milk ona deer
skin near her chair.
"Although she spoke as calmly as if
giving an ordinary order, I knew at
once that there was a snake some
where in the room, for they prefer
milk to anything else. As a hasty
movement might have meant certain
death, we all sat like statutes; but,
for all that, my eyes were inspecting
every nook and corner with a peep
under the table.
"However, it was not until the milk
was placed on the deerskin that the
snake appeared. And then, to our
amazement a large cobra uncoiled it
self from the hostess' ankle and glid
ed toward the bowl when, of course, it
was immediately killed.
"But just fancy the nerve of the
woman, though she fainted when the '
thing lay dead on the floor. How
many could have remained motionless
under such circumstances?"

FORCING PLANTS TO
ABSORB MORE IRON
Officials of the agricultural experi
ment station in Vienna, Austria, are
conducting experiments with a view
to increase, if possible, the amount of
iron absorbed by certain plants, for
the purpose of ascertaining the effect
on the human body when these plants
are used as food.
As artificially prepared fods con
taining iron do not always produce
the desired effect, because the iron is
not completely used by the digestive
organs. It is to be hoped that this
difficulty may be overcome by forcing
plants to take up a larger quantity of
iron during .their growth.
The experimenters have already
succeeded in growing spinach con
taining approximately seven times
more iron than is found in ordinary
spinach, by adding hydrate of iron to
the soil, and ic is believed that the
process may be successfully used with
other plants of the same class.
