THE DESTRUCTION OE
CITY STREETS
THE
Religion and the oath are two of
the most sacred things to the moan
tain men and women and their re
gard for them is one of then great
est virtues, in the opinion of Judgo
W. T. Davis, who for eleven yearK
has presided over the Circuit
Courts of Harlanand Bell counties.
"A few years ago," said Judge Da
vis by way of illustration, "a moun
tain woman cajme to my office in
Pineville and accused her husband
of associating with other women
and doing a number of thinga that
were wrong. The man was brought
in and they were given a chance to
talk things over. The man denied
the charges. Then the woman ap
plied the test of the oath. She told
him that if he would swear before
the Clerk of the Circuit Court that
none of the things was true she
would believe him. He took the
oath and they left the omcc recon
ciled. This is but a sample of their
regard tor the oath. The vvoiaan
believed that if her husband was
willing to swear that he was inno
cent his asseitions were true."

Kentucky coal will be sent abroad

R. E. Howe, of Middlesboro, who

The constant destruction nf Uio
streets of Pans by heavy trucks
creates a pioblem which" the city
must face. If the city has not the
power to protect the streets against
this misuse and abuse, it must get
that power. It is the holip.r nf ttth'
'NEWS that thera is a nower inhcr-
enti a any municipal organization,
whether or not it is expressly defin
ed in the charter and -the statutes, to
protect public property against
destruction by any user.
"We limit the" rights of citizens to
dig up the streets for the pm-pose
of making water or gas connections.
We allow this only under "certain
conditions and certain restrictions,
but the big trucks, running over our
streets, directly do more damage in
a few hours than a man with a pick
and shovel would do if he started
deliberately to dig into the streets
for the same lensrfh nf tlmp Tt
only a common sense proposition
that propei ty that has been creatPfl
by the taxes of all the people may
not be destroyed or used wastefullv
by an individual taxpayer, who
contributes only a fraction of the
amount to the payment of the total
charge.
It is the belief of THE NEWS
that the city authorities would be
justified in absolutely prohibiting
the use of our streets to the heavy
traffic, that, in particular, that has
been going over them in the past
few weeks, and that whatever hair
splitting litigation that might be
engaged in, the city would, in the
long run, win the litigation or, at
least, would not suffer (material loss
through claims for damages. The
legal authorities, however, seem to
doubt the power of the city to nro-
tect itself in this manner.
If we haven't the power now, we
must get it at the first session of the
Legislature. It is a ridiculous ab
surdity that the people of the city
should vote bond issues and should
tax themselves generously to build
new streets and. to repair old ones,
and to have those streets destroyed
almost as rapidly as they arc built.
