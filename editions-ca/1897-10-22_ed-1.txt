directions The quarantine system is still in effect but itr does not seem to restrain the spread ofthe infection and the opinion seems tobe born out that yellow fever is not atall contagious but atmospherically infectiousTwo lives might have been saved ifany attempt had been made to give thepatients attention Early Mondaymorning Coroner Lemmonnier foundthe dead body of Pepino Gqralofo in aliouse on Burgundy street The bodywas lying on the floor and those in theplace said that the man had gone tobed and rolled out upon the floor in astupor It took Dr Lemmonnier abouttwo minutes to decide that the manhad died from a genuine case oiyellow fever and a subsequentautopsy confirmed the doctors hastydiagnosis The body was immediatelyburied Later on during the day thecoroner was called to view the body ofAntonio Barrone The coroner at oncediagnosed the case as also one of yellow fever Both of these cases hadbeen absolutely concealed from the authorities and had died without a doctorbeing- called in to give relief The firstcase of yellow fever at Baton Rougethe capitol of the state was reportedMonday The case was that of WillieEivas who lives on the outskirts of thecityThe

circuit courtfor the ninth circuit The case involved about 700000 acres of land insouthern California and grew out ofthe fact that the forfeited land grantof the Atlantic Pacific Railroad company was overlapped tosome extent by lands claimedunder government grant by the Southern Pacific The Atlantic and PacificRailroad Co originally claimed thelands in controversy and its originalmaps of location along the line of theselands were accepted by the land officebut congress declared the lands forfeited and thereupon the Southern Pacific whose grant overlappedthat of the Atlantic and Pacific thereupon set up title to the lands Thecircuit court however decided againstthe Southern Pacific and the supremecourt Monday affirmed that decisionso far as concerns the railway companybut remanded to the lower court fordecision the cases of about 200 persona-who had purchased part of the andafrom the railroad companyThe supreme court Monday advancedthe argument of the Durrant murdercase brought

an intense exquisite blue the heat at mid day oxipressive although at morning- and evening-there was the chill in the air thatcalled for fires The hills had turned to1uller browns splashed here and therewith a touch of red more often with thedark disks of dead sunflowers bent lowon their shriveled stems Behind themthe mountains had caught a misty bluethat changed to rich lapis lazuli in theshadows fading all day long to palertints until with the going down of thesun they seemed to shiver and turn blueagain with the cold The quaking aspsflaunted in lines of nickering yellowflame up every gulch a flame that dailyburned more low and down by thecreek the cottonwoods erstwhileclothed in palest yellows and fadedgreens were leaved all over with shimmering bits of bronze just touched

segment of landscape to be seen between the loopedback curtains of his window with anapathetic disgust for it all that hardlytook shape of words even in histhoughts He had been ill of that formof typhus known as mountain fever andthe doctor in order to give him all possible attention had induced the youngman to allow himself to be brought herefrom his cabin at the mine Here he hadbeen for nearly three weeks now hisperceptions for most of the time dulledbeyond heed for anything outside of thehot discomfort of his bed and the growing grievance of over much beef teabut now he was fast mending the protest of his appetite taking form in anintense desire for varied and generallytabooed forms of refreshment whileother interests of life were graduallyreawakeningHe had made his nurse move the bednearer the window that he might lookout but there was little of entertainment to be derived there The roQrawas at the back of the house overlooking the creek and a few straggling cabins

turned restlessly on the pillow listening to the nurses returning stepwith an invalids peevish fretfulnessthat she stayed so long away Therewas no sound in the house save tbefaint clatter of dishes in the distantkitchen where preparations for supper were evidently going on Outsidesounded the faint systole and diastoleof some far away engine and the regular dull mun thing of the stamp millon its endless hard pabulum whileevery now and then as though feelingbound to rouse the place from itssleepy lethargy a tame magpie downthe street would vent its whole repertoire of speech in a series of shrill halloos like a telephone girl gone madJust so Neil remembered this miserable bird had been screaming whenhe had looked his last upon DorothyMeredith when she was coming out ofthe hotel door in her black gown seeming like the ghost of the girl whosewild rose loveliness had been claspedto his heart but the day before Theywere taking her dead to Orodelphia tobe made ready for the long journey eastand in company with her fathers attorney who had come to her at onceupon learning of the awful tragedythe girl was just entering the carriagethat was to follow the hearse downthe Canyon roadShe had to the last refused to seehim even though he had poured hisheart out in a letter that pleaded hisright to comfort her begging for butone kind word She had merely answered him in a few curt lines whichhad neither formal beginning nor signature It may be my fault if you havebeen mistaken but I do not care foryou in the way your letter would implyand I owe it to him never to see youagain It is the onlv atonement I canmakeAnd she had meant it every ruthlessword If there had been any questionas to that in Neils mind he must havebeen undeceived when her eyes all redand swollen from weeping were inadvertently raised to meet his glance somuch of cold aversion her look expressed If for a moment she had everreally loved him he felt she could nothave turned against him so could neverhave looked at him like that feelingthat she was looking upon him for thelast time She had never cared for himHe had been befooled misled by hisown blind infatuation But it was overnow In the long days and nights oflymg here it seemed as though passionhad burned- itself out with the feversflame leaving him wearily indifferentThere was even a dull wonder in hi smind that he had ever cared so muchthat she could have had the power tohurt him so and yet as herememberedthere was such an ache of pity in hisheart for th old self that had beengiven over to the folly of such sufferingsuch a pang cf pain

findsrheumatism and backache and semistarvation and misery There is a fascination about the pursuit howeverand many men stick to it purely from alove of the gambling there is in it andnot that they care anything about thepleasures that money will buyI remember an old fellow who livedin Loafers Hollow in California awayback in the 60s There was quite acamp near him but he did not mix withanybody He washed dirt all daycooked his own meals and never stirredfrom his cabin after dark This cabinwas built on the summit of a hill andabout 300 yards away was a smallspring from which he used to pack hiswater He was asked often why he didnot live nearer to the water but saidthat he liked the exercise of climbingHe never drank or gambled or woregood clothing or ran after women andas he was always at work the boys figured that he must have had considerable money in his hut One night acouple of rustlers tried to scare him outHe killed both of them and after thatbad men and good men alike let himaloneAfter awhile the recluse died andabout a dozen of the boys came up thehill from Loafers Hollow and buriedhim Then they began to look for thegold that they knew he must have hidden In all the years he had never beento the county town so they knew thathe could not have put his dust in thebank Among the searchers was GeorgeHearst afterward a senator from California and the father of the presentowner of the New York Journal then avery poor man Hearst was a big fellow and an expert miner He was moreindustrious than any of the rest Fora space of three acres the groundaround the old fellows cabin was tornup and even the walls were taken downand thelogs riven apart but not a centsworth of metal was found The treasure seekers finally gave it up the yieldplayed out in Loafers Hollow the menwent elsewhere and in a little whilethere was not a sound in the once busycamp save bhe harsh call of the jay birdor the owls hoot at nightThree years afterward a boy whowas out hunting squirrels stopped atthe spring to rest He bent his lips tothe cool water and cut his hand slightlyupon some sharp hard substance buriedat the edge of the spring Digging thesand away with a boys curiosity hefound that it was a piece of tin and going deeper he found that the tin belonged to a three gallon kerosene cansunk into the ground under the edge ofthe spring Burrowing deeper he finally

John Walker Harrington wvPCopyright 1897GffiL had never been to LakeTHEGeorge before and it was hardlyher fault that she irretrievably injuredher social standing before she had beenat Horicon Ferry two hours GraceWright was an actress who had entered the theatrical profession as achorus girl She had now reached therank of an ingenue in one of the popular theatersEverybody at Horicon Ferry goes totuelanding to inquire for mail and tosee what manner of people are goingup the lake The morning and eveningsteamer arrivals are the two incidentsof the day and John Treadwell wasas curious as the rest of the little colonywhich dwelt on the point of land whichjuts out into the upper lake He washolding a flaring red parasol over theJiead of his richest aunt when he sawGrace Wright hastening over the gangplank Before he could beat a retreatttlie girl had nodded to him and he wascompelled to acknowledge her salutation with a perfunctory dip of his hatThe next moment the girl had givenher baggage to a porter thereby proclaiming her intention of becoming aguest of Horicon Ferrys one hotelI did not know said Miss JemimahPettingill sister of John Treadwellsmother recently deceased that youhad any acquaintances among the hotelpeopleWell replied the young man nervously twisting his mustache a fellowwho is a reporter on a New York newspaper as I am is bound to meet a fewpersons who are not eligible to thehamlet set at Horicon FerryI trust nephew said Miss Pettingill that you will remember that itis decidedly improper to mingle yourbusiness and social acquaintancesShe is rather handsome too Has hermother with her Evidently makessome pretense to respectabilityAunt Jemimah said the 3roungman the young woman is a memberof Mr Paysons compan She is agirl of sterling character She has beenoa the stage almost from childhoodFrom that day John Treadwell hadno peace of miud at Lake George Hewas at Horicon landing principally because his aunt had told him to comeand incidentally because the family ofhis fiancee Agnes Shelton had a cottage there He thought rather guiltilyof the evenings when he had called onGrace Wright and of the talks theyhad had upon literature and the uplifting of the stage from its present sorrowful plight They had read the samebooks and had spent many an afternoon at the picture galleries That wasin the days when he was struggling forbare existence upon a paper whoseprincipal stock in trade consisted ofniggardly pay to its reporters Hewas glad in those days when the weekly payday arrived and brought with itthe blessed assurance that he mighthave breast of veal with green peasfor at least one dinner of theweekThen somebody discovered that hecould write and he found himself upona paper where his weekly space billsran above the three figure mark andhe was hailed by that proudest of ParkBow tities a good man Then hefell into the guA graces of his AuntJemimah That meant receptions andafternoon teas and an introductioninto one of the smart sets of NewYork That is how he met Agnes Shelton She thought that his life whs soInteresting and so fascinating andhe who had almost forgotten -the dayswhen he was a drudge and a packhorse never told her anything to thecontrary She had money enough fortwo He saw his opportunity andavailed himself of it They were engagedGrace Wright saw him once or twiceafter his rise in fortune It was veryeasy for him to tell her that he couldfind no time to call upon her for menwho are under the beck and call of acity editor have little time when theymay call their own She saw him forthe first time in months at the landingat Horicon FerryThe principal occupation of the socalled society element at HoriconLanding consisted in making life unendurable to the majority of those whocame there There were three distinctestates the Hotel set the Justin setand the Hamlet set Anybody who hadeither owned or rented a cottage forthree years in succession was entitledto the rank of Hamleteer He hadthe right to snub anybody who camewithin sight of the little cluster of cottages at the end of the point Therewas also an overgrown country farmhouse not far from the hamlet keptby the venerable Mrs Justin A fewand only a few of those who stoppedat Justins were recognized by the Hamleteers Those who stopped at the hotel were considered beneath social recognition They belonged to a classwhich never came to Horicon Ferry formore than one yearAfter the strictest set of the Hamleteers was Miss Jemimah Pettingill acottager It was her pride that in allthe ten years she had been coming toLake George no hotel guest had everdarkened her threshold By right ofseniority she was the social law giverof Horicon Ferry and Grace Wrighthad not Ibeen at the hotel more thanthree days before she was obliged toassert her authority One of the Hamleteers who had once seen the youngwoman in a minor Shakespearean roleinsisted upon inviting the girl to givean open air reading There was a briefsharp struggle and the project wasabandonedGrace Wright and her mother werepermitted to go their own way Theydid not seem even to be aware ofthe fact that they had been sociallyostracised They cared not either forHnmleteers the Justin set or theguests of the hotel A young dry goodsclerk who was spending a weeksday long was busy conveying lo antjpacking boxes to the rock In the center of the pile were trunks of gianttrees placed on end and held in placeby smaller logs In the center was apocket filled with light kindling woodcovered with pitch and tar This wasthe mine from which was to ascend atongue of flame Hamlet and hotelviewed Dove Bock with pride when thework of the bonfire builders was doneThe night was falling when from thpoint a flotilla of boats swept towardsthe rock There was a clanking ofrowlock chains and the oars rattledagainst cedar sheathed hulls Craftwhich for weeks had been dodgingeach other were moored side by sideThe slow beating of the oars kept thehalf moon of boats from drifting toward the rockA single boat shot out from theswinging group and grated upon theedge of Dove Rock A gleam of lightshone from beneath the shelter of acap then the flame from a torch flaredhigh in the air John Treadwell hisface illumined by the jet of fire abovehis head turned to the crescent ofboats and bowed He hurled the torchinto the center of the giant tinder boxand turned to go But his foot caughtupon a root and he lurched forwardIn trying to save himself he halfturned then fell upon the rock Fromthe top of the pile of timbers burst ablinding flood of light Beneath itsglare those who sat in the half luneof boats could see that a thin stream ofblood was trickling from the right temple of the man who lay stretched uponthe rockThe pile of timbers began to settleA blistering heat compelled the spectators to pull back from the nest offlames A pine log rolled from the sideof the volcano of wood and fell snapping and snarling within six inches ofTreadwelPs feetWh3r doesnt somebody pull out tothe rock yelled a voice far back inthe semi circleWhy dont you do it yourselfcame the response in a half dozenkeysA light shallop shot out from thelanding near the hotel Some oneclosely wrapped in a cloak draggedtheprostrate form into the boat and slowly rowed out of the zone of blisteringheAtIt seems strange to me remarkedthe dramatic critic of the Daily HariDRAGGED THE PROSTRATE FORM INTO THE BOATcation at the Ferry smiled upon theyoung woman but received a lookwhich was a Siberian winter GraceWright spent her days in rowing hermother about among the islands of thelake There is an amiable traditionthat in this body of water there are365 islands one for every day in theyear In leap year so the story goes anadditional island appears wThich isagain lost to view on the last day ofDecember There were islands enoughfor everybody and the mother anddaughter managed to steer clear of thearistocracy of Horicon FerryJohn Treadwell saw the two occasionally and greeted them by touchingthe rim of his hat It is the unwrittenlaw at Horicon Ferry that a Hamleteer must be greeted by removing thehat and describing with it a considerable arc one of the Justin set may begreeted by raising the hat and a guestof the hotel is to be ignored andsnubbed Treadwells salute was afeeble compromiseYou neednt trouble yourself tospeak to me any longer said the girlto him one day I think that I canadapt myself to the present situationI suppose that if I had gone to Justins you might have treated me withordinary civilityIn her heart she said I can hardlyblame him He has a career beforehim If I had loved him less I wouldhave married him when he asked metwo years agoThere was one- day in the calendarwhen all differences of social standingwere forgotten That was Dove Bockday On that day the great rockwhich rose from the middle of the baynear Horicon Ferry was piled highwith drift wood it was the funeralpyre of the season which was goneThe material for the conflagration wasgathered from the islands and from thewooded shore The Hamleteers theboarders at Justins and the guests atthe hotel all joined in transporting thesupplies for the last spectacle of thedeclining yearJohn Treadwell that yeanwas masterof the navy of transports allbinger to the night editor of the Morning Rainbow who had joined him at alate supper in a restaurant that newspaper men have such a predilection formarrying actresses I suppose that weshall be hearing of Treadwells seekinga divorce sometime within the nextsix months He was married this even-ing to Gracie Wright who used to beat PaysonsWell said the night editor fromwhat I know about it that divorcewont come very soon She saved hislife at Lake George last summerPoisonous PerspirationThe question of the toxic qualities ofperspiration though not quite a newone inasmuch as M Berthelot at arecent meeting of the Paris Medicalacademy reminded his listeners that ifAfricanus can be believed the perspiration gathered from a horse was usedin ancient times to render arrows poisonous has recently formed the subject of research Several experimentshave proved that human perspiration istoxic A

Pacific railway inCalifornia not far from Mojave is a little station a spur track a box car fora telegraph office and a section housecomposing the whole The stationhouse is or was presided over by ahandsome and hearty Irish womanwho kept house for her husband Thehands being Chinese cooked forthemselves The duties of the agentconsisted of reporting the passage oftrains none of them stopped andfeeding himself Two or three milesto the west was what is termed in thatsection a milk ranch This ranch contained a widow and three buxom girlsher daughtersOne might have supposed that theagent being- Johnny on the spot asit were stood a better chance than therest of the railroaders but such wasnot the case There was a certain conductor Hardy by name who leaned inthe direction of the widow and he wasequal to the occasion His plan ofoperations was unique and daring Hewould send his train ahead leaving thecaboose at the station Then of coursetaking account of other trains due hewould wander over to the ranch andspend all his spare cash in milk andhis spare time in blarney Returning hewould station himself on the frontplatform of the caboose like a trolleyman and let her co Gallao her downj 0 7 --40 miles of grade while he controlledthe car by means of the brake catchhis train at the next station and proceedThe agent did not like this very wellUnfortunately for him his duties weresuch as to confine him to his box caroffice almost continually so that hohad no chance to prosecute his suit except when the ladies paid a visit to thestation house After much broodinghe decided to put a stop to further proceedings on the part of the conductorand awaited his opportunity It was abright day in June when the trainpulled in and as the conductor gavethe engineer a joyful and significanthigh ball the latter pulled out leaving a caboose at the station There wasa short salute and a hurried departureas the conductor left the agent and thelatter proceeded to business He firstplaced a chock against a wheel of thecar and then disconnected the brakechain He placed the connected chainin such a position that a touch woulddisplace it and then awaited the returnof his hated rivalLike a triumphant gladiator Hardyreturned WTith scarce a look at theagent he ascended the platform kickedoff the dog that held the brake andwith mingled feeling of security andpleasure felt the car move down thegrade That car certainly moved Conductor Hardy was heard to saj afterward that nothing could have passedit but lightning The inhabitants ofMojave tell to this day of a yellowstreak which flashed through theirtown and was gone almost as soon asit arrived That was Mr Hardy andthe caboose As luck would have itthe train had gone into a siding so thattfle track was clear and after a dovelikeflight of about 50 miles the wild caboosecame to a stand Mr Hardy nevercame back any more so far as thewidow was concerned AnacondaMont StandardNOTES OF THE FASHIONSA Variety of Modes Which

post is quite sure to be utterly destroyed by the feet of the horsesHi nee horses will move all about a postto which they are hitched even whenharnessed to a carriage This makesan unsightly spot and one where veryquickly a pool of water will stand afterevery rain The cut shows an improvement on an improved hitching postJ I IIWw j j2wMmriNEW H1TCHINO POSTI first conceived the idea of locatingthe post just outside the roadway inthe grass using the double swingingiron arm with its snaffle to hold thehorse off from the grass This -workswell with most horses but some willthrow the arm completely up over thetop of the post and so get on to thegrass with all four feet This is obviated by using the chain as shown inthe cut This permits the arm to risejust far enough to reach the bridle ofthe horse with play enough so that hecan move his head freely but does notpermit him to throw fit over upon theother side of the postThis device of using an arm to keepthe horse away from the post accomplishes more than the preservation ofthe grassy sod It keeps the horse fromgnawing and disfiguring the post andfrom rubbing his bridle and other partsof his harness against it often to theserious injury of the harness CountryGentlemanCOMFORT ON THE FARMIt Furnishes Eneourasrement for Successful EffortThe laek of comfort in the home of afarmer is not as a general rule somuch the result of

inducing inexperienced persons to venture into the poultry business under the cfelusion that they cansurely make a competency even if failure ensues in every other enterpriseCareful reflection should convince themost enthusiastic individuals that it isimpossible to realize much that is hldout invitingly With the sum of a fewhundred dollars or as much as a thousand it is proposed to engage in thepoultry business The question is considered and discussed as to the profitsto expect Comparing the businesswith any other it can be noticed thatthere is no occupation that would notbe considered very profitable with aprofit of 20 per cent or even one halftbat percentage To realize 200 a yearon an investment of L000 thereforeis to secure in the poultry businesssomething that is difficult to obtain inany other direction yet many who invest 1000 in poultry and the necessary buildings are not satisfied unlessthey can make a sum nearly equal tothe caDital enroloved One cause ofmuch expectation is the fact that fowlsmultiply rapidly and will naturally increase which is true -but it requiresthe Joss of a year for the chicks toreach matuntj while the expense isoccurring all the time The sum of1000 would not pay for the buildingaand fowls necessary to start with 500hens and the profit will not amountto one dollar a hen for the whole number Right here it may be urged thatone can by doing the work himselfmake 500 a year on a capital of 1000but it will not be profit as the labormust be paid for whether it is performed by the investor or by employing some one to assist That howeveris the bright side of the business lia person can invest his money so asto give himself employment it will bea great point gained but only the mostexperienced poultrymen Itave succeeded in keeping 500 hens On the farmswhere the farmers are already established they can by utilizing their labor in winter make poultry pay wellon their investment but all who mayeiicrasre in the business will find that assoon as the labor is hired the profits willnot exceed those derived from someother pursuits Farm and FiresideWIRE FENCE POSTSNothing Is Quite tm Good and Durableas Live TreesThere is

hasbeen receiving reports from Umatilla FJaof an almost miraculous cure that had beeneffected in the case of Fannie Adams adaughter of A J Adams of that place andlast Saturday a representative of this papermade a trip to Umatilla for the purpose ordetermining the authenticity of the sameThe family live a short distance from thevillage where it was found that the peoplewere cognizant of the cure which had beeneffected and were rejoicing with the familyin their new found happiness The fatherA J Adams is a hard workiner honestfarmer from east Tennessee and the familycame to Florida four years ago in the hopethat a change of climate would be of benefitto their afflicted child Much of their earnings have gone for doctors bills whoseservices proved unavailing The representative was greeted by Mrs Adams from whombe gained the story of her great trialFannie the youngest child was born ineast Tennessee and was seven years oldonthe third day of February 197 When tenmonths old she was stricken with paralysiswhich affected the entire left side Thisstroke of paralysis was followed by convulsions and from the time little Fannie wasten months old until February 1897 therewas not a single day or a night that she didnot have spasms of the most distressingnature Not a single convulsion but always three or four and sometimes as highas len in one dajThe family was all broken down withcare and Mrs Adams states that for oneyear she did not go into her kitchen to superintend her household work All the fingersof the right hand of the little eirl are enlarged and misshapen caused by her biting them during the fearful suffering Thecase baffled the skill of the best physiciansand they were frank to say that they couldnot determine the cause or prescribe aremedy to aid the afflicted childBut what a change now in that householdfor little Fannie has recently been releasedfrom her six years of agony which brings thelight of happiness to the faces of the parentsIn January this year Mrs Adams whohad purchased some of Dr Williams PinkPills for Pale People for her fourteen yearold daughter determined to try their effectupon little Fannie After three or fourdoses she noted an improvement and shethen told the father what she had doneHe at once went to the village and boughtanother box and up to this time six boxeshave been used The first pills MrsAdams states were given in January thelatter part and certainly not earlier thanthe fifteenth or twentieth and the child hadher last convulsion on February 3d nearlythree months ago Her general conditionhas improved in every way and it was nota month after the first pills were takenwhen she began to walk without assistanceThe pills were bought at the drug storeof Dr Shelton in Umatilla In answerto the question did he to his personalknowledge know that the remedy had benefited Fannie Adams as was stated by hermrents the doctor said that he was a reguar practicing physician and as such wasloth to recommend any proprietary medicine but still he was ready to do justice toall men and he did know that Dr Williams Pink Pills for Pale People had benefited Fannie Adams and also volunteeredthe information that he knew of other children in the

delivered onthat occasion Nov 19 1868 GovernorCurtin began by saying that there hadbeen much discussion as to andwhen that address was written arid hecontinued says The IndependentI can tell you all about that Ofcourse I was there and the presidentand his cabinet had arrived and wereat the hotel Soon after his arrival aswe were sitting around in the parlorMr Lincoln looked thoughtful for amoment or two and then said I believe gentlemen the committee are expecting me to say something here today If you will excuse me I will gointo this room here and prepare itAfter a time he returned holding inhis hand a large yellow governmentenvelope on which he had written hisaddressHere gentlemen he said I wantto read this to you to see if it will doAnd sitting down he read it to us and Ithen said Now for your criticismsWill it do What do you saySeveral spoke in favor of it andone or two commended it in strongterms Well says the presidenthavent you any criticisms What doyou say SewardMr Seward made one or two suggestions bearing on some slight verbalchanges which I believe Mr LincolnincorporatedNow if you will allow me gentlemen continued the president I willcopy this off And he again withdrewmade a copy of the addressAh continued the governor if Ihad had wit enough about me to havebegged of him that yellow envelopewhat a trophy it would have been 1 Howmuch it would have been worth

laughter is your true alchemistHowever it may be with the unmusicalperson surely the surly individual whocannot laugh spontaneously on occasionsis fit for treasons strategems and spoilsBut this
