J. Whether kindlytreatment of a hen will accelerate eggproductivity in the inverse ratie ofcareless or indifferent attention is tobe given official demonstration in theegg laying contests under way here.Professor E. R. Johnstone, superintendent of the Training School ForFeeble Minded Boys and .Girls, hasmaintained that kindness to a henmeans more eggs, but some of the expert poultrymen hereabouts scout theidea, saying that the average hen istoo obtuse to appreciate what is donefor her.With the aid of Ilarry R. Lewis,poultry husbandman of the state experiment station, Professor Johnstonehas arranged for the demonstration ofhis theory.Two pens of hens of the same breedand strain will be set apart To one ofthem will be attached as attendant aman who can go about his work witha sunny smile, cheerful interest andgentle touch. To the other will be assigned one with an ingrown grouch.The same feed and the same conditionsexactly will be applied to both pensand the records carefully kept as towhich gives the best results. ProfessorJohnstone feels sure that his theorywill be fully substantiated.NURSES FOR ARMY OF MILLIONRed Cross Preparing to Serve ThatNumber of IVJen In Caso of War.Washington.

This equality does not exist, and in the nature of things, cannot. Mutual companies, those which are truly so in organization and method, systematically and continuously furnish life insurance at cost. It is not possible for stock companies to do so, for in addition to the actual cost of insurance, there is incurred a liability for annual dividends uponthe stock capital; and it is not too much to say, historically speaking, that the interest of theowners of that capital is uniformly paramount to that of the policyholder, and is the chiefconcern of the management. Indeed, such dividends have been declared and paid wheninsolvency was imminent. Assuming equally capable management, it is impossible for stockcompanies, with the handicap named, to make the cost to the insured as low as in the otherclass of companies; it is therefore left to claim superiority of management in behalf of thestock institutions, and this claim is so volubly and persistently urged, that taken with thelower initial premium it finds some acceptance by those not fully informed.If insurance be desired for one or two years only, the stipulated lower premiumpresents an advantage which ceases to be conspicuous as years go by. Anart from the matter of current cost, there are many considerations which should be weighed. Among theseis one which to most people addresses itself strongly. It is that of control. In the mutualcompanies, this resides wholly with the policyholders. They own the company, and it istheirs to conduct it as they wish, consistent with the objects for which it is incorporated,and the law of the land. They can effectively intervene to prevent extravagance, diversionof funds or waste in any form; they can and do prescribe the nature, extent, variety, etc.,etc., of all contracts; they select their representatives and can change them at will. Itseems important that such powers should reside and be exercised only where there is unityof interest. When one ' considers, in relation to cost, the larger values paid by theNorthwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, the. difference in its favor is noticeable.The Nortwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company is a purelymutual company. It has no capital stock to buy or sell. Only onepurely mutual legal reserve life-insurance company has ever failedin this.country. That occurred more than 40 years ago.R. F.

Nevertheless, furriers seem to have madelittle attempt to find or utilize a homesupply. Many, it is safd, think thatcony is exclusively a foreign productand the American-grown rabbits haveinferior pelts of little value. As a matter of fact, American breeders areraising the same kinds of rabbits thatproduce the best cony of the fur shops.The climate here is as favorable forthe production of good fur as inEurope, and if American rabbit skinsare of poor quality the true cause isbad management and not climate orbreed.It is certain that as valuable rabbitlur can be produced in America aselsewhere. Probably the quality ofthe pelts can be greatly improved byselective breeding. Tho importantthing is to induce the fur trade to recognize the importance of the domesticsupply and to establish a market forthe skins with well-understood standards of preparing and handling. A cooperative plan for exhibiting gooddressed skins to the trade should, it issaid, aid breeders to accomplish theirobject.JBEST REMEDY FORWHOOPING COUGHII "Last winter when my little boy hadtthe whooping cought I gave him Chajn-jberlain's Cough Remedy," writes MrsI J.

Final action, was taken by Congress, Thursday,on the war army bill, the second ofthe major measures of the war.The Senate, by a vote of 65 to 8,adopted the conference report accepted Wednesday by the House. VicePresident Marshall and Speaker Clarksigned the bill and sent it to the WhiteHouse for President Wilson's approval. As finally approved the bill providesfor raising by selective conscription awar army in increments of 500,000men from 21 to 30 years of age.It also authorizes, ".without directing,the President to raise volunteer forceswhich Colonel Roosevelt desires totake to France, and greatly increasesthe pay of all enlisted men.Machinery to register and draft thefirst 500,000 men has already been setup by the War (Department. ThePresident will by proclamation designate the day for registration of the10,000,000 or anore men of the prescribed age.Registration books will be in thehands of State and local authorities,who will co-operate in the work, andBrigadier General Srowder, the Provost Marshall General, expects tohave his complete lists in Washingtonwithin five days after registration begins. Then will come the task of selectingthe first half million, exempting the.physically unfit, those with dependentsmd men who are needed on the farmsand in industries. The process of selection probably will be completed longbefore the men are wanted.Secretary Baker said- yesterday because of lack of supplies the new armywould not be called to the colors fortraining before Sepetember.After stating that the labor questionwas receiving serious attention fromall departments, Secretary Bakerwrote to Senator Jones:"Owing to the depleted state of oursupplies it will not be practicable tocall out the first 500.000 men to beraised under the provisions of the billnow pending before Congress untilabout September 1, so there will be noappreciable' interference with the labor supply of the country until thatdate."When these men are called theywill have to be continuously trainedwith the colors until they are sentabroad.

Organiza-1ion of a National Government syslew. ot supplying labor for the country' farms this summer probablv willo completed by the Agriculture andlibor Departments within two weeks,and in a short time thereafter the '(Jovornnient expects to be enrolling 'hundreds of thousands of men, women ,and boys for farm work.The plan outlined Thursday by W.1 Spillman, Chief of the AgricultureDepartment's office of farm manage-,ment, calls for the co-operation of all 'State food organizations. In each ;State the Governor will name a boardto direct the work, the boards to name jcounty agents, and they in turn com-jinanity agents. Many Governors already have named boards from theirState Food Commissions.Community agents will register persons who can give a part of their timethis summer to farm labor, and willregister also the ordinary surplus offarm labor. In addition they will ascertain their local farm labor needs,and where possible will place the labor in their own communities.The community agents will report tocomnty agents any surplus of labor orlabor needs, and county agents will reurt in turn to State boards. If alabor surplus or shortage exists in aState, the boards will report to theAgriculture Department, and the Labor Department will assist in obtaining the proper distribution. Railroadswfil aid by giving low transportationrates to laborers.Two hundred and fifty thousandposters will be sent throughout thecoantry soon, calling on (persons toenroll for fanm labor. The departments behind the plan believe citiesan villages can supply a great deal oflabor for short periods.?" fe fKSWStSSmiSxMvSiSmmKm . 'lr?i?sywSmn - - - ,-, ; ,.. , feagamKaiaaiB i unit am.
