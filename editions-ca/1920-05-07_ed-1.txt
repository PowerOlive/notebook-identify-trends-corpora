I could not eat anythingwithout feeling perfectly miserableafterwards. There was such a pressure of gas on my heart and lungs atlimes that I felt like I was choking.I had no appetite and was often sonauseated and weak that I simplyhad to stop whatever I was doingand sit down. Meats were like poison to me, for if I ventured to eatthem I felt like I would almost diefrom cramnins: nains in mv stomach.My nerves were so upset that I became irritated and worried at almostnothing. Even my little childrenplaying about the house and yardgot on my nerves so I could hardlykeep still. I had headache everyday, slept poorly at night and felttired, weak and bad all the time."I had heard lots about Tanlac,but had no idea it was so fine untilI began taking it myself. I remember well the first three doses I took,for it actually made me want to eatsomething the first day, and thatLight I slept better than I had in along time. I have just finished mysecond bottle now and am feelingstronger and better already than Ihave since ny troubles began. Thechildren can make all the racketthey please now, in fact, I frolicwith them sometimes, for 1 am nolonger nervous and nothing disturbs me. My appetite is just finesnd I am eating meats and just anything else I want without feeling asign of indigestion. I go about mywoik now with a whole heart, for Iam feeling ljke a new person.

Several people had told me that Trutonawas the very best tonic I could findand I ttiink the same of the medicine myself now, because it's simplywonderful the way Trutona hasbrought me out of my troubles."In the foregoing words is to beseen the reason why Mrs. MamieBruce, a well-known Louisville nursewho lives at 1018 South. Seventhstreet, so highly praises the PerfectTonic. Mrs. Bruce is surely wellqualified to judge the merits of apreparation and hei statement willdeeply impress many suffering people. Continuing, she said:"I weighed 124 pounds when Ibegan using Trutona, but to-day Itip the scales at 138 pounds andI'm still gaining. A catarrhal offection had been constantly causingthe formation of mucus in my -head.I could hardly talk and I'd justhave one cold after another. Mysystem had gotten in an awfulshape. For several years I hadn'tbeen able to eat meat, especially fatmeats, and every thing I ate seemedlo stick in my throat."Well, I don't think it's possiblefor a tonic to make a person feeibetter than I do now. I took fourbottles of Tiutona before I noticedNhe benefits, but from then on themedicine certainly did do the work.My catarrhal affection has been entirely relieved and to this day Iwouldn't know I'd ever had such anailment. I'm eating everything Iwant every day now things 1couldn't touch for years and I suffer no bad after-effects."Trutona is sold in Paris at G.

She enteied a protest but nothing came of it.The young lady said that manybig business -houses were not satisfied with making 100 per cent,profit, but it was her opinion theyweie making from 150 to 200 percent. She suggested the followingremedy:"Do not buy anything in the firststore you visit. Ask the price, andif it seems excessive at all, say youwill not buy it and walk out. Thengo .to 'the next store, and you maybuy it for less. At any rate, theprofiteers need to know that thepublic is getting wise to them.

Any maker can build agood tire if he cares to pay per-f ection's price.All men know Brunswick standards, for Brunswick products havebeen famous for 74 years.Formulas, fabrics and standardsvary vastly in cost. Reinforcements, plies and thickness are amatter of expense. And these variations affect endurance. It restswith the maker how far he wishes vto go how much he can affordto give.For there are no secrets nor patents to hold one back.To ascertain what each makeroffers one must analyze and tcistsome 200 tires as our laboratorieshave done.Then it is a matter of combiningthe best features and building according to the highest standards.Once you try a Brunswick youwill understand how we have builtmodel tires, regardless of .factory, expense.Yet Brunswick Tires cost you thesame as other like-type tires.
