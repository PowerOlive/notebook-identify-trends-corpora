Sadness of Unbelief.
I look upon unbelief as the greatest
of calamities. It is the loss of the
chief aid of virtue, of the mightiest
power over temptation, of the most
quickening knowledge of God, of the
only sure hope. The unbeliever would
gain unspeakably by parting with
every possession for the truth which
he doubts or rejects. William Ellery
Channing.
Word and Deed.
"My dear girl," said her mother-in-law,

Ringling Circus.
Ringling Brothers Circus and newly
added $500,000 spectacle of "Joan of
Aic, will ehxibit in Lexington, Tues
adv, Sept.lk3. The spectacle in itself
is an attraction that should bring
thousands of visitors from the sur
rounding country. It U beyoned ques
tion the geatest production of its kind
ever seen in America.
The world's most skillful scenic ar
tists. costumers.Drupertv-makers, cho
ius directors and stage managers were
engagedto mount thefproduction. A
stage bigger than a -hundred ordinary
theatres was built and made portable
so that it can be conveyed frorn town
to town and erected each morning in
the mam tent. Thus the circus propri
etors have'made it possible for those
who live in contibutoy towns as well
as in the large cities to see thta mag-
Mt.cent wordless play with its cast of j
1,200 characters, a ballet of 300 danc
ing girlp. a grand opera chorus of 400 l
voices, 600 horses and a train load of I
special scenery, costumes, properties
and mechanical devices for producing
such stage effects as thunder, light,
ning, storms, fires, and the sound of'
battle. i
In the old market place of Rouen,
France, there now stands a monument
by which the French of today have
sought to redeem their part in the ex-i
ecution of Joan of Arc, who, on May
30, 1431, was burned to death on the
false charge .f heresy after having
j delivered her country from the Eng
lish and having restored the crown to j
.'Charles VII. History records but the
measrer facts ot this strance heroine
of eighteen years, who led the armies J
invasion, and then, deserted by all, I
even the indolent monarch whom she l
preserved, died by the crudest torture
known with the name of the master
upon her lips. Unsung in poetry the
name of this simple peasant girl has '
come down through the ages to be r er
vered as that of a saint, and whose '
wonderfurpowers and whose bravery
are verily" believed to have been of
divine inspiration.
On gthe triumphant incidents, the
victorious engagements, the final de
feat of the English armies, and the
coronation of Charles VII, all achieved
by the frail Maid of Orleans, has been
founded the inspiring spectacle which
gives Ringilng Brothers' Circus a new
significance pnd makes an attraction
such as the world in searching for
amusement has never before found.
The regular circus program i3 more
than ever attractive. Its company of1
375 foreign artists, its double mena
gerie and its new sheet parade will
prove a great surprise to t!.c?2 who
attend from this city. The i.vzzl is
one that should not'be missed.

CURIOUS BITS
OF HISTORY
A ROMAN
TRIBUTE
COLN.
TO LIN-
By A. W. MACY.
About a year after th death
of President Lincoln there was
found In the basement of the
White House a large stone with
an inscription, in Italian, of
which this is a translation: ""To
Abraham Lincoln, President for
the second time of the Ameri
can Republic, citizens of Rome
present this stone, from the
wall of Servius Tulliul, by
which the memory of each of
those brave assertcrs of liberty
may be associated." No opo
about the White House knew
anything about the stone, or
had ever heard of it. No on
remembered having heard Lin
coln speak of it. It seems that
after his re-election these Ro
man patriots, wishing to show
their admiration of his charac
ter and their appreciation of hla
work, took this stone from the
wall of the wise and just old
Roman emperor, had the In
scription placed upon It, and
sent it to him as a testimonial.
It is believed that In order to
avoid notoriety, and in keeping
with his modest nature, he
quietly plad the stone in the
basement and said nothing
about it to any one. It may
now be seen in the r.nnriian'a
room of the Lincoln monumr!f
at Springfield, where it was
placed by direction of congress.

Statements That May Be Inves

Citizens.
When m Paris citizen comes to the
front, tulii: g his frknds and neighbors
of his experience, you can rely on his
sincerity. The statements of people
residing in far places do not command
your confidence. Home indorsement
is the kind that backs Doan's Kidney
Pills. Such testimony is convincing.
Investigation proves it true. Below
is a statement of a'Paris resident. No
stronger Droof of merit can be had.
M. Holleran, 200 W. Seventh St.,
Paris, Ky., says: "Doan's Kidney
Pills are mighty good and I am glad
to praise them to everyone. I had a
lot of .trouble from my back and kid
neys. The action of mv kidneys caused
me much suffering and sometimes the
passage of the secretions were pain
ful. I had backaches, too. I used
many medicines, but was rot benefitted
uutil I took Doan's Kidney Pills. They
soon'made me better and stronger, "jg
