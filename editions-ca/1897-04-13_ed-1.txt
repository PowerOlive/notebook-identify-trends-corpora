used to preventeffort to secure action on importantmeasuresAside from the matter of reorganization there are four important questions before the senate These areThe Morgan Cuban resolution thebankruptcy bill the Anglo Americanarbitration treat and the aprropriation billsSenator Davis chairman of the committee on foreign relations said Sunday that he was hopeful of securingconsideration

of one speciesof fur bearing animals are found innumbersThey are black and silver -foxes andIt majr be said in beginning that the3rdid not get on the island by themselvesA few 3ears ago Thomas F Morganof Groton Conn who was summeringat Boothbay Harbor conceived the planof stocking one of the numerous islandsin that vicinity with black and silverfoxes that are now almost extinct inthe wild state He looked around for asuitable island and finally hit uponOuter Heron as possessing all the conditions necessary to the success of sucha colony as he desired to plantOuter Heron is a wooded island of 100acres or so with considerable elevationand bold rocky shores It has plentyof fresh water and its dense growth ofspruces pines and firs breaks the forceof winter gales There is a good dwelling home on the island and in wintera dozen or more lobster fishermen livein shanties around the little cove thatserves as a harborThe island was owned by Eichard HEmerson a veteran who resided at EastBoothbay From him Mr Morgan obtained permission in consideration ofa j earby rental to stock the island withfcxesAn order was sent bv Mr Morgan to afur compan3r engaged in breeding blackfoxes on an island in Alaska for a consignment of the animals and 30 goodspecimens were started east Thetook man3 months being madevessel and steamer to San Pranciscoand thence overland and when the consignment arrived at Harboronly seven of the fcxes were aliveThese were put on Outer Heron abouta year ago and the3r have thrived andmultiplied from all indications A fewmonths ago a compac3 was formed under the lavfs of Maine to foster the industry Mr Morgan things he will makeout of the fox raising business on OuterneronTo a Globe man who visited Boothba3r Harbor recently Mr Knight talkedentertainingly about the prospects ofraising black foxes for marketWe dont expect to get anj returnsright away said he but when we getthe island well stocked we ought to dowell Last year there were onlv 1700black and silver fox skins sold in London the fur market of the world The3nearl3 all came from Alaska and thejwere 14 months on the way If we canraise skins here we can get them toLondon 13 months earlier than theycould be sentf rom AlaskaWe intend to breed out all the liglitstrain or silver foxes from our stockA silver fox is by no means a cheapanimal the xelt of a good one is worth75 to 100 but the black fox is muchmore valuable the pelts being worth ashigh as 100 each Boston GlobeTHE GREECE OF TO DAYPatriotism TliaT Brolce tlie Fetters ofTnrlcisli DominationTo understand

enough apart sothat the different flocks will readilydistinguish their own homes To helpthem do tins each house maybe painteda diffeent color cheap ochre paints being suitable for this purposeWhere running water is at hand thework of caring for 200 or 300 fowls during the summer would be reduced to aminimum In the winter the fowls canmost readily be cared for in quartersclose to the house two

Statesin These TimesThe existing plethora of corn resulting in fabulously low prices hasoccasioned much speculation as to itsfuel value There is such adiversity ofopinion and so little actual knowledgeregarding the profitableness of burning corn instead of coal that it seemeddesirable to conduct a comparative testthat would show the relative heatingpower of the two materials The interests of the large number of jpeopleliving in the region of cheap corn ledto the determination of its most profitable use after it is upon the marketby the authorities of the Nebraska agricultural collegeTo make the test a good grade of yellow dent corn on the ear of last yearscrop and not thoroughly dry wasburned under the boiler used to supply power for the department oftical mechanics and the amount ofwater evaporated by the burning of aknown quantity of corn was notedThe test lasted 9 hours and 5233pounds of corn and cob were consumedThe next day the same boiler was heated with screened Rock Springs nut coaland the amount of water evaporatedwas recordedThe data thus obtained show thatone pound of coal evaporated 19 timesas much water as one pound of cornIn other words 19 times as much heatwas liberated in burning ofre poundof coal as in burning one pounKl of cornSeveral calorimeter tests were madewhich agreed very closely with -theseresultsThe coal used cost at Lincoln G65per ton With coal selling lit this priceand worth -19 times as much for fuelas an equal weight of corn the fuelvalue of the latter would be 350 perton or 1225 cents per bushel Tlie following table shows how much eoal isworth per ton when its heating poweris the same as that used in the experiment and when corn is selling ata certain price per bushelCorn per bu Coal per ton9 cents 4 S710 cents 54J11 cents 5 AS12 cents G 4fl13 cents 7 1114 cents 7 57It will thus be seen that if this quality of coal were selling at less thanG50 and corn were bringing 12 centsit would not pay to burn corn whilecoal must sell as low as 541 per tonI to be as cheap fuel as corn at ten centsper bushelA very complete and thorough investigation of this subject is being conducted at the university It -was thoughtdesirable however to publish the results already obtained although theywere based upon the performance ofbut one quality of coal This coal iswell known and largely used in thestateSIEVES ON THE FARMUseful in
