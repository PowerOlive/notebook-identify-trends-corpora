THEATRICAL.
AMONG LYMAN HOWES' TRAVELS
Among the many .characteristics of
life in Holland to be presented by
Lyman fcl. Howe at the Paris Grand
on Thursday, April 10, ,is that shos -ing
what inveterate smokers;the Hol
landers are. It is Jthe indulgence gin
this habit, combined with the peculiar
climate, that makes them the calmest,
most deliberate and phlegmatic race
on earth.
Tobacco amoke'is called their second
breath and a cigar or pipe is in evi
dence with them so incessantly that
it is likeja sixth finger of their hand.
So confirmed is this habit, that many
Dutchmen go to Asleep at night Jwith
their pipes between their lips so they
can find then; immediately on awaken
ing in the morning, and light them
before rising. The ;boatmen a type
of which, is presented in Mr. Howe's
series measure distances not by the
number of miles from place to place
but by so many pipes of tobacco
smoked enroute.
For these reasons it is perhaps nat
ural to expect that the world's champ
ion smoker was a Hollander. His
name was Meinheer Van Klaes. Ho
consumed on an average one hundred
and fiftv grams of tobacco every day,
yet he lived to the prime age o 98.
His last will and testament was
traordinary. After bequeathing
worldly goods to his relatives, he
rected how he should be buried
ex-
his
di-
as
follows: "1 wish that ail my friends
who are smokers shall be especially in
vited to my funeral. Each of them
shall receive a package of tobacco and
two pipes, and they are lequested to
smoke uninterruptedly during the fu
neral ceremonies. My body shall be
enclosed in a coffin lined with the
wood of my old cigar boxes. Beside
me in my c&sket shall be laid my fa
vorite meerschaum, a box or matches
and a Dackage dt '.tobacco. When my
body isjowered into the grave every
person present is requested to pass by
and cast upon it the ashes from his
pipe." These touching requests were
faithfully complied with. His friends
attended in nrodicous numbers, and at
Jthe funeral the smoke was so dense
that a horn had to be blown to enable
the mourners to find the door.
His Unavailing Search.
"Well, James Henry Williams, did
you enjoy yourself at the seaside?"
"Yes, teacher, very much. I liked the
sea, but I couldn't find the inthemis."
"The what, James Henry William?"
"The inthemis, teacher; where it says
in the Bible, 'The sea and all that in
them is. "
RELIGIOUS.
If the workers'can he secured a
Bible school will.be organized at the
Stony Point school house next Sunday
afternoon at three o'clock. If you aie
interested in doing any good along this
line of,work in this community you
are requested to come.
MATRIMONIAL.

Comnarative J
Digestibility
of Food I
Made with different Baking Powders
From a Series of Elaborate Chemical Tests:
An equal quantity of bread (biscuit) was made
with each of three different kinds of baking powder
cream of tartar, phosphate, and alum and submitted
separately to the action of the digestive fluid, each
for the same length of time.
The relative percentage of the food digested is
shown as follows:
Bread made with
Royal Cream of Tartar Powder:
100 Per Cent.
Bread made with
phosphate powder:
684 Per Cent.
Bread made with
alum powder:
iimiiiiiMi.il ii i in hi in i i
67sk Per Cenx.
These tests, which are absolutely reliable and
unprejudiced, make plain a fact of great importance
to everyone : Food raised with Royal, a cream of
tartar Baking Powder, is shown to be entirely diges
tible, while the alum and phosphate powders are found
to largely retard the digestion of the food made from
them.
Undigested food is not only wasted food, but it
is the source of very many bodily ailments.
