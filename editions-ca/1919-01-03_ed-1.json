J good prices for such and by the use
of improved implements or ail Kinas,
the crops have been raised and put
on the market at good prices. The
drouth in the mid-summer that look
ed as if it would ruin everything was
soon forgotten when the rains came,
together with the delightful weather,
which has continued until tne past
few days, enabling the farmers to get
their wheat and small gram sown,
their corn housed and their tobacco
ready for the market, which opened
some time ago.
The Paris tobacco market grows
better each year, as has been amply
evidenced by the good prices obtain
ed at decent sales. The enterprising
men sX the head of the warehouses
have left nothing undone to make
their plans as up-to-date as possible,
employing large and competent cleri
cal and handling forces to take care
of the consignments. Railroad facil
ities have been improved and two
large new redrying plants con
structed, helping in the handling of
all tobaccos, especially the lower
grades.
Farm lands, and in fact, real es
tate of all kinds, have advanced very
materially in the past year. Hardly
a wwlt nasses that sales are not re
corded of houses or lands at prices
much better and some double those
of former years. Notwithstanding
the high cost of building materials of
all kinds a number of handsome new
residences have been built, and now
that the flu ban has been raised,
many more are planned for the com
ing year. There are very few, if any,
vacant houses or store rooms in Paris
for rent.

The belated Christmas shopper had
a hard time of it. The Paris stores
were crowded, and Hhe last-minute

process had left them very little

a newspaper man, former State Leg
islator, at the opening of the morn
insr session of the closing day of the

conditions that have depleted ' tho
ranks of trained educators in the ru
ral districts of Kentucky and declar
ed that only with free text boqks
assuring every cnuu an ampie buppiy
of books could this handicap be over
come.
The statement that under the pres
ent system, text books cost approx
imately ?2 a yearfor each child in
school, against 60 cents a year in
Nashville, where textbooks are fur
nished freeof costjto the parent,

There is more Catarrh in this sec

diseases put together, and for years
it was supposed to be incurable. Doc
tors prescribed local remedies, and by
constantly failing to cure with local
treatment, pronounced it incurable.
Catarrah is a local disease, greatly
influenced by constitutional condi
tions and therefore requires constitu
tional treatment. Hall's Catarrh
