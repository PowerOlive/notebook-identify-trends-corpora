'4THE BOURBON NEWSPUBLISHED EVERY TUESDAY AND FRIDAY IN THE YEAR.y., ,.tJVOLUME XXXVIIPARIS, BOURBON COUNTY, KENTUCKY, TUESDAY, JULY 24. 1917t- t T.'A' ' ' &DRAFT DRAWING COMPLETEDWork of Selecting Bourbon County Boys WhoMust Appear Before Board of Examination Completed.First 278 in this List Will Be First Called, From Which139 Will Be Chosen as Bourbon's Quota.The final assignment of draftingnumbers that will call a certain percent of the flower of Bourboncounty youth to war was made Friday and the returns completed Saturday morning. The change in numbers at Washington created considerable confusion, but after the matter had been straightened out it wascomparatively easy for the boys tofind out where they "are at." Bytaking the numbers as sent in from"Washington and going over registration lists in County Clerk's and theCounty 'Judge's offices THE NEWS isenabled to give its readers thismorning a complete list as compiledfrom those records.There seems to be an impressionthat the colored men registered werenot to go in this call, but this isnot a fact, as we are informed bythe local board that they are included just the same as the others.Exemption Board May Begin DutiesWithin Ten Days Cards NotifyAll In Quota."Wat next?" is the question nowmost vital to the man who was selected in the drawing for the newarmy.If he is physically able, and is notsituated, either by reason of dependents or the nature of his employment that the government will notaccept him, and is willing to servewhere his country calls, there isnothing now to do but to await thesummons beneath the flag.The various exemption boards arenot yet prepared for the process ofweeding out those who ultimatelywill represent Bourbon county inthe legions to give much, perhaps all,that the world "may be safe for democracy." As soon as they receive the nQessary blank, affidavits and so on,and are fortified with the, final instructions for their procedure, theboards will meet and begin tne worn.It is expected that ten days willelapse before the official lists of thosedrafted in the first allotment are received by the respective district exemption boards.As soon as these are received eachman who has been selected in thedouble quota will receive a card notifying him officially of his selectionand fixing the date of his appearance"before the board, although a merenrvctinp- nf thA TiampR nf those draftedconstitutes sufficient notification un-der the law. The man so -notifiedthen must appear before the boardon the date named and be physicallyexamined.This examination will follow thegeneral lines of the new physical requirements for the regular army.Two doctors, acting independentlyand without knowledge of the other's findings, must concur in theopinion that the subject is physicallydisqualified. The government mayappeal this decision at any time andnave regular army doctors pass onthe case. Two doctors acting only incase there is as many as 80, per day.How Order Comes. .If the man is found physically fitand qualified and the man is notdischarged or exempted for otherreasons, his name later will be posted as one of those accepted for military service, and when the call tocolors comes he must report at thespecified mobilization camp.In the case of Kentucky men thiswill be at Camp Taylor. If the manlias a claim for exemption or discharge he must file that with theDistrict Board -seven days after thedate of the notice that called himfor physical examination, not sevendays after the date upon the notice.He then has ten days in which tofile affidavits supporting his claim,the blanks to be furnished by thehoard. The board will endeavor topass upon each case three days afterthe affidavits are received. If theclaim is allowed the man is given acertificate of exemption or discharge,T)ut this becomes inoperative whenever the conations upon which it wasgranted cease to apply.If his claim for exemption is notsupported, he is posted as one qualified for service and the man thenhas three days in which to appeal tothe district exemption board. If that"body does not allow his appeal hecan appeal to the President and ifthe President turns Tiim down, he hasnothing to do then but kiss his relatives good-bye.Claims for either discharge or exemption can be filed either by theman himself or by another person,affected by his being called, such ashis wife or mother.139 Drafted Prom Bourbon County.To relieve a persistent misapprehension, it may be pertinent to repeat that only 139 men will bedrafted from Bourbon county.Double these numbers (273) willbe called to appear before the "boards jof exemptions. The man wnose number first was drawn at Washingtonwill be the first examined by theboard and the others in the order ofdrawing.The county may be taken as an example of every military district inthe United States. Those in thefirst 139 whose claims to exemtionare sustained will leave that manyvacancies to be supplied from the reserve 139. As soon a3 the totalquota of 139 accepted men is full,all having numbers, further down thelist are automatically exempt justas is the man at the foot of the list.The man who stands last in theroll of 278 could not be called unlessmore than one hundred per cent,above should be exempted. On theother hand, if more than 278 shouldprove immune to service, the examiners will fill vacancies from the below278.The number registered from BourBourbon county to select the quotafrom this county is composed ofSheriff W. F. Talbott, County ClerkPearce Paton and Dr. Silas Evans.There were registered from Bourbon county is 1545. The list asdrawn at Washington appears below:258 Pearce Beatty, Paris.458 H. B.

Look to your kidneys,assist them in their work give themthe help needed.

This is due largely to the- factthat there is no domestic production-wof sugar whatever. In line with hernew policy of raising necessities athome, England has subsidised a company to raise sugar beets and set upa sugar factory. Climate and soilare said to be favorable. A tract of5,600 acres has been set aside.

A commission in the Canadian army awaits him if he returnsto join his old command. In the firstand second articles he graphically describes his training, his trip to Franceand the elaborate picparations madefor a bomb raid on the German trenches.AS we climbed out of the shelterof our trenches for niy first and,perhaps, my last, 1 thought adventure in No Man's Lrand the wordwas passed:"Over the top and give 'em hell!"That is the British Tommies' battlecry as they charge the enemy, and ithas often sounded up and down thoselong lines in western France as theBritish, Canadian and Australian soldiers go out to the fight and the death.We were divided into six parties often men, each party having separateduties to perform. We crouched forward, moving slowly in single file,stumbling into shell holes and overdead men some very long dead andmanaging to keep in touch with each"Over the top -and give 'em hell!"other though the machine gun bulletsbegan to drop men almost immediately-Once we were started we wereneither fearful nor rattled. We hadbeen drilled so long and so carefullythat each man knew just what he wasto do, and he kept right on doing itunless he got hit To me it seemedthe ground was moving back underme. The first ten yards were thetoughest. The thing was perfectly organized. Our first party of ten wascomposed of signalers. They were paying out wires and carrying telephonesto be used during the fifteen minutesof our stay in the German trenchesin communicating with our battalionheadquarters. A telephone code hadbeen arranged using the names of ourcommanding officers as symbols. "Bexford 1" meant "First prisoners beingsent back;" "Bexford 2" meant "Ourfirst wounded being sent over;" "Bexford 3" meant "We have entered German trench." The code was very complete, and the signalers had been drilled in it for a week. In case the telephone wires were cut, the signalerswere to send messages back by theuse of rifle grenades. These are rifleprojectiles which carry little metalcylinders to contain written messagesand which burst into flame when theystrike the earth, so that they can beeasily found at night. The officer incharge of the signalers was to remainat the point of entrance, with his eyeson his watch. It was his duty to sounda warning signal five minutes beforethe end of our time in the Germantrenches.The leader of every party of ten alsohad a whistle with which to repeatthe warning blast and then the finalblast, when each man was to dropeverything and get back of our artillery fire. We were not to leave anydead or wounded in the German trenchon account of the information whichthe Germans intent thus obtain. Before starting on the raid we had removed all marks from our persons, including even our identification disks.Ercept for the signalers, each party ofteu was similarly organized. First,lucre '.tere two bayonet men, eachwith an electric flashlight attached to"his rifle, so as to give light for the diThe Thrill and the Hell ofthe Trenches, Describedby an American Boy.Sergeant Alexander McClintock of Lexington, Ky., and the Canadian Army HasGripping Tale That Every American WillEead, For He Tells the Facts Unadorned.

Besides his rifle, allof these men carried six or eight MillsNo. 5 hand grenades, weighing from apound and five ounces to a1 pound andseven ounces each.The Lineup.They are the same shape as a' turkeyegg and a little larger. Upon withdrawing the firing pin a lever sets afour second fuse going. One of thesegrenades will clean out anything living in a ten foot trench section. Itwill also kill the man who is throwingIt if he holds it more than four seconds after he has pulled the pin. Thethird man of each ten was an expertbomb thrower, equipped as lightly aspossible to give him freedom of-action.He carried a few bombs himself,but the main supply was carried bythe fourth man, who was not to throwany unless the third man became acasualty, in which case No. 4 was totake his place. The third man alsocarried a knob kerrie, a heavy bludgeonto be used in whacking an enemy overthe head. Ours were made by fastening heavy steel nuts on a stout stickof wood, a very businesslike contrivance. The fourth man, or bomb carrier, besides having a large supply ofMills grenades, had smoke bombs, tobe used in smoking the Germans outof dugouts and later, if necessary, incovering our retreat, and also fumitebombs. The latter are very dangerousto handle. They contain a mixture ofpetrol and phosphorous and weighthree pounds each. On exploding theyrelease a liquid fire which will burnthrough steel.The fifth, sixth, seventh and eighthin line were called utility men. Theywere to take the places of any of thefirst four who might become casualties. In addition they carried twoStokes gun bombs each. These weighnine pounds apiece, have six secondfuses and can be used in wreckingdugouts. The ninth and tenth menwere sappers, carrying slabs of guncotton and several hundred yards ofinstantaneous fuse. This explosive isused in demolishing machine gun emplacements and mine saps. The sappers were to lay their charges whilewe wre at work in the trenches andexplode them as soon as our party wasfar enough out on the return journeyto be safe from this danger. In addition to these parties of ten there werethree of us who carried bombs and hadorders to keep near the three officers,to take the place of any one of themthat might go down and meanwhile touse our own judgment about helpingthe .jolly old party along. I was assigned one of the three.In addition to the raiding partyproper there wras a relay call acrossNo Man's Land at ten paces interval,making a chain to show us our wayback, to assist the wounded and, Incase of opportunity or necessity, to reenforce us. They were ordered not toleave their positions when we beganto come back until the last man of ourparty had been accounted for. Thefinal section of our entourage was composed of twelve stretcher bearers, whohad been specially trained with us, sothat they would be familiar with thetrench section which we were to raid.The Raid and Its Eesult.There were two things which madeit possible for our raiding party to getstarted across N6 Man's Land. Onewas 'the momentary quickening of theblood which follows a big and unaccustomed dose of rum, and the otherW Were Crawling About on All Fours.was a sort of subconscious, mechanicalconfidence in our undertaking, whichwas a result of the scores of times wehad gone through every prearrangedmovement in our practice duplicateGerman trenches behind our lines.Without either of those influences welimply could not have left the shelteri ud faced what was before us.An intensified bombardment fromour guns began just as soon as wetad climbed "over the top" and werelining up for the journey across. "Lin-ms up" is not just a. suiUble term.We -were crawling about on all foursJust far enough out In No Man's Landto be under the" edge of the GermanBhell fire and taking what shelter wecould in shell holes while our leaderspicked the way to start across. Theextra heavy bombardment had warnedthe Germans that something was aboutto happen. They sent up star shellsand "S O S" signals until there wasa glare over the torn earth like thatwhich you see at the grand finish of aPain's fireworks display, and meanwhile they sprayed No Man's Landwith streams of machine gun fire. Inthe face of that we started.It would be absurd to say that wewere not frightened. Thinking mencould notvhelp but be afraid. If wewere pallid, which undoubtedly wewere, the black upon our faces hid it,but our fear struck voices were notdisguised. They trembled and ourteeth chattered.We sneaked out single file, makingour way from shell hole to shell hole,nearly all the time on all fours, crawling quickly over the flat places betweenthis small shelter. The Germans hadnot sighted us, but they were squirtingmachine gun bullets all over the placepromiscuously, like a man watering alawn with a garden hose, and theywere bound to get some of us. Behindme I heard cries of pain and groans,but it made little impression on mybenumbed intelligence from the merefact that whatever had happened hadhappened to one of the other sectionsof ten and not to my own. It seemed,some way or other, no affair to concern me. Then a man in front of medoubled up suddenly and rolled into ashell hole. That simply made me remember very clearly that I was notto stop on account of it. It was someIt Seemed That the Whole Earthhind Me Rose In the Air.Be-one else's business to pick that manup. Next, accoiding to the queer psychology of battle, I began to lose mysensation of fear and nervousness.After I saw a second man go down Igave my attention principally to a consideration of the irregularities of theGerman parapet ahead of us, pickingout the spot where we were to enterthe tiench.- It seerus, silly to say it,but I seemed to get some sort of satisfaction out of the realization that wehad lost the percentage which wemight be expected to lose going over.Now, it seemed, the rest of us weresafe until we should reach the nextphase of our undertaking. I heard directions given, and I gave some myself. My voice was firm. It surprisedme, and I felt almost calm. Our artillery had so torn up the German barbwire that it gave us no trouble at all.We walked through it with only a fewscratches. When we reached the low,sandbag parapet of the enemy trenchwe tossed in a few bombs and followed them right over as soon as they hadexploded. There wasn't a German insight They were all in their dugouts.But we knew pretty well where everydugout was located, and we rushed forthe entrances with our bombs. Everything seemed to be going just as wehad expected it to go. Two Germansran plump into me as I was roundinga ditch angle with a bomb in my hand.They had their hands up, and each ofthem yelled:"Mercy, kamerad!"I passed them back, to be sent to therear, and the man who received themfrom me chuckled and told them tomove lively. The German trencheswere practically juSt as we had expected to find them, according to oursample. They were so nearly similarto the duplicate section in which wehad practiced that we had no tioublefinding our way in them. I was justthinking that really the only toughpart of the job remaining would begetting back across No Man's Landwhen it seemed that the whole earthbehind me rose in the air. For a moment I was stunned and half blindedby dirt blown into my face. When Iwas able to see I discovered that allwhich lay behind me was a mass ofupturned earth and rock, with hereand there a man shaking himself orscrambling out of it or lying still.Just two minutes after we went intotheir trench the Germans had exploded a mine under their parapet. I havealways believed that in some way oranother they had learned what spotwe were to raid and had prepared forus. Whether that's true or not, onething is certain that mine blew ourorganization, as we would say in Kentucky, ."plumb to h L" And it killedor disabled more than half of ourparty.Great Confusion.There was much confusion amongthose of us who remained on our feet.Some one gave an order to retire, andtome- one countermanded it. MoreIrcrmans came out of their dugouts,sut instead of surrendering as per ourSrlginal schedule they threw bombs'impng us. T became apparent thatv would be killed or captured if westuck there and that we wouldn't getany more prisoners. I looked at mywrist, watch and saw that there remained but five minutes more of thetime which had been allotted for ourstay In the trench, so I blew my whistle and started back. I had seen Private Green (No. 177,250) knocked downby a bomb hi the next section, and Ipicked him up and carried him outover the wrecked parapet. I took shelter with him in the first shell hole, butI found that he was dead and left himthere. A few yards farther back toward our line I found Lance CorporalGlass in a shell hole with part of hiship shot away. He said he thought hecould get back if I helped him, and Istarted with him. Private Hunter,who had been in a neighboring shellhole, came to our assistance, and between us Hunter and I got Glass toour front trench.We found them lining up the survivors of our party for a roll call. Thatshowed so many missing that MajorLewis, formerly of the Montreal Star,called for volunteers to go out in NoMan's Land and try to find some ofour men. Corporal Charleson, PrivateSaunders and I went out. We broughtin two wounded, and we saw a numberof dead, but on account of their blackened faces were unable to recognizethem. The scouts later brought in several bodies.Of the sixty odd men who had started in our party forty-three were foundto be casualties killed, wounded ormissing. The missing list was thelongest. The names of those men weremarked "m. b. k." (missing; believedkilled) on our rolls. I have learnedsince that some few of them have beenreported through Switzerland as prisoners of war in Germany, but most ofthem are now officially listed as dead.All of the survivors of the raidingpart' were sent twenty miles to therear at 7 o'clock, and the noncommissioned officers were ordered to makereports in writing concerning the entire raid. I never slept more than anhour at a time for several days andnights. I would doze off from sheerexhaustion and then suddenly find myself sitting straight up, scared half todeath all over again.There may be soldiers who won'tget scared when they know they arein danger or even when people are being killed right around them, but I'mnot one of them. And I've never metany of them yet. I know a boy whowon the military cross in the battle ofthe Somme, and I saw him on hisknees before his platoon commander,shamelessly crying he was a cowardand begging to be left behind, justwhen the order to advance was given.In this war in every offensive, bigor small, the man who has been trained to throw a bomb thirty j'ards isbusier and more important than thefellow with the modern rifle, whichWill shoot a mile and a half and makea hole through a house. In a goodmany surprising ways this war hasLurried us back to first principlesIlemember a" crusader's mace which Ionce saw in the British museum thatwould make a bang up knob kerrie,much better than the kind with whichthey arm our No. 4 men in a raidingsection.. It had a round iron head,with spikes all over it. I wonder thatthey haven't started a factory to turnthem out.Tricks of Bombing.When the Canadians first introducedbombing the bombs were improvisedout of mess tins, the fuses were cutaccording to the taste and judgmentof the individual bomber, and justwhen the bomb would explode wasmore or less problematical. Frequently the Germans have tossed our bombsback into our trenches before theywent off. That was dangerous and irritating. They can't do that with aMills grenade or any of the improvedfactory made bombs, because the menknow just how they are timed and aretrained to know just how to throwthem. Then the Germans used towork a little bomb trick of their own.They learned that our scouts and raiders were all anxious to get a Germanhelmet as a souvenir. They'd put helmets on the ground in No -Man's Landor in an advanced trench with bombsunder them. In several cases menlooking for souvenirs suddenly becamemere memories themselves.In several raids when bombing wasnew the Canadians worked a trick onthe Germans with extensively fatal effect. They tossed bombs into theGerman trenches with six inch fusesattached. To the Germans they lookedjust like the other bombs we had beenusing, and, in fact, they were all butthe fuses. Instead, of having failedto continue burning, as the Germansthought, those fuses had never beenlighted. They were instantaneous fuses.The ignition spark will travel throughan instantaneous fuse at the rate ofthirty yards a second. A German wouldpick up one of these bombs, select thespot where he intended to blow up afew of us with our own ammonal andthen light the fuse. After that therehad to be a new man in his place.The bomb would explode instantly thelong fuse was ignited.The next dajr when I got up afterthis disastrous raid my bunkie said:"Something sure raised h with burcalculations."

Hewould then ask the identity of theperson answering the phone. Thestenographer or whoever answeredwas told that the company was getting ready to clean their phones bymeans of compressed air, and that itwould be necessary for the phonesto be covered up for a short while,so that the dust that had accumulated on the 'lines and in the instruments would not blow all over theoffice.There was much scurrying around,and one of the victims in her hasteand desperation could find nothingbut a large office towel, with whichshe, proceeded to swath the phone until it looked like a man getting a hottowel in a barber chair. Others tooktable covers or anything else thatcame handy. Calls for their numbersremained unanswered for fear of the"spreading dust."After a time the joker called inperson to see if instructions had beencarried out, and informed the victimthat the work had been completed.The coverings were removed andbusiness proceeded as usual. But thevictims of the joker could detect nodifference in the workings of theirphones. The joke, of course, leakedout, and it would have been an unhappy moment for the practicaljoker if he had happened in thevicinity of those offices a short timeafter it became known.3 P3 ISBOURBON FARMING CONDITIONS.There is a decided improvement incrop conditions in the county sincethe recent rains, followed by hotsunshine. Corn and tobacco, hemp,all the small fruits and garden stuffhave felt the revivifying effects ofthe showers and are growing so fastj they can be heard talking about it.Wheat threshing is the only thinginterfered with by the rains.

The translation is headed "FrenchTrench Philosophy." At the presenttime when there are many anxiouseyes scanning the list in to-day'sNEWS of those who have been selected by number to form Bourbon'sfirst answer to the call to arms, thetranslation is very timely bearing asit does a spirit of philosophy andmatter-of-fact resignation to the necessities of warfare. The translationis an application of sound commonsense home-made philosophy, calmand dignified. It reads as follows:"You have two alternativeseither you are mobilized or you arenot.If not, you have nothing to worryabout.If you are, you have two alternatives either you are in camp or atthe front. k f ,If you are in camp, you havenothing to worry aboutIf you are at the front, you havetwo alternatives either you are inreserve or you are on the fightingline. If in reserve, you have nothing to worry about.If you are on the fighting line,you have two alternatives eitheryou escape or you don't.If you don't, you have nothing toworry about.If you do, you have two alternatives either you get slightly hurtor you get badly hurt.If you don't, you have nothing toworry about.If you do, you have two alternatives either you get slightly hurtor you get badly hurt.If slightly, you have nothing toworry about.If badly, you have two alternativeseither you recover or you don't.If you recover, you have nothing toworry about.If you!dont' and have followed myadvice clear through, you have donewith worry forever.."Q S 1E3CANDIDATES FOR PROMOTIONErastus Bowles, Taylor Chandlerand Lloyd Mann, Louisville andNashville firemen, residents of Paris,were summoned to Covington, Monday to appear before the Master Mechanic for examination.Owing to the probability of manyvaluable men among the engineersbeing drafted for army service in thefirst or second call the Louisville &Nashville is preparing for an emergency by promoting firemen whohave proven competent and trust-wortny to positions as engineers inthe future, or, in other words, making them a reserve.

Theelectric wiring with which it is connected extends to the gear shift andis attached to a brass contact armthat is fastened in a horizontal position to the base of the brake lever.This brass projection is so placedthat when the transmission is throwninto reverse, the gear lever strikesit and causes the horn to operate..By having the tone of the libra enjtirely different from, that oF signalsnow used, the device is made, moreeffective.
