shape and complexion of the handbe either so indifferent or rough Thehand cannot be pretty however shapely it may be by nature if the nails arein any way neglected The nail hasan expression not to say an eloquenceof its own for the social status of aman or woman can easily be detectedby the fashion in which it is shapedcut and cared forFew people know how to take propercare of the nails without the assistanceof the manicure and yet with a smallamount of trouble even the ugliestnails can in a short time becomebeautiful Of course it is difficult toalter the color and shape thereof butwith some attention they may be considerably improved To begin with thehands should always be washed in veryhot water or better yet in warm oatmeal water Patting this a few dropsof tincture of benzoin in the

resin 33 grains groundalum SO grains melted white wax twograins fine carmine These ingredientsshould be thoroughly mixed over aspirit lamp made into a kind of pomatum and preserved in a smallglassor porcelain jar It should be appliedto the nail by a tiny wad of medicatedcotton and allowed to remain for halfan hour The thin membrane at theroot of the nail should then be carefully pushed back with

rapid expansion uponits superior advantages with respect tocoal that is it must have either a navigable water front or be a natural railway receiving and distributing centeror be the natural focus of a coal andiron region All this will be changed inthe great electrical waterfall cities ofthe future The power as a rule willbe produced in the mountains while thecities will be scattered far and wideover the foothills There will be betterair more room better drainage morecivilized conditions of living than isthe case with the present overcrowdedindnstrial beehives built for the mostpart on the swampy deltas or in thevalleys of great rivers Under the pressure of dear coal and with the attraction of cheap water power the face ofEurope will be changed As indicatedby Lord Kelvin the highlands of Scotland will become industrially more important to Great Britain than the comparatively flat midlands SwitzerlandNorway and Sweden the Austrian Tyrol and Transylvania may become theindustrial center of Europe owing totheir superiority in water powerFor the rest the course of manufactures will seek the sources of tKe greatriver or of rivers not great which havea very rapid

the problem offlying1 machines and perpetual motionenthusiasts are almost as plentiful al-though they are inclined to be secretivethrough fear of ridiculeIn secluded barns or in dingy atticsthese inventors labor from year to yearin the hope of one day revolutionizingthe world of machinery In experiments carried far into the night theyspend the money thej have earned during the day with the fullest confidencethat its investment will some time makethem fabulously rich A student ofhuman nature has observed that everyman with an active healthy mind atsome time in his life is caught by theperpetual motion disease or mania andthe one is luckjr who escapes its clutchesafter a few months experiments Thereare men who never recover but godown to old age in poverty while pursuing the phantomEvery machine shop in the countryholds secretsof men who spend fortunesin trying to reverse the laws of mechanicsTo argue with these men who imaginethey are inventors is a useless waste of-timeThe proprietor of a machine shop onthe South side said in speaking of themen who come to him with impossibleschemes I used to argue with themwhen I was younger but I found theonly effect it had was to make themangry and they took their work elsewhere Thev looked on me with suspicion as a man who wanted to discourage them and then steal their ideasNow I build whatever a man brings tome without question and take ordersfrom him as if he were a superior beingIn the scrapyard of this machineshop lie several useless combinationsof wheels and shafts on which inventorshave spent hundreds of dollars whichwould have been saved to them had theypossessed even an ordinary knowledgeof natural laws Inventors of this classseem to have the idea that by multiplying wheelsaud pullies they can in thesame proportion multiply powerA tall slim man with a thin beardsprinkled with gray called at this shopone day- a year or two ago with neatlyexecutcd drawings of a machine hewished to have built On paper it was acombination of a bicycle and horselesscarriage The two rear wheels weretaller than the corresponding wheelsof a wagon Above those wheels was aseat from which the operator was towork the pedals Each pedal was connected with a rod that played into amair cylinder By means of the air thatowould be thus compressed a small engine was to be operated This enginewas designed to transmit power to thewheels After spending a great dealof monvy and several months time thehopeful inventor climbed into his tallseat and with beating heart pressedhis feet to the pedals He not onlyfailed to attain the speedhe had predicted for the initial trip butthe machine would not move at allA farmer who lives a few miles fromChicago and who was willing to spendpart of the money he had made in following the plow in order to make hisson famous came into the shop one dayThe son who was an ordinary conntry lad had been tinkering away on wetdays on a machine that was to pumpwater with practically no work Hisidea was to raise a heavy weight to thetop of a 20 foot tower and allow it topump by means of clock work Thev eight was to be wound up each morning with a few easy turns of a crankThen the owner might go away and letit pump water all day The machine-was built under the direction of theboy and his father hauled it away inhrS farm wagon He never came backto receive congratulations on its2CSSThe inhabitants of a quiet suburbwere greatly interested some time agoby the announcement whispered aboutthat one of their leading citizens hadinvented a pump that would pump it-selfnnpbell the inventor was a lawyerwith a Chicago office and a moderateamount of business His brother JohnVI traveled for an iron house that en-I tled pumps That was supposed toqualify him as a judge from whose decision there was no appeal when he pronounced the pump to be practical Asecond brother named George who hadgone west and become a judge wascalled home to see the invention Hehad faith enough in it to furnish themoney to push itAn old surveyor who had acquired aknowledge of his profession from carrying a chain when a boy was cautiously let in at the back door of the bairnwhere the model had been set up Hegave it his enthusiastic indorsementwhich was supposed to add scientifictestimony to the opinion of the familjr in which it was inventedA retired banker was allowed to lookat it on a promise of secrecy but hewas given to understand that the brothers know a good thing and meant tokeep the entire interest in the familyA few other prominent citizens wereallowed the privilege of viewing thisobject of wonder and there appeared anew division of society in the suburbthe select few who hack seenCampbellspump and the many who had not seenitThe curiosity of the latter class wasroused to the highest pitch by the nrysterious hints from the men who hadseen it but were pledged to secrecy untilthe patent could be properly appliedfor The inventors did not propose tolose the fruits of their own ingenuityCasey who was correspondent forChicago papers asked that courtesiesbe extended to the press and that he bealllowed to look at the pump Thebrothers on consultation granted hisrequest on condition that it would notbe written up until the patent papershad been filedThis is what the newspaper man sawOn the floor of the barn a wooden boxthree feet high was made to serve as awell- Extending up from this improvised well through the ceiling ten feetabove was a six inch iron pipe Working up and down in a cylinder in thebottom of the well this six inch pipeconstituted the pump It soon filledwith water and spilled over the topthrough a spout A handle ten feetlong built like a walking beam of aship operated the pump The handlewas loaded with a box of bricks so as toalmost balance the pump when it wasfull of water When a bucketful hadbeen pumped to the floor above it washanded down through the loft hole andthe inventor hung it on the pump handles end With the long sweep andpowerful leverage afforded the pail ofwater woulcTbring down the handle andpump another bucket of water to theabove Campbell explained thatall that remained to be done was to arrange a simple trip on the bucket abovethat would cause its contents to runinto a pipe that would conduct it to thebucket on the handle of the pumpThis model he confessed was onlya crude working ofl the principleFrom his pocket he drew out a blueprint of a complete pump The blueHE GUARDED HIS INVENTION JEALOUSLYprint represented two pumps workingin wells ten feet apart Each one wasa six inch pipe filled with water Whenone was up the other was down and ashe said they must exactly balance eachother he proposed to furnish the slightpower he considered necessary to workthem by the fall of the water from thetop of the pump to the groundThen you have discovered perpetualmotion observe CaseyXot at all Campbell hastened to reply We are no cranks to think sucha thing as that We have only discovered a new principle in pumpsCasey could not see just then why itwould not work Still he went home adoubter and covered several pages withfigures and drawings before he discovered why the pump would not workThe next day he hunted up Campbellto show him that according to naturallaws the pump must be a failureInstead of being grateful to Caseyf oi pointing out the errors in his plansbefore he had spent any more moneyCampbell became indignant and accused Casey of violating his hospitalityand of belonging to that narrow-mindedclass of bigots who always opposegreat inventors and ridicule new departures vStill said Campbell in parting byway of consolation to himself it is thefate of every man who is ahead of histime to be misunderstoodSo Casey left Campbell to his fateand the latter assisted by his brotherwho had sold pumps with their barndoor locked and the windows shadedworked early and late and spent moneyf umished by thejudge They made application for a patent and the jud ewent back home co look up westernlands that needed irrigation Theyhired men to dig two wells in a creekbottom where it was not far to waterand their illusion was not dispelled until the pumps had been given a trialChicago RecordThe channel that great minds runin is never overcrowded -ChicagoNewsStatusOHIO RIVER LOREof the Crews That ManPittsburgh BoatstfcOther cities may have their iron audjsteel mills their glass houses theirarmor plate factories their foundries5but Pittsburgh possesses an industry ofits own the signs of whose existence arejust now strikingly visible to the ob-server who may cnance to visitMonongahela river wharf Pittsburghs5great business of shipping coal by riverof all the towns in the United StatesRepressed by six months low water ithas aain become evident since the rainsof the last week have filled the Ohio riverto a boating stage depthThe most important phase of preparations for a towboat trip to Kew Orleansis the procuring of the supplies for thedeckhands In hearing the term deckhand the average visitor from an inland town is apt to confound the towboat deckhands with roustabouts Buthere in Pittsburgh the difference between deckhand and roustabout ismarked and the former would resentbeing classed with the latter Theroustabout generally a negro is accustomed to being driven while atworkby the swearing steamboat mate hisfood is brought to him in a tub and heeats it off a tin plate The deckhand insists on being respected no captain ormate curses him on the contrary hisfeelings are carefully regarded for atowboat with a load of coal for thesouthern Mississippi could ill spare thedeckhands who might desert if theywere not well treated The deckhandsservices are in demand only a portionof the year but when needed he isneeded badly The captain who wouldexpect his deckhands to eat from a tinplate would soon find a mutiny on hishands The men work hard all dayand take turns at the watch at nightTheir duties consist of making up thetow for the steamboat that is to conveyit dow n the river and in taking care ofthe tow during the trip Their workis dangerous walking along the edge ofbarges when a single misstep on theplanking would mean- sure death in theicy water or working at breakingbarges cutting loose those that havestruck a snag and must be cut out tosave the rest of the tow from beingwreckedThe average towboat deckhand maylive in bethels and mission lodginghouses during the dull season he maybe satisfied with a ten cent meal during that period but put him on a towboat and he insists on the best of foodand clean sheets He doesnt want thefancy dishes that are served to the passengers on the packets but he desiresthe substantial to be well cookedserved nicely and given to him plentifully All towboat deckhands areAmerican born and as they are in thesouth for a good ipart of the navigationseason thejr have all the southernprejudices against the negro It is related that once a captain against thewarnings of other masters hired anegro as amured when the darky came to workamong them but the3r were petrifiedwhen he sat down to table with themWhen they recovered as it was themost natural thing in the world theman on each side of him to ok him by thearm led him out of the cabin and calmly pitched him overboard The negrowas picked up by a passenger skiff andno more darkies were hired by that captainThe average cook on board a towboatcould fill with ease a similar post on apassenger steamerr The cooks are soperfect in their prof ession that they callthemselves chefs and the deckhandssee so little that is ridiculous in- thename that one speaks of the chef andhis abilit as naturally as if it were atDelmonicosDuring the last few days- scores of xtowboats have taken supplies and a visitorto the wharf could see roustabouts carrying in the best of beef pork muttonand bacon barrels of the finest gradesof flour white sugar by the barrel freshvegetables and eggs by the case Andthe eggs are fresh too The deckhandrecognizes a packed egg with the unerring exactness of an epicure Chicago Initer OceanSTATISTICS ABOUT THE SEACurious Figrnres About Its WeigrhtDepth and VolumeWe take the statements of four goodmen of science a geographer an astronomer a physicist a statisticianadd the statements divide by four andarrive at the result that thesurface ofthe sea is 139 ya millions of square mileshis weight 1332000000000000000 tonsand his volume 322000000 cubic milesA like process will tell us that the average depth of the sea is 12000 feet morethan 2 miles and we know that onecubic foot of him weighs over 04 poundsavoirdupois i e about 4 stone or asmuch as a small child eight or tenyears of age From these figures MrSchooling deduces that the sea is simply nowhere when we compare it withthe land of this planet as regards thesolid quantities of weight depth andvolumeOnly in the superficial quality ofsurface does the sea beat the land Asto beauty there is infinitely more of itand in much greater variety on theland than on the sea To further emphasize the magnificence of the sea wewill now pour it into a jelly mold oneof those thin ornamental tin shapesyou see in the kitchen dresser Forthis experiment I have dug out all theInside of the United Kingdom of GreatBritain and Ireland from its surfaceall the way down to the center of theearth 3960 miles and have thus madethejlargest jelly mold

Infive busy hours 216000 passengerswould represent the number of personscarried in only 30 buildings From thisit may be seen that with thousands ofelevators in use in New York the figuresare enormous

They all have littlepatches of millet however or ofsorghum and those who are employedabout the places where cane is grownare in clover The pickaninnies do notwait for knives when they want to getat the sugary fluid of either sorghumor cane They bite pieces out of thehard rind with their teeth and thenpull the remainder off somehow andbreak the stalk off above a joint byhitting it on a hard

Bulawayo and thereis serious talk of extending the systemto the once m3sterious Zambesi Although we finally succeeded the Dutchas rulers in the Cape Colony in 1S06 itwas not till 1859 that the first railwaywas commenced and extensions wenton slowlyltill the discovery of diamondsin Griqualand West gave an impetus totrade and traffic in South Africa Eventhen the railway halted for years at asleepy town on the edge of the silentKarroo known as Beaufort West andthence the journey had to be made toKimberley according to the means ortastes of the passengers by post cartwith drivers reckless of life and limbthe lumbering stagecoach or prairieschooner drawn by vicious mules orslumberous oxenThere are many prosperous city men-and even millionaires still in theprime of life who well remember thatawful journey across the veldt fromBeaufort West the glaring heat byday the cold by night the lurching5vehicles the whirling sand as it cameadown the breeze the scanty provisions the miserable outspans and atlast the sounds of distant dynamite explosions which bespoke the nearnessof the city of dust and diamonds Themilitary operations in Bechuanalandled to the continuation of the line withthe active assistance of the home government right up to KimberleyMeantime the agricultural districtsof the Cape Colony had been opened upthanks mainly to the pressure whichthe farmers brought to bear on the government of the day and in 1890 the golddiscoveries in the Transvaal led to another spurt in railway building Someof the short lines at the cape passrthrough very beautiful scenery suchas those which run through the pineclad slopes of Wynberg and awajr inthe other direction to Sea Point theBrighton of the cape but for grandeurfew in the world can compare with therailway which climbs the barrier rangeof the Hex Biver mountains The lineascends by wonderful curves and zigzags giving the passengers fearsomeviews of the depths below with thenestling farms and vinejards of the fertile valley Capped with snow the surrounding mountain peaks some ofthem 6000 feet high present a grandappearance and engineering skill haspierced through perpendicular rocksby means of cuttings and

corn on the cob is fed unless ahorses appetite is carefully noted andjust enough is given to him he willeat the cob also and as the cob is moreor less indigestible there is a big chanceof making him sick and losing himIn feeding- a horse care should be takento give him just enough and no moretoo much being almost as bad as toolittleI have just heard of an experiencewith a good horse which proves thetruth of what I have said One of myfriends who has a negro hostler hashad trouble about keeping his horseswell and in good condition owing tothe fact that if the hostler for anyreason lost his temper with one oftrthc horses he gave that horses breakfast dinner or supper to another horseand when the stinted horse got his nextmeal for the negro was afraid to cuthim more than one meal at a time hewould eat cobs as well as the comOne evening some time ago when the-stock came in from work one of thehorses was sick and it was found thathe had indigestion A remedy wasgiven and when after long work onhim the sick animal evacuated a greatnumber of pieces of cob as large as achestnut were found which showedconclusively the cause of the troubleNo blame was attached to the ibstlerat the time but soon after an other negro who had a grudge against the illtempered hostler told how the horseswere treated investigation proved thetruth of the story and the hostler wasdischarged Since that time the horseshave been fed on shelled corn and therehas been no trouble all of them keeping in perfect health and looking wellIt is some trouble and a -slight additional expense to shell the corn forthe horses but it is better to o thisthan to have to sit up for hours witha sick horse and perhaps lose him atlast It is not however a great dealof trouble to me to shell my corn asI use for this purpose a little cornsheller with which ione man can easilyshell a bushel of corn in ten minutesor less I paid three dollars for it andthe work is so light and pleasant thatthe children on the placeenjoy shellinga large part of the corn used for thehorses Cows can eat cobs withoutdanger but horses cannot A horse isa clean and choice animal and moist bemore carefully treated than any

intoa business and fail because of ignorance or lack of knowledge of howto manage and it is seldom that it isdone in mercantile pursuits yet hundreds attempt the poultry business under the supposition that anybody canraise chickens when the fact is thatthe poultry business requires moreskill in management than is requiredin raising cattle or other large stockThe reason is that if a farmer has oneor two cows the small number permitshim to become familiar with each animal He knows their peculiarities thekinds of food preferred by each andshould one of them become sick heqiickly detects it and at once proceedsto use remedies if necessary sittingup all night to take care of it Witha flock of 50 hens however the case isdifferent Although the flock willnot require any more room than onecow yet there are 50 individuals eachbeing entirely different in many respects from the others and alUhavingtheir characteristics and peculiaritiesmaking it much more difficult to understand their requirements The ordinary farmhand seldom notices thepoultry except to occasionally give amess of corn and but few farmers givesufficient personal attention to fullyunderstand the thorough managementof a flock so as to derive the largestprofit therefrom On the large majority of farms the owners do not knowhow many fowls they lose in a yearfrom the numerous causes and dangersand there are also hundreds of farmerswho do not know whether their fowlspay or notIf the beginner perhaps some persouwho desires to -seek a living outside ofa city on a limited capital is to succeedhe must pursue a ccurse which differsfrom that usually practiced on farmsBut how is he to know and how can heanticipate the various conditions under obstacles which he may meetEven a small investment is a great dealwhen it represents all perhaps the savings of years hence the greater necessity for knowledge in going into thapoultry businessIt is possible that a beginner mayhave fair success the first year but as arule such is not generally the caseThe only safe mode is to begin with afew expect no profit the first year andbut little the next devoting the time tolearning without incurring much riskand success will come later Farm andFiresideHUSKING MADE EASYAn Inenions Device That Has NeverBeen PatentedA convenient wagon attachment forhusking corn in the field where it isnecessary to drive

or fail over toone side suddenly at times as rapidlyrecovering or dying immediate Thishappens only when ducks or geese arefed on too much grain The best systemto adopt in summer is to put them in afield where short grass is abundant oreven young weeds and let tiem get thefood for themselves They require butvery little food in summer as they arethen well over the laying period becoming non producers If this fact is keptin view that of the non producers requiring but little food during warftiweather there would be a saving in expenses as well as fewer losses from disease but it is difficult to convince thosehaving good breeds that there is such athing as killing with kindness feedingtoo much Journal of AgricultureThe Most Desirable HocThe most desirable hog is one whichwill
