Policieslhat Are Free I rom War TaxWashington Nov 18 CommissionerWilson of the internal revenue bureau has rendered an important decision in which he holds in effect thatthe policies of life insurance companies which are exempt from taxationundtr the war revenue act are onlysuch as are issued by fraternalsocieties or orders beneficiary societies or orders farmers purely local co operative companies 01associations and employes relief associations operated on the lodge system or local co operative plan andthat the exemption does not apply tcthe policies of life insurance issued bymutual insurance companies per sealthough thy may have features oimutalit3 A further restriction imposed by the law on the exempted companies is that they shall not be conducted for profit The commissionersays in partI am of the opinion that it was theintention of congress to exempt fromtaxation policies of life insurance issued by fraternal societies or ordersand beneficiary societies or orderswhich are operated on plans similar tothe lodge or ritualistic formIt surely can not be said that amutual life insurance company is afraternal society or order or can itbe said that a mutual life company is abeneficiary society or order althoughfraternal and beneficiary societies maybe mutualThis office holds that all insurancecompanies that are doing business onthe old line or fixed premium planwhere policies are issued for a givendefinite fixed or stated premium payable or capable of being estimated inadvance in so far as determining thethe question of taxation on their policies is concerned are organized andconducted for profit whether thepremium is paid by assessment or notA FATHERS CRIMEA Chicago Man Shoots Four of His Chlldren Three of Whom Are DeadThen Commits SuicideChicago Nov 18

such a steady increase in the number of the Indiansbeing educated as to warrant the opinion that the next quarter century willwitness not a diminution of the Indian population but an extinguishment of Indian tribesOne discouraging factor however isdisclosed by the unsatisfactory resultsof the past nine years trial of co-educationof the Indians with the whitesin the public schools The report sa5rsthe results of this co education are notcommensurate with the expenditurethat the idea theoretically is an admirable expedient for breaking downprejudices and civilizing the Indianbut the figures show it is not an unqualified successThe full blood who needs such contact most is rarely secured and thegroundwork at least of Indian education must be laid under the governments auspices and control

had been drinking He attempted to draw a revolver from hisbelt but by this time he was surrounded by angry men who had been attracted to the spot by the outcryHe was seized by a dozen pairs ofhands and his weapons removed Atfirst he attempted to straggle tout themuzzle of a revolver pressed close tohis temple and a few cries of Lynchhim completely sobered him and henow looked fearfully about him at thestern faces which beset him on everysideWhatll we do with him boysshouted a broad shouldered giant whoappeared to be a leading- spiritHang the scamp cried a voice nearbyXonsense returned the big fellowWhat tenderfoot is talking now Itsno hanging matter to kiss a girl Letsduck him in the salt waterA wild veil of delight greeted thisproposition and the trembling wretchwas dragged off toward the beach without ceremonyTom and his friend were about to return to their tent when a hand waslaid timidly on his arm and he turnedto find himself confronted by the innocent cause of the trouble who saidfranklyI thank you sir for your help Theman seized me from behind so suddenlythat I screamed before 1 knew what 1was doing My fathers tent is closeby and I just came out after somewaterTom gazed with admiration at thegirl before him Some one had thrownan armful of wood on a fire a short dislance away and by the flickering lighthe could see her distinctly She was apparent-about IS years old with a lowbroad forehead large blue eyes whichmet his freely cheeks flushed with theexcitement and a mouth which whiletoo large perhaps for classic beautylooked none the less bewitching Shewas dressed in a tight vfittiug waist andshort skirt her ankles protected byleggings while a pair of stout shoescovered her feetThe young man took all this in at aglance as he repliedThats nothing I happened to gethere first Would you like to have mesee you safe to jour tentThe girl laughed and said quicklyOh theres no danger I was careless Ive got a revolver and I knowhow to use it I shall look out afterthis The man was drunk anywayIm safe hereAs she spoke she nodded brightly atTom and turned to go but at that instant a middle aged man hurried forward and exclaimedClara What is this I hear WhohasIts all right father interruptedthe young girl lajing her hand affectionately on his arm Theres nothingthe matter at all A man had beendrinking and tried to interfere with mebut this gentleman knocked him downThen the rest came and took the rascaloff to duck him thats allThats enough I should say wasthe reply and turning to Tom the manextended his hand sayingI thank you young uian Its

JohnWhat do you know of John Averysaid he at length looking Tom full inthe face as if he doubted the evidenceof his OTvn earsI sailed with him from Boston lastwinter was the prompt reply MrGreen hre was the second mate of thevessel We came round Cape HornAnd where is he nowTom was silent He knew not how totell the sad news and looked helplesslyat his partner who dropped his eyesWhy dont you speak Has anythinghappened to himTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY TUESDAY NOVEMBER 21 1899The mans voice was husky and hetook a tlep forwardWe buried him at sea said Tom ina broken voice in which the other

VIIION TUZ DALTON TRAILThe two young men followed him insilence When they reached the tentTom repeated the story of his acquaintance with the old miner touching aslightly as- possible on the two occasions in which he had risked his ownLife but a pair of blue eyes were fixedupon him all the while and the girlsface showed that she fully appreciatedand admired IjisdaringHer father made but few interruptions until Tom described the deathbedscene ard then he saidHave you the papers nowNo replied Tom but I know themby heart I was waylaid and robbedin San Francisco See here is the scarAs tie spoke he bent his- head andthen went onWe have reason to believe the mateof the vessel a man named Rider heardwhat your brother said to me when bewas dying and that he was the rascalwho nearly killed me and took thepapers He disappeared and we thinkhe came here and started up the trailto pass himself off as the rightful owner of the will He has had a long startand may be there before thisAvery waa silent for a moment andthen he said franklyI dont want to doubt your wordScott but I must take every precaution Hefore I admit anything tell mewhat the letter to John said and whatit was signedTom promptly complied and apparently convinced the other for he extended his hand exclaimingIts all right and you shall haveJohns share if lean help you Shall wego on together I have been waitinghere a week in hopes to run across Tarbox He waa coming down after supplies this monthI think wed better start at oncesaid Tom We may meet him and besides I feel sure the mate is there somewhereWould you know this man Tarbox ifyou saw him added TomXo was the reply Hes a newpartner Taylor has picked up out hereDo you know TaylorO yes We were all out together inthe California mines in the 50s PoorJohn was one of us Dick Taylor lovedhim as though hed been his brothertoo Itll be sad news for him to hearvour storvaIt was late that night when Tom andGreen returned to their tent It hadbeen decided to make sure that theman had not arrived from the mineand should they be unable to hear ofhim they were to start on the day fallowingThe sailor threw himself 5own on hisbed of boughs and was asleep almost instantly but Tom Scott could see a pairof blue ewes when his own were tightlyshut His dreams that night were asad jumble of gold mines and fair damsels in distress and he awoke but littlerefreshedThe day was spent in quiet butfruitless inquiries for the man theysought and the following morning alittle caravan filed away from the harbor toward the wild northern countryTom led the way on his horse the packhorses came next Aver and his daughter followed and Green brought up therearThe Dalton trail is over an undulating country all the way to Fort- Selkirkand can easily be traveled on horsebackthe entire distance of some 7o mileswhich relieved our travelers of the hardships attendant upon the other trailsand it was with a light heart that Tomlooked back over the well fitted stringof animals and exclaimedIf we can only meet the man fromthe mine we shall be in luck We haveprovisions enough for all handsHe would not have felt so happy couldhe have known that at that momentthe man he mentioned was seated by acampfirewith Rider and his companionreading John Averys1 will and the letterwritten by Dick TaylorLeaving Tom and his party fairly ontheir way we must return to ObedRider and his new friend who werepushing forward as fast as possibleTheir undue liaste the first day hadproved disastrous for one of their packhorses had gone lame and they wereobliged to

stopping his mouthAs he spoke he dropped his hand significantly to the butt of the heavy reolvcr at his hip and his face tookon such an evil look that the matesblood ran cold in his veins ne beganto feel decidedly uneasy in this manscompany What assurance had he thatthis unscrupulous ruffian would nottreat him in the same manner after hisends were servedA if reading his thoughts Bowerslaughed hoarsely and exclaimedWhats the matter Rider FraidIll go back on yer Dont wocry along as yer use me on the square Illstick ter yer but yer too chicken hearted for a job like thisThe day had been very warm andsunny for summer comes all at once inthis part of the country They hadbuilt a small fire to make their coffeeand were lying in their tent where theycould command quite a view of the trailahead It was still light and as thespeaker glanced carelessly over the valley in which they had halted heuttereda sharp exclamation and sprang to hisfeetThars something movinover tharhe said quickly shading his eyes withhis hand as if to aid his vision Its aman an hes afoot head in1 fer ourtire jest as sores yer born Ten dollarsOh father he knows Uncle Johnter one its our man Remember youreMister Tom Scott and dont make amess of itKider soon saw a dark figure drawingnear them and wheu it was but a fewrods away a mans voice shoutedHello responded Bowers steppingfrom the tentThe stranger came rapidly towardhim and there was light enough to reveal a powerfully built man of middleage who wore a small pack on hisback and carried a serviceable lookingrevolver at his belt His beard waslong and unkempt but he walked witha long swinging step which told ofunimpaired vigorWhen he reached the tent he lookedsharpl at the two men As has eyesrested upon Riders companion a puzzled look eame into them for an instantbut he said heartilyHello mates which way are youboundUp this way replied Bowers jerking his thumb in the direction fromwhich the stranger had appearedUoirg up the Yukon wayXot

the replyThats tough Heres a pipe JoinusHis manner was so cordial and frankthat Rider looked at him in wonderThe stranger f agerly accepted the pipeand for a few moments sat in silencedrawing huge puffs of the fragrantweed with an enjoyment which fairlyspoke for itselfSuddenly Riders companion slappedhis thigh as though he had justthought of something wonderful andturning to the mate with a look ofwarning exclaimedBy thunder Scott you dont suppose this isHe stopped in the middle of the sentence and looked searchingly at thestranger then continuedIt would be funny wouldnt ItScott if we had met him out here Youknow the letter said he was comindown this month ter grubThe stranger looked wonderingly atthe two men and Bowers hastened tosayExcuse me stranger but mightyour name be TarboxThe man took his pipe from lipsand stared at the speaker for full a second before replying then he repliedIt might be and it is Hoy did youknow meAn yer pardners name is 1 ayiorThis time the man wa s too astonishedto reply and Bowers went onYoure goin ter Dyea after grub anback in the hills Aint that allstraightJoe Tarbox rose to his feet and laidhis hand on his weapon saying in aquiet toneThat is correct but its my turn toask questions now now did you findall this outBowers turned to the mate and saidpromptlyTom old man you tell him ouryarn an let him see the documentsThatll sioon put things straightMy name is Scott said Rider Iwas an officer on the ship where a mannamed John Avery died lie was coming out here on account of a letter froman old chum of his named Dick TaylorThe

with a small adventure he hadmany years ago in the Rock mountainsThe first month or two of the trip hadbeen spent on the plains of Nebraskaand Wyoming at that time the huntingground of Sioux and Cheyennes whowere bitterly hostile and signs ofwhose presence near the commandwere often seen The whole party realized that they were in a dangerouscountry and all hands were constantlyon the watch for enemies and werecareful not to wander far from thecommand or if two or three fossilgatherers did go off from the mainbody they took with them a number ofsoldiers to stand guard while theyworked After leaving this dangerousregion the expedition moved on to thebad lands near Fort Bridges wherethere were but few Indians and thosefriendly ones and the work of gathering fossils went onOne day Prof Marsh was hard atwork on his kuees in the bottom of thenarrow ravine digging away the soilfrom a bone which stuck out of thebank He was entirely absorbed in histask and noticed nothing of what wasgoing on about him until the brilliantsunlight which poured down on himwas cut off by a dark shadow and helooked up to see standing above him agreat grim Indian warrior holding hisrifle at ready The professors heartleaped into his throat He forgot wherehe was He strove to utter a propitiatory How but his dry lips refused toform the word and he could only swallow trying to get rid of the lump in histhroat Suddenly the savage bent toward him and spoke Have I thehonor of addressing Prof OthneilCharles Marsh the eminent paleontologist of Yale college he inquiredThe revulsion of feeling was

atany time 1 found everything in firstclass shape and the total expense hadbeen slightly over 2100 As to anyfurther experiences 1 shall have torefer you to my friend Epkins herewho spent several weeks with me andhad more leisure time to look for curious thingsAs to that said Mr Epkins I ownup to having had a deal of time at mydisposal but as to experiences theywere few and far between 1 spent thegreater part of the time when theweather would permit in fishing Fishing is not apt to lead a truthful maninto very many experiences out of theordinary We had very good luckthough and one forenoon we caughtsix bass trolling around the lakeDo they allow the bass to trollaround the lake unattended askedthe chairman Or do you mean to intimate that while trolling around thelake you caught six bas-Put it any way you like said Epkins Anyway we caught the sixbass and some of them were whoppers1 am confident that one of them atleast weighed a pound and a half 1had one other bass hooked and well uptoward the boat when iie gave a lungeand carried off my hook spoon andeverything ele but then he was alittle fellow weighing perhaps abouta half pound and the loss of him didntiake much difference to the totalTodd and 1 had a most delightfultime this summer said Mr JorkinsTogether we went up here to a littlesummer resort in southern Wisconsinand put up at a farmers house thatwas advertised as clean and comfortable good beds fine food and all thatsort of thing combined with a lowrute We paid a dollar a day had separate beds with hair mattresses andgooC springs and all the eggs and milkand chickens that we wanted We didnot see a mosquito while we were thereand the weather for the most partwas delightful The proprietor had aclean shaven chin and spoke good English and had read David llarum Wdid not do much fishing although weunderstood there was pretty good fishing at the lake We saw one party offour bring in a string of 18 perch andsunfish that had been caught duringthe dayI met an interesting character during July said Mr Pope My wifeand 1 were enjoying ourselves onemorning cleaning house when aragged looking individual whom I suppose might be called a tramp put inand asked for materialan appearanceassistance He told a sad tale of beinc out of work for 14 consecutivelaoiiths and sc on1 asked kiui if heTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY TUESDAY NOVEMBER 21 1899was willing to do a little hard worMif we should give him some food andhe exhibited a remarkable and suspicious willingness to do so Accordingly I told him if he would beat thedining room carpet thoroughly wewould give him a square meal Much toour surprise he doffed his melancholyremnant of a coat and went to workIn less than an hour the carpet wasthoroughly cleaned and he then askedpermission to take a bath before eating1 conducted him to the bathroom ancsuperintended a very thorough bathon his part and then loaned him mjrazor and outfit while he took a cleanshave By that time he presented avery respectable appearance and wewere pleased to have him stay severaldays with us he doing a number oimuch needed jobs about the place during his stayDuring the recital of Mr Popes storyMr Keek had passed cigars to a number of the members sitting near himand the cigars had been lighted Aasoon as Mr Pope had finished speakingthe smokers all broke out in expressions of admiration for the quality andflavor of the cigars and made inquiriesas to where they had been purchasedI really do not know gentlemensaid Mr K ek 1 seldom pay any attention whatever to my supply otcigars My vwfe always buys them forme and there is always a good supplyin the house Mrs Keek is very fondof the smell of smoke in the house andis a connoisseur in the matter of purchasing cigars These are some froa box she presented me with on mlast birthday I am glad you likethem She told me at the time 1 recollect that she had purchased a littlemore expensive ones than usual becauseshe had discovered that her last yearssilk skirt would do very well for thisyear with a little making over andso I would be entitled to a little extravagance in the matter of cigarsThere was ominous silence for someseconds but no one seemed to have themoral courage to make any remonstrance as Mr Keek walked up to thedesk somewhat ostentatiously and deposited his affidavitTne most fun 1 had during my

ofTransportation Foreign Conntries Baying Oar LocomotivesDevelopment of the WestOne of our great writers has said ofthis closing period of the nineteenthcentury that it is an age of transportation Transportation underlies material prosperity in every department ofcommerce Without transportationcommerce would be impossible Thosestates and nations are rich powerfuland enlightened whose transportationfacilities are best and most extendedThe dying nations are those with littleor no transportation facilitiesThese were a part of the openingwords of an address delivered beforethe I nternational Commercial congressrecently held in Philadelphia byGeorge H Daniels General PassengerAgent of the New York Central cc Hudson River railroad and president of theAmerican Association of General Pas-senger Agentslie then went on to quote Mr Mulhallthe British statistician who in his workon The Wealth of Nations said of theUnited States in 1895 Ti we take asurvey of mankind in ancient or modern times as regards the physical mechanical and intellectual force of nations we find nothing to compare withthe United StatesMr Mulhall proved b his statisticsthat the working power of a single person in the United States was twice thatof a German or Frenchman more thanthree times that of an Austrian and fivetimes that of an Italian Ke said theUnited Slates was then the richestcountry in the world its wealth exceeding that of Great Britain by 35 percent and added that in the historv ofthe human race no nation ever before41000000 of instructed citizens Should Mr Mulhall revise his figures to oay tne cuiierences wouict anbe in favor of the United States for in Ithe past IS months we have demonstrated the superiority of our manufactures in every direction and ourabilitjto cope successfully with questionsv hich have heretofore been handled exclusivelj by the older nations is nowrecojrnizi d by all the vvorldMr Daniels told of a lettei he had received from a friend in Tokio writ leuonly a short time ago in which was thissignificant sentence You will be interred in knowing that I have hanging on the wall of my office a framed picture of your Empire State Expressand we expect in the near future to behauling a Japanese Empire Expresswith an American locomotive Thehave now in Japan more than 100 locomotives that were built in the UnitedStates In Russia they have nearly1000 American locomotives and practically every railway in Great Britainhas ordered locomotives from this country since the beginning of the war withSpainBut it is not alone our locomotivesthat have attractod the attention of foreigners who have visited our shoresour railwaj equipment generally hascommanded admiration and is now receiving the highest compliment namely imitation by many sister nationsThe demand for American locomotives from all parts of the world MrDaniels attributed in the first placeto the superior quality of our machinery and in the second to the factthat the general passenger agents ofthe American railways have throughtheir advertising made the marvelousresults accomplished by our locomotives household words in every countryon the globeThe emperor of Germany in hisspeech to the Prussian diet in Januarylast said Mr Daniels did not lay thegreatest stress upon the necessity forincreasing the army or for the construction of additional ships for thenavy but he did impress upon his hearers the great importance of extendingthe railroads and the navigable canalsIn order that the German nation mighthave knowledge of the most advancedtheories and

he could in the matter of helping the tenants at times whenthey wished to entertain parties offriends I think thatMr Chairman interrupted Mr Bilton I think that owing to the inclemency of the weather we would better adjourn Without wishing to cast anyreflections on Brother Tisers remarksit may still not be amiss to say thatthere is a limit to everything I moveyou sir that we do now adjournThe motion was carried unanimouslyand after the usual closing exercisesthe club adjourned at S50 p m and themembers went immediately to their respective cars Chicago Daily Recordas compared wStates Thev recommended the adoplion of many of our methods explaining in their report that they were farsuperior not only to those in vogue inGermany but also superior to those ofany other countryOne of the

hazardous mountain passes of the western part of thecontinent The completion of the Pacific railroads changed all tlrs andopened new fields for all kinds of enterprises in an unexplored territorystretching over more than 2000 milesto the west northwest and southwestof the Mississippi river the products ofwhich region were practically valuelessuntil the means of transporting hemwere provided by the railroads I hewheat crop of California this year is00 bushels The largest cropever produced in California was in 11when owing to exceptionally favorableweather conditions that state produced63000000 bushels The gold output ofCalifornia for the year 1899 is estimatedat 10000000 The vineyards and orange groves of California would be ofpractically little value were it not forthe fact that the railroads by theirtrains of refrigerator and ventilatedcars make it possible to transport theproducts of her fertile valleys to all sections of the countryIt seems but yesterday that the raliroads were completed into PortlandOre Tacoma and Seattle Wash and itis marvelous that for the year endedJune 30 1S99 there was exported fro nthe Columbia River valley 16000000bushels of wheat and from the Pugetsound region 10000000 bushels Oregon and Washington form the northwest corner of the territory of theUnited States south of the line of British Columbia and are directly on theroute to our extreme northwest possession Alaska The wheat crop of thestates of Oregon and Washington forthe year 1899 is 48600000 bushels Therewas exported during the year endedJune 30 1S99 from the Columbia riverdirect to foreign ports 1100000 barrelsof flour and from Puget sound points800000 barrelsColorado which with its inexhaustible mines of gold silver lead iron andcoal forms almost an empire in itselfwill produce this year of 1899 of gold24000000 of skiver 14200000 oflead 4400000 in addition to a magnificent crop of wheat fruit and vegetables Thanks to her railroad facilities Montana is to da the richest mineral region of its size in the world Thelatest published statistics those of1S97 give the mineral output of Montana as 54000000Without railroads Kansas Nebraska Minnesota North and

service in the world at the lowest rates offare at the same time paying their employes very much higher wages thanare paid for similar service in any oihercountry on the globe In the UnitedStates the first class passenger fareslast year averaged 2 9S cents per milealthough on some large railways theaverage was several mills less than twocents per mile in England the firstclass fare is four cents per mile third-class fare for vastlv inferior service isagainst the German empires railways - t rtannth those of the Unitedparliamentary trains In Prussia thetore is three cents per mile in Austria JOo cents per mile and in Francecents per mileOur passenger cars excel those offoreig ncountriesinallthat goes to makenp the comfort and convenience of ajourney Our sleeping and parlor carBystem

carry only 55pounds free The lighting of ourtrainsis superb tvhile the lighting of trainson most foreign lines is wretchedTin sc are some of the achievementsof American railways in passenger service that have not been approached inany other country on the globe and inmy opinion it is achievements of thischaracter that have made it possiblefor the United States to expand its commerce with siu h astounding rapidityThe fact that American passengerservice attracts the attention of peopleof every other country who visit ourshores is demonstrated by the desire ofall foreigners to ride on the EmpireState express the fastest long distancetrain in the world and the further de-ie to examine tne magnmcent machines that haul our great trainsN C FISHERAttorney-At-LawParis KentuckyOffice on

represents the total sum of a few qualifications which experience has proved tobe most useful in the actual state ofsocial life and to day it representsqualifications that upon the whole arenot natural artitie qualificationsThere are those who will refuse to admit that the conception of what a gentleman is varies with different epochand conditions They will assert thatthe gentleman of a thousand rears usroof a hundred years ago is a gentleman jto day and will be one to morrow Asto large matters of ethics and conductyes as to minor matters of behaviorno We decide that a man is a gentleman by the manner in which hewears in daily existence in its haphazard and promiscuous companionships and situations And social lifeat present is an international affairIts interests are not confined to the limited stages where they would formerlyhave been localized but move over extended surfacesThe gentleman of to day thereforeis the individual who best adapts himself to prevailing circumstances by notstopping the general flow of thingswith an intrusion when not strictlynecessary of his own personality fieis the individual who puts no oversensitive valuation on his personal standards interferes little with others hasthe silent courage of his own conductbut no itch to explain it or himselfor to impose either on a preoccupiedworld that has no time to attend andless patience This in any case maypass as a definition of the social sideof what the Anglo Saxon calls a gentleman and as the Anglo Saxon racehas spread over the face of the globemore extensively than any other andbeen brought in contact with the greatest number of peoples under the greatest diversity of circumstances it mayfairly be considered no bad judge of theway to get through that

Affair of October andMayThere was a hint of autumn in thewoodland tints where the colors shaded from softest gray green throughrusset tones to deepest red and brownand the breeze that swept over the uplands was suggestive of chilly October but the golden spell of Indiansummer lay on the valley touching theripe peaches with an added bloom andwooing the late roses to unfold theirfragrant heart before it was too lateto give their sweetness to the dyingsummerIn the rectory orchard under theshadows of the fruit ladeu trees villagelads and lasses hid and sought andout in the meadow the children laughed and played and danced to the musicof their own voicesThe professor stood at the outeredge of a circle of infant revelers hisspectacles poshed up oh his broadforehead his soft Homburg hat tiltedforward to shield his eyes from thesunGray eyes they were with a keenness in them that was reflective andthat lent them a clearer vision forthings that time had set at a distancethan for present realitiesThe iron gray hair was brushed backand outlined features that were not unhandsome though their sternness gavehim a semblance of severity until hesmiledWhen the professor smiled childrenunderstood that the tall figure with itsinclination to stoop was not likely toprove aggressive and that the learningcontained in that massive frame couldbe put aside with the spectacles alsothat the professor might have beenyoung once before the weight of alaurel wreath had puckered his browsand powdered his hair with the frostthat comes before winterHe was smiling now and lookingwith appreciative interest at the gameIn progressDo you hear what they are singing he asked the rectors wifeMrs Errington detached herselffrom the tea urn to answer carelessl3Nuts and May isnt itThe delightful irrelevance of childhood pursued the professor thesublime faith in the impossible Herewe come gathering nuts and May soearly in the morning Not contentwith demanding their autumn andtheir spring at the same time theymust have it early in the morning tooall the work at their feet with youthto make them enjoy it They have faithenough to remove mountains but I amafraid the days of miracles are pastMrs Erringtons glance lingered onhim for a moment and then he traveled to where a girl in a white dressstood nnder the trees that borderedthe rectory gardenThere is Evadne she said howfresh and cool and sweet she looksDont you think so professorHe adjusted his spectacles to give aconscientious answerMiss Evadne is always pleasant tolook at he said as he gazed with apainstaking air in her direction atthis distance I do not see her so plainly jas I could wishAnd she is always pleasant to talkto added Mrs Errington go andask her if she would like some tea professorHe went obediently and the whitefigure moved to meet him while theecho of the words cool and fresh andsweet floated still in his earsI am sent to ask you If you willhave some tea he saidIs that meant for an excuse or anapology asked Evadne demurelyDoes my errand need either hequestioned in return with bis usualgravityYou seemed to consider so saidshe in which if you will not thinkme conceited I will confess you areunusual There are people she continued noting his puzzled air whocome and talk to me without any errand at all merely for the pleasure ofthe thingA little smile was playing round hermouth and through her curved eyelashes the sparkle of her eyes meantmischief iThe professor pushed his spectaclesup again when people were close tohim he could see better without assistanceThere

knowledge or an ignorant young person likemeShe had taken off her hat and wasdangling it by a ribbon from her armHer hair was all raffled and one littletress with a glint of gold in it kissedher cheek lovinglyThey had reached the stile and hestopped to help her over it before heanswered Then he saidMiss Eva do you think it is possiblefor any one to gather nuts and May atthe same timeYes if they get up early enough inthe morningWhat difference does that makeThe difference of not leaving thingstill they are too lateHe was still holding her hand Shegave it to him at the stile and apparently he had not remembered togive it back Her eyes were like starsand there was a rose flush like daydawn on her cheeksHow is one to know whether it istoo late or notI thought you knew everythingprofessor And you
