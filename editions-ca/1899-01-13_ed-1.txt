pork and then wandci awayto another tree to repeat the performanceIts for the birds he explainedThere arc large numbers of them inthe park and we want to encouragethem to remain here Just as soon adthe birds learn that they can obtainfood in the winter they are not liableto go away Birds want something topeck at and as the ground is all frozenhard we nail up this pork for them toexercise their

gave me andslipped it on and then our hands metin a hearty elasp that expressed morethan words It was at this momentthat Susette announced Pantin and thelittle notary came in with his quickshort stepI

go to do all you haveasked me to and rest assured messieurs it will be faithfully done1 have no doubt of that PantinWe had better make a start too Isaid and Belin shouted for the horsesWe stayed for a moment or so after thenotarys departure during which timeBelin urged me to take Vallon and acouple of men with me to my trystbut fearing no complications I refusedsaying that this was a matter that werebest done with one hand Belin wouldhave come himself but that his friendship with me being known it was necessary for him to avoid all suspicion ofhis being in the affairI shall go to the Louvre he saidand engage dAyen at play Pi mentaland others will be there and if I mistake not M le Baron will have a sorehead for his wedding and he chuckledhereThen I settled the score with minehost and mounting our horses e rodeback the way we came It was at theMagasins that we wished each othergood by and with a last grip of thehand and a last warning to hasten ioMourmeton Belin turned towards theLouvre whilst I went on towards theTuileries keeping the northern road andnot the more frequented street alongthe river faceThere was a strong moon and thenight was as clear as crystal One sideof the street was in shadow illuminatedhere and there by the dim light of afew lanterns set high up in niches inthe old and mass grown walls of thebuildings The houses here were oldev 1 for this part of Paris and wththeir sloping roofs and many gables rosein irregular outlires on either sideoutlines however so softened by themoonlight in which they seemed toquiver that it was as if some fantastic creation of fairyland had been setdown here a phantom city that wouldmelt into nothingness with the warmrays of the morning sunAway in the distance it still oenirrdas if I could hear the hum of the citybehind me but here it was quiet andstill and the iron shod hoofs of Covronne rang out with a strange clearness into the nightI had now come to the gardens ofthe Tuileries and putting Couronne atthe wall which was just being raisedaround them found myself within aquarter mile of our place of meetingThe turf was soft and level here and1 let Couronne go at a half gallop keeping the chequered shade of the hugetrees which whispered strange thingsto each other in the breeze At thismoment it seemed as if I heard thesmothered neigh of a horse I knewthe sound well for often had my oldXorman tried to serve me in this wathrough the scarf by which his jawswere bound together when we lay inambuscade With a touch of my handI stayed my beast and stopped to listenBeyond me stretched the avenue at theend of which stood the great lime treesI could see nothing but the ghostlyline of trunks lit up here by the moonthere standing out black against thenight or fading away into a laceworkof leaves and branches and the sullencreaking of the boughs overhead Itmust be her horse or Palins I saidaloud to myself and then the complinecame to me clear and sweet from thespire of St GermainI lifted my hat for an instant with asilent prayer to God for help and thenshook up Couronne Ere the last notesof the bells had gone I was under thelimes At first I could see nothingthere was no one there and my heartgrew cold at the thought 1 hat some danger hadi overtaken my dear oneMadame I called out It is IdAuriacThen a figure in a gray mantle steppedout from the shadow of the trees and Isprang from the saddle and held out nrhandI knew it was you chevalier shesaid but I wanted to make certain andwaited until you spokeI hope I have not kept you waitingIndeed no I had but just come acrossfrom the Louvre when you arrivedThen you did not come ridingHow could 1 1 have been in theLouvre and am expected to be at thecoueher of Mme Catherine in a halfhour and she laughed slightly Thethought of that smothered neigh flashedthrough my mind like lightning Wemust trust ourselves to Couronne 1said Palin will be at the Porte StDenis There is no time to wasteComeThen it seemed that she hesitated andflinging back her hood looked me full inthe face In the moonlight I saw herwhite as marble and she suddenly putout both her hands sayingI trust you utterly dAuriacMan is not made of stone and I lovedthi woman as my life There was thatin her voice in the pitiful appeal of itstones that broke down all my falsepride 1 cannot say how it happenedbut in a moment my arm was round herwaist and I drew her toward me shenothing resistingSo for a time we stood in a silenceand then 1 kissed herCome dear I said and with themorning we shall be safeOf her own accord she put her armsabout my neck and pressed her lips itomine and then I lifted my daring to1 Couronnes saddle bowHad I but taken de Belins offer ifJacques were but with me thenMy foot was in the stirrup my handon the reins when there wai a suddenBash a loud report and my poor horsefell forward floundering in the agony ofdeathI just managed to snatch Claude fromthe saddle and staggered back and thenwith a rush a half dozen men were onus They were masked to a man andmade their attack in perfect silencebut as my sword flashed out of mvI 1 u 1 I u aii a jMduuuiu 1 lutugiiicu me tan juyiue oithe capuchin and thrust at him fiercely with a curse at in foil in comingaloneThings like these take a short time indoing and should take a shorter time intelling I ran one man through theheart and with a gasp he fell forwardand twisted himself like a snake roundmy blade Then some one flung a cloakover my head I was overborn by numbers and thrown Two or three menheld me down there was an iron grip atmy throat and a mans knee pressedheavily on my chest I made a franticeffort to free myself the coveringslipped from my face and I saw it wasthe capuchin kneeling over me a dagger in his hand His mask had fallenfrom him and his face was the face ofRavaillacI could not call out I was held tootight and the villain lifted his poniardto strike when a voice the voice of deGomeiDU said Hold We will puthim out another wayThis is the quickest and surest answered Ravaillac but the reply wasbrief and sternCarry out my orders gag him andlining him with usTo BabeteVTo Babettes there is the oubliettequick there is no time to loseO ho laughed Ravaillac that isgood M le Chevalier will be able todrown his Borrows under the Seinebut he will take a long time 0 dieYou villain I gasped but likelightning the gag was on me and then Iwas blindfolded I could sec nothingof madame though I tried my utmostto get a glimpse of her Then I wasbound hand and foot and lifted by acouple of men Alter being carried ashort space I was thrust into a litterand as this was done I heard a faintcry from Claude and I groaned in myheart for I was powerless to helpThe litter went forward at a joltingpace and from the echo of hoofsaround it I gathered that there were atleast a dozen mounted men about meSometimes I heard a brief order givenby de Gomeron and the Bound of hisvoice made me certain that madamewas with us If so there might still bebope and I lay still and tried to follow our route by the movement of theparty but I could see nothing and after a time mv brain began to fet confused for we turned this way and thatup side streets down winding roadsuntil the thing became impossibleOnce we were challenged by thewatch and my captor answered boldlyM de Gomeron of the marshalsguards with prisoners for thechateletlet us pass in the kings nameI heard the words and strove to callout but the gag was too secure Atany rate I had learned one thing wewere going in the direction of thechatelct Who then was Babette 1had heard the name once before onthe night that I lay wounded before LaFere and an inspiration seemed tocome on me and I was certain that thenight hag and de Gomerons Babettewere one and the sameThen we jolted on for about anotherhalf hour we must have passed thechatelet by this when suddenly thelitter took a sharp turn to the rightand after going a little way was put tothe groundAfter a half hour or so I was draggedout and I heard a womans voiceThis way my lambs the gentlemens room is below very far belowout of all drafts and she laughed withthe same pitiless note in her voice thatI had heard once before and I knew itwas the murderessDown a winding stair we went and Iremained passive but mentally countedthe steps and the turns There were ISsteps and three turns at each of whichthere was apparently a door and thenwe stopped There was a jingling ofkeys the harsh grating noise of a boltbeing drawn back and Babette spokeagainMonsieurs apartment is ready tisthe safest room in the Toison dOrThen I was flung in heavily as I was andthe door bolted behind meCHAPTER XVTHE HAND OF BABETTEI lay for a time where I had beenflung overwhelmed with the disasterThen a frenzy came on me and butfor the gag- in my mouth I could havescreamed out curses on mv follv in allowing myself to be trapped like a wildcat Now that I think of it in the madness of those moments I did not prayto the God who had so often and so repeatedly helped me yet in His mercyand goodness I was freed from mystraits as will be shown hereafterIn the meantime I was so securelybound that it was all but impossible tomove and the bandage over my eyesprevented me from seeing anything Iwrithed and twisted like a serpent onthe wet flags where I lay and in theviolence of my struggles graduallymoved the bandage so that my eyeswere at last set free and then exhausted by my efforts and half chokedby the gag I became still once moreand looked around me For all I couldsee I might have been as before I wasin blank absolute darkness Into thevoid I peered but could make out nothing though I could hear my own labored breathing and the melancholydrip drip of water as it oozed fromabove me and fell in sullen drops onthe slime belowAs I strained into the velvet black ofthe darkness it came- to me somefiend must have whispered it that Iwas blind My 3dz ahnosc ceasedto work at the thought and I remainedin a kind of torpor trying in a weakmanner to mentally fount the drops owater by the dull splashing sound theymade in falling Ages seemed to passas I lay there and the first sense ofcoming to myself was the thoughtof Idaude whom 1 had lost and thequick agony of this made my otherBufferings seem as nothing There is amisery that words at least such wordsas I am master of cannot picture andI will therefore say no more of thisA little thing however now happened and but for this 1 might havelain where I was until 1 died so entirelyimpressed was I with the idea that Iwas sightless In utter weariness 1turned my head to one side and sawtwo small beads of fire twinkling abouta yard or so from me They were assmall as the far away stars and theystared at me fixedly This is some deception of the mind 1 thought to myself when suddenly another pair offiery eyes appeared then there was aslight shaming and all was still Butit was the saving of me Sight andhearing could not both deceive I knewwhat they were and 1 knew too thatI was not blind From that moment 1began to regain possession of my faculties and to think of means of escapeIn my vest pocket was a small claspknife If I could but get at that I couldfree myself from my bonds That atany rate had to be the first step I began to slowly move my arms up anddown with a view to loosening thecords that bound me but alter sometime spent in this exercise realized thefact that the ropes might cut throughme but that they would not loosenThen it struck me in my eagerness tobe free that I might get at the knotswith my teeth and by a mighty effort 1raised myself to a sitting posture onlyto remember that I was gagged andthat it was of no avail to think of thisplan There are those who will smileperhaps if their eyes meet thlf andput me down in their estimation for afool for

SpokesmanLondon Jan 12 Most of the morning-papers comment Thursday uponthe situation in the Philippines drawing-the inference that Senator Forakera remarks in the senate chamberWednesday were made by him as thespokesman of the president and expressing disappointment and their disapproval of a possible relinquishmentof the Philippines by the United StatesThe Times says That the senatorappears to leave the subject in an unpleasantly ambiguous state It is inthe Philippines that the new system ofgovernment will be brought to a testand no resolutions passed in the senatecan solve the problem The claims ofthe insurgent to national recognitioncan hardly hold water but there is nopower in the world that would be moreembarrassed by the raising of a question of this sort as the United StatesTo announce that the occupation ofthe Philippines is onl temporarywould be scarcely prudent Althoughsome precedents are furnished in ourown policy during the last 20 yearsthe results are unsatisfactory

hold aloof except inthe inconceivable event of the failureof the American governmentThe Standard saysIt is a little startling to find theliberators of Cuba engaged in suppressing a youthful republic

in this country devoted almost wholly to one oranother of these crops One yearsfailure of the special crop of any ofthese sections means inconvenience tofarmers and a failure for two or moresuccessive years leads to ruin Fromthe orange groves of Florida and thecane lands of Louisiana to the wheatfields of North Dakota the specialty fanner is liable to workwithout profit because of barren years or low prices It istrue that each section is better forsome one crop than for any other andit is good policy to devote a considerable part of the time and the farm tothat crop The good farmer will endeavor to learn which crop is the mostprofitable and that having- been settled he will try to learn everythingthat is to be known about that particular crop At the same time he willlearn something concerning every other crop whidi he can grow in orderthat he may diversify his productionsuk much as possibleSpecialty farming is always destructive farming as it makes a rotation ofcrops impossible

JANUARY 13 18S9Sydney Smiths JokeSydney Smith was very happy in hiscountry life and his children caughtjis spirit of delight over commonhiugs They loved animals and spentlong hours in truining them One littlebeast a baby donkey became undertheir tuition perhaps the most accomplishes of his species and unconsciously gave rise to a quatrain which nowbelongs to the fame of Sydaey SmithThe donkey was a well educated chapHe would walk up stairs follow thefamily in their rambles like a dog andwhen they entered his meadow run tomeet them with ears down and tailerect braying joyouslyO day when Billys head wascrowue with flowers and he was beingtrained with a handkerchief for a bridleMr Jeffrey unexpectedly arrived Hejoined in the sport and to the childrensinfinite delight mounted BillyThus he was proceeding in triumphwhen Sydney Smith and his wife withthree friends returned from a walk andtook in the festal scene The great manadvanced with extended hands andgreeted his old friend in an impromptuwhich ha8 become familiar to the reading worldWitty as Horatius FlaccusAh jjreat a Jacobin as GracchusShort though not as Cat as BacchusSeated on a little jackassYouths CompanionThe Death of ConcliinjcThe coaching system died a lingeringa lamentable death I can remembersomething of a few coaches in remotedistricts which longest escaped strangulation and memory of those distantdays has been sweeter without themThey resemble what Nimrod describesas the obsolete old fashioned coach ofhis boyhood drawn by dispirited illfed jades over long stages One of hisparagraphs well describes vhit used torrake my blood boil with impotentfury imbittering the joy of returninghme for the holidays and deepeningthe depression of the schoolward journeyThe four horse whip and the Nottingham whipcord were of no avail overthe latter part of the ground and something like a was produced out of the boot which was jocularly called the appientice and ashrewd apprentice it was to the art oftorturing which was inflicted on thewheelers without stint or measure butwithout which the coach might havebeen often left on the roadNo the last of the road coachescorruptio optimi disappeared and leftnone to mourn them BlackwoodsMagazineBribing SpnrgeonThe autobiography of the late RevCharles H Spnrgeon contains an account of what may be termed an earlybusiness venture and its influence onhis characterSpurgeon was brought up on Wattshymns but not altogether willinglyHis grandmother coaxed him withmoney to learn them At first she gavehim a penny but when she saw howeasily it was earned the old lady reduced the prize to a halfpenny and thento a farthing There is no telling howlow the amount per hymn might havefallen but just at this time his grandfather made a discovery which seemedmore desirable to SpurgeonHe discovered that his house wasoverrun with rats and offered hisgrandson a shilling a dozen for all hecould killThe occupation of rat killing gavehim more money than learning hymnsBut Mr Spnrgeon characteristicallyeays I know which employment hasbeen the more permanently profitableto meAll BaRlneosIm afraid our new son-in-law isntmuch of a business man she saidDont you worry about that replied the old gentleman If he doesntknow how to make the best of a bargainI dont know who does The day beforethe wedding he discovered that Minniehad a freckle under hei left ear and hemade rue add 1000 to her dowry onthe ground that the goods werent entirely in accordance with the invoice Iwas almost tempted to believe that hewasnt a nobleman at all but a NewEngland Yankee in
