RAINS HELPING CROPS, BUT DEr
LAYING HARVESTS.
Copious rains which have fallen in
this vicinity almost every day this
week have greatly helped growing-crops-
of all kinds and furnished a
good season for setting out the r
mainder of the tobacco land. While
the rains have not been accompanied
by much wind in some sections of tiie
county some of the wheat has fallen
which will be lost, as it will be im
possible to get under it with the
binder:
It is said by some of the farmers
that the wheat crop will prove a dis
appointment in some- places where
the heads have not filled out well on
account of the- cold', rainy weather
which prevailed' during the month of
May.
Heavy rains fell' here yesterday af
ternoon again, lasting well through
the- latter part of the- day. A trav
eling man who came from Maysville
to Paris stated that in the vicinity of
Millersburg the- downpour amounted
to almost a cloudburst. Err some
places the water on- the- pike was up
to, the hubs of his machine. For a
time the heavy black cloutfe gave
promise of a storm, but it Luckily
passed off in a heavy rain.
