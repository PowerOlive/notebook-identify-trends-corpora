Notice to the Public.
It is well to anticipate the possibil
ity of typhoid fever. Then, boil all
water used for domestic purposes,
and put yourself on the safe side.
An ounce of prevention, etc. Presume
your water supply to be bad until
you know it to be good. This can
only be brought out by analysis.
A.' H. KELLER,
7:tf City Health Officer.
The Difference.
Men think most of the present
the immediate; and rightly, -their call
ing being to do and to work. Women,
on the other hand, more of how things
hang together in life; and rightly,
too, because their destiny the destiny
of the families is bound up in this
interdependence, and it is exactly this
which it is their mission to promote.
