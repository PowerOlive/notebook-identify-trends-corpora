Bingham ofLouisville, pledged his personalKidto the extent of $1,000,000.In most instances the pledges ofthe bankers equalled the legal Ij'mitof the banks they represented, and itwas said after the meeting adjourned that many banks had not had8 opportunity tp subscribe becaiise of. thefact that the jaotices sent out caiji)igthe meeting had not given time--formeeting of the directors.Judge Ed. C. O'Rear, of Frankfort,and Robert C. Talbott, of Paris, discussed the constitutionality of theBingham cooperative marketing act,and both expressed the opinion tliatthe bill was constitutional and wouldbe so held by the courts.In his talk before the conference,Judge Bingham declared that nocourt in the United States has ejjerdeclared such a law unconstitutionalthough they have been enacted byfourteen States and have been In operation in some of these for years.The meeting of the bankers andofficials of the association was called to order in the ball room of thePhoenix Hotel, Saturday afternoonat 1 oclock and was in session forthree hours. President Jas. C. Stoneof the association, explained the purpose of the meeting, and frankly explained the fact that attorneys forLouisville banks had expressed theopinion that the law was unconstitutional. He went thoroughly intothe question of the enactment of theBingham law, told of the care withwhich it had been prepared afterall phases of the legal question hasbeen studied by. men who. had madea specialty of such laws for fifteenyears. 'Robert C. Talbott, of Paris prominent lawyer, discussed briefly theBingham marketing act. The security offered for the proposed loans, hesaid, would not be affected in anyway by the constitutionality of theco-operative marketing act. Therights of holders of warehouse receipts, he said, did -not depend onthe existence of the association butwere amply secured by the generallaw of the State."After a careful inspection of thestatutes, Federal and State," hesaid, "I would say that you needhave no hesitation to believe thatthe courts will hold the new act pon-stitutional."General Counsel Aaron Sapiro ofthe association, announced theamount of the loan made by thebankers and proposed the appointment of a committee to draw up. thetrust agreement under which .theloan is to be handled. This committee is composed of Monty Goble, ofCincinnati, or his representative;James B. Brown, of Louisville, orhis nominee; C. N. Manning, ofLexington, James McClure, of Paris,and J. A. Cheek, of Danville.When the call was made for subscriptions or pledges to the loan theBourbon county banks, throughtheir representatives, made the following responses: First NationalBank, $20,000; Deposit Bank, NorthMiddletown, $15,000; Bourbon-AgriculturalBank & Trust Co., $32,000;Peoples-Deposit Bank & Trust.

The direstors also adopted the report of the Committee of Insurancecomposed of Bush W. Allin, of Harrodsburg, and Jorn B. Winn, of Versailles, which awarded all the insurance on the 117 warehouses andtheir equipment to the local agentsof the district, to be placed directlyby them.It gave to Reutlinger & Co., ofLouisville, the-' insurance jon toboccain warehouses or in transit, in connection with the local agents, andplaced the bond business with J.Morton Morris, of Louisville, in association with local agents. The employers' liabality part of the association's business was placed with Thos.S.

The navy has beenlaunching airplanes from the decksof battleships for several years, butit has hitherto been necessary alwaysto maneuver the battleship so as tolaunch the airplane directly into thewind. This manifestly, would be impossible in actual battle. So the United States Navy department has justdeveloped a system whereby an- airplane may be catapulted into the windwithout regard to the direction thebattleship is headed.The Scientific American gives acomplete description of this ingeniouslysimple device, which Is now beingshown at the Philadelphia navy yard.Following is the article, slightly condensed :"To permit the launching of alr-planes from a battleship or other warvessel the catapult has been resortedto, and a special type of catapult has"been developed which has been designated a turntable catapult becausethe catapult mechanism proper Isvmounted on a turntable so that it canbe pointed into the wind when launching a plane."One catapult of this type could beinstalled on every battleship andcould launch when needed a fightingairplane, so that a fleet of battleshipswould be able on the approach of hostile bombing airplanes to send intothe air instantly a large number offighting planes to shoot them downbefore the bombing attack could bedeveloped. This is the real answerto the threat of the bombing, plane,which was demonstrated in so spectacular a manner by the recent bombing from the air of the x-Germanwarships. v"In the bombing attacks of theseer-Gerraan warships it was shownthat bombs dropped from the aircould 66 material damage to wardships which did not defend themselves. Obviously a warship can defend itself by anti-aircraft gunfire,but never by attack, in the air. Theweapons of offense and defence inthe history of naval warfare havealways developed step by step andthe development of the heavy bombing airplane Is being met by this development of a catapult which willshoot fast combat planes from thedecks of battleships Into the air torepel bombing attacks. ,Developed in Ten Years."The catapult of this particulartype is new, but the elements are theresult of navy catapult developmentInitiated in 1911 by Capt. WashingtonI. Chambers, at that time in chargeof naval aviation experiments. Thefirst flight was made Nov. 12, 191$.by Commander, then Lieutenant, T..G. Ellyson in a Curtiss seaplane froma catapult."The matter ,was resumed in 191.")when the development of naval seaplanes had proceeded to such a pointthat it was clear to the Navy it wouldbe desirable to take aircraft -to sea.A new design of catapult, based onexperience with the first one, was installed on the stern of the armoredcruiser North ' Carolina and successful flights were made. - The NorthCarolina installation proved so reliable that similar catapults were installed on the armored cruisers Seattle and Huntington, and duringthe early winter of 1916 successfulflights were made from these cruisers."At the time the United States entered the war the principal naval effort was anti-submarine in its objectand the convoy of shipping. Aircraftwere not needed aboard these cruisersfor -this purpose, and the catapultswere removed. After the armistice,the catapult problem was again takenup and a catapult, similar to theNorth Carolina design, which hadbeen -in use at Pensecola for trainingaviators while mounted on a coalbarge, was brought to Washington andfurther tests and investigations made.' "The old catapults, such as wereused on the Norttf Carolina, consistedof a track along which a carriagewas propelled by a compressed aircylinder. The airplane was mountedon this carriage, 'and as the carriagespeeded up it released the airplane at jthe end of. its run, allowing it- to nyinto the air. The track for this catapult was mounted along the oenterMne of the ship, and since it was necessary to launch the airplane direct intthe relative wind, it was necessaryor the ship to set herself on such a j.course that the wind blew In the direction of the -catapult track.'This maneuver, while entirelyfeasible, necessitated the shipturningout of formation, or heading uponsome course which might prove, verydisadvantageous. .The turntable catapult obviates tins, and i.j relativelysmall snd compact.tCompressed Air Used.Tfa turntable' catapult conlstsv-a bridge-like structure mounted n aturntable upon which there In vtheusual car which carries the airplane,and this car is propelled by compressed-air.Frequent tests have dem-! onstrated that it is possible to launch jby such a mechanism any of the typesof airplane or &ea. Kino which wouldbe carried upon a battleship.i "The problem of launching an air-j plane in a shon run by means of thecatapult depe us upon several factors.The first- and primary one is, ofcourse", that at the" end of the run thecatapult should have g'ven the planea ,speed such that when theu plane" Isreleased from the car the wings willlift it into the air and flight has begun. This requires that the launching yelocity t Ik II be somewhat in excess of the minimum flying speed ofthe plane. So. -on it is necessarywhile the pla e is being brought upto this flying speed that the plane beheld securely to he launching carriage in order U:i M will not leavethe track too soo. . I inally, it is necessary that the acceleration oflaunching hall n i he so great orso violent as to injure the pilot, whomust ride in the pTai.e and preserveall his senses aler in order to takecharge as soon as he is released atthe end of the run."Under many conditions the seaplane in its preset t state of development is entirely practical, although Invery rough weather a landing uponthe sea is likely to mean the damageif not the loss of the seaplane, although it is to be expected that theaviator can be re-cued. The conditions of the weather, hovever. are notbelieved to offer any inconvenience tolaunching by means of the ratapult.and in time of war the commander inchief will launch his planes in theair where they may accomplish theirmission regardless of whether or notthe planes may be salvaged intactupon their landing."Federal Law Needed.In summing up the development ofaviation in 1921 the Scientific American says: 0"The outstanding fact in Americanaeronautics is that the United Statesis still awaiting the passage of a federal law for the licensing of pilots,the inspection of machines and thegeneral encouragement and control ofthe industry. As matters stand, anyman is at liberty to buy or build anInferior machine, ake up passengersat so much a head, and kill both themand himself (as not Infrequently hap--pens)without a word of official protest.-Thus, the art is discredited andthe public discouraged. If aeronauticsis not illegal, it is at best nonlawfuland will remain so until congress doesits duty. While foreign governmentsare encouraging aviation, commercialprogress in the United States is dueentirely to the unaided efforts of themanufacturer and the individual inventor. All honor, to them."Some truly 'remarkable recordshave marked the efforts of the pastweek. In France," Sadl Leconte intraining for the Deutsch cup contests,achieved a speed of 206 miles anhour in a biplane, and came prettyclose to that mark in the race itself.This was for a short distance, straightaway. "The record over a 150-mile closedcircuit was gained in the Pulitzertrophy by Bert Acosta in a CurtisNavy racer, when he covered the dis-Ltance at an average speed of 176.7miles per hour."Another startling feat was that ofLieut. John A. Macready, who on September 28, rising from McCook fieldrDayton, 0., attained a height of .40,008feet. He used electrically heatedclothing, the oxygen tank, and the gasturbine supercharger. His La Perebiplane was the same in which Schroeder climbed to 38,180 feet in the preceding year.All Metal Monoplane in Favor."This all-metal monoplane continuesto gain fav.or, and its performance ischaracterized by a remarkable lowgas consumption, due, of courselargely to its excellent motor. Therehas been a remarkable revival of interest in the monoplane as a good typefor moderate speeds. The thicknessof wing which is necessitated by infernal bracing is unsuitable for the highest speeds. Leconte used a biplanewith the characteristic thin wings ofthe modern racing machine."Multiple engiues, so coupled up asto he capable of being run hidepend- jentiy, are growing in lavoi. jutumiand Gallaudet, among American designerst have secured excellent resultswith this arrangement. Regular airplane passenger service, running onschedule, has made progress, slow, itmny he, but encouraging."Abroad, the frendh and British arestill maintaining their London-Parisroutes ; other services in Europe havebeen running consistently, and newroutes have been established duringthe year. On this side of the wate'rwe have seen the inauguration of the'Key West to Havana and other passenger-carrying services. The air mailfunctioned with a regularity whichshould encourage congress greatly toenlarge its scope. f"Mention should he made of thePetroczy helicopter which, in tets,lifted itself to a height of 100 feet.It weighs 2.900 pounds and is heldcaptive for observation purposes, taking the place of the vulnerable balloon. ""The prospects of successful dirigible passenger service' have undoubtedly been sot back somewhat by the offerof tlit r.'.IMsli government to give awayits fleet of six dirigibles, coupled withthe failure of any private .company tijl' month without the option. jaccept the gift, "and by the tragic loiM " ....................................'Itf.the latt"ihip ,'ZK-.', as.. ;;- - T - -"NEGROES MOVE NORTHCensus Bureau Report Placesdumber at 7c J, 794..- m z. f.s wCounter Movement Back to SouthernStates'' Also Is So own 47,223Negroes Born in'rtorth Mi- "grate to the South.Washington.

Thus the proportionof southern-born negroes who migratedto the North or West, according tothe report, was only about one-fourthlarger than the proportion of thoseborn in the latter region who migratedto the South."While it is impossible to calculateexactly the extent of negro migrationfrom the South during the decadeended with 1920," the census reportsaid, "the available data indicates thatapproximately 400,000, or somewhatmore than half of the 733,571' survivorsof the net negro migration from theSouth to the North and West priorto January 1, 1920, left the South subsequently to April 15, 1910.'"Although migration to the Northand West has not taken place amongthe far southern negroes to the sameextent, relatively to their total numbers, as among the negroes in thenorthern part of the South, there was,nevertheless, a pronounced increase insuch migration from the Far South during' the past decade."As examples of this gain, the reportcited increases in the migration ofnegroes from southern states 'to Pennsylvania from 1910 to 1920 as follows :Georgia, 1,578 to 16,196; South "Carolina, 2,115 to 11,624 ; Florida, 393'to 5,370. The migration "from Alabama to'Ohio increased from '781 to 17;588;from Mississippi to Illinois, 4,612 toI 19,485; Texas to Missouri, L907to 4,-344. ,35,000 "VAGS" IN NEW YORKVery Fw Former Service Men AreAmong Migratory Army of theHomeless.New York.

The object ofthe contest, as stated by the Devilhimself, was to enable him to ascertain who among his evil cohorts wasbest fitted to occupy the next Highestoffice in the realm of Hell.The contestants were given a termI of years in which to perform themost diabolical deed each could devise, obtain authenticated proof ofits actual performance and to present all evidence at a public meetingheld for that purpose. Under hisseal the Devil obligated himself 'toreward the one winning the contestby making that one his Deputy, givehim power to reign with absoluteauthority during the Devil's indisposition or absence on vacation and topresent him with a scepter secondonly -in fearfulness to that of theDevil himself.At the appointed time the cohortsof Hell assembled in solemn conclave and each one in the audiencewas in breathless expectation tolearn what the Devil (who had announced, previously that he was tobe the sole judge in the contest)would consider the most diabolicaldeed.Armed with documentary evidence, in some instances filling tooverflowing a lawyer's brief case,each contestant assembled on theplatform and a smile of self-satisfactionoverspread the countenance(of the one who, at the call of theArchdemon, walked to a position infront of the Throne and recited hisevil valor and misdeeds.Without going into thej details ofwhat was a most sordid recital ofmurder, rapine, crooked dealing,shame, degredation, dishonor andcrime, it will suffice to tell of thelast to present himself for the coveted honor.When the name of "Old, TrustedSubscriber" was called by the Archdemon a somewhat unfamiliar figurestepped to the front of the stage,and, saluting his Majesty, began hisrecital. There was little about hisappearance to justify an onlooker insupposing that he belonged in thatmotley gang of evildoers, nor did hecarry much evidence of his wrongdoing. In fact, with the exception ota few letters and cards which heheld conspicuously one could not discern that he was a candidate for thehonor offered by the Devil.Given permission to speak, OldTrusted Subscriber related that hehad subscribed for the local newspaper a number of years ago.- "Atfirst," said he, "I paid in advanceeach year. Then I found out thatthe Editor was a 'pleasant sort ofperson, trustful and hardworking,and not disposed to press those whowere indebted to -him ; so I began tolet my subscription lapse. Everynow and again there appeared anotice in the paper to pay up, witha mild threat that back accountswould be placed in the hands of alawyer for collection. As a sort ofsop I went to the office and paid fora year on my indebtedness, but neverpaid up in full,-not to mention paying in advance. Then I made inquiry and found that those who didnot 'scare' at the threat to takeI legal action were not molested or' troubled, so I decided I need not settle, either."In the meantime, I got all thepersonal mention and publicity Iwanted. Whenever we gave a partyor had friends visiting at our housethe Editor always published a noteof it. Whenever death came into thefamily, or one of my children gotmarried, I always wrote out a longaccount in which I praised myselfas being a representative citizen ofthe community, and the Editor always published it in full. Wheneverone of my boys or girls went off toschool the Editor mentioned it:when they got high marks or wondistinction the Editor printed an account of it and I figured that I gottwice the value of the subscriptionprice each year; but, year by year. II got further and further behind withI my payments.""Then I moved away from town,'but as I wanted to know of the do-LI ings in my old town, and Jtnowingfull well, that the home paper wouldchronicle all of these things, as wellas publish anything I might send infrom my new home so that nryfriends might hear from me withoutthe trouble of writing to them, I ordered the paper sent to my new address. The Editor 'fell' for this imposition and even wrote out, withoutany suggestion from me, a eulogisticitem about my value to the community and the loss the communitywould feel at my going. But this didnot induce me to pay up beforeleaving."I waff about to forget to tell thatwhen any of my family got intotrouble, I would always appeal tothe Editor to suppress that fact,which, if possible, he did.HE WASTEDKJNEYSAYS CONTRACTORTried Many Things That Diet HimNo Goqd Is like A New ManNow"I have wasted a good ileal ofmoney in my time on medicines thatdid me no good, but I certainly gotmy money's worth when I got Tanlac," said W. L. Smith, 2001 Madison Ave., Huntington, W.
