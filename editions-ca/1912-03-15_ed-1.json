Wrong Idea About WhalM.
Since the time of Aristotle ";people
have assumed that whales blow water
through their noses, not, as' is actually
the case, condensed breath. That this
view was wrong is proved by the fact
alone that the throat of the whale,
which is the only way that the water
can enter, is not connected with the
air passage.

Light Committee of City Coun
cil Recommeds a Municipal
Plant for the City.
NEW ORDINANCE PASSES
Requires All City Employes to
Refrain from Use of Liquor
While Discharging Duty.
Initial steps toward the establish
ment of a municipal lighting: plant in
Paris were taken at the meeting of the
City Council last night, when after the
Light Committee which Iifs had the
matter of investigating the rates
which the Paris Gas and Electric Co.
are charging made its report.Jand
recommended the building and equip
ping of a plant.
At the meeting last night the full
Board was present and the ordinance
introduced by Councilman Kenney
several weeks ago and which was
amended at the last meeting prohibit
ing employes of the city from indulg
ing in the practice of entering saloons
or drinking, while on duty passed by a
unanimous vote.
Tne report submitted by the Light
Committee was accepted by the Board
and the Finance Committee was
authorized to communicate with vari
ous electrical hau3ns in an effort to
ascertain the cost of equipping a
plant, anJ was also given the authority
to employ an engineer (o go over the
grounds upon which the proposed' plant
will be located and to submit plans
and specifications.
The report submitted oy the Light
Committee which was tne result of
several weeks investigation is as fol
lows :
The Committee on, Lights, having
been given the power by the Mayor
and Council of the city of Paris, to in
vestigate the exorbitant accounts
rendered to the private consumers by
the Paris Electric and Gas Light Com
pany, hereby makn. their report :
First After a thorough investiga
tion, to the best of our ability, the in
formation we could obtain is that the
meters of this company appear to be
practically correct.
SecoDd In some instances, the
meters have been overread and also
underread some months, and then com
ing up very large the next month.
Third That the Paris Elcetric and
Gas Light Co. have or have had some
very incompetent meter readers, ac
cording to their own statements.
Fourth .Ve have communications
from several municipal owned plants,
which seem to be doing well and giv
ing low rates of lighting, and also
from private ownerships, which like
wise give the same rates as that of
the Paris Electric and Gas Light Co.,
which give satisfaction to the consum
er, also those that give a much lower
rate.
Fifth We find that if the meters
are registering right which at present
we have no reason to doubt, that the
rate per K. VY. is too high for the
amount consumed by the average con
sumer and far more than they can
afford to pay; also if the fact that th8
daylight current is greatly used and
abused, as the, light company charges,
then as the amount of current used
has been greatly increased, then we
cannot see why the price should stand
the same as tt did when a smaller
amount was consumed. A certain
amount of current is wasted at the
plant, as has b een stated to us, 'then
if this amount is used why still can
the prices stay 12 cents per K. W. in
stead of being reduced.
Sixth We have invited and had a
representative of the Paris Electric
and Gas Light Co. at our meeting and
talked the situation over with him,
and he stated to us that he would not
reduce the prices. We asked him how
many incandescent lights were burned
in the city, which he refused to tell
us.
Seventh In view of the fact that
the people are not satisfied with the
present situation of the charges made
them, and from our investigation, and
the refusal of the Paris Electric and
Gas Light Co. to give us any informa
tion to enlighten us on the excessive
ness of their accounts ajaiust the pri
vate consumers, and clamor of the
laboring people and people of moderate
means'to use electricity as lights, but
the fear of excessive accounts which
might be rendered them, which would
reduce their income too greatly.
Therefore, we, the committee,
recommend that the city of Paris be
come owner of its own Electric Light
an Power Plant, thereby protecting
citizens and taxpayers, both rich and
poor, and to eliminate it from politics,
putting same under a band of commis
sioners to be elected by the people.

Good Bookkeeping.
Sir Walter Scott, in lending a book
one day to a friend, cautioned him to
be punctual in returning it. "This is
really necessary," said the poet in
apology, "for though many of my
friends are bad arithmeticians, I ob
serve almost all of them to be good,
bookkeepers.'

The meeting of the committee from
this county with the , Louisville and
Nashville officials is inevery way as
suring that Paris and North Middle
town have the greatest chance to
secure the road which would be of the
I. regatest benefit to the business inter
ests of the county. Assuming that the
project has a favorable termination no
estimate can be made of what the re
sults will be to Paris, bringing to our
city a large number of people, putting
us on a direct line with tne richest
coal fields in the world and making 'it
the center of the shipping interests in
Central Kentucky.

Newman Auto
Bill Killed.
The ' Newcomb automobile bill.
Newcomb
which contained what were termed
"drastic" clauses, is desd. The meas
ure, are being loaded down with
amendments, was finally tabled in the
House Monday night without a roll
call after a series of heated debates.
This ends any chance of any legis
lation this sesison againts automobiles
and is considered a great victory for
automobile clubs of Kentucky. In all
the big cities of the State auto clubs
adopted resolutions condemning the
bill, declaring it would ruin the auto
business in Kentucky if it became a
law. A petition signed by the auto
owners of this county which followed
a meeting held here was sent to
Frankfort in opposition to the measure.

Mandale Filed in Fayetie Court.
The mandate of the Court of Ap
peals reversing the decision of the
Fayette Circuit Court in the case of
Maggie R. -McClinfock against James
D. McClintock, of Paris, for a divorce
and alimony and the custody of their
little two year old daughter, Rachel
McClintcok, was received Tuesday by
James C. Rogers. Circuit Clerk of
Fayette, for record. The judgment of
the higher court, which was written
by Judge Lassing, covered twenty-two
pages of typewritten matter. Regard
ing the deposition and custody of the
child, the higher court says:
2 "While denying the plaintiff any
relief whatever, the chancellor in his
judgment awarded to her the custody
of their eighteen months old child and
directed that her husband should pay
monthly for the support of hersplf
and child, during this litigation, $62.53;
per month ; but made no provisions for
the support of either the appellant or
the child after the termination of this
litigation. The judgment giving to
the wife the custody of the child was
eminently proper, and the provision
made for its father to see it at stated
intervals and to have the custody of it
on certain days of the week, was
fair and reasonable to both parties,
and although no order has been made
by the court for its support, by its
father, after the termination of this
litigation, the chancelor would have
ample power to make such further
order from time to time as it needs
the conditions required. The chancel
lor should have allowed her at least
$100 a month for the support of herself
and child, and this sum may be in
creased as the child grows older, and
its wants and necessities for clothing,
schooling, etc, require the expenditure
of additional sums, or it may be reduc
ed if the circumstances of the parties
require it. The judgment is reversed
and cause remanded, with instructions
to the chancellor to enter a judgment
granting to appellant the relief sought
to-wit: A divorce from bed and board
and a separate maintenance, which he
will hx in his order for the present
upon the first of each and every
month.

DIAMOND NOTES.
The management of the Maya villa
club is'32,000 in the hole from last
season and with the spring training
soon coming on it is estimated the
club will be $2,500 behind before the
season begins. The hat will be passed
around among ihe lovers of the game
in the river town to make up the
deficit. Here's hoping they get it,
more too, that Maysville, a good bass
ball (own, may remain in the league.
Got Away With Many Nickels.
With his pockets stuffed with nick
els, a man was arrested in Mount Ver
non, N. Y., a few days ago, charged
with vagrancy. Puzzled at the jingling
sounds issuing from his garments, the
police searched his clothes finding, to
their amazement, that 800 nickels weje
stowed about his person. The prison
er then confessed that he had tapped
a nickel-in-the-slot machine and made
away with $40.
