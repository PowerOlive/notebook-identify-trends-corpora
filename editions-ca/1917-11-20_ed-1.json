For the first time in many a
day there was no racing last week
at any track in the United States.
The .meeting at Pimlico,. Md., closed
Wednesday and the Bowie, Md., rac
ing did not start until Monday..
Usually there is racing at one, two
or three of the tracks in the United
States, Mexico or Canada at all
times of the year. Just how long
it has been since there was no race
meet in progress at any track in
North America would be difficult to
state.
