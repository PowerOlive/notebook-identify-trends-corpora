. THE NEWS has learned from a

covered a great many of the darts
with which he pierced loving hearts
in 1918, and has refilled his quiver.
He recently paid a visit to a Walker
Avenue home, where liis bow was
strung, and-a shaft sped home to the
heart of a handsome Paris girl, while
a short time after one of -his' aides
sent a dart into the heart of a Car
lisle boy. "It is said" that there
will be a wedding soon.
The Louisville Courier-Journal
fyas the following reference under. the

ding," to the recent marriage in Lou
isville of Miss Dorcas Hampton Us
sery, of Paris:
"Another young woman who heard
the call of duty has heard a stronger
call from Cupid, and there is a va
cant position at the Norton Memorial
Infirmary.
"Dr. Milus L. Gunn, student of
the University of Louisville and resi
dent physician at the Infirmary, and
his bride, who until a few days ago
was Miss Dorcas Hampton Ussery,
of Paris, Ky., are 'somewhere in the
United States' on their honeymoon.
"Whep. the call came a year ago
for young women to volunteer for
Red Cross nursing Miss Ussery came
to Louisville and entered the Norton
Infirmary to learn nursing. She met
Dr. Gunn; love, courtship and marri
age followed -naturally.

W. C. Ussery and a niece of Mrs. J.
H. Thompson and Mrs. Volney Fer
guson, of the same city."

BOURBON COUNTY MAN BURNED
TO DEATH IN LEXINGTON.
John Stephens, aged sixty-seven, a
former residnt of the Shawhan vicin
ity, in this county, was burned to
death at his home, 110 East Sixth
street, in Lexington, when the home
was destroyed by a fire thought to
have oringinated from the explosion
of an oil can. Stephens was a car
penter by occupation. When Steph
en's body was pulled to the door of
the room by a recently discharged
soldier, P. C. Lowe, an employe of the
Indian Refining Company, of this
city, it was discovered that he had a
can, presumably a coal oil can, with
which he was, it is supposed, filling
a coal oil stove which was found
lighted in the room when the fire
men made an entrance. Assistant
Fire Chief Sheley, who went to the
fire, stated last night that it was his
opinion that Stephens' death had re
sulted from an explosion of the can
of oil, setting fire to his clothing and
burning him badly about the face
and body. It is alsot nought that his
death was the result of having swal
lowed some of the flames immediately
after the explosion.
When .he was found by Mr. Lowe
and dragged out of the building he
was lying on the bed, where he had
apparently fallen shortly after the
explosion.
Mr. Stephens is survived by one
daughter, Mrs. Smith, of Shawhan,
and two sons. Gay Stephens, now in
the U. S. army, and Orie Stephens,
who is residing in Pennsylvania. He
had been a resident of Lexington for
about twelve years, having moved
there from Shawhan at a time when
there was a. great demand for car
penters. The body was brought to
Shawhan for interment.
