Anti-suffragists are preparedtoday to seek reconsideration of thevote by which the Tennessee Houseratified the Federal suffrage amend-llkned Every Tuesday and Friday ment. Speaker Walker, who changedJte Year. .K.U0-O. .ontns. .i.w r " Z "Z " reconsidera-tion, will make a motion that theHouse rescind its action. His privilege to do so under House rules expires tonight.Suffrage opponents, as they tighten their lines for the final skirmish,express confidence in the result. Suffrage opponents announce that 47members of the House have signed! a pledge to vote to reconsider tneratification resolution. Several otherassemblymen, they predict, will lineup with the anti-suffrage forces before the proposed roll-call, thus insuring a majority for reconsideration. Four thousand persons last nightattended an anti-suffrage mass meet-jmg, at which speaker walker outlined plans tor a battle over suffrageon the floor of the House today.A letter from Governor Cox, readat the mass meeting, comments onthe section of the Tennessee constitution which provides that the Legislature has no power to act on a proposed amendment to the Federal constitution unless its members wereelected after submission of the measure to the States. The present Legislature was elected in November,1918, and the suffrage amendmentwas not submitted until severalmonths later. Governor Cox wrote:"Our platform has made a positivedeclaration on the nineteenth amendment and, as you at once will recognize, the policy of that documentbecomes my own as well. At thesame time, I shall endeavor to speakthe policy of the platform to maintain the properties which your lettersets forth."I have no hesitation in sayingthat Section 32 of Article 2 of theTennessee constitution is a wise plan.It should be adopted in all States.Whether it is in conflict with theFederal constitution as recently interpreted is another matter. Mostlawyers with whom I have talked believe that it is not. However, it isnot within my province to make thisdeclaration."oKENTUCKY WOMEN CAN VOTEIN NOVEMBER.FRIENDS AMAZEDBY HER RECOVERYHad Been In Bad Health So LongShe Lost Fifty Pounds Tanlac Restored HerThe man who has patented acorkscrew is one of those fellows,we presume, who just simply musthave his little joke.LostDEMOCRATIC TICKET&- For President,l-, James M.

Dawson, of Kentucky,that women with the proper residence qualifications in this Statehave a legal' right to vote for President at the November election, hassolved many perplexing questions inconnection -vith the suffrage situation. According to Attorney Richard P. Ernst, of Kentucky, Republ5can nominee for U. S. Senator, thelight of suffrage in Presidentialelections has been conferred on Kentucky women by a law enacted bythe last General Assembly of theState. "Bach State has the constitutional right to fix the qualificationsof electors, and therefore, Mr. Ernstexplained. Kentucky women can votefor Pres'dent under 'the State law,regardless of the fate of the FederalSuffrage amendment. One of thepeculiarities of the Kentucky law isthat it contains no provision forwomen to vote for tbe office of U.

"I had been down in bedso long before I began taking Tanlac." said Mrs. Barick, "that after Irecovered people who knew thefrightful condition I had been inwere amazed. I had suffered foreleven long years and had takenmedicines and tried specialists invarious cities, but, in spite of it allI had gotten so bad off that therewas no hope for my recovery- Mystomach was so bAdly upset thatit even sometimes caused me to haveawful cramps that lasted for hours.Even liquid diets caused this samemisery and I would have such astuffc-d-up. heavy feeling that piybreath would come in short, quickgasps and I would think each breathwas going to be my last. SometimesI had almost deathly sick spells, justlike I was going to faint, which exhausted me so completely that Iwould be in bed for several daysunable to walk a step. Almostevery day I had a headache that wasso severe I could hardly bear it andI olten had dreadful attacks of dizziness. My kidneys were badly disordered. I had a terrible pain in myback that felt like a knife stickingin me. My nights were spent inmisery, my whole system seemed tobe poisoned and my complexionturned yellow as gold. I lost somuch weight that it alarmed me. Idon't b-ilieve any woman ever wentthrough as mucli suffering and hadas little hope as I did and then livedthrough it all to be a well and happywoman."I believe as firmly as I believeanything that Tanlac has saved mylife and miy friends all say my recovery is simply wonderful and thatI am looking as healthy and strongas I ever did. Can eat anything Iwant and digest it without a particle of trouble. I don't know what aheadache is and I am entirely freefrom dizziness and from those weak,fainting spells I used to have. Mykidneys are in splendid condition,-he pains have gone from my backand I sleep soundly every night.

The cost of producing a" newspaper should be based on thecost of producing a sheet that is excellent from the mechanical standpoint, which shall give publishersand editors rewards equal to those incallings requiring equal ability, andwhich shall command the work ofbright and brainy people, making itso attractive to them that they willremain permanently in the business.

C, August17, for the Orient. Kentucky was represented among the missionarypassengers by Robert A. Jacob, of Franklin, whose picture is shown"above, and who has been assigned to educational work at Laiohnwfn.China. Other Kentuckians under appointment of the Baptist ForeignMission Board to do work elsewhere include R. S. Jones, of Murray, who will teach science at Pernambuco, andRev. and Mrs. O. P. Poarch of Louisville, who will serve as instructors in Rio College in Brazil. They will sail inSeptember.When approximately one hundredSouthern Baptist missionaries sailedon the Canadian Pacific liner, the Empress of Japan, from Vancouver, British Columbia, Tuesday, August i7, forfields in the Orient, they formed thelargest group of evangels" of the Christian religion that has ever been sentto foreign fields at a single time by asingle denomination since the beginning of Christian missions.The majority of the appointees ofthe Foreign Mission Board are newworkers, recently come from the various educational institutions of theSouth where they have spent years inpreparation for the duties they areabout to assume in other lands.Appointment and sfending forward ofso large a number of workers at a single time was made possible by thelarger proceeds for missions from theBaptist 75 Million Campaign, fromwhich $20,000,000 will be realized forforeign missions during the five yearscovered by the campaign. Not all otthis fund will be used in employingnew workers, though approximately500 additional men and women will esent out du-ing the five years. Othersums will go to providing more churchbuildings, schools and hospitals, homesfor the missionaries and improvementsof that character, including publishinghouses for turning out the Bible anlother religious literature. Many improvements will be made in missionary institutions already in operationon the foreign fields.Missionary Operations Enlarged.In the new appointees of the ForeignMission Board and a new record wasestablished when sixty-six were "namedby it this summer are a number ofChristian doctors, nurses, teacherd,scientists and women workers, andone expert in farming and stock raising. These will supplement the workof the evangelists in that they willseek to relieve bodily suffering, teachthe boysani girls, pave the way formore efficient homes by interestingmothers in sanitary housekeeping, andby their good work create in the mindsof the people a favorable attitude toward the Christian religion. The instructor in agriculture and stock raising will undertake to reach manyChinese farmers with better methodsof production and thus prove that theChristian missionary is the farmer'sfriend. The majority of the missionaries were born on the farm.While the majority of the new appointees ar3 going to China andJapan, others will sail in Septemberfor work in Africa, Brazil, Argentinaand Chile.World Program Is Planned.Ten foreign fields are occupied bySouthern Baptists today in Africa,Asia, Europe, South America and Mcx-,ico. The work in all these fields will1be strengthened and enlarged as a resuit of the larger funds made available for foreign missions through theBaptist 75 Million Campaign. Newfields have been opened in Europeand the Near East and a million dollars has been appropriated for launching an intensive work in Russia themoment the doors of opportunity areopened there. The Board is greatlstrengthening its work in Palestineand hopes ultimately to give the gospel to hundreds of thousands of people in the land which witnessed theearthly labois of Jesus Christ.Dr. J. B. Gambrell, of Fort Worth,Texas, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, and Dr. E. Y. Mullins of Louisville, Ky., president of thaSouthern Baptist Theological Seminary, are now on a visit to all the Baptist families of the world, conveyingto them thn greetings of good willfrom Southern Baptists and layingthe foundation for a fuller Baptist program for the evangelization of theworld.Money Apportioned to Mission Fields.In the distribution of funds to newwork anions the various mission fleli3occupied by Southern Baptists thfollowing appropriations have beenmade by the Foreign Mission Board:Africa, $233 925, calling for 31 newmissionaries; Argentina, $263,550,calling for 17 new missionaries; Brazil, $1,339,100, calling for 54 new missionaries; Chile, $58,900, calling forsix new missionaries; China, $3,279,125, calling for 331 new missionaries;Europe and the Near East, $3,55S,950;Japan, $819,000, calling for 40 newmissionaries and Mexico, $420,000,calling for eight new missionaries.Work in Homeland Fostered.While a targe sum from the campaign is appropriated to foreign missions, home interests have not beenoverlooked. Appropriations to homoobjects include $12,000,000 for homemissions; 311,000,000 to state missions; $20,000,000 to Christian education, or the better equipment and partial endowment of the 114 educationalinstitutions owned by Southern Baptists; $4,800 000 for the thirteen Baptist hospitan in the South; $4,039,688for the sixteen orphanages, and $2,500,000 for the relief of aged minister!and their dependent families.DON'THLEDParis Citizens Should Read andHeed This AdviceTHE CZAR'S PROPERTY.Just HistoryIn 76The Colonial DameSpun her clothBy Candle flame.In 1860In Crinoline bright,She erected her questsBy Coal Oil light.
