The occupants ofthe machine, two women whosenames could not be learned, realizedtheir danger just as the car toppledover, and applied the brakes in timeto prevent it from running acrossthe railroad tracks over the steepbluff hanging -over Stoner creek.Their danger was seen by employesof a garage in the vicinity whowent to their assistance, and rescued them, uninjured. The car wasremoved from the tracks to thegarage for slight repairs.The names of the occupants couldnot be ascertained, but it was saidthey were from Kenton county. Thecar bore he license tag number05144, and had the initials "I. B.R." on the doors.At a point where the street endsabruptly the tracks of the Louisville& Nashville are located flanked by!a steep wall. There is no fence orother warning to motorists, and butone incandescent street lamp in thevicinity. Several accidents have happened at this point, and somethingshould be done about it leandshould be done to warn travelers oftheir danger. It is very easy andnatural to mistake the turn In thestreet for its continuation, and thismistake may lead to serious consequences.EGGS MUST BE CANDLEDIt would be well for Bourboncounty people to remember that af iter May 15 all eggs must be candled, under a law passed by the lastLegislature, which requires cgg3 tobe candled from May 15 to January15.

""Whenever these fish, get into acreek, pond or any fishing stream,the game-fish contained in the samelwater have an uphill ngnt tor existence. The carp is truly the hog ofthe water, as he feeds by rooting outthe vegetation from the bed andalong the banks of the lakes andstreams. This disturbs the' spawnof the other fish and deprives tliemof their food.We have received complaints fromduck shooters who claimed that ''thecarp had killed all the vegetation intheir favorite waters and that ducksno longer visited them.Many of the States have tried different methods toget rid of the carp,but we have never heard of any whowere successful. The only practicalplan is to seinA them out, butVedoubt if this will ever do more tha'nkeep the increase in check. Arguments have been advocated againstthis method, by-men who contendthat the seiners drag their nets alongthe shores of the lakes and entirelydestroy the spawn of the game fishes,thereby doing more harm than good.Ira Parks is able to be out aftera long illness.P.

"!EXPLORING THE MINDHiiiiiiiimiiinMiimmii.uuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiMHA profound impression has beenmade on the British press "and public by Emile Coue, French psychotherapist, who has been lecturing inEngland. There is nothing new inhis theory that the imagination isresponsible for many of the physicalills -of mankind and that auto-suggestion, guiding the subconsciousmind into healthy channels, is apowerful therapeutic agent; that ithas not heretofore received the attention it deserves was because it.was brought into disrepute throughattempts to effect cures in caseswhich had been improperly diagnosed. Coue's cardinal principle is thatthe imagination, which has its forceand plays a more important partthan the conscious will in guidingman's destiny.The mind is a vast and almostunexplored field, in which it seemscertain that discoveries of tremendous importance are still to bemade. Psychology is a new science,investigators having awakened to thefact that conscious mental operationsconstitute only a small part of thework that the mind does only in recent years. The unconscious or subconscious operations, of whichdreams and feats vof the memorygive some intimation, compose Dyfar the greater part.The mind can be compared to aniceberg, of .which only from oneseventh to one-twelfth' is seen, the"remainder being under water. Thebig task for psychologists is to reveal the workings of the submergedpart of the mind. Even though therevelation be futile to cure disease, it undoubtedly will cure humanity in otjier ways.We Handle All Kinds of iElectrical Novelties IElectric Washing Machines, Irons, Toasters,Broilers, Chafing Dishes, Electroliers, AllKinds of Bulbs, Etc.Ga$ HeatersAll Sizes and Prices.

The British governmpnt is. therefore, takine: ax commendable step in demanding that itsjdebtor nations recognize these obligations.Washington has declined to consider the debts owed to this countryby European nations in a sentimental way, and is preparing to havethem placed on the basis of accountsreceivable, although there probablywill be no disposition on the part ofthe United States to press paymentto the embarrassment of any nation.All the nations of Europe shouldbe the better for having to pay theirdebts. It may be left to France tocollect the last mark from Germanyand it may have a disciplinary effectupon other nations if they understand that they must pay the costof their own participation in war,even though they were on the defensive.
