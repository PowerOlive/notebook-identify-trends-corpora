iuiss iNOja Keaci, one or tne seniors
at M. F. C, entretaiaed her class,
members of the faculty and Dr. and
Mrs. C. C. Fisher with a f ve course
supper in the dining room of the col
lege Thursday evening, beginning at
7:30. This was perhaps the most
elaborate entertainment ever given by
any senior to her class. The class is
made up of eleven bright young ladies
and thsy constitute a studious jolly
bevy of girls. It was not known until
within a few days prior to the event
that Miss Redd was going to do this.
She is one of the most popular girls in
the institution and is loved by all who
know her. The lunch was largely pre
pared at her home in Paintsville and
was brought to her by her bachelor
brother who a-rived Thursday at noon,
leaving on the afternoon train of the
same day. He said that bevy of hand
some girls was too much for him. Fol
lowig is the menu:
First course Turkey, cranberries,
gravey, dressing, potatoes, beaten bis
cuits, peas.
Second coruse Fruit salad in tulip
cups, olives, pickles, sanwdiches,
Toast by Virginia Crutcher.
Third coruse Candy.
Fourth course Cream with nuts and
cherries, fruit cake. Toast by Miss
Long.
Fifth course Coffee and mints.
Miss Redd was handsomely remem
bered by her class and faulty. Others
of the lass will entertain in a like
manner during the winter.
Two Points of View.
On one occasion, at a party given
by Sir John Millais, Lady Halle rose
to play the violin, when to her in
tense amusement she heard Landseer
exclaim: "Good gracious! A wom
an playing the fiddle!" On the other
hand, an old-tashloned nobleman,
when he saw a gentleman sit down to
the piano, contemptuously remarked:
1 wonder If the creature can sew!"
