Over-Churched; Upder-Guarded.
A citizen of Shirley objects to the
vote; of the town authorizing an out-of-town
policeman, on the ground that
there are six churches in the village,
and that if it does not behave itself
what it needs is a missionary, and not
an officer. Possibly if there were nor
more than two churches in the town
there would be enough public spirit
to make either missionaries or police
men unnecessary. Lowell Courier

Woman With Sail Clubs.
"In the early days," says Hugh Ful
lerton in the American Magazine, "a
woman with a ball club was a rarity.
Now it is common for seven or eight
players to take their wives on long
trips, and sometimes their children.
Managers admit that the women have
a restraining and refining influence,
but they are not wanted. Often man
agers make wry faces when notified
that some of the men are taking their
wives. The women take the minds of
the players off the game sometimes a
good thing, but more frequently a bad
one. If there should be a quarrel the
wives are certain to take sides. Two
of the Cubs lost their tempers one
night and clashed. It was over in a
minute, and both were sorry. Chance,
sitting as judge, passed this sentence:
Til fine you each $10, and if either of
you dares tell his wife I'll make it
100.' "
Counted Ants- For Two Years.
A marvel of 'scientific research, says
our Berlin correspondent, has been ac
complished by Professor Yemg, who
has been investigating the interior
condition of ant hills. By dint of pa
tient observation Professor Yemg dis
covered that an ant hill two feet in
height was inhabited by 93,780 ants.
Other ant hills of almost the same size
were found to contain G7.500, 53,000
and 48,000 ants respectively. These ob
servations and the counting of the tiny
insects occupied two years. London

A Lottery Romance.
There was a lottery romance at the
Credit Foncier in Amiens recently
when the drawing of lottery bonds
took place, dn the winning number of
a prize of 100,000 francs being called
out a woman jumped to her feet,
waved a small piece of paper, shrieked
and fainted. She Avas a hardworking
tailoress, fifty-eight years ojd, who in
vested 100 francs against a rainy day.
She "bought lottery bonds with the
rnoney, and the winning of the prize
has made her independent.
Uses of Glass.
In Switzerland goods are weighed
with glass weights. In fact, on the
continent generally glass is taking the
place of wood and iron in many direc
tions, for it can be made stronger even
than stone, and the day is not far off
when houses will be built entirely of
glass.

7" Thackeray's Disfigured Nose.
The usual account of how Thack
eray was disfigured says that Venables
broke the novelist's nose in a fair
fight. John Ward in Notes and Que
ries supplies another version. About
a year after Thackeray's death Mr.
"Ward was traveling on one of the
main railways and had as companions
two old ladles who knew Thackeray
well. One of them said the novelist
had told them this story:
"Being one of the youngest pupils
(at Charterhouse), he was chosen by
one of the older lads, a rather proud
aristocrat in his waV, to act as his
fag. Thackeray bore it "as well as he
could, but demurred to some, more ar
bitrary command than usual and flatly
refused to obey, whereupon the young
"aristocrat caught Thackeray up, held
his head under his arm and with the
heel of his boot used as a hammer
beat the beautiful aquiline nose quite
flat -with his face in fact, breaking
and injuring its structure completely
the excuse being, 'You'll clean my
boots next time, sir.' "
Before his injury Thackeray was,
the same authority says, remarkably
handsome. Westminster Gazette.
Won His Supper.
Terry is of that class of gentry
whose nimble wit is the only thing
which keeps them from starving in
this day of practicalities. Terry is a
great coffee drinker, and many are the
expedients he will undertake to get it
when he is without funds. The other
evening he walked into a cafo and said
to the proprietor:
"Good evening, Mr. M."
"How are you, Terry?" was the re
sponse. "Pretty good, pretty good, barrin' a
bad t'roat. It's glad I am to see yer
self lookin' so smart and yer doin' so
well in yer business, now, ain't yer?
It's glad I am, too, about that. By the
way, Mr. M., would yer be - afther
trustin' me this evenin'?"
"Trust you! Terry, I wouldn't be
trustin' my own father."
"Thrue fer you, Mr. M. If I'd know
ed yer father as well as you perhaps I
wouldn't trust him meself !"
And Terry got his coffee and rolls.

When Nature Was Timekeeper.
In the British museum is a large
stone composed of carbonate of lime,
which would serve perfectly as a day
laborer's calendar inasmuch as it would
indicate to him every Sunday and holi
day of the year, though not the day of
the month. Moreover, the stone is an
actual time record of the work done
for a long period in an English coal
mine.
The "Sunday stone," as it is called,
was removed from a colliery drain.
When the miners were at work the
water running through the drain left
a deposit colored black by the coal
dust, but when no work was being
done the water ran down clear and left
a white deposit These deposits in the
course of time built up the stone.
Each day of work left a black streak,
immediately followed by a white streak
made during the night. , Wide white
streaks indicate the holidays and Sun
days. Harper's Weekly.
Back to Adam
A parchment roll over a foot wide
and nineteen feet long containing the
genealogical tree of King Henry VI. Is
in the Welsh National library at
Aberystwith. The work is beautifully
executed in tabular fashion of the lat
ter half of the fifteenth century and is
illuminated with miniatures, rich capi
tals aid red ornamental letters. The
pedigree is traced from Adam, and
the particulars occupy a red line of
six yards on the scroll. On the left
side of the pedigree appears the list
of archbishops of Canterbury down to
John Stafford and on the right side
the list of Welsh princes down to Ed
ward I. Dundee Advertiser.
Eskimo Trial Marriage.
The trial marriage is an ineradi
cable custom among the Eskimos. If a
young man and woman are not suited
with each other they try again, and
sometimes several times, but when
they find mates to whom they are
adapted the arrangement is generally
permanent. If two men want to marry
the same woman they settle the ques
tion by a trial of strength, and the
better man has his way. "The North
Pole," by Robert E. Peary.
