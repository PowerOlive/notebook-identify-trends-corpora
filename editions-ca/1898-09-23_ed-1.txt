SIXTHThe Remnant of the Regiment ReachedCincinnati Tuesday IVlgrht andReceived an OvationCincinnati Sept 2L Five monthsago the 6th United States infantrymarched through this city on its wayto southland to do and die for itscountry The scene which attendedits departure was one which will neverbe forgotten Fort Thomas hadbeen its home for yearsand the good people of theQueen City had learned to know andlove the soldiers of the 6th Five hundred strong they marched away to facepestilence famine and all the attendant horrors of cruel war and thousands of citizens turned out to bid themfarewellAt midnight the remnant of thatbrave throng again entered the gatesof Cincinnati Sickness and the bullets of the enemy had so decimatedtheir ranks that there remained but82 of the gallant boys who had left behind them all that they loved and heldmost dear upon that memorable afternoon in the early springAnd what a homecoming it wasUnder the vaulted roof of the GrandCentral depot there took place a scenewhich will live as one of the brightestpages in the Queen Citys history Itwas a scene which is absolutely beyondthe power of pen to describe a scenethat wrenched the nerves of thestrongest men and sent women intohysterics Thousands of people rushedthrough the gates leading to the depotand tore their clothes and struggledlike demons to get one glimpse of thereturned heroes They wanted to welcome the fighting 6th back home butfrom a welcome it became an absolutef r enzy of hysterical excitementIt was impossible to control thesurging throngs The people of Cincinnati had waited long to show the6th how much they love and honorthem and when the moment camethey were not to be denied There hadbeen some attempt to place a guardabout the depot and keep every oneoutside except the relatives and immediate friends of the boys in blue butit would have been just as easy to turnthe course of a mighty river with aspoonful of sand The people chargedthe police and surged into the depot ina mighty irresistible throngIt seemed as thou the keynote of human nature was touched in an instant Wives clasped their husbandsin their arms sisters mothers andsweethearts did the same little prattling infants clutched and pulled atthe bearded faces of the soldiers Andthrongh it all those bronzed heroeswho had faced the shock of battle without a tremor stood helolessand wept silentlyMor very joy Therewere other jvomen there and theywere weeping too but not in the samespirit Their heroes were still in fairCuba forever beyond the reach ofhuman emotion and in the happy reunion of the moment these poor womenhad no partThe thousands of spectators wepttoo It was one great big tribute tohuman love But the first greetingsover the scene soon changed Therewere sharp words of command and thesoldier boys fell in line Bands beganto play and out of the depot into thestreet the boys marched amid thewildest enthusiasm The secondsection had arrived shortly after the first and the same sceneswere repeated They too marchedthrough the depot into the streetThen at the word of command thetriumphal procession began It was agrand ovation all along the line ofmarch Cheering throngs filled thestreets fireworks were displayed uponall sidesWhen the regiment reached Newportthere was another ovation The citizens of that city turned out en masseand gave the boys a welcome

the American revolution while Spain has never heeded itnor the loss of her own colonies Yetit really was not until 50 years agothat their methods sharply divergedAs early as 1778 Spain had begun toopen her dependencies to foreigntrade and early in this centurythey were allowed to trade withone another So likewise although great changes had beenearlier made in the English coloniesthe spirit of monopoly and of a restrictive policy was in force until about1815 So far as relates to the evils ofthe colonial system then the two werenot very unlike But into the field ofadministrative reform and the grantof autonomous powers to her coloniesSpain never has enteredThe abuses of the early part of thecentury characterize also its lateryears Discrimination against the native born even of the Spanishstock officials who regard the colonyas a mine to be worked not a trust tobe administered forced dependenceupon the mother country for manufactures even for produce so far as duties can effect it self government stifled representation in the cortes denied or a nullity a civil service unprogrcssive ignorant sometimes corrupt compare these handicaps withthe growth the prosperity the independence above all the decent and orderly administration of the colonies ofEngland One of the wonderful thingsin this half century is that army ofBritish youth with but little specialtraining or genius or even perhapsconscious sympathy for the worklearning to administer the great andgrowing Indian and colonial empirehonestly and wisely and well withcourage and judgment equal to emergencies animated by an everydayworking sense of duty and honor butnot very often making any fuss orphrases about it It is not that Spanish colonial government is worse thanformerly which is costing it now sodear but that it is no better whilethe worlds standard has advanced andcondemns it Xever yet has Spainlooked at her colonies with their ownwelfare uppermost in her mind Shehas never outgrown the old mistakentheories Her fault is medievalismalias ignoranceIt is not a cause for wonder therefore quite apart from special sourcesof discontent that Cuba which by position is thrown into contact with progressive peoples should chafe at herleading strings Without reference tothe corruption and cruelty arroganceinjustice and repression which are alleged against the mother country without rhetoric and without animosity vwemay fairly say that Spain is losingCuba perhaps all her colonies simplybecause she has not conformed to thestandard of the time in the matter ofcolonial government If England hadnot altered her own methods her colonies would long since have abandonedher as opportunity offered The wonder really is that Spain has held hersso long for Cuba at least owing toits exceptional fertility and positionhas relatively outstripped its decliningmother Prof Theodore SWoolsey iCenturyLIQUEFIED AIRT-Some Queer Discoveries Which HaveBeen Made in Experimentswith ItThe phenomena of

how manybullets were fired during the conflictbut since that cannot be ascertainedit is striking enough to consider thatthe 277000 men- now composing thearmy of the United States carry intheir cartridge belts more than 27000000 rifle balls At all events theywould carry that many if all of themwere armed with the new magazinerifle commonly known as the KragJorgensen100 cartridges being allowed to each man Before long all ofUncle Sams soldiers will be providedwith this weapon instead of the archaic SpringfieldThus equipped the 277000 men nowenlisted would carry 372 tons of bullets at their waists and this makesreckoning of only the leaden balls andnot of the cartridges containing themEach of the cartridges is a bit overthree inches long and if all of thosecontained in the belts of the soldierswere placed end1 to end they wouldstretch 1306 miles Just think of thedestructive power represented by thailine of cartridgesThe barrel of one of these regulation rifles is 30 inches long If all ofthem the 277000 were placed endto end so as to make a continuoustube the latter would extend 131miles or just about the distance fromWashington to Philadelphia But torender the thing more striking consider the fact that the new rifle willkill a man at 4400 yards This makesa total effective range of 692500 milesfor 277000 rifles Accordingly if thevelocities of all the bullets could

dysentery and nearly all the spring dwindling is causedby too early brood rearing At leasttwo old bees are lost for ever youngbee reared diiring the winter I prefer wintering in a single wall hive onthe summer stands I know that alarge majority of the beekeepers differ with me in this Experience hastaught me that there is more dangerin bees becoming too warm than thereis from cold When 1he hive becomestoo warm the bees become uneasyand consume a large amount of honeystart brood rearing and unless theycan have a good fly in a few days dysentery will follow Cellar winteringhas never been a
