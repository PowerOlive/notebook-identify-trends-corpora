lost forever Hehas intimated that the official administration of the island was honeycombed with either dishonesty orincapacity and that in view of thisfact it was idle for Spain to be sending soldiers to the island for no matter how brave privates might be theofficers were looking for private gainor public honor and sacrificed theirtroops for personal considerationsFrom the conversations of the Spanish minister who has usually been soiguarded it is taken for granted inthe diplomatic corps that Spain isgetting ready to drop Cuba as gracefully as may be The monarchy willostensibly fight to the end but it isalmost ready for surrender providedsomething can be done to cater toCastillian pride The Spanish minister has seen Secretary Sherman veryoften of late and while no open

in Augustorae 12 yeats ago Grahams store wascrowded inside and out There mustJbave been 40 or 50 in the store in frontof the Counters and twice as many onthe sidewalk waiting their turn to goin and buy Behind the counters besides Hank Black Graham himself wasworking away in his shirtsleeves MrsGraham was helping the best she couldand then there was Lncetta iVllen MrsGrahams unmarried sisterIt was close that night outsideseemed as if the heat from the sunshineor a mightv hot midsummer dav hadJvind of got angled up in the air like-and inside twas worse for there wasbalf a dozen kerosene lamps burning-and the room was full of smoke fromcheap cigars and clay pipes Inside andout everybody was talking mostly aboutsiothing at all as folks do wlien theygpo to the store and lucetta was pouringout some aniline dye while Hankwas tying up sugar I was standing bythe counter close to Hank and Lucettawhen she said suddenlyThere he is Hank and he is somebody He can do things Youd bestllook hard at him and see a man foronce in vour lifeHank turned quick and upset the dyeinto the sugar barrel and I got so interested in the mixup that J only got aglimpse of the chap the girl referred toHe didnt look to be much of a man torme and I should never have Given him ar second thought only for what IdIucetta say though he did lookdifferent from the Slatertown youngmen He was one of the civil engineersthat was laying out the new railroadHank was so busy then that he didntfind out much about the chap till thenext day and then Lucetta told himLike most young fellows in Slater-TToTilr 1 irl

was the day he had fixed on- to say something very particular to theyoung Avoman and they hadnt gonevery far before he said it 1 dont knowthe language he used but it amountedto asking her to marry him though hetook an awful long time to do it andIucetta who was bound not to say a- word till he had finished thought hednever stop I know pretty nearly whatshe said to him for she told me thatverynightshe being my cousin and Ibeing something like an older brotherafco heijust turned and looked at him aTittle while Cousin Jim and then I toldhim somethingHank Black 1 said you ought tobe ashamed of yourself You want towake up before you ask any girl tomarrv youHank seemed a good deal surprisedand then I said lurtherYou think von are don- wellcause youre clerk in Grahams storethe biggest in Slatertown and the-whole valley for that matter and yourice sort of rich because youve got ajiorse and buggy and a little money inhe savings bank and your wages havebeen raised from M0u a year to 26 amonth All that seems worth while toyou But that young chap that cameinto the store last night earns almostas much in a month as you do in ayear and lie isnt any brighter thanyou either Hes awake though lieis a man in the world But you youare asleep You are like a beetle in iisIboleWhen 1 got that far the girl confcinued Hank braced up long enoughro aslc me u I t nought theyoung engineer

blazing eyes on me and said if Iwanted to make ont that I was as stupidas Hank T might try it but she knewAbetterXext day Hank quit lie said hedTad enough clerking it in his and-advised Graham to find another manrinfht awav Then Hank did what 1thought was the dumbest thing he wasever guilty of He never said good bylo Lucetta but he went and hunted upthat engineer and asked him if he didnt-want to hire -a chainmanThe engineer looked Hank over andasked him if his horse and buggy- would go with hiiii Hank said itwould and was hired on the spot ThatJob lasted Hank most a year duringwhich he worked like a slave for twodollars a day dragging chain and doing all sorts of odd jobs for the engineer hauling him around in the buggyand actually lending his rig for theto take Lucetta driving Butnever once did Hank himself speak orVbowto tier again He didnt cen let n- that he knew there was such a girland once when I thought like a foolthatt could straighten things out by-talking to him about her he said thatXthe only Lucetta Allen hed eveiknownwas dead and I wished I hadnt openedmy mouth-When the engineer told the youngman he had no further nse for himHank broke all up It was onty for aminute though and then he asked theengineer whv he couldnt take himalong to his next job to make an engineer of himMake an engineer of you you thickheaded young cub Kb one could dothat Youre a good hand to lug chainsand drive a buggy horse but time isntlong enough to educate youId got acquainted with the engineerlong before that He wasnt a badsort of chap but he kind of lookeddown on folks that hadnt as much education as he had He told me aboutHanks wanting to bean engineer andit tickled him a lotI began to see how the land lay andI was going to hunt Hank up againwhen one day he came into the postoffice here and said he wanted to talkwith me all alone Hanks a distantcousin of mine too you know thoughhes no relation to Lucetta AllenWell Hank made a clean breast ofall his feelings to me He said hedfound out that to be somebody hedgot to have an education And hedgot to be somebod3r just- to spite Lucetta if for not other reason He didntwant to mairry her as he had once buthe did want to show her that he couldamount to something He had soldhis horse and buggy and he had 250altogether or thereabouts He didntknow how much education he could getfor that but he was going to use it allup and if it took more money would Ilend him some till he could earnenough being an engineer to pay upI told him to come again a week laterand then I drove over the hills to Slatertown and talked with Lucetta Shebegged of me to help Hank and insisted on giving me 100 of her own moneywhich I was to let him have withouttelling him where it came from I justhad to take it but I didnt letHank haveit I banked it in her name and thenI told Hank to go ahead and go to schoolHe must earn as much as he could but ifhis earnings and his savings fell shcxrthe could write to me and I wouldnt seehim fail for the lack of a few dollarsWell he hadti hard time of it WhenhegotwhereSto the polytechnic institute-and so not yet 20 andyuLjiunmn jimBgiym umiyiiHinTHE BOURBON ESPRID AT AWL 2 18Quicker than I can tell you he had cutthe laces of his shoes kicked them offand jumped into that awful stream ofyellow water and was swimming forthe girl The buggy hadnt been upsetover and over a hundred times itseemed to him before- he got to thebuggy He finally reached it all righthowever and not knowing what elseto do climbed up on the seat besideof Lucetta Just then the horse thathad made all -the mischief began tostruggle and in a moment the buggywent over and threw them into thewater Hank remembers that just before the buggy upset he heard a frightful crash up stream and surmised thatthe bridge had been carried away asindeed it had and that was whatcaused Hank most of the trouble thatwas to come The buggy must havefloated down stream much slower thanthe current was running and that wasnatural enough seeing that it was pretty heavy and the wheels reached downso far probably as to drag on the bottomAnyway the pieces of the brokenbridge came down enough faster thanthe buggy so that just as the youngchap had got to swimming strong forthe shore a piece of lumber hit himand knocked both of them clean nnderthe water Hank told me afterwardthat he was as clear headed as ever hewas in his life while he was under waterand he remembers perfeptly how hecameto the surface with Lucetta on hisarm After that he doesnt know whathe did but in some way he got toshore and took Lucetta with him Thenhe fainted away with the pain for thebeam that had struck him had brokenhis left arm By that time Lucetta hadgained her senses and she called forhelp till some one came and took themboth away Hank to my house and Lucetta to GrahamsI thought be reconciled thenbut thev werent Neither would hearPLUNGED INTO THE MUDDY WATERthev turn out engineers in assorted lots he found tint he couldntget into the school till he had done alot of preliminary studying had to gothrough a preparatory school or academy and find out about the whole parcelof things hed never even heard thenames of But he settled down to hiswork like a good fellow and wrote tome regular After hed been a year inthe preparatory school where he wasthe oldest of the lot being past 21 hewas ready to take the polytechnic examinations all right and he wentthrough with colors flying The professors told me he had done more studying and gone faster than anyone theydever had in the school before But itmost- killed him It took all the redout of his face it made his hands whiteand the muscles in his airms soft andT was afraid he was going to die SoI got him to come here for vacation andhere he saw Lucetta aq ainlie wouldnt have seen her thoughif it- hadnt been for the big storm thatcame up sudden one day in July Bothhe and the girl luul declared theywouldnt meet for worlds and Ithought- best to humor them particularly as my wife agreed with me thatId better Hank was out fishing thatday and it happened that he wasunder the short bridge not far fromSlatertown when the storm came upMavbe you remember it Anywav itwas the worst storm we ever had hereIt was something like a western cloudburst 1 guess There was plenty ofhail and the water came down in barrelsful not drops It wasnt half anhour before the creek was so full thatHank had to get out firom Under hisshelter in a hiurry In no time he wasdrenched andhe was wondering wheretoilnd cover when he saw a horseand buggy coming on the other sideof the stream as if the evil one wasii pursuit straight for the briflge Oneglance showed him it was a runawayand another that the driver was Lucetta He saw the horse was coiningacross the bridge and he braced himself to stop the runaway but beforethe bridge was crossed the horse shiedsuddenly and jumped right into thatroaring torrent of muddy water Youknow rheri was no rail to the shortbridge 7 hen Hank showed that hehad plenty oi nerve and wsnt afraidof a little flood whether he was somebody or notThere wasnt half a ehanc in at housand for him to save her and hedhave known- it if hed ever stopped tothink which I dont suppose he didto seeing the other and when his aumwas well it was time for Hank to goback to school That fall Lucetta started out to get an education tooHank will be somebody sure enoughCousin Jim she said and though 1never want to see him again even ifhe did save my life I propose to behis equal and more if 1 canShe was two year vounirer than hov -- -i jbenjrbrightand quick she got on very fast a

thereIt was queer enough after he had beenthere a couple of years that this sameengineer that had made him all thetrouble at first was put on his staff ina subordinate position but so it wasand Hank has lold me two or threetimes in his lettersthat the fellow accepted the situation like a gentlemanthough it did seem to gall him a littleLucetta finished her schooling withcolors flying too t had to lend her alittle money to help her through besides returning her own that she triedto let Hank have but she s paid meback all right from the sale of herbooks You see she found out at schoolthat she

of that width50 feet long will be ample for an ordinary family requiring about one poundof seed It will require about threeyears from the time of sowing until thebed is in full bearing but once established is good for 20 years It shouldbe sown in drills one foot apart andwhen the plants are four or live incheshigh they should be thinned out sothat the plants will be nine inches apartfrom each other in all the rows Greatcare must be taken for the first year tokeep down all weeds as soon as theyappear else they will choke up and destroy the young seedling asparagusfWllMlSjTHE -PALMETTO

horticulturists have almost given up trying to educate thepublic to put away the hatchet sawshears and to a great extent the pruning knife and to do all with the fingerard thumb in May and June In the oldworld this knowledge is more diffusedWriting of orange culture in Italy oneof our consuls says that there the ob-ject aimed at in pruning is to bring thegreatest surface of the tree possible tothe
