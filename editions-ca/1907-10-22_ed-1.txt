uponnational upon uponnational Inational politics and I want to give giv giveyouyou two reasons why I believe that thatevery thateveryevery Democrat should be out at the thepolls th thpolls epolls this year and vote the DemocratIc Democrat Â¬ic ticket from top topto to bottom bottomInIn the first place Kentucky is on onof one onoof eof our Democratic states and I do dlnot d dnotnot want ant us to have to enter a ana anationar na national Â¬tional tionarcampaign campaign handicapped by b Re Republican Â¬publican victory in in the state of Ken Â¬tucky tucky KenItucky There is no local reason KenI why whyyou whyyoushould should turn downyou an administra Â¬ i Itlon Ition that lias administered ad the gov govII boyernl Â¬ernment ern ent nt economically and in your in interest Â¬ IIterest If f you want to find a contrast contrastbetween contrastbetween tbetween a state administration that thatIs thatisis Democratic and a state administra administration administration Â¬tion that is Republican you can go gointo g ginto ointo the states where the Democrats Democratcontrol Democratscontrolcontrol like the state of Missouri DemocratI for forinstance fo foinstance r Iinstance and a a compare the expense expensei expenseof e jof the government In the administra administration Â¬tion of the state affairs with the ad a administration iIministration in states which Republl j icans control For instance comparI compare compareMissouri eMissouri a Democratic state with withI withPennsylvania wi wiPennsylvania t I iPennsylvania a Republican state and an anyou dyou you can understand the difference d ifierenc e between be Â¬tween the two kinds of administra adminIstration administration beI Â¬ Ition It is natural that the Democrats DemocratsI Democratsshould Democratshould s ishould be more economical than Republicans Re Rei Republicans j j I i Ipublicans because Democrats teat teattat teach ithat taxation taxationis is a necessary evil to ba b birne e i iilimeuiine only so far as is necessary fo foL for forL rforI IL L support ipport of the government governmentVhcreas governmen governmenWhereas tWhereas the Republican party has for foa quarter of a century taught the doc doetrine Â¬ i itrinetrine that taxation is a blessing and an anif iif people have ha yc a hard time all you yoihave Ihave to do is to increase their taxes taxesinin order to lighten their burden and andincrease am I Iincreaseincrease their blessings blessings It is nat natural Â¬ural that those who believe that tax taxorlon Â¬ation is a necessary evil should sho ld limit limiit fit i it and restrict it as much as possibleand possible Â°and it is perfectly natural that thos thoswho those ewho in national politics teach that tha tia tariff is blessing to the people e 1I Ishould giveblessing give them as much of thftl thi lblessing as s possible when they have Xchance to administer adI linister the theoffices theofficesthis offices < i ii iThen iThen there is istween this difference bo botween b I Itweentween the way the Democrat looks at atthings and the way the Republicanlooks at things thingscan When I say Republi Â¬can I do not mean the average Re Republican

weredreamels weredreamersdreamers in the Bible and tbit thdt the themostmost prominent one was Joseph and andbecause andbecausebecause Josephs brothers called him himaa dreamer and they did not like his hisdreams hisdreamsdreams they hated him They plot plotted Â¬PlotIted PlotIted to kill him and when he was sent sentout sentoutout by his father to his brethren who whohad whohadhad their flocks in Dotha they saidLL said saidHereLL Here comes comAS the dreamer let us put puthim puthimhim away and be done with him But Butfinally Butfinallyfinally they decided that insteadyrf insteatWlkilling instea f fkillingkilling him they would just put Iirm Iirmdown Mm fm fmdowndown in a pit and let the father be believe bethat Â¬lieve that he had been killed in some someway somewayway by a wild beast Then some mer Â¬chants merIchants came along and they merI took tooleJoseph tookJosephJoseph out of the pit and sold him himand himandand sent him down into Egypt and andthen Ithen they congratulated themselves themselvesand themselvesandand said Now we are rid of the thedream thedreamerdreamer dream r and things went along for forawhile forawhileawhile until they had almost forgot forgotten
