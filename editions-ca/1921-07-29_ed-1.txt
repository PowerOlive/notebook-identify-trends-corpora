Hail was reported 'in the vicinity of the homesof Mrs. Charles C. Leer and JesseTurney, their tobacco crops being injured to some extent by the peltinghail, which' cut through the leaves.Branches in the immediate neighborhood overflowed the roads. On bothsides of Stoner creek for some distance, limbs of trees wege blown off,and in a number of Instances, asnoted personally by THE NEWSman Wednesday afternoon large treeswere blown down.The storm did not cover all portions of the county, being severest inthe sections toward Millersburg andvicinity. In Paris the- downpourlasted but a few minutes. The rainwas not sufficient to relieve the situation, which is becoming acute. Stockwater is becoming scarce throughoutthe county. In some places in thecity the unusual demand on cisternshas caused the supply to run so lowas to compel the owners to partlynil them with hydrant water.Twenty-five acres of tobacco, ready9to be topped, was destroyed by a hailstorm which visited a section of Scottcounty Tuesday afternoon. The hailstorm was followed by a general rainwhich promisedto aid crops over theentire county. The hail fell alongthe Iron Works pike,' four miles fromGeorgetown. .Bourbon county farmers whosecrops are burning up will be surprised to receive this statement fromGovernment officials at Washington:"Prolonged drouths, practicallyworld-wide, promises the Americanfarmer unparalleled prosperity forseveral decades." What the farmerswant now is rain, not promises ofprosperity in 2935.NOTICE TOBACCO HENEVERY MEMBER OF THE COOPERATIVE BURLEY TOBACCOMARKETING ASSOCIATION ISEARNESTLY REdUESTED TOMEET THE MERCHANTS ANDBUSINESS MEN OF PARIS AT THSENGINE HOUSE (EIRE DEPARTMENT) ON TO-MORROW AFTERN00N AT 2:45 O'CLOCK TO PARADE WITH THEM AND HELPBOOST FOR THE fclG MEETING ATTHE COURT HOUSE ON MONDAY,WHEN HON.

Thereseems to be a peculiar fascinationin watching ball players in action.Among the fans, we find some women, although men are in a majority. When girls and women accompany their men friends to thegame they ask many foolish questions about the plays on the diamond.

ED BEDFORDXA VOTE FOR R. ,ED BEDFORDFOR SHERIFF IS A VOTE FORFRED IJNK AND D. E. CLARK.EXPRESSION IN PRINTWhen we speak of an "artist,"the popular conception that flashesinto the mind is that of a painter,sculptor, musician or some otherenvoy fromi dreamland. But thisconception does not get at the heartof this matter. A real artist is onewho is able to give impressive expression to the deepest emotions ofthe heart, the nobles convictions ofthe mind and the most glorious experiences of the soul. The heightof the artist's attainment is guagedby his ability to do this regardlessof the mode of expression he uses.viewed in this light, all otherartists are outclassed by -the orators and editors. Which of thesetwo classes is entitled to the throne,would be a go6d question for debate.Those who pick up a newspaper,read about half a dozen articles thatseem common place before they findone that impresses them and sticksin their minds. They pass by halfa dozen advertisements withoutnoticing them; then one staresthem in the face and they read it.fThey overlook all the ordinary stuffand read something that they knowis always interesting. This is amanifestation of the difference between simply being a writer and being an artist being a man who canimpressively express in print thebest of human thought, emotion andexperience.The man who is an adept athandling display, especially illustrated display, can make the printed word attain all the power of themost eloquent of orators.Even granted that the editor,with all his opportunity to premeditatedly and precisely shape his expression, is no more than ona parwith the orator, he still has thedecided -advantage of a much widerhearing.If you have the soul of an artistthe printing business is the placefor you.As an artist the editor needs envyno one.FORRE.-ELECTI0NVOTE FOR E.

The second year'scrop may be grazed off entirely orgrazed until late May and allowed togrow up for seed. Another way ofhandling the second year's" crop is tomow it with a high stubble whenit is about 18 inches high and letthe material rot. The second growthfollowing this practice will make anexcellent seed crop that is not tootall to bind and one which willmake as much seed as can be harvested successfully from a crop thatwas not grazed or cut to hold itback."There are two seasons of theyear during which under favorableconditions sweet clover may be cutfor hay. .The first is the autumn ofthe same year the seed was sownand the second is the followingspring. This latter period is theone in which perhaps most sweetclover in Kentucky is cut for hay.The crop is harvested .when from24 to 30 inches high and before theblooms appear. There are manyfarmers who are successful and wellpleased with this method of handling the crop. However, the coarsequality of such hay, the difficultyin curing the thick, fleshy stemsand the loss of leaves in handlingis so great that many farmers object to it and say it is not worththe trouble. This keeps many fromgrowing the crop."It is a mistake to think that because sweet clover is a legume andlooks something like alfalfa, it mustbe cut often and handled the sameway. Proper understanding of howbest to handle sweet clover createsand keeps friends of the crop, whilemisunderstanding simply leads todisappointment. .Many farmers havecut hay during ' the second year'sgrowth and killed their stand. Thisis a real danger and the sensiblething to do is never to handle itthat way."oATTENTION, FARMERS!BEAR IN MIND THE SCARCITYAND HIGH PRICES OP COAL PREVALENT DURING THE LAST SEVERAL WINTERS, AND LAY DTYOUR SUPPLY NOW, WHILE YOUCAN GET HIGHEST GRADES OPCOAL AT COMPARATIVELY LOWPRICES.
