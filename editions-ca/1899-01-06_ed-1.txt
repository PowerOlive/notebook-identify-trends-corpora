That Gen Miller Has the Situation at Iloilo Well fci liuiidThe Ainero us ToiieI Tuat They CanJLirdat Iioiio if Unarmed Kvery Preparation is IJeuijr Madi for Resistance Upon the lartof the RebelsWashington Jan 4 Gen Otis comniinji at Manila has cabled the wardej artment that in his opinion GenMiller has the situation well in handiloilo and that he fully understands the purpose of he presidentnot to crowd the insurgents unduly It is highly desirable that ahostile collision between the American forces and the insurgents beavoided at all hazards at leastpending- the ratification of the peacetreaty and as Gen Miller understandsnow this purpose on the part of thepresident he will be guided by it andmay be relied upon to resort to forceonly under absolute compulsion Theofficials here are now fully satisfiedthat the trouble at Iloilo may be traceddirectly back to the Spanish colonelwho was the senior Spanish army officer in the Philippine group anddirectly in command of the Viasaysgroup including the principal islandof Panay and the city and garrison ofIloilo Gen Otis reports show thatthough besieged with his 800 soldiersin Iloilo by a superior force the position oi the Spanish was thoroughlytenable They had repulsed every atof the insurgents and hadinflicted great loss upon the latter and altogether there was noreason why they should not haveheld out indefinitely This was particularly the case in view of thethe part of the Spaniards thatby the terms of the treaty the Unitedeminent had undertaken tocarry them back to Spain involving ofcourse their release from the siege atthe earliest practicable moment It issignificant that Rios delayed thenation of lioilo until heame informed that thewere coming and there iscuriosity here to learn how thatnt information reached Iloilo inadv the movements of the American transports and in the absence ofcable connections Undoubtedly itwas conveyed by a vessel and theremay be a question raised as to the legitimacy of the transmission of thenews of the intention of the Americantroops in advance in this fashionOne feature of Gen Otis report thatescaped mention so far is his notice A the approaching meeting of theso called Filipino parliament which isto gather presumably at Malalosabout twenty miles from Manila on1 he I vl a Tyi of Luzon TimrMax nest JA good deal of interest is attached tothis meeting as Gen Otis reportsthat by the attendance thestrength of Aguinaldos party canbe gauged That this is waningrapidly is not doubted and Gen Otisfeels that when the attempt is made toconvene the parliament it will befound that Aguinaldo has lost his control of the majority and can not command even a working coalition Sucha state of affairs would tend to makeeasier the task of the military authorsties of the United States of establishing peacefully a temporary form ofgovernment for the Philippines thatwill command the support of the people and receive the approval of the civilized worldAdm Dewey was heard from bycable at the navy department Tuesdaybut made no reference to the politicalsituation in the islands He reportedthat he had found a building suitablelor a naval hospital at Cavite and asked authorit of the department to establish it at once It was not gathered that there is an unusual amount ofsickness among the American sailorsbut realizing that the naval occupation of Manila bay is to be of a permanent character Adm Dewej wishes toestablish a shore hospitalMANILA Jan 3 Advices just received from Iloilo say the rebels at ameeting on Saturday ratified the action of a delegation which assured theAmericans that they might land unarmed but that if the latter landedarmed the natives would be uncontrollableIt is further said that every preparation is being made for resistance uponthe part of the rebels and that reinforcements are arriving from Negrosrd the neighboring islandsIive of the Cri w DrownedLondon Jan 4 Incoming steamersat different ports report that theFrightful weather

they call the Michael AngcloArtists club have obtained a charterelected a president and meet everyevening at the home of one of themembers to study and improve as bestthey may without the help and knowledge of one who has received instruction in the art The beys are mostlyforeigners and come from the Maxveil street district The president isthe eldesi and his is the only namethe boys care to

tivitIt seems likely that the New Yorisportsmen who travel long distancefor their fox hunting will find at aeearly day a more convenient fidd of operations nearer home There aregreat many more foxes in Connecticutat present than Connecticut hunterscan take care of and a few outsiderswill be very cordially received A fewyears ago foxes were practically extinct in this state Under the stimulus of a bounty of two dollars a headthe animals practically dis ppearedand about 20 years ao the bounty wasrepealed Hut there were evidently afew foxes left who took ad vintage ofthe legislative action to rear large familiesIt was rot until about four years agothat they made their presence felt inany unpleasant way At that timebanters began to notice strange tracksupon the snow which bore a suspiciousk semblance to fox trails and an occasional missing chicken from the poultry yards made the farmers prick uptheir ears and by the depredators1 egan to be seen and proved to be veryfine specimens of both red and grayloxes They are very numerous especially in New Haven county hunters and travelers on the road meeting1hem all the time The other day aNew Haven man returning from a cirivef a few hours reported seeing tenfoxes during the morningFox hunting is a sport in which fewNew Haveners of the present generation have indulged Nevertheless theod tmers are beginning to brush uptheir boyhood experiences and are taking a shi or two at Reynard and NewHaven sportsmen have formed a clunfor the express purpose of profitingby the new and rare opportunities thusthrust upon themThere are more reasons than onewhy they are making war on the littlebeasts There are a large number ofgray or wolf foxes a species that hashitherto been unknown in this statewhose presence has caused no end ofspeculation among the sportsmenwhich arc making rapid inroads uponthe quail partridges and other gamef these parts They live nearly allthe time in swampy ground and havea more accurate knowledge of thehaunts of the quail than the most experienced sportsmen in the state Asi matter of fact such game U becoming wonderfully scarce hereabouts acondition of affairs that is attributedto the activity of the gray foxes Ithas really become a question of thesurvival of the birds or of their wilyenemies and Connecticut sportsmendo not hesitate in declaring- that thefox must goThe farmers too are constantly complaining If there is nothing betterin sight the gray foxes do not scrupleo carry away a spare rooster or twoand as a result poultry raising in Connecticut is not so profitable i businessas it was The number of red loxes hasdso increased These live largely inuse neios ano destroy a great manyfield mice and obnoxious grubs andin this way do a large amount of goodUnfortunately thev also do a great dealOf harm They do not bother t he gamebut they are raising havoc with all theducks and chic kens in the stateThere was quite a little huntingthough it is making no noticeable impression upon the pests which aregrowing more numerous every dayThis is probably owing to the difficultyof shooting the nimble beasts Notrouble is found in starting up a foxbut a great deal of difficulty is foundiri bagging the game Circumstancesare not favorable in this state for thediase and it is altogether problematicwhether the foxes started wp by fhehounds are ever killed The huntersare not able to follow the dogs andhave to wait until they make their appearance upon the highway or someconspicuous place in the fields Yearsago of course Connecticut fox huntersfigured out this reappearance to anicety but the sportsmen of the present day have been taken unawares anddo not know so well the tricks of foxesThe gray foxes who live chiefly inihe swamps are not so gamy Theyaever leave their hiding places an 1thus are more easily caught Hut upo the present time the hunters do notsucceed In diminishing their numbersand it seems likely that the state willhave a serious problem on its handsThe people are therefore agitatingthe reimposition of two dollars a headon dead foxes This freed ihe statefrom the pest once and it is believedthat it wll be successful again

message of Gov Smith olVermont to the state legislature dealtlargely with good roads Their presentlaw he asserted is entire v wronir asover SGO00 are annually collected andthen distributed among the towns to bespent by 245 highway commissionerin repairing the roads of their respective towns while not a cent of it goe3into permanent work or furnishes anylasting benefit to the state The moneyis spread out so thin that it is practically thrown awayThe idea of the law was that thesmaller towns would receive from thestate in the annual distribution morethan they had paid as their share of thetax but the increase proves to be toosmall to be of any material benefit Onthe contrary the small towns would receive far greater advantages if the taxwere used toward building permanentroads and they were connected by themwith the railways to which they areobliged to carry their produceStatistics had been prepared by thegovernor to show the coet of transportation of the products of Vermontfrom various touiis which lie awayfrom the ine of the railroads tc therailroads as compared with the cost oftransrnriing the same article from theryifoad to market From these statistics it appears that on butter lumber granite lime brick cement andhay the rate is from 250 to 4 per tonby team from the point of productionto the railroad while the rate to haulthe same articles from the railroadstation to the point of consumption isbut from 340 down to 1 GG per tonIn none of these inst ances does the haulby team exceed 12 miles in none of theinstances is the baul by railroad lessthan

be from 50 to75 per cent so that there is from 125to 3 for every ton of freight teamedto go into the pocket of the producerin Vermont if only good roads are madewhere bad ones now existThe governor therefore urges thatthe Massachusetts highway law modified as required be adopted in Vermontand that the tax of 86000 now annually collected for road repairs be turnedover to state highway

WAISTSTheyAre Modishly Fashioned ofFlannel Silk and Colored VelvetsA fine French flannel is perhaps thesmartest material just now for shirtwaists writes a Xew York fashion correspondent The red and green flannelshirt waists are popular for golf andare worn with a golf cape by womenwho do not care for the little red orgreen jackets Purple flannel waistsare much worn during second mourning and are much more comfortable tolook at and much better in their effQctthan black flannel or black China silkor taffeta Just at present dark red ordark blue or even bright blue flannelwaists are being made with a blackstripe which bars them and gives themthe effect of a plaid These are in verygood taste and bright on cold winter days Corduroy is still used andvelveteen is seen in all combinationsVelveteens in large plaids are verybright and rich looking aud seem moreformal than flannel hence may be evenmore worn to excuse the absence ofthe boned and fitted waist aforesaidwhich is reposing in the wardrobeSince the polka dot craze has becomeBO pronounced one hesitates to mentionthe popularity of the polka dottedvelvet and velveteen shirt waists Ithardly seems possible that they cannotsurvive the oblivion into which polkadotted materials will surely sink ifthey do not stop thrusting themselvesso glaringly upon the retina of the eyethat the sight of them will become unendurable Just now however there isnothing much prettier than these selfsame polka dotted shirt waists inbrown blue and even gray and greenvelveteens The polka dots it is needless to say are whiteSilk shirt waists arc always wornbut to speak of silk shirt waists takesus out of the region of the severelytailor made article into fancy waistswhere tucks and other frivolous andbecoming furbelows begin Most of thesilk shirt waists in fact one might sayall of them are tucked in some manner The very latest tucks are morethan tucksThey are box plaits less than half aninch wide with about the same distancebetween them To make a waist of thissort it is necessary to first box plait thesilk to be used and then cut out thewaist This waist cannot yet be had ineven the s martest shops so it is well tohave one made by a modiste or at homeif one has a very good pattern for thelines are the same as that of the ordinary waist only there is all this elaborate box plaiting to be done before thesilk is cut at allThere is a determined effort to makethe white linen collar less prominentand the tie more obtrusive The consequence is that one sees shirt waistswith a narrow turnover band of whiteshowing about the neck and below thata wide tie going around the neck twicetied with two small bows and wideends which reach nearly to the waistThe ever present polka dot has invadedthe ribbon used for these ties andorange or lemon colored ties with blackpolka dots are to be seen on all sidesThe orange and lemon seem to be aboutthe most popular but there are ties ofevery color with polka dots on themThen there are beautiful striped tiesof gorgeous hued silks which cost apretty penny if one indulges in the luxury of buying them at mens furnishingshops but which can be had for abouta quarter of the asking price if onelooks carefully at the design buys goodsilk and copies it at homeThen there are ties with square formal-lookingends making the butterflybow or the bat wing But whatever ticis worn it is customary to cover thecollar as much as possible Many of thecollars are only narrow turnover bandswhich fasten to the ties before they areput around the neckMany of the ready made shirt waistscome with a collar or stock of the material of which they are male Thisgives an opportunity to wear all sortsof fancy stocks but is not quite asi muchin keeping with a tailor made effect asa narrow band of white about the neckSilk waists invariably have fancystocks and if they do show a whiteband above them it is of the finest hemstitched or embroidered lawn and hasnone of the

FROMSAN QUENTIN PRISONOne of the Host Remarkable Cases ofJail Breaking on Record Accomplishedby a Feat Which Almost Bordered onthe MiraculousIt is one thing to catch a thief and itis another thing to hold him Daring ameeting of the chiefs of police of all thelarger cities of the United States andCanada which occurred at Milwaukeethere were reminiscences of remarkablecaptures and of escapes which borderedclosely upon the miraculousThe most remarkable escape fromprison that I can recall said WilliamA Pinkerton was that of FrankSteadman from the San Quentin prisonBut Ill not tell you about it for hereis John Glass who caught Steadmanand sent him back to San QuentinChief Glass pinched the brown imperial on his under lip reflectively fora moment before he responded to thelooks of inquiry bent upon him by thosenot familiar with the storyThe escape to which you refer Pinkerton was made after I seit Steadmanto San Quentin and not before I wasnot the fortunate one to get him afterthat last wonderful break And to tellthe truth I have never taken to myselfmuch credit for taking him the time Idid for it was to a considerable degreea matter of good fortune You see wewere just at that time keeping our eyesopen for a bank robber by the name ofBarnes who had gone into one of thebanks out there covered the one manwho happened to be alone in the placeat the time locked hiin up in the vaultand then coolly walked out of the bankand out of sight with all the funds hecould get his hands onOne day a man answering closelythe description we had of Barnes stepped off the train at Los Angeles Wetook him in tow at once but foundwe did not have the bird we were afterHowever we managed to hold himlong enough to find out that he wasFrank Steadman who had become notorious even at that time as a successfuljail breaker He had four or five escapesfrom prison in southern Indiana credited to him had got away from Tolietand had still seven years to do at theIllinois prison had also been at SanQuentin and had escaped from therewith five years unfinishedSteadman was a machinist by profession and a burglar by inclinationWhen he was sent back to San Quentinlish his time he was put to workii other convicts in the engine roomlas here that an idea came into hish that for absolute daring and fearless was typical of the man He had2d that every evening at the timeien working in the engine roomlined up to be marched away theInery was stopped at exactly theEatue moruenT He had observed as wellthat a window leading to an adjacentroof was not far from the top of the bigdriving belt of the engine From thatjof it was possible to reach the outerli of the prison Beyond the wallfreedom He had escaped so manyles that his mind i everted again andFain to the window hjgb up on theall of the engine uum Apparently itras beyond all possibility of beingreached No ladder was to be obtainedHad such a thing been even standingin place against the wall to breakfrom the lino and scale it with catlikedexterity although the work of but afew seconds he well knew would befutile possibly fatal Bullets travelfastei than legs and the guards werenot bad shots But desperate deeds demand desperate neans Some mindsmay work with an ingenuity born ofdespair but Steadmans was of a different caliber His plans were the outgrowth of steadfast optimismOne day there came to him as if byinspiration the thought that the big beltmht be the means of carrying him toliw goal He found that it was impossible to count the revolutions of the driving wheel hut there were lacings inthe broad belt which he was able todistinguish as a sort of blur as it passed11 given point For days and days helourrWrt and in his cell at night hepent his time in calculations He discovered the exact number cf revolutionsthe wheel made per minute He learnedalso by eonstant observation just hfiwmany times the belt went round aftertl engine was shut downOne evening when the line hadbeen formed as usual at the close of thedays work and as the big wheel beganto lose its momentum suddenly a convict sprang from the line leaped to thebelt with outstretched arms grapplingboth edges of the broad leather He badcalculated well the strength that wouldbe required for the terrific wrench didnot loosen his grasp Outward and upward he swung until he reached thetopmost point of the circumference Thenicety of his calculation had reaped itsreward The belt stopped He leaped tohis feet sprang through the windowand was gone before convicts or guardshad recovered frcm their astonishmentHe caught up a guards coat and hatdropped from the wall and got away inthe dusk of the evening I am inclinedto believe that as a mathematical proposition that was about as perfect a piecexf work as any man ever accomplishedAnd did be get away without re-ture some one askedLNo I am almost sorry to say be didanswered the Los Angeles chiefr that ought by rights to be the de-mient of such a story which corn-so much of daring and cleverness Im

Attractstbe Outcasts of the French CapitalAfter the Faarfal Knife Has FaMenIn theso rushing times wemight takefor our motto Something New Always Something New ConsequentlyI imagine that the impressions of awoman at the foot of the guillotinewould not be commonplace I was present at die performance in the Place dela Do n tte where M de Paris and hisassistants officiated in the name of socalled justice The horrible spectaclehaunts and racks the mind and tendsrather to re enforce the partisans of theabolition of capital punishment Thehorror of the punishment imposed renders a guilty man almost worthy ofpity The sight of a human beingdragged like a beast to the slaughterhouse up even to the sinister seesawis terribleI know many people may be astonished that anybody could be moved to pityfor the ferocious brute Carrara whotransformed his mushroom establishment into a crematory and had no mercy for the unfortunate young man Lamarra whom he threw into the fireafter having murdered him for the purpose of robbery I know all that and Ido not dispute the fact that the Italianwas a monster but that is no reasonwhy we should not be disgusted at thespectacle which was presented to oureyes and which I will now endeavor todescribe with the impartiality of a simple spectator without resentment orprejudice but with a heart that revoltsagainst a scene that has neither thegrandeur nor the majesty of a punishment inflicted but rather exhibits thecowardice and baseness of a vengeancewhich hides itself from the light of dayThe execution was fixed for 4 oclockin the morning but from the hour ofmidnight the neighborhood of theGrande Roquette was swarming withan undulating and mocking crowdJailbirds murderers footpad and women of the streets assembled there to seeas they said the Italian animal shortenedJournalists were admitted into thenarrow space so often described withits five sinister stones and its legendarygas jet which is never lighted except onthe evening before an executionThere in the rain we watched the setting up of that horrible machine whichaccording to the legend Oagliostroshowed in a glass of clear water to theterrified Marie Antoinette In the yellow and spectral light of the gas jetthat flickered in the wind these preparations were hideous to witness Almost on a level with the ground standsthe scaffold with its two arms in theair brandishing the sparkling knifeAnd I a woman in the presence ofthTO preparations could not help thinking of the family of the wretch whosehead was soon to fall into the basket Ithought of his little children who wereat that moment sleeping soundly somewhere and of his wife equally guiltywith him and who as it were pushedher husband into the arms of the executioner as a last resort to save herselfWhat remorse will be hers when theytell her abruptly Carrara has sufferedhis punishment You are a widowBut the day was dawning and thelamps were going out At the windowsand even on the roofs numbers of spectators were gathered as if to witnesssome carnival The sight was heartrending Mounted gendarmes and soldiers gradually came out of the darkness and one might be inclined to railat such a display of force at tho execution of a wretch paralyzed by fear whoin a few moments would appear uponthe scene tied hand and footThere was some little commotionamong the crowd when people began topoint at a Chin old man who hobbledabout with the gestures of a dancingjack to see if the knife in the brass runners was in good working order Thiswas Dei bier the executioner a ghostwith a white beard who adjusted theinstrument with the indifference of agrocer weighing his goods Suddenlythere was profound silence the rainwas over heads were uncovered andmotionless Breathless and almost inagony the crowd followed with staringeyes the movement of the doors of theprison which at last opened wideA suppressed Ah came from manycontracted chests while with pale facesall gazed upon the assassin whosecrime the mountebanks of tbe fairs popularized He was simply frightful tolook at bowed down as he was withterror He did not look like a humanbeing He looked like a beast His intelligence was already dead and hisheart had lost all feeling The instinctof the animal still remained The sightwas dreadfully sadWhat followed beggars descriptionThe executioner and his aids seemed nolonger to be men employed to carry outtbe ends of justice they looked likebutchers They seized the condemnedman some by the ears some by thelegs while others held down the centerof the body and kept holding him up tothe very moment when with a suddenrumble the knife fell the head rebounded into the basket and the abomination was at an endBut one should be present and seethepavements cohered with blood the
