Thislb tut; ueari-i muling uiy mat tiuugcO'Rear has sent to the Senator, and ithas been answered. The distributor ofKentucky patronage will throw hisstalwart form in the breach, and attempt to stop the tide of public opinionthat has swept O'Rear off his feet andengulfed him. This is part of the bargain made hetween the candidate forGovernor and the Senator, which hadits inception at the Phoenix Hill convention, when Judge O'Rear publiclyaccepted ita debasing terms.It must not be forgotten that beforethe Republican State Convention,Judge O'Rear had denounced the election of a United States Senator fromthis state by the coriupt use of a"jack pot." Among those who heardhim make this statement was Hon.Leslie Combs, Ex-Minister to Peru,and one of the leading Republicans ofthe State. He has publicly declaredover his signature that he and all others with whom he has spoken believedthat O'Rear referred to the election ofBradley, and .they applauded thatvirtuous sentiment. But when O'Rear'snomination hung in the balance, it wasnecessary for him to recover seme ofthe stiength he had lost by his personal attacks during the race before theconvention. Bradley had called him toaccount for repeating the charge thathe had been elected to the Senate bycorrupt means, and would accept Inoother apology save a public tributethat would satisfy his vanity, and appease his wounded honor. It was thenthat O'Rear made his humiliating surrender proclaiming Bradley "thegreatest living Kentuckian," whosetitle to the United States Senate was"without flaw or stain."Bradley will carry out his part ofthe bargain by taking the stump, forthe balance of the Campaign. It isproper that he should be on the firinglire. The manner of his election tothe Senate, and his record in Washington, makes him an issue. Congressman Ben Johnson has chargedthni-Q lBradley was elected to thethrough the manippulations of a ''corrupt lobby," and the expenditure of$65,000. In his Ashland speech theoeuaiur atuieu mat ue wuuiu put, hismark upon any man wno intimatedthat he was not honestly chosen forthe Senate, and that it would be sucha mark that it could not be rubbed outor washed cut. Although Congressman Ben Johnson made this charge ina public speech at Danville severalweeks age, Senator Bradley up to thisgood ftcur has not put his mark uponhim, nor has he dared to make a'reply.Bradley not only accepted a seat inthe Senate at the hands of J,he mostvicious and L unscrupulous lobby thatwas ever organized at Frankfort, butafter his election he remained at thecapitol for weeks, and was in theState Senate day by day, while effortswere being made to (pass the CountyUnit Bill, and yet he never raised hisvoice in its behalf.It is due the temperance people oft-.e State thai Senator Bradley shouldexplain to them why the pledges ofthe Republican platform which advocated the extension of the CountyUnit were not kept. He knows whytney were broken. He is closer to theliquor interest than any other man inpublic life in Kentucky. They followed his advice in the campaign fourytarsa go ; they have had the benefitof his friendship at Washington, andthey have confidence in his judgmentand in his sincerity. It will be embar-rassnhg for Judge O'Rear for .Bradleyto make a lull confession of bis alliance with the looby that secured his.election to the Senate, 'but the trathhazards, andshould prevail at allJudge O'Rear should join the Democrats in their demand that Bradley liftthe lid from this seething caldron ofscandal.a It is right that Bradley should enterthe campaign for many reasons.When he appeals to the farmers ofKentucky for their support he shouldtell them why he voted against thebill putting farming implements oni.h frea list- when Tip wpp ithLu .u : u. i.i-.lUClit UVCl IMC11 UlISXUITLUUUS, I1C HI1UU1Uexplainwby he voted against the tariffj 'u-j r--vC i ii.

Opportunity willbe given him to explain his defense ofthe trusts, and his support of everybill that came before the Senate thatwould increase the power of 'corporatemonopoly.No doubt Senator Bradley, likeJudge O'Rear would be glad to con6nehis discussions to State issues, bjt hisrecord is a living question, and hemust stand or fall by it.If the people of the State want ''another Senator like Bradley, committedto a protective tariff, and in favor ofall the policies that have made the Republican party an infamous in thenation, they will vote under the logcabin, because they will thereby helpto elect a Legislature that will defeatOllie James, and send CongressmanLangley or Conrgessman Powers tothe Senate in his stead.We welcome Senator Bradley backto the stump.

HESTERVESSEL WILL GROSS DESERTSteamboat Will Navigate CanyonColorado River Built for Useof Mining Company.ofSan Francisco. -One of the strangestprojects of navigation ever known isto be put under way with the completion of a steamboat that is now being constructed at a local shipyard.The craft is first to cross the desertand then is to be launched ou the Colorado river and navigate part of itsdeep canyons. She will be 70 feetlong, of 83 tons, and will be driven bystern wheel.She is being built for the use of amining company which has been conducting some large operations in taking gold from the bed of the Coloradocanyon at Lees Ferry, Ariz. This iathe only crossing on the river for hundreds of miles, because the streamruns through great sand cliffs whichstart well up in Utah, and a few milesbelow the ferry it dips into the Marble canyon, which then leads intothe Grand canyon, and the water goesthrough the Buckskin mountains farbelow their summit.Although the river throughout mostof its course is wild with rapids andfalls, there is a long stretch in the vicinity of the ferry house where it runssmoothly, and the curren is not toostrong. It is for the purpose of takingworkers and supplies up and downstream in the gold operations and forcarrying coal from a deposit that hasbeen found in the Marble canyon thatthe vessel is being built. She willhave a speed of ten miles an hour,enough to overcome the current, andwill enable the gold hunters to reachplaces now inaccessible.The boat will be built as any other,and after she is completed she will betaken apart, put on a train, and takento Flagstaff, Ariz. From this pointshe must be taken over a sandy wastefor 200 miles by wagon. At LeesFerry a crew of men from the shipyards will put her together again andlaunch her. The operation will be costly, but the miners expect to pay forthe steamboat soon with the wider operations and make her a fine investment. Persons who have been at the ferrywill await with interest the attitudethe Navajo Indians will, take whenthey first behold the monster of thewater as they cross the river for theirtrading with the Piutes. Nothing thewhites have brought to their attentionso far has shaken their stoic calm,but this revelation may do so.BASEBALL ALIBI FREES MANChicago Municipal Judge AcceptsPrisoner's Story of Game and Dismisses Charge of Theft.Chicago.

For terms writeto The Enquirer, Cincinnati, Ohio,IN THE TAILOR-MADESSMART COSTUMES THAT DESERVETHEIR POPULARITY.One Point In Absolute Demand, andThat Is That Accessories ShallMatch Good Idea Shown In. - the Illustration.The tailor made girl is a distincti species in dress, and no matter what! frivolities come into vogue for streetwear, there she is always In the neatjest of rigs, with every accessory; matching, and looking far more dash.ing than her befrilled, befeathered sis,ter. ( For quite young girls there are somevery smart short coats in plain clothwhich mothers often buy for wear with'a striped or checked skirt in the same'color. Again the suit will be madeup in this manner with a bit of theskirt goods used for,an under collar andcuffs of the coat, and if the girl is ofthe type that needs more dressinessthan the plain one-material styles allow this combination is very acceptable. Such a get-up is given for a girl.of 16 in the illustration, plain blue'cloth and a pretty wool in two shadesof blue being used. An entire suit ofblue serge would be very good andpractical in this model, whose collarpermits, if liked, the stylish finish atthe back.The draped turban the girl wears isa suitable headpiece for the suit andit follows one of the fads of the moment in using a bit of the skirt stufffor a side trimming.What doesn't the world use nowadays for trimming? Almost everythingis seen, and with a little taste and fin-ger cleverness anybody can copysome of the most distinctive Frenchgarnitures. For example, a stunningblack wool dress seen recently showed a collar of white cloth treated toa mysterious edge which turned outto be no more than coarse black woolcrocheted on. The edge was directlyworked on the cloth a little latticedesign and below this a single rowof bright green wool, caught downwith black, was a lovely finish.Aside from the importance of thehat, nothing smartens up a stylishtailored get-up like a handbag of harmonious and distinctive sort, and herelies the greatest opportunity for hometaste and dainty work, for the bagsare made of every conceivable textureand the more home-made they look themore charming they seem. Some neatlittle envelope shapes, not very big,but with cord and tassel of silk, are90 cents. These are in suede and dressed leather, and they look quite elegant with the simpler suits. Heavygloves and a. good umbrella kept neatly folded when not in use in its snugcase are other requirements for thetailored rig, and one of the stunningcolors of the day for both of these isthe smoky gray already discussed.The approved "gloves are of buckskinand of English make, holding the handrather loosely, and, in gray3 and richyellows.cALbf PUslffLa?xyHygienic Bathroom.

There aredistricts of many square miles ownedand operated by one person. The rubber trees are scattered more or lessplentifully among other trees thaiyield no profit as yet.When one has secured a large, tractof forest land for the industry he putsup a rough shelter upon it and engages Indian natives of the neighborhood to aid him in the work. Early inthe morning they, start out to makethe rounds of the estate, for they mustget back to the riverside before theheat of the day becomes too great.They tap the trees, attach little tincups to catch the sap and take homewhatever sap may be collected.The sap of the rubber tree is a whiteliquid of the consistency of goat's milk.It is necessary that it be convertedinto a solid. This is effected by theaction of a pungent smoke that coagulates or curdles the milky fluid. Forthis use the seeds of two differentkinds of palm are employed. The seedsare put in an earthen jar which has anarrow neck, the bottom of which isperforated with a number of squareholes. In this the palm , nuts areburned. The holes in the bottom of thejar admit a draft and cause a densesmoke to issue from the neck.The operator takes a paddle similarto that with which he paddles his canoe and holds the blade of it over thejar. Upon it li3 po;;rs the milky juice.cup by cup. all the time iiiniincr the'blade eo as to brine: ril parts of it intothe smo'ce. Xhe fluid ii instantly fixedand adheres to the wood or to the rubber alreadv formed. This process iscontinued until a solid lump is founied jthat will perhaps weigh sixteenpounds. "When the lump has grownlarce enough for handling a 'slit is cutin it and the blade is drawn out. Amass of rubber is left ready for exportation. It is the smoke used in 'coagulating the sap that gives cruderubber the dark appearance familiar toevery one.Natives who collect rubber have, cu- jriously enough, little use for the article. -They do, however, devise playthings for their children by pouringthe sap into clay molds of birds, fishes,etc., and then crushing the clay andremoving it.

It isan ocean of sand, with billows of landexcept in spots where there are oases.On the route we fell in with an Arabwanderer named Mohammed. Not allorientals are named Mohammed, but alarge number are. He said he was atrader, but one of my men said thatthe way he traded, was one sided. Hegave nothing unless bullets for something. In other words, he was a robber. But, like most of these people, hewas very smooth spoken. He pretended to take a great fancy to me; saidthat he had heard that America wasthe greatest country in the world, andhe was quite sure I was the greatestAmerican. To prove his admiration forand confidence in me, he invited meto his camp and introduced me to hiswives. There was one young andquite pretty (for an Arab) womanamong them who, it seemed to me,was especially cordial to me. I couldonly judge by the looks she gave me,for she did not know my language norI hers. Salam, my chief man, remarked to me that he had noticed, the woman's preference for me. But, havingno desire to get myself murdered onaccount of an Arab's wife, I did notpropose to encourage the lady.Mohammed journeyed beside us forseveral days, camping when we camped and moving when we moved. Hadit not been for Salam I would haveconsidered that the man had conceiveda great regard for me, so naturally didae feign it Salam said that he wasfamiliarizing himself with our strength,our arms and the value of the loot tobe acquired in case of a successful attack. Salam also ventured the opinionthat the wife who was so favorablydisposed toward me was probably intending, by her husband's order, to lureme into some position by which Icould be put out of the way. Then mybelongings would easily fall into Mohammed's hands. This view of thecase did not favor the conceit of aman of twenty-two, and I did not believe him.One evening my Bedouin admirercame to my camp to announce thefact that the next morning at dawn hewould separate from us, going off tothe east toward Marzuk, my intentionbeing to proceed on my way to Ghat.He invited me to sup with him. Beingyoung as I have said before I had afancy to see once more the womanwho had apparently conceived a regard for me. I desired to form anopinion as to whether Salam or I wasright as to the genuineness of herdemonstrations. I supped with herhusband, but he kept his wives out ofthe way. This seemed to me to provethat there was nothing .in Salam'stheory. The trader feasted me royallyand when I left embraced me withtears in his eyes."Whoever says," I remarked to Salam when I returned to my camp, "thatan Arab is incapable of friendshipdoesn't know your race."Salam made 'no reply, but did notseem especially impressed with my appreciation of the guileless natures ofhis brother Bedouins.Two days after this we encampedone evening on the desert. It was alonely spot, though no more lonelythan all other spots on the Sahara. Iwas standing after dark admiring thebright stars above, contrasting withthe monotonous scene below, when Iheard the faintest kind of a soundwithin a few feet of me. It was likea spent buljet hitting soft earth. Turning, I saw an object a few feet fromme. Going to it. I found an arrowsticking in the sand. Taking it up, Idiscovered a bit of wood tied to it.Taking it into my tent, where I had alight, I saw Arabic writing on oneside. I called Salam and asked himto interpret it. He read it to himselfand looked up at me with fear in hisface."What is it?" I asked."It says, 'Make the fonduk.' "The fonduk is a caravansary wherecaravans may get food, water and.what is often more desirable, safety."From whom did it come?" I asked."There is no one near us.""Mohammed is near. I suspect thathe intends to fall upon us tonight. Hewill probably kill you, then give therest of us baksheesh to keep silent.""But who could have sent this warning?" "I think I have been wrong. Tbpwoman who saw you has really beencaptivated. It is she."I told Salam to break camp, load thecamels, and we would proceed on ourjourney.While the preparations were beingmade I went out again to be alonewith the sky and the desert. A newfeeling had entered my- breast. Forthe first time in my life I was conscious that a woman loved me. But Iknew at the same time that our pathswould be as wide apart as those of the:jreat desertbefore day dawned we made the:onduk. ,How MabCameI"There are some funny folks in this jworld," said Miss Black, the seamstress. "N6w, for instance, I'll tellyou about a girl I know."She came from the same town thatme and my sister came from, but herfolks are kind of funny and we wasn'treally well acquainted with 'em. Butyou know how it is in the city. Folksthat you knew back home well, youfeel so much better acquainted with'em than maybe you really are, don'tyou?"Well, anyway, me and sister, wehad a flat together, and we was fixedreal comfortable. You see, we gotour meals atliome sometimes or took'em out, just as we had a mind to,and sometimes, we'd be invited out toeat, and that would save the price ofa meal now and then; though me andsister, we was brought up to be realcareful how we imposed on fellerabout goin to cat with 'em too oftenYou know how it is. Folks ask youso cordial sometimes to come anytime, and then just's like's not if yougo they'll talk behind your back abouthow willin' you are to come to theirhouse and be entertained and youdon't never seem to think it's necessary to ever invite other folks to yourhouse and all that kind of talk. Sotake it all in all, it's just about asaheap to pay for your own meals."But everybody don't feel like tha.and that's how I come to think otellin you about this Mabel that sisterand me used to know back home."You see, one day sister and me wewas takin' a little trip across the lakeand we fixed up quite a lot of lunch,meanin for it to do us for dinner andsupper, too. We just had some sandwiches and pickles and cake and fruitand things like that, because we ain'teither of us what you could call realheavy eaters. Well, me and sistertook our lunch up to the front of theboat about noon and begun to spreadout our things, and just as we wasabout to begin to eat our sandwicheswho should come up, squealin' likeshe she was just about tickled todeath to see us, but this Mabel thatwe used to know back home?"Well, we hadn't even seen her fora couple of years, but you'd 'a' thoughtwe was the best friends that ever wasfrom the way she carried on. Therewas a young fellow hanging over th"rail of the boat and pretty soon shecalls to him to come and get introduced to us. They was intendng tobuy their dinner on the boat, theysaid, bu, of course, nobody with anymanners could help askin' 'em tohave a sandwich, so sister and measked 'em, and if they didn't sit downand eat up half our lunch, so we didn'tknow whether there'd be enough leftfor our supper or not!"Well, anyway, they stuck aroundwith us all afternoon and they wasright good company, too, I'll say thatfor 'em. When suppertime came theyjust helped themselves like they'dbeen asked to stay. Well, when wegot off the boat it had begun to rainand Mabel says, 'Girls,' she says,'would you mind if I went home withyou and stayed all night -so's Fredwon't have to go home with me?'"Well, what could a person do, I'dlike to know? Of course, we had totell her to come right along and we'dbe pleased to have her and all that."Well, the next day Mabel said shedidn't feel well enough to go to workand would sister or me please phoneher boss and tell him she wasn't goin'to come down? So she -stayed in bedthat day, and the next day she stayedin bed most of the time, and the upshot of it was that she stayed withus all that week, and every day she'dask sister or me to go over to herboarding house and get first one thingand then another, and at the end ofthe week she just up and asked us ifwe couldn't let her board with us."Well, now, me and sister hadn'tany more idea of taking a boarderthan anything on earth, but it seemedlike there wasn't any real good reasonwhy we shouldn't, and, anyway, Idon't believe she's 'a' went if we'dtold her she couldn't stay, so she kep'right on stayin'."Well, anyway, the first of the summer me and sister made up our mindsthat we'd get rid of her some way orother, but we couldn't neither of usseem to make up our minds to comeright out flat and tell her Nwe didn'twant her, so we just planned to takeour vacations at the same time andgo home and tell her we was goin' toshut up the. flat and then maybe she'dunderstand that we wanted her to getanother place. Well, that girl wasjust determined she'd stay, in that fiat." It wouldn't look right, Mabel,' sister and me says to her, 'for a younggirl like you to stay here alone andyt6ur beau comin' and like that. Yourma wouldn't like it a bit.'"Well, Mabel was some mad, I guess,but she was just as set to stay asever, so finally sister and me had tofind her a boarding place and justabout turn her out of the house. Sister looked so relieved when she sawher trunk goin' down to the wagon.'My!' she says. 'Ain't I glad to getrid of her?'
