interview with the Evening Post TuesdayAdm Dewey who arrived at New YorkTuesday in reg ard to the Philippinesamong other things saidI thought that this thing in thePhilippines would be over long beforethis as it should have been I cantimagine how they have stood out until now Of course there was a rainyseason and I suppose little was doneOne great trouble out there has beenthat G n Otis has tried to do too muchI told him so He wants to be generalgovernor judge and everything elseto have hold of all the irons No mancan do this This is the great troubleIt is enough for a man to do one thingto be one thing but when a man triesto do everything and be everything itis easy to imagine the resultThe fight in the Philippines shouldbe easily ended The people had beenso bady treated for such a length oftime by the Spaniards that they aredistrustful This is the great difficultyin dealing with them Where we havemet them and they have been in suchcontact with us as to learn that wemean to treat them well where theyhave seen that we mean what we saythere is no trouble They stand by usall the time All of them will learnthis in time They will get from under the influence of Aguinaldo orrather those people who are behindAguinaldo who as I said before is amere toolDo I think the Filipinos are fit forself government Well no not justnow They probably will be in a little time They are a very queer people a very queer mixture many ofthem are quite civilized and good people but I do not think they are fit forself government just yet But when Isay that I must add at the same timethat it is my candid opinion that theyare more fitted for it than the Cubansthat they are a better people than theCubans in every way I do wish however that the whole business was settled and I think that after a little theFilipinos will take kindly to usIt was suggested to the admiral thatthe democratic slate had been settledwith Adm Dewey for the presidencyand Gen Wheeler for the vice presidencyWell said the admiral we shouldmake a pretty mess of it GenWheeler of course has had wmetraining in the political school butthen he is a West Pointer I had forgotten that He would want to runeverything as he would a regimentand of course would make a splendidmess of it You can not run a government as you would a regimentWell admiral suggested the reporter it would not be such a changefrom the ship Oiympia to the ship ofstateYes said the admiral it wouldbe a very great change I am not apolitician I am a sailor my traininghas been ail that way I am at homeon board my ship I know my business or at least should know it and Ido not want to mix up in the affairs ofgovernment I am perfectly satisfiedto live and die a simple sailor whotried to do his duty I am not a politician I can not make a speech evenI wish I could but I have to be content with my lotSome one said just then to the admiral that his son was reported to havemade the statement to the effect thathis father was a dyed-in-the-wool republicanThe admiral laughed outright andturning arounl pointed to a piece ofwood laying on the deck some yardsaway at the same time saying Myson knows as much about what mypolitics

international conference at The Hague has returned to hisluties in the war department CaptCrozier talks entertainingly of theproceedings of the conference andis well pleased with what was accomplished He says that it was knownas soon as the conference assembledthat there could be nothing done regarding the decrease of armies andthe cessation of invention and progress in the matter of offensive anddefensive warfare but the subject wasconsidered and given attention thoughnothing approaching an agreementwas ever reachedTo Uapt Crozier the most importantand interesting feature of the conference which was agreed upon is thetreaty for an international code of civilized warfare The basis of the codewa 5 the celebrated order No 100 issuedin 1SG3 by the United States duringthe civil war in which a code for thetreatment of prisoners non combatants spies women church and property was providedThe most serious point of differencein this matter was the treatment olthose citizens in an invaded countrywho without officers organization oruniform fought in defense of theirhomes and country The smaller nations of the continent and Englandespecially contended for the right ofsuch persons to treatment as legitimate sodiers of the nation to whicithey belonged On the other handthe strong military governments maintained that only soldiers in uniformproperly officered and armed shouldreceive treatment of soldiersand all others be subject to be shot asguerillas without quarter It wasfinally decided that men in an invadedcountry should be considered as soldiers if they complied with these provisions Were organized under a responsible officer carried guns openlywore some distinctive badge or emblem and observed the laws and customs of war These regulations arenot required in case of sudden invasion so that they ean not be compliedwith provided the combatants observed the laws and customs of warTne protection of non combatants ofwomen and children and of property isprovided for The treatment of anddefinition of spies is one of the articles Works of artare no longer considered spoils of war and are not to becarried away or destroyed The destruction of public buildings and otherpublic property is not allowed unlessit is absolutely necessary for militarypurposes Private property is not tobe seized and held except in casesof necessity and is not to betaken unless absolutely neededchurch property is to be respected and the rules of the Red Crossnow used on land are extendedto maritime warfare While nearly allthe delegates agreed that there shouldbe more humaneness in warfare therewere disagreements at times whichmade the subject difficult to adjustHowever an earnest desire to reachan agreement finally prevailed withthe result that a treaty was drawnwhich received the support of all therepresentatives of the nations presentThe action of the United States in taking the lead in the matter of humaneness in warfare back in 1S63 wasfavorably

there has been nocessation in the warfare being wagedagainst the Indians by the Mexican government He reports thatthe Indians have scattered intosmall bands and are now vigorouslywaging a guerilla warfare and thatthe Mexican soldiers have adoptedsimilar tactics and are also divided intosmall scouting parties and that thereare frequent engagements betweenthe soldiers and the Indians The Indians avoid open engagements withthe soldiers rather harrassing themwith attacks from secure positions inthe mountains and along the roughmountain roads not infrequently causing much loss of life among the soldiers with little harm to themselvesGen Torres in command of the Mexican troops asks the Mexican war department to send a force of ruraies toassist him as it is thought they canrender very

Perpetuated in Filtbr RKlonof ChinaITo many people the reports a fewyears ago of the appearance of theplague in China and later in Indiacame with a shock of surprise Theplague was a disease associated in theirminds with antiquity or the middle agesand was thought to be one of the extincticourges of man as safely buried as anyc f its victimsIn reality however it has never diedjut Although it retired from Europedriven before the slowly improvingcleanliness of modern civilization it hasoeen preserved through all these yearsin some of the almost inaccessible andIndescribably filthy regions of westernChina and the neighboring countriesof central Asia It exists also in certainparts of central Africa and a small epidemic prevailed in Astrakhan in Russia only about 20 years agoSince 1S94 we have heard constantlyof the plague in the seaport towns ofChina and in India chiefly in Bombayand now it has reached Mecca and hasbeen brought thence to the shores ofthe Mediterranean by returning Mohammedan pilgrimsThe plague is a mierobic disease Itthrives in filth and in the generally- unsanitary conditions associated with thecrowding together of human beings insmall and dark habitations Ratssufferfrom it and are believed to be instrumental in its spread Fleas are alsocharged with transporting the virusfrom the sick to the wellIt is called the bubonic plague because of the swelling of glands in thegroin or armpits which is one of itschief and most constant symptomsThe disease begins like all fevers withheadache loss of appetite nausea indefinite pains in the muscles and boneslassitude a chilly sensation and soforth but the sign which enables thesufferer to foretell his fate with almostabsolute certainty is tenderness onpressure under the arms and in thegroin the forerunner of glandularswellingThere is little to do for one who hasthe disease but much can be done toprevent it It cannot thrive in sunlightand cleanliness and an extensive epidemic could not prevail in any citywhere modern sanitary regulations areenforcedThe pneumonic plague from whichseveral persons died in Vienna lastyear is a form of the plague which attacks the lungs chiefly the symptomsbeing in many respects very similar tothose of ordinary pneumonia Thisform is exceedingly fatal almost everycase ending in death Of sufferers fromthe bubonic plague about eight out often die

trees ororecipices took to burrowing in the2arth they would be considered to bemaking an intelligent effort at selfpreservation But the burrowing birdsare mainly species remarkable for theirpower of flight and could choose anysite they preferred to nest on Eventhe puffins can fly away to the Medderranean every year and the kingfisher and sheldrake are both remarkable the one for the velocity tne otherfor the sustained power oilts travelthrough the air Sand martins thesmallest of our swallows and thestormy petrels the tiniest of webfooted birds both choose to toil atmining the earth for a

except at nesting time of any element but air and sea burrow in tkaearth by choice when the single egg isto be laid It is not even a successfuldevice The capped petrel now believed to be extinct va killed off inits only breeding places the islands ofGuadaloupe and Dominica largely because it did burrow and so was easilycaught both by men and small carnivorous animals Yet the zeal with whichsuch tiny birds as the petrels or sandmartins work at their tunnels showsthat they believe them to be a necessityfor success in lifeEarly last spring a freshly arrivedparty of sand martins reachta themouth of the river Otter in Devonshire almost at the beginning ol Apriland at once selected a bank just over thestream for an experiment in burrowingThe little birds were almost as tameas bees possibly they

instructionsat any point he should tix To my surprisehe did not regard the matter in so seriousa lisht saying that a small fine would nodoubt settle the matter My dear cavaliere he said our lord does not desirethe death of a sinner but only his purseMake your mind easy but keep a tighterLand on your menI shall assuredly do so your eminenceAoothei tiling I think you will haveto put aside your shyness and attend meto the Vatican for the next few days Itis extraordinary how suspieious the courthere is Ihey keep a constant watch onme and on all the suite and your seclusion and solitary rides out have been thesubject of remark The ladies too are 1 k iginterest in you In tact I have been specially asked to bring you with me by Madonna Linvia all owing to a fooiish remark made by Strigonia1 am at your eminences ordersIt is a little risk but I do not want themto think that you are anything but a mereMember of ni suite If there were thelightest wsptcion all my plans would beupset ind the

eminenceCiel 1 should not have thought hewould have been one for your purpose Butthat is your affair and he began toUugh1 have seven good swords behind royour eminence The ehevaier may or maynot do well but 1 could hardly refuse hisrequestDAmboise made no answer anil cur interview came to a close I would howeveradd here that nothing ever came of theburning of the inn No complaint was everlaid as far as 1 could find out and the mattor might have been an everyday occurrence so liltie attention did it excite Iof course did not know that affairs hadreached to such a pitch of disorder in Homeand lived in hourly expectation notwithstanding the cardinals speech of havingconsiderable worry over the revengeful zealof rlacopo I took care that no such thingwas likely to occur again and Master Jacopo wis penitent swearing he would nevergive me further cause for annoyance Atthe levee that morning St Armande wask usual beside me and 1 whispered to himto hold himself in readiness as the timeJ01 our business was at handI am glad of that he answered hisface lighting upI attend the cardinal to day to the Vatican I said by way of continuing the conversationThere will be much going on this evening he made reply The Florentine enoy has been here for the past two daysand the affair at the Vatican to night is inhis honor Do you know that you haveexcited great curiosity in the hearts of thecourt ladiesIndeed It is not my wayIs it not Well Lucrezia expressed aparticular desire to see youI trust it may not lead to the Tiberchevalier The attentions of the Lady Lucrezia are a trifle dangerousHis face became very graveMe civil to her nothing more be whispered You are quite right Oh how Ihate that place and he shivered a littleWell we will soon be out of itPlease CiodTheie was no one at the high table atdinner that day both the cardinal and Mayan having gone to dine with Sforza at theStorza Cesarmi quite an informal businessand none of the suite accompanied themThe conversation at our table turnedmuch on affairs and as there were for onceno guests speech was very freellui will cover our touguessaid Le Llerc and to day we may let themvagThen how long is this truce to lastasked De Driconnet the captain of thecardinals guard I am sick of this idleness here he addedAs for that no man knows whether it ispeace or war replied LeClerc Tremouilleis dialing at Passignano swearing that thegame was ours it we bad only let him marchon utlar rosSombrone and he was rightNow I esare has stamped out the Magioneleague and the Borgia are as strong aseverHow came such a man as Roderigo Borgia ever to be made pope I askedle Cleie laughed as be passed on theUrvieioWhen our lord the sainted Innocentwas ailed awav there were three favorites 1in the conclave One was Giuliano dellailuvcn the other Ascanio Sforza and thethird Model igo Morgia His eminence ofand the elecbl a baies was our mantion would have been certain had not Borgia and Ascanio joined handsand

isas strong as he was thirty years ago Andthere are few men who can sit a horseas he can even nowThat is true I remarked and gave thestcry of my meeting with the Borgia onthe day of my arrival in RomeShortly after this our dinner wherespeech had been so free broke up and finding out the hour at which the cardinalwould require my attendance I took mybook on falconry and repaired to the garden intending to pass the afternoon in itsperusal I made for the Lemon walk andfound a companion in Mran who was wandering there in a disconsolate manner evidently missing his master 1 sat myselfdown on a sheltered seat Mran stretchingout his length at my feet his muzzle resting between liis paws and so we remainedin quiet the dog absolutely motionless and1 engaged in my bookIn this manner I passed my time until mylackey called me in order to be ready toaccompany the cardinal to the VaticanAfter dressing I descended the stairs andmounting Castor placed myself at the headof my men and joined De Briconnet at thegrand entrance of the palace The captainof the cardinals guard had his full forceof 30 swords out it being a receptionnight of some importance and with greatcourtesy allowed me to place Jacopo andmy six men in front of his troop drawinghis own horse alongside of mine and discussing with much cunning of falconry inwhich he was more than an adeptWe bad to wait some little time for thecardinal but at length he came accompanied as usual by Bayard and with himall the gentlemen of his suite includingSt Armande On reaching the foot of thestairs DAmboise inquired somewhat sharply for me but changed his tone to one ofpleasant greeting when he saw I was inwaitingSt Dennis he exclaimed I thoughtyou wore not coming after allWe mid but a few yards to ride and ourpassage along the Via Alcssandrina to thelortone Mronse took but a few minutesAs we rode up there we kept the obeliskin the center of the Piazza di S Pietro toour left and saw before us the walls of thenew cathedral of St Peter then aboutfour or five feet high the ruins of the oldchurch still standing around it At thetune I speak of nothing had been donefor about o0 years towards advancing thework begun by Nicholas V and the greatdesign afterwards altered and put into execution by Giuliano della Rorere when hebecame pope as Julius II was then in askeleton form looking more like I he remains of some sacred shrine than the beginning of a new work the 50 years ofneglect having the eflect of making he newwork almost as ruinous as the old churchfounded by ConstantineAlthough as 1 have mentioned therewere to be great doings at the Vatican thatevening there was no crowd assembled inthe Piazra of St Peter It was full ofsoldiers but the people of Home whomight have been epreted to be there innumbers to see the procession of noblesand their followers were conspicuous bytheir absence Mc farms there werein store jostling crowd of the commonsfor a terror was on Kome and men kept asfar as possible from the Morgo The piazzawas however brilliantly lit up aiid thebodyguards of the various notables werestrictly confined to the places assigned tothem order being maintained by about athousand men of the Spanish guards of thepope under the immediate command of DeLeyva The light from the lamps was reflected back by the glittering arms of themen and the various ensigns of the greathouses were distinctly visible The singlecolumn of Colonna rose side by side withthe eagle and griffin of Morghese the sixlilies of Farnese trembled in the wind nearCollconis two headed lion and a little inthe background was drawn up a solid-lookingbody of cavalry over whom liuttered thestandard of the Morgia these were Cesaresown lambs as he called them veterans ofmany a hard fought fieldAt the entrance steps we halted andwere met by two chamberlains who withtheir stalls of office in their hands usheredus to the bronze gates by which we wereto enter the Vatican We passed throughamidst a blare of trumpets each side ofthe passage being lined with pikemenstanding stiff and motionless as statuesOur way led to the Torre Morgia the portion of the Vatican occupied by Alexanderand the distant strains of music caught ourears as we went on and shortly enteredthe noble reception rooms which werecrowded with peopleThe pope himself stood at the extremeend of the apartment surrounded by a brilliant group of ladies and gentlemen andas we came up to make our duty I had goodOpportunity of observing him Alexanderwas fully 70 years of age but so halehearty and strong looking that he mighteasily have passed for a man of middle ageHe was dressed as a private gentleman inSpanish costume with high boots a jeweled dagger at his side and a smart velvetcapon his head Mut the face itself struck meas remarkable to a degree He was cleanshaven so that all the features were clearlydiscernible the heavy sensual chin thewide cruel mouth surmounted by a nosealmost Jewish in its curve the retreatingforehead bulging over the eyes and theeyes themselves in which there seemed tobarn the fires of insatiable appetite and passion without end all these combined together to make up a countenance which wasa fitting mask for the evil soul within Imade my obeisance with all the othersstifling with difficulty a sudden desire tofling aside the hand 1 touched and walkout of the roomI moved slightly aside and watched thevarious groups as they wandered to andfro or stood together conversing and thehum of voices the gay strain of music andthe brilliant dresses made up together ascene well worth the looking atThe Florentine ambassador was talkingto the cardinal of Santa Susanna a fewfeet from me I caught the tones of hisvoice and as he turned round our eyes metMaehiavelli for it was he glanced at meas at a perfect stranger and then slightlyadjusting his purple lined robe moved slowly onwards with his companionWe mount yet higher signore excelsiorThe words wore breathed rather thanwhispered into my ear and Corte stood beside incExceisior 1 repeated with a smilebut are you not putting your head in thelions mouthHe smiled back upon me more of a snarlthan a smile 1 he heast is gorged nowHe will not think ot me sec there s someone coining your way adieuHe turned and passed into the groupsand St Armande touched my armYou are to he presented to the LadyLucrezia he said and the next momentI found imseit howing over the hand orone of thcmot beautiful and certainly themost infamous woman ot her age She wasbarely 23 tiad already wedded threetutshnnd and was to become a wifescain and marry Alfonso of larrara KhnnMs Niited in a low lounge and as 1 camehbe extended bet band to me with aj charming smile Standing before her looking at her large limpid eyes at the smallred bew of the lips and the clear cut features set in a mass of red gold hair 1 couldnot imagine that the stories I had heardwere true It could not be that this fairyoung woman who stood before me hadsmilingly committed crimes of nameless horror i would not believe itSo cavahere you have come to the courtat last 1 thought you were never goingto do us that honorHis eminence of Strigonia said you meantto take the vows and a lady who wasleaning over Lucrezias seat laughed as sheput in these words I recognized the peculiar unmusical laugh I had heard at thegate of St Paul and glanced at her withsome interestMy sister-in-law Giulia Farnese GiubaBella is it not and Lucrezia touched herlightly on the armOh yes Giulia Bella and aro you really going to become a hermitI might have had such thoughts until1 came here I said but I must now putthem asideNeatly turned cavaliere St Armandehimself cculd not have put it better sithere chevalier and Lucrezia nfcde roomfor St Armande on her loungeAt this moment a commotion at the entrance

her brother whomoved slowly up the room men fallingaway from each side of him and greetingno one He kept himself covered and below his square velvet cap I saw a resoluteface the mouth and chin covered by amustache and short beard not so hiddenhowever but that one could distinctly seeagainst the dark hair on his face the fullred line of the lips set in a habitual sneerBad as the whole brood of the Morgia werethis was the worst of them all He was asfar beyond them in infamy as they werebeyond the rest of mankind in evil doingThe very room was hushed into silence ashe entered and I watched with more interest than 1 can tell the stately figure ofthis wicked man as he went up to meet hisonly less wicked father It was their firstmeeting since the murder of Pierrot andAlexander who stood in dread of his son1 began to tremble violently as he approached looking this way and that as ifhe would avoid him At last they came together face to face Cesare speaking no wordbut lifting his cap with a low bow Alexan ler almost made a motion as if he waswringing his hands but recovered himselfwith an effort and kissed his son on thecheek8 1 do the devils kiss Lucrezia spokethese words under her

right the stranglerHush fool and Giulia Mella laid herhand on her friends shoulder See theycome this way be coolIn fact Cesare had turned from his father without either of them exchanginga word and was coming directly toward-us On the way he passed a group consisting of DAmboise Bayard and the cardinalof Strigonia Yalentinois stopped and inhis speechless way held out his hand toBayard who merely bowed stifily Cesaresdark face whitened with rage and dropping his hand to his side he walked straighton and 1 could see that DAmboise wasexpostulating with Bayard and Strigoniaopenly laughing This insult however hadnet added to Cesares good temper in facthe came up to us angry as a man could beand after greeting his sister coldly turnedto St Armande and looked at hiin in silenceIt is usual signore said Don Michelotto to the chevalier to stand in the presence of a princeI was not aware that you were a princesir replied St Armande entirely ignoringthe MorgiaYou can give this young gentleman alesson in manners at your leisur saidCesare My your leave sir and givinghis hand to his sister who took it passivelyhe led her to another apartment followedby Giuiia Bella who tapped a good by on StArmandes arm with her closed fanOur group now consisted of Michelottoand myself standing and St Armande stillsitting comfortably in the lounge evidently examining the contour of his small andshapely foot As for me although I knewSt Armande to be grossly in the wrong 1was delighted with the sudden spirit hehad shown The youngster had heart afterall aud there was the making of a manin himMichelotto behaved with great composure1 trust signore I do not know yourname that you will give me the chance ofcarrying out the dukes commandsMy name is St Armande replied thechevalici and 1 am ready now if vouwish itThis is scarcely the place signore butthe Vatican gardens are a few feet awayIt you aril meet me near the summer housein say half an hour Irom now it would bea convenience If we left together perhapsit would excite remark and the Spaniardplayed with the inlaid gilt of his daggerVery wedMichelotto gave St Armande a bowmade a slight inclination towards me andstrolled oh 1 o all

oung to be trusted alone It youwanted to pick a quarrel tbeie were a hundred courses open to you there are 50other men with whom you might havecrossed swords with no danger except toyourself and you

to this oryou will be run through the ribs I am going with youile gave in with a feminine gesture ofagreementThe business will not take longIt will take long enough signore if yougo as you are going and Corte stood beside us Signore he added I have overheard every word of the scene Do not goas you value your lives If you do go gowith a strong partyDiavolo 1 exclaimed an affair ofthe dagger thenSt Armande looked from one to anotherof us in surprise This is a friend chevalier 1 said who has done us good service and turning to Corte but we mustmeet the man how on earth are we to doso in any forceLook around you he made answerlike master like man stroll out Youhave some swords at your back Take themwith you but better not go at all AhI see my new master the Camulengo looking towards me be

too longto tell you here 1 said some other dayyou may bear all about him We will however take ns advice and meet Don Michelotto with an extra sword or so at ourbacks So saying I took his arm and westrolled through the apartments whereeveryone appeared to be giving full reinto his fancy In fact the beginning of anorgie iiad set in Alexander apparently recovered from the shock of meeting with hisson was at the gaming table playingheavily with Giulia Mella at his side Mayan and Gonsalvo de Cordova wore engagedin earnest converse with each other andStrigonia and DAmboise were cracking aflask

Asphalt and Redwood Blocks CombinedFifteen or twenty years ago a gooddeal was heard of wood pavements forstreets They were quiet and smoothand fairly well suited to the residencedistricts of a city but did not standthe wear and tear of heavy traffic verywell Then when the bloeks becameworn and rotten as thev did thev absorbed disease germs and lessened thesalubrity of the neighborhood Of latewood pavements have gone out of fashion almost entirely Something newin this line is now reported from Oakland Cal however and it may proveso successful as to revolutionize theideas of civil and sanitary engineersIn Oakland the wear and tear comeson a layer of asphalt which covers thewood and not directly on the latterThe blocks are six inches square andfour inches deep They are laid on abed of concrete after having beensoaked in hot asphalt A mixture ofhard asphalt and California liquid asphalt in equal parts raised to a temperature of between 350 and 400 degrees Fahrenheit is employed Theinterval during which immersion lastsis from three to five minutes This treatment renders the bloeks waterproofThey are then laid from curbstone tocurbstoneA mixture of asphalt and carbonateof lime is heated and poured uponthe wood pavement This is so soft aliquid that it runs down into all theinterstices and even works its way under the wood if there are any holesthere Not until thr fluid has beenpoured on three successive times is thesurface properly covered and the spacesbetween the blocks well filled Sandto the depth of a quarter of an inch isrolled into the asphalt when the lastapplication has been made of the latter The carpet thus formed has sohard a surface that it Avithstands ordiftrj light traffic for two or three yearsIt can be renewed at an expense of lessthan

for good roads increases more frequent attempts aremade bv the country road builders toconstruct stone or macadam roads Ofcourse some of this macadamizing iexcellently done but the great majority of cases are characterized by anutter want of thai expert knowledgewhich is required for selecting the bestmaterials and using them in the rightway Failures are especially numerousin respect to the methods adoptedsavs Otto I orner chairman of the LA YY highway improvement committeeA stone road of any kind is necessarily expensive and a poorly constructed macadam road always meansa waste of considerable funds Thesubject is therefore deserving of especial study and the farmers may bedepended upon to familiarise themselves thoroughly with the principleswhich have governed this work especially in Xew Jersey where so muchmacadamising has been done by stateaid We may expect that in time theconstruction of stone roads will become as familiar to farmers as thegrowing of wheat btit at present thereis very little general mtormation onthe subjectThe two points to be observed inbuilding stone roads are first to provide a proper foundation and secondto roll and compact the stone metalwith the utmost thoroughness To begin with the subsoil which is to serveas a foundation for the stone must beproperly crowned sloping down fromthe middle to each side of the road andmust then be rolled until it is absolutely hard and smooth The roadshould take its shape from the shapeof the foundation The stone is but acovering or roof for the protection ofthe ground beneathThe stone used should be put downin layers not more than four inchesthick and it is well where several layers of stone are used to sort the material and to use the larger pieces foithe lower layer This sorting is doneby means of a rotary screen attachedto the rock crusher In building matttdam roads in Massachusetts and Ontario the lower layer is usually composed of stone which will pass througha hole 2y2 inches in diameter The second -layer usually consists of pieceswhich will pass through a 1 inchholeRolling is the most important rintin the treatment of macadam or stoneroads A heavy roller should alwaysbe used heavy enough to wedge thepieces of stone firmly together Theroller accomplishes this by shifting thepieces about until each is lodged firmlybetween adjoining pieces which readily explains the greater effectivenessof the heavy machine Two things mayprevent successful rolling either thefailure to provide a solid foundationor the practice which is very commonof spreading gravel or dirt over a layerof stone before it is rolled The ideaof using such a binder is a bad mistake In ci iher event the dirt or gravelgetting between the loose particles ofstone will prevent their becoming firm1 wedged A mixing of stone andearth which is thus frequently broughtabout in an attempt to build a macadam road is little better than an ordinary dirt road indeed it is inferior insome particulars The material in aroad thus constructed is sure to shiftabout under the pressure of narrowtired wheels which results in the largerpit ces of stone working their way tothe top rendering the road rough anduncomfortable for travel The bestway to help the stone to bind is tothoroughly sprinkle it with water before and during the rolling process Almost every kind of stone has more orless cementing qualities and its saturation with water while it is being rolledserves admirably to help unite the different pieces firmly The second layerof stone is frequently of less thicknessthan the layer below This layer shouldalso be thoroughly and repeatedlyrolled without the use of gravel or dirtas a supposed binder and with the useof abundant water to help in cementing it After the layers of stone areentirely completed and have been thoroughly rolled and packed it is well tospread a layer of gravel by way of topdressing and to roll that thoroughlyBetter still is to make this layer ofStone screenings which will unite better than gravel does Tiiis dressing willprevent wearing the macadam roadproper and as it disappears with useand travel should be renewed fromtime to time leaving the stone construction below absolutely perfectA macadam road properly built andwith proper slope to each side will readily drain off water and snow The object of all road experts is to so constructi a

shot on the east bank of theLoangwa in the Marimba district by aEuropean prospector and its skin incomplete sent in to Capt Chichester inMper nis country The hinder half ofthe skin is being sent to
