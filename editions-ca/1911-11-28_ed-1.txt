L: Henry, of Texas,chairman of the Rules Committee ofthe House, will make an effort duringthe coming session of Congress toamend the Sherman anti-trust lawthat "trust criminals," as he termsthem, may be put in ail when thejviolate the law. He is convinced thereis no other remedy for the trust evil."Fines and dissolution suits arechild's play for trust magnates," hesaid, explaining the bill he will introduce. "Felon's stripes is the onlyremedy for these commercial outlawswho violate the law. My bill legislates the 'rule of reason' out of theSherman law, and specifically definesjust what constitutes a trust, so thatthere can be no further evasion on theground that the statute is ambiguous."The Henry bill will provide for im-prisonment for notjess than two yearsior eauu viumuuu. xue icaub uiuiii-her has assurances, he says, that hisbill will become a law.Retailers are Bad Men.The retailers and not the trusts northe tariff are responsible for the everincreasing cost of living in the UnitedStates. At least is the semi-officialstatements as to the work of the tariffboard are to be believed, this is thekind of a report that is to emanatefrom that body. "Up with the tariffrates. Down with the dry goods merchant and the corner grocer, V willliely be the protectionist cry of protectionists and near protectionists,started out with the obvious determination of finding the tariff not guilty,and they intend to return such a verdict, even though the political heavensfall.Trusts Still for Taft.That the. plutocratic trust cwnedcorporation papers do not consider Mr.Taft an enemy of the trusts despitethe "filing" of the suit against thesteel trust, s reflected in the editorialcolumns of these papers, says theWashington Bulletin. He is still "safeand sane," to be depended and he willget loyal support of the trusts in thenext presidential election. The suitcan not come to 'trial until after thenext presidential election. If thetrusts are to be put out of businessand competition restored, it will bedone by a Democratic president notby a Republican president."Economy of Production."Tainted news articles are being sentout from Washington to the effect thatif the steel trust is forced to dissolveit will be too bad for the poor consumers, for they will henceforth be deprived of the "economy of production"resulting from the one man management of the steel business of the country. The literature goes on " to saythat a great saving has been effectedby the scientific systemization of steelmanufacture by the trust.The fact is,'however, that the present prices of tin plate, wire and wireproducts, are from ten to fifty percent higher than the prices that prevailed before the formation of the tinplate and wire trusts in 1898. As aresult of the "economy of production"which accompanied the birth of thebarb wire trust, the price of thatarticle jumped from $1.80 per hundredpounds in 1898, to $4 13 in 1899. Thepresent price is $2.05, and the qualitymuch inferior to that turned out before the trust was formed.The steel rail pool maintained theprice of steel rails rigidly at $58 a tonevery day since the steel corporationwas formed. Previously, steel railswere selling well below $20 a ton.The rule has been that prices haveadvanced rapidly when trusts wereformed If, as the steel trust literature alleges, there weregreat "economies of production," the same hasgone to pay dividends of highly watered stock, to offset heavy contributionsto Republican campaign funds and tomake up the $29,000,00'o of clear profitthat J. P. Morgan drew for the parthe played inorganizing the illegal3teel trust.Majority of McCreary is 31,335.The official majority of GovernorMcCreary is 31,335 in the whole State.KHe received 226,771 votes as against195,436 for O'Kear. McDermott received 221.534, as against 190.890 for Bristow, a majority of 30,644.Compilation of figures in the otherraces has not yet been completed, andwill not be until this afternoon.The total vote Jcast in the electionfor Governor's race was 422,207, ascompared with 410,909 in the HagerWillson race in 1907. McCreary received 30,343 more votes than did JudgeHager, and O'Rear received 19,045votes less than did Gov. Willson, fouryears ago.Kentucky Ranks Sixteenth.Contrary to general belief in thevalue of horses Kentucky ranks sixteenth among the States of the Union,while in the value of mules she ranksfifth, as also in the value of asses andburros.These facts were made public intables prepared by the Census Bureauand announced Thursday. The tablesshow:That the valuafrf Kentucky's horses,mules asses and burros is $71,974,426.a figure exceeded by fifteen States,headed by Iowa.That the number of Kentucky'shorses, mules, asses and burros is672,153.That the value of Kentucky's horsesis 544,747,640, their total number442,539, of whicch 387,366 are mature.That the value of Kentucky's assesand burros is $846,266, and they number 4,667.That the average value of a matureKentucky horse is $106.22 anof a mature mule $124.50.The average value of a mature horsein this country is $112.53, or $6 morethan a Kentucky horse, and the average value ot a mule in the UnitedStates is $131.54, or $7 more than aKentucky mule.Sally Charges in WhitecappingCase.A dispatch from Carlisle Fridaysaid: "Charging that they were taken from their homes in the dead ofnight on October 20, intimidated withguns and knives and then mercilesslybeaten with switches and straps, Mrs.Mary Honaker and W. H. Scott havesworn out warrants for the arrest ofthree sons of Mr. Scott, and threeother prominent farmers of Bourboncounty.

Kimmel,or Is He the Prince ofImpostors?CLAIMS MEMORY LAPSEWeird Story of Man Released From aNew York Prison Who Claims toBe Former Respected Citizen ofMichigan Town.Niles, Mich. The first picture shownherewith Is that of George A. Kimmel,and was taken 13 years ago. The second is that of Andrew J. White, whoclaims to be Kimmel, and who camefrom Auburn Prison to prove his identity to Kimmel's family.George Kimmel was reported to havedied, and his mother and sister triedto collect $25,000 insurance on hislife. Then the man in the second picture turned up in the Auburn penitentiary and the insurance company istrying to substantiate his claim. Theman has given some evidence of aknowledge of Kimmel's family andfriends, but his supposed mother sayshe has also shown extraordinary ignorance of some thing which he shouldremember; and she doeB not recognizehim as her son, though she will notsay he Is a fraud without further Investigation. Thirteen years ago George AlfredKimmel disappeared from ArkansasCity, where he had been employed in abank, though several years before thathe had left his home in Michigan andhad never returned to visit his family.From the day of his disappearanceand up to a brief time ago when anAuburn penitentiary convict about tobe released announced that he was theKimmel and the Ex-Convict,missing man his family and friendshad no word of any kind from him,and the general opinion was that hewas dead. Seven years after her son'sdisappearance Kimmel's mother instituted suit in the St, Louis courts for,the insurance which she held on hislife. A jury rendered a verdict inher favor and declared Kimmel to belegally dead and upon this verdict onecompany paid Mrs. Kimmel on a $5,000policy. Another company which carried a $25,000 policy fought the claimand carried the matter to highercourts. Meanwhile this latter companydirected a conutrywide search for Kimmel and finally announced to the courtthat the man had been located in Auburn prison.Friends from this city went eastafter Kimmel, when word was receivedthat he had been found and they accompanied him from Auburn to Niles,having sent word immediately to hisrelatives that there wasn't a doubt intheir minds as to his identity.The ex-convict gives a rather hazybut not unconvincing account of hiswanderings since he disappeared in1898. He said: "I left Niles manyyears ago to go into business at Arkansas City in 1898, and while in St.Louis at that time I was 'slugged' byhold-up men, and for a long time mymemory was quite bad. I must havewandered much while in this condition, and eventually brought up inNew York. 1 have little to say aboutthe trouble I got into which made itnecessary for me to leave ArkansasCity or the mlxup in New York, whichresulted in my being sent to prison,but lwas not responsible at eithertime, and I do not think that I shouldbe judged for that I feel better nowthan I have for 13 years."The man, who, by the way, was convictea and sent to prison under thename of White, claims that during hisyears of prison life his mind was soclouded that anything he had to sayas to his real self was regarded as themere wanderings of an irresponsiblenarenn orirl Vint If rrroa ImnnoofMA -P-JCi OUUf UUVl bUUb AW T fc 4XU JJO& Ml U 1UIhim to proclaim himself as Kimmel.o rt .International Gasoline4All Types of Eusilage and Feed Cutting Machinery.Bourbon Oarage & Supply Co.Cor. 4th and High Sts., Paris Ky.:rMENWhen afflicted with disease, do not waste yourhard-earned money andvaluable time experimenting with uncertaintreatments, butCOME TO US.Our long experienca has Unght us what to do fromtbe start We know how.

Choate, thebrilliant lawyer, orator and diplomat,who did so much toward increasingAmerican popularity in England whilein charge of the American embassyin London.Joseph Hodges Choate was born inSalem, Mass., in 1832 and comes of afamous legal family, his father, RufusChoate, being one of the most eminentlawyers of his time. He was educatedat Harvard and was admitted to thebar in 1855. While never a politicianIn the practical sense he always tookan active interest in public affairs andduring his legal career in New Yorl:took a leading part in many of the reform movements.Fifty years ago Mr. Choate marriedMiss Caroline D. Sterling ot Cleveland. Their married life has been oneof haDDiness. Not Ions aeo somo onp-asked him who he would choose to be if he were not Joseph H. Choate."Mrs. Choate's second husband," was his instantaneous reply. At theanniversary celebration, which took place at Naumkeag, near Stockbridge.Mass., were several persons who were present at the wedding 50 years ago.Mr. Choate, because of his unique personality, his exceptional mental andphysical endowment and his rare intellectual and social powers, will be remembered as one of our strongest representatives at the British Court. Whilein England Mr. Choate was a general favorite.CANADA'S ROYAL GOVERNORThe Dominion of Canada deeply appreciates the honor which . has beenconferred on her by the appointmentof the Duke of Connaught as governorgeneral and will give his royal highness a most enthusiastic welcome onhis arrival. The distinction which isCanada's in having, as a representative of the British throne, an uncle ofKing George will be more readily understood when it is stated that neverbefore has a prince of the royal bloodbeen sent as governor general to anyof the British possessions over theseas. The nearest approach to suchdistinction waa when the PrincessLouise, daughter of Queen Victoria,resided in Canada with her husband,the Marquis of Lome, who was thengovernor general. The marquis afterward became and is now the Dukeof Argyle.The Duke of Connaught is the onlysurviving son of Queen Victoria. Hewas her third son and the seventh ofher nine children. His surviving sisters are Helena, Princess Christian;Louise, Duchess of Argyle, and Beatrice, Princess Henry of Battenburg. Ifso good a mother as Queen Victoria justly may be said to have had a favorite son, then Arthur William Patrick Albert, Duke of Connaught, wasthat son, just as the Princess Beatrice may be said to have been her favoritedaughter. The duke was born in 1850, shortly after a visit which QueenVictoria made to Ireland, and it Is due to an incident of that visit that hebears, the name Patrick. In 1897 the duke married the beautiful PrincessLouise, of Prussia, second cousin to the present Kaiser. He has three children.MAY HEAD CHINESE REPUBLICDr. Sun Yat Sen, the Chinese reformer, who was banished from theempire not long ago and is now inthe United States, is believed to beslated for the presidency of the republican government when the Chinese revolutionists can take timeenough from fighting to organize.There Is said to be a standing offerfrom the Pekin government of $50,000for the body of Sun Yat Sen, dead oralive.Each succeeding day has added tothe gravity of the situation in China.The imperial government, having discovered that the usual methods usedin uprisings throughout the empire areentirely Inadequate in this case, hasgotten down to the business of realwarfare. But the misjudgment of thesituation, and the consequent delayin real repressive measures, have given the revolutionists an opportunityto become hetter organized, drawgreater forces to its standard andseize more territory.Yuan Shi Kai. the banished war head who was recalled recently, has accepted the post of viceroy of Hu-Peh and Hu-Nan provinces, to which territory he is directed to proceed and immediately re-establish the imperial authority.HARVESTER HEAD IS SUEDClarence S. Funk, general managerof the International Harvester Company, the McCormick's man of business, clubman, churchman and aspirant for the title of one of Chicago'sleading citizens, was recently sued byJohn Henning, who asks $25,000 damages on the claim that Funk hasalienated the affections of his wife,Josephine Henning. To say that thesuit created a sensation is to" put itmildly. Funk has recently been before the public of Chicago in so-calledmoral uplift movements, which wellbefitted a man of church professions,and his talk of furthering such causeshas made him more or less wellknown to the newspaper public, consequently when the suit was filed itcaused wide interest. Mr. Funk entered a denial, emphatic and vigorousas it was possible for a man to make.It is said Mr. Funk first saw and admired Mrs. Henning while she workedin the Auditorium Annex cafe. Mrs.Henning is said to be not only good looking hut a real beauty.Clarence S. Funk is sufficiently in the public eye to warrant the sensationcaused by the John Henning's charges. He is widely known as the Generalmanager of the International Harvester Company and has been a familiarfigure at Washington, and at Springfield, and In the capitals of other states.In Chicago he, Is prominent in many ways. He is married and lives in thesuburbs of Oak Park. He is known as an active church worker. He has hada Bible class In the First Congregational church and is active in the Y. M.C.
