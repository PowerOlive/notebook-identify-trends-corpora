the American Commissioners as a Basis for a Stand atthe End on the PhilippinesWashington Oct 27 Some apprehension has been manifested in certainquarters as to the possible adverse effect upon the peace commission at Parisof an upheaval in France It has beensuggested that the Spanish cause isin such shape that the Spanish government has nothing to lose andeverything to gain by any changethat can be brought about Howeverit may be stated that in the opinion of the state department officials here there is little danger ofthe situation in Paris becoming soacute as to justify an abandonment ofthe work of the commission on theground that the commissioners themselves are in physical danger It isconfidently believed that with thechange of the cabinet in France thepresent disorder will subside and normal conditions will be restored It isalways possible that the Spanish commissioners in despair overtheir failure to force the Cuban debtupon the United States in any shapemay break off the sessions but this isnot regarded as probable It is suspected the Spanish programme is totrump up as -many points of differenceas possible relying upon the sympathysure to be excited among European nations by their abandonment of eachpoint under compulsion from theAmerican commissioners as the basisfor a supreme stand at the end on thePhilippinesThe Spanish commissioners declarethat a circular note will be addressedto the powers declining the seriousconsequences which the assumption ofthe Cuban debt would have upon thesolvency of SpainHaving done this they will bow tothe inevitable because they have beengiven clearly to understand that theUnited States will not go a step furtherwith the negotiations until the way iscleared of the Cuban debt question andcomplete evacuation of the island ispromised f cr Januar3r 1 1S99Washington Oct 27 There are indications that the peace commissionersin Paris are approaching the end of theconsideration of the subject of Cubaand Porto Rico and officials here wouldnot be surprised if Wednesdays sessionof the commission concluded those sublets leaving the commission free totake up the most important matter inrffirjrotopnV namely the disposition ofthe Philippines The Spanish case hasbeen presented with an ability andadroitness that commands the admiration of diplomats without regard tonationality and even our ownofficials have been compelled to yielda tribute of respect to the argumentsproduced but they have been of noavail in effecting any substantialchange in the first attitude of theAmerican commissioners who areholding firmly1 to the line of procedureoriginally outlined It is expected herethat henceforth after the courteousintimation that has been conveyed tothe Spanish commissioners that it istime to regard the Cuban and PortoRican matters as settled better progress will be made towards the finalconclusion of a treaty of peaceLondon Oct 27 The Paris correspondent of the Times saysAt Wednesdays sitting the Spanishpeace commissioners presented a newcounter memorandum declaring theirreadiness provisionally to accept anarticle of a preliminary treaty stipulating that Spain shall relinquish allrights to sovereignty in Cuba withoutformulating any other claim andto leave in suspense all remainingquestions especially the PhilippinesThe Americans asked until Thursdajto reply to this new memorandumThis is regarded as a favorable signbeing a slight relaxation of the rigiditj the Americans have hitherto shownThey are perhaps aware that the Cuban and even the Spanish bondholdersarc becoming alarmed at the strangeturn of the financial side of the discussion in -which Spain the UnitedStates and Cuba with extraordinaryunanimity and carelessness all repudiate the Cuban debtNobody will be able to force Spainto accept the debt for apart frombankruptcy she could only meet theliabilities at the expense of her foreignbondholders who by a strange anomaly would thus have to pay for the independence of CubaIt is not likely that the United Statesor any other power can or will forceSpain to ruin herself by meeting theCuban debt and it will then either beti total loss for Europe or be paid bythe Spanish bondholdersThw Sorm at SheboysrnnShkboygan Wis Oct 27 The Ipssto dock property by Tuesday nightsgale will amount to many thousandJ bvy dollars Over 100 feet of the Taylordock was washed out

especiallysince the bombardment of May 12 Be-sides the Morro there are two other jforts or as they are called castles jwhich add greatly to the strength ofthe citys defenses The more important of these is the castle of SanCristobal which is within the citygates and about a half mile east ofMorro It is a massive structure occupying the crest of a high hill and itis used as the headquarters of a regiment of artillery The fort of SanGeronimo is the easternmost of thecitys fortifications It stands between the Atlantic ocean and an inletBack on the hill near Morro is theinsane asylum a long

hesitated Florence hei i 1p XllI Aat oncementHenry had to go with his reggMrs Hayne is coming back is shQinot he queried of Florence but hadto repeat the query twice She onlyshook her headHe waited a moment Listen Florence dear he presently said as hebent compassionately over her I amordered on guard at once and I mustgo to relieve Henry Even though Icannot tell you what Mrs McLanewishes to see mc about this I will tellyou dear If I must see her you shalLknow it first from me and not hear ofit through some meddling gossipHe was wondering as he walked awaywho could have told his wife he hadcalled at Graftons and asked for MrsMcLane He was too proiid to inquireHe had kissed her gently forgivinglyas he said to himself before comingaway and promised that he would bewith her again if only for a few minutes before the signal for lights outHe found nenry swearing with impatience as the youngster had a raftof preparations to make and it wasvery late nearly 11 oclock before hehad reestablished the sentry posts asordered by the new officer of the dayThe trumpets sounded taps to heedless ears and the lights burned brightly in all the barracks and the trooperswho were not to go were chaffing thedough boys who were and so mixing up not a little in the work of preparation He had seen Hayne a momentand had been told that Mrs Haynewould run back to Florence again assoon as she had seen to the packingof his mess chest and field kit Thechildren were to be allowed to sit upand see the regiment off Merriam supposed when taps came that by this timeMrs Hayne was with Florence but allthe same he left the guard in chargeof the sergeant a few minutes and hurried away over the parade and up toher room and there he found her lyingalmost as he had left her face downward upon the sofa and all aloreThrowing aside his belt and saberEandy knelt b her side and stvovegently to turn her toward himHave vou no welcome for me nowmy little girl he murmured Do yourealize this is the first trouble that hasever come between us and that Im being very very much abused for something hat is no fault of mine Histone and manner were almost playfuldespite a certain soreness at heart hecould not quite ignore but Floy resisted and was silent I have only amoment or two my wife he presentlycontinued gravely and sadly You aresoldier enough to know I should not beaway from my guard even now but myheart yearned over you Florence inyour illness and distress and I had tosteal a moment Wont you come intomy arms a little while and let me kissaway the traces of those foolish tearsAh who knows how much her hearttoo may have been pleading with hispleading voice at the moment yetthedevil of her jealous love kept rigidguard between themI shall do very well she answeredcoldly Mrs Hayne was here and Itold her not to stay pause thenneither need youAt first he pould not believe hissenses The wild outburst of a fewhours before was something easily accounted for in one so young and passionate but this cold repellant remorseless refusal this practical dismissal of his proffer of love comfortand caresses this was something utterly unlike Florence It not onlyamazed it stung him and rising slowly to his feet he stood one moment look-1 ing down at her in deep bewildermentand with no little effort curbing histongue and temper The pretty wrapper she wore had become disarrangedand one slender slippered foot that projected from beneath its shelter wastapping nervously the foot of the sofaStifling a sigh he looked about himtook from a neighboring chair a heavyshawl she had been using earlier in theday and carefully spreading it overher as to cover even the rebellious foothe quietly picked np his saber and asquietly walked to the door Thereturning about he looked back at herWithout changing her position she hadcalmly stripped off the shawl with herright hand and dropped it to the floorThe slippered foot was still beating itsnervous irreconcilable tattoo as heslowly

British judges who are held to aclose accountability to the letter of alaw which may have in it no justicefor a particular case may well sigh forthe latitude of an oriental cadi Sometimes moreover they may rightfullybend the administration of the law inthe directiou of absolute justiceAn English paper for instance records a peculiar decision in the suitof a usurer against a poor woman Theman had lent the woman money insuch a way that it was to be paid intwo installments and with monthlyusurious interest The woman was unable to pay the amount dueThe judge satisfied himself that thewoman was honest and honorable andthat what she had already paid in instalments would cover the original loanand a reasonable interestWill you accept five pounds fn discharge asked the judge of the plaintiff you will then have had ten percent on the loanThe plaintiff would accept nothingless than the full amount to whichthe law entitled himThen said the judge although Icannot in validate the agreement I canmake an order which I think will fitthe case I give judgment for the fullamount to be paid at the rate of sixpence a monthThis was the instalment systemwith a vengeance for at this rate of payment the usurer would be 75 years ingetting his money Youths CompanionWhat Could He MensrWell said the merchant to theyoung clerk whom he had sent out collecting did you have any luckSomeI

storm signals sayNor how the heavy rain clouds lowerThe little woman in our homeMakes sunshine every hourPerhaps tis scattered from her curlsIll tell you whats my firm beliefI think a little golden rayOf sunshine somehow came to griefAnd falling on her dainty headThought mid its tresses it would hideAnd then enamored of its nestResolved there to abideAnd then I think the fogs one nightWhen earth was lost in sweet reposePilfered the fragrant dainty tintsInclosed within a sleeping roseThen stole from out a pansys heartTwo limpid drops of perfumed dewAnd then they bathed her cheeks and eyesGiving them thus- their witching hueIf pain or worry seams my browOur little woman finds it outAnd by the sunshine of her smilesSoon puts the vapors all to routTheres magic in her gentle touchAnd in her laughing vibrant voiceThe sound of her light springing stepCan make my heart rejoiceShes like a flash now here now thereAnd always on her nimble feetShes all about the house at onceWith happy song and laughter sweetWhen sometimes teardrops dim her eyesLike showers on an April dayTheyve scarcely fallen ere her smilesHave chased them all awayDear little woman Her tiny handsSmooth many a pain and fret awayShe brings into the sweet home lifeAn added beauty every dayAnd yet shes but a wee wee maidA laughing dancing merry spriteBut ah our little woman stillOur treasure our delightClaudia

blastThese preliminaries completed he thenbegan to speak His voice was a disappointment it was the voice of an effeminate man when in a fit of nervousness and at no time did it have anyresonant sonorousness sometimes itwas actually feeble and not infrequently he would interrupt himselfwith a little nervous cough which leftthe sentence unfinishedI am no orator he says in one of hispublished speeches I have not thegift of influencing yoiir minds nor ofobscuring the real meaning of thingsby a cloud of words My discourse issimple and clear A good orator is seldom a good statesman Andagain When a man is too fluent ofspeech he talks too long and too frequently As might be imagined hewas no friend of the great contemporary statesman and orator Gladstone of whom he once said to an acquaintance If I had brought ashumiliations on my country as Gladstone has on his I would be unfit toruleIn a sense his disclaimer of the orators gifts was justified Indifferentto the audience directly before himhis real speech was addressed to thegreat German reading public and totheworld Accordingly that which wasdelivered even on the most importantoccasions was scrappy and rather inthe nature of a chat with the deputiesOften his sentences were jerky and leftthe impression that the speaker wasnot exactly certain what to say andnot veiy much in earnest as to what heactually was saying Many heard himwith the bitterest disappointment Hisuncertainty of utterance was no safeguard against prolixity he seemed attimes to be indulging in that form ofdiscourse yhieh our slang designatesas talking through ones hat andconseqxiently he often let slip the loosest assertions Moreover the construction of his sentences was frequentlyportentousOn the occasion to which I have beenparticularly

BatTwo men were talkingWhat I admire among our artisan classsaid one with the air of a superior personis a little broader knowledge than is defined by the mere walls of his shop JNowI have in mind two shoemakers whom Isee occasionally as they are both tenantsof mine Both of them are prompt industrious honest men but one is as ignorantas he can be even about the details cf hisown trade Why I asked him the otherday where shoe pegs were made and ofwhat wood and he hasnt the least ideaand I had to tell him On the contrarythe other one not only knew that muchbut was up on the history of shoes andtheir material and manufacture and heinterested me for half an hour by a mostinstructive talk on his occupation Thereis a vast difference I think between twomen situated as those two are and it isgreatly to the credit of one that ho acquires knowledge not because it is absolutely necessary but because of his desireto broaden and see something more thanwhat may dangle at a waxend or spreaditself over a side of sole leather Dont youthink as I doUm er hesitated the other man Iknow your two shoemakers and have hadwork done by both of them and I noticeanother difference that you

W UflDTER-Clarks 0 N T 3 for 10cWaiters and WaitressesTalking of waitresses a New Yorkhotel keeper says that although theymay possess some superior qualities forsuch service there are on the otherhand such drawbacks as make it certain that they would never be acceptable to the majority of men who wouldhave to be served by them He saysI think the objection to them wouldbe based chiefly on the fact that theynever show especial attention to anyperson I never knew a woman whowaited on a man to trouble herself inthe least about the manner in whichshe served him It makes absolutely nodifference whether they receive liberaltips or not They may be quiet neatand quick but they would never pickout one piece of beef because it wasbatter than another or make any effortto get the best of what was to be hadin the kitchen That sort of attentionmakes a man worth his fee to the menwho tip himIt is this special service that makesa waiter superior to the best of his associates Women never detect any difference between the quality of one dishand another They are all the sameand good service requires merely thatthey shall be set down noiselessly andbrought quickly There the service ofthe waitress ends She can beat anyman at those features of the businessBut she cannot select for him anythingbetter than the rest of the customersget Usually she does not notice anydifference in them That deficiency isthe safeguard of the waiter and willkeep his place secure for himA German Word SerpentA German correspondent comes to therescue of his countrymen concerningwhom we expressed surprise that theyshould prefer to use a word of four syllables when another word expressingthe same thing in 40 syllables wasavailable He sends us a copy of TheKolnische Volkszeitung in which occurs a sentence of

a rifle bullet in the spine of a boaconstrictor killed the whole sentenceBut it must really be nice to have newspapers in which you can begin to reada sentence at breakfast continue it inthe train and
