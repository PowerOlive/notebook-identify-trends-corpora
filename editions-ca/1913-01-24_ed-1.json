Horse Trades Must be Honest.
An indictment for "obtaining monev
b y false pretenses" in a horse deal is
not defective because the word "get"
is used instead of "obtained" in the
indictment, and that it names the ani
mal sold a "horse" when it wa-3 a
"mare," declared the Court of Ap
peals this week in affirming the sen
tence of one to five years imposed on
Oni Hale by the Calloway Uircuit
Court for obtaining bv false pretenses
from Isaac Woodall $75 for a worthless
