A Paramount Picture
From the Famous Story by Winston
' Churchill
Gilded gentry of the "better sort!" Prattling of "social
standing!" Defiling the church with their heartless hypoc
risy! Building their empty pride with the toil of others!
And then that "other sort" of person! The heart
hungry girl who finds the narrow path too hard. The boy
who tries, loses, stumbles down. The poor who riot when
their "betters" steal their homes.
Two mighty human . millstones, grinding out life,
drama, radiant romance in the thrilling scenes of this
great picture.
A story of dark souls filled with light by the power of
a boundless love.
