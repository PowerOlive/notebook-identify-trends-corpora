courtesies extended me during the
many years that I served Millersburg
at news agent. I have bucked up
against all kinds of weather, I have
contended with many obstacles,- and
at times I have grown tired, as I
plodded mv weary way, during the
darit rainy hours of night, from the
bridge to Judyviile. My sole object
inall-'tbis; time. -was to serve my pat
rons faithfully This I. have tried to
do, nhd 'believe'--! have succeeded: At
times there was some trival difficul
ties, some misunderstandings, but
most of them, however, were easily
arranged, and I trust'that as I am
now out of the work all of them may
be obliterated, and cancelled from the
memory of ) time. During all the
years, from January 1. 1908 to April
1 1919, I was in touch with all tne
people of Milersburg. and the rela
tionship between the public and my

msiiy pleasant smiles and words that
I received from many of them, and
the encouuagement which was often
times helpful and made , my step
lighter during the remainder of my
nightly rounds. However, I am still
irr business in Millersburg. If. I have
served you faithfully in the vocation
that I have Just given, up I will do
aU I can to serve yuu iu. mc
that I have just taken up. Give me
a call; you will receive courteous
treatment, prompt attention nd
prompt delivery, if you reside within
the limits of Millersburg. In the vo
cation I have just given up I must
say good-bye; in the vocation I have
iust taken up. I will say good-morning,
come in. As the memories of
tSe past are pleasant, I trust that I
mav be for me a sweeter and hri&ht

that I have enjoyed. Once more

LINCOLN LIKED FARM
Washington was a farmer at the
time of his death and loved the soil
devotedly. President Lincoln lived
close to the soil as a boy and believ
ed firmly in the broadening effect of
living rationally in the country. His
viewpoint can be secured from the
following quotation:
"No other occupation opens so
wide a field for the profitable and
agreeable combination of labor with
cultivated thought as agriculture.
"I know of nothing so pleasant to
the mind as the discovery of any
thing that is at once new and valua
ble nothing that so lightens and
sweetens toil as the hopeful pursuit
of such discovery. And how vast
and varied a field is 'agriculture for
such discovery. The mind already
trained to thought in the country
school, or high school, cannot fail to
find there an exhaustive source of
enjoyment. Every blade of grass is"a
study; and to produce two where
there was but one is both a profit
and a pleasure.
