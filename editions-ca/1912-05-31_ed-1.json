All of the commanderies carried

Blue Grass Crop Heavy in Ken
tucky.
The crop of bluegrass seed which is
ready to be gathered is considered the
haviest that has been raised for several
years. Central Kentucky produces
practically all of the bluegrass of the
world, and the crop of seed is one. cf
the important revenues of the Central
Kentucky farmer. The annual produc
tion runs all the way from 300,000 tc
800.000 bushels, and this year it i esti
mated may make almost 1.000. 00Q bush
els. The price varies from 40 or 50
cents to $1 per bushel. In view of the
heavy crop the sales this year are
starting at 50 cents a bushel as it
stands in the pasture, the buyer doing
the stripping. An acre of bluegrass
will produce from 15 to 30 bushels of
seed, and as the reaping of the seed in
no way impairs the value ot the grass
for grazing purposes, the sale of the
seed stands as a special premium paid
annually to the owner of bluegrass sod.
