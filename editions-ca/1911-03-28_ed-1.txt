Besides formulating stringent rules on postage and making thegovernment a direct competitor withevery jon-printing plant in the countryin the business of printing private envelopes, the printers are highly tarifftaxed on the material and machineryused by them.First and foremost in the high tarifftax on wood pulp, paper and cardboardand the products thereof. The abolition of the tariff tax would check theenormous drain now being made onthe rapidly disappearing forests of ourcountry and would give the printerssome measure of relief from constantly-increasingprices being exacted bythe paper trust.Linotyp?, typecasting and typesetting machines, and parts thereof, aretariff taxed 30 per cent. Since noneare imported and no revenue derivedtherefrom, the conclusion must naturally be cjrawn that this tax is leviedfor some "special interest,' 'which requires no painstaking or laborioussearch to find. Undei the protecti mthe linotjpe trust is enabled to sellfor over $3,000 a machine that costs itonlj about $750 to build; has pboughtand suppressed over 800 competingpatents, thus keeping off the marketin this country other meritorious machines that would have competed withthe lirotype and forced that machineto ha sold at a I reasonable price: hasextended its grip to Canada and acquired control of the monoline, the onlymachine that has seriously competedwith the linctype outside the UnitedStates, the manufacture and sale ofthe monoline in this country havingbean prevented by the linotype trust.The Canadian reciprocity agreementwill remove the tariff tax from woodpulp, paper and cardboard, and fromtypecasting and typesetting machinesand parts therof when importedfromCanada into the United States Linotype machins should also be includedin this agreement, and we hope ourtwo Senators and eleven representatives will see that it is done when theextra session meets, and that all ofthem will vote for Canadian reciprocity. California Must Be Good.The deal made between PresidentTaft and the members of the California delegation in Congress, wherebySan Francisco was to get the PanamaCanal Exposition only one promisethat no anti-Japanese legislation of aradical character be passed, hangs inthe balance. The President intimatedto his callers that unless anti-Japaneselegislation now pending before theCalifornia Assembly is speedilysquelched, in accordance with theterms of the deal, he will invito noforeign powers to participate in theexposition.Can Employ Assistants.Attorney General Breathitt Fridaygave Commissioner of AgricultureRank in an opinion in which it is heldthat in case of an emergency theCounty Live Stock Inspector may employ as many agents or assistants asto him seems reasonably necessary,and that the services of thse agents orassistants must be paid by the FiscalCourt in the same manner as the services of the County Live Stock Inspector.

It isjust as unreasonable to expect the same results from thin, weak soil, in comparisonwith deep, rich soil, as it is to expect a child to do a man's work. This is a reasonable proposition, particularly to the scientific corn gruwer.More moner is being spent and greater efforts along educational lines are beingmade to-day than ever before in the world's history to increase the yield of corn percacre. We contributed a very large effort to accomplish tnese results with our BlackHawk single kernel edge drop, and we now add to our combination the No. 15 Variable Drop, with which the drop can be changed to 2, 3 or 4 kernels in a hill withoutstopping the team; or can drill 7 1-2, 10 or 15 inches, 9, 12 or 17 1-2 inches, or 11, 14or 22 inches apart, without stopping the team.with each Planter, has Foot DroD also.

A. li KELLER,Practicing Physician,A Terrible Fxperience.James Long and family, near PeckRidge, had a terrible experience attheir home one day recently. Mr.Long, while in his yard, saw his 3-year-oldbabetoddle to an open-top cistern and fall in. There was 8 feet ofwater in the cistern, but Mr. Long,without hesitation, pulled off his coatand jumped in after the child. Withthe babe in his arm he swam andstruggled in the water and his 14-year-oldson threw him a strap, with whichhe managed for a while to keep hisface above the water, but unfortunatelythe boy let go of the strap. To makethings worse the boy then became excited and jumped into the water alsoand Mr. Long was then confrontedwith the problem of saving himselfand two of his children. AIL wouldhave drowned, but for the arrival ofMrs Long on the scene. With presence of mind she secured a rail andput in the cistern, and with this Mr.Long supported himself and childrenuntil the heroic wife hurried for arope. Securing this, she first pulledout the babe, unconscious, which shelaid on the ground face down. Thenthe boy was pulled out with the aidof the rope and the rail, and last thehusband. Attention was immediatelyturned to the unonscious babe and byproper manipulation ' and work thechild was revived. It was a terribleexperience for the Long family, andoup thru which they hope never to passagain. Mr. Long has securely fastened up the open top to the cistpn andwill see that it remains closed.lamingsburg Gazette.MARCH REPORT OF PARIS PUBLICSCHOOLS.This has been a most prosperousmonth with the exception of a considerable reduction in attendance due tomeasles and whooping cough.

Y.How He Did ItBy LOUISE IDA ROSSCopyright fcy American Press Association, 1DU.There were two things Frank Trowbridge excelled in, but before statingthein it is better to give the information that Frank's whole front namewas Frances and she was a girl. Thetwo accomplishments were flirting andathletics. She lived in summer on alake ten miles long by three to sismiles broad and could beat any othergirl near it rowing, sailing, swimming,diving, Ashing and any other sportingaccomplishment fitted for women. Theboys were all In love with her.Frank wasn't overscrupulous as tomaking believe that she returned theiraffection, at least to a slight degree,but nothing definite could be got outof her by any of them: Charlie Wiggins, who was a year or two olderthan the rest of them and consequently harder for her to manage, was acool sort of a chap, and it bothered herbecause she couldn't tease him as sheteased the others. Near the end of asummer she had half promised lo beengaged to half a dozen fellows andfeared she would be obliged to beserious with some one of them. Charliecame up from the city for a twoweeks' vacation. It struck Frank thatby giving him the most of her timethe others would drop out of the race,thinking that he was the lucky man.Then when they found they were mistaken she could accuse them of having deserted her.Charlie fell Into the trap very easily;but, though ho didn't let Frank knowit, he had no mind to fall out Withher permission, to say nothing of encouragement, he devoted himself toher till just before the time when hemust leave Then he laid his own trap."Frank," he said, "that little singlesticker your father gave you in thespring is a dandy, isn't she?""She can beat anything on the lake.""Except my Gertrude.""EL'm! Your Gertrude's a tub. Bythe bye, who's she named for?""That's a secret"Frank slowly raised her long lashesand gave him a look."You think she can beat my Polly,eh?""I'm sure of it.""I'll bet you a pound of andyagainst""Nonsense! Do you suppose I racefor trifles?""What stakes would you rape for?"Charlie didn't reply for some time.Then he said: "I'll race my Gertrudein a wind fair for both two miles upand two miles back. If you lose youmarry me; if you win I marry""Whom?""My boat.""I know what you mean. You'llmarry this mysterious Gertrude."There's no knowing by what feminine process Frank made up her mindto accept the challenge. She certainlyhadn't the slightest doubt that thePolly could sail around the Gertrudein circles, the latter being notoriouslythe most sluggish boat on the lake.But she was a trifle jealous of thisunknown Gertrude, and Charlie wasto marry her If he were beaten. Bethis as it may, the race was made upto take place on the first day therewas a sufficient breeze. Frank was tosail the Polly aud Charlie the Gertrude. On the day of the race there was abreeze varying from 4 to 10 knots.Charlie gave Frank permission to inspect his boat, which she did, butCharlie declined to inspect the Polly.Most of Frank's semifiances as wellas many others were on hand to seethe race, but no one knew the stakes.All expected that it would be a walkover for Frank.A designated starter fired a pistol,and when the boats sailed over theline another was fired, indicating thatthe race was on. As was expected,the Gertrude dropped astern of herrival from the first But when theformer had got over half and the latterthree-eighths of a mile the Gertrudeceased to lose. The Polly turned thestake boat a quarter of a mile ahead,when the Gertrude began to make aslight gain. This was astonishing, forshe didn't careen any more under afresher breeze, indicating she didn'tget one. She was not long In catchingthe Polly and not much 'longer In pulling ahead of her, though this at firstwas hard to tell, for Wiggins passeda hundred yards to her lee. This wasconsidered ivery good of him, since hisboat did not blanket his rival.Meanwhile the breeze had lost nearlyhalf its force. But while this made agreat deal of difference in the speedof the Polly it did not affect that ofthe Gertrude. The latter sailed on,slowly gaming on her rival, coming inan eighth of a mile ahead. The winner was received with no especialdemonstrations, for sympathy was allwith the lady. But what was lost Inrooting was made up in surprise. Wiggins remained in his boat till Frankcame in beside him, blushing like apeony, at which every one wondered.Charlie stepped into her boat andhanded her ashore, saying as he did so:"Ladies and gentlemen, I take bothpride and pleasure in Introducing myfiancee."The half dozen semifiances who werepresent were crushed, and Frank wished she were at the bottom of the lake."How did you do It, Charlie?" sheasked that evening when they wereconsulting about an engagement ring."I bored a hole in the bow and onein the stern, with a pipe between them.With my feet I pumped water fromthe bow nnd drove It out at the stemSee?"-MT think I do."
