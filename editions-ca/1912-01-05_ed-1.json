CURIOUS BITS
OF HISTORY
QUEER
DOINGS AT
MORE.
BALTI-
By A. W. MACY.
There were some queer do- ,
Ings at Baltimore eighty years
ago. Witness this from Grif
fith's "Annals of Baltimore,"
published in 1833: "December
14 (1829), thirty-seven persons
are drawn by one horse, in a
car, planned by Mr. Ross Wi
nans, of New Jersey, on the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, at
the rate of about ten miles per
hour, or as fast as the horse
could trot or gallop; which was
done In the presenpe and to the
' astonishment of a multitude of
spectators, who, not having wit
nessed such an exhibition could
scarcely realize the effect." And
"Peter Parley's First Book of
History," published about the
same time, says: "But the most
curious thing at Baltimore is
the railroad. This consists of
iron bars laid along the ground,
and made fast so that carriages
with small wheels may run
along them with facility. In this
way, each horse will be able to
draw as much as ten horses on
a common road. A part of this
railroad is already done, and if
you choose to take a ride upon
It, you may do so. You will
mount a carriage something like
a stage, and then" you will be
drawn along by two horses at
the rate of twelve miles an
hour."

336 Main Street
At The Big Bcclric Sign.
Paris, Kentucky.
Ignoring the allegecTcharges 0f in
efficiency and negligence that had re
sulted in opposition being brought out
against him, Joseph Williams, the
present incumbent, was elected town
marshal by the Millersburg City Coun
cil at its regular meeting Wednesday
night over Henry Bowling who held
the position prior to the election of
Mr. Williams six years ago. The elec
tion of Mr. Williams was made poss
ible only by the vote of Mayor Wad
dell, after the members of the Board
had become equally divided between
the two candidates, the vote standing
three to three, when the Mayor cast
the deciding vote.
Interest has centered in the election
of the marshal for several days,. Mr.
Bowling announcing his candidacy,
aoout ten aays ago, and rumors which
received flagrant circulation created a
great amount of dissatisfaction and
had the effect of producing a warm
fight in the Council chamber when
that body met.
It was learned Tuesday evening that
three of the board, which is composed
of six members had pledged them
selves to the support of Bowling, but
the" intensity of the situation increased
when it was circulated that the three
of the Councilmen had not qualified on
or before the first of January, which
left the impression that they Would
have no voice in the election. Judge
Dundon, of Paris, set the rumor to
rest when he quoted the law on the
subject, which was to the effect that
a councilman could be sworn in any
time prior to the first of January or
on the date of the first meeting in the
year.
The council assembled at 7:30 o'clock
with Mayor Waddell in the chair. A
large crowd, anticipating a rather
warm fight, had assembled. The min
utes of the last meeting were re.ad and
approved and a number of small ac
counts approved and ordered paid,
which was followed by the election of
officers.
The election ot T. J. Judy as city
clerk was made by -the unanimous vote
of the board as was that of J. H. Bur
roughs, who was nominated for the
office of city treasurer. Beth men
were elected to succeed themselves,
no opposition being presented.
Following the election of these
officers the matter of selecting a
marshal was taken up and Mr. Henry
Bowling was placed in nomination by
Councilman J. J. Peed, which recieved
a second from Councilman D. P. Jones.
Councilman Rufus Butler put Mr.
Williams in nomination, which was
seconded by W. A. Butler. A vote
was taken which resulted in tie and
Judge Waddell cast the deciding vote
in favor of Mr. Williams. The election
of Williams resulted in a marked
demonstration on the part of the
majority of the spectators, many of
whom left the city hall before a lively
tilt between Councilman W. F. Car
penter and Marshal Williams occurred,
in regard to some street woik, and
hot word passed between them. May
or Waddell took a hand in the matter
and adjusted th affair.
O. H. Collier was elected city as
sessor and Mayor Waddell announced
the appointment of his committees
which are as follows : Street Commit
tee Rufus Butler, W. A. Butler, E.
M. Ingles s Finance Committee W. A.
Butler, J. J. Peed, W. F. Carpenter;
night Committee Rufus Butler, W.
F. Carpenter and E. M. .Ingles; Build
ing Committee T. P. Waddell, E. M
Ingles, W. F. Carpenter.
An ordinance introduced to reduce
the laundry license failed to carry. A
summarized report of the city treasur
er is as follows: Balance on hand
January 1, 1911, 2,799.17; collected
from taxes, $2, 336. 93; licenses, $399.50;
miscellaneous, $119.40; total, $5, 656. 00.
The disbursements are as follows:
Orders and Warrants, 3.465,07: Bal
ance on hand January 1, 1912, $2,191.
93; Total, $5,656 00.
According to City Treasurer Bur
roughs, more than $1,000 will be added
to the city's fund within the next few
days from taxes now outstanding
which will be collected within a verv
short period. The city at present is
in a better financial conditicn than at
any time within the past six years.
considering the vast amount of im
provements .that have been made. In
a few days the electric Rcht nlant
will be accented and at that timp tho
city .will pay to the Fairbanks-Morse
Co., of Cincinnati, O.. the sum of
1,300, which from the present state,
ment will leave over 900 in .the citv
treasury.
Except when the saloons existed
here and paid a license into the city
treasury, has there been a more
healthy condition of the city's finances.
Judge Waddell and Marshal Willams
have both added greatly to the city's
fund in the amount )f fines assessed
and collected. Mr. Williamsjias savtd
the city much in superintending the
construction of streets, crossings, etc.,
which prior to the election six years
ago, was under the supervision of men
employed by the city at a -salary of not
less than $2.50 per day. The report of
tht treasurer for the past six years is
fSioilows: 1906, $1,489.80; 19G7, $V
0&9.58;1908, $899.63' 1909, $1,195.84;
1910, $.208.07; 1911, $1,86. 57 1912,
52,191.23.
The charges which are registered
against Williams grew out of the diffi
culty a few nights ago in which a
negro was shot in the home of Will
Washington,, and the report was start
ed that not one of the participants in
the crap game in which they were en
gaged were arrested. However it de
veloped that all were taken into cus
tody with the exception of two and in
each case they were find in poliece
court. Will Washington, whp was con
ducting the game is in (he Paris jail
awaiting the action of thu next', grand
jury for suffering gamins' on his
It is said there exist on the outer
edges of town several low dives,' but
it is impossible to detect any vio
lations of the law that might be going
on there,, due to the fact that one
policeman is insufficient to detect any
evil practices before operations are
ceased. .This is the case in many small
towns, where the officers of the law
are constantly watched, and their ap
proach tipped off in ample time to re
move incriminating evidence;
