MILLERSBURG ITEMS. again called to order. President Allen
j in the chair. The two committees
. . ' made reports which were adoDted. A
the twenty-first annual meeting of ' sum of.Sl.000 was voted forithe use of
the Hurst Home Fraternl Insurance j additional inspectors and it was or-
Go., convened at the Hurst Home , dered that all property now insured bv
office Wednesday morning. Ihe meet- the comDanv be insnep.tnd dnrin? the
coming year. The committee on by
laws recommended that a time of
mmamam &m
ing was one of more than ordinary in-'
terest. inasmuch as the General Man
ager and Secretary, Mr. F. F. Hurst,
had died during the year and his succ-'
cessor was to be elected. The meeting
was called to order about ten o'clock
with President J G. Allen, of Millers-.
ourg in tne cnair.
The roll call oi the counties showed ,
the following delegates in their places : i
W. F. Heathman and A. P. Adair,

meeting be changed from the second
week in August to the first week as
the company's books closed August 1,
besides the Lexington fair being the
second week in August interfered
with the meeting.
The election of the executive com

of the minutes of the previuos meetng,
which were approved without any dis
sension. Mr. C. C. Chanslor was then
elected temnorary secretary.
The report of the Executive Commit
tee was then submitted and approved,
which was followed by the reports of
the President and Secretary and Aud
iting Committee. All of these reports
were full of interest to the company.
The Auditing Committee found the
books and records of the company in
good condition and the $10,000 reserve
fund secured with good mortages. The
amount of insurance in force is $4,448,
650, Net gain during the year is $243.
125. Net gain in company's iinances
durins the year $6,070,73, which was
accumalated from a premiun basis of
80 cents on the $100 in force.
The next business in order was the
election of Manager and Secretary to
fill out the unexpired term of the late
F.F . Hurst. Mr. J. G. Blair, of the
county of Nicholas, placed in nomina
tion the name of Mr. O. E. Hurst, who
since the death of Mr. F. F . Hurst
has been onerating the company's bus
iness. The address of Mr. Blair was
brief. He said as he was one of the
company andwaa made a director at
the time Mr."F. M. Hurst was made
the first General Manager. He called '
the attention to the efforts of Mr. F.
M. Hurst in behalf of the company
when in its infancy, and how he, cave
his life in its behalf. He closed his
eyes in death and assistedjn depositing
his remains in the last resting place.
This was an awful blow to the com
uany. We began to east our eyes about for
his successor and the Executive Com
mitee finally agreed on his brother, Mr.
F. F. Hurst, feeling in selecting him,
we were making no mistake, he Eaid,
This proved true, and Mr. F.;F . Hurst
was thrice elected to the office. The
company jjgrew from a few hundred
thousand to more than four million un
der is management. He assumed the
control of the company at a time when
it was necessary for the companv to
borrow monev onpoor security and he
lived to see the company on a firm and
substantial basis.
Mr. O. E. Hurst, whom be placed in
nomination, is the son of the founder
of the comDany and a nephew of the
late F. F. Hurst. After the death of
Mr. F. F. Hurst, explained Mr. Blair,
the company was confronted by an
other problem, and the Executive
Committee appointed Mr. O.J.R. Hurst
to aqt as Secretary and Manager un
till this meeting. Mr. Hurst is a
young man of ability also an attorney
whose advice along legal points is ab
solutely necessary and the company
could not dobetterkthan elect him to
fill out the unexpired terim. His mo
tiion was briefly seconded an as no
other name was place in nomination,
a call of.the counties was made and
Mr. O. E. Hurst was unanimoush
per year. The motion carried without
opposition. The present committee
was then placed in nomination and re
elected without opposition. They are:

As the committees were not ready to
report at the noon hour the meeting
took a recess until two o'clock , during
which time an elegant dinner was
served by Mrs. Minnie Hurst, who has
served dinners for these annual meet
ings for many years. This was a
feast equal to any in the past, and the
tables groaned with all the good things
of the season. Mrs. Hurst was assist

most prominent of whom was Mrs. W
V. Huffman who has assisted her in so !
many of fhese dimngs and who has
stood so faithfully by her during these

circumstances, though evidence of
grief which she attempted to stifle

How Apes and Monkeys Differ.
What is the difference between apes,
baboons and monkeys? Apes are such
as are destitute of tails; baboons have
muscular bodies, elongated muzzles,
and their tails are usually short; mon
keys are those whose tails are in
general long, some of them, the sapa
gos, having prehensile tails, which can
at pleasure be twisted around any ob
ject, and thereby, in many instances,
answers the purpose of an additional
hand.

Bacteria Not Necessary to Life.
Though bacteria of many kinds live
in most animals, a French experi
menter has disproven the theory that
they are essential to life. It was
claimed that a chicken lived abso
lutely free from miscro-organisms, and
growth and development went on as
usual. ' '
The Lamp of Life.
The comparison of human life to
the burning and going out of a lamp
was familiar with Latin authors, as we
know by the term senes decrepitl. Plu
tarch explains the origin of this meta
phor thus: The ancients never extin
guished their lamps, but suffered them
to go out of their own accord that is,
by the last crackle. Hence a lamp
just about to expire was said decrepi
tare, to cease to crackle. Hence, meta
phorically, persons on the verge of the
grave were called decrepit men.
Dr. Melville Amasa Scovall, 57
years old, dean of the College of Ag
riculture and director oft theKentucky

of the most prominent men in America
in matters of agrculture and bloodfd
live stock, died at 11 :50 o'clock Thurs
day night at his home on the Experi
ment Statiion farm, near Lexington.
Death was due to malignant endo
carditis, an inflamation of the inner
and ! membrane of the heart, often associ
ated with acute rheumatism, oi
which he was stricken two weeks
ago.
Dr. Scovall was born at Belvadiere.
New Jersey, February 26, 1855, a
was later moved to Jasper county,

ized in that yea , and held that office
ever since.
He was made dean of the College of
Agriculture of the State University
more than a year ago.
