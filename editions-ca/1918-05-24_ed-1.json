Methodist church Sunday evening
was in every respect a patriotic one,
full of enthusiasm and determination
to do the right thing. The principal
addresses were delivered by Rev. 0.
B. Crockett, of Shelbyville, and Lieut.
Barkley, of the U. S. Army, at Camp
Taylor, Louisville
At the proper time subscriptions
were called for, and they came rapid
ly. Several of those were given by
children. When the meeting closed
about $3,300 had been raised. On
Monday the soliciting committees got
busy, and the joint precincts were
canvassed in one day. The amount
thus raised up to date, is about $4,
500, and subscriptions are still com
ing. On Saturday afternoon there will
be a sale of calves, pigs, lambs and
other things that might be brought,
i in the Park for the benefit of the
Red Cross. A nice little sum will be
realized. Any purchaser may re
donate his or her purchase to the
Society, and it can be resold. An
interesting time is expected. All we
ask is fair weather and the dollars
will come.
The commencement exercibes of
the M. C. were continued Monday
evening at eight o'clock, at which
time the annual concert was held.
Notwithstanding the heavy down
pour of rain, a good audience was
present at the M. C. Auditorium.
The program was fully up to the av
erage. Most of the numbers were
classical and well executed, and the
encores were numerous. It was a
good concert and enjoyed by all who
heard it.
The commencement exercises were
held Tuesday at 10:30 a. m. at the
M. C. Auditorium. The weather was
good and the audience was large.
At the appointed time the class of
1918, consisting of fourteen young
j ladies, took their places on the stage.
The baccalaureate address was de
livered by Mr. Victor Bradley, of
Georgetown, after which the diplo
mas were awarded by Dr. C. C. Fish
er, president of the college. The hon
or roll was read and medals awarded.
At noon the college closed for the
summer vacation. The next session
will open on Sept. 12. This closes
one of the most successful years in
the history of the school, though
the enrollment was not as large as
in- former years. The high grade
work done by the student body,
through the efficiency of their teach
ers, was equal to any year of the
past. There will be several faculty
changes next year.

the M. M. I. Commencement exercises,
