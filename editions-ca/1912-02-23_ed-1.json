THEATRICAL.
"A PAIR OF COUNTRY KIDS.".
The pair of kids at the Paris Grand
next Monday from all reports are a
lively pair and are ably managed and
assisted by a competent company '.of
laJies and gentlemen, as are all such
high class companies presenting rural
comedies. These companies should not
be confounded with the coarse and
vulgar farmer plays that have been
tDuring the country for years and
whose principal merit is a noisy brass
band. The later day rural play is a
pleasing homespun affair presented by
a cast of intelligent people and fram
ed in a natural rural atmosphere such
as we have all at some time in our
lives been familiar with. "A Pair of
Country Kids" is of the later class
and will please the old and young and
is a real novelty in many respects and
we can assure the patrons of the Grand
that they will surely get their money's
worth in watching the action of the
kids for two hours and a half.
At Work on Theatre Building.
Work on the Colonial Theatre at the
corner of Fifth and Main street, upon
which the contractors began last Mon
day is progressing rapidly in spite of
the extreme cold weather. The entire
front of the bulding, which will be re
placed with a modern front patterned
after those of the larger sities, has
been removed and the partition which
separated the laundry office from the
remainder of the building, has been re
moved. Weather permitting the con
tractor? will push the work to an ear
ly completion and expect to have
everything in readiness to turn the
building over to the Colonial Amuse
ment Co. by the fifteenth of April.

Hot Shot at CantrilL
Denouncing Congressman Campbell
Cantrill as a "demagogue," whose
every allegation as to him is "aoo
lutelv false" Representative Harry
Schoberth, of Woodford county, candi
date against Cantrill f6r the Demo
cratic Congressional nomination, Tues
day night issued a vigorous repsonse
to the card given out st Washington
by Cantrill, charging him, Schoberth,
with bad faith in getting into the race
at. this time.
In return, Schoberth charges Can
trill with the things which he decries,
tells him that he won't let him run
away from the Record he has made
here in Kentucky, and urges hat the
sole issue between them is and shall be
i iiiv.il tv u i inuoii iLuij icpLcacuv nit;
people of the Ashalnd District in Con

a promise to Cantrill to keep out "cf
the race.
Skovgaard Concert.
Of the Skovgaard concert, which
will be given at the High School Audi
torium on Tuesday evening, February
27, the St. Paul, Minn., Pioneer Press
has the following :
"Seldom is a St. PfuI audience
aroused to that pitch of enthuiasra that
it refused to be satisfied after the last
number of an already ample program
has been given, and insists upon hav
ing a last leavetakmg from the artist,
or artists, that have brought on the
spell. Buc that is what happened last
evening at the Central Prebstyerian
church at the concert given by Skov
gaard and his concert company.
"At the conclusion of Pizzicato
Grazloso, a piece written by himself,
which was the last of his final group,
Skovgaard was compelled to reappear
several times upon the platform. The
applause continued, and finally, when
some one in the balcony called out
"Home Sweet Home," those in the
audience who had already filed out in
to the aisles and returned as one per
son and the violinist was obliged to
give one last number.
"Skovgaard has made a happy selec
tion in his associates. All his numbers
were repeatedly encored, but none
won more applause than the simple
melody of "Way Down Upon the
Suanee River." which was given as an
encore after "Gypsy Life," by
Sarasate."
Meet Foreign Missionaries.
A very interesting meeting was held
Tuesday evening at the home of Mr.
and Mrs. J. T. Hinton on High street.
A number of ladies and gentlemen
were invited to meet Rev. A. E. Corey
and Dr. Royal J. -Dye, returned mis
sionaries from the foreign field, and
Mr. Davis Teachout, a young buisness
man of Cleveland, O. The object of
the meeting was to hear the plans of
the two able missionaries which are
being submitted to the Chritsian
churches in many cities by which they
entertain the hope of raising one mil
lion dollars with .which it is their in
tention to build and equip a hospital
and school in connection with every
mission station in the foreign field
which are supported by the Christian
church. The gentlemen were extended
an invitation by the Mission Councii
to return to this cit' and deliver their
talk at the Christian church this even
ing. The misisonaries accpeted the invi
tation and the meeting will be held at
the Christian church this evening. It
promises to be of a great interest and
all, interetsed in the work should at
tend. There will be no collection
taken.
