Simon Bolivar Buckner, firstcitizen of Kentucky, is dead.He was a veteran of the Mexicanand Civil Wars, and the highestranking officer of the survivors of theCivil War of either army. He wasborn April 1, 1823, at Glen Lily, Hartcounty, Ky., where he died at nineo'clock Thursday night.The house in which Gen. Bucknerwas born was built by his father in180.4.Gen. Buckner died at his home,Glen. Lilyt in Hart county, a few milesout from Munfordville. He appearedto break all at once and died of theweight of his ninety years after acritical illness of only a few days.With him when he died were hiswife; his son, Lieut. Simon BolivarBuckner, Jr., and his wife's sister,Miss Louise Claibourne. He hadnot been away from home for sometime, but had remained active andclieerful, .and was up and about thehouse until the first part of the week.His son, Lieut. Buckner, who isstationed ,at the United States Armypost at Port Thomas, Ky., had;, beenat home for Christmas, and returnedto his post when his father's rapidfailure summoned him home" again.The veteran retained consciousness until within a few hours of hisdeath. IThe attending physician, Dr.J. A. Adams, of Munfordville, attributes death to a general breakingdown, complicated with no acute condition other xthan those produced bythe weaknesses of age.Gen. Buckner died in th same housein which he was born on April 1, 1823,an unpretentious log structure inwhich he lived the greater part of hislife with the utmost simplicity. JThe large farm in late years hadbeen managed by Mrs. Buckner, whowas Miss Delia Claibourne, of Richmond, Va., and whom he married in1886. In previous years, however,when Gen. Buckner conducted theplace, he worked day by day in thefields with his hands.His body was buried in the StateCemetery at Frankfort, Saturday,where rest numbers of other Governors of Kentucky. A special Louisville and Nashville train bore thebody from Munfordville to the capital on Saturday. Confederate veterans' organizations had charge of thefuneral.Gen. Buckner was the last of theLieutenant-Generals of the Confederate army. He was the son of Ayelette H. Buckner and Elizabeth Annj&orhead Buckner. His father wasamong the Kentucky volunteers who,under Gen. William Henry HarriBon,fobght the battle of the Thames.After attending the best schools ofthe day he received an appointmentto West Point from CongressmanWilliam Triplett in June, 1840; wasgraduated from that institution fouryears later, and entered the army asa brevet Second Lieutenant in theSixth United States Infantry.Two years later he was with thearmy in Mexico, participating in thej seige of Vera Cruz and the battles ofcerro uordo, san Antonio, cnerubusco, Molina Del Rey, Chapultepec,Carita del Bela and in the capture ofthe City of Mexico. He .was woundedat Cherubusco and breveted FirstLieutenant for gallantry in that bat,tle,, and subsequently received thebrevet rank of Captain.Retiring from the army in 1860, hei returned to Kentucky, and at the beginning of the war betweea the Stateswas Inspector-General -fof the Kentucky State Guard. President Lincoin tendered him an appointment asBrigadier-General, which he declined.In September, 1861, he entered theConfederate army, receivingt atonce a commission as" Brigadier-General.He was thirG in cpmmand atFort Donaldson, and when GeneralsFloyd and Pillow abandoned theircommands to avoid capture, GeneralBuckner refused to desert his comrades. On thelast day's battle ofthat memorable conflict, an effort wasmade to force the Union army backto allow the Confederates to escape.General Buckner with his brigadefought valiantly throughout the dayand at nightfall had succeeded indriving the enemy back a sufficientdistance to allow Floyd and Pillow toadvance their troops across the openfield to escape. Then came an orderfrom the officer in command to retreat' to the fortifications.
