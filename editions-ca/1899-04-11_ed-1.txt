his own resources afterstating his case to one Houthwick a shipmaster is shipped as second mate on theIndustry bound for Havana Mr Tymthe supercargo descries a sail The strangevessel gives chase but is disabled by theIndustrys guns In the fray Capt Houthkick and one of the crew are killed Aftera consultation below Mr Tym and themate return to the deckCHAPTER III ContinuedThey first devoted their attention fora brief space to the Dutchman whowas still by littles falling behindthough he had at lat set some mannerof fore topsail and eontinuedly doggedly to follow us and when this scrutiny was ended they walked over towhere I was standingWell Master Ardick began MrJTym doubtless you and the crewwould by this time relish some information as to the future business of thevoyage Master Sellinger and I havetaken counsel together and thinkplease God to go presently on with itVVe shall stand forthwith into Sidmonth where we hope to procure a firstmate which done with Master Sellinger raised to be captain we shallstraightway fetch our course again forHavanaOf course my opinion was not soughtbut merely my curiosity was vouchsafed to be satisfied so I only bowediid saixLihatthe decision would pleasethe forecastle as it did me and withthat I withdrew and went forwardAfter a time the Industrys course-was changed and she was laid withher nose almost due rorth and this sheheld as the Devonshire coast gradually rose and cut a learer outline Bythis time poor Hans Buttcrbox had become discouraged and given up thechaseI was beginning to be surprised thatjiothing had been done touching thedisposal of the bodies of the captainand Dingsby which were still extended on the quarter deck covered withthe tarpaulins but I was now to understand the reason of the delay andapparent neglect Master or I mustnow say Captain Sellinger presentlycame to the confines of the quarterdeck and having called us before himtold us that it was Capt Houthwicksoft expressed desire tc be buried in theea which desire he said fee had determined to comply with As Dingsoy was an old sailor and was notknown to have any family it was theopinion of Mr Tym and himself thatit would be well and fitting to let hisbody accompany his eld captains Norre raised any opposition to this orindeed struck in with a word and sothe sea burial for both these bravemariners was settled upon We sewedthe two bodies up in their canvasshrouds heavy weights were placed attheir feet and they were balanced onplanks across the bulwark All uncovered and Mr Tym read a prayerAs a rough voice or iwo joined in theamen Capt Sellinger gave the signaland the bodies were shot into thewater The splashing they made waslost in the racing by of the next seaand we solemnly irew in the bareplanks and the doleful business wasoverAVe ran into Sidmouth withouttrouble or delay and when the anchorwas cast Capt Sellinger ordered thecig and was pulled ashore He didiiot return till morning and thenfetched with him a stranger whomhe presently declared to us as thenew mate I immediately fell intotome wonderment at the looks of thisman He was tall taller by an inchtnan I round backed gaunt and marvelously old looking in the face thoughhe could not have been above five-and-thirtyHis hair was jet black andcoarse and there was scarce a threadthat his countenanceof gray in it despitetenance was so wornI could hardly conceive why CaptSellinger should choose such a manfor it seemed to me that he must beharsh and of an ill temper which thecaptain was not and had never seemedlo approve of It soon came out thatthe port was almost bare of good seamen as some were gone in the newfleet of the kings and others hadshipped in the many vessels bound forAmerica so that a choice of matesas the case stood must needs be passing narrowWe soun made sail and after a timeTHE BOURBON NEWS PAR1A KY TUESDAY APEIL 11 1899worked out from the coast and fetchedour bows once more to the west Yekept a slirp lookout for suspiciouscraft but saw no signs of any andat last began to think that our badlock was over and that we might nowbe speeded by good fortune havingbegun so illCHAPTER IVOF THE MOVING TALK OF THEYOUNG SAILOR AND THE STRANGEBEHAVIOR OF AN OLD ONEIn reasonable time we cleared thechannel and began to climb the longAtlantic swells We saw nothing moreof the Dui i hman and little apprehended any further alarms from him ashe must by this time have consultedprudence and taken himself oat ofthese waters We had repaired thelittle damage he had done to our sparsand rigging and thus as we finallymade the open sea we seemed in goodcase to go blithely on with the voyageSeveral days now passed duringwhich we had favorable winds and theIndustry made very good progressOne morning being sent on some matter to the hold I heard running aboutand shouting on deck and on callingup to learn the cause was told that alarge ship was in sightShes a fast craft by the way weare raising her said the fellow whowas speaking and the captain is in ahurry to bring her into his glass lieis half way up the weather shrouda goggling away as though for hislifeI dropped what I was doing andclimbed nastily out of the hatchI was up the main shrouds at oncethe captain and Master Pradey beingin the fore and when 1 had well clearedthe deck I stopped and took a longlookThe stranger was in the southwestern seaboard hull down and with onlvhis topsails and the upper part of hiscourses showing and at the momentwas standing on the starboard tackThis brought him well forward of ourlee beam as we were on the larboardtack and headed somewhat south ofsouthwest He was rising rapidly ashis swift whitening and enlargingshowed and at this rate would be hullup and distinct in the course of a fewminutesOf a sudden the captain lowered hiaglass and said something to the mateI did not catch what it was but MasterPradey gave a nod as though of satisfaction and at once swung down tothe deckRun up the colors he shoutedflourishing back the knot of men whopresenthr drew about himA sailor sprang away and in a fewseconds the flag was mounting aloftWhile this was doing I saw Mr Tym descend from the mizzen rigging histelescope strapped on his back andguessed from his easy mien that hetoo was satisfied with the looks of thestrangerAfter a little Capt Sellinger shut uphis glass and descended to the deckand upon espying me called me to himand ordered me to put the Industry ina posture for defense Yon ship fliesthe English flag he said but she maybe an enemy for all that and we willnot be caught nappingShe drew gradually nearer and soonwith the naked eye we could make outthe design upon her flag It was StGeorges Cross as we had suspectedand moreover we could now read English build and rig in a score of littlepeculiarities discernible at least to asailors eye She was a handsomecraft not too narrow in the beam yetshapely and with a perfect cloud ofwhite well fitted canvas on her tallsparsWhen we were less than half a mileapart the stranger began to luff edging along only with a small way andso crept within a quarter of a milewhen he clewed up some of his sailsand came squarely into the wind Thetwo ships now la head and head rising and falling gently with the swellOur captain took his trumpet and atall dark bearded man coming to therail of the other ship also with atrumpet the hailing beganShip ahoy bellowed the other captain What ship is thatThe Industry Sellinger masterreturned our skipperWhere bound came from theother trumpetHavanaThis is the Happy Bess Capt Torrycorn announced the skipper of theother ship after a little pause Weare from New York for London Willyou take a letter for usAye aye bellowed our captainbackAt once there was a stir on the deckof the other ship and in a fewr moments a boat dangled down from thedavits the captain and two sailors inher and dropped with a neat splashinto the waterPut over the gangway ladder saidCnpt Sellinger which we did and theother captain was soon with usAfter passing a word or two of theusual sort that is concerning theirrespective ships ports and so onthey came to the business in hand andCapt Torrycorn produced his letterIt is for Mr Jeremiah Hope of Havana he said a gentleman that youvery likely know By some goingastray it was put aboard my ship andbut for you must have taken a longtack before it was deliveredI will cheerfully relieve vou of itanswered Capt Sellinger I do notknow Mr Hope but have heard of himand understand that he is a gentlemanof worth and consequence Hut stepinto my cabin now and let us have adrop as we say to sweeten the bilgeAfter that we will go into mattersmore at largeBefore Capt Sellinger closed thedoor he ordered me to summon MasterPradey who was on the after part ofthe poop and likewise to have aboardthe two sailors that were till nowkeeping the gig I ventured to ask ifwe might not for the ships sakebroach a cask of ale and was kindlyanswered in the affirmative whereupon I hastened to execute both commandsMaster Pradey wasnever a sociableman but I suppose he conceived thatthe captains wish was well enough toregard wherefore with a cold nod tome he repaired to the cabinI made known the captains good nature to the men by whom it was received with great favor and they werenot slow in having the two tars outof the boat Then having fetched upthe ale all proceeded to set off theirpipes and gather round for the newsI took my own stand near by a bitoutside the circle but within hearingBoth the visitors judged at a glancewere ordinary English sailors brownbluff and sturdy with jaw tackledoubtless on an easv run once thebowl had passed They gave us a briefaccount of their ship grow led over theprovisions which it seems were of aparticularly wretched sort and in turnfell to questioning us We gave themthe home news and added some spiceat the end by an account of our brushwith the Dutchman This brought outa livel3 round of talk the purport ofwhich was that the Dutch had wondrous assurance but for a fair fightwith even metal were naught besidethe English When this had passedsome one brought up the doings ofour ships abroad and notably in piratical waters and from here we naturally fell to talking of the buccaneersNay mates said the younger ofthe two sailors I think I can say aword here that shall put a little tingleinto your blood I trow every jack ofyou has heard of Henry MorganAy ay cried near all our fellowstogether The great freebooteradded severalthere mates and hear mesaid the sailor flourishing his pipe forsilence Hast heard what CaptMorgan is now aboutNo no cried the crewWell mates it is the greatest thingconceived by English sailors since thedays of Drake Naught less than thetaking of PanamaOur men broke out in a hearty note ofapplauseStay a moment I struck in at thispoint and speaking with aiPvHe thrust a bit of paper into my banding air I think but little of this news1 of yours What have the Spaniardsdone to us that we should deal withthem in such a fashion To my thinking it is no better than rank piracyYet it has the warrant of the kingelse report is a liar said the sailorbriskljNay said I coldly I must needshave proof of that I cannot think hismajesty would consent to such ill doingBesides England and Spain are atpeace and this would surely involvethem in warWell Master Ardick you take meout of soundings there said the sailorwith a laugh I must stick to myfactb for facts I still think they beand let such deep matters gonay said I for nowI began to fear the influence of suchtalk on the men this is all an ill business Morgan and his fellows are butprates letters of commission or noand it will be a wonder if they do notend their days on the gallows which atleast they deserveBut here some grumbling arose fromour fellows Vast Master Ardickbrace not so sharp tip said one Acommission from the king is deep water enough for me said a secondWho would be nice of a Spaniardsaid a third And so the murmur wentaroundNay then listen an you will Isaid with some disgust Little goodwill it do you unless you mean to joinMorgan yourselves and that I conceive you can scarce do at presentWith this I withdrew a bit into thebackground yet not so far I must ad77iit but I could hear the further talkPanama taker pursued the sailorwho was now quite at his ease andflourished his pipe in an importantstyle there wil be some small jollityfor poor Jack Not less than a monthin the city I will be bound and no manoverhauled for steering- his owncourse You shall conceive me mateswhat that may mean Bare womenI am told there be in Panama and notleast a considerable nutmery Besidesthere are the old wines and the noblepieces of eightOur foolish fellows must break outagain in applauseBy this time I had fully resolved thatthe fellow was but a windy forecastleorator and harmless of himself so hedid not lead away men of weaker understanding Our crew continued toquestion him and he related more doings of Morgan and so they went ontill the matter was as I conceivedtalked out We had a little discourseof other things and presently the twocaptains came vp from below and ourvisitors knocked the ashes from theirpipes and hied them to their boat Theother captain gone we got the clothsupon the ship and shortly she wasdrawing away on her courseMatters on the Industry now wenton as before and except that we hadmore Morgan talk and a little mooning and sighing from some of the menthere was nothing to disturb the former monotonyOne evening being newly come outto take charge of my watch I lightedmy pipe and sauntered off leisurely tothe poop meaning to take a look atour course I had proceeded as far asthe ladder and I think even had onefoot upon it when I heard my namesharply yet stealthily called I haltedin some surprise and found that thespeaker was old Jack LewsonSt Master Ardick he said shuffling up hurriedly Belay jaw ackleand stow this away Overhaul it whennobody is lookingHe thrust a bit of paper into

theexperiment and sauntered down tothe cow lot with her milk pail Allher endeavors though were futileThe cow absolutely refused to allowthe milkmaid to come near herFinally in desperation the determined young lady went back to thehouse and after some trouble and exertion that might have combined withher maidenly decorum to call thebeautiful color to her cheeks she reappeared clad in coat

Hex Blake Til Ippiri Gardens South KensingtonII rb i Streuth artist received anappointment for J30 on Wednesdayafternoon He called at the Southaddress and was shown intoa eooly furnished library where apodgy little old gentleman with whitelutir shook him warmly by the hand andbade him to be seatedI am very pleased to see you MrStreuth and I trut that I may be ofsome service to you in fact that wemay be of service to each other liut1 must begin by asking you a plainquestion which you will answer truthfully and in one word Is your intendedsuicide connected in any way with severe poverty or overwhelming financiallosses ITXo said Streuth I am consideredI believe to be fairly well offDelighted to hear it said Mr Blakerubbing his chubby hands togetherNow we will proceed I tell you frankly that with me this thing is a business and nothing but a business Ifyou decide that I can serve you 1 shallexpeel a modi rate fee Now what arethe principal objections to MiicideVThe law does not permit it saidStreuthPrecisely but in the case of the suce ssful suicide the law is not asked Itbars that vou mav not take vour lifeaway but if you do it cannot compelyou to take it back again or punishvou in any way We can leave the lawoutThere i also the religious objection said StreuthMany very religious people repliedMr Blake have roi found it cogentTake the case by no means an uncommon one where the death of one manmay be an inestimable benefit to manyto whom he is really sincerely attachedIs an act of self sacrifice to be regarded as a crime No it seems to me thateach suicide must be judged on its ownmerits taking into consideration themotives and beliefs of the person suiciding Any other objections1 know of none Streuth answeredin fact 1 have not been thinking muchabout it 1 want to get out of things1 dont ask myself if there are any objections or not I dont earc if there areanv objectionsYou surprise me said Mr Blake3ou are an artist and yet it has notoccured to you that the manner of thesuicide is of essential importance Thetkroat cuitihg is very dirty and thesame objection applies to the tise offirearms Have a little foresight imagine what you look like afterwardsand the state of the bedclothes and allthe rest of it1 was intending said Streuth todrown ni selfI have In re said Mr Blake a littlework on forensic medicine There arcsome interesting chapters on the signsby which you can tell the length oftime the hedy has been in the waterDill you i ver hear of adipocer Thereis an elegant little description of it inthis passage Just read itStreuth took it and read a few linesI cant stand this he said It is tooMnauseousI thought yon would see it in thatlight Mr Blake replied people mostly do when I put it to them You really cant tell what a rivers oingr to doto you It may give you back at onceor it may keep you for u bit Evenif it gives you back at once yen dontlook pretty Here is r description ofthe face of a man taken out of theThames onYou neednt go on with that I havegiven up the idea of drowning myselfrThere in stilj poison A little prusticacid and The bother is all overExcellent said Mr Blake IT youknow the right dose you die almost immediately but youve

three handedtheir tickets to the night porterAnd did the three commit suicideNo They came put again Not oneof them has committed suicide or everwill You wont for instanceXo said Streuth common sensehas dawned After all he mutteredshe is not the only girl in the worldMany of my clients said Blakesmilingly give me some little presentsome trifling souvenir on their returnStreuth put his hand into his waistcoat pocket As he fumbled with thecoins he said Suppose that one ofthose three who did give up his ticketto the porter had committed suicideyou would have stood a fair chance ofgetting
