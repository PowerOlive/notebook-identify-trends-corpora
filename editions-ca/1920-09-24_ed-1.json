Tuesday, for their farm, one mile
south of town. She was busy gath
ering apples, getting out fruit jars
and doing other things about the
place. About 3 30 she complained
of not feeling well, and said she
would go up stairs and lay down for
a while, while Mr. Dimmett was
out on the farm to look after other
business He returned about 5:4?
to the house and on going to the
