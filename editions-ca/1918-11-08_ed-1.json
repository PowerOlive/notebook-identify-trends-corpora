RED CROSS AND THE DIS

SAILOR.
IMMHIHIIIIIMMMIIIIllHllllllltllllllllllMlltfc

What is the Red Cross part in the
big national programfor the recon
struction of disabled soldiers and
sailors? With large casualty lists
reported daily and many disabled
men now returning from the Euro
pean fronts, the question is being
asked on all sides by interested
Americans.
A new Red Cross circular of in
struction, entitled "Home Service
and the Disabled Soldier and Sailor,"
summarizes the Red Cross relation
ship to the rehabilitation program as
follows:
1 To bring solidly behind the
disabled man, at all stages of the re
construction process, the moral sup
port of his family.
2 To assist the men, through the
competent legal advice at the com
mand of chapter Home Service Sec
tions, to secure the benefits- of the
War Risk Insurance Law and especi
ally the provisions for compensation
and insurance. 3 -
3 To urge upon disabled men the
wisdom and necessity of taking full
advantage of the government's-plans
for their care and training.
4 To encourage them in the early
and critical stages of their vocational
training and of their return to em
ployment, when the struggle to over
come the (mental and physical handi
cap is most acute.
5 To bring about a reasonable and
sympathetic attitude on the part of
employers, "which shall give every
handicapped man a real chance, while
avoiding the danger of tempting him
to forego the necessary training for
the attention of an immediate, tempo
rary or perhaps unsuitable jo"b.
6 To (mold public opinion so that
it will frown upon trivial and de
moralizing entertainment and hero
worship, and maintain a constructive
atttitude, while maintaining a
square deal for the returned Tsoldier
shall expect from him every reasona
ble effort to insure his self-support.
7 To supply information, encour
agement, legal, medical and business
advice, when accpe table and neces-j
sary, jus't as is being done for- the
families of men at the front.
A pretentious program, it is true,
especially when it is taken into con
sideration that, on the basis of Can
ada's experience, 100,000 of each 1,
000,000 men will come back each
year permanently incapacitated for
military duty.
But the American Red Cross, with
its great financial resources, its 22,
000,000 members, its 3,900 chapters
and their 15,000 branches, is better
equipped than any other private or
ganization to give aid and comfort to
our soldiers and sailors and to assist
their families at home. It approaches
the position of a "committee of the
whole of the American people."
And it will be noted from the above
that the Red Cross is purely an aux
iliary factor, recognizing that the
medical departments of the Army and
Navy are wholly responsible for the
physical and mental x reconstruction
and that the total responsibility, by
act of Congress, for the civil re-establishment
rests entirely upon the Fed
eral Board for Vocational Education.
If the Home Service work now be
ing done by chapters for the relatives
of fighting men may be accepted as a
criterion of what may be expected
from the Red Cross in the reconstruc
tion work, then the disabled man
will again find in that institution a
trusted, valuable helpmate.

Owners of first Liberty Bonds con

bearing four per cent, who wisli to
excha-nge them for bonds bearing 44
per cent. must do so before next Sat
urday, Novembqr 9, "when the con

This can be done without cost at any
bank and the only effect is to give
the bond holder an extra quarter o'f
a per cent- interest which amounts
to 25 cents a year on each $100 bond.
Third loan bonds are not to be con
verted because they already bear 44
per cent.

that only a week remains in the con
