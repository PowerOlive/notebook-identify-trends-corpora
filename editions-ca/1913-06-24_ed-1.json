Catarrhal fever or "black tongue," a
disease which has been raging among
horses of adjoining counties has bro
ken out in Bourbon and seems to 'have
assumed the proportions of an epi
demic. Miss Frances Champ yesterday lost
a valuable Shetland pony which was
stricken with the disease last Friday
and Mr. W. W. Titus, the well-known
trotting: horse trainer, lost three valu-
ble animals last week as a result of the
disease.
A valuable carriage horse beionging
to Mr. J. T. Hinton was stricken with
the disease only a few days ago, died
Sunday and there are a large number
of cases among horses that have been
reported.
Mr. M. J. Murphy also lost a very
valuable mare last week as a result of
the disease. H . Margolen lost one
and W. G. Talbott two last week.
Veterinarians seem unable to cope
with the situation owing to the nature
of the disease, which is exceedingly
malignant and contagious. It prevails
in several of. tne adjoining counties
and in many cities livery stables have
been placed in quarantine. The mat
ter has been called to the attention of
the State Department of Agriculture
and Commissioner Newman issued an
order to all liverymen in an effort to
check the spread.
