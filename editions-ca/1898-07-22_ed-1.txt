guns and ordnance stores whichhave come into the possession of thisgovernment through the surrender ofSantiago Gen Shafter reports thatabout 7000 Mauser rifles were turnedover the first day and the number willreach probably 20000 when the troopsat other points in the surrenderedzone turn in their guns The reportsmade before the surrender indicatedthat the Mausers handled by the Spanish troops were not in very good condition The guns were all right whenfurnished but the poor care they received principally from volunteersleft many of them rusty and defective Ordnance officials believehowever that the greater part ofthe guns can be put in firstclass order The Mauser has a caliberof seven milhmeteres or 2 of aninch while the American gun has acaliber of 3 of an inch This difference in caliber makes it impossible touse American ammunition in the captured guns The surrender also coversa large stock of ammunition rifleballs etc of the caliber suitable forthe Mausers so that when the gunsare repaired there will beample stock of cartridges touse in them The ordnancebureau is considering only what shallbe done with the guns if they are utilized by this government as it hasnothing to do with the larger questionconcerning the ultimate return of theguns to the Spanish troops This is ageneral question of governmental policy but it appears to be pretty wellsettled that the guns will not be returned to Spaniards at least until thewar Is overThe ordnance officers expect to makevery little use of the old fortificationguns mounted in Morro castle Socapa- Cayo Smith and other forts

Did NotLeave Siboney Monday as Intended- Owinjj to a Serious Friction Between American and Cnban Troops Practically AUof Gen Shafters Army Will Be Retained at Santiago do CubaWAsniXQTO July 20 Because of afailure on the part of Gen Miles tothe orders the president prepared late Monday to take commandof the military expedition ag ainstPorto Rico that officer did not depart-as was expected from Sihoney Themistake was soon corrected Tuesdaymorning- however and as a result ofsome short telegraphic correspondencethat followed during- the day it wasjrathered at the department that theYale started Tuesday night Contralto the first intention and probablywithout Gen Miles seeking- the Yale islo be convoyed by a naval vessel thatAdm Sampson has been instructed toselect from among- the vessels of hisfleet This may result in delajingGen Miles progress somewhat asnone of the vessels with Sampson isable to keep pace with the YaleNevertheless there is no doubt that thegeneral -will reach Porto Rico before-the detachment of troops from CharlestonWar department officials feel thatthey are fully justified in their decision to retain practically all ofters army at Santiago by the pressreports that reached them Tuesday indicating-the growth of serious frictionbetween the American forces and Cuban troops growing- out of the lattersexclusion from Santiago by Gen Shaflers orders It is felt now that thegarrison originally proposed two immune regiments would have been quiteinsufficient to meet an outside Spanishforce that might come from Holguicor Manzanillo and also to restrain therapacity of the Cubans It is realizedthat the present situation is full odifficulty and the future is dark owingto the disposition evidenced by thcCubans to ig nore or refuse to bebound by the amenities of modern warfare This first symptom of friction has suggestedto the officials innumerable difficulties that will arise in thefuture Of course it would seem to beonly polite now to avoid any open rupture with the Cubans provided theycan be kept in leash and not involvethe United States in the digraces thatwould follow the sacking of helplesscommunities but it begins to appearthat for some time to come and evenk after the conquest of Cuba is completethe United States must maintain therea military government in order tomeet the responsibilities which it hasassumed to the civilized worldThe personnel of the Porto Ricanexpedition having been left in a largemeasure in the hands of Gen Brookeit is not possible yet to give an accurate roster of the organizations thatwill enter into itAdm Sampson has received final orders from the navy department as tothe part the American fleet is to takein the campaig n against Porto RicoThey are based on the view that thecampaign is

and by covering the landingof troops As there is no Spanishfleet in San Juan harbor or other PortoRican ports the navy has a limitedfield of operation The reduction ofthe harbor fortifications will be themain work but this and all other operations of the fleet will be supplemental to the main operations conducted by the army The strategistsmilitary and naval are acrreed in theview that the taking of Porto Rico inprimarily a undertaking andAdm Sampsons orders are on thesslinesThe nav3 department is rapidlymoving the large fleet of auxiliarcraft made up of merchant shipslarge ocean going yachts

Gaines-Copyright ISM JWAS just 11 jcars old when -weI moved to Granite Falls and Ithought it the most wonderful place Ihad ever seen And it is a wonderfulplace though since I have grown olderI have sometimes doubted whether itwas any part of the plan of creationthat people should live there ForGranite Falls is n mere rift throughthe mountains Avith a swift foamingriver tumbling- down the middle of itOn each side the rocky hills rise up sosteep that you seem to see the skythrough a long slit just a when youlook up between the tall buildings ofa city street nd there isnt muchmore earth in sight either than yousee in the paved streets of the cityThe road that follows the river bankruns along bare ledges for the mostpart and the rootfi of the scragglystunted trees sprawl out over therocks like claws with only a thin skimof soil tojyrip in The winters aresomething terrible for the snowsgather in the narrow valley tmtil thebig drifts cut across the second storvwindows and you have to make a tunnel to get to the weli and another toget to the barn Sometimes for awhole week you cant roach the storeor the post oflice or the house of yournearest neighbor Indeed the onlyreason why anybody eer does try tolive at Granite Falls is because of thesplendid water power and the greatlog drives that are floated down theriver from the vast forests above tobe sawed into planks and boards in themills The dismal scream of the sawsis always heard there and the air isfull of the sweet peculiar smell of themoist fresh cut lumber except ofcourse in the dead of winter andreally in summer it isnt so bad especially for a boy who doesnt haveto break his back and risk life andlimb struggling with the wet heavylogs and feeding them to rise ravenousteeth of the saws Anjdiow founda deal to interest me all day longthrough all the summer months andso did Bessie my sisterFathers mill dam ran across fromthe shore to a long narrow islandthat split the torrent like a flintywedge and just below the dam thechannel was almost for the water that came through the sluice wasonly enough to make a sort of brookcascading down the bare bed ofsmooth black rock here and therespreading in shallow pools and finallyjoining the main body of the river below the island It was the best sport Ihad ever known to wade about in thewarm water setting up toy millwheels whittled out of pine where thestream leaped and spouted and feeuing and herding the shoals of dartingminnows in the miniature ponds Itwas great fun too sealing the cliffsand climbing about on the mountainsand it was on one of these break neckTHE BOUKBON NEWS PARIS KY FRIDAY JULY 22 1898excursions that I discovered JaspercaveI dont mean that I was the first whoever visited the place tho gh T doubtthat any white man knew of it at thattime I found il by the merest accident for Its mouth is about half wayup the side of a precipitous mountainalmost as steep as the side of a houseand no opening is visible from belowIt can only be reached from the forestabove by a zig zag track along theface of the cliff a path scarcely sixinches wide in some places so that onehas to lean against the rock to keephis balance In front of the cavehowever there is a flat shelf severalyards in breadth commanding a beautiful view of the valley beneath theriver looking like a mere trout brookin the distance the logs in it like littlesticks and the mill like a playthingthat a boy might -work with a crankThe entrance of the cave is so low thatI had to crawl in on my hands andknees Inside it is about as big as anordinary room and in the middle justhigh enough to let a boy stand erectthe roof sloping down toward theedges But the most remarkable thingabout it is that roof and walls andfloor are all of jasper beautifully mottled in red and yellow There is littledoubt that it had been gradualty hollowed out by the Indians in ages pastas they continually chipped away atthis vein of bright hued jasper toget its hard sharp edged flakes fortheir arrow heads Indeed I foundseveral of these and other stone implements by pawing over a heap offlint scales which laj in one cornerand subsequently it was made plainthat the secret of the place once sovaluable to the savage warriors wasstill carefully guarded with a sort ofsuperstitious reverence by the degenerate remnants of the tribeWhen I told Bessie about this fascinating spot she

if the crop is a goodone and prices are low they can beused to good advantage in feedingstock In milking cows better results can be secured by sowing a littleearlier as the plants are able to receive a much better start to grow before hot dry weather starts in Oftenwhen the seeding is delayed untilthe latter part of July the soil is dryand the weather hot conditions areunfavorable to plant growth andthough the seed may germinate thegrowth will be very unsatisfactoryNew ground is considered best forthis crop if it can be prepared in agood tilth in good season In order tohelp to retain moisture it is best toplow reasonably deep and then harrow or drag until in a fine tilth Itpays to take time to have the soil thoroughly worked The seed is very smalland unless the soil is in a good tilththe seed will not germinate and especially so if there is a lack of moistureWhen the soil is dry rolling will oftenbe found beneficial Care must betaken in sowing the seed to scatteras evenly as possible

caught in this wayare cut worm moths the clickingbeetle which is the mature form ofthe wire worm and the May beetlewhich is the mature form of the whitegrub When these insects became especially abundant this method ofcatching them is worthy of trial Theobjections to it are 1 that it is thelarvae and not the flying form of theseinsects that do serious injury 2few persons are so far sighted thatthey can be persuaded to attack insect enemies until they are sufferingfrom their ravages and the benefits ofthis method will not be felt until perhaps the following year 3 the observations of Dr Otto Lugger showthat Insects have generally laid theiregss before they fly much and onlythe male insects of some species flyand the females are nearly or quitewingless It is obvious that in somecases

Greatest of Allthe Fraudulent AutomatonsThere are few things more attractiveto the generality of men or more calculated to excite their wonder and admiration than a dexterously and mysteriouslycontrived automaton There is indeedsomething almost uncanny in the sightof a figure made by mens hands actinglike a creature of flesh and blood andthis uncanniness is one of the most suhtle of fascinations Hence the silver althe curious readily finds its way intothe pockets of men ingenious enough oinvent such marvelsThis passion for the automaton is certainly no new thing One meets it inalmost the earliest books sometimeveiled in myth sometimes more directly stated Vulcan it will be remenrbered made automatic tripods for thegods of Olympua stools which adof their own accord to the banqueting table and so retired when thefeast was overAristotle tells us that the human automata which Daedalus made were soactive that it was necessary to keepthem tethered for fear they would runaway The same philosopher describesa wooden Venus who walked about andgives also the secret of the phenomenonShe was filled with quicksilver a somewhat crude device Albertus Magnus iscredited with having made a brazenman who talked and St Thomas Aquinas with having pounded it to pieceswith a club suspecting it to be a workof satan Some marvelous feats ofmechanism are credited to John Mullerotherwise known as Kegiomontanuswho flourished in the fifteenth centuryand in dealing with him we perhapstouch firmer ground One was an ironfly which flew around a table anothera wooden eagle which went out to meetEmperor Maximilian on his entry ofNuremberg on June 7 1470 and returned with him to the city gatesWhether due or not to the stimulusgiven by Louis XIV the seventeenthand eighteenth centuries were in Francetimes of great automatic activity Indeed the first named century marks thebeginning of the really bistagfcal era ofautomata In the eighteenth centurjlived Mr Vaucauson perhaps the mostwonderful of all makers of automataand the creator of the famous duckwhich first appeared before the publicin 1741 The duck was Vaucansonsmasterpiece and completed a reputationalready made wide by his mechanicalflute player and an automatic musicianwhich not only blew upon the flageoletbut also kept time to it on a tambourineThe bird was of life size and not onlywas it outwardly an exact imitation toa feather of a real duck but its internalanatomy was absolutely true to life Soindeed were its movements for itswam dived walked quacked atedrank and by an ingenious device evenseemed to digest its foodThis automaton disappeared after itsinventors death but turned up againin 1840 in a garret in Berlin and waspurchased by a George Tiets who tookfour years to put it in proper workingorder again At the end of this time itwas exhibited in a room in the PalaisRoyal Paris where Mr Houdin thecelebrated conjuror saw it and indeedafterward when something happenedto one of its wings took charge of andrepaired it No doubt it is still in existence Of more modern automata thisis scarcely the place to speak for theyare private secrets Let us confine ourselves to merely mentioning Mr Maskelynes Psycho and ZooLike most things automata have notalways been what they seemed Ofmany frauds upon the wonder lovingpublic perhaps the completest was thatof the famous automatic chess player ofMr Kempelen which was exhibitedall over Europe at the end of the lastcentury and afterward in America Itwas the figure of a life sized Turk seated behind a large box the top of whichwas marked in the middle for chessPrior to the automatons meeting anopponent the front of the box was opened and skeptical lookers on were shownan arrangement of strings pulleys andcylinders After this they were allowedto examine the interior of the figurewhich was hollow Then Mr Kempelen wound up his Turk with a key andit was ready to play which it did bymoving the pieces with its left handand giving three nods for check to kingand two for check to queen All thenoted chess players of Europe succumbed to the figures superior strategy andits skill so impressed the Empress Catherine II of Russia that she wished tobuy it and was with difficulty persuaded by Mr Kempelen to give up the ideaIt was not for years that the secret wasdiscovered but like most secrets itleaked out at last The real chess player was a Mr Wronsky a Polish ex-captainboth of whose legs had been amputated at the trunk in consequence ofa wound from a cannon ball While thespectators were examining the boxWronsky was in the Turks body andwhen they turned to inspect that an ingenious mechanism slid him back intothe box To the fact that Wronsky wasa ches3 player of consummate skill thewide fame of the automaton which hesecretly controlled is to be attributedAfter this disclosure Mr Kempelen sautomaton naturally enough ceased tomove mankind to wonder New YorkPostStrict Sunday

Degree to AdaptItself to Its SurroundingsIt is a familiar fact that fishes1 canchange their colors at will Many fishesmake remarkable changes Free swimming fishes most commonly preservetheir normal

capture food thesechange their colors to match the bottomthey are on so as to make themselvesinvisible They do this often to a degreethat seems extraordinaryIn one of the smaller saltwater tanksat the New York aquarium there are anumber of small flatfish The bottom ofthe tank is covered with coarse gravelThe great bulk of the gravel is composed of pebbles of a brownish white asort of pale iron rust color Scatteredin this are pebbles cf a deeper tingewith now and then one of a brownishgray or brown blackThe flatfish lying on the gravel at thebottom of this tank imitate its colors intheir own backs in a manner that ismarvelous They are of a mottled brownlike the colors of the gravel and thesmallest of the flatfish is the mostwonderful They are all thin and lieclose to the bottom The edge of the little one blends with it and its back is awonderful mosaic of browns so like thegravel of the surrounding bottom thatit appears to be a part of it Even inthis clear water at a little distance
