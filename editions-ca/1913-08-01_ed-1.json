RAISE $40,000 TO GET
U. S. AID
FOR ROADS.
Henry Prewitt, of Mt. Sterling, noti
fied Senator James by wire Tuesday
that Montgomery, Mason and adjoin
ing counties interested in building a
road from Mt. Sterling to Maysville,
have raised $40,000, one-half the esti
mated cost. According to an agree
ment made by Postmaster General
Burleson, on the occasion of Mr. Prew
itt's recent visit in Washington, the
Government will provide the remain
der of the cost under the terms of an
appropriation made in the last Con
gress. This will be the first Government-aid
in road building rendered in Kentucky
under the new act. Mr. James called
on the Postmaster General Wednesday
to notify him that the counties have
completed their quota and ask Mr.
Burleson to supply -the Government
fund at once.
WARM FIGHT IN SENATE
CHAMBER OVER FLOURSPAR.
The Senate, after listening to two
hours of debate Tuesday, defeated an
amendment offered by Senator Brad
ley increasing the rate on fluorspar in
the current Tariff Bill from 1.50 to
$3 a ton. The vote was 61 to 56. Mr.
Bradley took the position that to cut
the present rate from $3 to $1.50, as
proposed by the Democrats, will de
stroy the flourishing industry in "West
ern Kentucky.
Senator James opposed the Bradley
amendment and the grounds on which
it was offered. He said that, although
most of the spar mined in Kentucky
is in his home county, and the opera
tors of the mines are his boyhood
frieuds, he is against a duty higher
than $1.50. Mr. James adduced fig
ures to prove his contention that the
domestic spar can compete with the
English product at $1.50 a ton.

CARD FROM MRsFRED LINK.
To the Voters of Paris, Ky;
It having been circulated with a
view of prejudicing my interests, as a
candidate for Chief of Police of Paris
that I was, in 1905, a strike-breaker
in 'the city of Chicago, I desire to em
phaticacally deny s.uch statement as
untrue in every particular.
During the period of the strike and
four years previous I was in the em
ploy of the Adams Express Company
in the clerical department, and was a
member 'of the Express Messengers'
Union, an affiliated branch of the
American Federation of Labaor. I
at no time a teamster, as has been
falsely stated, nor was I employed as
a strike-breaker.
The following is a copy of a letter
of commendation which I received
the Adams Express Company's gener
al agent when I left their service in
November, 1905, and returned to Paris:
Adams Express Company.
Chicago, 111., Nov. 14, 1905.
To Whom It May Concern :
W. F. Link has been in our employ
for about five years, and during that
itime I have found him sober, honest,
loyal and zealous. I take pleasure in
giving him this letter of recommenda
tion.
Yours truly,
J. L. CALHOUN,
General Agent.
The original of the above letter
and other proofs that what I state
above is the truth will be shown to
any interested person.
Respectfully,
W. FRED LINK .

SDK' AND FARM NOTES
Nine cents per pound for stock
hogs for delivery August 20 prevails
in Nicholas county.
Bean & Hutchings, of Boyle,
bought of Col. R. G. Evans 56 head
of 135-lb. hogs at 8 3-5c and of C. P.
Cecil, Sr., 44 180-pound hogs at same
price.
Nicholas County farmers are re
ported as refusing ten cents per
pound for their growing tobacco to be
delivered on the floors of the loose leaf
warehouse.
The largest steer ever handled by
the Independent Packing Co., of St.
Louis, was slaughtered there for J.vbn
Catiarata, proprietor of a restaurant.
The animal weighed 2,900 pounds on
foit. and dressed more tlm 2,0"0
pounds. The steer was raised by
Caffarata on his farm in St. Louis
county. It was three years old and at
the market price it would have brought
$269 on the hoof.
Cynthiana Court Monday was the
largest July court day in many years.
All farm work is tied up on account
of the drought and farmers took ad
vantage of the opportunity to attend
court. Generally speaking, there was
not much business done by the mer
shants, but the streets were thronged
with people from early until late.
Two large tobacco meetings at the
court house drew a large crowd there.
About 150 head of cattele on the mar
ket; 1,000 pouncT cattle brought $6.65
per hundred; 500 pound steers sold at
pirces from $32 to $35; milk cows at
$40 to $45; ordinary horses, a few on
the market, brought from $35 to $75.
There were no mules on the market.

Doan's Kidney Pills have brought
benefit to thousands of kidney suf

D. M. Farley, merchant, 474
Ave., Lexington, Ky., says:
Chair
I had
dull, dragging pains in my back. The
action of my kidneys was irreegular,
especially at night. Finally,I used
Doan's Kidney Pills and before long
they put a stop to all these troubles.
My kidneys became normal and the
pains and aches left. The endorse
ment I gave Doan's Kidney Pills in
January, 1912, still holds good. I can
only repeat that they are a fine kidney
medicine."

To the Democrats of Paris, Ky.:
In offering myself as a candidate for j
re-election as Judge of the Police"
Court I wish respectfully to submit
to your consideration a few brief notes
regarding my service:
Since I was sworn in office in Jan-
uary, 1910, 1 have tried 1,006 cases, and
have only had two appeals taken from
my decisions. Both of these appeals
were in the hope of escaping jail sen
tences which had been adjudged in
accordance with the law.
Prior to my. term in office the fol- -lowing
sums were collected for fines:
In the years 1904, 1905 and 1906, (a
period of three years,) a total of $1,
580.15. In the years 1907, 1908 and 1909, a
period of three years,) a total of $1,
567.20. In the years 1910, 1911 and 1912f
the three years during which I have
been Police Judge, a total of $2,868.67
has been paid in fines.
You see, therefore, that during my
administration, there has been a de
cided increase in the receipts "of the
office. Also, jail bills for the three
years have been decreased.
The above will surely meet with the
approval of all good citizens.
From the fact that practically no ap
peals from my decisions is it not proof
of my fair, lawful and impartial judg
ments of my fellow man?
If re-elected, I assure you that I will
continue as in the past to judge im
partially and according to law.
Thanking you for past favors, andr
hoping -that my administration may1"
meet with your approval and indorse
ment, with your support, I remain,
Your public servant,
E. B. JANUARY.
