Van 'Warden Jewels."
When a "'society highwayman" sto-:
ry is well done on a moving, picture
film it is very effective because i of
the contrast which crime offers when
'sandwiched in among- the every-day
actions of society people. The Van
Warden Jewels, as (a play, ist dramatic
and well-bred if one can imagine
the two mixed.
This Web of intrigue is clearly in
dicated, from one step to another, all
through the moral, every-day life 'of
well-bred people who live"'the usual
country-nouse lire. There is no
"rough-house" no blood or gun play
But there is an excellent picture of
society life as it really is" and a very
real impression 6f the only ''sort of
criminal one finds among that class
of people. 1 1 . ,
