Sunday services were held, conducted
by Rev. Father Eugene DeBruyn.
Sunday schools were held at all the
churches at the regular hours, the at
tendance being up to the average.
Despite the forbidding weather of
Sunday; the Paris churches each had
a large attendance, and the services
were of an unusually interesting char
acter. At the Baptist church Dr. O. R.
Mangum occupied his pulpit at
both the morning and the evening
services, and delivered interesting ser
mons. At the Episcopal church, Rev. Geo.
H. Harris administered the sacrament
of the Holy Communion, and delivered
an impressive sermon at the morning
service.
Rev. Dr. B. M. Shive preached to his
congregation at the Presbyterian
Church Sunday morning on the sub
ject, "A Real God." At the night
service he delivered a strong sermon
to a large audience.
At the midday services at the
Presbyterian Church, Sunday, ' three
very interesting additions were made
to the church in the persons of Mr.
and Mrs. John Smith and Miss
Neelljie Bosman, who are residing on
the Simms place. Mr. and Mrs. Smith
were members of the Dutch church in
Holland. Their infant son, John
Smith, Jr., was baptized -at this ser
vice. Rev. W. E. Ellis closed his revival
meeting at Lawrenceburg on Friday
night and returned home Saturday.
On account of the morning hour being
devoted to the annual observance of

occupy his pulpit, but preached at the
evening service. At the morning ser
vice, Dr. Irene T. Myers, Dean of Wo
men at Transylvania University, Lex
ington, delivered an address, and
was greeted by a large and apprecia
tive audience.
At the Methodist church the first
Quarterly- Meeting of the Conference
year was held, with the Presiding El
der, Rev. E. L. Southgate, in attend
ance. At the morning service Rev.
Mr. Southgate administered the sacra
ment of the Lord's Supper. The night
service at 7:30 o'clock was of a most
impressive and interesting character.

Wednesday, Dec. 9th "The Million
Dollar Mystery" Episode No. 22
"The Waterloo of the Conspirators"
Events are crowding forth in quick
succession. The "Black Hundred" are
now being pursued relentlessly. Flor
ence finds herself alone in the House
of Mystery, fearful of mind, a revol
ver her only protection. A man
comes swinging down the street
enters the House of Mystery and with
apparently joyous steps hastens to
ward Florence. Is the man Hargrave?
Lightning like action prevails. The
"Black Hundred's" secret cave is raid
ed. Many are taken, but, where is
Braine, where is Olga? Back to the
House of Mystery. The final secenes
of this Twenty-Second Episode are
portrayed in vivid dashing action.
The solution, which will be the

from the solution that wins the $10,
000.00 prize and will be shown on the
screen as soon as practicable.
A Two-reel Eclair drama will also
