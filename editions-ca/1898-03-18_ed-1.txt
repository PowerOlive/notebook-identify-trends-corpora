cabinet thereon have been communicated to the state departmenthere This has not taken the form ofprotest however as it does not appearthat the Spanish government claim orassert the right to question such internal measures as the United Statesmay adopt even though thesebe of a character to indicatepreparations for war It is rather byway of representations conveyed in afriendly spirit and without

ready to report Unless thereare new discoveries here which is unlikely there is nothing to bedone but for the membersto seclude themselves in theIowa and formulate the convictions already firmly held There is no reasonto change the belief that the court willfind that the disaster was caused by anexplosion outside the Maine but itsmembers have been as secret as thegrave The chief officers havebeen absolutely discreet whilethe talk of the divers has beencontradictory From numerous bits ofevidence that have come out duringthe Cuban insurgents at the mementwhen the autonomy plan is to have itscrucial trial through the Cuban elections and in this way defeat the reforms Premier Sagasta is seeking tocarry out It has been especiallypointed out that the presence of a large fleet ofUnited States warships at Key Westcan not be regarded as a friendly measure as the sending of ships was officially represented to be when theMaine went to Havana and the Vizcayare turned the complimentary visit Inshort the presence of this extensivefleet near Cuba together with the warmeasures taken by the Unitsd Statesare regarded by Spain as seriously prejudicial to the policy of autonomywhich Spain and the United Stateshave alike approved and an indirectencouragement to the insurgents in defeating the desiresof both governments for the success ofFLEET OF MONITORS FOR COAST AND HARBOR

CommWJMWtfMRMAMWMMMMWCHAPTEK X ContinuedI went on expressing amazement until I discovered that Sonntag did notseem to hear me so intent was he overthe words the voice had utteredPshaw whats the use botheringover that Mr Sonntag I said Thereisnt much sense to be made out of itanyhowYes there is too It is conversation and not a mere jumble of wordsthe old lawyer said with an air of tri-umph Just hear what I make out ofJ it nowDivided up the following was Sonntags versionFirst Party Never will you have myconsent under existing circumstancesYoubave bf oken faith with me in everyway Why was the property removedfrom the original placeSecond Party To bring you totimeFirst Party What did you do withitSecond Party Safely hid where youcan never find it unless you talk wisdom I shall go for it this very nightand take it away and not one dollarwill you everThere thats a pretty sensible talkI take it said my lawyer when he hadfinishedOh well perhaps it is sensibleenough but what good will it do younow that you have made a conversationout of it I remarked in some impatience for Sonntags satisfactionseemed to be out of all proportion to theimportance of a few chance remarkscaught in some mysterious fashionfrom a telephone wireThe old lawyer smiled in a kind ofpitying way and regarded me with awhimsical expressionWho knows I went on gaylyperhaps my arrival in Nelsonville mayoe the cause of a complete revolution inmatters regarding the telephone Imust send for an electrical expert andhave him investigate the mystery Already there are visions of an immensefortune floating through my headSuppose we go to the old schoolhouse from which the stones used in thetwo doorways were evidently takenSonntag suggested breaking in uponmy imaginingsWhat possible difference can it makeif the stones were taken from thereI remarked That will not tell us whythe job was doneWell it would be pleasant for you tomeet an old friend Horace Jacksonshunting lodge is quite near the schoolhouse Perhaps we may find him athis place mjf lawyer said insinuatinglyYes I know The fellow Huntei theagent at Sidington told me Jacksoncomes up here occasionally to huntfish But as for Jackson being a f rit jid-of mine heaven save me from suchfriendsNoting Sonntags surprise at mywords I explained the reason of myoutburst how Jackson had of latechanged hia opinion of my innocenceand how Florence had made a compactwith him and the certainty he seemedto feel that she would be compelled toredeem her promiseThe lawyer was all attention nowkeeping his sharp eyes constantly onY lace while l poureu out my opinion of Jackson and his underhand6ds I was a lover and Jackson a sortof rival so naturally mj remarks weresomewhat stronger perhaps than riecessaryWhy did you call the stationcagehtHunter asked SonntagBecause he told me that was hisniame I repliedIndeed What could he have toldyou that for 1 wonder His name isiiot Hunter ifs SkinnerIt is Well thats odd Why shouldhe wish to conceal his real name frommeHni cant say Im sure repliedSonntag dryly But I am delightedbeyond measure to hear what yon havetold me concerning Jackson he exclaimed with more enthusiasm thanhe had ever displayedOh indeed I It does not delightme the bare suspicion has been enoughfor me to endure I do not know thatI would care very much for a seemingproof of guilt to be found against meYou do actually seem pleased I remarked with disgustPleased is not the word I am morethan pleased What you have told meis a most important bit of news Sonntag said taking up his hatWhy is it important and to whomI askedVery important to me but more toyourselfNo stay and explain I called tohim as he went out the door whatdo you meanHavent a moments time Must goI mean that most probably the cloudwhich has enveloped your name will belifted shortly Do not cut into the cellar to day Wait until to morrowSaying this my law3er departedCHAPTER XII stood for some time gazing at thedoor through which Mr Sonntag hadgone Amazement held possession ofme A thousand and one questionswhirled through my headBut my lawyer had departed I finally strode to the window in the hope offinding him within hailing distanceHe was far down the Twineburgkroad too far to call himI saw him pull up his horse and leanforward and address a man who hadapproached him from the opposite directionThe conversation lasted but a minuteand then horseman and pedestrian eachwent on their several waysWhen the pedestrian drew nearer Isaw it was Hunter the station agent atSidington or as Sonntag had informedme Skinner It seemed very odd thathe should have assumed another nameThen my e3e caught the glimpse of ahorsewoman coming down the roadfrom the direction of the Morley residence It needed but that glimpse totell me that it was Florence She wascoming toward the house perhaps tosee meWhen she reached the cross road leading to Sidington and Twineburgh upwhich the man Hunter was approaching she reined up her horseWhen the fellow came up to FlorenceI was surprised to see him stop and engage her in a conversation which lasted some minutes and appeared to berather earnest judging by the wayFlorence leaned down toward himFinally the young woman turned herhorses head and galloped back in thedirection she had comeThe station agent watched her retreating form then slowly began to retrace his steps h He had gone but ashort distance when he stopped andlooked toward my house then againturned and came backI watched him from behind the curtains As he approached near I sawhis clothing was wet and bedraggledwhich plainly showed that he had beenout in the recent showerHe came up to the house in a hesitating way glancing all around furtivelyand was about to pass up into the yardwhen I leaned from the window andhailed himHalloo there whats up What doyou want I demandedGlancing up at me with his stupidstare he spoke When you want tosend anjthing away by freight have itat the station before nine oclock in themorning he said in the deliberatingway of one who is compelled to manufacture a speech on the spur of themomentIs that all you wish to say to meYou did not come all the way from Sidington to tell me that I inquiredcausticallyWhy no he began glancing allaround as though seeking for hiswords in the surrounding objects 1I thought perhaps you didnt knowthat that a are you having a goodtimeA most enjoyable time indeed I exclaimed enthusiastically if Komewhatsarcastically Just such time asI needed restful quiet a7id perfectpeaceJust a trace of a smile seemed to flitacross his face at my wordsOh then there is nothing the matter with the place he asked curiouslyI was considerably surprised at thisquestion I should say not Whatshould be the matter with it I askedSome folks say its kind o queerlike Some say dead people use thehouse at nights for meetings he replied sinking his voice down low andglancing around nervouslyIs that so Well let them Aslong as the dead ones dont disturb meI am sure I hare no objection Whatpart of the house are the spirits supposed to frequent I asked a thoughtof the walled cellar coming- to meThe fellow seemed a trifle flusteredI thought by my sudden question Hegave vent to a nervous laugh and atthe same time darted a sharp glanceat me which monfentary as it wasnevertheless was so different from hisusual half wondering stare that I wasimpressed by itOh I dont know what jmrt of thehouse is xised by the spirits Howshould I knowThere had been something irritatingto me in the fellow and as there wasa hint of insolence in his last wordsIgave way to my impatienceSee here you have given me somestrange hints about my house 1 began sternl3r pow then youll pleaseexplain more fully what you meanMr Hunter or perhaps I should sayMr SkinnerI do not know what impelled me toadd the name which Sonntag said wasTHE BOURBON NEWS PEIDAT MARCH 18 1898the correct one but the effect on thefellow startled me considerablyHis eyes grew staring and a terrifiedhunted expression came over his faceGlancing furtively around and drawing back a step or two his hand wentto his hip pocketAs the glint of a shining objectcaught my eye I drew suddenly back toone side of the window and the nextinstant a pistol report sounded outI stood still a moment dumfoundedby the attack then dropped on myhands and knees and crept past the window to the table in the drawer of whichI had placed my pistol Hastily grasping the weapon and noting that it wasready for use I arose and approachedthe window holding the pistol beforeme in readinessTwo can play at your game MrBut I got no further The man was nowhere to be seenI hastened from the house and ranaround searching for him but no tracecould I discover He had vanished completely His sudden disappearancepuzzled meI soon gave up the search put he pistol in my pocket and started briskly upthe road toward the Morley placeIf the station agent was such a desperate fellow as to draw and shoot at aword what could Florence have to dowith himIt was strange that Sonntag shouldknow the fellows right name and notknow the danger attendant on callinghim by it My lawyer had seemed surprised when I stated that the fellowhad told me his name was Hunter Inall probability Sonncag had addressedhim by the name of Skinner manytimes and the fellow had not resentedit or the lawyer would have mentionedthe fact Why then should he resentin so fierce and deadly a manner my useof his right namePerhaps Florence could tell me something about Mr Hunter or Skinner Atleast it was right I should warn heragainst himWith these thoughts flitting acrossmy mind I soon arrived at the Morlejhome and entering the gate went upthe long graveled walk Before an opportunity was allowed me to ascendthe steps leading to the piazza my namewas calledWhy Mr ConwayIt was Florence who called and whoon my turning toward her got out ofa hammock She was still dressed in herriding habit and as I approached I noticed her horse tied to a post near byAre you going riding again Iasked In that case pardon my intrusionPapa and I usually ride at thistime I am waiting for him she saidDesperate vHlainP she repeatedwith a touch of surprise

What can bethe matter she asked her browneyes staring in astonishment Willyou not speak nowWhy I can certainly It is not veryimportant perhaps I wish to ask youwhat you know about the station agentat Sidington I have seen you talkingwith him on several occasions Whatcan one like you have to talk about withsuch a desperate villainFlorences face turned white Desperate villain she repeated in a fearsome whisper Why NelsonThen I told of my recent talk withthe scoundrel and his dastardly attempt to shoot meFlorence hearkened with handsclasped across her bosom her eyesstaring in terrified amazementOh do not be alarmed I added Hedid not hit me A miss is as good as amile you knowBut she still stood gazing at medoubt and fear uppnher face too dumfounded to speak Finally she burstinto tears and in a most pathetic wayheld out her hands appealingly to meStirred to the hearts core by hergrief I caught the dear form in m3rarms Wondering what could be thecause of the sudden and overwhelmingexpression of sorrow and heartilyashamed of myself for having addressed her in cold formal tones Isought with manyconsole herendearing terms toWhat is it my love that so distressesyou Tell

spring- and under the geniali lfluences of the season Little Porcuj ine and Runs Side ways were goingickiya Other of the young men weregoing wickiya or a wooing also butthese two had allowed their fancies tolurn at one and the same time to Lark-that-Singsand that is what made theold women talkLark-that-Sings was pudgy of faceand squat of stature but her eyes werelarge liquid and black as a young doesand her clear saffron skin as smoothand glossy as a cottonwood leaf Thethick braid of hair fell from either aideof the bright streak of vermilion thatdivided her scalp and her mouth wasan aboriginal poets dream Individually therefore these young men were notto blame although there was no doubtthat collectively their affections weremisplaced and unfortunate For onething it made considerable trouble inthe Takowakan familyTakowakan was the fond male andonly parent of Lark-that-Sings Hehad a marked preference for RunsSideways as a suitor for his daughtershand He had emphasized this preference upon his daughters person withhis hickory coo stick that was whenthe horses came but without availIt would have been all right andthere would have been 10 trouble ifIt had not been for the Black Robeswho had put rebellious and independentideas into the maidens head along withthe alphabet It was an evil day forTakowakan when he let Lark-that-Singsgo to them to learn the ways ofthe white people It was all badLittle Porcupine the son of Majaokawas anjthing but a model characterNone could say with certainty that hewas a thief but no one of the tribedoubted it A remarkable talent formaking the thing that was not as thething that was made him a valuablewitness and he was better known inthe federal courts than the UnitedStates marshal Marshals cameamassed wealth and went but LittlePorcupine was always on deck Heliked the excitement of metropolitanlife at Deadwood There he faredsumptuously every day and was provided with unlimited cigarettes withpretty pictures in the packetsAs for Runs Sideways he while notprepossessing was phenomenally truthulfpranvlndian and quitemendacity in others He was industrious and never returned from thechase empty handed The taste ofagency whisky was unknown to himand in other respects his morals wereabove reproachIn spite of all this when the maidens took their vessels and chatteringand giggling wended their way to thecreek for water Lark-that-Sings paidno attention when Runs Sidewaysplucked her by the blanket but whena little further on Little Porcupinestepped from the willows by the trailand did the same thing she unhesitatingly broke ranks And when RunsSideways brought four of his eightponies and tied them by the Takowakan domicile the maiden would not untie them although her father entreatedher earnestly at the last with thehickory rod aforesaid to do so Forthe tying of the ponies was a definiteproposal of marriage and the untyingwould have been an acceptanceThree days after this occurrence anemigrant wagon drawn by a milch cowand a two-year-old steer rolled toilsomely into Fort Randall and thedusty pioneers who were with the outfit explained with much fervent profanity that their team of horses andtwo good saddle ponies had been stolenfrom them two nights before Aposse was at once organized to rideback and see what could be done to4race he robbers A good looking andintelligent young Indian whom thepost trader addressed as Little Porcupine offered his services as trailer forthe modest compensation of twolars per diem and rations and his offerwas acceptedBack over the prairie they sped andsoon arrived at the camping placewhere the horses were stolen HereLittle Porcupine quickly found thetrail although it had raiiied since andwas quite imperceptible to the rest ofthe party With more

consequently threatenedo extinguish a great East Indiany have been in progress for yearsbut they have only recently reachedti stage where this product can be obtained cheaply enough to compete withthe old article commerciallyThere was a time when in central Germany a large quantity of indigo wasmanufactured from a home grownnlant But for some reason the indigoplant of East India yielded a muchlarger proportion of dye than this oneand after a century or two in spite ofprotective legislation and the promiseso European manufacturers to use onlythe domestic indigo the Germans abandoned the further production of thelatter It now looks as if East Indiawere about to experience a similar fateAt the present time her indigo industry yields her several millions of dollarsShe furnishes the calico printers of thewhole world with dyestuffChemistry has found it a much easiertask to take a substance apart than toput it together again Countless essences and extracts have been analyzedand their exact composition learnedCareful lists have been made showingthe precise proportion in which theatoms of carbon hydrogen and oxygengo together in these compounds Butwhen the chemist attempts to build upone of these substances from its elements -he often discovers that theywont combineAlready several perfumes of flowershave been exactly imitated by thismethod and 30 years ago after 45 yearsof experiment a cheap way of gettingthe coloring principle of madder abeautiful red dye out of coal tar wasfound Since that time it has not beenprofitable to raise the madder plantThe possibility of mans putting together the ingredients which natureemploys in making the essential partof indigo and in precisely the sameproportions was demonstrated a longtime ago And synthetic chemistryhas since been studying- the problemof cheapening the process so that itmight be placed on a commercial basisA German house the Badische Anitin and Soda Fabrik of Ludwigshaf en-on-the-Rhinehas within a few monthsplaced on the market an almost pureindigo blue at a price so very near thatof the East India article that a formidable competition is at last threatenedIt should be observed that the indigoplant yields in addition to the blueprinciple indigo tin a red dye Themanufacturing chemists have thus fargot only the blue d3e Moreover it isalleged that the system of treatingthe East India plant now in vogue doesnot extract all of either principle whichexists there Improved methods oimanufacture may perhaps cheapen thenatural article a little moreIt is too soon therefore to predictthe complete downfall of the indigcbusiness of the east - But it is certainly in greater peril to day than ever before N Y TribuneITS A GREAT RODLightning Cannot Harm the HighSteel BuildingLightning is not

tv to Secure Satisfactory Resultfrom tlie OperationIn securing any decided benefit fromspraying it is essential that the workbe done in good season and that carebe taken to do it thoroughly If donecarelessly or improperly the results willrarely be satisfactory Then it shouldbe understood that there are two classesof pests cr insects that spraying is doneto destroy There is the biting insectthat actually bites through and eats aportion of foliage or as we may termit a portion of the solid substance of theplantFor these essential poisons may beapplied by spraying in the leaves andfoliage so that it will be swallowed bythe insect in its foodThe sucking insects are those thatinjure plants upon which they feed by agradual extraction of the juices bysucking beaks which they thrustthrough the inter layers into the softertissues beneath and gradually take outthe juices For this class it is necessary to apply poisons that penetrate alittle at least into the plant cells inorder to be of any benefit Generallythe better way is to apply spray substances which will act externally on thebodies of these pests either as a causticsufficiently strong to kill or to smotheror stifle them by closing up the breathing poresWhile no iron clad rules can be laiddown generally with biting insects thefirst spraying should be given as suonas the foliage has started out well withthose plants that the leaves start outbefore the blossom appears and as soonas possible after the blossoms fall orat those that blossom first While caremust be taken not to apply too strongso as to injure the foliage at the sametime it is also essenial to do thoroughworkThe apple and pear will bear astronger solution than the peach In allcases two or three applications will benecessary if the best results are securedgiving them from ten days to two weeksapart Get the pump and the necessarymaterials in good season so that at theproper time the work can be done without delayOur own experience leads us to saythat spra3ring has become a nec essity ifthe best quality of fruit is secured andthe best health and thrift of the treesmaintained N J Shepherd in Farmers VoiceHANDY FARM
