Kirby surrounded by a square of the guardsHe was hustled upstairs into thecourtroom without the knowledge ofthe thousands of men who stood out-side Death like silence prevailed during the proceedings which did not lastfive minutes Mitchell remained standing and was evidently quite scaredThe court then appointed MrFlaugher to defend him In responseto the question of the court as towhether the defendant would waivethe reading of -the indictment Mitchells attorney answered in the affirmativeMitchell pleaded guilty The courtthen at once sentenced him to 20 yearsconfinement in the Ohio penitentiarythe limit of the lawMitchell was hurried back to jailand the immense crowd on the outsidewas none the wiser of what had takenplace It was part of the plan ofSheriff McLain and his deputy HarryKirby to spirit Mitchell into a carriage and drive him to Hagenbaughstation or Woodstock and there boardthe eastbound Pan handle3 which arrives in Columbus at about midnightThe exciting incidents of the lasttwo days had an unfortunate and deplorable culmination at 230 Fridaymorning The disorganized mob of1500 stood on the streets all nightyelling and perfectly willing to lyncha brute in human form guilty of afiendish crimeThe mob had been slowly advancingall night nearer and nearer to the jailiThe guards were crowded closer to thebuilding as the night advanced Finally a dozen men or more got ontosome steps leading to the back entrance in the jailA ifellow with a big sledge hammerhe had been carrying all night underIhis coat blazed away at the doorknocking it in At that instant theguards who were stationed inside thebuilding opened fire and at least 20jshots were poured promiscuously intothe crowdThe man who carried the sledgehammer escaped without injury but ayoung man named Higgins or Hagansdropped dead shot through the bodyThe crowd scattered instantly During the few seconds in which the firingtook place some deplorable work wasdone Harry Bell son of Smith Bellof

deserved andnave obeyed the command and wishof his prostrate and as is announceddying victimThe sensational and unfortunateevents of the night intensified thefeeling against Mitchell if that waspossible and the determination beoarae general that the brute shouldnever leave the town aliveAfter the firing of the military onthe crowd1 of spectators during theearly morning hours Gov Bushnellordered Company B Third infantry ofSpringfield to come here at once TheSpringfield militia arrived here at 710Friday morning and left their specialtrain on the outskirts of the city ornear the

forwardfrom the crowd on the courthousesteps and proceeded to address themilitia and the crowd The mayor assured the militia that- their serviceswere not wanted that the peoplewere law abiding and would assist himin preserving order that the companycould leave the courthouse yard andwhen their services were needed hewould send for them The Springfield company without waiting forfurther orders marched down streetto the depot without as much as thesheriff seeing them The local military company had previously refusedto serye longer and went to the secondstory of te sheriffs residence andtried to sleepWith no resistance offered the crowdat once made a rush for the side doortwo strong and determined men kicked it down in short order and gainedadmission to the jail the crowd following There were plenty of sledgehammers chisels and other tools inthe crowd and the men went to workPart of the crowd had previouslyforced themselves upstairs into theprivate apartments of the sheriffand after looking about found a bunchof keys which had been hid away andwhich proved to be the Jkeys to thejaiL The crowd got into the jail inshort order They did not wait to unlock the door to Mitchells cell butburst the lock with a sledge hammerand the door soon flew open Mitchellwas standing in his cell and offered noresistance and did not utter a wordSome one in the crowd had a rope andit was placed over the brutes neckand the crowd made for the doorMitchell following at the endIn going down the steps on the outside of the jail Mitchell fell down andthe rope slipped off his neck Thecrowd surrounded him jumped on himlike a thousand hungry dogs after oneboneThe brute was kicked beaten andalmost killed right then and thereThe rope was quickly slipped over hishead again and a rush was made for atree in the southeastern corner of thecourthouse yard in front of the courthouse The end of the rope wasthrown over a good strong limb and athousand willing hands pulled thewretch up The end was tied to theiron fence and Mitchell was left hanging there in full view of several thousand people to die the death he hadbrought upon himselfAll this was done in shorter timethan it actually takes to tell the storyThe lynching took place at about 720Friday morning The men takingpart in it made no attempt te disguisethemselves but it is not known whodid the work and the person who attempts to find out will get himself intoserious trouble This much is knownhowever they did their work well andthnt is all the people wish to knowIt s doubtful if Mitchell died fromthe effects of the hanging His miserable life had been almost kicked outof him when he fell down If any liferemained in his carcass it was strangled out It is the general opinionthat he was unconscious when strungup His body was

of Contention Will Bthe Sngar Schedule The Tobacco andAgriculture Schedule Will Followthe Sugar Schedule The HouseWashington June 7 While thetariff will continue the general topicof discussion in the senate during thepresent week there is no certainty asto what portion of it will receive especial attention This uncertainty isdue largely to the difficulty of determining when thev sugar schedulewill fee taken up It is so generallyunderstood that this schedule will consume consideration time that there isno effort to outline beyond it thecourse of proceeding The woodschedule will afford a brief respiteMonday before reaching the sugarquestion as that subject was left undisposed of when the senate adjournedon Saturday Senator Allen probablywill enter a motion that may lead toother speeches than his ownWhether the sugar schedule will betaken up in order is still undeterminedThere are no differences of opinion onthe subject but the prevailing desireis to get the schedule out of the wayas soon as possible This is the caseon both sides of the chamber but it isespecially true of the republicans asthe responsibility for action reststhere Still there is a desireamong republican senators thatthere should be absolute agreementamong themselves on the rates of thisschedule before entering upon its discussion in the senate and it is realizedthat this may be difficult of attainmentwithout a further exchange of opinions than has yet been permittedThere is no doubt in anyevent of a postponement until Senator Aldrichs return to thesenate He is still confined to hisroom but is expected to be out earlyin the week That the Hawaiiantreaty will be protected by the financecommittee is considered settled but acaucus may be necessary to determinewhether other changes should bemade Senator Pettigrew has decideddefinitely to offer his anti trust amendment in connection with this schedulebut beyond the fact that it will leadto a number of speeches there is nocertainty as to its course or its fateThe tobacco schedule immediatelyfollows the sugar schedule but if itshould be reached on Monday it wouldbe necessary also temporarily to passit over as the committee has promisedthe tobacco men a hearing on Mondaynight They will ask for two dollarson wrapper and 35 cents on filler tobacco There is also an inclination toreturn to the language of the Wilsonlaw on this subject This is understood to be the wish of both the importers and the tobacco growersThere are many sharp contests aheadon the paragraphs of the agriculturalschedule which is next after tobaccoincluding those on rice on which therewill be an effort to secure a return tothe house rates on cattle on which itwill be claimed there should be an advalorem rather than a specific dutyand on fish fruits chicory and saltThe innovation of a duty on tea is alsoproposed on this schedule but it ispractically certain that this provisionwill be withdrawn by the committeeThus what would have been one of theseverest contests over the bill will beavoided The cotton and spirit schedules will it is now thought excitecomparatively little debateThe house has no work ahead of itthis week and it isHhe intention of themajority leaders to adjourn Mondayuntil Thursday and from Thursday until Monday Mr Simpson and othermembers of the minority doubtless willessay the usual manouvers with thepurpose of embarrassing the republicans but in the present condition ofthe house their latitude is narrow andthey easHly can be overborne by theiradversariesGEN WEYLERAlmost Certain to Be Recalled From Cuba Campos in

Biggs almost everybody knew that he had been a sergeant during the war days and wasserving an enlistment in the regularcavalry when deprived for persistentdrinking of his chevrons The troopto which he was attached had been stationed at Quitman and in this section ofthe south for a year or more but wasordered to the Indian country justabout the time of Biggs disdharge bexpiration of term of service Thenafter a protracted spree in 2Sew Orleans he turned up at the barracks andtook on again in the infantry and inthe very company wbich oddly enoughwas so soon ordered up to the region heknew so well Indeed Biggs claimedwhen drinking to have acquaintancenot only with the Walton ladies bubwith some of the most prominent menvin Quitman county and frequentlyboasted of the good times he would havecould he only get over there Anotherthing -about Biggs He had twice gotMurphy to go as his substitute on oertain detachment or posse duty offeringas excuse that marching wore him outyet admitting to Murphy that therewere other reasons There are men inthis section whod shoot me on sightget the drop on me pick me off fromthe woods or fences he had explainedMurphy believed him and believed toohis statement that he had powerfulfriends even among officers and gentlemen who had fought through the waron the southern side He got moneywhen he needed it and spent it like agentleman said Murphy which being interpreted meant that he liberallysquandered it on his oomradesBut Biggs had of late been out ofmoney he couldnt hear from hitfriends said Murphy and was gettingin trouble He owed poker debts inthe company and liquor debts in townHe couldnt get a drink on trust andthe men were shy of playing with himbut he had always been liberal to Murphy when in funds and Murphy stoodby him now About nine oclock therefore the previous evening he noticedthat Biggs was greatly excited when anold darky came shambling in and gavehim a little note The negro had occasionally come before and did notseem to belong either in town or at theWalton place Biggs stole out to theroad despite Murphys warning and-came back in ten minutes bidding Murphy in eager whisper to be quick andcome with him It was

been prescribedfor Mrs- Walton two weeks before bytheir old family physiciafL and orderedsent from few Orleans It was one ofthe sad cases common in the south inthose hard times Miss Walton whowrote the order without her mothersknowledge had no money to send andthe firm had none to lose She explainedthat the wine was needed at once andthe money would be at hand in thecourse of ten days The wine was sentcare of Cohen Co with instructionsto collect first and not until this nighthad there been -money enough to pay forit Xow a gentleman whom Biggsknew well had brought them helpbut he himself

how its chatelaine had passedthe night he marched forth through alittle congregation of shining blackfaces and obsequious and tatteredforms and had to run the gauntlet ofa chorus of personal remarks all inhigh degree complimentary as to thestyle and fit of his uniform as well ashis general appearance In less thanfive minutes he returned but withsuch chagrin at heart that it must havebeen

hadlost its grave expression and he wasagain whistling merrily It was a longwalk to Wellington avenue miles andmiles it seemed to Scroggs and afterhe had reached the avenue he foundthat he was still a

oat smut is saidto have been discovered by Prof Jansen of Denmark the originator of thehot water treatment It is called ceres pulver and is as its name indicates a powder a small quantity ofwhich is dissolved in water the waterbeing then sprinkled upon the seedwhich must be shoveled over until allSs moistened The seed shouM thenbe spread upon a floor shoveled overfrequently for four or five days before sowing Its advantage over thehot water treatment does not lie ingreater efficiency but in convenience ofApplication tv -- ayU tdAllsentiment favorable to thecultivation of the sugar beet whichseems to be in every mind and whichis likelv to be tried this season in nearly every section of the country where itis believed the saccharine vegetableinay succeedIn no other direction is there suchopportunity at least so far as crojcultivation is concerned for the demand awaits every pound of sugarwhich caii be produced while there isno danger that there will be too muchof it for the next half century Thefigures are interesting It is estimatedthat by all the beet sugar factories ofthis country there were produced lastyear but 40000 tons The annual consumption of sugar in this country is 2-110000 tons and this amount will ofcourse increase with growth in population It is estimated that the averageacre of sugar beets will yield one tonof pure sugar or in other words thatit Avill require more than 2000000acres of the vegetable to supply thehome demand Farmers VoiceTheyPIGS ALONG SHOREAre Fed on Fresli Fish toiiConsiderable ExtentPigs like fish and pigs raised alongshore owned

distant market isbecause it is easier to do so than to sellnearer home When a lot of eggs can be-sent away in a crate to be sold by anagent the work is done and when sold inthe nearest town more time must begiven If the towns were better supplied prices would be higher in thelarge markets and it will no doubt payto build up a local custom for eggsas better priced are obtained in thatmaimer than by

has a colonyMany bees are lost when taking aclearing flight early in the springBees consume a large quantity ofwater after they begin to rear broodIf bees have no convenient wateringplace one should be provided for themExamine the hives and if you do notfind a brood in all stages it is a sign thatthe queen is deadMore spring dwindling results fromputting the bees out too soon than fromany other one causeBy feeding now the bees will breedmore rapidly thereby increasing theforce of the working beesOne of the best ways of uniting colonies is to set one hive over the otherand let the bees mix at willIt is best to contract the entrances tothe -hives in early spring until theweather becomes warm and settledIn case the queen is dead take a frameof brood from another hive and thebees will soon rear a queen for themselvesIn all feeding care must be taken notto spill the feed about the hives Itmay and generally will induce robbingTo introduce a strange queen intoa hive put her into a queen cage coverher with sugar paste and lay on top olthe framesCutting ofE edges of the comb or cutting holes in the same where there areeggs or larvae just hatched will almostalways insure the starting of queencellsBetter queens can be secured if wewait for the queen cells to be startednaturally by the bees under the swarming impulse By early feeding and adding brood this period can be hastenedSt Louis RepublicBU3NESS JUDGMENTIt Ik Necessary to 3Ike PonlxtyKeeping u SuccessIf farmers and poultrymen generallywould use more business judgmentthey would be more successful It isnot only necessary to send fresh eggsto market but the should be wellsorted in the crate as to color and sizeFurthermore they should be cleanDirty eggs and all varieties of shapesand colors will not attract the eye ofthe buyer says the Homestead Inthese days of close competition onecannot be too careful about the manner in which shipments are made Itis the same with dressed poultry Poultry should have a plump and temptingappearance free from pin feathersand ahsolutely clean The head andfeet should have a clean and fresh lookOne reason why scalded poultry neversells well in market is on account ofthe pale shrunken look of the headgiving it a sickly look Another goodbusiness principle is to serve the market according to her demands If shewants white eggs dont ship brown andif she wants brown dont force a whiteshipment on her Your broilers wouldgo begging in a rooster market and3rour roosters would have slow sales ifbroilers were asked for There are somany little things that must be considered How to market is indeed important but when to market is a factthat must be closelv studied Waitingfor holidays has made much disappointment There are too many waiting forthose events The man who marketswhen

tiine changes iorscholarship as for all the pursuits oimen We look back with a certain respectable amazement to the days whenevery scholar wrote in Latin and denounced those who were immoralenough to disagree with ids views asput rid unsavory miscreants It is notso long since Hebrew was regarded asan almost essential part of the pan-oply of a weM accoutered classic Fiftyyears hence English scholars lookingback upon the history of classical studyin the nineteenth century will probably note with surprise that in England it was distinguished by one prominent feature the serious practice ofGreek and Latin verse translationIt cannot be denied that this hasbeen a prominent feature While Eng-land was lagging as far behind Germany in philological as in theologicalresearch she was elaborating versecomposition into the form of a fine artSo much brains so much knowledgeso much taste was spenifc on the practiceso much pleasure wias won from it tJhatthe creation of a- tenth Muse

the iyromele at CuriousSursicnl Devicey While the latest discoveries in electrical science and chemistry are wide-ly heralded and get te lions share ofpraise in the world of non professionalpeople the doctors of the country arekeeping quietly at work devising newinstruments and new mechanical appliances to lessen pain and diminishdisease Hardly a month passes butsome important improvement is madein American surgical science and eachyear shows a distinct advance Oftensome notable new instrument comescbut that solves some long existingcproblem Surgery is the one branch ofmodern science wdiere an inventorswork avails him nothing except fameior it is against medical ethics for adoctor to patent a device or to getpayfor making- it All he can do is to setsome instrument maker to put it uponthe market and see that his brotherphysicians share in its benefitsOne of the most curious devices ofanything in the surgeons line is thegyromele a delicately adjusted andnovel instrument for sponging out thestomach Tt has been possible formany years to wash out the stomachand the instruments made for this purpose have reached a high state of perfection The gyromele however hasa totally different purpose and workson a totally different principle It is asponge at the end of two wire rodswhich are inclosed in rubber tubesThese rods are flexible as well asslender and a patient finds no difficultyin swallowing the little sponge rubbertubes and allThe tubes and the wire rods are justlong enough to protrude ffrom themouth when the sponge has been swallowed and is resting in the stomach Itis of course dampened just before insertion The doctor then seeing thathis patient is comfortably settled gently twists the wires These move thesponge backward and forward andwith any motion desired The processis not only more agreeable to the sickman or woman than the old method ofactually washing out the stomach butit does the necessary work better Themucous membrane that lines this digestive organ is delicate and tenaciousholding firmly particles of food at certain times and this soft sponge surfacethat moves over it accomplishes quicklyand even with something of a pleasantsensation what repeated flowings of5water may notAn old physician of Xew York tellshow in one case he was obliged to use15 gallons of wrater to wash out a stomach and how with the final quantitysmall bits of rice
