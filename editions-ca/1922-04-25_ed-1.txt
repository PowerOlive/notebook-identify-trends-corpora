Yet thisis only 1922, not 2000, and by thetime the Bellamy era of predictionis reached who dares to foretell theachievements of men.. The radio is an accomplished fact.Man has discovered -a great secret;now he sets to work to develop andevery home, every building, publicand private, will be equipped to receive the signals from the air. Theradio receiving set will be as much apart of the building as the furnaceand the kitchen stove. It will bepossible, as it is now, for every man,woman or child to hear, at the instant of transmission, whatever isgiven to the air.What then? When every home,hvhen every building in the country,-in the civilized world, has its receiving set to let in the voice of theworld, just as to-day every home hasits windows to let in --the sunlightand fresh aii how best will thiswonderful discovery, be used for theconvenience of -mankind? There isa fiefd for a Jules Verne to explorehe could fling a man around theworld in 80 days, to-day a messageis flung around the world in as manyseconds.But all speculation dies away before the inevitability of further andeven greater advances in the use ofthe new medium. Millions whose,imagination has b'een captured bythe genii of the air are giving their'minds and their enthusiasm to thisapply it. The limitation of the hu-jtask. Daily experiments are reman voice exists no longer, and awhisper thrown to the air becomesinstantaneously a chorus in a million homes.Its possibilities are so limitilessthat the day is not far distant whencorded. A United States general hasjust announced one great step. Inventions are cumulative. Given akey to the beginning and development follows more rapidly almostthan the layman can follow, or theThe accusation is made that menno longer are as courteous to women as they once were. Good manners are out of d.ate, it is said. Thechange is imputed to the change inwoman's status. Since she has leftthe shelter of the home and engaged in business and public activities,it is not considered needful'to showher deference. Men, unashamed,will remain seated in street carswhile women stand: they willsmoke in mixed society, without somuch as asking permission; they willspeak of girls as "fellows." "She'sa ,good fellow" one will hear themsay. Does it mean that the enfranchisement of women, the striking offof the shackles, has killed chivalrythat men cannot be expected to showcourtesy to women unless women occupy a subordinate position in society? vIt may be that women are themselves partly to blame. Some havelost the respect that formerly wastheirs by adopting masculine ways.A few foolish ones dislike to bethought of as "the weaker sex," or"the gentler sex," and on that aqcount discourage the showing ofdeference to them, thinking it implies that they are not the equalsof men. Of course they are notthe equals of men in muscularstrength, and they should glory innot being the equals of men incoarsness, either.If there is to be leveling of thesexes it should be effected by raisingmen's standardof refinement, not bylowering of women's.

After citing thatFederal appropriations for all purposes before the war were about$1,000,000,000, he triumphantly announces that for the last fiscal yearthey were $5,000,000,000 and haveince been reduced to a rate or apaltry $4,000,000100. This greatsaving of $1,000, OOOT,000, Mr. Coolidge infers, is due, to the present administration's mania for" retrenchment. The Vice-President says:"If, from present expenditures,there be deducted those items ,thatarose from the war and the extra amount now being expended ongood roads and the army and navy,the present cost of running the government would not exceed the prewar cost by more than $300,000,000." Mr. Coolidge, therefore, wouldhave the country believe that theamount by which present appropriations fall short of war-time and demobilization appropriations is due toG. O. P. economy; while the amountby which present expenditures exceed pre-war outlays is due to continuing was burdens.That's fair enough, Mr. Coolidge.But you should know that this administration can not eat its cake andhave it, too. If the war burden isresponsible for the high rate of .expenditure to-day as compared withpre-war times, its lifting is also responsible forwhat opportunity theadministration has had of making ashowing financially.- o-jCampaigning by radio will appealto the politicians, who then willhave all the w?res for pulling.-o-";Capital .-. $150,000.01Surplus $nd Profits , 122,5H.6iStockholders Liabilities 15t,00I.Q6Protection to Depositors $422,5fft.te JEstablished 1851Peoples Deposit BankfC& Trust Co. -- Paris, KentuckyWE WANT YOUR BUSINESS ANDARE PREPARED TO HANDLE ITOFFICERSS.

There are moreorders for it and the manufacturersalready are beginning to raise questions as to the time for delivery.Such is the report of one of the mostauthoritative trade reviews. It isestimated that production alreadyxanges at from 60 to 70'per cent, ofcapacity.Superficially this estimate doesnot seem so stimulating, but againthe question of standards enters in.The fact is that 65 per cent, of "present capacity runs pretty close to thefull volume of output in the years1912 and 1913, usually thought ofas normal. Nearly all the essentialindustries were greatly expandedduring the war. In the same wayall judgments of effort, of accomplishment and of values were muchenlarged.

Yet these two distinct types are seldom found between covers of a single book.That they -can be combined in onevolume, however,! is evidenced bythe fact that the authors ofva majority of the great stories of formeryears, which have retained theirpopularity down to the present time,have hit upon the magic -formulaand combined breathless suspensewith inimitable literary quality.And that they can still be combined in the same volume is proved bythe new novel titled "The VanishingPoint" by Coningsby Dawson."The Vanishing Point,' which,Dawson says, is the point wherepossibility and desire merge, is theI story of an American traveler abusiness man who knew nothingat all about women. O. Henry oncetold a tale of a man, into whose liferomance had never entered, who,acting upon a whim, turned in at"The Green Door" instead of following the prosaic crowd on thestreet. And romance with a capital"R" began then. So with PhilipHindwood, Dawson's very 'averageAmerican business man.To read "The Vanishing Point"is like attending a thrilling melodrama in which the scenery is constantly shifting like witnessing aplay that would be intense enougheven if it stood still, but that, forgood measures, carries you away fora flying trip across present-day Europe.

(adv)Senators toward these seven treatiesand that of the Republicans againstthe Versailles treaty. It is a contrast between Americanism and partyselfishness.The Versailles treaty was notfought because of any fear lest it involved the United States in foreignentanglements. That is evidentfrom the fact that the bitterest enemy of the Versailles treaty wasactually one of the four men whorepresented the United States in thepresentation of the seven new treaties, and certainly if the Versaillestreaty could be denounced as "entangling," what can be said of thenew group of treaties? Republicanswho shouted, "remember Washington's advice" the loudest knew atthe time they' shouted that conditions hadso changed since Washington's time as to make it impossiblefor the United States to live in isolation. 'They have proved since the lastelection -and in their efforts in behalf of'fhe new treaties that theywere insincere in their attacks uponthe Versailles treaty. Their objection to that treaty was based, not onwhat it contained, but on the connection of President Wilson with it.They know "That is true. And thecountry knows it.PUBLIC SCHOOL END0ESEDLEMONBYDuring the fourth annual convention of the American Legion, department of Florida, in session justclosed at Palm Beach, there wasunanimous and enthusiastic adoption of the following resolution:"Whereas the public school system is the fountain head of betterAmericanism, therefore be it"Resolved, That the conventionfavors Federal support of the- publicschools; and be it"Resolved further, That this convention favors an improved systemfor the vocational training of exservice men, backed by ample appropriations."Senators and representatives inCongress who favor the Towner-'Sterling bill, establishing a Department of Education with a Secretaryin the President's Cabinet, find inthis action of the premier youngAmerican men organization greatencouragement. So many organizations of all sorts have endorsed thebill that sentiment in Congress israpidly crystalizing toward its earlypassage. To fincTthe ex-service menof Florida solidly behind supportfor the public school is very gratifying to all friends of the bill and allproponents of Americanization planswhich are to work out through thepublic school.The walking ticket prepared forthose civil service jobholders appears to be a party ticket.The tariff debate is getting intofull swing in the Senate and maydrag on for three months, so perhaps this is the much-looked for,elusive normalcy.6B0UBB0N FABM CONDITIONSThe continued wet weather hascaused Bourbon county farmers tobe considerably delayed in theirspring plowing and other work.

How different is theattitude of the Democratic Senatorsfrom that of the Republicans of theSenate of two years ago!In those days Woodrow Wilsonwas trying to give 'the "world thebenefit of America's participation ina world-wide effort to -end all armedconflict.
