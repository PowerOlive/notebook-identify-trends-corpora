Porous Tire
Bicycle dealers who want to educate
riders to use the form of tire which will
give both rider and dealer the least
trouble would do well to remember the
following printed February 6 1897 by
the L A W Bulletin official organ of
the League of American Wheelmen
We often hear about porous tires but
never without a feeling that somebody may
be mistaken The fact that air comes through
the outer surface of a tire in numerous placs
is by no means conclusive evidence that there
is more than one leak in theinner tube Al
though tires are classified as inner tube and
hosepipe the idea conveyed to the mind of a
novice is erroneous since all tires have inner
tubes the principle difference being that
in tne hosepipe tire the inner tube is vul
canized fast to the outer part of the tire In
the case of a tire in which thp inner tube is
separate called the iner tube tire the inner
or air tube may be taken out an immersed in
water while it contains just enough air pres
sure to stretch it slightly above its natural
size If it contains any holes however small
the air will rise through the water io small
bubbles and if such a tube is found to be
porous while it is yet new it should be re
turned to the manufacturer This however
will be extremely rare as the method usually
employed prevents such results
If numerous bubbles rise from different
parts of a hosepipe tire at the same time and
we believe it is this form of tire that is most
often accused of being porous the chances
are thttheairis leaking through one hole
in the inner tube and that it divides into
numerous channels before it reaches the sur
face
The threads of which all tires are made
may and often do act as minute tubes
which con vej air from some leak at the in
side and let it escape at one or more open
ningssome times quite a distancefrom the
actual puncture
Great care should be taken in plugging a
hosepipe tire to prevent any fibre of the can
vas from forming a connection between the
inside of the air tube and the main part of
canvas The cut shows in an exaggerated
fashion the manner in which air frequently
finds its way to the outside through the
threads
After any tire has been used for some time
the outer rubber which comes in direct con
tact with the road will receive many little
cuts or punctures which extend only from
the surrace in to the first layer of canvas and
it is through these susface punctures that the
air escapes even though sometimes it may
first follow the canvas for several inches
Instances have been known where the
actual leak in the inner tube was on the
opposite side of the tire from the point where
the leak appears to be
There are some American riders who
do not know that the cycling public of
Europe after long experience long ago
adopted double -tube tires as the only
satisfactory ones Any American rider
who knows what a nuisance porous tire
are will back up this experience While
in America the Morgan Wright
double tube tire is sold at a very rea
sonable price and under a liberal guar
antee its construction is patented so
that other tire makers have tried to
force into favor single tube tires which
failed in Europe
Year after year these single tube mak
ers bring out a new idea for successfully
stopping leaks and repairing punctures
and year after year they fail and the
man who buys generally pays dearly for
the experience
In the Morgan Wright construction
the porosity is avoided and when one
of these tires is punctured the repair is
permanent Inside of the inner tube
lies a strip of rubber called the quick
repair strip To repair a puncture
simply inject some M W quick-repair
cement inside the inner tube press
down and pump up See that the tire
is pumped up however while the
cement is being injected so that the
cement will get into the inner tube
Riders who use M W tires no fol
low this simple instruction when the
tires puncture will save V emselve and
dealers from the trout e8 of porosity
and imperfect repairs

THE BOURBON NEWS TUESDAY MARCH 9 18S71
AMEAiMJL DlSEiSE
INFORMATION OF VALUE TO EVERY
BODY ABOUT APPENDICITIS
A Dangerous Superfluity Popular IJrrbrs
on tne Subject How to Recognize the
Danger Signs Between the Ages of Ten
and Thirty It Is Most to Be Feared
t
There is a popular and false notion
that appendicitis is caused by a grape
seed an orange seed or some other foreign
substance getting into the vermiform
appendix The true cause is the setting
up of inflammation and consequent gan
grene in the tissue of the appendix us
ually due to insufficient circulation of
blood in the part itself In thousands of
operations whioh have taken place
many in time to save the life of the pa
tient and many too late there is not
one authenticated case of a foreign sub
stance such as a seed being found in
the appendix This will be more fully
realized when one has in mind that the
interior of the appendix is only big
enough to admit a medium sized darn
ing needle Its great liability to disease
is due entirely to its low order of vital
resistance that is it is an organ which
appears to have no actual use in the
present machinery of man but in the
earlier stages of mans development it
is believed td have been a large pouch
that played an important part in the
digestive operations of the human sys
tem By ages of disuse it has gradually
shrunk to its present dimensions and is
known to science as a vestigial organ
one which is only a remnant of its
former self and possessing but a vestige j
of its original functions
- This becomes more clear if some other
parts of the body which now seem to
have no nse are considered Thetonsils
are in this class and also the wisdom
teeth and both are peculiarly subject to
disease v
The appendix is in one of the most
delicate and vital parts of the body in
the peritoneal cavity usually to the
right of the center of the abdomen
But in rare instances it has been found
on the left side and stilly more- rarely
otherwise displaced This discovery
made very recently has caused the sur
geons to be extremely careful to locate
the trdublo before using the knife
But science never stands stilly - It al
ways pushes its investigations -beyond
mere appearances and out of the myte
ries of nature develops facts which give
it power and might When itrwas once
proved that the poison which prpduced
septic peritonitis came from thebreak
ing down or decay of the appendix
the very root of one of mans worst
physical foes was laid bare Further
practice established beyond a doubt that
in a large majority of cases the appen
dix could be removed by a simple sur
gical operation and the patient restored
to vigorous health if the disease vyas
discovered in time and correctly diag
nosed
The surgeons now regard thel opera
tion itself as one of the most simple
but to obtain the best results it should
take place within a few hours after the
patient begins to suffer from the disease
In fact the sooner the operation is had
the better are the chances of recovery
while if the knife is not resorted to
death is sure to ensue very promptly or
after lingering miseries from the deadly
poison perambulating through the sys
tem and coming to the surface- in ab
scesses f
The symptoms are so plain and un
mistakable to the surgeon of today that
any sufferer may know them for himself
First The attack is alwayssudden
It comes on when the person is appar
ently in the best of health and without
the slightest warning
Second A sharp pain is felt in the
very center of the abdomen This is al
ways the case whether the appendix be
in its correct place on the right side or
displaced to the left
Third A sore and tender spot very
painful to the touch is looated exactly
where the incision must be made to find
the appendix
These are the three plain symptoms
which have been found in thousands of
cases with scarcely a variation
Thus it is that many sudden deaths
occur to persons in robust health They
are thought to have a colic or a vertigo
when the truth is that miserable and
useless little organ the appendix has
met with some kind of an accident and
clogs the whole machine
Appendicitis usually occurs between
the ages of 10 and 80 years It is ex
tremely rare above or below thoseages
It is much more frequent amoncr males
than females the proportion in all
countries being 20 per cent - females to
80 per cent males
The cause for this difference is of
very recent discovery and is not even
known - generally among the medical
profession Dr Clado a French surgeon
Rnd irfvestigator sought an explanation
of the comparative immunity of tie fe
male sesNom the malady and discov
ered that the appendix in woman has an
extra blood vessel that does jiot exist in
man This discovery was hailed with
delight by the surgical world It was
hot only a bit of new knowledge of in-
finite value wis
