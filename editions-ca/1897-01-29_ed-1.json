THE MISTAKE SHE MADE
Ballroad
Travelers Who at Last
BILLING WOLVES
-
Under-
stood Each Other
She sat by the car window gazing
out upon the unrolling scenery and pos
sibly dreaming of home and things like
that i
About six feet away from her across
the aisle was an empty seat which at
the next station was filled by a man
with a sample case He was 50 years of
age or thereabout and was quite as
per looking as if he were 30 and still
the knight to please every fair dame
who set her soft eyes upon him
The lady was young and pretty with
perhaps a shade too much display in her
makeup but still one could hardly say
that for all is not gold that glitters in
such cases or words to that effect
When the man had sat down in the
vacant seat and composed himself for
the journey before him he began to look
about to familiarize himself with his
environments and in the course of his
visnal wanderings his eyes fell upon the
young lady He gave a slight start as
people do when they think they see
somebody they know and looked again
The lady wasnt looking of course
Bnt she wasnt asleep
Not in the slightest
After a minute or two or three or
four of hesitating investigation the trav
eling man for it was he arose and very
politely and deferentially approached
the young lady
It was done as if be had been practic
ing that sort of thing ever since he had
picked up the first sample case Either
that or he was to the manner born
I beg your pardon he said as she
turned from the window to meet him
with a half startled fawnlike move
ment not altogether unusual on such
occasions arent you Miss Morton of
Philadelphia
She gave him a glassy stare with a
raw edge on it
You dont look like a man she re
plied with an insolent air who would
try to work as old a racket as that on
me Do I look so green as that
It was now his turn to gaze at her in
startled wonder
Oh thats all right she laughed
moving overdo make room beside her
and Ill forgive you You know I am
not Miss Morton of Philadelphia or any
where else and so do I know it But
sit down Im lonesome and Id just as
soon have a pleasant little talk with you
as not Im to meet mamma at the sta
tion where we take dinner
I beg your pardon said the travel-
ting man backing away 1 am sure if
you are not Miss Morton I have no de
sire whatever to talk with you
Then he went back to his place and
the flip young woman was rather in
clined to the opinion tat there was at
least one man on the road who could be
mistaken honestly
All of which occurred between Wash
ington and New York within the last
two weeks Washington Star
Some of the Methods Used to Get Kid of
the Pests
Whole families of the animals are
sometimes asphyxiated in their dens
A wolf of the gray variety generally
makes its home by getting on the side
of a dirt gulchand burrowing straight
inward until a safe distance from the
surface is reached There her young are
born and raised to sturdy cub estate
When a cowboy locates a den in
which he believes the entire family to
be gathered a composite mass of cotton
saturated with damp flour sulphur and
oter noxious smelling substances is
thrust into the den and set on fire The
mouth of the hole is then filled with
clay tamped down solidly and the im
prisoned wolves are speedily suffocated
within In this way from 6 to 10 and
11 wolves young and old are wiped
out at one stroke
Another effective method is to bore
four or more holes in a flat piece of
board and plug them up with beef fat
soaked in strychnine The odor of the
fat attracts any wolves that may be in
the vicinity and they lick the fat vora
ciously until the leavening of poison
does its work upon them and they drop
dead Very often as many as a dozen
wolves are killed off by this process be
fore the fat in the holes is exhausted
Strychnine inclosed in capsules is also
used The capsule is thrust into a slit
cut in a chunk of beef and the wolf
bolting the meat whole falls an easy
victim Steel traps baited with raw
beef are also tried with fair success
Denver Republican
Heading Women Organize
