INVESTMENT
6

The Hotel Gibson Co. (Cincinnati)
6 per cent, preferred stock is a first
lien on building and equipment to cost
$1,200,000, or 500,000 more than entire
preferred issue. In addition to this
equity, there is a gain of at least
$250,000 in present value of ground
over price at which Rotel Gibson Co.
has right td purchase ; so that prefer
red stock will have property asset3
back of this security of at least 200
per cent, of its par value. This prop
erty will probably increase still
more in valuer as the location is the
center of Cincinnati's commercial dis
trict. Established as hotel for 60 year3 in
this location.
Earnings for pastil years more than
sufficient for preferred dividend and
new hotel will have five times earning
capacity of old hotel.
Twenty-five thousan 1 dollars must
be deducted from earnings each year
to retire the preferred stock.
Rentals of stores, offices and leased
privileges more than sufficient to
meet all fixed charges and preferred
aiviaena.
We believe this stock meets the
strictest requirements of the most dis
criminating investor as to safety of
principal and income.
Any part of 1,000 shares offered at
par, carrying dividend from date of
j purchase and netting 6 per cent, on
investment.
