Great FiniHterre Jjiglxt the GiftQf WomabThe great Finisterre beacon whichis to throw its rays from the coast ofPrance far over the dangerous sea isinteresting enough in itself in its won-derful construction and its marvelouspower But it gains a new interestfrom the circumstance that it is paidfor by a legacy to the government ofPrance a womans memorial to herfather The legacy amounted to 60000 and is attractive from its strangeness With the exception of the lightwhich the United States is soon to puton the tower of Barnegat the Finisterrelight is incomparable with any otherIt is housed in a solid imposing light-- house close to the old beacon and whenthe big bulls eye lens has intensified itsflash it throws over the water a lightthat is calculated at 36600000 candlepower This it is claimed is a greaterpower of illumination than the fourlargest beacons in England combinedand it is calculated that if the surfaceof the earth were fiat it could be seenfor 100 miles As it is it only falls below the horizon for the sailor in thecrosstrees at a distance of 21 nauticalmiles The light which is used is ofitself of 6000 candle power it flashesfor one second and is in eclipse forifixe It is expected that the Barnegatlight will duplicate that at FinisterreIn each particular and a land lubbercan hardly see why we should ask formore than that Romance and poetryhave dealt very tenderly as of coursethey should with the flashing lightsof the rock bound coast and it wouldsound like high treason inhumanityor something dreadful to suggest thatto the idler on the rocks they are generally too small to be beautiful andtoo monotonous to be charming Butwhen one is at sea it is a very differentmatter and the light has more of concern watchfulness and affection thanever romancer

nothing in our opinion whichso thoroughly fills this want as greencut bone With the invention of themodern green bone cutters the problemof feeding this most excellent meat ration is easily solved Different breedershave different ideas as to the mannerof feeding We advise three times aweek and a little at first until the hensbecome used to it Fed as a separate ration it gives better results than if mixedwith othqr foods In this way we caneasily control its consumption and itanswers the purpose of meat rationmore thoroughly It is good for bothold and young stock and especially valuable for growing cockerels As compared with other food we consider itvery cheap The material the greenbones can be had for an average ofhalf a cent a pound in any butchershop Cutting them up is a

Iowa experiment station writes on the points ofbeef cattle to be taken into consideration and says There is a well-definedbeef type that admits of less flexibility than is generally regarded Thefirst thing that should be looked to isthe general beef form low broaddeep smooth and even with parallellines No wedge shape is wanted forithe block Isext in importance is afiick even -covering of the rights kin dl-of meat in the parts that give the high-priced cuts This is a very importantfactor in beef cattle that is often over-looked About 28 per cent of a goodcarcass of beef sells for nearly 64 percent of the total value The highestpriced cuts are ribs and loins Theseparts on an average sell for about threetimes as much per pound as the othersGood broad well covered backs andribs are absolutely necessary to a goodcarcass of beef and no other excellencies however great will compensate forthe lack of this essential It is necessary to both breed and feed for thickness in these parts And mere thicknessand substance here is not all Animalsthat are soft and patchy or hard androlled on the back are sure to give defective and objectionable carcasseseven though they are thick and theyalso cut up with correspondingly greater waste The men who buy our cattleand fix their market value are shrewdenough to know almost at a glance howmuch and just what kind of meat asteer or a car load of steers will cut outand if the producer overlooks any of theessential points he is compelled to bearthe lossWeed Seeds in ManureOne of the popular mistakes aboutcomposting is that it invariably killsall weed seeds On the contrary thereis reason to believe that some weedseeds with very hard shells and whichgerminate slowly under ordinary conditions will germinate all the quickerif exposed to the heat of a manure pileNot even the gizzards of birds will destroy the seeds of raspberry and blackberry as is evident from the growthof these bushes in fence corners wherethe birds have avoided them Thereshould be the greatest care not to feedstock either hay or straw containingweed seeds Both quack seed and redroot seed will live in manure piles andare often disseminated by being carried out with manure and spread onthe land American CultivatorFor the Growing ColtsThere is no better market for hay andjprain than a good colt Xo matter whatkind if he is a good one he will pay forthe extra feed he needs to keep himthrifty and growing during the winterThe market demands size in all kindsof horses driving carriage or draftand one of the factors of size is liberalfeeding during the period of growthThe oats corn and hay sold to the coltwill not bring in the cash at once butthe return is sure if the colt is a goodone National StockmanAll Animals Require LimeLime is necessary for

whether the air be i enterwholesome or not At first when I cutfor a day or two I would call it business but the mater knew old Findlayhad always managed the investmentsand the money and all that So

his presence wavedHn return courteously almost gaylyI cant tell you how that day passedIt seemed like a long drawn out nightmare I kept saying to myself I amasleep I shall awake soon Harberton sat in my mothers cool darkened room talking of me as I gatheredwhile pacing restlessly within andwithout or smoking in a 3hair outsidethe window She seemed to speak anxiously about my future I suppose likemost only sons reared by mothers I hadbeen rather wild and he appeared toreassure her She was quite soothed andhappy in his company I moved aboutI would go to the stables to speak to themen or wander aimlessly about butthere was ever that awful sense of allbeing an illusion I fancied I must bemad and I feared the sound of my ownvoiceHarberton went as he came throughthe byways carpeted with
