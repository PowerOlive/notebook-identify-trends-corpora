He made inquiry among the prisoners, and wasinformed by one of 'the boys waitingto be taken to the State ReformSchool that the work had been quietly done by three " convicted negroes, Frank Mussinon, sentencedfor life, Charles Jones and WillWarren, each sentenced to . threeyears, at a recent term of Court,and who were waiting to be taken toFrankfort to begin their terms.Several jail deliveries have takenplace at the Paris jail in the pastyear, due to the unsafe conditionof the stones in the cells. Thegrand jury at the March term of theBourbon Circuit Court in their report to Special Judge Bailey calledparticular attention to this and cited the need for immediate improvements to make the keeping of prisoners a certainty.!

Thekeynote of the entire performanceis "speed." It is billed as a musicalrevue in two acts and twelve big.episodes introducing iwenty-nine ofthe latest song hits, chiefly costumed song and dance numbers, and interspersed with an abundance ofsatire and comedy.One of the prettiest song numbers in the production is the"Painted Fan," sung by Mrs. BobJones, and danced by Misses GladysFarmer, Cora Lee Wilson, Ethel MaeShanklin, Dudley De'aver,' MargaretStanten and Julia Lavin. This is aJapanese fantasy, and is worked ina full stage futuristic set.Among tha specialties is the"Duncan Sisters," vaudeville act byMisses Rebecca Collier and SarahBradley. The Duncan Sisters, playing1 in Fred Stone's show, "TipTop," rank among the most famousstage entertainers of the day, andin "Fads and Fancies" their dancing and singing is cleverly imitatedBASE BALLThe contract for enlarging thegrandstand, building bleachers andlencing to enclose the ball park forthe local team has been awarded toEads & Boaz. The park which wasused by the Ruggles team duringthe 1921 season will be the home ofthe Blue Grass Leaguethis season. The work ofimprovements on the grounds iswell under way, and everythingwill be in readiness for the exhibition game to be played with theBoston Red Sox team of the National League, on Saturday, April 8.5The committee appointed to solicit funds from local merchantsand "fans" of Paris for stock in thelocal team have been very successfulin their campaign. Their . effortshave met with a ready response,and as a result, the club will starton a solid financial footing, something very essential to its welfare.A suggestion has been made thatthe winner of the Blue Grass Leaguepennant, which may be either Paris,Lexington, Winchester, Mt. Sterling, Maysville "or Cynthiana, arrange a post-season Kentucky champpionship series wfth the K. I. T.fieague, recently formed in WesternKentucky with eight clubs as members. It is considered very probablethat such a series will be arranged.While the salary limit in the newBlue Grass League does not permitthe hiring of high-priced players itoffers an excellent opportunity tothe youngster who need polishingup before going to the big leagues.There are dozens of good playersunder twenty-one throughout Central Kentucky who will set a hear-'jng and a try-out in the new4.SLeaerueManagers and club directors of thesix teams in the League are beingflooded with letters from ambitiousball players asking for a trial.Many of them write that they willpay their own expenses until theymake good. They appreciate thefact that if they go well in thisLeague they will be sent up to aClass B or C organization at or before the end of the season.A number of shrewd club ownersnave been looking over the collegecandidates in the State, and expect i'fr T"i otro fTio oicrno tiirnc rf cmrorol r I fi their contracts. Under the rulings.of the Southern Intercollegiate Ath-.letic Association college youths may!play summer ball as long as the salary does not exceed $7 per day, in-,eluding expenses. The Blue GrassLeague will be a boon to the boyswho believe they have the abilityto break into, fast company andwant a chance to show what they"can do. ,Manager B. F. Goodman, of the 'Paris team, is one of the most conscientious and able men in theLeague, and what he says can berelied on. Mr. Goodman says whenthe Paris team is completed arid putin the field it will be an aggregation that will make the Paris fanssit up and take notice. While theselection of players has not beengiven undue attention as yet, Mr.Goodman says Paris has its eye onsome good ones, who will help Paristo take a place, in the front rank.

Buyers have reported to the department of agriculture that there is no great demand at this time for Kentuckyhemp. iMr. Gilbert is of the opinion thatthe principal cause for the lack ofdemand lor the Kentucky crop isthat no individual -grower is in aposition to supply large orders andthat there is no central marketing Iagency' Freight rates also are afacto'r, and it is stated by Mr. Gilbert that hemp from Italy can bedelivered in New York, the principalmarket for Kentucky hemp, at asmaller cost than the Kentuckyproduct. The principal obstacles toproper marketing of the Kentuckyhemp crop could be overcome, inMr. Gilbert's opinion, by the organization of a co-operative market-association.ISDELIGHTED57WIT REITin?&ADDING MACHINE BOLLS CHEAPWe have in stock for the convenience of users of adding machines, abig stock of paper rolls.

The parties who hadthis d6g said they had bought herfrom a darkey, giving $50 for her.They had no bill of sale and theydid not know who the darkey was,bue they were absolutely confidentthey had bought the hound andwould swear to it in court. One ofthe main troublea in breaking updog stealing is that a man or aparty of men who will steal a doghave no hesitancy in falsely swearing, acting upon the principle that aperjurer is no worse- than .a dogthief.We request any one in the Statethat finds a party trying to disposeof a hound for which he has no papers which will bear scrutiny to notify the Chase Publishing Company,Lexington, phone 4700, and the matter will be investigated at once.Embarrassing,My most embarrassing moment wasone day when one of my friends andL were in town together. We wentInto a store and my friend bought atoothbrush. The storekeeper wrappedIt up und we started out of the store.He said somethiDg.
