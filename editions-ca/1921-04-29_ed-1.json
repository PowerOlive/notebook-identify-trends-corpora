. The Presbyterial Auxiliary of j
the Ebenezer Presbytery was in ses
sion here Tuesday and Wednesday.
About forty delegates were present.
There was a business meeting Tues
day afternoon, and Tuesday night
there were two addresses by Mr.
Grafton, a missionary from China,
and Mr. Errickson, of the Phelps j
School. Wednesday the regular rou
tine of business was taken up, the
meeting continuing during the day.
A delightful lunch was served at
noon.
At the last service of the pro
tracted meeting Sunday night at the
Methodist church the large audito
rium and lecture room was more
than full, some were compelled to
stand. There were one hundred
and eighteen conversions, some of
them being reclaimed, and fifty-two
'who took membership to the various
churches. In the Sunday school con
test which has been in progress for.
the past two weeks the Bible was
awarded to the Baptist Sunday
School, they having made a gain of
one hundred and sixty-three per
cent. Our people were well pleased
with the work of these evangelists.
Our community was shocked
Monday jmorning when it was learned
that Mrs. S. C. Bascom, who had
nndergone an operation at the Nor
ton Infirmary at Louisville on last
Friday, was in a critical condition,
Dr. C. B. Smith and her little
daughter, Miss Sue Bascom, were
called to her bedside Sunday. Her
husband, Mr. S. C. Bascom, had
been with her since the operation.
Late Sunday evening her .brother,
Mr. M. C. Grimes, received a tele
gram to the effect that her condi
tion was critical. Mr. Grimes start
ed for Louisville early Monday
morning, but did not arrive there
mntil after her death. Mrs. Bascom
has been a patient sufferer for sev
eral months. The early part of last
week she consented to an operation
which she was advised by physicians
to have had piade a year ago. On
Thursday she was taken to Norton
Infirmary, Louisville, by her hus
Tnd. accompanied by her physician,
Dr. C. B. Smith. The operation took
place Friday morning. She did not
improve from the operation, and on
Sunday began sinking rapidly, dy
ing at 6:10 a. m.
Mrs. Bascom was formerly Miss
Xula Grimes, oldest daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. J. A. Grimes, and was
one of sir children, her parents hav
ing died several years ago. She is
survived T)y one sister, Mrst Halph
Miller of Cincinnati, four brothers,
Tr. J. A. Grimes, of Wisconsin,
William Grimes, of Atlanta, Ga., J.
H and M. G. Grimes, of Millers
Tjiirg. When quite a young woman
she was united in marriage to Mr. S.
C Bascom, of Owingsville, where
they resided for a short time. After
this Mr. Bascom purchased the
farm of the late J. H. Hamilton,
where they resided for a few years.
They then moved to Millersburg,
where thev have resided for the past
ten years. She was a graduate of
the M. F. C. and a devout member
of the Christian church, and one of
the most ardent supporters of the
new Millersburg Graded School.
A short funeral service was con
ducted at the home Wednesday at
10:00 a. m., by her pastor, Elder W,
J. Slater, after which the remains
were taken to Owingsville, where
they were laid to rest on the Bascom
family lot in the Owingsville Cem
etery The floral tributes were nu
merous and beautiful, which attested
the high esteem in which the de
ceased was 'held, by her faniliy and
relatives.
. -o
POLITICAL CONTROL DANGEROUS
With one ear open to the indus
trial demands of the country, ani
another listening to the clamor of
-the rural communities for an elec
tric service on the farms that will
approach the general use of the tel
ephones, electrical engineers have es
timated that it will take four million
of dollars to satisfy the public de
mands for electric development in
the next four year. If this amount
of capital shell be enlisted into the
regulatory bodies the investing
public will feel secure in its income
and capital return.

widow of the late Harvey A. Rogerj,

Concentration of mind is largely a
result of necessity and practice.
Some mentalities can, of course, fix
themselves on a certain subject un
disturbed by surrounding conditions
much easier than : others, but the
habit can be and is readily acquired.
Stenographers must have it or they
could not take dictation correctly.
Persons proficient in this art with
draw themselves from consciousness
of other sounds than the voice of the
speaker whejm they are reporting.
Perhaps there is no more intense or
wearing mental application than that
of a shorthand reporter of a public
address of any length, especially if
complete verbal accuracy is required.
Attention must not falter for an in
stant. Officer stenographers are not
usually put to severe and prolonged
tests, but the "taking" of letters per
mits no wandering of the mind.
n
RUBBISH AND LITTER
All refuse should be kept in men
tal containers and removed at fre
quent intervals. Accumulations of
rubbish are always dangerous, since
they provide convenient fuel for the
chanee spark, and when there is oily
matter present, there is the addi
tional likelihood of spontaneous com
bustion. Such piles are also, a men
ace to health.
