Unless something is done in the near future,there is an even chance that if Parisis represented in the Blue Grass League during the season of 1913, it willbe with a team that will be a disgrace,not only to the profession but to thecity.Last season the club, making a badbeginning, finished with a heavy debtoverhanling, and it the baseball season begins in Paris this year it will beunder the most adverse circumstances.To begin with there is .nothing leftof the club that hnished the season lastj ear. Practically all the players ofany consequence have been sold, somaat fair prices, while others were disposed of for the purpose of raising afund with which to begin the sason.To begin with the treasury is depletedmd the club is heavily in debt. Withall the purchase money in hand it willstand more than $1,800 to the bad.g There should be more interest in theclub ti.is teason than Ust.for a numberof reasons, and unless there is somedisposition shown on the part of thefans to boost for the ball club 'herewill be none. President J. W. Baconis of the opinion that to begin the season would be nothing short of foolhardiness, while others agree that thisseason should be profitable owing tothe fact thr.t not only the Paris clubbut others in the Blue Grass sufferedfinancial losses last year.The mailing of contracts to playersin reserve will begin about February1. Paris should not be without a representative m this league and shouldby all means begin the season. Letthe fans gets together now while thereis plenty of time and begin boostingfor the club. We can have a cood oneif the proper spirit is displayed by xhefans so let everyone begin with" thatob.iect in view.Odd Curtains.At very low prices during Frank &fCos Big Sale.Narrow Escape from Drowning.J. W. Culbertson, residing in thiscity, had a narrow escape from deathSaturday afternoon when he attempted to cross a stream about gone-halfmile from Little Rock, and had it notbeen for the timely assistance of several men in the neignborhood he wouldhave drowned.Culbertson, who is engaged in thesale of phonographs and supplies, wastraveling in a buggy and when he attempted to cross the little stream nearLittle Rock which was out of its banksas a result nf the heavy rains, the vehicle was swept down the stream bythe swift current, carrying the horoand driver with it.In the middle of the stream the buggy turned over, throwing Culbertsonout and it was with nreat difficultythat he kept his head above the water.His cries for help attracted severalmen in the neighborhod who went tohis rescue, bringing him to shore. Hewas almost exhausted and for a time itwas thought his condition was seiious.He was taken to the residence of Mr.Clarence Walls nearby where restoratives were applied and he was soun revived. The horse succeeded in breaking away from the buggy and gainedthe shore about a quarter of a mile below where the attempt was made tocross the stream. vSecondFlood DoesDamage.MuchContinuous rains which fell foralmost'thirty-six hours caused one ofthe largest floods this section has exDerienced in several years. The rainbegan falling Friday and continued unceasingly until an early hour Sundaymorning, when a decided drop in thetemperature put a stop to the deluge.As a result of the heavy downpourboth Houston and Stoner creeks running through this city, were out oftheir banks, overflowing the lowlandsand inundating cellars of residences located in the lower section of the city.Farms along the streans were badlywashed by the high water and muchdamage was done to fencing. Reportsfrom Millersburg Saturday night wereto the effect that the town was practically cut off from traffic for severalhours, owing to the overflowing ofHinkston creek. The raging creekoverflowed and submerged a section ofthe pike near the citv renderingtravel impossible. Two negro menwho were returning from Carlisleto Paris had a narrow escape fromdrowning when they drove "into theswollen stream.Introduces Bill to RecoverDamages.Hon. J. C. Cantrill, Representativefrom the Seventh Congressional Uistrict.on Friday introduced in the Housea bill for the relief oE the Fiscal CourtofBourbon county. The biM is to recoverdamages sustained by.Bourbon countyduring the Civil War, when Paris wasoccupied by Union troops. The military forces occupied the court house.The bill prays for a compensation of$2,000 and was referred to the committee on war claims.

In Lyons there are manystreets paved with glass blocks, thesebeing adjusted so perfectly that wateris not able to pass between them. Itis said that the glass pavement has agreater resistance than stone and is abad conductor of heat, for which reason ice does not form readily on thesurface. Moreover, it is beyond question more durable than stone, it ischeaper and more easily portable, andit offers neither interstices nor hollows where mud can lodge.In Germany, near Frankfort, thereis a factory for the manufacture ofcrystal telegraph poles. In order togive better solidity to the crystal massof the posts they carry a frameworkof thick wire. These posts are betterthan wood because they perfectly resist the attacks of insects and are impervious to atmospheric influences.Dresses made of crystal threadhave been known for some time.Dresses of spun crystal have a brilliancy like silk. Curtains, carpets,mantles, and relatively fine texturesgenerally are being made of crystal,while factories are going up in variousparts of western Europe for the furthering of this industry.

On the other hand,real silk costs at least $8.40 a kilo toproduce.The effect of this competition isshown by the falling off in the production of silk. The number of silk wormraisers has declined since 1892 from119,000 to 102,000, and the product hasdeclined 40 per cent, to only 425,000kilos.Appeals to the law are being madeby the silk growers, who saw that theuse of the word "artificial" in connection with silk is not enough to protectthem against ruinous competition.English Writer Accords Honors tol1 Those He Deems Have Made TheirNames Worthy of Mention."Doubtless," writes Clement Shorter, in the Strand, "there are manyJgreat men living today men withjprospective greatness but only time)can decide. In my judgment, there is'no man in the world today who is!great in any walk of life in so strik-lIng a way that his contemporaries canunhesitatingly proclaim him great.History has proclaimed the elder Pitt1a great man, but not so certainly hisson. It has assigned this epithet to,Palmerston or Peel, and it is too early'yet to decide whether it will concede)it to Gladstone or Disraeli. The greatman is surely he who ,by force oft:nius, has impressed himself uponhis age in some permanent form.Whether the achievements of Mr.Roosevelt or of Emperor William areof this character had better be decided a century hence. As you askme, however, to join in what canscarcely be a serious discussion, I sug-:gest that we take the name of a'living man from each country whohas, by invention or creation, stamp-;ed himself upon his age. I thereforenominate the ten greatest men of thepresent day as follows:"Great Britain, Thomas Hardy;Great Britain, Lord Lister; United,States, Thomas A. Edison; Italy,Guglielmo Marconi; Italy, GiacomoiPuccini; France, Francois Coppee;Austria, Richard Strauss; Germany,"Hermann Sudermann; Belgium, Mau-'rice Maeterlinck; Russia, Elie Metch-nikoff."MADE MATTER OF NECESSITY'According to This, There Is LittleDoubt About Colored Man's Liking for Chickens.Wedding Ring.Most people know that the reasonthe wedding ring is put on the fourthlinger of the left hand is said to bebecause the first two fingers and thethumb were counted all as fingers,and therefore as three. The thumbused to be the ring finger anciently-,and the seal rings of those in authority were placed on this first short,thick finger, the most useful of thehand. The wedding ring is the modern descendant of this old-time thumbring and was removed to the fourthfinger in this way: The first threewere named for the three persons ofthe Trinity, and at the word amen,after the naming of the three, thering reached the fourth finger and wasleft there. In reality, the ring fingeris the safest place for it.There is another and less pleasantorigin, too, for the wedding ring. Theold rings were the mark of bondageas well as of dignity.In the endeavor to uplift the race, afriend of ours started in by trying tosmash silly old superstitions. Ourfriend believes that negroes are maligned, and that many of the stockjokes about them are not founded onfact. He has, in fact, succeeded inproving that a number of the old minstrel standbys are mere senselessjests. And the other day he interviewed the elevator boy in his officebuilding."Arthur," he said, "there's a silly oldsaying that you colored people arecrazy about chickens. I can't see howthat started. Do you like chicken?""Yassah.""Of course almost everybody likeschickens. I mean to say, do you likeit better than anything else in theworld? Do you like it so well that youwould steal it if you couldn't obtainit honestly?""Boss, I likes chicken so well dat ifI couldn't git it no other way, I'd buyit!" Cleveland Plain Dealer.The Gentleman.Carlyle said of Robert Burns thatthere was no truer gentleman in Europe than the plowman poet. It wasbecause he loved everything themouse and the daisy, and all thethings, great and -small, that God hadmade. So with this simple passporthe could mingle with any society, andenter courts and palaces from hislittle cottage on the banks of the Ayr.You know the meaning of the word"gentleman." It means a gentle mana man who does things gently withlove. And that is the whole art andmystery of it. The gentleman cannotin the nature of things do an ungentle, an ungentlemanly thing. Theungentle soul, the inconsiderate, unsympathetic nature cannot do anything else. Henry Drummond.Changed Times.Miss Mary Donnelly "Our Mary"the New York suffragist, said at thesuffrage lunch rooms:"I was walking the other week inLong Island. The sky was blue. Thecrystal air was pure and frosty. Thetrees were painted with autumnal colors gold, and pink, and raw red. Howbeautiful it was!"In a meadow a half dozen youngwomen were practicing putting. Theylooked very smart in their trim golfsuits, their, skirts of rough homespun,and their scarlet jackets. As I watched them, an old farmer and one of hisfarm hands approached. 'Boss,' grumbled the farm hand, 'them girls in themedder is scarin' our cows.'"The old farmer shook his head andsighed." 'Ah, Timothy,' he said, with profound truth, 'times is changed sinceI was young. In them days the cowsscared the gals.' "Didn't Improve Situation.There was a certain master of foxhounds in one of the English shireswho was greatly angered by the awkwardness of one of the gentlemen whoinvariably rode over the hounds. Atone of the meets the M. F. H. rodeup to the awkward hunter and, in themost chilling tones, said: "Mr. So-and-so,there are two dogs in the pecktoday, Snap and Tatters, which I amespecially fond of and I would esteemit a favor if you would avoid killing ormaiming them with your horse'shoofs." "Certainly, my dear fellow,"replied Mr. So-and-so, "but, as I do notknow them will you be kind enough toput tags on them for me."Parents Object to Sunday School.The falling off in attendance In theSunday schools, which was the subject of a discussion at the conventionof the New York County SundaySchool association, was referred to bya layman after the meeting had adjourned as "a progressive disease"and that the Presbyterian Sundayschools are not the only ones wherethere had been a falling off "from 21to 34 per cent." "To a great extent,"he said, "the condition is the resultof too much school work. Parentssay that after a strenuous week atschool the child should have work ofno kind on Sunday. That's the excuse of those parents who seldom goto church because of golf and motorcars and there are thousands ofthem." New York Tribune.Master of Languages.Sir, Charles Eliot, the new principalof Hong-Kong university, is forty-sevenyears old and speaks 23 languagesfluently. For many years he was inthe diplomatic service and to everycountry to which he was sent he mastered the language, beginning withRussia in 1887. In 1889 he broughtout a Finnish grammar. During hiscourse at Oxford he had not onlyswept the board of all the classicaldistinctions within reach, but, whilestill an undergraduate, had won theBoden Sanskrit scholarship and theSyriac-prize. ' -. .Old Proverbs About Apples.No fruit has played a more important part in sacred or profane historythan the apple, of which Solomonmade good use in his proverbs, "stolen apples are sweet," and 'a word fitlyspoken is like apples of gold in pic-i tures of silver."A good many English doctors prescribe an apple for either the first orlast meal. The Dutch equivalent forour "two birds with one stone" is"two apples with one s;ick," and theorigin in the saying. "A windy year,an apple year," dates back to the daysof the Norman.Postage Into Arctic Circle.A rural mail carrier with a dogteam left Edmonton, in western Canada, last week over a route whichprobably is the longest in the world.He will journey many hundred mileswithin the Arctic Circle, and will notreturn until shortly before the thawnext spring.His mail will be made up of letttersexclusively, no newspapers or parcelsbeing accepted.Women in middle age often complain of hot Hashes. They are at that stageoflife when their delicate organism naeds a tonic and helping-hand which onlyDr.Pierce's Favorite Prescription can give them.

Reviewing J. A.Spender's book, "The Indian Scene,"the London Spectator says:To those who have not seen Indiathe descriptive chapters of "The Indian Scene" will be of very great interest. Mr. Spender is content to describe what he saw in the simplestway, and by this means gives the reader a strong sense of the reality ofwhat he is told. Nowhere is this donewith more completeness than in theopening chapter on Bombay. Whatstrikes him is not the place so muchas the people. Every street swarmswith them, and "no half dozen seemalike." Their color varies from whiteto very nearly black, their costume"from the frock coat to the loincloth."Then there is the contrast betweenlife and death, between the rich Parsee living in his pretentious stonebuilt house on the seashore, and thesame man carried, as soon as he hasclosed his eyes, to the towers of silence, with their "obscene semicirclesof vultures sitting huddled togetheron the rims of the two pits waiting fortheir next meal." And then there isthe fact more separating races perhaps than any other feature of Indianlife that into the vast majority ofhouses which "to all outward seemingmight be the homes of European nouveaux riches," no European has everentered or ever will enter. He mustnot see the women who live in them.When a shuttered or curtained carriage passes him for the first time inthe street, he is told that a woman isinside, and that is his nearest approach to knowledge of one-half of Indian life.When he leaves Bombay Mr. Spender, does his best to answer the simple question, What does India looklike? Somewha1- north of Baroda heopens the shutters of his sleeping carriage and at first seps nothing to tellA Primitive Substitute for the WaterCart. Native Method of Wateringa Road.him that he is not in Europe. Thecountry is flat, it has many trees, it iscut up into small fields and very closely cultivated. It is the human elementand the animal element that make itunlike Europe the women "swathedin crimson muslin," the children "either naked or fantastically dressed up,the thin walnut colored men, withwhite turbans .and bare legs, the bigloose limbed donkeys who pass in akind of ambling gallop," the humpbacked cattle, "mild miniature beasts,"the straight-backed lead colored buffaloes. Then comes a railway stationand a fresh "riot of color and fancy."Opposite the carriage stands a venerable gentleman in bright green flowered silk dressing gown, with a pink turban and white pajamas; near himthere is a woman "in a shapeless massof orange cotton," a tiny child, "withembroidered coat and absurd littlebuff trousers ending in red shoes,"and an old man who crowns a grayfrock coat with a crimson turban, andwraps his legs In "a careless swatheof white muslin." Mr. Spender's, trainwas delayed for ten minutes because aparty of ladies had to be got out. Animmense sheet was held in front oftheir carriage, in which they weresomehow enwrapped, and the groupwas left "standing like a great, whitebox in the middle of the platform."12 RICH WOMEN ON A JURYCourt Officer in Kansas Makes Up anOdd Panel for a Case of Disorderly Conduct.Independence, Kan. Twelve of thewealthiest and most prominent womenof this city were summoned to serveon a jury in the case of James Blue,charged with firing a shot throughthe window of an interburban carnear her, endangering the lives of thepassengers.

Five donkeys weremade the performers at a "night inArabia" in the party given at one ofthe fashionable cafes and their braying annoyed the neighbors.Women Spend Their Time PlayingCards, Listening to ProfessionalStory-Tellers and EatingPerfume Baths Taken.Constantinople. Hospitality amongthe Turks is carried to a fine art. Ashort time ago it was my privilege,writes a correspondent, to spend someweeks in the harem of the son-in-lawof one of Turkey's greatest generals,whose leg, shot off in the battle ofPlevna, was buried in a cemetery sideby side with the body of his grandchild." My hostess knew nothing butTurkish. She was young, beautifuland happy. Sixty slaves were alwaysready to do her bidding not slavesin our sense of the word, but morelike adopted children.The square, spacious house stood ina lovely, garden, and was divided intotwo portions, one-half (the haremilk)occupied by women and the otheihalf (the salamlik) by men. Thesofas and chairs in the drawing-roomwere covered with red and yellowsilk, and here ladies and slaves, allwearing loose garments like dressinggowns, sat for hours chatting or playing cards or backgammon, or listening to the tales of the miradjus, theprofessional women story-tellers. Theyhave no regular hours for mealssnacks of food being brought to themat all hours. They did not sit at tablein the dining-room, where the host entertained his friends and where foreign ladies were admitted.Visits to a harem are looked uponas an indefinite thing. Some of theladies staying in the house had arrived with a small bundle of clothesfor a few days and had stayed onmore than a year. On an embroidered carpet in one corner of the rooma large tray on short legs held allcourses of each meal, placed there before the repast began.

Oone of the acts of themeon and religion forward movementhas been to revive a once popularaong about a "little brown church inthe vale." The church itself that inspired the song bade fair to suffereclipse, but was preserved throughthe sentimental regard of its oldfriends, as The Congregationalist(Boston) tells us:"Some forty or fifty years ago asong known as 'The Little BrownChurch in the Vale caught the popular fancy and literally went aroundthe world. The president of the National Music Teachers association belonging to a sturdy Scotch familyused to join heartiJy with his sevenbrothers in singing the song with nothought that any particular churchwas meant. Later, he was astonishedto learn that the veritable 'LittleBrown Church' was not far from hisIowa home. It is a real church, aCongregational church, and is at Brad-X i$&$gZ$S?iLittle Brown Church in the Vale.Which inspired the popular song of fiftyyears ago.ford in northern Iowa. Some pioneersin northern Iowa met for worship ina log house for some time and finallyorganized a church. In 1859 Rev. J.K. Nutting became pastor and it wasdetermined to erect a house of worship. This required much sacrifice,for all were poor and there was, actually, almost no money in circulation. Those sturdy farmers made theframe from timber growing along theCedar river. The boards for the siding and what hardware was used hadto be hauled over the corduroy roadsand through swamps from McGregor,sixty miles away. The dedication wasa great event. Many people droveforty miles to be present. The churchprospered and soon after BedfordAcademy was erected so that the community became an educational and religious center. When the railroadcame, it ran on the opposite side ofthe river. Nashua sprang up andgradually the people moved to thenew town and Bradford disappearedfrom the map. The academy buildingIs going to decay, but sentiment hasprompted the people to preserve 'TheLittle Brown Church, and it is in agood state of repair. Dr. W. S. Pittswas one of the pioneers that came under the influence of this church inthe early days and he did more thanany one else to make it known.DOCKING WASTE !S HUGENew York Commission Seeks BetterHandling of Perishable FoodLoss Is $200,000,000.New York. As a step toward thesolution of the problem of the highcost of living Mayor Gaynor's market commission hopes to find someway of providing better terminal facilities for handling perishable produce. It is estimated that under thepresent docking system there is anannual waste of $200,000,000. This isdemonstrated by the report of condemnations made by order of the NewYork board of health, showing thatlast year 500,000 pounds of fruitswere destroyed; 2,500,000 pounds ofvegetables, 73,000 pounds of eggs,350,000 pounds of fish and 95,000pounds of miscellaneous market products. The condemnations made by the100 inspectors of the health department represent only a small fractionof the real waste in the markets ofthe city. The waste in handling eggsis estimated at 10 per cent., or $50,000,000 a year, and the loss in poultryis more than $25,000,000.PRIEST FINDS 5 $1,000 BILLSPerson Who Left the Big FundPoqr of New York Parish IsUnidentified.forNew York.
