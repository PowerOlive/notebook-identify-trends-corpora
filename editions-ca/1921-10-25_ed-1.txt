Itaiight be well to ask why the growerwas paid only 1 to 3 cents for hislow grades last year and why thespeculators were paid 10 to 20 centsfor these same low grades within afew months. It does seem that anyfarmer who has brains enough togrow tobacco also has sense enoughto know that promises of good pricesthis year are only made to keep thegrower out of the organization andthat any advance in price this year"will be deducted from the, price nextyear. The tobacco growers now havean opportunity to put their businesson a prosperous basis for years tocome and it is worse than foolishnessto sell a permanent birthright forthe promise of a temporary mess ofpottage.FILE EXPENSE ACCUNTSAll candidates for district, county,school and city offices are requiredby law to file their expense accountsbetween October 24 and 28.

Without rest the bloodcannot get back to normal, so thatit becomes clogged with waste matter from over-exertion.The clogged blood virtually withers the body. The strained looks onpale faces, the thin, bloodless arms,the sunken cheeks and necks, thedead-tired feeling, are the results ofstale blood depriving the system oflife-giving oxygen.Workers go to the drug store andget Gude's Pepto-Mangan when theyfeel weak and run down They takeit in either the liquid or the tabletform.

Verily it is a joy to ride upon.But, how long will it remain withus? Not long, unless it is anchored.The State Road Department informsus that they will accept the road,when it was put in as good condition'as it was before.' That means, wetake it, that the State will applythe anchor, in the form of oil andgravel binder. But will it be finished in time for such 'binder' to beapplied this year? If it is not, thenmost of the present beautiful surfaceof Our model road will be enriching'that good red soil' between Carlisleand Millersburg, when the rains andwinds of bleak December and bleaker January and February, not tomention the thaws of March, haveworked their will upon it.
