Associate Editors.
The newspaper man is blamed for a
whole lot of things he can't help such
as using partiality in mentioning
visitors, giving news about some folks
and leaving others out. etc., says the
Mason Leader. He simply prints all
the news he can find. Some people
inform him about such things and
others do not. An editor should not be
expected to know the names and resi
dence of all your uncles, aunts and
cousins, even if h should see them get
on or oft the boat. Tell us about it.
It's news that makes the newspaper,
and every man, woman and child can
be associate editors if they only will.
Never apologize when you give this
bit of information to an editor, for if
there live3 one so dear that he has
lost his apprecia'.ion of such favors,
heis dead, indeed, toevery yritsse thst !

Will ProW Allen County Lyich
int.-
The investigation being made of the
killing ofJWood Ayres by a mob near
Scottsville, Allen county, will not be
resumed. It has been arranged by the
authorities to prepare the case and
await developments until the May
ter.ro of the grand jury, at which time
the whole matter will be submitted to
that body for full and final investiga
tion. It is reported that other evi
dences, which might indicate that per
sons might have been lying in wait for
more than one day for Ayre3, have
been brought to light. Sardine boxes,
pieces of cheese, etc., have been found
in an old house near the scene of the
shooting, so that it has been determin
ed to postpone the hearing until all
evidence has been found.
It is now thought by some that the
mob came from across line in Warren
county. The persons for whom war
rants have been sworn out came to
Scottsville gave bond, waived examin
ing trial and await the action of Cir
cuit Court.

The Cincinnati Post says:
4 4 A campaign to force women to re
move their hats in nickel theatres was
launched Tuesday by Attocrney Nicho
las Klein and three of his friends,
who declare views are obstructed by
the new style of "Dingaling" head
gear, as well a3 by the old "Merry
Widow'; hats.
44Klein and the others visited mana
gers of moving picture shows Tuesday
and served notice on them that unless
the managers force the women to take
off their hats warrants will be taken
out in Fohce Court for the arrest
the managers.
Its up to the managers,' say3
Klein, 'and that i3 the reason we are
going after them. They can have their
employes tell wemen to take off their
hats and they can see that their orders
are enforced. 'j"

The recant sale of the saddle tone
stallion. Cloud King, sayi (Sparta of
the Times. New York, is urely evi
dence of the present popularity of this
style of norae. There is no deaying
that the demand for good saddle horses
with a suitatble conformation, style,
temperament and gaits is exceedingly
by the supply. This style of horse has
become extremely popular, and has
grown in favor since the automobile
has come into the market. Riding in
the saddle has been taken up by both
sexes. Even the children are found
enjoying the delight and pleasure gain
ed from the saddle horse. At the Dur
Iand Riding Academy the ring every
dry and evening is thronged with
adults and children enjoying tne
healthful exercise, while the bridle
path3 in Central Park are also well
patronized bj the more experienced
riders.
Albert De Cernea. Manager of Dur
land's.finds it dirucult to keep the sup
ply of saddle horses equal to the de
mand. There is'no reason "to worry about
the future of the saddle and high step
ping harness horse if we judge from
present conditions which are in better
shape at present than any time 3ince
the gasoline macihne became a vehicle
for road use.
Cut Flowers.
Cut flowers and funeral designs of
all kinds and all prices.
