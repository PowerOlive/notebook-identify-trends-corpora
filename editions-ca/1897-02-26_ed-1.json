IT CANNOT BE
The dying lips of a dear friend
At parting spoke to me
Saying Wheresoeer your path may trend
There ewr I shall be
Go walk where over Egypts sand
The burning simooms blow
Or in Alaskas sunless land
Your wake my wing shall know
When winters nights are long and dark
Ill lead you by the hand
And when the waves beat on your hark
Will beacon you to land
He died I watched his spirit go
Across deaths darkening sea
He came not back and now I know
Of things that cannot be

PLACE NAMES
Some Odd and Curious Karnes of Places
In Massachusetts
In the Middlesex fells some good old
colonial names are preserved like Jin
glejerry hill and Shillyshally brook
Spot pond was named by Governor
Winthrop who discovered it in the win
ter beoause of the many rocks that
showed through the ice and spotted the
surface Powderhorn hill in Chelsea is
said to have been bought from the In
dians for a hornful of powder
The fact of misfortune to divers un
known persons whether trivial or great
does not appear finds a record in Bad
Luok brook and swamp in Behoboth
Bad Luck mountain in Granville and
Bad Luck pond in Douglas There may
become association between Burncoat
brook and pond in Leicester and Spencer
and Burnshirt river likewise in Worces
ter county
Drinkwater river is a felicitous name
for a stream of good water It is in
Hanover and possibly there may have
been a family of that name in the neigh
borhood Strong Water brook in Tewks
bury has quite different associations
Sought For pond in Westford suggests
a long and baffled quest for the spot
through the wilderness in the olden
days One of the least euphonious of
names is Skug river in Essex and Mid
dlesex counties It is worthy a place
among such English names as Worm
wood Scrubs a park in London
The legend about the names of the
group of islands on the south coast pre
sents an instance of how fancied resem
blances give rise to stories It is related
that these islands once belonged to a
man with four daughters To Nancy
the oldest the father gave the first
choice and the fact that Nan took it
is recorded in the name of Nantucket
the island she selected Nantucket of
course is in reality an Indian name
Marthas Vineyard and the Elizabeth
islands went to Martha and Elizabeth
respectively while for the fourth daugh
ter whose name has been lost to mem
ory there was nothing left but the most
remote and undesirable of the group
which was oalled No Mans Land be
cause its owner was a woman The
Elizabeth islands in fact were named
for Queen Elizabeth by Bartholomew
Sosnold their discoverer whoja name
has been given to the town that com
prises them Boston Transcript
Mailing Candy Abroad
A young man who apparently knows
a girl in London came into the offioe the
other day and asked whether candy
could be sent abroad through the mails
So he was taken over to the postofiice
and the state of affairs was laid before
an official who instigated an investiga
tion After a long time he returned and
reported as follows
I am very glad said he that you
asked that question Its answer shows
a curious state of affairs In this coun
try you can send candy up to 4 pounds
as merchandise for 1 cent for each
ounce If you want to send candy
abroad you only have to pay 1 cent for
every 2 ounces but you can only send
12 ounces in each package If it weighs
more than 12 ounces you have to pay
letter rates or 10 cents an ounce for the
whole thing
That is to say you can send 10
ounces to London for 5 cents but it
would cost you 10 cents to send it to
Brooklyn So if you are thinking of
sending a pound it will cost you 160
The stamp department is right over
there
Thank you very much said the
young man I just happen to remem
ber that the doctor has forbidden the
girl to eat candy New York Mail

Senator Wilson of Washington and
his brother Harry Wilson look very
much alike One day in Spokane where
the two brothers live Senator Wilson
who had just returned from his legisla
tive duties was stopped on the street by
a man who had known him for years
Harry said the man when will
your brother John be here
In a day or two said John with
out a smile
Tell him I want to seevhim on an
important matter
Certainly said John
And you will not forget it
Ill try not promised John and
thus another office seeker was foiled
