ANTI-RACE BETTING BILL
NOT REPORTED.
That the Simms-Sterling bill pro
hibiting the inter-state transmis
sion of racing results will not be
reported by the committee at this
session of Congress was learned
Saturday. The bill, which has been,
fought vigorously by horse breed
ing and racing interests on the
ground that its passage would prac
tically put an end to racing and
thoroughbred hoise breeding, wjll
repose quietly in a pigeonhole of the
House Committee of Intai state and
Foreign Commerce during the re
cess of adjournment of Congress.
It is very doubtful whether a re
port will be made upon the measure
at any time, but certainly no report
is in sight now.
