Trained Pigeons
Pigeons are carefully trained The
young homer is taken half a mile the
first day a mile the second two miles
the third and so on doubling the dis
tance each time It must be liberated
each time only in the same direction as
to its loft for a bird can be trained
along only one route at a time When
40 miles have been reached a weeks
rest comes between A hundred miles
are enough for a young birds first year
So essential is the training that old
birds are taken only two miles out for
the first lesson of a season though they
may have flown their 250 miles the
year preceding The end of the next
season however will if the birds are
willing and the trainer patient De
crowned by the accomplishment of a
400 mile flight As you get higher in
the scale of distance longer and longer
rests are needed
Male birds are generally used for
long distances Family matters are apt
to engross the attention of the hen
though she is still capable of goodwTork
when she has a mind for it Good
Words
As to the Iiinks
There is no more ardent evolutionist
in the city and np more persistent ad
vocate M Darwins theory than Dr
dAncona His friend Dr de Marville
on the other hand is a great bird fan
cier and devotes ail his spare time to an
enthusiastic study of ornithology
I have a splendid specimen of a
monkey in my office remarked Dr
dAncona proudly Come in and see
him he continued being a firm be
liever in the object method of demon
stration You will admit tlut I have
the missing link in a cage
Thats all right replied De Mar
ville absorbed in his own pet hobby
I have a cage at home myself and
something in it too Youre not in it
and neither i your monkey I can show
you something much better than your
missing link I have got a bobolink
San Francisco News Letter
Prioleau and Calhoun
The Pendletonians were justly proud
of Mr Calhoun and sensitive as to the
impression which he made upon stran
gers When Judge Prioleau became a
resident they were anxious to know
his impressions of their Ajax When
they first met as soon as Calhoun left
the table the question was eagerly
asked How do you like him
Not
reply
at all was the newcomers
I desire never to meet him
again This was a sad rebuff and an
explanation was demanded I hate a
man who makes me think so much
the judge replied For the last three
hours I have been on the stretch trying
to follow him through heaven and
earth I feel wearied with the effort
and I hate a man who makes me feel
my own inferiority Pendleton was
appeased Exchange
Good but Not Intended
Now and then a man gets off a good
thing and does not know it An in
stance is noted by Sir M Grant Duff in
his Diary
We began to talk about the fog It
was so bad I said a week or two
ago that I hear Farrar preached against
it at St Margarets
It was at that church my friend
answered that a clergyman denounc
ing Mr Tooth the ritualist said I
will not name him but his name is in
everybodys mouth Then seeing the
smiles on the face 3 of his congregation
he turned scarlet
The Earths Shadow
The earth has a shadow but very
few ever see it except in eclipses of the
moon or else few recognize it when
they see it Nevertheless many of 11s
have noticed on fine cloudless even
ings in summer shortly before sunset a
rosy or pink aro on the horizon opposite
the sun with a bluish gray segment
under it As the sun sinks the arc rises
until it attains the zenith and even
passes it This is the shadow of the
earth

or Government Money
At close of aur Civil War in 1865
there appeared in the London Times
the following
If that miscbievous financial pol
icy which had its origin in the North
American Republic during the late
Civil War in that country should be
come indurated down to a fixture
then that government will furnish its
money without cost It will have all
the money that is necessary to carry
cm its trade and commerce It will
become prosperous beyond precedent
in the history of cirvilized nations of
the world The brain and wealth of
ail countries will go to North America
THAT GOVERNMENT MUST BE
DESTROYED OR IT WILL DE
STROY EVERY MONARCHY ON
THIS GLOBE
The famous Hazzaird circular to
capitalists in New Yorkr and the Buell
Bank circular to United States Bank
ers both emanating from London and
the fabulous corruotioni fund raised in
England and Germany estimated at
1500000 were the agents that se
cured the closing of our saints against
silver
The- walk into my parlor policy
of England during and since the
Spanish War is the latest evidence
of English Diplomacy in shaping the
destiny of the United States Govern
ment
Notwithstanding famine price
of wheat the Spanish War and fabu
lous expenditures of money by our
government during the past year gold
has increased in value eleven per cent
and all other values decreased in the
same proportion
For a thorough understanding of
the money question or silver issue
the Cincinnati Enquirer has uniformly
given evidence of its abihty to teach
explain and produce all facts and
truth It is a paper that ought and
can be read by all classes with pleas
ure and profit
