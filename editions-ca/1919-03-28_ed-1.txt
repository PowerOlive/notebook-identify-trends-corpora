Yet that difference of a fewcents just as frequently is caused bythe limited knowledge of the housewife of the meat which she desires.Take the cost of mutton and lamb.It is regarded as high. But the average house-wife who so regards itspeaks only in terms of chops andhind-quarters. The fore-quarter ofmutton is just as dainty, just as fullo flavor, just as eatable in every wayif it is .properly prepared. It also ismany cents cheaper per pound."Your butcher, if he is up-to-date,knows how to bone and roll ashoulder of lamb or mutton so thatit may be cut into Saratoga chops ormade intoa roast of unusual-sweetness.--Breeders of sheep have paid moreattention -to raising a better flavoredmeat in the last few years, and theirefforts 'show clearly in the resultingproduct.Some objectors to lamb and mutton say that they cannot eat it because of the "woolly taste," and thatthey .know of no .way to remvoe it.That is merely a case of pulling thewool over your own eyes.

This patriotictesting of corn saved the day andKentucky had a good crop of corn., America isnot at .war and thechances are that "there is" an abundance of good seed corn in the State.However, each individual farmerdoes not know how good his seedcorn happens to be so he should begin testing to be certain.

The fertile dark lands in theCorn Belt of. Illinois and Iowa havelong sold for ?200 per acre, but beneath what was once considered thepoorest land in Illinois' have beenfound deposits of coal worth manythousands of dollars per acre.The black waxy lands of Texasreached $100 per acre while the saltdomes on the gulf coast were stillconsidered worthless wastes. No onedreamed then, what all know now,that these salt domes concealed thegreatst oil pool in the world.The cunning white man picked outthe best looking lands of Oklahomafor himself, forcing "Poor Lo" totake the "leavings," little dreamingthat he was making millionaires ofwhole Redskin tribes.Visitors coming from the North andEast have looked upon the JBlueGrass region of Kentucky and pronounced it the supreme beauty spotof the world. Because of their productivity and attractiveness, landsaround Lexington, Paris, Winchester,Versailles and smaller towns, havemounted in price to $100, ?200, $300,$400, $500 per acre.It would have been impossible afew years ago, and is not easy nowto cinvince the average man that anacre of Kentucky mountain land isworth as much as an acre of BlueGrass soil. Few would believe thatthe sand cliffs and rugged mountaingorges of Estill, Lee and Breathittwere worth as much as the fields ofwaving blue grass in Fayette orBourbon. But the discovery of oiland coal has wrought a wonderfultransformation and many mountainacres that sold a few years ago for$5 and $10 are bringing $1,000 nowfor the oil lease only. The flow ofliquid gold from the sand domes ofEestern Kentucky has enabled manya land-poor mountaineer to leave hisrock-ribbed mountain farm and takeup his abode on a Blue Grass farm.j o-" - 'jABBnBOciE,ac-ca9i?lWINS0MELY PRETTYSpring Suits and Goats!You'll find it pleasant to review such a wellselected showing.

Anddogs and men are quite close, kinwhen it comes to the teaching; of newtricks. Old men, are, "sot" i'n theirways, both of thinking and doing.The man who has farmed all his'lifeis very slow indeed to change hismethods. ' .Young dogs and boys and- girls canbe taught new tricks readily. Theyare delighted to try .new things. Forthis very reason every farmer andevery farmer's wife should be .certainto nave their children in tne tfoys;and Girls' Clubs. It 'does not makevery much .difference whether theyoungster joins a pig club, V heiferclub, a corn club, a canning club -ora poultry club. The main thing isthat in these clubs, made up, of children, they will have an opportunityto learn new tricks and very valuable tricks.

How many tires are wornaway, springs broken, extra gasolineand oil used. On good smooth roadsa set of tires will easily last for10,000 miles, but over bad roads,it is seldom that we get more thanfour or Ave thousand miles out of aset of tires.Take the man living in a rural district where everything has, o behauled in over the highways, ttfe merchant has to pay anywhere fr6m 50cj to $1.00 for hauling his goods. Onevery barrel of flour that 4s broughtthere is a bad road tax of perhapslone or two dollars. On every barrelof sugar there is a bad road tax offrom $1.50 to $3.00 Every pair ofoveralls, every pair of shoes, in' facteverything that is bought carrieswith it a oaa roaa tax. uesiaes necannot market his goods so he canreally compete with men living ongood roads. It would cost anywhere,f rom ten to twenty dollars to lia'ul 'tothe market a load of timothy hay,2,000 pounds of tobacco and the badroad tax on one ton of such materialwould pay the man's taxes for goodroads for a year.In addition to all these 'things,good roads would allow him to visitliis neighbors, go to church, allow hischildren to attend school, .and somany things that are desirable . thatit seems unnecessary to try. to enumerate them in this enlightened age.Let every man figure for himselfwhat good roads mean to him and hewill vote the 20c Road Tax everytime he gets a chance.oCAPTURING A GERMAN COLONELAs the troopships have come intothe Port of New York in , recentmonths, I could not help but remember, whilo watching the soldiers onboard make game of the pompous.municipal officials and other formalgreeters on the Patrol, the words ofa solemn English army officer as hedescribed these same American boysin the thick of war. - ,'"Straordinary!" drawled the Englishman.
