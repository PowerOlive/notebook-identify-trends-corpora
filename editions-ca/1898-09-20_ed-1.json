write to express my gratitudo forthemirac
lous beneGt received from Dr Miles Ileart
Cure I suffered for years as result of army
life from sciatica which affected my heart
in the worst form my limbs swelled from
the ankles up I bloated until I was unable
to button my clothing had -sharp pains
about tho heart smothering spells and
shortness of breath For three months I
was unable to lie down and all the sleep I
got was in an arm chair I was treated by
the best doctors but gradually grew worse
About a year ago I commenced taking Dr
Miles New Ileart Curo and it saved my life
as if by a miracle
