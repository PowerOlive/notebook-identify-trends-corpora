grievances go back throughmany j ears and there have been legislative and other attempts to settlethem one of the latest being the Nelson law regarding the sale of timber onthe Indian lands However the Indiansclaimed that the method of disposing of this was both cumbersome andexpensive and that they were thesufferers In regard to serving asas witnesses in illegal liquor sellingcases they claimed that the deputymarshals left them to find their own-way home from Duluth without having paid them the proper mileageThis is denied by the deputiesThe leader in the trouble withthe Pillagers is an old

protest against the waybe claimed to have been treatedThe United States marshal insiststhat the old mans story is unfoundedbut the reds had been stirred up tosuch a pitch that trouble apparentlybecame

Children Will Raise a Monument to La FayetteOctober 19 Has Been Set AsideLa Fayette Day ly theGovernors of the Difl ferent StatesaaSpecial CorrespondenceOn the 19th day of this month thestudents and school children all overthese United States will unite in doing honor to one of the greatest andmost beloved heroes of all historjThe governors of the different stateshave issued proclamations settingaside October 19 as Li Fayette dayin all the schools and educational institutions of the country This is incompliance with a request from thespecial La Fayette memorial commission organized by the commission-generalof the United States to the Parisexposition and in response to the warmand earnest personal recommendationof President McKinley On this special day exercises of a patriotic naturewill be held in all the institutions oflearning throughout the land recalling the days of our early struggle fcrliberty and the connection of generousand boyish La Fayette therewith contributions to be made at the same timeby the students and children to thefund which is to erect a monument tothe gallant heros memoryThe following letter has been Issuedfrom the executive mansion by President McKinley recommending themovement to the educational officialsand youth and school children of thecountryTour letter written in behalf of the LaFayette memorial commission has greatlyInterested me and I have read with muchsatisfaction the plans already outlined forthe proposed monument to the memory ofa great soldier and patriotThe undertaking is one in which I amsure it will be considered a privilege toparticipate and the idea that the studentsIn the schools colleges and universitiesshall take a prominent part in this tributewill not only be of vast educational valueas one of the most important epochs inhistory but will keep prominent beforethem the inspiration of a high ideal of devotion to great principles and of the public recoenition paid to lofty purposesGen La Fayette was but a young manwhen he espoused the cause of liberty andindependence overcoming well nigh insurmountable obstacles to do so It is altogether fitting therefore that the youthof America should have a part in this testimonial to his goodness and greatnessI am glad to note that your committeehas fixed a date when our people in everypart of the country may testify their interest in this proposed monument and theirdetermination that the movement alreadybegun shall achieve the greatest successVery sincerely yoursWILLIAM MKINLEYLa Fayette a boy of 19 gave up allhis prospects of wealth and high position in France to come to the aid ofthis country when it was strugglingfor liberty and that in its darkesthour It was when report came toEurope of great American losses andreverses and English victories that LaFayette started out and in spite ofthe direct mandate of the French kingand the protests of his wealthy relatives and royal friends and notwithstanding arrest and delay and all conceivable obstacles which were put inhis way set sail with 11 picked conypanions for American shores Whenthis black news came from the patriotcamp he said Then the more dothej need me and after much difficulty escaped in disguise over theFrench border into Spain and thereset sailHe had been promised by SilasDeanethe American representative in Parisa commission as major general in thepatriot When congress dissented to this on account of his age and inexperience La Fayette who was waiting without sent in word that he bepermitted to enter the army as a private and without pay From this moment to the end of the revolutionarywar this young Frenchman was one ofthe most ardent and able championsof the patriot cause He immediatelybecame Washingtons dearest friendand engaged with him in many of thecouncils which led to the final colonialvictories Monmouth BraudywineBaron Hill and Yorktown were scenesof his exploits on the field His aidto America however in this tryingtime was not confined to valor aloneHe was instrumental in securing thepatriots success in a more materialway Through him it was that thealliance with France was finally secured which brought the turning pointof the revolution La Fayette by hisinfluence in Pari did possibly morethan any other agency to induce theFrench king to take up arms with usagainst tyrannic England Tt wasthrough La Fayettes agency also thatthe colonies secured that famous loanof 27000000 livres from the Frenchgovernment of which that nation saidlater in regard to its payment Of the27000000 we have loaned you we forgive you 9000000 as a gift of friendship and when with the years thereconies prosperity you can pay the restwithout interestWashingtons friendship for LaFayette continued throughout lifeand formed one of the greatest examples of mutual attachment inof great men and both he andhis successors until the death of LaFayette let no opportunity pass todothe noble Frenchman honor Uponthe occasion of his visit to this country after American independence hadbeen gained he was met with pfianifestations on the part of the peopleunparalleled in the records of appreciation of a nation When he returnedio these shores in 1S24 congress gavehim an official reception in the hallof representatives and the people contended with the horses for the honorof drawing his carriage Congress presented him with an appropriation of200000 a township of land built andnamed in his honor a man-of-war the1Brandywine and tendered the same tohim for his conveyance homeXka But War ITcwsTh Louisville Courier

brideare stationed thereChapter II Fannie McLanes weddingcauses family feeling A few months latershe while traveling with her husbandmeets Merriam on his wedding tripChapter III Some time previous to thisMerriam had gone on a government survey fallen ill and had been nursed by MrsTremaine and daughter Florence A hastynote from Mrs McLanes stepson takeshim to the plainsChapter IV Young McLane dictates toMerriam a dying message which is sentto Parry a young Chicago lawyer andbrother-in-law of Mrs McLane Replycauses Merriam to swoon He is taken toTremaine calls for FlorenceCI1APTEK VIt was October before the surveyorsfinished their work in the Mescaleromountains and Merriam and his menwere recalled to Sedgwick Late inJuly Billy Whit taker had been relievedby his restored comrade and returnedto headquarters he lost no time in calling on the Ilayncs and between himand that charming little army matronAirs Ilayne there were exchanged significant smiles and knowing looks andnot a few confidential words to all ofwhich the blond Norse looking captainand husband seemed to give hearty approval And letters from the cantonment long letters came to AirsIlayne from her friend Mrs Tremaineand long loving blissful missives fromFlorence and when the Ilaynes fatherand mother boys and girls all presently went in to Chicago for a month atthe fair it leaked out in some way thatMrs Ilayne left freighted with mysterious commissions from her friends at theCatamountTremaines reverses permitting no such extravagance as a journeyespecially in view of the many newand lovely items that women decreed asindispensable now And presently itwas known at Sedgwick that despitehis complete recovery Mr Merriamseemed to find it necessary to leave thedetachment in the mountains and makefrequent even hazardous rides withonly a single orderly down deep intothe canyon of the Catamount anil so onback to Wells and the cantonmentLong before the Ilaynes returned fromChicago therefore the sweet secret wasout and all Port Sedgwick was talkingof Merriams engagement to Floy Tremaine She was but 18 he 28 She wasshy sensitive an idolized daughterThere were times when she was actually lovely so deep and tender were hereyes so winning her smile soft andcaressing her voice lie was stalwartsoldierly fine looking certainly but aman few heartily liked while few thoroughly knew him lie had been wildextravagant and some said dissipatedthe first two or three years after hisgraduation He was known to be frankMid truthful and as a giver and lenderhad been decidedly too generous liewas a conscientious officer in manyways except when he was serving under Buxton lie couldnt bear Buxand Bux not infrequently spoke disparagingly of Merriams ability a thingthat might have hurt him in the eyesof his superiors but for the fact thatthey knew Bux far better than he knewthem Among officers of his own gradethere were none whose opinion wasworth having who really disliked Merriam but very few who felt themselvessufficiently intimate with him to actively like They had nothing against himexcept a certain indifference of mannerand nothing that called for enthusiasticpraise His conduct in returning to hisregiment from an expensive east ern station and putting himself en retraite until his debts should be lifted and hisduns appeased met with general commendation His course in taking theMescalero detail off a brother officershands was held to be characteristicallygenerous He had lots of good pointshad Merriam they all conceded butthere were not four people officers orladies in either the cavalry or theEiflers who thought him good enoughCor Florence Tremaine- Wish her joy Aye with all myheart said the old colonel when thenews of the engagement was broughtto him but can we hope it EvenCapt Haynewas not sure though hetried to be and found comfort and inspiration in the enthusiasm of his devoted -wife and in the stanch opinionsof Billy Whittaker These two werethe two at Sedgwick to whom that engagement brought gladness with5ut alloy and since there were not four people in the combined commands whocould thoroughly approve the matchit follows that at most therefore therecould be only one more but that onewas the most confident the most enthusiastic the happiest the gladdestthe proudest the fondest girl that everlived Florence her own sweet self Tna passion of tears one exquisite moonw ruumii ftrtrtv vailit evening late In June she had thrownherself upon her knees by her mothersside and sobbed out the news that Merriam had told her he loved her dearlyand had asked her to be his wife andwhen the mother drew her to her bosomand held her there and mingled hertears with those of her beloved childher heart went up in prayer to Heavenfor she knew that which Tremainecould not understand that so deep sofond so all possessing was the lovewith which Florence would love probably did love that there could be nolistening to reason She had pinnedher faith on Randolph Merriam and itcould not be shakenBut neither wife nor daughter knewthat night that earlier in the eveningMerriam had sought the husband andfather and opened his heart to himtold him his whole story and beggedof him his consent and blessing Idid love Miss Hay ward he said I wasfascinated beyond expression and wasstunned by the abrupt end of our engagement but all that passion waskilled by the details that have reachedme and in its place have grown up anadmiration and love for your daughterthat far exceed anything I have knownbefore I have had hard lessons sirI am not worthy the love of one so pureand true as she but it shall be my constant endeavor to make her happyTremaine could not answer for a moment What have you told her thusfar he asked though not unkindlyI told her before I was summonedback to the detachment after thatshooting scrape up in the mountainsabout Miss Ha v ward and mv brokenengagement and her prospective marriage I do not think I had any business to do even that to tell her anything that might seem to single her outas confidante but the impulse wasstronger than I wasWas that the day before the couriercome down with the news of the fightasked the captain with uplifted browsHe was thinking of how Florence hadbeen found by her mother in tears thatvery afternoonVery possibly sir though I cannotrecall the dayThen afrer a pause Answer methis question Merriam said the olderofficer If Mis Hayward were totreat ihvs man as she did you if shewere ryain to come into your life andsay Come back to me I do not askyou what your answer would be I askwhat would your heart sayNothing Even if she were not hiswife 1 could not thiuk of her againwithout aversionYet she is accomplished and abeauty you say which my Florencethey tell me though I cannot see it isnotShe is accomplished too much soShe is a beautiful woman but I look inyour daughters eyes sir and I see heras you see her God knows I marvelthat anyone can fail to see her except asyou do and as I doAnd Tremaine held out his handgripped hard the lean brown fingersthat clasped in his essayed to say something that was still weighing on hisheart but gave it upShe is all I have to give Merriamhe presently said but she is all theworld to meAnd so when Merriam returned toSedgwick to face the volleys of congratulation and the occasional shakes of thehead with which his seniors said tohim Shes a heap too good for youman he could not but be aware of thetrend of public sentiment and thoughtime and again he had said as much toher to her parents to himself it mustbe owned that here was a case where itwas not entirely flattering to find theworld of his own expressed opinionIt nettled him not a little and evenWhittaker and Mrs Hayne cotild notentirely comfort him It was all verywell to say You must remember thatFlorence has been the pet of our regiment ever since she was born I declareit makes me jealous at times for myown babies as Mrs Hayne did It wasgratifying and complimentary to histaste that the commendation of hisgentle fiancee was so general but nomatter how conscious a man maj be ofhis own shortcomings is it ever a comfort to find that all his friends areequally aware of them It must beowned that there were moments whenMerriam grew impatient of these comments upon his unworthiness expressed or implied even while his heartrejoiced over the enthusiastic interestdisplayed by all the garrison in hiswife that was to beAnd he was a very devoted lovertoo Only twice a week did the mailrider go out to the cantonment butRandy wrote to her long crowdedpages every day and her letters cameeven longer and brimful of love andsunshine and happiness He had sentto St Louis for her engagement ringand her delight over itand its beautywas something delicious to see thoughshe properly rebuked him for his extiavagance and warned him neveragain to spend so much money in jewelry for her while he was yet a poorlieutenant By and by whenI came a great general as surelymust then it might be permissiblebut no matter how great or distinguished he might become never couldshe be prouder of him or of his lovethan now never neverAs the late autumn wore on it was arranged that the wedding should takeplace at Sedgwick and both riilers andtroopers the th foot and the thhorse were to give the happy couple aglorious send off Both bride andgroom elect had seen much of the eastand south within the ten years preceding this of 92 and Merriam suirc estedsouthern California Coronado BeachSanta Barbara and Monterey for theirhoneymoon trip Florence would havegone

circulate among his friendsas in life he would experience a greatmany surprises more or less appertaining to him and to his affairsI little thought it would ever comewithin my experience to test this noveltheory but it so happened and the attendant results were simply appallingBeing blessed with an extremelylarge fortune I was able to ride anumber of very expensive hobbiesamong them that of mountain climbing I was passionately fond of thisdangerous sport and would endurehardships innumerable in order thatI might indulge in itBeginning with Mt Blanc I hadworked my way up to the Jungfrauand the Matterhorn and it was duringthe latter climb that a couple ofguides and myself dropped over aprecipice and were supposedly lostConsciousness left me at the time ofthe accident I had sustained injuriesfio severe that my mind was affectedfor weeks and when at last I awoketo a realization that I still lived Ifound mjself in a little Swiss chaletand experienced the unique sensationof reading a full account of my deathin a Paris newspaperIt was a grim joke but I decided toenter actively into the spirit of it Ina few days I departed incog forPrance and shortly afterward tookship for AmericaSomewhat in doubt as to how theextensive fortune of a supposedly deceased bachelor might fare I resolvedto acquaint ray solicitors with the factthat I had not as was commonly be-lieved gone over to the great majority- and so head off any premeditated attack on my heaped up dollarsMessrs Tort and Trapleigh weregreatly amazed of course and whentheir astonishment had worn off alittle I noticed a coolness not verypronounced indeed but thoroughlypatent to m3r sensitive self in theirtreatment of me I was nonplussedfor the moment but my wonder wassoon set at rest by Mr Tort who conducted me to a private room and thenput the astounding questionMr Baker are you related in anyway to Brigham YoungRelated to Brigham Young Igasped Mr Tort youre crazyAt least youre a Mormon Pleaseassure me that j oure a Mormon andthat you did it purely tut of religiousconviction and nothing elseDid what I asked in a bewilderedwayIs it possible you dont know thatyou have been married 13 times andthat a bakers dozen of women arewearing mourning for you this blessedminute and have each filed individualclaims for your large estateMarried 13 times I echoedExactij and each one of thesewidows seems to have proven a clearcase against youI laughed loudly and reached for myhatWhere are you going asked TortIm going back to tie Matterhornand fall over another cliJf I repliedbetter death in some foreign landthan annihillation at the hands of 13widows Unhand me TortBe quiet then warned the solicitor Sit down Be a man Remember you cannot possibly be a husband to all of them Well

outer officeThey drift in all day long by ones andtwos We keep a clerk specially to attend to them Would you like to talkwith this one She is No 9 Shall Isend her inYes I returned desperately Iwould like to have her give me someinformation Send her inAnd in she came It was Miss deSmet fat fair and fortj I knew herwell She gave a scream when shesaw me and began to flutter herhandsDont faint I requested in a voiceof forced calmness We are oldfriends Miss de Smet but I had noidea that we had entered the holybonQs of matrimony I cannot recollect ever having married you Still Imay have done so in a moment of temporary aberration Will you pleasestate where it was and when andwhyyou have struggled along all theseyears as Miss de Smet rather than asfrs BakerTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS ELY TUESDAY

she bolted out of the roomv X was beginning to get- just a littlebloodthirsty and rather to enjoy mystrange situation so when Tort announced that four more had just comein I requested him to let me look atthem unobserved Perhaps I wouldrecognize some more of my old friendsA ventilator in the partition answered my purpose admirably Placing a chair on a table I climbed up until my eyes were brought in line withmy peep holeThen I peered out There they satmore of that bakers dozen in formalline in the outer office One woman Idid not know at all the next I vaguelyremembered to have met at a charitybazar the third was a book agentwith whom I had had occasional dealings in a business way but the fourthlady whose somber attire was set offwith a red rose at her corsage I nearly fell from the chair when I saw herAs soon as I had sufficiently recovered I climbed down opened the doorslightly and motioned for Tort Hecame mat onceWell said he what do you thinkof themTort I answered have you particularly noted the lady on this endof the row the one with the red roseYes shes No 6 and the prettiestof the lotWhat does she claimShe claims that you proposed toher at Newport in June 1895 that sheaccepted you and that you were married and that she was a governess inthe family of one of your friendsTort said I here is an opportunity for revenge I love that girland I did propose to her in June 1S95but she refused me For this reasonI went abroad and began to climb icebergs I want you to dismiss the other three out there and have a littleconversation with No G whom I knowas Miss Gunderson along certain linesthat I will lay down to youIn fiveminuteshe returned beamingly to the forlorn widows The threenot wanted were immediately sentand thereupon the followingconversation took place between Tortand Miss GundersonMrs Baker you loved the decedentBenjamin Baker very dearly did younotOli so dearly and she sobbed inher handkerchiefIf fate would1 only give him backyou would cherish him fondlyI would devote my life to hishappinessAh this is most touching murmured the relentless Tort You arnot now and have not been in anytrance catalepsy or hypnotic conditionSirIn other words you are of soundmind and a free agentOf courseThen there is a blissful surprise instore for you BeholdThis was our prearranged signaland I burst from the room1 in which Ihad been hidden and advanced uponthe lady with outstretched armsDarlimr I exclaimed rapturouslyBut she eyed me coldly What isthe meaning of this she asked calmly looking at Tort who is this manDont you know me my love Icried fearing my revenge was aboutto be snatched out of my hands ImBaker alive and well back from thetomb and I wasnt killed after allThere is some mistake said MissGunderson tapping her brow reflectively while a troubledilookcame overher face You are not Baker not myBaker How were you supposed tohave lost your lifeWhy I fell over a precipiceThen there has been a mistake agreat mistake she interrupted witha dazzling smile My Baker wasblown up on a steamboat I regret exceedingly that I mixed the Bakers butthey are so plentiful how could you expect a grief stricken woman to discriminate Good day Mr Tort Sorryto have troubled youBy that time I had lost all interestin the remaining 11 widows and Tortis still negotiating with them If heweeds them out as successfully as Iweeded out two I

workmenin the world is Hauanuma Masakichiof Tokyo who has carved a figure inwood so like himself that when the twoare placed side by side it is said to bealmost impossible to tell which livesand breathes and which does notBy several connoisseurs in art thiswooden figure has been pronounced themost perfect and human image of manever made Masakichi has faithfullyreproduced every scar vein and wrinkleto be seen on his own body The figureis composed of 2000 pieces of wooddovetailed and jointed with such wonderful skill that no seams can be detectedTiny holes were drilled for the reception of hairs and the wooden figure hasglass eyes and eyelashes in which nodissimilarity to Masakichi sown can bedetectedThe Japanese artist posed betweentwo mirrors while modeling this figureand for some time after its completionhe posed frequently beside it to theconfusion of spectators who were oftenentirely at a loss as to which was theartist The figure stands with a littlemask in one hand and an instrumentfor carving in the other The lifelikeeyes are apparently gazing at the maskand the face wears a look of intense absorptionThe Opium CannotsWell now can you from your extensive experience

Kicks All the Way Down the Bill ofFare and 13 Particularly Irritated Overa Dish of Powdered Horse Iladish ServedWith Frozen Whipped CreamWhen you have examined the constitution of the German cuisine youare tempted to grow loquacious Youare conscious of having discovered thatthe psychology of a nation cannot beconstructed upon a mere analysis of itsmade dishes Your estimate of BrillatSavarin sinks He could not tell youwhat you are even from all the menusof your lifetime Freiligraths philosophic conclusion that man is whathe eats you straightway qualify astrue only when referring to cannibalism And you will aver that only inthe case of paleolithic man can youconstruct a man from the crumbs thatfall from his dinner table And thisyou will want to prove and consequently will grow talkative with presenting of much evidenceAnd yet in your sane moments youwill have a sneaking affection for thestatement that a German is a Germanbecause he eats what he eats As a general rule he may be said to eat fivetimes a day But his hunger - is constantly being stilledHe starts early in the day with a cupof cafe au lait and a small butteredroll This keeps him going till 11oclock when he demolishes a slice ofbuttered rye bread spread with sHgosof hard boiled egg raw chopped beef orcheese This he washes down with aglass of ale thus stilling his inner mantill dinner time Dinner takes place toward 1 oclock and consists of soupgenerally nourishing a plate of meatwith potatoes and fruit cranberriesprunes or apricots occasionally cheeseseldom sweets rarely a green vegetableThree hours later coffee is takenserved with a piece of cake or thickbread and butter This is the hour precious to the gossip and the busybodythe time for spreading scandal Toward8 oclock the appetite again assertsitself The hour of the ubiquitous sausages has arrived Their name is legionand they share the honors with slicesof ham smoked gonse breast pieces ofraw pickled hterring and in summerhard boiled eggs and potato saladSuch is the German method of spreading the meals over the day Of coursethere are exceptions Many familieshave two ample meals a day but thebulk of the population eats mostly buttered bread and snacks In justice toGermany one must say that the fare inmany a home will compare favorablywith that of many an American familyIn the German restaurant the cuisineis on the whole monotonous and thefood singularly insipid All meats seemto have the same flavor all are servedwith the same heavy viscous saucesand invariably escorted with the samesoaplike potatoes Stodginess andness are the great blots on the Germanfare The element of variety too seemsconsidered superfluousIn the concrete the subject is almosttoo painful to face the difficulty beingto steer clear of exclamations denotingpositive offeusiveness Some of thekickshaws which figure regularly uponthe German table are reputed to be mostsustaining They certainly are intensely and ostentatiously wonder inspiringOne preparation is everywhere metwith under the name more or less phonetically spelled of beefsteak a la tartare Its basis is raw chopped beefthis spread out into a pat of ellipticalshape is crowned with the raw yolktifan egg raw finely chopped onion iissprinkled over it a garniture of gherkins is added and the whole is eatenwith much gusto and no worse consequences than a durable thirstIn many of the dishes you discoverall the humor feeling and imaginationof a Wagnerian composition You findthe resolute desire to build up harmonyupon discord Of this nature may 6econsidered the traditional menu of NewYears eve carp pancake and punchThese three brought into immediatejuxtaposition and consumed in plethoricquantities generally have the desiredeffect that of inducing a hystericalgood humor ZFor stodginess nothing beats the favorite dish panache It consists -ofpickled pork sour cabbage and a pureeof split peas boiled down to the consistency of stiff dough Experiments onthis mass produce deplorable capers andcause one to grunt mournfully A variety of this diet is found in BerlinYou substitute boiled balls of doughand indifferent prunes for the peas andcabbage and you have the dish popularly termed the Silesian kingdom ofheaven Cold eels imbedded inatranshicid glutinous substance figiirein all workmens taverns while roastgoose is de rigueur for all solemnitiesA dainty which we have recentlymet with in Berlin recalled Darwinsremark that hardly any experiment isso absurd as not to be worth tryingIt consisted of finely powdered horseradish served up with frozen whippedcreamOne may sum up ones judgment bysaying of German cooking what the artcritic said of nature It has infinitepotentialities Not the least of theseis its ambition to discover victims thatsurvive its charms
