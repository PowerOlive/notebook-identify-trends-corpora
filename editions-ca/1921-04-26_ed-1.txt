OFLIFETIME ENDSCan't Express Gratitude I Peel Toward Tanlac, Says Mrs.Bnrrington"From childhood until I got Tanlac, I suffered , from indigestion andstomach trouble," said Mrs. J. A. Burrington, 540 Stanford avenue, LosMRS. J. a; BURRDKJTONLos Angeles, Calif.Angeles, Calif., "and that's been along time, for I'm now in my sixtyeighth year."I remember when I was a child Iwas kept on a strict diet of lime water and milk for weeks and I havebeen in constant distress all theseyears. I suffered terribly from bloating and had to be very careful ofwhat I ate. I became so weak andnervous I could hardly go about myhousework and was in a miserablecondition."About two years ago my husbandgot such splendid results from Tanlac he insisted on my taking it andthe medicine wasn't but a little whilein ridding me of my troubles. It gaveme a splendid appetite and I couldenjoy a good hearty meal, eventhings I hadn't dared touch before,without any fear of it troubling me."Then I had the influenza and became dreadfully sick and weak, butmy stomach kept in good order andit only took four bottles of Tanlacto build me up again to where I'mnow feeling better than at any timeI can remember. I have gained elevenpounds 'in weight, too, and wordscan't express the gratitude I feel toward Tanlac. I keep Tanlac in thehouse all the time now, for I know itis a medicine that can be dependedupon."(adv)oDISABLED WAR VETERANSADOPT A CREED.Disabled veterans of the WorldWar, nearly all of whom are overseasveterans and members of the WalterReed Post of the American Legion inWashington, D.

In summing up editor Fisherwrites:"Carlisle has only two trains daily,each way. The first train passes here ,at an extremely early hour, making atrip to Cincinnati quite an unpleasant undertaking, necessitating a waitof an hour in Paris. In fact onecould, more comfortably, arise at thesame hour, drive to Lexington andtake the Southern, reaching Cincinnati sqmewhat earlier. As most ofthe travel from this branch is to Cincinnati rather than to Louisville, wecan see no reason for advancing thistrain on the schedule."A 'bus line from Paris has helpedto relieve the situation to some extent. A continuation of the interurban would help even more. Doubtlessthe need for the interurban willeventually bring it to us, but in -themeantime, we urge our citizens to,petition the 'powers that be' of theL.& N. to give us some train fservice,to put the 'dinky' back on the schedule." oLines of ConductModesty forbids a man to crownhimself with laurels, but there is noobjection to one's wreathing one's factwith smiles.
