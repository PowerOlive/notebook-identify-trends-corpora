Some Years Ago.
Editor Green R. Keller in the Car
lisle Mercury says: "It is most
interesting to see the work going on
on the L. & N. double track between
Paris and Covington. W remember
watching ' the work cf building' the
first line near sixty years ago, and the
mode of procedure was entirely differ
ent from that in vogue now. Where
holes were then drilled by the old
hand process now the.steam drill does
the work ; the steam shovel lifts and
handles more rock and dirt in an hour
than a whole force handled in a day
then ; and all other work pruceeds up
on an entirely different basis."

writes W. R. Patterson, of Welling
ton, Texas, "as when a frightful cough
and lung trouble pulled me down to
100 pounds, in spite of doctor's treat
msnt for two years. My father, mother
and two sisters died of consumption,
and that I am alive today is due sole
ly to Dr. King's New Discovery, which
completely cured me. Now I weigh
187 pounds and have been well and
strong for years." Quick, safe, sure,
its the best remedy on erth for colds,
coughs, lagrippe, asthma, croup, and
all throat and lung troubles. 50c and

Roman Script Favored.
Shall the world's script be Roman,
such letters as we use, or Arabip or
Chinese? The Roman script has by
far the best chance and the best
claim, according to the New York In
dependent. Efforts are making to
Introduce it in China and Japan, and
now the effort Is making to interest
India in reducing Its fifty alphabets
to a single one.
Cheapers Steel Production.
A German inventor has discovered
a new process for making steel which
Is said to be equal in every point to
crucible steel, although made without
crlcibles, and which is becoming a
competitor of electrosteel because,
while of equal standard in quality,
its cost of production is supposed to
be only one-tenth that of electro
steel. Need for Women Architects.
It is a practically accepted axiom
that there are too few . women archi
tects, for, If there Is one subject
more than another in which woman's
talent is required, it is domestic
architecture. From the Queen.
