Another Petition in Circulation.
' While several petitions iavoring
and opposing: the amendment to the
bill for a constitutional, amendment,
introduced by -Representative Clay,
the passage of which would put to a
vote of the people an amendment to
Section 201, would permit the absorp
tion by railroads of the State lines of
less length than one hundred miles,
have been forwarded to the committee
to which the bill has been assigned,
another favoring the passage of the
bill is being signed freely here. The
petition is as follows:
The undersigned citizens of Paris,
Bourbon county, Ky., believing that
the effect of the decision of the Court
of Appeals in holding that the F. & C.
Railroad Company cannot be operated
by the L. & N. Railroad Company or
the Southern Railroad Company will
be of great disadvantage to the people
of the the counties through which the
said F. & C. rfilroad runs, hereby
earnestly petition the General As
sembly to adopt the proposed amend
ment to the Constitution, introduced
by Representative Clay, of Bourbon
county. This amendment, if adopted.
by the people, would permit the ope
ration of a small and helpless railway
line by a larger and stronger company
and not in the least defeat the purpose
of Section 201 of theContstiution.
Many years of experience have shown
that the F. & i). Railroad cannot be
safely operated as, an independent line,
and we therefore beileve that its opt
ration by the L. & N. Railroad Com
pany would continue to Drove as it
has done in the last year or two to the
best interests of the F. & C. company
and to the shippers and traveling
public.
We petition the Genreal Assembly
to subimtt'his amendment to the
people.
It is urged that everyone who would
prefer to see the F. & G. railway
under the control of the L. & N ,
which would in all probability extend
the line making it profitable to tin's
community and company sign the
petition prevailing upon the Geneial
Assembly to pass the bill introduced
by Representative Clay, and can do so
by calling at the store of Mitchell
Blakemore.
