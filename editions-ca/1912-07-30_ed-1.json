in the harness class at the Mt. Ster

of her feet, suffering such a severe in

ring until the late summer may be
necessary. The mare was ' brought
through Paris Friday afternoon and
taken to Shawhan by Dr. Steve Trabue.

her injury. Golden Gin was in rare
form during the exhibition at Mt.
Sterling, and after taking two premi
ums, outclassing all of her compet
itors, other owners declined to allow
their horses to go in against her. The
accident was a great blow, to Mr.
Northcott, who had planned to show
the mare at all the fairs during the
summer and fall. Unless complica
tions arise and the injury to her foot
becomes more serious, it is probable
she will be in shape by the middle of
August, and will be seen at the Bour

She Gasped "A Rat."
she jumped into the waiting machine,
threw in the clutch and started to
cross the street preparatory to turn
ing around.
When the machine was half way
over the car tracks she happened to
look down into the seat beside her.
The machine stopped just as she
jumped. Her screams could be heard
above the clang of the car gongs. She
was heard to gasp "A Rat!"
The car was searched. Twice the
rat appeared, once on the steering
wheel and another time on the seat.
Each time it was greeted with a
shower of car controllers, bundles,
hats and auto wrenches. Each time
it ducked back again in safety.
The auto was moved off the car
tracks. Traffic resumed.
The last seen of the fair driver was
when she went to telephone for some
one to "come and get her car."
The Best Way.
A correspondent wants to know how
to pronounce Chihuahua. The best way
is to say Chy-hewa-hewa and then laugh
as though you knew better. If it is
done artistically you can get away
with it nearly every time. The same
treatment has been frequently applied
to decollete with great success.
