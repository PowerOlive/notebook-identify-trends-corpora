ROUGH AMERICANS
"Why did you make such a vio
lent attack? Are you celebrating
some foolish holiday?" petulantly
asked a German officer as he marched
a prisoner, along the road to the
cage1.
One must admit the attack was a
bit violent. Apologies, perhaps,
should be forthcoming. American
boys are apt to be rough in their
play.
Unfortunately; it is only what Ger
mans may expect from now on. The
fighting aruonti" Chateau Thierry
was nothing unusual for us. There
was no "foolish holiday" to celebrate,
although there will be one later.
What the Germans saw was merely
the American style of fighting.
It is the only style they know.
Untutored in the rules of modern
warfare, they go ahead and make
their own- rules. These "fresh Ameri
cans with their unbroken nerve," as
the Vossische Zeitung now refers to
them, have come over to put an end
to the war.
They conje from fighting stock,
from a country that has never known
defeat, and doesn't propose to get ac
quainted with it now. They are not
going to quit until they march down
Unter den Linden. Their individual
bravery, their nerve and their abil
ity to shoot straight are the all-compelling
factors. Neither the German
gas sheila nor the German bayonete
can stop them.
Germany, in a manner of sneak
ing, is up against the real thing
now.
