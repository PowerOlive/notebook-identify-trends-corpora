It seems to be avery fine sand.full of organic remains,and especially withtubes of carbonatenumerous thinOf lime. Whichmakes the undisturbed loess extremely solid.Too porous for the cultivation ofrice, it becomes with plentv of rain orirrigation one of the most productivesoils in the world. No fertilizers areneeded, and when the wheat crop isx cut, the farmer spreads a little freshloess over the stubble, plows it in,and plants his fall crop, thus securingthroughout the belt two crops everyyear.In Honan the chief winter crops arewheat, barley, peas, beans, sweet potatoes and rapeseed for oil. Tnerefollow cotton, millet, maize, beans andhemp; while many fruits, berries,nuts, etc., are raised for home use.The immense fields of the opium bearing poppy once raised in these provinces have been almost stamped outby the recent war. and cotton andwheat have increased accoraingly.espocially along the Pei-Han railway,and since the building of the modernroller flouring mills at Hankow andShanghai.
