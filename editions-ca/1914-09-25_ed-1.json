Idleness is one of tha greatest" ene
mies of character. As some one'' has
said, "The-devil tempts other 'men, but
idle men tempt the' devil." Do s not
envy the idle man, whomever'you may
envy. You may have too much to do,
and too many things to think about
still, do not envy the man who has not
enough to think about, and has to fall
back upon himself. The passions of
human nature break loose in idle men,
and wander over forbidden places
seeking what they can devour. Dr.
James Stalker.

At every turn there is a blending of
the poetical and picturesque. The

rivalled only by the glory of its histo
