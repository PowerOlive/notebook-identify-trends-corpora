Blue Grass Clubs Have Hard
. Road.
Many Blue Grass- League club are
struggling to get malters into shape
before the beginning of the season
and in many instances the outlook is
extremely gloomy. The Paris team
will start the season beyond a doubt,
provided however there will be suffici
ent suooort accorded bv the ians to
tide the affairs over until the season is
fairly launched, then, it is calculated,
there will be Dlenty of money to sus
tain the club.
While there is a disposition among
some of the clubs to drop out, there
are always a few fans in each town
grabbing at the remaining straw see a
little ray of hope for a team. Kicn
mond is one of the towns that is well
in the rnt, but it.is practically decided
mere win De a learn, xne ians nem a
verv enthusiastic meetine and the
nnp.ctfnn wna thnrnucrhlv discussed, the
result of which was that an effort
vermin lip. mnrip. to retain their Club.
Contracts have been mailed to all the
reserved players.
Ihere is a probability that the ur
uhans will be comnelled to see another
parentape, for the report comes from
ML Nrerlini? tlmf. the Tans there are
"dead sore" on the game because their
team made such a noor showinc last
year and the fans were compelled to
dig deep in their "jeans ta supply a
deficit in the tieasury, caused by the
failure of ihe club to draw on the
road. The patronage at home was
good and the Mt. Sterling fans, like
true sports, accorded a good support.
TheFrankfort clJb is about theon!y
one among the sextet that is saying
nothing and sawing wood, making very
rapid strides toward the forming of a
good team, while Lexington finds it
easy to get ready from the fact that
there is sufficient wherewith to start
the ball rolline.
ReDorts from the Rivermen are to
the effect that Masvilie will be there
when the bcil taps and alreadv have
selected their chief in the nerson of
"Peggy" Moore, who managed the
Ironton team of the Ohio State League
last year. The fans are hopeful the
new manager will carry the coveted
rags to the river town this fall.
The endeavor to put two more clubs
in the league with the addition of
teams in Covington and Newport which
would make an eight club bague, is
interesting local fans." A number of
influential men in Covington have un
dertaken the task, and will make a
visit to President Herrmann, of the
Cincinnati club, before taking a hasty
venture.

Both Smith and Deaton were admitted
to bail at the trial, but were later re

order, as he said, that the investiga
