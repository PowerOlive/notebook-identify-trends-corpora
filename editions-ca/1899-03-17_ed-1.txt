January thaw had postponed the final struggle but nowlifter three days of snapping cold LakeMinnetonka presented a noble sheet olsmooth solid glittering ice Moreover the mercury had kindly risen tothe comfortable point of 25 degreesand a fine breeze lent itself to the occasionLake Pepin had sent its two best iceyachts the solidly built Cyclonelarger than any boat Lake Minnetonkacould boast and

They were rivals in everyset se for one of the charms of an iceboT race is that every boat starts atthe same moment there is no time allowance and the yacht which leadsat the finish is- the actual

and jump aboardhimself at the next gun Hang it wentand all started forward like a flock ofgrat white winged birdsac we a chance Nan asked herbrother although she knew i he Nancyglmost as well as he aml could havegiven a sound opinion as to tiie probable outcomeBarely said George but the windi still falling and theres no tellingyetThe difference in boats soon beganto tell The splendid Elk drew aheadvile the silken sailed Phoebe nYvvd e beside the leader Third camethe yclone too heavy for the breezeso tht George speedily put the Nancyinto third place The first time roundthe course these

the contest was atie the third race must be decisiveThe Phoebes captain was sure of winning because the falling of the windwould increase his slight advantageover the great 101k the only antagonisthe feared but strategy might leand George whispered to Nan as hetightened the sheet I think we canrun even the Phoebe pretty close ifwe take the second leg in two longtacks instead of four short ones

demonstrations in the streets of the capital andother great towns were limited to patriotic expressions of opinion the government looked on and did not care tointerfere actively It dawned upon theauthorities at last that these demonstrations were being used by wire-pullersfor other than patriotic purposesBut matters came to a climax whenthe war actually broke out and thegovernment could no longer let the capital of Spain be night after night undermob law for hours street traffic suspended in the main arteries of communication and shops and cafes hurriedly closed for fearof disturbanceandtheaters nearly empty since the patriotic mobs had got in the habit of forcing their way into them to insist uponthe band playing the Cadiz Marchivhile all the audience stood and

papers far from condemning these excesses coolly said thatthe ire of the mobs ought not to lxspent on American offices but wouldfar better be aimed at the well knownresidences and persons of

WAS ELIGIBLE TO COMMAND A CRUISERTh Shabby Trick Played Upon aPatriotic Greek Boiler Maker bySome of Uncle Sams Sailors WithWkom He Had ShippedAbout four years ago the oruieer onwhich I was serving shipped a boilermaker while we were on the Mediterranean station said a Washingtonchief petty officer of the navy now onleave of absence Our former boilermakers time expired while we were atGibraltar and as he wae not in goodphysical shape he wasnt re enlistedbut took his discharge and returned toth nnitfid States bv mail steamer Soth ship was ehy a boiler maker a veryimportant and neoessary petty officerdown below in the engineers department and when the ship pulled intoNaples harbor the chief engineer wentashore to see if he couldnt dig up aboiler makerTheres a clause in the enlistmentregulations permitting commandingofficers to ship necessary men on foreignstations in short handed emergenciesThe chief engineer brought back to theship a Greek named Charlie Maro Theman couldnt speak any English tospeak of but he was a good man atthe boiler making business and he wasduly shipped aboard of us for threeyears He was a Wild hairy lookinglot Maro was and he got a good dealof a laugh at the hands of the crew especially the younger fellows from thetime he first came over the sideMaro thought that there wasntBay other country on the map exceptGreece He thought that the Greekaman was the hottest kind of a tamalewhen it came to scrapping by laud orsea and after he got hold of enoughEnglish to make himself understood heused to take some of the young apprentice boys up into the eyes of the shipand tell them with many gesticulationsand furious words of the different kindsof tar Greece would knock out of Turkeyif the two countries ever came to anopen ruptureThe ship was around on the Pacificstation when the war broke out betweenGreece and Turkey When the news ofthe outbreak of tfeewar got to Maro ourboiler maker he nearly had heart disease and a whole lot of other suddenthings from pure excitement He justcouldnt hold himself in he looked sotickledDa Greeka manwillabim bimbim da Turka man was CharlieMaros way of putting it and he didntsee that the Turk had a ghost cf a showAll hands forward encouraged him inthe belief They all acquiesced in expressing the belief to Maro that Greeoewould simply eat Turkey up Then abosuns mate who knew how to crackthe most impossible kind of steers witha face as solemn and wooden as an Indians took Charlie in hand and boldhim some things He told Maro that theDnited States was so much in sympathywith Greece in the struggle with Turkeythat the navy department had decidedto turn over all of the ebipe of theAmerican navy to Greek commandersHeres a big chance for youMaro the bosuns mate told MaroYou just want to work your edgeHere you are already shipped on thiscruiser and its dollars to doughnutsthat if you ask for the command of thisship in order to take her over to Greeceto mix it up with the Turks youll getit hands down Better try it onThat idea impressed Maro a heapHe asked the bosuns mate whom hedhave to apply to to get command of thecruiserWhy to the commanding officerof course was the replyMaro was tremendously importantfor a day or so while he let this hugeidea grew within him and he bulliedthe men detailed to work with himdown below in the boiler room a gooddeal The bosns mate kept workinghim up to it and finally Maro appearedon deck one morning togged out in hisvery best musteriug suit of bluejacketclothes and went up to the officer of thedeck and asked permission to see thecommanding officer at the mast Theofficer of the deck was rather surprisedto see the man all done up in his mustering togs when all hands were atwork but as be is obliged to do whenan enlisted man requests permission tosee the commanding officer he sentword to the skipper who soon emergedfrom his cabin and appeared at thestickWell my man said the skipperto Maro who stood bolt upright andsaluted with a flourishSare said Maro to the skipper 1have a da honor to her-a-by taka da command of a da shipHey said the commanding officer putting his hand to his ear andlooking as if be hadnt beard arightDa ship repeated Maro For ada navee of a Hellas da Greeka naveeI hava da honor to taka da commandAll hands among the enlisted menwere up on the togallaut focsle taking the thing in and they broke into aroar that you could have heard fivecable lengths distance Maro heard itand suspecting that his confidence hadbeen abused got red and flabbergastedHe suddenly bolted for the engine roomhatch and made his way below and ittook three marines to drag him aft tothe sick bay where the surgeon at thepkippers command gave Maro a halfhours examination as to his sanityMaro was game enough to decline togive the name of the enlisted man whohad told him be was eligible for thecommand of the ship upon its beingturned into the navy of Greece butthe thrashing he gave that bosnsmate when be
