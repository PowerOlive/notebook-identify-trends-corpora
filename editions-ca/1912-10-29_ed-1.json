Bullet in Brain and Still Lives.
With a bullet in his brain Henry
Story, a negro, employed with a con
struction camp, is alive at the St. Jo
seph Hopital, in Lexington, and there
ate chances for niB recovery, according
to the statement of his physician, Di.
D. B. Anderson, of this city.
Siory sustained the injury Saturday
night in a brawl between several ne
groes at the construction camp of
Hough & Spradling. on the farm of
Dr. D. B. Anderson, on the Olinton
ville pike. A negro who is unknown
to the police inflicted the wound, and it
is said that it was done in self-defense.
The negro who is charged with the
shooting made his escape.
. Saturday night the unknown negro,
who is employed by the construction
film of D. B. Lacv & Sn, in this citv,
went to the construction camp of
Hough & Spradling in company with
several other negroes. Both Story
and the nergo accused of the shooting
bore the reputation of being bad men,
and in a dispute over some trivial mat
ter they beagn shooting.
Story, it is alleged, blew the lamp
out in the shack where the men were
gathered and began shooting, empty
ing his revolver in the direction 01 the
unknown negro. None of the shots
took effect. The would-be victim of
Story's revolver returned the fire,
emptying two chambers of bis revol
ver. One shot took effect over Story's
left eye, scattering his brains over his
clothing and the room.
Immediately after the shooting Dr.
D. B. Anderson was summoned and
dressed the wound, but was unable to
locate the bullet. Sunday morning
Story requested to be taken to a hos
pital, and he was removed to the St.
Joseph's Hospital, in Lexington.
Although according to the state
ments of eye witnesses the shooting
was a clear case of self-defense, the
negro who inflicted the injuries escaped
and has not been apprehended. It is
the opinion of the police that he will
surrender. While the condition of
Story ia serious, it is the opinion that
unlesscomplications arise, and in spite
of the'fact that the bullet is imbedded
in his head, he may recover.

J. T. HINTON.
Gives $1,000 to Paris Hospital.
Mrs. 'Jane Y. Rutherford, widow of
the late Dr. E. H. Rutherford, 'for
many years pastor of the Paris Presby
terian church, has notified the trustees
of the Paris Hospital ot the gift of
$1,000 to be placed at their disposal for
a specific purpose and to be used as a
memorial to her husband, whose lite
in this community was truly a bene
diction. The notice of the gift from Mrs.
Rutherford was'received by Mrs. W.
E. Simms. a member of the board of
trustees of the hospital and the money
will be used as prescribed by, Mrs.
Rutherford.
The new hospital which is in the
process ofconstruction under; the su
pervision? of the trustees is progress
ing rapidly and with a view of giving
a littlewider scope to their efforts and
to increase the building fund the
trustees have made a personal appeal
tor funds to provide such necessary
features as would be impossible to
furnish otherwise.
The bequest of Mrs. W. W. Massie
was Bomewhat in excess of the estate
after deducting the'fifteen per cent or
more for taxes and including the five
per cent inheritance tax, fees and
court claims. The trustees ;have nnt
exceeded the eighty-five per cent I n
letting contracts and their policy is
not to encumber the hospital with a
debt.
The amount necessarv is small com
pared to the value of- the splendid
pie:e of property which the city will
be in possession of, and which has cost
neitherthe city or county a cent.
The architect, Mr. R. L. Rowe,
whose services have been of incalcu
lable valueJto the trustees, has assured
them the building as planned for hos
pital purposes, could not be duplicated
for less than forty thousand dollars.
New Tracks for L. 4 N. Yards.
That the yards of the Louisville and
Nashville railroad in South Paris may
he provided with additional track room
and with the view of completing the
grade in the local yard3 to conform
with the proposed grade between Par
is and Winchester a contract has been
awarded by the company to Lucy &
Son, of Cincinnati, and the contractors
have commenced to grade for new
tracks, besides lowering the tracks in
the South yards.
The Louisville and Nashville recent
ly purchased a strip of ground from
W. K. Griffith, lying adjacent to the
tracks in South Paris. The tract of
ground is two hundred feet wide and
several hundred feet long. The con
tractors have a large force of men at
work lowering the.traeks to grade .with
the Claysville crossing in this city,
which will necessitate a cut of four
feet at a point where the Winchester
branch leaves the main yards. The
earth will be used to fill in the Griffith
property which will then provide room
for six or more new tracks.
The addition of the Griffith property
will enable the railroad company to
straighten its tracks at this point and
provide room for a lame number of
freight trains, which will be necessary
when the immense increase in the vol
ume of freight handled at this point
comes this winter.
The channel of the brook wheh par
allels the tracks ot the company along
the right of way in the South Yards
will be moved to the east about one
hundred and fifty feet and tracks con
structed over the brook that runs
through the main yards.
It would be hard to estimate the
amount of money the Louisville and
Nashville has suent in Paris in the
past two years, and from the present
activities in the improvement of its
property in;this city leaves the impres
sion that the work is only begun. Be
ing the divisional center with branches
leading to Maysville, Lexington, Cin
cinnati and the South and a distributing
point, the necessity of increased yards
is daily more apparent
Plan to Start Cooperative Store
If the plans of the promoters mater
ialize Paris in the near future will
have a co-operative grocery store that
will be owned and operated-by the em
ployes of the Louisville and Nashville
railroad.
A subscription paper has been circu
lated among the employes of the road
in this city and it is said that $7,000 of
the proposed $10,000 capital stock of
the concern has neen subscribed.
It is the plan of the company to
erect 'and own it3 own store building
which will be located on South Main
street on a site somewhere between
Thirteenth and Sixteenth streets and
to have everything ready for business
by spring.
This is the first effort on the part
of the large number of railroad em
ployes in this city toward a plan of
this nature and it is meeting with the
hearty support and endorsement of all
thuse who have subscribed to the proposition.

The Lexington High Sehuol defeated
M. M. I. Saturday in a hard foueht
game the score being 13 to 0. It was
one of the finest games seen lately os
the local giounds, and Milleriburg's
defeat was entirely due to' the excel
lent forward pass work and to a trick
pass made in the last quarter, Neither
team was able to score in the first
quarter while the fighting was largely
in Millersburg's territory. The second
quarter brought out some snappy work
on both sides, Lexington finally put
ting over a forward pass for a touch
down. Lexington failed to kick the
goal, this ended the half. No scoring
was done in the third quarter, but Mil
Jersburg made some sDlendid gains on
straight line bucks which brought the
ball within a yard of the goal line.
Millersburg forfeited the ball to Lex
ington on a failure to make the full
ten yards and the quarter ended. Lex
ington started the last quarter at one
end of the field and had almost reached
the center when Hedges made a trick
forward pass, gaining at least twenty
five yards. From then on it was hard
fighting but Lexington finally forced
the ball over for a touchdown in the
last three minutes of play and Hedges
kicked the goal ending the game. In
such a game as this the loser deserves
as much credit aa the winner 'and un
doubtedly the result would have been
different had Millersburg gotten the
break of luck.

be holding their tobacco to sell over
the loose leaf breaks. Offers of $10 a

Preserve Club, composed of prominent
farmers who own and control 9,000
acres of land in the northeastern sec
tion of Woodford county, has been or

protecting game and fish. This is said
to be the first game preserve estab
lished in Kentucky. The members
of the club propose seeing that the
laws protecting game and governing
trespassing aie strictly enforced.
Col. Jack Chinn, who recentlv sold
his "Leonatus" stock faim in Mercer
eounty, has bought from Wm. Fair
cloth the "Munday" farm 100 acres at
Munday's Landing and will remove to
Woodford to live. The price paid was
