Mr. Wallis has been hereseveral days, looking after his extensive farming interests in thocounty.Mr. Wallis said he believed thatthe great mass of the people endeavoring to come to the UnitedStates should be thoroughly investigated before being admitted, andthat the sifting process should bedone on the other side' of the ocean.He told of the large numbers, reaching into the many thousands, whohad purchased tickets for America,and said it would take the steamship companies three years to trans-ipoit tnose now holding tickets.Thousands of Germans, he said, areanxiously awaiting the signing ofthe peace treaty to enter America.Mr. Wallis told of his efforts toameliorate the conditions existingat Ellis Island, in which'he had beenrendered great assistance by hiswife, who was formerly Miss Nan-nire Clay, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.Thoir-Es Henry Clay.

Hill, candidate for Chiefof Police of Paris, says:"The office of Chief of Police is ofgreat importance to all law-abidingcitizens. In voting many of us rnatothe mistake of letting our personalfeelinsrs run away with our betterjudgment. I say to you in all seriousness you have a situation staringyou in the face that will be to yourinterest to study well before you decide to whom you will give your support. "Consider the candidate's fitness,his ability, and his willingness to dohis duty and not "pass tha buck."Moral cowardice should not find aplace in his make-up, and he shouldnot be a flagrant violator of any lawhimself.

I had thewoist sort of pains in my left side,and at night especially the catarrhin my head caused me so muchtrouble I could get but little rest. Icould scarcely breathe lying downand it was often almost day beforeI got any sleep at all. I lost tnirtypounds in weight and had very little strength and had to stay homefrcjm work for days at a time."While looking over the paperone evening I ran across a testimonial for Tanlac that described mycase so well that I made up my mindto try it. After I had finished mythird bottle I was -feeling like abrand-new man. My catarrh wasgone, my head felt clear, my stomachstopped troubling me and I could liedown at night and sleep like a child.I can now eat anything I want andnever feel a touch of indigestion. Ihaie never felt better in jmy lifethan I do now."Tanlac is sold in Paris at the People's Drug Store. (adv)oAMERICAN LEGION PRESENTS.
