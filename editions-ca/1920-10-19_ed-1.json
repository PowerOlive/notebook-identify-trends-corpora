NIPPERT.
Following an illness of several
years' duration, due to a complica
tion of diseases, Henry L. Nippert,
aged sixty-two, died at the Massie
Memorial Hospital, in this city at
eight o'clock Sunday night. Mr. Nip
pert had been a patient at the ir
stitution several times before, but
his condition improving he returned
to his business duties. His death
was indirectly attributed to Bright's
disease, which affected his heart.
Mr. Nippert, familiarly known to
nearly everyone in Paris as "Dick"
Nippert, was born in this city an
August 3, 1858, the son of Philip
Nippert, a native of France, his
mother being a native of Ireland. He
received his education in the schools
of his day, and proved an apt pupil,
being quick to learn. He was of a
genial, jovial disposition, and was
highly esteemed by all who knew
him. After leaving school Mr. Nip
pert assisted his father in conducting
the confectionery and bakery at the
corner of Main and Fifth streets, now
occupied by the Nippert block, and
the Alamo Theatre. For many years
after leaving Paris he was engaged
in the railroad business, being chief
(clerk in the office of the Cincinnati
I Southern railway at Chattnooga,
Tenn., and in other lines of railway
service in Cincinnati, and in Nash
ville. He had been in Paris for the
past two months as a patient at the
Massie Hospital. "Dick" Nippert was
one of the most whole-souled, affable
men we have ever known, and his
passing will be regretted by a host of
uiends of the old days in Paris, old
schoolmates, both in Paris and else
where. Mr. Nippert is survived by one sis
ler, Mrs. Percy Henry, of Louisville,
formerly Miss Majr Nippert, and two
brothers, Philip Nippert, of Paris,
and Edward C. Nippert, of St. Peters
burg, Florida. His elder brother,
George Nippeit, died at his home in
Cincinnati several years ago.
The funeral will take place at two
o'clock to-morrow (Wednesday) af
ternoon, with services conducted at
The grave in the Paris Cemetery by
Rev. T. S. Smiley, pastor of the Paris
Presbyterian church. The pall-bearers
will be: Percy Henry, Carl Nip
pert, Hanley Nippert, Will G. Mc
Clintock, James M. O'Brien and Lou
Taylor.
Officers of the Chattanooga Lodge
!of Eiks will attend the funeral and
j conduct the Elks' burial service at
the grave,

THE EEPUELICAN STRONGHOLD
SHOWS SIGNS OE WEAKENING.
The Middle West, on which the
Republicans had been so definitely
relying, is beginning to disinteg
rate. Illinois is in the throes of a
bitter fight between the Thompson
and Lowden factions. Wisconsin is
eon fronted with an unexpected
mpture because of the last filing of
ihe non ii nation papers by James
Thompson for Senator. Thompson is
a LaFollette -Progressive and the ef
fect of his announcement on the
Lenroot camp has been like the ex
plosion of a comb shell.
In Illinois the fight between the
Thompson-Lowden faction has be
come so bitter, that Republican
party leaders have asked the rival
candidates. John Oglesby and Len
Small t.j patch up a truce for the
purpose of the election.
It seems almost certain that thse
two States will be lost to the Re
publicans, as will the Dakotas, in
which the Republican party has
been captured by the non-paitisan
league.
