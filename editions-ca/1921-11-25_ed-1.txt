There is -nothing more wearing than the ceaseless round of household duties and they become doubly hardwhen some female trouble makes everybone and muscle ache, and nerves all onedge. rIf you are one of these women do notsuffer for four or five years as Mrs.Siefert did, but profit by her experienceand be restored to health by Lydia E.Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.The armistice was signed threeyears ago, but so far no lawyer hastried to get the courts to declare itunconstitutional.E& HMgHgg "?? wWhite Front GarageEBAKR SALES AND SERVICEGOODRICH AND HOOD TIRESBLUE GRASS GASOLENEPEN DAY AND NSGHTExpert Battery ServiceRepairs Storage SuppliesCars Washed(tGEORGEUNDERTAKERDistinctive ServiceBOTH TELEPHONESDay Night1 37 293III M IK II4"H-HaMake Your Dollars Go Farther1 1Station to station Long Distance telephone service enables you to make morecalls at less cost.The rate forstation to stationcalls made between 8 :30P.M.and midnight isone - half of the''day rate.- Between midnight and 4:30 A.

Fowler, for Fred L. Granville, who is directing Peggy Hyland in a trans U. S. A. story-scenicfilm. According to the Hopi law andcustom, no white man is ever supposed to be allowed in a "Kiva.""Yes, I know what a 'kive' is,"says Miss Myland, "it is a sunkenchamber inside of which the HopiIndian charms and plays with hisrattlesnakes. This difual precedes?tut; ltuuuus snaKe nanre. t.nnt isknown to have been performed bythis tribe ever since the 16th century, when Spanish explorers entered this part of America. As manyaslOO snakes are used in a dance.The rite includes the bearing Of liveserpents in the hands and mouths ofthe dancers. After this, the reptilesare placed upon -the ground wherethey are sprinkled with sacred cornmeal by the squaws. Followingthis, they are taken from the 'kiva'to a sacred tent with buffalo skin,inside of which a sacred tree isgrowing. Toward the end of thedance, the snakes are carried out ofthe tent in armfuls by the men, whoconclude the dance with their maddash down a steep precipice at topspeed." On reaching the bottom, theyliberate the snakes by scatteringthem in all directions."We Iiad quite a time in initiatingthe Hopi Indians into the mysteriesof posing for the camera," contin-pes the, popular Peggy. "When firstlet us photograph them, but actuallyamn t retuse a ten-spot in realmoney plus a war tax of matches,and pouches of tobacco. The lastnamed are luxuries to the Hopis, aseverything brought to them fromcivilization has to be carried some90 miles over rough roads, whichare mere trails."The Hopi, or Pueblo Indians, asthey are called from their villagelife, have risen in New Mexico andArizona above the stage of savageryinto a state of semi-civilization.They might be said to represent thetriumph of man over adverse conditions of the deserts and inroads offierce enemies of the lowest culture." Peggy Hyland, who is the star ofthe picture in the making, her husband, Fred L. Granville, the director, and Cameraman Roger W.
