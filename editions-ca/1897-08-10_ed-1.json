HER ONLY FAULT
fmhi
As I -went to my bachelor chamber onepuiht
And reflected on life as I put out the lirftjl
E resolved that the clubs I would visit no more
But devote my affections io dear IsadrPJt
Bhe is faultless in figure and lovely infacg
Every movement the very perfection of grace
Bo confiding and gentle congenial andsweet
That the stoics and cynics are all at hewjfeet
Like the wings of the humming bird ofepjthe
Ply her tapering fingers in Liszts potpourris
Bhe excels on the harp and the Spanish guitar
And her voice is soprano that reaches tof3
Bhe is witty and brilliant in quick repartees
And she sings cavatinas with marvelousiEIs
Conversation in German and French
tain JT
And has traveled in Italy Egypt and Spain
All the tender emotions so scouted before -Were
aroused in my heart for the fair Isadore
But my growing affections are nipped jin the
bud
For she will drag her skirts through the streets
in the mud

A WONDERFUL POND
Human Eyes Are Often Inhabited by
iLargo Numbers of laving Creatures
The water contained in a well de
veloped well formed eye in which the
sight is not impaired more especially
where a person is farsighted presents
many curious phenomena Looking
through an open window in daylight
upon a hazy atmosphere or upon a fog
such as is seen in any oity or looking
to the north upon a gray atmosphere
one will see if conditions are as above
strange disks flitting and jumping about
in the eye water It has been my privi
lege to watch these organisms for sev
eral years flitting about in the eye
water jumping toward each other again
in strife and combat in the which the
water would become comparatively
clear of amoebiform organisms only to
be again full of micrococci and the com
bats as above
The various shapes of these animal
culse are surprising Some are attenu
ated with fine filaments Again others
are like wee bits of fine porcelain with
little projections reminding one of
turtles hopping about Again others
present the appearance of cyclops and
daphne
How these organisms get into the eye
water is a mystery perhaps in the
water we drink or foods we eat either
or both The fact that the eye water is
inhabited liko all other bodies of water
is a truth that can be proved positively
beyond peradventure by any oculist
when he may extract a diseased eye
and place the fluid under the glass
May not the accumulation of these
organisms in the eye water their rapid
growth and the survival of the fittest
or strongest be the cause of much blind
ness wherein may be casts coagulation
of the eye water so called paralysis of
the optic nerve cataracts and other
forms of disease
May not numerous headaches and
other pains be caused by the overac
cumulation or growth of -these minute
organisms in which they stop the cir
culation of the active principle of life
in the arterial circulation or thenerv
ous forces The same organisms afeseen

Senator Pettns Propltccy
This is a story that an Alabamian
tells about Senator Pettus and ex-Senator
Pugh During Mr Clevelands
first administration Mr Pettus was
anxious to fill the place on the supreme
court bench to which -Senator Lamar
was afterward appointed He applied
to his friend Senator Pugh and the
latter made an earnest and sincere ap
peal for the appointment of Mr Pettus
The president inquired as to the age of
Pettus and when informed said he was
too old Senator Pugh communicated
this fact to Pettus and also suggested
to another eminent but younger lawyer
in his state to apply for the place as it
was a settled fact that a southern man
would surely succeed to the vacancy
Senator Pettus heard of Senator Pughs
letter to the other friend and it made
him mad Coming to Washington he
called on Pugh and asked him vvhy he
did not stand out for him Pugh ex
plained that Mr Cleveland would not
alter his determination about not ap
pointing a man of Pettus age but this
did not satisfy Pettus Before leaving
Pugh Pettus said Well I may be too
old to sit on the supreme bench of the
land but I am not too old to sit in the
senate and your seat will just about fit
me Pettus was as good as a prophet
He succeeded Senator Pugh on the 4th
of March last and if I am not mistaken
occupies the identical seat which Pugh
occupied during a former term Sena
tor Pugh was 77 last December Sena
tor Pettus is 76 Washington Post
Strange Domestic Pets
Mr Hutchison while British resi
dent at Kumassi had a panther pre
sented to him by the king of Ashanti
This staimal he succeeded in taming
and transformed from a forest terror
into a domestic pet Charles James Fox
had a young tiger which showed great
affection for him until one day while
licking its masters hand it scraped off
the skin At the first taste of blood its
dormant instincts returned and its
glaring eyes revealed to Mr Fox his
danger Without attempting to remove
his hand he led it by gentle words into
the next room wiiere a loaded pistol
hung over the mantelpiece Bbaeffing
it dowBTEe shot his now dangerous pet
through the head I
