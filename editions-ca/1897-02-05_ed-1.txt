wasdiscovered in Lieut Gov Lyons roomon the second floor of the main building of the capitol shortly before 1oclock Tuesday The room is directlyover the senate chamber and close tothe senate elevatorThe senate had taken a recess at1225 until 1 oclock to await the reception from the house of the amendedMitchell treasury resolution and itwas just as President pro tern Carrollwas preparing to take the chair that apage boy gave him the informationthat fire had been discovered It wasthought at first to be of a trivial nature and Chief Clerk Smiley directeda bucket brigade to go into serviceMeanwhile an alarm was sent infrom the senate library The effortsof the men with buckets were futileand they returned with the information that the flames were beyond theircontrolQ The senate was well filled when thisnews was received and it spread rapidly among the senators and spectators that the fire was of a most seriousnature There was a scrambling forovercoats and hats and under thechief clerks direction the senate records were carried to places of safetyWith the arrival of the fire department came thousands of spectatorsand the capitol park in the vicinity ofthe burning building was soon a massof struggling humanity Before thefiremen could direct a stream on theburning building it was found that thestructure was doomedIn the house the first intimation concerning the fire was the discovery ofsmoke in the upper corridors Theword was quicklv passed around andmuch excitement prevailed Rapidlythe members left their seats and therewere but few representatives in thehall when two or three shouted outmotions to adjourn After the motionto adjourn had been made there wasa rush for the doors Employesof the department of public buildingsand grounds were hustling about inan effort to do something toward extinguishing the conflagration butwere powerless to accomplish anything Owing to the location of theroom in which the fire started the firemen had difficulty in getting a streamon the flames Finally lines of hosewere drawn through the corridorson the second floor and the realwork of the firemen began but it wasapparent that whatever work theymight do would avail little in savingthe main building President pro temMcCarroll and Speaker Boyer watchedfiom the east of the park with manyother members tho demolition of oneof the best specimens ofcolonial architecture to be found in the countryIt was apparent that the entirebuilding was doomed and that thebest thing that could be done was tetake precautions toward saving theadjoining structures Twenty minutesafter the arrival of the firemen theceiling in the senate chamber fell Alarge number of persons were slightlyinjured by falling glass when thecrash came The origin of the fire isin doubt The insurance on the buildidg is placed at 160000 The interiorof the house had just been remodeledat a cost of 150000It was feared that the fire wouldcommunicate to the department of internal affairs the building on theright where valuable land awards andother documents from the foundationof the state are on file The senateand house will probably meet in twolarge halls in this city In addition tothe insurance given above the contractor has an insurance of 70000The loss will probably reach threequarters of a million dollars withabout 300000 insuranceMURDERER BUTLERAlias Ashe Arrives Under Arrest

maintenance of pikes theJudge interpreting the law to mean thatno bonds may be issued except by theassent of two thirds of the whole number voting which will for the presentprevent the issue of turnpike bonds inBourbonThe Fiscal Court claims that thedecision is a victory in many respects asit sustains the legality of the steps takento secure free pikes with the exceptionof the proposed bond issue The FiscalCourt believes that the necessary twothirds vote can be secured at the nextregular election when another vote willbe taken on the bond issue as it is nowthought such an issue will

sleeping babys breast In theast the vapor was pierced by a thousand golden arrows and was fleeingfrom the assault in a wierd fantasticrout upward ever upward until lostin the harmony of the green gray skyStraight to the point of Cleeks Headthe host of advancing day was directedand Lizette knew that in a few moments the rocks now dripping with themoisture would sparkle under thegolden beams as if set with a millionprecious stonesYet ignoring all the beauties of thescene she carefully shaded her eyesarid gazed intently at a flock of whitein the offing indistinguishable exceptto the trained eye which even as sheg aed was wrapped in a mantle ofvpor And when it too rose to joinits comrades fleeing- westward the ail- was gone When first Lizette saw itshe knew from its course northwardfind

turned and with droopinghead and weary footsteps made herway down the narrow path and overthe rocks toward the spot wiiere theblue smoke curling lazily upward toldher Mere Choucard was already upand preparing the breakfastBut once on the way did she stop Itwas at the gate in the old stone wallseparating the little cottage gardenfrm the neighbors Here she had stoodWith him on that last night here hehad kissed her now in the cold graydawn she shivered at the memory andpressed her cheek caressingly againstthe cold damp stone post and closedher eyes obliterating the present andliving for a moment

hecomes you must be the first to greethhS her heart whispered You mustbe the first to take his hand andLizette was ruled by her heartThe old people in the village shookjheir heads sadly when they spoke ofher the yoi ig girls shrugged theirshoulders and gave a toss of theirheads the young men gazed wistfullyas she walked quietly down the villagestreet She was la belle Lizette tothem and to

uncomplaininglysmiled when the day died for itbrought her nearer the future awokesmiling for the joy of waiting andhoping was to be hers until the nightPere Choucard misunderstood herand spoke harshly Called her sillyfoolish and bluntly told her he wouldnever come back that his words andhis promises were idle -that his lovewas a fancy the dream of a day thatere this he was wedded to one of hisown standing and had lone ncro forgotten the little girl of the CovePere Choucard often spoke thus butLizette only listened indulgently andsmiled Pere Choucard was so good sostrong yet so rough and Pere Choucard was old and spent the day mending his fishing- nets or working in hislittle garden The Pere did not understand he could not so Lizette onlysmiled and said softlyNo bon pere you know not Andshe was sorry for himMere Choucard did not understandeither She thought Lizette was unhappy and sad because she did notlaugh or go to merry parties with theother young folks She did not knowLizette was saving all her laughter forhim When he came how merry shewould be how her eyes would sparkle- how she would smile at nothing ateverything No Mere Choucard did notunderstand but then Mere Choucardwas old too and her eyes were dimSometimes when it rained and thegirl was sitting by the window her window through which she could see thegate in the stcue fence Bears Neckfleets Head and the restless tossingocean Mere Choucard would softlystroke bet hair and with tears glistennng in her eyes murmur Ma pauvre- 4nfrntAnd Lizette looking into the agedkindly face would pat the wrinkled- hand and say with a soft smile to herself Ah bonne chere mere you tooknow notThis day was Sunday and Lizette asshe had done every fine Sunday sincehe IfCt went for the long walk up thebeech pad the walk

every mill then of anysize boasted of a hand loom departmentHand looms were also to be seen inmany of the homes of these foreigniweaversAt that time the hand loom weaver-looked upon the power loom attendantas little better than a day laborer orpart and parcel of the machine he wasattending It is time that the old handloom weaver possessed much moreknowledge of the intricacies of the-jacquard and loom detail than is known13T the power loom weaver to day manyof whom do not understand the formation of the Darby chain The handloom weaver always declared that henadt served his time af weaving

CITYExperiments in London to find Uses lotAll WasteAshes paper scraps shop sweepings and all unclassified rubbish is herein England included under the generianame of dust Every reader of Dickens most powerful and fascinatingstory Our Mutual Friend will remember the description of the dustmounds in the yard of Boffins Bowerup Holloway way and the grotesquefigure of wooden legged Silas Weggstumping up and down them and prodding them here and there with a longiron rod in search of hidden treasureAnd many visitors to London as wellas all residents are familiar with thesight of the great mounds in some ofthe more desolate and squalid suburbsas the trains rush by them for Dickensrarely if ever enred in his local colorThe removal and disposition of thednst from the bins of residencesandbusiness houses which with you is thework of a division of the street department is here let out to contractorswho are paid so much per ton for thework and who often make a good thingadditional either by farming out theprivilege or sorting over the dust torag and bone pickers or by having itoverhauled by their own men and selling the proceeds As with you diowever the contents of the dust bins arevery largely ashes in which are intermixed a good many partly consumedcinders straw paper and various combustible rubbishEach of the numerous parishes whichgo to make up the metropolis of London has its own dust contractor andthis item of the expenses of administration is one of the burdens to be provided for by the vestry which is thegoverning body of the parish in mattersof local administration And as it isthe prerogative of the ratepayer everywhere to grumble at the expenses ofthe municipality the dust contractorscome in for their share of fault-findingJust now one of the smaller and lessmentioned parishes is undertaking anew departure in this matter which iscertainly in a measure experimentalbut of the success of which no doubtis entertained by those who have madea careful study of the whole questionand have for many months been making all the preparations for puttinginto operation this very importantmeasure If successful it will revolutionize the whole matter of the disposition of a citys refuse and turn therafepajers grumbling into rejoicingShoreditch is a busy manufacturingdistrict in the northeastern part ofLondon just to the north of the Liverpool street and Broad street railwaystations and a little to the eastwardof Finsbury which all the Ancientswill remember as the location of theciujujuij ujl t iie xj uiiuui uuie Vllery Company in which they were soroyally entertained in July last Thecabinetmakers shops are chiefly situated in this district which is of iratherlimited area but has many short narrow streets and a dense populationThe vestry of this parish has had annually to dispose of over 20000 tons ofdust and ashes for which it has hitherto paid three shillings per ton but haslately let a new contract at an advanceof five pence per ton This means anexpenditure of over 15000 per year forthe removal of refuse which is ofcourse so much net outgo Several ofthe local governing bodies in otherparts of London have put up destructors which burn up the dust butShoreditch vestry proposes to utilizeall this waste in providing light heatand power and incidentally revenuefor the parishThis parish is one of several in themetropolis which propose to light thestreets by electricity under municipalownership and management To carryout the plan the vestry has purchaseda suitable site in the middle of the borough and will build an electric generating station free baths and washhouses and a public library upon theland so secured The furnaces andboilers which are of the latest- andmost approved scrt are now beingerected and will supply steam to engines of 2400 horse power which willdrive the dynamos for generating- theelectricity which is to be distributed ailover the parish in the forms of bothlight and power The lighting- of anumber of the streets will consume aportion of the energy but commerciallights will be sold and motive powerfurnished to a tramway company andto the many small industries in thedistrict to which an easily transmittedpower of small units is a desideratumIt is in the niatter of fuel for this steamplant that the novelty of Shoreditchexperiment consists This is to be theparish dust which is to be

which theworld famous Astrachan caviar is madethere are also earp shad pike and others The sprang fisheries with nets lastsix weeks and bring 4000 loads of fishIn the fall the catch consists chieflyof sturgeon and amounts to about l000loadsThe winter fishing with ice hookstakes place in December and JanuaryAs soon as the ice is sftnong enoughusually in December so it can holdthousands of people and hundreds of ssleighs the netman gathers his peopleat Uralsk for the winter fishing Thusthey come and bring their sleighsThey usually carry a pick or pike intheir right hand and a couple off largehooks in the left Of these hooks oneis longer than the other ihe long onefor catching the fish under the ice and -theshorter one for lifting the fish outof the hole The netman or chief remains by his sleigh in the middle of thefrozen stream Upon his command theCossacks all rush in on the ice A gunshot is the given signal for commencement Before long the ice isperforated in many hundred places andnow is

agriculture was increasedduring 1S96 by 100 miles This semslittle enough until we remember that atthe end of 1S95 the good stone roadwayin the country did not exceed 1000miles If we should continue at thisrate it would take more generationsthan we have patience to think of before the reproach of bad roads couldbe lifted from our country But if thegood roads could be increased in thisproportion each year that is doubledwe should soon accomplish somethingworth whileThere is unquestionably a widespreaddesire for good roads in this countrybut the people are hampered y the costand hindered by the apprehension oftoo heavy taxes And then notwithstanding all the agitation and all therecent literature on the subject the people at large are still dreacltully ignorant One ignorant set think thatroad improvement means i he universalsubstitution of macadam pavements fordirt roads another ignorant party isdeluded with the idea that the macadampavement -makes the dirt road unnecessary Both of these parties are aswrong as possible and hurt the causethey seek to advanceIn answer to one false idea it maybe said that every macadam pavementshould beparalleled with a well draineddirt road A good dirt road is pleasanterto use eight months in the year than amacadam pavement And during thattime isrjust the period -when a macadamroad is injured by travel It is in dryand hot weather thatthe macadampavement is worn by trafficThen again macadam pavementscould not be built in 500 years to replace all our dirt reads And it wouldnot be well anyhowIf we could teach the country peoXle to make these dirt roads properlyand then drain them sufficiently theywould answer every purpose But howto dotthis is the question One way suggests itself at once Let county societies be formed and prizes offered forthe best district in each township Thiswould conduce to thought and studyTo make- a good dirt road and keep it inrepair is so easy that none but a simpleton could fail to understand

Is a GreatHelp In-SicknessWhile there is nothing more offensiveto the intelligent physician than whatmay be called officious and undueiety to assist him in performing the dtBties of his calling there is probably noone in the world who more keenly appredates the service which a trainedmind eye and hand can render him 1the case is serious a short visit is scarcely sufficient to acquaint Xhijn -with allof its details Indeed it often happens 1that the exciteinent of his coining prduces an entire change in the patientsstate and when he is ready to makehis customary examination the symptoms may indicate that whicludoes notexist at all iSuppose there were an attendant capable of taking the patients temperature of pulse or of making on papernote of the hour at which certainculiarities were

beenof vital importance to him and mighthave assisted him in saving a life cEvery child should be taught whatthe pulse is and why and how we feelit at the wrist It is very easy to undersiand how to tell the pulse and fiot atall difficult to learn to use- the clinicalthermometer Imagine the valtie to adoctor of a carefully kept record of thepatients condition from one of hisvisits to another With what confidencecould he pursue his treatment and givehis directions and what a relief to realize that his interests areMef t in such intelligent handsVery few persons stop to think of theresponsibilities that rest upon the medical man No matter how careless theattendants or how disregardfiil theymay be of administering the medicinesprescribed they are rarely if ever heldto account On the other hand the doetor is blamed for everything often indeed wdien a violation of his most positive order furnishes the cause for thiscruel censureAn important item is to have everything in readiness for the doctors visitDo not wait until you see his horseshead coining round the curve then hurry and hustle and bustle about upset-ting the patients tranquillity and yourown but make it your business as sonas the invalid has breakfasted to puteverything in order so that there maybe no confusion at the last momentHave clean towels fresh waterwhatever other articles he is inandthehabit of calling for Ask if your presence is required in the room if notiave it unless you are requested tos iay It is often the case that the doctor would like to have an opportunityof making inquiries that he would hesitate to make before a third person Itis therefore always considered in goodform to leave him alone with his adultpatients and give him an opportunityfor at least five minutes talk if hechooses to take advantage of the interval If anything is used during thedoctors visit that should be removedfrom the room take it out at onceNever leave soiled linen bandagedressings or poultices lying aboutthey are nauseating to the patient annoying to the doctor and exceedinglyunpleasant objects for the family orany chance visitorWhile everyone cannot have the opportunity to study thoroughly anything that belongs to trained nursingmost people can if they try pick nplittle points from doctors and by beingamong sick xersons and will in a shorttime get a rather good idea of whatneeds to be done in emergencies andwhat one may do to be of very great assistance to the physicianNYTiedgerTHE HAIRStyles for Every Variety otCoiffureA bewildering variety of ornamentsfor the hair are presented
