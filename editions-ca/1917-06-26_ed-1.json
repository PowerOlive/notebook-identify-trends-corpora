,1 Mr. Juian Grosjean Allen, aged
, seventy-four years, died Saturday at
12:30 a. m., after a lingering ill
-- neas of Bright's disease. Mr. Allen,
was one of our most popular and
prominent citizens. At the time of
his death he was President of the
" Farmers' Bank. Mr. Allen was born
in September, 1843, and was the
" son of Mr. and Mrs. Sanford Allen, of
Sharpsburg. He belongs to a fam
ily of bankers, his father having
occupied the position as cashier ii
- -'a bank at Harrodsburg prior to his
death. ,
" .Mr. Allen, received his first bank
ing evnorienfe under his father.
IWTien quite a young man hft-was
united in marriage to Miss Mary Mil
ler, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Mitch
ell Miller, of Millersburg, and for a
short time resided here, again re
turning to Sharpsburg where he oc
cupied a position in the bank with
his father. In 1879 he returned to
Millersburg with his wife and en
gaged in the dry goods business
Iq1S89 he took his son-in-law, Mr.
O. TV. Ingels, as partner in his busi
ness. In 1891 he sold his interest
4n-the dry goods business of Ingels.
Neal & CoTTand on the death of Dr.
A. G. Stitt was made Cashier of the
Millersburg Deposit Bank, which po
sition he held unjil 1900, at which
time the charter of the Deposit
'Bank was allowed to expire and the
Farmers' Bank was organized. About
this time he became President of the
Farmers' Bank, with his son, Mr. S.
M. Allen, as cashier, which position
F , ..
he held until the time of his death.
In 1865 Mr. Allen, with Mr. J. G.
Smedley, was made a Master Mason
in Amity Lodge No. 40, F. .nd A. M.,
and was fifty years a Mason in Feb

Mr. 0. E. Hurst, as General Manager.

fare of his town and community, and
'.' perhaps has done more than any one
man in Central Kentucky to build
up young men. There are several

Until the last few months Mr.
Allen has been an active man
though it was known by himself and
his family for the past two years
that the dread disease which caused
his death was working on him. He
was regular in his habits, attentive
to every charge imposed on him, true
to his friends, lovinc. gentle and
kind to his' family. A few weeks ago
he went into a decline, and was com
pelled to resign business, his health
failing rapidly until the end.
His funeral took place Sunday af
ternoon from his late residence,
with services conducted by Dr. M. B.
Adams, President of Georgetown Col
lege, assisted by his pastor, Rev. R.
C. Goldsmith. The service was beau
tiful and impressive, though simple
and the attendance was the largest
ever seen at a funeral here. Mr.
Allen had many friends everywhere,
and all the surr6unding towns were
represented. The floral tributes were
appropriate and beautiful. The body
was laid to rest by the side of hl3
wife in the Millersburg Cemetery.
His four brothers, Messrs. Frank,
Jack, Thomas and Waller Allen, cf
Sharpsburg, and two cousins, G. S.
Allen, of Millersburg, and S. R.
Allen, of Winchester, were pall
bearers. The honorary pall-bearers
were: A. C. Ball, R. L. Tarr, S. C.
Carpenter, O. M. Johnson, O. B.

and Clifton Dalzell.

THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT
While the press of the country is
being deluged with requests for the
free insertion of matter relating to
the navy, the army, and other phases
of the present war situation, and the
editors are supposed to be patriotic
enough to give room for all of it, to
the utter exclusion of everything
else, the Senate is hard at work
placing heavy taxes on the publish
ers' profits, and increasing the bur
den the press has already to bear in
the way of postage.
It is all right to be patriotic, and
we do not suppose there is a paper
in the United States to-day that
would not give ail the publicity its
space would stand to government
affairs, but it does seem unreasona
ble to place this heavy tax upon their
financial resources. The press of
England made the first successes of
the Allies possible, and the English
papers continued loyal to the gov
ernment. They were not unjustly
made the burden-bearers of the tax
ation problems.

DOESN'T WANT SOLDIERS TO
HAVE CIGARETS!
Whether American soldiers in
France should depend on their
French and English comrades for
their cigarettes has caused a contro
versy between Red Cross workers and
members of the Women's Christian
Temperance Union, in Omaha, Neb.
The latter are unalterably opposed
to placing cigarette papers in com
fort kits sent to private soldiers by
the Red Cross.
But the sentiment seems about
evenly divided. While the W. C. T.
U. members have expressed them
selves against sending the papers to
the soldiers, leading women of Omaha
have taken a stand with the Red
Cross workers, saying that "it is ut
ter foolishness to attempt to 'deny the
men on the fighting field, and in wet,
cold trenches the conrfort of cigar
ettes." Consequetly the Red Cross
workers announced they would con
tinue to send the "makin's" to the-
I soldiers, regardless 'of "utterly fool
Tjsh. protests." .. - ; . :

Animal and insect pests of corn '-prairie-dogs,
ground-squirrels, gop
hers, blackbirds, crows, cutworms,
earworms, wireworms, chinch-bugs,
grasshoppers soon will open their
spring campign of destruction '
Many of these pests can be effect
ively combated, according to speci
alists in the U. S. Department of Ag
riculture, who describe measures
that may be employed.
For cutworms, lumps of poisoned
bait, made by mixing about 50
pounds of bran or corn meal with
two pounds of Paris green, six finely
chopped oranges or lemons, and
cheap molasses to make a stiff dough,
should be scattered along the corn
rows at planting time or as soon as
injury from the cutworms is noticed.
Information as to these poison baits
will be furnished on application to
the Bureau of Entomology.
Treating the seed with coal tar
will usually repel attacks of brids,
and, in some cases, those of burrow
ing rodents. A teaspoonful of tar is
enough for a peck of corn. Mix the
tar with a quart of boiling water.
After the mixture has cooled some
what, but is still hot, stir in the
corn until every grain is coated, and
then spread it out to dry before
i planting. Corn may be immersed
several minutes in moderately hot
water without affecting germination.
The tar treatment does not repel mice
or ground squirrels.
Destruction of corn ' by ground
squirrels, prairie-dogs, pocket gop
hers, or mice is best prevented by
poisoning the animals a few days be
fore the corn is planted. Strychnine
is the best poison in all cases, but to
obtain satisfactory results a special
formula is needed for preparing the
poison for each kind of animal.
Such formulas have been worked out
by the Bureau of Biological Survey
and special instructions will be fur
nished upon application. Paris green
and strychnine are poisons and should
not be placed where children or do
mestic animals can get them. Year
book Separate No. 708, "Destroying
Rodents, Pests on the Farm" contains
many formulas and may be had free
until the limited edition is exhausted
