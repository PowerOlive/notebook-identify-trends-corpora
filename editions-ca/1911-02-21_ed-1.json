The heavy sleet which fell in this
section Sunday afternoon and night
did considerable damage to telephone
lines and shade trees. Unshetleted
stock is reported to be suffering con
siderably as a result of the severe cold
which came so unexpected and which
gave farmers no time to prenare foi
the comfort of their stock. With the
exception of the damaee suffered by
the two telephone companies in
Millersburg, a number of polrs and
lines being down, no serious loss is re
ported. Master Ross Deans entertained Sat
urday afternoon about twenty-five of
his little friends, it being his ninth
birthday. The home wad darkened
and Eoftly'illuminated with wax tapers
in candelabra. A number of games
were indulged in and the little folks
enjoyed every moment or ibe time.
Dr. and Mrs. Deans left nothing- un
done that would enhance the pleasure
of all the guests. They are delihtful
entprtainers and this occasion was one
that will on live in the hearts and
minds of the little folks. Ices and
cakes were berved during the time.

tering inducements from now until thp

The recital given by the pupils in
music and expression at the M. P. C.
Friday evening was good. A delight
ful program had 1 een prepareo which
was well executed. The mus-ieal num
bers were clsdcical, tbrugh not neces-
'sarily heavy. interspersed by the
readings by the pupils in expression
and the vocal numbers gave the pro
gram considerable variety and made
it all more intertaimng. Miss Nell,
instructor in string instruments, con
sented after several requests to rendpr
a violin number, to the delight of all
who heard it. There was but one ob
jection to the entertainment and that
was it was entirely too short. The
reception which was to have followed
the recital was omitted and will take
place after the next one.

Police Judge Applies Buggy
Whip.
Police Judge John N. Menefee, .Jr..
. of Stanford, gave Lee Longr, a young
I white man, twelve lashes w ith a busrgy
whip in lieu of a heavy fine and jail
j term for being drunk.
. Menefee is a strong believer in the
nflicaey of the whipping post and gave
I Long the alternative of taking a whip
ping or working out a line. Long
chose the former, and Menefee laid it
on at a livery stable in front of a large
crowd.
This is the second man Menefee has
whipped since being in office, the other
having been a negro who has been
frequently caught selling whisky in
Stanford, which is supposed to be a
dry town, but is really very wet,

on the Headquarterspike with two
