conclusion that these stories arewritten by girls fresh from school orrefined old niaids who live in a villageand they are read by men who thoughtfully stick the tongue into the cheekwhile reading Yet there are men whoread and believeI saw one of this class the other daywho went to the rescue of a bootblackwho was trying to fix his broken box44 My lad said the good man theyalways call them lads in

steadily gained uponhimWhat was he to do In sheer desperation he resolved upon an unusualscheme Just as he disappeared for aninstant from the tigers sight in running over a ridge he halted stretchedout his legs at right angles curleddown his head so as to look between hislegs to the rear and extended his armsupward in a fantastic manner like thesails of a windmillIn a few seconds the tiger hove insight and at that instant the face ofthe object assumed a hideous grimaceA prolonged yell arose such as had perhaps never before pierced the ear of anytiger and the sails of the windmill began to revolve backward and forwardas if a sudden whirlwind had burstupon the sceneThe tiger recoiled What he evidently thought is this There stood aferocious star shaped monster giganticagainst the sky Its hideous head wassituated in the very center of its bodynay its viselike jaws between whichthose fiendish roars were issuing wereactually placed above its two fiery eyesIts limbs were furiously clamoring foraction and the man he had been chtiHing where was he Already devouredby this terrible beast TllG tiger couldnob pause to reflect He turned tailand as he disappeared over a friendlyridge a

the sacred torch so the generations transmit to the generations whichsucceed them all that they have oflight and knowledge leaving them as aheritage the care of continuing the divine work of enfranchisement and ofhelping to dissipate the shadows of ignoranceLittle by little these clouds are vanquished and disappear and the touch ofintelligence flames the more radiantlyin the midst of the travailing massesBut all of a sudden a veil covers thetorch something surges up whichseems like the darkness of another ageOnedeels that in a corner ofathis civilization monstrous things hae placeHere they burn a woman accused ofsorcery there in Suabia a tribunal condemns to four days of imprisonment alaborer who had disinterred the corpseof an infant He wanted to make bracelets of its finger nails

creature of prejudice InScotland he will not eat eels in Connecticut he will not eat sturgeon theroyal fish of England where the firstone taken in the Thames goes to thequeens table in New York he willnot eat lampreys miscalled lampereels which are delicacies in Connecticut and in England some old king Inever could keep a record of kingsdied from a surfeit of lampreys Withthese prejudices in mind and I hate allprejudices except those which I entertain I decided to eat the loonThere may be differences among loonsas there are between pigeons andsquabs I prefer an adult pigeon to asquab there is better chewing on itbut if a man wants real hard chewingwith a flavor of raw fish let him tacklean adult loon That bird could not bepicked It was skinned and in its stomach there was a catfish recently swallowed one partly digested and thebones of another The triggers of thepectoral fins of the catfish were set butthe stomach of the loon did not seemto be troubled by that fact

style olcane or walking stick affected by thosewhose daily business takes them intothat great live stock mart The realstock yards cane is a stick of polishedhickory with a large and ample crookat the end to meet the requirements ofthe huge and bony hands of the moststalwart ranchman These canes apparently are not made from saplingswith the bark removed and a crook 1pnt upon the end but from solid stripsof hickory wood shaved and moldedinto the proper shape They are fromthree quarters to an inch in diameterin the thickest part and without anyartificial stain or attempt at decorationIn no other part of the ciiy will yousee them carried or offered for saleBut when taking a trolley ride you willcertainly begin to notice them as soonas you come anywhere within theradius of the stock yards districtThey arc carried by ranchmen drovers shippers from the country salesmen and commission men of the yardsIt is probable they are more forpractical use than for ornament Theyseem well suited to the purpose ofpunching fat hogs and lazy steers inthe pens when the animals are beingexhibited to prospective buyers Andthen the crook on the end is bigenough to admit of holding a recalcitrant sheep very handily by it Thestock yards cane is therefore an institution in itself and if you want tosee how gracefully it is carried andto what good uses it may be put takea ride out Unlsted street and

before by letterupon their being her guests at her ownapartments at the Clarendon She hada lovely little room all ready for themXow Grafton was a provident man aneconomical man and five days hotelbills made certainly a big hole in amonths pay Something even thenwhispered to him that this extravagance were better than that to whichacceptance of the widows invitationwould lead But he banished thethought as unworthy and uncharitableFanny welcomed them with infinitetact and taste made them feel thattheir coming was a blessing to her sosad and lonely was her life now that itwas no

worry herbxit it could not be it could not beThere were important legal matters tobe settled She must fight her battlealone She could not yet go so far fromthat sacred dustAll the same the Graftons were notfairly settled at Sedgwick when Fanslegal difficulties seemed to have beensettled and her cough grievously augmented The doctors talked of Bermuda or San Diego but the idea of going toBermuda

angry and astonishedat Frances but those were jast afltTshe broke with Bandy Merriam andmarried McLane but Fan had wheedledher out of this unfavorable mood andconvinced her that she had never

controlled the fate of 500 American jackies and officers a pause butfor which the torpedo boat Porterwould have blown the flagship NewYork to bitsThe story is told now by E W McCready correspondent of the NewYork Herald who was on board thePorter and who was pledged to secrecy so long as active operationsagainst the Spanish continued Butnow that the war is over he has beenreleased from his promise and tellsfor the first time the story of an episode which is still spoken of only inwhispers in naval circlesThe New York and the Porter metone night during the blockade of Havana under strange circumstanceswhich would have justified either indestroying the other and for a fewseconds the lives of 500 men were inthe hands of one The torpedo boatlay so close under the crviisers sidethat one could have tossed a biscuitagainst itBut inviting death while he waitedliieut John C Fremont pf the Porterhailed once more a lions voice ringing clear above the churning screwsand humming blowers and that finalhail averted the catastropheIt is memorable that duty scarcelydemanded this last warningThere are some things about itwhich have never been explained Itappears that the New York was somedistance from her blockading stationFor the rest the fleet was displayingno lights except an occasional electricsignal The night was dark Cerveras fleet was not accounted for andhis cruisers and destroyers were expected at any moment The Porterwas on scout duty and more important yet the usually infallible nightrignal apparatus of the New Yorkjilayed Sampson false for once andbrought him and all who sailed withhim nearer to death than they hadbeen before or sinceIt was the Porters business to prevent any Spanish vessel from creeping up on the blockading squadron unawares The American ships at allhazards must be apprised of the approach of an enemy The Ardois system of signal lights includes a signalwhich flashed for a second in the darkness means enemys vessel in sightThat might be used if the scout werewithin signal distance of Sampsonsships when he discovered a hostilecraft But as fog and darkness arepreeminently the conditions favorablefor torpedo work the Porters business Avas to investigate the characterof every strange ship and if satisfiedthat she was Spanish to blow her upXt On that dark blockade the American ships recognized one another iniwo ways one being the position inwhich a vessel appeared which shouldbe her night blockading station andthe olher being an Ardois signalwhich was changed from night tonight So if for instance the NewYork cruising slowly westward sighted another ship running withoutlights and not occupying one of theblockading stations she would flashlet ns say two red lights above onewhite one If the stranger answeredproperly and promptly the New Yorkcould go about her business Otherwise the batteries would be manneda signal warning all vessels within signal distance would be set and the flagship would close in and get the strangers rangeA light on the port bow the lookout announcedThe lieutenant looked at it for amoment and spoke to the man in theconning tower We were going alonggently making only five knots anhourHows your head he askedNor west by west-half-west wasthe replyWe cruised westward Hay down ondeck near a one pounder too nearLieut Fremont went below for a napEnsign Gillis it was he who pickedup a Spanish torpedo afterward byspringing overboard and unscrewingits war nose so it could be hauledaboard safely was in charge of thePorter for the time There was quietuntil 230 in the morning Then theone pounder beside me woke me asthoroughly as if it had been a 13 inchgun and I raced to the conning towerto see what had happened and sawwhat seemed to be the very biggestship in the world looming up on ourport bow indistinct in the gloom butclose enough to sink us without faila second after the order to fireLieut Fremont stood before theconning tower Gillis had made outthe loom of the stranger when wewere a quarter of a mile away andhad awakened his commander Silently ihe Porter stole up on the darkwarship When we were but 200 yardsaway or less and so within easy signal distance the night fleet signal wasflashed the torpedo boat twowhite lights and one red It burnedl fcr a second or so and then it wasturned dfFThere was no reply The strangerdark and unheeding moved slowlywestward That she had not seen itwas inconceivable for there were 20men looking out for signals on everyAmerican warship at this time and noone could believe that they had overlooked that well known signal flashedclear so close at handThe Porter shot close so close thatevery man on her felt thatdesperatework was n hand and that n6w wewere in for it beyond recall The NewYork is perhaps the easiest of the- American ships to recognize but sodark was it that she was strange topracticed eyes Moreover the direciion from which she approached wassuch that we had her masts and smokepipes in a confusing line v iOur blowers were making a Jouddroning noise The movement of bothvessels through the water added to thedifficulty of hearing Fremonts voicerose so that I thought it must haverung through the strange ship Butthe crew of the strange ship wererushing to their gunsStop those blowers Fremont saidHe was calm even deliberate Hiseyes swept forward and then aftAre the guns trained on her heaskedAye aye sir came from both onepounders The torpedo too wasready It had been tested for pressurebut a few hours earlier At each guna jackie stood like a statue his shoulder bent against the rest his eye onthe enemy In such moments the eyenotices queer details I rememberwondering that the jackie at the bowgun could stand there so quietly readyto fight that great ship which toweredabove us with that absurd onepounderAs jackie answered Aye aye sirhis commanders voice rang out againThis time he was hailing and the inflec ition risingWhat ship is thatNo answerFire across her bowBang went our bow gun and themetal rattled as the men shoved another shell home and trained the pieceagainShow the night fleet signal Fremont said and it flashed again twowhite lights above a red one Wewere under the strangers quarternow close aboard For one of us therewas no escape At that range a torpedo must destroy the big ship inevitablyA second after our signal burned thestrangers signal mast blazed andthere hung an answering signal butnot the right one Instead of twowhite lights and a red one thereburned two red ones and a white oneFor a moment it flashed through Fremonts mind that an enemy might beattempting to use the American signals There was -no time to thinkabout itThere was a flash from the strangers forward fighting top and a shellwhistled over us Some man in thetop had fired without orders it seemsbut of that we knew nothing We sawonly the flash of the gun and believedthat rifles and machine guns would beriddlinerus a secondlaterguns could not be depressed enough tobear on us so close were

Chadwick thought that couldnot be so but everyone on the torpedoboat knewT it was and after some moreexplanation the Porter swung awayfrom the flagship and glided off intothe nightAs was customary several captainsmet the admirals cabin on the flagship in the morning and I was toldafterward that the night encounterwas the subject of considerable talkIt appears that Admiral Sampson himself had been awake and I was informed that when some one said toLieut Fremont that the Porter shouldhave been more careful about thenight fleet signal the admiral saidgravelyI saw the Porters signal displayedand there was no answer from thisvesselThere was an end to that argumentat least but a torpedo man from thePorter and an officer of the flagshipasked each other what would havehappened if the

woman always had a kitchen knife within easyreach that women have no use forpocketknives That is what man believes to this day He thinks that shesharpens her lead pencils with herteeth opens her letters with a hairpin cuts string with scissors and borrows some mans knife when there isa can of potted ham or corned beef tobe opened at a picnicBut nearly every woman has a penknife and finds plenty of use for itUsually she has bought it herself forshe prefers that it shall not be a giftAny man who gives a woman a penknife will find himself regarded withsuspicion It isnt that she is superstitious Oh no of course she isnt Shewill buy one for her husband or forher son but nevertheless she doesntlike to be given one and will lookaskance at the dainty little implementunless she has paid the traditionalpenny for itThe jewelers carry in stock knivesfor women and one of the merchantssaid the other day that one third of hiscustomers were women This he explained by the fact that a woman willkeep a knife three times as long as aman will Some of the knives theycarry in stock have jeweled handlesor decorations that raise their costfrom five to fifty dollars Womendont buy such expensive ones thatis not from jewelers although theyoften buy them from friends at theprice of one cent an astonishing bargain indeedThe popular knives for women aretiny bits of knives not so long as thelittle finger and sometimes not largerthan a finger joint Some of thesedainty little knives have handles ofgold or silver studded with jewelsVery often they have chatelaine attachments or are worn
