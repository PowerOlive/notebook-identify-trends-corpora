Principle A Meeting HeldSantiago de Cuba July 23 via Kingston Jamaica July 25 The Cubanshere resent Gen Shaffers attitude inignoring Gen Garcia and refusing toallow the Cuban troops to enter Santiago or to consult Gen Garcia on theterms of the surrender of the cityGen Garcias action in withdrawinghis troops into the interior his letterto Gen Shafter and his resignation ofhis command forwarded to Gen Gomez are approved and applauded ball classes of natives Gen Garcia refused to accept a subordinate placeinsisting that he was an ally GenShafters answer saying that this wasa war between the United States andSpain irrespective of Cubas individualinterest and President McKinleys instructions with reference to the administration of the surrendered district published here yesterday are interpreted as a tacit avowal of American intention to annex the island andnot to grant independenceThis is opposed by the Cubans Senor Joaquin Castillo president of theSan Carlos Cuban club and a brotherof Gen Castillo urges an official protest to President MeKiniey withoutdelay saying silence now would indicate our consent to the American attitude which is a plain breach of faiththat the Cubans can not possibly tolerateA meeting was held Sunday afternoon at the San Carlos club to discussthe matter and it is probable that aprotest was drawn up which will besubmittedIt is understood that many who werepresent at the meeting favored thescheme of a protectorate by the UnitedStates with eventual annexation afterfive or six years1 but the pi otest is ona matter of principle the main objection being the continuation in office ofSpanith officials appointed by Madridon the ground that Spaniards as aconqxiered people should not be vestedwith authority over Cubans the alliesand coadjutors of the United Statesand the representatives of a free andindependent people Such is understood to have been the tenor of themeetingCUBAN PETITIONSautiaproans Thank the People of AmericaFor

the MinneapolisHousekeeperThe Hero of a FloodACK was a boy who had turned upfrom nobody knew how and no-ljodv knew where It was knownfrom things he had dropped inconversation that he had come with aparty across the plains and that in thecourse of the long- weary journey hismother had died It was guessed that3iis father must have cast off and forsaken the boy as an undesirable burdenAll the summer he had been hangingabout the different small ranches inihe neighborhood living as best heould by what he received for choresand odd jobs and sleeping in shedsor beside a staek of sweet alfalfa haybut in the lovely California climateJack happy in the light heartednessof boyhood thought it no hardshipWinter was approaching howeverwith its heavy rains and chilly nightsIt was a bad job said Martin oneday gazing at the slight foundationof his house I hadnt ought to builtso near the canyon But the land wasso good I thouirht Id save all I couldof it for the fruit trees That comesof bein too savinNever mind said his wife wereigoin to build belter next springYes Its been a good year and Imtio end thankful for it But I mustsay I wish wed got through the rainsall safe 1 guess me an Jackll bankup agood bit this weekThe first rain had come not a verylong or cold one as would be the caseIn the winter Jack still slept in ashed and Mrs Martin was troubledabout it but the tiny house seemedito afford no corner not already filledso she was obliged to content herselfwith giving him such bedding as shecould spare and with Jacks laughingassurance Its good enough for better folks n meAs the leisure season was now onMr Martin was glad to hear of government works going on some milestlistant above him a reservoir beinirbuilt to hold the overflow of waterwith a view to storing it for irrigationof the lower lying lands In additionto the promise of security to his houseit gave opportunity for getting workof which many of the poorer rancherswere glad to availId rather like you to stay aboutwhile Im gone Jack he said and theboys heart swelled with pride as headded 1 want von to look afterFiu sure youll do it good andfaithfulAnother long rain set in Every dayJack banked jip his good and faithful best but as the canyon slowlyfilled after the long summer droughwas each morning dismayed at theinroads made by the waterJack said Mrs Martin one morning Im gettin a lit t Io uneasy at theway things looksIm feelin that way myself agreedJack who had just come in with dismay in his heart from a look at thingsoutsideIve a great mind to go over toNeighbor Davidsons to ask if they-wont let us stay with em for a fewtlays till the next time Martin comesborne I hate to stay without himCouldnt I go asked JackWell Id rather ask it myself ButI dont quite know what to do aboutKitty Its too far to carry her evenif you went to help meLeave Kitty with me Shell stayall right wont you KittyKitty replied with a crow and aspring into his outstretched armsThus encouraged Mrs Martin soonafter breakfast took her departuresaying in anxious tones Watchthem banks well Jack And I knowyoull be real good and careful withKitty Ill be back early this- eveningAn hour later Jack wished with allbis heart that Kitty was with heranother as he went out to resume theconstant work of banking up Atonce he saw that a new condition ofthings had set in The house near thecanyon stood on a kind of knoll theground on the land side of it sinkingslightly The water in the stream washigher than he had before seen it and2ie now noted with alarm that at ashort distance above the house someTHE BOUEBON NJEWS PAEIS KY TUESDAY JULY 26 1898had cut befSveen the lionseand theland leaving it on an islandToward the close of the day he sawthat the flood had spread on both sidesof the canyon so as to entirely coverthe roads which followed the streamKittj s mother would have to take aroundabout road through the countryand could not possibly reach homethat night Later he saw a farmerpassing on the other side of the newchannel The man caught sight ofJack and hailed himYoud better get outjf thatWhy shouted JackWorks above giving way Beenweakening for the last 24 hours andletting out the

hermother is 1 can do it if I stop to restby the wayJack worked as he had never workedbefore The barn was a rude structure but it required more than thestrength of a boy easily to get thedoor off the hinges He tugged andhammered until quite out of breathbut at length had the pleasure of seeing his frail bark moored as close tothe door of the house as he could get itIll move her out onto the porchwhile I fix things he decided Thenif things should go sudden I couldgrab herIt was hard work getting the bulkything through the narroAV door butJack accomplished it taking one moreaffectionate glance at the quiet littlesleeper as he quickly turned to otherthingsAs he did so there came a rush anda roar The slight raft tipped underhis feet and he was thrown over receiving a violent blow on the side ofthe head against the edge of a boardIn a moment he was half stunned thenext a plunge into the water recalledhis dizzy senses With a desperategrasp he clung to the raft as he waslifted whirled buffeted swiftly carried on Before he had time to thinkor utter a despairing cry he was farfrom the cottage and the precioustreasure he would have guarded socarefullyIt was two weeks before

to Savea Steamers CrewOn the night of December 31 1S96the British steamer Warwick fromGlasgow to St John IsT B drove atfull speed against the Yellow Muiiledge Grand Manan After futile attempts to save themselves in the howling gale the crew numbering 52 soulaunched the two remaining boatsthe next morning at daylight crowded into them and left the wreck Everdrenched ever bailing for dear lifein momentary peril of capsizing becoming more numbed and discouraged drifting further from land falling off into deeper troughs of theheaving seas the poor men finallygave up hope for survival was only aquestion of minutes or at most oihours Ac that crisis when the tempest was at its height out of the sgudthe seas and the foam out of thehurricane there appeared a saviorThe 52 frozen men thought the materialization a miracleA few days before when the gale wasrising the George S Boutwell a fishing schooner from the port of Gloucester anchored in a little shelteredspot called Seal cove The Boutwellwas launched in 1809 and had beenracked and tossed since the day of herbirth She was old and feeble andher skipper Zacharie Surette waseasing her up the coast She had beencreeping from shelter to shelter escaping the winter storms When thisflurry arose Capt Surette congratulated himself on his own safety forthe vessel was light and to risk herin such a storm was sheer suicide andhe knew it During a lull in the blowthe keeper of the North Head light noticed the steamer grinding on therocks The Boutwell was the onlyvessel within 20 miles or more Thekeeper ran down to the cove jumpedinto a frail dinghy and rowed outwith great danger to himself and toldthe captain what he had seen Therewas not an instants hesitation amongskipper and crewDont wait to haul her up boysBuoy that anciior Sharp now Lashthe jumbo down Three reefs in hermainsail and let her goNot a man on deck but knew it mightbe his last voyage It was bad enoughloaded but light A single cross seawould open her ancient

that it would revolutionizethe plains and make of them gardensBut that day is past Irrigation without water is a failure and the plainshave not enough water for the ditchesthat have been already dug Vastreaches of unland cannot be reached bywater except by pumping it out of theground and frequently it is nearly asfar to water in that direction- as it isoverland Windmill and pump can supply the vegetables and make sure thatthere will be enough flour in the binbut it cannot moisten the whole claimThis has been demonstrated Alongthe river bottoms there is hope andmany flourishing irrigation plants exist Numerous other ditch propertieshowever are in the hands of receiversand are losing money The future usefulness of irrigation seems likely to beconfined to small territories

workers began to sow the seedthat they hoped would bring forthfruit a hundredfold they had the experience that always falls to the lotof the sower some seed fell upon goodground some fell where there was little depth of earth some fell amongthorns and others by the waysideIt was not expected that all seedcould be sown on good land nor thatall which should be sown would springup to bear r uit In such an undertaking it was more than ever necessaryTROAD AT COOLBAUGH PAPeople Come from a Long Distance toUse Itto follow the example which naturesets and sow with wanton bountyrinorder that here and there some mighttake root In namres economy provision to guard against loss and prevent failure is made with a lavishhand and thousands of blossoms andseeds are blown hither and thither toevery one that rests in good soil andgerminatesIt was thus with the doctrine of better roads When that gospel beganlo be preached ir fell upon a few willing ears some received it with joy andprofited by it Many more who heardit were heedless and indifferent theylistened were interested for the moment and then forgot it all Thenthere were many more who would nothear or who hearing would not understand Lastly there were thosewho rebelled at Ihe doctrine who antagonized it who controverted it andwho sought in every way to refute itNevertheless the gospel of goodroads continued to be preached withunremitting zeal until everyone hadheard or had the -opportunity to hearit Into many sectionsof the countryit penetrated slowly and the receptivity of mind of those who heard itvaried widely The majority arousedthemselves but slowly to a realizationof its truths It was line upon lineprecept upon precept here a littleand there a little the same truthrcpeatca and reiterated in a thousandwaysAt first a

COWSBUTTER IN BOXESTHE BOURBON NEWS PAEIS KT TUESDAY JULY 26 1898A Matter of Great Importance WhichIs Ignored Far Tot Often by3Iaay Dairymen -It is we think a fault of some of thebest breeds of milkers that they cannot be easily dried off even when theyapproach the time for dropping theircalf An interval of at least a monthand six weeks is still better should beleft to the cow in which she shouldhave an entire rest Milk is not goodfor food for varying periods beforeparturition depending much on the ageand condition of the cow and the kindof food she receives and digests A cowhin in flesh may require eight or eventen weeks rest before beginning milking again While we believe that youngheifers after their first calf should bekept in milk until within a month or sixweeks before the next calf is due it israther to get them into the habit oflong milking than because the smallamount they give will be worth theextra feed and labor required to secureitUnless to supply milk for householduse in winter there is little advantagein milking the cows that calved in thespring longer than January of the following year From eight to twelveweeks with comparatively little grainfeed will leave the cow in better condition for next year than will crowdingher stomach with grain so as to forcemilk production until near the time hernext calf is due to be dropped Thislast will possibly increase the milkflow when the cow springs her bagfor the coming calf and thus cause garget which is an evil that the best milkers are likely to suffer fromUntil near the time of parturitionthe cow should be fed enough giain tomake her gain in flesh But for twoweeks before she calves this grain ieedshould be withheld lest it stimulate themilk flow too much After the calf is aweek old and the danger of Inflammation has past the grain feeding may beresumed taking car not io feed grainin such quantities as to fatten the cowrather than increase her milk flowAmerican CultivatorPutting Up Dairy

experience and stud3 can aman know how to apply the generalrules of farming There is no one rulethat will apply in all cases It is general true that keeping an orchardfree of grass and well cultivated is ameans of increasing its fruitfulnessYet even this rule will not work wellin all cases A great deal will dependon the soil and the fertility in it on thetrees and their habits of growth andso on To set out a young orchard andbegin to cultivate it and fertilize heavily would often be the ruin of it During the first years of the life of an orchard it is often desirable to have thetrees grow very slowly In some soilsthis end is easily attained by leavingthe soil in its natural state even withno grass cover the fcrtilit3r of the soilbeing perhaps low But in a rich soilother means must be used to preventthe trees from feeding too grossly Acover of grass will help to do this Notonly will the roots take up part of thefertilit3 in the ground but also part oithe moisture What is left will proeenough to give the trees all the growththey should have Of course cten thiswill depend on 1he j ear being an ordinary one While grass is a goodthing to keep out of most orchards itwill thus be

caughtfire while a family was getting intogear on Sunday after moving in onSaturday Sometimes the f amity thatmoves in on Saturdays has scarletfever sometimes the wife dies of consumption or some other wasting disease plays havoc among his tribeThe other day not many monthsago anjway a man came to me onFriday and wanted to hire a house Hewanted it the worst kind and when hesaid that I asked him when he intendedto moveTo morrow said heThen 3rou cant have one of myhouses said I and all the folks whowere present laughed at me Thetenant laughed too but I stuck it outI wouldnt let him move in oa Saturdoy I should expect the deuce to payif you did it I said for I have neverknown it to failWell he wanled to know If I caredif he nroved a few things on Saturdayif he wouldnt go in with his f amity tillMonday I said no I didnt care butas for his sleeping there Sunday andSaturday nights 1 wouldnt let himSo he went away promising and Ivow if that fellow didnt move all histhings in on Saturday and slept thereSaturday night And inside of a weekthe factory where he worked wasburned to the ground and he lost hisjob and was out of work for monthsHe owes me rent now and hes the lastman who will ever move into one ofmy houses on SaturdayI suppose the undertying principleof it all is that a man who will observeand keep holy the Sabbath will notmove Saturday because he knows hemust do

Which May Call For Story cf en Old Grcwsomo bookingnitration to Prevent a War J House In San FranciscoJaincs Pinnock African merchant ofLiverpool who was one of the originalpromoters of the Royal Niger companyand director for many years in thecourse of an interview with a representative of The Daily Mail said I wentout to west Africa 40 years ago and visit ed almost every port and place in thatregion including the Nigor manytimes and my business has been withwest Africa ever aince In IS 70 I builta storracr called the Rio Formoso specially for service on the river Niger andwith her I explored and opened up forthe first time in history the river Forcados This river flows into the Atlanticand is one of the entrances to the NigerThe importance of this great riverNiger and the hinterland is well knownto those who are engaged in the Africantrade but we can only expect it willslowly dawn on the mind of the Britishpublic I am convinced however themore they look intc it the more important they will see it is to the interests ofBritish trade not to lose any of itFifteen years ago there were fourfirms trading on the Niger They werethe West African company the CentralAfrican Trading company and withthis latter Taubman Bros one of themnow Sir Taubman Goldie were connected Miller Bros and myself Weall four firms joined and called ourselvesthe United African company whichwas subsequently changed to tho National African company and after thatagain to the Royal Niger companyThe position today continued MrPinnock would be better understoodif a good map could be put before the jpuuuc oi me wxioie iiiutuijauu ui uuiwest African colonies Such a thing unfortunately does not exist at presentThe strict geography of the country isonly understood by a very few Onknowledge of the hinterland howeverhas increased immensely during the pastfew years and to instance one particularly large territory I would point outthat the French flag is already flying atinnumerable towns and stations extending from 4 degrees east longitude to 2degrees west longitude and from aboutG degrees north latitude in the neighborhood of Porto Novo and the Dahomey country to the town of Say on theNiger which is between 13 degrees and14 degrees north The English flag is tobe found to the east of Porto Novo andextending inland to the neighborhoodof Nikki now occupied by the Frenchto various degrees of latitude whereinare found the three British possessionsand protectorates of Lagos the NigerCoast protectorate and the Royal NigeicompanyIt is from the interior howeverthat the future great wealth of Africawill be derived and if all this is allowed to fall into the lap of France shewill be possessed of an empire secondonly if not equal in tho future to thfwhole of our Indian empireSee what South Africa has already-developed into and as far only as minerals are concerned The soil of Africahas not yet been barely scratched Thepopulation of this part of Africa withthe advent of railways stoppage of theslave trade cessation of internal tribalwarfare will increase in equal ratio tthat of the most favored parts of thesouthern states of America I mean asfar as the multiplication of the negropopulation is concernedThe development of this hinterlandwill in my opinion exceed all thedreams of the most enthusiastic colonial party in France Both France andEngland have sacrificed many men andmuch money in the race to grasp thispriceless treasure and the difficulty ofapportioning it will believe be sogreat that it is more than probable toavert extremes it will have to be referred to some other nation or councilof nations to arbitrate on as the matter is far too weighty for easy or speedysettlementAs evidence of the activity of theFrench I may point to the railway fromSenegal to the upper Niger This isbeing pushed forward with a furthervote of 1000000 francs from theCaissdes Depots et Consignations thus cutting and heading off all our possessionsfrom Gambia Sierra Leone the GoldCoast and Lagos down to the riverNigerA very great deal if not the wholeof the trouble on the Niger added MrPinnock would never have arisen butfor the obnoxious charter given to theRoyal Niger company By reason ofthis charter every trader white andblack British or otherwise is entirelyexcluded from the country Had theriver and adjacent country been thrownopen to free and legitimate trade as allmerchants have been clamoring so longfor backed up by the chambers of commerce of Liverpool and Manchester allthe places in question would have longsince been full of British subjects whiteand colored Trade would have developed a thousandfold and the Frenchwould never have gone near it Loudon MailThis One EspeciallyFrom a Paris paper we take the following conversation in a police courtThe President It appears from yourrecord that you have been 37 times previously convictedThe Prisoner sententiously Man isnot perfect London GlobeA Portrait of WordsworthOne of Charles Lambs friends said tohim that he had never seen WordsworthWhy youve seen an old horsehavent you asked Charles LambYes I suppose soThen youve seen WordsworthPall Mall GazefiteIn 18G7 there stood an old fashionedshanty cast of the locality now occupiedby tho Presentation convent in front of jthe graveyard and the people in theneighborhood used to tell trLigc stonesabout this grewsoine looking dwellingFor several years its occupancy was apparently confined to a decrepit old manwho used to crawl in and out about onc8a day his arms filied with packagesfrom the marketHe was known in the neighborhood asthe old dago though in reality he wasa native of Alsace For several years helived a hermits life and the neighborsgot so accustomed to his comings andgoings that even the small boys forgotto molest him But one morning all thegossips found food for conversation bythe appearance of a remarkably lovelyyoung woman who went out to and returned from the butchers stall and thegrocers She spoke English imperfectlyand with a very pronounced Frenchaccent This little cabin was destinedto be the scene of a very dramatic incident in the history of California gamblingIt was natural that a girl as pretty asIrene should not be long without admirers so it came to pass that the windows of the old house were lighted upsvery evening and the Frenchman developed the natural hospitality of hisrace and gave little dinners and suppersto his exiled countrymen But amongthose as was only natural there weresome who existed not by honesttry but by the gaming tabie Amongthem was a young man of striking appearance who had served in France assous officier in a hussar regiment hadgone the pace ruined himself and finally drifted out to San Francisco wherehe became the hanger on of the gamblingtableLouis Le Marrouais was a strikinglyhandsome specimen of the Parisian ofhis class It did not take him very longto gain the confidence of tho old Frenchman and to him he confided the storyof his life It was not a very eventfulone He was a member of an old Frenchfamily and could use if he pleased atitle which dated back to Charles theBold He had been ruined by the extravagance of his younger brother andwas then living on the income of a little property in Brittany which he hadsaved from the wreck Irene was hisonly child and he idolized her For hersake alone he wTanted to be rich Hewanted to take her back to France andreinstate her in the position to whichher rank entitled her- The ex hussar won the oilman intothe belief that his only chance of gettingrich was through gambling So nightafter night old Lescant was found atthe El Dorado or some other gaminghell losing his money under the direction of the arch mentor One night Irenefollowed him there to bring him backvid her first visit was a fateful oneTom Monroe a Kentuckian one of thewildest and most reckless characters ofthat period saw her admired her andswore that she should become his propertyIt is not necessary to recite the incidents that led up to the scene whichwere related to me by an eyewitness Itis sufficient to say that Le Marronaisbad convinced the old Frenchman thatMonroo would stake 50000 againstthe hand of Irene If he won she wasto become his wife but if he lost themoney was to become the Frenchmansproperty and Irene was free to bestowher affections wherever she pleasedIrene was informed of this propositionand she looked resigned and ratheramused at the transactionThe eventf al night arrived Monroetho old man Louis Irene and a friendand countryman of the host were theonly inmates of the little room Thogame was ecrte and the cards whichLouis had marked lay upon the tableThe old man got the deal Monroes certified check for 50000 was placed inthe custody of the hussar The old manmarked the king in the first deal andwhen the pack changed hands he hadthe best of the game The play went onand in thelaat hand Monroe scored everypointIrene is mine shouted the Kentuckian reaching for his checkAt this moment the lights were dashedout and Monroe fell to the floor fromthe stroke of some heavy instrumentThe only disinterested spectator of thescene fled from the room The nesmorning there was no sign of life in theold house and in the evening when tfesmilkman knocked he heard a groaningfrom the inside He forced his way intothe house and discovered the wretchedKentuckian bouncl iiand and foot Monroe avowing murder rushed the nextmorning to the banking house Thecheck had been cashed by an individualwho answered the description of thehussar The other actors in this starring scene were never heard of Nothingla the house was disturbed not eventhe girls wearing apparel and the incident became a portion of this
