And we havealso reached the conclusion that thereason some newspaper men go toFeaven when they die is they get somuch of the other place while theyare on earth.No matter how nobly the newspapei man boosts for the development of his town or community, nomatter how loyally he may supporta friend in politics or extol the virtues of a citizen of the town, nomatter how loudly he sings thepraises of the town girls aboYit tobe wed, or how gently he 'lays awreath of pretty words on the graveof a departed citizen, he seldomhears the magic words"Thank You."And but few times in his busy lifedoes he catch a whisper of thatcheering sentiment "Well done."But let him make a slip in his paper let him say some Paris mandid something he didn't do, or someParis woman said something shedidn't say, and everybody in Parisis ready to take a whack at him.This is true of the newspaper gameeverywhere, and being a part of thegreat world, Paris is no exception.But with all the knocks, all the lackc.f thanks and the little cheeringwords that could be said, but whichaie left forgotten, the newspaperman keeps right on boosting, and healways will. He wab born to helpthe other fellow, and, like thp birds,learned early in life that if no oneelse feeds him, Heaven may. Andmaybe that's the reason why theLord keeps so many new&paper meion earth to keep the balance ofthe world from souring or turningstale.SALVATION ARMY CAMPAIGNEXTENDED TO JUNE 1."Louisville, May 25, 1920."Ed.

There is only one way to curecatarrhal deafness, and that is by aconstitutional remedy. CatarrhalDeafness is caused by an inflamedcondition at the mucous lining ofthe Eustachian Tube. When thistube is inflamed you have a rumbling sound or imperfect hearingand when it is entirely closed,deafness is the result. Unless theinflammation can be reduced andtube restred tc its normal condition,hearing will be destroyed forever.Many cases of deafness are causedby catarrh, which is an inflamedcondition of the mucous surfaces.Hall's Catarrh Medicine actsthrough the blood on the mucoussurfaces of the system.We will give One Hundred Dollars for any case of CatarrhalDeafness that cannot be cured byHall's Catarrh Medicine.

Opposition to the sale wasvoiced in a declaration of principlesby the party and in speeches of several delegates. The Rev. H. K.Miller, one of the delegates, declared the people of the United Stateshad done wrong in subscribing tothe tobacco fund for the soldiersduring the war. i"We were made the dupes of thetobacco trust,"' he declared.Gambling in any form will beprohibited at any carnival held inFrankfort this season or next. Indecent shows will be suppressed.Nothing will be permitted at anycarnival held there this year in violation of the ordinances of the cityor the laws of the State.The city council has Mayor Ros-json's word for this declaration,which was made 'in public to thecouncil in session. Mayor Rossonmade the statement during a debatej on the question of whether or notI the Street Committee of Councilshould give the carnival companyIhe right to occupy certain portionsof Clinton street.Councilman Simpson fought thisproposition, first because he did notwant the carnival to come to Frankfort, as he contended that suchshows as had been there were a disJ grace, and second, because he insisted that the council could not byi motion suspend the ordinances ofi the city, which he contends prohibits street obstructions.oSTATENEW OFFICERS.CLUBELECTfgg' " W,.W UIHUJ.HMflEUHUJ.

MAKEWORK!5EMDuring the war idle peisons whodid not find some useful occupationwere sent to the workhouse or heavily fined. No statute had greaterpublic favor. In different fashion isbeing received the movement in certain of the large cities of Ohio toutilize the ancient loitering lawagainst loafers. The police havebeen instructed to watch the laboragencies .and when well-paying positions aie turned do'Aii to make inquiry into the status of the rejoicing idlers. In one city the PoliceJudge sent to the workhouse in oneday 12 men who refused to go towork when offered 60 cents anhour. The same thing took place inanother large center of population.This has caused a protest, to b'jmade by organized labor councils,v,ho affect to see in this, as they seein a good many other events, an attempt "to impose slavery uponAmerican citizens." Their main objection seems to be against compelling men to work at the price named,which is not the point at all.The truth is that the offenderswill not work at anj scale so longas they can sponge off their relatives or society. There is just asmuch need now for the maximumproduction of the country as therewas during the cariying on of hostilities, and there is no room forthe del'beiate shirker these busydays.BEST REMEDY FOR STOMACH-TROUBLE."I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a good word forChamberlain's Tablets," writesMrs. Mamie Bertel, of Moberly,Mo.

Caswell,when he called at Taylor-Isaacsdrugstore in Louisville, Kentuckythe other day.Mr. Caswell, who lives at 324West Brandies street, Louisville,has been employed by MengclBrothers & Company for the pasififteen years a,nd is highly respected by all who know him."Why, do you know," added Mr.Caswell, "I have actually gainedten pounds in the pafct thirty days.This strikes me as. being remarkable, especially for one of my age,as I am now sixty-eight, and I feelthat I owe it to my neighbors andthe people generally to state publicly what Tanlac has done for me."For several months previous totaking Tanlac I was in a badly rundown condition, my bones ached, Ifelt weak and tired all 'the time,and my .nerves were so unsteadyhat I could hardly drink my coffieewithout spilling it out of the cup.I actually dreaded to go to bed, forI would just fidget and squirmaround and found it next to impossible for me to get to sleep, and Ialawys got up with that awful tiredfeeling. I had no appetite and suffered a great deal from a sour, upcpf tnmn.p.li. I would bloat UP sobad at times that I could hardlvfasten my tiousf.rs around my waist.I never felt like work and seemedto be steadily t-oing down hill allthe time."But it didn't take Tanlac verylong to rid me of those miserablefeelings and set me right again. Bythe time my first bottle was gone Iwas feeling like a different man. MyaotUp iR sn ravenous that meallime comes too slow for me now andI can eat what I want and all Iwant without feeling a touch of indigestion. My nerves nave steaaieudown a-nd for the first time in a longwhile I am able to sleep soundly.Really my nerves are as steady aswhen I was a boy and I am feelingas well as I ever have in my life.Tanlac is certainly an unusuallyfine medicine, and I want to do mypait in letting the people knowabout it."Tanlac is sold in Paris at thePeoples' Pharmacy.
