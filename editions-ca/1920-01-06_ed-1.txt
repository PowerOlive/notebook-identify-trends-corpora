"V- f-fifSjgzt&r' uvJfCrrrrfR5?r"THE BOURBON NEWSPUBLISHED EVERY TUESDAY AND FRIDAY IN THE YEAR.:FtHVOLUME XXXIXPARIS, BOURBON COUNTY, KENTUCKY, TUESDAY, JANUARY 6, 1920POLITICAL POT - BEGINNING TOBOIL IN BOURBONFor the past several pnonths therehas been an undercurrent of thepossibilities of new tickets being inthe course of formation in Bourboncounty for county offices.On Friday and Saturday the potboiled over and unofficial announcements were heard of and considerable electioneering was indulged in.The new Sheriff's ticket that hasbeen a matter of considerably discussion was handed out with Ed.Bedford leading the ticket and Chiefof Police Fred Link and DaveClarke as his deputies. Mr. Bedfor is a high-class gentleman andpopular with those who know himand is now a deputy in the office ofihe Internal Revenue Department.Mr. Link, before coining to Parisgained notoriety as a "strike-breaker"in Chicago, then as a patrolmanon the Paris police force; and laterelected as Chief of Police of Paris,a position he now holds.Mr. Clarke, of Millersburg, is amerchant of that place and was defeated for Sheriff at the last election by W. Q. McCiintock.The other ticket is to be headedby J. O. Marshall, the present deputy in the Sheriff's office, who hasheld a like position for a number ofyears. Mr. Marshall is popular andefficient.The deputies, it is said, will be R.M. "Bob" Gilkey and Doug Thomas,two genial and popular gentlemen,who are both farmers and have a3iost of friends and will have a bigfollowing.The prijmary Is nearly two yearsoff, and it looks like there will" be""something doing" frofm now untilelection day in this race.Another office being discussed, asto who will be the occupants is thatof the Tax Commissioner. It is saidthat the deputy, John J. Redmon,will be a candidate against the present incumbent, Walter Clarke.Other offices being discussed arcthose of the Circuit Clerk and thatof the County Clerk, but as yet noone has had the nerve to offerthemselves for the slaughter. Twobetter clerks and officeholders 4 neverfilled a job. To beat "Bally" Pa ton 'and "Billy" Webb would be an un- Jdertaking, and it is .hardly likely1that anyone will jump into the racefor these offices without first givingit thoughtful consideration and thenmaking up their minds, not to do it.The office of the Judgeship of Bourbon has been little discussed.If Judge Stout decides to makethe race for Judge of the Court ofAppeals, there will likely be a number of candidates to enter the raceBOURBON HSCAL COURTAt the recent meeting of theBourbon Fiscal Court, with CountyJudge Geo. Batterton presiding anda full board present, County RoadEngineer Ben F. Bedfoid presentedhis report for the month of December, which was read, approved andordered filed. An order was approved and entered, fixing the price ofpauper coffins to be paid for by thecounty at $25 for adults and $12.50for children.The Court approved a largebatch of claims against' the county,and t ordered thepn paid. This included a balance of $4,207.97 duethe Brandeis Machinery & SuppliesCo. for road machinery and supplies.The Court instructed the CountyRoad Engineer to advertise for bidsfor building a new garage for thiscounty trucks, to cost approximately$10,000. The building is to be offire-proof construction.CANTRILL APARTMENT HUOSEBURNED AT GEORGETOWN.The apartment house owned byMayor Simpson and valued at $10,000 was destroyed by fire Saturdaynight in Georgetown.Ras Moore, an occupant of theapartment, saved his furniture, butJohn Roberts suffered a loss of S500and S. L. Glass about $500, both onhousehold goods with no insurance.'It is said that Mr. Simpson's lossis fully covered by insurance. Thebuilding was only recently remodeled. The origin of the fire unknown!Fire, Wind and LightningInsurance.Thomas Woodford & Bryanfor the Circuit Judgship of the district composed of Bourbon, Scott,Woodford and Franklin. If JudgeStout decides to pnake the race forJudge of the Court of Appeals hewill be hard to beat in Bourbon.Little ha? been said in regard tothe County Attorney's job or that ofSchool School Superintendent, asDave Cline seems to be giving satisfaction, and no one seems to becrazy to be the" "boss" of CountySchools.However, let us nominate men tofill the offices of Bourbon countywho can win men who we will allwork and vote for in the regularelection. Don't pledge to anyoneuntil you feel that he is a man whocan win in the regular electionthere is plenty of tipie to considertill August, 1921.&FRANK & COLADIES' OUTFITTERSWonderfulSeductionson-,Coats 7SuitsDressesGeorgette and Silk' Waists -;Stop in and get our prices. ,They will surprise you. .wi i-i.."FRANK & CO.LADIES' OUTFITTERSXj- I--xAfej.-"' TTOBACCO MARKETSThe block sale Thursday at the Independent Warehouse No. 2 disposedof a total of 190,460 pounds for atotal of $99,165.34, a floor averageof $52.06.The Paris tobacco market for thepast week was in excess of anyweek during the season.

J , tThe Nebraskan, it is said, hasTseen 'Working with characteristicskill uponra publicity -campaign, apparently intending to reach the climax when he takes the floor and delivers what is intended to be a keynote speech to the assejmbled partyrepresentatives.Danger to the party prospects for1920 is seen, and preparations arebeing made to overcome it. TheNebraskan pictures the party as being in a perilous condition and needing strong aid. Those whose regardfor Bryan and his policies is notdeep have said that he resembles thefamous Arkansas doctor who threwhis patients into fits because he was"strong on curing convulsions."The issue national leaders willmeet is whether or not Mr. Bryanshall be permitted to act as theprophet and expounder for the partyand to assume an unsolicited direction of its affairs.It is early to be writing platformsaccording to those objectors to theNebraskan's tactics, who draw attention to the fact that PresidentWilson's administration is not at anend and that a number of problemsgrowing out of the war remain to besolved.There will be a large array ofmembers of Congress, Governorsand Cabinet officials, it is Said, whowill be fully as competent to discusspolitical subjects as the forjmer Secretary of State. It is argued, therefore, that there is no reason whyBryan should have the center of thestage.There now is being developed ademand that Mr. Bryan shall giveassurance that he will not endeavorto turn the meeting into a demonstration in favor of his latest theories and seek to embarrass all otherparty leaders by launching issuessuddenly and without notice, andthen demanding their acceptance orrejection of them.It has been the custom of Mr.Bryan, to be placed upon the bottopnof the speaking list, in order that hemay choose the program.

Within sixmonths a second pool in Lee countyknown as the Hell Creek sectionwas leased up with immediate development and this pool is recognized as one of the best in the State'.The development of the Allen-Barren-Warrensection in SouthernKentucky with the counties immediately adjoining, followed, and active development of the pool has resulted in heavy production withmany companies in the field. Thesuccess of this pool verifies the pre-,dictions made that the southwestern part of the State would prov.'valuable as an oil-producing section.The completion of a 2,000 barrelwell, credited as the largest welleast of the Mississippi, completed inOctober, 1919, was made by theCurry Oil Company. This section has attracted thousands of operators from the North and East,particularly capitalists who are interested in the continued development of the field.Lineman's Creek PoolThe development of the Linenian'sCreek Pool in Lee County, slightlyoff Big Sinking pool, is rated nextin importance of production and future prospects. This section attracted the attention of oil men,when the Middle Fork PetroleumCompany completed an initial testwell on the Bowjman tract on Lineman's Creek which flowed 300 barrels steady production. Further !drilling on this and adjoining tractsi has resulted in numerous wells ofgood production.The "Menifee county pool, openedup in 1919; with structure similarto the Big Sinking pool, has becomeanother productive, section withprospects for steady output. Oneoperator who visited 'the Menifeepool tersely described it as a "realoil pool," stating that wells withsteady production of high gradecrude oils were veritable "goldmines."Lawrence, Johnson, Magoffin and.Floyd counties are coming into thelimelight "as oil producers and expert geologists state smaller poolswill be developed here which wilLgreatly increase the total output inKentucky. 'The discovery of the large gasfield in Breathitt county with thecompletion of several gas wells estimated at 20,000,000 cubit feet hasplaced the State forward in the gasproduction, and has made cities supplied with natural gas from thefields, independent of foreign gasproduction. The further development of this gas field with properfacilities for gas transportation willbe made in 1920.Big Increase Shown.An increase of 5,964,160 barrelsover the production of 1918 is notedin the completed runs of the pipelines from the Kentucky fields inthe first ten months of 1919.In January 545,059.56 barrels ofcrude oil were run from the wells inthe Kentucky fields. In October,769,679.93 barrels, or an increase ofover 200,000 barrels were reportedby the twonty-one common carriersoperating pipe lines in the fields.A total of 7,773,812.29 barrelsfor the first ten months of 1919cojmpares favorably with 4,035,950barrels" run: from the fields in theprevious year. -In 1883, there was atotal production of 4,755 barrelsfrom the fields which fell to 322barrels in 1897. vThe million barrel productionwas reached in 1905 when 1,217,337 barrels were taken from thewells drilled that year in counties inthe eastern section. This produc-I tion gradually increased to the pres-. -ETX SJJKENTUCKY SHOWSent higb figures with predictionsfor bigger production in 1920.Approximately seventy-five counties in Kentucky have became thescenep of active drilling with testwells going down in many pnore.Active drilling within twenty milesof Lexington, in the heart of theBlue Grass has been noted in Jessamine county where a "test well isnow being drilled. Eight thousandacres of land have been .leased inShelby county, thirty miles west ofFayette, for oil development, approximately thirty are rated as first classoil-producing territories with . thebest production found in Estill,Powell, Jackson, Breathitt, Lee,Wolfe, Morgan, Magoffin, Johnson,Lawrence, Floyd, Carter,, Menifee,Lincoln, Wayne) Allen," Warren.Barren and.

Thefamous Camp ton wells in Wolfecounty drilled in 17 years ago arestill pumping. " One well completedin 1903 is still running 8 barrels ofoil daily with indications of continued production. The whole EasternKentucky field has been declaredfavorably long-lived by expert geologists. The development of new fields inKentucky which are rapidly becoming recognized as heavy producerswill feature activities for 1920. Theunprecedented increase in price ofof crude oils in 1919, due to decreased production from other fieldsthroughout the United States and tothe (marked decrease of approximately 750,000 barrels daily in Mexican production, will mean more extensive drilling in the Kentuckyfields, famous for a superior gradeof crude oil, known as the Somerest which is ranking fourth inhigh grade oils.The recent increase of 25 cents abarrel declared Monday, December22, by the oil markets, (marked thefourth increase in 1919, and willmean an additional $250,000 increase in monthly returns to 1,500oil companies operating in Kentucky. Thomas M. Owsley, manager ofthe Kentucky Oil Exchange, whohas made an extensive study of theoil development of Kentucky, saidthe increase of crude oils will meanan extensive drilling campaign inthe Kentucky fields for 1920, asmany operators will see the advantages of drilling for high pricedcrude oil in shallow wells.Mr. Owsley has predicted theSopnerset grade will sell for ?3.50within six months. The developments of Morgan, Menifee and Magoffin counties in the eastern fieldswill feature the work in that pool inthe opinion of Mr. Owsley.The decrease of 750,000 barrelsdaily in Mexican production withcorresponding increase of Somersetcrude oil, will jmean extensive drilling in Kentucky fields for 1920,stated E. E. Loomis, secretary of theKentucky Oil Men's Association.Mr. Loomis believes many newfields will be opened since operatorswill realize the advantage of drilling3-barrel wells producing $3 oil than.40 barrel-wells producing 40 cent,cil. ' Mr. Loomis, in his annual report to' the Kentucky Oil Men's Association, stated business for 1919,had gone beyond expectations of themost sanguine, and that still greaterbusiness lies ahead in the presentyear, 192()lr T.he co-operation of oiloperators, throughout the State toencourage greater development willdo jmuch in improving the presentconditions of the oil industry, hesaid.'The erection of a large oil refinery on the- Old Frankfort Pik nearthe city limits of Lexington willmean the addition of another industry to Lexington's commercial interest. This refinery, constructedby the Great Southern RefiningCompany, which has acquired milesof pipe lines jn the Eastern Kentucky field, will be cojmpleted inthe early winter and be ready for therefining of crude oils.The oil will be transported bybarges from the fields to Boonesboroon the Kentucky river and fromthere piped to the refinery, whichwill increase the industry in theeastern field. Lexington Herald,January-1, 1920.Bourbon Oil and Co-operatingLand & Development Co., and Mutual Oil & Refining Co. are heavilyinterested in oil lands and properties in all the Kentucky fields covered by the above report. Thesecompanies are doing considerabledevelopment in the various fields andtheir production is increasing daily.Their stocks are steadily advancingin price, and an investment in thestock of either of these companiesat its present price will return ahandsqme profit in a short time.,'The Bourbon Oil and Co-operatingLand & Development Co. are plan-1ning an extensive drilling campaign'for the year 1920, and the Mutual'Oil & Refining Co. is planning to!build a large refinery at Lexington,!Ky., to handle the production ofsure the Mutual Co. a supply ofsure the Mutual Co. of a supply of 1crude oil for refining purposes. j. oMiles Poindexter's first name justjabout describes his remoteness from;the Presidential nomination.RELIGIOUS.V !'The congregation of the ParisPresbyterian church recently electedfour new deacons, as follows.

The SecondDivision was the division in which thefamous Marine Corps ,was brigaded.The Second was one of the bestequipped of the American grand unitsas regards horseflesh. The cream ofthe remount service was in its artilleryand transport departments.In June, 1918, the Second Divisionwas ordered from a quiet sector of thewestern front near Verdun to thewestern angle of the great Marne salient the German offensive of Marchto June had created in the French line.'Foch had sensed the impending Lu-dendorf thrust that was to win Parisand a victorious peace, and he wasassembling all his available soldiersto meet It The carrying out of thisorder by the Second Division involveda march of less than 100 miles, 97 tobe exact. Yet 80 per cent of the coldblooded horses of the artillery brigadesuccumbed to the rigors of this moredate march without having come undergunfire. Upward of half the horsesthat dropped out of line were so completely done up they were unfit to besent to base stations for recuperationwith the ultimate object of returningto service.The French divisions that accompanied the American divisions on thismarch lost no more than five per centof their horses. But the French artillery, cavalry and transport horseswere half and three-quarter breds,the produce of a system of breedingthat had been Instituted by a farsighted government sixty or seventyyears belon- the outbreak of the greatwar.Second Division Suffers.Because of the collapse of its horseequipment and artillery brigade of theSecond Division did not reach its objective until a day after the greatstruggle that was. to terminate in thejyjjining appeal of the German armyfor an armistice in October had begun.The Second Division fought the firstday. without artillery protection ancsuffered outrageously in consequence.The artillery brigade reached the zoneof conflict late iu the secpnd day and"l r.. fr'iTT.i..i.. l j.i.- -.. iwas ejuioieu to 4ii!ie jyyi;LJjiU?.3SJi5 'ot actions tnat, completely uerangeuLudendorfs ambitious plan of conquestand put the great German army on thodefensive only .because American remount officers were able to re-equipit from the surplus horse supply of theFrench nrmy with half and threequarter breds. The French were ina position to furnish these indispensable animals because up to the beginning of March the war had been awar of position rather than a war ofmovement and no hard demand hadbeen made on the artillery and cavalryhorse reserves of the French army.When the great war came to its unexpected finish the United States hadunder arms, at home and abroad,some 3,700.000 soldiers, of which974,000 were infantry, 394,00 wereengineers, 389,000 were field artillery,but only 29,000 were cavalry. Thefield artillery was horsed after a fa&hion. So was the engineer contingent.But the quality of the horses thatserved the field artillery and the engineer contingent, geiieranj u:s nobetter, If, indeed, It was as good, thanwas the quality of the horses that failedthe artillery brigade of the SecondDivision in the march from Terdun tothe Marne salient.Our Cavalry Not .There.For such "masses of infantry andartillery there should have been 230.-000-to3."5O,OO0 cavalry, according to themost achancecl military opinion in theUnited States and abroad. Yet onlyan insignificant fraction of the absmdly small mounted contingent of thegigantic military establishment of theUnited Stales of November 1st, 191Sthe second, third, sixth and fifteenthcavalry regiments as in France.Most of our 20.000 troopers were patrolling the Mexican frontier. More'over only a moiety of the so-calledAmerican eauilry forces in Francewas mounted. At no time was it possible to completely horse the second,third, sixth and fifteenth regiments.The troopers of these regiments, whenthey were not serving with machinegun contingents, were guarding munitions and quartermaster's stores. Thiscondition was due to the disgracefulfact that the United States had nosuitable mounts for its cavalry. Franceand Great Britain, to insure promptand effective co-operation by theAmerican grand units in the greatcounter offensive of Foch" might spareserviceable artillery horses of the halfand tlnee-quarter bred types because,as had already been pointed out, thestruggle for civilization up to the heginning of IMS on the western fronthad been for the most pari a war ofposition rather than one of maneuver.Their resenes of artillery horses hadnot been exhausted.
