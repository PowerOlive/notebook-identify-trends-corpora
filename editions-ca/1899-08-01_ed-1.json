Everybody knows that Rheumatism
is a diseased state of the blood and
only a blood remedy is the only proper
treatment but a remedy containing
potash and mercury only aggravates
the trouble

How Care Killa
Wise people have long been aware
that care killed a cat but it has been
left to the X rays to explain how and
why Dr Fritz Lange of Munich has
turned his fluorescent screen upon the
stomach of a happy and contented cat
and has seen the process of digestio
going on as it should in all well reg
lated stomachs Then he has introduce
care and irritation into the feline min
by placing a live mouse just beyo
reach and has seen digestion stopped
thereby I
The Society For the Prevention
Cruelty to Animals may cry out on -half
of the cat or the mouse or b i
but the lesson against worrying jH is
complete as any Christian SeW st
could desire Worrying stops digestion
causes dyspepsia retards all the nor
mal physical processes and demoralizes
both body and mind It wastes the
forces of life destroying the tissues
without accomplishing anything Chi
