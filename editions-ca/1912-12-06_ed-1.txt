Jl, 781, 000 "for the fiscalyear of 1912.The franked matter, it appears, constituted about 4 per cent of all the domestic mail handled during the fiscalyear and aggregated 310,245,000 pieces,weighing 61,377.000 pounds. Had allthe purely political matter been eliminated this enormous burden of mailwould hava been greatly reduced.There can be no reasonable objectionto the franking of important documents, such as department and bureaureports, bulletins and other publications that are of general interest. Norwill anyone question the use of thefrank for official correspondence or thetransactions of government business.There is no good reason, however thatthe mails should be, clogged with publications prepared solely for campaignpurposes and sent out in unlimitedquantities, free of postage. A greatdeal of this sort of business was in evidence during the recent ."presidentialcampaign and such matter was mailedunder franks that could notbv anystretch of the imagination come underthe designation of public or officialdocuments. Much of this matter ismade frankable by insertion in theCongressional Record. In this wavthe government bears the expense otprinting and circulating campaigndocuments and the Record is paddedto undue proportions with pxtrpneousmaterial.This abuse is chargeable to no onepartyTsince membersof aljparties areguilty'of it and have persistedj in itfor years. Postoffice Department officials very generally have. recognized it1 'and protested against it. A Democratic administration pledged to retrenchment and reform should be ableto do something toward restricting thefranking privilege to legitimate uses., L0DGB NEWS.At the regular meeting Tuesdaynight of Paris Nest No. 1744.

Deep downin their own minds they are quite convinced that thev could master it werethey to put forth the effort, but fewof them see any real reason for trying.The result has been that the man inthe kitchen is usually wholly out ofhis element. Lacking experience healso lacks confidence and if he tries tohelp he or.lv succeeds in proving himoelf an unmitigated nuisance.A popular New York cooking schoolhas set aside one evening each weekfor imparting instruction to a class ofmen. This shows that there are someWn who not only want to learn tocook, but are willing to confess theirinterest. They may he the rare exceptions, but it. would be well for menand well for women, too, if more ofthe former were to start in learningat least the rudiments of the art.Then, instead of being nuisances whenthey invade the kitchen, they wouldbecome truly, useful. It is also likelythat with sufficient experience toshow them how easily mistakes couldbe made they would be less inclinedto find fault when the finished productis set before them. Cooking schoolsfor men are institutions that deserveencouragement, especially from wiveswho suffer much mental anguish because of the grumbling of uneducatedand unappreciative husbands.AT LEXINGTON.Henry W. bavage is sending hisenormous production of the dramaticspectacle.;."
