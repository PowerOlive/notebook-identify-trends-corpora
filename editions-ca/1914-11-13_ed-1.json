Thanksgiving proclamation Friday, as
follows :
"To the People of Kentucky:
"It is proper that we should turn
at a stated time in each year ill praise
and thanksgiving to Almighty God tor
His many blessings to the people of
Kentucky.
"The year now drawing to a close
has "been conspicuous for manifesta
tions of His kind and benecient dis
pensations. "While war has desolated and de
vastated many nations, we have en
joyed peace and prosperity, and the
divine declaration, 'On earth peace,
good will toward men,' has encour
aged and made our people happy.
"Our state has had 'prosperity,
abundant harvests, productive indus
tries, law and order, and the glorious
heritage of self-government has been
maintained and strengthened, and the
year has brought a greater desire for
achievement and more abundant cause
for praise and gratitude to God.
"Wherefore, I, James( B. McCreary,
Governor of the Cominonwekltli of
Kentucky, designate Thursday, the
twenty-sixth day of November, nine
teen hundred and fourteen, as a day of
thanksgiving and prayer, and invite
all the people of Kentucky to cease
their accustomed occupations on that
day and give thanks and praise to God
for the blessings conferred upon us
and to humbly beseech" a continuance
of His mercies."

BOURBON FARMERS WILL
BENEFIT BY COLD WEATHER.
The beautiful weather which pre
vailed thoroughout last week brought
with it "the hunters' moon," which
looked smilingly down upon a scene of
pastoral beauty peculiar alone to the
Bluegrass section. Meadows clothed
in rich green verdure, forest trees
gorgeous in autumnal tints, great gold
en pumpkins ripe for the Thanksgiv
ing feasts, and the tender green of the
early seeded crops showing through
the rich brown soil.
The freeze of about ten days ago,
while not heavy, was of much benefit
to tobacco, bringing with it conditions
for stripping and also tending to
deepen the color, which is so greatly
open the color, which is so greatly de
desired by growers. No date has been
set for opening the local market,
though probably the sales will start
before Christmas. Last year about
$200,000 was placed in circulation be
fore the Christmas holidays through
the tobacco sales, and proved a benefit
and a blessing
