Little Resistance is Expected It isThought That the Surrender of Santiago Will Have a DepressingEffect at San JuanWashington July 15 The government is now turning its attention tothe occupation of Porto Rico Therewill he plenty of transports availablefor the expedition as the governmenthas devised other means of removingthe Spaniards captured at Santiago toSpain than by carrying them on thesetransports That the navy is ready todo its share at shork notice goes without saying Porto Rico is not expected to offer a very formidable resistance It is believed that the moraleffect of Thursdays surrender at Santiago will be to discourage thedefenders of San Juan There is however always the prospect that peaceimay ensue before hostilities haveprogressed against Spains eastermostWest India island Rumors were afloatThursday afternoon to the effect thatthe Spanish government at last hadmade overtures in that direction buttheir basis probably was the currentV beliei that one more reverse to theXv Spanish arms would be sufficient tor nnmrip thr Srmnish rnvirnmPTir tosue for peace and this reverse wasfurnished by the surrender of Toralsarmy The navy department has notbeen affected by these rumors to theextent of relaxing any of its precautions or abandoning any of its plansfor Secretary Long stated unequivocally Thursday that Commodoresons eastern squadron would certainlygo to Spain as soon as it could sailThe territory surrendered to us byGen Toral makes about 5000 squaremiles The Spanish soldiers to be sentto Spain is estimated at 10000 menMaj Hopkins the military aide toSecretary Alger Thursday afternoonhad spread before him a huge map ofCuba showing the surrendered zonoturned over to the American troopsThe line begins at Asseradores about15 miles west of Santiago harbor andthen runs due north about 25 miles toPalmo Soriana Had the line continued due north it would have passedof Ilolquin thusthe Spanish garrison atthat point Evidently GenToral wished to avoid the inclusion ofHolquin so the line turns abruptly tothe northeast of Palmo and runs to thecoast town of Boca del Sagua on theceoast The extreme length of this surrendered tract is about 110 miles andhe extreme width about 50 miles-papering to a less width making in allabout 5000 square milesThe navy department had not heardup to the close of office hours to whatextent the American fleet was participating in the Spanish surrender WithSantiago in our hands the way will beclear for Adm Sampsons fleet to enter the harbor and proceed up to thewharves as soon as the torpedoes andmines at the harbor entrance are removed The fortifications of Morro Castie Socapa Cayo Smith and othersare included in the surrendered zone The possession ofthese fine fortresses parti cully Morro castle will afford valuablegarrison points for a large number oimen The terms under which thesestrongholds are surrendered is not yetknown in detailGreat attention will now be given tothe care of our sick and fever strickensoldiers on the island In the opinionof the army surgeons the sick can bebest treated by removal to the highground back of the southern coastwhere the heat is less severe andwhere recovery could proceed withoutthe fear of communicating disease tothe army Secretary Alger is anxiousto bring the entire army back as soonas it can be done with safety to themen themselves and without jeopardyto the other troops in Florida and tothe general public The active preparations made to deal with the emergency are such that it is felt the question of disease can be coped withsuccessfully now that the military situation has been simplifiedin the matter of transports thedepartment is fully prepared for thenext move The acquisition recentlyof a number of trans Atlantic linerscapable of carrjing several times asmany men as the smaller transportshas put it on an excellent footing andit was announced Thursday that no-more ships were being bought forthe

after the conference said that the government wasentirely satisfied with the conditionsin and around Santiago and there wasno longer doubt of the surrender ofToral and his army was final andcompleteThey have unconditionally accepted our terms added the secretaryand the next thing is to provide shipsto send the prisoners back to SpainWe will advertise at once for ships tobe used as transports The Spaniardswill retain their side arras That isalways customary and it is the onlyconcession made to ToralDISTINGUISHED PRISONERSAdm Cervera and the Other Officers ofHis Fleet Attend Divine Worshipin St Marys Catholic ChurchAxxArous Md July IS Marylands ancient capital was crowdedSundav with curiositv seekers whocame from Baltimore Washington andelsewhere by rail and by water in thehope of getting a peep at Adm Cervera and the men who fought and lostin the great naval fight off SantiagoThose who reached here early in themorning were rewarded for their trouble as nearly all the prisoners including the admiral attended divine service at St Marys Roman Catholicehurchwhere they offered up thanksfor their deliverance from the fatethat overtook so many of their lessfortunate comrades who fell before therelentless fire of the American gunson July SAt the close of the services the officers returned to the naval academyand spent the balance of the day instrolling about the grounds or lounging on the broad piazzas which surround most of the buildings in whichthe prisoners are quartered Theyare rapidly becoming accustomed totheir surroundings and seem cheerfuland contented Ample provision hasbeen made for their comfort theirfood is plentiful and of the best quality and clothes will be provided forsuch as will acceptCapt Eulate of the Vizcaya is theonly one of the officers who has thusfar refused to sign the parole pledgeHis reasons for it are that Adm Cervera was only required to give a verbalpromise and that his Eufates rankentitles him to the same privilegeThe authorities here have no doubtthat the matter will be amicably arranged and that the scruples of thegallant officer may be overcomeBIDS WANTEDSealed Proposals for the Transportation

yellow fever in this country so faras he knows and no preparations aremaking to receive yellow fever patients It is his understanding thatSecretary Alger soon will order thetwo companies of soldiers

Men Be Allowed toKeep Their Arms McKinley SaysUnconditional SurrenderWashington July 15 After an extended conference with the presidentFriday night at which three othermembers of the cabinet were presentSecretary Alger saidThe situation is just tliis TheseSpaniards at Santiago are prepared tosurrender but they want to carrytheir arms We have determined togrant no such concession nor anyconcession except the generosity ofthis government to trausport them tcSpainSecretary Aljrer was asked if it wasnot the expectation that when it wasknown that no other terras would begranted the surrender would takeplace aud replied that such was thecase la an event no other concessiou would be aftorded by this governmentix was nearly i oclock when the confere nee at the white house adjournedBesides Secretary Alger there werepresent Secretaries Bliss and Wilsonand Postmaster General Emery SmithAdit Gen Corbjp was present duringthe last dour of the conferenceGen Shdter will be immediately instructed to Iarrv out the determination of the president with whom thematter has been thoroughly discussedSecretary Alger did not say how muchtime would be allowed the enemy toreach a conclusion but it is knownthat the administration will make itvery short and submit to no furtherparley with Gen Toral The nextmove is surrender upon the termswhich the United States governmentpropose or immediate attack upon theSpanish forces by the army and navyAt 115 oclock Saturday morningwhen Adjt Gen Corbin left the wardepartment for his home he was yetwithoutdefinite information from GenShafter concerning the surrender oiSantiagoIn accordance with the decisionreached at the conference with thepresident he sent instructions to GenShafter that nothing but an unconditional surrender by Gen Toraiwould be satisfactory to this governmentIn view of Shaffers last dispatch ncfear is felt that the negotiations forthe surrender of the forces in Santiago city will not be prosecuted to asuccessful conclusion Gen Toralit is known at irst insisted thathis men should be permitted tocarrj their arms with them to SpainThis concession Gen Shafter declinedto grant Toral has modified his demaud regarding the arms anr has presented a petition that the aims takenfrom his men be returned to Spainwith the troops As inmcated fn Setretary Algers statement above giventhe petition has bre -denied by thistrovornnientThe unusual delay which has puzzled the war officials is accouutcd forby the difficulty which Gen Toral ishaving in surrendering that part ofthe force under his command whichis not in the city of SantiagoGen Shafter estimates that therefrom 12000 to 15000 men inSantiago and nearly as manymore in the province outside the cityIt is believed that- the delay in thenegotiations is made necessary in order to secure the surrender of the outlying garrisons some of which mayquestion Torals authority to surrender them without definite instructions to that effect from MadridThere was entire willingness on thepart of Jen Toral to turn over thearms to Gen Shafter at the time of thesurrender but with this was to bethe understanding that the arms wereto be returned to the Spanish troopswhen Spanish soil was reachedThis was a condition which had notbeen anticipated The authorities heredid not regard it as serious or us likely to overcome a final settlement as itwas attributed to the Snanish sensitiveness against the humiliation involved in laving down their arms Atthe same time it wjs point onwhich neither side appeared to beready to yield 5One of the dispatches from thefrontafter specifying that this differencehad ariseniiddedjthat it was believedj settlement would be reached be toreFriday closed Gen Shafter himself summed up the situation by saying It cnii not be possible thatthere will be failure in completing arrangements No question whateverhas been raised as to the surrender itself Not only has Gen Toral agreedto it but this agrecmemt has been rati6ed by Gen Blanco at Havana and bvthe Spanish authorities at Madridj A cabinet official expresses doubt asto the sincerity of Gen Toral andsuggested that his negotiations forpeace were solely for the purpose ofdelay to enable him to strengthen hisposition by reinforcements from otherpoints in the Santiago districtiFear We May Get a Footinc in 1orto llcoMadrid July 16

it man or bird or beast Doubtlessthe boy being just a plain boy and notyet an angel now and then carries thissentiment too far but in the main itis a good thing It is this bold chivalrous temper that fills our ranks andmans our ships in the hour of needand makes our country invincible onJand and sea So my advice to parentswould be restrain it within due boundsbut be careful net to stamp it outEverybody knows that CommodoreDewey was an excessively combativeyoungster but we can forgive him nowIt was my share of this warlike spiritI presume that made me such a fervent admirer of Coot for Coot besidesbeing as intelligent as a dog and aspretty as a canary bird and not much-was as gallant a fighter as everwore feathers In view of the fact thathe once thrashed two big Spanish bullies more than three times his size hecertainly seems entitled to honorablemention now And a monument thist 5r gg1 m jsstood Coot ragged as a tramp hiscomb and wattles cruelly torn his headand neck black with clotted blood buthe was strutting proudly back andforth scramr his winjrs on theground and crowing in triumph Helooked as if he had been whipped threetimes overI caught devoted little warrior He still crowed as he lay in myhand I closed his beak with my fingersto stop him but as soon as I let go hecrowed again Yet his condition wasso deplorable that 1 carried him intothe house for hospital treatment andthe moment he was out of sight of thehens he dropped on his side and laypanting He was so weak that hecould scarcely stands for the Black Spanish louts theywere nowhere to be seen but after aprotracted search I found them crouching behind a pile of boards They wereI thoroughly cowed but not much hurtCoot with all his fine traits was undoubtedly vain and unduly fond oistrutting before the hens at all timesHe had a mate as dainty as himselfand smaller even than he and thesepractices of his vexed her for she wasd jealous little soul Her wrath however was directed wholly against theunoffending hens before whom the gayyoung cock disported himself and despite their superior size I have oftenseen her fly in their faces like a littlefury On such occasions Coot stood byrather sheepishly and never venturedto interfere He seemed to recognizein her a spirit fully equal to his ownHe was a perfect gentleman in all respects The other roosters wheneverthey found a particularly choice morsel would call together the hens andthen gobble it down just as the foremost fowl came running up Coot neverplajed any such low down tricks asthat though indeed he had smalltemptation for I doubt that he everknew what it was to feel hungry Hewas petted and pampered by all of usAfter breakfast 1 often brought himinto the house and he would stand onmy knee at table and eat of what remained on my plate as daintily as acanary birdHe had an uneasy conscience toowhich troubled him when he engagedin mischief as lie often did none theless When detected invading the flower garden where he knew that he wasforbidden to go he showed signs ofguilt exactly like a clever dog Atother times I could pick him up anywhere he would come to call if not toobusy but if I discovered him in thegarden I couldnt get near himand inhis demeanor there was every mark ofshameWhat became of the bright littlebird who flits like a summer butterflyacross the memories of my childhoodI cant teil you I never knew Whenhe was about three years old we movedaway to another village more thanT4K miles distant To take him with mewas declared impossible by a courtI- -

qm not ashamedBut it is time to give him a more formal introduction Coot was a Seabrightbantam of purest breed with black andtan markings partridge fashion andthe srraightest of tail feathers Hewasnt much bigger than a quail Hewas mine from the beginning He wasnothing but a tiny brown eg g when heinie into my possession and he was myespecial pet from the moment he toddled like an animated ball of thistledown from the broken shell He wasxeared in Uie large and extremelyheterogeneous family of an old graylien and manifested u domineeringspirit from the first It was very curious to see him lording it over his fosterbrothers who so rapidly outgrew himthat soon he could reach their heads f orpurposes of chastisement only by leaping high in the airFor a time they all submitted withoutquestion to his capricious tyranny and4 splendid Bluff then doubts bVgan t6arise especially in the muddy heads oftwo overgrown black Spanish fowlswho were getting so big that theylooked like

PARIS KY TUESDAY JULY 19 1898QUEER WAYS OF SHARKSThe Hungry Terror Is Impudent 1General but Cant Stand a Commotion in the Water JOne horror of sea fighting I believeour sailors will be spared in this warsaid a veteran of the merchant marineand that is the large chances of being killed by sharks The whole ofthe Caribbean sea about Cuba swarmswith those infernal things and as arule when a man drops overboard thechances are that in another minutenothing will be left of him on the surface but some red stains in tho waterunless he keeps his presence of mindand knows just what to doThere is a way of helping yourselfwhen you get into that fix Thats justwhy I say that in these modern battlesthe danger from sharks is not likely tobe anything like what it was in oldtimes Perhaps you are not aware thata shark is the most timid and nervousfish of prey that lives but it is soWhen you find yourself floating aboutin those waters and think a shark isanywhere near you just you kick andsplash for all you are worth If youdont think there are any sharks aboutkick and splash on general principlesthat is if you want to see your homeand your family again A shark thatis making straight for his prey willturn tail and sheer off as soon as thesplashing begins Now I believe thatin a general engagement between thesemodern ships that with the tremendous concussion of the heavy guns andthe churning of the water with propellers on all sides and an occasionaltorpedo raising a disturbance everynow and then in the water the wholeneighborhood will be cleared of sharksIn the old days although the broadsides made a good deal of noise nodoubt a ship went down much morequietly than now Just think of thecommotion in the water when the bigfires and the boilers go under Noshark will within a mile of suchan upheaval-I am not talking mere theory whenI sa that a shark can be frightenedoff by splashing 1 have seen it doneor to be quite exact I saw the manwho did it just after he had scrambledout of the water He had been in bathing in one of those sea baths they havein Kingston harbor where they fencein a good piece of water with pilesdriven into the bottom close togetherOne of the piles had got broken somehow and a big basking shark hadsqueezed through and gone to sleepin the bath When the man plungedin the shark woke up and commencedto charge around By that time theman was some yards away from thesteps He immediately turned on hisback and kicked as hard as he couldand the shark instead of charging athim went into a downright panic andbumped his nose against all the pileslooking for the hole he had got in byI know it sounds like a fable to saya shark is timid because they will dothings that you would hardly expecta timid fish to do I mj self have seena shark leap out of the water closeenough to a rowboat to tumble on theoar blades but that was my owndinghy and my boys knew how to rowand didnt make a splash with theblades or try any of this landlubberyfeathering business Then there is aplace at Port Iloyal where a little flightof wooden steps goes down into thewater and they say that a British artillery officer who was sitting on thosesteps or some other steps that werein the same place one morning smoking a cigar had both his legs torn off bya shark that swam close in shore androse at him as a trout rises at a fly Butall that only shows that a shark is aqueer in consistent kind of a fish andin spite of all his impudence you maydepend upon it he cant stand anything that makes a disturbance in thewaterOh yes when the battle is over hawill follow the ship that has any wounded men on board follow it for milesI dont know how he knows there is awounded man or a sick man on boarda ship any more than I can tell howMother Careys chickens can read thebarometer but

orchard wherethere are low spreading trees If thequeens wings are clipped there willbe comparatively little climbing afterswarms Some prefer shade boardsbut after having tried both for thecomfort of the apiarist and that ofthe bees Irdecidedly prefer the shadeof low spreading trees Grapevinesdo tolerably well but they do not protect the apiarist and at the time ofthe year when the shade is most needed they are sending out shoots andbranches that Interfere with the handling of the hive and grapevines dorequire an excessive amount of trimming just at the time bees need themost attention The colonies at ourout yard are placed in groups of threeon the north side of the low spreadingbass woods It is a great comfort aswell as a pleasure to work amongthese bees compared with what it isin the

the two sides then the tail endthen the neck wool Beginning at thetail end of the fleece roll toward theneck andthe fleece will somewhat resemble a spool of thread in shapeAbout five or six feet of wool twineowing to the size of the fleece shouldhave been previously prepared bydoubling it and lajing it on one end ofthe table Lay the fleece down on thestring with the two strings aboutsix inches apart and then pull thestring around the circular way of thefleece Part the strings running oneone way and the other in the oppositedirection having the strings crosseach other at the other end of thefleece turning the fleece one fourthround and running a string around itendwise at right angles to the lastone By this method as neat appearing fleece will be secured as can be tiedby any wool box Wool will be regarded with suspicion by buyers andcommisison men if tied Tip in too compact form It has the appearance ofbeing too heavy in proportion to thesize of the fleece Put on no morestring
