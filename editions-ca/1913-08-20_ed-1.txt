Short-ly afternoon a light rain fell, whichrfor a time threatened to preclude the9 I ovIiiViitifin -fnt flira iftornnnn Vint enriTi- , i..ulwu i.v.1 wv- miwuuuu, wu ouw.9s9999999wmm9999999-9999If You Live in a ModernHome, EquippedWith ElectricPhone for a Hot-Point Electric Iron to besent on two weeks FREE trialv Price$350.

Without doubt, the most unique feature of the day, was the cake, walk, thefirst to occupy a place on a programof a country fair in this section of theState, but which met with a heartyovation from the spectators, whowere moret han pleased with the performance of the colored people whoparticipated in the event.In the cake walk there participatedMose Watkins and companion, of At-jlanta, Ga., Bull Davis and companion,ul rviiuA-viiie, icuii., vieue vv imamsand companion, Paris, H. O. Reed andcompanion, St. Louis, Mo1., and Geo.Williams and companion, Paris. Watkins came out victor in the eventwith Davis second and Gene Williamsthird. Messrs. Charlton Clay, Sherman Goodpaster and Withers Davisacted as judges.So much interest has been manifested in the outcome of the cake walkthat it has been decided by the (management of the fair to make a specialring of a cake walk Friday afternoon,and the weather permitting, it shouldprove quite an attraction.Shetland ponies had their inning onthe opening day and the best productof the Blue Grass region was on exhibition. Competition in all of the ringswas very strong and it was difficult forthe judges to reach a decision.In the New York saddle class therewere five entries and this being oneof the most difficult rings of the afternoon for the judges to reach a decision, morje than one-half hour was consumed. Finally by the decision of thejudge Matlack & Shropshire, of Winchester, was awarded the first prize onGoldie McDonald, and Caywood &Hamilton, of North Middletown, second. The ring for the best colt, either sexunder one year old brought out tenentries, and the awards were made toJohn W. Collins & Son, North Middletown, first; R. H. Boardman, Flatton disregard of the law, excessivespeed and noise of these machines,and while the measure in its presentform could not in his estimation, become an ordinance, he recommendedthat it be referred to the City Solicitor for incorporation in part into thenew automobile and motorcycle ordinance which it is proposed to draft assoon as City Solicitor Denny returnsfrom the East.The ordinance was given its firstreading and referred to the City Solicitor. The-attention of the Commissionershaving been called to the danger fromautomobiles to persons alighting fromstreet cars, the matter was discussedand it was found to be the opinion ofthe Commissioners that a provisionshould be incorporated in the proposednew automobile ordinance directingthat all automobiles stop within tenfeet of street cars while dischargingpassengers.NOTICE.

ADVERTISING.Presistency is the most importantfactor in advertising keep hammering and you will get results.Persistent advertising in a poorspace position is more effective thanintermittent advertising in a goodposition. It is not profitable to let yourfirm name disappear from the columnsof your newspaper.Change of advertising copy is essential; but not too frequently. It is bekter to present good idea several timesthan to present several poor ideas atany time.Large advertisements have proportionately greater drawing power thans,mall ones. Increasing your space inproportion to the increase jn your business, is a sound sales policy.Nothing is more irritating than apoorly worded advertisement. "KoalI "Kow," "Kake" and "Mister" belong to, the barbarous age of advertising.Advertisements that breed ideas aremore effective than those that attempt to force tehir acceptance. Nobody likes to be commanded to buy;but nearly everybody can be easilyinduced to do so by proper suggestion or advice or by a statement offacts.An advertisement that answers aquestion exigtingTh the mind of a prospect is more effective than one thatattempts to both ask and answer aquestion. The use of "why" is apt toteach people the bad habit of askingquestions in return instead of listening to advice.Advertisements that present oneidea briefly and forcibly are morepowerful than those embodying several ideas illogically stated. Brevityis the soul of an effective advertisement. LUKE McLUKE SAYS:No matter how busy a woman maybe, she can always find time to worryfor fear someone will kidnap the children.
