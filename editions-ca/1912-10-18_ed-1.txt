WOODROW WILSON,of New Jersey.For Vice-President,HON. THOS. R.MARSHALL,of Indiana.For Congress,HON. J. CAMPBELL CANTRILL,of Scott county.For That Reason."Our own clear conviction as Democrats is that, in the last analysis, theonly safe and legitimate object of thetariff duties, as of taxes of every kind,is to raise revenue for the fsupport ofthe Government. Tariff duties, as theRepublican party has employed them,have not been a means of setting upan equitable system of protection.They have been on the contrary," amethod of fostering special privilege.They have made it easy to establishmonopoly in our domestic markets.Trusts have owed their origin andtheir secure power to them. Theeconomic freedom ot our people, ourprosperity in trade, our untrammeledenergy in manufacture depend upontheir reconsideration from top to bottom in an entirely different spirit. Itis obvious that the changes we makeshould be made only at such a rate andin such a way as will least interferewith the normal and fihealthful courseof commerce and manufacture. Butwe shall not on that account act withtimidity, as if we did not know ourown minds, for we are certain of ourground and of our object. Thereshould be an immediate revision and itshould be downward, unhesitatinglyand steadily downward."These arc Governor Wilson's viewson the tariffs and the trusts. Theyare the views of the"great majority ofthe Americans. They are the distinguishing charcteristics between thepurposes of Mr. Wilson's candidacyand those ot Mr. Taft and Roosevelt.For that reason, the great majorityof American voters are going to disregard party labels in order to give Mr.Wilson their support.Bumper Corn Crop.Corn cutting in Bourbon county isprogessing raoidiy and the crop is ofremarkable quantity and quality, averaging from 35 to 85 bushels to theacre.

Elam was engaged as a linemanand the accident occurred during anelectric storm, it being alleged thathe came in contact wih an electriclight wire, which threw him from thepole. In the fall his neck was broken,borne time ago the father of the twoboys, Levi Elam, while engaged incutting wood lost an eye as a result ofbeing struck by a flying splinter. Inthe past two years two members of thefamily havo met with violent deathsand the father suffered a berious accident.

Inone form or another it has been beforeCongress for several years and thepresent bill is an improvement on thosepreviously offered.It provides for a fixed appropriationfrom the Federal Treasury of 10,000per year unconditionally to everySlate. It further provides conditionalappropriations beginning with $300,000a year July 1, 1913 to be pro ratedamong the states, on the'.basis of ruralpopulation. This appropriation increases every year by the sum of $300,000 until a maximum of 3.000,000 isreached in 1923. No state will receive!its prorata of this sum until it appropriates an equal amount for thesame nrupose. The money goes to andis expended bv the State College ofAgriculture ineach state. At leaat 75per cent of the money must be usedfor actual field demonstrations ; 5 percent may be used for printing and publications, and the remaining 20 percent may be used for either householdeconomics or for further field demonstrations, As figured out by its advocates itwill cost the people of the UnitedStates Fbout eight cents per capita tomaintaint his scientific army in the agricultural field. "If the increased cropvalue is only twenty per cent," saysPresident Gross, of the National Fertility League, "the gain on one year'scrop would pay the cost of keeping upthis work for 250 years." The plan.,he believes, would in a few years,"double the production from the farm,make farming vastly, more profitable,reduce the cost cf living and give us alarge surplus for support."The value of farm demonstration hashas been shown so often and in somany different localities as to admit ofno doubt. Denmark is said to be thefinest agricultural country on theglobe, and it was made by farm demonstration. A generation or two agoDenmark was in hard lines and it wasdetermined to apply scientific agriculture as a remedy. The farm 'demonstrators wera sent out on. much thesame plan as proposed in the Leverbill, and the experiment proved to bea great success, bringing a nationfrom poverty to affluence.Every state in the Union is tryingto. do something to increase agricultural production, and the 'Federal Government is co-operating, but not to theextent that is demanded by the urgency of the situation. By the Lever billit is proposed to provide a way bywhich every statecan take up and carry on the work through the substantialassistance of the nation.Arm to Shed Joy.The joy-maker is the most neededman in the world; the pain-maker isall too .plentiful.Fire Damages Dwelling.Wednesday morning about ll :30o'clock fire broke out in the home occupied by Mr. Robert Turner on Weststreet.

By specious promises cunningly adapted to each thecolonel beckons them to follow withKeating approval wheresoever his bellwether adjutants may lead in orderthat Theodore Rex may again sit inthe White House.Tempting bait is thrown to the working people in the minimum wage, tothe Socialist iu the enlargement ofgovernment ownerships, to the women iu the furtherance of suffrage aspirations, to the farmer in blissful betterments of rural life, etc. Now he appeals to the quacks, those trite andhitherto despised men of predatorywealth, offering them tenderest regardaud freedom from prejudice "for oragainst." The following "blanket policy" is offered for protection of ourmost precious possessions health andlife:"We favor the union of all the existing agencies for fundamental government dealing with the public healthinto a .single national health servicewithout discrimination against or forany one set of therapeutic methods,school of medicine or school of healing,with such additional powers as niaybe necessary to enable it to performefficiently such duties in the protectionof the public from preventable diseases as may be properly undertakenby the fundamental authorities, including the execution of existing lawsregarding pure food, quarantine andcognate subjects, the promotion of appropriate action for the improvementof vital statistics, the extension of theregistration area of such statistics and:o-operation with the health activitiesof the various states and cities of thenauon. iThus would votes for Theodore Ilev jbe multiplied. JInsults Educated Physician. jThis quack plank of the Progressiveplatform not only insults the intelli 1gent voter, but wounds the educatedphysician, in that it places the latterin the same category with empirics ofhigh and low degree, rubbers, suncurists. magnetic and other healers andall other pretenders who fatten uponthe credulity of- the helpless sIHc andtheir terrified relatives. The Sun hasAdverted to the outrageous vio'alionof propriety and justice which c1i.-m.ic-terizesthe medical laws of seoralstates in the Union, the last instnr.ee of-which we deplored in the inedicai i gulations of the canal zone and whichthe bull moose platform threaten- toiufliet upon all the states in the I s.ion.These legislative enactments requireall persons who propose to lere,:;ephysicians not only to pursue a more orless thorough course of preparatoryeducation, bat also to be trained in allbranches of medicine and, besides, tobe subjected to a rigid examination byappointees of the state. All these serveto protect the public against ignorantpretenders and would be perfectly fairdid not the very same enactments exempt the latter from the provisions applying to educated practitioners.Favors For Cormorants.Thus do our sagacious legislatorstultify themselves in the interest ofthe cormorants to whom they grantspecial privileges, because, forsooth,they claim to "heal" without medicines! There is now no discriminationagainst "schools of medicine." Therefore the special protection demandedfor them by the bull moose platform isgratuitous and intended only to entrapvotes. The "healers" belong to noschool. Now comes Theodore Rex anddignifies them by a special provisionand, expressing a most tender regardfor their sensibilities, promises toshield them -against discrimination byeducated physicians.This platform would raise the quackand healer above the men who dailyexemplify their personal and professional superiority by some unselfishdevotion to the public weal. In hiseagerness to placate the influentialhorde of empirics Mr. Roosevelt wouldhave us oblivious of the fact that theeducated physician is the only realaltruist in the community. Instead ofarousing the public conscience (T. Rsfavorite slogan) this self appointed reformer deepens the crying shame andthus exemplifies again that "under nocircumstances" need he be bound byhis prior professions.President Taft has won the approvalof the quacks and healers by his medical regulations of the canal zone;hence this Machiavellian policy. Future generations will substitute "Rooseveltian" for "Machiavellian." Politicsmakes strange bedfellows indeed. Behold Taft and Roosevelt under thesame blanket! New York Sun.'

Itis a story of a lost flag and the lostcause, and the flag was the standardborne by Jefferson Davis' last escort.Mrs. Hoard is seeking to find the silken banner made of her sister's wedding dress but all her efforts havebeen of no avail.The story goes back to the beginning of the war. Women of Bathcounty, when the famous Ninth Kentucky rode out to the war, made agorgeous banner for Col. Stoner's battalliou. At the battle of Stone Riverthis flag was caDtured ana when thebattallion returned in '63 it was without a flag. Silks were scarce duringthose days the trials of war hadbrought economy and even suffering inmany a household but Mrs. Hoard,then Miss Ellen Sanders, and a veryyoung woman, offered to make a banner. Her sister's wedding dress served as material. The Hag was presented to the battalion. By the side ofGol. Stoner, Miss Sanders rode at thehead of the column as It started out onits mission. Above the two flutteredthe banner. In the fighting that followed the flag was lost. AH inquiriesby Mrs. Hoard, though sometimesthey unearthed vague information concerning the flag, were fruitless.
