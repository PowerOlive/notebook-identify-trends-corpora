The Colts and Bourbonites met in
Lexington Wednesday, in their first
tilt of the season, resulting in a victory
for the former by a score of 5 to 2 In
this contest Blankenshio lost his first

his abilities, as his teammates failed in
their support, and were unable to hit
Camnitz. the Colt twirler.

est. Ihe locals scored their two runs
in the third, when.Popkin reached sec

Thinks Bourbon Man Best Suited
Since the resignation of Col. E. F.
Clay, resigned as a memher of the Ken
tucky Racing Commission there have
been a number mentioned for the posi
tion. The Courier-Journal says 'that
while Fred A. Forsyth, who ha3 been
suggested as Col. Clay's successor, is
regard edasa gocd man for the dace
by all horsemen, the rank and file now
at Churchill Downs thin Catesby Wood
ford would make as efficient a member
ot the board as could be selected.
Many horsemen think Bourbon conuty.
i : r i t i 1.1 i i -i
jueiiJKau ivyai uu.ine cnorougnorea in
terest, should have a representation on
the board and that Col. Clay's succes
sor should come from that, county.
Catesby Wcodford has 'been promi
nent inltheturf world for more than
thirty years and like Col. Clay has the-
highest standing m the racing and
breeding universe. He ib the present
president of the Kentucky Association,
and his activity in the behalf of that
tract has much to do with the success
of racing at Lexington in the last few
years. At his sugest'on many refo ms
have been inaugurated in racing re
cently, which has gone to the credit of
horsemen who pushed thejssue to the
front, while Mr. Woodford, who sug
gested the measures remained in the
background. John T. Ireland has also
been suggested as a competent man to
fill Col. Clay's place, and he has a
strong following with credentials Hie
M r. Woodford, inasmuch as he also
comes from Bourbon county. Mr. Ire
land, like Mr. Wocdford, has long been
connected with racing and his record
on the course is above reproach.

Uses of Vanity.
An excess of vanity brings rldiculo
upon its possessor, just as an utter
lack of it inspires contempt in the
beholder. Of the two, ridicule is the
least, harmful; moreover, the object
of jibes and jests always possesses
the pGwer to modify and refine exces
sive vanity into wholesome, elevat
ing pride.

Yarn of the Deep Blue Sea.
One of the most unique battles ever
witnessed between creatures of the
sea occurred several years ago in the
Pacific. Frank Bullen, a sailor, tells
of seeing a duel between a whale and
an octopus. The arms of the mon
ster were entwined about the huge
head of the whale. The octopus had
eyes a foot in diameter, and a head
large enough to contain 350 gallons.
The whale was victorious.
Every gallon pays a big dividend
There's as much difference between sprayed and un
sprayed vegetables as there is between those grown on good
and poor soil. A gallon of spray material costs only a few
cents, but the increase in the value of vegetables sprayed with
it amounts to dollars. Try spraying as an investment;
S-ff BORDEAUX MIXTURE (paste) is a widely used fungicide for
garden use, put up in convenient paste form. This preparation is
particularly effective in checking mildew and other fungus diseases.
S -W Bordeaux is easily prepared as all that is needed is the addi
tion of water and it is ready to use. Retains its strength indefinitely.
