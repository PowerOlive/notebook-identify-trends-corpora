INTERESTING OH NOTES
Charles P. Mann, of Paris, sales
agent for the Lee-Kent Oil Co., re
ceived a telegram from theif field
agent at Beattyville, stating that an
other well on their lase has been
"shot" and that it proved to be a
promising prospect.
,The McCombs Producing & Refin
ing Company, at a recent meeting of
the Board of Directors at its newly
consolidated offices in Louisville, de
clared a quarterly dividend of 6 per
cent for the months of April, May
and June, payable on August 21. t
While not up to the record, pro
duction of oil from the' Kentucky
fields Continues satisfactory. For the
Lweek ending 'July 19, Cumberland
Pipe Line Company reports total runs
of 110,324.16 against 120,934. 37Uhe

610.21 barrels.
Recent oil developments in the vi
cinity of Torrent, Wolfe county,
where the big well of the Huff Oil
Company was brought in several
weeks ago and several smaller but
good producers have been struck on
adjacent leases, are turning the steps
of prospectors and operators to that
territory and it is expected that this
section will soon be the scene of
4
much drilling activity.
The water situation in the Lee
county fields is reported to be very
acute at the present time owing to
lack of rain in that section. A well
known oil man, who visited that sec
tion the past week, reports riding
down Big Sinking Creek for a dis
tance of five miles without finding
enough water to give his horse a
drink. A number of drilling rigs
operating in that sectjpn are said to
be shut down because of the scarcity
of water.

ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD PETER BILLI-
KEN TROTTING WONDER.
The real hero of the week's racing
in the Grand Circuit has been Peter
Billikin, the big, ungainly son ,of
Peter The Great and Baron's Lassie,
now eleven years old, but at the top
of his form and is one of the fastest
and gamest horses in training. Peter
Billikin was bread by R. K. Hart, of
Flemingsburg, and has been raced
continuously since his two-year-old
form.
Peter Billikin has raced through
out the better part of his life, and at
the age of eleven he has become one
of the greatest horses in training,
one likely to hold his own in the
best of company, and certainly the
greatest stayer now before the pub
lic. The extraordinary feature of the
career of Peter Billikin is that he has
been for several sjbasons a . second
class trotter, one which v has been
beaten by horses of little merit, yet
he has now come out for his eighth
season, and is far and away the best
horse of his age in training, being
one year older than that other re
Juvinated trotter, Mignola. For sev
eral years the son of Peter the Great
was owned in Bourbon county, but
was taken to Alabama and has been
raced by the firm -of Liver & Bacon,
both formerly of -Paris.

OF
Chief Justice John D. Carroll
closed his speaking campaign in the
race for the Democratic -nomination
for Governor last night, as far as his
schedule of appointments is arrang
ed. He spoke at Lancaster, Friday,
and it is thought he will make no
more speeches.
Beyond making public announce
ment of their candidacyfor office the
aspirants for Councilmen fn Paris
are seemingly making little effort to
rouse up the Democratic yoters.
They seem to be conducting a "gum
shoe' campaign from all indications.
In the firm belief that their .can
didate will win, the local adherents
of Judge Carroll and Gov. Black are
wagering considerable sums at even
money, with the Black people seem
ing to secure the largest share of
the bets. Both sides are confident of
success at the polls in August and in
November.

NEW YORK JUDGE HOLDS WAR
PROHIBITION CONSTITUTIONAL
Constitutionality of the war-time
prohibition act was upheld in an
opinion handed down in New York
last week by Federal Judge Thomas
I. Cha'tfield, of Brooklyn, in a test
- 'case 'against Stephen A. Minery, a
saloonkeeper, brought by the Liquor
- ! Dealers' Association of" Connecticut.
Judge Chatfield's decision was pased
upon testimony he heard recently in
New Haven, where he sat in the place
of Federal Judge Edwin S. Thomas,
of Connecticut.
Minery, backed by the Connecticut
liquor men, in order to "test the valid
ity of the law, opened a saloon in
Meriden. He was arraigned before
Judge Chatfield in New Haven on the
charge that o-n or about July 7 last
he sold intoxicating liquor "unlaw
fully and knowingly before the con
clusion of the present war and before
the termination of demobilization,
the date of which is to be determined
by the President."
The saloonkeeper was defended' by
Arnold A. Ailing, State Prosecutor of
Connecticut, who demurred to the
charge against Minnery on the
ground that the law was unconstitu
tional and that, as peace had been re
stored, it was not a wartime meas
ure. Jl
