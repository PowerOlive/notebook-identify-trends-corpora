old residents near Belmont N Y
writes For twenty seven years I had been
a constant sufferer from nervous prostra
tion and paid Targe sums of money for doc
tors and advertised remedies without bene
fit Three years ago my condition was
alarming the least noise would startle and
unnerve me I was unable to sleep had a
number of sinking spells and slowly grew
worse I began using Dr Miles Restorative
Nervine and Nerve and Liver Pills At first
the medicine seemed to have no effect but
after taking a few bottles I began to notice
a change I rested better at night my appe
tite began to improve and I rapidly grew
better until now I am as nearly restored
to health as one of my age may expect God
