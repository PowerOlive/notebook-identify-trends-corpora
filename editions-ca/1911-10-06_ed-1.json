can't help thinking there's something
wrong with these plays we've been

Never Drink Water.
In Lower California a large number
of the smaller desert mammals never
drink water, according to American
scientists who have recently visited
the peninsula. They live and thrive
on dry seeds and scraps of vegetation
in places where the heat and aridity
are excessive without ever touching
their lips to water, and it has even
been found impossible to teach some
of them to take water in captivity.

NEGROES FIGHT AT DANGE
One is Badly Injured and May
Die While Others are Hurt
in Millersburg Brawl.
VICTOR'S ASSAILANT HELD.
Delayed Bid Holds off Comple
tion of Lighting Plants
Other Millersburg News
As a result af an altercation which
took place Mtoday night at a dance
hall in the Hers settlement known as
t-he "Tin Cuf," between several of the
eelerad race of this place and the
negro m'embers of a theatrical troupe
who have buen giving entertainments
here, Sam Victor, one of the partici
pants, is in a Lexington hospital under
treatment and there is said to be little
chance for his recovery, while others
were less injured in a free-for-all fight.
Last Friday night a company of fcur
negroes, two men and two women,
claiming to be a traveling minstrel
troupe, came here from Carlisle and
put on two entertainments, Friday and
Saturday nights at the colored I. O. O.
F. Hall. For ssme reason they remain
ed over a few days this week, board
ing in the home of Geo. Clay, colored.
Monday evening a dance was given,
also a free entertainment by the
troupe. Ed Victor and Bud Miller got
into an altercation which was thought
to have been quieted by Johnson, one
of the troupe.but the trouble was soon
renewed, when at the conclusion of a
dance, Miller claims to have accident
ally stepped on Victor's foot. At this
juncture a scrap ensued and after some
difficulty Victor was ejected from the
house, but returned later after lhaving
procured a grass hook from the back
porch and was again ejected.
The entire party thei went to the
street and proceeded toward the foot
of the hill approaching town fighting
all the way using rocks and other mis
siles. Sam Victor, who at the time
the trouble becan. wan nnt on thP
scene was notified by the time they
reached the top of the hill and appeared
at once in defense of his brother. He
was struck in the back of the head
near the ear, the blow rendering him
unconsious For a time excitement
reigned supieme arid not until the ar
rival of Marshal Williams did matters
quiet. A physician waa summoned,
several stitches were required to clcse
a wounJ in the head of Ed Victji.
tiui.ii mtjtxee recievta severe cuts on
one hand and Johnson, a showman, a
blow on his head.
Sam Victor was takn to St. Joseph
Hospital, Lexington, Tuesday morning
by Dr. W. G. Daily, and from present
indications it looks as .though he will
not recover. Ed Victor, Bud Miller,
ueo. .branch, Junus January and John
son, the showman, were all anestej
and taken before Judge Waddell Tues
day morning at Police Court The cases
first called were those of Victor and
Miller, the former pleading guilty.
Victor claims he was cut about the
head with a pair of brass knucks ry
Miller, who he alleges started the
trouble. Both were fined $10 each.
Dan Elit, accused of striking Sam
Victor, was next tried. Evidence in
the case was conflicting and ne vsas
held to answer the next grand jury, in
default of bond fixed at $500 he was
taken by Marshal Wililams to Paris
where he was lodged in jail.
It seems as if Victor and Miller had
two altercations during the day Mon
diy, one at the depot at Millersburg
and one at Paris. As to the nature of
these altercations we are unable to
ascertain. Miller admits that he booz
ed some while at Paris and it is claim
ed oy some present at the Clay ho'i,e
that Victor was also drinking. Miller
is already under a $50 bond for an
offense of some weeks ago. TheJohn
son negro claims to hail from Chicago,
while Elit is from Abington, W. Va.
French and January who were also ar
rested have not yet been tried on ac
count of the absence of important wit
nesses. Delay in receiving bids for the com
pletion of the plant and the furnishing
and installation of a dynamo is
lengthening the period which separates
t he citizens of Millersburg from an
electric current. At the regular meet
ing of the City Council Wednesday
night this matter was to be taken up
but owing of the failure of one bid to
arrive further action was deferred.
Little businesb was before the council
at this meeting. Mr. D. E. Clarke
was granted a permit to erect a ware

Pork Favorite Chinese Food.
The Chinese eat little or no beef.
The beef consumed in the empire is
chiefly the food of foreigners. But
the natives are exceedingly fond of
pork and consume vast quantities of
it. Not only is the native article an
excellent grade, but Chinese pork is
retailed at a price far lower than the
mere cost of production in this, coun
try. American pork could not com
pete with that of China, even if there
were no question of transportation.
Ready With Suggestion..
A superintendent of a city Sunday
school endeavored to give the summer
meetings added attractiveness. Upon
a certain warm Sunday lemonade was
served. At the close of the service the
superintendent announced that slips
of paper would be passed round and
the pupils allowed to make sugges
tions as to methods of making the
meetings still more attractive. One
youngster wrote: "Put more sugar in
the lemonade."

turned from his second trip to New

etc., had gone like hot cakes aid ic
was absolutely necessary that he make
his second visit East. He said he was
much pleased with his visit as Jit was
very profitable one as he was able t
get things that were right up to the
miaute in ladies suits, cloaks and
dresses that were not even shown in
the early fall. Th second consign
ment of these goods are arriving

Bonds are attractive, bub dis
crimination should be exercised
whether you are buying Municipal,
Corporation or Realty bonds or
stocks.
Government Bonds are represen
tative of strength but small in
come, and money is "worth more
than the return of Government
issues.
Municipal Bonds vary as to in
come. Corporation Bonds are pur
chased by investors who can dis
criminate and secure larger in
come. We are prepared to offer at all
times lists of attractive bonds that
have been passed upon by recog
nized and capable authorities.

Bonds have been heavily liquidat
ed; at present prices they net

The convertible Bond issues of
several of the railroads and indi

means of securing conv rtible
