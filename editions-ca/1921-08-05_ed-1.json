SWIFT & CO.'S WEEKLY PRODUCE
MARKET HE VIEW
Butter production is showing a
slight decrease. A lighter accumu
lation in storage and constantly in
creasing demand for current use
have resulted in advanced -prices in
producing centers.
Liberal receipts of poultry have
arrived during the week and this is
reflected in lower prices on Eastern
markets.
There has been a fair clearance
of recent accumulations' of fresh
eggs. There is a better inquiry for
good stock and prices are quoted a
little higher, although the. quality
is not generally satisfactory. Great
er care of the eggs on the farm and
more frequent marketing will prob
ably result in producers realising.
