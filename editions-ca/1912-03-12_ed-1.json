The City Council" in regular meeting
Wednesday night transacted but little
business. After allowing a few ac
counts, a report was made from the
committee showing the electric plant
to ba in excellent condition, the lights
giving thorough satisfaction and being
taken raoidly by private consumers.
The committee was asked to make a
flat rate for churches, lodges and other
buildings where they were not used
regularly. The question of purchasing
a chemical fire engine was brought up
and the Mayor is communicating with
several concerns relative to this.
The recital given by the voice de
partment of the M. F. C. at the audi
torium Friday night was decidedly one
of the best of the season. There are
more girls in the institution this year
with good voices than for many years
past. The solos, duets, and choruses
were well selected and equally well
executed. The large audience in at
tendance braved the elements, every
one seeming to expect something
above the ordinary and they were not
disappointed. "The Rosary" rendered
by Mrs. Deering, brought forth a
storm of applause and she responded
to the encore. "May Morning" and
"Serenade," rendered by Miss Barnes
with violin obligato by Miss Nell, ap
pealed to evrey lover of music in the
house. Miss Barnes has an especially
good voice and Miss Nell as a violinist
is unexcelled in the amateur world.
Her tones are pure, full of expression
and feeling. The closing chorus of the
recital was also one of the pleasing
features of the occaison. The musical
department of the. college is certainly
well equipped and the work of the
pupils demonstrate most satisfactorily
the ability of the teachen.
"A ROYAL SLAVE" CUMING.
The-Daily Journal of Jacksonville,
111., in its issue of January 31 says of
"The Royal Slave" Company, which
will appear at the Poris Grand on
March 29 :
" 'A Royal Slave" was greeted with
a large and enthusiastic audience at
the Grand last night, the three floors'
of the theater being well filled, in fact
the largest house for a popular priced
attraction this season. The audience
was given a delightful surprise and a
genuine dramatic treat. loo much
cannot be said of the time tried and
unique play. Manager hubb kept his
word with the public and gave the
people of Jacksonville one of the best
dramatic performances seen here in a
long time. The company carries com
plete scenery for the five acts and
eight scenes, as well as a clever acting
cast, The wardrobe is a special fea
ture, especially notable being the
gowns worn by Miss Irene RSolomon,
which were imported from the Worth
shops of Paris. Mr. Bubb has the dis
tinction ofbeing the first .manager to
present in this city an original import
ed 'Chantecleer' costume, which was
worn by Miss Ella Malmrosn and made
a decided hit. Mr. Walter Hubbell, an
old favorite witn Jacksonville theatre
goers, gave a most clever interpreta
tion of the faithful old Indian, 'El
Aguilla. "

DANGERS OF PHOTOGRAPHING
THE WORLD' DOING.
Perhaps at some time you may have
stood on a1 street corner and breath
lessly watched a man with a camera
perched on the topmost girder of a
skyscraper cooly taking a moving pic
ture of the panoramic scenes hundreds
of feet below him. Or you may have
seen him at military maneuvers while
a hundred horses thundered down upon
him at breakneck speed. Possibly at
still another time you may have seen
tne camera man at the most perilous
turn of an automobile race course
calmly photographing the roaring
racers as they rushed on' at sixty miles
an hour, and your heart stood still un
til the dust cloud blew aside and show
ed you the pictorial news gatherer
was still alive. You marveled that
any human being would take such
tisks. But these risks are 'very much
a part of the day's work for the staff
photographers of Lyman H. Howe
whose travel festival comes to the
Paris Grand on Thursday, April 18.
Mr. Howe and his staff are constantly
watching the world, and very often,
with an intuition torn of experience
they anticipate and prepare for many
events before they occur. It is because
of such preparation that the scenes of
any given subject Mr. Howe presents
are exceptionally complete. His
organization is world wide and through
it he photographs the news just as a
great newspaper with its foreign
correspondents write it. In nearly
every big cily the world over Mr
Howe has his representative a man
who is always alert and of proven
resource and courage. In addition to
them he has still others who are roam
ing ceaselessly over the entire globe,
sighing, like Alexander, for more
worlds to conquer, and, unlike Alex
ander, constantly finding them, as is
indicated by the entirely new program
which Mr. Howe will present.
The management of the Paris Grand
after several weeks' effort last week
succeeded in booking for the Grand
"The Girl of My Dreams, "conceded by
everyone who has seen it to be the
finest production of its kind ever seen
in Kentucky. The company embraces
sixty people, with John liyams and
Leila Mclntyre, the original stars of
the company. Besides being a mam
moth and finished production, both
8cenically and artistically, a special
orchestra of seven first class musicians
is carried by the company.
To secure this production it 'was
necessary for the managers of the
Grand to give them a large guarantee,
trusting to a liberal patronage of the
people of Paris and surrounding towns
to enable them during next season to
secure other shows of this magnitude.
Information in regard to seats, etc.,
may be secured by calling up Mitchell
& Blakemore. The date of this princi
pal theatrical event in the history of
Paris will he Thursday, April 4.
Sleep in Church, but Don't Snore.
An English preacher has invented a
cure for snoring in church. It's a little
mental contrivance that the disturber
of a parson's peace of mind places in
a position on his lips and nostrils, and
the Rev. A. Allen Barrett, vicar of
Claygate, England, who evolved the
idea, says any sleeping churchgoer
thus decorated can't let loose a single
snore to disturb other worshipers in
their bully snooze every Sunday morn
ing till it's time to get up from the
pew for dinner. New York Press.
