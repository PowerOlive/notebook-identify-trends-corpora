producerWhat producerWhatWhat he buys buys b ys costs more and andmore more what he sells is cheaper The reason for forthis forthisthis shows the fallacy and amjustness of the protective system for it plunders plundersthe plundersthethe farmers for the benefit of a few trusts and combines that are enabled by bythe byythethe tariff to raise the price of their products produc to tb just below the point where wheresimilar wheresimilarsimilar foreign products could be imported and pay the tariff tax and be sola solain soloinin competition with the trust products productsThe productsTheThe wheat
