JOINT MEETING EDUCATIONAL
AND PRESS ASSOCIATION.
The big event of the K. E. A. this
year is the joint session on Thursday
evening, June 26, of the Kentucky
Educational Association and the Ken
tucky Press Association. It will be
the first time that the teachers and
editors have met together. These two
organizations represent greater qower
than any other in the State, and their
coming together on June 26th means
that they are in earnest about the
reconstructions problems which face

Tacoma and Seattle, away up in
"Washington, and other communities
out in that direction, are having a
wordy wrangle over what to call the
great mountain that towers to the r
clouds "just across the river." It is
set down in the geography as Mount
Rainer, but the people of Tacoma call
it Mount, Tacoma, and now there is
a considerate number of persons in
that country who want it named af
ter tb,e late - Col. Roosevelt they
Ijvaafc. it called Mount Roosevelt.
TThe name "Rainer" was given the
mo&O-tain by the Canadians, in honor
of a British Admiral of that name
who sank an American vessel during
the Revolutionary War. Naturally,
the name is not particularly popu
lar on this side of the border. The
Indians called it "Tacoma" the
tribe itself bore the same name,
which means simply "the mountain."

GREAT INTEREST IN NEW TRAC-
TION LINE.
Louisville business men are taking
active steps to assure success of the
project for connecting Louisville
with Lexington and the Bluegrass
through construction of a traction
line between Shebyville and Frank
fort, joining the lines of the Ken
uirir Tprminal & Traction Com
pany, running out of Lexington to
Frankfort, and the Louisville & In
terurban Railway Company, running
from Louisville to Shelbyville.
Through freight and passenger
service between Louisville and the
Bluegrass, long regarded as essential
to a full interchange of business be
tween Louisville and Central Ken
tucky communities and to offset com
petition from Cincinnati and other
cities, is offered in the new project.
Twenty-one miles of traction line,
costing approximately $400,000,
must be built to close up the gap.
The- Frankfort & Shelbyville Electric
Railway Company, incorporated in
October, 1917, lias a ninety-nine-yeax
franchise, has obtained rights-of-way
through the full length of the
route and has traffic agreements as
" suring through freight and passen
ger rates with connecting lines.

"Good land for blackberries" is an
expression, used by many owners of
good soil, when describing the pro
ductive qualities of a piece of land
that appears to be rather barren. It
would seem, however, that the de
spised briar is to be the real aristo
crat this year. With the fruit crop
at about zero, strawberries few and
far between, and only a bunch of
grapes here and there, the good
housewife will be willing to risk
staining and scratching her hands,
that the shelves in the cellar may not
be entirely empty. The heavy bloom
which all the members of the briar
familjr are putting forth, is certainly
a welcome sight and when the win

an acre or two of "good land for

suffrage and various otner causes,
and whatever his subject or wher
ever he speaks, there is usually an
overflow meeting.
Kentucky's Governor, one of Ken

evening.
There are eleven thousand teach

LAUNDRIES IN CHURCHES
(World Outlook.)
Hand laundries in churches! Why
not! Man must be clean of body as
well as pure of heart. They believe
this out in Pasadena, Calif., where
they recently replaced a rude chapel,
which hadn't a pane of glass in it,
with this institutional church for
Mexicans.
It cost $6,000. But that isn't much
when It is on record that besides the
hand laundry, it has a dormitory for
men, a day nursery, club and class
rooms.
The Centenary of Methodist Mis
sions is planning to build sixty-five
churches of this kind and a great
Plaza Community Center at Los An
geles, also.
HOUSE OP LORDS TO ALLOW BE
QUEST POR DEATH MASS.
Heretofore it has been illegal to
to make bequests in the United King
dom for the saying of masses for the
dead. The money so left reverted
back to the estate for the benefit of
the next of kin.
The House of Lords has brought
joy to the hearts of Roman Catholics
all over the world by changing the
law. From now on it is lawful here
to make such, bequests.

SIX FORGOTTEN NATIONS
(Standard Union.)
Self-determination is uppermost in
the minds of the 5,000 members of
the six nations, now wards of the
Canadian Government and occupying
a reservation in the province of On
tario. The dog question has made it
a burning issue. The Indian Depart
ments wants to tax the red men's
dogs, and the Indans protest, basing
their legal objections on treaty rights
which stipulates that these folks are
"allies" of the Canadian Government
and therefore an independent people.
The Indians will fight the proposed
tax through the courts if need be,
not only because they are as anxious
as ever to maintain their rights, but
because the more dogs an Indian com
munity has the happier the inhabi
tants are. The descendants of the
"Romans of the West," as the Iro
quois confederacy was rightly called,
retained much of the pride, firmness
and haughtiness of their forefathers.
They always did stand out for what
they considered their own, and in do
ing so now are demonstrating that
the old spirit is alive even though it
may have seemed extinct."
The mail to the chairman's office
is heavy with letters from Kentucky
Masons in the State and out. It is
becoming evident that the amount
which will be raised will go beyond
the million dollar mark, Mr. Holland
said.
Organization of the forces under
the direction of the committee is be
ing rapidly completed throughout the
State. There will he. a division of
the State into congressional dis
tricts, and a further division by
counties." Where there is more than
one lodge in the county there will be
an organization for each lodge. Com
mittee members are writing Mr. Hol
land of the completion of their orga
nizations and the rapid strides the
canvassers are making.
