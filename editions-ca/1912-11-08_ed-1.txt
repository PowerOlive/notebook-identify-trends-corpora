' : jInsurance Suit Involves BigSum.A million or two million dollars, itis believed, is involved in the outcomeof an agreed suit soon to be filed inthe Franklin Circuit Court by theMetropolitan Insurance Companyagainst the State Insurance Department to enjoin it from collecting dataconcerning former policy holders mthe old Sun Life Insurance Company.The Sun company, which was merged into the Metropolitan, did an industrial insurance business, and had thousands of policy holders in this State.The law governing the operations ofthese companies Drovides for a participating policy, nonforfeitable after fiveaif WJt" V"E B"'iC"u Vdluc;The law provides that its terms cannot,, ,j.u v. .,.,4 .!..be waived byany stipulation in thepolicy or contract with the insured.The nurpose was to protect the rightsof the class of people who take cutsmall policies on weekly payments. Itis said that the Metropolitan," whichdoes a big industrial business, has absorbed twenty-seven such companiesin the United States.It is claimed that a considerableportion of the policies lapsed beforebecoming due, and it is alleged by theState that many of the Sun cnniDany'spolicies lapsed alter 'they had beenpaid for five years, and thereby became incontestable with a cash surrender value, which liability, the department claims, has been transferredto the Metiupolitsn.For several months representativesof the insurance department have beenin New York ., collecting informationabout the policy holders in the Suncompany. The Metropolitan, it is reported, agreed to publish a list of thepolicies which had been paid up forrive years by their numbers, and paythem as claims were presented. Tothis the department declined to agree,but did consent that the companyshould file an injunction on an asreedstatement of facts to test the right ofthe department to take a list of theclaimants with the evidence irom thebooks of the cmnany.Ancients Knew of Elevators.That the ancient Romans knewhow to works lifts is the latest discovery reported from Rome in connectionwith the Palatine excavations.
