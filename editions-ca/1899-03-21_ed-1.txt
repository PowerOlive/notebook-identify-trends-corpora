lacecurtain burst forth from the secondfloor of the Windsor hotel at 47thstreet and Fifth avenue shorty after3 oclock Friday afternoon just as theSt Patricks day parade was passingthe building and in a few momentsthey had leaped up to the roofand enveloped the entire Fifthavenue and 47th street frontsof the hotel Ten minutes laterthe flames were roaring through theinterior of the hotel and all escapeby means of stairwaj s and elevatorswas cut oft There was the wildestscene of excitement within and without the building Hundreds of guestsand employes were in the hotel whenthe fire broke out and for many ofthem to escape with safety was impossibleSoon after the first alarm was givenpeople in the lower floors of the hotelthose who had eas access to the streetand the stairway commenced to pourout of the building in great numbersbut it soon became very apparent thata great majority of the occupantsof the hotel were either panicstricken or unable to maketheir way to the ground floorWindows were thrown up on evcryside of the building and the guestsmostly women in all stages of terrormade their appearance and utteredfrantic appeals for assistance to thecrowd below As the flames gatheredabout them they became more andmore terror stricken and presentlysome of them stood upon the narrowwindow sills and beckoned to the spectators that they were about to leapThe men collected upon the sidewalksready to render any assistance theycould and in the meantime some ofthe women left the window sills anddropped to the streets In most instances the efforts to catch them audbreak their awful fall were unavailingfor they struck the sidewalk and inmost cases broken limits were the resultAs soon as the firemen could gettheir scaling ladders into position theyclimbed the sides of the building andentered at every window where therewas an unfortunate guest appealingfor assistance and many cases of heroic rescue were witnessed by thethrong in the streets At the corner of47th street and 5th avenue directlyacross from the hotel is the home ofMiss Helen Gould and at her direction many of the injured werecarried there and were treated byphysicians and nurses whom she hadsent for In the meantime the chief ofpolice had telephoned to every hospitalin the city asking that assistance besent Ambulances forced their waythrough the crowds as quickly as possible and the injured people who hadmade the frightful leaps from the hotelwindows were placed in them and removed to the hosp tals Several occupants of the hotel appeared at the windows of the sixth and seventh storiesand even on the roof and leaped to thestreets from those pointsVery few of them escaped either instant death or injuries which resultedin their death a short time laterOne of the most daring rescues effected by the firemen occurred on thefifth floor on the 5th avenue frontAn elderly woman was seen at a window and two firemen succeeded inreaching the window immediately underneath One of

removing thedebris of the Windsor hotel fire in theeffort to discover the bodies that aresupposed to lie buried there Ail daylong 200 men labored as much as themisty muddy steaming mass of brokenstones twisted iron and crushed brick would admit A heavystifling vapor arose continuallyretarding progress of the workers andkeeping them for the most part awayfrom the center of the ruins FromFifth avenue much of the debris thathad fallen into the street hadbeen cleared away and themen were able to reach a portionof the first floor What small portionsof wall could be blasted down wereleveled but the great pillar of brick atthe 47th street end still stood It wasin such a threatening condition thatthe police notified the residents of thehouses across the street to remain inthe rear of their dwellings to preventany fatalities when the crash cameUp to midnight no bodies had beendiscovered and no more deaths frominjuries received at the fire were reported from the hospitals but a number of the injured were still in a serious condition The death list remainsthe same as Saturday sixteen andthe list of missing has been reduced to44 as a number of those previously unaccounted for reported in person orhad been located by friendsJust before midnight two sections ofthe rear or eastern wall of the hotelfell in with a mighty crash Fortunately no one was near and the collapse was more beneficial than otherwiseTwo engines were still on the groundat a late hour throwing streams on thewreckThe only things found during theearly part of the night were a set ofartificial teeth on a gold plate and somearticles of clothingSunday night the persons living inthe three houses nearest to the wall on47th street were ordered out by the police because of the danger of its beingblown down by the high windThe ruins still smoulder and thesmoke and gases blowing in the facesof the workers made their task one ofgreat toil and hardship From time totime men were compelled to desistfor a few minutes By midnightthe laborers had excavated backfrom the front building line and tothe sub basement for a distanceof fifteen feet The great value ofjewels and jewelry in the wreck madethe men work carefull Each shovelful of the refuse was carefully examined before being placed in the cartsPolicemen both in uniform and in theguise of foremen mingled with theworkingmen and carefully watchedtheir every movement Morethan that the men weresearched at the end of their shiftsMany of the men resented this sayingthat it was unnecessary and protesting that no man would think of takingsuch property and especial- under thecircumstances The contractors andthe officials of the building department were obdurate however and saidthey would take no chances and thatevery one

BOURBON NEWhich Is the Better PolicyPaducah one of the most enterprisingand flourishing cities in the State andwith the largest wholesale and manufacturing business outside of Louis vilehas compromised the franchise taxes onall its corporations at the uniform rateof fifty cents on the dollar This includes the street railway bankselectric companies and all other corporations of a semi public natureThe compromise is the adoption of nonew policy with Paducah The citizensrecognized long ago that the arbitraryrequirement of the new Constitutionwere incompatible with their businessinterests for capital could not be attracted to a city where the pound offlesh nominated in the bond was to beexacted The banks had contractsagreements with the State whereby inconsideration of the relinquishment ofcertain old chartered rights they accededto an increase of 50 per cent in theirtaxation and were guaranteed a continuance of that rate The new Constitution apparently overrode this agreement and demanded the ad valoremassessment of bank capital and all otherproperty Here was a serious dilemmaThe banks had undoubtedly a cause ofaction both in law and in equity andit was plain that not only must longand expensive litigation result shouldthere be an attempt to enforce the advalorem method of taxation but therewas also the reasonable certainty thatcapital would be driven away therebycontracting business and restricting employment Under these circumstancesthe citizens of Paducah cutthe Gordianknot by a straight square out compromise that provided a largely increased revenue for the city while atthe same time it conceded liberally tothe fact that if the tanks had ma de ahard bargain under the Hewitt law itwas a bargain nevertheless that had beenfully sanctioned by the State authoritiesThen as it would not be right to treatone set of corporations one way and another in a different fashion and as thesame reasons against excessive taxationheld with them they were given thesame terms All were treated alike allplaced upon a common levelHow different the case in anotherbusy city in the famous Pennyrilesection a city with much the same natural advantages as Paducah In Hopkinsville there is a bank that ha4 had acapitalization of 250000 which is verylarge for a town of that size Thisbank likj others in the State appliedI or a compromise of its tax but wasend be paid by the insured Allrefused Negotiations dragged aloneand finally as we understand it theCity Touucil absol itely refused to consider a compromise insisting that thefull amount of the taxes be paid Theresult was that last week the Bank ofHopkinsville filed articles iu the officeof the Secretary of State reducing itscapital stock from 350000 to 100000on which it will hereafter be afcsessedThe othr 150000 will probably be soinvested in bonds that it will escape theAssessor and will contribute nothing toits share of the public burdens At thesame time the banking capital of Hopkinvrille being thus contracted aud taxation on what remains being higher therate of interest will be increaned andborrowers will have to pay the penaltyof Hopkins villea severe policyThe action of the Bank of Hopkinsville has been in line with that of manybanks ot Louisville Lexington Danville Covington Newport Middlesborongh and every other town and city inthe State An instance in point InGlasgow is an old and well estaolishedprivate bank managed with a skill andconservatism that have been of greatbenefit to the business development ofBarren county and that section whileat the same time the owner has accumulated a fortnne This bank had acapital of 40000 and a surplus of 20000 total 60000 When it becameevident that the ad valorem rate of taxation would be insisted upon the head ofthe bank made what bargain advertisements would term a sweeping re-J duction of capital and is now payingtaxes on 10000 instead of 60000 Hispolicy was the same as that which hastaken many millions of dollars out ofthe banks and other corporations in thisState and may result in driving ontmillions moreThe Paducah policy has been satisfactory to the citizens of the beautifuland prosperous capital of the Purchase The policy pursued elsewherehas antagonized enterprise and capitaland business and labor have had tosnffer while in the aggregate the revenues of the

of PhiladelphiaThe business men of Paris are opposedto the unjust war now being wagedagainst the fire insurance companiesThe agitation is very disastrous to thecredit of those merchants who obtainaccommodation from wholesalers andbankers or an extension of credit on thestrength of stock on hand or ownership of buildings of various kinds butcannot do this when the protection offire insurance is momentarily in dangerof being withdrawn As the rates ofthe companies have not been excessive orexhorbitant the merchants do not believe there is any just occasion for theassessment of beayy fines that will result in the total withdrawal of all fireunderwritersThe News is informed of one company alone that has paid 17000 morein losses to Parisians than it has receivedin premiums This is true in variousdegrees of other companiesThe juries who have indicted andtried the companies for their allegedcombine were composed mostly offarmers who are affected least by awithdrawal of the companies Thewhole burden of r sk and anxiety fallson the town property holders as theypay the major portion of the premiumsWithout insurance no sane business manwould lend money on any

byhis strange power abducted his victimCHAPTER XYIIGielow came back to consciousnessthrough a maze of dreams He seemedto be in the studio laughing at Henrifor draping a curtain awkwardly Nexthe was with Dorothy in the conservatory at her home she never hadseemed so beautiful Then a swiftdraught of cold air seemed to be striking his feet and ankles She held someflowers towards him and he tried totake them but could not lift his handor stir a muscle She glided awaymelting into a vast bank of orchids butwhen he essayed to follow his feetseemed chained to the floor He gavea sudden cry of terror as she vanishedand his voice seemed to rebound fromthe walls and ceiling which appearedto have contracted Then he awoke andfound himself enveloped in such profound darkness that he wondered ifbis soul were released from his bodyand adrift in spaceGreat God he exclaimed Whatcan this mean Where am IHe tried to recall his latest consciousmoments but his brain seemed benumbed Everything was chaos Hemoved his hand and felt a clasp ofcold steel on his wrist He heard achain rattle Aghast terrified ineffably he moved the other hand It alsoa chained to the stones beneath himFie attempted to draw up his feet Theytoo were manacledThen he lay motionless and iedoror to recall past events Dorothv Yes he remembered calling ontier and humbly confessing his sorrow for having publicly quarreled withCaruthers She had readily forgivenhim and shed tears at something shewould not explain He rememberedtelling her that he was not going tothe reception at the Palace hotel the following night She understood that heshrank from being seen publiclythough she begged him to go and danceauce with her She reminded him thatCaruthers was away but even that didnot alter nis aeienmiwuuu parly for she and her aunt were goingto the Horse Show with Count Bantinniand it was almost time for her to dTessNThen he remembered how hard heworked all -the next day and how hethrew himself that night on a loungeand tried to sleep Finding thishotel and stood around in the crowdnear the ladies entrance Here he wasmet by Count Bantinni The count hadsuch a strange gleam in his black eyesand for a wonder was not wearing evening dress1 want to have a talk with you hesaid in a gentle tone You have evadedme for a long time I am your friendand will prove it Come with me to myapartmentsGielow went with him to his chambers in the next block It seemed tohim from Bantinnis tone that he hadsomething important to communicateThen what had happened Ah yesThe count had turned up the gas in hisluxurious smoking room and ordereda bottle of wine His first words wereth very soul of humble candor and sopatheticMy friend said the count weought to sympathize with eadh otherand bear no ill will 1 am suffering thepangs of hell I love your sweetheartwitli all my soul I have loved her passionately since the moment F first sawher I too am miserable I walk thestreets in agqny 1 know how you feeland I sympathize wtb youTear were in Bantinms eyes Helook the listless hand of the artist andpressed it Gielow was too unhappylo repulse him and by and by it seemedthat he really liked the ItalianI deaden my pain of heart said thecount You know that I understandthe use of hypnotism I apply it to myself when I am most miserable Youneed rest allow me to calm you It isvery simpleId rather not said Gielow but thecount had spoken soothingly and thenwhv that was the last thing- he couldrememDer excepting yes in front ofthe sttdio building- it seemed that thecount had detained him and told himsome absurd story about his havingkilled Caruthers That must have liecna dream and yet- great -God the chainsand the cell Could he be in a dunjreon for the murder of CaruthersGielow managed to rise to his feet andbegan to grope about him He touchedthe wall behind hhn It was unevenlike the inside of acavern He felt allround the room In size it was aboutten feet long by six in width One endwas of bricks and that end containedan iron door Gielows intelligence toldhim that he was not in prison but it furnished no hint of the truthThe hours passed Gielow went backto bis corner and down on the bedof straw His knees shook and he wasvery weak Then the pangs of hungerand thirst awoke in himA moment later he knew he was starvMaddened by this realization hecrawled to the door and beat upon itwith his handcuffs He made a thunderous noise but when the echoes haddied out the silence seemed even moreprofound more menacing than everAgain he beat upon the door till theirons cut into his wristsFinally he was rewarded by noting adancing pencil of light pierce the gloomthrough a crack over tthe door andthen he heard footsteps outside Abunch of heavy keys clanked one wasfitted into a rusty lock and the doorswung open In the light of a lanteruwhich he held appeared the crafty features and glistening eyeglasses ofCount Bantinni A sinister smile wason his sallow faceGielow shrank backward in bewildermentFor Gods sake tell me the meaningof this he criedIt means that youll never see thelight of day again said Bantinniharshly You had the cheek to tell mein my rooms that she loves -you Ahwe shall sec my young idiot she shalllove no one but me He member I havesaid itYou brought me here then exclaimed Gielow in wonderCertainly was the counts replyHe set his lantern down and leanedagainst the closed doorWhere am I in the name of mercygasped GielowYou will never know that answered the count with a satisfied smileWould you believe that you have beensleeping on that straw for three daysand three nightsThat may be slowly replied theartist for I am starvingAh yes it is time for you to feelthat way replied Bantinni It willbe hard from now on I could let yousleep your life away without a moments pain if I were to hypnotize youagain but I shall not waste the timeI was under your influence thenCompletelyAnd for what reasonThe count laughedI dont mind telling you my planIt will give you something to thinkabout in your solitude If you will reflect you will remember that Carutherswas the only barrier to any mans marrying Miss Huntington and getting thebenefit of her fortune Well Caruthersis non est he has been murdered Onthe night the crime was discovered youconfessed to you iervan in my presence that you had committed the deedthen you packed your bag and fledAbsurd said Gielow slowly histaring eyes fixed in horror on the faceof the ItalianYou remember nojthing about it foryou were hypnotized said the countbut if you will believe an eye witnessvou plaved the part most naturallyThe papers of New York have been fullof you for the past three daysThe count paused and fedsted on Gielows expressionWhat have you tjo say to that headded with a fiendish chuckleI simply dont believeit said theprisoner slowly Yon have cut me offfrom information and intend to torturemy mind with your Satanic inventionsOh thats iteh Well how do youlike the looks oi thatBantinni took from his pocket a fold-ed newspaper and opening it held the1 vL4Lwhere you areyour name at the topThe big black letters seemed tostamp themselves on the brain of theartist They drew him as it were byforce to a sitting posture then he covered his face with his hands and sankback on his pallet of strawBantinni drew nearer him and swunghis lantern over his face It was as ifhe feared his victim had succumbed tothe ordeal Seeing his fear ungrounded he laughed lightlyYou must not die too quickly hesaid it would not suit my purposeSince you have been here you have aided me vastly and I may need your assistance againGielow made no

blastedreputation the downfall of the namehe had been so proud to bear struckhim like a blow and he threw himselfback on the stone floor and weptAfter awhile a dull sound like -he faroff beat of horses hoofs and the hollowrumble of wheels was transmitted tohhn through the rock against which hishead rested lie found when he sat upthat the round was no longer audibleso he judged that there must be a pavedroad or street near if not beneath himTor hours he listened to these soundshis serse of hearing becoming so acutethat he could distinguish between thepassing of a two horse vehicle and

rocks of one of thewalls he discovered that they were moistand crawling to them he licked theirslimy surfaces with his parched tonguebut this only seemed to irritate histhhvst without giving relief so he threwhimself back on the straw and tried topractice what he had heard a mentalscientist say about the efficacy of ignoring the belief in hunger or thirst toescape suffering when deprived of foodor water But he failed in this and allowed visions of cool sparkling streamsin sunlit meadows to pass before hiseyei mind He never thought of Dorothy now except us seated with him at asumptuous tableOnce when he put his head in a newposition to avoid the piercing of thesharp pointed stones he felt a tinystream of fresh air shooting from thewall about a foot from the floor Examining the stone in that vicinity hefound a lon irregular crack throughwhich the air entered Then he beganto beat ihc stone w ith his handcuffs andnoticed when he struck it near thecrack that it gave forth the sound ofbroken rather than of solid stoneAgain and again he beat the rock untilhe felt more air coming in at th cleftend then his heart bounded with expoctation for he had loosened a pieceof the rock about a foot long by twoinches in width and when he hadtugged at it for several moments it fellto the floorThen joy untold a stream of daylight flashed into his face and for aninstant blinded him When his eveshad become accustomed to the unwonted brightness he saw that there was awidening crevice through the solid rockfrom the interior of the cell to the outside And through it about 50 feet beneath him he saw a paved roadwaybordered by trees and grassBut owing to the downward tendency of the fissure his range of visionwas limited In fact he could seeE3KKJ3SUbwwI w IliTJiirfifTpossible arid longing to catch

past butthe sound of their footsteps did not riseto his ears Carriages and vehicles ofseveral kinds went by but they glidedalong as noiseless as bicycles unlessGielow put his head against the

would only stop and look uphe might manage to signal to themA young man and a girl came intoview They were walking slowly handin hand and as if obeying Gielows desire telepathically they sat down on therustic seat The young man put hisarm around his companions waist theireyes met and their faces glowedGielow placed his lips to the crackand shouted but he had grown sohoarse that his voice did not passthrough the crevice in the rock Hetried again and again and at last gaveup in despairThen another thought entered hisbrain Feeling over the floor he finally found a pebble and tried to throwit through the Assure but this was alsoan impossibility The opening- was toolong and irregular for anything to bethrown through it and it sloped downward so gradually that the pebblewould not rollThen Gielow thought of somethingelse He took tiff oue of his whitelinen cuffs He coiled it tightly andtied it with a thread from the lining ofhis cravat He believed he would beable to push it through the

the first thing to be decidedfor on going through his pockets hecould find nothing but his penknifeBe believed he could if his hand werestrong enough cut the letters into thelinen but would they be

is reallyall that is required in order to markones linen simply and beautifully andto do these letters satisfactorily requirts hardly any practice The principal stitches employed are outline ofa very fine and even quality long andshort stitch buttonhole stitch Frenchknots satin stitch feather stitch andseed stitchTable linen looks best in pure whiteFor towels red white blue or a mixture of any two is suitable In household lettering the effect depends entirely upon the care with which thework is done Little details should beattended to No matter how thestitches may be worked if the letter

American AttractAfter the Victory of OurTroopThe first American amusement enterprise which invaded Porto Rico afterthe American troops landed saidRalph Pomeroy of the Columbia theater was a little Americo Japanese circus which stopped on its way homfrom a tour of South America and put upits little round topped tent just outsidethe city of Ponce It lasted one weekduring which time the tent was packedtwice a day with appreciative audiences but very little money came in atthe door Then it died a miserabledeath at the hands of a Spanish sheriffor some other kind of petty civil officeThe way of it was this The Secondiml Third Wisconsin regiments someIni ted States regular artillery batteries and Illinois volunteer engineerswere camped just outside of Ponceand justaoross the road from wherethe -tent was pitched The Japanesemanager of the show had expectedUiat the military would be his bestpaying patrons but the fact that noneof them had had any pay for aboutthree months completely upset hisplans The natives were awed thepresence of the troops and in no moodfor amusement of any kind and theresult was that very few gave up theircoin at the door The first day theshow opened the manager thought togain the go6d will of the soldiers byadmitting them all free as soon as theperformance began He thus established a precedent of which the soldiers took advantage at every performance They would stand aroundby companies until the wheezy handorgan announced that the performance had begun when thev advancedby rushes into the tent filling everyavailable inch but committing no violence and keeping the best of orderXo circus ever had a more appreciativeor demonstrative audience Every actof the Japanese jugglers Americansong and dance team and lady contortion ist was encored But not even inPorto Pico can a show live on applauseunaccompanied by coin and at the endof the week poor little Fukino the Japanese manager saw his tent and properties seized for debt and he and hisfive performers were compelled to apply to the military authorities fortransportation to America which theygot on one of the returning troopshipsThe soldier boys will always feel grateful however to
