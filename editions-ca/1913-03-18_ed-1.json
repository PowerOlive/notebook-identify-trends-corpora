Post
Counsel foivthe New York Journal
of Commerce at Washington Tuesday
applied lo the Supreme Court to re
strain Postmaster General Burleson
from immediately enforcing the
"newspaper publicity law," Former
Postmaster General Hitchcock had
agreed not to attempt to enforce the
law pending a orompt appeal to the
Supreme Court from ihe decision of
he Federal Courts in New York.
Rober G. Morris, counsel for the
Journal of Commerc in a statement to
the Supreme Court declired that on
March 4 the postmaster of New York
had notified the paper that unless the
statements required by the law were
filed at once, ne would proceed tc en
force its penalties. Similar letters,
the attorney charged, had been sent to
other newspapers throughout the coun
try. Since March 4, Attorney Morns
declared Postmaster General Burleson
had informed him formally that unless
the required returns were made on or
before March 11, he would enforce the
penalties which include disbarufent
from the maila.
The Supreme Court has had the va
lidity ot the law "under consideration
for several months, but has announced
no decision. The court took the mo
tion of 'Mr. Morris under advisement.

Mil waukee in which an express com-",
pany took advantae of the parcel post
to save itself trouble, and" collect a

The case has Been laid before the "
postal authorities.but it is not thought

The specific shipment was a box of
cigars from Detroit to Milwaukee, in
which a Detroit man, about to visit
here, decided to test out a suspicion''
that the express companies wereusing
the parcel post. He addressed the box
to a Milwaukee friend and paid forty
cents fcr the shipment. When he
reached here he found the package de
livered bv the parcel post bearing 22.
cents in postal stamps. The express
company had made ,18 cents on the
shipment.
