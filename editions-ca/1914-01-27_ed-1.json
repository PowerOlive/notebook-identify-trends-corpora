"Fatty Joins .the Force," (Keystone)
This is a roaring piece of comedy
which has a laugh in every flash.
There is not a very distinct story and
the film really has to be seen to be
appreciated. Suffice it to say tliat
Fatty joins the police jforce, goes in
swimming while on duty in the park
and plunges not only into the water,
but into a rather embarrassing batch
of circumstances. It is an extremely
good film for straight entertainment.
The Alamo Today.
"Caprice," with Mary Pickford, in
motion pictures. The Famous Play
ers Film Company presents the popu
lar play, "Caprice," with no less a star
in the leading role than Mary Pick
ford. This popular player and noted
play should prove a nappy combina
tion. Caparice" is a pleasant play
witness an amateur performance in
this city in many years.
The personnel was entirely home
talent, and the performers acquitted
themselves with marked credit, not
withstanding the short time devoted
to rehearsals. Mr. Willard Rummel,
the director, is deserving of all the
credit which resulted in such a de
cided success.
The end men were Harry Salqshm,
Dr. Harry Mathers, Anderson Cahal,
Dr. A. H. Keller, Harry Horton and
Pearce Paton, while Dr. W. C. TJssery,
an old-time theatrical man, presided
as interlocutor in his usual pleasing
manner. The jokes, many of them
being local, took the 'house by storm.
The headliner of the occasion was
Harry Saloshin, who for a good manv
years has figured prominently in
home talent performances. He had
a clever line of end-jokes, and his
monologue in the second part was one
of the principal features of the" per
formance. Brannon and Wollsteln
were clever in a black-face sketch en
titled "The Fast Mail Train." The
musical numbers -were all well ren
dered and a large chorusof thirty
voices added much to the musical end
of the program.
Pickford is as ideal in the part of
"Mercy" as the play is suited to her
self. The motion picture production
abounds in many landscape and
country scenes, and flashes from
these to elaborate mansions, impos
ing drawing rooms from the freedom
of God's country to the yellow glare
of city lights. In a word it may be
-sumtned up as an echo of the hills
mingled with the voice of the city.
A categorical review of all the mer-
ritorious details that enter into and
comprise the production are not ne
cessary, when it is remembered that
the producers, the Famous Players
Film Company, are establishing new
standards in picture-making, and ele
vating the film toa higher plane than
has heretofore been contemplated.
