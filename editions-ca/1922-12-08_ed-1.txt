Bacon, located atNorth Middletown, this county, wastotally destroyed by fire about 2:30o'clock, Wednesday morning, together with the larger portion of its'contents. The fire is supposed tohave originated from a defectiveflue.The blaze was discovered by Mrs.Bacon after it had broken out infront of the open fireplace in her"bedroom. She and her two littlesons made their escape in only theirnightclothes. The Paris fire department was called, but was unable to be of much service on account of the advanced stage of thefire and the lack of a good watersupply.The home was one of the handsomest in that section of the couney and contained a large collectionof relics and antique furniturewhich had been collected byMrs. Bacon in her travels inthis country and abroad. Most ofthem were destroyed, as was all ofher silver. The loss was estimated at approximately $18,000, withinsurance of about $9,000.Mrs. Bacon has for severalmonths been occupying the furnished home of her brother.

(5-2t)NEW AUTO TAGS HEREOne of the leading business menof Paris, one who keeps his earsclose to the business world at alltimes, and who knows just abouteverything worth while that it going on in business circles in Paris,was in THE NEWS office the otherday. From a business standpointhe was all smiles and in a splendidgood humor.Asked what had happened he replied that he was all- gjDod natureover the excellent business prospects for Christmas trade, and thatthere would be more money turnedloose in Paris and Bourbon county,and for that matter, in Central Kentucky, within the next ninety days,than the people had seen for a longtime. "Times are going to be good,and you will see a better feeling inParis than we have enjoyed formany months. There is no roomhere now for croakers, and thosewho are so inclined, will have togo to themselves and do theircroaking. Paris is in for a seasonof prosperity, and there is nothingm the immediate' future to stop it."The State Tax Commission showed rare good taste in selection ofcolors for the 1923 ' automobilelicense tags, according to CountyClerk Pearce Paton, who stated thatthe new tags will soon be ready fordistribution to automobile owners.The new tags have- deep bluenumerals on a battleship grey background, and "it is the unanimousopinion that they are works of art.While the passenger car license willgo on sale at once, auto ownerswill not be allowed to display thenew tags until after December 29.oHONOR ROLL OF COUNTYSCHOOLSTHE MEANEST THIEFInterurban Agent George M.Davis has a grievance.

The beautiful old custom that had once beenuniversal in England had all butdied.The widespread adoption of theCommunity Christmas Tree didmuch to bring thQ carols to publicattention again. Yet the singingof the charming old Yuletide songsfor the public benefit was all tooinfrequent and the general absenceof the "waits," the traveling bandsof carolers, in their picturesque redcambric capes, was particularly regrettable. The National Bureau for the Advancement of Music is interested inextending more widely the influence and utilization of music amongthe American people, and it was inthe Christmas caroling one of themost inspiring uses of song, as asatisfaction to the singer, a joy tothe community, and a means of expressing the Christmas spirit. In1917, therefore, shortly after itsown inception, the Bureau beganworking actively for the countrywide expansion of the custom. Itpointed as a model to the splendidorganization for Christmas singingthat had been worked out on acity-wide scale in Detroit. As afurther aid to the movement theBureau issued its booklet, "Christmas Eve Caroling Being Revived,"giving a brief outline of the historyof the custom and instructions forprocedure to those interested incarrying out the plan locally.By this time the movement hadmade considerable advance, and inthe first edition of the booklet, ayear after efforts were made to revive the movement, it was possibleto list 30 important cities in whichthe outdoor caroling had been introduced. There were undoubtedlymore than this number, but theBureau had not full facilities fortracing them. By the time the second edition was published, in October, 1920, a verified list of nearly100 was included.This success, however, led onlyto the redoubling of effort, withthe result that in December, 1920,there was evidence that the caroling had actually been establishedin 330 cities. By December, 1921,the number has risen to 661. (Thisdoes not include about 150 listed in1920, but of which no report wasreceived of caroling in 1921, although most of them undoubtedlyobserved the custom.) Some of thecities were large, others small.Some had caroling groups enough tocover the entire area, others forbut one or two districts; while instill others carols were sung aroundthe community Christmas tree only.The information was gathered fromnewspaper clippings from all partsof the country, and it is probablethat many cities were overlooked.No places were included where thecaroling was simply an indoor orchurch event.J. M. Allison, New York correspondent of the Cincinnati TimesStar, in his "New York Day byDay" column had the following tosay of Edward F. Simms, who isnow spending several days at "Xalapa Farm," his estate near Paris:"Maybe you don't know EdwardF. Simms, who is an oil magnate inTexas, a sportsman in Kentucky, amillionaire sportsman in Saratogaand a specialist in New York. Ifyou don't, you have missed him inhis best role as a philosopher inthe abstract. That requires thatyou shall hear him talk." 'They say that we didn't learnanything from this war,' he said recently. 'Let me show you what welearned. One-half of the men whowere drafted for our army were subnormal, physically. A majority wereilliterate. One-third of those whoclaimed to be skilled mechanics'could be rated as journeymen. Thegovernment found it necessary totrain a million and a quarter menfor simple technical work. Wefound all of that out from this war,and if we can correct it now, thewar was worth while.' "What has become of the old fashioned tad who used to whistle"White Wings Never Grow Weary"?(Carlisle Mercury)Q. T. Gatewood has on display athis confectionery a Brazil nut shellcontaining a number of nuts. Itcame in a shipment of nuts to hisstore. The cluster of nuts grow inside a hard, round shell, which resembles a cocanut shell. It is aboutten inches in diameter and aboutfifteen nuts seem to cluster closelyaround a stem inside that resemblesone of the nuts.AN APPROPRIATE CHRISTMASGIFTWhen making up your list ofChristmas gifts, don't forget a year'ssubscription to THE BOURBONNEWS.
