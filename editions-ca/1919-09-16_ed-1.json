covered by two colored women, the
roof of the residence was in flames.
,Th.e fajmily were not aroused, until
after this. The voluntary fire de
partment was called out and did he
roic work. In a little while both en
gines were on the scene, and the
fire was under control. However,
this was not until after the inter
ior of the building had been well
destroyed, by fire and ruined by wa
ter. The origin of the fire is un
known. When first discovered it was
in the front of the building, near the
' roof. It is thought by many to be
fee -work of either birds or mice, in
depositing matches, where they af
terward ignited. Mr. Bramblette car
ried $3, 000. insurance on the prop
erty. The walls are in good condi
tion, and the work of rebuilding will

From a sick woman who can never
recover fropn tuberculosis has come
a cash contribution to the Baptist
75 Million Campaign as reported by
the general headquarters in Nash
ville. "I have tuberculosis and do not ex
pect to live long," she writes "but
my husband, whose income is but
$1,000 a year, and I make a practice
of tithing and greatly rejoice in giv
ing the Lord at least one tenth. And
I want before I die to have a share
in the great 75 Million Campaign.
As long as I live I am going to send
in a part of my half of our salary to
this purpose. The greatest joy I have
is in deciding where I can place this
money to do the most good in my
Savior's cause."

EXHTRIT WAS POPULAR.
The big display made by the Col

better in every way than the one of
last season. It also had more direct
appeal to the public, as was shown
by the interested people who visited
'and revisited the exhibit. It is evi
dent that the public may expect a
finer exhibit from season to season
from these two most popular State
Institutions.

ATTENTION, MR. FARMER!

Mr. Farmer:
We are taking this means to advise you that you still have an opportunity of purchasing
your manure at the old price. All orders received at this office for immediate shipment up
until September 30 th will be accepted at $2.50 per ton price f. o. b. Louisville.
Commencing October 1st we are forced to advance our prices to $3.00 per ton for ship
ment during October and November, and on December 1st to 3.50 per ton. We are so situ
ated that we are not in a position to figure on any more manure for shipment any later than
December and for this reason we are not quoting any price for later shipment than De
cember. Conditions are such now as to make it almost.imperative for the wise farmer to purchase
his requirements immediately to insure himself of his supply. The Government is f astly
disposing of their animals and this naturally means a loss of manure, as if the animals are
not there, naturally, we cannot get the manure.
Another very important feature is the fact that we are encountering severe difficulty
in securing empty cars for loading. This is due to the shortage of coal cars. It is reasona
ble to assume that with a shortage of coal cars at this season of the year, that with the
approach of Fall and Winter this shortage will become more acute, and for this reason we
advise our customers and friends to not delay the purchase of their manure any longer.
We are now receiving the highest grade of manure we ever have had since we had this
contract, and the Government is exercising particular care in picking out this manure, so
that there is virtually no dirt in same whatsoever.
We will be glad, indeed to take any customer out to the Remount who will have occa
sion to come to Louisville and let him examine this manure before making shipment to him.
We also wish to call your attention to the straw manure that we are shipping from
Camp Knox, Stithton, Kentucky. This manure is nowJbecoming very much in demand by
the gardeners, who utilize it for hot beds, and we have virtually sold up all our straw ma
nure for the next five or six months. However, we still have a few open dates in the bal
ance of this month and next month, which will enable us to accept business at $35.00 per
car f. o. b. Stithton. This manure contains approximately 20 to 25 straw in volume and
is absolutely free from foreign matter.
In conclusion, we wish to state that we haye been very fortunate in having extremely
good weather, which has enabled the Government to work their corrals very carefully, and
in this manner they are getting out a very high grade of manure, perfectly dry, which
means that you are not paying one penny for any excessive moisture.
At the Christian church Sunday,
the sum of $9,000 was raised in
money and pledges for th epurpose
of paying for the new organ, de
fraying the cost of the new concrete
paving and for the new interior dec
orating recently cqmpleted. It is
confidently expected that the entire
sum of $12,000 will be raised by the
middle of the week.

It has just about gotten so in this
country it doesn't pay to sit up with
a sick friend unless he has medicine
in his cellar.
In certain sections of Kentucky
the farmer is able to buy ground
limestone even in ton lots at excep
tionally low figures. (This is made
possible by wide-awake bankers who
are buying limestone in carload
lots so that the farmer may have it
at the lowest possible price. Wher
ever bankers are pursuing this plan
the farmers are certain to learn very
rapidly the tremendous value of
ground limestone even on their most
fertile fields.

Mobilization of the forces of edu
cation at Camp Paris High School in
this city has practically been com
pleted. The result is a fine body of
young soldiers in the interest of bet
ter education, answering to the roll
call to the number of 1,200 in the
twelve grades of the school. This is
said to be the largest attendance
ever recorded at the opening day for
the High School.
The High School alone reports a
total of 200 students. This gives
that department the largest number
it has ever enrolled, and it is confi
dently expected in a few days this
number will be largely increased by
the addition of new pupils. Only
one addition has' been made to
the faculty, that being Miss Kather
ine Evans, a graduate -of Bryn Mawr
College, in Pennsylvania, who will
have charge of the physical culture
courses. Football practice has been
smarted, the coaching being under
the instruction of the Y.. M. C. A.
instructors. Robert Burnett, a for
mer High School star, has received
his discharge frcpn the service, and
will rejoin his former teammates on
the football gridiron.
