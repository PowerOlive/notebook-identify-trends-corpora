SoonCleveland O Jan 11 Maj McKinley attended church Sunday morningand later enjoyed a long drive Hewill leave for Canton Monday morningat 11 oclock and expects to remainthere till the first day of MarchMaj McKinley said to a friend Sunday that this week would be an important one in organizing his cabinet and administration The formation of the cabinet hinges upon thesalient and pivotal positions of secretary of state and secretary of thetreasury It is quite probable thatboth of these important cabinet portfolios will be tendered and acceptedby the end of the week Senator Sherman has had some communication withMaj McKinley and he will go to Canton whenever the president elect desires him to and his visit will according to present arrangements here bemade about the middle of the weoicIt is now pretty well establishedthat Maj McKinley wants SenatorSherman to be secretary of state butit is by no means certain that Mr Sherman has made up his mind to accept acabinet appointment His inclinationis to remain in the senate where thework is systematized and familiar andwhere he can regulate the amount andquality of it to a very considerableextent He feels no strong desiresaid one of his friends of long standingSunday to undertake the severe andexacting task of the most importantand difficult governmental departmentbut on the other hand he has had longexperience as chairman of the committee on foreign relations and many ofhis most valued friends are earnestlyurging him to close his notable publiccareer by a brilliant administration ofthe department of stateThe natural and timely desire of MA Hanna to go to the senate may havemuch to do with Mr Shermans appointment to the cabinet if he acceptsa portfolio Mr Hanna has been oneof Mr Shermans most valuablefriends He had done a great deal forhim in a political way and Mr Sherman doubtless feels that he owes hislast election to the senate in part tothe zeal and support of Mr HannaTheir relations have been friendlyand close for years If Mr Sherman does not accept the offer of acabinet position the way to the senatewill remain closed to Mr Hanna forhe would not contest the seat with hispersonal and political friend of longstanding It is rumored that Senatorelect Joseph B Foraker of Cincinnatiwill be invited to visit Canton whileMr Sherman is there Upon the action of Mr Foraker and his friendsthe senatorial aspirations of ChairmanM A Hanna dependof Ohio will appoint Mr Shermans successor for theterm of two years if hegoes into the cabinet He is a devotedfriend and allay of Senator elect For-bing each other until a constable and akers and it may be thatit is fearedI that he would not appoint Mr Hannato the vacancy for the reason thatthey belong to opposite factions of theparty and have been at odds in a political way only for several years Theimpression prevails among many of thepoliticians that while Messrs Forakerand Bushneil are thoroughly friendlyto Maj McKinley and desire tosupport him loyally and efficiently they do not wish to buildcabinet portfolios a seat in the UnitedStates senate and the iuture status ofMark Hanna in national politicsOne week ago Sunday Senator Cullorn of

complexion as if a sunbeam hadcrept into the room and its reflectionhad litnp her faceI have come to apologize Mr Wentworth she said at last I find -it avery difficult thing to do and as I dontknow just how to begin Ill plungeright into itYou dont need to apologize to mefor anything Miss Brewster repliedWentworth rather stifflvOh yes I do Dont make it harderthan it is by being too frigidly politerbout it but say you accept theapology and that youre sorry no Tdont mean that I should say that1 youre sure Im sorry and that youknow I wont do it againWentworth laughed and MissBrewster joined himThere she said thats ever somuch better I suppose youve been- thinking hard things of me ever sincewe last metIve tried to replied WentworthNow thats what I call honest besides I like the implied compliment Jthink its very neat indeed Im reallyvery very sorry that I that thingshappened as they did I wouldnt haveblamed you if you had used exceedingly strong language about it at thetimeI must confess that I didAh said Jennie with a sigh youmen have so many comforts denied tous women But I came here for another purpose if I had merely wantedto apologize I think I would have written I want some information whichyou can give me if you likeThe young woman rested her elbowson the table with her chin in- herhands gazing across at him earnestlyand innocently Poor George felt thatit would be impossible to refuse anything of those large beseeching eyes- I want you to tell me about yourmineAll the geniality that had graduallycome into Wentworths face and manner vanished instantlySo this is the old business ovsragain he saidHow can you say that criedJennie reproachfully I am askingfor my own satisfaction entirely andnot for my paper Besides I tell youfrankly what 1 want to know anddont try to get it by indirect meansby false pretenses as jou once saidHow can you expect me to give youinformation that does not belong tome alone I have no right to speak ofa business which concerns others without their permissionAh then there are at least two othersconcerned in the mine said Jenniegleefully Kenyon is one I knowwho is the otherMiss Brewster I will tell you nothingBut you have told me something already Please go on and talk MrWentworth about anything you likeand I shall soon find out all I want toknow about the mineShe paused but Wentworth remained silent which indeed the bewildered young man realized was theonly safe thing to doThey speak of the talkativeness ofwomen Miss Brewster went on as ifsoliloquizing but it is nothing to thatof the men Once set a man talkingand you learn everything he knowsbesides ever so much more that hedoesntMiss Brewster had abandoned hervery talkative attitude with its suggestion of confidential relations andhad removed her elbows from the table sitting now back in her chair gazing dreamily at the dingy windowwhich let the light in from the dingycourt She seemed to have forgottenthat Wentworth was there and saidmore to herself than to himI wonder if Kenyon would tell meabout the mineYou might ask himNo it wouldnt do any good shecontinued gently shaking her headHes one of j our silent men and thereare so few of them in this world Perhaps I had better go to William Longworth himself he is not suspicious ofmeAnd as shf said this she threw aquick glance at Wentworth and theunfortunate young mans face at oncetold -her that she had hit the markShe bent her brow oyer the table and- laufrhed with such evident enjoymentthat Wentworth in spite of his helpless anger smiled grimlyJennie raised her head but the sightof his perplexed countenance was toomueh for her and it was some time before her merriment allowed her tospeak At last she saidWouldnt you like to take me by theshoulders and put me out of the roomMr WentworthId like to take youby the shouldersand shake youAh that would be takrmg a libertyand could not be permitted We mustleave punishment to the law you knowalthough I do think a man should beallowed to turn an objectionable visitor into the streetMiss Brewster cried the youngman earnestly leaning over the tabletoward her why dont you abandonyour horrible inquisitorial professionand put your undoubted talents tosome other useWhat for instanceOh anythingJennie rested her fair heek againsther open palm again and looked at thedingy window There was a long silence between them Wentworth wasabsorbed in watching her clear cut profile and her white throat his breathquickening as he feasted his eyes onher beautyI have always got angry she saidat last in a low voice with the quiverof a suppressed sigh in it when otherpeople have said that to me I wonderwhy it is I merely feel hurt and sadvhen you say it It is so easy to sayoh anything so easy so easy Youare a man with the strength and determination of a man yet you havemet with disappointments and obstacles that have required all your courage to overcome Every man has andwith most men it is a fight until thehead is gray and the brain weary withthe ceaseless struggle The Avorld isutterly merciless it will trample youdown relentlessly if it can and if yourvigilance relaxes for a moment it willsteal your crust and leave you to starveWhen I think of this incessant sullencontest with no quarter given or takenL shudder and pray that I may die before I am at the mercy of the pitilessworld When I came to London I sawfor the first time in my life that hopeless melancholy promenade of thesandwich men human wreckage drifting along the edge of the street asif they had been cast up there by therushing tide sweeping past themLjllPI -want you to tell mo something -about yourmineThey they seemed to me like a tottering procession of the dead and ontheir backs was the announcement ofa play that was making all Londonroar with laughter the awful comedyand of it Well I simplycouldnt stand it I had to run up aside street and cry like the little foolI was right in broad daylightJennie paused and tried to laugh butthe effort ended in a sound suspiciouslylike a sob and she dashed her handwith quick impatience a6ross hereyes from which Wentworth had nevertaken his own watching them dim asthe light from the window poved toostrong for them and finally fill as sheceased to speak Searching ineffectually about her dress for a handkerchiefwhich lay on the table beside her parasol unnoticed by either Jennie wenton with some difficultyWell these poor forlorn creatureswere once men men who had gonedown and if the world is so hard ona man with all his strength and resourcefulness think think what it isfor a woman to be thrown into thisinbuman human turmoil a womanwithout friends - without moneyflung among these relentless wolvesto live if she can or to die if shecanThe girls voice broke and she buriedher face in her

I came here totalk business not to make a fool ofmyself Its all jrour fault and I hateyou for it you and your silly questionsBut the joung man stood where hewas in spite of the dangerous sparklethat lit up his visitors wet eyes Afrown gathered on his browJennie- he said slowly are youjlaymg with me againThe swift anger that blazed up in herface reddening her cheeks dried thetearsHow dare you say such a thing tome she cried hotly Do you flatteryourself that because I came here totalk business I have also some personalinterest in you Surely even your selfconceit doesnt run so far as

TUESDAY JANUARY 12 1897she was disappointed for altbougjfc Jhis eyes were upon her his thoughtswere far away upon the Atlantic oceanI shall not stay here to be insultedshe cried resentfully bringing Wentworths thoughts back with a rush toLondon again It is intolerable thatyou should use such an expression tome Playing with you indeedI had no intention of insulting youMiss BrewsterWhat is it but an insult to use sucha phrase It implies thut I eithercare for you orAnd do youDo I whatDo you care for meJennie shook out the lace fringes ofher parasol and smoothed them withsome precision Her eyes were benton what she was doing and consequently they did not meet those of her questionerI care for you as a friend of courseshe said at last still giving much attention to the parasol If I had notlooked on you as a friend I would nothave come here to consult with youwould IXo I suppose not Well I am sorryI used the words that displeased youand now if you will permit it we willgo on with the consultationIt wasnt a pretty thing to sayIm afraid Im not good at sayingpretty thingsYou used to be The parasol being arranged to her liking she glancedup at him Still you said you weresorry and thats all a man can say or awoman either for thats what I saidmyself when I came in Now if youwill pick up those things from thefloor thanks we will talk about themineWentworth seated himself in hibchair again and saidWell what isot you wish to knowabout the mineNothing at allBut you said you wanted informationWhat a funny reason to give Andhow a man misses all the fine pointsof a conversation No just because Iasked for information you might haveknown that it was what I really wantedIm afraid Im very stupid I hateto ask boldly what you did want but1 would like to knowI want a vote of confidence I toldyou I was sorry because of a certainepisode I wanted to see if you trusted me and I found you didnt ThereI think that was hardly a fair testYou see the facts did not belong to mealoneMiss Brewster sighed and slowlyshook her headThat wouldnt have made the leastdifference if you had really trusted meOh I say You couldnt expect aman toYes I couldWhat merely a friendMiss Brewster noddedWell all I can say remarked Wentworth with a laugh is that friendship has made greater strides in thestates than it has in this countryBefore Jennie could reply the usefulboy knocked at the door and brought ina tea tray which he placed before hismaster then silently departed closingthe door noiselesslyMay I offer you a cup of teaPlease What a curious custom thisdrinking of tea is in business officesI think I shall write an article on ANation of Tea Tipplers If I were anenemy to England instead of being itsgreatest friend 1 would descend withmy army on this country between thehours of four and five in the afternoonand so take the population unawareswhile it was drinking tea What wouldyou do if the enemy came down on youduring such a sacred national ceremonyI would offer her a cup of tea replied Wentworth suiting the action tothe phraseMr Wentworth said the girl archly-yure improving That remarkwas distinctly good Still j ou mustremember that 1 come as a friend notas an enemy Did you ever read theBabes in the Wood It is a most instructive but pathetic work of fictionYou remember the wicked uncle surely Well you and Mr Kenyon remindme of tl2 babes poor innocent littlethings and London this part of itis the dark and pathless forest I amthe bird hovering about you waiting tocover 3rou with leaves The leaves todo any good ought to be checks fluttering down on you but alas I haventany If negotiable checks only grewon trees life would not be so difficultMiss Brewster sipped her tea pensively and Wentworth listened to themusical murmur of her voice whichhad such an entrancing effect on himthat he paid less heed to what she sa Jthan a man should when a lady is speaking The tea drinking had added atouch of domesticity to thethat rather went to the head of theyoung man He clinched and unclinched his hand out of sight underthe table and felt the moisture on hispalm He hoped he would be able toretain control over himself but thedifficulty of his task almost overcomehim when she now and then appealedto him with glance or gesture and liefelt as if he must cry out My girl mvgirl dont do that if you expect me tostav where I amI see you are not paying the slightest attention to what I am saying shesaid pushing the cup from her Sherested her arms on the table leaningslightly forward and turning her facefull upon him I can tell by youreyes that you are thinking of something elseI assure you said George drawinga deep breath I am listening with intense interestWell thats right for what I amgoing to say is important Now fwake you up I will first tell you allabout 3 our mine so that you will understand I did not need to ask anyone forinformation regarding itHere to Wentworths astonishment-I she gave arapid and accurate sketch ofthe rgptiativMis and arrangemertsivtween the ihree partners anlth present position of affairsHow do you know all this beaskedNever mind that and -you mustntask how I know what I am now goingto tell you but you must believe it implicitly and act upon it promptlyLongworth is fooling both you andKenyon He is making time so thatyour option will run out then he willpay cash for the mine at the originalprice and you and Kenyon will be leftto pay two thirds of the debt incurredWhere is KenyonHe has gone to AmericaThats good Cable him to get theoption renewed You can then try oform the company yourselves in London If he cant obtain a renewal yuhave very little time to get the cash together and if you are not able to dthat then you lose everything Thisis what I came to tell you althoughhave been a long time about it Now 1must goShe rose gathered her belongingsfrom the table and stood with the parasol pressed against her Wentworthcame around to where she was standing his face paler than usual probablybecause of the news he had heard Onohand was grasped tightly around onewrist in front of him He felt that Ikshould thank her for what she haddone but his lips were dry and somehow the proper words were not at hi-commandShe holding her fragile lace fringedparasol against her with one arm wasadjusting her long neatly fitting glovewhich she had removed before tea Abutton one of many was difficult tofasten and as she endeavored to put i fin its place her sleeve fell away showing a round white arm above the gloveYou see she said a little breathlessly her eyes upon her glove it is avery serious situation and time is ofgreat importanceI realize thatIt would be such a pity to loseeverything now when you have had somuch trouble and worryIt wouldAnd I think that whatever is doneshould be done quickly You shouldact at once and with energyI am convinced that is so- Of course it is You are of too trusting a nature you should be more suspicious then you wouldnt be trickedas

Tedcrof t function when twogirls rushed into the station They hadJost time to hurry into the first carriage at hand and havevtheir bags andrags bundled in after them when thewhistle sounded and the train startedHow I hate a rush exclaimed Angela Trevor the elder of the two sisters a handsome resolute looking girls she sank breathless into her placeIt is so upsetting to ones nervesDisarranges ones clothes too added2vIollyTo think of our not having had timeto select a carriage for such along journey said AngelaBoth glanced involuntarily to the otherend of the carriage where their onebellow traveler sat in the corner seaton the same side with Angela HipSicad and face were hidden from viewby the ample pages of the Times spreadout before him Two long tweed cladlegs were stretched out finished withCattish feet in well finished boots AtiLhe side glimpses showed of a shoulderzm arm and a thirr nervous lookingStandHe looks all right Molly said careilessly thrusting a hairpin into her back2b airUndeniably a gentleman said Angela with deciskra He has a goodtailor and his boots are unexceptionalThe girls settled down for the journeyextracting from among the surroundingimpedimenta the usual literary solacesla the way of newspapers and vividlySfcound books First however theytalked over in low tones the visit onwhieh they were going in YorkshireTheir hostess was a friend and contemporary who had lately married thesquire of Mapledene The girls werefwll of excitement surmise and pleasantanticipations regarding the visit totheir friend in her new place and position It was some time before the flowrof conversation ceased and they tookap their books Angela was soon en-gaged in following the unwholesomecareer of a modern heroine through alllis risky intricacies Mollie had chancedoa a volume of short stories plainly inrspired by the triumphs of SherlockHolmes They werejfull of ghastly adventures with criminals and lunaticsthe situations though infinite in variety were all alike thrilling and bloodcurdling Mollies youthful imaginaition took fire one story an adventurewith a lunatic in arailway carriage especially excited her It was not a particularly happy selection for a railwayjourney She looked up from the pageswith a shudder her blood running coldIt was only in books however thatawful creepy adventures happened totravelers She had never known a realperson who was unlucky enough tomeet a criminal or lunatic in a trainJLs the reassuring thought entered hermind her eyes wandered to the far endof the carriage Theyunexpectedly metitlaose of the man in the corner seatthe shock was sharp and violent Hewas sitting up theTimes folded on hisknees allowing- his whole face to beseen Such a face Just like so manyzl those described in the stories MollieBad been reading The -coincidence wasextraordinary and startling The girlsimagination rushed off on a series ofwild flights and she drew quickly backcowering behind her book She hadaever seen a stranger looking manhollow cheeked gaunt grim but aboveall with the most peculiar eyes staring and prominent Sheiiad so little exacted such a development in the harmless-looking-nianbehind the Times thatthe shock and surprise were very greatShe retained however self controlenough not to appeal to Angela on theImpulse of the moment Mollie wasased to having fears ridiculed Shefekerefore decided to wait before giving any alarm for it was possible thatEter excited imagination was runningsway with herASter a few minutes she ventured toigeep cautiously from behind her bookThe man had turned away and waslooking out of the window the gauntikce only showing in profile Molliebreathed more fi3eely relieved fromghestareof those terrible eyes she madea quick close study of the stranger Asthe scrutiny progressed however ancther change came over her face thecomposure she had regained began toffiSIminish rapidly Her eyes noted theElians bare head then went from it toike rack above to the seat opposite tothe floor No trace of hat or hat boxof bags rugs dr luggage of any kindcould she discover Her heart stoodstill Who but an escaped lunatic or-criminal would be traveling hatless andwithout baggage The ghastly ideas-vague before now took terrible and definite shape She Den quicKiy aauand touched the unconscious Angelawhom the doubtful heroines adventures still held wholly absorbed-Take care Mollie whisperedDont start and look around I want0 tell you somethingGood gracious What has happenedArc you illAngela so suddenly aroused fromher reading found it hard not to exclaim aloud at her sisters words andthe sight of her pale face4No no I am all right Only its-a reat deal worse Its about the maninthe carriage Mollies voice sank tothe lowest whisperWhat do you mean Has he beendoing anythingXo but he is dreadful looking suchstrange face and staring eyes lieescaped criminal or a lunaroust be anrr V lunatic I think he looks soOh its dreadfulqw at such awfulWhy shoutf yru rnrnvusiok cXi bstulaicJi vmerely because a man is queer-look- JingBut its not only that Oh I wishit was Mollies teeth chattered withfrightWhat else What is it For heavens sake speak plainlyHe is traveling without a hat hishead is bare Mollie gasped out instrangled whispers And he has nohat in the carriage no luggage of anykind eitherGood gracious Are you quitesureQuite He has nothing with him butthe Times Would any ordinary mantravel like thatAngelas face bleached to the colorof her sisters her fears started intojust as acute life No ordinary manwould travel bareheaded There wasan awful probability about the conclusions drawn by Mollie from his hatless conditionOh she gasped under her breathIt is awful And to think that werenearly half an hour from the next stationA movement at the other end of thecarriage made bothgirls sink back intheir places with beating hearts AsAngela sank against the cushions shecaught a sudden and unexpectedglimpse of the suspected stranger Hehad turned again from the window andwas reopening the Times Alas Molliehad not exaggerated as fear sometimesmade her prone to do The mans facewas dreadful in its gaunt grimnessAnd then the staring eyes and bareheadAngela could not but accept the situation as the more suspicious and timidMollie had accepted it There was something wrong with the man he had allthe appearance of being a lunatic Awful though the thought might be thatthey were alone in the carriage with amadman it had to be faced Angelaless helpless than Mollie rapidly began to consider what could be doneThe train was not due to stop for atleast 20 minutes longer Would thequiet phase in which the man evidentlythen was last during that time a terrible and vital question And if it didnot Angela clenched her hands in theagony of the thought and thrust itfrom her resolutely Better not tothink of the worst not to anticipate asituation which would find them helpless The thing was to stave off dangerto do all that they could to preservethe mans present state of calmAngela made a rapid mental reviewof all her knowledge principal gathered from sensational literature concerning the insane As a result sheconcluded that what they had to donow was to avoid everything whichcould attract the mans notice or excite him in any way They must not forthe world let him see them looking athim nor rouse any suspicions in hismind that they were talking or thinking of him The difficulty was to communicate these decisions to Mollie without exciting suspicionAngela first ventured a swift glancefrom behind her book to the other endof the carriage The man was againconcealed by the newspaper the peaceful ordinary way in which his longlegs were stretched across the carriagewould have been more reassuring wereit not for the top of the bare head thatshowed above He was quiet howeverA gleam of hope kept up Angelas spiritThat calm state if undisturbed mightvery well last until their arrival at thenext stationShe snatched the opportunity to stoopover and communicate with the trembling Mollie It was difficult to restoreher to the appearance of a moral stateto prevent her little gasps becomingaudibleTry not to look so frightened forheavens sake Mollie Angela softlywhispered Quiet and calm are ourbest chance Dont give way like thatit may not be so bad after all If we donothing to attract his attention he willnot notice us They often do not Terhaps he will fall asleep he must bedrowsy going over that paper so oftenA smothered Oh answered Angelas well meant attempt to reassureher sisterHes not a bit drowsy she gaspedIve just caught his eye over the newspaper And and he looked as if hewas going to talk Oh what arewe to do Oh AngelaAngela had turned deadly pale buther presence of mind did not desertherLet us pretend to be admiring theview she whispered How lovely thelight on those fields is she said in alouder tone turning to the windowDo look MollieHe might spring on usLook Angela severely interruptedthe faltering whisper at that effectOut of the Window beside you a little tothe right the shadows on the treesYes yes I seeGo on looking and talking aboutwhat you see admonished Angela inundertones and when you can thinkof nothing more to say we will go onto the weather and to Yorkshire andthe hours of arrival at the stationsShe gave the lead taking up the prescribed topics in a quiet level tone theleast calculated to arouse interest andattention Her ears all the timewere fairly alert listening for theslightest sound from the other end othe carriage The chief burden of theconversation rested on her for Molliespart in it even with the most heroic efforts was very weak and disjointedSometimes it broke off altogether whena rustle or movement in the fair cornermade her teeth chatter and all powerof speech fail Though the strongerminded Angelas heart beat just asquickly at these awful moments shealways rose to the emergency and keptup the discourse with unvarying calmnessTo those stretched in agony upon arack minutes are as hours jever hadthe sisters dreamed that 20 minutescould be drawn out to such dreadfullength Ten times 20 seemed to have- i t- -- -J-passed when at last the engine beganto whistle and the train to slackenspeed before pulling up in the stationOn the instant the stop was made theman sprang from the carriage and disappeared in the crowd on the platformIt was hard for the girls to realize atonce that the danger was over the reaction after the great strain had such abewildering effectAngela found her voice firstOh she drew a deep breathwhat an escape we have had He isstark staring madTo think of his rushing off likethattic was attending to Angelas wordsTo have his mind well fixed on Darlingham was the best way of keeping deadly thoughts out of it 4

gravel or crushed stone can beobtained with which to make a roadbed unaffected by rains and standingwater In many sections of the country gravel can be had by hauling itfrom creek and river beds and where itcan be so obtained or purchased at alow figure the best possible use of timeand money is in securing and spreading this upon a read bed previouslygraded into the proper form If thegravel is dumped upon a perfectly flatsurface it becomes mixed with the soilduring wet weather and soon is lostThe first thing to be done is to gradethe road The graveling or macadamizing can then be done at

By No Means as Nnmeross sTliey Should BeAlmost anybody can milk after afashion but really good milkers are notas plenty as they might be A goodmilker is patient and gentle of touchnot only incapable of lifting a milkingstool at a cow but wise enough andthoughtful enough never to show anirritability or harshness of manner thatmight excite or disturb a nervous animal Milking should be dope as

cows aremuch less valauble than their yield ortest would at first blush seem to indicate They require more time Oncein awhile this might be endured butwhen the milking is a test that recursregularly twice a day for 300 days in theyear it becomes an important itemIt is hard to milk with the rapiditythat good milking requires and it isdifficult too to milk as clean as themaintenance of the milk flow requiresand hard milkers are much more liableother things being equal to fall oft inmilk flow and dry off early They become nervous too as a rule and veryfrequently develop into kickers Theyare not perhaps to blame for this Themilking disturbs them and makes themirritable and they naturally come to resent anything that irritates them Theiiirritation reacts too upon the personwho does the milking and he in turnis liable to be less valuable as a milkerbecause less patient and gentle Goodmilking bears so important a relation tothe best results which constitute profitas compared with results not quite sogood that it is a faculty which everyonewho has to handle cows should cultivateThere is more in the cheerful goodhumored picturesque milkmaid ideathan mere poetry The cheerful

would equal and in many cases exceed that of the ordinary quarter section inthe north People of all trades and professions in the north were attracted towardsouth Texas by the successful result of

told their mute story of destitutionThe pathetic eagerness with whichthe three emaciated occupants of theroom turned their glances upon the visitors touched a long dormant chord ofthe rich mans heart He involuntarilythrust his fingers into his vest pocketbut his companion laying a restraininghand upon his arm advanced to thecot and in a delicate and sympatheticmanner questioned the sick man regarding himself and his children She ex-plained that their needs had been calledto her attention only a few hours before She soon ascertained that therewas urgent need of nourishment andbidding her

you reclaim itwith the check and pass it in at a counter and receive anotner cnecK as youapproach your destination another functionary comes along the train takesyour cheok and gives you another checkin its place He fishes out your baggageand conveys it to your hotel for a consideration You have left your thirdand last check at the office of the hotelwhen you enter it and thence it is delivered up on receipt of the baggageAt first you bless this arrangement asthe salvation of the traveler After afew weeks of it the tyranny of the checkbecomes so galling that you begin tolong for the fine old English method ofdumping down your goods in front of aporter and leaving them to find the waythemselves You would even hail it asa personal triumph if some of your baggage would get lost But it never doesSometimes it arrives late but it alwaysarrivesYet it seldom arrives in the shape inwhich it started if that is any consolation They who have to do with baggage see to that You very

foundingand which has won a national reputation as a boulevard has had two defects The streets leading to it wereusually dusty and disagreeable whilethe darkness of the avenue owing to thedense foliage of the overhanging peppertrees made it a rather dismal eveningdrive All that is at an end It is nowpossible to drive from the heart of townover macadamized streets perfectly freefrom dust and mud direct to the peerless Magnolia avenue and if the drivebe taken in the ovening arc lights areencountered every 800 feet givingsplendid illumination When the avenue is reached there is presented sucha sight as few if any towns possessThe electric poles are but 124 feet apartand from these brackets project aboutthree feet From each bracket hangs acluster of three incandescent lights covered

WAS HOTThe Hash Epicures Initial ExperienceWith a Chafing DishI had heard of chafing dishes foryears said Smiley Williams but theone I saw for the first time floored melcompletelyI never thought lnnch about theblamed things but somehow I supposeda chafing dish was some sort of concernthat they grated things in somethingthat rubbed together auJ mashed thingsThe other night though Boltonand I went into a Madison street restaurant for dinner You know I alwayshave a sneakingliking for hash of anykind and so does Bolton Bolton ordered turkey hash for two and the waiterbrought it on in a swell sort of silverdish nearly as tall as a cake basket Ithad a tight cover and when we openedit it steamed like a 40 horsepower boiler blowing offI loaded up Boltons plate and inthe first pass at it he took the skin offhis tongue it was so hotJust like these infernal placesBolton growled Anything youve gotto eat is blistering hot while coffee isalways stone coldAfter awhile Bolton took some morehash and burned his tongue againHoly Moses he said whats gotinto that hashI told him nobody was expected toknow anything about restaurant hashespecially the fellow who was eating itbut he wasnt satisfiedWell we kept on eating hash untilwe had enough And do you know thathash left in the dish was hotter than itwas at the startWell said Bolton I wouldnthave believed my eyes but with mostof the skin off my

Trying toEnunciate Very PlainlyMany people and I am sorry to saysome teachers of the deaf fail to realizein practice at least that speech is notas clearly visible to the eyeasitjis audible to the ear and think that by speaking slowly word by word and openingtheir mouths to the widest extent theywill render the task of the speech readereasier As a matter of faot they renderit all the more difficult- A child inschool may learn to understand a teacher who mouths his words in this manner but this ability is of no value tohim when he leaves school Indeed perfectly natural deliberate speech ij easierto understand than the exaggeratedform of articulation which people areapt to use the moment they know theyare talking to a totally deaf personPeople who depend entirely -upontheir speech reading for understandingothers have requested me when introducing them to strangers not to saythat they were deaf because they findit easier to read the lips when the person speaking is not aware that he is Being understood in that way I have inmy acquaintance a young man educatedwholly by this method who travels agreat deal and pioks up acquaintanceson the steamer or on the train just aspeople do who possess all their facultiesI have in mind also a congenitallydeaf girl of 14 who is not consideredunusually bright yet whose speech isclearly intelligible to strangers afterthe first

for amoment and then following the captain began again I beg your pardonyou saidIts the Lake Huron roared thecaptain thinking the man was deafYes I know persisted the passenger but whats the name of the lakethat Im onThe Lake Huron shouted the captain incensed at what he thought grossstupidity and he turned away to relievehimself by railing at one of the handsThe Englishman looked more puzzledthan everThe lake youre on is the lake youreon Of course it is The lake Im onI cant help being the lake Im on Whatimpertinence 1 Let me look in my guidebook Perhaps that will tell meIt did tell
