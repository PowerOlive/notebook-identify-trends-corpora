STATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE
TO HAVE BIG EXHIBIT
The College of Agriculture, Uni
versity of Kentucky, is preparing an
elaborate educational exhibit to be
shown at the State Fair this year.
Under plans now being worked out
booths ivill be arranged so that the
work and method of work of the de
partments will be shown, such as
agronomy, animal husbandry, farm
.management, horticulture, food and
drugs, markets, entomology and bot
any. Extension workers in boys' and
girls' agricultural clubs and poultry
clubs are planning -unusually inter
esting shows.
Seven thousand boys and girls of
the State are interested in the club
exhibits and they will be represented
by one delegate from each county in
which there is a club. The delegate,
heretofore, has been the first prize
winner of the club and- the same
method, will, doubtless, be used this
year. One thousand dollars will be
given the boys and girls for premi
ums this year.
Kentucky, the first State in the
Union to attempt the task of intro
ducing pure bred poultry stock into
every county of the State, will have
one of the most interesting features
of the fair in the poultry exhibit,
uniting as it will so many attractive
and educational phases.

KENTUCKY TO RAISE LARGE
CROP OP BUCKWHEAT.
Steps to make Kentucky a bigger
buckwheat State will be taken this
month by John R. Humphrey, head of
the department of markets, Univer
sity of Kentucky. He will" go to Pu
laski county the latter part of July
to formulate three farmers' co-operative
companies for the purpose of es
tablishing elevators, the first in the
State.
Several sections of Kentucky, Mr.
Humphrey said, are admirably adapt
ed to raising of buckwheat, and this
land can produce little else, besides
brush and grass. Buckwheat is sown
late in July or early in August and
thrives on sandy soil.
. Extension of the buckwheat indus
try, Mr. Humphrey said, also carries
with it the extension of another im
portant industry, that of bee keep
ing. Pulaski, Barren and Metcalfe
counties are the best suited for the
raising of this crop.
One hundred and fifty thousand
bushels of buckwheat were produced
in Kentucky last year, and it is esti
mated the crop this season will be of
about equal amount. But notwith
standing this yield Kentucky has no
elevators and all the crop has to be
sent to mills in Pennsylvania and
Wisconsin, entailing additional ex
pense. It is estimated within a few
years the yield will be close to 500,
000 bushels annually in the State.

FORMER PUBLISHER ENGAGES IN

James E. Hughes, former publish

ton and later the proprietor of a large
job printing plant there, but who
for sopie time has been a resident of
Louisville, has opened the Louisville

awaken to the realization of the mag

HERE'S MAN HAD NOT HEARD
OF DRAFT LAW.
Failure to subscribe for a newspa
per is said to be responsible for the
plight in which John Shultz, a resi
dent of Riverside, California, finds
himself.
Shortly before the selective service
act, effective June 5, 1917, Schultz
obtained a job in the mountains fell
ing trees. He knew the United States
was at war, but he claims he did not
know about the order to register.
When he came back to Riverside to
see his wife and child he was arrest
ed as a "slacker." "This teaches me
a lesson," said Shultz to his attorney,
Lou Guernsey: "I'll never try to
do without a paper again."
