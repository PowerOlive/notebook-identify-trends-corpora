" ' --At the evening session of the
v'Chautauqua, Friday, a nice little sum
Twas Taisei to defray the burial ex-
Ipenses of little James Louis Baker,
colored, and also to place a monu
zxnent at his grave. The child jmet his
"'"death in the park Thursday after-
noan by the falling of the Chautau
qua, tent, which at that time was be
lag erected. One of. the large poles
istruck him killing him .instantly.
"Small children were warned to keep
. out of the way, but, of course, they
c&xlcL not all be watched. President
T5"- D. Mclntyre, of the local Chau-
tP'iqua promo tors, delivered a short
- address to the audience at the open
f ins -of the meeting. The people re-
- sponged liberally, and a good sum
-tous realized. The White & Myers
!L5xeum Buereau, which is furnish
ing the talent for the Chautauqua,
-will also ' contribute liberally to the
Xund,
- TffE CHAUTAUQUA. The an
nual Millersburg Chautauqua opened
"iFrtday afternoon in the Millersburg
"park.- The attendance has been good
thus far, and the talent for better
"then' we expected, wThen he realize
hat-a great many of the public
speakers are now in the service of the
Government, as are also a great num
f? "her of the good musical aggregations.
"" ''Blank's European Orchestra gave a
-" 'easing concert in the afternoon,
- and'the prelude in the evening? and
-waSffollowed by the brilliant lecturer
VDr. , -Jay. .William Hudson, subject,
- Asrcrrcan Ideals." It was good and
" he. certainly told us how the Kaiser
1 should 'be disposed of, and how Bel-
giu,ttt to a small degree might be re
imbursed.
Saturday afternoon we were enter
' - taioed by the Cecelian Chorus, in
v tfoncert Their choruses and solos
' were "all of a.-pleasing character, cal-
culatd' to entertain any audience.
I . In 'the -evening they gave an equally
vplfia&iirg prelude, -and was followed
" -DyTr: Yiolett, u Kansas City, Mo.;
v itfar lecture which will never be fori
Vgotten iiere, entitled, "The Freedom
xQf The SeSs." Dr. Violett is indeed a
TTHywerful speaker and much of his
' tiaift is given to government work.
"He gave a precise, brief historic ac-
-count -of Germany's attitude on the
-sea. the wonderful work that had'
"been done by the U. S. Government
in builaing and launching of war ves
tads and transports and the wonderful
'-amount of munitions, food supplies
acad men that had been sent to
iuropeviinfi the past year. He paid
'the Ittlghest complipient to President
? Vflson that had been contributed by
.-lMT one at any" time since the open
ine of the war in Millersburg. He
Txwi. an easy-flow of language and
aid the right' thing at the right
time. ' His invectives against the
'Kaiser" and" the German government
, -were equally appropriate.
Sunday at 10:45 a. m. Elder W. E.
lllis,;of the Paris Christian church,
"eltvefed a most eloquent sermon, in
r the Chautauqua tent. It was a un
ion service and another large audi
ence was. in attendance. Elder Ellis
.'tlid not come' to us as a stranger, and
' we felt' that we knew what to expect.
vHe certainly was at his best and in a
spirit which was in keeping with the
- times, delivered an address which
-went beyond all expectations, and
rivalled those which had preceeded
vTiim since the opening of the Chau
tauqua. ' In -the afternoon we were
entertained for a short tipie by Pearl
--.O'iteil, a Canadian reader, which was
soodv She was followed by Rev.
XJlyde Wilson McCord, of Omaha,
"Nebraska, who is also a forcible
,. -speaker;, pointing out to us the ne
rceaeity of preparedness now and after
the -war, calling attention to the
;r"womerful work we have already done
-m'to the wonderful work to be done
s,fter the close of the war to prevent
warsin the. future. And above all
'taiags to have a .greater care with
"the jfrowiag up of our children than
we kave had in the past. He also

this the date was set up to the 2 2d,

PUBLISHERS VIGOROUSLY AT
TACK NEW. POSTAL ZONE LAW
Newspaper and pagazine .publish
ers, in a hearing before the Hotise
Ways and Means Committee, ,T at
Washington, made their final attempt
to obtain a repeal of the postal zone
rate law, which became effective
July 1. The hearing-was to be the
last in connection with the new $S,
000,000,000 war revenue bill, draft
ing of which was started, by the
committee yesterday. ' ' x
Jesse H. Neal, of JNew York, ex
ecutive secretary of the Associated
Business Papers, Incorporated, com
prising 600 trade papers, testified for
repeal of the increased "rates. Bfe
said the present rates are no more
asubsidy for the farmer and spoke
of the war work accompliehed byHhe
newspapers.
"I call attention," Mr. Neal said,
"to the statements made that ?5,
000,000 to $30, 0000,000 have been
raised to projmote German propa
ganda and have been sent into the
United States. Ai an advertising
man and speaking for the advertis
ing fraternity, let me say that jwe J
deeply regret that Congress ha3 seen
fit to appropriate only $1,000,000 for
the Public Information Committtee to
counteract the countless millions
spent' for German propaganda."
Mr. Neal quoted- many public men
against the zone system. He cited
conditions in Russia to-day as illus
trative of the effects of lack of in
terchange of communication and uni
ty of thought.. '
Mr. Neal suggested abolishment of
the congressional franking privilege
would add $25,000,000 or ,more to
the postal revenues.

SCHOOL PER CAPITA TO
SLIGHTLY INCREASED.
BE
The school per capita for the
school year 1918-19 will be $5.25,
an increase of twenty-five cents over
last year. The per capita is based
on an , estimated school revenue of
$3,58,557, which includes every
item in which the school revenues
have participated with the excep
tion of the inheritance tax which
Auditor Greene refused to submit,
believing that the law does not jus
tify paying any part of this fund
to the school fund. s
Superintendent V.' O.' Gilbert will
institute a friendly suit to contest
the decision believing that the
school should continue to participate
in the inheritance tax fund as'Jn the
past. Heretofore the school fund has
received approximately sixty thous
and dollars or seventy thousand dol
lars annually from this source. If
the school fund is allowed by the
court to participate in the inheri
tance tax sopiething like $1,500,000
will accrue to that fund when the
Bingham estate is settled.
An overestimate made last year re
sulted in the school fund being about
$300,000 short. This " deficiency
must be met before the distribution
is made. Taking thisHnto considera
tion, together with the Tiigh cost 6t
Hiving, and the war pressure, Super
intendent Gilbert was forced to de
clare a six1 months school term.
