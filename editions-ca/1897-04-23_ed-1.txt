poorly armed with old carbinesThey did their best to save us butthe Spaniards surrounded them andhacked them to pieces with their machetes Ten minutes later they hadsurrounded us also and began

sent word to the Spanishofficers that they had come there forsupplies and if they were permittedto get them and retire without troublethey would not attack them but if theSpanish troops disturbed them theywould burn the town and capture anddestroy the blockhousesThis bluff succeeded The Cubanforce looted seven or eight stores nearest the church taking large quantitiesof supplies Before leaving they compelled the alcade of the town to havetables spread in the church whereupon the officers sat down to a feast-to which a large number of personsattended After remaining in thetown for six or seven

werecompletely and finally repulsedIn Athens greater attention has beenpaid to the operations in the neighborhood of Eeveni than to those at Milouna pass The theory all along hasbeen that if the Greeks could establish themselves at Damasi their roadwould lie open to ElassonaThe exact situation at Tyrnavo issomewhat in doubt The news fromthat point is conflicting But there isno confirmation of the rumor that theplace has been captured by the TurksWhat seems to have happened at Tyrnavo was evacuated in order to sendtroops forward to Reveni and was thenre occupied by troops returning

dispatches Official dispatchesreport also that further heavy breacheshave been made in the Turkish fortsat Prevesa The bombardment ceasedat nightfall but was resumed Wednesday morningThe ironclad Spetzia has left theGulf of Arta to join the eastern squadron which it is said has an importantmissionAthens April 21 The news ofjthecapture of Damasi puts a new complexion upon the situation on thefrontier is a great encouragement tothe government and is likely to havethe most effect upon thespirits of the Greeks who hadbeen greatly depressed by thereverses of their troops at MilounaPass This success and the factthat the fall of Prevesa seems imminent virtually offsets the calamity atMilouna If the Greek divisions effect a union at Damasi as is expectedthere is almost nothing in the wayof their prompt advance to ElassonaShould the Greeks succeed in reducing the forts at Prevesa as now seemsprobable and in occupying the townwith the large land force co operatingwith the bombarding- warships theroad to Janina would be open and theTurkish troops in Epirus placed at themost serious disadvantage The strategic value of Prevesa to the Turkish division in Albania is thatso long as it remains in thehands of the Turks it makes possible asteady line of munitions and food supplies With Prevesa in the hands ofthe Greeks this line would be promptlycut and it would be practically impossible to revictual the Turkish troopsby the long land route through Macedonia-On the other hand the Greektroops could be revictualed by seaRome April 21 According to a dis -patchto

NecessaryWashington April 22 There hasbeen some discussion of the probableprogramme of the democratic membersof the finance committee with reference to the tariff bill and it is learnedthat while their plans are not definitely matured they intend to havereasonable consideration of the billin committee and believe thatthey will have the support oiSenator Jones of Nevada uponany fair proposition they submit Thedemocrats do not want an extendedconsideration in committee but maydesire to offer some amendments afterthey have seen the bill the adoptionof which they consider they would bemore likely to secure in the committeethan in the open senate It is said thatin the senate the democratic plan is notto delay the bill any longer than isnecessary but that every senator desiring to discuss itshall have the opportunity to do so and that suchrecord-making- votes as the democratsthink necessary shall be had Thispolicy the democrats will pursue tothe end In this connection it may bestated that Ihe democrats of the senate do not approve of the policyof Mr Bailey and his fellow democrats of the house Attention is calledto the fact that it was long- ago saidthat the policy of Speaker Reed andthe republicans of the house are pursuing would be followed in order todirect attention to the delay of thetariff bill in the senate If delayshould ensue by reason of debate bydemocratic senators it will be pointedout democratic senators say that thisdelay is not endorsed by the majorityof the democrats of the houseThe Bailey democrats will be endorsing the republican s in their criticisms of the democratic senators Itis not known whether or not the advice which the democratic senatorialleaders are freely giving the democrats of the house will be taken butit is known that house democrats havebeen advised that acquiescence in therepublican tactics is not good policyThe democratic senators do not wantcriticisms which may be directed atthem to be indirectly endorsed by thedemocratic members of the houseIt was learned Wednesday that inthe changes made in the tariff bill bythe senate sub committee the rates inthe metal schedule have been madevery close to the present law and thesame is said of the cotton scheduleThe chemical schedule is understoodto be about completed Many changesin it in the direction of reductions havebeen madeWashington April 22 The secretary of war Wednesday sent to thehouse a report from the chief of engineers of the army upon the survey ofthe mouth of the Green river Kywith a view to the construction of aLock and dam He reports that theproposed improvements would cost294 000 and are not justified Thesecretary also reports that the proposedacquisition of the channel excavatedthrough Atchafalaya bay La by theMorgan Steamship Co is not advisableWashington April 22 The speakerof the house Wednesday received thethird letter from Attorney GeneralMcKenna urging in strong terms thatappropriations for the expenses of theUnited States courts be made at onceWithout special appropriation the attorney general represents that thecourts must adjourn or else certifi2ates be issued for expenses of jurorswitnesses and officers and that manypersons now held in jail will havetheir confinement lengthenedWashington April 22 The republican members of the finance committee of the senate have reached anagreement either to strike out theretroactive provisions of the Dingleytariff bill or amend it so as to pave theway so to have it stricken out in conference and have so notified the democratic members of the committeeThe democrats have agreed in viewof this promise not to press theVest resolution on the subject ofSecretary Gages recent circularThis was one of the accomplishmentsof the visit of the republican membersto the senate Tuesday The sentimentamong the republican members is saidto have been against the provision fromthe first but they felt that to take decisive diverse action upon it in the faceof democratic opposition would placethem in the light of acting underfire and taking a position because of thecriticisms of the opposition Theytherefore asked that the democratskeep their hands off until the republicans should have an opportunity tomake their intentions known Thedemocrats considered this propositionas reasonable and agreed to refrainfrom pressing consideration of the Vestresolution until the result of the laborsof the republican members could beknownWhile not absolutely decided between the material modification of theprovision and its complete cancellationthe balance of opinion in the committee is understood to be quite on theside of destroying it entirely Thedemocratic senators generally Tselievethis will be the result of the committees deliberations and expect thatwhen the bill is handed to them theclause will have disappearedNotre Dame Defeats University of MichiganSouth Bend Ind April 22 TheUniversity ot Notre Dame baseballnine administered a sound whippingto the

provision as to children of a white father andIndian mother was modified so as to givethese children tribal rights on the consent of a majority of the tribe and theconsent of the secretary of the interior MrVest of Missouri spoke in criticism of theprovision of the bill abolishing sectarian Indian schools He knew he said that what hesaid would subject him to bitter criticismHe was brought up a Protestant and had ncconnection with the Roman Catholic churchBut he had no sympathy with that cowardlyand ignorant sentiment that any religious denomination could menace ouiliberties He had bsen reared tobelieve the Jesuits were opposed torepublican institutions But he had traveledthrough the Indian country visiting theschools and had found them a travesty on education except when conducted by the Jesuits Broken down preachers and defunctpoliticians were sent out to the westerncountry to teach the Indian children He hadfound he said that the only Indian schoolsaccomplishing any good were those conducted by the Jesuits The -ceremonialof the Catholic church seemed to appealto the Indians I do not belong to that sectwho would rather see an Indian damned thansee him in the Catholic church

CORAL ISLAND EXPEDITIONIt Ulade tx Complete Failure in ItsOperations at FunafutiA vigorous attempt to wrest from thejealous hands of nature the secret ofthe origin and genesis of coral atollsand reefs commonly jjpoken of as coralislands was made last summer by anexpedition sent out to the Ellice bythe Boyal society assisted by a committee of the British association underthe charge of Prof Sollas of the University of Dublin The chief objectnf the expeditionitwiliberememberedwas to ascertain by sounding and boring the genesis of a coral island andthe means employed were fully described in the Times of September 5last The article on the coral islandexpedition it was stated that the actualoxeration of boring through the deposits of coral to the strata below wascomparatively easy provided all goeswell Unfortunately for the elucidation of the mystery of the origin ofcoral atolls all has not gone well Fromthe report submitted by Prof Sollas tothe Royal society on February 11 it appears that the expedition arrived atFunafuti on May 21 last year and thefirst difficulty was to land the boringplant and drhd ng machinery A landing place having been selected theheavy plant was taken on shore and onJune 3 within tAvo days of the landingof the apparatus the first attempt atboring was made near the edge of thelagoon Progress in boring was afirst rapid the men working day andnight in three shifts of eight hourseach and in a fortnight the bore holewas 105 feet deep But unfortunatelythe sand poured into the hole fasterthan it could be pumped out and whenit was certain that no further advancecould be made the boring at this spotwas reluctantly abandonedThe expedition then determined totry the outer or seaward side of thebeach and a spot was found where theoral rock seemed to be harder and morepromising Accordingly trial pitswere sunk and the apparatus and engines brought round to this side of theisland The landing of the plant on theseaward side was however attendedwith great difficulty so while some ofthe machinery was brought round bywater the rest including- the boilerswhich were rolled bodily along thebeach by natives was taken overlandNews had meanwhile been sent to Sidney N S W where the authorities verykindly sent out additional boring machinery which however faded to arrive in time On the outer side thenof the coral ring boring was recommenced and carried to a depth of some72 feet But the difficulties here wereeven greater then they had been on theother side Had the carbonado diamonddrill encountered the hardest rock itcould have cut through it with easeBut no such solid material was foundAt a depth of 32 feet coral rock wasfound but it was far from solid andbeing full of holes either filled withsand or empty it was almost impossibleto bore through it As fast as the sanwas pumped out fresh supplies flowedin choked the tubes clogged the drilland eventually rendered it utterly impossible for the most powerful drill topenetrate further The boring tubeswere pushed do vy n some 20 feet by mainforce but were interrupted by blockso coral rock In short the water usedfor lubricating purposes flowed out andsand poured into the hole andit was evident that further progress was impossible So the Fecond boring was abandoned at a lesser depth than had beenattained in the first instance and theexpedition left Funafuti at the end otJuly London

sight to see a boy loweredby a rope over the precipice carryinga big basket of earth and cuttings olmulberry twigs to plant in his hanginggarden The crop of leaves fodder forthe worms is gathered in the same wayBy such patient and dangerous industryhave these hardy mountaineers beenable to make their wilderness of rockblossom into brightly colored silksNot a single leaf is left on the treesby the time the voracious worms getready to spin their cocoons but a second crop comes on later and a curioususe is made of thatThe tree owner purchases one of thosequeer big tailed Syrian sheep the tailof which weighs 20 pounds when at thefull maturity of its fatness and then astrange stuffing process begins not unlike the fattening of the Strasburggeese When the sheep can eat no morethe women of the house feed it and it isno uncommon sight to see a woman going out to make an afternoon call leading her sheep by a string and carryinga basket of mulberry leaves on her armHaving arrived at her friends houseshe squats on the ground rolls a ball olmulberry leaves in her right hand andslips it into the sheeps mouth thenworks the sheeps jaw up and downwith the other hand till she thinks

birds in the roofs old thatches-The winds in the tall elm treeThe pathway that led to the woodlandsMade the happiest home for meThen no world beyond the meadowsDisturbed my beautiful dreamMy playmates were birds and flowersAnd we used to singto the streamBut now the green meadows have widenedFar far to the rolling seaAnd I sail away on its bosomFrom the home or my InfancyOh lands o crimson and purpleDh white jeweled cities afarYe throb on the restless oceanYe dazzle like orient starBut oh for the home of my childhoodAnd my world of meadow and treeFor ihe quiet calm of those old old daysHas

ten oclock Thatsfour since March Were absolutelyruinedThe clerks sat there like bits ofstone the two partners stared at eachother you could have heard a featherdrop They were rich as things go Idheard

onto thebuzz ot their talk and fairly itching todo or say something Then in about 15minutes back tears their clerk with theword that Sauuders was very sorry butthe owners had that very minute engaged him to make an investigationnext morning and he didnt think therewas another diver worth a cent in thepJacc just then hed find outThe two partners spun round andlooked at each other and it didnt

this very minuteBut there I mustnt talk I came nighnever seeing it again in this worldDead to the minute I was down atthe docks next morning ready for anything Lacy Truman hed been on hisieet all night lcould tell had made allthe arrangements and he meant business So did the other party it wasplain Saunders and I ifc was agreedwere to go down together and reportafterwards Theyd hired a small cutter between them and appeared to befriendly enough on the outside butthere was something in the air rightenough Oh ayeWell the moment the tide hadturned off we started with the salvageboat and a dozen others after us to seew hat there might be to see I knew MrLacy had an idea the other party meantto hamper us if possible but it didntappear so in less than an hour theydmade the spot Saunders and some othe Witchs crew were straining theireyes over the sideThere she lies mates in tenfathoms or Im a Dutchman he saysquietly 1o me Can ye go the depthnothingwatching hima j iHSlike pluck- eh Wellsoon know all about her cargo now Getvour things onDown below I goes and was ready assoon as he Course being what he washe had the sneer of me the minute beknew I was no expert but he seemedaffable enough and even a little friendly Just before we stuck our headgearon and Mr Trumanwas seeing my tubeextra fast to the pumper he pulls out abrand v bottle and offers me a mouthfuloffhand I had it to my lijs when somehow I caught his eyes and that manwell he flinchedHave some yourself says I handing it backT always do well no I wont justyet he says with a laugh and tossesthe bottle overboard1 couldnt quite get the grip of thatand perhaps it was this action that gaveme a nasty sinking sensation when Istood readv with the helmet on and 30of solid lead on my bootsgo dowu the ladder andcoolly slide into that green ten fathomsravIt was a lot oyer old dock depthsand 1 felt a tilt dreamy so to speakwhen 1 heard the engine start pumpingaway for me But there it was I hadno notion of backing out then Down Istepped let inyself go and knew not athing- more till I found myself standingstill on the bottom dizzy with thedepth sick after the suspense and witha noise in my head as if a hundredthroats had started screeching Thatlasted about half a minute then Ipulled myself together took anotherkink of the life line and kenw I was allright for Lacy Trumans jobWhere was SaundersI looked round It wasnt like harbor water you - could see as well aslooking at daylight through thickglasses and there was he standing afew yards off Hashing his diving lampahead Wed tumbled on abed of sandwhite as snow I could inake out mightyworms and shellfish crawling over iteverything looks twice its size at thatdepth and great castles of rock hereand there with sea creepers swayingabout something- lovely and shoals ofsmall fish zig zagging in and out likesilver spear points but neer a sign ofour ship Then present I saw Saunders shaking his light and pointing Hedlocated it straight away with his experienceAfter him I goes for about I shouldreckon DO or GO yards over slimy hillocks and dovn bits of valley and therewiis the Witch lying three parts overon a bit of rising ground her mainmastpointing down at our heads a sadenough sight Saunders he was up toher deck rail in a jiffy got hisover it and had climbed overbefore I could take it in When I followed I stopped haif way because 1 feltthe timbers shaking and could almostswear there was the dull sound of an axhacking away like fury I just waitedand presently he comes clamberingback to pU his helmet against mineand there was a splinter of wood sticking to his ax and he was pantingRotten mate A three foot leak inthe outer hold was what he shoutedHatches blocked Im afraid Well haveto come down again and blow a hole inher side to get at the silk Got yourline Say whenHalf a minute 1 shouted backPerhaps he thought Id had enough ofit and reckoned I should be glad to takehis word for everything Asjt was being afraid lo go too nearjtheI walked round by the fqreneakw assmart as I could twung myscrf up tothe keel board and crawled along therefeeling and looking both sides for thehole he had made it his business tohack -I couldnt find it but I found-something els8 that made the blood i higle inqueerly I hadnt really expected it and only the sheerest bit ofluck could have put it in my way by thatlight but there acouple of yards up theside of the forehold were three biosplintered holes that nothin- 4- I-tfa-and turned to crawl back and therewas Saunders stooping behind me AndI was fool enough to take hold of hisfingers and plug them in the holes tomake him feel the inside smoothnessHe seemed startled himself anddidnt say a word till we had clambereddown to the sand again Then as I wentto tug my line feeling a bit nervoushe catches my arm and puts his glassagainst mineScuttled be saidAye scuttled I yelled back andthe next thing I knew was that I layon uij back empty handed He hadtripped me and jerked away the lifeline Well all the blood rushedto my head thats about ali I knowI lay there stunned most by thethought that such villain could find aplace in any mans mind But he wasnot quite quick enough as he went tostep back 1 caught him behind theknees with one hand and down hecame Then came the struggle for lifeand death and it doesntbear describingI had tumbled to the whole thing in aflash he had been offered a price not tolet me go up if by chance I found outanything black and it had been bigenough to make a rogue of himI held on to him for a minute or solike a vise but I was undermost theweight of him on my chest and the notion of what he intended doing suffocating me almost Clouds of white sandwent whirling up about us and the redmist in my e3res made them seem realblood color I recollect Aye he meantit that day he knew hed gone too farto draw back the mad fool Throughthe glass I made out his ax going up asif he could see no way for it but tosmash in my helmet and leave the waterto do the rest 1 just had strengthenough to give one mighty screecfithen I was done closed my eyes andwaited for the thudIt never came mates but if it wasnttouch-and-go with death what was itThat he was going to do the thing Ivenever had a doubt but all of a suddenthere was a jerk of his line up he wentand I hanging on to his ankles hadsufficient sense not to let go Up upvery slowly for the line had a doubleweight that they didnt know of aboveUp up and in my dreams siuce Iveoften felt the kicks he gave to get freeof roe But Heaven wouldnt a How itIve no recollection of reaching theblessed surface and being hauled abovebut it goes without saying or 1wouldnt be telling the tale nowMr Lacy told me afterwards thatwhen they unstrapped my thhigs 1 wasblrck in the face and dead to the worldThey thought 1 was going and put backto shore at once- but however once inmy bed at home 1 got back enoughsense to gasp out something that sMithim off to the police hot foot Thenext thing I linew was that Id been illfor a week and that they were waitingfor me to give evidence at the trialTruman Brothers vs the owners andcaptain of the WitchIt lasted days and clays and at firstseemed as if it was going against usAn expert diver had gone down andmade his report but the owners calmlyswore that the auger holes were a revelation to them and the crew did thesame Onlj one thing did it theircaptain wasnt to be found or heard ofand in the end they got off with t hesuspicion of conspiracy to defraudand the loss of the insurance moneyand costs Of course it was morallyclear as daylight theyd over insuredthe cargoand arranged with the captaintc scuttle the old vessel at a certainpoint and it hadnt turned out quite asthey meant but all that had to beproved and it wasnt projmrty done tothe courts satisfactionSaunders Well there mv bloodboils now at thought of it he got offscot free and for all I know walksHobart Town to this day as an honestman I see him now standing up therein the dock and persisting that Iddreamed it all that Id got insensibleand really owed my life to him Nevermind its haunted his sleep once ortwice since 1 will lay Youll hardlybelieve that I stuck to the work afterthat but 1 did And whats moremates Ive got the best part of the 300that Lacy Truman banked for me justput by for the day when I have to giveup business as a deep sea diver TitBitsArranft

about the qualityof eiderdown used in quilts sold forfive or six dollars There are threegrades and the range in price is 1012 and 15 a pounduThe down is imported chiefly fromGreenland and Iceland where it isgathered by the natives When theducks build their nests they line themwith down plucked from their ownbreasts This first lining is the finestquality of down After a nest is robbedthe ducks

its scarcity and costliness it is used only in filling the most expesive cushions andquilts It can be used to a greater advantage and is really the only satisfactory filling for elegant smokingjackets muff beds womens skirts andbabies clothingThe next quality of down is goosedown which isproduced in the UnitedStates the larger part coming from thewestern and southern states Thereare three grades at 3 2 and 150 apound The first grade is the puredown plucked from the breast of thelive goose The other two grades areextracted by machinery from the feathers of poultry plucked for the marketThe feathers are sold in bulk unsortedand have to be separated by special machines The only goose down imported comes from China It is white butnot so fluffy as the American and consequently used only for cheaper fillingDuck down is imported almost exclusively from China in feathersThere are about three grades Thebest or pure down sells for 125 and isused for making a fair quality of quiltslinings

Somewhat ImperfertIIccljaiiismThe opinion at the present time ofthose best fitted to judge of the futureof the motor carriage is as followsSteam wiil probably be used and it willbe generated by means of liquid fuelIt will be necessary to invent suitableair condensers to obviate the clouds ofsteam and to provide means of disposing of the smoke and cinders Thisopinion is based uxjonvthe soundness ofour knowledge of the properties ofsteam and upon its steadiness of actionunder definite conditions It is not believed by the chief authorities that thepractical motor carriage can be madevery light and it is not thought forinstance that a light motor can be madewhich would be a serviceable attachment for an ordinary bicycle to assistthe rider to mount hills or even to takepart in the propulsion overlevel smoothroads Such motors undoubtedly can bemade but they are not fitted for everyday use In the first days of Ihe popularity of the bicycle hundreds of ingenious inventions were made for increasing the range of the machine Thetendency was to make all the parts aslight as possible Longer experience hasshown that complicated lufehanismdoes not stand the wear and tear ofdaily use The modern machine hasbeen shorn of many so called improvements and its weight has begun to increase for it has been found that machines weighing less than 20 pounds arenot serviceable on common roads Themotor carriage of the future will probably imitate the bicycle in its rubbertires and bail bearings it will have averv respectable weight and it will renuire a smooth road Prof JohnS P in

CloselyThey Should Be ManuredThere is quite a diversify of opinionamong farmers and stock raisers on thequestion of manuring native pasturelands Some have obtained excellentresults by manuring while othersseem to have had quite the opposite experienceThe soil of the western prairies isvery rich and under ordinary circumstances will give fair returns withoutthe application of fertilizers of anykind - Nevertheless it is certain thatbetter returns maj be had if more available food is placed within reach of thegrasses Anyone who lias observed apiece of grass land so situated as to receive the wash from a barnyard willhave found that near the yard where thesupply of fertilizer has been great thegrasses have become thinned out to afew species while where the supply hasbeen moderate the grasses are muchmore evenly developed and the yielddecidedly plain A too plenteous application of fertilizer will thin out thegrasses and reduce the yield of forageat least for the first season or two sincemany species will not stand such treatment On the other hand a properamount of fertilizer will increase theyield It is quite possible to use toomuch fertilizer for any crop and thenative grasses seem to be more sensitive in this respect than the ordinarycultivated speciesAny pasture which has been grazedclosely for some time will be benefitedby an application of a thin top-dressingof well rotted stable manure followed by a thorough harrowing Itis doubtful if much is gained by puttingcoarse unrotted manure on the pastureit can be used to better advantage oncultivated land Ashea usually

from thekitchen answer for waterThere is always more or less losswhen an inferior sire is usedIt will help maintain health if thehogs have pure fresh water every dayThe putting in and culture of thecrops has much to do with their productivenessThe farmer ought to be a good judgeof live stock and know how to buy andsell to the best advantageWhen the sheep are sheared is oneof the best times to determine whatsheep should be kept and what soldIt is the steady quiet horse that canusually be depended upon to do thebiggest days work during hot weatherWith all classes of stock it is betterto wait
