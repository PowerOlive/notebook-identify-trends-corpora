(RECREATION POR GIRLS IN THE
SMALL KENTUCKY TOWNS
URGED.
The need for proper recreation for
the young girl in small towns of Ken
tucky was stressed by Mrs. Margaret
Thoroman State Chairman of the
Health and Recreation Committee,
Council of National Defense. Within
the past month, forty delinquent
girls, all from Kentucky towns, have
been stranded in Louisville and have
been dealt with by the social work
ers and law enforcement authorities
of Louisville.
With the men concentrated in the
cantonments, the social and recrea
tional life of the town Is dead and
the girls want to swarm to the city.
The Woman's Committee is urging
upon its county chairmen the need
for providing recreational activities
for the girls, and is attempting to
arouse a sense of social responsibility
in meeting this problem. The use of
the school house as a community cen
ter for social intercourse is the
method advised. Community singing,
which is being organized all over the
State, will provide another avenue
of interest. d
"Make your town attractive, so
that the girls will want to stay in
it," says Mrs. Thoroman.. "They are
safer there. Utilize their surplus en
ergy in war work and give them the
right kind of recreational opportuni
ties and they will be more willing to
stay at home.

MEXICAN FLOATING' GARDENS
DATE BACK TO AZTEC ERA
The famous Mexican "floating gar
dens," which are vividly shown in a
tour of Mexico,, a feature of Lyman
H. Howe's newest Travel Festival,
which come to the Paris Grand on
Monday, September 9th, are in real
ity centuries old.
The floating gardens are actually
small farms constructed on dense
masses of tangled roots on the Mex
ican lakes. The method of construct
ing these gardens dates back to
Aztec days. The ancient Aztecs
were very ingenious, in fact their
civilization is the oldest in the Amer
icas, and, in many ways, was in ad
vance of contemporary European
civilization.
The motion picure tour of Mex
ico is both quaint and picturesque.
For the first time the real Mexico is
shown to Americans, for the series
embraces everything from native
life in the interior scenes in cosmo
politan Mexico City,
Other features of the Howe pro
gram show how ferocious wild ani
manls are captured alive in the
Rockies, sensational aviation stunts
by the U. S. Marines, a perilous canoe
trip throughr the jungles of South
America to Kaieteur Falls and new
scenes in natural colors of the beau
ties of Southern, France. There will
also be a clever animated reproduc
tion of the famous Red Cross poster
"Greatest Mother in the World,"'
and a peculiar "freak" film which
displays some amazing results in
the way of scenic distortions.
Amusing cartooa? comedies will be
freely interspersed throughout the
program; of courae, and there will be
a number of patriotic film novelties
from the Lyman H. Howe studio.
