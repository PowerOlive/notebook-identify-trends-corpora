Hopper Spins a Pinafore Yarn
Some years ago when the Pinafore
craze was at its height the actor who
impersonated Sir Joseph Porter during
a production of that opera at the Varie
ties theater New Orleans had a make
up which transformed him into an
exact facsimile of Admiral Murray of
the United States navy who was then
stationed at New Orleans One night an
old salt of Murrays command was sit
ting in the front jaw of the gallery
When Sir Joseph Porter made his first
entrance ho gazed upon him for a mo
ment as if doubting the evidence of his
senses and then muttered to himself
Bottovoce I m blest if that isnt old
Murray
Rising fronf his seat and making a
sea scrape ho called out Good day
your honor v The special officer was
going to eject him but the manager of
the house who had observed him for
bade it and told the officer to let the old
fellow enjoy himself to his hearts con
tent so long as he did not become so
boisterous as to disturb the performance
Whenever Sir Joseph came on or
went off the stage the old salt would
rise and honor him with a salute and
after the fall of the curtain he proposed
and gave three cheers for Admiral Mur
ray A naval lieutenant who was pres
ent subsequently told me that when the
old fellow went on board his skip next
day he had to bo put in irons for refus
ing to obey an order from his superior
officer unless that functionary would
follow the example of the gallant eap
tain of tho Pinafore and say If you
