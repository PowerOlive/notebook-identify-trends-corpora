Vaughn.Secretary Vaughn said that officials-who "do not qualify by the first Mon.uday in January cannot, under thelaw, qualify afterwards. Quite a-number, he said, have not been certified to the Secretary of State.There are more than 1,200 offl-cers to be commissioned by the Governor and the Secretary suggestshat all persons entitled to commissions and who have not receivedthem, inquire of the Sheriff of their-county whether the election board-liad forwarded the certificates ofselection.THE TARIFF""Wlnfield S. Hancock, a democraticcandidate for President forty years-ago, said the tariff is a local issue."This caused his defeat, although-many people have always thought3ie was right.But the tariff is not a local issue.A tariff duty on one industry mayaffect other "industries, and anotherIn the most unexpected way.The tariff law recently enacted-Imposes a duty on sugar. This wasdone for the benefit of Americanugar growers.But the imposition of the duty onisugar has angered the Cuban sugargrowers, and they are talking of re--tallation.They talk of boycottingAmerican goods wherever it is possible to do so, and already they arefiguring on British coal to supplantAmerican coal, which is almost attheir doors. They are offering toswap sugar for coal.The feeling may subside, and the-threatened boycott may neveramount to anything, but Americanoal miners will not relish having. xneir Dusmess ruined tnrougn aneffort to benefit American sugargrowers.All of which leads to the. remarkthat making a tariff law is an In-- trlcate undertaking, and that it isno wonder the attempts at it sooften end in failure.0 7"STATE PRESS ASSOCIATION ATLEXINGTON THURSDAY" The annual midwinter meeting of-tke Kentucky Press Association will"be held in Lexington, Thursday andffridv.

Renick. of Highstreet Mr. Smith is on the staff of"Zit's Weekly Newspaper" in NeWYork. "Zit's'V is one of the leadingtheatrical papers and is described as"the connecting link between thescreen, the stare and the Public."During the past year Mr. Smithsays he has had some varied experiences in doing theatrical reporting.He has met many well-known Broadway stars and has come to knowsome of them. He knows Ma'dameOlga Petrova, the famoUB motionpicture star and has been a guest inner Home on Long Island. MadamePetrova, Mr. Smith said, openedonly last night in a new nlav. "TheWhite Peacock," a dramatic play ofmoaern Spain. This is her return tothe speaking stage ttfter an execurslon in vaudeville and filmland.He has interviewed such stars asRaymond Iitchcock, when he was inthe Ziegfeld "Follies;" MarilynnMiller, the star -of "Sally," the musical comedy which is now in itssecond years "run; Louise Qroody,leading lady of "Good Morning,Dearie," the Dillingham musicalcomedy; Sophie Tucker, the famousvaudeville comedian; Mary RobertsRinehart, author of "The Bat."which is now in its second year, andother renowned persons in the theatrical world. Recently Mr. Smithwent to Sing Sing Prison for "Zit'sWeekly" to write-up the "Sing SingFollies of 1922,' a play "given byprisoners.Last summer he was sent to Blackwell's Island to review a monstervaudeville" entertainment givenfor the benefit of the Insane. He often goes to "first nights" as a critic.He also reviewed the "return" ofConway Tearle, the well-knownmovie star in "The Mad Dog," butthis, too, was a failure. Mr. Smithsaysthat Broadway producers havehad bad luck with plays this seasonand as a result of the numerous failures, they have brought back to lifesuch plays as "Alias Jimmy Valentine," "Bought and Paid For," "TheChocolate Soldier," and "The MerryWidow." The "tried and true" aremeeting with success again. Thisweek in New York, according to Mr.Smith, "Uncle Tom's Cabin" is being revived at a series of specialmatinees.W.

'37,000.00Horses in training 200,000.00Total $1,972,000.00Mr. E. F. Simms, successful oilman, Is giving Kentucky the benefitof his great fortune. The past yearhe has been collecting what mayprove to be the most valuable racingstud in America. Thousands ofacres of land have been purchasedby him near Paris, in Bourboncounty, and when his plans are completed he will have an ideal thoroughbred nursery which will sheltersome of the greatest horses theworld has produced. Not only hashe selected the choicest broodmaresin this country and in England andFrance, but he has purchased for thehead of his stud two wonderful siresthat are sure to bring success to hisestablishment and further add tothe glorious record of the Americanturf. Last year Mr. Simms ' purchased from the Due Decazes, PrincePalatine for $100,000. He is theson of the Derby winner Persimmon,himself a first-class race horse; isthe sire of Donnacona and PrincePal, and in his new environment issure to warrant the princely sumpaid for him. .Mr. Simms has also brought toXalapa Farm the famous FrenchDerby winner Negofol, which heowns jointly with the Due Decazes'.Negofol sired Imp. Hourless, champion three-year-old of America,1917; is also the sire of Tchad, winner of the French Derby, 1919, besides many other winners, and It iscertain that in Kentucky he willtake his place alongside of suchroyal studs as Fair Play, FriarRock and Man o' War. There ispromise of bright days for the American turf when such captains of industry as Mr. Simms invest millionsin the breeding of thoroughbreds,and it is fortunate that Kentuckyshould be chosen as the theatre forcarrying out his vast plans.S.
