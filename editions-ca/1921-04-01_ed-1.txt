Uncle Hiram lived inthe old days of which he writes, andought to know more about it than woyounger fellows of the press. UncleHiram writes, under the head of"Some Queer History.""Our usually correct friend Wm.Remington, of the Paris Democrat,nas certainly been imposed upon bysome one, for we find the item printed below as part of the notice of thedeath of our old and .esteemed friend,Nathan H. Bayless, who died lastweek at his home in Paris at theage of 86:"Mr. Bayless is said to have beenthe last person to buy a slave beforePresident Lincoln freed the negroesin 1865. Mr. Bayless was in Georgia selling horses and mules, andwhen a negro man was put up atauction he bought him for $1,500.The same day the negroes were freed7ut he paid for the man." -''Now, in fact, the negroes werefreed in 1863, not in 1865, and at.that time Mr. Bayless was not inGeorgia selling horses and mules, asUncle Sam would not permit Kentucky horse traders to furnish theSouth with horses and mules, atleast not to any great extent. Theonly way the South had to get Kentucky horses was to come after themas John Morgan and Pete Everettused to do.

Woman's suffragemovements have reached the DutchEast Indies, the colonies whose history and ancient savagery were chiefly known to credulous Americansthrough the agency of circus sidehhows, wherein the 'Wild Man ofBorneo" and "The Terrible Dyaks, Ferocious Head Hunting Cannibals,"drew many dimes while the crowdswaited for the "big tent" to open.Head hunting and kindred savagepastimes still continue, to some exs?nr, within the jungles of theseDutch islands, but, according to theDutch press, most of the natives arerapidly adopting modern theories.In Java, the upper class nativewomen, under leadership of Rade"hAdjeng Kartini, a woman ef highbirth, are reported to be making rapidstrides toward emancipation, although the Mohammedan custom ofpolygamy still prevails. In all the"Kartini schools" the girls of the upper classes are being taught Occidential theories of equality with themen.

Plans are now under discussion herej for linking up all partsof the world by passenger air routes,on which giant- dirigibles, flying twomiles above the surface at 60 miles anhour, will join London with . NorthAmerica, Australia, India and SouthAfrica. If these nlans are "carriedout air liners 800 feet long, equippedvith berths, dining rooms, smokingrooms, libraries and observation platforms, will speed from England toSan Francisco in four days, stoppingto discharge passengers and mails atNew York and Chicago. Each shipwill carry 100 passengers, and the farewill be only 50 per cent more thanpresent steamship rates. Ships capable of this service are now in commission, and a trial passenger flightwill be made to Egypt by a Britishgovernment airship to determine thefeasibility of opening such passengerroutes."The commercial airship -alreadyhas proved its success," said Sir Trevor Dawson of Vickers, Limited,when asked whether he thought theplan practicable. Vickers, Limited,is now building airships for the British government, and Sir Trevor is anexpert on the lighter-than-air craft."Day of Passenger Liner Here.""The success of the R-34 showedthe possibilities of , a transatlanticservice," he" continued. "It is now onlya question of building more and largerships and equipping suitable landingfield's, sheds and mooring stations onboth sides of the Atlantic. The airshiijs are speedy, safe and reliable.They can carry large cargoes, have awide cruising range, and can ride outalmost any weather."The day of the passenger air lineris here, and if the task of organizingair routes is undertaken by big financial interests it should be possible tobegin a regular passenger service overEurope within six -months with theships and bases already in existence.The American service would requiresomewhat larger ships and landingstations in North America. But itcould be In operation in less thanthree years. AVe need such a service,and I believe that it will come."The R-34 is the type of craft suggested for the proposed service, butthe contemplated ships, althouirlibuilt on the 11-34 lines, would be muchlarger and have .a far greater cruisingradius. It is said that a..rigid airshipcould be built that would be 1,100feet long, carrying 136 tons of freightor passengers, and having a maximumrange of 13,250 miles, cruising radiusMaitland Supports ProjectBrig. Gen. E. M. Maitland, whocommanded the R-34 in the transatlantic flight, is a believer in the planfor. world air routes."Even the existing airship of todaycan be regarded .as a reasonably safepublic conveyance," he says. "Theyalready have proved themselves capable of flying through practically anytype of weather, and the larger airships of the future, fitted with morepowerful machinery, necessarily willbe even safer. Fogs do not prove areal menace to airships, as with thepresent methods of navigation It itnot necessary to see the ground inflying between bases. It is true that atpresent the most, violent forms of elec;trie storms are an undoubted dangerto. -all forms of tLircrar,butat,tliemost this danger appears to be lestthan the danger of rocky coasts andshallows to the seagoing ship."Airships of this type of the R-38,which is now being built "at Bedford,or the German L-71, would be capableof flying from England to EgypJ, adistance of 2,200 miles, without a stopin two and one-half days. Theseships would carry about 80 passengers, with 100 pounds of baggage foreach passenger, and about two tonsof mail .and merchandise. . To put itanother way, 15 tons would be available for passengers, mails or mer;,chandise."Comfort In aerial travel is essential if it is to have any extended future. The advantage of speed 'isthrown away if the passenger 4sphysically or nervously exhausted onlanding. But ample accommodationscan be provided for day and nighttravel."Sleepers Are Provided.A proposed car has been designed byBeardmore, at Dalmui in which special attention -has been given .to theImportance of giving each passeuger agood view. The windows are s5 arranged that, passengers' can jsee bothoutward and vertically ? down wandshould they wish to do-so. The paysseii;gers sit facing eacn ouier wiui u uiuiebetween" them, rather like a large Pull-.man car. If. they "wish, tliey can ar-tasge the cnairs ana wuies iur unuge.,!- -.14 tw 4-l a. aIi a vaTfcieepers areT iitutiboi -i?c mumym xii 1.rail fipuium nbws,Wmmmmmmmmmmmand air will be admitted at the forwardend of the car, .where it Will be warmedwer radiators."One Is struck by the absence ofnoise or vibration in 'a large airship,and the absence of smoke or dirt is agreat asset. The complete .absence ofseasickness is also an important consideration." " tGraft of the- type described by Brigadier General Maitland already hayebeen used in Germany ont short passenger routed The Oerman Air Travelcompany, formed in 1910 and financedand managed by the Hamburg-AmerikaSteamship line, ran regular passengerexcursions and town to town servicesfrom 1910 to 1914. During this, periodthese airships made 800 flights, carrying 18,000 passengers without a singlemishap involving personal injury. Oneof the airships, the yittoria Louise,made 200 trips In 250 consecutive days.The company was able to make aprofit, although the passenger rateswere reasonable. Since the armistice,despite the, unsettled conditions inGermany, airships have been built fora special mail and passenger servicebetween Berlin, Munich and Switzerland. The first of these ships, the Bodensee, ran regularly from June toOctober last year, carrying 30 passengers a trip. It Is said that the Zeppelin company is now negotiating withAmerican interests forthe organization of anair. service from Spain tothe United States and South America, and is designing giant ships witha speed of 80 miles an hour forthis rub. The ships will carry 100passengers and their baggage, as wellas six or seven tons of mail.Valuable War Reserve Force.The knowledge of handling the lighter-than-aircraft greatly increasedduring the war. The ships were usedunder , all ' weather and atmosphericconditions and did valuable service asescort and convoy craft and also incombat against submarines. Smallrigids were used to locate andpursue the submarines and were ableto detect a U-boat far below the surface. The new ships, in addition totheir duticstisis passenger vessels, caneasily bo converted to purposes of warand will thus forih a valuable air reserve force.One ,of the developments recentlymade in airship landing stations is themooring mast, which enables the airship to come to the ground and bemoored even during bad weather. Themast is a tall .structure, with a swivelmooring device at the top, from whichthe airship swings. .Plans are now being prepared for amooring tower especially arranged foru&e with passenger-carrying airships.The revolving head of the mast will beprovided with a powerful winch forhauling in and a shock absorbing bufferwill enable the ship to be coupled upwithout difficulty even in winds up to80 miles an hour. Within the mastthere will be a passenger elevator bywhich the passengers will ascend to anupper platform, where theyvlll crossa gangway and enter the ship.Pipe lines to carry hydrogen, gasoline and water to the ship also will berun up the mast, and the vessel cantlui& refuel at her moprings.Inventions Increase Safety.Many war discoveries aid in increasing the safety of airship travel. Thewireless direction finder makes it possible for the ship to find her locationat all times and so navigate successfully in fogs. The increasing rangeand sources of information of themeteorological service aids in givingweather forecasts that will warnalrcraft of approaching storms, which canbe avoided by a change of course.Laboratory investigations are nowbeing made of the nature of the particles of moisture that forms fogs, andit is hoped that some way will befound of dispersing fog, so that a localclear area may be maintafned aboutthe landing places. All landing placesare markedwith brilliant electric beacons and lighthouses are being erectedto guide night flying ships along aerialrentes.Airships are even now a safe formof travel. When rain, high winds or..electric storms approach they can seekthe higher air levels and so avoid danger. The risks from fire have beentreduced to a minimum,, and the danger of engine trouble, ever present inthe airplane, is nnlllfled by the factthat repairs always can be made without descending. Rigid airships neverhave less than four engines, and it Isimprobable that all engines will breakdown at one time. Even if half theengines -broke down the ship couldtravel at four-fifths of her normalspeed.Public Demands Speed.The airship has the advantage over, both the airplane and the steamship asa passenger craft The airplane canonly travel 300 miles without stoppingat a base for fuel and is thus impracticable for long distance routes. It is,furthermore, of limited carrying capacity, and the disagreeable featuresof noise and vibration cannot be doneaway with. The great rigid, movingsteadily day and night and hav-,'ing a cruising radius of 2,000 to3.000 miles, makes a far better passenger ship. It has been suggested thatail-plane routes could be used as feeders to the airship lines, small airplanescarrying passengers to a central point,whence they could embark on the airships of transoceanic and transcontinental lines. ' ,When the lines are established thesteamships also will find them seriouscompetitors. The airshin is infinitely'quicker and does not have the pitch"anu- tess tnat tmaKes steamer travel' unpleasant .JThe demand for; Jgreat,J'-,ftfttfir' Jine'epeet'lfcTHs BOURBON NBW& PAM vmr fc. 5 - -r-. - .-.,.

They are the twogi'eat continents, the continents thathave between them a steady flow ofpassenger travel. Air travel mustcome, cutting down the time distancebetween countries, and thus strengthening the ties of business, trade andinternational understanding.
