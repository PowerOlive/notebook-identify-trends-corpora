Sunday afternoon sent outa dispatch saying it is stated that Commodore Dewey has defeated the Spanish fleet It adds that the Spaniardslost 2000 men and that CommodoreDewey lost two ships and 500

burning-and sinking ships The captain of theReina Christina went down with thevesselLondon May 2 While it is quiteclear that the Spanish squadron hassuffered a crushing defeat at Manilathe dispatches leave unclear the intensely interesting question whetherthe American squadron has sufferedmaterial damage-All news thus far comes from Spanish sources but it seems evident thatCommodore Dewey has not capturedManila Unless he is able to make an-other attack and capture the town hewill be in an awkward position havingno base upon which to retire and refitProbably therefore the UnitedStates squadron will be obliged tomake for San Francisco as the entrance to Manila bay was heavilymined with torpedoesCommodore Dewey displayed greatpluck and daring- in making- for theinner harborWashington May -2

eveningThe first battle of theican war has been fought and victorylies with Adm Deweys squadron under the stars and stripesThat was enough to set the peopleof Washington almost in airenzy

decisive con-trTHE BOUKBON NEWS PARIS XY TUESDAY MAY 3 1898flict of the war When the news came jindicating a great victory for theAmerican squadron the enthusiasm ofthe people was let loose and thestreets of the city have rung withcheers throughout the night Thefirst news of the battle received inWashington came in a brief cablegramfrom Madrid about eight oclockSunday evening As night woreon the cable continued to singthe news of victory for the squadronof Adm Dewey and the interest grewinto tremendous excitementOrdinarily Washington is the quietest of cities on Sunday but as bulletinafter bulletin was posted in front ofthe newspaper offices each successiveone conveying information more gratifying than its predecessor the crowdsin the streets became uproariousGood as well as bad news spreads rapidly and by ten oclock the streetswere crowded with people all discussing the one exciting topic of the hourHundreds gathered in front of thebulletin boards and every scintillaof news and it was all glorious wasreceived with enthusiastic cheersWhile victory had been expected thenews of it coming as it did come fromSpanish sources gave vent to thepatriotism ofthe people which hadbeen pent up for days It was aspontaneous outburst of patrioticfeeling that scarcely knew boundsAdm Deweys name was on every lipand his praises were sung in the rejoicings of the peopleThus far no official advices havebeen received by the government Thepresident in company with several ofhis advisers read the bulletins in thelibrary of the white house early inthe evening but later in the night hewent to his office on the second floorof the executive mansion where untila late hour he continued to peruseevery dispatch with deepest interestThe news was evidently of the mostgratifying character to him but nostatement could be obtained at the executive mansion concerning the battleor its possible consequencesOfficials of the navy department werereticent in discussing the conflict inthe absence of official informationbut they made no pretense of concealing-their great gratification Secretary Long- declined to comment uponthe subject but it was evident that hefelt relieved It has been known fordays at the navy department that aconflict at Manila was inevitable andwhile no great fear of the resultwas expressed there was yet a deepconcern in the heart of every officialSunday nights news removes a greatweight from the minds of allWhen Secretary Bliss was shown thefirst dispatch briefly recounting thevictory of the American squadron heunhesitatingly expressed his gratification at the result and gave utteranceto the hope that Adm Deweys fleethad not suffered - greatly SenatorHanna and Mr Chauncey M Depewof - New York who were with Secretary Uliss at the time were -delightedwith the advices and made no concealment of their pleasureSecretary Alger declared that It wasa glorious- victory but in commonwith other officials of the administration declined to make extended comment upon itNavy and army circles after manifesting throughout the day the greatest eagerness for news from the Philippines received with intense joy theadvices telling of the victory of AdmDeweys fleet Their satisfaction thatthe defeat of the Spanish had beenoverwhelming was strengthened byreason of the news coming first almostwholly from Madrid and they werequickly unreserved in expressing- theirgratification upon the signal triumphof the American forcesAt the Army and Navyclub a largecompany was gathered and read andcommented upon the story of the engagements as it was presented in thebulletins at the club Down town attheir homes and wherever seen the officers were free in giving- vent to thepleasure tliey felt at the news and declaring the confidence which they hadentertained throughout that the American ships their officers and men woulddemonstrate their superiority over theSpanish fleet in Philippine watersThe absence of any statementof specific injury to the American vessels in the Madrid advices was construed as convincing indication thatthey had not suffered appreciable injury and this was especially pleasingto the naval students of the news Notonly was the preservation of theAmerican ships and men considered initself a happy outcome but it wascommented upon as indicating clearlythat Adm Dewey and his associate officers and the men under their command had discharged splendidly theirseveral duties in directing and executing the fight In this connectionit was pointed out as little less thanmarvelous that the American squadronescaped without severe injuiw becausenotwithstanding the disparity in thenaval forces the Spanish fleet assistedby the shore batteries should havebeen able to inflict severe damage toits foe before itself being destroyedIts failure to do so was explicable onlyupon the hypothesis of perfect andswift work by the Americans Anopinion freely expressed Sunday nightby naval officers is that the very decisive victory of Adm Deweys fleetwill mean probably an early end tothe war without further naval battlesof importance The American fleet it issuggested is now supreme in the waters of Spains Pacific possession and indications were strongly towards theslipping of the Philippines from hercontrol It was said that only byquickly yielding to our demands inCuba could this loss possibly be averted Spain it was argued was confronted with a situation which promised naught save disaster in case sheelected to force more fighting- Thesuperiority of a superior fleet has beendemonstrated in the Pacific and thesame it is contended would be inevitable in the Atlantic in case the clashcomes From whatever point ofview considered the -policy of morefighting upon the part of Spainpromises nothing- but more Spanishmisfortune Navy officers think thisI - - -view must prevail with the Spanishgovernment and believe any end of thewar upon the basis of Cuban independence is to follow soon and that toowithout further notable opportunityfor the American navy to prove itspower and distinguish itselfJudge McComas senator elect fromMaryland after expressing his joyover the result of the conflict struck akey note of the expected result of thecannonading at Manila Sunday whenhe said that it was likely to have atremendous effect not only in Spainbut throughout Europe He expressedthe belief that it would turn the tideof Europen sentiment toward theUnited StatesThe idea advanced br Judge McComas was expressed by others Sunday night It is regarded by some aslikely that the decisive victory gainedby Adm Deweys squadron may openthe eyes of Spain to the seriousness ofthe conflict upon which she has entered In official circles it is regardedas almost certain that trouble of amost critical kind will confrontthe Sagasta government within Spainsown borders It is pointed out thatthe Spanish people have been led tobelieve that their navy was invincibleand the bitter disappointment thatwill ensue over the result of the firstengagement of the war is likely toprecipitate internal dissentionsif hota revolutionAnother result of Adm Deweysvictory it is thought may be action onthe part of the powers of Europe toinduce Spain to abandon what is regarded as a hopeless contest for herRepresentations may be made to Spainthat she would better relinguish her hold upon Cubathan to risk losing all herWest Indian possessions and the Philippines as well It is believed to benot unlikely that the representationswill indicate that since Spanish honorhas been satisfied by a conflict Spaincan now yield to the inevitable and accept the good offices of the powers tobring about an adjustmentIn the dispatches from Madrid thestatement was made that Adm Deweyeffeeted a landing on the west side ofManila bay for the men of his fleetwho were wounded in the engagements It was asserted in official circles that this landing had a two foldpurpose It was not only that thewounded might have better care thanthey could receive on shipboard inthe face of other probable engagements but also to carry out whatwas known to be Adm Deweys purpose to effect a junction with the insurgents as soon as possible The insurgent forces practically surroundManila on the land sides of the cityand with the intention of securingcontrol of Manila as soon as possibleAdm Dewey was to obtain a footing on the island at the earliestpracticable moment As soon asthe junction of American and insurgent forces the one on sea and theother on land is effected a demand islikely to be made for the surrender ofthe city and in the event of refusala combined attack would be made uponit The result of- such an attack inin the abscence of a Spanish fleet andeffective shore batteries seems a foregone conclusionNo news of a definite character isgiven concerning- the loss sustained byAdm Deweys squadron and it isscarcely likely in the opinion ofexperts of the navy that authenthic information will be received until Adm Dewey has opportunity to communicate officiallywith the department It is regardedas probable that immediately after theengagements of Sunday Adm Deweysent the revenue cutter McCullochback to Hong Kong- with dispatchesand that the first information fromhim will come from that pointThe distance from Manila to HongKong is a trifle over GOO miles and itwill take the McCulloch about twodays to make the tripTHE TOPEKAFormerly the Diogenes Which SailedFromFalmouth Eng April 19 Arrives Safelyat New YorkNew York May 2 The UnitedStates cruiser Topeka formerly theDiogenes

energetic Americansaided by the insurgents could easilydefeat the Spaniards who since theirentrance into Cuba had done no hardfig hting and had been reduced by sickness until their fighting strength wassuch that they could not stand punishment such as he hoped to be able togive them It was reported after theconference that an order would beissued Friday -to the commanders oftroops notifying them

face The pressure ofthe lips to hold the pipe in position increases the curvature of the lips roundthe stem and the muscles become morerigid here than in other parts Thusthe lips at certain points becomestronger and the pipe is unconsciouslyheld in the same habitual positionAfter long continuation of the habitsmall circular wrinkles form parallelwith the curvature of the lips aroundthe stem These are crossed by finerlines caused by the pressure of the lipsto retain the stem in positionIn the caiie of old men who havesmoked a pipe for years the effect uponthe lips is very marked not only altering the form of the lips but of one entire side of the face causing thewrinkles that are the result of age todeepen and instead of following thenatural course of facial wrinkles tochange their course so as to radiatefrom the part of the month where thepipe is habitually carried Furthermore one or both lips often protrudejust like the lips of people who used tosuck their thumbs when children Theeffects of pipe smoking upon the teethand lower jaws are even more apparentthan in the case of the lips If any manwho has smoked a pipe for a considerable length of time will take the troubleto

Admiral Benbow Inn and thebrown old seaman with the saber cutfirst took up his lodgings under ourroofI remember him as if it was yesterdaj as he came plodding to the inndoor his sea chest following behindhim in a hand barrow a tall strongheavy nut brown man his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulders of hissoiled blue coat his hands ragged andscarred with black broken nails andthe saber cut across one cheek a dirtylivid white I remember him lookinground the cove and whistling to himself as he did so and then breaking outin that old sea song that he sung sooften afterwardFifteen men on the dead mans chestYo-ho-ho and a bottle of rumin the high old tottering voice thatseemed to have been tuned and brokenat the capstan bars Then he rappedon the door with a bit of of stick like ahandspike that he carried and whenmy father appeared called roughly fora glass of rum This when it wasbrought to him he drank slowly like aconnoisseur lingering on the tasteand still looking about him at the cliffsand up at our signboardThis is a handy cove says he atlength and a pleasant sittyatedgrog shop Much company mateMy father told him no verj littlecompany the more was the pityWell then said he this is theberth for me Here you matey hecried to the man who trundled the barrow bring up alongside and help upmy chest Ill stay here a bit he continued Im a plain man rum andbacon and eggs is what I want andthat head up there for to watch shipsoff What you mought call me Youmought call rne captain Oh I seewhat youre at there and he threwdown three or four gold pieces on thethreshold Yon can tell me when Iveworked through that says he lookingas fierce as a commanderAnd indeed bad as his clothes wereand coaTsely as he spoke he had noneof the appearances of a man who sailedbefore the mast but seemed like amate or skipper accustomed to beobeyed or to strike The man whocame with the barrow told us the mailhad set him down the morning beforeat the Roj al George that he had inquired what inns there were along thecoast and hearing ours well spoken ofI suppose and described as lonely hadchosen it from the others for his placeof residence And that was all weould learn of Qur guestHe was a very silent man by customAll day he hung round the cove or upon the cliffs with a brass telescopeall evening he sat in a corner of the parlor next the fire and drank rum andwater very strong Mostly he wouldnot speak when spoken to only lookup suddenly and fierce and blowthrough his nose like a fog horn andwe and the people who came about ourhouse scon learned to let him beEvery day wrhen he came back fromhis stroll he would ask if any seafaringmen had gone by along the road Atfirst we thought it was the want ofcompany of his kind that made himask this qcstion but at last we beganto see he was desirous to avoidthem When a seaman put up at theAdmiral Benbow as now andthen some did making by the coastroad for Bristol he would look at himthrough the curtained door before heentered the parlor and he was alwayssure to be as silent as a mouse whenany such was present For rno atleast there was no secret about thematter for I was in a way a sharer inhis alarmsHe had taken me aside one day andpromised me a silver fourpenny on thefirst of every month if I would onlykeep my weather-eye-open for a seafaring manwith one leg and let himknow the moment he appeared OftenenoughAvhen the first of the monthcame round and I applied to him forTny wage he wouldonly blow throughhis nose at me and stare me down butbefore the weekwas cut he was sure tothink better of it bring nifc my fourpenny piece and repeat his orders tolook out for the seafaring man withone legHow that personage haunted myireams I need scarcely tell you Onstormy nights when the wind shookfhe four corners of the -house and thesurf roared along the cove and up thecliffs I would see him in a thousandforms and -with a thousand diabolicalexpressions Xow the leg would be cutoff at the knee now at the hip now hewas a monstrous Lind of a creaturewho had- never had but the one legand that in the middle of his body Tosee him leap and run and pursue me-over hedge and ditch was theworst ofAncVr altogether -I paidpreitr dear for my monthly fourpennypiece in the shape of these abominablefanciesBut though JMvas so terrified by theidea of the seafaring man with one legI was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybodyelse who knew himThere were nights when he took a dealmore rum and water than his headwould carry and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked old wildsea songs minding nobody but sometimes he would call for glasses roundand force all the trembling company tolisten to his stories or bear a chorusto his singing Often I have heard thehouse shaking with Yo-ho-ho and abottle of rum all the neighbors joining in for dar life with the fear ofdeath upon them and each singinglouder than the other to avoid remarkFor in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known hewould slap his hand on the table for silence all round he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question or sometimes because none was put and so hejudged the company was not followinghis story Nor would he allow anyoneto leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bedHis stories were what frightened people worst of all Dreadful stories thewere about hanging and walking theplank and storms at sea and the DryTortugas and wild deeds and places onthe Spanish main By his own accounthe must have lived his life among someof the wickedest men that God ever allowed upon the sea and the languagein which he told these stories shockedour plain country people almost asmuch as the crimes that he describedMy father was always saying the innwould be ruined for people would sooncease coming there to be tyrannizedover and put down and sent shiveringto their beds but I really believe hispresence did us good People werefrightened at the time but on lookingback thej rather liked it it was a fineexcitement in a quiet country life andthere was even a party of the youngermen who pretended to admire him calling him a true sea dog and a realold salt and such like names and saing there was the sort of man thatmade England terrible at seaIn one way indeed he bade fair toruin us for he kept on staying weekafter week and at last month aftermonth so that all the money had beenlong exhausted and still my fathernever plucked up the heart to insist onhaving more If ever he mentioned itjthe captain blew through his nose soloudly that you might he roaredand stared my poor father out of theroom I have seen him wringing hishands -after such a rebuff and I am surethe annoyance and the terror he livedin must have greatlj hastened his earland unhappj deathAll the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in hisdress but to buy some stockings froma hawker One of the cocks of his hathaving fallen down helet it hang fromthat day forth though it was a greatannoyance when it blew I rememberthe appearance of his coat which hepatched himself upstairs in his roomand which before the end was nothingbut patches He never wrote or received a letter and he never spoke withany but the neighbors and with thesefor the most part only when drunk onrum The great sea chest none of ushad ever seen openne was only once crossed and that wastoward the end when my poor fatherwas far gone in a decline that took himoff Dr Livesey came late one afternoon to see the patient took a bit ofdinner from my mother and went intothe parlor to smoke a pip until hishorse should come down from the hamlet for we had no stabling at the oldBenbow I followed him in and I remember observing the contrast theneat bright doctor with his powder aswhite as snow and his bright blackeyes and pleasant manners made withthe coltish country folk and above allwith that filthy heavy bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours sitt Jng far gonein rum with his arms on the table Suddenly he the captain that is beganto pipe up his eternal songFifteen men on the dead mans chestYo-ho-ho and a bottle of rumDrink and the devil had done for the restYo-ho-ho and a bottle of rumAt first I had supposed the deadmans chest to be that identical bijibox of his upstairs in the front roomand the thought had been mingled inmy nightmares with that of the onelegged seafaring man But by this timewe had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song it was newthat night to nobody but Dr Liveseyand on him I observed that it did notproduce an agreeable effect for helooked up for a moment quite angrilybefore he went oh with his talk to oldTaylor the gardener on a new cure forrheumatics In the meantime the captain gradually brightened up at hisown music and at last flapped his handupon the table before him in a way weall knew to mean silence The voicesstopped at once all but Dr Livcseyshe went on as before speaking clearand kind and drawing briskly at hspipe between every word or two Thecaptain glared at him for awhileflapped his hand again glared stillharder and at last broke out with awvillainous low path Silence therebetween decksWere you addressing me sir saysthe doctor and when the jrunfan hadtbldhiin with anoiVv oath that thiswas so have only one thing to say toyou sir replies the doctor that ifyou keep on drinking rum the worldwill soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrelThe old fellows fury was awful Hesprung to his feet drew and opened asailors clasp knife and balancing itopen on the palm of his hand threatened 0 pin the doctor to the wallThe doctor never so much as movedHe spoke to him as before over hisshoulder and in the same tone of voicerather high so that all the roommight hear but perfectly calm andsteadyIf you dont put that knife this instant into your pocket I promise uponmy honor you shall hang at the nextassizesThen followed a battle of looks between them but the captain soonknuckled under put up his weapon andresumed his seat grumbling like a beaten dogAnd now sir continued the doctorsince I know theres such a fellow inmy district you may count Ill have aneye on you day and night Im not adoctor only Im a magistrate and if Icatch a breath of complaint againstyou if its only for a piece of incivilitylike to night Ill take effectual meansto have you hunted down and routedout of this Let that sufficeSoon after Dr Liveseys horse cameto the door and he rode away but thecaptain held his peace that evening andfor many evenings to comeCHAPTER IIBLACK DOG APPEARS AND DISAPPEARSIt was not long after this that thereoccurred the first of the mysteriousevents that rid us at last of the captainthough not as you will see of his affairs It was a bitter cold winter withlong hard frosts and heavy gales andit was plain from the first that my poorfather was little likely to see thespring He sunk daily and my motherand J had all the inn upon our handsand were kept busy enough withoutpaying much regard to our unpleasantguestIt was one January morning veryearly a pinnhing froisty morningthe cove all gray with hoar frost theripple lapping softly on the stones thesun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to seaward Thecaptain had risen earlier than usualand set out down the beach his cutlassswinging under the broad skirts ofthe old blue coat his brass telescopeunder his arm his hat tilted back uponhis head I remember his breath hanging like smoke in his -wake as he strodeoff and the last sound I heard of himas he turned the big rock was a loudsnort of indignation asthoughhismind was still running upon Dr LiveseyWell mother was upstairs with father and I was laying the breakfastHe -would look In at him through the curtaineddoortable against the captains returnwhen the parlor door opened and aman stepped in on whom I had neverset my eyes before He was a pale tallowy creature wanting two fingers onthe left hand and though he wore acutlass he did not look much like afighter I had always my eyes openfor seafaring men with one leg or twoand I remember this one puzzled meHe was not sailorly and 3 et he had asmack of the sea about him tooT asked him what was for his serviceand he said he would take rumbut as I was going out of the room tofetch it he sat down upon a table andmotioned to me to draw near I pausedwhere I was with my napkin in myhandCome here sonny says he Comenearer hereI took a step nearerIs this here table for my mateBill he asked with a kind of leerI told him I did not know his mateBill and this was for a person whostaved in our house whom we calledthe captainWell said he my mate Bill wouldbe called the captain as like as not Hehas a cut on one cheek and a mightypleasant way with him particularly indrink has my mate Bill Well put itfor argument like that your captainhas a cut on one cheek and well putit if vou like that that cheeks theright one Ah well I told youXow is my mate Bill in this herehouseT told him he was out walkingWhich -way sonny Which way ishe goneAnd when had pointed outtherockand told him how the captain was likely to return and how soon and answered a few other questions Ahsaid he thisll be as good as djrinlctrimy mate BillThe expression of his face ashe saidthejSb wbrds4wjaan0t at alPpieasanFv-and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was mistakeneven supposing he mean what he saidBut it was no affair of mine IthHightand besides it was difficult to knowwhat to do The stranger kept hanging about just inside the inner doorpeering around the corner like a catwaiting for a mouse Oncel stepped outmyself into the road buthe immediately called me back and as I did not obeyquick enough for his fancy a most horrible change came over his tallowyface and he ordered me in with anoath that made me jumpAs soon as I was back again he returned to his former manner halffawning half sneering patted me onthe shoulder told me I was a good boyand he had taken quite a fancy to me1 have a son of my own said he aslike you as two blocks and hes all thepride of my art But the great thingfor bpys is discipline sonny discipline Now if you had sailed along ofBill you wouldnt have stood there tobe spoke to twice not you That wasnever Bills wa nor the way of such assailed with him And here sureenough is my mate Bill with a spyglass under his arm bless his old artto be sure You and mell just go backinto the parlor sonny and get behindthe door and well give Bill a little surprise bless his art I say agaiiiSo saying the stranger backed alongwith me into the parlor and put me behind him in the corner so that we wereboth hidden by the open door I wasvery uneasy and alarmed as you mayfancy and it rather added to my fearsto observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself He clearedthe hilt of his cutlass and loosened theblade in the sheath and all the timewe were kept waiting there Jae keptswallowing as if he felt what we usedto call a lump in the throatTO BE CONTINUEDTHE CANNY SCOTSome Examples of His tnconslousII n 111 orOn his first visit to Aberdeen an English commercial traveler having received some marks of kindness fromone of

Itnilrontl Oflicinl Has Trouble-- with the Rapacious Rodentsfor a TimeThe private car of a Burlington railway official with headquarters in thiscity has been infested for nearly ayear with a brood of rats It is notknown haw the vermin gainsd a foothold in the aristocratic vehicle butthey evidently became tired of the fareon the freight trains and picked out theprivate car as a good graft It is notmusual for rats or mice to get intodining and sleeping cars on railwayslut this is the first instance on theBurlington at least that they have madetheir appearance within the sacred precincts of a private carIt was during a trip in the west lastsummer that their presence was firstnoticed but little attention was paid tothem as it was thought that they wouldstay but a short time They were firstnoticed by their appearance in thekitchen where they seemed to like thework of the private cook Becomingbolder they invaded the remainder ofthe car Poison and traps were set forthem but they were rats of experiencewho knew the look and taste of therough and who were too wary to venture inside the trap even when- it wasbaited with imported cheese They continued to live on the fat of the car andto make it very unpleasant for the occupants The latter would awake in thenight to feel four little feet runningover the coverlids or to hear the gnawing of sharp little teeth eatdngaway thewoodwork of the ear For awhile theofficials carried rat terriers en histrips but the dogs never got a rat andthe official and his employes were in despairOn one occasion when five owner ofthe car had out with him one of his superiors and some members of the latters family the ladies were madehysterical by the presence of the ratsand had to abandon the trip and returnon- a regular train Finally the rats became so bad that the car was put in theshops and a nori side rat catcher wassent for lie brought both dogs andferrets which were used to working together in exterminating rats In everynook and corner where rats can go thesharp scented ferrets found their wayand it looked as though the rats wouldbaffle them after allThe car is provided with a doublefloor and it was decided that this wasthe only place where the ratscouid haveconcealed themselves But there wasro hole big enough for the ferrets entrance so a portion of the flooring wasmt out The ferrets were- let in and ina moment
