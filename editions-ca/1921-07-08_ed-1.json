ONE-ARMED MUSICIAN
Spectators on the streets Wednes
day were treated to a novel sight as
they wandered along, that of a one
armed mu&ician, who manipulated
several musical instruments at the
same time with apparent ease. Wm.
H. Fultz, globe-trotter and world
traveler, was the man who' attracted
the attention of passers-by by his
performances, t
Fultz played a violin, a French
harp and autoharp, all at the same
jtime, the latter instrument being
played by means of a wire attached
to the toe of his shoe. He rendered
the latest popular and classical
music in a manner, that would have
been creditable to a more fortunate
person, in a physical way.
Fultz was the personification of
good nature and said that a man
need not necessarily be handicapped,
by the absence of one Timb. He
makes his way readily through the
world by his own efforts and seems
proud of his independence. He can
use a typewriter with equal ease as
he does his musical instruments, as
was evidenced by an exhibition he
gave in the office of the Paris Com
mercial Club.
Miss Edith Spegal was a guest
Tuesday af teroon of Mrs. Edgar Boaz.
Mr. Robert Bell, who has been

Mr. William Ledford, of Carlisle,
has returned to his home after a visit
to Mr. Nathan Linville. ;
Mrs. Dotson, of Lexington, is
the guest of her daughter and son,
Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Craycraft. '
Misses Melissa Humphries and
Lillie Mae Smart have returned to
their homes from a visit to Mrs.
Nathan Linville. J
Miss Melissa Humphries has re-1
turned to her home after a brief visit I
to her cousin, Miss Elizabeth McFar
land, near Centerville.
Mr. and Mrs. Jesse Smith and
family Miss Elsie Smith and Mr. Wm.
Smart were recent visitors in Lexing
ton, where they visited Blue Grass
Park.
While working with a gang of
horses and hands on the farm Satur
day afternoon, Paul Rice, of this vi
cinity, was thrown from a wagon,
when his mules became frightened
and ran away. His right leg was
fractured. He was taken immediately
to a Lexington hospital, where medi
cal aid was given him. He was re
ported yesterday as resting comfortably.
