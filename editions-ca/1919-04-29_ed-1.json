CAN IT
BE TRUE THAT THIS
HAPPENED?
Governor Smith", of New York-,,
signed the bills authorizing Sunday
baseball and moving shows. H
said, in referring to harmless amuse
ments, that the ministry who opposed
all recreation on Sunday, had no
right to impose their 'will on the ma
jority who disagree with them.
This stands out in strong contrast
to the action of a group of Eastern
ministers who protested to Secretary
Glass against band concerts and the
exhibition, on Sunday of "The Price
of Peace" in the Victory Loan Cam
paign. o
A" man can get his clothes made to
fit his form by going to a good tailor.
But a woman can get her form made
to fit her clothes by going to a good-
dressmaker.
Some people fiddle their'time away'
continually blowing their own horns.
