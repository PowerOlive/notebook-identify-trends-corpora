both of this county. .
A marriage license wa's issued

CORNISH CLARK.
The following beautifully-engraved
announcement cards have
been received here by friends and rel
atives of bride and groo(m:
"Mrs. Margaret Demaree Maddox
announces the marriage of their
niece, Mary Armyl Cornish, to Mr.
William Preston Clark, on Monday,
June the twenty-fourth, nineteen
hundred and eighteen, Nicholasville,
Kentucky."
"At Home after August first, Ep
worth, Kentucky."
The bride is a most charming
young woman, a graduate of the class
of 1913 at the Bourbon College, in
this city. She has frequently visited
Paris friends, especially at the home
of Mr. and Mrs. Calvert. The groom
is a successful young farmer and
trader, and is a nephew of Mrs. J. V.
Lytle, of Paris.
BROWN RICE.
Although the knowing ones slyly
intimated that they "knew it was
going to happen soon," the an;
nouncement of the engagement of
Miss Elizabeth Brown, daughter of
Dr. J. T. Brown, and Rev. J. J. Rice,
pastor of the Paris Presbyterian
church, yet has about enough of the
savor of a fresh news item to warrant
THE NEWS in saying it is a fact,
and that the happy event will take
place in this city some time in the
co,ming months.
Miss Brown is one of the social
favorites of Paris, a young woman
possessed of graces of character that
will make her an ideal helpmeet.
She is the possessor of physical
beauty that appeals, and has a
charming manner that has made her
a host of friends.
Rev. Rice is one of the most pop
ular young ministers who has yet
filled the pastorate for the congrega
tion of the local church. He became
an instant favorite with Paris peo
ple, and his hold on their affections
grows stronger with the passing of
days. He is an eloquent and forceful
pulpit orator, and a man whom it is
a pleasure to know!
THE NEWS extends congratula
tions this far in advance of the event,
and wishes for Rev. Rice and his
handsome bride-tohe all the joys that
come to those who plight their troth
for 'better or worse.
I. 0. 0. F.-AUXniAUIES ELECT

7 at their recent meeting:
Noble Grand, Mrs. Nannie Rose;

night the new officers recently elect

of the various committees were also

JULY C0TJHT DAY.
As a matter of course, there was
but a small crowd in the city yester
day attending the monthly "court
day. The busy season and the pros
pect of facing collectors of July ac
counts possibly kept the greater part
of the farmers at home. But what
ever the reason, there was little -doing
on the market.
Merchants report collections slow,
Jbut considerable business transacted
by shoppers. There was but little
- '
stock on the market, and a few
horses and mules changed hands at
fair prices. The usual court day ac
complishments of the blind violinists,
beggars, etc., filled in the gaps in an
otherwise colorless "court day" in
Paris.

WEATHER MAN'S GUESS FOR
WEEK JULY 1-6.
Weather predictions for the week
begnning Monday, issued by the
Weather Bureau, are:
"Ohio Valley and Tennessee:
Showers first of the week and again
about the end of week. Normal tem
perature." Heavy showers fell Sunday morn
ing and evening, cooling the super
heated atmosphere, and adding an
inch an hour to the growth of veg
etation, already hustling topward un
der the stimulation of the hot sun
shine and former rains. The heavy
rains with hail reported from some
localities, sent the mercury in ther
mometers down several degrees, and
a cool wind made Sunday night and
yesterday just a little bit uncomfort
able for wearers of "ice cream suits,"
but pleasing to those who suffer from
high, temperature.
