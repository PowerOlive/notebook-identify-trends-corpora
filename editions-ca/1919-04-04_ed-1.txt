How a business romance, blossoming in the bosom ofMother Earth, led the way to a dreamof affluence that is fast materializing,is brought out in the organization hereof the Louisville Lead & Zinc Syndicate Company, a corporation the stockit which rapidly is becoming the property of the public. That it is not aromance of the oil fields will be a matter of surprise to those who look largely to the oil well as the fountain ofbusiness romance.Formation of the Louisville Mansfield Lead & Zinc Syndicate follows,closely upon organization of the Kentucky Mansfield Lead & Zinc Syndleate, a corporation already on an operating and diWdend-paying basis, butthe romance goes back eleven yearsbo the oil fields of the west and to adentist's chair in a small Oklahomatown.Dr. T. T.

He. is Dr.T. T.

Hesaw men carried up into the realm ofsudden riches; he saw hopes fulfilledbeyond their own limits. But he sawtbe other side, too, of the oil gameIts uncertainty, and the ruin "that thisuncertainty brought to some.One day Dr. Beeler heard about thestrike made in the famous JopIIn zincore district He began studying thpossibilities of the new found, opportunity. He reflected that In the oilbusiness, when a well was drilled, nomortal could with certainty tell whichof four things would be the resultoil, water, gas or a hole In the ground.He reflected that an oil well, drilledfrom 1,100 to 3,300 feet in the ground,cost from $5,000 to $30,000 before itireal promise was known. And thenhe compared this with data he hadgathered' about the mining industry, inwhich nature's store of wealth liescomparatively close to the surface audcovers great areas, necessitating, mproportion, a small initial outlay. Heapplied this comparison particularly towhat he had heard about the JoplinMansfield fields.Dr. Beeler was not long In makingup his mind. It was two years ago inKansas City that the project, which isnow being carried to every state inthe Union, had its inception. Dr.Beeler had selected a partner, severedhis connections with the oil fields, andhad employed an agent, Wrsed in thetechnique of such an undertaking, toinvestigate opportunities in the JopliudistrictBut it was by chance that the realopportunity was found. One day,when Dr. Beeler's emissary was fruitlessly bickering with people In thefield to which prospectors were already swarming, an old man calledhim aside."If you want to see an unworked locality, I want to show you something,"said the old man.As the result of the investigationand assaying which followed, Dr. Beeler, his partner and several notaries,In all 'of the public -automobiles thenearby town afforded, set oat in thelate afternoon in what is now theMansfield district. The chauffeurs andthe notaries and all others with whomthe party came in contact were boundto secrecy. There were neither automobiles nor notaries available for other possible prospectors.That was October 16, 1917. In a dayor so, the prospectors had securedleases on 18.000 acres of land rich inore, and had laid the foundation oftheproject which is now becoming na-WmuJCX'JaauuaaaaaW i v f mMix.jij' 'IHeed the WarningOf Authority!?Make Your DollarsHave More Cents "riBtofffi Mansfield Lead Zinc C, In,m Stark Building, LotdsvUle, Ky.I mm interested in your proposition mplod to make an investigation withoutKindly end me eopimtlon-wide.

Unlike the merepromise of an oil well, the potentialities of a zinc' field could be scientifically established. Their reports weresecured from A.

According to this theory,Mansfield, one of the. highest points inthe district, is the site of a pre-historic, volcano. The purest ore is found closest to this center, while the adulterated deposits are found as the distancebecomes greater.Once he had secured rights to theland, Dr. Beeler's plan became knownand soon the district was a bee hiveof -fortune-hunters. But all of thepromising land in the vicinity hadbeen leased by Dr. Beeler and his associates and they were ready to launchtheir project.Their scheme of operation calls ultimately for the organization of localcomDauies in each of the forty-fivestates. Each of these corporations-will be granted concessions around thereserved portion of the leases whichthe parent corporation will hold andwhich will be enhanced in value withthe growing activity surrounding it.The Kentucky Mansfield ttLead &Zinc Syndicate was incorporated June13, 1918. Its capital stock of $100,000was quickly sold out.
