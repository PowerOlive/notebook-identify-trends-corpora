Mr. E. P. Clarke, aced 73, died at
his home in Millersburg, after a long
and painful illness, at 6 o'cluck, Satur
day morning. Mr. Clarke has been a
sufferer from tuberculosis and other
complications for,the oast two years.
He was a man of strong constitution,
and fought every inch of the road to
death. Ever since his retirement
from the office of Sheriff in January,
1910. he has been practically an inva
lid, though" able to conduct business
actively until last December, when
with his wife he went to Florida,
hoping that the atmosphere ot the
Southern climate might give to him
the long-nedeecl reliet. inis. now
evor, did not come, and he returned in
May in a worse condition phjsically
than when he left home, and since that
time has been confined to his bed al
most continuously.
He belongs to one of lhe stalwart
nnrf sturdy families of Kentucky, the
son of Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Clarke, of
Fleming county, and one of several
children, two of whom survive. One
brother, Mr. J. S. Clarke, of Milleis
burg, and one sister, Mrs. Robinson,
of Missouri, also survive. When quite
young his father moved tu Mason
countv, and Mr. Clarke showed the
sturdy auailtics which have since
chracterizad him as a high type of a
gentlaman. loyal citizen and business
man, when he dtntificd himself vith
thp "Inst, rause". and became a Con
federate soldier.
He was under Col. Breckinridge, in
the Ninth Kentucky Cavalry, andfor
four years suffered with his comrades
-all the privations of war. When this
bitter struggle had ended he returned
home.
All during his life he has been a
devout Christian, a member ot the
Baptise church, and a great part of
the time an officer in this rcligicus
body. After the war he began lite as
a young larmer near maysuch, ami
soon afterward was united in marri
3ge to Miss Elizabeth Ball, at Sardis.
This married life was a long, happy
one. and they are the parents of five
children, all of whom survive, two
Hnmrhters. Mrs. W. G. Leer, of
5illersburg, and Mrs. Robert Boone,
of Texas; three sons, J. S. Clarke, of
Camnhellsville, J. W. .Clarke, of Lex
ington, and Lacey Clarke, ot Millers
burg. In 18S0 he purchased a iarm near
Millersburg, which is now owned by
Mr. W. M. Layson, moved to ,it, occu
pying it for a number cf years, and
during'th'e time was identified with a
number of other purcuits. He soon
fcecameamember ot the firm of Ball,
Thomason &. Co., dealers in leaf to
bacco, and" in this was successful.
Later with Mr. M. IJ. Current as part
ner he purchased the business of Mr.
Jas. M, Collier, and it W2S while con
1 nested with this firm he secured a
position as traveling solicitor for the
, Cincinnati Globe Leaf Tobacco Ware
house, I Mr. Clarke traveled throughout Ccn
' tral and Northern Kentucky and
' Southern Ohio, and brought more busi
j ness tos his company than any other
j man either prior to or since his time,
i This he continued until he was elected
'deputy sheriff in 1901. The husiness
firm of Current L& Clarke was after
ward changed to Claike & Willom,
they after a time disposing of the
business to Stewart & Collier.
Mr. Clarke, being one of the best
known men of Bourbn county, as well
as one of the most popular, has often
been solicited to lun for office, and
many times declined. It was not until
1901 that, through lhe solicitation of
his fiiends he "was finally prevailed
u:;n to un on lie ticket with Mr. W.
W. Hiicneil. ot Puiis, as derjuty
fhenfL. It v. as a n.einoratie campaign,
and these gentlemen came out with
flying colors. In 1905 Mr. Clarke
went to the head of the ticket, and
again another memoranle campaign
was foucht, with equally good results.
He made one of the best officers the
count.v ever had, and he lived to hear
his praises sung in one grand chorus
made ud of many voices in all parts of
the county."
Rather early in life Mr. Clarke
identified himself with the Masonic
fraternity and was a member of
Amity Lodge No. 40 at the time of his
death. After disposing cf his farm
near town he moved to Millersburg
and was successful in a number of real
estate deals. He first occupied a home
i belonging to the Arm of Current &
J-.1 1 J, , t 1 T
uiarKe ana later purcnaseu me proper
ly now occupied by Mr. U. S. G. Pep
ner. During the panic of 1893-1896 he
purchased the property now owned and
occupied by Mr. O. M. Johnson and
family, occupying the same until he
mcveu t j P.ris in 1902. He said that
at the exyuation of his term of office
he wtuld return to Millersburg, the
did piate ihat 1 e loved so much. This
j he iiuUv ii ;cd m 1910, and tor one year
l uj.cd .h- p oberty vacated tby Mr.
J. V. n.oU- At the exDiration of
that tiiiie the lume of the late W. M.
Hamilton was purchased by him. In
the time he has owned tit he made
many improvements, and it is one of
the coziest little homes in Millersburg.
Mr. Clarke was a man whom to
meet was to admire, wh6m to know
was to love. He was true to a fault
and it was this, coupled with many
other virtues, thatjwon and held lor
him a high place in the hearts and
esteem of all good people.
The lunerol, which was one of the
largest, and in every respect one of the
most impressivfi, took nlace Monday
afternoon at 0:30 at the Methodist
church, Rev. Geo. W. Claike, of
Tennessee, offiiciating, assisted by Dr.
C. C: Fisher, of Millersburg. The
floral tributes were numerous and
handsome. Relatives, friends, Con
federate soldiers and Masons were
here from many places. The Baptist
church was entirely inadequate for
the occasion. The services at the
grave were under the auspices of
Amity Lodge No. 40, F. & A. M and
wereconducied by O. R Bankin. They
, were impressive and will linger in the
minds of all present,
j The honoiary pall-bearers were all
i Confederate soldiers, while the active
j pall-bearers were the following: A. S.
Thompson, Pearce Paton, George
Batterton, J. F. McDaniel, O. R.

In Mt. Sterling, Too?
Dr. E. A. Brown, a phvsician of Gal
liopols, O., who was arrested in Lex
ington charged with passing worthless
checks in that city, was in Mr. Ster
ling a few days ago. He claimed to
purchase horses, and in company with
Mr. Wick Bush, a liveryman, went to
Sherburne, Bach county, and bought a
horse from a party there, also one from
Bush, giving checks, which were dis
covered to be worthless. Bush said
the man seemed to be a man of means,
and asked him to look around for 'a
an exceDtionally large one, and very nice home in the city for him and to
deep. After resting on the opposite
bank for some time the negro plunged
into the water and started back across.
When within a short distance of the
shore it is supposed he was seized with
cramps and without uttering a sound,
sank in full view of those who were
on the bank and among whom was one
of his sons.
After dragging the pond for about
an hour the tody was recovered in
about thirty feet of water a short dis
tance from the place where his com
banions had last seen him
locate a fine farm near the city for hm.
Brown is the same man who worked
the cold check game here several
weeks ago and previous to his capture
in Lexington, From all accounts he
played the game in practically every
town in Central Kentucky.
