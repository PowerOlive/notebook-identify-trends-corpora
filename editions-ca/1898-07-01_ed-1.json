Sue apparel and served him right for in
sulting an unprotected girl whoso hurried
steps and timid manner betrayed her un
easiness at being alone ou the street at
such an hour
Will you not come in sir said the
girl stopping at the door of a plain look
ing house Aly father 1 am sure will
wish to thank you for the kind service you
have rendered He is an invalid and it
was an errand to procuro him some neces
saries that took mo out tonight
Ned accepted the invitation and that

-daughter Marie

first ompiio who with tLo fall of his
chief had lest all and drion into exile
with his infant child he hud wandered
from country to country in the hope to
mend his fortune Now his daughter and
Ihimself had no other dependence than the
-earnings of the former who turned to the
best account she could her proficiency in
music by giving private lessons
Ned would gladly have assisted his
iriondsfrom his own purse had ho known
Jbow to do so without giving offense to the
proud old soldier
Ive been thinking of a wife for you

sat together in the seniors private office
So have I replied Ned
Ahem returned tho uncle Ive

Ive picked one out for myself said
2Ned that is provided I can obtain her
consent
The douce you have exclaimed the
head of the firm who had always regarded
tfhe question as one within his own ex
clusive jurisdiction
There is no knowing to what a pitch the
fdiscussion would have reached but for the
entrance of two gentlemen who came to

I Dear Sirs Last spring I purchased
The deceased spoko of having a broth- a box of Wrights Celery Capsules fr dj
er said the trustee in seai cb of whom L C Davenport druggist Bluffton
Jbo was traveling iud and used them tor stomach trouble
Yes bis brother Antolne said the I with which I had been afflicted for more
other who absconded from this country i than 15 years Since taking your Cap
years ago and of whose death I have am- uies I have lost all trace of pain and my
pie proofs stomach is entirely well I can eat any
one papers were submitted to Mr thins and can truthfully sav that I have
ing who promised to examine them and
give bis opinion nest day at which time
if everything was regular the money was
to be turned over to the claimant
It wasnt often that Ned paid much at
tention to the business of the office but
ho mention of certain names during the
colloquy caused him to prick up his ears
-while seemingly busy with tho morning
paper and five minutes later he was run
ning at full speed to tho house of his
friends the Bertrands
At the appointed hour nest morning the
same two gentlemen came to hear Mr
JBanticgs decision Ned as before had
the morning paper before him but kept a
-sharp ear turned
These papers appear to be all right
-observed Mr Banting I have scruti
nized them carefully and find nothing
Tsvanting
Then it only remains to pay over the
-money I suppose said the heir expect
ant rubbing his hands
Nothing more repliod Mr Banting
The trustee produced his accounts
showing the sum on hand which had been
largely enhanced by accruing interestr and
was beginning to draw a check for the
amount when Ned Armour throw asido
-his paper and strode forward
Dont be too fast he esclaimed
It was the first time Ned had ever inter
fered hi a business consultation and his
uncle looked up surprised
i rtWhy wbt do you know about it
asked the latter
Ive a witness in my private room
think better examine before
- youd pro
ceeding further answered Ned Wait
n moment and Ill bring him
Ned stepped out and returned immedi
ately escorting an infirm old man whoso
eye flashed as it fell on the cowering coun
tenance of the would be heir
Tell there gentlemen who you are
said Ned though one of them doesnt
seem to need the information
I am Antoine Bortrand replied the
o3d man proudly tho brother and heir of
jhrm on whose fortune this base wretch
seeks to lay his lawless grasp It was this
-villain when tho star of my illustrious
-chief went down at Waterloo who through
perjury and falsehood drove me into exile
-and received as the reward of his perfidy
my entire wealth Tho proofs ho now pre
sents are as false as those he manufactured
then but I have documents here which
-will leave no doubt as to my right
The false heir did not remain to see in
spected the packet of papers which the old
man presented Suffico it to say they
were found in all respects correct Mario
Bertrand wps now a match for tho wealth
iest man in the land and when Ned told
lois uncle that it was she whom he had
picked out for a wife the old gentlemen
didnt object Neither did Marie nor her
father and Ned Armour lived for many
years happiest of husbands New York

Greater Than Raphael
Whatever position Gaudenzio Ferrari
3nay occupy hereafter relatively to other
masters of his epoch when a new series of
critics and art historians shall have come
forward to call attention to his somewhat
neglected claims there can be no question
as to his astonishing versatility as sculp
tor painter and decorative artist Some
of his Madonnas bring to mind the famous
-one In the altarpiece by Bellini in the
tohurch of the Frarl at Venice
As Gaud9nzio is believed by many to
Satrve been either a pupil or an imitator of
JRaphael Mr Butler says Gaudenzio
never studied under Raphael He may
have painted for him and perhaps he did
so no one knows whether ho did or did
not but in every branch of his art he was
incomparably Raphaels superior and must
Miavo known it perfoctly well Edwin
Xiord Weeks in Harpers Magazine
not telt better in years

KEPT HIS PE0MXSE
Uncle Sim theres a bantam rooster
over thoro in tho yard that you can have
if you want it Its Jacks but hes away
at school and the quarrelsome little thing
has become a nuisance j
Much bloogod Marster Henderson
much bk eged sah said the old negro
Izo boon roun nheap dis uiawnin try in
ter git somuthin sides taters an side meat
fo dinner termerrer kaso its Crismas
an Preacher Yates hos gone sent us word
dafi ho wos gwine to dino wif us
A bantam wont go very far with a
preacher said Henderson laughing
but como along and got him
Whon Henderson gavo him the bantam j
tho old darky carefully concealed it
neath his coat much to tho amusement of
the good natured donor
What are you hiding him for Sim
You didnt steal him said Henderson I
Dats so sah suahs yo born replied J
Uncle Sim rolling his eyes to ono side
till nothing but tho whitos could bo seen I
I ginrally carries dom dat way in cold
weather sah kase dar is nuthin dat so
unfits a chicken fo eatin like bein nigh
froze tor death fo doy is killed And
with tho bantqm under his arm he hobbled
homeward while Henderson smiled when
he drew a montal picture of tho banquet
at Uncle Sims on tho morrow
Uncle Sim was a queer combination of
pioty and cunning Ho was boastfully
proud of having been a member of de
church fo fawty years but liko most of
us ho was not righteous boyond a certain
degree fixed by himself at a convenient
distanco from perfection Many henroost
robberies had he beon accused of but if
ho were guilty ho always covered his
tracks so well that ho escaped punishment
Ho was regarded as a remarkable negro
in ono respect whon he made a promise
he religiously kept it
Midway between the Henderson resi
dence and Undo Sims shanty lived a Mr
Davison an irascible individual with a
penchant for fancy fowls and tho proud
possessor of a flock of high class Brahma
chickens As was his daily custom Da
vison on Christmas morning while feed
ing his fcv3 counted thorn and found
that thoro was one missing a largo roost
er which had in battle or otherwise lost
the spur of the right log
Davison at onco declared that Uncle Sim
was tho thief for tha old man had beon
seen about the promises on tho evening
bofore
With but lit tlo hope of being able to
convict tho cunning old negro the chick
en fancier started for Undo Sims home
When within a short distance of the
shanty Davison picked up the head of a
Brahma rooster and when a few yards
farther on ho found a leg minus the spur
he was wild with rago Hastening to the
nearest niagiptrafos office a warrant was-
procured and just as Proaeheir Yates finished-
the blessing a constable- camo to
march old Sim off to answer tot he charge
of chicken stealing
Uncle Sim begged to bo permitted to
eat his dinner but the officor of the law
was obcitarato and as he was led ou of tho
door Undo Sim said
Preacher Yates yoze welcome to all
ob dat burd dat yo kin eat but 3d bo
mighty much bloegod tor yo if yod jist
lay side a wing an laig fur me till It gits
back
Things looked rather blue for tbaold
man when lie was arraigned There were
the logs and head of a Brahma rooster
and there was Davison3 affidavit that
tho legs andi head aforesaid foiind on
the premises of the defendant were recog
nized by the prosecution as having belong
ed to his fowl now missing
Ail tbodefenssthe old man bad was the
statement
I aint sayim but wot dat might ha b
been Marster Davisons rooster but I de
clar fo Gawd dat I didnt steal him
And again brightening up at the
thought ho said
Ef I hed stoied dat rooster I nevab
would hab lit dom head an laigs lay roun
so careless no indeed sah
While tho trial was progressing a bright
looking youth of about 15 years rushed up
to Mr Henderson who was standing in
front of his house wondering what had
attracted the crowd about the squires
office
Mr Henderson the boy began hesi
tatingly you gave Undo Sim that ban
tam rooster of Jacks didnt you
Yes Georgo What of it said Hon
dorson suspecting something wrong from
the boys mannor
Oh Mr Henderson cried the littlo
fellow his eyes filling pleaso help mo
out of this scrapo But I always wanted
that bantam so bad and when Uncle Sim
came along with him under his arm and
told me that you had given it to him and
that ho was going to kill it and eat it I
wanted it worse than ever and and
Woll what You didnt stoal it from
old Sim did you
Oh worse than that Mr Hendorson
continued George I traded him one of
fathers Brahmasforthe bantam and now
father has Undo Sim arrested for stealing
his chicken I made Undo Sim promise
that ho wouldnt tell any one that wo
traded Please Mr Henderson go up
and tell Squire Propes how it was and IlL
keep out of fathers way until hes over
his mad spell
Henderson arrived at tho magistrates
office just as that dignitary was about to
pronounce sentence on the old negro Aft
er hearing Hendersons explanation tho
squire discharged Uncle Sim and Davison
with blood in his eye started out to lo
cate George
Why didnt you tell the squire haw it
was Uncle Sim asked one of the crowd
Then he would have lot you go right off
You gemmenimus scuse mo from any
essplanation ef I doan git home
mighty quicklhaint gwine tor git none ob
datohicken When I say a fing I does it
I hain saying dat I hasnt stoied chickens
casionally durin my life but bein a mem
