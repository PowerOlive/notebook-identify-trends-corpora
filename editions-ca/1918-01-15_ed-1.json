More Money From the Same Feed
That's the exps rience of every farmer who uses Avalon
"Farms Hog-Tore. Tone,, a hog and he thrives better.
He assimilates a bigger percentage of his food. He is not
'held back in his growth by the dozens of parasites-and
disorders that are an ever present menace to his growth.
Read this letter about getting more value from the same
feed.
THE AVAXON FARMS COMPANY,
Chicago, 111.
In answer to your inquiry of my succes in feeding Hog
Tone, will say that it has been with good success. I would-
?say that it iisa great appetizer, and will also say that it is
benefieial to any hog that is not ieeding out good. A man
will get more feeding values from his feed if he will keep
his hogs in good condition and I have found no better con
ditioner than Avalon Farms Hog-Tone.
