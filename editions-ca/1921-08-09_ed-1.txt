Are you theyoung soldier she was engaged to?"Dick Reynolds nodded."Yes you look like the picture shehad on her bureau. She read that youhad been killed in action and so shejust got pale and sick and went away.Sorry.""Thank you," said Dick as he turnedaway. He wrote a letter to Marcia,addressed it in care of her old employers, marked it to be forwarded andwaited. At last after months offruitless waiting and searching hefound a position in Chicago. Nightafter night he went to the movies, hoping for some clew, and then therecame a time when he saw a wellacted screen-drama and his ownMarcia being kidnaped by a darkvillain in a black evening cloak."Ain't it awful!" shivered a girlsitting next to Dick.Her companion giggled.. "It looksreal, but 'tain't"Dick found it difficult to believethat the characters were not real withMarcia's face so clear, so agonized.He saw the villain carry her away ina -black motor car to a greasy lookingtenement, where several well dressedpeople seemed to threaten her life. Oneman caught her slender wrist andpulled her toward the door."Hi!" yelled Dick, and everybodylaughed. He looked fiercely aroundand sank back in his seat, grim and"Dashed Away."alert He watched the picture untilthe doors closed and the next day hesaw it again. By this time he wassure that his own sweetheart was acting in the movies. Then he saw themanager of the theater.With the name of the producers hefound the location of the companyHollywood, California, and packinghis grip he set out In the search forMarcia. By this time he knew thepicture by heart, learned that the name"of the actress was Elizabeth Jayne, butstrong in his own belief he declaredthe girl to be none other than Marcia.At Hollywood the studios were all sobusy that he barely escaped becomingfamous because he had refused! somany chances to act as a substituteor an extra in one of the many companies.

Someone told him her name ElizabethJayne and because he was afraid tohave his dream shattered, he did notpursue the subject .further. Then itdawned upon him that this was thegirl he was to rescue surely, hewould know then!He played his ,part extremely welland found a strange fascination in thework; the girl looked at him once ortwice with a faint show of Interest,but the grease paint disguised himwell. Then came the moment whenDick, the bad man, was to kidnap the'hero's sweetheart. Dick mounted hishorse, dashed up to the cabin door,shot the hero with a blank cartridgeand swooping down,, gathered thegirl's slight form in his arms anddashed away to the big tree, where hehad been told to await the blare of hedirector's megaphone. "That wasfine," said the girl, cordially, as theystopped under the tree. "Set me down,please.""Finding's keeps," grinned Dick,looking her straight in the eyes.

Exposure, frequentcolds and chills and the strain ofclimbing up and down ladders helpstart the trouble.If your back aches, if sharp painsstrike you in the back when stooping, lifting or working; if you haveheadaches, didziness, rheumaticpains; if the urine is discolored orpassages painful and scanty, tryDoan's Kidney, the remedy so widelyused and so well recommended bymen in the painting trade. Here'sa Paris testimony:Ed. Richardson, painter and decorator, 552 Vine street, says: "Isuffered severely from my back andit put me past going.

Tigert What Mr.Tigert has to say on the importatutsubject of schools, should carry agreat weight as he has lately been appointed Commissioner cf Educationfor the United States by PresidentHarding. Mr. Tigert was one of thefaculty of the University of Kentuckyprior to his appointment as Commissioner. Mr'. Tigert's statement is given below: "In reply to your questions suggesting an expression in regard to the proposed constitutional amendments, oneto take the State Superintendency ofInstruction out of politics, and theother to allow a reapportionment of theState funds for school purposes, allowme to say that I do not know anythingwhich would advance the cause of education in this Commonwealth morethan the passage of these two amendments.Keep Out of Politics."If the State Superintendent couldbe selected upon qualifications andaside from the issues of political campaigns, and then be allowed to continue in office after he has reached anigh degree of efficiency, this one thingalone would improve the efficiency of,our .schools in an immeasurable way,I do not know of anything so important for the betterment of education in Kentucky,Child 'Needs Square Deal."Hardly less desirable would be theamendment which would bring abouta re-apportionment of the funds sothat educational opportunities mightbe equalized throughout the state.Giving a square deal to the chifdren inthe rural communities, to my mind,would be an inestimable benefit coming from such a re-apportionment. Itwould give Tne great satisfaction ifboth of these amendments could btpassed. In the name of the childrenof. our great rtate, let us put thimthrough."CLAXTON ALSO APPROVES.That men and women in both of thegreat political parties think alike concerning the management of the publicschools of the state, should go withoutthe saying. For fear the averagevoter might allow partisan politics tosway him or her at the Novemberelection, some quotations from a recent article by the Hon. P. P. Claxtou,are given nere. Mr. Claxton of Tennessee served as Commissioner of Education for the United States undvrPresident Woodrow Wilson.The reader is asked to comparewhat the new Commissioner has saidabove and what the retiring Commissioner has to say below concerning thevery grave danger of mixing politicswith the school affairs of the state.The reader should bear in mind thefact that these men represent in ameasure the two great parties.Mr. Ciaxton wrote as follows:"Like Topsey, our state departmentsof education have just "growed up."Pew of them can look back to anydefinite birth as state departments ofeducation. Very few, if any, exceptthose that have been re-elected byrecent acts of legislature or constitutional amendments, have beenthoughtfully created and organized infull consciousness of the functionsthey should perform.Office' Is Ndt Political."In most of the states the mistakewas made of supposing that the office of State Superintendent couldbe made a political office subject directly or indirectly to the vicissitudesof partisan government, as if, forsooth, the political parties as suchever advocated different educationalpolicies, and as if the people wouldtolerate partisan influences in theirschools.

Thus, -with kindred organizations, it is promoting one of the mostimportant undertakings looking toward our future security.The object of the Remount Asociaiion is the improvement of generalpurpose horse conditions in everySate in the Union; and because ofthe importance of the "work entailed,Col. F. S. Armstrong, of the UnitedStates Army, has been placed incharge, with headquarters in Washington, D. C, -where his department is inclose touch with every other governmental agency. The Remount Association, with the co-operation of otherssimilarly engaged, has, during theeighteen months of its existence,succeeded in getting one .hundred and-sixty-four stallions eighty-five of"which "were 'donated by patriotic organizations and individuals for distribution throughout the country, tobe utilized by farmers desirous ofraising the standard of their horses.In laying out the "work, it was decided to profit by -the experience of foreign governments and locate thoroughbred sires in every grazing communityof the country. The -whole was divided into zones, and a plan of breeding, to the interest of the farmers ofAmerica, inaugurated. Recent reportsfrom the Association's headquartersin "Washington show that there has"been an average of fifty-five mares foreach stallion, . although the breedingseason is not yet concluded. Also, ata meeting of the Association, it wasshown that there was a demand' forsome seven hundred horses lastSpring, and that, for the comingSpring, this demand will be doubled.or even trebled.Both the race courses and the thoroughbred nurseries constantly arebeing drawn upon for horses of provencourage in the acid test of racing.It remains for them to produce theonly type that measures up to thestandard destined to supply the UnitedState cavalry remounts worthy of themen in the service.It may be added that, owing to the"broad plan of fostering the industryof horse breeding as practiced forgenerations by the British, French andItalian Governments, these countrieswere in the enviable position of ability.to supply their armies with goodmounts, whereas, America, which hadnever introduced such a system wasobliged to draw upon the' resourcesof tke allied nations to horse her men.The HouseholdTyrantBy MURIEL BLAIR!

"Be sensible, Ezra, and take an old comrade'sadvice. Melinda Dockrill, your wife,is the very best housekeeper in Carlton, and. nobody disputes it. Shetends her house and minds her ownbusiness so far as her neighbors areconcerned, but she has been hard,terribly hard on you."There was a good deal of sense andreason to what both men said, anddespite Ezra's weak explanationstheir point of view was practicallyIdentical. Ezra was beginning to getthe reputation of being henpecked, andhis excellent wife, excellent in someways had degenerated into a scold.Melinda Dockrill was fast growingInto a household tyrant. When WalterMaywell came courting their prettydaughter, Flora, She opposed thematch tooth and nail. When justnow some old Spanish American warcomrades of Ezra wanted him to goover to Pelham to a reunion, she hidhis old uniform, 'kept him awake twonights lecturing him on the perniclousness of wasting his time, andflatly refused to allow him to evenmarch to the depot with his friends.That might have been well enough,for, as said before, Ezra was meek,patient and a self-sacrificing sort ofman. Right on top of thig decisionof the masterful Melinda, however,there was a scene in the householdthat appealed to another side ofEzra's nature. Young Maywell hadcome to Mrs. Dockrill in a frank,manly way to ask permission to marryFlora. She had put her husband asideIn the discussion without even consulting him. The result was that poorWalter went about town, a dejectedreproach to the kind-souled Ezra, andpoor Flora mourned till all the happiness seemed gone out of her life.That evening Ezra came down to theParsons home."See here, Greg," he said, "we weretalking about Melinda today.""Quite right, Ezra; what about it?""Why, just this I've been thinkingover what you said.""About time, should say," responded Parsons."I don't care for myself. I canstand Melinda's peculiarities. Thatpoor girl of mine, though, and youngMaywell she's set them grieving theirhearts away with her stubborn ways,and it isn't right, it isn't right!" andEzra broke down."Ezra," said Parsons very seriously,"If you will follow out my directionsI'll guarantee to cure your wife ofher tantrums in a week.""Greg," responded Ezra, graspingthe hand of his old-time friend fervidly, "you do just that and I'll giveyou those old war relics of mineyou've coveted so long. What am Ito do to help you?"If Ezra Dockrill was mystified asto the plan of his friend, his erratichelpmeet had clear hysterics when shefound he had defied her authority andhad gone to the reunion. She rusheddown to the Parsons home, enraged,then anxious, and finally alarmed. ,"I've got a sort of doleful story totell you, Melinda," said her old friend."I'm afraid Ezra has broken thetraces. It's like a horse checked uptoo high. Give him the chance andthe critter'll sprint.""Why, what doyou mean? Surelynothing serious has happened toEzra?" cried Mrs. Dockrill, a quickcatch in her voice."It's the warlike spirit, you see,Melinda," -explained Mr. Parsons.Everyone is talking about the Mexican war. Why, there were lots of theold soldiers just wild to enlist Ezrais a brave man. The war spirit gothim. They were recriuting at Pelham. If he's joined the army againhe'll make his mark."It was there that Mrs. Dockrillbroke down. '"Tell you now," observedthe specious Parsons, "I might havea little influence with the adjutantgeneral, and Ezra, too, if he really hasenlisted. You've got to promise concession. His heart is set on Flora andyoung Maywell "'TH agree! Til agree!" interrupted Mrs. Dockrill vehemently. "Onlyget my dear husband back and he'llnever have to complain of me again."She passed a sleepless night Whenthat precious old schemer, Parsons,presented her husband the next dayat noon, Melinda threw her armsabout the neck of hr prodigal spouse,and Parsons sneaked away feelingquite mean for giving so hard a lesson to a deserving though at timessomewhat contentious woman.AND WHITEN SKIN i;lI'ltlnilllMI'MHIIHlHIIIIIllllllllllllllllM1Spueeze the juice of two lemonsinto a bottle containing three ouncesof Orchard White, which any drugstore will supply for a few cents,shake well, and you have a quarterpint of the best freckle and tanbleach, and complexion whitener.Massage this sweetly fragrantlemon lotion into the face, neck,arms and hands each day and see howfreckles and blemishes bleach out andhow clear, soft and rosy-white theskin becomes.(T-tf)o-Of th New-Mown Hay.The New Zealand black pine, sajithe'Amerioan Forestry Magazine, hasa faint aroma suggesting new-mownbfiy.STATE COUHQH, 0 JIimOB- vORDERCynical Definition.MA bachelor," remarks a disappointed lady, "is a man who lives alonwith the one he loves."a Plans for hojding the State Councilof the Kentucky J.
