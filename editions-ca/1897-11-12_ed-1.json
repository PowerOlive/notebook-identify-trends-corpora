Look Out
For Cancer
Few people are born entirely free from
bkod taint This is often ysy slight or
rethote and sometimes may not develop
at all in one generation but breaks out
in a serious disease later
Cancer the most dreadful of all dis
eases is often the result of some blood
taint inherited from generations back
It often appears as a mere mole or in
significant pimple which later develops
into an alarming condition No one
knows but that he may be subject to an
inherited impurity in the blood nor can
he tell whether or not this may some
day crop out in the form of destructive
cancer It is therefore important that
any little sore or scratch which does
not readily heal be given prompt attes
tion or a serious condition may result
Mr Robert Smedley of Ocala Fla
was the victim of a malignant cancer
which first appeared in the manaer
aboM described He writes
M first I paid no attention to the
little blotches on my face thinking they
would soon pass away Before long
however they became sore and soon
began to enlarge I applied ordinary
local remedies but they had no effect
add I then consulted a physician When
ffenz Lyi
ltraiP H
he told me I had cancer I became
alarmed and hastened to obtain treat
ment for I knew how dangerous cancer
was
I received the best medical atten
tion but the cancer continued to
grow worse until the physicians
finally said that I would have to
have an operation performed as that
was the only hope for me This I re
fused to submit to as I knew cancer was
a blood disease and my common sense
told me that it was folly to expect an
v operation to cure a blood disease
Knowing S S S to be a good blood
remedy I decided to try it and the first
bottle produced an improvement I
continued the medicine and in four
months the last scab dropped off Ten
years have elapsed and not a sign oi
the disease has returned
The alarming increase in the number
of deaths which occur as the result of a
surgical operation is attracting general
attention and a strong sentiment against
such methods of treatment is fast de
veloping among the most intelligent
classes It seems that in almost every
case wkere the doctors treatment is
unsuccessful the learned physicians de
cide at once that an operation must be
performed and the keen blade of the
surgeon is recklessly resorted to
The many caustic plasters which are
applied to remove cancers are more pain
ful than death and the danger of a
gical operation is as great as the disease
itself No plaster or surgical oper
ation can cure cancer because it is
a blood disease the destructive cancer
-cells are in the blood and cannot be
cut out or removed by local treatment
As the disease must be forced from the
blood it is only reasonable to rely upon
a real blood remedy for a cure one
which goes direct to the cause of the
trouble and removes it
S S S Swifts Specific is the only
known cure for cancer and other obsti
nate and deep seated blood diseases such
- as Scrofula Eczema Catarrh Rheuma
tism and Contagious Blood Poison It is
Purely Vegetable
and is the only blood remedy guaran
teed to contain not a particle of mercury j
potash or other mineral which means
so much to all who know the disastrous
effects of these drugs

WENT OUT AND HOLLERED
Case Announced
Pension
Hew a Witness la
nounced Her Husbands Death
It was the trial of a member of one of
Norfolks foremost families The de
fendant was a woman and was charged
with forgery and complicity in pension
frand As the proceedings drew to a
close all the city crowded into the
courtroom Eesidents from Ghent and
loafers from the wharfs sat together
on one bench and the bailiff not to
lose so good a chance manifested his
authority by calling out order and
himself making more noise than all the
people in the court
The last witness was a negress port
ly and very black Her voice was sin
gularly mellow and sweet The govern
ment was questioning her about the
death of her husband and her
ny was directly against the defendant
The courtroom was consequently very
quiet and still
You say your husband died in Nor
folk snarled the district attorney
Yescan
You were with him
Yessah Eight dere with him when
he died
Tell us about it
I member sah he got up through
the night He said he was too wam ly

Windsor Castle Treasures
Those marvelous treasuries the gold
and silver pantries which lie close to
gether in the northeast corner of Wind
sor castle at the foot of the Prince of
Wales tower were until recent years
very frequently visited by the queen
who with her housewifely love of de
tail never considered it beneath her
dignity to make intimate acquaintance
with the vast quantity of articles in the
precious metals which have either been
personal gifts to herself or form a he
reditary appanage to her state Even
lately her majesty has visited her pan
tries in her wheel chair and the present
arrangement of the multitude of ebjects
therein has been made entirely with her
personal approval Apart from the in
terest which necessarily attaches to ar
ticles which are in daily and intimate
use by the queen the plate at Windsor
castle is acknowledged the finest collec
tion in the world and is more than
worthy of consideration
The two so called pantries which in
reality are strong rooms of the most ap
proved and well arranged kind are
separated from one another by he plate
cleaning rooms which are furnished
with all kinds of known appliances for
the adequate polishing and burnishing
of every kind of rare and delicate gold
smiths work All the royal plate is car
ried to these rooms in rotation and
cleaned whether in use or not and the
system employed for giving it out and
receiving it back forms ample and re
sponsible work for the yeomen of the
pantries and their assistants many of
whom are veritable giants among men
as the weight that have to be moved
are very often enormous Colliers

A Train of Blackguards
In many of the great cities of Enrono
whenever a great festival is about to
take place all the questionable and sus
picious characters are urged by the
police to take a few days airing in the
country and to disappear for a time
from their accustomed haunts This is
found preferable to putting them under
lock and key
In Petersburg and Moscow and in Vi
enna those who do not leave of their
own accord on being thus pressed are
shipped off by the police in a special
train and Japan has recently adopted
the same excellent custom
Now whenever a popular pageant is
about to take place the
or train of blackguards may be seen
steaming away into the country with
its freight of known and suspected
malefactors

Some Plain Facts
Grave errors injustice wrongs of
greater or less degree arise from lack
of knowledge of the truth ancLmore
r r j l
irequenuy irom uecepuun
The most infamous case rairrecord
of deception and injustice is the at
tempt to demonetize silver as a money
of final redemption in the United
States
There is no learned judge skilled
lawyer or court of justice that is
capable of reconciling the effort with
the constitutional laws that govern
the issue of money in this country
The people have been deceived
officials in power chosen to adminis
ter justice under the laws have
ignored their sworn duty and given
aid to the scheme that has paralyzed
industry reduced property- values
one half and beggared millibns
There is no authority of law either
specific or by inference By which
gold alone is made the only money
with which to discharge debts either
public or private The effort to
make it so is unconstitutional and a
national calamity
Plain and ample information facts
and truth concerning this almost suc
cessful scheme to corner the wealth
of the people is now being printed
in the Cincinnati EnquireV a news
paper which the combined power of
money has failed to muzzle or buy
