Gov. J. C. W. Beckham, in19 Ofl, and in 1919. Lieut. Gov. Jas.D. Black automatically became Governor when A. O. Stanley qualifiedas United States Senator.Other lieutenant governors inthat time served as acting governors only for brief intervals duringthe- absence of the the Governor beyond the confines of the State. Assoon as the Governor crosses theState line his functions cease andthe duties of the office devolve uponthe Litutenant Governor until the,Governor again enters the State.The second in succession to theGovernorship is the president protein of the State Senate, but few ofthese have exercised into functionsof acting governor. In 1910 President Protem Conn Linn posed asgovernor for a few hours whileGovernor Willson and LieutenantGovernor Cox were both out of theState. President Protem ThomasA. Combs and President Protem C.M. Harris each presided as actinggovernor for a week during the absence of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor who were out of theState.Being governor and not knowingit was the experience of Senator M.O. Scott, of Menifee county, president protem of the upper branch.It was in 1914, when Gov. JamesB. McCreary and Lieut. Gov. E. J.McDermott were on a campaigntrain that crossed over to Cairo,111., to turn around, that Mr. Scottwas Governor for a half hour, butwas unconscious of the honor.HOOVER ELECTRIC VACUUMCLEANERS AND HOTPOINT IRONSWhy give trash for Christmas,when either a Hoover ElectricCleaner or Hot-Point electric ironwould please mother or wife and atthe same time save loads of work?They are both practical gifts andare labor-savers.

This is the system thatobtains at present.As a consequence of the changein the law, many irregularities occurred at the succeeding election allover the State. Like other election regulations the change was notwell understood by many electionofficers and as a result not only theunusued but the vote'd ballots wereburned and in some cases every vestige of the election was unwittinglydestroyed.With nothing tangible at hand onwhich to base a return, election officers in many precincts saved theirfaces by agreeing on the- figures,thus avoiding censure if not prosecution for destroying the ballots.With the ballots destroyed andthe precinct return depending on a"gentleman's agreement," an opportunity for sharp practice was afforded that was taken advantage ofin many cases with the result thatoften the precinct returns in nowisereflected the true vote as recordedby the voters who exercised the4rsuffrage.JEALOUSY-OUSTS GUARDMany cities of the country haveprivate, independent military organizations, some of which have existed uninterruptedly from the earlydays of the Republic. Louisvillehad one once, but the outfit waslegislated out of commission andforced to disband.The famous Louisville Light Infantry was organized about thirtyyears ago as an independent military and social organization afterbeing mustered out as a unit of theLouisville Legion regiment of theKentucky State Guard. The LightInfantry command included a member of nearly every family of socialimportance in Louisville, and it wasknown all over the United Sta,tes.Patterned after the MontgomeryGrays, Vicksburg Shorthorns andother time-honored military bodies,it won many prizes in competitivedrills. Its distinctive uniform andsoldierly precision riveted attention wherever i& appeared.Whatever may have been the realreason, the downfall of the organization has been attributed to thejealousy of the State Guard unit.In any event, a legislative enactment was invoked that sounded thedeathknell of independent militaryorganizations in Kentucky. Theoutlawed command sought to evadethe force of the -enactment by tendering its services to the city ofLouisville as special police, but 'itdid not avail.In the passing of the commandLouisville lost the opportunity to beknown as the home of a famous independent military organization,planned on permanent and exclu-l-sive lines.JgffiBSfeW & m(General AdmissionADULTS27ctwartax 3cCHILDRENNo taxGALLERY18c, war tax 2c30c10c20cFRIDAY 2 Big Features! 2 Stars!

Oneof the most pretentious memorialprojects is in the hands of the Kentucky Council of Defense; thoughstarted three years ago, its workhas been delayed.The Defense Council plans an ornate $300,000 memorial structureto be erected on the campus of theUniversity of Kentucky, at Lexington.

For oversix; months the three Nobles, a father and two sons, have evadedcapture, and whether they ever willbe rounded up to answer murdercharge seems problematical.Breathitt county is crossed by aforty-mile stretch of railroad, yetin its fastnesses, if once gained,men may remain for an indefinitetime in comparative security fromthe law. A company of State militia was unable to apprehend theNobles after they had gained theBreathitt mountains and their capture is doubtful.According to the ethics of themountains a lugitive is practicallysafe trom arrest and not likely toue molested as long as he does notcross the path of 'another clansman,in whicn event ne may as well surrender 10 the authorities, as betrayal prompted by vengeance iscertain. As long" as' the Nobles getalong harmoniously with thoseaware of their hiding place theymay reasonably count upon evadingcapture, but any breach is apt tolead the law ofiicers direct to theirmountain rendezvous.IO"CASCAREFS" TO CLEAN BOWELSWhen Sick, Bilious, Headachy, Constipated, forSour Stomach, Gases, Bad Breath, ColdsClean your bowels then feel fine!When you feel sick, dizzy, upset,bilious, when your head is dull oraching, or your stomach is sour orgassy, just take one or two Cascarets.

George HenryWilmington)"The Lord gave the Word; greatwas the company of those that publish it." Psalm 68, V.II.The Bible many times calls itselfthe Word of God. although there arealways somef who doubt that theBible is the Word of God. Theypoint to contradictions and impossibilities in the letter of the Word,"that the Lord gets angry," and"that He is always the same," and"tha,t the world was made in sixdays." From mere surface appearances the Bible does not seem to befrom God. Yet there is a point ofview from which it can be seenthat "Thy Word is true from thebeginning, and every one of thyrighteous judgments endureth forever." The Bible must be read fromthe standpoint of its purpose. Whenthe Bible is understood it is foundto be just the kind of a book thatGod would prepare. The Bible intention is not to teach geology, astronomy or history. "All scriptureis given by inspiration of God, andis profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the manof God may be perfect, thoroughlyfurnished unto all good wrks."That is the proof of the Word!Does it furnish unto all good works?The truth is not the accuracy ofthe Bible history, although it ismostly true literal fact. If, as issometimes claimed, the Jews werenever in Egypt, the providence ofGod over the Jews was just andmerciful, fully revealing His divinenature. Admit there was no "Prodigal Son" the story reveals the unfailing love of God. The Word isgiving for its Spirit and not for itsletter. Read it to catch the spirit;then the Heavenly light will illumine the mind. The Word is notgiven for those who would profaneit. The Lord gives no holy thingsto dogs, not casts treasures beforetruth to those who desire to profaneit would make them more sinfulthan before. Precious gems andrare metals are hidden in the earth.Those who strongly desire them willdig for them. So are the truths ofthe Word. They are largely hid'den in the letter of the Word.Those who love them will dig forthem. Our Lord said, "Search thescriptures, for in them ye think yehave eternal life; and they are theywhich testify of me."The Vord is like a diamond. Diamonds are discovered in a 'matrixwhich must be removed and the diamond cut. Only then the inflowinglight shines with brilliant colorsand dazzling brightness. The historical stoiy and parable letter ofthe Word are its matrix. Pressdeeply the spirit within that letterand the truths of Scripture willshine like cut diamonds with brilliant light of illumination fromGod. The print and material bookdoes not shine, but the precepts ofthe Word held in the mind do shine.They shine into the difficult problems of life and explain them. Theyflash on the upper pathway to righteousness. Artists depict the Bibleas shining gold and penetratingrays.The diamond cutter works withskill and follows the laws of refraction. Expert cutting makes thediamond more valuable and brilliant. The rule for making thetruths of the Word brilliant is sosimple and easy that anyone can doit. There is only one rule. If welive daily according to its teachings the Word proves itself. It isthis simple rule which was followed by the Christ. He lived theChrist. He lived the Word, fulfilled its teachings, and proved itspower. By the Word lived,overcame every temptation,overcome sin, sorrow, death;Nwon eternal victory. It waffwho gave the rule which anyone cantry and prove, "he that doeth thetruth cometh to the light."oTTSE THE WASTE BASKETParis citizens sometimes find intheir mail a mysterious "chainletter," usually one containing aspecial prayer for happiness or goodluck, or sometimes equally as foolish, and along with it a .threat thatbad luck will pursue them if theydon't write a similar letter to threeof their acqua;intanses. In otherwords, they are threatened withdire things if they "break thechain."This nuisance has been stirred upagain in this country, and UncleSam has sent out a warning to payabsolutely no attention to such letters. They usually spring from themind of some thoughtless, irresponsible busybody who hasn't senseenough to know that unless thechain was broken there isn't enoughmen in the postal service to handlethis class of foolish letters andnothing else.Don't be skeptical enough to givethe "chain letter" a second thought.Drop it in the waste basket, and ifyou haven't a waste basket thestove will do just as well.COTTON GOOD CROPKentucky is not rated as a cottonproducing State, but it has onecounty that grows the staple on arather pretentious scale.
