tothe Herald from Washington saysScientific men in Washington aregreatly interested in Andrees polarexpedition and are eager to gleanfrom any reliable quarter informationconcerning him Prof Wm Harknessof the Naval Observatory in discussingthe story said in an interviewI have no reason to doubt that Andree may have reached as far as S3 degrees north latitude There is nothingso remarkable in that Nansen forinstance went as far or further but Iam inclined to think the Christianastory is unreliable I will not saythat it is impossible for a carrierpigeon to cover the GOO or S00miles indicated over icy seas but itwould be only one chance in a thousand if the bird took a direct routeand if its vagaries were very extendedit would die before long for lack offood Under the best possible chancesa bird perhaps might cover the distancein from 12 to 20 hours resting on thefloating ice en routeOne strong reason for doubt is thatthe latitude and longitude of the placewhere the pigeon is reported to havebeen shot are not given in the dispatches and that is so contrary to nautical custom as to give rise to suspicionThen granting the pigeon wasfound and shot and the allegedletter obtained it seems very improbable that a captain so well acquaintedand so much interested in Andreesplans as this one is said to be shouldrefuse to give the letter into hands thatwould carry it directly to civilizationbut carry it with him further into theArctic region He would naturallyhave been glad to give any such important news to the world as quicklyas possible NA IiUcky

and ingenious doublings over a spur of Johnsmountain At the top of the spur itspeedily lost its identity in a successionof wood roads and after following several of the latter to their vanishingpoints Philip gave up the struggle anddetermined to let the horse find theway if he could In common with unequestrian mankind in general Philipshared the belief in the inerrant pathfinding instincts of horse but after another hour of hesitant wandering during which time he had been thrice garroted by low swinging branches andimpartially bruised about the legs bythe efforts of the horse to squeeze between close growing trees his confidence in the sagacity of the animal began to waver Prom doubt to certainty is but a step and Philips faith inhorses went the way of all delusionswhen the clumsj beast stumbled on theedge of a ravine slid helplessly to thebottom and ended by throwing hisrider into a heap of stonesPhilip was half stunned by the falland when he came to himself he foundthat he had gained a sprained ankle andTost a horse Remembering ruefullythe maxim about great haste and smallspeed lie got up with some difficultyand continued his wanderings afoot until the pain in his ankle

thecabin if he had not insisted upon sleeping on the floor before the lireWhen Philip awoke the next morninglie found himself as completely a prisoner as even Sharpless could have desired Walking was out of the question and his host had neither a horsenor the disposition to go to Glenco toIts Mr Sharptsss she saidprocure one though his offers of hospitality were as generous as he knewhow to make them Philip guessed atthe mans reason for not wishing to appear in Glenco when the mountaineeroffered him a potation from a jugdrawn from its hiding place beneath thepuncheon floor and forbore to pressthe point contenting himself with a request that the boy might be allowed tocarry a letter to Allacoochee TheXermission was given and Philip wrotea note to Duncan telling him of theaccident and urging him to spare nopains to keep Kilgrow out of the handsof Sharpless and his emissaries duringthe enforced armistice This he in-closed in a line to Protheroe in whichlie begged the young engineer to deliver the message to the ScotchmanNot having an envelope he took thatfrom Helens letter drawing his pencilthrough his own name and writingProtheroes above it and after manyexplicit and precise instructions theboy left the cabin on Thorndykes errand An hour afterward he was sitting contentedly on a bowlder by theside of the Allacoochee road waiting in-tranquil idleness for the chance comingof some team whose driver would relieve him of the necessity for furtherexertion He found a proxy in thecourse of the forenoon and in due timethe letter was delivered not to Protheroe but to Mr Jenkins Fench whoanswered the bearers inquiry as to thewhereabouts of the engineer and whokindly volunteered to convey the missive to that gentlemans office on thefourth floor of the Guaranty

this morning andbefore he went we had a conferenceabout the matter in which he has beenrepresenting John Kilgrow I hardlyneed tell you that as professional menwe soon came to a satisfactory understanding and Mr Thorndyke was quitewilling that I should settle the claimwith his client direct He referred meto you for the particulars saying thatit would be necessary to approach Kilgrow

hopelessly ruined his casewith the irate Scot and he was wiseenough to know that he would probably make matters worse by attempting to explain He got away as soonas he could followed to the thresholdby the angry farmer who continued tobreak the vials of- his wrath over thelawyers head as long as the latter waswithin hearing After Sharpless haddriven away Duncan found that an explosion of anger does not- always clearthe mental atmosphere and at a timewhen he felt the pressing need of a coolhead and deliberate judgment he coulddo nothing but walk the floor and calldown anathemas upon the head of theoffender Believing- no word of Sharpless story he yethadta vague fear thatsomething was amiss with Thorndykeand he was glad enough when late inthe afternoon Protheroe rode up tothe farmhouse Duncans first question was of PhilipI supposed he was here he hasntbeen in town for two days I came bythe hotel and brought these lettersthinking that he might want themA great fear seized upon DuncanBobbie man are ye sure he didna goto New York this mornI dont think he did They said atthe hotel that he hadnt been in sinceday before yesterday and theyd knowit if he started on a journey

discharged myself this morning but if I hadnt it would make nodifference where I could be of serviceto youThe gude Lord be thankit exclaimed Duncan fervently and then heproceeded to relate in their proper order the incidents in the history of Kilgrows wrong and Thorndjkes questGnding with an account of the attorneys visit to the farmhouse Protheroelistened attentively and he was readywith his answer when Duncan finishedSharpless lied he said Thorndyke wouldnt turn the case over to thecompany nor would he abandon it justas he had got the whip hand of his opponents Theyve spirited him out ofthe way so they can scare Kilgrow intoa cheap settlement anShaTplesseameto you becausfe he didnt know whereto find the old mountaineerProtheroe spoke to Duncan but hekept his eyes fixed upon the face of theyoung girl who sat eagerly listeningHe was trying another experiment inphysiognomy and the result was notaltogether comfortingYe dinna think theyd harm the laddo yeI imagine it would depend upon circumstances The object would be toget rid of him until they could treatwith Kilgrow You know Thorndykebetter than I do would he be likely togo peaceablyDuncan shook his head gravely NaIm

day before yesterdamy Sharpless is thoroughly unscrupulous and Thorndyke could send himto the penitentiary Its kidnaping atthe best and it may be something muchworseThe engineer found the result of hisexperiment and his own punishment inthe expression of horror that creptover Elsies face when his inference became plain It hurt him more than hecared to admitAll through the long summer whilePhilip and Elsie were apparently journeying hand in hand along the road inwhich he had unselfishly set their feetProtheroe had hugged his ideal playing the heroic part of the high mindedlover who generously effaces himselfin order that the object of his affectionsmay be free to walk in a path of herown choosing It was an unjoyoustask this that he had set himself andhe was humiliated by the convictionrepeated and emphasized every time hesaw Elsie that it gained nothing ingladsomeness with the lapse of timeIn such case absence seemed to be theproper emollient but when Duncanasked his help he said nothing aboutgoing away and entered heartily intothe farmers plans for warning Kilgrowand for beginning an immediate searchfor the missing man It was agreedthat the young engineer should try totrace Thorndyke from Glenco or Allacooche while Duncan made a journeyto the Pocket and when the farmerhad departed on his errand Protheroeturned back to the house for a finalword with ElsieShe was alone in the sitting roomwhen he entered standing at the window which looked out upon the roadHe saw that she had been crying andhe went to her quickly and took herhand in both of hisCan I say

vapor condensesor in other words when the fog formsan enormous amount of heat is givenoff generally at the very height at whichit is most needed Fog and frost occurwhen the skies are clear and little orno air is stirring A strong wind sothoroughly mixes the air that there islittle chance for cold dry air to settlein the hollows and low places Fogthen as the natural preventive of frostmay be a

about by the semisuccessful results in the United StatesThe German government has alreadyoffered a reward of 10000 marks to anyone who shall successfully demonstratethat a downpour of rain can be causedat a fairly moderate expense and thechances are that before many monthsthe world will see a practical test ofwhat may come nearer success in theway of rain making than anything everbefore accomplishedThere is also another feature of theproblem which the European scientistsare discussing that has not previouslybeen brought up to any great extentand that is a plan for countries whererain falls incessantly to stop such afall It is much like considering thetwo points of the compass and yet savants declare that as much benefit willresult to the world by the discovery ofhow to stop rain from falling as by thediscovery of how to make it fallOf the two it is easier to deal with theattempts made to stop rain becauseless has been done in this directionThere is indeed a patent the object ofwhich is to deal with tornadoes and torob them of their evil effects by meansof an explosion in the midst of the tornado itself But it would be unfair toscience not to admit that if it has donenothing to prevent continual rain ithas done much to mitigate the evil effects that floods bring in their trainA superb system of measuring and registering the heights of rivers by meansof gauges is carried out in this countryIn the case of the last flood very earlynotice was given to the residents of thethreatened districts in Arkansas Louis 1iana and western Mississippi of the impending dangerThe number of attempts that havebeen made to induce rain to fall is legion Money has been spent lavishlywith this end in view and a good investment it would be if the success werecommensurate with the expenditureScientific men have given their evidence for and against the success of theexperiments that have been tried andyet the question remains unsettledThere is always the doubt of simple coincidence of events to disturb the judgment on the point of strict cause andeffect The area too over which theexperiment is to be tried cannot always be satisfactorily defined eitherwith reference to the results obtainedor the benefits conferredThe wind bloweth where it listethand it may be that the rain making materials supposing them to be effectiveare wafted to a considerable distancebefore they become operative or beforethey meet with the necessary conditionsthat insure precipitationThose efforts to produce rainfallwhich approach to scientific methodmay be grouped under the followingheads First noise It has been contended that the firing of cannon andthe din of battle have generally beenfollowed by rain -But when statisticsare carefully sifted there does not seemto be much ground for the belief andno one would probably care to risk hispeace and comfort in the very uncertain hope that a great uproar wouldbiing down the needed rainSecond the explosion of balloonsfilled with dynamite or other explosivesome distance above the ground hasbeen advocated and repeatedly triedwith what measure of success it is difficult to saj Nearly allied to the concussion method is the attempt to chillthe atmosphere by the rapid evaporation of some highly compressed gasThen again it is asserted that theestablishment of an electrical connection between a cloud and the earth bymeans of a kite will induce rain to fallSuch a means evidently supposes theexistence of a cloud but inasmuch asperiods of drought are liable to be accompanied with a long continuance ofblue sky the method even if successfulcannot always be applied and in pointof general application falls below thelevel of the other suggestionsCondensation is the result of chillingthe air The ascent of the lower strataof the atmosphere into the higher regions and the consequent expansionand loss of heat is the most probablecause of rain and it is not impossiblethat the air near the ground beingmade to rise by being artificially heated might tend to produce the desireddownpour X Y HeraldThe Natural Briclpre of To DayThe Natural bridge is 215 feet inheight 100 feet in width with a spanof 90 feet

capital where entertainingis done in such a delightful informalmanner as at the handsome abode ofPostmaster General and Mrs Gary atCatonsville Hardly a Sunday passesthat some Washington friend is notinvited to partake of their hospitalityProf Mommsen is now 30 and stillhard at work spending- most of histime making researches in the Munishlibrary The artist Lembach is now engaged in painting the portrait of theman who knows as much about oldHome and the Komans as if he had livedbefore or after the times of Caesar orAugustusBaron Thielmann who has justleft the German embassy at Washington

variousevents to his old teacher all writtenin Sanskrit Thus he described Sedanand the capture of NapoleonQUEER HOLE IN THE GROUNDIt Swallows Topis of Water EveryDay But Never Fills UpOn the eoast of the Greek island ofCephalonia near the town of Argostolithere are two little flumes or canalsleading- inland from the sea to the distance of about 100 feet and then discharging their contents into rudely excavated pits through whoserocky bottoms the water immediately loses itself At least as longago as 1835 a mill was run by powerfrom one of these flumes and a secondmill was built beside and operated bythe other a little while afterwards Themills themselves are now in ruins butthe flow continues This remarkablestate of things has existed over 60 yearsand very likely for a centuryOne cannot help asking in amazement where all the water goes toMessrs Crosby estimate that the flowin each channel amounts to 1000 cubicfeet per minute or 3000000 cubic feetper day in both Two smaller passagesof a similar character have been observedinthe same neighborhood and itis added that along the shore at allpoints between the two mills and foran unknown distance beyond eachthe water is everywhere percolatingthrough cracks and fissures of the limestone and sinking into the earth Theopenings on the sea bottom are nodoubt mainly closed by weeds andgravel yet no inconsiderable amountof water must find its way to these mysterious depths through such an extentof beach lying on a rock that is practically as porous as a sieveIt is difficult to decide which is thegreater marvel the sea mills themselves or the fact that they have remained practically unknown to thescientific world up to the present dayalthough described by several authorsmentioned in the guide books andvisited by admirals generals bishopsand distinguished civiliansAlmost the only explanation hithertooffered assumes that evaporation goeson rapidly in some subterranean cavern and thus disposes of the waterBut as it is admitted that the remaining salt from the two mill streams alonewould amount to 48000 cubic feet oyean it is hard to understand why thesubterranean cavern if there be onedoes not fill up Messrs Crosby offer adifferent hj po thesis The ask thereader to imagine two great fissuresdescending- into the earth and meetingbelow like the sides of the letter V orU Then they suggest that perhapsone arm is shorter than the other audithat there is a long very gently risingpassage leading from thebottom of oneto the bottom of the other so that thesubterranean heat can get a goodchance to act on any stream passingthrough it It then becomes easy tosuppose that a cold current of sea watercomes down through one branch of thesystem and is forced upward throughthe other by thermal influencesThe rocky island of Cephalonia likesome of its neighbors betrays the effects of earthquakes innumerable intimes past abounding in fractures andfaults caverns and subterraneanriversNone of the springs on Cephalonia contains any large quantity of salt however and it is difficult to regard anyof them as the outflow of the floodwhich disappears at Argostoli Butit ispossible that as Alpheus is said to havedone it takes a dive beneath the seaand comes up on some far off islandCassiers MagazineThree Interesting XotesNot everyone who looks at the dial ofa clock knows that the four Is whichare in place

continue our journey to California In the days already spent onthe road from New York each one hadtime to make his neighbors acquaintance and know as much about his affairs as if he had known him for yearsAt the period of which I am writing-one going to San Francisco by trainwas the hero of a thousand possible adventures If in winter the train mightbe snowed up or disappear in a drift ahundred miles from any station on thebleak prairieSummer again had its own peculiardangers We might be stopped andoverturned by a countless- herd of buffaloes or the Indians might take it intotheir heads to tear up the rails Besides this toward the end of a dryhot summer there was the chance of aprairie fire It is about this last that Iam going to write presentlyAway on either side as far as the eyecould reach the prairie rolled in billowslike the ocean here a yellowish greenand there varied with patches of scarletuntil it met the blue sky in the purpleof some far off dreamy bluff Now aherd of antelope would start off and gobounding over the tall rank grass f ollowedby whip like report of the revolver for the gentlemen on the rearplatform carried their shooting ironswith them as a matter of course andwere always ready for a snap shot atany passing gameOne lovely day when we were gettingon at what we thought a pretty fastrate 20 miles an hour the engine suddenly gave several sharp screams andthe train began to slow upAre we nearing a station askedsome oneNo replied the man with his headout of the window but look yonderWe did look and saw a black cloudbreaking across the track ahead andextending as far as the eye could seein one rushing mighty irrestible torrent It was a herd of buffalo on thestampede and as they went thunderingalong the sound of their hoofs was likethe booming of artilleryUntil they passed there was no goingahead for us though the engine mightdrive into the herd and pitch a dozenof them off the line with the cowcatcher it would soon be brought to astandstill by sheer dead weightFortunately it was not a big herdso the trainmen informed us there areno herds now large or small thanks toour wanton slaughter and so we wereWE WERE RUSHING THROUGH ASEA OF FIREgoon ou our way again the irrepressible ones as usual emptying their revolvers uselessly at the flying animalsShortly after the buffaloes had disappeared there was eager talking andanxious consultation with the conductor for some of the old hands declared that the prairie was on firethey could smell itBut it was not until the shadows ofevening had gathered about us that itbecame distinctly visible a thin redand yellow line with flashes shootrnhigh into the somber clouds on thenorthern horizonYes gentlemen said the conductor its rushing along miles ahead ofus and maybe it will cross the trackbefpue we get throughWe were- racing along inerrity nowbut all the northern sky had become oneimmense pyrotechnic display and ahissing crackling noise came down thewind with the columns of smokeAntelope deer coyotes jack rabbitsprairie hens and in short all sorts oianimals and game native to the cotuntry came scudding along in wild confusion and terror and crossed the trackto the southward some being caughtup by the cow catcher andi tossed backa mangled heap by the side of the trackIt was getting insufferably warm andstifling The windows were all closedfor fear of the sparks and the portablefire extinguishers were got ready Daylight was quite gone by this time butthe whole north was lighted up witha blood red glare flashing into sheetsof vivid yellowThe angry hail of sparks flamedagainst the glass and glowed threateningly upon the roof while here andthere little gray clouds of smoke couldbe seen twirling up in thin spiral columns through the interstices of thedoors and windowsOutside the roar of flames the criesof wild animals inside the sobbing offrightened women and children andthe choking cough of some weakchested individualsThe train was dashing along at afurious rate rocking from side to sidelike a mad thing and the conductorremarked in his hurried passage thatthe paintwork had caught fireThe glass in the windows had grownhot to the touch We were rushingthrough a sea of flame The cryingand coughing of the women and children became heartrendering whilethe men stood about in anxious groupspeering out into the yellow lurid lightSuddenly we were plunged into profound darkness It gradually clearedaway but we were terrified afresh bythe strange grinding and jolting of thetrain Had we run off the rails andwere we to be left a burning wreck inthe middle of this awful sceneThe suspense was great but onlylasted for a minute The door openedwith a bang and the voice of the conductor was heard above the din sayingJump out lively lads Shes on fireoutside Bring along your blankets andrugsWe needed no second invitation forthis and presently were standing outside beating at the light flames whichran over the cars likefor the paintwork was indeed on fireand blistered blackened and scorchedin a thousand placesIn a few more minutes our blanketswould have been of no avail As it wasour handsome train was a sadly-disfiguredobject We opened the windowsto let in the fresh air and bring out thefainting women All about us and tothe northward the -ground was oneblack arid waste marked here andthere by the half -burnt carcass of someunfortunate animal whose flight wasineffectual Southward we saw an everrolling black cloud broken at intervalsby a spark or flash of flame but theluridness and glare were now concealedfrom our view by a black pall of smokeas was the pillar of light from theEgyptiansWe thought we haa escaped a terribledanger and were loud in our congratulations but the conductor only shookhis head good humoredly and seemedrather disposed to make light of it Hehad been through a prairie fire beforebut admitted that it was not quite soclose a shave as thisThe fire must have had a frontage ol20 miles he said taking it from firstto last for we were 30 minutes gettingclear of it and I am certain the speedwas worked up to 20 miles an hourWe could but admire the conductorscourage and coolness in a moment ofsuch dreadful jieril to every soul onboard of the train and we told himso with a heartiness and unammitiythat appeared to please him mightilythough he modestly disclaimed all meritfor simply doing as he said what washis dutvAn hour after our great scare thecharred and blackened train was againrushing forward into the darkness witha hundred restless brains becalmed insleep and naught

but the degree ofculture to which a person can pretendis demonstrated quite as often by histreatment of books in their materialaspect There are fairly well informedpersons whom none of these barbarities practiced by publishers can distress Muddy type and poor paperscanty margins edges cut sur le vifhideous bindings these things are tothem mere unessential details Norif they own volumes of an outwardmerit worthy of the inward do theytreat them with the courtesy which istheir due They cannot even take upa book casually without injuring it insome way Any bookseller can tellwoeful tales of some of his customersin this respect They are despite allthe learning they may have the enemies of books He who lends to themunwittingly regrets the rash impulseof generosity And the worst of itis that they are beyond salvation Forunless one is instructed early in lifein the care of books he remains a hopeless Philistine to the end of his daj sThe old savage instinct is sure to breakout In moments of primeval impulsehe may break a binding or dog ear aleafA manual which has recently beenpublished on the care of the privatelibrary contains so much useful information that it is distressing to thinkof it as thrown away The real booklover the man who has reached a pointof culture which distinguishes betweentaste and vulgarity in the manufactureof books will not need to be told thatleaves must be cut with a proper knifepreferably of ivory and cut throughto the corners that not the title pagebut the blank fly leaf is the place torthe owners name that books mustnot be left lying open face downwardsthat they are not card racks crumbbaskets or receptacles for flowers anddead leaves that they should not bedusted by slapping them together thatthey should be kept on shelves not leftlying about on tables But one whodoes not know all this by instinct isa well nigh impossible convert Perhaps a lifetime of labor with such aone may result in better minds andtrue repentance in his children Growing up in a bookish atmosphere is almost essential to a right appreciationof books Who ever saw a library furnished wholesale with new editions innew buildings that had the distinctivecharm such a library ought to haveA collection so made carries an air ofill breeding on its face It is difficultto feel the respect due to books in itspresenceIf you are in the habit of lendingbooks says the author Qf this pamphlet do not mark them These twohabits together constitute an act ofdiscretion Here the true book loveris in a hard position He likes to lendbooks the more he thinks of the bookthe better he likes to lend it for heis unselfish and he wishes others toshare his joy in it At the same timehe -cannot contemplate its passagethrough strange hands without a shudder He has friends he knows withwhom his treasure will be safe Butwhat of those whose carelessness hecannot foresee We have not patiencewith those who say that a book shouldnot be lent If such a rule were followed out half the pleasure of possession would vanish At the sametime it is a pleasure that is mixed withmany perilous chances Yet the leastobliging owners of books are oftenthose who have no real love for themthe kind of people who write on margins and disfigure title pages with arubber stamp It is of little consequence really whether such personsown any books at all ProvidenceJournalBUSHMAN

thing for me tocatch red fish so fast that my line neverhad time to get wet and as for Spanishmackerel why all I had to do was tomove a little bit of red flannel over theside of the boat and the fish would jumpfor it so fast that they would followthe rag into the boat until I was almostcovered with mackerel At one timeduring my visit a number of vesselswas stranded on what was thought tobe a new shoal The ships would restfor possibly an hour at a time withoutmoving and then would suddenly seemto slip into deep water It was verymysterious but the matter was clearedup by the discovery that an immenseschool of yellow tails or horse mackerelhad invaded the bay and at times wouldpack so densely that the vessels wouldreally strand upon the living shoalCatching trout was childs play Jwould attach a large number of hooksto short strands of line fasten them toa piece of wood and throw the combination into the water I would pullit out in less than a minute and everyhook would contain a

KansasThe recently forwarded plan of EdC Little who is nrivate secretary toGov Leedy of Kansas to slice half amile off the western edge of Alissouriand paste it onto Kansas with the aidof a government survey has resurrected an interesting bit of ancient historyof the time when Kansas City was soanxious to get into Kansas that shewanted just seven times as big achange made as Mr Little asks It isMr Littles contention that the dividing line of the two states was drawnfrom the Missouri river north of Kansas City and thence straight southSince the original survey was made ofthe line the river north of Kansas Cityhas so shifted its course that landformerly half a mile east of the riveris now in the bottom of it and the riverbed half a mile west has been madeinto farm land Mr Little holds thatthe line should have shifted with theriver and is now in Washington pushing his propositionRev Father Dalton of the Annunciation church was in Kansas City andwell remembers the attempt made byher citizens in 1875 to have a strip 3miies in wiatn taicen rom Missouriand given to KansasThere was in Kansas City at thetime a home for confederate orphansThe land for this home had been deeded to the state by Mrs Johnstone Lykins and the state wTas to support theinstitution For some reason the Missouri legislature sent an investigationcommittee here and upon its reportthat the home was worthless ordered itclosed and the property deeded backto Mrs Lykins In other ways wasKansas City slighted by the Missourilegislature in the matter of patronageand it was as a measure of retaliationthat the citizens began the agitation ofa plan to make it a part of KansasA resolution was passed by the citycouncil asking the Kansas legislatureto aid in the matter and a delegation ofprominent citizens went to Topeka andpresented the petition but nothing wasever done with it Then the Kansascongressmen took the matter up andundertook to eret a resurvev of theboundary line which would havethrown 3 miles of Jackson countyinto Kansas This would have takenall of Kansas City and more for hereastern limit then was Woodland avenue Kansas was booming at the timeand the idea was that since St Louisseemed to have the pull at JeffersonCity Kansas City had rather be firstin Kansas as she believed she could bethan be second in Missouri The efforts at Washington proved futile tooand after a year of agitation the matterwas dropped but it resulted in scaringthe Missouri legislature and state intowholesome recognition of Kansas Cityand her greatness Father Dalton whois conversant with the history of thewest says the boundary line was established on the corner stone at the southwest corner of the state with whichKansas has nothing to do and thatthe changes of the Missouri river canhave no effect upon it

andthere was a terrific battle which lasted fully 20 minutes and was witnessedbr a large crowd The bird was firstseen flying gracefully through the airSuddenly it dived toward the waterIt came up with a large carp in itsJ claws and the fish was fully as long asthe bird and appeared to weigh aboutsix pounds The bird with its preyFirst the bird had the advantageand then the fish would appear to beon top The bird repeatedly sank itshooked beak into the carp but the fishwas full of fight It twisted andsquirmed and all the hawk could dowas to pose in the air and peck at thefish Finally with one mighty effortthe fish gave a big twist and escapedfrom the oirds talons It fell towardthe water and the hawk dived after itWhen the fish struck the water itwas so badly injured that it could notget away before the bird was upon itThere were several bids for the place j This time the hawk got a better holdthis year Daniortn nas a mortal upon its prey and after sinking its talmv named Sawyer who

FAMING WORLDBUDDING FRUIT TREESMost Successfully Done in ModeratelyDry WeatherThe usual season for budding- is fromthe first of July until the latter part ofSeptember The season varies however with the locality the proper timebeing- when the tree is in active growthand the bark parts readily from thewood It is also necessary to delay thework until the buds are well maturedand it can be continued as long- as thesap moves It is not safe to begin toosarly as the tree may heal over the infcision made by the insertion of thePUTTING IN THE BUD1 Stock slit vertically and across 2 Thesame with bark

matured laterals of a thrifty young- tree The twig sfrom which they are cut should be aboutthe size of a goose quill In removing--thebud from the branch beg in halfan inch above it cut down through thebark and take up a small bit of woodhaving- the knife come out one inch below the bud Leave a small part of thejGaf stem attached by which to handledt Buds can be kept for a week orten days after removal provided theyare packed in a box and surroundedwith slightly moistened moss It wouldbe best not to cut oft any wood when thebud is removed but it is difficult to dothis without injury to the root of thebudTreea are budded when from one tofive years old preferably at the earlierdate Choose a smooth portion betweenleaves make a horizontal incisionthrough the bark and at the upper endone at right angles to it the two cutsforming a capital T Eaise the barkon each side of the horizontal cut slightly grasp the bud by the leaf stem lefton for that purpose and slip it into thisincision With a strip of bass bark orold muslin bind the bud in place and theoperation is completed Be sure thatthe knife used in budding- is perfectlysharp for smooth cuts must always besecured One of the chief difficulties3 IsREMOVING THE BUDL A good bud a root of bud b root ofleaf 2 Bud badly taken with hollow incenter 3 Branch showing knife in position for removing- budis to remove the bud properly from theoriginal stem but this can be accomplished after a little practiceThe budding- is most successful inmoderately dry weather as the sapis in the best condition to form a unionWhen rows of trees run north andsouth put the buds on the west side andwhen they run east and west put themon the north side This will enable themto resist the north and west winds asthey are capable of much greater resistance when the pressure is towardithe stem than away from it In veryyoung- trees insert the bud about twoinches albove the ground If much workis to be done it is advisabletobudding knife which will not beexpensive and is almost essential toifirst class work Orange Judd FaimerMENDING BROKEN TREESleciiHnr Ilesults of Half Girdlingwith Wire HandsIn thorough an old orchardwhere the great gales of the fall of1894 blew over many trees cutting- andsplitting off half the tops of others Iwas struck says J H Hale in theConnecticut Courant with the amountof abuse a peach tree will stand andyet recover In clearing- up the wreckage some of the split trees were boltedtogether others had wire bands puton and still others had the broken halfout away entirely the split trunkssmoothed up with a drawing knife andthe one sided head shortened in to balance it a little better Trees treatedsin the latter -method while having accarred trunk with bark only on oneside have full rounded out hends asgood as though no harm had been doneWhile the wiring process has girdledmany limbs and left poor treesThe rbolted trees look fairly well butnone are so good as those that werethorough pruned with no attemptto -save broken limbs This experiencecovered about 1000 trees and in anyfuture breaking or splitting down Ihall cut everything- away confidentthat however lopsided a tree may betwo years new growth will put it inbetter shape than by any other methodA- peculiar result of half girdling sometrees with wire bands wTas that thefruit borne on them has been largerand of brighter color ripening fromten days to two weeks earlier than thesame varieties of trees without wirebands This might be an advantagein some seasons with certain varietiesand if only a portion of a tree weregirdled at one

should be 2y2 feet long 12inches wide and nine inches high Itis lined with zinc or tin and wheneveran animal is taken from it it should bethoroughly cleansed before resettingThe center post a should be one inchsquare for the bottom part inside thetrap cut down on two sides to one halfan inch for the projecting portions asshown at b with shoulders rounded underneath the middle plank between thelids The center post should fall towithin one quarter of an inch of thefloor of the trap and a thin board sixinches wide and nearly as long as thewidth of the trap should be framed onand firmly fastened to the bottom of itOn this board the bait for the animalto be caught is placed A wire 1inches long is inserted in this standardthe thin way linches albove the topof the trap this wire stands

lowered the wires in the leverswill come directly under the wire in thetA SECURE TRAPstandard The weight of the lids whenthe wires come together will raise thestandard so that the rounded shoulderswill rest against the under side of themiddle plank This also raises the platform a little from the bottom of thetrap The mortice through the middlepiece should be beveled a little to

animal steps upon the platform it very readily moves enough todisplace the wires and the lids fall oftheir own weight J E Lawrence inFarm and HomeTHE KICKING COWHow a Determined Man Can Sub tineHer Without ViolenceIt would be difficult I believe to Snda dairyman of any extent who does notoccasionally have in his herd a cowthat gives much annoyance from thehabit of kicking while being milkedThere are a great many prescribedmeans of subduing such animals andmost milkers have found some plan thatworks fairly well Usually really viciouscows have to submit to fixtures of ropesstraps or the like but even these canbe done without if the milker is a strongresolute fellow who has not the leasefear of his cow and will not lose control of his temper One plan I knowto work well says a writer in FarmersAdvocate is to tie the cows head closeand secure so that she cannot jumpforwards or backwards Then set thepail a little way out from her bendover and place the head very firmlyagainst her groin and with the lefthand grasp the back near teat veryfirmly and commence milking with theother hand In all probability she willset up a furious and determined opposition but if the milker is persistent andstays at his work without a flinch shewill soon lose confidence in her abilityto kick herself free and will give upconsiderably exhausted and subduedTwo or three determined efforts willsubdue very bad cases rendering themready to stand peaceably for weeks together OccasionaDy she returns to herold vice after a time when anothertrial of strength and power of endurance will have to be gone through withand will usually suffice In breaking aheifer or a kicking cow rough usage isunnecessary and unwise By the plaaoutlined a really bad case can be milkedand subdued in spite of herself by astrong determined manDAIRY SUGGESTIONSEvery cow should yeild 6000 poundsof milk per annumMany Illinois dairy farmers are making each and every acre support acowEast milking seems to increase theper cent of butter fat in- themilk Thisis the conclusion of the Wisconsin experiment station but no explanation isgivenThe irregularity of supplying salt isdetrimental to the best results It isessential to health and vigor and aidsdigestion A milch cow will rapidlylose if salt is withheldUsually the man has the better herdwho raises his own calves He knowsthe stock and as they are at homethey will do their best when taken careof Raise your own cowsThe worth of a cow depends in alarge measure upon her capacity toeat and digest large quantities of foodThe capacity of the owner is shown inhis ability to feed her rightIf the right kind of stalls are provided and proper bedding and enoughof it the udders of the cows will be fairly free from objectionable matter Bethere ever so little brush it offr

the Taber Opera House in DenverThe dog was called Bill and he waspart of the outfit of a cigar store in theopera house building Ho was a blackspaniel He was rigged up in Zouavetrousers and jacket trimmed with goldbraid had a tasseled fez on his headand spectacles on his nose The oddestthing about him was that he sat on hishaunches with his paws in the airractually smoking a cigarette like a confirmed cigarette fiend I found thathehad been traiued to smoke the cigarljtfteswhile the audience was going intpfchetheater as an advertisement of his owners business That was the first timeI had ever seen a dog smokingI made the acquaintance of the goatin a tobacco factory in Key West Therewere 200 Cubau girls there nearly allof them pretty and all of them smokersor chewers of tobacco The goat wastheir particular pet He was the biggestgoat I ever saw aimost as large as aShetland pony with big branchinghorns and perfectly tame He playfullybutted tho girls or pranced arouzadamong them His best trick howeverwas the larceny of their dinner basketsHe used to go nosing around until hefound a particularly choice 3uncheonHe would knock over the basket seisethe lunch and dash outdoors with itNo amount of chastisement had everbroken him of the triok Of course Isaw wonderful scenery in the iourneybut the donkey and the dog and thegoat were by long odds the most interesting living
