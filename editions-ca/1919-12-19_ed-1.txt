Thefarmers have been so busy gettingtheir tobacco ready for the marketthat many of them have neglectedtheir corn. Help has been veryhard to get to shuck corn, and theconsequence has been that a veryconsiderable quantity of it has beenleft in the field.The heavy rains which precededthe cold wave which now has thecountry in its grasp didn't Help matters any. Much corn was exposedand is spoiling as a result. Wellposted farmers are predicting higherprices for corn early in the NewYear as result of conditions. Theysay that what holds good for Bourbon county does for other counties inthe tobacco belt, where othercrops have been more or Jess neglected to get tobacco ready for sale,in order to obtain advantage of thehigh prices that are prevailing.o ,DON'T FORGET "DAD"Why not all chip in and buy hima good suit or a warm overcoat.Prices here $30 up.(It) J.

Withina few weeks the . federal censusenumerators will be abroad in Kentuclcv Something like 90,000 of themwill begin work in the country atlarge on January 1. They will havethree weeks to complete the worklaid out for them, where theirN fieldis in a city or large town, and thirtydays where their fields of operationsis in the country. The countryenumerators are to have more timein which to do their, work, becausein addition to counting the peoplethey 'will gather agricultural statistics. One of the reasons for changing the date for taking the censusfrom April to January is that thefarmers usually are busy in the earlyspring. r ,The government assumed that during the month of January the enumerators iwill find the average farmers at leisure and in position tosupply the information the governmentwill desire of him without interferingwith his duties. The department ofagriculture is acting In an,, 'advisorycapacity and assisting the Bureauofthe Census in acquainting farmerswith what will be expected of themwhen the enumerators call.Attention has been directed to thefact that considerable figuring andcounting will have to be done in or-der to atffver accurately and fullythe quescwlis which will be submittedby the enumerators. It will be thepolicy of the government to have itsenumerators who work- in the country leave the questions in the 7,000,000 farm homes and return for theinformation within a week or tendays. The agricultural census statistics are divided into facts coveringfarm tenure, farm values, farm expenses, -uses of. the land" in 1919,drainage, crops produced in 1919,livestock maintained, including anenumeration of the various numbersof class. and grade on every farm;farm facilities, such as tractors, automobiles, trucks and other farmconveniences, co-operative marketing, pure-bred animals maintained,fruits, nuts and various products.-Some new questions in this censuswill involve the amount of land fromwhich no crop was harvested thisyear because of crop failure, cropland lying idle in 1919, acreage ofpasture land on each farm, etc. Thegovernment intends to try to makethe farm statistics fuller and moreaccurate than any gathered in thepast. On March 1 the governmentwill begin taking a census of themanufactures of the United Statesand also of the mining and quarrying,oil and gas and other interests. Thiswork will be carried on by a forceentirely separate from that which willcount the people during the firstthirty days of the year and gatherthe statistics of agriculture. Thework of taking this industrial censuswill continue for several months. Thecount of the people and the agricultural census, as well as the industrialcensus, is to be' taken not only in theUnited States proper, but Samoa andthe Canal Zone. The count of thepeople is always the interesting feature of a decennial census.If the plans of the Census Bureauhere do not miscarry it will not bemany weeks after the last reports ofthe enumerators have been receiveduntil it will be possible to announcethe total population. The enumerators will Report to the District Supervisors, who in turn will reportthrough the State Supervisors toheadquarters here. The returns willbe tabulated here by machinery.There have been far-reaching developments in machine counters sincethe census of 3 910, and while theCensus Bureau does not make anypromise as to when it will be readyto announce the final total for thecountry, it feels it is prepared to doa quick1 job.Following the announcement ofthfe Jtotal population for the entirecountry the bureau wilLeret out asquickly as possible the total for thevarious suxrciivisions, xne county andthe townships. It will announce thepopulation of large cities as rapidlyas. returns can be tabulated. As ageneral rule, totals for the largercities will be announced ahead ofState totals. Naturally there is anyamount of speculation as to what thecount of the people will show the total population of the United Statesto be. All the advance informationreceived by the Census Bureau indicates that there has been a steadygrowth since the count of 1910, butthe bureau declines to forecast as towhat the new count will shbw. 'As soon as the, Census Bureau announces the new population of thecountry it will be incumbent on Congress to pass a reapportionment actfixing the number of representativesin Congress under the new census.o .sFhis is Cincinnati'sGreatest Christmas Store&hYou are invited to do, ALL'your Christmas shopping here rThis great store gleams with the Christmas spirit in every department you will find suggestions galore for every member of yourfamily and every friend.Never before in the history of this great business have we beenfavored with such large stocks of Christmas merchandise and atprices that are so reasonable. vWhen you come to CincinnatiMake MableyS Your Shopping CenterThe rest rooms and checkrooms are free and at -yourdisposal.
