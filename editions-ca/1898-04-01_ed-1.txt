Deliberate ConsiderationWashington March 29 The presidentMonday sent the following message tocongressTo the Congress of the United StatesFor some time prior to the visit of theMaine in Havana harbor our consular representatives pointed out the advantages toflow from the visit of national ships to theCuban waters in accustoming the people tothe presence of our flag as the symbol ofgood will and of our ships in the fulfillmentof the mission of protection to American interests even though no immediate needtherefor might existAccordingly on the 24th of January lasttifter conference with the Spanish ministerin which the renewal of visits of our warvessels to Spanish waters was discussedand accepted the peninsular authorities atMadrid and Havana were advised of thepurpose of this government to resumefriendly naval visits at Cuban ports andthat in that view the Maine would forthwith call at the port of HavanaThe Maine at HavanaThis announcement was received by theSpanish government with appreciation ofthe friendly character of the visit of theMaine and with notification of intentionto return the courtesy by sending Spanish ships to the principal ports of theUnited States Meanwhile the Maine entered the port of Havana on the- 25th ofJanuary her arrival being marked withno special incident besides the exchange ofcustomary salutes and ceremonial visitsThe Maine continued in the harbor ofHavana during the three weeks following her arrival No appreciable excitement attended her stay on the contrarya feeling of relief and confidence followedthe resumption of the long interruptedfriendly intercourse So noticeable wasthis immediate effect of her visit that tneconsul general strongly urged that theprseence of our ships in Cuban watersshould be kept up by retaining the Maineat Havana or in the event of her recallby sending there a vessel to take her placeThe Fatal EveningAt4Q minutes past nine on the eveningof the15th of February the Maine wasdestroyed by an explosion by which theentire forward part of the ship was utterly wrecked In this catastrophe twoofficers and 260 of her crew perished thosewho were not killed outright by her explosion being

3acliThere are many things of interest atartJ around Tampa but if the majorityof tourists who visit the place onlykiii v U the most -wonderful and mostfruit Jul in returns is at Ballast Pointo snall pleasure resort about six milesirnm the city and on Tampa bay Onthe shores of this point are found invast numbers n curious and valuableform of fossils known as coral chalcedonies the like of which are onlyfound it is said on Desolation island inthe far North Pacific oceanThese coral chalcedonies were firstdiscovered by a Philadelphia scientistnamed T A Conrad about 50 years agoand were first described by anotherPhiladelphian Prof Angelo Heilprin afew years later The f os3ils are of bothshells and corals although it is onlythe latter that possess a marked beautyof coloring The corals have becomechanged from their original composition into chalcedony through as ProfHeilprin believes an infiltration ofsilicia in a heated condition The fos6ils nearly all take the form of hollowgeodes or hollow pipe stems as theterm is and in the former it is on theinside that the chalcedony is found andit occurs in brilliant translucent redsbrowns whites and blacks Sometimesthere are successive layers of differentcolors which give the whole an appearance of being agate The most beautiful however are those which are brilliant red and covered with a peachybloomThe pipe stem forms are usuallytranslucent throughout In some casesthe geodes although hermeticallysealed by nature contain water andfrom this circumstance are known bythe people of Tampa as water stonesThese forms containing- water whichmay be seen through the translucentchalcedonjr are somewhat rare and thecurio dealers in the south ask extortionate prices for good specimensMany efforts have been made by scientific men to determine the precisemethod by which the hollowing of thesefossil corals was brought about butnone of them have thus far been willing even to hazard a guess which theywould like to see in cold print Sometimes the geodes contain wet sand andthis is nearly as curious as the wateronly in the case of the sand it cannot befceen through the chalcedonyThese curious and exceedingly beautiful gem like chalcedony corals belongto the geological period known as theLower Miocene system It is not a remote period when the vast age of theearth is considered but long enoughto make ones

will start shortly for the islands of Torres straitsrof Haddon on his first visit obtaineda valuable ethnological collection andbrought back a large amount of interesting-material relating to the mannersand customs of the natives amongwhom he lived generally on veryfamiliar terms He described the islands as differing- considerably in theirstructureThose to the west are composed of oldigneous rocks and might be called disconnected portions of northern Queensland and are moderately fertile thoseto the east are volcanic and the vegetation is much more luxuriant Bothare fringed with coral reefs They areinhabited by distinct races whose manners customs and languages are verydifferent only a few words and thesechiefly trade terms being- common tobothAn emphatic instance of their diversity is found in matrimonial affairsAmong the western tribes the girls pro-pot-emarriage to the men there it isalways leap year Among the easternthe more usual course is adopted Withthe former it might be some time beforea lad had an offer In these islands asin other parts of the world the path tolove can sometimes be smoothed bygifts Here however the most attractive present is not gems or personalornaments it is a mans headThe youth desirous of an offer froma particular maid organizes a foraykills some one man woman or childit matters not much except that thefirst is the most welcome gift and thusm having proved his prowess may besought by the fair one Of course theactual courtship and marriage havetheir own customs some of them singular enough and a certain amount offighting generally harmless is dorigueur between the relatives Amongthe eastern tribes also fighting occursand as a preliminary the lover practically elopes with the damsel But withboth races a payment of some kind ismade for the wifeProf Haddon obtained most of his information on these subjects from theVkibtern tribes but will no doubt thistwjie make that about the eastern equally complete He learned most of theirtotems and the significance of the tatU o marks but here also he trusts toaugment his knowledge There is evidently a fertile field still open and theexpedition if all goes as well as it

XV ContinuedThe conversation which Sonntag andmyself had noted this morning in ourendeavor to solve the mystery of thevoices in my bedroom and up in theattic seemed of the greatest significance Some property was to be removed this very night and if the reference was to anything hidden in thecellar the removal might take placewhile I was absent on my present errandThe thought caused me to urge forward the horse to his greatest speedand very soon I drew near the stationStopping a short distance away I tiedthe horse to the fence and then cautiously approached being careful tokeep in the shadows as much as possibleThe station was standing out boldand distinct in the fbright moonlightThere was not a sign of a human being anywhere around The signal lightin front of the place cast a sickly glowagainst the windows in contrast to thewhite moonlightWith pistol ready for immediate usein my hand I ran swiftly forward andleaped upon the platform The door ofthe station house was locked as werealso the windows By the gleam of thestation light I could see the telegraphinstrument insideThe bank in which I had becu employed was equipped with a private telegraph wire In the gradual climb tothe tellership I had at one time heldthe position of stenographer and telegrapher How thankful I was now forthe long hard study and practice gonethrough to fit myself for that positionT had not forgotten how to send or receive a messageWith the butt end of the pistol a paneof glass was smashed and reaching inthrough the opening I undid the lockand in another moment was insideMy fingers trembled with excitementas I threw the switch which connectedthe instrument with the circuit andthen handled the keyI did not know the call for Philadelphia so clicked the abbreviationPhil a few times and was delightedin receiving a quick responseOperator Keep this dead secretand have delivered quick I wiredThe answer came back O K GoaheadBenj F Perry 1459 Eidgefield AvePhila Pa Come quick to

request to have it delivered immediately to which the short but gratifyingresponse came You bet GoodluckThe operator evidently comprehendedthe full meaning of my dispatch Indeed anyone who had resided in Philadelphia at the time of the robbery reading that message would know its meaningThe short term expressing good willreceived in answer to my request torush coming from one I had probablynever seen encouraged me greatlyThen too knowing Mr Perrys energetic nature I was confident thatgentleman would be up and doing immediately upon the receipt of my dispatch A man of his standing wouldhave no difficulty in procuring a specialrain and allowing the time necessaryto obtain the officers of the law in twoor three hours I could expect MrPerrys arrivalI could not repress a smile as E pictured to myself the president of theSafety Security company riding notin the coach but on the engine to whichit was attached and nrging the engineer to greater speed It was certain in my mind that that special wouldtravel as fast as steam could drive thewheelsA feeling of satisfaction came overme at having taken a decisive step andmy spirits rose in accordance Thenumbness and dazed condition of myfaculties had passed away and I feltthat to rely on ones own exertions wasthe better way after allLeaving the station I went back tomy horse mounted and started up thelong hill Arrived at the top I againdismounted in front of Sarahs houseand going in the front door rappedlong and loud In answer to mv summons a voice called from an upstairswindowSarah is that you I asked step-ping irom tne shadow of the porch intothe moonlightAch Gott Nel vat is it the goodwoman exclaimed fear and excitementat beholding meat this late hour causing her voice to trembleIs yourhusband awake I con-inuedNo indeed He schleep like a logWell wake him up and tell him tohitch a team in the double wagonThere will be a special train come tothe station within- a few hours Havethe team waiting for it Three or fourmen will get off the train take themup and drive them over to the old placejust as fast as the horses can go Willyou do this for me SarahVait I come down was her breathless replyI was anxious to be off homewardbut before I had time to become impatient at the delay the front dooropened and Sarah stepped outDid you understand what I toldyou I asked hurriedlyAch yes indeed Then she repeated my instructions at my requestso there could be no possible mistakeNow I must hasten back Heavenonly knows what might happen duringmy absence I said making a start forthe gateAch Gott Nel vat is de matter anyvays Tell me Is dere any harm toyou Sarah cried after me in such deepconcern that remembering she knewnothing at all of the occurrences at myhouse I came backI havent time to stop and tell youeverything I said hurriedly But Ihave found a small portion of the securities the bank lost by theIt was a bond and I picked it up fromthe floor of the cook house cellar Someone dropped it and when the loss isdiscovered will be back after it So Iwant to be there and see who it isAch he kill you Nel Tont goback You git kilt Sarah exclaimedOh I guess not Ill look out forthatSarah wished to accompany me butI told her how much greater service shecould render by staying and seeing thatmy instructions were fully carried outwhich made her satisfied to remainAs I started homeward the bobbinglight of a lantera was moving towardthe barn which told me Jake was doinghis part and the old fellows unusualcelerity seemed an auspicious beginning to my plan I had left Sarahseated on the porch whence I knew shewould not move until her quick earcaught the first far off rumble of thespecialDuring the ride homeward thethought occurred to me that perhapsI had been too hasty in sending forMr Perry and the detectives For ifthe stolen property or a portion of itshould be discovered hidden in myhouse those who believed in my guiltmight claim that I had hidden the securities myself and becoming fearfulof discovery or being unable to negotiate a sale had now taken this courseto restore what remained to the bankMr Perrys friendship I could possiblyrely upon but the detectives who hadall along believed I was the real criminal might not be so easily convincedof the truth of my storyThere was no recalling the dispatchhowever and in the meantime something further might arise to assist mycase So I had to be content in hopingfor the bestI stopped at the orchard below myhouse and letting down the bars ledthe horse through the long grass upto the barn so that the sonnd of hoofson the hard roadway might not serveas a warning of my approachThe animal had not been spared inthe journey to and from the stationbut pausing not to rub him down Islipped a blanket over his reeking backand sides and then quietly and cautiously approached the houseWhen I came around the corner Twas startled at discovering the darkoutlines of a mans figure motionlessbefore the cook house door I stealthfly approachedHe must have heard me for heglanced around and by his actionbrought his face in the full light ofthe moonIt was Skinner that treacherous coward My animosity toward the fellowwas not lessened by the fact that he wasprowling about my place and I hopeGod will pardon me for the murderousspirit that arose in my heart It lentwings to my feet and in a few boundsI was upon himWhen he saw he could not escapehe turned quickly and raised his armin defense He started to say something but I choked the words injiisthroat for his arms could not stop meMy fingers were steel and closed abouthis windpipe with the grip of a viseYou scoundrel Ive got a doublecharge against you and Ill take my paynow I snarled between my clenchedteethHe squirmed and struggled his handsclutching my wrists in the vain endeavor to tear loose from my graspSoon one of his arms dropped to hisside and he seemed to be nearly overcome for I felt his body gradually sinking down The next instant there wasa cold object thrust against m3 templeand an ominous click sounded in myears Anyone who has had the muzzleof a pistol meaning business thrustinto his face will understand my sensationI instantly let go my hold and fellback a few steps So sudden had beenthe change in Skinner from the de-xensive xo xne aggressive mat ior a Jmoment I forgot about my pistol WhenI did think of it and got throughfumbling in my pocket the rascal hadfled around the side of the housewhither I followed He succeeded ineluding me however Even had I discovered him I would not have fired Itwas not my purpose to raise a disturbance just then For some reason Skinner also was unwilling to attract attention to the spot by shooting forifhe really wished to put me out of theway he would never have had a morefavorable opportunity than when heso clever got the drop on meWhether the fellow was about toenter the cook house when I came uponhiin so suddenly or was standing guardtd give warning to some one who wasalready inside I could not determineIf the last idea was the correct one whyhad he not given the warningMy sudden attack taking him so unawares might be accountable for thisand he might return at any momentand sound an alarmI went quickly back to the cook housedetermined to take advantage of hisflight Kicking off my shoes I enteredA shudder ran over me at the thoughtof again descending into the sepulchraldarkness but there was not that horrible fear that unaccountable terror inthe thought which had so completelydemoralized my nerves on the formeroccasions I was prepared now was ona hot scent the end of which promiseda tangible result At the same time Ifully realized the danger I was alonesingle handed against I knew not whatoddsGliding noiselessly to the cellar wayI paused and listened Tomblikesilence was about meWith the utmost caution lest the oldstairway should creak under my weightI descended The instant my headcame below the level of the floor a faintstreak of light in the op oosite wallstruck my eye The painted door wasajarEagerly I continued downward until I came to the last step Would thevoice sound again and thereby give tirealarm How could I avoid itThought flies quickly when the mindis keyed up by excitement I remembered how on former occasions theplank at the bottom had given way beneath my weight and how the voice hadsounded immediately after Was theresome connection between the twoCould I avoid the voice by avoiding theplankI climbed over the balustrade andreached the cellar floor at the side ofthe stairs To my intense satisfactionthe silence remained unbrokenAfter waiting a few minutes I wasabout to cross to the door when from the11You scoundrelroom above came a sound which set myheart wildlj beating the sound offootsteps moving cautiously across thefloor toward the stairwayAll seemed clear to me then A trapihad been laid for me and I was caughtin it -CHAPTER XVIThe sounds of footsteps upon thelanding ceased for a short time I wasnot afraid to cope with a single manbut I naturally felt no desire to havetwo or more upon me at once It mightbe that Skinner had returned I nervedmyself for a supreme effort againstodds and waited for the alarm whichwould sound the note of warning tothe colleague in the walled up cellarTo my surprise no alarm was givenThe footsteps again began to moveslowly forward To lie in wait for thenewcomer at the foot of the stairs triphim up and so make my escape was myfirst impulseI was about to station myself in position to carry out this plan when a bandof light streamed down and made around yellow patch on the stones belowThus being prevented irom following my plan 1 hastily but silently withdrew behind the stairs and crouchingdown breathlessly waitedSlowly and deliberately the unknowncame down When he reached the bottom step he paiised Then the beam oflight from the dark lantern was thrownupon the plank and moved from side toside as if in investigationThe secret of the plank was evidently known to the newcomer for whenhe left the stairs it wa by a jump whichlanded him on the stone floor beyondand thus as in my case the sound ofthe warning voice was avoidedI had no opportunity then for speculation as to the close connection between the ilank and the voice for thetime of danger was upon me Theround glow crept slowly over the walls Igradually approaching my hiding placeI held my pistol ready determinedthe instant the light fell upon me tofire aiming at a spot in the darknessdirectly above itBut the glow suddenly died awayand total darkness again reigned Thefootsteps went lightly across the floorand soon the crack of light in the opposite wall widenedThe fellow paused but an instant before the wide open door and then assuming a crouchirg position enteredinto the region beyondHe had had his back toward me andthe light coming from the walled upcellar through a narrow low passageway leading to it was faint but myheart took a sudden bound from theglimpse of that form fleeting and indistinct though it was Here was a newelement entering into the mysterywhich surrounded me For a momentamazement wonder held me spellbound Then rising from my hidingplace I swiftly went to the door whichthe person who had just entered hadleft wide openThe faint light from the room beyondwas almost blotted out by the mansform as he went slowly along the lownarrow passage He could not proceedwithout making some noise and I sawa startled face appear at the other endI could hardly repress a cry of astonishmentThe light in the room was at one sideof the passage it shone full upon thefellow and revealed the form and faceof Horace Jackson In one hand heheld a bundle of papers and he appeared too dumfounded to move Theman he was watching reached the endof the passage and stepped into theapartment beside himI was eager to verify my first impression which the glimpse of the newcomers back had given me butimmediateh upon his entrance into thewalled cellar he stepped to one sideont of the lne of visionJacksons eyes followed him andwere evidently resting upon him indoubt and suspicionYou he finally exclaimedI listened intently for the answerand the sound of the voice sent a shudder over me The voice was familiarand it was with deepest dread I hearditYes You wonder how I found youout came in response to Jacksons exclamation That I will not
