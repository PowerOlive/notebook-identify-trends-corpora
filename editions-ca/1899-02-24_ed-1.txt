the Day They AcceptedMilitary Offices - Seats VaeantWashington Feb 22 The report ofthe house judieiary committee on thestatus of Gen Wheeler and other members of the house holding army commissions was presented Tuesday Theessential facts were given at the timethe committee reached its conclusionto declare vacant the seats of Representative Wheeler and othersIn addition to this the report givesthe views of the committee on thequestions involved It sajs that at thepresent time when patriotic impulsesof our people are aroused it mayseem unpatriotic to question the courseof a member who leaves his seat to goupon the field of battle But againstthis there is the plain language of theconstitution and the manifest dangersthat would follow any other courseIf one general of the army could betaken from the senate or house thenthe court argues that with equal rightthe entire national legislature could betransformed to a band of military officials The incompatibility of servingin congress and in the army and thebad public policy involved also aredwelt upon It is argued howeverthat the constitutional inhibitiondoes not apply to members holdingplaces on the Hawaiian and other commissionsIn conclusion the report admits aresolution declaring that Representatives Wheeler of Alabama Bobbins ofPennsylvania Colson of Kentuckyand Campbell of Illinois vacatedtheir seats as representatives

buildings wounding an officer and threemen by firing through windows duringthe excitementAt 8 oclock an incendiary fire occurred in a block of brick buildingsoccupied by Chinese on the Calle Lacoste in the Santa Cruz district Astiff breeze was blowing and the inflammability of the structures causedthe blaze to spread with alarmingrapidity The city fire departmentwas hopelessly incompetent andthe English volunteer brigadefrom Santa Mesa was summoned andwith a modern engine pumping adequate streams from the canal succeeded after four hours work in gettingthe blaze under control Meantimethe entire block and the greater partof two others across the street werecompletely guttedThe firemen escorted by soldiersproceeded to clean out the houseswhile the fire was unheededThe 13th Minnesota was reinforcedby detachments from the 3d infantrythe 2d Oregon the 3d artillery and the10th Pennsylvania Bullets flew in almost every direction in the Tondo andBinondo districts causing the most intense excitement Capt Robin ion ofCompany C 13th Minnesota and threemen were woundedMany timid persons imagining thatthe rebels had effected an entrancethrough the American lines and wereadvancing into the city hurried frantically from their hotels and housesonly to be stopped at the first cornerby a guard The sounding of a nativebugle call immediately preceding thefire lent color to the story Thousandsof Chinese crossed the bridges andplazas under fire hurrying with theirbundles to the Chinese consulate Allnight long the fire spread through theTondo district sweeping away rows ofhouses and devastating acres of territoryThe damage was inestimable Withdaylight punitive measures were decided upon and the Americans thoughtired after their sleepless nightswork soon cleared the district ofevery native after a slight resistanceImpediments were placed in the waof the firemen and the hose was cutfive different times This resultedin all the natives being drivenoff the streets those in theimmediate vicinity of the blaze beingcorralled in vacant lots and guardeduntil the excitement was over Inmany instances the natives were insolent and paid no regard to the ordersgiven them and the soldiers were compelled to use harsh measures Thebutts of their rifles and their bayonetswere freely appliedThe danger from live electric lightwires necessitated the closing of thecircuit in the burning region and theonly light in certain parts of the citywas that furnished by the blazeShortly after midnight another bigfire was started in the Tondo distri ctwhere natives are the thickest and whenthe firemen and soldiers attempted towork a regular fusillade of rifle andrevolver shots were fired from thewindows and roofs of the buildingsThere was some fighting in thestreets during Tuesday

accompanied them to the doorand then crept sobbing and snifflingback to his own apartmentHe had scarcely turned his back whena man crawled out from behind a heavyV- -curtain of a little alcove He wentsoftly to the door unlatched it andglided ut into the dimly lighted corridor He turned a corner and goingdown one of the darkest and narrowesthallways on the same floor he approached a man sitting on a windowsillI know you are cold and tired hesaid But I could not get away sooner It was the voice of Minard Hendricks and he was speaking to DrLampkin I found the door of thestudio open and got in safely enoughI was too late to see Gielow and just asI was about to come out Miss Huntington and her aunt came in and turnedup the gas I had to lie low but I overheard what Ill bet the police will nevertret out of the artists servaut I heardhair jumbled his eyes looked as if fyn i him tell Miss Huntington that Gielowweeping they had swollen too big fortheir socketsWhats the matter Henri askedMiss Huntington almost fiercely hisbearing and aspect hurling a freshshaft of conviction into her heartSpeak I say dont you know T am astrue a friend to him as vou areHe hes gone Miss Dorothy

Winfret stepped up to the manand laid a commanding hand on hisshoulderWhere has he gone to she demanded Speak I sayHenri looked inquiringly at Dorothyand perceiving that she was hangingon his replj saidI dont know I cant say but he hasleft forever forever Miss DorothyThe girl felt her knees growing weakand she sank into a rustic chair whichlt r lover had brought from the hills ofPalestine Presently she leaned forwardHenri you must tell me all youknow she said firmly I am hisfriend You know I can be trustedI know that well Miss Dorothyhis accent betraying just the faintesttouch of his French birth but he mademe promise not to betray him to anyone although almost the last word hespoke was to say he did it for your sakeDid it for my sake muttered thegirl and there she paused It lookedas if she were afraid that Henris nextwords would furnish positive confirmation of her worst fearsIf it was not for the row he had withMr Caruthers at the club Id really believe that there was some mistake aboutit continued Henri in a dismal halfwhine half sobbing tone But as it ishe has ruined himself for all timeThe man buried his face in his tensehands and rocked back and forth in ast avsii of emoti crHenri said Miss Huntington at thelowest ebb of hope do you believe yourmaster killed Mr CaruthersI have been wanting to go to thePalace hotel to find out if anything hasgone wrong there was the answerbut my master told me to stay righthere and deny to any caller that he hadleft the city He said he had murderedMr Caruthers but I hope I almosthope that master was out of his headGreat God exclaimed Dorothv uuder her breath and then she raised hervoice He confessed it to youHenri noddedHe said so Miss Dorothy butHenri Mr Caruthers was murderedten days ago in his rooms at the TalacehotelAre you sura Miss DorothyYes Mr Hendricks the most celebrated criminal detective in the UnitedStates informed me of it about an houragoThen it is true gasped the servant My mate not only told me aboutit but I overheard him confessing itto Count Bantinni The count wasasking him all the particulars and thenI heard the count say Xow you musttell Henri Tell him vou did it andthen remember you must make yourescapeThen some one rang for me and 1came indown the roomhad confessed to the murderAs they walked away through thelonely streets Hendricks recountedminutely what had taken place in thestudioHell never hang for it if he iscaught was the doctors commentwhen his friend had concluded It isplain that he is as mad as a march hareThe detective reserved his opinion onthat point and Lampkin studied hisface in no little surprise Hendricksprused struck a match on a wall andlighted a cigar He held two in hishand but he was too much absorbed toofter the remaining unlighted cne to hisfriendYou certainly think Gielow did thekilling dont you questioned Lampkin taking the cigar as it was travelingback to Hendricks vest pocketOh beg pardon exclaimed the detective I was not thinking of what Iwas doing As to your question it is byfar too earlj to pronounce the artistguilty sane or insane If I did thatthere would be nothing left to unravelnnd I dont operate that way Heheaved a big sigh Doctor mark mywords when this thing is sifted to thebottom it will be found the most gigantic piece of shrewd criminality everheard of Remember I said ever heardof Good by this side street will takeme home quickly and I want to thinkover some perplexing detailsCHAPTER VIILampkin did not see the detectiveagain till late in the afternoon of theday thus begun He met Hendricks ashe sprang from a cab in front of Gracechurch on BroadwavI have but a minute to spare thedetective said There is much to lookinto I am sending out trusty youngfellows in many directions As for meI am just now studying cremationYou want to see if-If a one handed man has been takento a regular crematoryAh a good idea of course Haveyou read the papersOnly the headlines They areenough for me Denhams star is in theascendant but it will sink eventuallyinto a mud puddleHe seems not to have got a word outof Gielows servant replied the doctorHe didnt know how to do itgrinned the man of experience in suchsidLLll4wlM l1 COULD SEE KOLA BEHIND A JEETtilings There are many theories advanced I presumeThe doctor noddedAll of them point to Gielows loveaffair and his recent flight They makeMiss Huntington disagreeably conspicuousAnd a blasted shame too muttered Hendricks She belongs to theswell gang and all that and was bornwith the proverbial spoon in her prettymouth but all the same she is a creditto womanhood the stuff mothers ofgreat men are made ofIf she reads the papers she will feelsorely hurt for not one of them credits the poor fellow with even temporaryinsanity They have made him out acold hearted cool headed villain whonot satisfied with killing his min cremates his body simply to show the malignitj of his hatred -Hendricks was moving- away hishand outstretched when a suddenthought lighted up his face and hesaidAnything in the papers about hishaving been last seen in the companyof Count BantinniNot a wordThen Denham is minus the chiefclew to the whole business Toorlow One of the headlines dubs him aDr Tekyll and a Mr Hyde a man whopaints Madonnas and angels and at thesame time is the devils vilest agentI hope you will run across something in Gielows favor said Lampkin-May God help him if I cant saidthe detective with feeling This forenoon I went all the way out to Kolasplace on the Palisades hoping he mightaid me in some way I found him absorbed in crystal gazing and I knewit would irritate him to be interruptedtill it pleased his fancy His easternservant had led me into the great darkroom where Kola sat and whisperedthat I must wait till the prince of occultbalderdash had received some psychicimpression or other From where I wasplaced I could see Kola behind a screenHis Droflle was towards me His lipswere moving constanly and his eyeballs standing out from his cheeks onstiff muscles He is a fit subject for amuseum He has had some accidentwith an explosive with which he was experimenting and his hair was singed oftclose He actually looks uncanny Isat without a word or a sign of recognition from him till I got tired and stoleawayI didnt know he had moved outthere said the doctorOh yes and the place suits him to aT He found an old colonial mansionbuilt half of brick half of stone in awooded portion of Cliff side Park themost inaccessible part of the PalisadesHe found out by accident that it wasunder contract to be torn down beforelong and got a couple of years lease onit and recently he received a carload oforiental rubbish from somewhere andhas turned the interior into the queerest looking retreat you ever saw Igot onto his idea not long ago andwhile it is not exactly above board Ihave nothing to say for New Yorkersthe wealthy ones love to be humbugged and Kola has discovered thatthey are willing to pay for it to bootThe vast mystery w ith which the rascalinvests his personality does the workHe couldnt have chosen a better placeThe old mansion is reputed to have beenthe headquarters of a gang of thieves ofong standing and when they were disbanded ten years ago I heard muchabout the place One of the thieveswho died in prison said a gang of counterfeiters had operated there for fifteen years and had the most perfect outfit in the cellars beneath the house thatwas ever owned in America As I saidthe mystery does the work for KolaHe receives applicants for psychic messages in the dark or when he is cowledgowned and masked I heard of onemulti millionaire who wanted his advice and went out there one afternoonin a coach with six armed attendantsto drive off possible highwaymenKolas ambition is to get rich rapidly and I think he is making considerable money He has founded a sort ofcult and I assure you none but the richare admittedDo you think he can really tell people things they dont know asked DrLampkinHe often gives me valuable hintsanswered Hendricks with a shrug Ihave no idea how he gets his information You know my weak point is superstition I cant help it I shall talkwith him about this case before it isended He is a sensitive cuss and wouldtake offense if I didnt I want to knowparticularly if he has ever met Bantinni and if he has I want to know whathe thinks of him I called at the countsrooms

induced to defend the CountyCourt that is controlled and overpowered by the worst political elemeut in thecountyThe above lines were calledforth by a paragraph published in TheNews on the 14th inst in which thecounty officials were exonerated froinunjust and uncalled for criticism piincipally from rank partisau sources inregard to alleged neglect of duty iu relieving the needy poor The Newsfound on

hadpreviously been helped by others Audthe absurd suggestion is made that becanse of these few small duplicationsthe county should permit a local benevolent order to manage the disbursementof the countys charity and then probably some other order would want tomanage some other matter aud so ouad infinitumThe Reporter does not deal in factswhen It says the county officials delayed action until another organization was in the fieldThe truth is that t everal hundred dollars had been expnnded in xid tothe needy poor before any other orgauized effort was made to relieve theirwants the idle

WorkPARKER JAMESLHOIEIIS M UMTS FIMbilEHSFourth and Main Sts Paris KyBloodhoundsThe gentleness of bloodhound disposition is probably accounted for by theirnot having been used to hunt and killprey One of the most ancient anecdotes of these dogs attributes the capture of a fugitive to the use of his ownbloodhound The name itself is probably a modern one based on a vulgarerror that the dogs only followed personswho were red handed from homicideor who had about them the smell of recently killed sheep The ancient namewas lyme dog or talbot which latterappears to have been a white variety ofbloodhoundThe Cuban bloodhounds which wereused for hunting slaves by the Spaniardsand were imported into Jamaica werenot bloodhounds at all but a cross between the mastiff and bulldog or perhaps the dogue of Bordeaux Theywere brindled prick eared and doubtless horribly savage They were however used as police and like thebloodhounds on the border were maintained in every parish in Jamaicawhere it was the duty of the churchwardens to keep them at the expense ofthe communitySome of these dogs were kept in London during the early days of the zoological gardens The stories of theirferocity are probably not exaggeratedthough Lord Balcarrea who imported200 of them into Jamaica to aid in subduing the maroons never used themHe frightened the negroes into submission by circulating the stories currentabout the dogs London SpectatorTook His Wifes AdviceWhen the man whose haircut showedthat his wife had peculiar notions as tothe way a man should dress his hairquit giving advice one of the

schoolmeeting at every step it was at theclose of the empire the splendid uniforms of the imperial guard greenchasseurs white lancers and the darkand magnificent artillery officers blackand gold a costume worth while getting killed in Sometimes on hotevenings I treated my companion toabsinthe out of economy he neverdrank On these occasions the ex soldier who had become a sober paterfamilias and had lost the habit of theparrot would rise from the table witha touch of heroic drunkenness in hisbrain and the rest of the way I was almost certain to hear some tale of warOne evening I believe that PereYidal had had two glasses of absintheas we walked along the hideous Boulevard de Crenelle he stopped suddenlybefore a military old clothes shopthere are many like it in that quartera dirty sinister den showing in itswindow rusted pistols bowls full ofbuttons and tarnished epaulets infront were hung amid sordid rags afew old officers uniforms rain rottedand sunburned with the slope in at thewaist and the padded shoulders theyhad an almost human aspectVidal seizing my arm with his righthand and turning his slightly tipsygaze on me raised his stump to pointout one of the uniforms an

thenumber engraved on the buttons andwent on with enthusiasmMy regiment The First ZouavesSuddenly his hand shook his facedarkened dropping his eyes he murmured in a horror stricken voiceMoi Dieu what if it were hisThen brusquely turning the coatabout he showed me in the middle ofthe back a little round hole borderedby a black rim blood of course- Cmade one shudder like the sight of awoundA nasty scar I said to Pere Vidalwho had dropped the garment and washastening away And foreseeing atale I added to spur him on It isnot usually in the back that bulletsstrike captains of the zouavesHe apparently did not hear me hemumbled to himself How could itget there Its a long way from thebattlefield of Melegnano to the boulevard of Jrenelle Oh yes I knowthe carrion crows that follow the arraythe strippers of the dead But whyjust there two steps from the military school where the other fellowsregiment is stationed He must havepassed he must have recognized itWhat a ghostSee here Pere Vidal said I violently interested stop your muttering andtell me what the riddled tunic recallsto youExcept for the two absinthes 1 doubtif he would have spoken for he lookedat me timidly almost suspiciouslySuddenly with a great effoit he beganWell then here goes for the storyI can trust you you will tell me frankly on your honor if you think my conduct excusable Where shall I beginAh I cant give you the other manssurname for he is still living but Iwill call him by the name he went tinder in the regiment Dry -lean and hedeserved i with his 12 drinks at theatroke of noonTHE BOURBON NEWS

cat flung his punishment atDry Jeans head adding curtly 1know you my man and Ill bring youto order Dry Jean answered never aword and walked away quietly to dopack drill But all the same the captain might have come off his high horsea bit had he seen the rage that reddenedthe sergeants face as soon as he turnedhis head and the hatred that flashedthrough his terrible blue eyesHereupon the emperor declares waragainst the Austrians and we areshipped off to Italy But let me comeat once to the day before the battle ofMelegnano where I left my arm youknow Our battalion was camped in alittle village and before breaking theranks the captain had made us a speechlightly enough to remind us thatwe were in a friendly country and thatthe slightest injury done to the inhabitants would be punished in an exemplary way During the speech DryJean a little shaky on his pins thatmorning and for the best of reasons1shrugged his shoulders slightly Luckily the captain didnt see itAt midnight a noise woke me Isprang from my heap of straw into thefarmyard and in the moonlight I sawa group of comrades and peasantswresting from the arras of Dry -Jeanraging like a lion a haudsome wenchdisheveled and half dressed who wascalling loudly on the Madonna and allthe saints I was hastening to helpwhen apt Gentili arrived With onelook the little Corsican had a paralyzing way he cowed the terrifiedsergeant then reassuring the Lombard girl by a few words in Italian heheld up a trembling finger before thescoundrel and saidDogs like you deserve to have theirbrains blown out as soon as I can seethe colonel you lose your s tripes againthis time for good Theres to befighting to morrow try to get killedSure enough at dawn the cannonadeawoke us The column formed andDry -Jean never had his cursed blueeyes glittering more ominously placedhimself beside me The battalion movedforward we were to dislodge the whitecoats who with their etvnnon occupiedMelegnano Forward march At thesecond kilometer the Austrians grapeshot cut down 15 of our companys menThen our officers waiting for the order to charge made us lie down in thegra infield sharp shooterw ise they remained standing naturally and ourcaptain wasnt the least straight of thelot Kneeling in the rye we kept onfiring at the batterv which lav withinrange Suddenly some one jogged 103elbow 1 turned and saw Dry Jeanwho was looking at me the corner ofhis lips raised leeringly lifting hisgunDo you see the captain he saidnodding in that directionYes what of it said I glancingat the officer 20 paces offHe was foolish to speak to me ashe did last nightWith a swift precise gesture heshouldered his arm and fired I sawthe captain his body bent backwardhis head thrown up his hands beatingthe air for an instant drop his swordand fall heavily on his backMurderer 1 cried seizing thesergeants arm But he struck me withthe butt of his rifle rolling me overand exclaimedFool prove that I did itI rose in a rage just as all the sharpshooters rose likewise Our colonelbareheaded on hissmokinghorse pointed his saber at the Austrian batteryand shoutedForward zouaves Use your bayonetsCoukl I do likewise than charge withthe others What a famous charge itwas too Have you ever seen a highsea dash on a rock Each companyrushed up like a breaker on a teefThrice the battery was covered witablue coats and red trousers and thricewe saw

onlytime to see a blonde mustache a bluecap and a carbine barrel almost touchme Then I thought my arm flew off1 dropped my gun fell dizzily on myside near a gun carriage wheel andlost consciousntWhen I opened my eyes nothing waito be heard but distant musketry Thezouaves forming a disordered half-circlewere shouting Vive lEmpereurand brandishing their riflesAn old general followed by his staffgalloped up He pulled up his horsewaved his gilded helmet gayly andcriedBravo zouaves You are the firstsoldiers in the worldIfound myself sittingnear the wheelsupporting my poor broken paw whensuddenly I remembered Dry -Jeans awful crime At that very instant hestepped out of the ranks toward thegeneral He had lost his fez and froma big gash on his close shaven headran a trickle of blood Leaning on hisgun with one hand with the other heheld out an Austrian flag tattered anddyed red a flag he had taken The general gazed at him admiringlyHey there Bricourt turning toone of his staff look at that if youplease What menWhereupon Dry Jean in his canaillevoice spoke upQuite so my general But youknow the First zouaves there areonly enough left for once moreI would like to hug you for thatcried the general youiI get the crossyou know and still repeating whatmen he said to his aide-de-camp something I didnt understand- Im noscholar you know But I rememberit perfectly Worthy of Plutarchwasnt it BricourtAt that very moment the pain wastoo much for me and I fainted Youknow the ist Ive often told you howthey sawed off my arm and how Idragged along in delirium for twomonths in the hospital In my sleepless hours 1 used to ask myself if itwas my duty to accuse Dry -Jean publicly But could I prove it And then1 said Hes a scoundrel but hesbrave he killed Capt Gentili but hetook a flag from the enemy Finallyin my convalescence I learned that asa reward for his courage Dry -Jean hadstepped up into the Zouaves of theGuard and had been decorated Ah atfirst it gave me a disgust at my owncross which the colonel had pinned onme in the hospital Yet Dry -Jean deserved his too only his Legion of Honor ought to have served as the bullseye for the squad detailed to put himout of existenceIts all far away now I never sawhim again he remained in the serviceand 1 became a good civilian But justnow when I saw that uniform with itsbullet hole God knows how it gotthere hanging a stones throw fromthe barracks where the murderer is itseemed to me that the captain thecrime still unpunished was clamoringfor justiceI did my best to quiet Pere Vidal assuring-him he had acted for the bertFive days later on reaching the officeVidal handing me a paper folded at acertain paragraph murmured gravelyWhat did I tell you I readAnother Victim of Intemperance Yesterday afternoon on the Boulevard deGrenelle a certain Jean Mallet known asDry Jean sergeant in the zouaves of theImperial guard who with two companionshad been drinking freely was seized withdelirium tremens while looking at someold uniforms hanging in a secondhandshop He drew his bayonet and dasheddown the street to the terror of all passersby The two privates with him had theutmost difficulty in securing the madmanwho shouted ceaselessly I m not a murderer I took an Austrian flag at Melegnano It seems that the latter statement istrue Mallet was decorated for this feathis addiction to drink has alone preventedhim from rising in the ranks Mallet wasconducted to the military hospital of GrosCaillon whence he will soon be transferredto Charenton for it is doubtful if he canrecover his reasonAs I

Bathsas a Remedy for VariousDiseaseOne of the most potent remedialagents known to science is heat It hasbeen instinctively resorted to in allages in all countries and among barbarous as well as civilized peoplesBorne So its palmy days had its greatbaths such as Diocletians and Caracallas covering many acres and fittedup with great elegance with frescoespaintings and statuary To these thecitizens resorted daily as the people ofthe present day resort to the clubThese proved to be health preservingto such an extent that physicians werenot needed Wherever the Romanarmy was stationed the bath or thermae was established as in Bath England so named because of the greatRoman bath which remains there andis now utilized as a Turkish bathWhen Christianity took possession ofRome strange to say the authoritiesdestroved the baths as pagan institutionsand it remained for Mohammedan Turkey to establish them within its domain and thence comes the nameTurkish bath It should be borne inmind that the Turkish bath is a hot airbath while the so called Russian bathis a steam bath and the two are totallyunlike in their effects The former isessentially tonic in its effects whilethe latter like the hot water bath isenervatingVery few people comprehend whythe hot air bath is so potent in the cureof disease The reason is simple andreadily understood Natures methodof protecting the body from the effectscf heat especially high temperaturesis by the evaporation of moisture fromthe surface of the body and this moisture is provided by the perspiration andthe less clothing the more effectual theresults so that natives of hot climateswho are nearly naked realize more fulljthe benefits of perspirationUpon submitting ones body divestedof clothing to the 150 degrees and upwards of heat demand comes for relief soon the pores are opened perhaps to an extent not before realizedfor months or even years as many persons have inactive skins and when thisis the case other organs and notablythe kidneys must take on double dutyand are thus overtaxed and diseasedSo now the pores are actively at workand the poisonous wornout materialis being eliminated from the bodvthrough natures sewerage systemthe pores What follows as a sequenceWhy as thffc blood furnishes the perspriation it necessarily comes to thesurface and thus the circulation isequalized over the entire surface andas the logical sequence of this all congestive tendency is relieved thus establishing perfect equilibrium whichis absolutely essential to perfecthealth The bath thus becomes ahealth preservativeAs it is expensive and often inconvenient to resort to the public bath orthermae an excellent substitute is tobe had in the use of the so called bathcabinet which incloses the individualexcept the head the heat being furnished by an alcohol lamp Much higher temperature and better results canbe obtained in houses where furnacesare used by placing the cabinet overthe furnace register and shutting offthe heat from some of the other registers There is no doubt whatever thatthe grippe may be avoided as well ascured by use of this simple and inexpensive method which every one canhave I assert further that the congestive condition of pneumonia can bereadily relieved by this method Thisis no mere theory for I have knownof its successful application in the lastcrisis of pneumonia not once but several times with both children andadults The medical domain of thebath is limitless and for the reasonthat it places the entire organism in acondition to relieve itself of disease toan extent impossible by any othermeans I have known of the worstcases of confluent smallpox cured andnot a pock mark left on the skin Ithas been proved beyond all peradventure a cure for hydrophobia within myown personal

American Horse Tamer Mastered the Moitt Vicious Horsein EnglandUnder the title An Invincible HorseTamer Lida Rose McCabe rehearsesthe story of John S ltareys career inAmerica and England as a breaker ofjolts and tamer of vicious horses Hismost conspicuous triumph was the taming of Lord Dorchesters Cruiser 40years ago The horses temper had depreciated his value 3000 For threeyears he had been abandoned to himself Tormented by huge bits loadedvith chains his head was incased ina complication of iron ribs and platesgo that he had to procure his food bylicking it up with his tongue Oppression and cruelty had made him a demonHe resented the approach of anyone byfearful screams and yells of hate andfury He snapped an iron bar an Inchin diameter in two pieces with histeeth The heavy planks that formedbis prison he frequently kicked intosplintersCruiser I think said Lord Dorchester in his challenge would bethe right horse in- the right place totry Mr Rarey s skill and the soonerhe experiment is made the better Ifbe can ride Cruiser as a hack I guarantee him immortality and enoughready money to make a British bank directors mouth waterI will tell you said Mr Rarey inrecounting this crowning incident ofhis career what happened at my firstinterview with Cruiser I believe thereis some cause for everything a horsedoes He acts according to the impressions on his mind Instead of throwingaut a stick to fight him when I first approached Cruiser I threw open thedoor and walked in He was astonishedat seeing this and more so at my exhibiting no fear He had on his heada large muzzle linked inside and outwith iron He had worn it three yearsuntil it bored a hole in his head I tookit off and he never wore it againIn three hours Lord Dorchester wasable to mount Cruiser and Rarey rodethe horse as a hack to London Cruiserbecame the property of his tamer Thefortune of Mr Rarey was made Allclasses headed by the nobility flockedto his lectures and exhibitions LordPalmerstoa opened the subscriptionlist to Mr Rareys private instructionsgiven in the riding academy of theDuke of Wellington Queen Victoriawas among the first to express joy atthe regeneration of Cruiser and to regret the hard usage to which the horsehad been subjected Frequently shecaressed the beautiful creature with herawn hand On the eve of the marriageof the princess royal Mr Rarey wasinvited by the queen to give in the riding school at Buckingham palace an exhibition before the royal guests summoned to the wedding The next day hewas honored with an invitation to hewedding at St James palaceUnder the favorable influence of kindtreatment Cruiser rapidly improved inappearance His rough shaggy eoatwas shed for one of the luster of satinFestive in a royal purple silk bridlewith rosettes of gold filigree and thelook of a war horse in his high bred nostrils he followed his master throughihe capitals of Europe Everywherethroughout his travels in the old worldMr Rarey gave free lectures and exhibitions to cab and truck drivers In hisremarkable collection of souvenirs isa gold medal of wonderfully fine workmanship presented Mr Rarey by theRoyal Society for the Prevention ofCruelty to
