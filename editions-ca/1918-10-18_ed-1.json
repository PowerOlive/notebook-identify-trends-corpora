'' ' REYNOLDS
Shelby Reynolds, aged eleven
years, died at 7:30 o'clock, Wednes
day, 'morning at the Clark County
Hospital in Winchester, after a long
illness. He was the only child of his
pareats, Mr. and Mrs. Isaac Reynolds,
formerly of North Middletown and
CUntonville, this county. The fam
ily moved to Demopolis, Ala., about
a year ago. .
When "the child's health began to
decline he was" sent back to Ken-tucky-to
be with his aunts, Mrs. Louis
HsLgan and Mrs. M. M. Hughes, and
to oadergo medical treatment. He
rallied fox a while, and for some time
.gave evidence of decided improve
meat, but the disease which caused
his "death had gained too strong a
liol44on his constitution.
la accordanc with his own wish
the body of the child will beburied
in the North Middletown Cemetery,
by the side of his grandfather, the
late Rev. L. H. Reynolds, who was
for a lifetime a loved minister of the
"Christian church, in charge of the
coregation of the North Middle
town church.
TURNEY.
The funeral ' of Mr. Amos Tur
ney, Srv prominent horseman, who
died suddenly, was held Monday
afternoon and was largely attended,
niany prominent turfmen from a dis
tance being present. The body was
laid to rest in the Paris Cemetery be
neath a wealth of floral offerings.
Mr. Turney's love for the horse
which was so strongly developed dur
ing his lifetime, was shown in a re
quest made by him a few weeks prior
to hfs death, that, at his funeral, he
wished only horse-drawn vehicles
used. This request was complied
with, and although a large number
of persons were present in autopno
biles they -went ahead of the funeral
cortege, and left it to slowly wend its
way to the cemetery lot where the in
terment took place.
When two sons of Jesse Turney,
the other member of the firm of Tur
ney Bros., were ill of typhoid fever
Dr. Eichberg, of Cincinnati, who lost
his life in the Adirondack Mountains
a few years ago by drowning, was
called to attend them. They both re
covered, and as a mark of his appre
ciation Jesse Turney named what
was then their most promising year
ling after Dr. Eichberg. The horse
by his future performances proved a
veritable wonder of the turf.
Although the firm of Turney Bros,
retired from the turf about two years
ago and deposed of their entire sta
ble, Mr. Turney until the day of his
death was intensely interested in
events of the racing world. He was
of a jovial and kind disposition, and
many a jockey and stable boy has
good reason to remember him
through his acts of kindness.

THAT NEW DAM.
HAVE
Councilman John Merringer, who
has taken a great deal of interest in
the new dam proposed to be built
across Stoner near the site of rthe
present dam at the Paris Milling Co.'s
plant, was in a jubilant mood yester
day. , Mr. Merringer stated that Superin
tendent J. A. Morrison, of the Louis
ville & Nashville, had received taii
thority from the high officials of. the
company, at Louisville, approvingrthe
plans and specifications, for the new
dam,, and virtually giving him '-authority
to go ahead with the con
struction work. The papers in the
matter had been held up for some
time undergoing a close, scrutiny by
the Louisville & Nashville people, and
now that they have come to the con
clusion that the matter imust be set
tled, we "hope that the work will be
gin at once, and the matter settled
for all time to the satisfaction of all
parties concerned. The new dam will
not be built before it is needed," as
the old one is in bad shape.

general health condition throughout
Kentucky, save in a few cities where
