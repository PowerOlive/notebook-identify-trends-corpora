DailiesPittsburgh Pa Dec 16 The members of Pittsburgh Typographical Union No 7 have walked out of the offices of the Pittsburgh daily newspapers and struck work although thescale or contract between the printers and publishers does not expireuntil December 24 They have notstruck for higher wages The demand is that the machinists employed to care for the linotype machinesand who are members of Duquesnelodge No 199 of the InternationalAssociation of Machinists be forcedto become members of the typographical unionTo accede to this demand would beto violate a contract between the publishers and the machinists The contest of the typographical union therefore resolved itself into an attemptto disrupt a union of fellow workmen It is not primarily a dispute between newspaper publishers and printers but a dispute between printersand machinists and an effort on thepart of the printers to use the publishers as a club to drive the machinists into the typographical unionThe present strike is

itrich and picturesque history Masons of high degree from all over theUnited States and Canada met at thetomb of Washington in services commemorating the 100th anniversary ofthe death of the greatest AmericanLater in the day when the masonicceremonies had been concluded theIndependent Order of Red Men succeeded them in honoring the memoryof Washington with the rites of theirorder The masons went

remains of Washington now lieImpressive masonic services wereheld and at their conclusion the grandmasters and members of the craft deposited wreaths and evergreens onthe tombUpon reaching the mansion thelines were drawn up and PresidentMcKinley delivered an address whichwas listened to in profound and impressive silence He spoke as followsWe have just participated in a service commemorative of the 100th anniversary of the death of George Washington Here at his old home which heloved so well and which the patrioticnnfn f tlte country rav guarded withlining hands exercises are conducted under tb auspices of the great fraternitycf masons which a century ago plannedand executed the solemn ceremonialwhich attended the father oir his country t his tomb The lodge in which henns initiated and the one over which hea terward presided as worshipful mastcorded positions of honor at his obsequies are to day represented here in token of profound respect to the memory oftheir most illustrious member and beloved brotherMasons throughout the United Statestestify anew their reverence for the nameof Washington and the inspiring exampleof his life Distinguished representativesare here from all the grand lodges of thecountry to render the ceremonies as dignified and impressive as possible and mostcordial greetings have come from acrossour borders and from beyond the seaNot alone in this country but throughut the world have masons taken especial interest in the observance of thicentennial anniversary The fraternityuslly claims the immortal patriot as oneor Its members the whole human familyacknowledges him as one of its greatestbenefactors Public bodies patriotic societies and other organizations our citizens everywhere have esteemed it a privilege to day to pay their tribute to hismemory and to the Splendor of hiachievement of justice and liberty amongmenHe had neither precedent nor predecessor His work was original and constructive and has successfully stood the severest tests He selected the site for thecapital of the republic he founded andgave it the name of the Federal Citvbut the commission substituted the nameof Washington as the more fitting andto be a perpetual recognition of the service as the commander-in-chief of the continental army the president of the convention which framed the constitutionand the first president of the republicMore than seventy millions of people acknowledge allegiance to the flag whichhe made triumphant The nation is hibest eulogist and his noblest monumentI have been deeply interested andtouched by the sentiments of his contemporaries uttered a hundred ears agoon the occasion of his death RevWalter King of Norwich Ct in thecourse of an eloquent eulogv deliveredin that civ on January 5 18 H said in partBy one mighty effort of manly resolution we were born anew and declaredt ur independence Now commenced thebloody contest for everything we helddear The same Almighty Being bywhose guidance we were hitherto conducted beheld us with compassion andsaw what we needed a pilot a leader inthe perilous enterprise we had undertaken He called for Washington alreadyP spared anointed him as His servantwith regal dignhy and put into his handsthe control of all our defensive operationsBut here admiration surpasses utterance Your own mind must fill out theactive character of the man A description of the warlike skill the profoundwisdom the prudence the heroism andintegrity which he displayed in the character of the commander-in-chief wouldsuffer materially in hands like mne Butthis I may say the eyes of all our American J3rael were placed upon him as theirsavior under the direction of heavenand they were not disappointedAnd on the day preceding December 2f179t in the course of his memorable funeral oration before both houses of congress Maj Gen Lee then a representative from the state of Virginia gave utterance to the noble sentiment as forceful to day as in those early years of our-national life To the horrid din ofbattle sweet peace succeeded and ourvirtuous chief mindful only of the corapon good in a moment tempting personal aggrandizement hushed the discontentof growing sedition and surrendering hispower into the hands from which he hadreceived it converted his sword intoi plowshare teaching an admiring worlii hut to be truly great you must be trulvgooaWhile strong with his own generationhe is stronger even in the judgment ofthe generations which have followed After a lapse of a century is better apnrecated more perfectly understood Moreperfectly understood more thoroughlyenerated and loved than when he livedH remains an ever increasing influencefor good in every part and sphere of action of the republic He Is recognizeda not only the most far sighted statesrr an of his generation but as having hadalmost prophetic visionThe nation needs at this moment thehelp of his wise example In dealingwith our vast responsibilities we tvrnto him We invoke the

everyone gazing pityingly at her but not one starred to her assistance One womanfainted another had hysterics and thelittle conductor bustled up officiouslyand said quite loud enough for Maudto hear She seems to be gettingviolent We are near Green Pond station and I think you will have to getoff hereWhat she cried do you thinkI am crazy Oh my God And sinking into her chair she buried her facein her handsAs the train slowed up the 1wo mentook her by the arm and commenceddragging her down the aisle Sheought them inch by inch but theywere strong men and she a slight girlof 20 so they had her at the doorwhen the train stopped Suddenly herface brightenedO theres Tom Holland TomTom she cried struggling with renewed energyAt that Dr Aldrichs athletic formblocked the stairwayTom Holland he saidIf you knowI demand ofthese gentlemen proof that they haveany right to coerce you in this wayBefore he reached the end of his sentence he and the young girl occupiedthe platform alone Both men took totheir heels and have not been heardof since The young lady swayed forward and would have fallen but forthe doctors strong arm He lifted herdown from the train and looked aboutfor Tom Holland who had been on theplatform three minutes beforeThe doctor had seen him at the sameinstant Maud had cried out to himand seizing his grip had made a rushfor the door He too was on his wayto Toms camping place and decidedon seeing him that Tom had drivendown to Green Pond to intercept himHere was the doctor with an unconscious lady in his arms and no one inhim quite equal to the occabicn bunevertheless it was awkward and heswore softly under his breath as hecarried Mauds limp form into the littlestation houseThe station master brought him amug with some whisky in it and hesucceeded in bringing Maud back toconsciousness She sat vp crying andlooking wildly about her Finding herdress loosened at her throat sheclutched at her jewels and finding all safe she looked in the facesof the doctor and the station masterWho are you she cried You arenot the ones who carried me offThen she called for Tom repeatedlyand sobbed out that if she had taknTeresas advice she would never iavecome to thisThe doctor tried to reassure her butshe would not be comforted So hesent the station master to find some onewho was willing to drive them to TomscampThe doctor was far from comfortabledoubt this girl knew the Hollandbut she might bs crazy neverthelessHer actions were suspicious enoughPerhaps Tom Holland would not thankhim for bringing this girl to the campTwo hours later the question wassettled for him They overtook Tomdriving in and surprised him greatlyHe had never received the doctors letter saying he was coining and of courseMauds advent was a surpriseExplanations passed on both sidesand Mauds shaken nerves began toquiet down Mrs Burridge put her tobed as soon as they reached the campand the doctor sent up a dose of bromideTwo days later Miss Teresa Hollandarrived Her mothers advice had beenGo up to camp and look after Maudyourself Teresa found Maud verywell taken care of when she arrivedShe was swinging in Toms hammockwhile Dr Aldrich read aloudThe girls staved two weeks andbrought a new and happy change intocamp Teresa finding plenty to admirein old trees and rocks developed into avery pleasant companion and she couldout tramp anj of themMaud was a good deal changed by herunhappy experience She started quickly if any unexpected sound was heardand she never went out of sight of someof the campers This being her condition Dr Aldrich found it necessary tolook after her verv carefullvOne night near the end of their stayMaud and the doctor were strolling onthe shore not far from the cabin andboth were strangely silent FinallyMaud spoke in a low and intense voiceSupposing doctor you hadnt beenthere Tom would never have heardme He wasnt watching the train atallIt was the first time he had let hertalk of her fright for it agitated herI was thinking of another supposition he said Supposing you shouldgo back to Chicago as you have plannedto do next month what a blank youwould leave behind you Then againsuppose you should let me join youtherein the

paintedWhen he reached the door he couldplainly hear the deep snoring of bothmen and mustering all his courage hestepped lightly insideIn order to reach the rifles in the corner he was forced to step

dispositionshould be made of the prisoners Thisproved a somewhat difficult matter Totake them to Dyea involved a vexatiousdelay for there were no horses for themto ride and to turn two such desperatemen loose seemed a dangerous thingto do Moreover they would starvewithout provisionsAfter talking the matter over sometime without arriving at any conclusion Taylor exclaimed impatientlyThey ought to be hung but I dontwant the job Wed better give themgrub enough for a week or two andturn them loose We cant be botheredwith themHis advice was agreed to by the restand the little outfit was at once prepared When they were ready to starthe walked up to the two desperadoesand saidTheres your grub Take it and lightout I shall give a full description ofyou to the authorities at Dyea and
