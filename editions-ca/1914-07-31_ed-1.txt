It isofficially the annual convention ofthe American Osteopathic Association, but as there is no European organization, this society acts as aworld tribunal. Osteopathy is nowforty years old, and the practitionersnumber seven thousand.The most spectacular feature of thecoming convention will be a big business clinic held by Dr. James A. Edwards, of St. Louis, the famous discoverer of the new Osteopathic cureof catarrhal deafness. He will demonstrate his new technique upon anumber of patients who have beenpronounced incurable by the classicmethods of the specialists of the oldschool. His method consists of"finger surgery." It is an adaption ofthe famous bloodless surgery to thethroat, and is all done with the fingerinside the month, and without instruments. It is analogous to the renowned operation performed uponLolita Armour.Edwards found that the most common kind of deafness in America isthat type caused by catarrh. This isthe only kind which this treatmentwill cure. He discovered that inthese cases the deafness was causedby adhesions of, the -little air tubeconnecting the throat and the ear andby impediment to the draining of thistube. With the finger alone thetrained Osteopath is able in most cases to partly correct this condition sothat some portion of the hearing isrestored. He and his associates haveport cures and partial cures in abouthalf of them. This does not meanthat half of the deaf people can behelped, but that half of those who aredeaf from this cause only.Dr. Edwards will be assisted by Dr.D. Webb Granberry, member of theBoard of Registration in Medicine inNew Jersey. ,Dr. Percy H. Woodall, of Birmingham, Ala., President of the Association, will preside, at the session.Dr. Harry W. Forbes, President ofthe Los .Angeles College of Ostepathy,will present an original contributionon disturbed circulation to tlle-lov.'',part of the spinal cord.From the scientific point of vieone of the most vital things in the convention will be the report of the Research Institute, by Dr. John Deaconof Chicago, the director. Researchinstitutions established in otherschools of practice are founded an?supported by constributions from phlantropists who are laymen, but thi ,is the only one in the world foundeand financed entirely from the privatincomes of practitioners."GIVE YOUR WIFE ANANNUAL VACATION."Also, Take .One.

Newman, of Frankfort, to send outa bulletin to farmers, suggesting thatthey plant millet, cow peas, sorghumor corn broadcast in unused fieldsand so raise a forage crop for feedingtheir stock this winter.

Dame Fashion treacherouslyshowed the long Dutch tunic, a ruffledskirt of the Crinoline days, and then,with an impish grin, the basqueand polonaise. The Directoire periodhas clung to tailored suits, leaving itsimprint upon them, tossed us a fewbales of striped materials and departed, as the Westener said of the horsethief, "for parts unknown."Plain and "Awning Striped RatineMake a Stunning Frock When Developed After This Model.Broad stripes, narrow stripes,straight stripes and crooked stripesimmediately were used not only forthe Directoire tailored suits, but forall sorts of dresses whose style wasindigenous of the period of 1914.As stripes 'are rather trying to theslender woman, who predominates,the stripes are combined with plaincolors, producing wonderfully attractive gowns. Thus we sometimes seethe tunics of striped and sometimesthe underskirt, sometimes an underwaist and sometimes the overwaist.It is the clever use of these stripeswhich suggested my illustration forthis leter.Awning striped ratine makes thelower skirt section and the sleeves ofthe waist. Plain ratine is used forthe over-blouse and fitted circular tunic. In the front of the lower skirtis an inverted pleat which adds widthand comfort in walking.My second illustration shows agirl's basque dress made in blacksatin and striped taffeta. The blacksatin fronts of the waist extend intoa band which finishes as a sash in theback. The tunic of the striped taffetais edged with a band of satin, whilethe lower skirt is of black satin. Acollar of sheer white crepe, picot edged, gives the desired touch of daintiness to the dress. A charminglygirlish white sailor hat with a bunchof white roses at the side and whitelacquered ribbon around the crown isworn with this costume.In the Spring the French handmade waists were made with theedges scalloped down the front andbound with a bias fold of the samematerial as the waist. Now has comethe fashion of cutting the bottoms oftunics and skirts in scallops, points orsquares and binding them either withthe same material or with a wovenbraid. This is unusual arid strikinglysmart. It is also a thing not hard forthe amateur dressmaker to do if shewishes. 'It takes time to baste and tostitch carefully, but no great skill.A wonderfully stylish gown whichI have just seen was made of blacktaffeta. The bodice was of the long-waisted type, too closely fitted to bemoyen age, yet not quite a basque.The skirt was made with a long tunic,which seemed to be attached to thebottom of the waist. The tunic wasscalloped around the bottom in largeshallow scallops bound with the biastaffeta. The V-shaped neck of thewaist was" low with a large collar ofsheer linen cut in scallops to matchthose on the skirt,, and edged withnarrow Valencinnes lace.A wonderful evening wrap was ofJlJ i: -1 ,..14-1, r. ,i, vr,,,ic r'null, glccu uucuwim Of wiuau oaiiuio-ite shade of cyclamon pink, Jrom alarge, fitted shoulder-yokeof braidedbroadcloth hung two flounces' o tkegreen,; one? to about three-quart?length- and the other handn? to, iustbelow the waist. Both of these flounces are cijt hvdeep Van Dyke points,lined' with the pink satin and boundwith braid to match the green broadcloth. Each time the wearer movesthe points ripple, showing the exquisite coloring of the lining with arosy lining.Black velvet, of the light featherweight variety is the season's fad andit safe to say one which will last wellinto the Fall. Made into cunning little coatees and saucy little capes,sashes and girdles, it promises togain in favor until the entire costumeof velvet will be the rage.Stripes or loops of velvet ribbonare placed oh a crepe of Chantillylace to form a pelerine, while a largevelvet collar circles the shoulders,almost like a shoulder cape. Thesesame stripes ofTelvet ribbon may beused to advantage as loops hangingfrom the waist over a pleated tunic.When the ribbon is looped, the satinbacked ribbon is used, as both sidesare shown. When the velvet is sewnflat, as an edge to a tunic, for instance, the stain-backed velvet ribbonis, of course, unnecessary.This month should find you withthin and transparent frocks formerly called lingerie frocks.' This seasonin Paris these lingerie frocks havebecome dresses of white tulle, charming creations that eliminate the laundry bill. However, a very charminggown of tubable crepon has threescalloped flounces worn over a deepmarine-blue foundation skirt of charmeuse. A girdle of charmeuse encircles the waist. It is looped in frontwith two rounded tabs, which are embroidered in Bulgarian colors enriched with gold. The three flounces areedged and embroidered loosely inscallops and flowering design in whitecotton. The long-sleeved blouse isembroidered straight across the neckwith the same design. Bretellesabout four inches wide, likewise embroidered, cross each shoulder, extending from the waist, front andback.Voile is such a practical fabricthat it has largely taken the place ofsheer lawns and organdies for theserviceable and dressy frocks. A verycharming little dress of black-and-whitestriped voile has a straight-hanging skirt gathered to a highwaistline worn with surplice sashblouse having long tight-fitting sleevesA Basque Dess Whose Combinationof Taffeta and Satin Adds Style toCorrect Simplicity.of white voile. The effect of thisblouse is exquisitely soft and the fulness inside of blousing fits the figurein soft folds. The sleeves give exactlythe effect of mousquetaire gloves. Asthe surplice of the blouse breaksabout the waist in a sash effect, noother belt is neccessary. Over this isworn a charming cape which hangsfrom the shoulders in the back andfits like a sleeveless bolero in thefront. This is made of black Pftkinchiffon velvet. It is lined with whitecharmeuse. The front fastening is apassementerie ornament, from whichhang two long narrow yet elaboratetassels, A white collar of double organdy not too high and slightly bentback, follows the line of the capefrom the point of its closing over theblouse to the low dropped line at theback -of the neck.YOUNG WIFE THINKS SHEIS ENTITLED TO VACATION.Detectives Luhn and Pflug, Fridayarrested Mrs. Jessie Mulligan, 19, asshe stepped from a train at the UnionCentral depot in Cfricmnati.

For example, it has some requests that it has not as yet beenable to fill and on the other hand ithas some excellent stock listed forwhich buyers have not been securedas yet. It is surprising, however, inspite of the dry weather and other unfavorable conditions to notice theheavy demand for both gradee andpure bred stock.By way of explanation to those notfamiliar with the workings of the livestock exchange of the ExperimentStation, the, following statementmight be made. The Extension Department of the Station was organized to devise efficient means of carrying helpful information to farmers,and otherwise operating to improvethe condition of the Kentucky farmer.Among the activities engaged in bythis, department have been the issuingof special press notices, conductingshort courses both at the AriculturalCollege and in various places overthe State where the interest is greatenough to warrant it, the organization of farmers' and breeders' associations, conducting educational agrircultural exhibits at county and otherfairs and exhibitions, the conductingof boys encampments, etc., for agricultural instruction, the installationof county agricultural agents, the organization of boys' and girls' clubs,the organization and systematic instruction of clover and alfalfa clubs,demonstrations in reclamation ofworn out soils, itinterant advisorywork the rejuvenation of old orchards, spraying and pruning demonstations and general horticultural improvement work, the building of barnsand silos and general dairy improvement work, the introduction of agriculture in schools, and other such enterprises too numerous to mention.One of the most recent undertakings is the above mentioned livestock exchange which acts as a medium for those who wish to buy andsell. No fees are charged. No responsibility is assumed by this department, as its only effort is to putthe prospective buyer and seller incommunication, leaving them to maketheir own trade. This is a servicethat, should interest and help everyfarmer in the State, but it takes cooperation to make such a thing go.The farmer can help not alone by listing stock or offering to buy, but if heknows of a prospective buyer or sellerhe should inform this office and likewise the interested party. Farmershave been accused of being indifferentas regards the betterment of farmconditions, but this should not obtain when it comes to an enterprisewhose success depends upon the cooperation of the farmers themselves.Just now we are in great need of agrade Shorthorn or Red Polled bull,several hundred Herford heifers,four grade Percheron mares, twentycalves of beef breeds or grades, anumber of pure bred Angus cattle,Southdown and Shropshire sheep anda number of Jersey heifers and cows.On the sale list is a large assortmentbut none happened to suit the aboveprospective purchasers. The farmersof Kentucky can make this exchangetheir most valuable medium or theycan make a quick failure of an organization intended to help them.T. R. BRYANT.Head of Dept. of Agricultural Extension Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station.ABOUT CUTTING TOBACCOForty-nine years ago I began growing tobacco. A few years later I decided that there were certain daysbetter than others on which to cut tobacco for it to cure up nicely and havea rich, waxy and heavy body. To findout the way to tell these dates, andto tell them ahead has been a hardjob, but I have finally succeeded..To explain, let me say that tboaccohas an oily substance which is its natural possession. It has a sap (water)like other vegetation. When the sapraises, it runs the oil out through thepores of the, leaves, on the principlethat oil and water won't mix, and oilbeing the lighter is pushed out by thesap. Tobacco cut and cured in thisstate will be light and "chaffy" yousee, there is nothing but sap in the tobacco and when cured this sap isgone. It evaporates and leaves thetobacco light and worthless. But tocut tobacco when the sap is down andthe oil has full sway, you can cure itup nicely and with a heavy body; itwill be rich and "waxy." This happens because the tobaccois full of oilinstead of sap, and the oil can't evaporate and remains in 'the leaf tomake it rich and heavy.It has been my experience that wemust cut tobacco when tnere is on init, if we expect to have oil in it whenScured. For instance, you have experienced cutting one week and haveexcellent luck and then cut a few dayslater, probably off the samevpiece ofground and with riper tobacco, andhave no luck at all.I shall be, pleased to answer anycorrespondence from tobacco growerswho want to write me, providedpostage is sent for reply.Yours truly,D.

That girlhad a whole familyto support on $6 aweek. What' does the Newport girl.do? There is nothing she needs.There is' no temptation she mustmeet. There is this difference.

I am told in Newport that one man there spends onchampagne alone $40,000 a year. Ifthat money were spent on reformingjuveniles, it would keep half a thousand boys or girls out of jail.
