He would make the people believe that the tobacco trust decisionpractically solves the trust probleip.He complacently assumes that thisdecision is certain at some indefiniteperiod to restore competition and soften the evils of illegal monopoly if itdoes not Jndeed completely eradicatethem.Once again, therefore, the Presidentis found advocating in a message toCongress a cause that is not popularwith the people, forthe merest tryo inthe study of trusts recognizes the tobacco trust "dissolution" as a victoryfor that monopoly. That even Wallstreet so considers it is evidenced bythe fact that the securities of the tobacco trust are higher after the "dissolution" than before."The punishment incited apjn theAmerican Tobacco Company for beingin existence in violation of the law,"declares Chairman Stanley of the steel! investigating committee, "is worthhundreds of millions cf dollars to thatconcern. There is not a trust in theUnited States or in the world whichwould not give millions to b9 'disolved' as it has been dissovled."And the President devotes his official message to Congress to an attemptto make it appear that this tobaccotrust decision is a great victory forthe independent tobacco men and thepicple. ZZNo Man is StrongerThan His StomachA strong man is strong all over. No man can bestrong who is suffering from weak stomach with itsconsequent indigestion, or from some other diseaseof the stomach and its associated organs, which impairs digestion and nutrition. For when the stomachis weak or diseased there is a loss of the nutritioncontained in food, which is. the source of all physicalstrength. When a man "doesn't feel just right,"nin Uo. (inocn'f dwn w1t Vtotf nn uncomfortablefeeling in the stomach after eating, is languid, nervous, irritable and despondent, he is losing the nutrition needed to make strength.Such a man should use Dr. Pierce's Golden MedicalDiscovery. It cures diseases of the stomach and other sorgans of digestion and nutrition. It enriches theblood,invigorates the liver, strengthens the kidneys, nqurjshegthe nerves, and so GIVES HEALTH 2UVD STREXGTH-TOTHE WHOLE BODY.You can't afford to accept a secret nostrum as a substitute for this nonalcoholic medicine of known composition, not even though the urgent dealermay thereby make a little bigger profit.

T. Brooks, Agent.A Dreadiul WoundHoliday Fire Hazards.Fire insurance hazards multiplyduring the holiday season, owing tospecial electrical displays, Christmastrees in stores and show windows, anda liberal use of cotton snow and otherinflammable decorations. n.very merchant should be specially eaiefulabout fire hazards at this time, notonly because of the danger of interfering with his trade at the mostprotfiable season of the year, but because of his responsibility to the public through endangering the lives ofthe holiday throngs. The most serioushazard at holiday t.imp. is tht Hhrisr- imas tree filled with lighted tapers and ;likely to be overturned, and thefhurriedelectric wiring put up for sperial displays. Trees should be intsalled sothat they cannot possibly be overturned, and electric lights should be usedin place of candles. The latter are always dangerous especially after thetree gets dried out in a warm room.Electric lighting fires are due almostinvariablyto the practice cf allowing Iemployes not familiar with the elec-ltrie hazard to install displays :n show !windows and other places. The wiresare frequently run over nails, whichwear ott the insulation and startblazes, cotton batting and tinsel isallowed to come into contact withlamps and their (receptacles, and circuits are frequently overloaded byspecial displays and thus made dangerous. The Boards of Underwriters areglad to pass upon all holiday electricwiring plans in order to diminish thelosses from fire, and merchants generally should confer with their insurancemen and should be certain that theelectric wiring is done by competentmen. Otherwise they may impairtheir fire insurance protection, as thepolicies provide that if there is amaterial increase in hazard, withoutpermission, the insurance shall be void.The holiday season ia a good time lormerchants to begin to enforce "nosmoking" rules, and to be especiallycareful about the prompt removal ofboxes, paper and all inflamable rubbish,GEO.

JameaOliver., San Antonio, Tex. Godfrey ReeseFowler, who has just attained muchfame in the revolutionary arm of Nicaragua at the head of the Estradaforces, is well known in San Antonio.About three years ago he came toSan Antonio quietly and tried to enlist a number of former Philippine veterans for service in a Central American revolution which was planned.To some he offered commissions andto others he offered places in theranks at attractive salaries. He secured five men here. They went toCentral America, but the revolutionfailed to develop and xe returned toTexas.Mr. Fowler enlisted in the Thirtythird infantry at San Antonio, whereit was being organized by Col. LutherR, Hare, and during that time hemade many friends. In outward appearance he gives no evidence of being a man loving daring" adventureand seems to fit perfectly into thenon-exciting place of court reporter.His history has been one of romance. Even before the outbreak ofthe Spanish-American war he had areputation in the Texas militia.An incident which occurred whilehe was commanding a company whichwas sent to protect a negro from mobviolence shows admirably the makeup of the man.He was at that time the commanderof a company at Palestine. He wasordered to Henderson to protect anegro from mob violence. The negrowas found there and rushed to thepenitentiary to avoid a mob whichwas coming down from Longview.All east Texas was in a fever heat.After a day spent at Rusk the troopscarried the negro to Nacogdoches.When that town was reached the company marched into a mob of 5,000 enraged citizens.Fowler was not excited. He placedthe negro in the center of the company and began the march to the jail.The citizens surrounded the companyand hooted and jeered and threatenedto take the negro away. Fixed bayonets was all that kept them back.When Fowler reached the jail stepsand had the negro safely on the inside he turned to the mob and said:"You men can all go to h 1. I'dlike to see this nigger hung-as much' ?rjfc'5L.''viPffI. S AOriginal Home of Honey Bee.The common variety of bee. knownas the honey-bee.

"Principally doingtime, madam." . , .The Citizens Hooted and Jeered.as you would, but you fellers are riotgoing to hang him."Although the mob was infuriated toa high pitch and although Fowler'stone and words were not calculatedto pour oil on troubled waters, themen stood there quietly, althougharmed with shotguns and pistols, andafter a time dispersed. The negrowas hanged the next afternoon, but itwas only after he was tried at a special term of the district court convened by the district judge and legally convicted.Fowler is only 33 years old. Heholds a commission as major on Gov.Campbell's staff. At the outbreak ofthe Spanish-American war he was captain and quartermaster in the Texasmilitia. When the Second Texas infantry was mustered in he was assigned to command a company andserved in Cuba under Col. L. M. Oppenheimer. After tlie Spanish-Americanwar he went to the Philippinesas a captain in the Thirty-third volunteer regiment commanded by Col.Luther R. Hare.For bravery in action in capturingthe pueblo of Vigan in the Philippineshe was breveted major. Ke was mentioned on more than ten occasions forbravery on the field of action.-He also distinguished himself inthe Philippines for his defense at apueblo called San Antonio.

" sSTRANGE STORY TOLD OF HAUNTED CLUBHOUSE ON AN OLDRACE TRACK.Columbus, Ind. In East Columbus,a suburb, there was once a race trackand the clubhouse, which was near thetrack, still stands.Until recently the clubhouse was occupied by a family, but now it is vacant and some of the people who livein the neighborhood believe that it ishaunted.They say that although the windowsmay be bolted tight at night, the samewindows will be found open the nextmorning, with all the doors locked.Strange noises are heard in thehouse at all times of the night, andit is said that a light is seen movingInternational GasolineENGINES.Comes Back at Midnight to Searchfor the Ten-Dollar Bill.from room to room. A few nights agoa party of venturesome young menfirst inspected the housejtond saw thatall windows were tightlynocked.They hid in a neighboring shed towatch, but saw nothing after a waitof several hours, and then decided togo home.One of them suggested a closer Inspection of the building before theyleft the scene, and when they approached the house they found thatevery window was unlocked and wideopen. The boys fled for home.Attorney Roy W. Emig of this city,who was reading clerk in the senateat the last session of the Indiana legislature, used to live in the clubhouse,and he intimates that there is somefoundation for the ghost stories.Emig says several years ago one ofthe rooms in the building was used asa barroom and that gambling was frequent. One night, according to thestory, a drunken brawl broke outduring a hieronymous game and a manwas shot just as he was putting a tendollar bill on the deuce.According to Emig's story, the ghostof that man comes back to the clubhouse every night at midnight tosearch for the ten-dollar bill, whichwas dropped the night he was shotand killed.BARTENDER AS AN AUTOCRATIn the Philippines the Drink MixerIs a Personage of Some Consequence.In the olden days, the city of theDon, every merchant in the islandswas at times his own money maker.If he was short of cash to meet apressing demand, he simply sent his"chit" (an American, expression),called in Spanish a vale, which wasnothing more nor less than a penciledI. O. XL, to his neighbor for any sumfrom one peso up into the thousands.However, much to our discredit,Americans as a rule so much abusedthe "chit" system that this crude formof currency is now rarely accepted,excepting at bars and restaurants. Referring to barrooms, one naturally recalls the American bartender as he isin the islands. There lie is verymuch an autocrat; and, like the Spaniard, he will not wet or soil his jeweled hands. An unsavory calling hereat home, it is a dignified one in Manila. There the barkeeper sits infront of the bar bedecked usually inspotless white from head to foot, witha diamond or two of awkward sizeglittering above his cravat. Most ofhis time is spent hobnobbing with thecustomers, especially with the moneyed ones. He takes a drink everytime anyone else does, not forgettingto order a round on the house periodically. He is a sort of walking floormanager, a -jovial host, and an allround good fellow. Numerous Filipino boys, working behind the barand at the tables, do his every command, Monroe Woolley in the Bookkeeper.
