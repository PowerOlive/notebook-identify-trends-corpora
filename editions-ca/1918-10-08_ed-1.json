HUDDLESTON.
The supreme sacrifice is not al
ways made on the battlefield,-and
heroes have been kndwn to- live and
die in other places than the sanguin
ary', or "along the firing line
where' the hot breath of war. scorches
and sears hunianity. , It has fallen to
the fate-of a Bourbon county ooy,
Sergeant William Allen Huddleston,
to give up his life after a futile strug
gle in an army camp hospital.
' News was received here some days
ago to the effect that Sergeant Hud
dleston. was '"seriously ill with pneumonia-
in -the base hospital at Camp
Zachary Taylor, where he had been
stationed for several months. His
mother, Mrs. Mozelle Huddleston, and
his sister, Miss Madeline 'Huddleston,
immediately motored to the cajmp,
where they found Sergt. Huddleston
in a critical condition. They remain
ed with him until the end came at an
early hour Saturday morning. The
body was brought to his late home
on Stoner avenue, in this city Sun
day. Sergt. Huddleston was a former at
tache of THE NEWS, having at one
time been one of the efficient carriers
of this paper. He later went into the
railroad business and was flagman on
one of the through trains running
frqm Cincinnati to Knoxville, Tenn.
He enlisted in the infantry service,
and was sent to Camp Zachery Tay
lor, where he made a good record as
a soldier. On many of his vacation
trips to Paris he. always referred with
pride to the fact that he was in the i
service. Although his mother was a
widow, who depended, to a large ex
tent, on him for support, neither he
or his mother. asked for deferred
classification, being too patriotic to
place self-interest above service to
their country.
The funeral was held at the family
home, on Stoner avenue, yesterday
afternoon' at three o'clock, with ser
vices conducted by Rev. George H.
Harris, of Versailles, former rector of
St. Peter's Episcopal church in this
city. The burial followed on the
family lot in the Paris Cemetery. At
the grave additional services were
held. As the casket was lowered into
the grave "taps" were sounded by
the buglers of the Boy Scouts. The
funeral procession was headed by a
guard of honor cojmposed of the Boy
Scouts, members of the A. T. S. C.
coips from Camp Buell, Lexington,
and the Liberty Drum and Bugle
Corps. Along the line blinds of bus
iness houses were drawn as a mark
of respect. The pall-bearers at the
funeral were Ben Parker, George M.
Kiser, Thos. Kiser, Douglas Thomas,
Jr., J. T. Tucker and Robt. Manwar
ing. Sergt. Huddleston was a son of the
late Mr. Louis Huddleston, who was
for many years associated in the car
riage business in Paris with Mr. John
W. Holiday. His mother, Mrs. Mo
zelle Huddleston, and two sisters,
Miss Madeline Huddleston, of this
city, and Mrs. Elizabeth Smith, of
Rush, Colo., survive him, also an
aunt, Mrs. Edward Caldwell, of Paris.

CAMPAIGN TOR TEACHING MATE
EIAL STARTED.
To prevent a shortage of teachers
in the public schools of this State
Professor I. H. Booth of the Eastern
Normal School has been designated to
call on the school superintendents in
sixty-nine counties in Eastern Ken
tucky and request them to select pu
pils from the common schools and
send them to the Eastern Normal
schools for training. Fear is ex
pressed that there will be a shortage
of at least 30 per cent in teachers
next year unless the precautionary
measures are taken as are suggested
by Professor Booth. He was in con
ference with Superintendent of
Schools Gilbert recently.

THOMSON- BOHON.
Paris friends of Miss Catherine
Thomson, formerly of Paris, have re
ceived cards announcing her marri
age to Mr. Wm. Cecil Bohon at
Franklin, Indiana, on" October 1. The
cards read as follows:
"Mr. and Mrs. Edward Gill Breuer
announce the marriage of their niece
Miss Catherine VanArsdell Thomson!
to
Mr. William Cecil Bohon
on Tuesday, the first day of October,
one thousand nine hundred and eigh
teen, Franklin, Indiana."

after the fifteenth of October,
Decatur, Illinois."
The bride will be remembered here
as a student and later an assistant
at Bourbon College, of which her par
ents, Prof, and Mrs. M. G. Thomson,
were principals. She is an attractive
young woman, an accopnplished musi
cian, whose many friends here wish
her a long life of unalloyed happi
ness. GETTING UP IN THE MORNING.
Getting up at three o'clock in the
morning was the toughest feature of
his job in France declares Walter C.
Plank, a Y. M. C. A. (man who has
just returned to his home in Jerome
ville, O., after ten months' service
overseas. From other sources it Is
learned that most of the time Plank
was in France he was in "Y" huts
and dugouts under almost incessant
shell fire. But he feared.the German
Big Berthas less than he did his own
Big Ben.
7lHow I used to groan when the
call came," says Plank, "because I
never was an early bird by choice.
But when I thought of those younger
men soon to come in fropi their long
night of trench duty I jumped out
from under the covers and into my
clothes and by the time they arrived
at the "Y" hut the coffee and choco
late were steaming on the stove.
"If the American people could see
the satisfaction rendered the fighting
men by this simple service they'd dig
twice as deeply into their pockets
when comes the Noveniber United
War Work Campaign drive."
