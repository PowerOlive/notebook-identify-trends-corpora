The student body is a veryattractive and earnest group of people, and constitute in the main ambitious, energetic and really leadingteachers of Bourbon county.There are a number of reasonsfor which I am proud of this summer school. In the first place, theschool was so successful last yearthat teachers had every reason tobelieve that it would be even better this year. The State University,under whose auspices the school wasconducted last year, reported toCfotn QnTf nlirin liof fVio oiityi-..,.,.. .mci otuuui uciu iixoi a Unimex iu.Paris was the best county summerschool held in Kentucky last year.This should be evidence enough toconvince any teacher that the schoolwill be even a greater success thisyear, having last year's experienceon which to build. The second reason is that the Paris summer schoolhas one of the very strongest faculties of any institution in Kentucky.Prof. J. W. Lancaster, the principal,is one of the outstanding school menin the State. His work at thehead of the Millersburg school, hisleadership among the teachers of.this county since he has been amongus, his successful handling of thesummer school last summer, and infact, his scholarship, experience anddevotion to his profession ought tobring to this school practically 100per cent, attendance of the teachersof Bourbon county and adjoiningterritory, whose educational attainments are less than a standard college degree.The fact that Prof. Clarence C.Freeman, of Transylvania College, isa member of this faculty ought toappeal very strongly to every teacher in this section of the State. Prof.Freeman is too great a scholar andtoo well known in Central Kentuckyfor me to attempt" to add anythingto what you already know of him.Personally I do not think that it ispossible for the teachers of Kentucky to study under any man morecapable of giving them helpful leadership than Prof. Freeman.Prof. J. C. Jones, of the University of Kentucky, is one of the mostbrilliant of the younger teachers onthe faculty at the University ofKentucky. He is a master of arts,graduate of Columbia University andhad had unusual opportunities forthe study of history and government. Miss Edith Stivers everybodyknows is a remarkably strong teacher of science and she is giving someof the best courses this summer thatshe has ever given.Miss Nannie B. Clark, of the Millersburg schools, is giving work inprimary supervision and penmanship. Miss Clark at one time wascounty supervisor in this county,and you all know how well she always does her work.Miss Grace Cruikshank, a graduate of the 'University of Kentuckyand a special graduate in physicaleducation, and in plays and games.The teachers who are missing thiswork will perhaps never know howmuch they have missed. But thetragedy of the situation is the lossthat must come to the little country child's fall and winter when itis robbed of the pleasure that mightbe its if all teachers knew the thingsthat Miss Cruikshank is teachingthose in her class.Prof. J. M. McVey, the county superintendent bf Bourbon countyschools, is working hard for the betterment of the schools, and of theteachers of this county. He is anable and conscientious leader andhas already accomplished a greatamount of good for the schools. Itis his desire that Bourbon countyteachers have better educationaladvantages than are afforded teachers in an other county of the State,and personally I think that he hasgiven you a school right here inParis not excelled in the State. Thisschool is offering college and highschool courses, primary supervisionand all of the drill subjects, and inaddition to these subjects you canget courses in both high school andcollege education. The State of Kentucky has appropriated the money toassist in carrying on these schools.If the teachers do not show themselves interested in this effort of theState to heip them this appropriation from the State will be discontinued. Kentucky will always standforty-fifth or lower among the Statesof the Union unless our teachersfeel more keenly their duty to improve their scholarship. Last weekin one school system in Kentuckythirty-six teachers were dismissedbecause they had failed to bring uptheir scholarship within the required time. Teachers "are beingdismissed all over the country forfailing to improve their scholarshipand this is as it should be.Teachers may enter the Bourboncounty summer school and still getfull credit, and I do sincerely trustthat the teachers of this section willavail themselves of this opportunity.I hope that the teachers of this 'section will stop and think of the seriousness of the situation, and realizewhat they owe to the profession andto the children of this county. I cannot see how you can justify yourselfin remaining out of school if it isphysically possible for you to attend.The livefljOf children must suffer if Jtne teacners or Kentucky do not imMILLERSBURGiInteresting News Items Prom Bourbon County's College Town,Mrs. C.

The following statement should carry conviction to the mind of every Parisreader.Mrs . John Mastin, 1439 Highstreet. Paris, says: "I have usedDoan's Kidney Pills with good results. I had a dull aching acrossthe small of my back and my kidneys acted irregularly. The use ofDoan's Kidney Pills rid me of thesecomplaints and I have faith enoughin them that should I ever need akidney remedy again I would certainly use Doan's Kidney Pills."'Mrs. Mastin gave the above statement November 9, 1916, and on November 13, 1920, she added: "I stillhave the same good opinion ofDoan's Kidney Pills as when I eridorsed them before. I use them occasionally when I require a kidneytonic and they never fail to do megood."Price 60c, at all dealers. Don'tsimply ask for a kidney remedyget Doan's Kidney Pills the samethat Mrs. Mastin had. Foster-Milburn Co., Mfrs., Buffalo, N. Y.(adv)oIN THEGOOD OLDTIME-SUMMEEThis year summer heat beat thebarrier. Summer enters to find itsattendants already present.There is one thing about the arrival of summer. There is nothing wecan do about it. One can raveabout the heat, but the sunshines all the brighter. He canswat mosquitoes but the tribe increases. He can curse the mercurybut the silver thread defies him.. About the only thing that thosewho dislike the hot season can do isto observe the conventional dont's"and try to forget it.Either the seasons were createdwith a purpose or evoluted into theirpresent status without any excusewhatever. But here they are.Grumbling won't help matters.Let us rather join in welcomingthe days when we can "hear thecorn growing," when the grain isgiven its golden crest, when the vacation draws closer, when thex riverbeckons and the brevity of the bathing suit doesn't matter, when "thedays of real sport" are with us, themeadows are in bloom and the birdsmake nrasic all the day.oCol.

Would you think it fair for the public to encourage thefellow by patronizing him after they knew allthe facts in your case? Of course, you wouWknot, and nobody else would uphold such dirty work.Now, then, this is exactly what we are up against. After several months of faithfulservice to the public, making many trips at a loss to us, and remember, after our competitoras well as a second party, ran over this route for several weeks, but gave it up as a failureWE stuck to the job and finally put our business upon a paying basis. Not until then comesalong our competitor with his red Bus to take away the fruits of pur labor by running a fewminutes ahead of our schedule. It would be bad enough if he would at least give the public:double service by running one or two hours between our schedule, his sole aim seems to be "Tadrive us off the line."Do you believe he is doing right? Should you or any one else encourage him by riding;on liis Bus? Put yourself in our place, and you will have the right answer. Of course, thereis mo law by which to reach our case, but God has given every man a conscience by which, to?knW right from wrong. Let this unwritten law guide you to . stand for principle and patronize our Yellow Bus. You can well afford to let the Red Bus pass and wait a few minutes forours, as we feel it our dutrto stick to our advertised schedule and never disappoint our pat-'rons by leaving ahead of time.We thank our friends and patrons who have stood by us so nobly and will always; proveour appreciation ,by giving you the.best service possible.Yours for a Square Dea " jREO COMFORT BUS LINE; 'Fred Weckesser.Organized under the provisions of the Federal Parm loan ActThe LoanTliat Never Comes Due"Unless and until the borrower wishes to pay itLoans on farm property on the amortization plan for a term of 40yeass in amounts ranging from $1,000 to' $45,000, at 6. $66.46 peryear on each $1,000 of 3oan pays both principal and interest."liberal prepayment privileges.No commissions no renewals.Pot further information -write or callAsk Peoples Deposit Bank &Trust Co., Paris, or NorthMiddletown Deposit Bank,North Middletown.Kentucky Joint Stock Land BankSecurity Trust Building Lexington, KentuckyOPERATED THTDE GOVERNMENT SUPERVISIONOPFICERSC.

AND THEDENTPEESI-Rare days in June, July and August, tempt nature lovers into thewoods and fields and by the sides ofbabbling brooks. Frequently theyreturn to undergo several days ofacute torment due to attacks ofchiggers, the tiny mites whose larvaeattach themselves to the skin in anyexposed spot.The bureau of Entomology of theUnited States Department of Agriculture has made a careful study ofthe habits of chiggers and methodsof control, and suggests two waysof reducing the discomfort, caused"tfy chiggers.The first step is to clothe the feetand ankles properly when going intothe woods where chiggers are likelyto occur, by wearing heavy high-toppedboots instead of low shoes, thickstockings or even spiral puttees. Thesecond method is to apply repellentseither directly on the skin or on thehose and undergarments before starting out for a "hike" or a picnic.Flowers of sulphur is ordinarily usedfor this purpose. A hot bath with athick lather of soap taken iramediately after returning from an outingoften kills chigger larvae on ' thebody.Palliatives, such as sulphur ointment, alcohol, ammonia, cookingsoad, dilute solution of iodine, orcamphor are of use chiefly becauseof their acaricide or mite-killing action, or because of their antisepticquality, or for both reasons.With proper respect for the opinions of Democrats who think thatthe Democratic party would be in abetter position for 1924 if it cutdown the Republican majority inHouse of Representatives this fallthan it would be if the Democratselected a majority of the House, webeg to differ and to offer the following facts in connection with precedent: The first President of the UnitedStates elected by the Democratsfollowing the Civil War was Samuel J. Tilden, 1876; we did not seathim but we elected him. In 1874,the Democrats carried the House.The next Democratic Presidentwas Grover Cleveland in 1884. In1882 the Democrats carried theHouse.The next Democratic Presidentwas Grover Cleveland in 1892. In1890 the Democrats carried theHouse.The next Democratic Presidentwas Woodrow Wilson in .1912. In1910 the Democrats carried theHouse.The next Democratic Presidentwas Woodrow Wilson in 1916. In1914 the Democrats "carried theHouse, as they did in 1912.The only time the precedent wasbroken was in 1888 when Harrisonwas- elected against Cleveland whowas running the second time. TheDemocrats carried the House inIS 8 6, and alothough they lost out inthe presidential election in 1888,Cleveland had a majority of the popular vote that year. So, in a manner of speaking, the precedent wasonly partly broken.It was a good thing for the Democratic party to have the House in1874, 1882, 1890, 1910 and 1914,and it will be equally good, in ouropinion, to have the House in 1922.And remember that all the signsthis year say: "This is a DemocraticYear."WHISKAWAY WINNER IN BIG$50,000 EACEWhiskaway, Harry Payne Whitney's great colt, which a week agogave Morvich the only defeat of hisracing career repeated the triumphSaturday, when he swept past thewire, winner of the $50,000 SpecialLatonia race for three-year-olds before a record-breaking crowd of 50,000 persons.The chestnut son of WhiskbroomII defeated the best field the Nationcould send against nim in whatprobably was the greatest rafce forthree-year-olds staged in a decade.Will Perkin's Thibodeaux, a rankoutsider in the betting, and a Kentucky-bredhorse, finished secondin a driving finish with Whiskaway,crossing the wire a half length be-ninci tne winner.

Well within the , lifetime ofmany now living the negro race waspractically totally ignorant, its activities confined entirely to day labor in the fields, its ideals represented by a1 place to sleep and something to eat, its ambitions nothingbeyond creature comfort.In the Nation's Capital the seventh annual negro race congress hasjust come to aa end. This congress,organized in September, 1916, hasfor its main purpose the uplifting ofthe colored race. Through its channels have been spread doctrines andideals for the inspiration of the colored people. Prominent negro educators, lawyers, physicians, and business men attended. Questions affecting the social, economical, civic,intellectual and moral life of thecolored race were discussed and adeclaration of principles for theAmerican negro adopted. Prof. Kelly Miller, of Harvard University,chairman of the commission whichdrafted the principles, said that it'is the aim of the congress to. makethem the aims and ideals of therace. ,& - j& & ' if uIs it not a wonderful record forless than sixty years?

If evereducation had a triumph, it is in thework the schools have done in promoting the welfare of the negrorace, and thus the welfare of allAmericans, who have found in thenegro school, the negro college, thenegro university, the means formaking those who were slaves andchattels, useful citizens.A SLOW BEGINNERTHE PARTNERSHIP SPIRITThe thing that has broken upmany farm homes has been lack ofpartnership between the farmer andhis boys. Father might call thecalf the property of his boy, butwhen the calf was sold father tookthe cash. The boys under such conditions grew up to feel that theyhad no share in the farm.The astute farmer makes his boyhis partner from the day he is oldenough to hold and operate gardentools or feed any farm animal. Hegives that boy something of his veryown, from which he can reap hisown personal reward. As that boygrows up his share, of the farm enterprise constantly increases. Thatboy will not usually go off anywhereelse.0 .There Was a Reason.Jimmy was visiting his aunt, whowas a good cook, and he enjoyed everymeal. One day after an unusuallygood dinner he glanced at his threecousins, who were fat and rosy, andsaid: "I know now jwhy you got suchfat kids."0 ,A spiritualist says there . are no"flappers" in heaven. If that is true,lots of young men will losei their de-lsire to go there. v"Sands of Pleasure moved up witha rush after being far out of it forthe first half mile and wore downTomahoi in the last sixteenth."Thus the race chart repeats whathos come to be an old story to turfpatrons who know the horses as individuals rather than as mere namesand numbers. Tomahoi happened tobe the victim in this instance. Butbetter horses have been surprisedand chargined by the final onrush ofthe old campaigner.The list of the slow beginnersamong the racers is extensive. Manysteeds able to close with a rush areunable to get into winning stride until the race is nearly over. Thencomes what the turf writers sometimes call the "belated rattle," theterm being used when the spurt isjust short of overtaking the leader.The slow beginner gives his backers great concern as he lags at thebarrier and trails his field. The experienced players learn to expect thedevelopment of great speed near thefinish line, but it is a real strain ona weak heart to await the signs ofincreased velocity. However, theslow beginner is more of a horseman's horse than is the front runner. This latter type, asexemplifiedby Refugee II and Flip, leap away atthe rise of the barrier. They quicklyget a lead of a dozen lengths andthe novices in the stand are convinced that the race'isover. But thefront runners seldom hold their advantage. Slowly but surely the gapcloses and the steadier horses comeon relentlessly.The front runner as a rule 'isfaint-hearted. He runs his race ifno severe opposition is met, butwill quit when collared. The idealracer gets away promptly and runsan even race, clicking along at arate calculated to wear down thefront runners and ward off the terrific attack of the slow beginners.Sands of Pleasure could not 'hope tobeat Firebrand or Exterminator,but in lesser company he is alwaysworth consideration.Incidentally, the old horse musthave a world of courage and determination. He has won many an apparently hopeless contest and itmust give him a glimpse of horseheaven to win m the last few lunging strides.TRIBUTE TO MEMORY OF DR. J.N.

Thefight at Boonesboro, the battle of theBlue Licks, the 'defense of Bryan'sStation are the events which firstoccur to us, probably because theyoccured in our vicinity. There arenumerous others which will presentthemselves to those familiar withKentucky's history.Some event occurring later, afterKentucky became a State, might bemore dramatic than those in thedays of Daniel Boone, George Rogers Clark, the Logans and otherpioneers.The period 'of the Civil War shouldnot be overlooked, although few ofits battles -were fought on Kentuckysoil. The State t sent large numbers of volunteers to the war of1812 and the Mexican War, and theytook a glorious part therein, buttheir services to the country wererendered in other States than Kentucky.

O. PADDOCK,(It) Box 201, Kansas City,. Mo.,EASY MATTEE TO SAY "THANKYOU"When the telephones-operator hasbeen helping one through a difficulttoll connection and the conversation successfully concluded, it makesa favorable impression to call herup and say that you are much obliged for all her trouble after havingfirst ascertained that she is in condition to stand the shock.Now the usual procedure in sucha case is to take good-luck forgranted as our due, and to kick likesteers when luck is bad. This isthe worst kind of sportsmanship. Itresults, when ill luck does come, infeeling and behaving as if we weremonstrously abused ana jjbisuicu,when; by dwelling on the small morsels of satisfaction, which come withevery day and every hour, it is possible to store up enough serene temper to tide over the rainy days.To call up the operator and saywe appreciate the courtesy shown is,first of all, good manners.
