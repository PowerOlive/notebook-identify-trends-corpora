As You Go.
"Clear up as you go" Is an excellent
text to work by a parallel to "Nev
er put off till tomorrow," &c and
one that many a mother would do
well to keep over before her and live
up to. It is the putting-off habit that
leads to accumulations, to hurry, and,
consequently, to badly done work. If
clothes need repairing, let them be re
paired at once; if things are out of
their proper places, put them back
again, where they ought to be; before
they are irretrievably lost.
Their Particular Sin.
A school lor poor children having
read in their chapter in the Bible the
denunciations against hypocrites who
"strain at a gnat and swallow a. cam
el," were afterwards examined by the
benevolent patroness, Lady , as to
their recollection of the chapter.
"What, in particular, was the sin
of the Pharisees, children?" and the
lady, Ating camels, my lady,"
the prompt reply.

Goat's Milk Highly Valued.
There are scores of foreign writers
and medical experts who advocate the
use ot goat's milk for infants and in
valids. In fact there are sanitariums
in France and Switzerland that give
goat's milk a prominent place m their
systems of care. The milk is special
ly recommended for infants because
of its similarity in composition to
mother's milk.
