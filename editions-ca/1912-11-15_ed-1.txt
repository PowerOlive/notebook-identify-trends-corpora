Wednesdaymorning, at an early hour, entailing aloss estimated at $10,000. The building was entirely consumed by theflames, together with the entireequipment and a large quantity ofseasoned lumber and mill worked ma-ter:al.The fire broke out in the rear of thebuilding and the flames, fanned by abrisk wind, soon enveloped Ithe structure. When the fire deDartment arrived on the scene the fire had gained aheadway that was powerless to check,and the attention of the firemen wasdirected to saving the adjoining property. Trie Dlant.rwhich was owned exclusively by C. V. Higigns, of this city,had been in operation about one year.Associated for a time with Mr. Higginswas Mr. O. E. Edwards, who aboutthree weeks aco withdrew from thefirm.Thomas Higgins, son of Mr. Higgins,was sleeping in the building, and whenthe fire was discovered he experiencedgreat difficulty in escaping from thebuilding. When he awoke the flameswere bursting into his room, and hewas almost overcome by smoke whichissued from the burning timbers.A watchman at the round house ofthe Louisville & Nashville railroadwas the first to discover the fire, and atelephone alarm was sent in. Thedepartment responded promptly, but sorapidly was the building consumed thatany effort to save the building wouldnave been practically useless.The firemen turned their attentionto the building occupied by Mr. JamesBatterton as a grocery on the northside, and near the F. & C. crossing.They succeeded in confining the flamesto the building where they originated,and without any damage to adjacentproperty.The building contained a number ofpieces of the best machinery obtainable, all of which was operated by electricity. Two new electric dynamoswere only recently installed. Everything in the blacksmith shop, whichwas conducted by Mr J. W.'Bramblett,was destroyed. This is the second fireloss which Mr. Bramblett has sustained in the past year, and in each instance he lost all of his equipment.This loss, which is estimated at $500,is almost covered by insurance,In addition to these, William Rion,Henry Hibler and John Dejarnett, employed in the mill, lost all of their toolswhen the mill wps destroyed. An automobile in the shop was also consumedby the flames.The proprietor of the establishmentis unable to account for the fire, asthere had been no fire in the buildinsrduringthe day. The loss on the milland equipment is partly covered by insurance.Dispute Results in Stabbing.Bush Bishop, a larmer, was stabbedseriously though not fatally injuredWednesday morning about nine o'clockby Woodford Snears, a member of thefirm of E.

Spears & Sons, onThird street, and although it is saidthere were several eye witnesses tothe affair the stories are conflicting.It is said that on the morning ofthe trouble Spears called Bishop overthe telephone at his home in thecountry and insisted on the paymentof the account, which was past due,and threatened a suit if a settlementwas not effected. Bishop, it is said,promised to come in and settle the"account on that day.'About nine o'clock he put in his aprjearance at the office and asked oneof the clerks to fill out a check forthe amount of his account. At thattime it is stated he was using veryabusive language toward Spears, whowas in an adjoining room. Hearingthe remarks he went into the officeand the two are said to have engagedin heated words, when bishop askedhim to step on the outtide of the building and settle the matter.On the outside the men engaged in afistic encounter, Bishop securing anadvantage, when Spears drew a knifefrom his pucket, stabbing him.
