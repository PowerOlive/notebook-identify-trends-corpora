Piano and phonograph music was

noon was delightfully spent. The so
cial part of the meeting was one of
of the pleasant features of the occa
sion. Mr. Charles E. Bryan, aged 44,
died at the Taylor House after a brief
illness, about 7:30 p. m. Thursday.
Mr. Bryan was a bachelor ancf occu
pied rooms in the Bryan flat, the prop
erty belonging to him, and took his
meals at the Taylor House. For
quite a long time he has been a suf
ferer from stomach, trouble, which,
in most every attack, brought on a
sympathetic heart trouble. For the
past three months he seemed to be in
failing, health, and many of his
friends did not regard him as being
long for this world. Tuesday evening
he was seized with a light attack with
his stomach and went to his physician
for medicine. Wednesday morning
he felt better but after eating his din
ner at the Taylor House Wednesday
afternoon, just as he was leaving he
house he was seized with another at
tack and fell. He was at once taken
to a room in the house and his physi
cian, Dr. W. G. Dailey, summoned.
Coupled with this attack there was
also a slight stroke of paralysis.
From the time he was stricken he
continued to grow worse until the end.
Mr. Bryan had resided In Millersburg
during his entire life, and was the
only son of the late Mr. and Mrs. G.
W. Bryan, both of whom preceded him
to the grave about eight and ten
years ago. He was a member of one
of the most prominent families in
Central Kentucky, and was a man of
fine intellect. He owned consider
able property in Millersburg, and has
but few relatives, the nearest of kin
being Major W. C. Owens, of Louis
ville, who was elected to Congress
from the Seventh district in 1896,
serving one term, and unless he has
left a will, "Mr. Owens will inherit his
property. However, rumor has it
that he has left a will, and his estate
will go to his second cousin, Mrs. C.
W. 'Corrington, of whom he was very
fond and she of him. Mrs. G. W. Bry
an, mother of the deceased, died at
St. Joseph's Hospital, in Lexington,
while his father died at the Good Sa
maritan Hospital in Cincinnati. All
three members of the Bryan house
hold were interred in the Millersburg
cemetery from the home of Mr. and
Mrs. C. W. Corrington. This is rather
a remarkable coincidence. Mr. and
Mrs. Corrington were very fond of
the entire family, and at all times
in their afflictions their deepest sym
pathies went out to them. Not only
is this true but they did what they
could to alleviate their sufferings and
constantly with them in sickness.
Since the death of Mr. and Mrs. G. W.
Bryan Mr. C. E. Bryan has suffered
more than one attack, and at all such
times was taken to the home of Mr.
and Mrs. Corrington, where he was
lovingly and tenderly cared for. This
is something that is commended by
all who know these good people, and
when the scroll of life is rolled up,
and they have passed their mantles
to other shoulders there surely will be
many stars in their crown.
There will be a regular meeting
of Amity Lodge No. 40, F. & A. M.,
Tuesday evening. At the last meet
ing of the Grand Lodge of Kentucky,
a committee was appointed to compile
a history of the Kentucky lodges. In
pursuance of the ordinance of the
Grand Lodge Amity Lodge appointed
a committee at the recent meeting for
the purpose of preparing a history of
Amitl Lodge. It is especially urged
that all the older members of the
lodge be present, and. come prepeared
to give us something relating to the
early history of Amity Lodge.
