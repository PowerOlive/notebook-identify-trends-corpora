PARTIES IN "HOSS TRADE"
The sale of a "cream-colored walk
ing mare, about 7 years old," is the
cause' of a suit for damages filed with
the Fayette Cicrcuit Clerk, in Lex
ington. John Marr and J. O. Ralls,
of Bourbon county, ask in their peti
tion against A. Hunley, of Boyle
county, for $200 and interest from
February, 1915.
According to the petition, the
plaintiffs entered into a contract in
the middle of January to purchase
the mare in question from Hunley,
paying $500 for the animal. On ac
count of bad weather, they allege,
the mare was not delivered at Lex
ington, the agreed point, for a week,
during which time the animal's eyes
becajme affected.
They protested to Hunley, who, af
ter they had visited him at his home
near Danville, agreed to take the
mare back and pay them $300, and if
a cure was effected, to either return
the animal for the $300, or pay the
plaintiffs. $200 as they should elect.
They chose the $200 later on, when
Hunley reported the mare cured, but
they aver that Hunley refused them
the money.
The sum of $200 and interest from
the date of the contract is asked of
the court.
Robert C. Talbott, of Paris, is at
torney for the plaintiffs" -
