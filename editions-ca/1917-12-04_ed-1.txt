Not only do themanagers of both houses anticipatethe biggest opening day's businessin years to-day, but they will alsobe disappointed if the farmers andgrowers do not receive for theirproduct the highest prices ever paidon the Paris market.Tobacco began coming in to bothhouses on Friday and Saturday,and the houses and floors presentedscenes of the greatest animation asthe assistants helped unload andplace the tobacco in position for theinspection of the buyers and theauctioneers.

The color:md the quality of the weed is unusually good.All commissions on sales at TheNew Independent House at to-day'ssales will be donated to the following good causes: One-half to "OurBoys Iu France Tobacco Fund;"one-fourth to the Bourbon CountyHealth & Welfare League and onefourth to the American Red Cross,ciedit to be eriven to the Paris Chapter.

Many of theyoung men live at fraternity housesco-operatively conducted, therebylessening the living expense and alsosecuring a place where they can entertain their friends.In addition to the universitycourses, the Young Men's ChristianAssociation and private schools conduct evening classes in technics,languages, accountancy, stenography and typewriting, and the usualhigh school studies.Notwithstanding -the drafts formilitary service, practically all theschools in Washington show an increased enrollment this year. Thisis due to the great influx incident tothe war. Ten or twelve thousandnew clerks and other employeeshave been appointed in the departments and this great civilian armyis being added to daily. Stenographers and typewriters and mechanical draftsmen for the service generally, and what are known asschedule clerks, index and catalogueclerks, clerks qualified in statisticsor accounting, and clerks uqalifiedin business administration for theoffice of tne Ordnance Departmentof the Army are in demand.The representatives of the FederalCivil Service Commission at thepostoffice in all cities are receivingnumerous inquiries from personsi who wish to be at the seat ot government at this time of big eventsand to have a part in the actualadministration of the Government'sgreat business.

By strengtheningthese nations and making them, aspowerful and as effective as possiblewe are greatly aiding in the short'ening of the struggle; we are doing' much to insure an ultimate victory:we are doing only that which it Isour duty to do toward our allies Inthis tremendous war against an autocracy which would debase and enslave all nations and men.The fact that we did not advancev.,-c mnnpv much of the work which4.1,., oiii'OI arc nin? would have to i hebe done with American money andAmerican men establishes clearly theintelligence and wsidom of ourpolicy.There is work to be done whichrequires the expenditure of bloodand treasure.
