If s up to the People
Less than a year remains in which
tf gather facts and information that
will influence your vote for the nex
president of the United States
That grievous wrongs have beer
committed and grave errors allowec
to exist without effort at correction i
evidenced by the speech writings and
comments of eminent statesmen and
jurists congressmen and leading men
of business professors and clergymen
in every state
Party affiliations have been ignored
in the outcry against thrusting aside
the safeguards of our fathers and rush
ing pell mell into the affairs of Europe
The situation is a deplorable one if
ot alarming as is also our domestic
affairs dominated by gigantic Trusts
The evils axe not of spontaneous
growth They are the result of years
of labor and expenditure of millions
of dollars Beginning with the dis
placement of American silver for
English gold the cunning of Eng
lands diplomacy in shaping the des
tiny o our Republic is apparent to
any ordinary observer seeking the
rue inwardness of events
The Cincinnati Enquirer has fre
quently called attention to each and
every move as it was transpiring and
during the campaign of 1900 will
present its readers with a truthful
array of facts that will be extremely
interesting and startling
No fair minded American be he
Republican Democrat or of other
political faith can afford at this critical
tone to ignore the truth Partisan
prejudice with the Trusts as dictators
a far more degrading slavery than
that which existed previous to the Civil
War of 61 64
Trusts in the United States alone
fcave a representative capital greater
than all the gold and silver in the
world These will spend many more
millions of dollars to suppress truth
and facts and mislead all who fail to
look beyond their plausible decep
tions Read the Enquirer and you
will be able to discern the truth and
combat falsehood A victory for
Trusts and the McKinley Adminis

Eczema
The Only Cure
Eczema is more than a skin disease
and no skin remedies can cure it The
doctors are unable to effect a cure and
their mineral mixtures are damaging j
to the most powerful constitution lhe
whole trouble is in the blood and
Swifts Specific is the only remedy
which can reach such deep seated blood
diseases
Eczema broke out on my daughter and con
tinued to spread until
her head was entirely
covered She was treated
by several good doctors
but grew worse and the
dreadful disease spread
to her face She was
taken to two celebrated
healtn springs but re
ceived no benefit Many
patent medicines were taken but without re
sult until we decided to try S S Satd by the
time the first bottle was finished her head be
gan to heal A dozen bottles cured her com
pletely and left her skin perfectly smooth She
is now sixteen years old and has a magnificent
growth of hair Not a sign of the dreadful
disease has ever returned
