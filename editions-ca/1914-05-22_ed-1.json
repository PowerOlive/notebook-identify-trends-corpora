US OF M1LLEBSBURG
The commencement exercises of
the M. F. C. were continued Monday
-with the annual concert at the M. F.
C. Auditorium. This, like all the pre--vio:zs
exercises, was well attended.
Advanced pupils of the musical de
partment were given an opportunity
to show what they had done during
the year. The brilliancy of each per
former in many respects surpassed
those of former years. There is no
question but what the members of
the musical faculty are superior
teachers. The vocal numbers of the
work reached its climax in its last
number, "Invitation to the Dance,"
with two pianos and six violins. On
Tuesday morning the M. F. C. Audi
torium was filled to overflowing,
many being compelled to stand dur
ing the entire commencement exer
cises. This was partly due to the
fact that Dr. Crowe was to deliver
the baccalaureate address. His dis
course on Sunday being a logical one
.all lovers of culture were anxious to
hear him again. "At the appointed
time the class of 1914, with the mem
bers of the faculty of the Institute
took their places on the rostrum.
The class was made up of" the follow
ing: Misses Jennie McMillan, A. B.,
Christine Patterson, A. B., Margaret,
Anne Peterson, A. B., Martha Ade
laide Smith, A. B., Mildred Washing
ton Bruce, B. S., Mattie Lydia Bur
ford, B. S., Nell Loraine Hammond,
B. S., Ruth Russell Norris, B. S. Dr.
John M. Crowe, of Pulaski, Va., the
able orator of the occasion, delivered
the baccalaureate address, taking as
his subject "Heroes and Heroines."
His address was a masterly effort,
and many beautiful pictures were
drawn. It was sublime, eloquent and
at the same time practical.
Dr. Fisher awarded the diplomas at
the close of the address in an appro
priate and touching address. The
honor roll was then read. In a short
address Dr. Fisher called attention to
the building of the annex which is to
be erected during the present sum
mer, and appealed to the student
body and all friends of the Institute
to do what they could to enlist the in
terest of new students for next year.
He also announced that in the very
near future the name of the Millers
burg Female College would be
changed to something more appropri
ate. Many of the students and the
faculty left for their respective homes
Tuesday afternoon and evening, and
the remainder left Wednesday.
Dr. W. M. Miller and , family re
turned Wednesday after a two weeks'
visit in Atlanta, Ga.
Mr. William .Peed, of Lexington,
was at the bedside of his brother, Mr.
J. J. Peed, Monday and Tuesday.
Mrs. Mollie Peed, son and daugh
ter, Mr. Alfred Peed and Miss Mary
Peed, of Mayslick, were at the bed
side of Mr. J. J. Peed, Tuesday.
Mrs. O. W. Ingels entertained a
number of her friends Wednesday aft
ernoon with, a buffet luncheon in hon
or of her sister, Mrs. B. H. Dorian, of
Memphis, Tenn.

RENICK.
Miss Elizbeth Renick, the pretty
and attractive daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. B. M. Renick, died in Nashville,
Tenn., Monday evening, from typhoid,
fever.
Since last September she had been
a student at the Ward-Belmont Col
lege, and was making her home with
her aunt, Mrs. Neade Frierson. Six
weeks ago she was stricken with ty
phoid fever, and her mother was
called to her bedside.
She seemed to be on the road to re
covery until about a week ago, when
she suffered a relapse, and in spite
of all the efforts of the most skillful
physicians she continued to grow
worse until 'the end came.
Miss Rnick was born in this city
in September, 1898, and would have
been sixteen years old next Septem
ber. She was a member of the Pres
byterian church, having pcofessed
faith with that denomination at an
early age. For several years she was
a student at tne .fans uity scnooi,
and attended Bourbon College. Later
she entered the private school of Mrs.
Fanniebelle Sutherland, where she
continued until last fall, when she en
tered the Nashville College.
She was a beautiful and accom
plislied young woman, and by her gen
tle manners made a host of friends.
Her death was a severe shock to her
parents, as well as to her numerous
friends, who were devoted to her.
She is survived by one brother, Mr.
Coleman Renick, a student in Center
College, Danville.
Mr", and Mrs. Renick and son were
at her bedside when the end came,
Mr. Renick having been called to that
city Sunday.
The remains were brought to this
city Tuesday afternoon, and taken
to the Renick home on Duncan ave
nue. The funeral services were con
ducted from the residence yesterday
morning at 10 : 30 o'clock by Eld. W.
E. Ellis, and the burial followed in
the family lot in the Paris cemetery.
The following were the pall-bearers:
Jos. M. Hall, John M. Brennan, C. K.
Thomas, Fred Batterton, W, H. Har
ris and Dr. M. H. Dailey.
IN MEMORIAM,
When a beautiful girl like Elizabeth
Renick passes from among us it
leaves a void in our lives which is
difficult to fill. But when we real
ize that she has gone just a little
way from us and that we shall soon
follow on, it leads us to inquire into
her new life and to endeavor to find
in what her new happiness consists.
For the spiritual world never becomes i
quite so near and so real to us asj
when we follow into it our dear
friends and sympathize with them in
the improvements and enjoyments of
that blessed life. What must have
been the joy of our Lord in receiving
her spirit, which has passed through
this world of sore temptation with an
improving virtue. What a delicate
refinement was hers. And how ten
derly she felt for those she loved.
What goodness, what purity, what
sympathy and intensity of love she
ever manifested for her loved ones,
and with it all how gentle and sweet
and lovely. She silently spread
around her that soft, pure light, the
beauty of which, and the power
are never fully known until it is gone.
Her calm, gentle spirit, her sweet and j
loving sympathy and her just and
clear preception of right, fitted her
preeminently for the place which she
held in the hearts of her many friends.
No one who ever knew her well
could easily forget the peculiar, at
tractiveness with which she drew her
friends to herself so gentle, so ten
der, so loving. The world was beauti
ful to her and life was sweet, and she
tried to show her generous impulses,
noble aspirations and unselfish devo-
tion by her life of beautiful unselfish
ness toward others. But" she has gone
on before us and will be waiting to
greet us at the beautiful gate, for she ,
is not dead.
There is no death; What seems so is
transition,
This life is mortal breath,
Is but a suburb of the life elysian,
Whose portal we call death. ,
Let's go and open the gates of pearL .
Open them wide for this dear little
girl."
Said the children up in heaven. .
"For on the earth, do you hear them
weep?"
Said the children up in heaven.
"For the dear little girl has gone to
sleep,
The shadows fall and the night clouds
sweep
O'er the earth we used to live in;
But we wil go and open the gates of
pearls
O, why do they weep for the little
girl?"
Said the children up in heaven.
"God wanted her where His little ones
meet,"
Said the children up in heaven.
"She shall play with us in the golden.
She liad grown too fair, she had
grown too sweet;
For the earth we used to live in
She needed the sunshine, this dear lit
tle girl,
That gilds this side of the gates of
pearl."
Said the little children up in heaven.
"Fly with her quickly, O angels dear,"
Said the children up in heaven.
"See, she is coming; Look there, Look
there!
At the jasper lights in her sunny hair
Where the veiling clouds are risen,
O, hush, hush! The swift wings furl,
For the King himself at the gates of
pearl
Is taking her hand, dear sweet little
girl
And leading her into heaven.

She is not dead, the child of our affec
tion; But gone into that school
Where she no longer needs our poor ,
protection,
And Christ himself doth rule. 2
In that great cloister's stillness and j M
oonliicirm J
By guardian angels led
Safe from temptation, safe from
sin's pollution,
She lives whom we call dead.
Let us be patient; These severe afflic
tions, I
Not from the ground arise,
But oftimes celestial benedictions
Assume this dark disguise.
We see but dimly through the mists
and vapors,'
Amid these earthly lamps;
What seems to us but sad funeral
tapers.
May be heaven's distant lamps.
Her beautiful life is suggestive of
heaven, whither she has gone. She
is resting at peace with God and the I
richest heritage to her loved ones is
the Christian example she has left
them.
The following little poem was read i
at her burial by request; entitled,
"What Do They Say."
"O, what do you think the angels I
say"
Said the children up in Heaven.
"There's a little girl coming here to
day, She's almost ready to fly away v t
From the earth we used to live in; '
