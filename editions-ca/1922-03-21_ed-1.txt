SHEBE LOCAL CHAIBMANLEAD JEWISH CAMPAIGN . ."The Jewish, people of Kentuckyare conducting a campaign to raisemoney to help the starving and destitute Jewish people in Central andEastern Europe. Because of theunusual appeal and the belief thatpebple of all faiths will be glad togive to give toThis cause, contributions from non-Jews will be great-fully received and acknowledged.Kentucky's quota in "the campaignis set at $150,000. Of this amount$100,000 is to be raised in Louisvilleand $25,000 in the Bluegrass region.There is every indication that Kentucky, like every other State taking part in this nationwide campaign will- go over the top and farbeyond. An item was recently sentout under a New York date lineconveying the impression that thenational quota of $14,000,00 hadalready been" reached and passed.What was meantwas that when allState campaigns were completed,(this sum would probably be reached.Kentucky is one of a number ofStates in which the canjpaign is justbeing put on and the money is yet tobe raised.At a meeting held in Lexington,.Sunday afternoon, attended by repsentaive Jews from all the towns inthe Bluegrass section between 30and 35 per cent, of the ouota assigned was pledged in a short time.The meeting held in the MasonicTemple, was presided over by JonasWeil, District Chairman. Mr. Weilstated (hat several large subscriptions were included in the amount,and that during this week all thecommittees would be at work amongthe people of the Bluegrass, andthat the full quota would be raisedby Saturday. The-chief speakers atthe meeting were Rabbi Joseph-Bausch and Hon. Benj. Wash, bothof Louisville.Paris is reperesented on the Bluegrass committees by" William Shire,as local chairman. Isaac L. Price isa member of the State AdvisoryBoard. The work of soliciting fundswill be carried forward in the cityand county until the quota assignedhas been raised. Paris and thecounty will, or course, "go over thetop," as that is a kind of thing inwhich we have taken great pride.The funds are to be' used on Jewsand non-Jews alike, and, althoughthe Jews are directing the activecampaign and have undertaken theheavy responsibility of raising thefund "and distributing it among thestarving children of Europe, nonJews, as well as Jews, are asked tocontribute to the fund.HIGH SCHOOL LYCEUM COURSE.Saturday evening, March 18, thelargest audience that has been inthe City" School Auditorium in recent years, heard Mr. DeJen, the magician, give a splendid entertain-jmenu ana neard the announcement:of the coming of "The Sorority.Singers," Saturday night, March 25.j- It has been a. long time since thepeople of this community have hadpresented to them a more attractiveprogram that "The Sorority Singers"will bring.

The announcement beforethe French Association for the Advancement Qf Sciences that In the nearfuture airplanes would travel at aspeed of over 650 miles an hourstartled the conservative Frenchmenso much that they charged M. Breguet,famous French airplane" manufacturer, was more Imaginative thanJules Verne.Circle Earth In Twenty-Four Hours.In his speech Breguet said that whencertain improvements that he Is working on are brought to perfection airplanes will travel at a height of oversix miles, where air resistance isslight, make straight flights of thousands of miles without stopping, ,andfurnish voyagers more comforts thanany modern trans-Atlantic liner.Tills great speed, which, he claims,will even be tripled some day, wouldbe greater than the peripheric speedof the earth and would enable one tofly completely around the world in lessthan 24 hours. The improvementswhich will revolutionize flying in thismanner are in the weight of the motorin proportion to Its horsepower; theturbo-compressor, which he has justinvented with M. Bateau, to enablemotors to maintain their sea-levelhorsepower at great altitudes; perfections In construction metals, whichwill greatly reduce the weight of theplanes, and the fineness of the planes.During the war the fineness of thewings was nround 20 to 30 per cent;now it Is about 10 per cent, while theIdeal, that of the eagle, the hawk andother planing birds, is a trifle under 4per cent.Would Develop Speed.M. Breguet called upon airplanemanufacturers to devote themselves tothe development of planes which cantravel at least 2,000 miles withoutstopping, such as from Ireland toNewfoundland, or Bakar to Pernam-buco; a minimum speed of over 200miles an hour; every modern comfort,Including Pullman accommodations sothat passengers could sleep duringlong trips at night, and to have wireless installations to keep in constanttouch with the earth and be directedby radiogonometry.MAY USE RABBITS FOR HATSSenator Polndexter of WashingtonShows Way to Put "Jack" Peststo Good Use.Ephrata, Wash.

More schools, so thatthe"cherished hopes and ideals andhard work of the whole teachingforce from the superintendent to theassistant teacher may serve the na -tion as they so sincerely aspire toand plan for.'The quotationis from ..TheTeacher and the Taught," an articlein the March issue of Harper's Magazine, written by' Grace Irwin.Every friend of the Americanizationfeature of the work of the publicschool should read it; every legislator who raises a hand or a voteagainst liberal support to the publicschool should be tied to a stake andmade to listen to it. For it is notwnen even the Poorest kind of pooronly the child of foreign parents orf olks had much money.

Fortunately thereare not a great many of them butthey should be made to understandthat the association will not standfor any such monkey business asthat. The doors are now open to letin those growers who did not signduring the first drive, but who nowsee the benefit to be derived fromthe organization and are- anxious tocast their lot with their brotherfarmers and stand- together for aliving price for their crop. Theprobability is that when the crop of1922 is ready for market there willnot be over 5 per cent, not enoughto justify the opening of a loose leafhouse to sell it, hence- the- wisdom ofgetting on the boat while the gettingon is good.USERS OF ADDING MACHINESFor your convenience- we are nowcarrying a stock of the best addingmachine rolls and can supply youwith one or a dozen at a time.

The carry-over of corn andoats March 1, 1921, from the 1920crop was large, but these crops in-Kentucky in 1921 were much smallerthan the 1920 crops.The average amount oft corn on- Kentucky farms March 1, 1917 to1921 inclusive, has been about 40,647 bushels, and of oats about 2,001,000 bushels. Of last year'sKentucky corn crop 41 per cent (or33,682,000 bushels) still was heldfcy farmers March 1, 1922, comparedto 50 per cent of the 1920 crop (or50,844,000 bushels) on farms March1, 1921. About 12 per cent of Kentucky's 1921 wheat t;rop (or 761,.000 bushels) was held on farmsMarch 1, 1922, compared to 15 percent of the 1920 crop (or "900,000bushels) on farms March 1, 1921.Of the 1921 Kentucky oats cropfarmers held 26, per cent (or 1,447,'060 bushels) held on farms March1, 1921.

'Berlin. German soldiers who diedand were buried on Belgian andFrench battlefields probably will remain on foreign soil, on account ofthe cost entailed in bringing themhome. This is Indicated In statementsby the official bureau intrusted withthe work of helping relatives. to identify the dead and arrange for thetransportation of their bodies to Germany. Although negotiations with Franceand Belgium for the removal of thebodies were concluded weeks ago, notone German soldier has been exhumedfor the journey home, despite the factthat thousands of inquiries have beenmade by relatives.Told that they must bear the costof exhuming and transportation, whichfrom France amounts to 30,000 marks,they turn away, for thnt sum is now alarge fortune to the average German.Consequently, sentiment is growing toallow the German soldier dead to reston the field where they were buriedor in the French or Belgian cemeteriesto which they have been transferred.The information that the Frenchare carefully tendm'g tfiese burFalpluces and, where possible, markingthe Individual graves with crosses andnames, also has tended to allay the.feeling that these dead should not remain in a strange land.Under the stipulations agreed upon,none of the three governments assumes responsibility for mistakes, andthe relative must give a guarantee ofidentity before permission is grantedfor removal, which in the majority ofcases is very difficult.Even those relatives who can not ordo not desire to bring the dead soldierback to the Fatherland are seeking toestablish the Identity of the fallen, andthe bureaus opened In Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Wuerttemburg tohelp them, are swampedNvith inquiries.ONE-LEGGED DANCERVV N '"T.

For, after all,tne utilities are the mediumsthrough which people serve themselves with what have grown to beessentials of existence.More than a fifth of the population of a city or town wherein telephone, electric light, gas or tractioncompanies operate benefits throughth e-money they release for wages,taxes, purchase of supplies or otherrequisites of their business. Theircustomers, and the public generally,get back 90 per cent, of the revenueof public utility organizations. Yetbut 4 per cent, of the average family's income is paid out for utilityservice.People are beginning to realizethat they prosper in accordance withthe prosperity of their utilities.Hence the rapidly-growing spirit offairness and fco-operation.It is amazing how many "problems" are annihilated in the courseof good stiff commercial warfare.Let us make general conditions better by each" one of us fighting tomake his own business better.ADDING MACHINE BOLLS CHEAPWEITING HISTORY OF FLEMING-COUNTYMAY PROVE FATALWhen Will Paris People Learn theImportance of It?We have in stock for the convenience of users of adding machines, abig stock of paper roHs.

WILSON(New York -World)The bi-weekly yarns from Washington about Mr. Wilson's intervention in the treaty controversy readlike the inspired work of a Republican Senator. The Senatorial mindis much like the subconscious mindthat the psychoanalysts talk about.It reveals itself mainly in dreams,and Woodrow Wilson is the subjectof a great part of this Senatorialdreaming.Mr. Baruch emphatically deniesthe latest story, that he is a sort ofliaison officer between Mr. Wilsonand Senator Borah, and Mr. Baruch's statements coincide with TheWorld's information. According toMr. Wilson's closest friends, he hasnot even made up his mind aboutthe four-ppwer treaty, much less entered into a campaign against it.If Mr. Wilson wished to opposethe treaty it is certain that he wouldengagealwaysshown considerable talent in the expression of his own opinions, and ifthere were anything that he wantedto say about the four-power treatyhe would be quite likely to say it.The public, would not be undef thenecessity of obtaining his views sec-!ondhand through the Senate. jHowever, the Republican leadersof the Senate decided lemg ago that ;Mr. Wilson ought to lead the fight1against the treaties in order that 'they could insist that he was the realissue, and they will never be reconciled to his policy of systematicsilence Inever find it necessary tooutside service.
