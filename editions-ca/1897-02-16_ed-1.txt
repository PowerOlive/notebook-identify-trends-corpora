the Well Known San Francisco Physlclaa Says He is the Most Perfect Specimen of Physical Manhood inthe WorldSan Francisco Feb 15 After athorough examination of ChampionCorbett made by Dr A P Brian thewell known physician issued the certificate which followsFor several days past Fitzsimmonshas been insisting that Corbett shouldbe subjected to a thorough examination as to his physical condition Thisshould be a complete answerJames Corbett is the most perfectspecimen of physical manhood in myopinion in the world to day I sawhim in his fight with Sharkey andmust say that his condition is absolutely different at the present timefrom what it was on that occasionAfter a thorough examination Ihave failed to find a single flaw in hisanatomy The chest is expansive to aremarkable degree showing- the elasticity and firmness of the musclesThe capacity of the lungs indicatesgreat endurance and especially whenfortified by the fact that he has a perfect heart the sounds of which areheard clearly and distinctly overevery portion of the praecordeal regionSlljkv9smliilliiwI 11 ICHAMPION JAMES J CORBETTThe firmness and pliability of themuscles throughout his body give unmistakable evidence that James JCorbett has cared well for his physicalhealth and undoubtedly has recentlypassed through a hard and persistentcourse of trainingMy examinations of Mr Corbett weremade both before and after exerciseand I can say that he showed scarcelyany signs of fatigue afterhis violent practice His heartshowed no undue increasein action and he exhibited no signs ofdistress the respiratory movementsbeing slow regular and f ulL His longsinuous muscles are flexible and firmwithout undue development in any onegroup This is particularly characterized in the muscles of the chest armsshoulders and thighs as well as thelower region of the back all of whichgive evidence of strength and vitalityAnd the evidence to my mind whichsuggests a radical improvement inhis condition as compared to hislast visit to this coast is thehealthy appearance of the skin andmucuous membrane The latter particularly gives marked evidence of aperfectly normal and rich condition ofthe blood and good tone of the systemthroughout After the general examination I tested the various reflexeswith the object of determining thecondition of his nervous system Theresult was that I found the nervoussystem equally as good as the muscular system This is vitally importantas the general conditions of the bodydepend primarily on the healthy actionof the nervous centersPITTSBURGH POSTPlant

not be too large to be thoroughly comprehended while the groupingof the buildings and the general view ofthe grounds and buildings affords aThis being- the only national attraction of the year and

true of leaves istrue of seeds and indeed of every partof a tree It is also true of the behavior of trees during their life careerIn acorns especially one may note aremarkable difference in their behaior Some species of acorn will preserve their vital power without muchdifficulty for a couple of years whileothers can rarely be found with lifeafter a few months Some when putinto the earth will remain months before sprouting while others will sproutbefore they are fairly out of their cupson the trees The acorns of the liveoak of the south Quercus vivens oftensprout before the3r fall The processof germination is among the most remarkable of all American trees Theroot pushes out from the aeorn to adistance of many inches before it enters the ground the root then goe3into the earth while the bud or pulmuleascends to form the incipient treetrunk The young tree of the live oakTHE TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL CHILDRENS BUILDINGview of charming beauty It will besufficiently attractive to bring millionsof visitors and will provide a meansof advertising the business of exhibitors in a most effective mannerThe railroads have subscribed liberally towards the erection of the buildings and offer great inducements inthe way of transportation of exhibitsand for visitors There are 10000000people living within a nights ride ofNashville and the railroads will seethat a large percentage of that population is brought to Nashville besides themanv who will come from more remoteportions of the United States and fromioreign lands The officers will givecareful attention to the interests of theexhibitors Special provision is madefor showing inventions and improvements and for the benefit of smallerexhibitors who may be unable to attendin person the services of reliable menexperienced in their respective departments can be relied upon Althoughnot officially connected with the exposition they are indorsed by the authorities and will be under bond for thefaitliful discharge of their dutiesThese men will contract to receive in-a year stall care for and return exhibits andwjien requested will secure such attendants as may be required In thisway many valuable exhibits have already been entered and this arrangement will secure hundreds of other-that have not previously been seen inany expositionWhile space iu free if the exhibitshall be in place on opening day thedirector general reserves the right todecline exhibits of any class which majrbe already fully represented Otherthings being equal the first applicantswill be given the preference Thosewho are contemplating an exhibitshould apxfiy at once especially if alarge or prominent space is wantedThe governors of more than 30 statesand the mayors of nearly all the principal cities in the United States haveappointed commissioners and many ofthese have already arranged for publicand private exhibits and there is aspirit of rivalry in the greater cities ofthe west and south each city strivingto out do its business rivals of othercities The greatest enthusiasm has beeniroused in Cincinnati Chicago Louisrille and St Louis and these cities andtheir merchants will not only seek toidvertise their goods so that they maysecure the trade of the south buttheywill contribute in many ways to theJ luccess of the expositionswill frequently be a distance of sixinches from the acorn In this respect the behavior of this species ofoak corresponds nearly with what isalmost universal in monocotyledonousseeds Another early sprouter is thecommon white oak Quercus albaThese have not been known to sprouton the tree but they scarcely reachthe ground before the little radicle prezpares to enter the earth It does notwait to get to the surface of the earthbefore doing this On shelves or boxeswhere there is some number of themtogether the whole will be a mass ofrotts a few weeks after gathering Onthe other hand the nut of the burr oakQuercus macracarpa will remain along time before showing any disposition to sprout It is these varyingcharacteristics which make rules forthe transportation of seeds tdiffi culteach kind has to have a method of itsown So far as the two oaks are concerned it has been found better to

theplumes of this type the crane andheron orders are almost universallyscattered over the world and alike fromthe Brazils Venezuela Burma andSouth India from Florida and Southand West Africa from Turkey in Europe and southern Russia supplies aredrawn Here is a letter of a broker ofworld wide dealincs who says I havemade special inquiries of some oi ouragents and buyers some of whom havebeen actually in the West Indies andseen the birds and the conditions of acapture They all agree that the ideaof cruelty is a fallacy or at any ratea very exaggeration For instance in the case of osprey feathers wewould especially bring to your noticea point of which the opponents of theirwear make much capital and that is thekilling of the female bird on her nestCommon sense if nothing else shouldpoint out the stupidity of such a proaeeding as if such were the case thebird would have been pretty well exterminated by now The proof that itis not done is afforded by the increasingamount

and she has adopted them allGowns perfect in fit und rich in furhave been imported from Paris especially for her excursions on the iceHats wonderfully coquettish in effecthave been fashioned for no other purpose than to accompany these costumes And every week new fancies ingloves boots and muffs have been offered for the acceptance or disapprovalof the voting Woman who skatesIn spite of all these provisions for hercomfort however the skater has not always managed to keep herself out ofdanger and the aiewest invention designed for her is directed to remedjthis evil She has been provided witha pneumatic skatrng cajThe first inkling of this remarkablenew addition to the skaters toilettewas gained one evening recently at theSt Nicholas rink when a young womanin a beattiful skating costume of poppy-redbroadcloth and sable still further distinguished herself by wearing abrand new rubber capThe new cap which is very simplyconstructed should be inflated like abicycle tire The pumping in of airmakes the caj so sure a protector thatthe merest novice need feel no nervousness with one on her head She may beso unfortunate as to get a tumble sideways or backward but her head willnot get hurt whatever may happenXaturally the first problem confronting the skater who wishes to assureher own safety in thisfnovel manner isthat of making the pneumatic hat becoming A simple rubber cap is neithera lovely thing in itself nor becoming toits wearer But it is easily possible soto disguise it that iu shall not be recognizable The milliner to whom has beenintrusted the

individuality and the improvement of the race A strong healthy organization is the first essential to success intelligence beaut amiabilityand indeed there can be no conditionthat ill health will not undermineNeither wealth position honor noropportunity can compensate for thesence of a well balanced healthful condition of body and mind It is of thegreatest consequence that every personshould have some knowledge of thechemistry the anatomy and physiologyof his own organization Self-knowledgemust include the body as well asthe mindIn a body that is not well balancedthe mind soon becomes feeble and isoften lost In the organization of manthe mind depends as much upon thebody as the body upon the mindWith every thought emotion effort we expend a certain amount ofvital force consequently vyhile
