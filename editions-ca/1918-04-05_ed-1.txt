Their income is limited by ordinances whichfix the prices at which their productsare sold. Rapidly mounting costs ofoperation have brougtit,many of themuncomfortably near to bankruptcy.The officers of the. Governmentmentioned above have declared thegreat importance to the nation, ofthese public utility companies andurge State and local authorities asthe President expresses it, "to respond promptly to the necessities ofthe situation" which means toraise rates.Of course no such urging shouldhave been .necessary. The situationhas been well known for at least ayear, and has been growing worse.A good .many States and local authorities have met it; but a goodmany others have not. ,As with the railroads the wholecase of private versus governmentownership is involved. If the American experiment of private ownershipand public regulation fails becauseregulating bodies have not the courage to face criticism or because theyare animated by hostility to capital,the only alternative is governmentownership to the great "satisfactionof Tammany Hall and every like organization. The experiment will failunless, on the whole, regulatingbodies discover a more courageousand liberal temper.

Not only in past performances of the son of Broomstickand Christmas Star, but the trials asthey are being staged from time totime at Douglas Park, seem to justifythe high estimation in which he isheld by his staunch admirers.Escobia had a good many adherent::before his local preparation for therace was' commenced and the admirable manner in which he is trainingis bringing numerous new. friends tohis banner. He will continue 'to addto the list if his showing is of thequality and is as consistent as whathe has displayed recently.The many friends of Mr. KennethAlexander, owner of Ecsobia, inBourbon county, join the thousandsof Kentuckians in wishing him success with his sterling Derby colt, wholast year won five races, includingfour stakes, these being the Bashford Manor, Breeders' Futurity, Harold and Idle Hour, amounting towinnings' of $18,000.IF I WERE A FARMER.A-3,yyfw -jrvaS-SBtfa" -v yAt'jgrtrvBfggtffci.Jfc-'igigjajhC3?5;yLfc-r .vr-ii&9Kafess? szTW&rrSSSSSiSSSSaiSZIf I were a farmer I would keepat hand a few reliable medicines forminor ailments that are not so serious as to require th'e attention, of aphysician such as Chamberlain's Coiicand Diarrhoea Remedy for bowelcomplaints.Chamberlain's Cough Remedy forcoughs, colds and croups.Chamberlain's Liniment for sprains,bruises and rheumatic pains.Chamberlain's Tablets for stomach troubles, biliousness and constipation. ,This .would require an outlay ofonly $K10.
