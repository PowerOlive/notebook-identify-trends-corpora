-Her Faithful Friend
We welcome the accounts of women and urge e very
husband to start a bank account for his WIFE. Many a
man has been saved from financial disaster because his
economical wife had tucked away money and had it on
hand for a time of urgent need. And then every woman
should have a bank account and know how to handle
affairs, because there is one chance out of ctwo that she
must some day rely on herself.
We will welcome your account.
