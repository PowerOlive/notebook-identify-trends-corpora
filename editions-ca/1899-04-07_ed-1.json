IN RUSTIC WAYS
The blackbirds whistle all day long
A rhythmic gladness in their song
And night and morning down the Ian
Drifts by the cowbells rude refrain
The flicker dips on golden wings
And far across the meadow swings
The swallow skims in lines of grace
Like to the curves that painters trace
Above below and everywhere
A sense of living thrills the air
Springs message through the silent sent
With earth and wood and sky is blent
The hedgerow blossoms stain the sod
The south winds make the grasses nod
And woolly lambs in awkward play
Down the green hillside ambling stray
Along the blue horizon rim
The lights and shadows sink or swim
And penciled faintly on the skies
A ghostly half moons crescent lies
The blackbirds chant the whole day long
A rhythmic madness in their song
And dusk and dawn along the lane
Echoes the cowbells rude refrain

ONE GLASS OF WINE
A Belief That It Changed the History
of Thia Country
It is said that a single glass of wine
probably wrecked the Democratio party
in 1860 The story is worth telling
After the breaking up of the national
Democratio convention at Charleston
the party in Georgia held a state con
vention Great excitement prevailed
The leaders of the party could not
agree It was a critical period
The majority report indorsed the se
ceders or bolters at Charleston whe
the minority report opposed their
The leading champion of the n
was Herschel V Johnson and
his followers were confident that his
eloquence and logic would carry the
day
It is quite likely that such would
have been the case but for an unfortu
nate mishap Ex Governor Johnson be
gan his speech before the noon adjourn
ment on the second day and concluded
after dinner
Old men who remember that speech
say that it was a powerful argument
and the impression gained ground that
after the noon recess the speaker would
demolish his opponents with a few
eledge hammer blows
But the overooufident friends of the
minority report were doomed to disap
pointment Johnson felt the strain of
the morning session so much that he
was unable to eat anything and he took
a glass of wine upon an empty stomach
to strengthen himself This was a fatal
mistake That one glass of wine per
haps changed the destiny of the nation I
The great orator resumed his speech
but the wine bad nauseated him He
was hazy verbose and unintelligible at
times His style and argument lacked
vigor consistency and positiveness His
friends looked at one another in despair
The men on the other side were exult
ant It was evident that the speaker
bad damaged his own cause
Then Howell Cobb and Henry R
Jackson followed each other for the ma
jority report They spoke with an air
of expectant triumph and captured the
convention
The majority report was adopted It
is unnecessary to follow the history of
the next few weeks The national De
mocracy was completely disrupted and
put two tickets in the field Lincoln
was elected and the country was plung
ed into a civil war Had Johnson suc
ceeded in inducing the Georgia conven
tion to adopt his conservative ideas it
is safe to say that other southern states
would have fallen into line with our
commonwealth and the national Demo
cratio party would have remained

This fearful disease often first appears
as a mere scratch a pimple or lump in
the breast too small to attract any
notice until in many cases the deadly
disease is fully developed
Cancer can not be cured by a surgical
operation because the disease is a virulent
poison in the blood circulating throughout the system and although
the sore or ulcer known as the Cancer may be cut away the
poison remains in the blood and promptly breaks out afresh with
renewed violence
The wonderful success of S S S in curing obstinate deep seated
blood diseases which were considered incurable induced a lew de
spairing sufferers to try it for Cancer after exhausting the skill of
the physicians without a cure Much to their delight o S S proved
equal to the disease and promptly effected a cure The glaa news
spread rapidly and it was soon demonstrated
beyond doubt that a cure had at last been
found for deadly Cancer Evidence has accu
mulated which is incontrovertible of which
the following is a specimen
Cancer is hereditary in our family my father a
sister and an aunt having died from this dreadful
disease My feelings may be imagined when the hor
rible disease made its appearance on my side It was
a malignant Cancer eating inwardly in such a way as
to cause great alarm The disease seemed beyond the
skill of the doctors for their treatment did no good
whatever the Cancer growing worse all the while

first day forced out the poison I continued its use until I had taken eighteen
bottles when I was cured sound and well and have had no symptoms of the
dreadful affliction though many years have elapsed S S S is the ouJy cure
