GRAND LODGE OF ELKS.
What Was Done at a Business Ses
sion of the Convention Held
In Denver.
The Grand Lodge of the Benevolent
Protective Order of Elks in golden ju
bilee session at Denver, Colorado,
with the annual national reunion of
the order, decided to recognize the
State reuion of associations of Elks;
refused to provide, at present for the
publication of a national Elk' journal;
disapproved of a proposition to make
members who have served as secreta
ries of subordinate lodges for ten
consecutive years members of the
Grand Lodge; condemned the use of
the national anthem for advertising
purposes, and approved a resolution
extending fraternal good will to Con
federate and Union veterans of the
Civil war.
Southern delegates protested vigor
ously against being penalized for the
colored population of Southern cities.
The Grand Lodge rescinded its ac
tion of a year ago and reinstated 5,
000 population as a requisite for a
lodge dispensation, stipulating, how
ever, "five thousand white" popula
tion. The subject will come up again
on a motion to refer to a committee
for report.

ceive an advance of $2,834.50 more
than they received last year.
There' ari 5,696 children of school
age in 'Bourbon County. Of this
number 2(133 reside within the limits

Tn';LB13-Jl9r4 the Bourbon County
schools' outiside of Paris received a
total of $14,276.28, the number of
children in the county of school age
at that time being 3,530, and the per
capita being $4.05.
Besides the above amount, Bourbon
County schools, outside of Paris, re
ceived in 1913-1914 a total of $13,
457.92 form the county taxes, making
a total derived from all sourceS for

$4.50 for each pupil. The State fund,
can be used only for paying teachers'
salaries.
It used to take ten yards of goods
to make a skirt. Now it takes three.
But the three-yard skirt costs more
than the ten-yard skirt did.
TheJpne bride who sweeps up the
a church aisle in her finery this year
will be sweeping down the cellar steps
in a greasy kimono next year.
The smile on the face of the man
who teara up his tickets after the

After they agree to marry they
marry, and they never agree again.

CYCLONE AT HENDERSON.
Woman and Her Thirteen-Year-Oold
Nephew Crushed to Death
In Building.
Two persons were killed, several
others 'injured and scores of build
ings damaged in a cycolne which,
struck Henderson, late Friday. It is
estimated the damage will reach
$170,000. The municipal electric light
plant was partially destroyed and the
city is in darkness. Fires started in
two different sections after the tor
nado had passed, but were quickly
extinguished.
The dead are: Mrs. William Sew
ell and her thirteen-year-old nephew,
Bonnie Prior. Both were crushed to
death when a three-story brick build
ing was blown over on their home.
The cyclone started at the south
edge of the city and swept a path
four blocks wide and twelve blocks
long through the main business and
residential section.
GATUN LAKE STANDS TEST.
Resources of Gatun Lake, the won
dreful artificial reservoir which is the
main dependence of the Panama Canal
for its water supply, have proven am
ple to meet all possible demands, af
ter the most severe practical tests.
Although the amount of water which
ran into the lake during the last dry
season January to April, inclusive
was less than in any similar period
for the last 22 years, being only 61
per cent, of the normal collection, the
lake. was maintained at its proper ele
vation throughout that period.
GIVES GROUNDHOG DINNER
Farmers near Hagerstown, Ind.,
have found a new way to reduce the
cost 6 living and to benefit their
farms at the same time. J. C. Kilk
inscon recently showed them how. He
invited a number of friends to dinner
and a delectable meat, supposed by
most of the guests to be squirrel, was
served. After the cigars had been
passed, Mr. Wilkinson told them that
it was ground hog. These make good
food and their killing off is a boon to
the farmer, for in their search for
food the animals .have devastated clo
ver fields, gardens and truck patches,
and in many instances haye made
raids on poultry yards.
