X CREEL OPERATION
THE
PROCESS BY WHICH TORTOISE
SHELL IS PRCCURED
iHres Set on the Living Turtle to Sepa
rate the Bony Layers of the House In
Which He Lives A Business That
Struck an Observer as Heartless
There are many articles of daily and
liourly use constantly passing before
our eyes and through our hands about
the production of which we know com
paratively little or nothing An inter
esting example of this is tortoise shell
from which combs and hairpins are
made besides a multitude of trinkets
for the dressing table the desk and
the pocket Fierce crusades have been
instituted in recent years against the
slaughter of birds for the procurement
of their plumage for hat trimmings
and yet I venture to say that the proc
ess of procuring tortoise shell is a cru
elty to animal life which far exceeds
that to which birds are subjected
In the eighties I happened to be down
in Bluefields on that awful Mosquito
coast and at tht invitation of ono
Manuel Latona who was the owner and tj gue8t
Miller f
captain of a small schooner went with
him to the cay El Roncador for tortoise
shell This cay gets its name which in
English would be the Snorer from the
exceedingly angry surf which can be
Iheard for a long distance breaking over
iha reefs This is the cay on which a
couple of years back the historic old
ship Kearsarge was wrecked and bat
tered to pieces El Eoncador is nothing

time grow a new covering just as
man will grow a new finger Luil in
aco of one he might lose The
rity of the second growth of shell
ongh is that instead of reproducing
ie original number of 13 segments it is
stored in one solid piece
To see the operation of taking the
trll from the living turtle onca is
out all a man of northern breeding
ants of it and if the helpless - rtiles
ad the power of voicing their
gs under it their cries woulu 1 of

land such as is found throughout the TlH1
from Saturday until Monday
southern seas three quarters of a mile
long perhaps and not more than a
quarter of a mile across its widest part
Surrounding the island is a reef inside
t which the water is smooth and rath
er shallow and at the bottom of this
shallow water there grows a peculiar
kind of sea grass which is a dainty
food for the turtle tribes There is also
found on the top of the water inside the
xeef a sort of small blubber fish called
in Spanish dedalcs or thimble fish
which is perhaps the greatest delicacy
of- the entire turtle menu
The turtle whose shell is valued in
-commerce is a small species known as
thj hawk bill There are other varie
ties which come to El Eoncador to
gpawn but they are not molested Dur
ing the night the turtles crawl up on
the shore to lay their eggs each female
-depositing on an average about 70 To
do this they dig holes in the sand about
two feet deep and after laying the eggs
cover them over so deftly that it is al
most impossible for a novice to find
them These eggs are really delicious
when roasted but the turtle fishers are
-careful not to destroy those they do not
take for food so as to promote as much
raa possible the increase of this valuable
sea reptile At night the fishers conceal

Mr A H Crausby of 158 Kerr St

paid no attention to a small lump which
appeared in her breast but it soon de

the best physicians it continued to
spread and grow rapidly eatingfcwo

soon pronounced
her incurable A
celebrated New York

tinued to grow worse
and when informed
that both her aunt
and grandmother had
died from cancer he
gave the case up as
hopeless
Someone then re
commended SSJ3
and though little hope remained she
begun it and an improvement was no

when she had taken several bottles it
disappeared entirely and although sev

The old time plantation songs of the
slavery days have about passed away
and the negroes now cut the original
melodies into scrappy discords and mi
nor notes A negro had rather strike a
minor note than to rub the waistband
of his pants against a well filled table
and eat It seems that the peculiar tone
holds a fascination for him which can
not be overcome There is always some
thing to interest you when you can hear
a genuine old time plantation song as
sung by the aged slave negroes when
heart and soul are united in the song
I have spent many a pleasant hour
listening to the quaint songs of an old
gray headed negro on my grandfathers
farm as he would rasp the screeching
chords in accompaniment on his banjo
When he would sing he would get a

Messrs Chas Martin and Letton
Vimont have returned from a fox hunt
in Mason They report plenty of foxes
themselves along the shore as well as and fine sport They were guests of Mr
possible and when the turtles come up
out of the water oh the beach they rush
forth and turn them over on their backs
with iron hooks leaving them secure in
this position until morning
The tortoise shell of commerce is not
vlb is generally believed the horny cover
ing or shell proper of the turtle it is
-the scales which cover the shield These
-scales are 13 in number 8 of them be
ing flat and the other 5 somewhat curved
Pour of those that are flat are quite
large sometimes being as much as 12
inches long and 7 inches broad nearly
-transparent and beautifully variegated
in color with red yellow white and
-dark brown clouds which give the ef
fects so fully brought out when the shell
is properly polished A turtle of aver
ago size will furnish aboui eigJ pounds
of tucse laminae or scales Qiur piGGe
dng from an eighth to a quarter of an
inch iu thickness
It is the method by which these scales
sire loosened which is the repulsive part
of the business The turtles are not
killed as that would lead- to their ex
termination in a very few years After
capturing them the fishers wait for
to complete the work The turtles
e vumed over again in their natural
-it ion and fastened firmly to the
imd by means of pegs Then a bunch
dried leaves or sea grass is spread
puly over the back of the turtle and
c kfire The heat is not great enough
injure the shell merely causing it to
paiate the joints A large blade very
iii Jar in shape to a chemists spatula
then inserted horizontally between
e laminae which are gentlj pried
om the back Great care must be tak
i not to injure the shell by too much
at and yet it is not forced off until it
fully prepared for separation by a
iffioieut amount of warmth v
The operation as one may readily
lagine is the extreme of cruelty and
any turtles do not survive it Most of
em do live however and thrive and

I would take him
little pieces of colored paper and all the
colored glass I could find to get him to
sing for me and to repeat the farfamed
verse of alliteration Did you ever see
a possum in a papaw patch a pickin
up papaws and a puttin em in his
pocket to make a papaw pie for his
papa This is the joy of his life and
it never grew old or tiresome to him to
repeat it
Mose was his name and not long
since I concluded to pay him a visit and
to hear again the songs I had so enjoyed
when a child I found his cabin and he
was at heme being unable to get about
much I shook hands with the honest
old negro and sat down The light
which came into his face showed how
welcome I was and we had a long talk
Finally I asked him to take the dusty
banjo from the wall and give me a few
strains of Nigger Foot In Ashes at a
lively clip He did as I asked and the
old time vigor came upon him again
After playing awhile I asked him to
sing me the corn shucking song the
niggers used to sing while they
danced the rabbit dance after the
corn was all husked and the white folks
had gone to bed He was in fine spirits
and with his head way back on his chair
and his feet extended to keep time with
the banjo he sang
Early one mornin on my massasr farm

After Moso finished singing thi song
an eight inch griiLplayed across his face
from ear to ear his eyes sparkled and
the old negro washappy again as if the
young folks had gone through their
dancing while he sang He said Mas
sa Will de beat days ob de old niggers
life am done gone but when I think obi
de good old times we had befo de wah
deso bones ob mine gits young and1
want to git right up and hit de jig step

I told him L was something of a
dancer myself and that if he would
out down lively on the eld barnyard
euokle I wold show him a few steps

in earnest

I stopped him because I was out of
breath and ha laid back in his ohair
and laughed till his sides were aching
I pulled out a rabbits foot and tossed
it to him and the effect was magical
He jumped three feet on a rise and six
feet on the stretch and gave a whcoD
which was equaL to a Comanche chiefs
After his fright was over he told me
whatever I did not to put any more of
those hoodoos on him I did not intend
to frighten him but wished to see if
the superstition he had possessed in
his young days had departed from him
I gave him a shining dollar for scaring
him so and he was himself again Wa
had had a fine time in thet few hours X
had staid with him and I asked him
to pick up his banjo again and play and
sing the tune he used to call Mr Kim
ble His bony fingers raked across the
strings again and he sang the quaint
Budg I had enjoyed often when a child
You cant guess -what -we had fo supper
