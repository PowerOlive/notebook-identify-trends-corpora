UNLOADING COAL
Ways of Discharging Coal From Ca-
nalboats Into Carts
Scoops like those that are used in
taking up mud from under water in
deepening slips that shut together in
- the mud biting out a great mouthful of
it to be lifted up and dropped into a
scow are also used in unloading coal
in taking coal out of boats The ordinary
way of unloading coal from boats into
hearts on the wharf alongside is with
ibig Bcoops holding a quarter of a ton
ieach which are hung on pivots so that
when they are cast loose they can easily
jbe npset and emptied These scoops are
Jilled in the boat by men who tip the
ficoop on its side toward the coal and
ssorape the coal down into it until it is
almost full and then right it up and
finish filling it with shovels The scoop
is hooked on to a rope and hoisted up
by horse or steam power to the driver
waiting with his cart on the wharf

These seemed impregnable for where
the slopes of the cliff were not inaccessi
ble the defenders had turned the water
course on the elge of them so that they
were quickly coated with ice
In front of these strongholds the offi
cers and Gurkhas played football every
afternoon the latter who were very
keen kicking the ball without bending
the knee The Hunzas however object
ed to the game and as soon as one com
jmenced would open fire which the
players regarded not So the Kanjutis
started a game of polo on the maiden
outside Thol but the British fire was
more effective for the Gurkhas are
capital marksmen and the game was
soon dropped Finally a Dogra sepoy
named Nagdu discovered a gully which
seemed possible and ascended this alone
The following night 50 Gurkhas
and 50 Dogras of the imperial service
-troops under Lieutenant Manners
Smith an expert cragsman hid at the
foot of the gully and remained shivering
there for hours until at early dawn
the remainder of the forco diverted the
enemys attention by a continuous fire
Followed by his 50 Gurkhas Manners-Smith
commenced the perilous as
cent and behind them came Taylor and
his Dogras with the mortifying result
that after two hours climbing the gully
was found to be blocked Steps were
retraced to where the gully forked and
there he again led upward in such
manner that had one of the leaders
missed his hold most of the party
might have been swept away
This time they were right and the
-leaders were within 60 yards of the first
- sangar before being perceived The
xalarm being given the interchange of
shots at once ceased and all attention
was directed to the daring climbers
Rocks and showers of stones were pour
ed down but the little band had passed
the most exposed points and only a
few were destroyed Calmly they swung
themselves up from rock to rook until
at length the pluokly subaltern and a
few of his men were seen to storm the
first sangar the defendants scattering
after a short resistance Pall Mall

Idealism and Realism
What do you think my dear ex
claimed Mr Brownjones in tones of joy
ful excitement You know the Feder
ation of Authors is meeting in our city
Well we are to have the honor of en
tertaining the celebrated novelist Go
dolphin Whatnot as our guest
Um responded Mrs Brownjones
enigmatically Is Mr Whatnot a real
ist or an idealist
Why do you want to know asked
Brownjones surprised
Well if he is an idealist I can just
leave things as they are but if he is a
realist I must give the house a thorough
cleaning from top to bottom I may not
be literary but Ive dipped into real
istic novels and I know their style
The right hand curtain hung slightly
askew suggesting that one of the dra
pery pins had lost its grip A pendulous
cobweb waved mournfully from the
cornice just above the door leading into
the hall and there was a fine bloom of
dust like that of the purple grape on
the piano lid In the left hand corner of
the room almost buried in the pile of
somewhat faded carpet was an invisi
ble hairpin clearly indicating the re
cent presence of a woman in the apart
ment Find out right away Barring
ton what Mr Whatnot is and then I
shall know how to proceed I have no
desire to let my house afford material

Tears For Revenue Only
I A heterogeneous collection of loafers
sat in the village public house alter-
nately wiping their eyes and sighing
heavily The landlords son had been
buried that day and a fitting air of
gloom pervaded the place
I What a lot of fuss you make about
it cried a smart young bravo who had
been surveying the company with ill
concealed disgust Why should we
bother ourselves about a corpse
The others stared at him aghast but
before they could reply the landlord
himself came in and proceeded to serve
out quarts of ale in dignified fashion
I He went round the room systematically
until he came to the smart young man
who held out his baud for the pitcher
Nay lad thall get no ale from
me said the landlord
Why not was the aggrieved ques
tion
Cos tha hesut earnt it like trest
Theyve been blubbing for two hours
an tha hesnt as much as taen thy
handkerchief art o thy pocket My
motto today is No blub no ale so

The steam scoop is used in only the
- -smaller sizes of coal but the work that
-it does is done much cheaper than it
xQuld be done by hand shoveling The
scoop is dropped open upon the coal in
thd hold of a canalboat and then closed
by power operated by the engineer who
runs it The separated lower edges of
the twaparts of the scoop are drawn to
gether down through the coal until they
- meet thus holding the coal inclosed
The scoop is then hoisted tip and
swung in by power not over the cart
but over an elevated pocket or bin
which has a spout on each side so that
rtwo carts can load at once When it
iiias been swung in the scoop is opened
to discharge its contents into the pocket
and then it is swung out again and once

HOW TO FIND OUT
Fill a bottle or common glass with urine
and let it stand twenty four hours a sedi
ment or settling Indicates an unhealthy con
dition of the Kidneys When urine stains
linen it is evidence of kidney trouble Too
frequent desire to urinate or pain in the
back is also convincing proof 1 hat the kid
neys and bladder are out of order
WHAT TO DO
There is comfort in the knowledge so often
expressed that Dr Kilmers Swamp Root
the great kid ey remedy fulfills every wish
in relieving pain in the back kidneys liver
bladder and every part of the urinary pas
sages it corrects inability to hold urine and
scalding pain in pnssing i or bad effects fol
lowing use of liquor wine or beer and over
comes that unpleasant necessity of being
compelled to get up many times during the
night to urinate The mild and the extraor
dinary effect of is soou realized
It stands the highest for its wonderful cures
