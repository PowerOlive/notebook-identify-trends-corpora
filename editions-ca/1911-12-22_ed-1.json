Mckernan Signs With Battle
Creek.
A press dispatch from Battle Creek,
Mich., published in the daily papers of
Tuesday was as follows:
"Edward McKernan, of Cincinnati,
has signed a contract to manage the
local Southern Michigan League team
next season at the highest salary paid
in the league. McKernan has piloted
the Paris, Ky., team to two successive
pennants in the Blue Grass League.
He will play second base here."
About a week ago the News publish
ed an item to the effect that McKer
nan would probably manage the Parit
team the coming season and at the
time it wa3 evident the deal with the
Battle Creek Club had fallen through.
However, it later developed that Mc
Kernan signed at the largest salary
ever paid a player id tnat company.
According to the statement of Presi
dent Bacon, McKernan remains the
property of the Paris club, but the
local club stands ready to grant his
release for the purchase price, which is
more than likely the Battle Creek club
Till put up. Upon receipt of the news
that McKfernsn had signed with the
Southern Michigan League club Presi
dent Bacon left this city on a scouting
tour and will probably visit several
cities in quest of a man to manage the
team next year, and at the same time
will be on the lookout for several players.

CRYSTAL ICE CREAM PARLOR.
Sees Great Work of Her Precep
tor. The Lexington Leader of Wednesday
contained the following: "At the L.
L. Roberts Furniture Company's store
the shoppers this Christmas have the
opportunity of seeing an oil painting
by the celebrated French artist,
Benjanina Contsanr. It is his ideal of
'The Holy Family' and a superlative
work of art which the farm secured to
exhibit to their patrons during the
Christmas season.
"This thought is an admirable one
and all who hava seen the picture feel
it indeed a special privilege. The
painting is eight by eleven teet and is
well hung in the carpet department
upstairs of the L. L. Roberts Co.
"Mrs. Hattie Hutchcraft Hill, of
Paris, who is herself an artist of envi
able reputation in portrait and land-st-ape
painting, happened to visit ithe
store and see the picture and it brought
forth many expressions of delight as
the great painter Constant was her
teacher for seven years of her study in
Paris, France. Mrs. Hill lent the firm
a photograph of the artist which is
signed by himself and it is shown with
the picture.
"Few Kentucky artists have had
more gratifying success , than this
pupil of Constant, Mrs. Hill. Har
painting, 'Sunrise on the Sea,' was ad
mitted to the Paris Salon and was with
that world famous collection arranged
for the Czar of Russia to see when he
visited the Paris Exposition a number
of years ago.
"An order was given Mrs. Hill from
the Bourbon County Fiscal Court to
paint several portraits of Bourbon
county jurists, among them Judge
Richard Samuels, Richard Hawes,
Matt Turney, Russell Mann, H. C.
Howard, William Purnell.H. C. Smith.
She was also engaged to retouch all
the damaged portraits rescued from
the old court house of Paris when it
was destroyed by fire, "
