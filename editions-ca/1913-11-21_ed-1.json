For great efforts are being made in
this vicinity to sell baking powders of
inferior class, made from alum acids
and lime phosphates, both undesir
able to those who require high-grade
cream of tartar baking powder to
make clean and healthful food.
The, official Government
tests have shown Royal
Baking Powder to be a
pure, healthful, grape
cream of tartar baking
powder, of highest
strength, and care should
be taken to prevent the
substitution of any
other brand in its place.
Royal Baking Powder costs only a
fair price per pound, and is cheaper
and better at its price than any
other baking powder in the world.
