M. Wheeler Furniture Co.THE NEWS recently received thefollowing lettert from a Paris woman,who somewhat humorously refers tothe "activities of the Paris Commercial Club," and some smooth-tonguedreal estate man she encountered,who had ready, explanations forevery objection offered to residencesin certain localities. The letter follows: Paris, Ky., December 10, 1921."Editor THE NEWS:"Something more that a year agoI came- through Paris with- mydaughter and her husband, lookingfor a house to buy. I wanted to" goon to Lexington, but my son-in-lawgot to talking to some real estateagents here; and we . started overParis to look at some houses theyhad for sale. .We went" down Mainstreet to Second, and over- to whatthey called Mt. Airy avenue. Allthe way over the two agents entertained us with the 'activities of theParis Commercial Club They toldus that in a few yearatiie Commercial Club would so improve Paristhat she would make Lexington looklike Ruddles Mills by comparison."We got over to Mt. Airy avenue,and they were showing us a house,and while we were looking throughthe home a long train passed overthe Louisville & Nashville, and itjust seemed like the train was rushins: through the house. I said toAmanda (that's my daughter) 'Wedon't want to live here so close tothe railroad,' whereupon" one of thereal estate men spoke up and said:'That noise by the trains won't be anuisance here because Ed. Gorey,who pretty much druns the L. & N. ispresident of the Commercial Club,and to keep the noise of the trainsfrom bothering these folks along"this street he is going to have the L.and N. put up a high fence with up-to-datesounding boards, and youwon't even hear the noisiest freightwhile passing here.'"We went from there out Mainand were looking at a piece of property near a church and we ratherliked it, but then a large bell beganto ring, and I added: 'Mandy, Icouldn't live here, listening to thatbell, it makes me nervous.' Theagent, in a twinkling, said: "Oh,don't be uneasy abaut that bell. TheCommercial Club has appointed acommittee to have all the churchbells quit ringing, The fact is, people flock to the churches when thebells ring and crowd in so, thechurch people will be glad to stonthe bells, for that would be cheaperthan to build additions to thechurches.' x"Our objections to a house on EastMain street was met by the agentstelling us that the Commercial Clubhad a committee appointed to doaway with the county rock quarry,to have the street railway extendedto the North Middletown turnpike,and to build a fine new steel bridgein the place of that evil-smelling oldwooden structure across StonerCreek. Goingr to South Paris our objection to being so far away from"the City School was answered by thereal estate men informing us thatthe Commercial Club had an optionon a lot at the corner of Main andNineteenth streets, and that theywere going to have a fine new CitySchool building erected thereon."At the end of Pleasant street wewere shown a nice house, but thetrains coming and going made somuch f ubb and noise we could hardlylook at the house and much less seeIt, for the smoke, and the noise.'Oh, that is nothing,' said the realeBtate man. 'Ed Gorey is going tohave a soft pedal put on the yard engine, and Ed. is going to have all thetracks laid with rubber, and smokeconsumers put on every engine. TheCommercial Club has nut Rri nn tnit ""We finally bought a hnnae hf n(-price we could not sell for one-halfwe gave for it, believing and relyingon what those real estate men toldus. Please ell us if and when is theCommercial Club going to do any orall of those things. I was talking toone of my neighbors who Is well-to-do,being the 17th Vice-Regentx ofthe Dears, and she said: 'The Commercial Club activities died a-born-in'.'My son-in-law called to me andsaid: 'Tell Swift to prod the Commercial Club up,' and then hollered:'Tell Billy Hill to give them Hill, orBilly Hill to give them .'

The tobacco inthis county is reported as being inexcellent condition.The Christmas turkey market isgetting into its stride, and a largenumber of the birds have beenslaughtered for the local and Eastern markets. Prices are possibly alittle higher than on the Thanksgiving market, and many housewivesare planning to substitute thegoose for the customary bird on theChristmas table.Small grain is reported as beingin better condition than it has beenat this time of the year for severalyears. Hay, loose and baled, appears to.be plentiful. Corn continuesto sell at good prices. Trading hasbeen very dull, a few cattle changing hands.

Don't"bother about thefrills. Our ordinary Sunday dinger will do beautifully. Anyonewho gets ourusual Sunday dinner is getting afine meal.""Well, I "guessthat is about all'I can do and for' e many, too,"Marian said."You're a wonder to attemptlt." Bert said admiringly. "Butdon't think youbare to overdoFor 'days anddays Marian planned her ChristmasJEner. She salted nuts, she madecranberry sauce. She ordered a fineyoung turkey. She wasn't nervousafcout the turkey that was Just aboutas easy as chicken." Yea, she was planning to have the14-time Christmas dinner. Shewouldn't tell Bert She would surprise him. And then, if she did tellaim, she might be more -nervous aboutith things she had planned to do, feelflag that he was going to be so proudf her that she couldn't fulfill his exfectations of her success.'- So she worked and planned anddiemed.And that Christmas eve when Bartttaaed her good-night' she smiled toerself as she heard him say:"Well, it's Quite true. People havealways eaten too much at ChristmasHue in past years."Bart's family all arrived in due seafwn .for Christmas dinner."Well were you nervous over yourAnt turkey?"- asked Aunt Emlllna.And how happy Tarian was that shecould say that she hadn't been nervous and that it was going to come outall right, she thought"I'bet it was a Job making yourfirst plum pudding," said UncleCteorge, and Bert looked angry andgrieved- He didn't want anyone toaake his Marian feel uncomfortable.And how his own family were doing it."Uncle George," Bert said, "weaaeant to tell you. We're not goingtm have one of those old-time din-aers. We think that people have nl- !ways felt wretchedly at Christmas, andafter Christmas indigestion and all.So we're just going to have a nicesimple dinner,"Marian had left the room now.- Butafce could hear the defending note inBert's voice, and at the same time aBote of sadness that their dinner wasgoing to be so simple.She wanted to rush in now and telltaem all that it wouldn't be so simple,end to put her arms around Bert'ssack and kiss him. He was standingp for hen- And they were all trylag to be critical. And she bad incited them all to her house. Thisma the way they were accepting herBMpltality !Wut, following a number more sini-remarks on how did she get along-with her mincepie, and did sheburn herself salting the nuts, sheat last announcedthat dinner wasquite ready.Admiringly, increasingly admiringly, the guestsate and ate andate. There wasnothing that hadever been a partof a Christmasdinner that Marxian did not have.And Bert grewprouder and moreboastful of herby the moment 1How Bert lovedto boast of what she could do!Af last came the dessert mince pieaad apple pie and plum pudding, too.How Bert's eyes opened wide withsurprise when he saw the pudding."What did you mean when you saidyott were going to have a new, kindbt a dinner without any of the Caristbws trimmings?" asked Une&Q&rge.'"My wifa likes surprises Bertbeamed. And after they had algone,Bert said:""They behaved atrociously, but oh!JHow proud I was of you. Aad Majitin darling"Taa, dear?

ASketch Illustrates New Features ofFire Resistive Construction.DANGER from fire in frame houMahas been reduced fifty per centthrough improvements in construction worked out by the most competent engineers in the lumber industry. This announcement has just beenmade after these engineers have beenworking upon improved designs inframe construction during the pastyear with a view to reducing: the firehazard for wood houses to a minimum.Practically no change in appearanceIn houses constructed by the improvedmethods and very little, If any, additional cost is involved, but the methods recommended by the engineers giveprotective features making the framehouse essentially resistive to fire.Interposing of panels and shortpieces within spaces that ordinarilyserve as flues for rapid spread of fire,for instance, reduces danger from thiscause. Other protective improvementprevent wooden parts catching firefrom chimneys, fireplaces, heatingplants and steam and hot water pipes.While wood will burn and there isno such thing as a "fireproof housewithin the reach f the ordinarypoclcetbook, the new protective measures devised by the lumber engineersoffer an economical type of construction that is fire resistive and as nearlyfireproof as frame construction as nowdeveloped can be made, according totheir conclusions. The methods conform strieUy to the scientific codes ofthe most ,progreaiva-itte and" carrya minimum of fire risk because of thenecessarily alow spread of combustionn houses following the new type ofmstructioa.GAME SHOWS BIG INCREASEMigratory Bird Law Works Wondersfor Dataware Sportsman, Accordl Ina ttffWporU.-Wilmlngtou, Del.

It seems established, 1in the opinion of most competent observers, that as matters stand todayan airplane can sink or disable anywarship, no matter how it is armored or otherwise protected. It ismerely a, question of using enoughbombs and a large enough fleet of' planes.It is to be remembered,, too, thatthe battleship is the outcome of avery long period of development andIs probably near its limit of perfection, while airplane -warfare is stillin its infancy. Planes are gettingbigger and more powerful rightalong, able to fly more swiftly and to! carry heavier loads. Soon, too, theyjwill be using effectively poison gas,liquid fire and other weapons In addition to bombs.To a layman, at least, the thinglooks to be very simple. Thousandsof new planes can be built for theprice of one battleship, and one or aI few planes may destroy the battle1 ship. Sea armament has become burdensome in cost, and has become ofdoubtful value to say the least. Airplanes are cheap, and of proven effectiveness, and the plain tendencyof war is to take to the air.-O-'""A BOYAL WEDDINGAn American citizen, William P.Leeds, made a fortune in the manufacture of tin plate. He died someye'ars ago and his widow has sincemarried a member of the Greek royalfamily.Now her son, young William H.Leeds, has just married a Russianprincess, the daughter of a grandduchess. The marriage has createdquite a stir, in this country andabroad.It takes a lot of money to enablean American to marry into a royalj family. It is rumored that theI Leeds fortune financed the return ofKing Constantne to the Greekthrone after he had been exiled because of his stand on the side ofGermany during the world war.I All this money was made in America, and naturally an Americanhates to think of it being squanderedin European politics and upon Eu. ropean royal families.But what can you do about it?Perhaps the only thing that can'vbe done about it is to hope that thefederal income tax collectors willkeep a close watch on the incomesof these royal and near-royal personages from their American investments. oitrsasaAiring Rooms.To give a room which has long beenclosed a pleasant odor, while airing it"put some ground- coffee in a saucert ! with 'a small piece of camphor gum int the center.

"We all know you havethe opportunity to do so every timebe goes to see you. We would wagerhe'd proposed any number of times.""I don't know about that," Elizabeth would laugh. They could getnothing out of her.Once some of them spoke to Howard. "We wish you two would get married. We're tired of seeing you courting all the time."Howard smiled."It's up to Elizabeth," he said.One woman spoke to Elizabeth oneday In a very serious fashion."The trouble with you," the womansgld, "is that you've always had somuch attention. Not only Howard,but everyone has been charmed byyu, and you think that will go on tothe end of time. You'll find it won'tThey'll stop, and then, where willya be?""I don't want to be married so asto escape being xan old maid," Elizabeth laughed. "I've seen too manykappy ones to be afraid. What'saiore I think a lot more of a person,who Is faithful to someone they'velored than to marry for the sake offlurrying. Lots of the "old maids"&re that. Some of the married oneshave been so afraid they'd be thoughtunpopular and unwanted that they'vetoerried out of sheer cowardice.". This was very puzzling. Had Elizabeth loved someone in her earlierdays perhaps when she - had goneaway on a visit? No one knew. Butereryone was puzzled. So much puzJrted that they asked no more questions. They stopped telling her sheshould marry Howard. They stoppedfiling her what a wonderful husbandh would make, and how much heloved, her.They were speculating on which visit It could have been when the tragedy occurred. And had the mysterious man married or had he been already married and so Elizabeth, asa nice, quiet girl had quickly takenherself home and out of the way?- It was snowing hard. Elizabethwas getting together her Christmaspresents when the door bell rang.Outside stood Howard."I thought perhaps you'd not mindif I went with you when you tookaround the presents," he said. "Iknew it was just about your time."How lovely it was outside.

In"addition, the reportsof relief workers . "..who have been longon the field and ofgovernment officialscarefully examined."In those fewdistricts where theArmenian has beenable to live in peacehe has thoroughlydemonstrated hisability to care forhimself and hisown," declares Chas.V. Vickrey, generalsecretary of the relief organization,who headed theCommission."Naturally industrious, with an inherent distaste foraccepting charity, ithas been the wholesale disorders of thepast year that haveprevented the peoplefrom realizing theircherished dream ofa stable, independentgovernment."Even in the present crisis, with starvation and choleramaking such rapidinroads into the population that it seemsimpossible for anyto survive, the people are strugglingiBHBMBjaMBBSJBJBflBaaaBJMMBJBBJBBJHHtaB H1HssiBBBBBM:WB9milBBBK "? pm;!??P'1 f ' ,'MKSst aA Victim ofScabies,Nearly atPrevalentas Starvation.bravely against overpowering circumstances.

Waifs at Erhran Railroad Station."Time after time since the outbreakof the world war, the Armenians havemade a brave attempt to cultivate theirland. And time after time some newdisorder has prevented them from gathering their crops or laid waste their fieldsbefore the grain has ripened and beengathered in."After two years of American reliefactivity it seemed last fall as if we wouldbe able to reduce our program in RussianArmenia to the care of the children wehad gathered into our orphanages. Butthen came the y. new invasion, crops weretrampled downNn the fields, live stockwas carried off, and the peasant populationWere driven from their homes.We may not be able to save all of thehelpless refugees who are now crowdedin this territory, but we certainly cannotdesert the hundred thousand orphanchildren who are now Jn our orphanagesor under our protection in the Caucasas,Anatolia, CiKcia and other devastatedareas of the Near East. Last spring,when our supplies ran low, 3,000 of thesechildren died out of a total of 20,000 inone of our orphanages. These childrenare absolutely dependent upon aid fromAmerica and will perish if our aid iswith-held. .Next year. If further chaos can beavoided, possibly we will be able toreduce our program, but prompt actionis necessary now or forv thousands therewill be no next year."AN APPEAL FOE AID TO CHUDBEN'S HOMEstraight and tall, his face glowingth health, his eyes so clear, so keeniUl bo devoted.

Weldon, to help theKentucky Children's Homfe Societyin its effort to build a cottage village at London, Ky., for the care ofhomeless children of Kentucky.Mrs. Weldon in her letter pointsout that the purposes of the two organizations are so parallel that eventhe names should be synonymous.The Kentucky Children's Home Society, at present, is caring for morethan 150 children in buildings onBaxter avenue destined to shelteronly 150 children, and yet throughout the State there are thousands oflittle ones homeless, friendless andknocking at the door of the institution for admission that crowdedconditions forbid.The society was founded twentyfive years ago by Judge ReginaldThompson, who died soon afterward.Judge Robert W; Bingham, the FirstVice-President, and one of its charter members, then was elected President, which post he still holds.During its existence the Societyhas taken in nearly 4,000 children,and almost all of them have beenplaced in good homes. In hardly acommunity in the State is there notsome prosperous business man orhappy wife who was a ward. of theSociety, and in the majority of casesthese useful citizens of to-day werefound In squalor and amid surroundings that breed crime and poverty.Only by order of. the Tarious County Judges are children admitted, andnow that the doors of the institutionare temporarily closed, these .children must be placed in the squalidpoor houses to await the construction of the cottage village,o- THE KU KLUK KLANThe Congressional investigationof the Ku Klux Klan petered out,just as everybody with ordinaryF0RMEE PARISIAN PROBABLYCHIPPIE FOB LIFEAs a result of an accident whichoccurred near MIddletown, Ohio, recently, Ernest Orr, formerly ofParis, sustained injuries which willprobably cripple him for life.Mr. Orr was motoring along theroad between Cincinnati and Middletown, Ohio, when a big motor truckcame by. In attempting to pass thetruck Mr. Orr's machine skidded,colliding with the big machine,which had only one headlight burning. Mr. Orr mistook the truck fora motorcycle on account of the singleheadlight. His machine struck oneside of the truck, being demolishedby the shefek. Mr. Orr was thrownout. He was picked up by thetruck's crew, and rushed to a MIddletown physician's office. An examination revealed a dislocated kneecap and a fracture of the bone ofthe leg near the knee, which thephysicians say will probably cripplehim for life.Mr. Orr, who j had lately been residing 4n Covington, was for manyyears in the employ of the Louisville &x Nashville, on the throughtrain between Cincinnati and Knox,ville, Paris being one of his mainstopovers.. He has a large numberof warm friends here who sincerelyregret to learn of his accident.

That was someyears ago, but Poteet never had themoney to start a dwelling and hewould have been suspected of mental unbalance had he attempted totill it.Recently a geologist came alongand saw below the surface whatneither Davis nor Poteet had evendreamed of. Poteet agreed to leasethe lanw which cost him all of seventy-fivecents per acre. The secondwell which came in recently, is flowing 400 perrels per day. Well No.3 is being drilled.

As it is often not possible topredict just when this will be, travelers are unable to make appoint-Jments and are otherwise embarrassed. Another peculiarity of theEuropean service is that on busy circuits conversations in the majorityof cases are limited to a specifiedtime, from 3 to 6 minutes. At theend of that time the call is interrupted by the operator and the con-Tersation can be resumed only by remewing the application and waitingperhaps for several hours.oj iDyed Her Wrap,Skirt, Sweater,and DraperiesHIIIIMIIHIItMIIIIMHIMI MMltfEvery "Diamond Dyes" packagetells how to dye or tint any worn,faded garment or drapery a new richcolor that will not streak, spot, fadeor run.
