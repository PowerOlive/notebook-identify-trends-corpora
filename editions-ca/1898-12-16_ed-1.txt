thefuture of this government these differenceswere long ago settled by the arbitrament ofarms and the time has now come in the evolution of sentiment and feeling under theprovidence of God when in he spirit of fraternity we should share with you in the care ofthe graves of the confederate soldiersThe cordial feeling now happily existing between the north and south prompts this gracious act and if

and father could not spare usfrom the larm to go to this one so webad to get all the satisfactionwe couldfrom seeing it pass byWe tried to console ourselves by sayingthat we didnt think that it wasvery much of a circus anyhow SamWalling had told Jeff that his uncleJim had seen tne circus over in Kilburn the week before and he had saidthat it didnt compare with the circus we had seen earlier in the seasonIt is true that Sam had tried to modify this statement when he found that- Jeff and I could not go to the circusHe then told us that his uncle had saidthat the clown was the best and funniest clown he ever saw and that thetrapeze men beat the Dutch but wehekUSam firmly to his original state-mentaud insisted that the circus wasnp good at all Just as if there ever-had beer or ever would be a circus thatwas no good to two boys of 15 and 16years TPresently Jeff gave his hoe a liingand said eagerly Its comingJackI looked toward a big hill over whichthe road ran and saw the

spots as big as a dinnerplate One eye was closed permanently and three fourths of his tail wasmissing He was frightfully bony andhis bones cracked with every move hemade YVe got him on his feet after alittle while and drove him into our pasture The cows eyed him curiouslyfor a few minutes and then took toflight bawling wildly their tails inthe air An old steer being morecourageous came near when Egyptto our surprise gave the steer a kickthat nearl3 felled him to the groundAnd he winked his good eye whenhe did it said Jeff He did honestlyEgypt then lay down in a shadygrassy spot while Jeff and I speculatedwhat we should do with him if he didnot die We talked the matter over atthe dinner tableHes not going back to those ciicusmen unless they come for him said fatheri E saw enouo h of their

father Theres plenty ofit in the meadow and plenty of haywhen the grass is gone Jeff and Jackcan have him in partnershipThe news of our wonderful possession soon went abroad and all the boyswe knew in

thingsdesiring nothing in return but a lioeon old EgyptFathpr forbade this and said that thepresence of the entire boy populationof Hebron interfered too much with thework Jeff and I had to do on the farmSo the boys were invited to return totown which they did after various disparaging remarks in regard to oldEgypt Jeff and myselfI Four veeks passed and it was wonderful hew Egypt picked up He stillwas and ever would be hairless in largespots One eye remained closed hegrew not in tail or in fat but as Jeffsaid there was a marked change in hismannerIndeed he became positively friskyat times and would chase the cowsaround in the pasture as if enjoyingtheir terror VHe arid thesteef Had evidently made a treaty of peace for theywere the best of friends after the firstweek -Of course old Egypt was an object ofwonder to all travelers over the country road and Jeff and I felt that he conferred quite a distinction on our farmYou havent got any camel was ataunt Jeff was constantly

truthfulness of my statement There was a party of us fromthe Pacific coast stopping at the hotelin Honolulu in the year I mentionedKing Kalakaua was then on the thronelittle dreaming that his dynasty wasfading away forever to be mergedinto the American government Theold man for he then appeared to benearly 60 was wont to come down tothe hotel every evening from the royalpalace and mingle with the guests Hewas attired in ordinary citizens garbwith no insignia of royalty about himOn the evening I refer to Kalakauacame to the hotel attended by severalof his best musicians and most accomplished dancers We all went to thewineroom below which was also thebilliard room where we were entertained at length Later along midnightor after when the wine song and dancehad warmed his blood to the boilingpoint King Kalakaua leaped upoji thebilliard table with tho agility of acat and commenced to give us thehula hula or nativemuscle dance ing reat shape while we applauded himto his most effective efforts Whenhe had mi the gamut of the excitingdance some one bet him that he couldnot kick the chandelier He attempted it several times but failed owingperhaps to his exhaustion from thedance Then one of our party jumpedupon the table and kicked the chandelier from its fastening to the gasjet The flow of gas was quickly shutoff wiih a bottle stopper All the daihages were promptly

party remained throughout the performance for they did not regard itas anything out of the wajr for thehula hula is a part of the ancient religious rites of those barbaric peopleAsan evidence that the natives do notiregard the hula hula as lascivious theday after the performance I have justrelated an Italian count who had beenone of the guests with us and myselfwere in a wine warehouse attending

in thewarehouse spoke up in German toour amazement and after begging ourpardon proceeded to explain to us thatthe dance had no vulgar significance orsuggestion to the native mind Whenhe had finished I

manner buthave it pumped or crammed into theircrops by a simple machine consistingof a large funnel into which the foodis placed falling into a cylinder fromwhich it is pumped by a piston workedby a treadle through a flexible tubesome seven inches long direct into thefowls crop The birds are fed this waytwice a day The dexterity with whichhundreds of protesting birds are thusfed is remarkableOne of the Most Profitable If Aot theMost Profitable Branchesof FarmingThose who say poultry does not paydo so because in the first xlace they donot expend the proportionate time andbrain in caring for their fowls that theydo with their other stock says theWestern Eural In the second placethey do not keep an account hence themany little sums are overlooked whencompared with those derived from thecows for instance where many timesthe capital is invested Take care ofyour hens for one season credit themwith all the eggs and chickens used athome as well as those sold of coursecliarffinjr the

enlybecause it is a cheap source of proteinbut because it also has a high manurialvalue Practical farmers differ greatlyin their estimates of cotton seed mealSome seem to use it very satisfactorilyfor awhile and later conclude that thefeed is not well adapted for their purposes Occasionally a feeder observesthat the health of the animals is aff ected by the feeding of cotton seed toofreely and it sometimes happens thateven after animals have been fed formonths with apparent success that fljeyare injured by its continued use Ithas also happened that cows fed uponcotton seed meal do well for a

differentsources and different mills Withinthree weeks the station has examinedsamples varying from 22 per cent toover 53 per cenf of protein lThis greater variation in differentlots of cotton seed meal may explainthe different estimates of differentpractical feeders and of the same feeders at different times If a cow is feda cotton seed meal containing 2ti percent protein and is then fed an equalweight of meal containing 52 per centit is evident that the amount of protein which she receives will have beendoubled by the change If she has beenfed up to her full capacity in the
