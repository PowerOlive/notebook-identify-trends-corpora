THE BEST PHYSICIANS'
An August magazine is usually de
voted to fiction, but the articles in
the August American Magazine are
fully up to the standard set in the
other months. Thomas E. Wilson
the Chicago packer, tells how he
picks and handles men; Jack Dait
writes about how he feels at thirty
five; B. C. Forbes contributes an ar
ticle on the effect of war on busi
ness in England and the United
States; Jane Cowl has something to
say about the handicap of beauty In
the theatre, and Grantland Rice sings
of "Sunny Tennessee' in verse.
The fiction is at a high mark be
cause it includes stories by such writ
ers as William Dudley Pelley, H. C
Witwer, Ellis Parker Butler, Mar
jorie Benton Cooke, David Grayson
The Interesting People, Family
Money, and "Sid Says" are filled with
useful and entertaining hints, and
the results of the contest, "What 1
Would Sacrifice for My Country"
are also published.
HINSON CURTIS.
A marriage license was issued
from the office' of County Clerk
Pearce Paton, Monday, to Mr. Dow

The Carlisle Mercury, under the

The Mercury has very recently dis
carded hand composition and has in

dicates Editor Fisher's- progressive-
It has been talked over the county that I cannot
qualify and have no right to run for Superintendent of
Schools.
I have good reasons for not having qualified and
I assure you "I will" in due time. As evidence of my
right I will quote the following legal authority.
J. B. CAYWOOD

FRANKFORT, KY.
MR. J. B. CAYWOOD, Paris, Ky.
Dear Sir: You ask whether a candidate for
School Superintendent in the August primary is
compelled to have a certificate of qualification
before he may have his name placed on the pri
mary ballot.
This question has come to us a number of
times in the last few years, and we have held
that the Superintendent may obtain certificate
after the election. In other words, it has been
our opinion that if the Superintendent has the
necessary certificate when he goes to qualify
for the office on the first of January that he has
the right to qualify.
