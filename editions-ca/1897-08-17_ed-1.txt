theHorroiKilled HimOne of the most remarkable incidents of death by fright that I evercame across said a local celebritythe other day happened in Mexicoseveral years ago when I was makinga trip through the upper portion of therepublic on horseback We had in thecrowd a couple of Mexicans who didthe camp work and cooked for theparty which included besides myselfa couple of friends One evening one ofthe Mexicans was absent for severalhours from the camp and I started outto find him I went intothe direction I had seen the f eHowgoand I had not walked more than a quarter of a mile before I caught sight ofManuelo that was his name recliningin a comfortable manner against thetrunk of a small mesquite bush AsI drew nearer I was surprised to see thefellows face set in a fearful stare justas if he might have seen a ghost Myastonishment was considerably accentuated when I observed coiled in Manuelos lap a large rattler The snakewas swaying its head in a languorousmanner hissing slightly but not rattling It had not seen me as yet 33took out my pistol with a purpose oftlulling the snake as bad a marksman asI was and I dared not make a noise forifear the snake would bury its fangs imthe flesh of the Mexican I crept towardthe pair There was a sudden cessationin the hissing and the head swayed noimore It had heard me There was ajsudden uncoiling of its folds and beifore I could shoot the rattler slippedoff the lap of Manuelo and disappearedThe Mexican still gazed into vacancywith the same awful stare of horror Ihad first noticed I put my hand uponhis shoulder and there was no responseHe was dead Actually as it turnedout killed by fright He must havegone to sleep and while slumbering thefrattler had crawled from the bush intojhis lap Awakening the unfortunateman must have seen the snake beforehe moved and held fascinated by thejgaze of the reptile and realizing thatto move must be death had stood thejstrain until the horror had killed himN O Times DemocratGetting Rid

His eyes blazed andLis voice quavered with excitementBy the Mighty if ye dont get outo herePhilip stood his ground long enoughto show his contempt for the argument of force then he turned his backon the angry man and ran up the streetto catch an electric car for the newcourthouse As soon as he could finda magistrate he swore out a warrantfor Pragmores arrest and went himself with the deputy who was to serveit As a matter of course they foundthe office locked and empty and leaving the officer to continue the searchfor the notarj Philip went hack to theJohannisberg to prepare the papers Inthe suit against the town companyThe constable had promised to reportin the course of the afternoon andwhen evening came without any wordfrom him Philip resolved to go to thejail and see if Pragmorc had beencaught With the heedlessness whichgoes hand in hand with triumphantperseverance he left the forged deedtogether with the unfinished paperspn the writing table in his room atfehheiKhflftl and his

like a suddenstroke of illness that their object liadbeen to secure the gorged deed and hegrew cold with dismay when he remembered where he had left it Thenext moment he was racing madlytoward the hotel stumbling and falling over heaps of building material andpaving stones and colliding blindlywith chance pedestrians who happenedto get in his waylie breathed freely again when hereached his room and found that thepapers were undisturbed but the disquieting experience taught him thelesson of prudence which he mightotherwise have gone wanting Buttoning the papers into an inside jiocket 01his coat he went out again taking careto keep in the well lighted and frequented streets until he reached a hardware store where he could buy a revolver With the weapon in his pockethe felt safer and leaving Broadwayhe once more turned his steps towardthe jail Pragmorc had not beenfound and alter assuring himself thata description of the missing notary hadbeen telegraphed to the neighboringtowns on the railway Thorndyke wentback to the hotel Approaching thebuilding by a walk through thegrounds which led him beneath thewindows of his own room in one ofthe southern gables he was surprisedto see them brilliantly lighted andbolting up the stairway at the end oEthe corridor he was barely in time tosave the Johannisberg from destruction In his absence the room hadbnen thoroughly and ruthlessly ransacked and one of the gas jets whether by accident or design he never knewhad been swung around against themosquito netting which was blazingand dropping a shower of small firebrands upon the white counterpane beneath itWhen he had put out the fire andgathered up his scattered belongingsPhilip began to have a jusier appreciation of the desperate character of themen with whom he had to deal andhe determined to take no more risksAfter having his room changed hetelephoned to the stable for his horseand rode out to the Duncan farm sleeping that night in the attic bedroomwith the forged deed under his pillowXVON THE MOUNTAINThe level rays of the morning sunwere shooting across the easternspur of Johns mourlaia pouring a noiseless volley of radiance against the opposite cliffsof the Bull and bridging the valley ofthe Little Chiwassee with bands of yellow light that made the shadows blueand cool by comparison Up among thetopmost twigs of the tree the breezewhispered steadily with the sound likethe patter of gentle rain but inthedepths of the forest where the pathfrom Duncans to the plateau woundupward through the tangled undergrowth the air was still and resonantgiving back sharply the snarl of thegravel and the rustle of dry leavesunder the feet of the two men whoclimbed slowly toward the mountaintop Notwithstanding the approach ofautumn and the youth of the day theheat was great enough to make thesteep ascent laborious and exhaustingand Thorndyke stopped at the base ofthe upper tier of cliffs while Duncanwent down on his hands and kneesto drink from a spring bubbling clearand cold from the shelf of sandstoneIm no disputin yer courage yeunderstand that he said after he hadslaked his thirst Yere a bonny fighter Master Thorndyke I maun say thatfor ye but yell no win wi such a manas Sharpless at that gaitNo Im pretty well satisfied of thatnow though I still think there will bemore fighting than parleying in thecase from the way they have begun onmePhilip had been giving his companion a succinct account of the eventof the previous day as they climbedthe mountain and Duncan had consented to take charge of the deed untiiit should be neededHae ye made up yer mind what yelldo nextNot definitely As I told you awhileago it depends very much upon whatKilgrow says Yesterday I intended toprosecute immediately in both the civiland criminal courts but Pm not so surenow that that would be the proper thingto doAye said Duncan seating himself with his back against the cliff andmaking an inverted N of his sinewylengthNo to be frank about it I thinkI lost my head when that deed turnedup It was a foolish thing to go torragmore the way I did I might haveknown what would happen in case Iwasnt able to scare himAn can ye no sue them yetOh yes but they know as much asI do now and they will be preparedat all points We can beat them in theend but they can delay a settlementindefinitely And Pm more afraid ofthan of anything elseAyeYes They have ail the resources oEthe syndicate behind them while I havenothing They can give any amountof bail on the criminal charge andwhen we get our verdict in chancerythere may be nothing to recover fromBut man theres the whole townbuilt on Johnnie Keelgrows landYes its there to day andifrmaybethere to morrow but it has grown uplike Jonahs gourd and it may be quiteas short livedDuncan nursed his chin reflectivelyThats just what Bobbie Protheroesaye hintin at lies a sharp lad is BobbieOf course I dont know anythingabout it continued Thorndyke following his own line of thought butother towns have flourished and failedand Allacoochee may or may not proveto be an exception Anyway Id liketo get the thing settled while the pressure is high It will be easier to get50000 now than 10000 after the tidebegins to turnDuncans jaw fell and he stared atPhilip in speechless astonishmentFeefty thousand dollars he exclaimedwhen he could find breath to init hisamazement into words Eh man manbut yell be killin the goose outrightNo fear of that laughed Philiprising and taking the path again Andif they dont call off their desperadoesitll cost them moreHe spoke confidently but he wastroubled with many doubts and misgivings which poured in thickly upon theheels of yesterdays overconfidenceOne insurmountable obstacle the secondthought had brought up to block theway to a legal contest the court wouldrequire a heavy bond from the complainant and who was to furnish itKilgrow had nothing and the loss ofhis own fortune put it out of Thorndykes power to offer security Clearlythe thing must be managed in some waywithout a suit and Philips perplexitykept him silent while they were pushing through the woods on the plateautoward the PocketWhen they came out upon the cragfrom which Thorndyke had first lookeddown into the narrow valley they sawKilgrow working in the field below andDuncan summoned him by a shrillwhistle Thirty minutes later the oldmountaineer joined them on the cliff andDuncan laid before him a plan whichPhilip had outlined It was a proposalthat they should try to bring about a settlement of the claim by moral suasionbefore proceeding to extremitiesand Kilgrows presence at the conference would be necessary since he wouldhave to execute a quit claim in caseSharpless and Fench came to terms AsDuncan had foretold the old man refused positivelj and definitely hecould not be persuaded to trust himselfin Allacoochee and all the assurancesof protection that Philip could give himwent for nothingThen there is only one ofeier thingto do said Philip when he had exhausted his eloquence in the effort toconvince Kilgrow that no harm shouldcome to him youll have to give methe power of attorney to sign a deed for3011 Where is the nearest notary outside of Allacoochee Mr DuncanDuncan caressed

he finally yielded theytook up the line of march to the southward with Kilgrow leading the wayAfter threading the forest of theplateau for three hours or more theybegan to descend into a deep ravineand Philip heard the murmur of running water long before they came insight of the swift stream gurglingthrough a leafy tunnel at the bottom ofthegorge They stopped at the marginofthe brook while

hopewell get there before darkThe3r did but it was afternoon whenthey came to the end of the third division of distance and saw the scatteredhouses of the little village on the railway Judge Garrys house was pointedout by a passing teamster and Philipgoing in for information found thatthe judge was in Allacoochee but wasexpected home at five oclock Theywaited Duncan with Scotch resignation the mountaineer with an indifference born of long practice in the art ofdoing nothing and Philip with trueAnglo Saxon impatience When thejudge made his appearance the business was quickly dispatched and Duncan and Kilgrow started on their return over the mountain leaving Thorndyke to go to Allacoochee by the evening trainThe train was due at eight and whilehe was wearing out the second periodof inaction on the porch of the tavernwhere he had eaten supper Philip wasable for the first time since the findingof the deed to go back to the eventswhich had immediately preceded thatpiece of good fortune He had Helensletter in his pocket and he read it againin the thickening twilight It was agood letter after all he admitted sensible and practical and showing forthin every line the nobility and trueheartedness of the writer None theless she should have known she wouldhave known had she really lovedhimthat her proposal could be acceptedonly on the condition he had imposedthat a single sentence of warm affectionfrom her at such a time would have outweighed all the acts of self abnegationthat could be crowded into a lifetimeAnd yet he could not help wishing thathe had not been so prompt to returncold formality for kind hearted common sense She would doubtless beglad enough to be free oh that ofcourse but he might have been asfrank and informal with her as shehad a right to expect him to be astheir long friendship and engagementdemanded And just here a brush fromthe nettle of shame stung him nowcould he ever hope that she would attribute an3r but the basest motive to hisletter when she learned the truth aboutElsie Would she not always accusehim in her heart of having- been glad ofthe pretext afforded by his loss forbreaking openly an engagement whichhad been long ignored in secret Hewas sure she would and he checkedhimself impatiently when he foundthat he was setting the contempt ofthe woman he had asked to release himabove the love of the woman who hadsaved his lifeThat thought brought back to himElsie and the present Had she reallysaved his life Was it quite beyonddoubt that she was the one woman inthe world who could lead him out ofhimself into a sphere of usefulness andaccomplishment It was by no meansas clear and well defined as it had appeared to be on that day when he hadsat up among the pillows and fanciedhimself inspired Nevertheless as hehad accepted the help he must abide bythe choice of that day and he wouldcome what mightNo matter which way it turned thetrain of reflection led quickty to discomforting conclusions and Thorndyke was glad when the sound of a dislant whistle assured him that he couldpresently pass from the depressing atmosphere of introspection into temporary oblivion of action It was but astep across to the railway and he wastired enough to postpone taking it until it became a necessity The whistlesounded again and he sat lazily watching the eye of yellow light staringsouthward from the signal lamp overthe station while the rumble of the approaching train floated up the valleyon the evening breeze Had he knownthat Glenco was a flag station for thenight train and that he was the onlypassengerhe would have bestirred himself when the lamp flashed red and thenback to yellow again in answer to theengineers call for signals After thatit was too late there was a rush and aroar a discordant clanging of the engine bell mingled with the hissing ofsteam and before he could cross thestreet the train had thundered pastwithout stoppingCircumstances and the power topick and choose among thej ties have much to do with ones peaceof mind Half an hour earlier Philip1 had debated with himself thevsity fohurrying back to Allacoocheethat oit The small hotel was cleanthe supper had been of the kind whichprophesies a wholesome breakfastand hekwas weary enough to call it adays vork and go to bed None theless when he realized that his lastchanceMor reaching Allacoochee hadfaded lnto a distant roar and two redeyes staring back at him down thelong stretch of straight tTacknorth V of Glenco he was immediately possessed with an importunate devil of impatience As amatter of fact since there was an earlytrain in the morning it could make little difference whether he slept at Glenco or at his room at the Johannisbergbut it was a part of his plan that heshould reach Allacoochee at once andgo he must if he had to walk Somuch he said to the hotelkeeper whowas at a loss to understand the impatience of his guest A man mightwalk he said it was only ten milesAnd then again a man might ride if sobe he were willing to pay for a horsePhilip caught at the alternative and offered to pay liberally The horse wasfound and after many minute directions about the road which were aualifled repeated and

spectable Ise sure mammyvjxySyt mhid if we were going to f eshUncle Jack So Rex tiptoed on a chairfor the hat and primed the popgun aaand they went round by the sweet stuffhop because they generally went thatway with Uncle Jack and a heavy newpenny was burdening1 Rexs pocket Besides everyone knows that brandy ballsare excellent nourishment for travelersof they get lost in the woods And ifthey eat them before they get lost theymake sure of them and dont stickytheir pockets Thanks to such prudential measures the young explorersreached the plank across the ditch ingood spirits and as happy as bold travelers should always beThe plank was not a long one but thewater was so near Bexs feet when theydangled and it was such a good opportunity to shoot fish if they should appear that it took a good while to crossover Then they had to go the longway round the lane because the fieldwas full of cows and- as Babs saidCows are dTefihil fings cause zeymight be bulls So the autumn afternoon was turning to evening when theyreached the fish pond where Uncle Jackought to be But no jolly uncle appeared perhaps his mamma had puthim in the cupboard because he was sonaughty and made Auntie Jill cry

a pot on three sticks overthe fire and tell us where Uncle JackisSo they trudged on cheerfully a little farther But it got so dusk and thecows looked so large and wild in thefading light that they might almostbe real buffaloes which are very different from play ones as everybodyknows Babs shoe stuck in the mudand couldnt be found and Bex fell insome stinging nettles and they bothgot scratched scrambling through ahedge So poor little Golden hair satdown on a bank and cried and Rexstroked her head and would have criedtoo if crying hadnt been out of thequestion for a big boy who was nearlya

straight home but awicked smile crossed the old mans lipsthey had come out to find Uncle Jackand perhaps it would be a good thingif they found him He had seen himwalking distractedly about in SleepyHollow a few minutes ago and he knewsomething about lovers quarrels Whywhen he was courting Dame Margery40 years ago they parted forever oncea month But he didnt tell the youngsters anything about this only took upBabs on his broad shoulders and walkedalong so fast that Rex had to trot tokeep up with himWhy does you laugh Misser Burton inquired BabsOh because youre such a funnylittle girl to go hunting buffaloesBut it was Wex zat was goin toshoot zem apologized sheOh I beg his pardon said the jovialold farmer Perhaps he wTould like tostojf behind and shoot them nowBut Rex thought theyd better begetting home as it was so late Buffaloes he admitted in his private mindwere not so nice to hunt in the darkAs they were crossing the hollow abig gentleman came striding alongHeres Uncle Jack they both exclaimed at onceWhy Babs Rex cried he in amazement WhateverOh theyve come to look after youMr Jack said old Burton solemnlyTheyll tell you all about it Perhapsyoull see em home as it is getting lateSo saying he disappeared over a stilewith remarkable agility for his yearsand size All the way home he laugheduntil Rover thought that he must begoing mad like some ill balanced dogsin hot

the heiferBut not for many a long day did he tellthe story of the huntersWell you young pickles said Jackwho used to be uncle what the dickensare you doing here What the deuceam I to do with you he

CONSUMPTIONFresli Air the Best Prescription lotWeak LungsBy those who remember the crueldisappointment and the dashing ofbopes which followed the announcement seven years ago that Koch haddiscovered a cure for consumption thenews of the preparation of anotherremedy by him will not be hailed withunmixed delight It is possible that areal remedy for this disease may befound some day and when it is we maybe sure that there will be little delayin its adoption by physicians but thepremature publication of these allegedcures is greatly to be regretted because of the misery and heartrendingsorrow which their failure causes tothousands of disappointed sufferersBut while waiting for the discoveryof a cure for consumption we can useone which we have at hand in abundance and without cost to the patientFresh air fresh air and more fresh airis the chief prescription for one whoselungs are weak though fresh air likeany other remedy is of no service unless it is taken into the body Eor thispurpose exercise out-of-doors is neededexercise often to the point of fatiguein order to force the breathing expandthe lungs and fill them with pure airIt has been stated by a Boston plrysician that the use of the bicycle has lessened the amount of consumption amongwomen and if this is so the explanation is not far to seek Devotion to thebicycle leads women to exercise in theopen air and more energetically thanwould be possible for most of them inany other wayIn Denmark the postmen often havevery long routes in the couutry regionsand are obliged to walk or ride manymiles a in all kinds of weather butundesirable as such positions wouldseem to be they are eagerly soughtafter and of all men by consumptiveswho want to get well It has beenproved that the work is life saving fordespite the hardships and the exposureto wind and rain and snow almost allthe invalids who adopt the life becomrobust and heartyOf course to be effective open air exercise must be begun early in the courseof the disease and should always becarried out under the direction of a wisephysician since it must usuallj be supplemented by the use of tonics andqther remediesA great many are cured in this wayunknown to themselves for physicianstell us that a large proportion of thosewho die from other causes are found topresent the signs in their lungs of curedconsumption and there is little doubtthat the cure has been effected by natures remedy of which the patient hasunwittingly availed himself YouthsCompanionAnother MutterStrict devotion to the truth is comsee how I can marry your

braceup As a matter of fact he takes usually a cheerful view but when he is depressed as he is occasionally he isglum and silent and solemn enoughand he makes everybody around himwretched The children sitting at thetable stop talking the dinner getscold and everybody is chilly and miserable except perhaps at the last MrBilltops himself who finds finally asort of melancholy pleasure in the general depression that he has causedBut Mrs Billtops has no use for anybody that casts a gloom She has herown trials but she never bothers anybody else about them outwardly atleast she is cheerful and spirited always and she cant abide anybody thatlets his troubles so far overcome himthat he inflicts them on other peopletoo and so she saysIf there is anything I despise itsmelancholyAt that Mr Bllltop takes a braceHe looks up and smiles It is wonderfulwith what alacrity the children respond and Mr Billtops responds tothat and gloom is dispelled once moreby the ever grateful light of cheerfulness And when Mr Billtops as thephrase goes gets something to eat hefeels himself better still He remembers what he has often said to himselfthat no feeling of depression shouldever be accepted as genuine until it hasbeen subjected to the test of a goodsquare meal and he finds that the present one will not stand that test Infact under the combined influences ofMrs Billtops energetic

IajnryThe task of artificially rendering animals immune from snake poison wasnot an easy one for the process dependsupon training the animal to graduallywithstand larger and larger doses ofthe venom and considering the intensely toxic character of the substancewhich had to be handled the dangerwas ever present of the animal succumbing to venom poison before itsserum had acquired the requisite pitchof iprotective nower to render it ofservice as an antitoxin Dr Calmettetells us that he carried out a very largenumber of experiments before he metwith success But it is not necessaryhere to discuss his various effortsBuffice it to say that at length hislabors were rewarded and the following extract from one of his memoirs describes the methods which he nowadopts for his purposeThebest method of procedure for thepurpose of vaccinating large animalsdestined to produce ontivenomousserum consists in injecting them fromthe outset with gradually increasingquantities of the venom of the cobramixed with diminishing quantitiesof a one to sixty solution of hypochlorite of of lime The condition and the variations in theweights of the animals are carefullyfollowed in order that the injectionsmay be made less frequently ifi the animals do not thrive well Quantities ofstronger and stronger venom are inturn injected first considerably diluted and then more concentrated andwhen the animals have already acquired a sufficiently perfect immunitythe venoms derived from as large number of different species of snakes aspossible are injected The duration ofthe treatment is of considerable lengthat least 15 months before the serumis sufficiently active to be used for thepurpose of treatmentDuring the pat three years an immense number of animals have beenvaccinated by this method at the Pasteur institute at Lille where Dr Calmette is now a director and in a paperpublished a few weeks ago we are toldthat they have horses there which haveyielded for the past 18 months serumextremely active against venom Thesehorses receive in a single innoculationwithout the least inconvenience dosesof venom sufficient to kill 50 horsesfresh to the treatment LongmansMagazineUNCLE

share in the property ChicagoChronicleMniMiiiininer the StandardOne of the causes of the deteriorationof flocks of poultry is the practice ofselling off the old hens and using pullets Pullets will probabjy lay moreggs than will hens the first year butjchieks hatched from eggs laid by pullets are not as strong and vigorous asthose produced from eggs laid by hensIt is also less expensive to retain thehens than to feed the pullets a wholeyear before they are old enough to lajrHens are serviceable until five yearsold and sometimes longer the stockbeing lesa liable to disease and loss

necessary food produotthat -goes to keep a flock during theyear -and no one who desires to purchase eggs for hatching would ever buyof abreeder who keeps his fowls pennedup if he knew where he could get eggsfrom farm kept fowlsThere is just as good a market forhigh class poultry as there is forpoultry for market and the demand isBlways good for good stock The farmerwho keeps this kind of poultry has twochances to make money His flock willbe profitable as an investment at market prices and he will make many saleswithout effort at much above marketpricesIt is no trouble at all as the writerknows from experience to get from 50cents to one dollar a dozen for eggafrom high class hens during the hatching season and even at the smaller pricethere is an immense profit in the businessWith the better care that is alwaysgiven to good stock comes a greater return in eggs and meat for the feed usedand here is an additional profiton thetransactionThere is no excuse in these days thatjustifies any farmer in allowing hisflock of hens to remain mongrels Theman who does this is standing in hisown light and does not live up to hisopportunities It does not need fancyhouses

Tracxmtlnentnl JourneyThe three oddest things that I eversaw outside of New York said a NewYorker who had gone overland to Denver and returned by water by way ofGalveston were a donkey a dog and agoat The donkey had the native power of the single bQb tail car that goesup the hill on South Broadway DenverHe was an amusing fellow After Imade my first trip up that steep hillI was astonished to see the conductorunhitch the donkey and put him aboardthe car The dashboard was fitted upas a sort of stall and he stood theresideways when the car started backdown the hill under its own impetusThe donkeys face took on a delightedexpression as he found himself in therole of passenger He really seemed tobe grinning at tJbe conductor and thepassengersI saw the dpgs I was about to enterthe Tabor opera house in Denver Thedog was called Bill and he was partof the outfit ofa -cigar store in the operahouse building He was a black span-iel He was ragged up in zouave trousers and jacket trimmed with goldbraid and had a tasseled fez on hishead and spectacles on his nose Theoddest thing about him was that he saton his haunches with his paws in theair actually smoking a cigarette like aconfirmed cigarette fiend I found thathe had been trained to smoke the cigarettes while the audience was goinghrto the theater as an advertisement ofliis owners business That was thefirst time I had ever seen a dog smokingVI made the acquaintance of the goatdna tobacco factory in Key West Therewere 200 Cuban girls there nearly allof them pretty and all of them smokersor chewers of tobacco The goat wastheir particular pet He was the biggestgoat I ever saw almost as large as aShetland pony with big branchinghorns and perfectly tame He playfullybutted the girls or pranced aroundamong them His best trick howeverwas the larceny of their dinner basketsHe used to go nosing around until hefound a particularly choice luncheonHe would knock over the basket seizethe lunch and dash out doors with itNo amount of chastisement had everbroken him of the trick Of course Isaw wonderful scenery in the journeybut the donkey and the dog and thegoat were by long odds the most interesting living things that I encountered N Y SunNORWAYS VOTING LAWIt Is the Most Liberal of Aay Country In the WorldThe odelsthing the Norwegian equivalent of a lower house has passed thebill granting the right of franchise
