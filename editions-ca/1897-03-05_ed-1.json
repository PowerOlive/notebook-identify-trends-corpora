Never heard of Redmond OHanlon the
Irish highway robber Well jiig iuj
prising Your English Turpins fcBdJPMnch
Duvals couldnt hold a candle to oprJiifh
waymen But for all his shrewdness he
met his match once and Ill tell you how
it was
Redmond was a fine strapping gentle
manly fellow and a devoted admirer of tha
ladies as where is the Irishman that is
not and what is more a friend to the
poor ob youll admit when I tell you thai
his demands ioj cash were ctaly mie oa
persons rwho could well afford 46 meeH
them and that be delighted i f oyi eo
tributions from those wbo JmhI ih mm
of hard kmolords to their tenants There
was one of this class whom Rd4 by
er lost nn opportunity of taziag for thai
was the polite name he gave to kis own
robberies Every quarter day taig ajeBtle
mnn or one of his Bervants
morethan one used to take a journey of
six or seven miles to collect hie rents anil
as regular as clockwork there Wae Red
mond OHanlon with some stout eempan
lonsif necessary to waylay the- eelleotor
as he returned home Every means wai
used to elude him hut to no purpose He
had spies everywhere and contrived to get
the exaot information he needed in ad
vance
So one quarter day when the gentle
mans servants asked him about going for
the rents he swore at OHanlon and said he
didnt see the use of collecting money to
hand it over to him
Now this gentleman had on his estate a
hoy called Jerry the Fool who had the
run of the house and made fun for the
family He had a great conceit for himself
and when he heard what the master said
he immediately asked to be allowed to go
after the rents for once and daolared he
would know the way to bring them home
Of course1 he was only laughed at but
when he represented that no harm would
come from trying as he couldnt do worse
than all who had gone before him the
mafiter agreed to humor him Upon that
Jerry made such preparations as he thought
suitable chose the worst horse in the stable
an old hack half blind and three-quarters
lame and started on his enterprise
Nothing occurred on the way He collect
ed a considerable amount of money care
fully disposed it about his person and
started homeward
Toward evening as he was quietly jog
ging along on the old hack
entering a loneJane with
Hr
and wasr just
JiiRhiiieaosVri
each side a talljflpe locking maifroda up
to him on a handsome roan mare r v
God save you my man says the gen
tleman
God save your honor replies Jerry
Whats your name my man asks
the gentleman
Jerry the Fool and I aint ashamed of
it Whats yours
The gentleman took no notice of tha
question After awhile he says That is
a fine animal youre riding Jerry
Faith Im glad your honor likesit
said Jerry But it Isnt myself thatd
care to take a lease of his life Hut hed
serve my turn anyway for its not in a
hurry Im traveling Ive only been to the
village beyond to collect the masters rents
for him
Surely hes not such a fool to trust you
with that job s
Arrah why not asks Jerry In great
surprise h - - f v
Why dont you know that- Redmond
OHanlons on this road
Redmond OHanlon is it says Jerry
Ugh That for Redmond OHanlon
says he snapping his finger Faix Jerry
the Fool is a match for half a dozen of the
likes of him any day in the week and
Sunday into the bargain
The stranger laughed- and then rode on
in silence till th6y came to a very lonely
part of the road when he drew a brace of
pistols and told Jerry to hand over all the
money he had about him or hed try if he
had any brains by sending a couple of bul
lets through his head
Meala murther roars Jerry in sur
prise and fright You dont mean to say
your honors Redmond OHanlon
I do indeed So hand over my man
and look sharp about it
But faix its kilt entirely by the mas
ter Ill be when I get home without the
rink
Whats that to me said OHanlon
Anyhow said Jerry I must show
them that I made a murdering fight for it
Perhaps your honor wouldnt mind firing
a shot through my old beaver
OHanlon did so laughing at the trick
And now another through the breast of
my coat and heaven bless you This was
done Now just one in the skirt of It
and good luck to your honor
But Ive discharged both my pistols
and dont want the trouble of loading
them again for you
FaixI should dearly like a shot through
the skirts It would show I fought des
perate Are you sure your honor hasnt
another pistol in your- pocket that you
wouldnt mind firing for a poor boys
sake
Confound you To be sure J havent
Hand over the money or Ill beat you to
jelly with my horsewhip
Well says Jerry after a good deal of
fumbling I suppose considering the
trouble Ive had in collecting these rents
your honor wont mind the little bother of
going over the hedge after them
And he threw over a sack apparently
well filled with coin Half laughing half
angry the highwayman first aiming at
Jerry with his whip whioh he avoided by
ducking dismounted and climbed over
the hedge and no sooner had he done so
than Jerry slipped off the old hack and
mounted OHanlons horse -
Bad scran to youRedmond OHanlon
hehawled Didnt I tell you Jerry the
Fool was a match for a dozen of you Its
a sack of brass buttons youre gone over
the hedge after you thief of the world
And touching the fine mare with the pur
he galloped off singing the old melody
Go to the mischief and shakeyourself
