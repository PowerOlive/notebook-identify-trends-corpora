important success since the revolution beganThe utmost efforts of the Spanishluthorities in Havana have been exited to suppress all news of the engagementGen Gasgo at the head of 1500 menmet Gen Gomez on the estate of JuanCriollo Gomez was marching withJ 000 men Gen Gasco gave orders toretire while his rear guard was instructed to keep up fighting toprevent the Cubans from too rapidlypursuing Gomez ordered his cavalryto advance rapidly on the flanks ofthe Spanish column Gasco orderedhis column to form a square and standwith fixed bayonets against the CubancavalryGomezs cavalry and infantry thenbegan to fire As soon as the Spaniards sought to leave the square anddeploy themselves in guerrilla orderthe Cuban cavalry attacked them Thefight hacl been in progress two hoursand Gasco had already lost more than100 men killed when Gen Segura appeared with a column Segura advanced resolutely against the Cubancavalry obliging Gomez to withdrawthe two lines with which he was attacking Gasco The Cuban cavalrythen formed in one body to the leftand the infantry faced SegurastroopsBut unexpectedly for the Spaniardsthe Cuban artillery began to fire fromthe higher of two hills The dynamitegun did splendid work Three shellsexploding in the ranks of Segura blewup 50 menGasco was then on La Reforma estate Then Seguras force also retiredto the same place severely harassedSeeing

itsstaff correspondent at Cleveland OIntense curiosity exists to know thepolicy to be pursued regarding Cubaby the incoming administration I amable to state that policy on the highest authority and in the epigram inwhich it will be enunciatedThere will not be any meddling withthe Cuban insurrection or any triflingwith SpainEvery citizen of the United Stateswill have the absolute protection oithis government if war with Spain beprecipitated The first case of brutalityto a citizen of the United States willbe followed b3 immediate and unmistakable action on the part of the administrationMaj McKinley is opposed to a recognition of the republic of Cuba becausehe maintains that it does not existand that the only existing governmentin Cuba is Spain The granting ofbelligerent rights to insurgents heargues would relieve Spain to a largeextent of her obligations to this governmentNo claims of American citizenswould lie against Spain for the destruction of their property on the island by the insurgentsMaj McKinley is equally opposed toarmy intervention holding that conditions justifying such a step do not exist The president elect has recentlyexpressed himself in writing tothe above effect The firmness nfhis attitude on thedue Americans living orCuba is unmistakableprotectiontraveling inThe consulgeneral at Havana will not appeal tohim in vain President elect McKinlej will

discussion duringwhich the whole subject of the improvement of the Mississippi river wasgone overAn item in relation to electric lighting in the District of Columbia towhich Mr Hill dem N Y was opposed gave that senator an opportunity of expressing his views in relationto a Sunday session of the senate Hehad doubted the propriety of the senate meeting on Sunday to enact legislation for the people of theUnited States His attention hadbeen called to various petitions presented by honorable senatorsasking for a rest day for the Districtof Columbia and he had been disposedto acquiesce in the sentiment expressedin these petitions He also remembered that the senator from MichiganMr McMillan who had suggestedthis senate amendment had introduced a bill to Protect thefirst day of the week commonlycalled Sunday as a day of restand worship in the District of Columbia That bill if it had passed wasbroad enough to prevent any legislation on this day For those reasons hehesitated to engage in a general debate But now to be serious hecontinuedHave you not been serious all thetime a senator asked in low tonesThat is a reflection on the remarkswhich I have made Mr Hill repliedand then he went on with his statementThe amendment was adoptedThe last week of the Fifty fourthcongress finds the senate with thegreat appropriation bills in a morebackward state than for several yearsSix of the

the ground plucked oft his glovesand appropriated a valuable diamondring which was upon his finger Knowing however that it would be impossible very long to keep secret the possession of so valuable a prize he showed hisusbashi or captain his treasure and requested permission to keep itThe usbashi told the man that he wasquite right to bring the prize to himand that henceforth it should be transferred to the finger of the said usbashiThe soldier not satisfied with this arrangement referred the matter to thebimbashi or major who said that bothhe and the usbashi were highly culpablein daring to retain the ring from theirsuperior officer and that he woumtherefore relieve them of the subject ofdisputeFrom the bimbashi the soldier wentto thekalma kama or lieutenant colonelwho at once followed the example ofhis inferiors and took possession of theringThe soldier still persevered howeverand went to the meer ali colonel whodetermined that he was the rightfulpossessor of the ring by virtue of hisrank and dismissed the rival claimantsfrom his presence in the most summarymannerNext day a French officer attached tothe staff of Omar Pasha observed aprivate soldier prowling near the tentof the commander in chief The storyof the ring was at once related by itsoriginal possessor to this gentlemanwho laid the matter before his highnessand the man had not only the satisfaction of

A new dangerthreatens this unfortunate island andif it is to be averted a speedy settlementof the difficulties must be arrived atEvery day the situation is becomingmore desperate owing to the fact thatthroughout the island the state of warprevents any attention being paid tothe crops In the towns which are besieged by the insurgents the situatiouis much worse than it is in the

25000 jpersons Provisions arevery scarce arid a famine is imminentLarge numbers of refugees are alreadydying of starvation and it was theknowledge of this fact that led Korakas the Greek leader to issue his order permitting the cultivation of thefields near the townThe lines of the besiegers are absolutely impassable as has been provedby the failure of several sorties thathave been made The officials in thetown have telegraphed to Canea imploring the assistance of the foreignwarships in raising the siege but itis not considered likely thattheir supplication will receive afavorable response though provisionsmay be sent to the starving Korakashas not yet cut off the water supply ofthe town which he threatened a fewdays ago to do Should he carry thisthreat into effect the

Thursday morning thatConsul General Lee at Havana hadreceived his passports This rumornaturally caused excitementand a general desire was expressed to knowdefinitely whether Gen Lees con tern-plated withdrawal from Havana washis own act resulting from the acceptance of his resignation said to havebeen cabled last Sunday or whether ithad been brought about by the actionof the Spanish authorities in Cuba inwhich latter case its significance wouldbe much more markedInquiries in official circles eliciteddenials of the rumorThe well known fact was pointedout that passports were not given toconsuls but only to ministers and ambassadors that in the case of an offending or retiring consul the document sent him on his departure washis exequatur or official document recognizing his right toexercise the functions of his office and it was said that noteven the semi diplomatic positibnaccorded to our consul general atHavana by consent of the Spanish government would render his case wherepassports would be required Thereturn of his exequatur to the consulwould of course be equivalent to thesending of passports to a ministerBut at the Spanish legation as wellaat the state

his own clumsy movementsand the disagreeable ideas his presencesuggests But he is not altogether unappreciated depressing as he is andof him may be said with truth that hedoes no injury to any living creatureHe lives his harmless life and does hisgrewsome dutyWhat more need be said of anybodyMankind may not love or admire BrerBuzzard but they are forced to accordhini respect and protection The manwho kills him breaks the law and offends his fellow menBut there are many interesting thingsabout this undertaker in feathers thathave never been described probablybecause the general tendency has always been to let him alone and of allthe larger birds of this country thereis not one which is less intimatelyknown than thisHe can be seen on almost any day inthe southern states soaring high in thebluesky or dashing slantwise in windand storm a majestic and graceful object This is as near as most peoplecare to see himn his home life he is it must be acknowledged a mean and unpleasantci yature and yet even there he is notwithout interest to the lover of allthings which infinite wisdoniias placedvpon the earth Two species of thisvultuie improperly called buzzard inhabit the United States east of theocky mountains one of which rangesfrom New England to the Gulf of Mexico and is familiarly known as the furkey buzzard His scientific name isCathartes Aura and he is a very different individual from his humblercousin whose closer acquaintance weare now makingThe turkey buzzard is a somewhatlarger bird than the black vulture andis not black in color but a mixtureof black and reddish brown the latterbeing the prevailing color in hisplumage His beak feet and headwhere the skin is bare are of a brightred color and he is much less grotesquely repulsive in appearance than theblack vulture of the southHe also moves when on the groundwith a sort of dignified deliberationvery different from the clumsy hoppingand teetering stride of his blackcousin The latter Catharista Atratathe scientists call him is the commonscavenger of the far south where hebecomes as f amiliaa almost as the chickens in the small towns when coldweather or scarcity of food drives himfrom the woods and fields to the hauntsof men He has absolutely no redeem-ing feature of personal appearance Except when sailing high in air he is a dejected wretched hopeless and revolting object His color is sooty black except the tips of the wings which are ofa dingy grayish white this color being visible only when the wings areexpanded His beak head and barewrinkled neck are dull black and hiswhole aspect and demeanor is ludicrously appropriate to his ghastly callingHe is a bird of the semi tropics andcan but ill endure the degree of coldwhich is often felt in the Gulf statesin JanuaryAt such times he resorts to the townsand can often be seen on the housetopscrouched close against a smoking chtmney where sometimes a half dozenwill push and struggle together for thewarmest place When hunger presseshe will descend into the backyard and-walk about in his dejected clumsy waydisputing with the chickens for whatever scraps may be thrown outWhen he drops down from on highamong these chickens

soars faibeyond the reach of Ms petty enemiesHe meets with th same scornfultyranny from the turkey buzzardIt is an odd sight to see one of thelatter swoop down upon a flock of theblack vultures as they aire gatheredabout a dead chicken or other animalAll the black ones scramble out of theway hopping flapping and makingtheir hoarse hissing sound their onlynote and range themselves at a safedistance where they wait patientlyuntil their big cousin chooses to takehis departureThe two species are often found together but there is evidently a greatgulf between them and the blacksnever forget their humble and respectful demeanor in the presence of Cathartes AuraAlong the lower Mississippi river inMississippi and Louisiana all the smalltowns are protected from inundationby high earthworks or levees and thespace between the levee and the rivercalled the batture is a sort of no mansland Here garbage and refuse of allkinds is thrown and the floating housesof the fishermen are

loaded boats the vultures descendand crowd about the rafts where thefish are assorted waiting until thedead or worthless ones are cast asideA favorite morsel is the head of thegreat river catfish which is always cutoff before the fish is offered for saleThe fishermen like everybody elserecognize the utility of the vultures andencourage them until they become almost like pets and it is ludicrous tosee four or five of them seize a fish headand pull like boys at the old fashionedgame of French and English flappinghissing and tumbling about the groundin their efforts to drag the covetedmorsel away from each other In themidst of the ignoble struggle downswoops Cathartes Aura into the meleeThe black fellows fall over eachother in their efforts to get out of hislordships way and

what the negroes wholive along the batture call washingtheir clothesOne by one they drop down out of thesky at the meeting piftce each new arrival talcing up a position and keepingit in decorous and

wades bravely in and ashe goes deeper and deeper his feathersrise on end and he looks a picture ofcomic distressHe means business however andkeeps resolutely on until he is completely submerged except his headThen he washes himself precisely as aduck does flapping his wings rubbingand ruffling himself and dancing upand down in the water until his feathers are thoroughly saturated This accomplished

Faculties That JPvzzle Personsx Who Can SeeIt is a well known fact that personsivho lose one or more senses often develop remarkable qualities in thoseremaining This has seldom if ever beenshown in so notable a way as in thecase of Paul S Pinkham a resident ofMillbridge Me who though blind has Jsucceeded in building unaided a betterhouse than most carpenters in possession of all their faculties would constructPinkham has been bereft of sightsince he was 12 years old and he is now55The house which Pinkham built is aspacious house with a comfortableand roomy look a story and a halfhigh with a long ell one story highextendincr back from the main houseThe clapboarding is well put on andthe windows doors and exterior finishlook as if doneby an expert carpenterwhile the interior is as perfect in itsplan and construction as one could ex-pect Yet Paul Pinkham sightlessplanned the house and built it Thereis not a stick or nail or stone or brickin its construction from foundation toroof that he did not place thereAt 21 Mr Pinkhams father who hadbeen a well-to-do shipmaker died leaving him penniless and alone Theneighbors pitied poor blind Paul andit was the general accepted theory thatPaul would ere long find his way to thetown farm Paul was made of betterstuff Although up to that time he haddone little for his own maintenance heat once set about devising means whereby to support himself He feared at theoutset that his blindness ifright prove aninsurmountable obstacle to making hisway but he did not lie down under thefear He shipped with Capt Wilson ofMillbridge on the schooner Forest andmade one trip along the coast He soondiscovered that some latent sense orfaculty was developing enabling himto know of the presence of objects andto estimate distances What this senseis Mr Pinkham cannot explain although in him it has now reached ahigh stage of developmentHe next shipped on the schoonerSympathy and found the work moreeasily performed With this trip theseason was at an end and during thewinter he added to his savings by sawing fire wood and chopping cord woodThen he ventured into peddling clamsand was fairly successful With hisearnings he purchased a boat and fittedit out for lobster catehing He hired aboy to steer the boat while he attendedto the traps The danger which lobstercatchers fear greatly is in being nippedby the jaws of lobsters when landingthem Men with good sight are frequently thus nipped and receive painfulwounds yet Paul Pinkham handledills lobsters bare handed and so nicelywas the sense of touch or prescience orwhatever it may be termed developedthat he was never caught by a lobsteralthough he continued in the businessfor 27 yearsIn addition to his home Pinkham hasbuilt many boats that sail to day nearMillbridge and they are all goodmodels and easy sailers He ailso madosome fine showcases and various otherforms of fancy Woodwork His neighbors generally look to him for smalljobs of delicate repairing and he

WorkedThere axe a number of vegetablesthat -can be sown as early in the springas the condition of the soil will admit-They start to grow early and willsupply salads and early veeretablcs inguod season To secure the best results all preparatory work should bedone in advance so that at the first faAorable opportunity the planting canbe doneThere is no advantage in attemptingto make the garden until the soil isin condition to be worked readily intoii fine tilth But it is well to have everything in readiness One item is thoroughly to plow the ground Soil that iswell plowed and well drained will notonly dry out earlier but will warm upquicker than if left undisturbed untlispring It is always best to plow deepanil thorough and in finishing run out1 urro ws wherever necessary to provide good drainageWhatever manuring is necessary canalso be done daring the winter Themanure used in the garden should bethorughly rotted and refined for twoleasons One is that this condition isso that it can be well incorporated with the soil The other isthat in order to be available the plantfcod in the manure or fertilizer mustbe soluble and rotting and fining areessential in making it easily solubleAnother advantage in rotting the manure is that any wreed seeds it may contain will be destroyed It pays to manure liberally There is little dangerof having the soil too rich A goodrich soil thoroughly prepared is oneof the first essentials in having a goodgardenAnother thing that can be lookedaf ter in advance is the seed Good seedis another essential to a good crop ofnii3 kind and for the early garden it isaiecessary to secure what is needed ingood seasonIn making up the list it is always bestto rely upon old standard varieties forthe main crop trying novelties on asmall scale until their value is ascertained It is well to remember that theextraordinary growth and yield secured with iuany novelties are the result of the most favorable conditions-of growth and that varieties that dowell in one locality and kind of soiloften prove failures when grown underentirely different conditionsDo not get too many varieties With-quite a number one eaxly and one latesuffice while in

the woman who buys cigars forher husband said a cigar dealerThey say that she buys them at a bargain they are vile and that he is unableto smoke them But after all it is onlya joke There is no more foundationfor it than there is for many of theother moss covered old chestnuts thatused to delight our grandfathersWhile now and then a woman buyscigars that her husband does not likeusually they show good judgmentin the matter I know several of mycustomers whose wives have given themcigars for presents during the holidayseason and I dont think I ever heardany of the men complain There is nopresent that man enjoys better saysthe Chicago Times HeraldIf a woman wishes to give her husband a box- of cigars she will make nomistake There is no present that willbe more acceptable but she should remember that there is a great difference in cigars and that a man gets fondof one particular kind and dislikes mostothers Most women know that Sowhen she wants to give her husband abox of cigars she goes to the cigar storewhere her husband usually retscigars and tells the tobacconist that sheis buying them for Mr So-and-So Thecigar dealer knows the tastes of herhusband and will advise her in thematter Thus you see the husbandgets a good box of cigars just the kindthat he likes and another favoritetheme of the humorists is shown to haveno foundation in factSpecially RemeinlierThat the

not noticing a tar bucket hanging near me till aswell struck the ship and my head struckthe bucket and dashed the tar all over mywhite duck suitThe slop ohest a cask containingclothing which the seamen are allowed topurchase at any time being empty Icould hope for no assistance from thatquarter and so there was no alternativeleft me except that of wearing my tardaubed suit until I could wash rinseand dry a labor at which to tell thetruth I was never very expert the clothesin the washtubAs many of my shipmates would havedone under similar circumstances in raceafter the manner of mankind at large Ibestowed a number of wrathful blows anda number of forcible expletives upon thepoor bucket as if that was to blame andshould be punished for the accident whichwas the result of my own carelessnessWhen I was relieved from the mastheadI descended to the deck in no very pleasantframe of mind and rolling up my shirtsleeves made my way directly to the tubin which I had left my clothesA Malay a man of 30 with a long faceand nose and small twinkling blackeyes sat upon the windlass bit watchingme in such a peculiar manner that I stopped thinking he wished to say somethingto meHe turned aside his head however asour glances met and looked to leewardHe and I were not on very good termsas I had interfered on the previous day toprevent him from pounding our libtle cabinboys head with a crowbar He had sworneternal enmity to me from that momentand I doubted not that he would seek toinjure mo before we quitted the shipThe cabin boy entertained the same opinionLook out for him he had saidCheck is a viper and may try to poisonyou with some of those curious liquidslocked up in his ohestNever fear I had answered I shallkeep a sharp lookoutI could not help shudderinghoweveras I thought of the singular andhorriblecuriosities in my enemys chestHe had been a juggler in his native country and the trunk contained among otherthings several bleached skulls a numberof poisoned arrows and a large bottle inwhioh were three or four small spotted serpentsAye aye hes a singular fellow thisCheck I now muttered as I moved ontoward the tub What could have beenthe meaning of that curious look he gaveme There was a treacherous malicioussparkle in that eye of hiswhioh I did notfancySo saying I stooped over the tub andwas about to thrust my arms in it when Iwas prevented by the voice of the captainSo it was you was it thats been awasting all that ere water he criedGlad I caught you Jest take Check andanother and the yawl and reckonoyster theshore for some fresh water and dont be allday about itThere was no use of my attempting toexplain that it was salt water that I hadused for my ablutions The tanks wereempty and the skipper had evidently beenwaiting to set upon somebodyAnd I was the unhappy fellow pickedout to row along shore in the hot sun tosniff out a springI bad some work to get a chum to gowith me but the lanky Malay jumped atthe offerWe searched along shore for a goodwhile and yet had spied no fresh waterpouring into the bay The season wasagainst usAt last we came near getting agroundthanks to the swell that was rising whenas 1 had the boat hook in hand and mymate his oar the Malay sitting on thethwart doing nothing the latter beganwhistling between his teethNow it is all very well for a man to takehis ease when he can but when he wontbe satisfied with that but whistles over ittauntingly it provokes a manSo I turned round going to talk tohim like a father when whish something long and horrible darted by the sideof my head and my mate tumbled backasternThat action of mine had saved my goodfor nothing life for the Malay had whistled the snake out of the covert and Istood in its line of motionAs it was my messmates stumbling aftcaused him to lose his balance and fallbackward into the boatNever shall I forget the wild horriblecry that burst from his lips as he quicklylifted his head from the bilge iniwhich ithad been submergedHe tossed his arms wildly about startedto his feet and a moment after5 fell writhing in strong convulsionsWhy confound you what is the matterwith you exclaimed my mate but drewback a cry of terror bursting from his lipsThere lay the unfortunate Malay withprotruding tongue bursting eyeballs andlivid countenance rolling over and overand vainly striving to disengage from hisneck a deadly snake which had coiledabout it and was now darting with forkedtongue its venomous poison into his fleshThe struggles of the unfortunate manwere of brief duration and while land mycompanion hacked and pounded the serpentto pieces the death rattle sounded in thevictims throat and with one farewell gasphe rolled over on his back and expiredi My mate Tom Squid now threw hist hands around my neckYou have had a very narrow escapesaid he and I will praise the high adI miral all my life for saving you as he hasj doneSo ought I Tom said I It certainly was lucky that my turning Tound tojaw the beggar was the means of sparingme from the doom he lured on himselfThe big snake was brought aboard andevery one had his stare at it when it wasU d over the side after which the rei us of the Malay were
