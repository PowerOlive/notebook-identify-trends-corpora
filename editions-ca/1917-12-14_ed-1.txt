This-would be dreadful. It would interfere with the sacred custom of five-o'clock tea. Congressman Griffin,of New York, seemed to sense morekeenly the spirit of the age. A six"Ihour day is coming in the departments, he said.The country as a whole has never"Tbeen "able to understand why the-clerks could work but seven hours.It is harder than the usual schedule In private business.To hear Washington people talk,JiFnp'PM1 lllll Jll " ' -" i-ii ii ijT-rrrjw'r one would think the clerks a misunderstood and abused class of people. They are represented as grubbing out their lives in arduous ser-- vice that is not appreciated and isbut poorly paid.The government service has never-attracted a brilliant class of men.It is an honorable career, and con-editions should be such that an active man could get deserved promotion. But chances for advancementhave always been uncertain, de'' pendent on many conditions otherthan merit. The regular grind of- the work with short hours appealsto a great many who have not suc-ceeded very well in other lines, or-who liave few gifts for originating-their own ideas. They follow beatentracks, which finally become set ina vast labyrinth of red tape, de-structive of prompt efficiency. The"enlargement of the government'sscientific work, and the protection- given tenure of office by civil service rules, has no doubt attracted of-late a somewhat better type of men.The clerks have usually opposed-proposals to increase their workingday. Their attitude indicates thatTthere are still grave faults in the.service.

Many of our,people were much surprised Satur-'day morning when they found theearth shrouded in snow. However,this was but the beginning of the'surprise which followed Sunday, jMonday and Tuesday. Water pipes 'bursted everywhere, potatoes andother vegetables froze in cellarsthat were never known to freezebefore. The heating plant at M. M."I. was put out of commission, andstoves were hastily put up, untilthe breaks could be repaired. Manyhands and feet were frostbitten,some rather badly frozen. However,Providence had favored us in somerespects, as in the midst of all thissuffering the Millersburg coal dealers received two cars of coal, whichdid much to relieve the situation.The many friends of Lieut. J.W. Miller were surprised last Saturday when it became generallyknown that he had gone to Lexington, to be united in marriage to MissFrances Oney. Mr. Miller is one ofour most prosperous young farmers,a son of Mrs. Elizabeth Miller, neartown. When the call for volunteerscame he was among the first. Aboutthree months ago he went to FortBenjamin Harrison, at Indianapolis, where he distinguished himselffor his promptness of duty in everything imposed on him. Some weeksago he was made Second. Lieutenantand was assigned to Fort Riley,Kansas. Howevere, before goingthere, he was granted a few weeksfurlough.

Some years ago he andMiss Butler became sweethearts,and while they had to some extentdrifted apart, yet their love has always been loyal to each other. Mr.Kemper is at present employed witha road company at Hopkinsville.Some weeks ago the announcementof the engagement of this happycouple was given out. The time,however, was not definitely arranged until after Mr. Kemper's arrivalin Millersburg last week. A part ofthe early life of Mr. Kemper wasspent in and around Millersburg.He is a graduate of the M. M. I., andfor a time taught in the school. Afew years ago he moved to Alabama,where he remained until recently,when he secured the position whichhe now holds. Miss Butler is theoldest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J.A.
