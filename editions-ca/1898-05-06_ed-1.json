FTEE suffering for nearly tliirty years
from dyspepsia Mrs n E Dugdale
wife of a prominent business man of
Warsaw N Y writes For 23 years I was
a constant sufferer from dyspepsia and a
weak stomach The lightest food produced
distress causing severo pain and the forma
tion of gas No matter how careful of my
diet I suffered agonizing pain after eating
I was treated by many physicians and tried
numerous remedies without permanent help
Two years ago I began taking Dr lilies
Nerve and Liver Pills and Nervine Within
a week I commenced improving and per
sisting in the treatment I was soon able to
eat what I liked with no evil effects
I keep them at hand and a single dose dispels
any old symptoms
