Just a
Little Pain
The first touch of Rheumatism is a
fair warning of much torture to follow
The little pains which dart through the
body are not so severe at first possibly a
mere pang and cause little inconven
ience but if the warning is unheeded
they will multiply rapidly and increase
in severity until they become almost
unbearable
Rheumatism as a rule is much severer
in winter though many are so afflicted
with it that they are crippled all the
year round Those who felt its first
touch last year may be sure that with
the first season of cold or disagreeable
weather the mild pain of last year will
return as a severe one and become more
and more intense until the disease has
them completely in its grasp
Being a disease of the blood of the
most obstinate type Rheumatism can
be cured only by a real blood remedy
No liniments or ointments can possibly
reach the disease Swifts Specific
S S S is the only cure for Rheuma
tism because it is the only blood remedy
that goes down to the very bottom of all
obstinate blood troubles and cures cases
which other remedies cannot reach
Capt OE -Hughes the popular rail
road man of Columbia S C says
At first I paid very little attention to
the little pains but they became so
much sharpr and more frequent that
before long I was almost disabled The
disease attacked my muscles which
would swell to many times their natural
size and give me the most intense pain
I was ready to doubt that Rheuma
tism could be cured when I was advised
to try S S S This remedy seemed to
get right at the cause of the disease and
soon cured me completely I believe
that S S S is the only cure for Rheu
matism for I have had no return cff the
disease for eight years
The mercurial and potash remedies
which the doctors always prescribe for
Rheumatism only aggravate the trouble
and cause a stiffness in the joints and
aching of the bones which add so much to
the distress of the disease besides serious
ly affectinsr the digestive organs SSS

A PRIVATE AMBULANCE
Eemlniscences of the Civil War Belated
by an Old Soldier
Among the men wounded in my
regiment at a battle in Virginia said
the old soldier was a man in my com
pany who was shot through the body
and taken to the rear Our troops fell
back after the fight and we had more
wounded than we had transportation
for but two men out of his own tent
set out to carry this man wherever we
were going which was presumably
the camp behind intrenchments that
wed left in the morning
They took turns at backing him for
half a mile or so until they came to a
farmhouse that had a grassy yard in
front They laid him down on the grass
and took a little look af ound the house
to see what they could see In a build
ing at the rear they came across some
thing that made em stand still and
look at each other and laugh It was a
-hand cart What use the folks here had
made of it they couldnt guess but they
knew what use they were going to make
of it T hey got it out f the building
and polled it around the side of the
house alongside the wounded man and
dropped the handle on the grass He
laughed too when he saw it He was
going the rest of the way in a private
ambulance
The two men took their blankets off
their shoulders and untied them and
spread their rubbers down on the bot
tom of the hand cart and spread their
woolen blankets down on them and
then they ran the hand cart up and rest
ed the handle on the front steps of the
house and lifted in the wounded man
and laid their guns in beside him Then
they turned the cart around again and
one man got inside the shafts with the
crosspiece aganst his waist belt and
the other man got behind to push They
all smiled again when they started
wounded man and all
It beat backing him out of sight It
was dry weather and the roads were
sandy and up hill and on the level the
wheeling was hard But there was
more down hill than there was np
places where they had to hold back
and it was all immensely more com
fortable for the wounded man and so
they got him back to camp and to the
surgeon again But he died after all
New York Sun
FORTUNES FROM GARBAGE
Science Converts the Refuse of Cities Into
Steam Fertilizers Soap Etc
William George Jordan writing on
Wonders of the Worlds Waste in
The Ladies Home Journal says The
garbage of a great city is worth a for
tune every year if properly utilized In
St Louis the refuse is placed in enor
mous vertical cylinders surrounded by
steam jackets which evaporate the 75
to 80 per cent of water in the garbage
The fatty substances are dissolved and
as the result of a number of processes a
fertilizer is produced which is worth
from 9 to 12 per ton the demand ex
ceeding the supply One of the purest
and best soaps of the country was made
of garbage grease before cottonseed oil
entered the field It is now proposed to
light London by electricity for nothing
It now costs that city 108 4s 8d to
get rid of a ton of garbage A combina
tion of rollers and other apparatus has
been devised that can burn the garbage
at 24 cents 1 shilling per ton and gen
erate steam sufficient to run enough dy
namos to light the entire city London
can thus save 3s 8d on each ton and
in addition illuminate its city without
cost Garbage by a machine called the
dust destructor is converted into clink
ers which can be used for roadways as
artificial stone for sidewalks and as
sand for mortar and cement In Paris
the invisible particles of iron worn
from wheels and from the shoes of
horses are rescued by passing powerful
magnets through the sweepings
A Vision of the Future
Clarence King formerly chief of the
United States geological survey says
The time is not far distant when
a man can start out of Denver and
travel to Klondike stopping every night
at a mining camp Already two Ameri
can stamp mills are pounding away on
the borders of the strait of Magellan
and the day is approaching when a
chain of mining camps will extend from
Cape Horn to St Michaels I believe
we are about to enter upon a century
which will open up vast resources and
will be the grandest tho earth has ever
known Before the end of the twentieth
century the traveler will enter a sleep
ing car at Chicago bound via Bering
strait or St Petersburg and the
dream of Governor Gilpin will be real
ized
Slang
The difference between ancient and
modern slang was amusingly illustrated
in a recent incident at the Chautauqua
assembly when the teacher of English
literature asked What is the mean
ing of the Shakespearian phrase Go
to and a member of the class replied
Oh that is only the sixteenth century
expression of the modern term Come
off The two phrases while appar
ently opposite do in fact substantially
mean the same thing Chicto Chron
