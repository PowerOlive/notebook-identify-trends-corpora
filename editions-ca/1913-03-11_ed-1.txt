JudgeStout was delayed enroute by reasonof not being- able to make connectionsatJLexington and did not reach thecity until after eleven o'clock when heconvened the session of the court.Hon. Victor Bradley, recently aopointed Commonwealth's -Attorney tosucceed Col. K .B. Franklin, who resigned to devote his time to the practice of law, was present at the opening of court and was sworn in by Circuit Clerk Webb. This is Mr. Bradley's first term as prosecutor in theBourbon Circuit Court since his appointment. Following the reading of the docketand motions, Sheriff A. S. Thompsonand his deputies, J. G. Marshall, W.F. Talbott and Ernest Martin weresworn and the grand jury impaneled.The following'compose the grand jury :C. A. Webber, foreman, John Marston, S. L. Weathers. W. H. Clark, T.B. Nichols, Robert Meteer. CatesbvWoodford, Jr., C. L. Stephenson, W.W. Hinton, J. Frank Clay. W. M.Rogers and H. A. Power.Judge Stout's charge to the grandjury was very brief but he covered theground thoroughly. He said that hehad been informed that gaming waspermitted to go on unmolested in Pansand urged the body to investigate thecharges that would be' brought beforethem and chargedtne jury to conducta rigid investigation of any infractionsof the liquor laws, especially that ofselling liquor to4minors.In the course of his remarks hecalled the attention of the grand juryto the nractice of carrying concealedweapons. Homicides, he said, woulddecrease in numner if the law prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons was enforced. After the chargeto the grand jury was delivered thebody retired to begin its deliberations,taking up the cases first where the defendants were in jail and unable toexecute bond.The call ot the ordinary appearancedocket was made yesterday morningbefore the adjournment. The numberwho have been summoned o jury service will report to the court this morningwhen it convenes at 9 o'clock.Judge Stout will adjourn court hereSaturday to go to Versailles where hewill hold a special session of theWoodford Circuit Court Monday totry Silas Williams, the confessed slayerofMr8. Susan Black, of Troy. Woodford county, and who inflcted seriousinjury upon Mrs. Myrtle Moffit. Williams was jndicted at the regular termof the Woodford court.

The building, whichwas aIarge frame structure of eightrooms, two school rooms on the firstfloor and six living rooms on the second, loated in the rear of the Catholicchurch, was an easy prey to the flameswhich SDread rapidly.When the fire was discovered theroof of the buiiding was blazng fiercely and a brisk West wind, which wasblowing, fanned them with a fury thatthreatened to communicate the .blazeto a Dortion of the residence section onHigh street. The firemen had greatdifficulty in confining the flames to thebuilding where they originated. Although they did excellent work thebuilding was left' an entire wreck.Several times a stable belonging toWilliam Grannan in the rear of hisresidence and which is leased by Stuart & O'Brien, was on fire, large firebrands being blown bv the wind uponthe shingle roof. These were extinguished with no damage to the property. The building was erected abouteighteen years aso under the Dastorateof Rev. Father E. A. Burke and costabout $6,000. Insurance to theamount of S3,000 was carried on theproperty.The Catholic sisters, four in number,had in charge about eighty pupils, andsteps win be taken to secure suitable,quarters where the school can be coritinued until the remanider of the term.They were cared for at the residenceof Dr. F.

JiAn Expanding IndustryThe poultry, in Kentucky, accordingto an official of the Experiment Station, is worth nearly as much as Talllcne sneep in me state ana anour, oneLhalf as much as the total number kottnogs, says rtne uourier-Journal.'Kentucky is attaining some prestige as a poultry State and the industry is a growing one. With the exception of Texas no .Southern State exceeds Kentucky in the extent of "itspoultry interests, though some of theNorthern States and the neighboringstate of Missouri are far in advance,as shown by the Federal Census reports. By the census figures of 1910Iowa, Illinois and Missouri ware theleading poultry states, in the ordernamed, in the number of fowls. Eachof thefeStates"repbYted more than 20,-000 domestic iowls of,all kinds, while 1Kentucky reported nearly 9;000,0d0.Thepoultry Jiarrasafe becomingeecry yeajnore numerous,..

This mav very likely be the explanation of the vandalism reportedfrom the Gettysburg battlefield, whereeight battle munuments were badlydamaged bv some miscreant armedwith a heavy hammer. The worstof it is that so few vandals aie evercaught, or if they are caught, aru nottreated as they deserve to be. Athirty day sentence is about the limitof the punishment imposed for such anoffense, and unless the offender shows iunmistakable signs ot a disorderedmind no one"ever seems to think of examining him as to his sanity.The erection of new public monuments, most of which are real worksof ait and deserve to be protected andpreserved, is going on at an increasingly rapid rate in this country. Unfortunately the vandals seem to bemultiplying quite as rapidly.Warrants Called In.State Treasurer Thos. S.

It isexpected that this census will be themost authentic ever taken in the State.Nearly every countv census has beeninspected, and all the others will bebefore April. So lar an average ofabout 100 names to the countv havebeen stricken from the lists, and everyperson included who was 119 vears ofage was checked, so that they willnot be included in the 1913 report.Besides this more than 6,000 have beenstricKen from the'eity census reports.The State school fund is distributedon a per capita basis, and it is considered imDortant to have the census correct ; since, if it is too high that countywill receive more than its proportion,and, if too low, the county will receivp more than its proportion, and, iftoo Jow. the county will receive lessthan it is entitlled to. Another reason for desiring the census noi to bepadded is that thejotal census wouldtben make a bad showing, comparedwith the enrollment, and put the Statelower than it deserves in apparent illiteracy. The department is receiving muchhelp from teachers in this work, sincethe salaries are nartly basedfon the percentage of enrollment, and they arefighting against the padding censusreturns. In Bourbon and other countiesof the State, it was discovered lastyear that gross frauds had been committed in the taking of theschool census and the department is on the lookout this year.Bock Beer,We will have on tap to-dav the celebrated John Haucke Bock Beer.BENNIE WEISSBERG.

W. Bacon, of the Parisclub, but from the failure of a sufficient number of directors of the clubto put in their appearance the meeting was called off. Those who attended, however, discussed the conditions which now confront the club a'ndit was practically decided that unlessfunds could be raised with which tomeet the expense incurred during thetraining season the players no-ar undercontract would be released and thefranchise thrown uu.William Shire, secretary ot'the ParisClub, who has been one of the mostenthusiastic officials of the club sincebase ball was inducted in this cityfour years ago, and who is extremelypoDular all over the league circuit, isconsidering a proposition to take overall the stock of the club, assume all ofits liabilities and give Paris a goodclub during thecsmiug season providedhe can enlist the support of some goodi man to look after its affairs. To devote his entire time to it would be im-J poFsible and woukl interfere with his! business interests in this ciiy.I A number of the stockholders in thelocal club have signified their willingness to turn over their stock to Mr.Shire in event that he should reporti favorablyon the proposition. OthersJ will likely follow their example.Mr. Shire ia'of the opinion that ifj teairs are placed in botn Covington'and Newport it will serve vto promoteinterest in the clubs already composing the league and js awaiting the decisionof the Federal Court at Covingj ton upon the suit instituted by SenatorL.
