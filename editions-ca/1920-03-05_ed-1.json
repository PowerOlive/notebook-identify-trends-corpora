(Contributed.)
, The many friends of Miss Jennie
Whittington will be delighted to
hear that she is sitting up, and was
able to be wheeled out into the sun
parlor yesterday. Her bright, sunny
disposition and vivacious spirit, de
spite her eighty-one years, have had
much to do with her recovery, and
have been an inspiration to all who
have visited her bedside, and a help
and comfort to us as we journey
along day by day on life's pathway.
Mrs. A. H. Barclay, now eighty
six years old, has been an inmate of
the Hospital for over a year. After
much suffering and discomfort she
was getting along nicely, able to
walk around her room, when she
slipped r-nd fell. Fortunately no
bones were broken, but a wrenched
and sore condition of the muscles
have put her to bed again. She is
lying there patiently, assured that
"some day she'll understand."
Mi?s Belle Ogden's condition is
much improved, and she hopes to re
turn to her home again soon.

Farmers really did not know
whether they were making any
thing above their "bacon and eggs"
on their farms. But these days have
gone forever. The' progressive bus
iness man of to-day can look at his
books and in a short time tell you
where his business stands. The up-to-date
fainer knows whether his
farm is a business success or just a
place to exist. They have applied
system to their work. There are
many evidences that th.e church of
to-day has become dissatisfied with
the old happy-go-lucky ways of do
ing its work. That the church is
applying business sense to its ser
vice for God and humanity. One of
these evidences of progress in the
ciiUich is the "Every Member Can
vass" program which the Southern.
Pre&byterian church is staging. It
jlS a sySWiianc canvassing ui. uveijr
member of the church to solicit tneir
interest in the work of the church
and their gifts to the church. Its
policy is that no widow is too poor
to want to give her mite. And that
the rich man have the privilege
of giving as the Lord has prospered
him. The church is of and for the
highest and the lowest, the young
est and the oldest, roch and poor,
"banker and the laborer, and each has
the right to demand, and the privil
ege of taking an interest in its
work, of benefitting from its Minis
try, and of helping in all of its
causes. The Paris Presbyterian
church is making the effort to put
this kind of "Systematics" into'
their church work.
