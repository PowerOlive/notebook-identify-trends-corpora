statement concerning the- jointconference issued by the operatorspress committee Tuesday night followsThe conference committees of thecoal operators and the officials of theminers failed to agree and adjournedfinally The miners were representedby their national and district officersOperator J B Zerbe was chosen chairman of the conference and W CPearce of the miners secretary MrZerbe stated that it was desired tobring about a settlement of the strikeMr Ratchford stated that he and hisassociates were empowered to entertain discuss and decide upon any propositions the operators might submitChairman Zerbe asked that the question of interstate agreement be waivedand this was assented toMr Ratchford then stated the termsupon which the miners would returnto work saying that they would go towork at once on the 69 cent rate beingpaid until such time as a board of arbitrators could make an award of whatwould be a fair wage rate any excesspaid to the miners above the award ofthe arbitrators to be deducted from thepay of the miners following the awardThe operators stated their reasons whythis could not be accepted and in lieuthereof submitted four propositionsfor arbitration one that the menshould return to work leaving to arbitrators what rate shall be paid oneleaving the question of rate open untilafter a award has been made onethat the arbitrators decide within 10 or20 days the miners remaining idleandone that the arbitrators have 30 davsin which to decide the miners remaining idleAll these were peremptorily rejectedby the miners representatives and theconference adjournedThe operators feel that in submittingthese various propositions for a settlement by conciliation or arbitrationthey have exhausted every effort intrying to bring about a settlementwith the officials of the miners Theproposition of Mr Ratchford could notbe accepted because it means an advance of 27 per cent in wage cost andwould entail irreparable losses uponthe producers The price at whichcoal contracts have been takenfor this year were enforced bythe conditions which ruled the marketin open competition from other producing fields It should be rememberedthat operators are confronted constantly with two forces the pressure ofbuyers to get the lowest price which isdetermined by a remorseless competition and by the miners who demandthe highest wage rate at all times

you to closethat drawerIn the duel of words Sharpless hadbeen reflectively measuring the distance between himself and the coatpocket into which Philip had slippedhis hand at the beginning of the interview The deductions were evidentlyupon the side of prudence for he shutThe drawer with a snap and turned awayfrom the deskGoing back to the original questionyour demand is unreasonable and ifit were not there is not such anamount as you name in all the banksin the cityProbably not and in any event Ishould prefer your draft on New Yorksecured by a mortgage on all the property of the company

roused himself to speakFor Gods sake Sharpless dont triflewith him give him what he wantsNone the less Sharpless fought desperately contesting every inch ofground It would take time to drawup the papers he must at least be allowed to telegraph New York he hadno idea that his draft would be honoredwithout explanations To all of whichPhilip turned a deaf ear and pointedinexorably to the alternative He musthave the draft and the security or thelaw should be allowed to take itiscourse When it finally came down toa mere question of the time requiredfor the preparation of the

can I shant be able to breathecomfortably- until the mortgage is onrecordXTXCONFESSION AND ABSOLUTIONProtheroe tried to make himself believe that he should not have allowedPhilip to persuade him to go back toDuncans after the recording of themortgage He argued that it would bebetter on all accounts if he should dropquietly out of the small melodramain which he had at the first figuredonly as a supernumerary The resolution hung in the balance while he waited at the courthouse for Thorndykeand it was the thought that he stillowed Elsie some indefinite debt of apology and explanation that finally turnedthe scale in the direction of Philips urgings On the way up the valley he triedto reconstruct his dismembered idealto the end that he might be able to witness Philips triumph with some outward show of equanimity and whenthey reached the farmhouse he foundthis easier than he had anticipatedWhile Thorndyke was deservedlythe hero of the day the rejoicing in the Duncan household wassincere enough to be infectious andbefore he knew it Protheroe was extolling Philips courage and perseverance quite as honestly as any of theothersWhen the excitement had a little subsided Philip asked how Kilgrow couldbest be reached Duncan wanted toclimb the mountain himself but hiswife objectedItll just be flyin in the face o Providence wi your rheumatics Jamieand thatll no do whatever she saidand when Protheroe offered to go afresh difficulty aroseYe wouldna find auld Johnnie in amonth o Sundays Robbie lad Dinnaye ken hes hid awa f rae Sharpless anhis gangThen Elsje came to the rescue

couldB What have you done she askedfinally determine whether to be glad orsorry he found himself helping Elsieup the paith on Johns mountain Withthe unlimited opportunity for freespeech his confession stuck fast in histhroat At first Elsie was- too joyousno man in his sober senses could pleadhis cause before a judge whose ebullient happiness overflowed all the approaches to fceriousness And afterward when his taciturnity had dampened Elsies enthusiasm the difficultieswere increased rather than diminishedAfter a time they stood together uponthe brink of the Pocket and Protheroerealized that it was then or never ina few minutes they would be with theold mountaineerWait a minute please he said asElsie was about to lead the way to thepath down the cliffShe stopped obediently and the fearthat delay would bring more irresolution made him go on quickly I wantto tell you how sorry I am for what Idid the other day I know it was inexcusable but I have done what I couldto atone for itShe was standing at the verge of thecliff clinging to a small tree growingout pf a crevice in the rock and lookingdown into the billows of foliage belowWhat have you done she askedIt isnt much I

he made an involuntary step toward her when she leaned over the edgeof the rock Then he saw that she wasshaking with suppressed laughter andpenitence very nearly became wrathWhy are you laughing at me hedemandedBecause youre so ridiculous sheretorted facing him suddenly Whatmakes you talk as if Mr Thorndyke belonged to me What right have you tothink that he is anything more than afriend of my fathers like like yourself How do you know that he isntengaged to the young lady in New Yorkwho writes to him every weekProtheroe made a praiseworthy attempt to be coherent but it endedrather tamely Then you then Ihave been mistaken all along in thinking Elsie please come away from thatcliff and tell me you forgive meI wont not till you catch meAnd with a mocking laugh in whichthere was more joy than derision sheslipped over the edge of the rock andwas nearly out of sight in the path below before Protheroe gathered enoughpresence of mind to accept her challenge The chase was short and vigorous and when it was ended the processof forgiveness appeared to be somewhat abstruse and complicated judging from the time which elapsed beforethe young man and the maiden presented themselves in

satisfactory score is played with a cue balls anda ring fastened in the groundThe game is a favorite and one easilypossible even if the space at ones command is limitedA circular space is chalked off of anydimensions desired In the center ofthe circle is a revolving ring made ofiron or brass It has a shank and whenit is to be used a large wooden peg isdriven into the ground with the topa little below the surface and into ita hole is bored large enough to receivethe shank of the ring and to let it revolve freely Half the fun of the gameconsists in having a ring only just largeenough to let the ball pass throughand the ring must be so neatly poisedas to revolve -with a touch The bestplan for securing this is to have a metalsocket let into the wooden peg If socare must be taken that the socket bebrass if the ring is iron and the reverse Both shank and socket should bekept well oiled The cues have woodenhandles and a metal tip which is ringshaped and fixed at an angle with thehandle This formation enables theball to be better played than if the cueand tip were in line The balls aboutone foot in circumference are of rubberand are very hard each one is paintedwith a rim around the center of a different color- Each pla3rer has her owncue and ballThe object of the game is to passthe ball through the revolving ring andthe player scores a point every time shesucceeds There is in this game moreplay than at first appears If for example a player in sending her ballthrough the ring strikes another balleither before or after she adds two toher score If a player finds the ringturned edgewise toward her she caneither place her own ball so as to obstruct the next stroke of the enemyor by dextrous play at the ring turnit edgewise to the enemy next in succession The clever player will strikea ball belonging to her own team soas to put it into position or will strikeaway the ball of an opponent who seemslikely to make a successful strokeA really good player will often contrive to pass the ring even though itbe almost edgeways to her If the ringbe turned in the least to one side orthe other she will play at it with a peculiar push of her cue and strike it alittle on one side If this is properlydone and with moderate force the ringspins round and catches the ball in itsprogress The effect of this suddenshock is that the ball vibrates backwards and forwards for a jmoment andfinally settles on the opposite sideIt must be borne in mind that theball cannot be pushed through the ringwith the cue touching it neither mayit be thrown through AmericanQeenMAKE YOUR OWN

his browIn heavy wrinkles his whole framequivering with passion I had just toldhim the terms of Uncle Harry Wellfords will for he had been in New Orleans when our uncle died and reachedhome three days after the funeral Itwas a letter fromMr Hay I said thatalmost killed Uncle Harry We thoughthe had made a new will but it couldnot be foundCecils face brightenedA letter from Mr Hay A new willlie said musingly but keeping his eyesTceenty bent upon my face Why didyou think thatMr Potter told Willard so but wecould not find it and and Willardseemed to be pleasedNo doubt The cur No doubt thenew will gave me the rights of whichlie has robbed meOh Cecil dont please dont Ipleaded Willard is not a cur or athiefAnd yet I said it f alteringly for wasnot Cecil- my cousin and betrothed andWillard only my guardian under UncleHarrys will and scarcely even a friendas yetBut Cecil clenched his hands hard amoment and sardTell me again the terms of this unjust willUncle Harry has left me the houseand 10000 and to you 30000 all therest the factory the real estate inNew York the bank stock you knowCecil all the rest goes to WillardI shuddered at the oath that brokefrom Cecils lips But Mr Hays letter he askedUncle was very ill when that cameand he sent for Mr Potter at once Icannot tell you any more exceptingthat a search was made for the will andWillard seemed relieved when it wasnot foundCecil made no reply to this His anger seemed to have been rising till itmade him speechless He strode out atthe French window and down the garden path while I threw myself upon thesofa and cried as I had seldom cried ivnil my petted life For Cecil was mybetrothed had been away more than ayear and I fancied I loved him Hisletters had been brief and cold for along time and now after one cold caress he had spoken only of Uncle Harrys will not one loving- tender wordto me doubly orphaned by our unclesdeathWillard was not our own cousin butUncle Harrys stepson and much olderthan either Cecil or myself We werestill children when Willard was sent toParis to take charge of the importations for our uncles business and hehad lived there until Cecil went to NewOrleans to control a branch establishment BefoVe Cecil left we were formally betrothedBut I knew that Cecil was not pleasing Uncle Harry that he was extravagant negligent of important businessaffairs and ugly stories of dissipationcame often to grieve us Mr Hay animmensely wealthy Louisiana planterwho was one of Uncle Harrys friendsand business correspondents had madeXecil warmly welcome in his familyand the letter that had so agitatedihim had been at once destroyed andno hint of its contents given to meBut long before this Willard hadcome home upon business and UncleHarry would not let him leave againHe was a great contrast to CecilCecil at 25 was the handsomest man1 ever saw with curling brown hairand large blue eyes a smiling mouthand perfect features He was sevenyears older than myself but ten yearsyounger thau WillardWHlard when be came from Pariswas a dark haired dark eyed man witha grave face settled halbits of punctuality a reserved manner a man whoinspired confidence and whom UncleHarry at nearty 76 j ears of age respected which was a high complimentI was glad Willard was away uponsome business of the estate as I watchedCecil pacingrup and down the gardenwalks restlessly beheading all my petflowers with his cane If they quarreled I thought with a shudderCecil looked murderousThen I cried again until Mrs Stonemy old governess who remained asmy companion came ia to comfort meThe dear old lady was very kind verygentle but she said little about Ceciland that little seemed to advise me tothink no more about him It bewildered me Of course I did not expecta wedding to follow a funeral at oncebut why was Cecil to be treated likeone in disgrace The new will mayhave given him Willards place andproperty He evidently thought soHe came in after an hour or two inwhich he had walked off the worst ofhis rage but there was a look in hiseyes that was worse than hot angerand he saidThat will must be foundThere was a thorough search madefor it Mrs Stone said coldlyYes by interested parties was thesneering reply The house is yoursMarian no Willards I ask your permission to look for the willI gave it and then escaped to my ownroom He would look for the will perhaps find it and Willard would lose hisinheritance And I was not glad Ahorrible weight oppressed me as Ithought of Cecil master in WellfordPlace master of the factory my husband vAt the last thought the scales fell atlast from my girlish eyes and I knewthat my love for Cecil was but the natural affection of a child for a life companion exalted to an ideal perfection bya youthful imagination And when theidol had fallen there rose in its place agrave face with large soft black eyesand I covered my own face to hide hotblushes for never had Willard spokenone word of love to Cecils betrothednever given me other than the gentlecourtesy due to his stepfathers nieoeand his short time wardHe was a king amongst men and Iknew it For years I had known ofUncle Harrys affection and trust in hisParis agent and since he had been athome I had not wondered at eitherThe factory hands fairly worshiped himfor he was strict in rule just in everydealing stern to rebuke fault and yetin trouble or illness he was generous asa prince and gentle as a womanAnd while I thought of all this I couldhear Cecil in the room so lately solemnized by the presence of death tossingabout the furniture rummaging everywhere to disinherit Willard I could notbear it At least he should know thedanger menacing himI slipped downstairs and over to thevillage nearly two miles away sendingfrom there a telegram to New Yorkonly a few words toWillard Dennison M Hotel NewYorkYou are needed at Wellford Place immediately MARIANThen I sped homeward already relieved At least he would come backand know of Cecils return It wasevening when we heard him in the hallI HAVE FOUND ITI had been reading and Cecil fingeringthe keys of the piano when Willardcame inHis face was very grave but he spokecordialty to Cecil who answered brieflyand insultingly almost accusing himof concealing the will For one secondthe dark eyes flashed angrily but beforehe spoke Willard wore his calm selfIjossessed face againYou are unjust Cecil he said allmy influence was exerted in your behalfIt looks so was the sneering replyYour uncle thought his lousinessshould be left in competent and experienced hands Have yours proved to besoNo I am not a bargaining tradesman Uncle Harry trained me for a gentlemanThe sneering emphasis brought adusky red for a moment on Willardsdark cheek He spoke with stern emphasisBe content then to leave the caresof trade to Yourme income and prospects will give you sufficient for idleeaseHis prospects I looked up then sopuzzled that Willard saidIs it possible you have not toldMarianYou have doubtless done soNo it was not my duty certainlynot nvy pleasureTold me what I cried with a dizzyfeeling and choking of my breathMrs Stone answeredYour uncles letter from Mr Hay announved Mr Cecil Wellfordsengagement to

butwould have fallen had not a strong armheld me up as I reeled forward Thesame kind support led me to the libraryand placed me in a deep armchair Imust have been white and looked faintfor a moment later a glass of wine washeld to my lips and Willard said verytenderlyTBJR BOURBON UttfDrink this Marian My poor ctry to think he is not worthy of yowrregret -That nerved me I drank the wineand said I am not grieving x I amglad glad jAndthenlbroke into hysterical weepfHng I was but a girl and had beentried hardly m the last few weeks Ihad thought all my tears spent butthey flowed freely as I buried my facein the cushion of the chair and sobbedA gentle hand stroked my curls andafter I was quieter I heard Willardleave the libraryCecil had gone to his own room andMrs Stone was alone when at lastreturned to the drawing room Sheunderstood me I think for when shekissed me she saidI wanted to tell you before but youruncle forbade itWas he pleased I askedI cannot tell you Mr Hay is an oldfriend and his only child will doubtless inherit large wealth but your unclenever spoke of the matter to me beyond giving me the letter to read anddestroy and telling me to keep the matter from you till we heard from CecilBut the willOf that I know nothingWe were a constrained party at breakfast but when the meal was over Cecilannounced his determination to searchin Uncle Harrys room until the willwas found Very gravely Willard advised him to let the matter rest but wasanswered by such taunts as no mancould bear patientlyHave your will he said We willall search aainBut after all the search fell upon Ceciland Mrs Stone I would not stir afinger and Willard stood beside mewhile the others turned over every paper and rummaged every corner AsCecil opened a Japan cabinet full of rarecoins twid stones I saw Willard turnpale and a moment later Cecil criedI have found itHe opened it hastily It was veryshort and as he read all the blood deserted his face and he gasped for breathIt was long before he spoke Then hesaidYou have seen thisI have said Willard gravelyYou hid itNo I suspected its whereaboutsbut did not knowAnd you would have let it lie thereI will destroy it now if you consentLet the matter lie between us twoHe glanced nervously at me ButCecil said Marian must sec it andgave me the paperThen I knew that my uncle had revoked hie old legacy to Cecil and lefthim five dollars while my inheritancewas left intact upon condition that Imarried WillardThe paper fell from my hands and Icovered my face Willards voice brokean oppressive silenceThis paper concerns us only

before Do not grieveMarian It breaks my heart to see youunhappyI lifted my face then My secretmust have been in my ejes for I wascaught in a strong clasp and a tenderkiss fell on my lips as Willard

INDIAIntense Aversion of the Natives to Removal of HoMpitalsThere was a Blue Book issued theother day containing the official storyof the bubonic plague in India down toMay This of course does not includethe period of the outrages in Poona andthe riots in Calcutta but there is muchinthe dispatches that helps us to understand the native panic As tothe sanitary precautions enforced theBombay government resisted for sometime the attempt of the Indian government urged by the home governmentto impose too drastic regulations uponthe people Tiis was the opinion of theBombay administrationFrom the beginning of the outbreakof this disease it has been found thatthe native inhabitants of the city arevery reluctant to leave their houses or toallow any member of their family afflicted with the disease to be takenaway Indeed their dread of the disease itself appears to be hardly so powerful as their horror of being removedfrom their housesIgnorance and superstition prevent them from discerning either that removal to a hospital isgood for the sick or removal to infecteddwellings good for the healthy andthey are far more easily moved by fearof the municipal and police authoritiesthan by any realization of the benefitsthat will accrue from a sensible courseof action It is estimated that not lessthan 300000 persons have already fledfrom Bombay moved so to do not onlyby fear of the plaugue but quite asmuch if not more by an unfoundedand unreasonable fear of what mighthappen to them at the hands of the police and municipal authorities werethey to remainThe exodus has already necessitatedprecautionary measures against arrivals from Bombay in every part of thepresidency it has led to the plague becoming epidemic in Poona- and in partsof the Tharaa district it has resulted inovercrowding by refugees from Bombayof many cities and towns and it hasmade demands on the number of qualified medical practitioners available tothe government that can with difficultybe met Every addition to the numberof refugees adds to the possibility ofspreading the disease and to the difficulty of dealing with it should it breakoutThe measures taken may not havebeen so stringent as those that wouldin a European city have gained generalsupport but they are the most stringent that it was possible to undertakewithout almost certainly producing acalamity more serious and more widespread than the very terrible one thathas now to be dealt withThe Indian government howeverwere impressed by the necessity of decisive action and repliedThe government ofSndia havingcarefully considered your telegram 292P dated 13th and letter 263 P dated12th regarding the evacuation ofplague infected houses regret thatwhile giving full weight to iMie opinionsof the local government in regard tojfthe disposition of the people they arejunable to accept the view that the considerations adduced in your letter showthat it is impracticable to induce people to move from infected houses to ahealthy locality This course has beenstrongly recommended by the medicaladviser of the government of India Itis only the measure attacking the rootof evil which appears practicable

the literary life of the day when anywriter who has done anything to attract attention lives so much in the public eye Jean Ingelows career wasquiet and gentle in its course Thegreater part of her work however wasdone at a period previous to that inwhich the public interest in celebritieswas as fully gratified as it is to dayFor nearly a quarter of a century shehad been neglected by the world inspite of the great popularity that herearlier writings had won But it iscertainly notable that a writer who wasesteemed the most popular woman poetof her day whose books in her countryran through 23 editions and in theUnited States were sold to the numberof 200000 should never have been interviewed But this was one of Miss Ingelows distinctionsProbably this resulted from the horror of publicity which had always prevented her from appearing in gatherings of notable persons It is said thatshe would not even accept invitationsto dinners at which the company waslikely to be made up too much of wellknown persons There was one seriesof entertainments in which she indulged herself for many years Threetimes a week she invited to dinner ather house the poor people lately dischargedf rom the hospitals in the neighborhood and it is said that in her ownview of the world the dinner table was aplace much more adapted to such practical charity than to poetry Her acquaintance was not limited howeverrto persons so distant from her ownsphere Many eminent literary menof the time were among her intimatefriends Buskin was one of theseand he is said to have taken particularpleasure in her society Lord Tennysonwas another and her personal set hadincluded Dante Gabriel Bosetti JameaRussell Lowell Oliver Wendell Holmesand many others of almost equal fameMiss Ingelow was born in a smalltown in Lincolnshire where her fatherwas a banker and although she hadlived for many years previous to herdeath in Kensington it is said that hershy modest manners never lost thequality that her early life in the country had given them She was nevera beauty although her face was wonderfully attractive in its sweetness andvariability of expression to the personswho knew her Although as a child offive she had shown a wonderful sensitiveness to rhythm her first poemswere not published until she was 43years old The book was publishedanonymously at her own expenseWhen the small edition was exhaustedher publisher advised her that it wouldnot be wise to attempt the experimentof another issue But the great popularity that her work suddenly achievedproved the fallacy of that counsel Shebecame suddenly famous and it wasnot long before all the eminent writersof the clay had made her acquaintanceShe and her mother had moved to Kensington and this sudden extension oiher acquaintance was not without itsembarrassment to a woman whose previous life had been so quietShe had not read a great deal beforeshe began her career as a poet and sheattributed much of the freshness of herverse to this circumstance The success of her first volume was never repeated The public would never be attracted to her succeeding works as ithad been to the verses that made theirappearance so modestly in 1S63 Formany years before her death she hadknown nothing of the delights that thegolden years of her fame years limitedto little more than a decade hadbrought so unexpectedly to her Butit is said that her gentle optimisticnature never showed any resentmentat the indifference of the public Shewas eminently hopeful contented anddetermined to take the sunniest view oflife Her natural disposition luckilymade this attitude the easiest for herSo she was never heard to complain ofthe fickleness of the public taste whichfor many years had left her quite outof its thoughts N Y SunPine Barlv

AlTvays Spoils the Shape ata Growing AnimalWe talk about the loss of the horsebusiness from one cause or anotherbut the most mischief comes from thewant of proper food says an exchangeThis means loss to the horse andgreater loss to the farmer A good percent of the horses seen on the streetsof any town show insufficient or unbalanced food supply Horses thathave been ill fed when young are almost invariably small long leggedlight carcassed and narrow chestedSome of them have a great deal ofenergy but all are soon exhausted unfit for prGtracted exertion Grown uphorses when much reduced by deficient nourishment require more foodto put them into working order thanwould have kept them for two or threemonths in the condition they requireto possess when going into workWhen a horse is starved besides losingstrength and flesh his bowels get fullof worms and his skin covered withlice Very often he takes mange andsometimes he does not moult or thehair falls out suddenly and

of wavinglines made where the wood gasped inthe excruciating heat of the desert sinkwe know as Death valley is one of thelatest additions to the Park museumThe stock was picked up by J W Droallard where a train of emigrants perished 47 years ago and was presentedto the museum by Jefferson G Jamesof this city The carved old stockwhite as a skeleton tells a good storyIt was found where a large emigrantparty perished in 1850 and where fovmany years the tracks of the wagonwheels and tlie marks of the fires couldstill be seen so deathly is natures stillness in this remarkable regionIt was from the fate of this verjparty to which the old gunstock belonged that the region was namedThey had the honor of christening thiplace but like many pioneers theypaid dearly for the privilege It was aparty of 30 gold seekers with theirwives and children who came into thevalley from the east all unmindful olthe deadly grasp of the country intowhich thev had so blithely venturedAfter a one days camp they were soovercome by the heat and still moreterrible aridity that more than halttheir number perished A few escapedover the Panamint mountains to thewest and the others returned the waythey came It was a pitiful experienceTen years later a party of prospectorscame across the camp with its wagonschains yokes camp equipments gunsand childrens toys to say nothing ofthe melancholy skeletons of men women and children and their faithfulhorses Even the tracks made in thesand by the little ones could still betraced Of all the stories told of California pioneers none is so full of human interest as this and yet it is toldonly by tradition though survivors oithe party still remainThen there was the gunsight leadOne of the survivors of the party carrieda piece of rock probably black metalfrom a spring he found in the Panamints to the settlements A gunsmithwhen asked to make a gunsight of itfound it to be silver Why should thestory be considered incredible The leadhas been covered by the debris of acloudburst It may never be foundbut there seems no good reason to doubtits existenceThere are hundreds of unknowngraves in the region Some are markedby lonely crosses others not at all Howmany men have wandered from thetrail and have never been found no oneknows At the lower end of the valley travelers used to pass six skeletonsin one day and near them were deepholes dug beneath the greasewoodbushes where men gone mad withthirst had dug their fingers to the bonein the search for water It is a terribleTegion this country below the seawhere only the dust storms come wherethe stillness is everlasting and whereit never rains Mens bodies dry thereas fruit dries under the process of evaporation and woe betide the prospectorwho loses his way or does not knowthe location of the

loadof coarse gravel and a sufficient quantity of rich sandy loamThe gravel was placed in the bottomof the barrel to a depth of six or eightinches- Over this was sprinkled a thinlayer of well rotted fertilizer and uponthis was placed five inches of the sandyloam This process was repeated untilthe barrel was filledMeantime as ieach layer tof soil wasbuilt up the roots of a choice andthrifty strawberry plant were insertedinto every auger hole aid carefully imbedded in the loam The top of thebarrel was also set with as many plantsas the space allowed and the perpendicular strawberry patch on wheelswas finished Now he finds his chiefsatisfaction in the fact that the berrieswhich dangle from his barrel are of thefinest possible qualityAccording to his experience the vinesin his barrel are not only more thriftyand prolific than any he has seen growing in an ordinary patch but the freedom of the fruit from sand and dirt is amost enjoyable advantage There isno weeding or other
