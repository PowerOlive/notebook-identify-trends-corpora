Bradley announces' as acandidate fgr Commonwealth's Attorney for this, the 14th Judicial District,composed of the counties of Scott.Franklin, Bourbon and Woodford, tafill out the unexpired term caused bythe resignation of Robert B. Franklin,subject to the action of the Dernocraticprimary. August 2.Respect the Law.For a change, the same kind of justice that is meted outto the poor men,was meted out to thejrich when Federal Judge Hollister, of Ohio, recentlysentenced twenty-nine official of theCash Register trust to sentences injail, sustaining the view long taken byDemocrats thatx "guilt is personal, "and making the first official responseto the will of the people that was expressed in the election of WoodrowWilson.Nqw that sufficient Mme has elapsedfor members of Congress to considerthe effect of the judgment of the Ohiocour the concensus of opinion amonglawmakers at the national capitol isthat the jail sentences will do morejjtocause millionaire trust magnates torespect the Sherman anti-trust lawthan anything that has occurred sincetrusts'and monopolies have come intoexistence.It has been demonstrated that jailsentences is the only thing trust magnates have any respect for. They arewilling to build up giant monopolies inthe necessaries of life if their onlypuniHhment, in the remote event oftheir prosecution and conviction, is tobe "dissolution," the details of whichthe Suoreme Court will allow their attorneys to attend to the end that theirstocks will double in value. Trust magnates care nothing about fines. Finesj aie considered simply on a businessbasis. The trust heads have no objection to occasionally paying la 55.000 or$10,000 fine, having made millions incornered markets and in monopolies ofthe necessaries of lifa.But trust magnates are afraid of acell, and if they can be convinced thatif they violate the anti-trust law tbeywill go to jail, like the poor go to jailwhen they violate a law, no one doubtsbut that the Sherman law would beobeyed and the problem of illegaltrusts solvpd.The Sherman law provides for jailsentences for trust magnates, just asother laws provide for jail sentencesfor other kinds of robbery, but fortwenty years and more the Federalcourts have not been impressed by thefact. That is why so many personshave come to be suspicious of thecourts, and to sincerely believe thattbe poor def not recpive the same kindof justice that is meted out to therich; it explains, too, the recent remRrkable growth of socialism, and theagitation for the recall of judges.In this connection it is important tonote that although the twenty-ninecash register hpaa are found guiltyand were sentenced to jail, they arenot in jail, and are not likely to befor two years, or perhaps even longer The case will be fought throughthe Supreme Court, and as a generalrule two years is consumed. It is'said that the men under sentence expect to escape jail, and will pour outtheir millions in an effort to find someloophole of technicality by which toescape the ignominy of being brandeda convict.If the judgment of tha court i3 actually carried out, it is obvious that itwill do snore toward causing illegaltrust magnates to respect the law, andat the same time more to strengthenthe wamng'confidence ofthe masses inthe federal courts than anything thathas happened in years.Why Congress Should ActThere is no reason why Congressshould delay action for a new currencyand banking law beyond the specialsession to be called this spring. Congress is in possession of complete information as to the operations of thebanking systems in this and all othercountries. Aside from numerous disastrous occurrences, terminating inthe panic of1907. with their eloquentinformation, the lawmakers have before them the 23 volumes of the report of the National Monetary Commission-This report is the most exhaustive compendium of informationas to American ard foreign bankingsystems and methods ever roniDiled.In addition, the House subcommitteeof the Banking and Currency Committee has been making special study ofthe question since last spring and hasbeen hearing the views of bankersand business men for several weeks.The general question of banking andcurrency reform has been under constant investigation and study since1907. Knowledge knows no party.Information is information whetherDemocrat or Republican uncovers it.If Congress cannot act at thu specialsession, because it requires furthertime to investigate, Congress might aswell postpone action indefinitely forthe same reason.Wise.Friend "The public will miss younow you have left the stage."

"She always beats me atanything of that sort. The last timeI was shown up as a false alarm inapplying logic to every day affairswas no longer ago than yesterday."When I got home from the city lastevening my wife said to me: 'Therewas a man here today to see aboutfixing the flower beds and the gardenfor the" winter. He looked so shabbyand sort of homeless that I gave himyour other light overcoat.'" 'That ought to be a good start toward getting him a home,' I said inmirth provoking way. 'It was a thoughtful move on your part. I suppose youfigured that some lonely widow alongthe road would fall in love with himwhen she saw the graceful lines ofthat coat enfolding him and wouldrush out to haul him in.'"'Don't try to be funny,' said mywife.'"What really interest me morethan his immediate future,' I said, 'isthe object of his call. Did he waitlong enough to specify what was thematter with our flower beds that needed fixing?'"My wife favored me with the stareof disdain -which she considers especially cutting and effective against mykind of sarcasm." 'Why, I suppose he wants to fixthem up for the winter,' she said. 'I'mnot an expert on such matters, but Ihave an idea that some sort of attention must be paid to them before zeroweather comes. I told the man tocome back this evening and see you.""There being no adequate reply tothis under the matrimonial code, I allowed the subject to drop and awaitedmy visitor. He came with the shadows, adorned with my overcoat." 'I was wonderin,' he said, 'if youwanted your flower beds and your garden fixed up for the winter.' Then heleaned restfully against the porchpillar." 'What's the idea?' I asked. 'Won'tthey be there next spring if I leavethem alone all winter?'"'Yes, but you don't understand,'the tired citizen explained. 'Theyought to be bedded down with fertilizer spaded up and covered over,the way they fix 'em in the parks.'" 'And then what?' I demanded. Thelight of my household was listeningfrom the darkness of the hall and Iwanted her to see the uselessness ofthe appointment she had made for me." 'Then your flowers and vegetableswill have a big start next spring,' thehorticulturist explained, 'because theground will be ready for 'em. I dothis every year for most of the people in this town. I charge a dollar forImy time and you pay for the fertilizerand stuff.'" 'See here, you imitation gardner,' Imarked after I had glared at him amoment, 'you're the worst booster foryourself that ever came down thatroad out there. Your efforts to geta dollar out of me are so feeble andamateurish that I'd have a laugh all tomyself if I wasn't getting sort of tiredof your kind of cattle."'You've got a lot of nerve to saythat you bed down the vegetable gardens of most of the people in thistown every year, so they'll be ready todo business with a rush in the springtime,' I told him. 'Why, there isn'tanother suburb on this branch of the Jrailroad that turns out such a worthless lot of garden truck as this one.'" 'Now I know what's the matterit's all your fault. If you'd keep yourhands off the gardens and let thingsalone people might have a chance toraise a few spring onions at a cost ofnot more than $6 a dozen, and wemight even get an occasional radishthat wasn't a soggy sponge. Not content with getting my fall overcoat bymerely standing around and lookingfrostbitten, you expect me to give youa dollar for taking exercise that wouldkeep you warm while you are spoilingmy garden!'"My caller shifted his weight to theother foot and looked uncomfortablefor a few seconds, but he was readywith his defense.'"Well,' he said, 'a man's got tolive.'"'There!' my wife exclaimed triumprantly from the darkness behindme. 'That's the point you always overlook!' ' "So this morning that depressedperson was busy in our garden withspade and wheelbarrow when I lefthome. Lovely woman may not bestrong on the finer points of logic,but she certainly has the gift of winning in any argument." ChicagoDaily News.Swiss Would Tax Cats.Switzerland is the land of politicaland social experiments, and we usually legislate with one eye on that littlecountry of federation, democracy, referenda, prohibition, compulsory service and liberty. And now Switzerlandor, at least," that portion of it aboutLucerne proposes to put a tax oncats. We shall watch that experimentwith interest, for the tax will not produce much revenue, but it will spelllet us not shrink from the word protection against the enemies of birdsand 'sleep. Bach cat shall wear a collar with its registered number; thecat without a number will be arrestedand destroyed. Wherefore the peoplethat like cats will keep them indoorsor pay for their outdoor amusements.Other people's cats are always a nuisance, and the collar and the tax willplace a certain responsibility on thecat, and what is more important onits owner.

The shipment was made fromLexington to Juarez. Mexico, and thesuit for the recovery of the damageswas brought in Lexineton and thejudgment of the Fayette Circuit Courtwas affirmed Friday.The question for the first lime wasraised in this case in the AppellateCourt by the railroad company thatthe rule in this state that the limitedvaluation clause in contracts of shipments are not enforceable against asnipper in the absence of fraud is aviolation of Section 20 of the Carmack amendment , to the interstatecommerce law. In a supplementalbrief, filed last rnonth by the railroadit was claimedfor the first time thatunder the anVndment the duty to issue a bill of lading and the liabilitythereby assumed was fully coveredby the Federal act and supeisedes allstate legislation and decisions on thatsubject, as was lately decided in thecase of the Adams Express Companyagainst Croninger, January 6, 1913,226 CJ. S. Page 411. The KentuckyCourt holds, however, that the decision in this case, will not affect thisdamage case, as the rule in Kentuckyis that a contract of a common carrierto relieve itself from common law liability by arbitrarily fixing the valueof property carried is a violation ofSection 196 of the constitution and is'void, except where fraud is practicedon the carrier.As this decision vitally affects shippers of all kinds of live stock, it is ofimportance to them to know the rulein Kentucky and the question of lawwith which they will have to contendwith in the future.Rugs.Beautiful 9x12 Axminster rug3 forJanuary Clearance sale $16.75.

The first matter taken up was theDroposed change m the dates fromSeptember to the latter part of Julv,but after considerable discussion itwas decided the fair should retain thedates it has held for more than half acentury.Many plans were argued which wouldadd to the success of the coming exhibition and were discussed by the directors. It was agreed that amusementfeatures, which last year all but proved the unduing of the fair because oftheir absence, would havea greatereffect in increasing .tlie attendance,and while the timois yet early theamusement comjmttee, composed ofGeorge Rasseifoss, George Stuart, S.G. Clay, W. G. Talbott and John Wiggins, will soon begin looking over thefield for a large line of attractions.It was practically decided that thereshould be a floral hall erected before jthe date for holding the fair this yearand it is probable that work will beginupon the structure in the spring to insure its completion at an early date.The management of the societygives every evidence of their intentionto make the fair this year, a grand success and are taking steps in that direction even at this early date.$18.75 lor $25 OvercoatsWe will deliver one at your door freeby parcel post.

Althea Simpson inquired casually, as they stoodat the back door of the Simpson flat.Young Dewberry was cracking iceon the stone doorstep by way of helping Althea make lemonade for therest of the callers in the living room.He had attained this privilege bysheer force, inasmuch as three otheryoung men had sprung to their feetwhen Althea had murmured something about making the lemonade.Young Dewberry had simply hewn apath through their ranks as he headed for the icebox and a bit of solitude with Althea."Is that so?" he remarked in response to her remark about the thirty-sixfiats. He looked down into thehuge curved court, which nearly bisected the long building. It was acanyon with walls showing spiderystaircases and narrow little porchesand it ended in a cement well at theground, with an exit through the basement to the street."Oh!" Althea cried at that moment. For something lithe and grayleaped over young Dewberry to theporch and vanished. "There goes mycat! .1 never allow him out at night!Catch 'him, quick!"Dropping the ice, young Derberrymade a leap after the cat. It glideddown the narrow staircases like aghost. Breathless, its pursuer reachedthe bottom and chased the elusivefeline around the cement court. Atlast he grabbed its tail and hung on.The cat, scratching furiously, wasgathered to his manly chest and furtively choked."Now I've got you!" young Dewberry muttered viciously. "Consarnyou! Why should she waste affectionon-you?"He looked up at the canyon walland was impressed by its unvariedmonotony. Then, seeing a staircasenear, he started up. Mechanicallyafter a while he stopped.. All theback doors on that-floor were closed.All loked alike. It suddenly dawnedon young Dewberry that he was confronted by thirty-six back doors andthat his chance of finding the rightone was rather slim.Peering over the rail, he counted upfrom the ground and found that hewas on the third floor. He beganconsidering doors. Most of them hadnames on them and none of thenames was Simpson. He had notrealized before how very many othernames there were in the world. Finally he came to a nameless door andtook a sight out over the court. Thismust be the one, for the angle wassimilar to that he had seen whenAlthea had called his attention to thesize of the court. He tapped gently.The door flew open with disquieting suddenness and a fist was shaken under young Dewberry's nose."You clear out!" said the voice thatwent with the fist. "I've been waitingfor you and let me tell you, if youcome around again bothering my cookI'll have the law on you! A loafing,drunken husband and she a hardworking wo " Then the door wasslammed in young Dewberry's face.Walking "very rapidly and verystraight, young Dewberry headed forthe end of that row of porches. Hewas lost and must go at it sensibly.Selecting a door, he knocked. Aftera while he found the bell and rang.Presently it opened' and a womanpeered out over the chain."Excuse me, madam," Dewberry began in his politest tones. "I have ""Good gracious!" the woman cried."An agent at this time of night!" It'sperfectly disgraceful disturbing people who don't want to buy anything."She slammed the door shut and rattled the chain pointedly.Young Dewberry leaned against apost and gazed at the cold, twinklingstars. He and the cat were verymuch alone. It occurred to him thatall this trouble could have beenaverted had Althea remained on herback porch and watched his progress.He began to feel bitter toward Althea. Suddenly he realized that he wasnot on the third floor, but the secondhe had counted the back stairs upfrom the cement basement where hehad caught the cat!Hastily ascending another flight, herenewed his scrutiny of doors. Thename of Simpson was not on any ofthem. So, still clutching the disgusted cat, he went downstairs oncemore and ascended the flights on theopposite side of the canyon.Presently he paused before a door.There were bits of ice on the doortep! Thus encouraged, Dewberryturned the knob and entered."Why, where on earth have youbeen?" asked Althea in some confusion. She was at the icebox andyoung Spriggs, who was with her,moved aside quickly. "You've beengone ages! They've drunk up all thelemonade and eaten everything! Idon't think it was nice of you!""Oh," said young Dewberry, grimly, "kitty and I have been taking alittle stroll in the rose garden andsitting by the fountain! I don't mindyour haste with the lemonade. Butyou'd better brush the powder offSpriggs' shoulder!""I think you are perfectly horrid!"said Althea. "It's your own faultthat you missed the lemonade. Allyou had to do was go down stairsand come up again.""Well, I did it," returned youngDewberry.Their Method. f"How do needle-guns work?" 3"J ist sew-sew."' . ----KENTUCKY, FEBRUARYHonor Roll Paris City Schools.Monthly report of Paris PublicSchools fdr month beginning Jan. 20and ending Feb. 14, 1913.To the Board of Education, Paris,Kentucky:Gentlemen: We are glad to be ableto report the schools in a flourishingcondition.

Nevertheless it must be admitted that ingeneral the "swat the fly slogan failedto do all that it was expected to do.This j ear it ia proposed to changethe slogan and also to change the character of the work. Instead of "twatthe fly" it is to be 'starve the fly', according to the program of the FlyFighting Uommittee of the AmericanCivic Association. That organ zationurgesjthe public to employ the weaponof cleanliness, far more effective thanthe best fly swatter ever put on themarket, and to emplov it "as the beginning, the middle and the end of theflv fighting campaign."Undoubtedly his appeal for greatercleanliness in streets, yards, houses,stables and barns will fall upon manydeaf ears. The careless and negligentform a considerable portion of everycommunity. But tnere should beenough of the other kind of citizens,the kind willing to make some effortfor their own protection, to achievegratifying results.The time tu fight the fly by cleaningup is almost at hand. If the early arrival finds no filth upon which to livehe will not be able to live at all andv.'ill never enjoy the distinction of being he ancestor of a vast progeny ofdisease carriers. "Starve the fly"and don't lose any time in beginningthj good work.Passengers Entitled to ProtectionGeorge F. Hardy, of Covington, willrecover from Ihe South Covington andCincinnati Street Railway Company52,200 for damages he received forpersonal injuries by being thrownirorn a car. Hardy boarded the car inCincinnati, but the car.was so crowdedthat he was compelled to stand on thesteps and was thrown from the car bya suaden jerk after it had reachedCovington.The company defended the actionbrought against it bv Hardy on tnegrounds that Hardy should not haveboarded the carwhen he found that itwas so crowded that he could not get aseat and claimed that the injury wasdue to contributory neglieence.In deciding the case the AppellateCourt does not take that view of thelaw, and gives a rule to govern thehandling of passengers in crowded vehicles. The court says that whpn thecompany accepts a passenger on a carand he is-compelled to ride on the stepbecause he cannot, without pushingand crowding the other passengers getstanding room on the platform or elsewhere, he is entitled to the same protection as if he were seated in the car,and the company is charged with thesame duty of taking notice of the danger, if any, that attends his position,and must exercise corresponding careto protect him from accident.Electricity Healthful.Auto factories are said to be healthful places for workmen because ofelectricity employed.Burglar Helps Child With Croup.An interesting burglar story is toldin a press dispatch from Los Angelesas follows:A burglar who went to rob Mrs.Fred Morris remained to save her baby's life.

Thenhe rubbed olive oil upon the child'schest and worked for an hour beforehe told the mother that it was out ofdanger. "You must have a babvyourself," remarked Mrs. Morris.

And shealways keepB her word.If the girl who intends to be a 1913bride would drill around and look at8ome of tne 1911 models, maybe shewouldn't be so enthusiasticBig Lead For ExGovernor Beckham.Under the above headline the Louisville Evening Post, of Feb. 12, printsthe following:"Stanford, Ky., Feb. 12-The Interior Journal, which is leading the fightfor the nomination of ex-Gov. Beckhamfor United States Senator in this section of Kentucky, in its issue 6f Tues-"day reviews conditions in Lincoln county and adjoining counties where it hasa large circulation, and finds after acareful and impartial canvass thatBeckham will sweep these counties mthe primary and carry them by an overwhelming majority over any and allcandidates. The Interior Journal saysin its last issue:"How completely Lincoln and, infact, 'all this end of Kentucky, are forex-Gov. Beckham for United StatesSenator in the primary; next August,was made plain to anyone who talkedpolitics to the several thousand farmers who came lo attend February courtday sales here Monday. A representative of the Interior Journal talked toleading Democrats from all over Lincoln county and Democratic leaders ofother counties. If what they say isso, and each one talked to seemed tobe entirely familiar with conditions andthe sentiment in his community, Gov.Beckham will carry all of the countiesin this section of the State by an overwhelming majority over any and allcandidates who may oppose him."Democrats who have always beenfor him are for him more enthusiastically than ever before, while thousandswho have never supported him beforeare his ardent admirers now. Theyhave watched his course since goingout of office; they respect the gamenesswith whifh he took his medicine whenbetrayed; they appreciate the fact thatnotwithstanding it all, he has goneabout his private business, living aclean life, not meddling in affiairs whichdid not concern him, and ever willingto do what he could as a private in theranks towards the success of the party.They remember the vigorous campaignhe waged on the stump for the election of McCreary and the DemocraticState ticket, and how above it all, hehas consistently stood out bold and unafraid for what he believes to be right,regardless of all considerations, andeven when it cost him a seat in theUnited State Senate.""Over in Rockcastle oounty Beckhamwill not lose fifty votes in the entirecounty, was the report brought hereMonday by J. M. Craig, a prominentcattle and stoc dealer, who travels allover the county and is in a good position to know the sentiment of hispeople."Down in Casey, J.C.Coulter.of Middleburg, says he has found but oneman in the entire county against Beckham, and that he will be for him without doubt before the day ot the primary. "Maurice J. Farris, Jr., one of the biggest stock men of Boyle, who travelsall over it. and knows almost everjfarmer in the county, reports thatBoyle is practically unanimous forBeckham.J.R. Mount and other leading Democrats of ijarrard, say the same condition prevails in that county."Never in an y race before theDemoCiats of the State have the people ofthis part of the State been so emphatically united behind the candidacy ofany candidate as they are for Gov.Beckham for United States Senator."Phases of Scandal.It will ever remain a mystery 'whyso many men and women like to talkabout themselves when there are somany persons willing to undertakethe task and do it better .Was Even More Upset."I can't understand how you havethe presumption to think I wouldpermit my daughter to become yourwife."

Light cars of popular priceand moderate appetite can be just asgraceful in outline, just as carefullybuilt, and just as comfortable, jas theinfinitely larger and heavier annihilators ot SDace, gasoline and .tires.In cases where smartness of handling and limited turning space are ata premium, the Jight" cars enjoy agreat advantage. In the hands of askilled pilot it darts in and out oftraffic as a torpedo boat maneuversthrougn a fleet of battleshins.More highly standardized than itscorpulent brother and with fewernecessary adjustments the light caris less prone to .become crippled andeasier to repair when accident hanpens. Women find it easier to drivelight cars. A woman at the wheel ofa road locomotive is an unusual sightsdriving a light car the woman pilot isso often met as to aiouse no especialcomment.Suiting the car to the buyer's personal need is an art which permits ahia'a degree of discrimination.The Duciiesse de Talleyrand, betterknown to the American nublic as theone time Anna Gould, present in America in attendance on the wedding ofher sister, Helen Gould, to Finlev J.Shepard. went shopping for an automohiie for her personal use. TheDuchesse is an accomplished motoristand had a definite idea of the qualitiesshe wanted in a car. She spentnearly an hour in the salesroom of theNew York Studebaker branch andthoroughly inspected the mechanismof a Studebaker "25" enclosed roadster, which she finally nurchased, andis now driving.The Duchesse was especially struckwith the cozy protection afforded bythe side curuins. which, in this typeof car, swing with the doors, givingthe weathei proof advantages of acoupe with the option of changing thecar, at any time," into an open roadsterof conventional lines. That such acombination should be exclusively theproperty of an American builder oflight, popular priced cars appealed tothe Duchesse as novel and entertaining. She has laken the car back to herhome .' in France, with the idea ofusing it in her personaL trina throughher great estate.THEATRICAL."SMART SET."It is said Jovers of good music shouldnot fail to see "The Smart Set" Company in "The Darktown Politician,"which is to be at the Pans grand forone night, Mcndav, March 3.
