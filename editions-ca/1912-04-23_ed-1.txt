Many slashes weremade into government extragavancebut in no case was a cut made withoutthe most careful study. The effort tosave money 'for Uncle Sam was athoroughly honest one.The economy program of the Democrats, however, is being foughtatevery turn by &the Senate Standpat-'wwvIIIIIof5?IJJTW TXt iters, who have promptly placed backinto the appropriation bills either allor b part of the amounts trimmed outof them when they were passed in thehouse. The democrats proposed toput a stop to practices, long prevalent,of upending government for no otherpurposes than to allow certain Senators to keep themselves in Congress,and to cut out necessary expense allalong the line. The saving, if" theDemocratic bills should go through asthey passed the House, would be tremendous. The Senate Old Guard,however, looks upon the right to dipinto the treasury at will as a Godgiven perogative, and the appropriation dills were promptly restored totheir former size just as soon as theSenate committees, dominated by theS tand patters, got a hold of them.The Democratic leaders have announced, however, that they will insist on some to the cuts, and they willadoptdraatic ; measuresto enforcetheir position unless theSenaterecedes.ThejOld Guard Senators wanta bigexpense bill, so they will be able topoint to it, as justification for a hightariff.Blocked byStandpatters.The Democrats of the 'House goright on being progressive.

Mr. Rice, the Marconiexpert, who came to Ceylon recentlyto superintend the erection of thenew wireless station, says the site isexcellent, although a long way out,apd that the station, when completed,will be one of the most up to datein the east. The apparatus is of thebest, and includes the latest inventions. The station will have a guaranteed range over water of 450 miles.At night, he thinks, under favorableconditions, this distance will be exceeded considerably, and he puts arange of 1,000 miles as not outsidethe realms of possibility. He considers t that both Bombay and Calcuttamay occasionally be reached, and thatships in Madras harbor should be communicated with without 'difficulty.The work of erecting the masts isprogressing very satisfactorily. Barring untoward events, the job shouldbe finished in about four months. Twosteel masts will be put up, both 270feet in height, these being two of thehighest erected by the Marconi company. They will be built in sectionsof ten feet, and as some forty ,feet isup already, it is anticipated that theerection of each will take about amonth. . "When 03oth masts are up thebuilding should be ready for the installation of the apparatus, which workwill then be undertaken.The first message should be sent offin about four months' time. The firstattempt, Mr. Rice says, will probablybe to communicate with a warship inMadras harbor, if one happens to bethere at the time.K1SEXT0WS STRIKE FOR WAGESHardWork to Dig Graves,"Skilled" Diggers toTrustees.SayEggFoSale.hePure Rhode Island Red Eggs.strain that lays the year round.CHARLTON CLAY,5 6t E.

The strike epidemic whichfor the last eighteen months has beena daily menace to the welfare ofGreat Britain has now invaded thecemetery.Grave diggers at the Western Necropolis, Lambhill and St. Kentigern'sburying grounds, Glasgow, have struckwork altogether, and are now picketing the approaches to the cemeteryThey demand decreased hoursof work, an increase of three shillingsa week in wages and six days annualholiday. 'The whole thing is a farce,"said an official. "Grave diggers," hesaid, "work nine hours in summerand seven and a half in winter. Certain men are required to work on Saturday afternoon and on Sundays, butfor this they receive four shillingseach, whether for opening or filling ingraves."The official said the men's wagesaveraged thirty shillings, which wasexcellent for unskilled labor, to saynothing of tips. There has been nodifficulty in filling the places of thestrikers, said the official, and workwas proceeding as usual. No funeralswould require postponement. Thestrikers claim to be skilled laborersand allege that "black leg" grave diggers are making a "sad 'mess ofthings."They also insist that their workshould be done with decorum, as thefeelings of mourners should not beharrowed by bungling at the graveside, which they say is sure to happenif the duty of filling a grave is doneby unskilled laborers.SCHOOL HEAD GREAT WALKEREEProfessional CardsJJ.

Nerve "was what kept thisphenomenal rascal skating gracefullyover the thinnest kind of ice. And hisnerve has not deserted him, now thatthe ice has broken under him and hehas sunk overhead in the muddy waters of trouble.Behind his prison bars he seems, indeed like most clever criminals totake a sort of professional pride in hisachievements. "When he realized thatdenial was henceforth futile he shrugged his shoulders and said:"I congratulate the Roman police. Ihave traveled all over the world andgot away with many hundreds ofthousands of lire."However, that which I stole I stolefrom the rich. I never trimmed anyone for less than 100,000 lire ($20,000).What a pity that the law must punishme! 1 have helped an infinite numberof poor priests. Today I had an appointment with another prelate; instead, I am in jail. What a pity!"This unique scoundrel is a sort ofcombination of Tartuffe and BarryLyndon. He posed as a priest andwore priestly garb, but he was not content with that, for he wore purple athis throat and a purple girdle, whichindicated that he was a monsignor ofthe church.The bearer of these noble names andecclesiastical titles had no right toany of them. He never was a priest.He had no right to wear even a cassock, much less the purple of a prelate. He is just plain Giovanni Battista Gindri, son of a respectable Turinhotelkeeper. He'J obtained his familiarity with church affairs while receivinghis education in an ecclesiastical seminary. His father probably hoped thathe would become a priest. But theyouth found his vocation along verydifferent lines.It would be impossible and uselessto make a list of those he has swindled. It is believed he has got avaywith several millions of francs in all.The greater number of his victimshave made no formal complaint againsthim, preferring to pocket their lossesrather than to suffer the chaffing oftheir friends because of their gullibility. But it is known that among thesufferers are cardinals, archbishops,abbots of monasteries, mother superiors and abbesses of convents and noblemen and women who are charitablydisposed.How did he do it? In many ways.He forged letters of introduction fromone bishop to another. He ingratiatedhimself here and there by conspicuous acts of charity and piety and sogot genuine letters of introductionfrom prelates and nobles.Among those upon whom he imposedwas the dowager duchess of Genoa,mother of Queen Margherita of Italy,in whose private chapel at Novara hesaid mass, and from whom he receiveda present. xWhen caught in Rome he was aboutto go to St. Peter's to say mass, theauthorization so to do being signed byCardinal Resplghi, which signature isdeclared to be a forgery.There wasx nothing new about hisswindles; they were' the old, well-worndevices, with which every one oughtto be familiar, but which work justas effectively today as they worked inthe time of Gil Bias.He is to be sent successively toeach of the cities where he is "wanted;" in each of them ho will be triedand, if convicted, will be sentenced. Sohe has the prospect of four or fiveprison terms, one after another, indifferent parts of Italy.VULCAN S-PLOWSMa The Yulcan Plow Co.,EVANS VI LLE, IMD.Well Finished, Strong, Durable, Light Draft.'Rib Strengthened Mold, Full Chilled Shinpiece, InterlockedPoint, Land and Standard.

IParis Team Defeats The Climax. I Ordered to Turn Over F. 4 C.At White Park Sunday afternoon theParis team administered a severe trimming to th Climax team of Cincinnati,winning by a score of 9 to 4. Only asmall crowd witnessed the contestwhich was snappy for the first fivesessions, but which during the closingrounds had an air of slowness about it.Manager Lewis sent Pete Wood tothe mound for the locals and he wentthe entire route in fine style, showing aslight weakness in but two innings,and then steadied himself and pitchedwinning ball.At no time during the game were thelocals in any serious danger of defeat,and were aided materially in the rungetting by the eight errors piled upagainst the visitors. Four of the sixhits of the visitors went for extrabases.The game put up by thft Paris teamwas quite an improvement of theirformer efforts in the exhibition gamesso far this season. Harrel and Goodman, two of last year's aggregationwere in the lineup and played withtheir old-time dash, that renewed thehopes of the fans.

Umpire Elgin.NOTES.Woods fields his position in a stylethat is pleasing to the fans, and occasions very favorable comment.Campbell and Fenzell in the outfieldare very fast but both seem to beweak at. the bat, quite an essentialwith an outfielder. "Out of five times up Dunlap securedonly one safe drive. He fielded hisposition fairly well on this occasion anda few games should improve him.The fans were pleased to see DannyHarrell on the job again playing withthe same old energy. He scored tworuns secured on a safe drive.Guiels, the latest arrival, was onsecond base. He batted at the highestmark in the contest Sunday, gettingtwo hits out of two times up, but theywere of the scratch order.The absence of team work on thepart of the locals probably hurt theirchances for a larger score, but it is toba hoped this will come before thechampionship season opens.The Bourbonites will meet the Lexington' Athletics this afternoon at"White Park at 3:15 oclock and tomorrow afternpon the GeorgetownCollege team will be here for a game.,,Popkin looks to be the goods on thefirst station, and the big fellow playedthe position like a veteran. He canhit the ball, too, and ripped out acorking two-bagger in the seventh.In the seventh Goodman sent astinging drive into the right gardenand easily reached third on the hit.His presence on the team is an assurance of a good, strong hitting and fastoutfielder.Woods, who went the entire conteston the mound for the locals showed upextremely well considering the amountof work he has had. He fanned elevenof the ooposing batsmen and allowedbut six hits. The game should improvehim wonderfully.MILLERSBURG ITEMS.Mrs. S. B. Turner was the guest offriends at Mt.
