general-in-chief of thev Cuban army of liberation dated at hissamp in Sancti Spiritus The enemiesof Cuba nave circulated in the UnitedStates the rumor that I am disposed toaccept autonomy as a basis of settlement or solution of the present warThe constitution of Cuba absolutely establishes that peace is be negotiatedupon the basis of absolute independence of Cuba It is to obtain independence that we have been fightingtwo years and will continue to fightuntil victory be oursAll statements that have beenhitherto or may be in the future published to the effect that we are willingto accept any other solution short ofindependence should be regarded asfalseWe will fight for absolute independence as we stated in the manifesto issued at Monte Cristo as also it waslater set down in our constitution andas we are daily confirming it by theshedding of our blood on the battlefieldsSalvador Cisneros former presidentof the republic of Cuba writes to theHeraldIndependence or death has

SpainThat is what eight leading Cubansall of whom formerly favored autonomy told Senor Jose Canalejas in theFifth Avenue hotel These Cubans didnot represent the junta for the juntawill discuss autonomy with no one butthe conference is the more remarkable in its result because themen who talked so firmly againstany proposition except independencewere formerly leading autonomistswho in view of recent developmentssay that even were they to listen tosuch a proposal the insurgents in thefield would simply scoff at it as an evidence not of Spains good faith butof her weakness and willingness

Nov 8 The contestfor control of the Ohio legislature wasconsidered ended Saturday The official counting in some counties willcontinue next week but there hasbeen such close watching that nomaterial changes are expected Theindications are that the senate willstand 19 democrats and 17 republicans and the house 51 democratsand 58 republicans with a majority offive republicans on joint ballot Theremay be several contested seats butthese can not be considered till thelegislature meets the first Monday inJanuary next Since it seems to besettled that the republicans have asmall majority on joint ballot therumors are revised about a combine ofcertain republican members with the70 democratic members for the electionof some one other than Senator Hannaon the joint ballotWhen Senator Foraker was indorsedby the republican state convention twoyears ago for his present position inthe senate there was no legislativecaucus It is announced now thatthere will be a republican senatorialcaucus when the legislature convenesnext Janury Senator Hanna was indorsed at the last convention for thesenate but the old factional fight thatformerly existed between Shermanand Forakers following and later between the friends of McKinley andForaker has been revived this yearwith more intense feeling than heretofore It is said that there are about adozen republican members who hadsome factional opposition in tijjeircounties especially for their nominations who do not feel kindly towardthe junior Ohio senatorThere has been so much talk aboutcombines that it is certain that republicans will hold a joint caucus for thenomination of a candidate for senatorand Senator Hanna will no doubt bethe caucus nominee It is thoughtthat as the regular nominee there willbe no trouble about his election as noneof the republican members would refuseunder the circumstances either to enterthe caucus or to support its nomineeThere are some republicans who arenot members of the legislature who aresaid to be working for an anti Hannacombine but none of the members areknown to favor such a movement GovBushnell will have a democrat senateon which to depend for the confirmation of his appointments and no partisan legislation can be passedIn addition to watching the officialcounting the representatives of candidates are out in the counties seeing themembers elect for the

Thenet gain over the previous year was533G It will thus be seen that thepension roll has not yet begun to showany diminution though it has beenanticipated by my predecessors in officethat such would be the fact Sevenwidows of revolutionary soldiers andnine daughters of revolutionary soldiers are still on the rollsDuring the year 94454 pension certificates were issued of which number50010 were

since he was ayouth He is more intelligent thanthe average seafaring men and his storyof the disaster as tpld early Sundaymorning is a thrilling oneWe left here Friday night bound forChicago with a cargo of general merchandise said he Everything seemed all right until we got outside thebreakwater and then we were struck bythe worst storm that I ever saw Whenthe first big breaker struck us wewere tossed up in the air like a top anda second latter a big roller came overthe port bow and rolled down amidships a foot deep The wind shriekedand howled but we did not pay muchattention to the storm We had feltwind before The captain consultedthe mate and decided that he couldweather it and he kept on his courseWe were near Long Point at thistime and the captain started to put inthere with the intention of beechingthe ship But the water gained sorapidly that it was too late She wasalready laboring and the two men atthe wheel could do nothing with herTwo more men went to work withthem and finally they brought heraround and headed her toward landCapt Gillis started the pumps ordered the men to the fire buckets andwe formed a line and began to bail butit was no use The water gained onthe pumps and the buckets and soonthe water put the fires outWhen it was found that the powerwas gone and that the Idaho could notbe moved we knew we could not live inthe trough of that fearful sea and theonly hope left us was to run out theanchor and bring her head up to the seaand let her ride out the galeEvery seaman realized that thedanger of attempting to do that inface of a hurricane and when CaptGills decided to do it he ordered thelashings of the boats cut and told themen ihey were forced to take onelast chance for their livesAt the word the anchor droppedfrom the bow and the chain began topay out but the sea was too heavy andinstead of the anchor catching with agrip and bringing the ships head upto the storm with a jerk it went tooslow and simply tumbled into thetrough of the seas which broke overher in torrentsShe was as helpless as a log andshe was tossed here and there and taking every wave aboardFrom port to starboard the greatmountains of water poured rolling into the hold and adding to the quantityalready weighting her down Theload was too much and after a moment when we all felt that we werelost the ship keeled over to the starboard and wTent down stern fii stI was near the spar and when the3tern of the vessel began to go underwent for the rigging and went up asfast as I could Another man went upwith me the second mate and I thankthe Lord that he was with me or Iwould have gone mad during all thelong hours that I was up there hanging on and trying to keep off the frightful cold that was slowly killing usbothAll this time the hail and sleet wascoming down in cutting sheets andwe were covered with ice in a fewminutes for though the top of thespar on which we were hanging was 25feet above the water the big wavesstruck us and broke over us and thehail cut us like shotWhen daylight come we couldntsee a sail anywhere near us and thesea was as bad as ever Hour afterhour he waited there and then we sawthe Mariposa coming For a long timeAve dd not know whether she wouldsight usWhen she finally sighted us and wesaw her head for us I tried to tell mymate but I couldnt and he looked atme with a happy look on his face Itwas a terrible time to us before shecame up to us and then I knew wewere not safe yet for the sea was running mountain highWhen the Maiiposa got within acable length of us a man with a strongvoice yelled to us to hang onDont give up boys he yelledWell get you off soon Then theboat circled around usas she couldrmiTln c c lianiiuwiAiin o uUiLbut when she was withina few rods a big roller swept her farout aud she went off to starboard rolling heavily when she got in the troughof the sea Then she came back ag ainand again she missed us and wecouldnt have taken a line had onebeen thrown to us Again she wentaround and we watched herand watched the men on her railwaiting to give us a lift when theycould On the third trip around sheran right alongside our spar and as shewent past a dozen men reached for usAmerican Race Horses

strange wierdair that Lilian-played and she played it with skill andpower The others listened silently forna fewmaments then Mrs Eoundtreesaid to the mayorWe really must not talk about thataffair before her her mind has beendwelling on it all day She has beento me three times to say that it wouldbe quite natural for snch a criminal todesire to be revenged on you for offering the reward She tries to hide herinterest in the subject but it shows itself every minute She was so eagerto hear the news that she wenit downto the gate to meet the newsboy withthe afternoon paper and I had to speakto her twice to get her attention aftershe had read the account of the crimeJjisten to her music Cant you detecther nervousness in her playing Shedoesnt play that way usually Hushshe has stoppedIt is tea time said Lilian comingto the door Why dont you come inWith a solicitous expression on hislace Fred Walters rose and puttingbis arm around her slender waist ledlier before the others into the diningroom She was tall and graceful andquite pretty Her eyes were large andhazel vher hair light brown and abundant Her feet were small and weljshaped her hands long tapering andstrong lookingThe family talked of other thingsthan the murder during the meal butLilian took no part in what was said43he ate slowly and daintily and seemedthougbtful After tea Marion hisfather and mother and Fred Waltersnad a game of whist in the drawingroom Lilian had never liked the gameShe improvised some soft airs on thepiano and then rose and went out onthe veranda Through the open window her mother could see her chairrocking back and forth Later MrsEoundtree became interested in thegame and did not think of her daughter for half an hour When the gamewas finished she looked towards Lilianschair It was vacantWhy where is Lilian the motherasked excitedly She was on theveranda just now Mrs Eoundtreecalled the girls name aloud but tiherewas no replyThey all rose hurriedly and went tothe door vaguely alarmedLilian Lilian Mrs Eoundtreecalled from the verandaHere I am motherThe repty came from down the walkamong the boxwood-and-rose-bushesI am coming dont be frightenedWhy my child how can you be soimprudent cried Mrs Eoundtree asthe girl came into the light of the gasin the hall Lilian was trying to conceal something imder the light shawlshe wore and walked rather awkwardlyas she came up the steps As her husband approached her she retreated intothe shadow of the wall near the doorThen suddenly she broke into a lowmechanical laughThe truth is she said seeing thatthe others were waiting for an explanation of her actions I eame near having an adventure I saw a man climbover the fence down by the rosebushes I knew he had no businessthere andYou went down ihere her mothergaspedThe girl laughed coldty and drew arevolver from beneath her shawl Iran up and got Freds revolver I wasnot afraid I knew I dont know howJ knew it but I was sure he was notarmed and that if I could catch himI could frighten him into submission-She swung the revolver to and fro skillfully in her strong fingers But hegot away He sprang over the fenceand ran as soon as he saw me I wouldhave fired at him but I knew he wasbeyondrange and that the report wouldfrighten you out df your witsThe group stood motionless and silentfor a moment Then Fred Waltersdrew a long breath as he stepped towards his wife with extended handGive it to me he said in a strangeimperative toneWith a sudden look of defiance shefceld iba revolver behind her and asVfzissaSF-he drew nearer she threw it over thebalustrade into the llower bedsI did not mean to do that she criedimpulsively then she was doggedlysilentFred Walters went down the stepspicked up the revolver and came backexamining it in the light0Its loaded he said under his breathto the mayorOf course its loaded the girlblurted out Do you think Id go downtiiere to meet a a red handed murderer with an unloaded revolverThen with a deep flush on her face shepassed through the light at the doorand resumed her seat in the rockingchair before the windowMy darling began Mrs Eoundtree finding her voice at last and advancing towards herDont call me pet names broke inthe young wife Women are suchweak beings that the moment one ofus does a sensible thing she is reprovedI am not afraid really afraid of anycreature that ever walked on the earthI only did what Fred or papa wouldhave don Why I am a better shotthan Fred and he knows it Lets talkof something elseWithout another word the mayor andhis wife and son left Fred Walters withLilian and went into the drawing roomShe has always been a strange creature sighed Mrs Eoundtree but shehas never acted so queerly before OhIm very much afraid she and Fred willnot get along well together They areso different Dont you think he lookeda little vexed just now dearMore surprised than anything elseI thought replied the mayorJust then Fred and his wife passedthe door going towards the stairsThere are two sides to the questionLilian was saying Would you mindkeeping yours to yourselfFred looked in with a flushed faceWe are going to bed he said Shewill be all right in the morning I hadno business to teach her to shootCHAPTER VILate in the night Mrs Eoundtree wasawakened by a light touch on herbrowIt is I mamma dont be frightened And Lilian sat down on the sideof the bed I have not been able tosleep for for my hasty words thisevening 11 you will forgive me I cango back to bed and sleepMrs Eoundtree drew her face downand kissed itThere is nothing to forgive darling she answered But why haveyou got on that heavy wrap and whyI declare its damp Have you surelyyou have not been- out againThe girl drew herself up stiffly andwas silent for a moment The room wasfaintly lighted by the moonbeams butMrs Eoundtree could not see her faceNo I have not been out she saidhesitatingly at first and then speaking more rapidly but I have been sitting at the open window and the dewmay have fallen on me from thevinesBut why have you been up dearBecause I could not sleep and didnot want to disturb Fred by my restlessness And and then mother totell the truth I was not certain thatthe man I saw might not come backagain Now dont be frightened butI am pretty sure that it was the murderer and that he has designs againstns It would be the most natural thingin the world Fathers offer of a bigreward is like an open challenge to himThe man who wrote those notes and didthat deed is deep and cunning and Idont believe hell be easily caughtMrs Eoundtree sat up in bed andput her arm around her daughterOh dear you dont know how miserable your talk makes me You speakand act so queerty Go back to bed andtry to sleep You have thought of allthis till it has unnerved youThe girl coldly drew herself from hermothers embrace and stood away fromherI was never calmer absolutelynever calmer in my life she saidquickly She stared at her mother fora moment then she stepped towardsher with an arm outstretched Youknow when the pulse of anyone is excited Feel mine No 3xu have got todo it I am serious I will not be accused of being agitated when I am ascalm as I can be Feel it I sayMrs Eoundtree was obliged to takeher wrist and press her trembling fingers on the veinsYou see the girl went on I am notexcited but you are for 3 011 are quivering all over Lie down and go to sleepagain I am sorry I waked you Andshe turned and went out of the roomThe next morning while the familywere at breakfast James the butlerbrought a folded paper to the mayorHe said he had found it among therose bushes near the gate It wastjpewritten and addressed to MayorEoundtree As he opened it MrsEoundtree turned pale and Fred Walters stared fixedly at him Lilian didnot seem to have noticed the mans entrance nor did she seem to hear hermother say What is it dear asshe leaned towards her husband Themayor finished the note and mutelyhanded it to his wife Fred Waltersgot up ami stood behind Mrs Eoundtrees chair reading the note over hershoulderBring me a hot roll Jane said MrsWalters to the girl who was waitingat the table Then she seemed to noticethat Fred had moved from her sideWhy Fred she said is it politeto look over mammas lettersA look of deep concern was on Wallers face He caone back to his chairwithout replying The mayor tookthe sheet of paper put it into hispocket and awkwardly resumed hisbreakfastSomething Ive no hajod 5n thatsplain said Lilian Well I dont careyouve always tried to make a babyof me Then her color rose suddenly as she added But I know what itis as well as you do It is a communicaTFttion from the man who was prowlinground the house last night I wishI had shot himA deep silence followed her remarkFred Walters looked at her with apained puzzled expression and as hesaw that she was folding her napkinpreparatory to leaving he put out hishand to detain her but she pushed itaway impatiently Keep the matterto yourselves she said angrily Youall have so much more intelligence thanI haveAfter she had left the room no onespoke for several minutes The mayortook the note from his pocket and silently reread it It was as followsDear SirMake your reward 500000 and even thenyou would never capture me That was arash thing for you to do Look to the safety of your family Youll never know themoment it will happen Your case shallreceive my earliest considerationONE WHO KNOWS HIS BUSINESSWhat are you going to do MrsEoundtree faltered rising with her husbandTake it to the police and that NewYork detective he answered Itsall I can do and thats my dutyI would not go out so early saidMrs Eoundtree Do you think it willbe safe to leave us aloneFred can stay I shall not let thismake any difference in my usual habitsBesides I think it is only an idlethreatYes I will stay Walters agreedI dont like to leave Lilian anywayshe is not well she has not finished herbreakfastHad you not better ask the police toguard our house We are so isolatedyou know And in her deep anxietyMrs Eoundtree leaned heavily on herhusbands armI shall ask the police and Mr Hendricks about that and shall do as theyadvise Id better go down at onceCHAPTEE VIIA week went by The body of EichardN Strong had been buried and AlfredWhidby was considered the legal possessor of his effects Whidby had not beenseen on the streets or at his club sincethe murder It was on the eighth dayafter the burial that Col Warrentoncalled to see him He was shown up toWhidbys roomThe ypung man rose from the tableat which he was writing and shookhands with his friend He was palethin and nervous His eyes were sunken his hair and dress untidyStill up here in your new quarterssaid the colonel sweeping the rather1 was never calmersmall room with a glance I thoughtyoud move back to your old roomWhidby shuddered I dont care tosleep there by Jove I dont believe Icould close my eyesThe two men had taken seats opposite each other and the lawyer emphasized his next remark by laying hfshand firmly on Whidbys knee Myboy this will never do You nevrmake a soldier Youve got to rousfcyourself and shake it off Youll loseyour reason if you go brooding overthis thing To tell the truth you arelooking worse and worse every dayDid you sleep last nightAbout two hours all told repliedWhidby I know I am in bad shape Ican see it and feel itLook here my boy the colonelslapped Whidbys knee soundly Iwant you to pull up and take a trip toEurope It will give you a change ofscene and something else to thinkabout Youll be a new man in amonthWhidby rose and began to place hispapers in order on the table Id neverbe able to think of anything else nomatter where I was and then it wouldbe like running away by Jove it wouldbe running I am sure that Ivedone wrong in keeping back that matterfrom Hendricks Its cowardlyYou could tell them nothing thatwould help them and it would onlyplace you under deeper suspicion thelawyer repliedMy God Id just as soon be in aprison cell as here under the awful uncertainty as to whether I did it or notWhat did you say What do youmeanWhidby walked slowly from the tableand laid his hand on his friends shoulderI am afraid I had something to dowith the murder I cant figure it outany other way The blood on the curtain the stain you found on the chain1my dim recollection of taking hold ofthe chair the drop of blood on iny cuffwhy my hand it was the right handyou know must have been absolutelywet with itAre you fool enough to think youcould have killed a man in your sleepwithout being conscious of the act Besides remember the smile on Strongsface youre obliged to admitThats exactly what puts me on thisline Whidby interrupted I noticedin a New York paper an interview withDr Henry Lampkin the famous hypnotic expert in which he said casuallythat from what he read of the case hejudged that my uncle was hypnotizedby the murderer Well Warrenton Iam sure if I were to tell him what occurred to me that night he would saythat 1 was also hypnotized that perhaps I was made to do the deed for1 some one else Such things have beenVdcSOi man that is what is troublinttme It is awful IThgre was silence for amoment thenthe colonel saidEjfttell you what I would do AlfredI ddnlt think you could have been under any influence that night but if youaregoing to brood over the matter thisway Still you are insane I propose thatwe have Dr Lampkin to come downhereand give us his opinion He is saidto bpa wonderful man and he may atall events give you sobiepeaceof mindHeasSsaid to be making marvelous curesamong intemperate people and childrenjnaturally aepraved through whathe calls hypnotic suggestion Fromwhat T hear of him I believe he can betrusted even in such a delicate matter astbls4rWhidbys face brightened Thatsjust what I want he said Anythingis abetter than suspense He may beable to tell me whether I actually didthe deed If he can assure me that itwas not my hand that held the knifehe is welcome to every dollar of myuncles estateOh he wont break us his prices arenot High ihe does a great deal for no payat nil But I shall write him at onceand report to you as soon as his replycomes I believe hypnotism is a wonderful thing but something tells me thatit could not be carried to the extent youfear Besides you may not have beenhypnotized at all you may have beenslightly disturbed by the fellows movements in Strongs room and got up halfawake and gone after the murder tohis bed to reassure yourself It mayhave been then that you got your handsin the blood without knowing itAh you give me the first bit of hopeI have had cried Whidby Write tohim at once I wish he were here nowIll get him as soon as he can comethe colonel promised and he rose to goAt the door he turned backI am trying to work up a little clewfor myself he said I am fond of thissort of thing Id give anything to beatthis expert detective and run our man tothe ground without consulting himBy the way you and I might try tothink of some motive for the crime Theothers are doubtless losing valuabletime in suspecting you Now do youhappen to remember if your uncle everhad an enemyNot that I know of Whidbyanswered I dont think he could Hewas an easy going man and lived veryquietly that is since I have knownhim Years ago when he was a youngman I believe he had rather an adventurous life in the gold mines out westsomewhere You know he made hisstart there He has never told me muchabout those days In fact I have oftenthought he was oddly silent on the subjet It seems to have been the only partof his history that he has not talked tome freely aboutDo you know of any poor relationthat may have troubled him for aid inany wayNo But why do you ask I dontimdejrstand jI cant tell you now but 1 am searching for a motive for the crime Evenif you could have been hypnotized therewould still have to be a motive for thecrime If the murderer was a skillfulhypnotist he was no fool and the motive must have been a strong one ButI see you

Madeline from time to timechose her escorts from Jacks companions her heart would smite her forJack but it seemed quite out of thequestion to do anything so publicwhere Jack was concerned The public however did not dream that Jackwas slighted because he was loved nordid Jack himself dream of such athing he poor fellow thought it wasthe love he bore Madeline that kept heraloof But when had he made itknown Never To whom had hemade it known To nobody Not evento MadelineBut Madeline was continually dreaming of Jack and the more she dreamedthe more difficult it became to deliverthe bridle of the

that he wouldsink if she didnt What was the matter How did she know that he presumed to love her He would go awaywhere he could be by himself whilst hethought it over Accordingly he passedwith long

Tiger Chiefs hoofs could beheard in rythmic cadence till theypassed out of hearingIn the silence following Jack passedthe bend in the road There was another a little farther on Madeline wasout of

people who reside in the quaintand delightful old town of AlexandriaVa is a deacon who notwithstandinghis great piety is a man of practicalcommon sense and believes in the expediency of things just as some of hisillustrious predecessors in Testamenttimes did Among those things whichhe considers of especial commendationis brevity in sermons and the ministerof the church at which the deacon attended was always known as a shortsermon man and his congregation wasalways correspondingly longOn one occasion it is narrated thatthe deacon when the church last neededa pastor went to a theological seminaryof the proper denomination to hearsome of the young men preach if so beamong them might be one who wouldfind favor in the deacons sight It being some extra service of the churchthere was preaching on Saturday andSunday and the deacon had an opportunity to hear several sermons Sunday evening at tea the president of theseminary asked the deacon what hethought of the sermons he had heardhesitated the deaconI cant say that I am altogether satisfied doctorWhy bless my soul deacon whatswrong exclaimed the president inastonishmentWell they dont seem to quite exactly strike me right said the gooddeacon hedging for charitys sakeThat is beyond me continued thepresident half musingly as if he weretrying to work the problem out in hismind All of them are picked mandeacon our rising young preachersIs that so responded the deaconwith a smile of hope showing in his honest faceIndeed it is said the presidentThen doctor smiled the deaconsuppose you let me hear to night oneof your sitting down young preachersI think thats what Im looking forThe president understood and theyoung man who preached that nightbecame pastor of the deacons churchthough he left its pulpit ten years

peculiarity of hiamental state The patient who is a manof first class education and exceptionalmental powers is liable to what isknown as circular insanity That is tosay he is only affected periodically andbetween his fits he is as sane a man asone could wish to meet His speech during the lecture was most brilliaut being characterized by exceptional eloquence and considerable wit The lecture lasted an hour and during thattime he contrived to hold his audiencewithout a break His look and bearingwhich were those of a scholar made itwell nigh impossible for his hearersto associate him with insanity in anyform Tit BitsTHE CONTINENTAL EDGErV Sea Level Not a Surface ofform CurvatureWe may apply what may seem onspecial portions of the coastline to thewlidlo margin of sea and land to thecontinental edge itself Prom thispoint of view we soon iearn that whatwe call the mean level is not a surface of uniform curvature or an ellipsoid inclosing a smooth and theoreticalearth but is bent up or down accordingto the nearness or remoteness of thecontinental mass sothatthesealevelishigh against the land and low in thecenter of the oceans Could we removethe attraction of the continentalmasses many oceanic islands wouldthus disappear beneath the wavesIce masses have naturally been invoked to account for some of the raisedbeaches An unusual accumulation ofpolar ice would draw the oceanic waters northward and would raise the sealevel along our shores but Lord Kelvinhas shown that the enormous thicknessof the ice at one time demanded is aphysical impossibility in an uninclosedbasin owing to the outward viscousflow of the material which tends evenat polar temperatures to thin and flatten the whole mass Nor would allthe ice postulated by the extremestglacialist account for the untilting orlocal curvature of the shell beds or terraces that are left behind The Chaixhills of Alaska to quote one fine example are composed of strata containingshells still living in the adjacent oceanYet these beds 4000 to 5000 feet inthickness are bent up so as to dip northward at an angle of 10 to 15 degrees overa distance of about nine miles We haveherealong the coast line of the Pacifica range of hills 3000 feet in height weshould call the mountains in ourown country produced by a comparatively modern uplift along the continental edgeWhether we study the American seaboard down the volcanic hills of Chiliand Pern or the coral coast of the Indies and Australia or our own stormsAvept western promontories we findthe same series of phenomena the sameproblem to be solved It seems generally agreed by this time that continental margins are unstable and thatthey mark lines of movement in thecrust or skin of the earth The NorthAmerican continent is actually flankedbv mountain chains formed of intensely crumbled strata and SouthAmerica presents toward the Pacificits magnificent backbone of the AndesThe Pacific as a whole is ringed aboutwith earth folds the details of whichindicate a spreading of the continentsat the expense of the ocean basin andthe progress of movement along theselines of weakness is marked by violentvolcanic actionAlong the Pacific work is evidentlybeing done and the deep oceanic depressions bordering the continentaledges are the submerged limbs of thefolds that form these ledges The lateProf J D Dana long ago pointedout how the earth ridges and the longoceanic grooves were related to one another the greater mountain chain having the deeper depression along itsiiank In a word as he urged thehighest mountains faced the deepestportions of the ocean and their steeper flanks descend toward the oceanLondon KnowledgeNON COMMISSIONED OFFICERSMilitary Iiife Very Distasteful to aFrenchmanThe question of non commissionedofficers is in itself a serious one as theFrench have long recognized So apparently distasteful is the military lifeto the average Frenchman that whenhis short period of service is over hecan with the greatest difficulty be induced to reengage to complete a longerperiod as a sous officier In 18S9 thereengaged sous officiers in the Frencharmy that is men of over three yearsservice numbered but 16000Even in our own small regular forcewe have at present upward of 14000sergeants Such a figure is quite inadequate for the purposes of an armjwith a peace strength of over 500000and an estimated war streng th of abouteight times that sizeSo obvious was the danger that inducements were offered in 1889 on whateven we should consider a liberal scalein the shape of bounties increased paypensions on leaving and eventual civilemployment to those sous officierswho should reengage beyond threeyears for even comparatively shortterms and these measures caused thenumbers of reengaged men to rise toover 24000 in 1S93 but at a considerablecostThe law of 1893 reduced these advantages in some particulars with theimmediate result that the reengagement fell off so that on January 1 1S9Gthe numbers of reengagedhad sunk below 16000 lowerthan everA new law restoring some of theprivileges of this very important classhas lately been passed and it is hopedthat the numbers may again rise

dawe all sailed to a location where sharkswere reported to be very numerousWe wanted some big game and sharksare mighty good sport Well we finallymanaged to hang to a fellow big enoughto satisfy any fellow in the boat andin their anxiety to see the fish while itwas still vigorous the boys gatheredat the side of the sloop looking overinto the water All at once the captivegave a desperate pull The tackleslipped and the shark took about 30feet of line while one of tlie sailors wasjerked into the water He couldntswim and his hands happened to comein contact with the shark line hegrappled it with

crying out that the shark had bitten him There was commotion in thewater and the fin of the fish appeared1above the water for a moment and thesailor yelled again and flecks of bloodarose to the

seen thatthe shark had the fellows leg firmlybetween its jaws and it was a wonderthat the fish had not bitten the limb offA shot from the rifle killed the fish andwe pried its jaws andliberated the legwhich was badly lacerated The factthat the hook had caught in the socketwas the thing that saved the leg fromabsolute amputation The idea of aman being bitten by a fish that hadpractically been

country has acertain amount of his capital iurestedin farm implements It is not an uncommon occurrence to meet men whosay that the outlay each year for newimplements eats up nearly all theprofits in their business This expenditure may be materially reduced saysFarmers Advocate by giving better attention to repairing and housing allthe machinery as soon as convenientafter the busy season is over On manywell regulated farms it is customary toput the implements under coverthroughsiH the summer when not inuse By this means the implements willwear much longer and do more satisfactory work It also adds much to theappearance of a farm to have the implements inside rather than havingeach one used to close up a hole in thefence or perhaps for a less suitable purpose Though it may be the rule onmany farms to put away the harvestingimplements for the winter at this season it is the exception to find a farmerwho goes carefully over his machineand puts it in proper condition for nextseasons work The person who hasused the implement during the summerknows exactly what repairs are required and unless it is looked after atonce or a note made of it the chancesare that nothing will be done until themachine is taken out of the shed to begin operations next year A good planis to carry a notebook and keep an account of all repairing required Thenduring the fall or winter season have allthe necessary repairing done A blacksmith or machinist has more time to -examinethe work in winter than just before harvest when every person iscrowding him with some little job Hecan do the work more satisfactorilyand the cost will not be so great Inmany cases the repairing can be doneby the farmer himself when he hassome leisure time and thus avoid thetrouble and cost of taking it to a repairshop If farmers would pay dose attention to repairs -each year and givethe implements an occasional coat ofpaint many would be surprised by thedifference they would find in the working of the machinery as well as in timetheir implements would wear Then bysupplying suitable sheds and a -smallrepair snop there would be less discussion about the excessive cost of agricultural implementsWEIGHT OF

custom of-iting Paris to hand over at the close otheir stay a sum of money varying according to circumstances fortion among the poor Beyond the an-nouncement of the fact in the papersthere is as a rule little more heard ofthese generous donations A story has-just been made public however conrjfcerning the most recent donations of1iiq nhnrnntpr wliinli has caused no lit--Jttie comment amoncr those wno Have tnereal welfare of the poor at heart andwho have for long been loud in- theirprotestations against this sort of indiscriminate charityWhen the czar left Paris at the end oflast year he handed over to the authorirties no less than 20000 for distribution among the poqrj and this by orderof the public assistance departmentwas divided among the bureaux debienfaisance or outdoor relief officesin different parts of the city The relieving-officer in one district has viewsof his own as to the best manner inwhich to tender help to the really poorand he has always been doubtful as tothe ultimate destination of the moneywhich he has distributed on similaroccasions In the present instance theczars gift was divided into sums of twofrancs and each applicant received anew fwo franc piece The official inquestion however took the trouble tomark each coin which he handed outand some days after the distribution hesent one of his assistants to a neighboring cabaret to change there a 1000 f rancnote wTith the request that he might receive as much of the change as possiblein two franc pieces A large proportionof the coins brought back his superiorrecognized as the money he had markedand handed out to the so called deservng poor a day or two before It wasevident that the majority of the peoplein his district at all events had gonestraight from the relieving office to thepublic house and had no doubt spentthe whole or the greater part of themoney received by them in drinking theczars health For some months thematter was kept an official secret butas I have said it has now been madepublic with the result that the wholesystem of outdoor relief has been subjected to a hot fire of criticism It ispointed out that while they have beenhanding out money lavishly to habitualdrunkards and to those whose povertyis the direct result of their own misdoing the deserving applicants whoan alittle temporary help might have putupon the path of permanent employment are left to die of starvation intheir squalid cellars and atticsOne of the papers however has interviewed one of the actual recipients ofthe czars money who endeavors tomake out that because the two francpieces were changed at the tavern inquestion it does not follow that the-whole sum was spent in drink Heavers that it is the ordinary custom ofthe wretched class to which he belongsto take a single glass of absinthe whenever any small sum of money cornedinto their possession The poisonousstuff acts as a sort of pick me up andpulls them together especially whenthey have been long fasting It is nodoubt true he says that some of thelucky owners of the czars two francpieces spent the whole of that enormoussum in further glasses of absinthebut he asserts that the majority including himself after their single revivingdraught went home and spent thechange out of the two francs in foodor used it to pay a portion of their rentPhiladelphia Public LedgerA Itemxirlcahle HorseDr Watkins
