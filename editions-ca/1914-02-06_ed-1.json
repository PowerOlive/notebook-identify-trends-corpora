ness of Alaska, was revealed Monday
in a telegram received by Mrs. D. S.
Haslam, of Duluth, Minn. The tele
gram was sent from Candle, Alaska,
where the body of her brother, Wm.
H. Myers, was found. Myers was a
placer miner, and had extensive hold
ings in gold and gold mines about
Candle and White Horse passes. He
met Miss Lucy B. Hayes, a Kentucky
girl, who went to Alaska to teach
school. Myers planned to emerge
from the wilderness Christmas and
marry the young teacher. The girl is
thought to be in Seattle. The tele
gram stated that' Myer had been froz
en to death. His last letter said he
had found a fortune.
