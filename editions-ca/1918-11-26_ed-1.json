IN MEMORIAL,
One of nature's noble women,
Dorothy Lee Paynter, passed to the
bourne fropn which no traveler le
turneth, on Tuesday, Nov. 19, in Cin
cinnati, Ohio.
I have known this sweet girl from
childhood and have watched her
grow'th into glorious young wopian
hood, and I can truthfully say that
I have never known a truer, lovlier
character. X have never known her
to say an unkind word or to commit
an unkind ded. She was truly a
thorough Christian in every way.
About four years ago she chose as
her calling the noble profession of
nursing, and in that length of time
has soothed and administered to many
sick and suffering, and borne com
fort to many sorrowful hearts. She
was always ready with a kind word
and cheerful smile to help the way
farers along the weary pathway of
life, always ready to bEr another's
troubles, and to make The burden
lighter. God saw fit to take her from
us in the very flower of her youth,
but how thankful we are that He
saved her all suffering and lulled her
to sleep like a little, tired child in its
mother's arms.
My heart goes .out to the stricken
(mother and family, for she was tEe
youngest born and the idol of ,the
whole household, and her absence
makes a void that can never be filled,
not only in the family circle, but
among her dear friends as well. This
ist he second bereavement in the
past three weeks, the father having
passed away on November 3. But
how comforting it is to knew that
ere this they have had a happy re
union above. Still another consoling
thought is that when life's fitful fever
is over and that when God opens the
gates of Heaven to us, we know that
our aear Dorothy will be standing
with the rest of our loved ones that
have gone before, and be ready -to
greet us with, her bright, sweet smile
when we enter the home of our ra
ther above.

STANBABJ) HOGSHEAD FOR
BACC0 SUGGESTED.
TQ-
In order to permit full utilization
of equipment in. the shipment of to
bacco from Kentucky and other pro
ducing States, a plan for the adop
tion of a so-called "standard hogs
head," which, will llow double tipr
ing in freight cars used for this pur
pose, is being worked out by Direc
tor "General McAdoo in conjunction
with the War Industries Board, ac
cording to the announcement made
in Washington.
Under the proposed arrangement,
instead of requiring 50,000 cars to
imove 1,500,000 pounds of tobacco,
probably the same amount can ibe
transported in 32,000 cars by use of
the "standard containers."
Under the present system tobacco
to be used in the manufacture of ci
garettes, chewing and smoking to
bacco moves in hogsheads 48 by 52
inches, 48 by 56 .inches or 48 by 60
inches, which, does not permit of full
utilization of equipment. An effort
is now being made to have adopted a
standard hogshead of 46 by 4 inches.

UNCLE SAM'S POLICE FORCE
Keeping order in Europe, now that
the war is ended, is going to be the
biggest police job this old world has
ever known. '
B'ut it will have to be done.
For there are about 10,000,000
fellows scattered. about the continent
right now who have acquired the
fighting habit these last five years.
They 'were getting tired of the big
game before it ended, but this
doesn't mean that they would hesi
tate to mix it up over their own lit
tle differenced.
Take the Balkans for instance.
They have been a hotbed of distur
bance for years. The ijmmediate pre
text for this war developed there.
And their old-time animosities and
jealousies have not been wiped out
by their recent experiences. They
are liable to flare out again at any
moment.
Then tjiere is the big question of
Russia. - There are millions of for
mer serfs still drunk with the wine
of newfound freedom. They have pill
aged and plundered and "killed with
out restraint for months. The whole
nation is still seething. And order
must be restored there before a'ny
permanent and rational government
can be established. 4
And just what Turkey will have
to offer to the complication of affairs
in general is yet to be developed-
There are sojme pretty long beats
to be patrolled in this police job.
It's a long, long way from Vladivo
stock to Petrograd; from Petrograd
to Bagdad, and from the Holy Land
to that near neighbor to hell, Berlin.
-It looks like a big lot of -.Uncle
Sam's soldier boys might be kept, in
Europe for many months to come.
And they will have to be maintained
adequately.
-Inevitably it means another Liber
ty Loan at least. It may ..mean two,
