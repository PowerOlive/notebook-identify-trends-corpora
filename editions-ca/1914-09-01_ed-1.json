PUBLIC NOTICE.
Two-thirds of the people of Paris
use hydrant water for drinking pur
poses. The less water in Stoner the
greater the probability of pollution.
Do not use it extravagantly. It is bet
ter to sacrifice the beauty of the
lawn or the fruitfulness of the garden
than to chance a human life,
(tf) A. H.- KELLER, Health Officer.
Youth and beauty predominated
in the assembly that gathered at the
Masonic Temple, (Elks' Hall) Friday
night to participate in the pleasures
of the last subscription dance of the
season. These entertainments, which
have been the most notable of any
ever given by the younger society
element of Paris, are now interrupted
by the spectre of "school days,"
which will take most of the dancers
back to book and studies.
The dance, which was promoted by
Messrs. Ireland Davis and Lucien
Arnsparger, was a dainty affair, and
wag thoroughly enjoyed by all.
The hall was beautifully decorated
in green, wbjite nd tango yellov,
long ropes of Southern smilax draped
from the chandeliers lending their
tones to the color scheme. The fa
mous Wright's Saxaphone Trio from
Columbus, O., stationed in the bal
cony, furnished dance music that
couldn't be resisted, and from 9:30
to 4, with an intermission from 12 to
1, nimble feet went through the
mazes of popular dances to the silent
accompaniment of laughing eyes and
happy hearts. At midnight a lunch
eon, consisting of old ham, chicken
salad, beaten biscuits, cheese and
nut sandwiches, pickles and coffee,
wes served.
Messrs. Davis and Arnsparger, now
known as "Premier Dance Promot
ers," contributed largely to the pleas
ures and success of the event, as in
deed, they have all others, and the
guests of the evening were warm in
their praise.

Columbia Theatre To-day.
A Tragedy of the Orient, (Broncho)
Miss Tsura Aoki and a company,
made up for the most part of Japa
nese players, have done well in this
two-reel with a story which has a dis
tinctively Oriental flavor.
"Sealed Order" in two parts, is
the tale of the other feature for to
day. J. Warren Kerrigan plays the
leading part.
Columbia To-Morrow.
Episode No. 8 The Wiles of a Wo
man The conspirators determine to
get rid of Norton, who is too active
against them. They carry out sever
al dastardly schemes all of which
fail. Finally, in desperation, they de
cide to throw him through a man
hole and let him drown in the sewer.
Their plan progresses successfully.
He is thrown through the man-hole,
but fate, playing his side of the bat
tle, brings ahout his rescue after a
terrible struggle for life in the dark
ness of the sewer. The Countess says
he bers a charmed life. They decide
that to estrange Florence and Nor
ton, who are secretly engaged, will
help them. Braine and the Countess
form a shrewd plan which the Coun
tess artfully carries out, whereby
Florence in deceived into believing
Norton false to her and she flees
from the Countess' apartment in
heart-broken grief.
"POTASH & PERLM UTTER."
There is a laugh in every line of
"Potash & Perlmutter," the famous
comedy of the cloak and suit trade
that manager A. H. Woods will pre
sent at the Paris Grand on Thursday,
September 10th, direct from its sec
ond year at the Cohan Theatre, New
York City. The three-act play is one
long riot of humor humor broken
from time to time by patho3 and sus
pense enough to form a strong fra
matic contrast which holds the aud.
ence spell-bound until the very last
word is spoken. Greggs' Imperial
Orchestra of the Colonial Theatre,
Lexington, will furnish the music.
