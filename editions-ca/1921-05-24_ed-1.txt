The speedsters nave no respectwhatever for the ordinances and lessfor the safety of those who are compelled to use the streetsSunday was anything but a day ofpeace on this street, owing to thelarge number of automobiles whichraced up and down, with cut-outsopen, recklessly plunging, throughspace, regardless of anything andeverything.

Then after the officershave gone they proceed to putthrough the same old program.It is a lasting shame and disgraceto the city of Paris that these peopleshould be allowed to continue thisdangerous practice. It is impossiblefor the patrolmen to be at any pointat the right time, consequently theyare unable to catch the offenders.Ttemonstrances have no effect, pleadings are in vain, the danger of accident is nothing to them, as long asthey are making their speed-burnersgo the Derby pace in the automobilemarathon.

Bldg. Chicago.Few advertising men know thatadvertising space in newspapers isby far the economical way to reachthe consumer. It is a fact and theonly reason that advertising wasever created was because wise andshrewd business ,men learned thatthey could buy white space in publications at a minimum cost and because of the message they would putinto that space they could make aprofit on the transaction and makethe advertising a real investment in,production of sales and good-will; 'In these days of high cost of whitepaper and printing the advertisercould not print a full-page advertisement and buy the white paper at thesmall cost that the newspaper charg-es him tor tne complete page delivered into the home by invitation.That is to say, the readers of thisnewspaper buy a paper because theywant to read it and because theyknow they get more for their moneyat five cents than anything elsethey could buy at that price. Thatis what makes the advertising so valuable to the advertiser, provided theyhave the right message, the rightillustration and the right merchandising plan back of the advertising.Newspaper advertising is by farthe most economical method to reachthe consumer.WILLIAM H.

B. 'Clark, of Detroit, who saidhe spoke for the National RetailDry Goods Association, the NationalAssociation of Retail Clothiers, theNational Retail Shoe Dealers' Associ- jation, and the National GarmentRetailers' Association.Certainly the plan would divideall incomes into three classes andthey with the aid of a sales taxwould carry practically the entirerevenue burdens. Mr. Clark projKJsed raising the exemptions on pergonal incomes from the present $1,000 for single persons to $2,500,and from $2,000 for parried personsto $5,0 10, with an additional $500exemption from each child or dependent,' instead of the present $2,500.Tbe witness also would lower thehigher rates on income sur-taxes.oA mild winter bumped the dealersin fleece-lined underwear.

They are as follows:THE ANTI-TIPPLING MOVEMENT.1.- 35e it known, .tkat,ywe, themembers of the Anti-Tippling Leaguede flatly denounce the use of babies'nursing bottles. Babies using thenursing bottles are liable to acquirethe habit of .tippling, and such habitswill greatly embarrass the faithfulefforts of the Sahara League, whohave worked so feverishly to keepbottles away from the future generation. We, the members of the Anti-Tippling League, do recommend feeding babies thru straws, as such procedure will eventually eliminate theuse of the filthy nursing bottle. We,the members of the Anti-TipplingLegue, solicit the assistance of allpreformed drunkards, professional reformers, wet prohibitionists, and allothers opposed to personal liberty.Ltet-jyu Knights of Deccecation assietfurf in 'tke Elimination of theUltky Hufog iwttle.THE," ATMATltlC FERMENTAtTWN" MOVEMENT.2. Be it known, that we, themembers of the Anti-Gastric Fermentation League, will make known agreat error made by the compounders of the-U-Kant-Havit League.JBeit known, that the compounders - ofthe U-Kant-Havit League, whiledrawing up the Sahara Cod6, failedto mention Gastric Fermentation.Let it be known, that we, the members of the Anti-Gastric Fermentation League, have this day caused tobe written in said Sahara Code, aclause to prohibit the fermentationof the" gastric ingestia ' in humanstomach. Be it further known, thatas soon as the clause has receivedhonored legislation and becomes a realization, those persons failing totake 1 drahm (1 Dr) of Sodium Bicarbonate (NaHC03) following eachmeal will receive Federal attention.THE ANTI-REFRIGERATOR MOVEMENT. 3. Be it known, that we, themembers of the Anti-RefrigeratorLeague, propose or jmean to prohibitthe use of refrigerators, as such instruments of shame will tend to harbor an unlawful beverage, commonlyknown as Home Brew. Thru the gallant efforts and co-operation of theSahara League we hope to accomplish our aim. If need be, we willtake legislative steps.THE ANTI-RECEPTACLE MOVEMENT 4. Be it known, that we, the members of the Anti-Receptacle League,A Delightful Home BrewWe kave at our Paint Store on South Main Street something whichmay be used in the most temperate homes with safety,, as there is "NoKick" whatever in the ingredients of which it is composed, and if afterusing one gallon of same as directed, no improvement can be seen, wewiU gladly refund your money. Since March first, past, we have s8ld totheod people of Bourbon County over Four Thousand, Five HundredGof this mixture, to be used at their homes, and so far have nothad a complaint. . .Come in and let us tell you about it.The Templin Paint and Roofing Co.Trv Our Composite RoofingNone Better; Few as Good(aprill-tf-T)"ggg;--fe'--Ajf4iM4f .-..rIn response ito the Inquiry of msqy telephonesubscribers: "What can I do to help my aervice?" this adrertiaemenjf j published.IThe Right WaySaves AnnoyancejrfierearetwowijfjoOil a telephone mustoes..The wrong way is to call from mexxtcrfifa "take a chance," to trust to luCk ijwl,your memory doesn't play a frfck on yonwith the fickle figures in a telephone nurtf jxx-The" right' way is to consult tfie TelW ipfione Directory before calling an3 maKtti jsure you have the right numbermie right way saves annoyance fo youfViff and to the persons you miglff EaVWcallerd fly mistake, K Helps Buiia up 9fiiriier graSe o?

Receptacles of larger capacity are also'classified as instruments of shame,and will assist as law violators, byacting as retainers for filthy HomeBrew andHome-Made Wine. Tlie receptacles that we are determined toeliminate, are as follows: Pint andquart bottles, t( glass) gallon bottlesand jugs, corks, pickle kegs, cooking utensils, wash tubs and boilers,watering troughs, cuspidors, garbagecans and barrels. The' eliminationof such receptacles will'tend to reduce the amount of Home Brewing.THE ifrTI-TEA AND COFFEEMOVEMENT5. Be it known, that we, the members of the Anti-Tea and CoffeeLeague, have resolved to start anAnti-Tea and Coffee crusade forpublic benefit and, welfare. We, themembers of this League, recommendthat the importation of tea and coffee be prohibited at once. Detailedanalysis of said tea and coffee by ourLeague Chemist, shows that tea contains (Tannin) and coffee contains(Caffeine.) Both these stimulantsare very destructive to the humanmind and body. After we, the members of the Anti-Tea and CoffeeLeague, have forced thru legislativechannels our cause, and are blessedwith the 'proper lawful authority,we, the members, will prohibit thesale of said injurious tea and coffee.We, the mejmbers, recommend thefollowing drinks as substitutes fortea and coffee. They are as follows:Parsnip tea, sassafras tea, beetpoddle, tansy tea (very good forchildren with worms.) Anti-chalkfrappe, buttermilk, sweet milk, postum, cherry flip, pineapple ade, andmany others too numerous to mention. The use of tea and coffee isjust a filthy habit and should be discontinued. THE-ANTI-SILO MOVEMENT6. Be it known, that we, theAnti-Silo Leagues, do favor the abolition of all silos, as our research andinformation received, thoroughlyconvinces us that corn and alfalfalaced in a silo, will within a shorttime start to ferment. In the SaharaCode, fermentation of any sort" is adirect violation of Sec. 13, Article B.V. D. of the U-Kant-Havit Law. Theensilage .contained within said silo,gives off injurious and intoxicatingalcohol, and the cattle that partakeof said ensilage, have been known tobe drunk (intoxicated.) We, themembers of the Anti-Silo League, docondemn silos and ensilage as a foodconstituent for cattle. We aim to protect the cattle, and prevent themfrom becoming addicted to the alcoholic evil.THE ANTI-TOBACCO MOVEMENT.7. Be it known, that we, the members of the Anti-Tobacco League, dosolemnly agree to do all we can, inthe campaign against the filthyweed, known as tobacco. Our LeagueChemist has analyzed tobacco and reports to us, that this filthy weed) contains a very injurious poison,known as (Nicotine), which is veryinjurious to the human mind andbody, It causes men to rob banks,holds up trains, disrespect law andorder. It also is the cause for gambling, insanity, illiteracy, desire foralcoholic beverages, and many otherevils that do not harmonize withtotal abstainers. Demon alcohol islisted with the dead, and we, themembers of this League, are fullyconviriced'Ftihat tobacco is the causeof 'the above-mentioned evils. Forexample, W will take "the Americanindian. Je used "tobacco long before the white man put foot onAmerican soil. By the continueduse of this poisonous weed, the greatAmerican Indian has nearly becomeextinct. JWe the members of thisLeague, will work constantly, feverishly, intelligently, and conscious ofonly one thought to eliminate this terrible weed. We, the members of tnisLeague, do recommend the' followingsubstitutes for tobacco chewers, asfollows: Licorice root, slippery elm,chewing gum, tar gum, cherry gum,paraffine gum, and rag weed (dried.)For the smokers we recommend tnefollowing: Corn silk, (dried), mullen; dried alfalfa leaves, dried onionleaves, arid a good grade of dried.cabbage leaves. The present generation may not smoke here, but theyate sure to smoke hereafter.THE BLUE-LAW MOVEMENT8. Be it known, that we themembers of the Blue-Law League, dopledge ourselves to bring about totalrecognition' of the, Sahbath, the seventh IBay'oi the week, observed bythe Jews as a day of rest, commenc-irP-from stunset on Saturday, andending siinsef on 'Sunday. We, themembers of ib.e Blue-Law League,will suftmit the following restrictionson Sunday activities: No shows,I base ball, fishing, bunting, auto-ria-ing; an aogs must De jmuzzieu vprevent them from barking; all catsmust be locked up; roosters not allowed to crow; passenger trains mustcease to 'functionate on this day;cooking and all other household duties must be arrested on this day;Kissing ana maKing love is prouiuited (this rule applies to married orsingle couples) if possible, birdsmust not be permitted to sing or fly;doctors, undertakers, druggists,police officers, firemen and all others performing emergency duties,must have a special- permit in orderto functionate. Said permit may bahad, by making application to theSecretary of the Blue-Law Leagus.A nominal fee will accompany eachannlication. Our motto is to haveall the "aBove restrictions enforced,even if we, the members of thisLeague, have to resort to drasticmeasures. We, the members of thisLeague, aim to have a good, clean,pure, moral Sabbath. If need be, wewill resort to legislation.To the, best of my ability, I havetried to outline the fundamentalprinciples of the various AntiLeagues, what they stand for, andtheir anticipation of a moral goal,through Federal and legislativechannels. -Yours Very Mbrrally,SAL HEUATICA, A.

Incidentally, itwill be especially interesting to thosewho follow current literary developments, to see how happily this brilliant writer has succeeded in introducing into his new novel the elements that will weld together hisseveral audiences the one that admired his earlier fiction; the vast audience that made best sellers of hiswar bookstand called one of them"The American Bible," and the recently added group that applaudedhim for his work under SecretaryHoover in behalf of the starvingchildren of Central Europe.It is the kind of story that playssoftly on the heart-strings. It is thestory of Tabs who comes back fromthe war to find the kingdom he hadbuilt up in his dreams slipping fromhim. But it is there for every manand woman, the kingdom round thecorner. When 'things look blackest,we may dream of it, for just onemore bend in the long road, and itmay be waiting for us the land ofj fulfilled dreams.This is the wholly charming anddelightful story of Tabs' search forjhis kingdom and how he found it.The book will be issued soon fromthe press of the Cosmopolitan BookCorporation, m New York, and willbe on sale at the book stores.-' ' , r " m,mmSBSlimiiM.-f1W V -- f1. recent invention is a clay phonograph needle, made from a darkred or chocolate-colored shale.MAN'SEST AGEA man. is as old as his organs ; hecan be as vigorous and healthy at70 a3 at 35 if he aids his organs inperforming their functions.
