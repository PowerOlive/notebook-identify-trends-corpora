Will Meet in Senate Committee Room The Loss WillFoot Up 200000Washington Nov 7 An explosionand fire at 518 Sunday afternoonwrecked the supreme court room andthe rooms immediately adjoining it onthe main floor of the capitol Thedamage is enormous The entire central eastern part of the great marblepile from the main floor to the subterranean basement practically is a massof ruins The force of the explosionwas so heavy that the coping stones onthe outer walls just east of the pointwhere the explosion occurred werebulged out nearly two inches windowsin all that part of the building wereblown out and locked doors wereforced from their hinges quite a 150feet from the scene of itFire followed the explosion so quickly as to seem practically simultaneouswith it The explosion shook the immense structure to its foundations andwas heard several squares from thecapitol It occurred in a small roomtightly enclosed by heavy stone wallain the subterranean basement immediately below the main entrance to theold capitol building In this room wasa 500 light gas meter which was fedby a four inch main Very littlegas is used in that part of thebuilding but at the time of the explosion the gaa had not been turned oflat the meter The meter itself waswrecked and the gas pouring from themain caught fire The flames originating from the explosion darted up theshaft of the elevator which had beencompletely destroyed by the force oithe explosion and communicatedwith the record room of the supremecourt the office of the marshal oithe court and the supreme courtlibrary Before the flames could besubdued the priceless documents in therecord room had been almost totallydestroyed and serious damage hadbeen done in the marshals office andsome minor rooms in the immediatevicinityThe library of the supreme court located immediately beneath the supreme courtroom was badly damagedby fire smoke and water practicallydestroying the great collection of lawreference books The library containsabout 20000 volumes and was used notonly by the justices of the supremecourt but by members of congress andlawyers practicing before the supremecourt Mr Justice Harlan said Sunday night that the library wasvery valuable Many of the works itcontained would he thought be difficult to replace Librarian Clarke aftera cursory examination necessarilymade by the light of lanterns expressed the opinion that many of the bookscould be saved although they hadbeen drenched by water from thestreams poured into the library fortwo hours or more after the explosionoccurredThe most serious damage in theopinion of the justices of the supremecourt is to the records stored in thesub basement These included all oithe records of the supreme court from1792 to 1832 The room contains recordsof cases and opinions rendered by thefathers of the judiciary of the government Apparently the documents inthis room are either totally destroyedor so badly damaged by fire and wateras to be uselessFortunately the clerks office was notin the least damaged by fire and the explosion did no damage in it except toblow out one windowThe supreme courtroom was damaged principally by water and smokethe fire not reaching that point Adjoining the courtroom however boththe marshals office and the senate barber shop furnished food for the flamesWhile many theories are offered asto the cause of the explosion it seemsbeyond doubt to have been dw to es2aping gasNo intelligent estimate of the moneyloss yet can be made In the opinionof capitol officials and mechanics whoexamined the structure Sunday nightthe loss will reach probably 200000 tothe building The loss on the libraryand records as stated above can bescarcely estimated in dollais and centsA million dollars could not replacethem because of many

he fed himself with hayAnd each separate beast was worth theprice to meUever clown was half so funny nevermonkey half so drollAll the tinsel was pure metal then to meEvery acrobat amazing every rider simply greatAnd that small trapeze man what a manwas heAnd when the woman sang We Partedby the RiversideAnd Youll Not Forget and Youll Remember MeShe was really so patheticThat I wiped my eyes and criedI wanted then to take her home with meThe shows we see in these days are neverhalf so fineThe cost of tickets often bothers meThough the man still cracks his whipAnd the clown seems pretty flipThere is nothing much I care to hear or seeThoughts of business taxes lasses rheumatism other crossesAll combine to make the circus seem quiteflatI no longer love the songstress with herpaint and frills and flossesI no longer want to take her home at thatBut Id like to see the old time show ofthirty years agoWhen I wore no pointed shoes my feetwere bareWhen lemonade was nectarAnd peanuts were

hedoesnt want to do it and merely putsforward his method as one possessing apurely academic interest At all eventsit is worthy of the attention of company promotersAll that has to be done as

done mainlyby stage and saddle There were a fewmain roads leading- for long distances-through woods and prairie but forthe most part the country was wildand uninhabitedFather at that time lived about 40miles from the present site of St Louisin a little frontier community calledfct liegis i believe the name has beenchanged since I havent been backthere for half a century Father wasstorekeeper and

himselfsanother thingThe news spread like wildfireihrough the little community thatburjy Tim Corrigan had been robbedof the mail Twelve or fifteen men andboys soon gathered at the store and aparty was made up headed by my father to ride back to the scene of therobbery and see if any trace of Timsdivil could be discovered Tim himself at first refused to go He was entirely demoralized by superstitiousfear But upon promise of a bodyguard and a safe place at the rear hefinally consented to be one of thepartjThe mail bag was found t the exact spot indicated by Corrigan rippedand rifled of allopen its valuable contents consisting of several packagesof value and inclosures of money Butoot the slightest tract of the thiefcould be discovered There were noprints of a horses hoof save those ofthe animal ridden by Corrigan himself Neither could a mans footprintsbe found nor a trail in the bushes beside the road An old Indian fighterin the party searched long and carefully but even his trained eye failedto discover a sign The affair was amystery and Tims theory of the agency of the evil one began covertly togain some groundThis strange highway robberyhowever wgs only the first of manyci a similar character which from thattime en amazed and terrified the pioneers throughout that section Thepaymaster of a lumbering gang wasmysteriously pounced upon and relieved of 500 in small bills A farmerf returning from the gristmill lost thelittle roll of money that representednearly all his seasons earnings x surveyor separated from the rest of hisfelt suddenly a death like gripabou his neck that tightened relentlessly until he lost consciousnessWhen he recovered he found his instrument his watch and his little storeof cash all gone It was getting to beas nrLch as a mans life was worth toventure alone into the woodsIn every case it was noted that themysterious assailant attacked onlysolitary victims and that he alwayspounced upon them silently fromabove and behind It was enough tomake a mans blood cold to reflect thatat any moment this mysterious creature man beast or devil might lighton his neck and choke shoot or stabthe life out of him As yet there wasno record of murder against the creature but who could tell what he mightdo if resisted or unduly provokedAfter three different mail carriershad been robbed the post office officialssent a detective to St Regis to lookInto the matter This man I remember was an object of the greatestwonder and admiration on the part ofcur entire community none of us everhaving seen a real live detective before He lodged with father duringhis stay in St Regis and thus I wasbrought into intimate association withhim The result of that intimacv Ithink I may say was what determinedmy choice of a profession in life ButI am digressing- or anticipatingThe detective scoured the woodsfor daj s at a time He lay in concealment at various points of the postroad between St Begis and the station en the river where the mail wasdelivered to the carrier He evenrisked carrying the mail himself a fewtimes but as he told me laughinglythe strain of that constant twist ofthe neck was too much for himSo long as the detective remainedin the vicinity there were no more robberies nor assaults The clever mandiscovered nothing positive but hepuzzled out a clew which he gave tofather for what it was worth when hewas obliged to leave on other businessThe clew was thisNear the spot where the surveyorhad been overpowered the detectivefound an eagles feather ost menwould not have given this slight circumstance a second thought But adetective is a man to whom everythingposseses significance My friend putI he feather in his pocket and ponderedever it He reflected that the approach of the bandit was always apparently through the air that hedropped silently down upon his victimfrom behind and above as a bird ofprey might do Was it not possiblethen putting two and two togetherthat the creature whatever it wasmight be something- in bird formI saw that my father was inclinedto smile at the suggestion when it wasmade to him but I treasured it in mymind for I could not help feelingsomehow that it came startlingly nearthe truthNo sooner was the detective gonethan I feii to working out his clew Tobe sure I was only a boy but I wasactive and inquisitive and very desirous of doing something toprove myself worthy of the detectives friendship Besides the post office authorities had offered a reward of 300 thawould lead to the discovery of theterious highwayman or 500 for hisactual capture Such an incentive asthis was enough to sharpen a boyswits as well as a mansThe thing for me to do I concludedwas to keep a sharp outlook for eaglesat all hours of the day With this purpose in mind I spent a large share ofmy leisure time on top of a cliff aboutthree miles from St Begis commanding a wide view of the valley in whichthe vallage layThe detective had been gone abouta week when one afternoon as I lavupon the cliff I saw a shadow sail overthe woods below me Looking up frommy place of concealment I beheld almost directly over my head the formot a great eagle outlinedsky It was sailiniragainstthentrn r v Xvvi a iiic i i iron-siaerable heicrht but IcouldSPP itplainly enough and there was something so odd about its appearance thatI was struck with amazement Oneither side of itsneck there hung downwhat looked like a black streamerThe effect was as if the bird werewearing a long muffler the ends ofwhich trailed below its breastThe eagle was drifting away fromme over the valley and its body for atime was between me and anythingthat migmt be clinging to its neckBut finally it made a turn and I coulddimly see although the distance wasnow too great for accurate observation with the naked eye a sort of excrescence on the birds back directlyover the trailing streamers How Ilonged for a good field glass or telescope I was almost wild with curiosity yet could do nothing but conjecture over the strange appearanceof the bird Of one thing I was almostpositive however and that was thatthe object which was now fading awayin the distance had been directly connected with every of the of the recentrobberiesThe very next day word reached usat St Begis of a murder and rcJoervthat had taken place in the next Township A trapper returning from thesetttlements with a considerable sumof money realized from the sale of hispelts had been attacked in the openroadway and having undoubtedly attempted to resist his insidious assailant had been fatally stabbed at thebase of the neck His money was goneand his body when discovered lay inthe road where it had fallen Therewas no evidence of a struggle no footprints other than those of the victimhimself but in the dust somebody hadfound and picked up another eaglesfeather Llenrned this fact incidentally and it settled in my mind the realnature of the unknown assailantFrom that day I never went intothe woods without my rifle for fatherhad given me a little rifle to use inhunting squirrels and wild turkeysMy thoughts dwelt constantly uponthe mysterious eagle and I was alvayson the lookout for the great birdWeeks passed Excitement wasrunning higher than ever over the uncanny bandit of the woods for bolderand more frequent assaults were constantly reported Quite a number ofsettlers had moved away from sheerterror and apprehension The statehad taken up the matter and increasedthe reward for the villains capture byanother 500 It was just after thishad been done that my odd adventurebefell meT had been cut after wild turkeysostensibly at any rate andi was coming home with an old gobbler slungover my back As I approached theroad I heard the thud of a horseshoofs aud as had been customary withme hurried forward to see the riderpass with a vague hope that the mysterious eagle might choose that verymoment to swoop down upon anothervictimA familiar proverb says it is the unexpected that happens But everyrule has its exceptions and everyproverb as well This time it was theexpected that happened I had a presentiment that I was about to beholdsomething- wonderful and strangeand I did had I come in sightof the horseman and there was stila thin concealing veil of foliage between me and the open road when agreatwavingalong theshadow came driftinghighway I glanced upand with mv heart in my mouthsaw a huge bird descending withset and motionless wings But Isaw something more something thatalmost froze the blood in my veins Aminiature man sat astride of theeagles neck his fierce little face setwith vindictive purpose To this dayI can see the baneful gleam of hissmall blazing eyes In one hand hecarried a glittering naked knife Theother hand was extended as if to graspin anticipation his victims hairWhen the eagle was almost direct-ly over ihe unsuspecting horsemanmotion as quick as thought my riflesprang to my shoulder Just as thedwarf let go his hold and dropped therewas a ringing report and the eaglepierced through the heart by my bullet fell simultaneously with his pigmymaster Both struck the flanks of thefrightened horse and the animalsprang forward in a wild snortinggallop so sudden and so endangeringto the rider that he did not even venopposite side of the road and disappearedHardly knowing what I did 1bounded after his disappearing formbut the sly creature was too quick forme In the tangled underbrush it wauseless to pursue a being who coulddart unobstructed along a rabbit pathand I soon gave up the chase as vainLeaving my wild turkey concealedin the bushes I carried the dead eagleto the village and told my story Atfirst there were none who would believe me but when I led the way tothe spot where the tragedy had occurred and the Indian fighter had examined the small footsteps in the dustand in the soft mud of a spring hole inthe woods where the dwarf had crossedin hig flight doubt and cavil gave wajto wonder and congratulation and 1became at once the hero of the

CollierAs might naturally be expected fromhis hazardous occupation the collieris frequently injured by accidents underground but the following particulars deserve I think a space inthe Lancet because of the strange series of fractures sustained by a manas well as the remarkable coincidencein the date of their occurrenceA man aged 44 years short and wellbuilt was first attended by me onAugust 20 1890 for a compound fracture of the left leg resulting from aportion of the roof or top falling andstriking him while following his employment in Risca collieries The patient made an uninterrupted recovery and was able in about six monthsto resume his work undergroundThe patients previous history toldby himself and corroborated by others is very remarkable With the exception of an attack of typhoid feverwhich he had when 18 years of ageand two or three attacks of quinsysubsequently he had not suffered bodily in any way He was always verytemperate and for about 18 years atotal abstainer But his misfortunesin the mine were many and are remarkable from the fact that they always happened on the 26th day ofAugust Here is his record At theage of ten years he fractured his rightindex finger It happened on August2G When 13 years old he fracturedhis left leg below the knee throughfalling from horseback also August26 At 14 years of age he fracturedboth bones of the left forearm bystumbling his arm striking the edgeof a brick August 26 In another yearon August 26 when 15 years of agehe had compound fracture of the lefsleg above the ankle by his foot beingcaught under an iron rod and his bodyfalling forward Next year aain onthe same date August 26 he had compound fracture of both legs the rightbeing so severely crushed that it hadto be amputated at the lower thirdof the thigh This was caused by ahorse hitched to a tram of coal whichrunning wild under ground caughthim in a narrow passage crushingboth legs severely After this he didnot work on August 26 for 2S yearsand little wowder but in the year 1890he forgot his fateful day and went towork with the result that he sustained the compound fracture whichI have mentioned in the beginningAfter this he has studiously avoidedworking on August 26 though nevermissing work at other times LondonLancetGold Coins in the WorldIt will probably be a shock to manyto learn that all the gold coins currentthroughout the world

GRIP ON SPAINTheRelations of tlie Two CountriesHave for Log Time HadPeculiaritiesEver since and even before the dayswhen the kings of 1rance and Spainmet on the Isle of Pheasants and madethe treaty of the Pyrenees one of thechief aims of tie French policy hasbeem to obtain influence and controlin Spain It was for this that Prancefought her two most bloody and alsomost unsuccessful wars The war withthe Spanish succession was chieflyfought out in Bavaria and the lowcountries but the object of Prancewas control in Spain Louis XIV infact defied the world and very nearly ruined his country by insisting onhis policy of controlling Spanish affairsIt was the same with XapoleonThough like Louis XIV he did nottry to annex any part of Spain afterthe manner of his annexation in Italyand Germany he knew how dangerous it is to spoil the face of a Spaniard yet he strained every nerve t oobtain the control of the Iberian peninsula aJid may indeed be said tohave maimed the empire by his determination to malce Spain apoliticalsatellite of France But for the peninsular war Napoleon might have escaped his final debacle But no soonerwas Napoleon finally overthrown andthe Bourbons reestablished than thescular desire to control Spain reaseerted itselfIn 1823 a French army crossed thePyrenees and occupied Madrid andfor the time France obtained completenscendancy in Spain The influencethus obtained had no doubt to giveaway to English pressure but it reappeared again with Louis Philippesscheme for the Spanish marriagesthe scheme which so nearly produceda war with England and seemed topromise so much for French influencein the peninsulaNapoleon III always exercised agreat deal of indirect influence inSpain and was careful to maintainthe old policy that of possessing whatAmericans call a pull on the government at Madrid It was indeedthe fear of losing French influencein Spain that nominally produced theFranco Prussian war The immediate cause of the war was a dispute asto the filling of the Spanish throneAfter the war France was for a timetoo busy to pay much attention toSpanish affairs but it was with asense of deep humiliation and disgustthat she learned that Alphonse XLThad visited Berlin had accepted thecolonelcy of a regiment of Uhlans andthat Spain was apparently slipping under the influence of the triple allianceImmediately tie French statesmensaw the error that had been madeand it became at once the avowed object of the French foreign office to doeverjthing that was possible to conciliate Spain and reestablish Frenchinfluence at Madrid Chance helpedand since then French influence overSpain has been steadily and zealouslybuilt up by every possible meansLondon SpectatorSILK MADE IN AMERICAMost of That Worn in the UnitedStates Is of Home Manufactureand of Good QualityMost of the silk worn by Americanwomen is manufactured in the UnitedStates said the silk buyer in a drygoods store The value of the manufactured silk imported from abroadduring the fiscal year ended June 301898 was 23523110 and during thecensus year of 1890 the value of thesilk of American manufacture was69154599 As during the decade from1880 to 1S90 the product of Americansilk mills doubled in value it is fairto say that in 1898 about 80 per centof the silk goods sold to Americanwomen is of home manufacture Ofthe silk imported from abroad nearlyone half 10842561 was made inBelgium while France with importsof 4434402 is a bad second withSwitzerland in third place from whichwe bought 3492734 worth Japansupplied 2061907 and China only135889 The reason for the small importation from the orient is that muchof their product goes to Europe to befinished before reaching the UnitedStateAmerican silks of certain gradesare just as good as those made abroadand a good many of them are betterIt was formerly necessary for shop rkeepers sometimes to pretend thatsilks made in America were importedbut it is becoming unnecessary nowadays as women realize

OwnAccountOne of the things that have been mosthelpful to me in the course of my life saidMr Clumsyby has been my lack of tatThis may seem like a contradiction but it isreally very simpleI have always fancied that I could attendto business for other people all right but Inever had any tact about my own that isabout my pergonal relations with people Ialways bungle them whenever 1 attempt todo anything Thus if I have a misunderstanding or difference with anybody aboutanything and I set about straightening itout I cant possibly do it except in one wayI have to go at it llat footed I havent anymore diplomacy than a stone image Andmoreover besides being clumsy about it Iam pretty sure to say too much to saythings that it isnt necessary to say Inother Avords I havent any tact at allAnd at first this Avas a great drawback tome But after awhile I made a discoverythat if I didnt exercise my tact I shouldntmake any mistakes by it and following thatcourse for a time I came to a realization ofthe fact that theres a great lot of thingsthat Ave run up against in life Avhich maybe irritating at the time that are hoAvevernot Avorth squabbling over at all Avhether aman s got tact or not and J Avas sure tomake a mess of these things if I tried to doanything about them Avhy I dont try Isimply let em goAnd thats Avhat FTe been doing noA foryears not bothering about every little triflebut letting the little things go and not bothering about em at all paying no attentionto them Avhatsoever And so I have beenenabled to preserve mv eouanimitv andavoid all useless Avear and tear and thus
