Aftor the compromise was effected Superintendent Hamlett agreed topay to the Paris school the proportionof the school fund per caDita on thebasis of the census o'f 1908."Alleged irregularities on the part ofthe census taken several months agoresulted in an investigation by Superintendent Hamlett, who sent two inspectors heie to go over the censusbooks. It was alleged m the report ofthe inspectors to the State Superintendent that there were evidences ofthe census being padded and goingover the books five hundred nameswere stricken from the lists.The cause of the action of Superintendent Hamlet was the result of theabnormal census which showed a largeroer cent of any town in the State withthe exception of Covington andprompted the investigation. ActingUDon the report of the inspectorsSupetintendept Hamlet refused to payto the Paris schools its proportion ofthe school fund """unless the Board ofEducation would argee to reduce thecensus to a per cent compared withthe population of the city.The school board declined to acceptthe proposition of the State Superintendent and through their attorneysTalbott & -Whitley, of this city entereda mandamus suit to cumpel the payment of the school fund per capita.By the terms of the compromise 314names were marked from the censusreport as of 1912, which with 199names supplemented, brings ihe totalnumber of children of the school age inParis to 1,938.An agreed judgment was entered andthe school board agreed to appoint acensus enumerator this spring to takethe census ana who will be approvedby the suDerintendent.

These fifty warriors have not indulged in any of the preliminaries that inthe old days marked the beginning ofan uprising. They have danced no wardances orghost dances, nor have theydaubed themselves with war paint.They have not even taken the warpathin the sense of inaugurating an offensive campaign. Nor has their actionawakened any particular m anxietyamong their white neighbors. Insteadot being looked upon as hostiles to be'seriously areaded, they are only ordinary lawbreakers, acting upon the defensive and likely soon 10 recret theirprecipitancy.At the most such an incident merelyserves to show how far we have traveled from the old frontier days, whe'nthe Indian uprising was a very realand terrible menace to "the white people'of a sparsely settled country. Arpal Indian .uprising would not be actuallyJmpoasibletoday, but its occurence can safely be recarded as entirely improbable. This has come aboutnot so much because of a markedchange in the Indian's charcter, as because his opportunities for that kindof mischief have been greatly lestricted. Once upon a time he had thepower to make trouble for UncleSam's cavalrymen ; today if he showssymptoms of turbulence the police arelikely to run him in with promptnessand disnatch.Parental Problems.Where a whipping may improveone boy it will create a grudge and athirst for revenge in another.

The DanvilleCommercial Ciub, the MiddlesboroCommercial Club and the Mt. VernonClub will join hands in the effort. Theoriginal, wilderness road extended fromthe Tennessee border via CumberlandGap, Middlesboro, Mt.

Go on none of us willinterfere you wait on him!"Mebbe he's a millionaire. Thatwould be fine for Susie. "Nobody canact more like a lady than she can,only she's got her hair too light.
