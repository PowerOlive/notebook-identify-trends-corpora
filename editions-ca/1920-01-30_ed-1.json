death was. the victor and carried him
to an untimely and premature grave.

the grocery business in this city,
but his health giving way, he went
West and located for a time in Col
orado, where Ws health improved
for a while. Returning to Paris
the disease again manifested itself
?nd the end came Tuesday. He was
a (manly young fellow, and everyone
who knew "Boh" Delaney, liked
him.
The funeral was held at his late
home, on Eighth street, yesterday
afternoon, at 2:30 o'clock, wjth ser
vices conducted by Rov. C. H.
Grear. pastor of the Methodist
church. The burial followed on the
family lot in the Paris Cemetery.
The pall-bearers were: A. B. Lovell,
C. P. Cook, C. H. McDaniel, John J.
Connell, Wm. S. Dale, Frank Burton.
Mr. Delaney is survived by his
parents, Mr. and Mrs. J. Ed. Dela
iiey, five brothers, Jajais. Virgil,
Henry, Edward and Will Delaney.
nd one sister, Miss Lillian Delaney,
all of this city.
