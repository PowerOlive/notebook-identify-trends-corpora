She seized a heavypoker standing near the fireplace,md cautiously opened the dooi between the room and the kitchen,spied the figure of a man in a stooping position. Without demandingan explanation of. the man's presence ui the house, she began to layabout his person in a most vigorousmanner with the heavy poker,causing him to scream with painand to beat a hasty retreat. Just ashe escaped from the house. Hargueentered at the front door. And thatis where his surprise came in. Thewoman looked hastily up and exclaimed: "My goodness, Bill!

Idon't, however, regard that story asmy own work. 'The Two Gentlemenof Kentucky' is rather a siudy, asketch, than a short story; but Ithink that holds perhaps as (much ofthe general motive and spirit of myBluegrass work as "any of-The talescomprised in 'Flute ard Violin.'"It is pleasant intelligence to methat the Paris Club is to bestow athought, a smile, a frown, a toar, onmy stories, or if none of these, thenat least a rcquiescat."The old-time rural life in Kentucky abides with me a a greatteeming canvas of unique beauty,chanm, tenderness.

COURT HOUSE- tiPJiissosaBourbon LaundryDAVIS & FUNK, ProprietorsTelephone No. 4These Whe Think of Going Are Advised to Be Sure of Quarters Before Starting 2,000,000 ArePlanning te Make Trip.New York. Americans who contemplate visiting the battlefields in Europe next spring or summer will bewell advised to secure their hotel accommodation well in advance or topostpone their journey until conditionsare more favorable. Percy S. Bullen,treasurer of the Association of Foreign Press Representatives in the United States, who has just returned toNew York, says that London even nowcannot find room for visitors and thatthe state of affairs when the floodgatesof tourist invasion are again open willbe appalling unless the intendingAmerican visitors are forewarned andtherefore forearmed.It is estimated that some 2,000,000persons one for each man sent toEurope by the United States duringthe war are making plans for atransatlantic trip in the next twoyears. Their chief object is to seethe historic spots where the Americansoldiers fought the Argonne forest,Chateau-Thierry, St. Mlhlel and todevote such a period to a visit to England as time and funds will permit.Mr. Bullen has been all over thewestern front during the last fewweeks and he predicts nothing butanger, irritation and despair as thelot of any visitors who trust to luckto secure hotel accommodations.No Steps Yet Taken.The difficulty of the situation willbe realized when it is rememberedthat the usual flow of tourists toEurope has been completely suspended during the war and that only thoseamong the wealthiest will have thefirst chance of securing hotel accommodation when the bars against tourist travel shall have been removed.So far no steps whatsoever havebeen taken abroad to meet an unusualinflux of visitors. Mr. Bullen was soimpressed with the difficulty threatened in London that he prepared amemorandum on the subject, which hesubmitted at n recent meeting of theRoyal Colonial institute in London. Inthe discussion which ensued it wasproposed that steps be taken for$heformation in London of a nationalcommittee of reception. Aa a nucleusof the organization it was proposedthat representatives of the variousAnglo-American societies should meet,with power to add to their numbervarious representatives whose experience would be useful in solving theproblem now presented. Such personswould include members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Londonand other Americans, besides leadingBritishers.Plan Suggested. .The first essential step is to mobilize and list all available accommodation provided by hotels and boarding houses, and then enlist the assistance of every householder willing toplace a room at the disposal of thecommittee of reception. If this planmatures London will keep in touchwith New York on the question of accommodations and people in the United States will be advised as to thebest time to travel and the chances ofsecuring accommodation at reasonablerates. At the time Mr. Bullen left Liverpool nothing actually had been doneexcept to call attention to the problem and the dissatisfaction which willensue if American visitors to Englandand France next year find themselvesabsolutely -stranded, as is threatened.Belgium is apparently well able totake care of visitors to the Belgianbattlefields, mainly because Ypres,Dixmude and the much battered coastlowns are all within easy range ofOstend, Bruges and Ghent. Of all thebattlefields visited. Mr. Bullen declares Ypres is the "most devastated,"but, with its memories of heroic fighting extending from Ypres down theMennen and Poelcappelle roads, "isbeautiful in its ruins." ' Ostend isprobably the best center for automobile parties, and the burgomaster ofOstend is one of the few men preparing to deal with an unexampled demand for hotel accommodations.1iBBBBi C' tot f" IBfltM Wmmmmmf BBSBBBBZ. -".miWest Fifh Streetftk.: r;tc niTinrinTinu sejOHIIDrAMlUN!OUR WATCHWORD! 1With all the latest improvements in laundry appliancesand expert helpers we areprepared to do work inferior to none, and solicityour patronage.'
