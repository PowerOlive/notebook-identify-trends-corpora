THT BALD EAGLE AT HOME
He i Iiooses a High Tree For Hia Of
fensive Nest
An old friend met us He first showed
as a black spot far up on the shore
then drifted grandly down upon set
pinions tacking in and out like a
yacht working to windward It hap
pened he was slanting shoreward when
he passed and at 40 yards his snowy
head and tail broad brown fans
6hoved to fine advantage We could
see the polished yellow of his hooked
bill and the fierce flash of his marvel
ous golden telescopic eye as he turned
it upon us and then back to his tireless
searching of the water and the wave
line along shore
For years this eagle hoary old beach
comber as he is has patrolled the shore
daily for miles seeking what the
waters have cast up for be it known
he is not above accepting even carrion
Many a dead fish and lost bTrd he gets
for the trouble of picking them up but
he can hunt too when he feels so dis
posed Season after season he and his
mate have patched the old nest and
reared their eagles in peace
No one can climb the tree and no
decent man would shoot at the birds
Should you visit the foot of the tree
your nose will be assailed by a most
objectionable odor and your naturally
brief inspection will convince you that
the eagles do hunt more than they are
given credit for Everywhere are frag
ments of fish while among them are
wings and tails which must have be
longed to grouse portions of hares and
other fragments suspiciously like cer
tain parts of lambs sucking pijxs and
domestic fowls But they were not our
lambs pis or fowls and so no shot
whistles after the old pirate who
scones to understand that he is free to
buccaneer to his hearts content Ed

GESTICULATING TALKERS
Italians Wnve Arms Wildly When
Conversins AVith One Another
The farther south one goes in Europe
the more do the people gesticulate in
conversation asserts a traveler who is
at present doing Italy
A Neapolitan he says goes through
an entire course of calisthenics before
he has talked five minutes Give a
Neapolitan a pair of dumb bells and
ask him what he thinks of the weather
and before he finishes his answer he
will have taken enough healthful exer
cise to last him all day
This traveler spent many an interest
ing hour in watching the Neapolitan
talk One day in a cafe he sat next to
a couple of Italians who were engaged
In a most spirited conversation The
younger of the two men grow very
excited With his hands he made
reaching and clinging motions as if
climbing Then he reached right and
left above his head as one would do in
picking cherries Then without slack
ening his remarkable flow of conversa
tion he put the thumb and first finger
of his left hand together and held them
a few inches before his eyes and went
through the careful movements of one
threading a small needle And all the
time he talked Next he made overhand
motions as of throwing Then he gave
an imitation of some one swimming
After that he described several rapid
circles with his left hand which gave
the impression of a revolving wheel
Then he leaned forward and with his
right hand lifted acted as a person
would act in trying to put a key into
a keyhole The writer asked his friend
who understood Italian what all the
fuss was about
Theyre talking chiefly about the
weather was the reply London
Mail
His Brogue Saved Him
The thiclmess of his brogue secured
for a recent arrival from the Emerald
Isle a ride of several hundred miles at
the expense of the Pennsylvania rail
road His destination was Boston
and at the Broad street station he
asked for a ticket to the Hub The
ticket seller was unable to determine
whether it was Boston or Washington
the man wanted to reach but finally
sold him a ticket for the latter city and
a few hours later he found himself in
the national capital As he was unable
to read the mistake was not discovered
until he reached Washington and to
complicate matters he had not suffi
cient funds to purchase a ticket to
Boston
Pie presented his case to the railroad
officials at Washington and they put
ting him to a test were unable to dis
tinguish from his pronunciation of
Washington and Boston any material
difference thus exonerating the clerk
at the Broad street station in this city
for his error The facts of the case
being laid before the general passen
ger department the man with the
brogue was forwarded to his proper
destination Philadelphia Record
