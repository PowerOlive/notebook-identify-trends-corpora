ed. Blaze was discovered in the roof

1:00 a. m. Wednesday, and had it not
been for the timely discovery, the

destroyed. It is supposed to have
caught from a spark from the kitchen

smouldering for more tnan an nour, as
the fire in the kitchen stove was out
lonf before it was discovered. The
damage is but slight.

SONQRA STRONG FOR BECKHAM
SONORA, KY., June 11. The an
nouncement that Mr. J. C. W. Beck
ham would speak here in the interest
of his candidacy for the United States
Senate was received with great ap
proval. Mr. Beckham has always been
a prime favorite with the -voters of
this vicinity, and in the coming elec
tion he numbers many supporters who
have formerly opposed him, but will
vote for him to rebuke the action of
the four treacherous Legislators of
1908 who elected Senator Bradley
Sonora is in a very strong "dry" sec
tion, and they are lining up solidly
behind him'in the present race.
BECKHAM GETS OVATION.
FRANKFORT, June 11.- Gov Beck
ham returned Sunday from a week's
trii through Eeastern Kentucky. He
left again Monday for Carrollton and
other poinas along the Ohio River.
He will be gone a week. The recep
tion he received in Eastern Kentucky
is said to have eclipsed any previous
political campaign on record. Great
crowds greeted him at all his appoint
ments, and at each station along the
route crowds gathered to assure him
of their support in his race.
It was a great ovation from the time
he left home until nis return. With
the great development of this section
of Kentucky came more voters, and
happily a great number are Demo
crats, who will cast their vote in
this State in August. It is said a big
majority of them are supporting Mr.
Beckham. During his recent visit
there he was told of this fact. Many
miners called to See him and said
their first vote in Kentucky would be
for him. It is said the mining vote is
almost solid for the ex-Governor, not
withstanding the fact Mr. Stanley
claims he has this vote under his
thumb and can do with it as he
pleases. According to reports receiv
ed here there was quite a contrast in
the reception given Mr. Stanley in
Eastern Kentucky and that given
Gov. Beckham. It is said Mr. Stan
ley aroused little enthusiasm and was
greeted with small audiences.
(Continued from Page-1.)
present questionable political allian
ces, have inaugurated a campaign
for the formation of a Scott County
Thomas Club, with the pledge of giv
ing their support to Mr. Thomas, who
they believe truly represents their
views on this vital question.
"From present indications it looks
as if the luor -question will be the
dividing line in this county; although
there are many Democrats here who
have not heretofore been aligned
with the temperance element of the
party who will cast their vote agains
Mr. Cantrlll because of his question
able alliances with Postmaster Sin
clair and other Republicans. To
make this feeling stronger it is no
ticed that a number of Mr. Gantrill's
most active friends here now are
Democrats who declined to sign the
petition to have Mr. Sinclair re
moved. "While the fight in Scott County
will be waged in the open there is a
disposition to eliminate entirely any
and all matters of a personal nature
regarding the candidates." George

HERE'S A REAL CASE
OF IVORY HEAD.
John Smith, aged thirty years, a ne
gro employed on the L. & N. con
struction camp, near this city, became
drowsy while walking the track near
Gerdra (formerly Bedford) Station, on
the Winchester division, and lay down,
on the rail to take a nap. The com
ing and going of trains was a matter
of indifference to John, and present
necessity of a sleeping place a matter
of choice. Thirty minutes after John
had lapsed into slumberland a freight
engine smote the sleeper's pate and
a freight engineer looked out expect
ing to see a dead and mangled body.
John sleepily awoke, rubbed a bruised
place on his ivory head, and calmly
proceeded on his way. Dr. Daugherty
pronounced him "a genuine bone
head."
