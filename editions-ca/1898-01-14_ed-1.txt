nights4 storm here and scoresof dead and wounded are being draggedfrom the ruins of wrecked buildingsand throngs of people are searchingfor the dead and consternation anguish and despair is plainly read inthe blanched faces of all It isthought many more dead bodieswill be found and the list of deadmay reach 50 or more The greatestloss was between Eighth street andthe Catholic church and it is said thatnot a building is left standing Several brick buildings at Ninth and Garrison avenues were crushed like eggshells and as the second stories wereused for living purposes it is thoughtthat there will be found the greatestnumber of dead But little effort hasbeen made to search the ruins of theresidence portion of the city that wasin the storms path In additionto the horrors of crashing buildingsthe roar of the storm and the cries ofthe wounded fire broke out in a number of places and the department wasunable to cope with the new danger andit is known that one or more bodieswere cremated The handsome highschool building just finished at a costof 100000 was leveled to theground besides one or twofine churches The storm came upsuddenly from the southwest strikingthe city at 1115 oclock p m and inalmost the twinkling of an eye a largeportion of the city was in ruins Every physician in the city was summoned and all are now busy at workdressing the wounds and binding thebroken limbsAt 11 a m Wednesday it looked asthough 50 persons had been killed andthe death list was growing hourlyHundreds of persons have been injured some fatally and others badlyThe damage to property will run intothe thousands of dollars as many fineresidences were razed to the groundOwing to the fact that the tornadoafter passing through the residencedistrict did its worstwork in that portion of the business district in whichthe older buildings were locatedthe total of damage done does notamount up very rapidly althoughmany buildings were partially orwholly ruined For this reason it isprobable the sum of 500000 will coverthe loss to the buildings and contentsincluding the new 50000 high schoolbuilding which was directly in thepath of the storm and was badly wrecked The debris of many of the buildings which were in the lodging housedistrict caught fire and those unfortunates who were not at once extricated perished by being smothered todeathAdd to the fact that many of thepeople in the outside district werekilled in the crash of the falling residences and it will be seen how the listof dead rolled up so rapidly Allhouses that can be pressed into serviceare being utilized and there are scoresin temporary hospitals through theditionvtoJbheii xegulahospiMnenWaleiThe morgue is taxed to its utmostcapacity and additional bodiesare being brought- in every few minutes Altogether the scene at thisplace is sickening and horrible Aheavy rain followed the terrible tornado and it was probably 20 minutesbefore the city awoke to the fact thatit had been visited by a fearful calamity The fire department was called out and in less than 30 minutes Garrison avenue especially in the vicinityof the wreck was crowded withpie and willing hands and inquiringfriends were willing to render all theaid that the emergency required Thescene in that neighborhood of thewrecked city was horribleMen and women clad in their nightclothes from the neighboring houseswere seeking shelter and calling foraid for some absent member of thefamily or friends who failed to escapefrom the wreckage of the buildings inwhich they had been living Menwomen and children sought refuge inOKeefes saloon and were affordedshelter In the back part of the saloona number of the injured were stretchedout on the floor with only their nightclothes to protect them from the chillycondition of the night airMiss Wood one of the nurses fromSt Johns hospital was on the sceneand did all that could be done to relieve the immediate wants of the injured in the rear of OKeefes saloonThe drug stores were opened and theclerks were kept busy filling prescriptions and othewise doing their sharetoward relieving the sufferers Thetelephone wires were nearly all downand it was impossible to communicate to any distant point in theoutskirts of the city The streets wereso filled with the debris blown fromthe wrecked buildings that it was withdifficulty that carriages could getaroundThe tornado crossed the Poteau riverand swept through the National cemetery laying low the walls and demolishing the residence of R G BaldwinIts path was about two hundred yardswide and for that distance across

Mr Teller branded the publication as an insult to the advocatesOf the free coinage of silver Hewas satisfied that the president and SecretarjGage were in full accord upon the financialquestion He attacked the republican partjbecause it was a party advocating the goldstandard and expressed his intention of doingall in his power to defeat the party in 100 andto drag the present administration

watched Burlingtons impassive features I am nophysiognomist but unless my experience was entirely at fault this manhad the head of neither a criminal nor amaniac The brows were narrow but- loftyfhe mouth was beautifully modA eledbue disfigured by deepT hnes run jnmg from nostril to jawbone Hishands were the next to attract my attention and again I marveled at thecurious concatenation of circumstanceswhich had warped a nature unquestionably designed for good rather than evilpurposes Perhaps the fact that Nancysfather was the object of mjr examination perverted my judgment but sitting there in the dimlj lit room withthe lullaby of the Pacific in mj ears Icame to the amazing conclusion thatBurlington was guiltless of the murderof Perkins that his wife had been thevictim of circumstantial evidence thatGerard had fallen a prey to his naturalpusillanimity Then I suddenlj bethought me of the telegrams and myimagination wiltedAs my eyes still rested upon thesinewy hands with their strong spatulate fingers Burlington addressed meby name His voice was much strongerand the intonation clear indicating anunclouded brainAre we alone he asked not moving his headYea said I but dont talkI must he replied impatientlyIve f ocussed all my strength for thatvery purpose I want to see Mrs Gerard to morrowHe was certainly mad I decided andmust be humoredYes yes I murmured soothinglyof course you shall see Mrs GerardI dont know what the devil youmean by of course he said irritablyThere are serious difficulties in thewaj She was once my wife the verylight of my eyes And she left meme I noted the accent of pride forthat slave of Plutus Mark Gerard Ilet her go d n her without a wordBut she is not anxious to see me againIll warrantI was too astonished to replyI may have to employ- you he continued calmly as a go between MarkGerard is welcome to m wife but thegirl is mine and I want herNanc3r I gaspedIs that her name said he -Yesshes mine I claim the girlHe spoke so

T daresay I was jealous of ojther men Gerardin particular but that was a proof oflove I worked like a slave for thatwoman worked till my health brokedown and then just when needed hermost she deserted

ejes and within five minutes waspeacefully asleep I iresumed my placebj his side and tried to muster mj rampant thoughts Aeolus wrestling withhis turbulent winds had a lighter taskOutside the moon and stars were obscured by fog which had rolled in fromthe ocean thick and dank with thespume of the sea blotting from m viewthe shimmering waters and banishingthe grateful breeze One might scarcely

the attacknervesof the Greek I had dropped upon oneknee between the door and tine bedand in my right hand was the smallpistol which I always carried on myperson But a pistol is the least efficient weapon in such a fight as thisWhat would I have given for a doublebarreled shotgun a good sabre or aknife If I fired in the dark the flashof the powder would prove a death warrant the same grim logic applied tothe striking of a match I was satisfiedthat such a master scoundrel as Demetrius had laid his plans with extraordinary sagacity He was taking desperate chances but the crisis justifiedthem These rooms were cut off fromthe rest of the house and nothing shortof a pistol shot would arouse Gerardand the servants Demetrius must havecounted upon the moon as an allyFrom the darkness of Marks room hemight have approached me unseen andunheard and then a bold thrust of aknife would rid him of the man whohad dared to unmask his villainy Butthe fickle moon had played him falseHe probably like me was nowupon the defensive Who would movefirstI finally decided to take the initiativefor the suspense was intolerableDemetrius I reflected was stiff in thejoints his muscles less supple thanmine his sense of hearing less acuteYouth was on my side experience onhis The two players in the game wereat least fairlv matchedHad it not been for Burlington I couldhave easily escaped b the window

garments arecarefully starched They are not simplywrung out in starch unless a slightstiffness is desirable and a very thinstarch is used Whenever it is desirableto give much stiffness as it is to a shirtbosom or pique skirt the starch isrubbed into the goods on the outsideThis is done by stretching the goodson a board and rubbing the hot starchover it until it penetrates to the back ofthe piece being starched and the clothhas absorbed all the starch it willAfter it is accomplished wipe off all thesurplus starch on the outside and hangup the article starched in a hot roomwhereit will dry as rapidly as possibleThe more rapid the process of dryingthe more successful the starchingWhen the starched article is perfectlydampen it or follow the process ofsome of the best ironers andi dampen itas you iron it Practiced ironers use avery hbtiron one that would be certainto scorch were not the surface repeatedly cooled by being dipped an instantin cold water This roughens the ironin time arid a good laundress prefers aniron after it has become roughenedThe average laundry worker in households is too slow and therefore shecannot use as hot an iron as her workrequires orfehe would

Ahle to Continue Using theSame Brand of TohaccoA nervous man dashed into a largetobacco store down town the other dayand said to the proprietorLook here Billy Ive been buyingsmoking tobacco from you for a longtime and no sooner do I find a brandthat suits me than you begin to adulterate it and it doesnt taste as it didThis blank brandl which I have beensmoking for four anoniths now has goneall to pieces I want something newWhy not try the tobacco you liked sowell before you took up this brandasked the proprietor It has been improved arnd I think that you will enjoy itThe nervous man accepted it andwe nit outHesjyvull comean inabautthEeeAdaysoranotherboxof sthawtobaccoandtell me that it is just what he has4beenlooking for remarked the proprietorto another customer He will smokeit for

began selling them and he buysnearly the same brand His taste intobacco has -not changed but he is anexception It ds a fact though fewsmokers realize it that a man needfechange in his tobacco just as much asin his food 2so man would enjoy thesame dinner day after day Few mencan smoke the same brand of cigarsor smoking tobacco month after monthwithout having it pall on their taste attimes This man who was in here a momemt ago thinks that the tobacco itselfchanges He considers himself a judgeof tobacco and I humor him by seemingto egree with Ihim and give him anotherbrand when he complains N Y

thehousekeeping school that meets everySaturday morning at the Silver Starkindergarten It shows Uhat the societygirls of the city have been well trainedin tihe practical and have not beenformed merely for the tinsel of lifeA number of years ago several youngladies of the fashionable circle agreedto devote Saturday morning to aidingthe neglected little ones in a purelypractical way They determined to select a portion of the cdty where the children have few opportunitiesJSnd wherelife means for thesm one hard struggleIt was the young girls living in the locality of the Silver Star kindergartenthat these ambitious society women decided to aid The kindergarten itself iscomposed of poor little tots who rarelyhave new frocks and boots and the old-er sisters of these infants were the fortunate ones chosen for lessons inQaousekeepingThe instructresses decided to take noone younger than five years of age forbhey realized that a girl must attain thatnumber of years in order to grasp the ifirst rudiments of housekeeping Girhywho must make their own way in the Iworld as housemaids or seamstressescannot begin too soonThe teachers had no difficulty in projcuring girls who desired to be instructed because it was sugar coated laborthev were offered There is no irreaterpunishment to a young girl than to askher to care for her room or bed andyeftishe will spend hours laboring with herdolls their beds and m sweeping andjdusting toy houses Girls who would be-horrified if their mothers suggestedthat they waslh the dishes will assiduously wash dolls china and feel no fatigue tTThese young ladies understood this4and so thev worked accordingly Mbrilliant idea came they would usedolls utensils - 1So the children in the neighborhoodwho had difficulty in procuring evenboots or frocks not even to considertoys thought it the jolliest sort of fun tpgo up to the Silver Star building andVplay with dolls and dishes and weebrooms just like the grown peopleGirls it is said only abandon their dollsbecause they are ashamed to play withthem when women They were delighted with the quantities of toys theywere permitted to play with the entireforenoon bv the sweet faced strangelyoung ladies EThe children began by learning tdmake beds and at first were giventhe dearest miniature bedsteads withtoy sheets covers and pillowsOne of the most useful tasks taughtis that of

theinhabitants of Switzerland consist ofthree different races with different languages and religious creedsA society now existing in Genevawith branches in other towns has muchthe same spirit and aims as a nationalcouncil It is called lUnion desFemmes and has taken up the questionof womens wages of cooperative storesof technical education of dress reformand womans moral elevation Connected with

continuation of theprocess which if favorably judgedwill lead eventually to the canonizationof the French heroine Although theproceedings are very complicated andlong Leo XILT has expressed a greatdesire that the preliminaries may behastened so that the function shall takeplace during his pontificate and as itwere seal the good relations betweenFrance and the holy seeShould the wish of the pope be gratified it will be the fourth ceremony ofcanonization that has taken place whilehe has occupied the chair of St Peterthe three former having occurred in18S1 18S8 and the last in May of thisj

we shall soonknow what are the miracles to be discussed and judged in the Congregationof Bites which had to examine and de-cideon the heroism of the virtues andon the authenticity of the miraclesTwo miracles are sufficient for beatification but to become a saint and beraised to the honor of worship moreare necessaryWhen the Congregation of Bittsfounded by Sixtus V is not convinc edof the exactness or trustworthiness ofthe results of the bishopric processnew inquiries and sometimes newprocesses are ordered These inquiries not continued foryears sometimes they go on for centmries When at last the congregationhas no more objections to make thepope gathers together all the cardinaland bishops in Borne and asks merelyas a formality if no further obstaclesprevent the canonization Oning

illustrating someof the perils of gunnery at seaI came very near going np into theair in small bits on this last squadroncruise We were at heavy gun practiceat sea and but for the quickness of agunners mate would never have returned As you probably know theheavy gxms in the turrets are fired byelectricity the gun being dischargedsimply by pressing a button The officerin command of the forward turret onour ship during rapid firing practice wasjust about to press the button to fire oneof our big guns when a gunners matewas seen to grab at something on thewall of the turret and then fall in aheap on the floor The officer pressedthe button but the gun was not discharged When the mate came to hevas asked what had happened and heinformed the officer thai the breech ofthe gun had not been locked and thatwhat he grabbed at on the wall was thewires forming the electrie firing circuitWhen he saw that the officer was preparing to fire the gun and at the sametime observed that the breech of thegun was not locked the only thing thatoccurred to him to prevent the gun being discharged was to destroy the circuit which he did promptly and effectively When all this occurred therewas a charge of 250 pounds of powderin the gnu another charge of the samesize in the turret ready to be served andthe passageway leading to the powdermagazine was wide open But for thequickness of the gunners mate the gunwould have been blown out inside theturret the gases from the burning powder would probably have ignited thecharge lying in the turret this explosion would have ignited the powder inthe magazine and the chances are thatthe whole ship crew and all wouldhave gone up in the air A thought thathas occurred to me is this Suppose theaccident had occurred what do youimagine the verdict of a board of inquiry as to the cause of the loss of theship would have been Since his experience the department has adopted electrical means to prevent the discharge ofany of the large guns until the

of mud but the impression is erroneous for the Missouri rivers water ispurer than the water of any great riverin the country the Platte alone excepted It is true that when a bucketful ofit is dipped up it appears to be dirtybut if the water is left until it settles itwill be found that the sediment at theibottom is fine dark colored sand andnot mud The Missouri rivers water isnever muddy save during the springhigh waterColonel Bill Switzler of BoonvilleMo declares that the general idea thatMissouri means big muddy or muddy water is wrong He says and Colonel Bill Switzler is an authority- thatit means wooden canoe The namehe says belongs to the Illinois dialectof the Algonquin Indians The nameMissuris or Missouri was applied by theIndians of the upper lake region to thetribe of Indians living west of the Mississippi river oecauso tne latter useawooden canoes instead of birch barkcanoesWooden canoes had to be used on theMissouri river because it was too turbulent for the frail birch bark canoes andin this way the big river secured itsname But no matter whether Missourimeans muddy water or woodencanoe the fact remains that Missouririver water is not muddy It does notflow through mud but through finesand The Mississippi river water is 100per cent dirtier than the Missouri butpoets have raved about the beautifulblue of the Father of Waters -OmahaWorld HeraldTennysons SlipLord
