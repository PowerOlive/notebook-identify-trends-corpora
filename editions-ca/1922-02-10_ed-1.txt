Mr. Barkerwould not make public the name ofthe concern nor give any informationas to the amount of tobacco sold orthe price realized."We have sold a considerableamount of association tobacco," hesaid, "to one of the largest of the independent manufacturers, but that isall I can tell you about it. It wouldnot surprise me any to have to makeannouncement of half a-dozen suchsales, within the next few days. AndI hope we do."James N. Kehoe, of the executivecommittee, said that other sales werein immediate prospect, according toinformation given him. Mr. Kehoesaid the tobacco crop over the burleydistrict generally was proving ofmuch better quality than that delivered to the association in Lexingtonso far or that sold over the loose leaffloors."There seems to me little probability," he said, "that we shall have to; hold any considerable portion of theassociation crop for longer than a fewweeks at the most. The Burley" To-bacco Growers Cooperative Associaition, as Mr. Stone made clear in hisstatement, is not a holding but a selling concern. I think what has already taken place indicates that themanufacturers intend to buy the 1921crop within a short time and at a fairprice to the growers."ValuesParis, Kv.Phone! 80&;y4!:iu3l Ztf is-Xl&.JeSr-'S'iahr r.-&"i ;vv -v' 'iKh;; l--:-". v - -J " - - - Mar t..Jr -- , -"""yL&-fv v-vlV--KPAGE TWOTHEJAMES STAFFORD; IS PICTURE OF$-FINE HEALTHEDffORIALFLINGSThought For The DayJust a cheery word or twoChanges skies of gray to blueJust a glad hello that's- flungTo the people, old or young,Sends them on their busy wayGained Fifteen Pounds Taking Tanlac, and Never Felt Better In His Happier for all the day.-Xife, Declares Terre Haute Han.After Effects of "Fin" Are Overcomewand All His Old Time Strength,Has Returned"I am convinced Tanlac saved myjob for me, as I was just about allin when I started taking it," saidJames Stafford, 201 'South Seventhisstreet, West Terre Haute, Ind.
