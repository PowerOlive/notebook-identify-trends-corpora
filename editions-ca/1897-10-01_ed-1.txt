YttkeiutsMJapan The Immigration Queetkm SeSettled Shortly Without ArbltmtloNew York Sept 30 A special tothe Herald from Washington saysAn official announcement of the departure of the Japanese cruiser Naniwa for Yokohama together with thestatement that the immigration question raging between Japan and Hawaiiis likely to be shortly settled withoutarbitration has thrown a peacefulaspect around American questions inthe PacificThis cheering news has been communicated to the state department by Minister Sewall stationed at Honoluluwhose mail reports have just reachedthe department The most importantstatement made by Mr Sewall is thatthe Hawaiian Japanese authoritieshave estimated that 3100000 in goldwill settle the claims of the latteragainst the Dole authorities as a resultof the rejection as immigrants of some1200 immigrants who came to the islands last spring Heretofore Japanhas sheltered herself behind the statement that Hawaii must admit first theprinciple of monetary liability andwhen this admission has been made shewould be willing to discuss the amountthat should be paid to salve the woundher dignity had sufferedThe fact that the Mikado is now willing to discuss the amount that sheclaims is due her instead of the principle means in the opinion of the StateDepartment officials that if necessarythe Dole authorities can rid themselvesof a troublesome question before Congress convenes so that Hawaii maypresent herself for admission to theUnion free from foreign questionswhich might otherwise be a stumblingblock in her way to coalition with theUnited StatesOf course it is optional with Hawaiito pay this amount and settle the question The Dole authorities never admitted that they were liable to pay amonetary indemnity as a result of theexclusion of the Japanese immigrantsand they may feel that ifthey pay 100000 in goldto Japan such action may makethem liable to further payments shouldin the future other immigrants be rejected This would be an especiallyserious matter in case union with theUnited States were not accomplishedItwas suggested by a state departmentofficial however that Hawaii mightfollow the course pursued by theUnited States in case ofoutrages upon foreign citizensin this country It is usualfor the government to pay an indemnityto the families of the victims with theunderstanding however that such action has no reference whatever to thequestion of liability State departmentofficials however would be glad to seethe controversy finally disposed of before the Senate takes the annexationtreaty under considerationThe departure of the Naniwa was announced both by Mr Sewall and RearAdmiral Miller The latter has satisfied himself that the Japanese cruiserhas really gone to Japan and tills be-ing the case the cruiser

American Republics in the Forthcoming Bulletin of the Bureau-New York Sept 29 Joseph PSmith director of the bureau of American republics will have an article inthe forthcoming bulletin of the bureauoutlining the extent to which in hisopinion reciprocity can be applied under the new tariff law in fostering thetrade between the United States andMexico Central America and the WestIndies He shows the expansion of thistrade through recent improved meansof communication by rail and by steamship and concerning Mexico saysIf transportationenterprises aresupplemented by a wise system of reciprocity there will be no bounds to thedevelopment of mutually beneficialtrade under the stimulus of closer intercourse and a better acquaintanceThe tariffs of the two countries levyduties on the products of each whichafford the basis for advantageous concessions The Onited States could wellafford in my judgment to remit ormodify taxes on Mexican hides tobaccoores and fruits in exchange for the lowering of Mexicanimpostsupon manufactured articles which Mexico does notproduce and there can be but littledoubt that governments so friendlyand so keenly desirous of increasedtrade the one with the other willquickly agree upon some plan that willbe heartily applauded by the masses ofboth countries The able and progressive president of Mexico Gen PorfirioDiaz has frequently exhibited thefriendliest spirit toward the UnitedStates and is understood to be stronglyinclined to some effective form of reciprocity The administration of President McKinley can be assumed to beequally interested in the removal ofobstacles to trade development for it isannounced the president will shortlyissued a proclamation granting thesame exemptions from discriminatingduties to goods brought into the UnittdStates in Mexican vessels as thosegranted by Mexico to goods taken intoMexican ports in vessels of the UnitedStates As Mexico has already repealedher discriminating duties upon goodsimported in sailing vessels and imposesno such duties upon goods arrivingin steamers President McKinleysproposed action will undoubtedlypromptly remove what now seems tobe a threatening impediment to tradeIf the same spirit should extend to anentire readjustment of the tariff relations of the two countries to eachother as it certainly does there canhardly be any serious difficulty inreaching a permanent agreement forgreater exchange upon terms alikejust honorable liberal and highly satisfactory to allMr Smith says the same is true asto the trade of Central America andthe West Indies with the single exception of Cuba Many of the British colonies to the soutliwardare he sayspractically dependent on the UnitedStates for the necessaries of life andreciprocity would insure the sale tothem of many articles which they nowbuy in EuropeAs to Cuba he saysEconomic forces alone may be expected to compel a solution of the Cuban troubles which will again brinsthat fertile island into close relationwith the United States Exhaustionmust ultimately bring one or the otheraf the parties to the present struggleto terms even should the UnitedStates as is most unlikelyfail in its endeavors to effectan adjustment in the interestof humanity and the principles whichall true Americans have ever had atheart A step toward reciprocity hasalready been taken even under thepresent conditions Notwithstandingthe frequently exhibited disinclinationof the Spanish goverument to makeany concessions to the United Statesthe cable dispatches announce that anew customs tariff has been formed forCuba which reduces the duties uponnearly all goods imported from theUnited StatesCOMING BACKColored Emigrants Who Left the UnitedStates for Liberia Dissatisfied With tlieCountryLiverpool

significance inthe token but his face grew grave almost sad as he said In all my lifeLliss Meredith there has never beenany woman who would do as much asthat for me except my mother I amalmost afraid there never will beAnd your mother she is in the easrI suppose the girl hurriedly observedNeil smiled by no means dull to thelittle ruse to change the subject buthe perceived the wisdom of followingher tactful lead And so he talked ofhis mother his bojhood days and theold home passing thence to generaltopics which although he scarce knewit really showed him at his best fornot only could he talk well on most subjects when he tried but he had thatbetter gift of the conversationalist asympathetic intuition to draw7 out theothers thoughts so that Dorothy wholly at ease was presently chatting as to4in old friendOnly once did he venture upon anybetrayal of his deeper feeling and thatwas when their mission to the old huthad been accomplished and they hadalmost reached the main road

stop while I pick yousome of these mariposa lilies they arethe bluest I have ever seenThey are beautiful thanks she saiddelightedly as she took them from hishand almost apologetically adding Iam so fond of our Colorado flowers ofeverything that blossoms in fact Iwould almost like to see a thanksgivingfor the flowers inserted in the churchserviceWoulcl you he answered dreamilylingering close beside her upon pretense of admiring the lilies I daresay we do take too much for grantedin respect to the pleasant things ofearth But dont you think there is acertain thanksgiving in every thoughtof appreciation I like to think we donot need to put everything into wordsFriends who love each other need notalways be talking to be understoodand it would seem that the all-embracingspirit of nature that we call our Godmight be in such close communion witht he faltering tongue tied soul as to understand and even better than the human friend all that we leave unsaidYes perhaps Dorothy murmuredwith somewhat of surprise in herglanceYou do not agree with me quiteIt is a beautiful thought she saiddoubtfully but is it orthodoxDo you find heterodoxj unpardonableI did not mean to imply that Andsuch heterodoxy as yours Shelooked at him thoughtfully leaving thesentence unfinished But is it satisfying do you think to let things goforever unsaidx Some things perhaps not In factA is extremely unsatisfying at timeslie looked at her witjh something in hiseyes before which her glance fell whileinstinctively she gathered up the reinas though she would go For instance it seems a shame that T

express It is so much that we can befriendsBut the very best of friends mustalways part at last she returned rather shyly smiling down at hianWhich means that I have reallyreached the limit I suppose he saidjreluctantly holding out his handWell then if it must be good byBut in some caprice due more to sudden shyness than any other feeling sherefused to see the proffered hand merely murmuring good

knowBut I know he bitterly exclaimedalthough his smile betrayed somethingof sardonic amusement at her discomfiture It is because after all youdo not forget that I am somebody whomyou have been hating that you cannotreally shake off the habit It is such af allacy the popular notion that womanis by nature only tender and forgiving as a rule I believe she is nothingof the sort simply because she neverforgets Is it not so Miss MeredithAh well By their long memories thegods are known and perhaps it is fitting that woman who is so much morelike unto the gods than we should beparticularly like in that respect Youcannot forget the sum of my imaginedoffenses against your father PerhapsI should not expect it but some daytime may have so far blurredthe record that you can spare a thoughtfor the fact that from the moment ofour first meeting I have been yourfriend that I would have been hestopped startled by such a rush offeeling as almost choked his utterancethough his eyes still clung to theirmocking light and his principal feeling was one of angry disappointmentas he went on in a lowered voice Iwrould have been all that you couldhave permitted Miss Meredith Butyou need not look so

as when in sensitized brooding upon a past offense all the magnanimity of her nature has been rousedin longing to make atonement Andcertain it was that Dorothy Meredithas she rode away from Harvej1 Neilthat day had not been so full of yearning kindness toward him but for thatlittle hand clasp which she had refused It had been an unreasoning impulse to drawback somewhat from theattitude of friendly confidence intowhich she havl almost inadvertentlydrifted but now she reproached herself for the childish inconsistency hislast words gaining force as she repeatedthem in her mind impelling her heart10 compunctious tenderness hithertoundreamed of It would have been solittle to concede on her part the meretouch of her hand in a parting wnichmight be for all time It would havecommitted her to nothing while to himit might have been so much becauseah could it be true that he loved herConsidering how little he really knewher and how irrevocably their pathsseemed set apart it seemed the wildestmaddest idea ridiculous to the pointof pathos and yet remembering thelook in his eyes she could not question his meaning when he said that hewould have been to her all that shecould have let him be Asking nothingexpecting nothing he had in effect laidhis heart at her feet and she had denied him even the mere touch of herfinger tips And without analyzingher feeling beyond this ground for selfreproach Dorothy felt that she wasfitly punished in that she wis veryvery unhappy about itCHAPTER IXThe day before the trial Harvey Neilappeared at his lawyers office with aface so eloquent of discovery thatBartels at once exclaimed at sight of himHalloo Whats upI believe the Grubstake folks havebeen shipping out of the enjoined groundright along the young man explainedwith a sardonic smile dropping into achair wearilyThey have the tone attesting theattorneys appreciation of the importance of the statement How did youget onto thatOne of my men got me a couple ofsamples of the stuff they are shippingby begging a ride to town on one of thewagons and running a knife into someof the ore sacks while the driver was atdinner I made assays this morningThe first ran a trifle over three thousand in gold while the second went upto over seven and if both did not comeout of the Mascot vein I would almostagree to eat the whole shipment Yousee I have had my suspicions rightalong ever since they claimed to havemade such a strike of low grade truckin their lowest level where thqy aredrifting to connect with the old tunnelSomehow I knew it wasnt so but withthe shaf thouse guarded night anl dayit seemed next to impossible to getssight of the ore I tried at the Denversmelter It looked fishy their hippingit through to Denver but they evidently had their instructions and I was politely turned down However thoughit is i Tictty afe m the da I believe Iam on to the r little game nowBut if there is any such busiuess asthat going on well have an order fromthe court for an examination at oncethough as you observe it is ratherlate in the day exclaimed Bartelswith rather more show of excitementthan he often manifestedAnd by the time we get to the minewith our order from the court thechances are that there wouldnt be aman nearer the disputed territory thanthe sorters on the dump pile Theywouldnt go into such work as thatwithout being provided with a systemof signals and underground telegraphyto guard against surprises MoreoverI think we can do better a good dealof complacent satisfaction in the tonenow I think we shall have one oftheir men on the witness stand to-morrowGood enough cried the lawyer in atone of cordial congratulation Who isheA fellow who used to work for meHe drifted away at the time of thercrike and I lost sight of him until theother day when he told me he had beenworking on the Grubstake for a monthI happened to run across nim again thismorning just after I had made thoseassays it flashed across me at encethat he was the man for us and I madehim an off er on the spotWhich he acceptedNot exactly He said he wouldgive me an answer to night but I ampretty tolerably sure of him To a manwith a passion for bucking faro fiftydollars in cash is a powerful persuaderIt is but I wish he had not takentime to consider it just the same thelawyer dryly returned And did youget him to admit anythingOnly as silence and an eloquentgrin gives consent I said that I knewthey were on our ground and he did notdeny it he said he did not feel liketalking then he wanted time to thinkj t over but I feel sure from his maimerthat it is all rightAnd Brigham have you seen himlatelyNo I did not think it advisable tobe seen camping on his trail continually but I sent him a note to meetme here this afternoonHe has not been inSo I inferred but I will ride up toTomtown from here and look him upJi wft Jm r1 rY ufr3 JPiShi JriMlvJ iirrr TYou do not forget I am 3omobody whom youhave been hating-I have been feeling tolerably sure ofhim since our last talk he seemed perfectly satisfied with the terms I offered and talked in the fairest possiblewaj but I dont like his not comingHes as slippery us an eel declaredthe lawyer disgustedly If you gethold of him you had better take himback to the Gulch with you to night andnot lose sight of him again till courtopens Then if you can secure the otherfellow for an alternate in case the raseal elects to go back on us the last minute we may be reasonably sure of something But if you are not dead sure ofyour new man I think we would stillbetter go for an examination of themineWe should probably have to ask forn continuance of the case if we didreturned Neil in interrogative toneWell as late in the day as this jerhaps answered BartelsWhich would probably be refusedif the judge has been approached bythe other side Neil bitterly rejoinedAnd anyway as I said before I wouldrather take my chances than delay thetrial by an hour It has been hangingoer me long enough While moreover I feel perfectly sure of being ableto buy up this man Baker even if 50turns out to be too little I will haveboth him and Brigham here at youroffice by eight oclock to morrow morning I swear it a look in his eyeo whichamply indorsed the wordsAll right If you stick by that Ithink we may count on an easy victoryBartels said cordially as the jroungman took his leaveA couple of hours later that sameafternoon Dorothy Meredith knockingat her fathers door to see if he wereready to go to supper found him closeted with the superintendent of themineCome in for a moment Tll go downwith you presently he said to

her littlewhim Of course those mothers ofours had their whims and exercised thepriceless privileges of their thoughtlessness and snapped now and then asgirls and other than girls have alwaysdone but I think it cannot be deniedthat the girl of a generation ago had aconscience on the subject of debts ofgTatitude such as few have had sinceher daj1 have said that I am afraid that withmany of us to day it is a lost art 1am sure that it is not given that prominence which it once had and that it isnet cultivated with the enthusiasm withwhich it once was Girls are taughtwhat etiquette says about it but etiquette deals only from the lips outwardand the result is that even our languagetells the story of the decadence ofthanksgiving A traveler from Marsmight hear our Thanks 1000000times and never suspect that it wasmeant as an acKnowieagment 01 afavor I am sure that up to saj adozen years ago in those parts of ourcountry where gallantry has held outlongest one could not give up a seatin a car without being sure of a fullreturn in acknowledgment that meantto acknowledge something and thatto day the average man is utterly upset and undone when his ears catch theold sweet sound Of course this doesnot justify or account for the currentlack of gallantry among men but Iam not engaged in the hopeless taskof restoring men to the old paths but inthe hopeful one of pointing out a neglected talent which the most charming of girls may cultivate with good results I am not grumbling I do notmean to saj that the girl of the period is one whit behind the girl of thepast I do not believe in the decadenceof women I believe that the girl ofto day is equal to the girl her motherused to be but I do not believe that itjs enough to say of our girls that theyare equal to the girls of the past anymore than it is enough to say of a flower that has had the best attention ofthe best florists for a generation that itis as beautiful to day as it was 30years ago If we have donewisely the girl of to day ought to havenot only something winch her motherlacked but she ought to have all hermothers graces as well But it is a serious question whether in pressing herdevelopment we have not

assert that they find- it easierto get along with one maid even if alarge share of the work must receivepersonal attention At least say theyfriction between servants is avoidedThis is quite true for where two ormore maids are engaged all sorts ofsmall jealousies and dislikes have theirrise The housemaid complains of thecook and the cook grumbles about thehousemaids failing whenever eithercan get a hearingThe only escape from all of this andthe only certain means of putting anend to it is for the lady of the houseto reprove the first attempt at talebeaiing She should frankly state thatshe desires to know nothing of herservants disputes and that whateverfaults they may havo she prefers to discover herself that neither insinuationsnor accusations will be tolerated nomatter in what spirit they are broughtto herThe servants will learn to respect thisprinciple and- there will be less opportunity for nursing imaginary wrongsif there is no chance of appealing to thehousewifes sympathyNot

complaintabout the customer who shops turnsover goods and never buys The womanbehind the counter does not care forsympathy but she appreciates politeness in the customer she waits uponThis is a story of a small New England city where people are a littlemore shaken together than they are inlarger cities This woman was reallya lady and was a store clerk from necessity There she had many pleasantdealings with a customer who alwayscame to her to be waited upon andwhom she took great pains to serveIt chanced during one of the winters that she was invited to card parties at which she met her former customer socially That is there was aformal introduction Possibly therewas not as much real sociability between the two at the card parties -isover the counterThen the two met on the street Thetcustomer was looking in an oppositedirection They met again anacustomer although her eyes were apparently gazing straight into the eyesof the clerk saw only vacancyI am sensitive said the clerk to herself She did- not see me I will bemore sure another timeIn the meantime the customer hadcalled at the shop and received theusualrespectful attention from her favoriteclerkThen for a third time the customerand clerk met on the street and thistime there could be no mistake the customer did see the clerk it was plain andit was equally ulain that she did not intend to speak to herI did not expect her to do more thanspeak to me courteously said theclerk relating the experience but under the circumstances I did expectthat I have waited on her for the lastftime She comes into the shop now andif I am entirely at leisure I let her standuntil some one else is ready to take herorder She has taken up my time in theshop telling me of her intimate- familyaffairs in which I am in no way interested She has been very pleasant anilvery familiar I do nnt care for thatbut I do expect a courteous recognitionUndoubtedly it is foolish for anywoman clerk or not to feel that it isworth while being offended becausesome woman fails to recognize herConditions in New York are differentJust such an episode could hardly arisehere but snobbishness either here orelsewhere does not seem to be an admirable quality The saleslady appreciates considerate treatmentShe was so nice one of them washeard to say enthusiastically a fewdays ago in commenting upon a recentcustomer and she said she had such anice

againPoor Anna her tale was told in fewwords but those few words contained avolume of sorrow Her outward voyagehad been prosperous and exceedinglypleasant She was leaving poverty behind her and was about to meet theman to whom her whole heart waigiven and who had as she knew madea comfortable living for himself Shewas strong and well and light heartedand all on board the vessel conspired tocourt and flatter her She might havechosen a husband from amongst halfa dozen men but it was Jamie shewanted and Jamie to whom she was going All through the voyage she pictured his delight when he should rushon board the Petrel to welcome herbut the Petrel arrived and there wasno Jamie Nor the next day nor thenext day she settled herself in a hotelwrote to him and waitedAfter three days waiting a lady wasushered into her room a lady mostdistinctly of the strong minded genusNot a bad looking woman Annathought to herself as the two stoodwatchfully regarding one another notbad looking nor vulgar nor quite alady nor just at this moment quite ather easeYou are Miss Edgar arent youshe said after that pause of inspection11 is rather awkward for us you seeI am Mrs Barrington you wont takeit kindly I am afraid but Jem wouldnot come himself he wrould send meNow what can Ave do to put things aslight as they can beSo the delay was explained The delighted bridegroom had not rushed tomeet his bride because he was alreadyhusband to another woman It wenthard with Anna but she was a proudwoman and compelled herself to give acold attention to the explanations thatMrs Barrington forced upon her Asif being betrayed it mattered to herhow the thing was done A rescue fromHHU1HBHU - Udanger on the one sidenursingthrough an illness on the other Whatdid it matter to the woman they hadcheated Mrs

was stillterribly weak and shaken The sympathy of all the place was with her forseeing the impossibility of keeping thedisaster secret the Edgars had decidedto speak of it openly at once and friendly gifts of all kinds came in to show thekindly feeling of the neighbors Thelittle house overflowed like a cornucopia with fruit and flowersGeoffrey hung about ready to nurserun errands write letters or do anything that could be required of him aslong as his business could spare himand then unwillingly announced thathe must goYou will say it is heartless of me if Isuggest that it is an ill wind that blowsnobody any good he said squeezingGeorgies hand as they sat over thetwilight fire but you see Anna couldnot have done me a better turn than bycoming to grief in this way All yourmisfortune seems to be good luck tome If she had not come back I shouldhave been afraid to ask you to come tome Georgie darling for you wouldhave said you could not leave Josie Icannot offer you anything like whatyou

emphasisI have come across the world as Isaid to seek you out and ask if youhave forgiven me for what happenedten years ago Anna This is my onlychild he said pointing to a little girlin a mourning frock who hung shylybehind himAnna looked curiously at the child oithe woman who had supplanted herShe bore a softened resemblance to hermother but in her face was a strangeexpression indicative of Anna knew notwhatIndeed said Anna and paused inquiringlyI have brought her with me resumed James she is all I have It isalmost- two years since she lost hermotherAnd you probably wish her to beeducated in England I am sorry tohear of your loss it is a great chargeto be left with so young a child totrainAnna was aware that she spokestiffly and indifferentty but she wasstill in the dark as to the meaning oithe present interview and she resentedwhat she looked upon as an unwarrantable intrusionI brought her with me because Icould not do without the only creatureI have belonging to me and besides 1want to show her to an English doctorAnna you do not know what my loneliness is and how ill I can bear to bealone I never could bear to be by nryself It was that that brought aboutwhat you must look on as my treacherytoward you You know how I urgedvou to come out to me and how vouwould still wait till I could come tofetch you It was too lonely and thenI met writh Jessie She told you allabout it she was good to me and I married her Then you came out twomonths too late and it broke my heartAnna for it was you always that IlovedHush exclaimed Anna aghast ashe ended with an appeal in his voiceThis is scarcely fit talk before yourwifes daughterDo you not know he said bitterlythe child is stone deaf The same calamity that deprived me of her mothertook away her hearing We may saywhat we choose before her she onlyknows what we say on our fingersPoor little soul said Anna suddenly relenting toward the mute littlefigure and taking her into her f riendjyarms She understood now the strangeexpression that she had noticed on theichilds face MIt is a heavy trial to her and to meand she has no mother Anna I havecome to see if you can be won to forgiveme the past and take the place now thatyou have always had in my heart I ama rich man now in everything but happiness I can give you all the luxuriesyou were born to and if you do notchoose to go to Australia I will sell myproperty there and purchase an estatewhere you please in EnglandAnna had released the child and nowstood proudly confronting its fatherI am exceedingly glad to hear of yourprosperity it must surpass even

sore andangry when you think of my treatmentof you but you do not realize how muchI too have undergone Jessie was a goodwoman a good wife but she was notthe woman that I lovedMore shame for you interruptedAnnaJames put up his hand imploringlyYou speak truly but it was youyo always that I carried in my heartand it is you that I have come back toseek Anna if you are still angry withme will you

the thread of lifeis often snappedDown in Colorado I knew a fellowwho plunged down 800 feet in a singlecompartment shaft He went to thebottom but did not break a bone Ofcourse he was pretty badly jarred upand a good deal frightened but he was11 right again in a day or two Whenhe fell he went down feet first and abigoilskin that he wore opened out at thebottom and acted as a parachute Hesaid the last part of his descent was somuch slower than the first that he hardly thought he was dropping at all andhalf expected to remain suspended inthe shaft like Mohammeds coffinNearty always when a man falls anydistance he turns over if he starts feetdownward and finishes his plunge headfirst I have seen a number of caseswhere the man fell with his boots on andwas found barefooted when he waspicked up I suppose this is becausethe blood goes to the head making thefeet smaller and besides the pressureof the air upon the heel and counteracts as a bootjackI had to go over to Sand Coulee

must restupon something solid like the side ofa bin while the other may be suspendedby a rope so the whole will be on an incline-My method of operation was tohave two bins one for the sorted stockand one for the small potatoes TheCOMPLETE POTATO SORTERlower end of the sorter is suspendedover the bin for large potatoes Theother end extends two or three feet outside the small potato bin This givesthe dirt a chance to settle through before reaching either binPig 2 shows the inside slat framewhich is made of hard pine slats 10feet long two inches wide and threefourths of an inch thick They are seton edge and bolted with quarter inchbolts to slotted sticks near each endThis arrangement admits of adjustment I have the upper end of the slatsthree fourths of an inch apart and thelower end 1 inches This preventswedging of potatoes between the slatsThe upper ends being close togetherallow the dirt to drop through in advance of the small potatoes This endalso has a hopper four inches high andreaching 2 feet from the end Thiswhole frame is suspended to the outsideframe by iron hangers These are madeof three-eighths-inch rod iron and aresix inches long Notches are cut to receive these on

thirdexperimental shipment of butter toLondon by his department The shipment consisted of a lot of Minnesotacreamery butter in 56 pound boxes andtubs and a lot of Massachusetts creamery butter in small tubs family packages and f anc3r prints The export wasmade in June It cost 2 cents apoundto carry the butter from central Minnesota to London by the single tonwjth the best refrigerator accommodations all the waj excepting short transfers The transportation from westernMassachusetts cost rather more because of the absence of a refrigeratorcar line to New York and the necessityof paying expressage This butter wasall placed by the departments agent inLondon in the hands of retail dealersThey paid from 15 to 19 cents perpound for it the same butter being thenworth 15 cents in New York Thewholesale price of Danish butter wasabout 20 cents in London at that timeIt was retailed -to consumers at 24 25and 26 cents per pound most of it at26 cents This was the same as the retail price of the best Danish whichleads the London market for salted butter The retailers upon being convinced of the high quality of the American butter paid the same price for itin tubs as in the favorite Australianor cubical box Six different dealerstook the Minnesota butter at a uniformprice of 18 1 5 cents per pound It costabout 16 cents delivered to those London dealers The Massachusetts butter was of equal quality and althoughsome of it sold to dealers at 19 centsthe small packages were not liked bythe trade This butter was worth 20cents for local sale in the neighborhood where made Thus as in othercases the western creamery butter wassold at a fair profit over two cents perpound while the New England creamery butter was sold in London at lessthan it would have brought at homeThe London retailers margin for profit6 cents and about seven cents on anaverage was too great The consumerpaid twice as much for the Minnesotabutter as the creamery in that statereceived for it and of what the buttercost the consumer the farmer who supplied the cream got less than two fifthsMANAGING MILK COWSTreatment Tliat Assures a SteadyFlow of Good MilkI wish to give you a few hints onmilking cows The farm hand whoknows how to milk properly is morevaluable to the careful dairyman thanany other help To milk a cow requirestime and patience The milk shouldbe drawn slowly and steadily Somecows have very tender teats and ifyou want a good disposed cow be gentle in your treatment toward her asshe is aturally impatient and does notlike rough handling With constantirritation she will fail in quantity ofnillc As the udder becomes filledwith milk she is anxious to be relievedof its contents and will seldom offerx esistance without a cause When apatient cow becomes fractious we canalways trace it to the milkmaid Notethis We should not allow them tostand a long time waiting to be milkedWhen cows give a large quantity ofmilk it is very painful when the uddershave iilled to the utmost thereforecausing them to become very nervousand restless To delay niilking at theproper time will do more to cause acow to go dry before her period thananything else She should also bemilked to the last drop if possible forthe last portion of milk is said to bethe richest Still another point Thereare many wajrs of conducting a dairyAmong them are Wholesome foodsuch as wheat bran cottonseed mealAlways be careful to keep the cowswell salted protected from badweather kind handling careful milking regular feeding clean stablinggood ventilation and plenty of purewater In some sections we have whatis called the bitter weed which cowsare fond of causing the milk to become so much affected that it is hardly fit for use 1 find that by giving thecow about two tablespoonf uls of sugarat each meal for two or three days entirely relieves the milk of the bittertaste G B Dillon in AgriculturalEpitomistBUTTER FOR WINTERHow to Keep It Where Cold StoragruCannot Be HadFor keeping butter for winter usewhere cold storage cannot be had noplan is as sure to result favorably asimmersing the pound prints in strongbrine and if a trifle of saltpetre isadded to the brine the plan will appearto be safer Butter will not absorb saltfrom the brine hence the plan of thelittle muslin wrappers or better yetthe little paper box whicn incases thepat of butter like a close fitting envelope and prevents the butter from getting bruised in the bath We think wehave before recommended the sterilizedbrine simply strong brine boiled andafter cooling placing these pats of butter in it and keeping in a cool placeand taking up the butter only aswantedWhere- one has a very cold room ofuniform temperature butter can bepacked in close fitting small packagesand closely covered after placing on thelop of the butter either closed-fitting-layersof butter paper or a paste madeof very wet salt spread evenly over thesurface before putting on the coverclosely The facts are that nothingvery new has been
