There's a question for you to answer for yourself.
If you are putting money in the bank you know they
will be PROVIDED FOR. If you are spending and
wasting every dollar you get. you don't know what will
become of them. Who gets the money you earn? If
you put into our bank what you spend or lend foolishly
it will protect those children dependent on you.
Make OUR bank YOUR bank.

Maggie Rogers McClintock vs. J. D.
McClintock for a reduction of ajimony
and a complaint upon the part of the
defendant that .he has been put to con
siderable inconvenience to see his lit
tle daughter, Miss Rachael McClin
tock. The matter was continued gen
erally bygJudge Kerr.
The amount of alimony 'which Mr.
McClintock has been paying to Mrs".
McClintock, under an border of the
Ctfurt of Appeals is 100 per month,
but in the opmien rendered by the
higher court, it was stated that amount
might be increased ordecreased by the
trial court upon the submission of sat
isfactory evidence.
Schedule Causing Worry
The agricultural schedule, it is
stated, is giving the Democratic tariff
makers trouble, vwhich will ;be carried
to the caucus in April, where Kepre
sentatve Stanley and others promise
to renew the fight for free wheat,
corn, sheep, hogs, cattle and raw
wool. Sentiment 'seems to have de
veloped in favor of one tariff bill and
not separate bills for each schedeule.
Making All Happy.
What I deem an appropriate pres
ent is a book, and that I must choose
for rr'scli," writes a correspondent
of tlie London Chronicle. "To leave
the selection to friends would be a
catastrophe. Every year, therefore,
on behalf of those generously minded
individuals who have kindlv thmiP-hto
toward me, I buy books for myself,'0
tell them, and get the money refunded'.
And in the measure of monetary- value
they remember me, I likewise remem
ber them in any article of their own
choosing. And we are all happy."
Buzzing Sounds Made by Insects.
The different humming or buzzing
sound in, insects is caused by the vi
bration of the wings, and the more
rapid the vibrations the sharper the
sound. Scientists have estimated that
the common house fly vibrates its
wings about 335 times a second and
the honeybee 400 times, though a
tired bee mbves its wings more slow
ly and makes a different sound from
a fresh one. The butterfly is content
to move more slowly and makes no
noise.

THEATRICAL.
SATAN.
Milton's "Paradise Lost" and KlyD-:
stok's "Messiah" were the two clase
ics used for the first two parts of the
moving picture classic "Satan," which
will be exhibited at the Paris Grand
on Friday and Saturday, March 21 and
22. The theme of the five reels of in-
teresting pictures is that of the his
tory of Man. Through distant dim
aces the pictures lead the audience
and.it is almost as if one had 'lived
for countless years and watched the
coming of kings and the falling of
empires. Each scene is of a different
era and all of it based upon biblical
and historical facts. The" first scene
shows the waging of the battle be
tween God and Satan and the defeat
of the evil spirits, the descent of '
Satan to earth which he makes his
kingdom. The earth is subtle to his
influence and ready to follow in crime
and wickedness. Adam and Eve are
the first to fall before Satan's work,
and at his instigation Cain fashions
the first weapon and slay his brother.
The Messiah comes to earth in the
second pait and is quietly gning i about
his wav performing miracles, preach
ing the truth of God and working for
the redemption of man. Satan Jis not
yet through and having vainly at
tempted to taint the glorious soul of
Jesus he bribes Judaa to deliver the
kiss of betrayal. Jesus in all his radi
ance walks forth from the tomb and
once again Safan is defeated. The
Ambrosic Company expended ?200,000
in giving the wondertul drama a fit
ting presentation to the Dublic. A
special machine is carried by the com
pany with expert operator in charge.
For Sale.
Having'decided not to complete'my
home on Houston avenue I offer the
property for sale.
I offer also my lot containing seven
acres of land in White Addition, near
the foot bridge over Houston.
