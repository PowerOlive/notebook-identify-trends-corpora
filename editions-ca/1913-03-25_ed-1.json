There's a question for you to answer for yourself.
If you are putting money in the bank you know they
will be PROVIDED FOR. If you are spending and
wasting every dollar you get, you don't know what will
J become of them. Who gets the money you earn? If
you put into our bank what you spend or lend foolishly
it vill protect those children dependent on you.

Paris Will Have Building Boom.
As an evidence of the rapid increase
in the population of Paris, there are
daily demands for residence property
and to meet this demand the city will
experience one of the largest building
booms in its history this spring.
With the advent iJf seasonable
weather more than Jbwenty dwelling
houses in yariousfoaris of the city will
go under construiMon and contractors
will have all they can do to complete
the contracts they now have on hand
before the coming fall. The demand
for building lots has been greater in
the last few months than ever before
and real estate changes are daily re
corded. While there is a heavy demand for
residence property there is none the
less greater for business locations. At
the present time there is scarcely a
vacant business hnuse in the town ard
this condition is keeping down enter
prises that otherwise would be doing a
flourishing business. During the
sprinc, it is said, the S. H. Kress Co.,
operating a large number of stores in
the United States, will begin the erec
t;on of tnerr handsome three story bus
iness house n Main street, on the site
purchased from the Baptist church at
the corner of Main and Sixth streets.
Bids have been received for the mate
rial in Ihe old building Which indicates
thev contemplate razing the old church
at an earlv date, liiis'will be reolac
ed with a beautiful white brick build
ing. f
the company, which operates ifive
and ten cent stoies throughout the.
country, will use a uoition ofgthe lower
floor of the building whileanother store
room will be leased. The first and
second floors will be divided into office
suites. Mr. Lee T. Beall, agent for
the firm in this city, with whom he is
constantly in communication is of tre
opinion that it will not be very long
until work will begin on the building.
It was the original intention to begin
work on the structure ksfc spring but
owing to the tact that the" cumpa.iy
had eleven other buildings to erect
before coming to Paiis caused this
delay.
