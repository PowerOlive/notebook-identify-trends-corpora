WILD L!8H ROARS
Hunter Declares Beasts Shake
the Ground.
Experience of American Who Killed
Seventy-One in South Africa
Slay Their Prey at
Night.
New York. Stewart Edward White,
who brought home a record of 71
lions killed in South Africa, says that
visitors to the zoo have no idea what
the real roar of that animal sounds
like. He calls "the menagerie row" at
feeding time only a gentle hint of what
a wild lion can achieve in the vocal
line.
"A pack of lions will often, deliber
ately drive game into narrow ravines
or cul-de-sacs where the killers are
waiting," he says in the American
Magazine. "At such times the man. fa
vored by the chance of an encamp
ment within five miles or so can hear
a lion's roar.
"Otherwise I doubt if he is apt often
to get the full voiced, genuine article.
The peculiar questing cough of early
evening is resonant and deep in vibra
tion, but it is a call rather than, a
roar. No lion is fool enough to make
a noise when he is stalking.
"Afterward, when full fed, individu
als may open up a few times, but only
a few times,, in sheer satisfaction, ap
parently, at being well fed. But when
seven or eight lions roar merely to
see how much noise they can make
as when driving game, or trying to
stampede your oxen on a wagon trip
the effect is something tremendous.
"The very substance of the ground
vibrates; the air shakes. I can only
compare it to the effect of a very
large, deep organ in a very small
church. There is something genuine
ly awe inspiring about it; and when
the repeated volleys rumble into si
lence, one can imagine the veldt
crouched in a rigid terror that shall
endure.
"The only sure thing about a lion
is his originality. He has more ex
ceptions to his rules than the German
language. Men who have been migh
ty lion hunters for many years, and
who have brought to their hunting
close observation, can only tell you
what a lion may do in .certain circum
stances. Following very broad prin
ciples, they may even predict what
he is apt to do, but never what he
certainly will do.
"In general, then, the lion frequents
that part of the country where feed
the great game herds. From them he
takes his toll by night, retiring dur
ing the day into the shallow ravines,
the brush patches or the rocky little
buttes. I have, however, seen lions
miles from game, slumbering peace
fully atop an ant hill. Indeed, occa
sionally a pack of lions like to live
high in the tall grass ridges, where
every hunt will mean for them a four
or five-mile jaunt out and back again.
"He needs water after feeding, and
so rarely gets further than eight or
ten miles from that necessity. He
hunts at night. This is as nearly in
variable a rule as can be formulated
in regard to lions. Yet once, and
perhaps twice, I saw lionesses stalk
ing through tall grass as early as 3
o'clock in the afternoon. This eager
ness may or may not have had to do
with the possession of hungry cubs.
ARMY MULE EATS ITS TAG
Steamer Tied Up Until Officers Learn
Destination of Animal With Ap
petite Like Goat.
Seattle, Wash. An innocent looking
young mule of the army type delayed
the steamship Northwestern for Prince
William sound ports for an hour here
while an army of clerks and dock em
ployes vainly tried to discover, to
whom the animal was consigned.
A cheerful but slow witted colored
boy led the animal to the docks and
left it while he watched the busy
scene. When the mule was sought out
the freight handlers discovered that
the freight tag which had been tied
to the halter had disappeared. A tell
tale bit of string dangling from the
mule's mouth showed the tag had
been chewed up.
"Boss, he's done et up de place
whar he was goin' and Ah disremem
ber de name," said the colored boy
plaintively.
After an hour of search the mule
was started on Its journey with a
shipping tag firmly fastened round its
neck, out of reach of the mule's teeth.

Atlantio City Man Reduces 32 Pounds,
Eats Meal, Falls III, Sent
to Hospital.
Philadelphia, Pa. John Watson of
Atlantic City fasted 46 days to reduce
his weight, and then tried to enjoy a
meal. The other day Watson walked
into detective headquarters and asked
to be sent to a hospital. He had weigh
ed 146 pounds, which he thought was
too much. He consulted doctors. They
told him to fast, he said. He fasted.
Now he weighed 114 pounds, and felt
he had accomplished enough. So he
ate a real meal. Then he walked into
headquarters and asked for assistance.
He was sent to the Philadelphia hos

dled because he wished to create an
impression on a woman with whom he
was in love. The judge replied:
"Don't, talk to me of making an im
pression on the fair sex. You are far

Indian Pitcher Coming to Paris.
Chas. Bomosh, the Chippewa Indian
who was a few weeks ago reported to
nave been signed by the Paris ..Club,
and who since has been sought by the
local management, will probabiy re
port to Pans some time next week
Bsmosh has been ritching indepen
dent ball, and now located at Lehas
ku, Pa., where x transportation has
been wired him.
Bomosh, who is a full blooded Chip
pewa, was a student at Carlisle
University. He is under the care of
the government and the local club
will be held responsible for his con
duct and safety.
A letter received from the Indian
Agency by President J. W. -Bacon, is
to the effect that the proper protect
ion must be given the Indian and all
efforts used- to encourage abstinence
from drink, and that there shall be
no effort on the part of any member
of the club to induce him to drink or !
take part in any demonstration that !
may lead to riots, or endanger his
life.
The rain Tuesday afternoon Dre
vented the game scheauled between
Paris and Richmond on the Richmond
grounds.
Wednesday the Pioneers defeated
Paris by a score of 10 to 1. The game
was filled with" sensational Dlavs. one
of which was a lung running catch by i
Kjnupmnn, wno caugnc tne nail alter
falling and while standing almost on
his head. The Pioneers hit Ludwig
hard and counted eleven safe drives off
his delivery, while Black, for the
Richmond.team was almost invincible.
The Fourth of July games pulled the
locals down in percentage for yester
day two were dropDed to the Colts.
The contest yesterdav afternoon re
sulted in a defeat tor Paris by a score
of 3 to 2. The game was played on
the Lexington grounds.
The morning game was played on
the local grounds and was one of tn
prettiest witnessed here this season.
Harold and Turner opposed each other
on the mound and fur four innings it
was a battle royal. Lexington had a
man on third in the second and a score
was prevented only by aj dose play at
the plate.
The game should have gone to Paris
and this would probably have been the
final result had it not been for a
"bone" which was Jpulled in the fifth
after two were dow n. Vicker reached
first on a choice when Turner was run
down between the bases, when Ellis
dropned a short fly into the'right field
which should have been an easy out
had DunlaD not tried no cover too
much tenitury. This play was re
SDonsible for the two runs which the
Colts secured.
In their half of the fifth the locals
threatened to tie up the score and
Dunlap partly redeemed himself by
driving in the onlv score of the Bour
bonites by a timely two-bagger.
The locals werb never dangerous
after that, but a hit in the last inning
which would have tied up the contest
was not forthcoming.
Harold pitched excellent, ball
throughout and worked himself out of
several tight places in which position
he was placeu by the lcose fielding of
his teammates.

MAN STUMBLES ON RICHES
Discovery of Cltar Lake (Ariz.) Fltfd
Result of Chance Sees Gold
in Bowlders.
Clear Lake, Ariz. T. Ollle Phillips
was a poor mining prospector less
than a year ago. When he was not
roaming over the mountains he made
his home at Bisbee. Recently he was
paid $200,000 for an undeveloped gold
and silver claim situated in this new
camp. W. S. Small and J. H. Kniffen,
who purchased the property from Mr.
Phillips, have in turn just disposed of
it to a syndicate of Boston and Spring
field (Mass.) men, headed by Smith
Bros., the reported consideration be
ing $500,000. The new owners have
taken steps to organize a company to
operate the mine. It is claimed there
is enough ore in sight to justify the
erection of a 250-ton mill. It was by
chance that Mr. Phillips discovered
the vein which has brought him a for
tune. He was making a trip through
this section less than twelve months
ago, accompanied by a photographer,
whose mission it was to get some
views of the famous Apache Box Can
yon. One day, while the photographer
was off taking pictures, Mr. Phillips
aimlessly walked through the pic
turesque canyon. His trained eye
caught sight of gold in a bowlder that
wa lying in the bottom of the gorge.
He examined other bowlders and found
gold in all of them. Keeping the dis
covery to himself, he remained with
the photographer until the latter had
finished his work. He then returned
to the canyon and began a systematic
search for the vein from which the
bowlders had come. He succeeded in
fir-ding it upon the wall of the canyon
and staked out his claim.
