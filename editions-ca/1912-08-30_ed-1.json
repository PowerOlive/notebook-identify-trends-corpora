STOCK, CROP AND FARM NOTES;
While .Boyle county has had abnud
ant rains certain sections ot Mercer
county, are suffering from a severe
drought. Most of the rains have been
local and while the crops m surround
ing counties will be short on account
of the dry weather the yields in Boyle
promise to be prolific. The corn crcn
in Boyle is something immense.
With only about S300 worth of corn
in controversy, the sixth trial of the
suit between Jesse N. Fishback and
Perry Ward, two farmers,, is now be
ing heard in the Quarterly Court at
Carlisle. In the five preceding trials
three have resulted in hung juries and
the other two have been followed by
appeals. The cost is now several
times the amount in controversy.
Due to the almost entire fail
ure of the corn crop throughout the
greater part of Central America much
suffering exsts.there, according to ad
vices rceeived rere. Many of the
poorer classes have been reduced to
the verge of starvation, it is said, and
with little Drospect for immediate re
lief the situation has bceome grave
during the past few weeks..
Farm demonstrators from the Fed
eral Department of Agriculture will
be stationed in ten counties in Ken
tucky next year. The Government
and the StatP each have an aDDromria
tion to be used for this purpose, and a
big manufacturing and distributing
concern has adopted the policy of al
lotting SI, 000 to each of certain coun
ties selected in a State jfor the pur
pose of promoting agriculture, on "the
theory that as agriculture prospers
their sales increase.
These demonstrators will give ex
pert advice to farmers regarding
matters bearingonJ the character of
soil, rotation of cropa, methods of cul
tivationa and fertiliaztion, laying off
the farm, drainage, building 3ilos.
barns, etc., and all questions arising
in"connection with practical farming.
Their method of demonstrating ia
unique. They make arrangements with
the farmer whereby he plants his crop
in a field according to his ideas, then
the demonstrator takes a portion of
the same field, plants the same kind of
crop, after the most approved meth
ods, and demonstrates, side by side
with the farmer, the advantage of
scientific methods.
The counties in which the demon
strators are to be located will be
chosen so as to have the demonstra
tions on diverisfied kinds of soil. Com
missioner Newman hones beiore his
term ex-pies to have a demonstrator in
every county, beileving the weatlh of
the State can be mutipiedll. "If this
can be done." said Commissioner New
man, "the increased yield will pav the
expenses of the State government ten
times over in a year."
