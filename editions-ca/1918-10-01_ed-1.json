GLORIA HOPE
like "The Birth Birth of a Nation" and Hearts of the World," "The
Great Love" is the result of long and untiring effort on D. W. Griffith
part.
He first spent eighteen months on the battlefields of Prance to pho- -
tograph the stupendous scenes of the Great Conflict. Then he came hack
to his California studio and wove these undying scenes into the greatest
story of woman's part in the fight a story that proves that, though wo
men are not using cannon and machine guns and bayonets, they're fight
ing just the same. ,
SOCIETY WOMEN IN PICTURE
In addition to the players mentioned, many celebrated society women
of Eifland will be seen in "The Great Love." Thttt include Queen Alex
andra, the Princess of Monaca, the Countess of Masserene, Lady John
Lavery, the Countess of Drouhda, Lady Diana Manners, daughter of 'the
Duke of the Ruthland, and .known as the most famous beauty in Eng
land, Miss Elizabeth Asguith, daughter of the former Prime Minister
of England, the Hon. Mrs. Montague, Miss Bettina Stuart-Wortley and
Miss Violet Keppel. .It is safe to say that so notable an array of celeb
rites never has been presented in any screen offering thus far produced.
