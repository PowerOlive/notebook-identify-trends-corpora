William Sunday, familiarlyknown to thousands as "Billy" Sunday, visited Paris yesterday, according tb previous arrangements, anddeparted on the 3:30 Louisville &Nashville train, after a receptionand speech delivered to a crowd inthe Bourbon Tobacco Warehouse, es;??ned variously at from 8,000 to10,000. Every available foot ofspace on the big floors was taken upby an eager, jostling, but goodnatured throng, anxious to hear theman who- has become famous as anevangelist.Mr. Sunday ca,me to Lexington yesterday morning, where he was entertamed by a visit to Man O'War, thefamous superhorse. There he wasmet by a reception committee composed of Paris ministers and broughtin an automobile to Paris. Rev. Mr.Sunday and his party were entertained at dinner at the WindsorHotel. Probably the largest crowdseen in Paris for many years greetedthe speaker when he arose to deliverhis address. From early dawn toabout noon when the big doors werethrown open to the public, there wasa constant stream 'of people and vcuuues en route to the bighouse.ware-At the place of speaking a largeplatform had been erected in thecenter of the south side of thehouse, and seats were arranged in a semi-circle aboutthis platform. Preceding the delivery of Mr. Sunday's address a program of musical selections were rendered by Mr. Roadheaver, Mr. Sunday's singer. Mr. Sunday was. intro-duced to the big audience by Re,vTheo. S. Smylie. pastor of the ParisPresbyterian church, in a short address. Mr. Sunday immediatelylaunched into his address, whichwas, of course, a characteristic Sunday speech. In the opening statements he spoke of the Bluegrass region, its pretty women and its finefarms, and said he had always had asoft spot in his heart for Kentuckyand its people. All through the address of three-quarters of an hour,Mr. Sunday used the gestures andquaint remarks that have made himfam'ous. His address was along thelines of those delivered in his Cincinnati engagement, and elicitedloud applause from his hearers.During the hours of the speakingand exercises nearly all the businesshouses of the city were closed, sothe employers and their helperaoculd hear the noted evangelist.Large .delegations from all the sur-rounding towns were here, coming ht sin- woridiy pleasures and selfrom every direction. Hundreds ofifV' , it to th Mm, andpeople waited in vain for a chanceto get in, but the house was packedto its capacity, and none would beadmitted.At the close of the address andtaking of an offering for the cause,Mr. Sunday and his party were takenin automobiles to the 3:20 Louisville& Nashville train, going to Cincinnati, where they continued the services in the big Tabernacle.The visit of Mr. Sunday to Parisas an entertainer than as an evangelist. Many, confessed to a distinctsense of disappointment; as theI speaker was apparently not at hisbest, suffering from a slight hoarseness. At any ratet will be a matterfor congratulation that the people ofthe city and county had an oppor-. tunity to see and hear hm.' NOTED MINSrREL, AL 0. EEELDSDEAD.Alfred Griffin, "Al. G."
