Electricity on War Vessels as an Auxiliary Is RecommendedWashington Oct 16 In his annualreport to the secretary of the navyChief Constructor Hichborn lays special stress upon the importance ofcontinuing the work of improving theplants at the various yards inviting particular attention to those atBoston and League Island A plantis also recommended at Algiers La aswithout it the new dock will be worthless when completedUnder the head of dry docks the report points out that the present building programme does not affect the twomost important navy yards viz NewYork and Norfolk at which a newdock of the largest size is urgentlyneeded in view of the rapid increase ofbattleships in commission Marinerailways also are said to be necessaryfor the economical handling of torpedo boats and two such are recommended at New York and one each atPortsmouth League Island NorfolkPort Royal and Mare IslandUnder the head of new constructionthe report sets out the fact that contracts for the more important shipsauthorized by the last congress couldnot be let because of the limitationplaced upon the cost of the armorNevertheless complete specificationsfor these vessels have been preparedand are included in the report Workon the design for gunboat 16 to replace the Michigan has been suspended pending definition of the characteristics that will be permitted under the treaty with Great

recommendation that thedepartment contract with the shipbuilder for the ship complete with armor instead of making separate contracts for the latterSome of the lessons of the war referred to in the report is the importance of sheathing ships as well asrestricting the use of combustiblematerial upon them and of fireproofing such material as must beused The severe tests applied bythe war to our ships under trying conditions of clintnte resultedsatisfactorily and little modification ofnew designs has been found necessaryThe extended use of electricity as anauxiliary is recommended and thebureau is making great progress inthis direction The present strengthof the corps of naval constructors issaid to be entirely insufficient and aconsiderable increase is suggested including an assistant chief of the bureauThe report closes with detailed statements from the constructors in chargeof the various navy yards of the workperformed and the plant necessaryA THREATENED LYNCHINGNegro

felt the arms of the woman 1 lovedclasped about me are to be recalled for onesself alone and concern none else besideOnce or twice 1 glanced down meeting hereyes and as she dropped her lids over themthey seemed to me to be alive with a softlight Alter a little I felt the arms beginning to relaxHold tight I saidI cannot my strength is goingCourage take heart see to our left isthe Tower of Magione a few minutes andWe are safeI drew her closer t ards me With aneffort she rallied her arms again tightenedin their clasp and we sped down the longslope which led to Trasimene Castorstretching himself like a greyhound Ilooked again over my shoulder Far behindmy men were riding for their lives and farther still was the dark line of our pursuerscoming on with dogged persistence the sunlighting up their armor and flashing fromtheir spears Once beyond Magione wewere comparatively safe but a false step astumble and all was lost Magione itselfwas held by the Baglioni and from the oldwatch tower built by the Sforza whichstood high above the country we might havealready been spied and a party sent out tointercept us The thought seemed to growinto a reality and a despair began to comeover me On on Castor I spoke to thegood horse and he laid his ears back at thesound of my voice and even as he did so Isaw a cloud of dust coming towards our leftand knew that the danger I feared was athand Going as we were I was riding rightinto the party from Magione and therefprewith a touch on the rein I swung Castoriound to the north and we raced on leaving the tower over my shoulder The doublefcurden and the tremendous pace howeverbegan to tell on the horse and within thenext five minutes he slackened perceptiblyin his stride To my horror I saw that theground began to be furrowed and cut up byravines and that we were approaching thebed of a river I had therefore to slackenthe pace and at the same time our new pursuers sighting us came on with all the speedof their fresh horses Castor scrambled inand out of the ravines like a cat but wewere going slowly now and the enemy ha 1all the advantage of the level ground to comeup which they did at a dreadful rate Withthe failing strength of my companion I darediot risk jumps weighted as 1 was but thebrave horse did his utmost as if knowingour dangerFor Gods sake hold on I cried out aswe topped a deep ravine with a plunge thatalmost caused Angiola to slip from my graspand as I said this 1 heard a shot and a ballfrom an arquebus whistle over my headThe enemy were in the rough ground nowthemselves but they were within gun rangeand I dreaded that some of them might dismount and pick me off This however didnot occur to them and on we went witheven now and again a bullet fired fromhorseback with an unsteady aim singingTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY TUESDAY OCTOBER 17 1899I past us My cfiarge had twisted her armsinto my shoulder belt and held on bravelyDut I saw by her white face and the bluecoming into her lips that this could not la3tand if she fainted there was an end of allAt the outside it was a matter of a fewminutes now one way or the other but asI came to the crest of another ravine I sawbefore me a steep bank leading down to asmall stream that was swishing along in awhite flood- azid on the opposite shore asight that made my heart leap for drawn upin array evidently roused by the sound ofthe shots was a strong body of men at armsand over them fluttered the pennon ofHawkwood a red hand on a white field 1knew in a moment we were within thekings outpostsSaved I shouted in my joy Savedand risking all I made the horse fly thelast ravine and the next instant we had sliddown the bank and the white water waschurning round Castor as he dashed into thestreamA puff of smoke above us a flash as oflightning a deafening roar and one of Xovarros nine pounders belched out a stormof grape that hissed over our heads in thedirection of our pursuers and stopped thembeaten and baffled One effort more Avewere out of the stream up the bank andpanting breathless and still bleeding withmy companion in a dead faint in my arms Ireined is Castor In a moment we were surrounded but the faces were kindly and dismounting slowly I placed my lifeless burden on a heap of cloaks that were flung tothe earth for her and then turning roundsaw Hawkwood before me It was the firsttime we had met since the affair at Arezzowhen I was cast forth a dishonored man Idid not know how to greet him and thenwas a constraint in his face for 1 saw heknew me and was like myself at a loss forspeech 1 had however to take the matterin my handSignore I said accept my thanksThis lady is the Countess Angiola Castellani a ward of the Florentine secretarywhom I have brought off from Perugia andhave to take to the convent oj St JeromeHe tugged at his tawny mustacheI have merely carried out orders youhave nothing to thank me for signore Myinstructions were to prevent any of Baglionis men crossing the Sanguinetta and toprotect ail fugitives from the territories olthe BorgiaI I lowed and added with a pain in mytone I could not conceal for this man wasonce my friendAll the same I thank you signore 1have however lour followersI can do nothing for thiin if they are onthe other bank he interrupted and wenton St Jerome is not a half league fromhere My men will make up a litter andhelp to bear the lady there It will beeasier for her 1 wish you a good day Hoturned on his heel and gave some orders tohis men in Fnglish a language I do notknow leaving me standing by the body ofAngiola All the misery of the past callback to me in a flash Would the stain neverbe wined out All the kindness I had received from Bayard and the cardinal all theefforts made by those who believed in meseemed to be swept away as dust in thewind Almost did I feel that I would accept the ban cast on me and turn wolf inearnest It cost me much to restrain myselffrom drawing on Hawkwood but a glanceat the still pale face before me recalled mcto my duty A man very kindly brought mea little wine 1 knelt down and forced someof it between her blue lips In a short timeshe revived some color came into her cheeksand she attempted to rise with a look offear on her face at the number of armedmen she saw around herThere is nothing to fear madam I saidto reassure her you are safe and in an hourwill be at St Jerome a litter is being madeready for youWithout a word she held out her handand thanked me with this and the look inher eyesThe litter was now ready half a dozenmen vountecred thvir services and placingher therein we star ed for the convent Erewe bad gone half a mile we heard shouts behind US and I wan more than glad to seeJacopo and my inc riding upHow did you gel off I asked as thejcame upIn the rear of tie troop from Magioneexcellency was Jacopos reply they didnot observe us having eyes only for youand seeing you were safe we forded thestream lower down and crossed but excellency your face are you hurtSomewhat but at St Jerome I will haveit attended toIn truth the left side of my face appearedto be laid open and although I felt thitthe wound was not so dangerous as itseemed yet 1 had bled freely and now thatthe excitement was over began to suffermuch pain Indeed at times I felt as if 1could hardly hold myself straight in the saddle succeeding in doing so only by an eilortof will I did not approach the litter 1 wasafraid that the sight of my face would alarmAngiola for now she was probably able tolook about her and see that which she hadnot been able to observe before Once however in a bend of the road that fortunatelywent to the left and hid my wounded sideour eyes met and 1 caught so bright a smileof thanks that it paid me for my hurt Ireined in for I knew my face showed toomuch and henceforth kept well behind 1sent Gian on to the convent with the goodnews of Angiolas rescue and on nearingthe gates was met by St Armande and therest of my followers whom I was glad indeed to seeHe came up with a merry greeting Welcome he cried so gallant knight youhave saved the damsel in distress thencatching sight of my wounded face his tonechanged Good G you are hurtA littleYou should have seen to it at oncecome we are not allowed to enter the convent but the abbess has done all she canfor us and we camp or lodge whicheverway jou put it in that house there hepointed to a small villa set in what seemeda wilderness of holm oak that hid all butits roof from viewNot so fast chevalier I must leave mycharge at the convent firstHe had to rest satisfied with this but Iwas surprised that he made no inquiry asto the condition of Angiola an ordinary civility that might have been expectedAt the gates of the convent within whichwe were not allowed to enter we were metby the lady abbess and her train I dismounted intending to assist Angiola out ofthe litter but as it was set down she sprangout of it of her own accord and the nextminute she was in the arms of the abbessand there was much kissing and many congratulations mingled with tears of joyI did not stay to receive the thanks I sawwould shortly be showered on me andthrusting a handful of crowns into the handof the leader of the good fellows who borethe litter as some reward for himself andhis men i looped Castors reins into my armand set forward to walk to the villa Thechevalier came with me and by the time Ireached it I was quite giddy being weakwith the pain and the loss of blood Thesaturnine eld abbe was there with moreconcern in his face than I had seen for along utae and seeing me stagger he put anf arm iTmnd me nnr tiMorl Kr fir A r ranAassisted me to a couch The chevalier himself dressed my wound with a gentle andskillful hand making as much of me as if Ihad been run through the vitals As he finished dressing the wound the abbe remarkedthat I would have to rest for a few days toenable it to heal and I had replied withsome difficulty my jaw being bandaged upthat this was impossible when Gian camein with a note It was from Angiola chiding me gently for not waiting to receive herthanks and those o the abbess and begging me to come the following day with apostscript to the effect that the lady abbesswould so far relax the rules of the order asto admit me within the courtyard 1 dismissed Gian with thanks and a message thatI would be at the convent charging him tosay nothing of my wound and then mythoughts went a wool gathering aud I layback with the missive in my hands St Armande was leaning against the window hisback to the light He had taken up this position after whispering a word or two to theabbe who left the room I did not howevW observe him or anything else my mindwas full of mad thoughts and for the moment I let them have full play making noeffort to resist Folding the letter up carefully I placed it under my pillow and wsabout to close my eyes when the abbe returned bearing a bowl in his hands ThisSt Armande took from him and approaching me saidCome cavaliere you must drink this atonceHis tone was sharp and incisive andlooking up in some surprise I saw he waspale to the lips and wondered what bee hadstung him I rose to a sitting posture totake the cup but he would not have it soand passing his arm round my neck mademe drink like a child The draught was cooland refreshing and as I sank back on my pillows my heart for a moment being gay atthe thought of the letter I said jestinglyChevalier you would make a most excellent nurse Shave off that little mmtache of yours put on a black hood andgown and diavolo But you would breakas many hearts as you cured wounds Thewords were barely out of my mouth whenhe brought his foot down with an angrystamp on the carpet and with a face asscarlet now as it had been pale beforeturned on his heel and walked out of theroomI looked to the abbe who was sittingwatching me stroking his chin with hishandst John But is he often taken thiswayThe cleric rose and not answering myQuestion spokeYou had better try and sleop now cavaliere or else the potion may lose its effectHe then followed St ArmandeI would have risen to apologize but I feltB pleasant numbness stealing over me and1 - SSWSS

the next morning my headwas -till dazed but I was otherwise strongAt least I felt so as I lay still in my bed allsense of fatigue gone and trying to collectmy thoughts After awhile I glanced roundthe chamber which was not the room whereI had taken the potion but another and alarger apartment It was no fancy thenthe voices of Jacopo and Bande Nere I heardand the sensation of being lifted and movedwhich 1 experienced in the night My removal was doubtless effected whilst I wasunder the influence of the drug but thevoice of madame The almost certaintythat she was by me through the hours of thenight I could not account for this andseeing any such effort was useless ceased torack my brain on the subject putting itdown to a mad dream For some while 1 laymustering up courage to rise fanned by themild breeze which played in from the openwindow on my right Outside I could seethe branches of the trees as they swayed toand fro in the wind and the joyous songof a mavis trilled out sweetly through themorning from the thorn bushes whence hepiped In about a half hour my head beganto grow clearer I remembered Angiolaaletter and thrust my hand under the pillowto find it Of course it was not there as 1had been moved and a short exclamation ofannoyance broke from meExcellencyIt was Jacopos voice and the good fellowwho had evidently been watching me cameforward from behind the head of the bedAh Jacopo Is it you He j help meto riseSignore but is your worship able thechevalierNever mind the chevalier I am as weas ever aud there was no need of that to doyesterday diavolo and a twinge in

the chevalier for hiskindness I was I saw still a little weakbut a few hours rest would make me fit foraction and I could not help thinking I hadbeen made much over on too small an occasion St Armande was in the room whereI had left the letter and at the first glanceI saw he was haggard and worn with darkcircles under his eyes eyes which manybeauty would have been proud to own Heseemed so slim so small and delicate as liecame to meet me that my heart began omisgive me again as to his powers to enduretiie labor involved in the difficult adventurewe had belore us He was much concernedat my having risen made many inquiresabout my condition and put aside mythanksPer Bacco chevalier I said you lookmore of an invalid than I 1 fear me 1shall have to be nurse in my turnIt is but a touch of

sending a civil message I retracecmy steps entering the villa by a side gateand walking towards it through a desertedportion of the garden I went leisurelystopping every now and again to admire theflowers and the trees In one of theserests whilst 1 idly gazed about me my eewas arretted by a number of fragments ofpaper that lay on the green turf at my feetYielding to an impulse I could not

the police found outall she bad done while in the countryAt first she was rather pleased atthe thought of how she would tell herfriends about It when she got homeBut when she found that she had topay

BOURBON NEWS PAPJS KY TUESDAY OCTOBER 17 1899HAT WAS NOT SUCCESSFULThe Owner Tried to Economize ButHer Efforts Met with Fearful ResultsThis is a plain unvarnished story ol rlady who trimmed her own hat Shwas endeavoring to economize and conceived the brilliant idea that by purchasing the trimmings and the frame she couldconstruct a hat that would be quite as hide-j ous as the ordinary or extraordinary millinery creation and at much less cost fcoshe made a dozen or more trips downtownand finally had gathered together a trunkroll of bits of rihbon steel buckles gauzedowers birds fiber chamois bolts rivetsbarbed wire varnish bicycle cement galvanized iron lincrusta walton and all thesingular ingredients of a womans hat together with a fearful and wonderful framethat looked much like ft wire waste basketafter a tug of war with a steam engineThen she haunted the display windows andchanged her mind something like a thousand times regarding the manner in whichshe would trim that hatShe sewed on and ripped off the birds sooften that they looked much bedraggledand were indeed very sad looking birdsbut she finally succeeded in assembling thehat and then as she was going on a visitto her mother and sisters who lived in asmall city she wore the magnificent creation calculating that they would go intoconvulsions over her hat And they didAfter they had kissed her several times andassured her of their undying love her mother who is a wise woman with a keen senseof the proprieties bade the elder of the unmarried sisters ring for the carriage Iam io glad to see my dear daughter shesaid that I must buy her something Nowvou drive down to the millinery store andbuy her the prettiest hat there before anyof her friends see herAnd after the economical daughter haddeparted
