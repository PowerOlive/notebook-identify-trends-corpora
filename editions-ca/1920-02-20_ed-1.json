The following resolutions were
passed by the Men's Bible Class of
the Christian Sunday School, at a
meeting held last Sunday:
Whereas, The management of the
Moving Picture Shows of our city
have indicated their intention of
operating the Picture Shows on Sun
day, and we realizing this to be a
violation of God's law and in strict
opposition to our many Churches
and Sunday Schools;
Therefore, Be It Resolved, By the
Men's Bible Class in regular session
by a unanimous vote. That we reg
ister our disapproval and protest
against such violations of the Sab
bath. Be It Further Resolved, That a
copy of this resolution be sent to
the City Council for their considera
tion, asking their co-operation in
stampine out such evils as Sunday
Movies, etc., which have' a tendency
to degrade, rather than be an uplift
to humanity in our midst.
