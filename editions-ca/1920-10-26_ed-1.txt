That school, as everyoneknows, had been conducted in ahighly successful manner by Col.Best for years, and attracted the attention of parents with boys to educate not only throughout the State ofKentucky, but in many other States.Those of us who made the fight forthe school felt that it was not only anasset and credit to our little town;but a credit and honor to BourbonCounty as well.Before, however, anyone dreamedthat Col. Best had any intention ofdisposing of his property and discontinuing his school, a tax was votedby the Millersburg District for thepurpose of establishing a High Schoolin Millersburg, and I was one ofthose who agreed and obligatedthemselves to subscribe, for the purpose of building that school, anamount equal to the amount raisedby taxation for that purpose.This arrangement was made withMr. J. B. Caywood, who at that timeSTILLTIME TO HELPCRATS WIN.DEMO-It is not too late to help the Democrats win the national election forthe principles of world peacetrue national honor. For more thana month the situation has improvediimmensely. The tide has been infavor of Cor and Roosevelt. Thosein charge of the Democratic campaign have been exerting every effort to ir-crea.se the tide and make itoverwhelming. Despite the ins'dvous propaganda . disseminated at acost of millions by the Republicans,the Democratic managers are certain the tide still flows in the direction of Cox and Roosevelt. But theyare not 'lessening .their efforts; theyare putting into the lasr. week'1:fight every bit of energy and determination they can command.The growing tide of sentiment infavor of the Democratic ticket isshown by increased voluntary financial support given the DemocraticNational Committee during the lastsix weeks.

This would have givenMillersburg two splendid schools,both of which were needed. The newschool in this way would have costmore than M. M.

Throughout the war he workedunremittingly and efficiently. Wecould depend upon him at any rimeof the day or night to help, in what'ever way he could help the cause ofAmerica in the great war. His workwas beyond any valuation that thos-ewho conducted the war could put upon it. His work was for the wholepeople and I-hope Kentucky will lecognize it by returning hipn. to theSenate."A prominent Democrat who heardSecretary Baker's statement addedthis comment; "Everybody who wain Washington during the war knowsthat Secretary Baker is speakmg-1nothing less than the truth. SenatorBeckham worked day and night odmilitary matters He was as well informed on these subjects as any legislator in Washington, but he had therare faculty of keeping his mouthf-hut about what he knew."Secretary Baker is in a position tcknow exactly what Senator Beck-harns service meant to me countryduring the war, and it is a pity thatmore of his constituents do notknowof his valuable work."DRIFT FROM THE REPUBLICANRANKS 'TO DEMOCRATICThe drift from Republican ranksinto the Democraticamong the influential pnen of the East continuesGeorgf White, Chairman of the Democratic National Committee gives tothe public the names of one hundredand twenty-one Republicans and BullMoosers who will, vote for Cox andthe League of Nations. In v givingtheir reasons for this position theseRepublicans say in part:"True Republican statesmanshipwould have welcomed and supportedthe Covenant, would have sought tostrengthen rather than to weaken itseffective guarantees against aggression. v It is now too late to talkof a new association of nations to becreated under Republican auspices.The proposal to ask forty-three othernations to scrap the existing league,enter another peace confeience andagree on some undefined experiment,can no longer be taken seriously.

Cox, Democratic Presidential nominee, for"betrayal of its mission" by publi-Jcation of unlabeled propaganda inthe interest of the Republican national candidate in the issbe of tl.emagazine which will appear nextThursday."Propaganda is not effective whenit is labeled, but in the guise offacts it strangles the truth andmoulds the minds into which it isintroduced as facts. The Americanpeople discovered this during the warand finally they put upon disloyalpropoganda the label which destroyed it."I am just now in possession of aspecimen of propaganda of thisvery sort. It is an advance copy ofthe Saturday Evening Post, knownto the great public as a disinterestedjournal. In all its history its statedpurpose has been to present the factsand atmosphere of political situations and to refrain from controversial position. In th:F spirit theSaturday Evening Post has been admitted as counsellor and friend intomillions of Ajmerican homes."But the number of this magazinewhich is to be distributed nexttThursday, the last number beforeelection, suddenly throws off thecloak of non-partisanship. For thefirst time in its history it resorts tothe devices of partisan editorialand insidious cartoon to create sentiment for the Republican ticket.In the cartoons I am representedas a newsboy inventing false andsensational happenings for the purpose of selling my wares. My opponent is depicted as kindly andwise. The impression is sought tobe created that I am irresponsible,Senator Harding grave and reliable.."Why has the Saturday EveningPost done this? Why has it betrayed its mission at the last minuteof the eleventh hour of this campaign? The people know theanswer."It has done this thing becauseits ownor is one of the plutocraticgroup which knows what it wantsof the nexi. administration and hovrto get it from the syndicate whichcontrols Senator Harding It hasdone this because its owner is thehead of ihe movement which hassought a subsidy from the government for the delivery of nationalmagazines."The Saturday Evening Post hasimposed on the confidence of tbcAmerican people, won by a long record of non-partisanship, and hasbecome a Republican journal because the profiteers who escape government taxes by diverting to itjmillions of their revenue in advertising want my opponents elected."Those sutscribeis, who in goodfaith have admitted this journal totheir homes til over the UnitedStates, will turn its venal coanselout of doors."Sinceritub-OTHES&.i, alert, hustlingciiapT are selectingthese model s shownabove, because theysay they were "especially made for them."p DEATHS.BRANNOGK.Mrs Elizabeth Brannock, agedtwenty-four, died at the iamily home-near Austerlitz, following an illnessof a few weeks.

Western Newspaper Union )The mother of Morton Dale enteredbis office, peered into his private room,tound it vacant and turned her gazeupon his stenographer, Irene Blandon,with some wonderment. The latter, ahandkerchief to her yes and, sobbinglow, had not noticed ber appearance.The sheet of paper on her typewriterbore evidence of tears."Why, Miss Blandon !" spoke the visitor gently, "whatever is the trouble?You are crying."Irene lifted a woeful face to thelady. "I couldn't help it, she spoke."You must know how things' are hereand I am so sorry for Mr. Dale.""Perhaps I do not entirely knowhow things are here, dear," said Mrs.D. "Of course Morton has told meof his misfortune in trusting a clientwith half his capital and the man investing it unfortunately and no chanceof recovering it.v But Morton is young,bright and honorable, the world-is allbefore him and it has greatly distressed me to see how hard he has takenit.""Mr. Dale was under a severe strainbefore that came," announced Irene."He put through a very creditable dealand counted on expanding kis business when this loss came along. Oh,Mrs. Dale ! can you not induce him toSeek and find what alone can savehim an entire abandonment of business cares for a spell? He is not ill,but mentally depressed. He has losthis nerve, as the men on 'change say,and he gets gloomier and more discouraged every day. Perhaps you wonder at my feeling over him, but I cameto the city knowing nobody and if Iwere his own sister he cuuld not havebeen more kind and helpful to me.Every time I write to the family athome, I am sure they bless him for theinterest he has taken in me and thegood position he has given me.''"You are a sweet, dear girl," saidMrs. Dale, her own eyes dimming."Tell me what you think we had oughtto do to win him from his apathy andgloom.""He must give up business for atime, that is sure," answered sensible,practical Irene. He bas a fine, sensitive nature and he is getting thin andtired all of the time. He needs building up, and oh! if he would only consent to do down to Waltham, where Icame from, and let mother and thefolks look after him and think of nothing but rest and recreation, he wouldsurely come back with renewed healthand courage."The sincerity and earnestpess of theyoung girl cbarmed the anxious mother. From the suggestion Irene madegrew definite plans. Morton Daleagreed to them, though with little interest in them, it seemed, and one dayleft for a month's vacation at Hollywood farm. It was not until he goj,away from the turmoil and grime ofthe city and the train glided alongpast fresh vrnal scenes and the flower perfumed air came in revivingly atthe open car window, that his perturbed mind began to calm down. In agentle, politic way those two lovingplotters had spent a week in winninghim to their suggestion. Now, feelinghow reliably Irene would attend to bibInterests and recalling that she wassacrificing her own vacation visit tothe folks at home for his sake,- a tender gratitude expanded his soul, temporarily clouded by his own selfish andexaggerated worries."She is like ray mother all gold!"Morton told himself, and when he arrived at Waltham he soon decided thatthere were others, too, of the homespun, but heartsome Blandon familywho were eligibles to be quoted in thesame precious metal category.Irene's two sisters were in evidenceoccupying a seat in the roomy old! sitting room, pictures of -health andjolliness. The brother, a Dig-nepuecifellow, always joking and laughing,hailed Morton as a bosom friend.When they reached the pjeasant oldfashioned -farmhouse Mrs., Blandonwelcomed their guest as 'an own son.The guest partook of the most enjoyable meal of weeks and slept with asmile on his lips, as through hisdreaming fancies ran shadowy echoesof some joke Wilfred Blandon narrated, or a fugitive thought of thebrave little helper he fcad left incharge of his business craft came tohis mind.Bluff, hearty Wilfred put himselfout to bring more cheerful state offeeling to the invalid, and was abetted by trusty accomplices. He evenhad the scale, at the general store manipulated, so that whenever Mortoncame in to get weighed he was 'foundto be gaining nearly a pound daily!One day some ruffians attacked afarmer on his way home with considerable money. Morton dispersed themin a way that won from the rescuedvictim admiring commendation for hisspryness and strength.At the end ot iy month, completelyrenovated, Morton Dale came home,the picture of jolly good health.
