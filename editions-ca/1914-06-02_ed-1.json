Acting on information of Charles L.
Dougherty, labor commissioner of Ok
lahoma, that from 12,000 to 15,000
men would be required to help har
vest and thresh the wheat crop in
that State, Secretary Wilson ordered
bulletins placed in postoffices through
out the country, describing Oklaho
ma's needs. Inquiry has been made
of State officials in Kansas, Nebraska,
North and South Dakota, Iowa, Wis
consin, Missouri and Minnesota, about
their requirements for extra help
during the harvest time. Commis
sioner Dougherty stated in a telegram
to Secretary Wilson that wages in
Oklahoma would be from $2 to ?2.50
a day with board, and that of the
12,000 or 15,000 men required for the
wheat harvest 85 per cent, would find
additional employment handling the
forage crops, promising four to six
months steady work.
