Notwithstanding these facts,however, the price is unusually low,only 25 and 30 cents having been paidfor the seed from the stripper, andabout 50 cents for the cured productfor August delivery. These low prices are owing to the fact that localdealers have such large quantities ofold seed in storage and have not thehousing capacity for greatly increasedsupplies.One local seedman, N. Ford Brent,has bought the distillery plant in EastParis, known as the G. G. White Distillery, consisting of six large warehouses, for the storage of seed andgrain, and it is probable that otherswill be obliged to build additional1 storage room.POPULAR BOURBON COLLEGEGIRL ELECTED TEACHER.Miss Rubywett Redwitz, of Harrodsburg, has been elected as teacherof Piano and Voice of K. -C. and B.College, of North Middletown.
