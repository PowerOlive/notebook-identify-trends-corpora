NOVEL ENTERTAINMENT
ItWas Provided by a St Lonla Man For
His Wifes Feminine Friends
A wealthy St Louisan living in the
vicinity of Lafayette park provided a
novel form of entertainment for his
wifes gnests one evening says the St
Louis Republic
The hostess was extremely anxious to
provide something original for the edi
fication of a score of guesta whom she
intended to oall together for an informal
evening Her husband promised to pro
vide such novelty and took a boon com
panion into his confidence to that end
They had not - exchanged ideas 80 con
secutive seconds before they hit upon
the device of converting the elegant
parlors into a gambling houBe pro tern
A faro bank a roulette wheel and po
ker and keno lay outs were easily pro
curable as the conferees well knew
and that part of the programme was
soon settled The friend suggested as a t
pretty epilogue the introduction of a
pair of bulldogs guaranteed to reduoe i
each other to mince meat in three
rounds This rather staggered the ambi
tious host but his friend is a ward poli
tician and with the eloquence he always
keeps on draft soon convinced the other
that the evening would be a failure
without those bulldogs
The evening arrived and with it came
the guests The ladies were prettily
shocked at sight of the gambling para
phernalia but became accustomed to it
in an astonishingly short time and shar
ed in the games with becoming vim It
was when the yellow bulldogs made
their unexpected entrance that the hor
ror of the fair guests proved genuine
The beasts yelped and growled and
showed other peculiarly canine symp
toms of spoiling for a fight There
upon the ladies sought refuge on the pi
ano and card tables and chairs con
ducting their retreat as from a mouse
Notwithstanding excited feminine
protestations the friend who had been
consulted as to a novelty in entertain
ment unleashed the dogs It vrns an ex
citing climax to an original evening
The dogs feasted for fiva minutes on
choice bits of each other- anatomy
The ladies soreamed and the friend who
was consulted exulted in the success of
bis novelty When he was quite con
vinced and it took a considerable time
to convince him that the ladies deaire
for gore had been fully gratified he
doused the dogs into a convenient tub
of water and separated them
Animal Kindergarten
It will be noticed that all creatures
which have large families whether
beasts or birds have less trouble in rear
ing them than those which have only
one or two young Little pigg are weeks
ahead of calves in intelligence and the
young partridge with its dozen brothers
and sisters is far more teachable than
the young eagle There seems no doubt
that the latter is taught to fly by its
parents A correspondent informs the
writer that he has watohed the old
birds so engaged and the young eagles
reluctantly following them to a height
Specialized education in animalB be
gins late The beaver kittens training
does not begin until the autumn of the
year in which it was born The old
beavers which have moved up tributary
streams into the woods or roamed to
the larger lakes during summer then
return to inspect their dam and repair
it for the winter They then cut down
a few trees and dividing them into
logs roll them or tow them to the dam
The kittens meantime are put on to
what in a workshop would be called a
soft job They cut all the small
branches and twigs into lengths and do
their share of light transport service
In the mud patting and repairing of the
dam the beaver kittens take their share
but there is little doubt that they do so
because their elders are so engaged It
is a kindergarten of the best kind be
cause mud patting and stick cutting are
a great joy and solace to old beavers as
well as young ones and so instruction
pleasure and business are all combined
Young otters and probably also young
water rats have to be taught to go into
the water According to the observa
tions of Mr Hart the late head keeper
at the zoo the young otters born there
did not enter the water for weeks and
even then their mother had to mind
them and fetch them out when she
thought they had had enough of it
They swim naturally when once in the
water and this seems true of all ani
mals London Spectator
Chivalrous Mr Fields
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps in her book
Chapters From a Life pays the fol
lowing tribute to James T Fields
Mr Fields was a man of marked
ohivalry of nature and at a time when
it was not fashionable to help the move
ments for the elevation of women his
sympathy was distinct fearless and
faithful In a few instances we knew
and he knew that this fact deprived
him of the possession of certain public
honors which would otherwise have
teen offered to him
He advocated the political advance
ment of our sex coeducation and kin
dred movements without any of that
apologetic murmur so common among
the half hearted or the timid His fas
tidious and cultivated literary taste was
sensitive to the position of women in
letters He was incapable of that liter
ary snobbishness which undervalues a
womans work because it is a womans
A certain publishing enterprise which
threatened to treat of eminent men
came to his notice He quickly said
The time has gone by for thatl Men

A FIGHT WITH A LYNX
Jim Berry Had a Desperate Struggle Witk
a Savage Bobcat
The ugliest appearing animal that
ever walked a log killed a rabbit or
fought a trap is the lynx which is just
as ugly as it looks ten months in the
year and somewhat uglier during the
other two Not only will the lynx fight
anything that walks the woods but it
will also tackle a visitor from the clear
ings be he man or dog or half grown
calf if the occasion offers
Jim Berry was hunting up in jMaine
about 40 miles north of Greenville
when he and his friend suddenly came
upon the carcass of a caribou whioh a
bear was eating The bear made itself
scarce much to Jims regret as he
wanted to kill the bear Without say
ing anything to his friend he left camp
the next day and started for the carcass
intending to watch it in the hope that
the bear would return He waited and
watched until about 8 oclock in the
afternoon when he began to think of
returning to camp A soft footfall baok
in the woods the orafty step of some
wild animal just then sounded in his
ears Pretty soon the bear was chewing
the caribou meat and Jim could see it
plainly He leveled his buckshot gun
and pulled the trigger when the wab
bling muzzle was pointed in what he
thought was the right direction The
beast went down and Jim started for it
Then he stopped with his mouth open
The beast had leaped to his feet and
jumped sideways with its back up
Jim knew the yell and he also reoog
nized the humped back It was a wound
ed lynx spoiling for a fight Not having
time to level his gun to shoot the man
clubbed it and the blow stunned the
cat a little but the beast got in a rake
on the mans leg and tore his trousers
and hide too Another frantic sweep of
the gun barrel laid the beast flat and
then a revolver bullet killed the animal
The buckshot had torn the top of the
lynxs head enough to make it angry
Shooting and Fishing
Proved His Hova
They were two working girls and
they happened to meet the other day at
the restaurant where they eat luncheon
The brunette ordered baked beans and
lemonade and the blond selected fruit
cake and coffee Tomorrow is pay day
you know she said in reply to the
inquiring look of the other
Oh Well have you heard the news
about Mary Shes resigned
I know said the blond I was in
hopes Id be the first to tell you Shes
going to be married
Yes in a lovely blue silk I forget
the name of the man shes going to
marry He isnt very good looking they
say but Mary says hes intellectual
She says
Oh pshaw You cant tell from
Mary
No but Sadies seen his photo
graph and she says he wears glasses
Does her Well Marys lucky if she
is redheaded Why he would just do
anything in the world for that girl
Humph said the brunette Thats
the way she talks now but you cant
tell a thing about it until after theyre
married
You can tell it easy enough in this
case Hes proved it already said the
blond warmly
Said hed die for her I suppose
returned the brunette scornfully Lots
of em talk that way before they have
to pay the butcher
This isnt talk anyhow Hesproved
his love I tell you
How Did he save her life or tell
her that her hair is golden
Neither He sold his bicycle to buy
her an engagement ring Chicago
Tribune
A Strange Nursery
On the slopes of the Himalayas the
native women have a most curious plan
of disposing of their babies and keeping
them quiet while they are engaged at
work in the fields during the greater
part of the day Before the mothers set
out to work in the morning they wrap
their babies in swaddling barids leav
ing nothing but their little faces ex
posed Then the babies are taken and
laid under a ledge of rock from which
water is falling and by means of a
bamboo the water is made to drip gen
tly on each babys forehead The effect
of the dripping water is most soothing
and soon the little ones are all asleep
and remain motionless till taken up by
their mothers on their return from their
work when they are carried off to be
unwrapped dried and fed

THE DEACONS DONATION
And Wky It Was Not Accepted by te
Town Committee
It had been decided at a public meet
ing of the citizens they that would have
a combination library reading room and
sooial club in Wampton The commit
tee made up of substantial members of
the community authorized to act upon
their own judgment was in session at
Deaoon Closes he having a site that he
wanted to sell for the proposed building
I regard this movement as deserving
of popular approval and aid said the
minister It aims to secure a wider
intelligence and a better tone of morali
ty among our people Every one should
give according to his means
After theditor the doctor and the
banker had talked in the same vein the
lawyer proposed that they get down to
business Deaoon Olose he contin
ued has a desirable lot for which he
asks 2 000 It strikes me as a pretty
stiff price but I have no doubt that he
will make us a donation of 500 and
make a deed of the site for 1500
There was applause in which the
deacon did not participate but rising
reluctantly he delivered himself as fol
lows I must say that I agree with
what has been said in praise of this en
terprise Our town needs it and there
is no place for it more desirable than
the lot I have offered Of course I want
to bear my full share of the expense
Since I offered you this lot the
deacon went on there has been a great
improvement in times Money is easier
prices are better and realty gets an en
hanced value because of the general
prosperity I will let you have the lot
for 2500 and throw off 500 as a do
nation
The minister muttered something he
was glad the rest did not hear The
doctor laughed the banker scowled and
the lawyer moved to adjourn in a voice
that told the deacon he would have to
seek some other market for the lot that
had taken such a long and sudden jump
in value Detroit Free Press
THEY DO NOT SIT
Some Birds That Hatcli Their Eggs by
Quer Xvioa
It is well known that the Australian
megapod is a bird that is accustomed to
sit on its eggs In certain parts of Aus
tralia are found numerous mounds of
considerable size and height which the
first explorers took to be burial grounds
These were made by the Megapodius
tumulus which uses them for hatohiug
its eggs They have sometimes consid
erable dimensions A nest that is 14
feet high and 55 feet in ciroumferenoe
may be regarded as large
Each megapod bulds its own nest
with material whioh it gathers from all
sides and these are exactly what the
gardener uses in the month of March to
make his forcing beds namely leaves
and decomposing vegetable matter
whioh by their fermentation give off
an appreciable amount of heat In the
forcing beds this heat hastens the sprout
ing of the seeds In the nest it suffices
for the development and hatching of the
young birds and the mother can go
where she likes and occupy herself as
she wishes without being troubled by
the duties of sitting
In the small island of Ninafou in
the Pacific another bird has a some
what similar habit in so far as it also
abandons its eggs but in place of ob
taining the necessary heat from fer
mentation it gets it from warm sand
The leipoa or native pheasant of Aus
tralia acts like the megapod and watch
es the temperature of its mound very
closely covering and uncovering the
eggs several times a day to cool them
or heat them as becomes necessary Aft
er hatching the young bird remains in
the mound several hours It leaves on
the second day but returns for the
night and not until the third day is it
able to leave for good the paternal abode
