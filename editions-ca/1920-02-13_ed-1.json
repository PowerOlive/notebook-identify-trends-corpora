For Nearly Three Years He Was
Unable To Do a Day's Work.
" Feels Fine Since Taking
Tanlac.
"My L.iother was even in a worse
fix than I was and 1 can tell you
that was pretty bad, but Tanlac has
put- us both in good shape," said
Albert J. Helfert, of 2009 Venable
street, Uichmond, Virginia, while
discussing the medicine, recently.
Mr. Helfert was born and reared
in Richmond, where he has followed
liis trade as brick anason forvthirty
years. He has helped to build
many of the large brick buildings
erected in Richmond during tb.6 past
quarter century. Mr. Helfert
stands bigh in the Brick Mason's
Union," is also a leading member of
the Richmond Eagles, Lodge No. 1,
and is highly respected by all who
Irnow him.
"Regardless of exposure to all
iinds of weather," explained Mr.
Helfert. "I have always enjoyed
very good health until three years
ago. At that time I began to have
pains in my back and joints which
kept getting worse in spite of all I
oould do. Well, I found it was
rheumatispi that had me in its grip
and I finally got to where it was
agony for me to move. My back and
"knees hurt me so bad that I could
hardly .lift trowel and brick.
'I actually dreaded to go on a
job, I ached so bad. and had just
about decided to give up my work
when a friend persuaded me to try
Tanlac, saying it had relieved him
of the same trouble and put him on
his feet in good shape. That very
same day I went to the drug store
and got a bottle of Tanlac. I -had
tried all kinds of liniments and
medicines without results, but Tan
lac helped me from the start and by
the time I had finished my fourth
bottle I was like a new man. I was
able to go on the job and do a full
tiay's work for the first time in
nearly three years. At present I
am as well as I have ever been in
jmy life and I mean to say by that, I
haven't an ache or a pain of any
iin. ,
"My mother had sufiered from
jh'eumatism for a number of years
and even worse than I did. She had
if so bad at times ?he couldn't
cross the room without holding on
to the chairs and bed. When she
saw what Tanlac had done for me
she began talcing it and to-day she
is getting around as well as if she
wasn't more than twenty years of
age. Her friends all sec,m astonish
ed at her wonderful improvement
and she never gets tired telling
about Tanlac. Knowing what I do
about Tanlac. since it has done so
much for mother and myself I am
glad to show my appreciation by
giving this statement for the benefit
pothers who need just such a med
icine." Tanlac is sold in Paris by the
Peoples rkuvnacy. j - (adv)

It can be attested by Paris resi

street, says: "Kidney trouble came
on from a fall and the results were
very severe, causing me more suf
fering than the fall itself. No one
can ever know what I went through
at that tijme, for I suffered awfully.
My back ached and pained until I
thought it would break in two.
Sharp twinges shot through my
kidneys, and if anyone had hit me
in the back with a heavy axe, it
could not have hurt worse. In one
week after using Doan's Kidney
Pills, I felt like a different woman,
for they fixed me up in fine shape."
After a lapse of eight years, Mrs.

been permanent."

SMITH.
Two members of the same fam
ily dying within a short time of each
other, from the same disease, is the
crushing blow that came in the fam
ily of Mr. and Mrs. Jos. A. Sjiiith,
of near Paris, Tuesday morning.
Sam Smith, aged twenty-one, was
the first to succumb to the disease,
pneumonia, his death taking place
at 10:30 Tuesday morning, after an
illness of but a few days. His
.'younger brother, Wilson Sjmith,
w-ho had been taken ill about tne
same tjma with the sajme disease,
died at 2:30 o'clock Tuesday after
noon. Neighbors were unaware for
some time of the state of affairs at
the Smith home, as there was no tel
ephone in the house and no commu
nication was had until Mr. Smith
himself sent word to the closest
neighbors of the visit of the death
angel to his home. The young men
had been attending school, but were
advised to remain at home until
they recovered from severe colds
thej' had contracted. They were
both, popular and highly . regarded
in their community. Five other
members of the srine family who
have been very ill of influenza at
the family home, on the Lew Taylor
farm, on the, Jackstown pike, near
Paris, are recovering. The death
