Fromevery viewpoint the second day was asuccess, both as a day of splendid exhibitions and for the most brilliantgathering ever seen on the grounds ona similar occasion."The .attendance yesterday eclipsedthat of a year ago and was far in excess of the second day two years ago.This was probably due to the fact ofthe prevailing weather conditions onthe opening day of the fair when onlya tew hours before the opening of thegates heavy rains fell which had theeffect of keeping a large number awayon the opening day but yesterday madeup for the deficiency in the way of attendance, The events postponed from Mondayon account of the condition of the showjriug, were taken up the first thingyesterday morning, and before theI close of the day the entire program,iboth the uostDoned events and theprogram of yesterday were completed.I The principal ring of the morningcame under the harness horse classwhen Allie Jones, of North Middletown, and Matlack & Shropshire, ofWinchester, matched their famousshow horses, Roberta and Jackstraw,in the ring for this class. Robertacame out with the blue tie with thebeautiful Jackstraw a close second.The colt show brought out six entries all of which showed up to thebest advantage. The premium forthis event was awarded to W. E.Speakes & Bro., of this county, ontheir undefeated show colt, MildredKing, which took the blue ties at boththe Blue Grass and Capitol fairs. Sanford Carpenter and Wm. Sanders, ofMillersburg, came in' for second andthird respectively.In the harness class for stallions offour years old and over, Allie Jonespitted Marvel King against Collins &Redman's great show stallion, TeddyRoosevelt. These were the only twoentries in this class and the firstpremium was awarded to Marvel Kingwhile Teddy Roosevelt drew the second.The rings for harness ponies broughttogether eight stylish performers,among them being L. L. Haggin'sfamous show pony which took a premium at the London, England, horseshow. The contest finally dwindleddown between Mr. Haggin's entry andthat of Walter Warren, of Lexington,the former receiving the first premium. A feature which has attracted largely year after year was the baby show,and this brought out six handsome boybabies under eighteen months old.Mrs. Wm Talbott, Mrs. Frank Clayaid Mrs. Thos. Clay acted as judges.The following babies were entered inthe contest: James and Charles, sorsof Mr. and Mrs. H. B. Rose,12 months ;Wm. K. Dudley, son of Dr. and Mrs.W. K. Dudley, 14 months; son of Mr.and Mrs. Herman Blackerby, of thecounty, 14 months; Oscar Louis Hume,son of Mr. and Mrs. D. Hume, 18months; Crowmell C. Cleveland, Jr.,son of Mr, and Mrs. Crowmell C.Cleveland, aged 16 months; son of Mr.and MraohnCain. son of Mr. and Mrs.E. F. well, of Little Rock. Theijudges finally reached a decision andawarded the premium to the little sonof Mr. and Mrs. Crowmell C. Cleveland. Today is expected to be the bannerday of the week of the fair in point ofattendance and features. The principal event will be the sweepstakes forahrness horse, and will bring togethersome of the best blood in the country.This premium of $200 is a special bythe directors of the Bourbon CountyAgricultural Society and is dividedinto four parts. Following aretyesterday's awards :mmSvtzSvtUVVisIn the first game of the championship series ot the Blue Grass Leagueat Winchester Wednesday afteinoon,Paris came out the victor, winning aclose and exciting game by the scoreof two to cne. The contest was apitchets' battle between Shears furPans and Burden for the Hustlers inwhich the former excelled. ,McKernan chose Shears to pitch the!opener because of his performance"against the Hustlers last Saturday in,the contest which resulted in a cofriplete blanking for Coleman and hismen and the big sidewheeler showedhis class in the opening tilt. , -Burden showed signs of returning tohis old time form but he was notequal to the determined Bo'irbcmteswho laid onto hi3 slants for ten safebinglcs. Heretofore the Hustler mainstay has been very effective againstParis, and his stiikeouts were numerous but on this occasion he whiffed butthree of the locals, while Shears fan-Jned an even half dozen of the opposing!batters.The Bourbonites put up a fast fielding game, and while the Hustlers hitthe ball hard and frequently, it wasrdifficult for them to get their drives!beyond the reach of the Paris fielders JThe first run of the game came in'the second session. Maxwell, the first?ud. sent a stinging drive through the,Ditcher's box and was advanced to the.second station by Kuhlman's sacrifice.Chapman singled to the center garden;and Shears sent a short fly to the rightfield, Brown, Walsh and Lake makingan effort to get the ball, which fell-safely, Maxwell scoring. Harrell lined,to Olson who doubled Chapman at second. Harrell's steal, Laross' error and.McKernan's single in the fifth, put acrimD in the Hustlers, when anotherrun was pushed over the rubber. Chapman bounced one to Burden and Shears.rolled one down the third base line to"!Goosetree and was out..
