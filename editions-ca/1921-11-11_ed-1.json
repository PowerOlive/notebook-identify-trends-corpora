A few cases of diphtheria having
developed, the school is taking steps
to get the disease under control' be-j
fore. reaching the stage of an, epl
demis. At the request of the school
the State Board of Health sent Dr.
McCracken, of Louisville, who gave
the Schick test to 200 pupils. The
test will show how many pupils are
susceptible to the disease. This is
normally about 25 per cent. The
test will be followed by a treat
ment that makes patients immune
