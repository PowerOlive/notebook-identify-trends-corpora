One Divided by Naught
Four men sitting together were con
fiding to one another their general ig
norauce of the mattercontained in text
books One said he had studied algebra
for three years but ho would find it
impossible to solve the simplest prob
lem by an algebraic process Another
said he had been counted a good student
in geology and yet he doubted if he
could name the principal periods in
their proper order
Now lets see how much you do
know said one of the men How
much is one divided by naught or
nothing
One divided by nothing repeated
the man at his right Why thats
one If one isnt divided by anything
it remains one
I think the answer is nothing
said another One divided by nothing
is nothing Sure thats right
Youre the worst I ever heard
said the man who had given the prob
lem One divided by nothing that
means how many times is nothing con
tained in one It is contained an infinite
number of times and the correct an
swer is infinity
Then he had to talk to them for five
minutes in order to convince them
Chicago Record
The Heliograph
With all its superiority in distances
the heliograph is too uncertain for sole
reliance A passing cloud is sufficient
to interrupt the clearest signals per
haps in the critical moment of a battle
or a sun haze may render invisible the
rays from the largest mirror so that at
any time without a clear atmosphere
the system isuseless
It is not known that the heliographio
system has ever been in use on ship
board and the sea service has nothing
for daylight signaling that approaches
its accomplishment in dry atmospheres
For night service at sea the flashlight
appears to be the best system of signal
ing in all weathers though on rare oc
casions the long beam of the electric
searchlight thrown up on the sky has
proved effective for communication
when it was possible by no other means
An instance of such use was reported a
few years aco by two British ships
which while on opposite sides of a high
promontory nine miles in width opened
communication with each other by
means of dot and dash flashes on the
sky from their searchlights Lippin

Gladstones Doings and Undoings
Mr Gladstone began as the defender
of the Irish church he ended by de
molishing it No one ever opposed more
vehemently the extension of British in
fluence in Egypt but it was under his
government we bombarded the Alexan
drian forts fought the battle of
and reduced Egypt to the condi
tion of a British satrapy He was the
most conspicuous advocate of peace
with Russia when Lord Beaconsfield
was in office until Constantinople was
in danger Five years later he left
office after having brought us to the
very verge of war with Russia for the
sake of Penjdeh One year he clapped
Mr Parnell into prison the next he
proposed to make over to him the gov
ernment of Ireland and then again he
deposed him fromthe leadership Yet
he was always consistent and anxious
for his consistency Circumstances alter
cases and Mr Gladstone was not above
being taught by events W T Stead
in Review of Reviews
True to Principles
A New South Wales country school
teacher recently gave a boy a question
in compound proportion for home work
which happened to include the circum
stance of men working ten hours a
day in order to complete a certain
work Next morning the unsuspecting
teacher in looking over the little pack
of exercises found Jims sum unafc
tempted and the following letter in
closed in the page

or Government Money
At close of our Civil War in 1865
there appeared in the London Times
the following
If that mischievous financial pol
icy which had its origin in the North
American Republic during the late
Civil War in that country should be
come indurated down to a fixture
then that government will furnish its
money without cost It will have all
the money that is necessary to carry
on its trade and commerce It will
become prosperous beyond precedent
in the history of civilized nations of
the world The brain and wealth of
all countries will go to North America
THAT GOVERNMENT MUST BE
DESTROYED OR IT WILL DE
STROY EVERY MONARCHY ON
THIS GLOBE
The famous Hazzard circular to
capitalists in New York andtheBuell
Bank circular to United States Bank
ers both emanating from Londonand
the fabulous corruotion fund raised in
England and Germany estimated at
1500000 were the agents that se
cured the closing of our mints against
silver
The walk into my parlor policy
of England during and since the
Spanish War is the latest evidence
of English Diplomacy in shaping the
destiny of the United States Govern
ment
Notwithstanding the famine price
of wheat the Spanish War3 and fabu
lous expenditures of money by our
government during the past year gold
has increased in value eleven per cent
and all other values decreased in the
same proportion
For a thorough understanding of
the money question or silver issue
the Cincinnati Enquirer has uniformly
given evidence of its ability to teach
explain and produce all facts and
truth It is a paper that ought and
can be read by all classes with pleas
ure and profit
