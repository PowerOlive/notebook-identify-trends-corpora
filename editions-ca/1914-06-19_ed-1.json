That "25 per cent, law" the liquor

In Hodgenville, Mr. Beckham finds

LUCIEN BECKNER WILL BE
PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATE.
After a conference of Progressives
at Lexington, Wednesday, it was de
cided to put up a Progressive candi
date for Congress in this, the Seventh
district, and Hon. Lucien Beckner, of
Winchester, formerly editor of the
Winchester Sun, having consented to
make the race, was selected as the
candidate.
Mr. Beckner prepared his petition,
signed by voters of Fayette and Clark
counties, and it was forwarded to the
Secretary of State, at Frankfort.
Mr. Beckner is a son of the late
Judge William M. Beckner. He is a
lawyer, who has for several years
been a member of the Winchester
bar. For several years he editedthe
Winchester Sun, but recently severed
his connection with that paper and
purchased the Citizens' Printing Com
pany, in Lexington.

pression that Mr. Smith had introduc
ed Stanley and was his supporter for
the long term.
BECKHAM IN BARREN COUNTY.
Former Governor' Beckham had a
big day in Barren County. He ad
dressed an "enormous crowd 'at Glas
gow and a big enthusiastic gathering
at Cave City. At Cave City he was
introduced by Virgil Baird, one of
Glasgow's most prominent Democrats.
There is no doubt that Mr. Beckham
will carry the county by a majority
of 1,200 or over. His speeches were
along the usual lines at both Glasgow
and Cave City, and the manner in
which they were received attested the
former Governor's popularity.
AT MUNFORDVILLE.
Former Governor Beckham spoke at
Munfordville, Tuesday, to one of the
lagest and most enthusiastic audien
ces that has attracted a political
meeting in the county in a long time.
The former Governor presented his
claims for the Senate in a clear, con
cise manner and defined the issues of
the campaign in a way that won him
much applause. He heartily indorsed
President Wilson and the National ad
ministration and expressed his strong
approval of- the county unit law as
amended. He made an attack on the
"liquor trust" and its part in the poli
tics of Kentucky and said Representa
tive Stanley was closely allied with
the combination. Gov. Beckham was
introduced by D. W. W. Bowling, one
of the best known Democrats in Hart
County and a veteran of Morgan's
command, and he gave Gov". Beckham
the highest praise. There is no doubt
that the former Governor will carry
the county by a large majority. Hart
has always been for him and it is now
stronger in his behalf than ever before.
MR. BECKHAM'S CAMPAIGN.
The liquor agents and organs are
not satisfied to- let the question of
State-wide prohibition rest where it
was placed by the Legislature. In
reporting Governor Beckham's cam-
paign they falsely state that he has .

Judge Stout is one of the leaders
of the anti- Cantrill faction in the
Seventh Kentucky District, and is
everlastingly opposed to the renomi
nation of Representative Cantrill. His
presence here at a time when the Na
tional leaders of the 'dry' forces are
meeting here suggested a possibility
that the contest for the Congressional
nomination between Cantrill and
Claude M. Thomas, his Democratic
opponent, may soon take on a nation
al aspect.
"Cantrill is leading the fight in the
House against the Hobson national
prohibition resolution."
