county east and west for 20 mileswas flooded and the damage will beenormous the railroads being theheaviest losers The Erie railroadwest of Warren 14 miles and north ofSharon the same distauce wasentirely flooded out and orderswere issued to discontinue alltrains Many residence here wereflooded out and the occupants weretaken away by the police and tire departments The Mahoning Valleyelectric lines were flooded out and allthe bridges washed away The Catholic church at Niles was struck bylightning at the same hour and nearlydestroyed by fire while businesshouses and manufacturing concernswere flooded out Henry Myersa tailor while stauding at his residence on Mill street was struckby lightuing aud killed instantly Heleaves a family The excursion trainswhich left here Thursday morning forlake Erie are all side tracked 30 milesout and will probably not reach thecity Thursday night On every railroad leading into the city comes reports of extensive washouts andbridges swept away aud railroad officials say the loss will be the heaviestthey have ever knownAt 1080 Thursday night came thefirst tangible information of the damage done by the storm Along Crabcreek running into the city in thenorthwest along the Erie and LakeShore railroads and emptying into theMahoning river near the Lake Shoredepot a cloudburst occurred about tenmiles out and the water did not begin to rise much in the city untilafter nine oclock At about tenoclock the water came down the valley into the city and formed into aflood sweeping everything that wasnot fastened down before it The bedof the creek was not more than than20 feet wide and the flood spread outto a width of about 2000 feet It rosequickly and in less than 30 minutesthe water was up to the secondstory of all the dwelling houses inthe flooded districts and was stillrising It is a certainty at 11oclock that some of the peopleescaped from the houses The wholedistrict was covered with darkness except one small place where a lone electric light shone Firemen police andothers were on hand quickly but werepowerless to rescue anybody as not aboat of any kind was to be had in thatportion of the city The cries of thepeople in the houses were heartrending to those who stood atthe waters edge and were forcedto retreat slowly on account of thegradually rising water It is almost acertainty that many people weredrowned one whole family was heardcrying for help from upstairs windowswhen suddenly there was a grindingnoise as if the house was being movedfrom its foundation and soon the criesfrom that place ceased The intensedarkness made it impossible to seewhat was going on but it supposedthe house and its occupantswent down in the flood Peopleat the waters heard a man crying forhelp who was apparently being carried down in the flood The voice grewfainter and it is supposed the unfortunate perished Pitiful cries for helpwere heard continually but the crowdon the shore could do nothing in theway of giving aid Police and firemenwent at once to another part of thecity after boatsIt was midnight before boats weregotten to the flooded Crab creek district and the work of rescue could bestarted The boats were manned byfiremen who went to work with a willbut could not make rapid progress onaccount of the swift and dangerouscurrent Nine families were taken outof second story windows within a halfhour and many people were pickedup clinging to debris Nothingdefinite will be known as to the loss oflife till morning or even the names ofpeople that are in the flood and perhaps not then as there were severalthoroughfares through the floodeddistrict on which there are usuallypeople at all hours of thenight At midnight the water commenced to recede rapidly and thecreek will likely be back in itsnatural course by morning TheErie and Lake Shore trains including passenger and excursion trainswere stopped where they were caughtand will not likely be moved beforedaybreak as the officials refuse totake chances of loss of life Loaded carshave been placed on bridges with thehope of keeping them up as the Mahoning river is high and rising rapidJySheop for the Gold MinersPort

aparty of Americans to first visit theKlondyke country returned Fridayand tells a story of horrors and starvation seldom equaled even in modernnovels He describes Klondyke as aplacer camp seven miles long and 13miles wide located in a sink andwalled in by boulders of rocks 3000feet high Gold he says abounds butno ordinary man can stand the hardships of the uncivilized region WhenMoss left here four years ago he wasLr I NpM FV JTl JMAP OF ALASKAShowing Klondyke and Other Gold Fieldsa sturdy fellow over six feet tallFrom hardships and privation he isa cripple for life and badly broken inhealth In three years he saw over8000 graves made in the Klondykubasin a large majority dying fromstarvation The steamship companiesbring in all food and allow no privateimportation Consequently it is notuncommon to go for weeks with but ascant supply and for days entirelywithout food The gold brought inlast week to Seattle Moss says doesnot represent the findings of individualshippers but a large proportion wasconfiscated from the effects of those2000 miners who fell a prey to thehardships At the death of a man possessed of dust his body was buriedwithout a coffin and the dust dividedamong those who care for him Withproper reliefs established by the government Moss says gold can be takenout at the rate of 2 000000 a monthThe richest strike has been made bya 21-year-old boy named George Hornblower of Indianapolis In the heartof a barren waste known as Boulderfield he found a nugget for which thetransportation company gave himS5700 He located his claim at thefind and in four months took out over100000The richest section of Alaska Mosssays is yet undeveloped It is 100miles from Klondyke and known asBlack Hole of Calcutta It is inhabited by ex convicts of Bohemia andmurders and riots take the place oflaw and orderA few months ago Klondyke organized a justice committee and its lawprevails their nowWith the great crowds preparing togo to the scene now Moss says hungerand suffering will be great whenadded to other hardships -to be overcome by those who survive Moss returned with S6000 in dust and leavesSaturday for his old home at Dubuquela where he will spend the balanceof his yearsSan Francisco July 23 Among thearrivals from Alaska on the steamerBertha was Dr C F Dickerson of Kodiak island which lies just at the headof Cooks inlet He says the gold excitement all over the territory of Alaska is something unprecedented andpeople are flocking to the Klondyke ina way that threatens to depopulatemany of the trading posts and coasttownsWhen I left Kodiak two weeksago said Mr Dickerson the peoplewere leaving all that section of country and flocking in the direction ofKlondyke In a way the situation isappalling for many of the industriesare let practically without the meansof operation Mines that are payinghandsomely at Cooks Inlet havebeen deserted In my opinion thereare just as good placer diggingsto be found at Cooks Inlet as inthe Klondyke region There is nota foot of ground in all that conntrythat does not contain gold in more orless appreciable quantities The greattrouble has been that people have nothad either the courage or opportunityI do not know which to thoroughlyprospect the country I think that inanother month the country aboutCooks Inlet will be practically deserted Thero is room there for thousandsof men and there is certainly no better place in the world for a poor manOne Hundred and Twenty PeopleDrownedLondon July 24 A dispatch fromSingapore says that the Chinese steamer Srihengann bound from

thenecessary revenues for the government hasalready passed the house of representativesand the senate and awaits executive actionAnother question of very great importanceis that of the establishment of our currencyand banking system on a better basis which1 commented upon in my inaugural addressin the following wordsOur financial system needs some revisionour money is all good now but its value mustnot further te threatened It should all boput upon an endurimr basis not subject toeasy attack nor its stability to doubt or dispute The several forms of our paper moneyoffered in my judgment a constant embarrasment to the government and imperil a safobalance in the treasuryNothing was settled more cleirly at tholate national election than the determinationupon the part of the people to keep their currency staple in value and equal to that of thomost advanced nations of the worldThe soundness of our currency is not herequestioned No loss can occur to its holdersIt is the system which should be simplifiedand strengthened keeping our money just asgood as it is now with les expense to the government and the peopleThe sentiment of the country is stronglyin favor of early action by congress in this direction to revise our currency laws and remove them from partisan contention A notable assembly of business men with delegatesfrom 29 states and territories wa held at Indiana polis in January of this year The financial bituation commanded their earnest attention and after a two days session the convention recommended to congress the appointment of a monetary commissionI commend this report to the consideration of congress The authors of the report recommend a commission to make a thorough intestigation of the monetary affairs and needsof this country in all relations and aspectsandto make proper suggestions as to any evilsfound to exist and the remedies thereforThis subject should receive the attentionof congress at its special session It oujhtnot to be postponed until the regular sessionI therefore urgently recommed that a special commission be created nonpartisan in itscharacter to be com posed of well informedcitizens of different parties who will commandthe confidence of congress and the country because of their special fitness for the workwhose duty it shall be to make recommendations of whatever changes in our presentbanking and currency laws may be found necessary and expedient and to report their conclusions on or before the first day of November next in order that tne same may be transmitted by me to congress for its considerationat its fisrt regular sessionIt is hoped that the report thus made willbe so comprehensive and sound as to receivetne support of all parties and the favorableaction of congress At nil events such a report can not fail to be of value to the executive branch of the government as well as tothose charred with public legislation and togreatly tssist in the establishment of an improved

His face was belligerently red and his widely staring eyes anticipating with maniacal vigilance anytendency to laughter which his appearance might provoke blazed forth achallenge to the entire car and successfully dispelled the rising spirit ofjocundityThe night was the most tempestuous of the present season and in orderto escape the gusts of wind and waterthat assailed the car from every direction some of the owls had gatheredin the aisle while others had perchedupon the backs of seats and some hadopened up their umbrellas The conductor with an air of intrepidity bornof a familiarity with

Recently Tamed BeaHt That WoultStand Any ChargeOne of the first things the maharajasdid after our arrival was to hand toeach guest a slip of paper on which wagwritten the name of the elephant altlotted to him- for shooting purposeswhich bore on its back the structureknown as a howdah to carry theshooter and his guns As these elefphants were necessarily large and thqhowdah is high the oscillation wasjmuch greater than if one were seatequpon a plain pad upon the elephantsback or on one of the smaller elephants which have a smoother gaitWe usually therefore went to thecover or jungle upon one of the beating or pad elephants which afterward during the operations of the daywere employed in a long line to forcethe rhinoceroses and other animals outof the dense thickets in which theyliveThe howdah elephant which themaharaja allotted to me was namedSeeunder Three years previouslyit was an uneaptured wild elephantranging at liberty the jungles of Ben- vgal It was a fine female between niceand ten feet in height at the shoulderwith short but perfect tushes projecting a few inches beyond the upperlip There are other elephants in themahara jas stud which have been tamedmore recently still It was very gentleand obedient and perfectly fearlessand therefore very valuable as a shooting elephant as for example on several occasions during the followingthree weeks it stood without flinchingthe charge of wounded buffalo tigerand rhinoceros thus enabling me totake a steady shot Almost all elephants show great fear of the Indianrhinoceros there are few that will notturn tail when they scent their enemyand fewer still that will stand thecrash and short snorts that precede thechargeAbout breakfast time each morningthe elephant told off for eacli guest wanbrought to the neighborhood of hintent and the howdah placed upon itrescing upon a saddle composed of twocushions of strong sacking about sixfeet by two which rested in turn upona large cloth covering the whole of thoelephants back The howdahs forshooting are lightly built of wood andcanework and contain two seats and-racks to hold six guns or rifles three oneach side All this is lashed on byropes passing under the elephantsneck belly and tail The weight whichan elephant is able to carry upon itsback exceeds a ton for short distancesthey have been known to carry as muchas 3000 pounds but for long marcheshalf a ton is considered the limit Manyof the mahara jas elephants had finetusks but most tusks are cut at regularintervals to prevent them fromone another One or two of tho vfighting elephants however had pointed tusks H W Seton Karr inturyA Race Quarrel in AustriaThere has been turbulent scenes inthe Austrian reichsrath or parliamentoccasioned by bitter race animositiesbetween the Germans and- the

Information on Tilings inGeneralNew potatoes and new peas aredishes that all delight in just now butmany a housewife finds to her sorrowthat on warm nights these deliciousvegetables will not keep till morningeven if they have been cooked in milkThere is something in the atmospherethat sours the not always good milk ina short time naturally aided by the little flour that goes to thicken the gravyThere is a way to obviate this Ofcourse neither peas nor potatoes shouldbe cooked to a mush and eveff cut indice the potatoes should retain theirshape Just as soon as the meal isover turn the peas and potatoes into afine colander and pour a lot of boilingwater over them This will wash awayall the thickened milk and you cansafely set the vegetables in a cool placeto use for the next meal or for soup orsalad- If you want to serve in milkagain treat them as though they werejust cooked ready for the gravy andseason them againHere is a nice way though just a lit-tle troublesome perhaps to serveoranges Make a rich thick sirup ofsugar and water in which you haveboiled orauge peel till it is tender Putthe peel aside to use when dried for seasoning other things Select largexather tart oranges peel and dividethem into single sections withoutbreaking the skiu Drop a dozen or soof these sections into the boiling sirupat a time leave a few minutes and thenlay on a sieve to drain over a

him He eats well andtherefore he must be all riyht As amatter of fa t although a good appetiteU sometimes considered as a test of the-state of the health it is not an invariable test for often those who are seriously ill have good appetites This is thecase with many consumptives and others but a person with a bad appetiteis not in good health there is something wrong with him Appetite andhunger are generally used synonymously but hunger is more than appetiteit is imperious but is allayed after eating What is the best thing to do whenthe appetite wanes The usual remedyis a tonic sometimes we fear it takesthe shape of too frequent nips of ginand bitters sherry and bitters or someother compound For a want of appetite the real remedies needed are oftenrest and sleep together with fresh

man tolet agood resolution warp in the cooling He was self made in the sensethat he vved his parents little beyondthe fact of existence and the worldafter its wont with waifs human orotherwise had tempered him in a saltish bath of adversity and sharpenedhim upon the grindstone of experienceHaving made shift to climb some in 1considerable distance up the slipperyhill of knowledge by his own unaidedexertions he fell easily into the habitof thinking himself more capable thanother men The demonstration wassimple and conclusive He had provedhis to wring a measure of success outof adverse circumstances whereothers with all the advantages of preparatory training had failed He wastoo kind hearted to be cynical but hecould not help making comparisonsand they were usually unfavorable tothose who inspired themIn the short conversation on the hotel veranda Protheroe had takenThorndykes measure with a considerable degree of accuracy and but forthe enlistment of his sympathies hemight have been inclined to look uponthe New Yorker as a person who wouldprobably serve upon better acquaintance to point the moral of anothercomparison As it was however criticism was swallowed up in charit3and 15 minutes after leaving Thorndykes room Protheroe was gallopingout one of the prospective streetswhich turning abruptly around theshoulder of Johns mountain becamea country road leading up the valleyof the Little Chiwassee His destination was a small farm the home ofthe Duncans lying six miles up thevalley and his object was to prevailupon his friends to open their doorsto the sick manThere was a small romance at the bottom of the Scotchmans settlement inAlabama Duncan had been a schoolmaster in Lanarkshire and Martha Kinross was first his pupil and later hissweetheart Martha was the lairdsdaughter and the laird having a justregard for worldly gear objected tothe penniless pedagogue For once ina way Duncan put his hereditary caution under foot gave up the schoolmarried the girl and together they ranaway from the lairds wrath and fromthe old world Once over seas the winters of Quebec became a sufficient pretext for farther wanderings and thesebeing aimless ended as well in Alabamaas elsewhere They had bought theworn out farm in the Little Chiwasseevalley before Elsie was born and thechief motive in its selection was onewhich neither Duncan nor his wifewould have acknowledged The narrow valley was a Scottish glen the surrounding mountains were the hills ofLanark magnified somewhat by thekindly perspective of time and distanceand it was within the compass of a merely practical imagination to transformthe small river into a Scottish burnNot to be outdone in a matter ofsentiment the valley had repaid theparents in kind by giving what a mildclimate and inspiring scenery may givetoward the endowment of the daughterElsie Duncan was comely and passingfair to look upon as the native borndaughters of aliens are wont to bemoreover she was simple and truehearted thinking that there were nomountains like her own mountains andfew men as good as her father Shewas the apple of Duncans eye and forher sake he had turned schoolmasteragain giving her what she had otherwise gone wanting in a bookless landWithout having been pointed thitherward Duncans efforts to lift hisdaughter above the educational levelof the neighborhood brought abouta result which was not the less gratifying because it was unforeseen Thebook learning raised a barrier betweenthe girl and the mountain and valleyyouth which was more impassable fromtheir side than from hers and untilProtheroe had stumbled upon the Dimcan homestead on one of his prospecting journeys there hadbeen no suitorsat the farmhouse Nor is it quite fairIlto say that the young engineer wasthe exception He bad always beenwelcome a the stone house in the valley but he had not yet got beyond theunspeakable stage with ElsieIt was the uncertainty of his standing with her that made Protheroe hesitate to introduce a possible rival andit was his assumption of superiority overthe common foibles and weaknesses ofhumankind in general and of jealouslovers in particular that united withhis sympathies to make him change hismindThe wagon road up the valley of theLittle Chiwassee follows the stream toa point within a quarter of a mile ofDuncans house where it climbs a lowwooded spur of Johns mountain Fromthe top of this spur the young engineercould look down upon the house and itssurroundings and he saw Duncan in thebarnyard talking to a stranger an oldman with white hair and beard fallingover the cape of a tattered army overcoat At sight of Protheroe the manclimbed the fence and ran up the mountain while Duncan came around thehouse tothe gateGood morning Mr Duncan I hopeI didnt scare your neighbor away Hetook to the woods as if he thought Imight be a constable with a warrantAn who kenned you were not whenye cam loupin ower tlie hill yonderDuncan came out and loosened the saddle girth while Protheroe was hitchingthe horseI did for one and you ought to foranother But tell me who is yourneighbor who looks old enough to bemy grandfather and who yet makesnothing of a ten rail fence and a steephillsideYere ower curious Robbie an Illno gratify ye Ony f rien o mines welcome to loup the fence or win out at thegate as he pleases But come ye intothe house yell be havin an errandthis mornin Im thinkinProtheroe laughed at the shrewdguess I have just that he rejoinedand itll take a family council to settle it tooDuncan led the way to the sittingroom and called his wife and daughterrfAt sight of Protheroe the man climbed thefencefrom the kitchen When they cameProtheroe told what he could of Thorndykes story I know next to nothingabout him he concluded but he isevidently a good fellow and if there isa fighting chance for him in this climate it seems as if he ought to havethe benefit of itPuir body said motherly MrsDuncan What shall you say JamieIm thinkin itll be for ye to sayMarthaProtheroe had been trying to readElsies face and the expression ofawakened sympathy thereon made himregret for a moment the warmth withwhich he had been pleading Thorndykes causeIm no sayin it wouldna be a Christian thing to do continued Duncanspeaking to Protheroe but itll pitmair work on Martha an the bairnan Im no just free to say when itcomes to thatI think youneedna be troubled aboutthat said the wife The pot winnaoverflow for one mair in the familyWhile they were considering waysand means Elsie held her peace butProtheroe could see too plainly for hisown comfort that she favored the planWhen he put his conclusion to the testby asking her what she thought of itshe answered dutifullyIts for father and mother to say butI think we ought not to refuse in sucha caseIt was the casting vote and when thematter was definitely settled Protheroehad no desire to prolong his visitNo I think Id better get back andtell him he said in reply to Mrs Duncans hospitable entreaties Itllbrighten him up after the scare heshad this morningDuncan went with him to the gateRobbie lad yell no be sayin onything ower yon with a jerk of histhumb toward Allacoochee abootthefren o mine that louped the fenceCertainly not And about Thorndyke you know nothing of him excepting what Ive told you but Ill beresponsible for the expense if need beHoot mon Im no that cannyprotested Duncan but Protheroe smiledwhen his back was turned thinkinghow the Scots face had brightenea atthe satisfactory mention of securityOn the ride back to Allacoochee theyoung engineer had a bad half hourSuch comfort as could be got out of theconsciousness of a good deed well donewas quite overshadowed by a veryfear that he had thoroughly andconsistently done the thing which cfall others would be most likely tojeopardize his chances with Elsie Duncan He did not regret it but he waswith himself because he foundit impossible to take an enlightenedic w of the matterIm an ass he soliloquized at onestage jn the short journey an unmitigated donkey of the pack trains at thatI dont deserve to have a ghost of ashow after this he had already gonethe length of assuming that Elsie andThorn dyke would immediately fall inlove with each other And to thinlethat I was idiotic enough to plan thewhole thing myself tThus at the end of the first three milesvtJ4Byrihe time the Queen Anne gables oftBe Hotel Johannisberg came in sightaround the shoulderof Johns mountain he had argued himself into a morephilosophical frame of mind- After all perhaps its a godsendElsie has seen nothing of the world andhow else could I be sure that I was everanything more to her than the first manshe ever met Its better to find it outnow than later much better in everywayAt which sensible reasoning the natural man within him arose once moreaiid mocked himupvnTHE LOGIC OF PROPINQUITYWhen Philip was established in theDuncan household he wrote to hismother It was a long letter liiled withjesting raillery at the conditions of hisexile but containing no hint of whathe believed to be the beginning of theend in the matter of his malady Inclosing he spoke of the DuncansThey are both characters in away andthey would Interest you if you could knowthem Duncan Is a typical Scot upon whom20 years of exile have left no Americanizing mark His speech is still of thebroadest and his cautious habit has writtenitself in capital letters all over his homelyface Mrs Duncan is a person in whosecheerful smile the blue devils quail andbeg for another herd of swine Could appreciative eulogy go further Seriouslythough they have made me very comfortable and snug in a painfully neat littlebox of a room under the eaves their tableis homelike and wholesome and Mrs Duncans hospitality is warm hearted and cordial without being obtrusive For the restI have half a county of wild mountain rangeat my back upon which to spend the leisurethat overflows the greater number of mywaking hours and you may tell Dr Perevinthat I mean to take his outdoor prescription in heroic dosesShow this letter to Helen if you pleaseand tell her Ill write her before long Ohyes and watch the expression on godfather Morrissons face when you tell himthat he can have a few choice suburban lotsin Allacoochee at 2C0 a front foot at leastthat was the price yesterday though it isprobably more nowI suppose I ought to write more but Ishant the spirit moves me to go and climba mountain Take good care of yourselfand write often addressing me care ofMr Robert Protheroe AllacoocheePHILIPIn writing this letter Philip had notintended to omit the mention of Elsiesname and standing in the Duncan household but since the thing was done hadid -not correct itIts just as well he told himselfIf I say anything at all Ill have to tellhow sweet and lovable she seems to beand that might make the mother uneasy Ill wait till Ive discovered herfaultsThat was the beginning of a weakness When he wrote again it occurredto him that his former silence might bemisconstrued if he mentioned her nownay more before he had been a weekat the farmhouse he began to see thatif he spoke of Elsie in his letters it mustbe in terms of praise In his most selfreliant moods he had always been moreor less dependent upon a sympatheticatmosphere and under the circumstances which made him an inmate ofthe Duncan home this dependence became a morbid craving And of pity andsympathy Mrs Duncan and Elsie gavehim unstintingly out of the overflowingkindness of good heartsFor a few days after his removal fromtown Philip spent much time on themountain Then there came a week ofrainy weather and by the time theskies cleared he found it singularly easyto stay in the house During the indoorweek he had stumbled upon an occupation which was both pleasant and dangerous This was the fact though herecognized only the pleasure and shuthis eyes to the danger Elsies lessonshad stopped at the end of her fathersacquirements and she was ambitiousand eager to go on Thorndyke foundthis out and turned pedagogue with theidea that he would repay kindness withkindness The lessons begun duringthe week of rainy weather were continued without interruption until oneday when Philip was more languid thanusual Elsies conscience awoke with astartMr Thorndyke youre doingwrong she said looking up in selfreproachful dismay You haventbeen on the mountain for two weeksIts

open Im thinking thebuik is keeping ye ower close to thechimney neuk Mr ThorndykeThe appeal settled the question forElsie but her evident embarrassmentpuzzled Thorndyke For a swift instant a possible explanation thrust itself upon him but he put the thoughtaway with a twinge of shame that hehad given it room Doubtless Elsiohad her own reasons for her apparentconfusion but they concerned him onlyso far as to make it advisable that heshould do nothing to place Jiimself ina false light before her The afternoonramble would give him a chance to tellher more about himself and if thevagrant suggestion which he had madesuch haste to disown had any remotekinship to fact the bare mention ofHelens name would set the matterright and there would be no room forfuture misunderstandings It wasclearly the just and honorable thing todo and now that he thought of it hereproached himself for not havingdone it sooner With a different upbringing Philip might have seen theunmalleable self conceit in all this andhaving recognized it he would havebeen honestly and frankly ashamed ofit Since he was not aware of its existence his resolve to make a confidante of Elsie took the comfortingform of an act of delicate and chivalricthoughtfulness and he looked forwardwith magnanimous impatience to thetime when he could give it speechAfter dinner however When theywere climbing the steep path leading tothe summit of Johns mountain thegood resolution began to part with itsurgency Elsies embarrassment haddisappeared and in such irrelevanttalk as the scramble up the rocky trailpermitted there was no opening foranything like confidences With the delay Philip began to doubt the necessityIf he were not under sentence of deathit would be different but in the light ofthat tremendous fact why should hego about to observe the unwritten lawsof conventionality It cou d surely btno disloyalty to Helen if he allowed himself to take what of sympathy and pitythis other young girl chose to give himout of the abundance of life and healthOn the contrary would not Helen beglad when all was said to know thathe had not died without the unction ofcompassion And Elsie that was aphase of the question which might wellbe treated as a wise man treats a sleeping dog it was the very hardihood ofvanity to suppose that her heart wastouched by any emotion deeper thanthat of pity Knowing that his dayswere counted there could be no offering save at the shrine of womanlytenderness and sympathy In anyevent there was no occasion for hastehe would wait awhile and see what cameof itTO BE CONTINUEDHONOR

glimpse into the future as relating to the question of dresnThe extremely delicate tints ofEdiths costume led me to remark thatthe color effects of tlie modern dressueemed to be in general very lighf ascompared with those which prevailedin my dayThe result I said is extremelypleasing but if you will excuse a iatherprosaic suggestion it occurs to me thatwith the whole nation given over towearing these delicate schemes of color the accounts for washing must bepretty large I should suppose theywould swamp the national treasury iflaundry bills are anything like whatthey used to beDoubtless we could not do muchelse if we washed our clothes shesaid but ypu see we do not wash -themNot wash themi Why notBecause we dont think it nice to 1wear clothes again after they havebeen so much soiled as to needmgWell I wont say I cm surprised I replied in fact I think Iam no longer capable of being surprised at anything but perhaps youwill kindly tell me what you do with adress when it becomes soiledWe throw it awav that is it cpsback to the mills to be made into something elseIndeed To my nineteenth centuryintellect throwing away clothes wouldseem even more expensive than washing itOh no much less so What do yousuppose now this costume cf minecostI dont know Im sure I never hada wife to pay dressmakers bills forbut I should say certainly it cost agreat deal of monejSuch costumes cost from ten- totwenty cents said Edith- What doyou suppose it is made ofI took the edge of her mantle between mv fingersI thought it was silk or fine JinenI replied but I see it is nol Doubtless it is some new fiberWe have discovered many newfibers but it is rather a question ofprocess than material that I had inmind This is not a textile fabric atall but paper That is the most common material for garments nowadaysBut but I exclaimed what if itshould come on to rain on these paperclothes Would they not meit and ata little strain would they not partA costume such as this said Edithis not meant for stormy weather andyet it would by nc means melt in a rainstorm however severe For stormgarments we have a paper that is absolutely impervious to moisture on theouter surface As to toughness Ithink you would find it as hard xo tearthis paper as any ordinary cloth Thefabric is so strengthened with fiber asto hold together very stoutlyBut in winter at least when youneed warmth you must have to fallback on your old friend the sheepYou mean garments made of sheepshair Oh no there is no modern usefor them Porous paper makes a garment quite as warm as woolen couldand vastly lighter than the clothes youhad Nothing but eider down couldhave been at once so warm and light asour winter coats of paperAnd cotton linen Dont tell methat they have been given up likewoolOh no we weave fabrics of theseand other vegetable products and theyare nearly as cheaxi as paper but paperis so much lighter and more easilyfashioned into all shapes thatitisgenerally preferred for garments But atrate we should consider no material fit for garments wThich could notbe thrown away after being soiledThe idea of washing and cleaningarticles of bodily use and using themover again would be quite intolerableEor this reason while we want beautiful garments we distinctly do notwant durable ones In your day itseems even worse than the practice ofwashing garments to be used againyou were in the habit of keeping yourouter garments without washing atall not only day after day but weekafter week year after year sometimeswhole lifetimes when they were specially valuable and finally perhapsgiving them away to others It seemsthat women sometimes kept their wedding dresses long enough for theirdaughters to wear at their weddingsThat would seem shocking to us andyet even your fine ladies did suchthings As for what the poor had todo in the way of keeping and wearingtheir old clothes till they went to ragsthat is something wont bear thinkingofIt is rather startling I said tofind the problem

-directionsAnd Mr Joy looked a trifle anxiousas he kissed his daughter and wrunghis sons handYes sir You know we went withou last summer and besides as we go3n the boat we wont have to change2arsOh youll get along all right withsuchharp reasoning as that laughedhis fatherAnd then he hurried off down townto businessThe present occasion was an important one in the Joy family for it wasto signalize the first venturing abroadby themselves of 13-years-old Clintonand his younger sister DaisyThey had been invited to spend a weekwith their grandmother near the seashore and as Mrs Joy was an invalidand her husband happened just at thetime to be very busy at his office it wasfinally decided that the chidren mightsafely be trusted to take care of themselves for the 30 milesThey were of course highly delighted with this arrangement andwhen they were at last actually in thestreet car on the way to the boat theyTootn felt very importantI wonder how many adventures wellhave said Daisy as she sat on the veryedge of the seat in order to have herfeet touch the floorOh you mustnt talk about or lookfor em replied her more practicalbrother or we wont have any atallAll went smoothly imrtil they reachedthe pier wihere Daisy was seized witha mortal terror of passing the score ormore of wagons and trucks that werecontinually coming and going andblocked the wayOh Clint she cried Just seethat Jhorrid big horse with the muzzleon his mouth Im sure if he bites hellkick too and how will we ever -get byhimHer brothers only response was toDravely lead the way flourishing hisumbrella threatening and afterfcqueezing between greasy hubs and under several tailboards they finally managed to board the May Queen -whichwas the romantic name painted on thepaddle box of the steamboat that wasto bear them across the bay to Sunside All their baggage had been sentby express the day before and after thetickets bad been bought the youngtraveler uad nothing to do but to sitquietly on the after deck and keep coolPretty soon the bell was heard to ringin the engine room the whistle gave awarning shriek the great wheels began to revolve and In a few momentsthe May Queen was speeding on hercourse down the harbor and so on outto the bayIt seems as if we went almost as fastas the steam cars remarked Daisj asshe watched the foaming water Hashout from behind the wheels But ohwhat was that as a sudden jar wasfollowed- by the stoppage of the engineGuess we must have run off thetrack5 responded her brother laughinglyBut when he heard the rush of feetin the cabin and the loud shouts -ofcaptain and pilot the smile quicklyfaded away and he put his arm aroundDaisy as if determined to proteet herfirst of allThe boats snapped her shaft intwo cried an excited looking man asbe rushed out of the cabin toward alady and gentleman he had left a fewminutes beforeOh please tell me what that meansAre we going to sinkAnd Daisy ran across the deck to findout all about itClinton followed her and with muchinterest heard it explained that theshaft was the sort of axle that turnedthe wheels and under which he hadducked his head when they came onboardAndaskedNotcant we go at all now hea boats length except as thewind and tide carry us replied thegentleman as he looked at his watchand then gazed anxiously out over thebay on which the only sails visible wereThen how are we going to get tograndmas for dinner said Daisj inBut the May Queenslong shrill whistles for help drowned Clintons answerif indeed he had known how to makeanyOh look Frank exclaimed thelach during an interval in the blastsWe must be drifting out to seaThats what I feared said the gentleman graveljr for the tide is stillrunning out and what wind there isis blowing in the same directionLetso Odown and see the breakwill you Daisy proposed ClintonAnd hand in hand they went downstairs but there was such a crowdaround the shaft that they could notget near itDaisy was rapidly growing very nervous and Clinton was wondering whathe could do or say to reassure her whena man with a gilt band around his capbeckoned to him from the after gangwayThere were two deckhands leaningover the railing near him holding onlo the ropes with which they had justlowered one of the life boats into thewaterNow dont be frightened explainedthe mate but just let us pass youdown into this boat Some of you passengers will be sure to want to go ashorewhen you find out the anchor wonthold when its first dropped and as youAjctwo are the youngest on boar its nomoren right you should have firstshowBut where are you going to takeus asked Daisy in some alarm as astout arm placed her safely in the sternof the lifeboatEight around Sandy Point you canjust see it over yonder and up the riverto SunsideExactly where we want to go saidClinton as he slid down a rope intothe bowYou might unhook those blocksbegan the mate as he sent the menaway in answer to a call from the captain and catch this rope The boatwill ride easier andBut another loud summons from thecaptain called the- officer forward andthe children were left aloneHere Daisy please hold this ropea minute while I unhook these pulleys as the man told me to do or youmight tie it to that ringSo saying Clinton passed the linethe mate had thrown him to his sisterand proceeded to cast off the hoistinggear mHe had barely completed his taskwhen Daisy startled him by giving nspring that very nearly sent him overboard and crying outOh Clint the ropesjgoneBut Daisy why didkyou let go oiI was just tryingifojftie it as yousaid and it slipped right out of myhands And oh see Qiow fast weredrifting away Cant you catch holdof somethingAnd the little girl almost held herbreath while Clinton leaned as far overas he dared and tried to clutch at therudder chainsBut just then the lifeboat sank downihetween two waves and when it cameap again there wras a space of severalfeet between it and the May Queen forthe anchor had caught hold of the bottom at last and the first of the floodtide swept the smaller boat swiftlyawayThe children at once began to shoutfor help at the top of their voices butas the steamboat had now begun toblow off steam and as most of the passengers were on Hie forward -deckwatching a vessel that had just beensighted they were neither heard norseenCant you row back Clint askedDaisy then as the boat rose high on awave only to sink into the green depthsagain she added Oh no dont trybut see if we cant get to the landClinton meanwhile was tugging atthe oars which were several sizes toolarge for him besides he had onlyrowed once or twice in his life beforeSo when he found that the wind hadchanged and was now blowing shoreward he decided that it was best totake Daisys adviceSee if you can steer against rayrowing he suggested when he hadfinally succeeded in pushing one of thehuge oars into its place Just keepthe rudder turned that way so Itdidnt look to be very far to the mouthof the river when the man pointed itout and if we can only get into thetide there itll carry us right up toSunside I used to watch it come rushing in last summerThus with the help of wind and tideand the one oar the lifeboat wasbrought nearer and nearer to the stripof beach until finally the childrencould hear the booming of the breakersWhat is that inquired Daisy asthe dull roar grew ever louderClinton told her and both awoke tothe fact that they would be much saferdrifting far out at set for if the boatcould not be kept in her present coursein spite of the wind until she had drifted past Sandy Point and around intothe quiet waters of the river she wouldcertainly be carried into the topplingsurf and capsizedClinton all exhausted as he wasworked away with his heavy oar harderthan ever but nevertheless the spacebetween the lif eboat and the water linexf breakers narrowed terribly fastwhile the distance to Sandy Pointseemed to stretch out like elasticWhich would be covered firstOh let me help Clint cried Daisyas she noticed that her brother darednot stop even to wipe away the greatdrops of perspiration that were trickling down his faceNo you cant do any more than jrouare doing by keeping tight hold of therudderDaisy however determined to do allshe could began to give out encouraging reports of their progress toward thepoint resolving not to notice how closethey also were to the shoreOnly a little bit more Clint andthen you can rest all the way to Sunside cant youHer brother nodded with his lipsclosed He felt that all his breathmust be saVed for the little bitWliat if he should not be able to holdout How long would it be beforesome great curling waveWeve passed it suddenly Announced DaisyAnd after a few more strokes forgood measure Clinton drew in his oarand as the incoming tide swept the lifeboat safely into the peaceful river hestretched himself out on the seat quitelimp from the exciting contest inwhich he had been the victorDaisy arranged a coil of rope underhis head for a pillow and fanned himwith his hat so that in the course often minutes he felt able to sit up andgently propel the boat a little fasteruntil he brought it and the news of theMay Queens mishap up to the steamboat wharf at SunsideThey heard the next morning thatthe disabled steamer had been towedback to the city before nightfall andDaisy is now of the opinion that shewould rather read about adventuresthan have themI

expenditure of capital andlabor to restore the damage done tothe highways by the hard usage theyreceived during the open winter justpast Prairie roads are very satisfactory during dry years but when thewet ones come they become impassable in proportion to the length oftime and season of the year in whichthe rains appear and to the use madeof such highways during such periodsPermanent roads may seem expensive under the most favorable circumstances but when the cost ofcartage and the expense of keeping inrepair are taken into account thepermanent roads would probably bethe less expensive if economicallymade This of course depends largely upon the accessibility of the material necessary to the construction ofsuch highways Stone gravel or sandform the foundation for them Sandand a certain kind of clay in properproportions form a road suited to allkinds of weather The sand packs un-tier moisture and the clay underdrought Each supports the weaknessof the other when combined Thepresent

plates about eightinches wide on which the wheels wouldrun with very little draft I nevermade an estimate of cost because ofthe high price of steel products untilnow that steel rails are sold so lowthat it seems as though the cost mightbe within reach of the taxpayers TheIllinois Steel company writes that steelplates three eighths of an inch thickweigh about 1G pounds per square footAllowing

or about1400 per mileWiith good oak planks 3x8 inchesat 20 per 1000 about 21000 feet permile would cost 420 so that the platesand planks to support them would costnot far from 1S00 per mile This isfor

apply theremedyIn some eases trees may have toomuch head and will exhaust themselves nourishing their foliage at theexpense of the first buds but this isthe exception Generally a tree lacksplant food

elementsare lacking as there may be an excessof moisture in the soil and drainagemay be the necessary remedy Pruning and thinning out may be necessarywhen there is an excessive growth oftop The soil may have become packedand hard so that the tree cannot makeas thrifty a growth as it should andcultivating or digging about the rootsmay be necessary With proper carethe tree can be made to bear good
