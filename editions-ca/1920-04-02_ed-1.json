Much interest has been aroused a'
the Y. M. C. A. by the new Cage
Ball, which arrived Monday. Cage
Ball is a large canvas covered rub
ber ball about 3 feet in diameter.
A number of games are played with
it including volley ball, punch ball,
kick ball and cage ball.
The feature that distinguishes
games played with the cage ball
from other games is the large num
ber that can participate in the
games. The game was originated
during the war by E. D. Angell,
the physical educational expert,
while at the Great Lakes Naval
Training Station and was used ex
tensively by Y. M. C. A. recreational
secretaries in the army camps. The
Bourbon County "Y" is to be con
gratulated on introducing this
game into the community.
The following papers and maga
zines have been selected for the flies
of the'Y. M. C. A. reading room, as
announced by the Educational Com
mittee: The Cincinnati Enquirer, Lexing
ton Herald, Saturday Evening
Post, The Christian Observer, The

become very popular. The public
is extended a cordial welcome.
MATRIMONIAL.
Dame Rumor has it that the
recent purchase of a handsome home
oh Houston avenue, in this city,
was made in the interest of a prom
inent young business man who is
soon to be married to a handsome
young Paris girl. Further than this
THE NEWS knows not.

MARCH HAS MARCHED AWAY
March, the month dreaded by so
many, is now a thing of the past, so
far as the days of the calendar are
concerned. It was a month full of
surprises, also with winds and rain,
and, in fact, just any kind of eld
weather. The rainfall during the
month was somewhat above normal,
and the wind did more than its
share of work, even, in the last
three days. There has been a -num
ber of really fine days. Spring now
seems to be here in earnest, and
this part of the Bluegrass section
never looked prettier than it does
at this time. At least, that is what
we are told by those whose business
takes them through the county.
COUNTY BOARD MEETING.
There will be a meeting of the
Bourbon County Board of Education
in the office of County School Super
intendent J. B. Caywood, in the
court house to-morrow morning at

Raymond Conneli, of Paris, a jun
ior in the College of Law of the Uni
versity of Kentucky, is one of the
distinctively popular and best
fetown men in the University.
In the three years that Mr. Con
rell has been in the University he
"has shown marked ability. Prob
ably this ability as a lawyer is ow
ing to his mastery of English, to a.
certain extent, probably it lies in
the fact that others can not "hood--wrink'
him out of his ideas, or most
probably because he knows law.
His marks have been unusually
iigh; his professors say of him thai
ie has forethought.
, Not only does he keep his stud
ies up to standard, but he takes ac
tive part in school activities. He is
x member of the Henry Clay Law
Society, and a member of the Sigma
.Alpha Epsilon Fraternity on whose
basketball team he plays. He is a
charter member of the newly-or-
yanized society known as the "Royal
ilrder of the Fish."
His brother, Thornton Conneli,
was graduated from the University
last June and is now one of the
leading reporters an the largest pa-jejr-iBj
the State. His sister, Louise,
is one of the popular young mem-
Iters of the Freshman Class of the
same institution.
it is not exaggerating to say
that great things are expected from l
tym and Paris is proud of the fact
ikaf he has represented this town
a.r .county in the State institution.
