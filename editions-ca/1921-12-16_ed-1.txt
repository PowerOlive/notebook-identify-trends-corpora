Porter, in Lexington Leader)Many Paris people are interestedin the report .from Chicago thatMarilyn Miller, the famous dancingbeauty, and Jack Pickford, moviestar, are to be married in the j nearfuture.When. Miss Miller was a babe inarms, vjrhich has not been such agreat time, ago, her parents, Mr. andjtfrs. Ed Reynolds, resided in Paris,and "with them her two older sisters,Ruth and Clare Reynolds. Mr.Reynolds superintended the intallation of the Cumberland Telephoneplant in Paris, and his wife andvtwolittle daughters spent a summedhpro with him. RtnnniTur at th fcnmJof Mrs. Mary Ireland Davis, on Dun- w ., -w.. .., UVW,f,.UO V.U VV AW..can avenue. At a very early age thetwo sisters, Ruth and Clare, developed dramatic talent to a remarkablewextent, and in 1901 they secured anengagement with 'the Bronston Comedy Company, a traveling organization playing week stands. They wereaccompanied on their travels bytheir mother, who kept a watchfuleye upon their education and health,as well as their artistic career. Theyplayed an engagement at the ParisOpera House, and made such a distinct hit that -they were induced to4-reappear- on two subsequent occasions. At that time Marylin wasbeing cared for by the grandmotherin Memphis, Tenn.Shortly after their appearance inParis, Mrs. iteynolds was divorcedfrom her husband, and some timeafter announcement was made of hermarriage to Cairo Miller, leadingJman with the Bronson Comedy Company. During their stay in Paris,Ruth, the elder of the two sisters,met Dr. John Sweeney, of Paris, whofor several years, has been housesurgeon of the Palmer House in Chi-ycago. On "going to Chicago a fewyears later to reside she again metthe handsome young-doctor and theacquaintance formed in Paris wasrenewed. They were married andnow have two manly little sons,who possess the attractiveness oftheir mother and the bearing oftheir father.When Marilyn, the younger sisterof the trio, was six years of age, itwas found that she had developedthe art of dancing to a remarkabledegree. Her mother assumed thetask of training her for the stage.It was f not long before she had anopportunity to appear in public andmade a distinct hit. Taking thename of her "stepfather, she madeone success after another, until shewas brought to the attention ofFlorenz Zeigfield, owner of the'Zeigfield Follies," who recognizedher wonderful abilities as an artist,and from that time on her advancein the profession has been the mostremarkable of any artist on theAmerican stage. To-day she is theyoungest leading ' woman on theAmerican stage, and nobody disputes'the assertion that she is the -loveliest.At present Miss Miller is starringin- the musical comedy, "Sally,"which is running at the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York. Ithas been running now for over ayear, and is destined to run anothertwelve months.The reported engagement of MissMiller and Jack Pickford, recallstwo trngic occurrences, parallel insome respects, though widely differ-1ent in others. Frank Carter, of thespeaking stage, whom Miss Millermarried some three years ago, waskilled in an automobile accident inMay of last year, while motoringfrom Wheeling, West Va., to Philadelphia, to visit his wife. OliveThomas, noted screen artist, andwife, of Jack Pickford, died in Paris,France, in September, 1920.JUST THE THING AT ABDEEYDEUG CO.Conklin Pens and Eversharp Pencils are attractive, useful and serviceable gifts.

The system has never been completed, andwith hundreds of new houses goingup in various parts or tne city, newbusiness houses recently completed,and many old houses not numberedat all, the problem has become aTery perplexing one, and one thatshould be solved.The suggestion has been made thatthe new Board of Council shouldtake the matter up, and see that thework is properly done. THE NEWS"heartily endorses the suggestion. It4b something badly needed in a placelike Paris, for the benefit of the pos-tal service and the citizens alike.One condition of the establishment.of free mail delivery here was that--all the houses should be properly. numbered and receptacles for mailplaced for the convenience of themail carriers.
