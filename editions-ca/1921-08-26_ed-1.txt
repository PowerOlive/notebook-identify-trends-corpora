Wonder how they gotthat way, that this law, which is exactly what everybody (on foot) wishes for, has been allowed to lie slumbering, while we poor pedestrianshop, skip and jump from in front ofthe hootch-tanked drivers?"Looks to me if this law and its enforcement in Louisville were givenpublicity in every town, . until theofficials couldn't dodge it, perhaps thesolution of abolishing this criminalpractice may be at hand. I ownneither a car nor as much as twofingers of hootch, and maybe I feeltoo strongly on the question, butevery time I have to run from infront of a speed king, I wish I had abrick and could hit the mark."You sic 'em, Mr. Editor, youhave a newspaper."L.

G. Reynolds, Federation PresidentThe women of the state are vitallyInterested in the passage of the twoamendments to the Constitution whichare to be voted on next November.Mrs. H. G. Reynolds, president of theFederated Women's Clubs of the State,when asked for a statement concerningthe attitude of the Federation, said:'The Kentucky Federation of Women's Clubs in convention, assembledMay 1921, unanimously endorsed a resolution recommending the passage ofthe two amendments which will go iofar toward lifting Kentucky from thedisgraceful position which she now occupies in the educational statisticaltables and pledged the earnest vsupport of their 10,000 members 'throughtheir personal efforts and their Legislative Committee."No thinking person can dispute theadvisability of taking the office ofState Superintendent of Schools outof politics. The wisdom is so obviousOur Own Wireless.A wave of thought takes a minuteto travel a mile of nerve.A touch on the face Is registered onthe brain and respfevded to in theaeventh of a second. It takes a sixthof a second fer the brain to respondt the seaee of sight. -Mrs. H. G. Reynolds,as to admijt of no counter argument.Granted that under the existing 'hitor miss' system a qualified man bechosen and this is mor6 luck thangood aim what possible opportunityhas he to reconstruct the educationalsystem of the State in a single termEvery good thing done may be demolished by the succession to office of aman not in sympathy with his predecessor's ideas, or so poorly qualifiedas to be unable to carry them out"No business executive would put aman in charge of his affairs with thefixed idea of discharging and replacinghim at brief stated intervals with asuccessor chosen blindly from a motleycollection of applicants. Yet thisidiotic process, which would so quicklybe rejected in private affairs, we complacently saddle on the children of ourState, our most precious asset and ouronly hope for the future."The companion amendment is essential to the complete reform of theKentucky school systems. It requiredno more support than that accorded itby justice and logic."After making the above strong statement concerning the two amendmentsto the Constitution, Mrs. Reynolds continued :"There is a third point whicn fitsin completely with the proposed reforms and which seems essential toits entire fulfillment and should' become a law. The development of thechild from six'to twenty years Is largely the problem of the women. A largeportion of; those years is spent in theschoolroom. The mother, is in closecontact with her child and she knowsVrrvfits needs. Her judgment concerningits educational needs should not belightly put aside. The mother is entitled to a place in the councils ofeducation, and the real friends of better educational institutions will insistthat she take her rightful place outheir boards.''SCHOOL TAX HELDTO BE ENORMOUSYet Twenty-Two Times as Much IsSpent For Luxuries.The taxpayer groans at our enormous school tax. Numerous other people mention the fact that the UnitedStates spent almost a billion dollarsfor public education in 191S!Is a billion dollars a huge sum toinvest in training the brains of thechildren of the country? The answerto this question of investing a billionin education is answered by a recenfstatement by the Department of Education at Washington. A portion ofthe statement is given here:"According to Government returnsfor 1920, the people of the UnitesStates spent for luxuries in that year$22,700,000,000 ; more than 23 times asmuch as they spent for education onlytwo years before, and six billions, or30 per cent, more than we have spentfor public education in all our history."Expenditures for luxuries in' 1920included among other items :For face powder, cosmetics,perfume, etc $750,000,000Toilet soaps 400,000,000Cigarettes S00,000,000Cigars 510,000,000Tobacco and snuff '. . 800,000,000Jewelry 500,000,000Chewing gum ; 50,000,000"It is interesting to compare someof these items with the expendituresfor education. The amount paid forface powder, cosmetics, and perfumesis only $12,000,000 less than the totalamount expended for public, elementary, and secondary education in 191S ;and within $50,000,000 of-twice thetotal amount of salaries paid teachersin public, elementary, and secondaryschools."The amount paid for jewelry isnearly $100,000,000 more than the salaries of teachers in elementary andhigh schools in 1918, and is more thanthe total productive funds of all endowed colleges and universities in thatyear."The $50,000,000 for chewing gumis 2 times the total expenditures fornormal schools and almost exactly thesame as all State and city appropriations for higher education."The total cost for tobacco, in ailits forms, in 1920, was five times thetotal of teachers salaries in 1918 am',almost exactly the same as the totalcost for elementary and secondaryeducation for the three years, 191(5,3917, and 1018. If in some moment ofhigh enthusiasm and patriotic devotionthe people who use tobacco had. agreedamong themselves to smoke two cigarettes instead of three, two cigars instead of three, take two 'chaws' instead of three, and two dips instead ofthree, and had paid to the supportof the schools the money thus savedfor the year, the salaries of teachersin schools of all grades, public andprivate, could have been increasedI by more than 1,920 per cent For tobacco in its various forms we paidmore than we have paid for highereducation since the founding of Harvard College in Massachusetts andWilliam and Mary in Virginia."I'.sfai fc.xafcgiflis f .IIgive tire mileageat the lowest costin history30 x 3JNON-SKID RED-TOPCORD$15.00 $22.00 $27.50Reduction on all styles and sizes-A New Low Price on aKnown and Honest ProductiiTHE studious caregiven by us infollowing our clients'instructions is certainto result in arrangements in harmonywith the desires ofthose who employ us." iniiiiiiiiiiiiiililiiiiiiimuiiiiLlil 7 ilK fl Y l Ml1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ' t"I"I-I"l"I"I II..T.I.4"I"I"I"I"I"I"I"I"I"I"l- ! ! ! ! 4 4 1 1 1, ? rT-r- -- ' -iKEEP COOLWith a Westinghouse Electric FanWe have them all sizes.
