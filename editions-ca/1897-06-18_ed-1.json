MIDGE LEES GUEST
It -was a bitter cold February day The
snow lay piled in drifts about a weather
beaten farmhouse situated in a Pennsyl
vania town not far from the American en
campment at Valley Forge
Within this humble home Made Lee a
girl of tender years sat by the bedside of
her feeble grandfather trying to divert his
mind from the unpleasant news they had
received that morning
Word was sent that Allen Lee had been
arrested on the serious chargCrOf intending
to reveal plans of the American army to
the enemy Lee indignantly denied the
charge but his word was not sufficient to
enable him to escape imprisonment and
the trial he would have to undergo next
day He proved a gallant soldier and had
gained the good will of General Washing
ton but the documents found on his per
son made a very dark outlook for him
It was a long dreary day for the prison
er at Valley Forge and a very sad one for
Madge and her grandfather
My son arrested for being a traitorj
moaned the old man Oh I cant believe
it It is too dreadful to endure and he
wrung his hands in despair
v Yes grandfather it is hard for us
said Madge as she brushed the silvery locks
from the wrinkled brow But do not
worry I know father is not a traitor for
something tells me that his name will yet
be cleared
Heaven bless you Madge replied the
old man as he raised his eyes Let us
pray for the justification of your fathers
good name It cant be that he must die
a traitor my son bo brave and true
No no assured Madge He will
not
The old man closed his weary eyelids
and it was not long until the regular
breathing told Madge that he slept
As she rose and moved to the window
she seeded filled with light and strength
and her rapid thoughts flew hither and
thither seeking to plan a way to help her
father
If I could see General Washington
thought Madge he might listen to me
aiu Jiclp father
I will go she said resolutely to her
self Grandfather will be likely to sleep
while I am gone she continued as she
glanced on the careworn features It
would kill him if father were condemned
to die and then I should die too Madge
was naturally a timid girl but there was
unfaltering decision now in all her quick
actions
Wrapping her cloak about her she quiet
ly descended the stairs and passed into the
clear light of the bright afternoon
She hurried along the frozen path which
led across the fields to Valley Forge
Twice she slipped and fell but filled with
her great purpose she went dauntlessly on
At length she came in sight of the en
campment How cheerless was the scone
The very atmosphere was gray with cold
and the sound that came to her seemed
like the voice of winter
Madge went hurriedly to the door and
was at once bidden to enter General
Washington rose and acknowledged her
courtesy by a low bow of his stately head
She did not know how fair she looked
that afternoon The sharp wind had
brought a vivid color to her cheeks and
the crystals of snow shone through her
curls like glistening dewdrops She was
much frightened and endeavored to keep
from trembling as she heard the generals
voice when he asked how he could serve
her
I came sir to speak with you of t he
case of my father faltered Madge
What is your name my child askedthe
commander jn chief Madge Lee she
replied And your father is Allen
Lee said Madge quickly
Washingtons brow wrinkled he lowered
his eyes and his firm lips pressed closer
Oh sir said Madge beseechingly
will you not save my father I know he
is not a traitor for there is no braver sol
dier no truer American in the world
The pathetic tremor of the young girls
voice affected Washington My child
said he as he looked in her wide shining
eyes I give you my promise that I will
do all I can to aid your father It may be
that he is innocent but the papers found
in his possession cast a dark suspicion over
him Perhaps there is some mistake
continued the general encouragingly 1
will look into the case at once
Oh thank you sir said Madge as
she stepped from the door and hurried
homeward with the good news
She held the vision of his face and state
ly form constantly before her and when
the bugle call rang forth in the distance
her lips trembled with happiness
The father of such a daughter cannot
be very bad no matter how dark is the
suspicion cast on him remarked Wash
ington to himself as he watched Madge
hurrying on in the distance There must
be some mistake I will investigate the
case without delay
Meanwhile the old man slept and when
Madge reached her home she quietly en
tered and crept softly up the stairs She
found her grandfather seated in a low
chair by the window His eyes were closed
and his chin was tipped high showing the
lines of distress about his mouth
At the sight of the pallor of his face
Madge lightly crossed theloom and kneel
ing beside the chair threw her arms about
him He felt her warm lips upon his brow
and opened His eyes
Grandfather she cried Ihave seen
General Washington and he has promised
to help father
Madge gasped the old man and his
wasted frame trembled with emotion
The next day Madge received a letter
bearing a large red seal She quickly
opened the note and read the following
Miss Lee Your fathers case has received
my attention and I am pleased to inform you
that he is innocent of the crime cruelly charged
against him The real traitor has been dis
covered It was this fellow jealous of your
fathers success who concealed the papers on
him and brought about his arrest Of your
fathers promotion I need not speak for he
will be with you soon to tell you all May the
great blessing of peace and joy rest on the Lee
household Geokge Washington
Isnt he kind grandfather
Noble replied the old man as he
clasped his hands in thanksgiving
No American ever cherishedthe memory
of the great oommander in chief dearer
than Madge Lee Boston Post
of W J Bryans new book The First drinkinc
Cause and Effect
Sitting in a barber shop the other day
patiently awaiting my turn I noticed a
prominent clergyman being shaved by a
barber who had evidently become unnerved
by the previous nights dissipation
The performance was watched breath
lessly the expected cut arrived and the
clergymans blood bedewed his chin
He looked up at the artist reproachfully
and said
You see my man what comes of hard
