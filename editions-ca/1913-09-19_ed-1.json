half a century of his life to that oc
cupation. He was born near Millers
burg, and the greater part of his life
has been spent here. He resided for
a time in Missouri, where he was en
gaged in the dry goods business.
From there he returned to Carlisle,
where for many years he operated an
undertaking establishment. About
thirty years ago he returned to Mil
lersburg, where he engaged in the un
dertaking business, operating under
the firm name of Mock & McClintock
for many years. In 1894 Mr. Current
retired from the firm and the business
was operated by Mr. Mock alone for a
few years, after which time his only
son, Mr. Joel W. Mock, assumed the
business, though until recently the
elder Mock has been an active man in
the business, doing a large part of the
work of the establishment. Mr. Mock
was one of a large family, and is sur
vived by one sister, Miss Lucy Mock,
of Ruddles Mills. He belongs to a
historic family and his grandfather
served in the revolutionary war. He
was united in marriage early in life to
Miss Katherine Howard, at Moore
field, the union being messed with
two children, Mr. Joel W. Mock, of
this city, and Mrs. O. C. Pope, who
preceded him to the grave some ten
years ago. He was a typical Ken
tucky gentleman, loving in his family
and true to his friends. He has per
formed many acts of kindness and
charity of which the world knows
nothing. The funeral took place on
Thursday afternoon from his late res
idence after a short service by Rev.
A. S. Venable, of the Presbyterian
church. Interment in the Millersburg
cemetery. Quite -a numebr of friends
from surrounding towns were present
to pay their last respects.

As the name implies "The Passing
Show of 1912" is a review of impor
tant events of the year 1912, and need
less to say, everything is treated in
a humorous way. For example, the
harem scene from "Kismet" is repro
duced almost in its entirety, but this
applies ouly to the actual scene.
Scenes from "Bougn and Paid For,"
"Officer 666," "The Return of Peter
Grim," "The Quaker Girl," "Oliver
Twist," and other successes are also
handled in a like manner.
The production by far the most en
ormous ever staged at the Winter
Garden was produced by New Way
burn, who has devised many original
stage tricks.
