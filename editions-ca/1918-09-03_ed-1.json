-Mrs. Frankie Tipton, aged seventy-two,
died' at the home of her
sister, Mrs. Maria Tipton, on High
street, Sunday morning after an ill
ness" of several weeks due to uraemic
poisoning. Mrs. Paton had not been
in. good health for some time, but
her condition was not thought serious
until a few days ago -when uraemic
poisoning developed, hastening the
end.
She was the widow of Mr. James
E. Paton, of Paris, for many years
Clerk of the Bourbon Circuit Court,
who preceded her to the grave many
years ago. They had no children.
Mrs. Paton for many years conducted
a millinery business in the store
room on Main street on the site of the
building now occupied by Mitchell &
Blakemore. In after years she was
a resident of New York, 'where she
was head milliner and buyer for one
of the largest concerns in New York.
For the past two years she has re
sided in Paris, making her home
with her sisters. She was a daugh
ter of the late Mr. and Mrs. S. E.
Tipton, prominent in the life of Paris
years ago. Mrs. Paton was a cul
tured and refined woman, one whom
it was a pleasure to know.
She is survived, by one brother,
Mr. Edward-A. Tipton, of Lexington
and New York, Secretary of the Ken
tucky Trotting Horse Breeders' Asso
ciation, and two sisters, Miss Maria
Tipton and Mrs. D. C. Parrish, both
of Paris.

COOK DALBY.
-
The home of Mr. and Mrs. Chas.
P. Cook, on Cypress street, in this
city, was the scene of a pretty wed
ding at eight o'clock, last night,
when the handsome daughter of the
household, Miss Virginia Cook.was
given in marriage to Mr. Waller
Chanslor Dalby. ,v
The ceremony which united these
popular young people was performed
in an impressive manner in the pres
ence of only the immediate relatives
and a few personal friends of Miss
Cook and Mr. Dalby, by Rev. W. E.
Ellis, pastor of the Paris Christian
church. The home was beautifully
decorated for the happy event with
plants and potted flowers. The
bride, radiant in health and a face
beaming with happiness, was gowned
in a smart blue suit, with brown
shoes, hat and gloves, and carried
a corsage bouquet. At the conclu
sion of the ceremony, after receiving
the congratulations and best wishes
of the assembled guests, Mr. and Mrs.
Dalby left for a short bridal trip,
their destination being kept a secret.
They will be at home to their friends
on and after Wednesday at the home
of tlfe bride's parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Charles P. Cook:, on Cypress street.
The bride is one of the loveliest
young women in the city, one whose
sunny disposition has made her more1
than the accepted number of friends.
She is a favorite with all who know
her, by reason of her charming man
ners ami gracious ways that know
no manner of change. 'From early
childhood she has been so and com
iner to womanhood her charms- have'
become matured and of the quality b
that have endeared her to all' her
friends.
Mr. Dalby is one of the city's most
popular young business men. Gomv
ing here a comparative stranger as
manager of the Kress Co. stores hs
made himself a name for business
probity and integrity and by his dbse
attention to business and uniform
courtesy towaf-d the patrons of- feis
house, gained their esteem.. He. is; in
every way worthy of his fair bride,
and every1 good thing that can: come
to him in this life.

Lyman H. Howe's quaint tour of
old Mexico, a feature of his latest
Travel Festival, which comes to the
Paris Grand on Monday, September
9, .shows the maguey plant, termed
by Mexicans themselves "the most
useful plant in the world."
From the maguey, or century plant
the Mexican peon obtains practically
everything he needs to live. He
builds his. house , from its stalks,
makes his roof of its leaves, chops
up its stalks as fodder for his cat
tle, extracts the sap which is made
into the national Mexican drink,
pulque, eats in toasted form an odd
worm which lives in its heart, and
makes rope from its fibre.
The odd Mexican process of mak
ing rope from the maguey is vividly
shown in Mr. Howe's pictures. The
natives use a crude process which has
remained unchanged for hundreds of
years, but which efficiently weaves
a rope from the fibre of the maguey
leaves. The motion picture camera
shows how the leaves are chopped
from the plant and skinned, how the
leaf is then beaten to fibre form, how
the coarse pulp is removed by an in
strument exactly like that used by
the ancient Aztecs for the same pro
cess, and how- the fibre, as fine and
strong as sfllr, is finally woven into
rope.
This fascinating tour of Mexico is
a feature of tfie newest Howe Travel
Festival, which? also includes "Up In
the Air With the Marines," a re
markable series of aviation pictures
taken by government photographers
at the Marine Aviation FT-eTcr, Miami,
JFIorida. These not only show the
pictures of aeriar manoeuvers takenJ
ootn on the ground and in the clouds.
A sensational incident of the series
is a loop-the-loop in the clouds and
a di3zy tail spin 10,000 feet to earth,
filmed' from the machine itself. This
is th& last word in film thrills.
Other features of the - program
show the capturing of defiant wild
animals alive in the Rockies by an
intrepid cowboy naturalist, who uses
nothing but a lariat as a weapon; a
reproduction of the famous Red
Cross poster;. "Greatest Mother in the
World," animated in clay; snapshots
of Southern France, in natural colors,
and an extraordinary "freak" film
which reveals grotesque and puzzling
effects in scenic distortions.
Laughter-producing; comedy car
toons andi patriotic film conceits
will he generously interspersed
throughout the entertainment.
