Catarrh
Catarrh is one of the most obstinate
diseases and hence the most difficult
to get rid of
There is but one way to cure it
The disease is in the blood and all the
sprays washes and inhaling mixtures
in the world can have no permanent
effect whatever upon it Swifts Spe
cific cures Catarrh permanently foriti9
the only remedy which can reach the
disease and force it from the blood
Mr B P McAllister of Harrodsburg
Ky had Catarrh for years He writes
I could see no improvement whatever
though 1 was constantly treated -with sprays
- Jk wm vu r
ana wasnesr and differ
ent inhaling remedies
in fact I could feel that
each winter I was worse
than the year previous
Finally It was
brought to my notice
that Catarrh was a blood
disease and after think
ing over the matter I
saw 1t wbs unreasonable
u xdmm to b eund by
m4t hth air
reacneo the surface I
then decided to try
S S S and after a few bottles were used I no
ticed a perceptible improvement Continuing
the remedy the disease was forced out of my
system and a complete cure was the result
I advise all who have this dreadful disease to
abandon their local treatment which has neve
done them any Rood and take S S 8 a rem
edy that can reach the disease and cure it
To continue the wrong treatment for j
Catarrh is to continue to suffer Swifts
Specific is a real blood remedy and i I
cures obstinate deep seated diseases
which other remedies have no effect j i
whatever upon It promptly reaches I
Catarrh and never fails to cure even the i
most aggravated cases
Blood
is Purely Vegetable and is the only
blood remedy guaranteed to contain no
dangerous minerals

THE PASSING
OF MANDEVIL
VsrVNrvAi5v5vvs vvANv
Spasm of the glottis said the colo
nel u cd enough for a jury but what
Mandevil was quite clear he was going
1 die oi that uight and what I am quite
tlear I saw hmi die of was just simply
strangulation There came that which
took him by the throat and clutched the
life out of him between a pretty little
thumb and four 0 fingers I saw the
marks
Now as Mandevil had come to an end
in the midst of the supper crowd aj the
Bavaria hotel the colonels presentment
of the matter appeared somewhat steep
Still aa a rule his perceptions were pro
fessijaal He was unacquainted with the
use of the imaginative faculty and to
produce any very marked psychological
impression upon him you wvW have to
operate His auditors took Hie steeptifss
without impertinent comment How was
he going to get over it though
Ah the narrator said going back
again into the depths of his chair now
youre asking me Of course theres that
story of the family curse you know B-
lieve in tha sort of thing They did
Dont much wonder either And 1 sup
pose if you do believe youve got a fain-
ily curse upon you youre apt to do things
that help it along and make it all the
ier for the next lot to believe in it too
Well the trouble began in the first
tons time OUT chaps grandimcle Over
a woman it was as per usual
An extremely fascinating little devil
j rtus Lady Lilkh by all accounts but mt
nearly careful enough with a lord and
i master like that When he found her
1 out he took her in hand so seriously tnat
I the next thing was a funeral However
she must have had considerable interest
somewhere because you are bound to believe-she
certainly came back Her hus
band was found dead on the th r of his
room one morning with tin look of de
spair n his lace ami her sign manual on
his throat same as 1 saw on has grand
Depbews if you like That was her l ad
off There have been nothing but male
Mandevils born since and not one- of em
has died in his bed they tell you Dont j
say that 1 stick out particularly for dy I
ing in mine you know Three genera-
tions of it though seems to mean some
thing And thats not all The first
ton had two younger brothers Nothing
happened to the second who succeeded
till he had seen all his ons w out
except the last another Kirlon Then
the father was shot ill a duel and within
the year the son was come for just like
his uncle That let in the son of the third
brother who was the father of our man
He and I were commissioned in Ours the
same day Crimea India Africa and
the rest of it He Dover got a scratch
A year and two days ago he put himself
out accidentally they printed it Well
there yu are
After all that do you wonder our John
nie the last Kirtou felt that he was
down to be come for like the other two
If he didnt whats the use of heredity
You say this sort of thing is all rot So
do 1 in our case We havent been born
with the terror in our blood It was no
good telling Kirton that he was a fool
He knew more about himself than 1
could Shoot himself You bet hed
thought of that and what stopped him
wasnt prejudice nor want of pluck nei
ther Well the life he lived that last
year would have been enough in the case
of the average man He saw it out
though mind you if nothing had hap
pened to him after all hed be in a lunu
tic asylum tonight
Friday hed asked me to dine with
him here Then we were to go to the
Empire and eud up with a partie carree
at the Savarin I noticed we dined not
at my regular table in the corner but
right in the middle of the room with
other tables all round us Same at the
Empire kept in the crowd all the time
Same at the Sa arin centered tlu whole
Show Whats rore hed get his man
Somovs behind his chair What did 1
think was going to happen Well it
struck me that Kirton was so inferually
swbor considering that it might all b
going to mean jimjams Ww were a bit
late sitting down Kirton faced the dor
He had Lady Blanche on his right and
mamma on the left and I faced him It
was close upon 12 before wed got to col
lee Id kept an eye on Kirton all along
You know the Mandevil sort of face
about the color of a new drum head
Then he was staring right through me at
the door and his face hail pt to be the
color of that cigar ash Behind me there
seemed all at once a kind of commotion
When I looked round the people between
us and the door were getting out of their
chairs
All tlw chatter and the clatter seemed
to stop I fancy one or two women
squeaked I heard one woman back of
me cry out Whats that to the chap she
was with Then everybody seemed to be
staring straight at us There was Kir
ton sort of pinned back in his chair in
a tit youd have said his hands close to
his throat at grips with nothing his eyes
half out of his head and his fact well
like no other fellows face f hat 1 ever
saw going through till then There was
a sort of stampede Burners actually told
me afterward that he felt it every time
he tried to get near his master felt some
thing between em like death he said till
it was all over Somen idea was that
Kirton was at grips with this something
all the time Hes pretty matter of fact
as a rule too
When 1 got back after seeing the wo
men off the premises Mandevil was ly
ing limp in his chair with his head on
the back of it dead as Julius Caesar
Look at that sir Somers whispered
to me Well certainly there they were
on his throat plain enough the little
thumb and the six and a quarter fingers
Did I feel anything unusual myself
Well I remember feeling an unusual sort
of draft at the back of my neck just be
fore it began and telling the waiter to
see if there wasnt a window open
somewhere
Do 1 believe in it all What do you
think Pall Mall Gazette
Dry and Drel
Its easy enough to get along in Ger
many even if you dont know the lan
guage said the returned Missourian
One day in a good sized village I drop
ped into a beer garden where I didnt
hear a word of English spoken but I
called a waiter and said to him
Look here old man Im dry do you
