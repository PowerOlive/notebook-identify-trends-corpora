KEITH'S THEATRE WILL HAVE
Is A SPECIAL REQUEST BILL
NOW'S THE TIME.
PINE KNOT HAS A
FUTURITY CHANCE.
Eiae Knot, a candidate for the Ken
tucky Futurity and the Kentucky
Stakes, to be decided at the Ken
tucky Trotting Horse Breeders' As
sociation's forty-first annual meeting
Oct. 6 to 18, at Lexington, is owned by
Charlton Alexander, of Paris, and is
trained by Joe Rea, of Lexington.
He won the second heat of the Pre
paratory Stakes for three-year-olds at
Galesburg, 111., in 2:114, so impress
ively that Joe Markey wrote in the
Horse Review: "Pine Knot is an ex
tremely fast colt and should cut some
figure in his late Futurity engage
ments. He is by Tregantle 2:09,
out of Lulu Glaser, 2:29, by Scarlet
Wilkes, and has the Tregantle hall
mark, being good gaited and possess
ed of extreme natural speed."
Every vaudeville house in the coun
try usually gets requests from their
patrons to show certain acts in their
respective cities. The management of
B. F. Keith's Theatre, in Cincinnati,
receives on an average more than any
other city in America, excepting New
York, Chicago and San Francisco.
These requests are usually for the
best acts in vaudeville. Manager Jno.
F. Royal, of B. F. Keith's Cincinnati,
has decided to gather together a num
ber of request acts on one bill, and
will offer them next week, beginning
with the Sunday matinee.
Of the eight big acts, five have boen
headline attractions at the largest
first-class houses in America. It will
be one of the most expensive shows
ever seen in the city, and the salary
pay-roll will be close to 5,000.
One of the biggest and mqst re
markable musical tableau extrava
ganzas will be seen for the first time
in Cincinnati on this hill, when the
j Pinafore Kiddes, which include twenty-five
iuvenile stars, will annear in a
condensed version of Gilbert & Sulli
van's famous opera,- "Pinafore." The
youngsters have woii the admiration
of critics throughout -the country by
the artistic and finished manner in
which they produce this musical gem.
"Pinafore" has probably been played
by more companies and in more dif
ferent languages than any other com
ic opera ever written. All the beauti
ful musical hits of this production will
be sung by the youngsters. This play
has been engaged especially for the
Panama-Pacific Exposition at Frisco.
Then there will be John T. Haines,
late star in "The Coward," who will
present his dramatic sketch entitled
"The Man in the Dark." This is a
gripping playlet of intense human in
terest and one that should appeal to
every patron of the Keith house.
Miss Sophie Tucker, the Mary Gar
den of Ragtime, is another great feat
ure on this request bill, and by next
week she will probably have the en
tire city whistling her latest melo
dies. Miss Tucker is a young lady
generously blessed by Nature with
personality and physique.
No musician in the country has
achieved greater success than Trova
to, the wonderful entertainer with the
violin and who was a great star with
the Harry Lauder show. This Italian
has an almost uncanny way of getting
an audience and hypnotizing them
with his violin'. He ist a man who
sets the audience whistling one min
ute, crying at another and convulsed
with laughter at another.
Hanlon, Doe & Hanlon are three
great comedians of the knock-about
i variety who will close this creat
show. There will not be a dull mo
ment in it, and from beginning to end
should prove one of the best vaude
ville shows ever seen in Cincinnati.
One of the biggest features of tne
Dill will be the eld soldier fiddlers in
a new version of their great act. The
old soldier fiddlc-rs include members
of the Union ma Confederate armies,
v ho fought in '61, and who have been
grouped together in one of the mot.!
atractive musical arts ever heard on
any stage. These same fiddlers were
one of the biggest sensations of the
recent Gettysburg Convention. Their

BELOW.HOW
AN OLD'
GENTLE MAN I WHO
HID HIS MONEY
OVER. THE CLOCK
NEARLY LOST
After an intelligent old gentleman at the age of 76 dropped dead in his
home, his son found over TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS in PAPER MONEY
over the old clock vhich stood on the wooden mantel, surrounding an open
crackling fire. Not even HIS OWN WIFE knew that much money was there.
The old gentleman was simply CARELESS. His son had married the town
banker's daughter, and the bank was trusted. Both the old gentleman's
MONEY and LIFE were in danger; for burglars have a way of LEARNING
where money is hidden, and FIRE at any time might have burned the house.
