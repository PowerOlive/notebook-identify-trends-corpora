Negro Arrested Here.
George Thomas, a negro residing at
Kuddles Mills, this county, was arres-
t;d;3aturday night in this city on infor
mation received from the police de
partment of Lexington that he is
wanted in that city on a larceny
charge.
Thomas is well known to the police
of this city, having been implicated in
several robberies and was under in
dictment in the Circuit Court for kill-
i ing one of his relatives. The offense
committed in Lexington was the thelt
of a number of hides which were later
recovered, but Thomas eluded the
officers and made his escape.
The negro was taken into custody at
the corner of Eighth and Main streets,
submitting to arrest quietly but when
Patrolman Link started to jail with
him he aimed, a blow at the officer with
his fist, which missed its mark and in
an effort to escape ran up Eighth
street to the corner of Pleasant
where he slipped and fell. Following
in close nursuit the officer was soon
upon him and landed him in jail.
It is also believed that Thomas is
wanted in Majsviile. He will be held
awaiting the arrival of ihe Lexington
nolice.
Barn liar nod.
A barn of the fa-m of Clark Bur
nett on the Hume and Bedord Dike,
near this city, was destroyed by fire at

Nice Sum Raised By Church.
A neat sum to assist in wiping out
the debt overhanging the Baptist
church, was raised Sunday following
the close of the morning services and
the spirit of enthusiasm displayed by
the members of the'congregation gives
evidence that within the next year the
church will be free from debt.
At the close of the services it was
announced that an' offering would be
taken to assist in liquidating the debt
and the hope was expressed that a sum
of 500 would hejpledged for this pur
pose. Following a canvass of the niember
shiD it developed that the sum of $650
had been raised for the purpose, $150
in excess of the amount asked. The
indebtedness of the church 'on Sunday
morning was 3,800 and the amount
subscribed reduces this figure to $3,
150. It is the hope ut the officers that
the church will.be free from indebted
ness by January 1, 1914.
Fine Whiskies.
Place your order early for the finest
whiskeis and wines in Paris with T.
F. Brannon.
Be satisfied, buy from Win
ters. Keeping Money at- Home.
When you go into a local store and
buy goods from a local merchant you
do not get only the goods. You get
thritty town, tne scnoois which your
children attend, the churches which
pieserve the moral atmosphere of the
community, the things you enjoy and
use, which you and.the merchant pay
for in common.
You could send the money to some
other town and get the goods but you
can't get the other things, and even if
you think the price is smaller it is
larger m the long run since you get
less in return for your money.
The more you spend at home the
more attractive will your town be to
the coming generation and the more
pleasant to yourself in your old age.
If you have friends here is where they
arff When you make a rover of your
money you make a rover of your chil
dren and yourself. You make your
town a poorer place fn which to live
instead of a better one.

x AARON McCONNELL.
Friday morning at 6:45 o'clock fire
was discovered in the carriage and
blacksmith shop of , Taylor and Bovt 1
mg, and in a few minutes the entire
building was in flames. It looked at
one time as if Millersburg wjould be
swept with another destructive tire.
The building with its contents, a
stable belonging to Mr. E. B. Taylor,
a small ntable, the property of the
Louisville and Nashville railroad,
are a total loss.
The training and feed stable of Mc
Intyre & Turner, which is just north
of the blacksmith shop, was .on fire
several times. Had the stable
burned and the large frame warehouse
adjoining it there is no certainty
where it would have stopped as Ihera
was a south wind blowing at the time.
The origin of the fire is unknown.
Everybody left the building about six
o'clock Thursday. Mr. Taylor says
there was nothing of a combustible na
ture about the place, all Uhe doors had
been securely fastened. After the
fire was discovered it was found that
the"back"door had been opened. It is
. the'supposition that some tramp had
slept there during the night. The
firm had received a consignment of six
new buggies within the past few days.
There were also other vehicles, tools,
supplies and dressed lumber in the
building. The loss ot Taylor & Bowl
ing is estimated at 3,500 with an in
surance of $1,200. 1 he loss on the
other buildings will not exceed $500.
The firm has" recently purchased the
blacksmithjShop of G. W. Johnson and
J. C. Fightmaster.
The fire may temporarily interfere
with the arrangements of the firm,
however it is safe to say that they
will be doing business in the next two
weeks and the'property will be rebuilt
as early as possible.
Announcement has been received

Another Suspect Arrested Here.
A negro giving the name of Tom
Smith, but believed by the police to be
Joe Shepperd or "Big Boy," wanted
I in Clark county for complicity in the
murder of Deputy Sheriff George M.
Hait, in Winchester recentlv, was ar
rested yesterday morning about 11
o'clock at the Louisville and Nash
ville passenger depot by Patrolman Fred
Link.
When taken into custody the negro
had in his possession a 32 calibre au
tomatic revolver and a large number
of. cartridge. Marks of identifica
tion found on "the negro correspond ex
actly with those of Sheppard, twhich
strengthens the belief that the negro
is tne last of the quartet which perpe
trated the outrage, sought by tthe po
lice. The negro arrested was six feet tall,
weighed about 200 pounds and had a
heavy scar extending from the right
eve to the lip and a scar on the right
side of the nVck heneath the ear.
When questioned the -negro denied
having any connection with the mur
der of Hart, stoutly protesting his in
nocence. He said for the past few
days he had been employed with a
construction gang at Austerlitz. but
prior to that time had been working
with a construction gang out of Lex
ington. The negro was lodged in jail and
the Winchester officials notified of
his arrest. Yesterday afternoon Sher
iff Brock, of Winchester, came to
Paris and returned with the prisoner
to that city last night.
According to the statemerfts of a
number who have seen the negro he
compares in many respacts to the man
who has been so long sought by the
police.
