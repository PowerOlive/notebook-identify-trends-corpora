Full of years and honors, his
life's race came to a "close at four
o'clock Wednesday afternoon, for
Landon Jefferson Fretwell, retired
farmer and a citizen of Bourbon
county. Mr. Fretwell had been in
declining health for several months,
but his iron will and determination
kept him going until the Grim
Reaper won out in the struggle,
and death came to his relief at the
the residence of his daughter, Mrs.
Amni Prichard Brown, on East
Eighth "street.
Mr. Fretwell was a native of
Bourbon county where he was born
seventy-nine years ago. He was a
son of the late Pascal Fretwell, and
Kittie Hildreth Fretwell, his father
being a native of Virginia, who
came to Bourbon county and settled
as la, farmer, owning extensive
bodies of land in the county. Mr.
Fretwell lived the life of the ordi
afy country lad until the rumblings
of war took hold of his young fancy,
and he enlisted in the Confederate
servce, serving with honor through
the four years of that strife, in the
Eighth Kentucky Cavalry. His
comrades spoke affectionately of
him as a fine soldier and a fine man
in all the walks of life to which he
had been 'called. At the end of
the .war he returned to his home
ana took up again the burdens, of
farm life, in which he was success
ful, owning a fine farm - on the
North Middletown pike, near Partis,
where he resided until several years
ago, when 'he moved to Paris to re
side. He was a member of the
Bourbon Fiscal Court several terms,
and at. one time was Acting Judge
of the County Court.
In his dealings with all men Mr.
Fretwell stood foursquare to all
winds that blew, and his word was
unimpeachable. He was, in his
private life a man whom all re
spected, and in public life one
one whose acts were guided by his
sense of responsibility to the peo
ple of the county. He was not all
things to all men, but to his friends
he was ever true and faithful as in
all things else.
Mr. Fretwell is survived by one
daughter, Mrs. Amni Prichard
Brown, with whom he made his
home, and two grandchildren, Ed
ward and Thomas Prichard, both of
Paris.
The funeral will be held at three
o'clock this (Friday) afternoon,
with services at the grave in the
Paris Cemetery, conducted by Rev.
W. E. Ellis, pastor of the Paris
Christian church. 'The honorary
pall-beaTers will be his fprmer com
rades, members of the local Con
federate Veterans' organizatipn.
The active pall bearers will be H.
A. Power James Dodge, James D.
McClintock, Will G. McClintock,
Denis Dundon, Frank P. Lowry,
Newton Mitchell and Charles S.

WILLIAM RUSSELL IN A POWER
FUL DRAMA
Seldom has a motion picture
presented on the local screen pos
sessed greater power to 'enthrall
the spectators than is possessed by
the Fox photoplay "Strength of the
Pines," in which William Russell
appears at the Alamo and Grand
Saturday afternoon and night. The
plot is one of exceptional interest,
the situations are finely construct
ed, the big climax is exceedingly
original in conception and startling
In execution, and the company is
composed of singularly capable ar
tists throughout with the fasci
nating Irene Rich as Russell's chief
support.
The scenes are laid in the heart
'of the Oregon forests. The story
is based upon a timberland gang's
war of extermination for self-enrichment.
Its development centers
upon a young man's desperate ven
ture in penetrating the forest in
behalf of a charming girl. And its
climax depends upon the recovery
of a property transfer deed exe
cuted twenty years before in order
to circumvent the scoundrelly land
pirate-who later robbed the girl
of all her murdered father left to
her.
It is a picture no one should miss.

An optimist is a person who
makes himself believe the best times
of his life are yet to come. ,
The man we should most feel
sorry for is the man who has never
proved worthy of a nick-name.
Audacity may win the blazing
headline; but sanity and simplicity
gather the" unfading laurel wreath.
