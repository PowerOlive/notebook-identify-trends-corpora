It is distinctlya contagious disease and may originate by the purchase of a new animal which is already affected, andfrom that animal u may be spreadto all the remaining cattle in theherd. The condition is more prevalent in the hot summer months, especially during a period of drought,similar to the wne experiencedthroughout the entire State this summer. Symptoms The condition is usually first noticed by a profuse discharge of tears from both eyes,which constantly keeps both sides ofthe face moist. The eye-lids areswollen, painful to pressure, and invariably closed, especially so in intense sunlight. These symptomsare usually accompanied by a slightelevation in temperature, loss of appetite and a diminution in the flow ofmilk. If the condition is left to go Juntreated the discharge from theeyes assumes a purulent form, usually accompanied by a slight cloudiness of the cornea.Treatment The affected animalsshould be isolated in a cool, dark por-Hon of t.ii hnm nn.' Hvon fmm nnato one and one-half pounds Glaubers' salts at a drench, and one tablespoonful potassium nirate added toeach six gallons of drinking water.In addition, eye symptoms are best ,treated by washing the eyes out ;twice each day with a four per cent,solution of boric acid, but this maybe substituted by a 1 to 100 solutionof silver nitrate once a day. In severe cases where the lesions of thecornea are present this latter treatment is to be preferred.Prevention Whenever thds condi-"ion appe" foo herd the healthynimals s&.3 immediately re-moved to a itw. pasture, given a laxative diet and provided with freshdrinking water.Contagious Opthalmia is usuallynot a severe disease when properlyapplied, should soon bring the outbreak to a close.ROBT. GRAHAM, D. V. M.,Experiment Station, Lexington, Ky.WHEN LIGHT HURTS."Healthy people that live out ofdoors rarely complain of the light.But any one who has tried photography knows that out of door daylight is -many times brighter than artificial light, indoors or out. Whenpeople suffer from artificial lights itis something besides the strength ofthe light. It is contrast that makesarificial lights unpleasant. One wholives most of the time in poorly light-ed rooms finds it unpleasant to gosuddenly into origin day-Sight. Themore sudden the change, the greaterthe contrast, the more disagreeablethe feeling. Artificial lights seen atnight in sharp contrast with thedarkness around them, are alwaysunpleasant to face. A light that varies greatly from instant to instant,now dim, now bright, is very disagreeable and harmful to the eyes.When the light hurts the eyes thefirst impulse is to exclude it. Butthought about the matter will commonly show some kind of contrastmight be avoided. Have the roomsindoors lighted as well as possible.In going out pause a little on thethreshold to become accustomed tothe brighter illumination. Do notface bright artificial lights with adark background. Do not admit astreak of bright sunlight into a roomthat is otherwise shaded, but ratherkeep the windows wide open. Useas steady a source of light as possible and avoid all sudden changes ofillumination. If dark glasses areworn it should not -)e all the time;but only when the eyes are exposedto the brightest light; so that thecontrast between this and the feeblelight may be diminished. Have agood light on what you look at, but donot let the source of light shine directly into your eyes. When lighthurts the eyes, in spite of care toavoid strong contra!, it is likelythat the eyes are strained, or irritatedor inflamed, and the cause of thetroubls should be sought out and removed. Persistent trouble of thiskind generally has a persistent cause,like strain of the eyes; and it is useless to treat i the effect, while thecause continues to keep up thetrouble.HOPELESSLUNGTROUBLE CURED.Many recoveries from v LungTroubles are due to Dr. Bell's Pine-Tar-Honey.It strengthens theLungs, checks the Cough and givesrelief at once.

KvlTwinHOTTEST PLACE ON EARTH.(Baltimore Southern Methodist.)We have heard of dead people,dead, beasts, dead trees and deadflowers, but is there such a thing asa dead sea, and" why do they call itdead? There is, and they call itdead because it receives all andgives nothing. This body of waterthe most remarkable in the worldis at the southern end of the Jordan Valley in Palestine. It is 47miles long and 10 .miles wide, is 1,292 feet below the sea level antf isin one of the hottest regions onearth. It receives 5,000,000 tons ofwater daily into its bosom from theJordan River but gives none out torefresh and nourish the valley Iwlow, which has become an arid desert on account of the close-fisted-nessof the- sea. The water is fivetimes as salty as the ocean, is bitterto the taste, oily to the touch andleaves a yellow stain. No fish livein the water, no flowers bloom orfruits grow on Jts snores, no birdssing in its neighborhood. Its barkless driftwood and shores are incrusted with salt. Its setting is ascene of desolation and 'gloom, looking as if the curse of God rested onall the region. It is a striking emblem of the selfish life. Selfishnessis at the base of all sin. The worldonly of himself. There are no selfish heroes. The igates o glory areforever closed against the .man wholives for himself alone. He whoand he who would be rememberedby others . must forget himself. Lifecomes throngh death and true greatness through service.Restrictions on Newsies.Venders of newspapers in Berlin areto be limited to calling out the namesof the journals they sell.
