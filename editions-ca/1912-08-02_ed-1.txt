Also, it is deserving of imitation, especially in this country.In the days when the loads were devoted almost entirely to local trafficand when travellers journeying onthem .more than a dozen miles fromhome were the rare exceptions it wascomparatively nnimportant that loadrules'differed in different localities.But the highways have now becomegreat arteries of traffic not merelyinterurban, but interstated traffic.To the thousands of motorists whoundertake tours of any considerablelength the fact that there is little orno uniformity in the rules of the roadsof different States, or even of differentcities and towns of the same State, isa source of continual vexation. Toavoid trouble they must familiarizethemselves with many conflictingState laws and local ordinances andthat in itself means so much troubletnat a great deal of the pleasure of atrip may be thereby be lost.Standardization of road rules is alleast as important and desirable inthis country as it is in Eurone. If thenations across the Atlanticcan find away to bring this reform about itshould be eventless difficultffor the sister States of one bignation to accomplish it.The Blackbirds,Blackbirds have been increasing innumbres in Kentucky in recent years,andjlike the English snarrow.they seemdisposed to take up their residence intown, says theCourier-Journal.In aome instances the bird3 congregate in shade trees in creat numbersard Ucevt up mur or less continuouschattel throughout the night. Alsoblackbirds believe in early rising andare given to pouring forth volumes ofsong rejoicing, probabij, because theyare alive and in Kentucky where thebug cron is fine. Unfortunately theirpaeans of praise come at an hour whenmost people like to sleep and are notmuch inclined to blackbird melody,which lacks a good deal of being upto the standard of a first class warbieof a healthy and happy mocking bird.For these and no other reason thatneed not be enumerated a good manypersons have seen proper to revisetheir opinions as to the conservationof bird life. They do not'teel as kindly toardjthe tuneful representativesof feathored creation as they'once didwhen the raucous grakle was contentto live in the country and cluck behindthe plow, dividing his time betweenpicking up cut wunxis and making oneblade of corn grow where two grewbefore. They looked upon him as anoble fellow and a bully boy until hegot tired of being a mark for ruralprofanity and birdshot and moved intotown to enjoy a quiet life. tSomewhere in the world there maybe persons who are mourning the passing oHhe blackbird, but these are deluded persons who are wasting theirgrief. , There are more blackirds thanever before, but they simply have migrated to Kentucky.

C. R. JONES.)Turkey poults are not especiallyhard to raise if they are from vigorous stock and are properly taken careof. Above all things else, don't overfeed them, see that they are kept freefrom lice, keep them from getting wetwhen small, and make them "rustle"for their living. To rid them of lice,should they become lousy, paint thebottom of a deep box with liquid licekiller and put the poults into it'. Coverthe top of the box witb a cloth, butbe very careful not jto smother thebirds. It is well to leave a part -of thetop uncovered, as the fumes of thelice killer are pretty strong. Afterthey have been in the box for a shorttime, take them out and dust withsome good lice powder. Eternal vigilance is the priee of success in turkeyculture.A variety of feed will stimulate thehen to her greatest egg production.Most chicken coops are too smalland close and too inconvenient toclean.Don't crowd the chickens in warmweather, and don't put those of different ages together.Contrary to what we are often ledto believe, turkey raising is not a business to take care of itself.The houses must be kept clean andthe hens must be free from lice if thebest results are to be obtained.Lack of moisture in the incubator isone of the common causes of chicksfailing to break out of the shell. .Great size of an abdominal pouchin a goose indicates great age, a factthat is useful in purchasing breedingstock.The beginner in poultry business usually has his hopes and expectationstoo high. This accounts for most ofthe failures.The smaller the quarters the greater the care. Crowded fowls are muchmore liable to become affected withvermin and disease.It is claimed that in laying an egg,the pullet parts with about one 60thpart, by weight, of the total solid nutriment of its own body.The correct mating is eight to fifteen hens for each cockerel. Thesmaller the breed the more hens maye allowed to each rooster.A broiler should be short in head;broad, deep and full in breast; smallin comb (rose or pea); and a poundiand a half to two pounds in weight.Before the breeding season beginsthe chickens should be carefullyculled and graded. Only the strongest and most desirable should besaved.For the benefit of the egg-suckingdog try soaking some eggs in a solution of lye strong enough so" grainswill form on the shell. Then leavethem in Fido's way.Useful Instrument in Farm House.Every farm house should have aharness needle in it.

Eachof the raiders is said to have drunktwo bottles of the water before theydiscovered what it was.All that night they passed, underthe blue canopy of heaven, and bythe following day all the revolt and"vivas" had oozed out of them.On the second day they returned toChilpancingo with vengeance in their'hearts. Arriving near the railroadyards they found a party of Spaniardsreturning from a dance. Believingthe Spaniards were jubilant over thedisaster that had befallen them, andthey had placed a "venemous poison"in the bottled water, the bandits proceeded to kill everybody in sight.During the fight thirteen of thedancing party were killed and scoresv:ounded.

In af ast and snappy game at WhitePark yesterday afternoon Paris defeated the Rivermen in the final gameof the series by a score of 5 to 1.Hauser was.on the'mound for the locals and pitched winning ball from thestart, holding the league leaders tothree hits during the nine sessions. Inthe third inning two hits came together, but after that session he heldthem completely at his mercy and onlytwo other men reached first (base,which came in the ninth, when hepassed the first man up. The side wasretired by a fast double when the finalit was secured and the next man retired the side.While Hauser was holding the opponents safely, his teammates werepounding Weilman, securing a totalof ten safe drives, which coupled witha few errors, turned the game into aneasy victory. The locals put ud asplendid fielding game, acceptingevery chance and the batting of Guhland Lock were also distinct features,each getting three safe blows out ofas many trips to the plate.This afternoon the Colts will be theattraction at White Park and tomorrow the locals will go to Lexington,returning to meet the Orphans on theParis grounds Sunday and the Coltsagain on Monday.

There is little roomfor doubt that the game should . havegone to Paris, for in the ninth inningSheets doubled, took third on an error,nd through the interference of Rosenfeld, was allowed to score the tyingrun, in the face of the protests of theParis aggregation, Umpire Pattersonrefusing to allow the claim. Dunlapand Turner opposed each other, whileboth were hie h&rd the.latter had thebest of the argument.WEDNESDAY.In a well played game, Paris lost toMaysville Wednesday afternoon by ascore of 3 to 0. The contest wassnappv from the start and was markedbv the fast and accurate fielding of themembers of both teams. Paris excelled inthe number of sensational stunts.Mollenkamp made a long running catchof a foul back of first, Harrell knockedduwn a hard. hit liner, catching it before it dropped to the ground and Chapman took on off his shoe tops from Carmery's bat, falling with the ball, butJ holding it firmly. The loss of thej game was due to the wildness of Monroe and his inability to keep the Rivermen from hitting when men were onbase. Two of the runs were the resultof passes, while only five hits .weremade off his delivery, they cHme at atime when they did the most good.Vance, who was on the ring line forthe visitors pitched steadijy throughout and was verv effective with menon bases. He allowed but three hitsand only on was made up to the eighthinning.NOTES.The Paris management yesterday released Chas.

Over the door ofthe office on Main street hangs thesign:PAINLESS DENTIST.Entered Mrs. Bessie Burrows, thewife of Dr. George C. Burrows, thepainless dentist, the other afternoon.Her husband, and. his office girl werethere. Mrs. Burrows held one handbehind a fold of her skirt. But something black and ominous looking stuckout from the hiding place."I looked up and saw my wife andknew it meant trouble," Doctor Burrows, the painless dentist, said, thenext day. "I had lived with her nineyears and knew something was goingto happen from the look in her eye."What Mrs. Burrows saw she didn'ttell. But the black something conceal'ed behind the folds of the skirt wasproduced. It was a whip. At thispoint the versions of the painful dramathat followed in the painless officevary.Mrs. Burrows, it was said, proceeded to horsewhip the office girl. It issaid she struck her again and againwith the whip until the husband, recovering from his surprise, sprang u$on his wife and took the whip away.Doctor Burrows was very reluctantto recite the details of the drama, buthe was quite certain, he told a reporter, that the horsewhipping of the office girl did not occur."As soon as I saw my wife start forher," the dentist said, "I jumped upi -Proceeded to Horsewhip the Girl.from my chair and seized the whip."I turned my head and told the girlto go home, that there was going tobe trouble. She put on her hat andwent out, and she hasn't come back.I don't know whether she's cominghack or not."Burrows said after the girl had left,his wife remained and they arguedthe matter for several hours."Our voices may have got prettyloud," he said. "I guess that was howthis trouble got out."Burrows said he knew no reasbnwhy his wife should attack the officegirl except that she was of a jealousdisposition. ,"She had only been here twomonths," he said.STRIKE AT THOSE WHO FL1FHAtlanta Women Ask for Co-Operationof the Police Department in Suppressing Nuisance.Atlanta, Ga.

Readily Sell TheirCaptives for From $30 to$40 a Pair.Ashford, "Wash. Two brothers living on a ranch near here, named Oscar and Burr Heyburn, will enter theState university next fall and willmaintain themselves on money theyhave earned the last five years sellingbear cubs. The Heyburn boys live amile from the Mount Rainier forestreserve, where shooting is prohibitedand where bears multiply so fast asto be a menace to farming and ranching operations in the .idjacent regions. The boys contrived a trap which,when baited with fresh salmon caughtFront View.about 2x3x4 feet. This cost me 25cents.The front, or top, was first takenoff the case, and a section of one sideextending its full width, was hingedso that easy access to the interiorcould be secured. Then the case wasmounted on legs so that its bottomwas- about a foot and a half from theground. Then boards were placedsnugly around the rear and sides ofthe legs, from the bottom of the caseto the ground.The roost was next constructed, andfor this small lengths of boards maybe used. For the roost and legs Iused what is termed "scantling," ort i is VT 1 .K it4 n e: 3ddgff si J K i c, Interior View.sufficient space to slide it in (or out)through the end hinged door. "Whenplaced in the coop, it laid directly onthe floor so that the chickens roostedrough strips of one by three inch stuff.The roost I constructed in one solidpiece.It was made so that there would beabout three inches from the floor ofthe elevated coop. This arrangementwould not do for the lighter breeds,rhich prefer higher roosting places.The next step was to close in thefront of the coop, which I did by usingthe pieces which had been removedfrom it.About two-thirds of the front isboarded up, the remainder being covered with a double thickness of common burlap. The door is left off during the greater part of the year, butoOca-of?wee.oRSANPPDoOODOArrangement of Poultry Run.is necessary during the very coldweather.Two box-seats and a small board(with strips) from the ground to theupper part of the coop completed thejob.The end of the nest facing the frontwas boarded up high, to give the hensthe necessary seclusion.When the coop was completed Iraised the end door and laid an oldnewspaper on the floor, covering itvery thickly with sand. On this Iplaced the roost, and the coop wasready for occupancy. To clean, it issimply necessary to take out andthrow away the newspaper, and putin a fresh one, with more sand.In summer, with one of these coops,-it would be well to open a side doorto afford sufficient ventilation, and itwould he well to keep fewo birds ineach pen. During 'the winter, in oneof the "bird-cage" arrangements, wekeep from five to seven large WhitenRock hens, with good results.Bearing in mind that ahout sixhens could ordinarily be kept in eachcoop, any one may tell, from the number of chickens he intends to keep,how the system can be extended tohis needs.Layers for Next Winter.One great advantage of having earlychicks is that you may have pulletsready to lay in the fall or early winter and thus have eggs when they arehigh in price. Eggs are dear now,and one could appreciate pullets thatwere shelling out eggs.The Traps Were Effective.in nets back of the Heyburn barn,served to tempt recently weaned cubs.The traps, while simple, were veryeffective, and each summer season theboys have been able to capture from30 to 40 cubs. The district workedmeasured ten miles by eleven. Theyfound a ready market for the bearsin city park commissioners, summerresorts, as pets for sportsmen's children and for circuses.Fat, well-kept black bear cubs areworth from $30 to $40 a pair at theHeyburn ranch, and at this priceeasily disposed of. At the bear cubranch the little rogues had to be keptinside a pen covered twice with theheaviest wire fencing. They were fedon alfalfa and fish.DOGS TO HAVE MANICURIST.Also Veterinarian to Say How MuhSolid and Liquid Foods TheyConsume.San Francisco.

Witham of Salem,Ore., the Scientific American says:In this patent the invention has reference to chicken brooders, and theobject is to provide one having aChicken Brooder.heater, curved in cross section, -whichpermits the chicks to get their backsup against the cloth-covered heater, sothat their bodies may be warmed inthe natural way. Another object is toprovide means for warming the heater,which will use to the best advantagethe heat supplied by the lamp. Aswarm air from terminals passesthrough the openings shown in the topof the brooder in the perspective view,it will tend to draw with it air fromthe housing chamber, which will insure a circulation of air.TO DESTROY INJURIOUS LICEi Ten Drops of Pennyroyal Added toTablespoonful of Olive Oil WillProve Effective.Grease is recommended for lice, butchicks abhor it, and it should not beused unless it is absolutely necessary.Never use coal oil on young chicks,for it is irritating and likely to scaldthe flesh.If the large lice are found on thechicks, sweet oil will answer the purpose just as well, and the chicks willnot mind it .as much. Ten drops ofpennyroyal may be added to a largetablespoonful of olive oil. With thefinger rub one or two drops well under the wings and down the headand neck of the chicks. The smalllice may be got rid of easily, but thelarge gray ones stick very close andare hard to get off.The large lice will kill the youngchicks, and the owner never knowswhat the trouble is. They are hard todiscern, and will suck blood fromthe little fellows until their vitalityis exhausted, when they die. Watchthe young chickens very closely, anddo not allow them to be pesteredwith the large lice, nor the smallones, either, for they also will do agreat deal of harm in many ways.FEEDER OPERATED BY HENSCalifornia Man Invents ContrivanceWorked Automatically by ChickensGood Exerciser.People who regard chickens as nothaving enough sense to get in out ofthe wet will have to revise their opinions. A California man who knowssomething about fowls has designed afeeder which is operated automaticallyby the chickens themselves, and if ahen is too dumb she is apt to starveto death. A hopper containing feed isplaced on a trestle. The valve fromwhich the feed is discharged is normally kept closed by the weight onone side of the swinging fulcrum. Toopen the valve, weight must be applied to the other side of the fulcrumand this is done by the chicken jump-Chicken Feeder.ing upon a projecting arm. When shesees a few kernels of corn she jumpsdown and eats them and then has tospring up again to release some more,thus getting exercise and an appetitefor dinner.Best Land for Turkeys.On farms having high, dry land,which has a light growth of grass, andwhere a new breeding gobbler haslately been introduced, the largestflocks and the most thrifty lookingturkeys are found.Keep Chickens Separated.Never allow chicks of all ages to runtogether. The stronger and largerones will get most of the food, andwill fight and crowd the weaker onestill, if they do lii will ntver raount, to anything.Wild Red Rice. ,In Senegal red rice grows wild. Thefields in which it grows are inundatedregularly by the Senegal or by its affluents, and in measure as the tiderises the rice plant rises above theflood. The grain is very red and verydry and hard. It swells in the waterand as it swells loses some of its richcolor. It is very nourishing and requires no cultivation.

Scovell, of the KentuckyAgricltural Experiraen testation, A. J.Reed, the dairy specialist, has justpublished the following bulletin concerning the silo and its value to thedairyman :"During the peason of 1911 the College of Agriculture of the State University, of Kentucky, in co-operationwith the dairy division of the UnitedStates Department of Agriculture, hasbeen active in promoting the buildingof silos and carrying on other dairy extension work throughout the State."Seven concrete silos were built andseven hume-made silos set up, and repairs were made in several other cases.In addition fifteen other siloa of varioustypes were set up under the directionof the dairy division."All the silos proved satisfactoryand especially valuable during the.pastsevere winter. Everyone who built asilo has expressed himself as wellpleased with it, and many intend tobuild additional silos this summer.More concrete silos are being built thisseason than last and they are provingeconomical to build, many farmers preferring them to the wooden types. A12x32 foot concrete silo was built atLebanon last year for a cash outlay ofless than 5150. At Somerset a concretesilo 16x40 was built at a total cost of$400.It is expected that twenty-five ormore concrete silos will have heen builtby the end of this season. Abouttwentv of the wooden types are beingbuilt under the supervision of thedairy division, and in some cases haveresulted in a saving of S50 tojj5100 eachtothe farmer. Farmers are availingthemselves of this opportunity as evidenced by the great number of inquiries that are coming in all the time."The activity of the dairy extenbionwork has not been confined to silobuilding alone, but plans have beenfurnisned for a number of dairy barns.Five new barns were built completelast ear, and seven were replanneriand rebuilt, being changed from unsanitary, inconvenient arrangementsto cleat) convenient barns. In eachcase the supeivisor visited the farmand made individual plana using existing conditions to the bpst advantagewith the least expenditure of money.Just now there are five dairy barnsbeing built and as many more beingremodeled. Old tobacco barns arereadily converted into dairies withoutmuch, expense. The swing" stanchionsare generally used and concrete gutters and mangers are installed in almost every case. Where .bedding isreadily secured concrete floors are alsoused. In some cases cork brick or creosote blocks are used on the platformwhere the cows stand. In 1911 threenew milk houses were built and plansfor five others that are being built nowwere made." In connection withthe construction work, individual records are kept of 150 cows in eight different dairies. In one dairy of twentyfive cows it was found that the entirepn fit w s $C42 in one year, the bestcow jiJdinir only 24 pounds of butterfat, and the average being 200 noundsanece. One cow yielded 105 poundsof butter fat, which was rot enough topay her board. Another herd of eightcuws profited $457 in a 5 ear, with thebest cows yielding 322 pounds of butterfat, the herd aveiage being 267 poundsOne dairyman milks and cares for 16cows to get the same money that another milks 8 cows for."Wasteful feeding and inefficientcows lose years cf hard labor andthou&ands of acres of good grain. Thedairy expert of the university willshow just for the asking, how largesavings may be made each year, anddairy work will not all be heartlessdrudgery."Railway Business For May.For the month of 'May the net operating revenue of the railways declinedfive and five-tenths per cent, per mileof line as compared with May 1911,and that Maysl911 was four and eighttenths per cent les than, for May 1910.This is the salient fact 6f the monthlysummary of he Bureau of RailwayEconomics, compiled from the reports of the railways to the InterstateCommerce Commission and embracingninety per cent of the steam railwaymileage of the country.The operating revenues were $226,109,262, an increase ot $7 per mile otline.over May, 1911. The ODeratingexpenses were 161,368,677, an increaseot 24.29 per mile of line, while the netoperating revenue was 64,740,55, a decrease of 17.23 per mile of line.Taxes amounted for the month to 9,897.301,or 45 per mil, an increase ofnine and two-tenthg per cent.The decrease in'net operating revenue was most severe for the Easterngroup of railways, amounting toeleven and nine-tenths per cent. Forthe Southern group it increased fourtenths of one per cent, and for theWestern group less than one-tenth ofone per cent. The aggregate of thenet operating revenue for the elevenmonths of the fiscal year, and also forthe five months of the calendar year,when measured per mile of line, showsa decrease in comparison with the corresponding periods of the previousyear.STOCK, CROP AND FARM NOTES.Monte Fox and Harve Harp hovesent from Scott county to the Easteight carloads of cattle, containing 13Shead, which averaged in weight 1,450pounds and which brought 88 cents apound.New Line 0!
