IJe Acquired by theAmerican CommisionParis Sept 28 While the receptionaccorded the United States peace commission here is all that could be desired and while the French foreignoffice has taken great pains to treatthe American and Spanish commissioners in precisely the same mannerit must be admitted that the generalatmosphere of Paris especially thediplomatic atmosphere does not incline toward AmericaIt is the general impression herethat the American commissioners haveinstructions to provide for the retention of Manila and the island of Luzon and for a commission to pretendto negotiate is a farce said a prominent diplomat He continuedAmerica will put herself diplomatically in the wrong when she exceeds the provisions of the protocolwhich both nations signed I knowthe Spaniards have come prepared tomake concessions but if the American instructions are of an uncompromising nature which is generally believed here to be the case you can restassured that the work of the commission will be futile The Spaniardswill retire and America will at leasthave to threaten a resumption of hostilities before she will gain her pointThe French newspapers beyondannouncing the arrival of the commissioners make no comment upon thematterThe American peace commission forthe1 first time since its appointmentmet as a body Tuesday for two hoursin the drawing room of the ContinentalhotelMr

commissioners They will beused for executive sessions and officialheadquartersAs the joint commission is not a deliberative body it will possibly notorganize with a presiding memberfrom either

graphic description of hisexperiences with that amiable and useful animal You can well imagine thattheres a circus around here when theusual riding instruction is going onWhen the untamed camels first arrivedat our camp I heard a tremendousgrowling in front of the door and ongoing out I saw one of these amiablebeasts being led by his keeper butwalking along with every expressionof disgust both on his countenance andvoice The man stopped ditto cameland attempted to tie the beasts forelegs together When it reared andstriking out with its forefeet landedon the keepers stomach and headsending him

muleand can use all four feet at one timein a kicking match Then it can biteworse than a vicious horse and buckin a wav to make a bronco blush withabsolute shame No rider ever livedwho can stay on that perch seven feetfrom the ground during a camels exhibition of gymnastics Then he canrun away when he feels like it and isoften seized with a desire to slopeUpon an occasion of this kind his riderexperiences a sensation between being blown up with dynamite or struggling against the throes of an earthquake until all his joints are dislocated and he drops a limp inert massto the ground Then this sweet creature has a way of evincing his displeasure that is at least effectual andconvincing He twists his snake likeneck into a circle and poking hisugly nose into the face of the rideropens Iris cavernous mouth and letsout a roar of disgust in such a fetidbreath that the elevated human vie-tim is fairly blown into the middle ofthe coming month a week being tooshort a distance And yet with allthese high recommendations whichscrne people might consider objectionable these are the dear animals Iam constantly brought in contact withaidfor which I am even beginning toform an affection

distress andcaused no little- indignation among hiscomradesEverybody knew Randy Merriam wasin debt He made no secret of it Hewas extravagant in his tastes had incurred obligatioirs before going on dutyat the Point and found it impossibleto catch up there There were threeor four accounts he had been asked tosettle as they had been running s6metime but he put them oft from monthto month hoping that he might soonbe able to obtain possession of a smallsum of money left him lyy the will of arelative two years before It was ontya few thousand dollars yet even thathad been contested together with anumber of similar bequests and thelegal complications had been as exasperating as the laws delay couldmake them One day soon afteiiottes wedding Merriam wasChar-summoned to the presence of the superintendent and was regretfully told thatfour of his creditors had united in anappeal to the war department and thematter hadbeen referred to him aspost commander Merriam was confounded He had seen and talked withone of them only a few weeks beforeand no such action had even been hintedat Nor did he know that any one oftheir number was aware of his indebtedness to the others Frankly he hadtold Miss Fan of these matters beforehe told her of his love but it made apparently no impression on her Letthem wait she said Youll soon beable to pay them ten times overFrankly he had talked of it to one ortwo of his intimates and later to Parrywho had grown to like him and whoas a lawyer thought his little inheritance could not be much longer withheld It would free him it would veryprettily furnish their quarters and stillleave a few hundreds to the fore Heremembered too thatUncleMellen hadmade some inquiries of him and thatin perfect frankness he hadAnd now just at Ihe moment when hewas full of hope and happiness camethis cruel mortification Such actionon the part of his creditors was unaccountable but as the superintendentsaid it was a solemn fact Deeply chagrined he told the colonel he wholestory and the colouel was full of symnathyo btii as full of senseTm sorry Merriam saidhefbutrhcici only one thing for you to doSTheres no telling when youli ever get Ithat inheritance When lawyers onceget hold of an estate its dollars todimes nobody else ever does and by thetime judgment is awarded in your favor it will be eaten up in- fees and innumerable charges You cannot counton a cent of it You cannot save anything to speak of here Just capitalizethose debts of yours borrow the moneyfrom some business man on reasonabletime and interest get your life insuredin his favor and go out and join ourtroop We can have you relieved as atyour own request and once out on thefrontier you can save so much a monthand little by little pull yourself outAnd leaving his pretty sweethearthis

surroundings were concerned ascould be found in the west It stoodon a pebbly mesa flat and barren overlooking the narrow tortuous shallowcanyon through which rippled thewaters of the San Mateo Across thewestern Jiorizon hung a low jaggedcurtain of distant blue mountains Faraway to the northwest a snow peakshimmered in the dazzling sunshinebut north east and south the low rolling contour of the prairie like theground swell of the ocean was lost inillimitable monotonv The onlv treeswere some willows down in an arroyothat emptied its rivulet after a rainstorm into the stream The onty

lines of railway met at thejunction three miles down stream andby riding a few miles westward onecame suddenly upon a fertile valleywhere grass and trees abounded andwhere all nature seemed to smile andwhere by rights the old post shouldhave been located but all that was Indian reservation when Sedgwick wasbuilt and not until long after did theterritorial officials succeed in gettingit lopped off from Los allotment andthrown open to settlement Along thebowery shades of the Santa Clara werenow ranches by the dozen and a hundred or more of enterprising settlersand between them and the thronginggarrison at Sedgwick was peace andgood will and every kindly relationwhen Randy Merriam came out in theDecember of the Columbian jear determined to take his punishment likea man He had sworn off cigars andextravagances of everv kind For atime he even declined to subscribe tothe hops which were charming affairsfor the band was excellent and the regiment blessed with many lovelj1 andlovable women Merriam spends allof his money in stamps was the comment of the garrison wits for he wroteday after day to his distant darling inthe east That winter Ned Parry accepted the junior partnership in thegreat firm of Graeme Rayburn inChicago and moved thifher with hislovely wife while Fan remained withAunt and Uncle Mellen in Gotham pining presumably for her far away soldier boy and yet writing much less frequently than he did for the demandsof society were incessant and auntiekept her on the goOne day in April there came a letterfrom the east at sight of which RandyMerriams faee was radiant with joyIt briefly told him that the long litigation was over and that some 3500 allthat was left of the original 6000 wereat his disposal Jubilantly confidentlythen he wrote to Fanny to name theday and in course of time there came areply long self-accusing- penitentmiserable- but all sufficient The daywas named and so was the man MrJohn Harold McLane of New York awealthy widower of 55 tThe wedding of Miss Hayward andMr McLane followed so speedily the announcement of the engagement thatelderly club men long- years the chumsof the groom barely had time to concoct suitable forms of compliment andcongratulation The reception whichfollowed the ceremony however wason such a scale of magnificence as toleave little room for doubt that the Mellens hud long been preparing for theevent The business relations existingfor a decade between Uncle Mellen andJohn McLane were well understoodIndeed the match was declared1 to be ofUncle Mellens making and the wholetransaction was openly referred to byyounger club men as a most Mellen ch oily affair Charlotte Parry wenton fromChicago to attend it but Ned her devoted lord pleading very pressing professional engagements positively refused to go He wrote a letter to UncleMellen about that time however whichgave other reasons for his-non-attendanceand to whioh the recipient afterseveral attempts found it impossible toreply Mrs Parry hastened back toChicago immediately after the reception and from that day neither she norher husband set foot within the Mellensdoors Aunt Charlotte declared theconduct of her niece most undutifulungrateful unaccountable but herhusband said nothingThe bride was a vision of girlish beauty -that bright June wedding day andMcLane was as handsome and wellpreserved a fellow of 55 as even NewYork could show He was evidentlydeeply in love and immeasurably proudand As for the lady she lookedto the full as joyous and radiant as anylover lord could ask and her mannertoward McLane much more

selection isafforded by some details recently givenpublicity to in connection with a prominent herd on the other side of thechannel About a dozen years ago themilk of all the cows comprised in thisherd over GO in number was carefully analyzed Nine of the cows werefound to be yielding milk showing over5 per cent of butter fat 22 werayielding over 4 per cent 14 wereyielding over 4 per cent and 23 wereyielding under 4 per cent Prom thisdate onward calves were onty keptoff the cows which yielded milk showing over 4ys per cent of butter fatand the tribes of the others were gradually weeded out By the aid of nregularly kept milk record the product of ever j cow is known and noneis kept for any length of time whichdoes not yield over 600 gallons per annum By combining what is learnedfrom the analysis and the milking record and only keeping calves from cowawhose produce is up to the standardalike in quantity and quality themilking properties of the cows havebeen so improved that at present over60 per cent of its members are yielding milk showing over 5 per cent and75 per cent are yielding milk showingover 4y2 per cent of butter fat Thisresult has only been attained by

effects onhuman life and happiness What the dyspeptic needs is not local treatment notmere temporary stimulus The real needis the toning up of the entire system Fortify the system and it will do its own fighting and promptly eject any intrudingdisease The success of Dr Ayers Sarsaparilla in curing indigestion and dyspepsia is due to just this quality which itpossesses of renewing the vital

fact that she had a place in theworld of business that enabled her to regardherself as being on an equality with manBut there was one thing that annoyed herI go down on the car early every morning she said with a young man who livesa little farther out than I do and I dontmind saying that he doesnt know whatcourtesy and gentlemanliness isWhat does he do inquired her bigbrother who doesnt think very much ofnew women anyway and is consequently opposed to his sister being in the world of businessIt isnt what he does she replied itswhat he doesnt do Time and again he haslet me stand up all the way downtown whenit would seem as if the very least he couldhave done was to get up and offer me hisseatThat is wrong isnt it returned thebig brother VIts contemptible selfishness thats whatit is she answeredThe fact that he is in possession of aseat went on the big brother of coursedoes not entitle him to it if a fellow clerk ofthe opposite sex happens to want it Andyet men in business will do those thingsWhy I know a girl who has twice the grievance vou have in that linpWhats happened to her she askedMan there first and refused to give upwhen she came along he explainedGive up his seatPNo give up his job She has discoveredthat it would just about suit her but thegreat big brute of a man hasnt chivalry andcourtesy enough to get up from his desk bowpolitely and say Madam permit me to
