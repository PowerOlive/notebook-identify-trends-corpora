WfflTNG A STORY WMll hAOiT to xttn away Ut ww I - vv JZ
bow pretty they always read
i Mtoriaa ouff the bedtime book
fcxriikeLwas The Daring Deed
terribl risk he took
Ufamk yttfca book on he shelf
Xfeliem SVL write a stoiy tnytelf
easy to write as they are to read
like those in the bedtime book
AA Ill call mine The Terrible Deed
And have it a daring risk that he toek
AmS while I tell it you will write -And
well hvQ the story finished tonight
30 Xioat feel sleepy at all
AmLXsh plenty warm with my arms out bo
AaweM eay the man was very tall
juml he and liis horse were lost in the snow
AmA Uten at his ddor he knocks and knocks
AadwdM say that -the man has cravon locks
Kami Ill thank you not to say
JBmlpai drowsy and all like that
JLjhL tfae mttc -kept knocking and knocked all
Mmm wiat are you laughing at
JL4be was hungry and cold and mad
Foe tke weather was stormy and very bad
UfStem in the darkness he saw a light
JLad be followed it and he fiercely strode
Jkad tfcreogh the forest and through the night
It brought him home in a turn of the road
Twma the stable dodr where hed stood and
stoed
Foe tbe hosee was farther on in the wood
2fow is it finished Let me see
r getting so tired that I forget
Bat Im wide awake as I can be
I havent thought of sleeping yet
Aad remember the light was down the
it road
Jknd the man with the craven locks he
strode
So ended the story which all may read
Like to the one in the bedtime book
But lacking still the daring deed
And the terrible risk that the hero took v
Aad tlie sleeper hears in dreams the knocks
Qi the bungry man with the craven locks

ME HAEBEETON
No tld man of course I dont be
lieve In spirits or nonsense of that sort
Yet Something that I never quite un-
derstood once happened to me You all
r
knowabout that kind of thing and per-
liaps you can explain it
After I left Oxford without hon
xs I spent a lot of time loafing at
home It was a slow part of the coun
try nothing much to shoot and moth
er an invalid couldnt stir out of her
room
I didnt mean deliberately to de
ceive her but what life is there for a
healthy young man stuck down there
hanging round a sickroom from one
month to another He must come to the
surface to breathe whether the air be i enter
wholesome or not At first when I cut
for a day or two I would call it busi
ness but the mater knew old Findlay
had always managed the investments
and the money and all that So when
I took a run up to town and didnt re
turn at night I had to invent a friend
and to pretend I had put up with him
That came as easy as lying always does
her insisted on hearing all the particu
lars how my friend looked what he
said and the rest I got into a lot of
tight places at the start till I thought
rofijMiIhad knbwn two vearsbefore
TSadeptto a description of him
Harberton was his name He was
craising on the Mediterranean for his
health when I was on the Sayonara
niS him to come that she
jnight hav n upportunity of thanking
liuri for hi toward her son
I did feel i iui when I took the invita
tion into room and bnrnd it
fTelEt iining he was toar e I
meant to IV- up a telegram soil nw
giying an i nsQ for his ahsenc e aen
I went t ht station on preu oof
aaieeting Mi a My mother was Et ige
Myeiil tia morning Her enstomnrv

Mumzuae wi pain iiad vanhed
Vfm recliui on a couch drawn rv in
i4b open window Her cheeks wore
rosy u there was a lace
ovt i r white hair that mada h ir
lode pcet than I had ever Been her
SbSwaa lil xinpatience to see Harber
ioor and riedme off to the station
half an too loon
Kow m neednt believe what fol
lowiJfc yon like I often demtit
my If I iliew lomething was
I te sGnnd of the coming
xis I watched thr train
jv
tb mrreof tim list I
v
not Of course there are seldom many
passengers for Glemsford This time
there was but one I caught a glimpse
of his face at the window of a carriage
where he sat alone and my heart seem
ed to stop beating A moment later he
stood before ma It was Harberton He
was exactly as I remembered him
There was nothing in his appearance
or manner to account for the dread in
me We exchanged greetings but no
word passed between us We traversed
the leafy lanes as in a dream but they
and myself were visionary he alone
was reaL And all the time the memory
of the telegram I had omitted to send
kept recurring to my half paralyzed
braim
I knew it could not be Harberton
yet felt convinced it was none other
Dull wonder whether of not mother
would see as I did ran through my
mind but I was in reality too stupefied
to be capable of anything like consec
utive thought
The path we trod led through th
orchard into the rose garden whereon
the low windows of my mothers sum
mer parlor opened As we entered the
garden she saw us saw him and
waved her thin hand in welcoma And
Harberton or what I took to be Harber
ton who till then had done nothing
but make me dread his presence waved
Hn return courteously almost gayly
I cant tell you how that day passed
It seemed like a long drawn out night
mare I kept saying to myself I am
asleep I shall awake soon Har
berton sat in my mothers cool dark
ened room talking of me as I gathered
while pacing restlessly within and
without or smoking in a 3hair outside
the window She seemed to speak anx
iously about my future I suppose like
most only sons reared by mothers I had
been rather wild and he appeared to
reassure her She was quite soothed and
happy in his company I moved about
I would go to the stables to speak to the
men or wander aimlessly about but
there was ever that awful sense of all
being an illusion I fancied I must be
mad and I feared the sound of my own
voice
Harberton went as he came through
the byways carpeted with moss and
overhung with brier roses still holding
no speech with me who followed dog
like Midway down the lane the even
ing haze caught radiance from a shaft
of the sunset and into the glory of it he
passed along For a moment I dared not
When I did he was gone
Well in a short time I was able to
laugh at the occurrence as absurd
Mother seemed to feel happy in some
sort of a delusion I didnt care to ridi
cule She never asked me to send for
Harberton again She always said
When it is time he will come
She got more fragile daily One
night she looked so ethereal that fear
Only mother who had little to interest ing to leave her I sent the nurse to bed
umbrellas will be in
and staid in her room All was hushed
and I must have dozed off to be ronsed
by mother s voice sayfng gladly Oh
yon have come for me That is so good
of youl
The light of the harvest moon filled
the room eclipsing the feeble glow of
the night light
Mother had raised herself to a sit-
wifeh the Blakes He was a queer chap ting position and was looking up eager-
believed iii occultism and rot of that ly joyfully her thin hands extended
eorfc and we all laughed at him for it
We never thought him ill merely lazy
One moonless night after dining on his
yacht we lounged on deck with those
myriads of stars making us feel iolly
smart
Harberton lay on a steamer chair
-he used to pass the night there gazing
at the sky with his inscrutable eyes
Wehad all been laughing and chaffing
when he came on deck but somehow
the immem ty of it all had sobered us
and vre wore quiet and selesKi when
Herbg0n pointing heavenward said
in his languid affected drawl Tomor
tow I shall know what these have to
telL We believed it to be merely one
of his poses but in the morning we
were horribly startled by the news that
he was dead He had died lying there
in his chair during the night
Well Harberfons name occurred to
me when I was forced to invent a story
to satisfy mother and though I couldnt
write a story to save my life whenever
I began jawing about him everything
cme quite pat Often I blessed his
memory when I could go off for a few
days have a good time and return to
find mother quite pleased
This went on for awhile till mother
began to bother me with a request to
-ask my friend to visit us at Frempton
- Glemsford I tried hard to get her off
the notion I said that he was busy or
ill that ent taining guests would hurt
her and all manner of things E ut she
seemed ger cn it talked nothing else
The docto
Bending over her I saw distinctly the
figure of Harberton Starting forward
I rushed toward her but before I could
reaohyher side she sank back inert Har
berton had vanished and the moonlight
revealed only her dead face lying peace
fully smiling en the pillows
