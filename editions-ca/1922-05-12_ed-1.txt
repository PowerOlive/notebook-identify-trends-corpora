Just when thiswill be is said to be problematical,but President James C. Stone haspointed out the fact that the cropof 1921 is the shortest since thecut-out of 1908, and the governmentreports , required of manufacturersshow that their holdings are lessthan they were a year ago. President Stone has had many inquiriesfor the redried leaf held by the association and has fcold some of it.These inquiries have come from asfar away as Denmark, a representative of a Copenhagen tobacco concern having called at the office ofthe association the past week.It was said to be certain that thedistribution to the growers of thethird payment on their crops, whichprobably will be the final one, willshow that the growers who joinedthe association have received morenet money for their tobacco, besidespaying their warehouse installmentand the entire expense of conductingthe Burley Association, includingsalaries and office expenses.No one in authority at the Burleyoffices would make any prediction asto when the third and probably finalpayment this year would be made,as it was said that that payment depended entirely on the time of saleof the re-dried holdings of the association, but that is expected to be adevelopment of a few weeks at themost.Secretary H. Lee Early was busythe past week signing the checks togrowers which will be sent out May20. There are about 75,000 of thesechecks, including, landlords, tenants,banks to which growers have assigned their certificates from growers. Secretary Early uses a machine in signing these checks, whichpermits him to sign five of them atone operation, but he still will haveto sign his name 15,000 times beforethe 'checks will be ready to send tothe directors, who will distributethem to the growers.PARIS BOYS ARE PBEED OFCHARGEJohn Clay and Robert Burnett,both of Paris, occupants of an automobile which collided, with a -motorcycleridden by Chester Adams andWm.

IFWD ANCIENT: SCRIPTvWriting Similar to Chinese Discovered in Idaho.Scientists Will Explore Caves and Decipher the Writing Befoni Reveal-ing Location May FindValuable Relics.,Boise, Idaho. Symbols and signs,chiseled, it is believed, ages ago, werediscovered recently on lava rocks ina remote section of Owyhee county,southwestern Idaho.Many of the inscriptions bearstriking resemblance to Chinese alphabet characters of today, it wassaid, although archeologists say theymay be anywhere from 400 to 30,000years old.Discovery of the inscriptions, whichare said to be a mine of archeologicaltreasure, was made by Robert Limbert, a Boise taxidermist. Their exactlocation will not be made public untilthey are examined thoroughly thissummer by a number of scientists whoare coming here.The volcanic rock on which the inscriptions are carved is scattered overa 30-acre sagebrush flat. In the immediate vicinity are several largecaves, around the entrance of whichthe rocks also are inscribed. It is believed these caves never have -beenexplored. Possibly, it Is said, theycontain many relics of scientific value.Two distinct types of carvings, ideographic and pictographic, 'have beennoted. Archeologists believe the ideographic antedates by many years thepictographic. Both systems have beenfound together on one rock and nearthem can be discerned what appearsto be a third system, supposed to antedate both of the others, but which hasweathered beyond possibility of deciphering. Clear bits of this prehistoric writingare found on one huge water-wornbowlder 25 feet long, 14 feet wide and5 feet high. Near the center is aseries of triangles believed to indicateIndian tepees, and next to them arerows of dots and dashes, thought tobe numerals.Resemblance of many of the' inscriptions to the characters of theChinese alphabet was taken by someto substantiate the theory that theNorth American native descendedfrom a race which came from Asiaby way of Bering straits.Indians now living in Idaho, whenquestioned regarding the carvings, saythe more modern or pictographic arethe work of their forefathers, butthey assert the others to be the workof spirits.SOVIETS KILLED 22.

A cablegram receivedby Charles V. Vickrey, general secretary of Near East Relief, dated Alexandropol, tells of how investigation byAmerican relief workers has revealedterrible starvation among refugees andorphans with the break-up of winter inthe mountain villages of central Armenia. Foodstuffs throughout' the area areexhausted, the cable says, and continues : "Bread is made from all sortsof substitutes, including flax, chaff andsawdust, having no appreciable foodvalue. The people are extracting undigested materials from old refuse andgiving it to the children. Health conditions are critical" Gastric and intestinal troubles prevail, due to malnutrition. A large per cent of thepeople are suffering from skin diseases.One-fourth of the adults are incapaci-.tated and bedridden."In the villages visited there are1,500 orphans who should be removedimmediately if they are to live. Evenin small villages the weekly death listincludes ten children. In many villagesall children have lost their hair duringthe winter. Several cases were so desperate that the people resorted to eating human flesh, which practice wassharply punished by the authorities.Oflicials said they are doing all theycan to prevent it, but the people losetheir senses from hunger. At Mahmaudchuk a family, of fifteen personswas visited a month ago. Now onlythree of the family remain. The deadinclude all the male members of thefamily. Great anxiety is expressedabout securing seed and grain forspring planting. The head man of thelargest village said : Tf we can secureseed we shall be on our feet by midsummer. If we don't get seed we aredoomed to death."Near East Relief has( sixty Americanrelief administrators, doctors andnurses in this area. During the winter,however, their supplies and resourceshave been so reduced that they havebeen able to'do little more than carefor the large number of orphans already accepted in institutions, a singleorphanage numbering 18,000 children.Secretary Vickrey declares that notonly the lives of the orphaned childrenthis spring, but the food supply forthe entire population next winter depends on the prompt dispatch withinthe next few weeks of grjyn for foodand seed from the United States.LAUGHING LION CUBThis youngster is laughing withand at you.

Thereare not very many normal humanbeings, after all, who deliberately orconsciously neglect their mothers.When they do, they do so unconsciously, under stress of circumstances. And all they need to get theminto the habit or fashion of givingmother her dues of showing the affection which she craves and whichdeep in their hearts they have always felt for her is a strong suggestion from some quarter. Theysuddenly remember that they havebeen forgetting her, and thereis no pains too great for them to takeA.mtmm..J i."?to convince her that mother is first ,in all the world to them. h1.The qualities in men -which reallymean strength) which go to form..vchivalrous manhood and exaltedcharacter, are the qualities which i vtrue motherhood always installsinto those around, it. . ,There is an incalculable amountof nobility and generosity in theworld, in spite of the enormousnumber of things that go wrong.And it is in the hearts of the mothers of the world that this nobilityand generosity is propagated.oWAILPIASTEEJust received a carload of wall!plaster and hydrated lime.

(ady)QUESTIONS WISDOM OF PUBLISHING TOBACCO PAPER(Falmouth Outlook)The press throughout the whiteburley tobacco district has helped tomake the Burley Co-operative Association a success and without exception the newspapers put theirshoulder to the wheel and did everything they could to establish a market for tobacco. This was all donefree of charge. The success of themovement meant more to each country newspaper than it did to the tobacco growers individually. Nowthat the association has been established, the officials of the associationhave conceived the idea to publisha newspaper twice a month, and saddle the expense on tobacco growers.The small paper will be used to keepthe growers informed on what theassociation is doing just what thecountry press has been doing free ofcharge. We cannot understandwhat the officials want to pay forsomething that has been given freely, unless they will have more roomfor the officials' names and pictures.This newspaper will cost the tobaccogrowers in the neighborhood of $1,000 per issue, and issued twice amonth will cost at least $20,000 peryear. As yet we have not receiveda notice that the association doesnot want more free support.Reporters have been admitted tothe British parliament since 1835.Banner LyeT is easy to useNo other lye is packed sosafely and conveniently, or is so economical not a bit wasted.No other lye or soap deans and disinfectsso easHy and thoroughly as Banner Lye.

Liquors having a valuein the legitimate market of more than$300,000,000 and worth in bootlegchannels more than $1,000,000,000,shipped from the United States to foreign countries just before tiie Volsteadact went into effect on January 16,1922, eventually will find their wayback to this country, under the provisions of the Willis-Campbell actpassed by congress last November tosupplement the national prohibitionlaw, according to John D. Appleby,general prohibition agent in charge ofNew York and -New Jersey.Big Shipment Enters.Already one big shipment has beenmade to this country under the provisions of the supplemental law. Ginvalued In bootleg circles at $3,000,000was reimported from Cuba about twoweeks ago. The distillery which madethe shipment had gone out of business, a fact that apparently was notdlscovered by the government agentsuntil the gin had arrived here. A special permit had to be obtained fromWashington before it could be storedin a local warehouse, pending itswithdrawal for meuicinal purposes onpermits from the director's office.Prohibition agents were mystified Inchecking up the cargo to note on themanifest 112 empty barrels. Theyhave not yet been able to make outthe reason for the empties, but Federal Prohibition Director Ralph A.Day regarded It a a suspicious circumstance. --"- 'a ' :, rt(tThe passage of the Willis-Campbelllaw, ostensibly for the purpose of killing medicinal beer, has made it possible for the thirsty to be suppliedwith good liquors for a much longerperiod than appeared likely beforethe measure was adopted, prohibitionofficials said. In some quarters theprovision for the reimport of liquorswas considered as a "joker'.Stored in Other Countries.The law provided "that the commissioner may authorize the return tothe United States, under such regulations and conditions as he may prescribe, any distilled spirits of American production exported free of taxand reimported in original packagesin which exported and consigned forredeposit in the distillery bondedwarehouse from which originally removed." Liquors have been stored in Franceand other countries in large quantities, according to Mr. Appleby. Theprohibition department plans to scrutinize carefully the applications forpermits to reimport.What Is regarded as another "joker" In the supplemental law is theprovision which exempts payment oftax and penalty for distilled spiritsupon which the tax has not been paidwhich are "lost by theft, accidentalfire or other casualty while In possesslon of a common carrier subject tothe transportation act of 1920 or themerchant marine act, 1920, or If lostby theft from a distillery or otherbonded warehouse."FIX MAIL SERVICE.

Wells, chairman of the commission. E. T. Pollard, county judge of Shelby county,was cited to appear before the commission to show cause why thecounty -should not be reassessed bythe State Commission.A dozen or more counties havefailed to meet the instructions ofthe commission that assessments beincreased. The commission has refused to accept the figures of theequalization boards and sent the recapitulations back to the counties.There is a clause in the 1917 taxlaw, allowing the commission to reassess counties, at the expense ofthe counties, when assessments failto reach the requirements of thecommission. It has never been involved before, but with assessmentsfinally based on full cash values ofproperty it is the intention, according to commission members, to enforce every phase of the law.oCATARRHCatarrh Is a local disease greatly influenced by constitutional conditions.HALL'S CATARRH MEDICINE is axomc, taKen internally, and acts tnrougnthe blood upon the mucous surfacesof the system.

The modernAmerican Indian may be said to bepaying bis own way in pursuit of aneducation, for nearly all funds expended in the education of the Indiansof Oklahoma belong to the tribe administered under the department of theinterior, according to H. C. Calhoun,supervisor of the Five Civilized Tribesschools here. These schools formthe largest unit of Indian sclioolls operated under one supervision in thecountry, he added.. The supervision of the schools ofthe five civilized tribes Cherokee,Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek andSeminole has to deal with threephases of school activity which 0 areranked in importance as follows:Tribal boarding schools, public dayschools and private contract schools.Have Nine 'Boarding Schools.There are nine tribal boardingschools and seven contract schools,while the public day school systemincludes 2,306 districts with an enrollment of about 18,000 Indian children.The supervisor's office has jurisdiction over the Indian pupil only inthese day schools, not over the publicschool as such.The tribal boarding schools are maintained for each-distinct tribe and thecompleted educational plants. Each isequipped with kitchen, dining-room,dormitory, laundry, hospital and facilities for industrial and academic education. Most of these schools have alarge acreage which is tilled andthe product used in the maintenanceof the school.Emphasize Industries.Agriculture is emphasized in all theIndian industrial schools, although shopwork, carpentry, leather machine andmetal work, homemaking for girls andscientific home economics are all apart of the industrial course. Theindustrial program is a part-time process, Mr. Calhoun explained, with thepupil devoting half his time to industrial education and half to academic instruction. The academiccourses are designed particularly forthe Indian.Six of the contract schools are denominational institutions, according toMx. Calhoun, while the seventh is astate agricultural school.
