Shredder Is the BestKnown MethodAllow the corn to stand in the fielduntil the grain begins to harden andthe bottom leaves are turning yellowSecure as much of the fodder as possible while it is green Cutting mustbe done before frost or the blades willbe brittle and break off causing aloss of the best part of the feed Placein shocks of medium size They mustbe large enough to stand well butsmall

cured then cutthe remainder Shocks 12x12 hills areabout the best sizeThe shocks must remain in the fielduntil the entire plant is thoroughlydried Not only must the blades bewell cured but the stalks must be freefrom moisture to instire perfect keeping in the stack or after shredding andstoring in the mow The time requiredwill depend upon the season but usually five or six weeks will be sufficientIt can then be put into a stack or rickarranging- the bundles or arrafuls offodder as in stacking small grain Ifleft in the open field as is often donethere is great loss from exposure ofthe surface of the shocks to the weatherand the occasional twisting downof a shock Stack where it will be mostconvenient in feedingRunning the crop through a huskerand shredder is the ideal way of taking care of corn fodder There is someobjection to this method on the scoreof the fodder molding in the mowIf it is thoroughly dried out beforeit is shredded there is little dangerfrom this source The

FactsFit in with His Theory ofthe WorldWell T suppose by this time yourfriends the Spanish will begin to believethey really did get the hot end ofit at Santiago said one Long Islandsuburbanite to anotherOh no said the man who livedin Spain before he settled in FlatbushNot at allWhatI say not at all You dont understand the Spanish people 1 dont understand them for that matter but Ihave picked tip one or two points in thecourse of a long experience Let metell you a story in illustration Onesummer evening when I was at schoolin England not in Spain four or fiveof us boys were watching- the stinsetPresently a young Spaniard who hadonly recently arrived and he happenedto be from Ilavana too came andjoined us We had just been wonderingwhy the sun seemed to get so flat as itgot near to the horizon We all noticedthat the sun did seem to flatten and weall had different ways of accountingfor the phenomenon By way of being civil to this foreigner who understood hardly six words of English atthat time one of us told him in Frenchwhat we were talking about He nodded and smiled just to show that heunderstood but he was standing withhis back to the sun and didnt turnaround to look at itThe acting interpreter was instructed to ask the Spanish gentleman if hecould tell us why the sun seemed to beswelling out right and left like thatBut the Spanish gentleman smiledaffably still keejung his back to thesun Then Ave suggested to him all ourdifferent explanations one after another but he dismissed every one ofthem with a grave courteous smile anda shake of his head At last when ourinterpreter once more demanded of himthe Ilavana theory of the thing hevouchsafed to say in FrenchTt does not look so because it cannot The sun is round And all thatwe could do could not make that Spaniard turn round and look at the sunfor himselfHm said theuntraveled Americanhe must have been particularly mulishNot part icularly said the other IIit comes to being mulish I can give otheiinstances just as strong Do you knowhow the drive mules in the PyreneesNo they dont light fires under themthat would make them go too fastI mean on those mountain roads Thedriver gets together a lot of stones onthe box beside him and every nowand then when the mules get too slowhe just fires a rock at the leaders headAt least that was what my driver didand it interested me very much forit was when I first Avent to Spain andeverthing interested me So I askedm 3 driver AAhy he didnt use a whipHe looked at me verv seriouslv andsaid that a Spanish mule didnt needa AAhip I thought he Avas making- funof me so I climbed out on the seat beside him and poked at theAvheeler Avithan alpenstock I had strapped up Avithmy Avaterproof and things Well I hadto stop it and apologize or get out andfight the driver on that narroAV lonelyroadsideWhy Didnt your plan work aswell as the bombardingIt made the mules go all right butsaid it didnt He said theywere not cdmmon mules but Pyreneeanrmiles of blue blood and that if I didit again they would be insulted anddie right there rather than haul us astep further He himself Avas veryand sAvore betAveen his teeth andhe fired a fresh broadside of rocks justwhen the mules were really doing unusually wellBut about the coolest piece of polite obstinacy I ever met in Spain Avasat a little country railroad station IAvas so inconsiderate as to ask the station master if he thought my trainAvould be on time I ought to haeknoAvn that Spanish trains never arcon time as Ave understand the termThe answer I got Avas enough to Aviltme The station master smiled magnanimously and boAvecl and said Sinembargo senor Without doubt sirBut the schedule time came and notrain I couldnt say any more to- thestation master on that subject but hel saAv me look at the clock once or tAviceAs it turned out the train Avas unusually punctual only 40 minutes late Thestation master gave me another Ioav boAas I got on board and then 1 saw himdeliberately climb

Have MarriedDidnt Like the Idea of Younjr FellowsIn Officers Clothes She Relented a tittle When Her Admirer Was WoundedThe only bad feature of this thingof addressing the school children saidColonel James A Sexton the formerpostmaster is the fact that they always want me to wear my regimentalsIts a thing I havent the courage to doexcept when Im among a uniformedbody of menJMy aversion to wearing a uniformabout iii public dates from my boyhooddays Upon that aversion is based anearly incident that may have had agood deal to do with the course of mysubsequent lifeI enlisted as a private at the outbreakof the war being then a boy of 17rather mature looking however forthose years Like all boys of that ageI was of a romantic turn but exceedingly bashful in the presence of womenThe one woman in whose presence I wasespecially shy was a dear girl whom Iused to see home from prayer meetingNo parting in all that time of parting was more affecting than was ourswhen my regiment started for the frontWhen a year later I was sent back toChicago to recover from a wound in thejaw I found myself as dear to her asever and she as dear to me it goeswithout saying I was in the hospitalat Camp Douglas My wound healedrapidly I was allowed to go about theity very much as I chose and prayermeetings with their escort privilegeslaiined a great part of my attentionAbout that time the Y M C Awas organizing a regiment to bo composed exclusively of men who professedreligion The scheme naturally attracted a great deal of attention The paperswere full of it I was selected to captain one of the new regiments companies Protest against tho selection wasmade on account of my age then just18 The matter was carried up to theadjutant general of the state who finally decided in my favor My age thesingular character of the case and thopopularity of the regiment caused suchan amount of newspaper gossip that itseemed as though everybody must haveheard of the matter at least All thistime I never wore my uniform outsideof camp The dear girl therefore never saw me except in citizeus clothesIts an outrage she said just afterwe met a very youthful looking man in Jbantams uniform on one of our walksthat such voung men are trusted with ritesthe responsibilities of command I dontknow what the country is coming toFor a moment I was overcome bythe shock When I recovered my breathI told her that youth did not necessarilydebar a man from possession of thequalities of a commander She declinedto be convinced and the conversationbecame decidedly chilly Instead ofmaking my customary call when wereached her house I stopped at the frontgateLaura I said I must tell yougoodby My regiment has orders toleave for the front tomorrow It maybe that we never shall see each otheragainBut we did All fashionable Chicagocame to Camp Douglas the next day tosee the final dress parade of the muchs talked of Y M C A regiment and Ijuiuu aeo mo uuui gut ULuuuy me uiuwuMy new captains uniform gave me agood deal of satisfaction just at thattime I can tell you The colonel of theregiment had asked me on acoount ofthe power of my voice to act as adjutant for the occasion That furnishedadditional gratification The parade hadthe magnificent splendor that only adress parade can have and the solemnityof this occasion was vastly increased bythe reflection not to be dismissed thatmany of those among regiment and spectators were seeing each other for thelast time on earth The band plaved asthough speaking our last farewell toour friends Every one I am sure wasdeeply impressed It was at tiis timethat the dear girl had her first and lastview of me in my captains uniformOfficers to the front and center 1March I ordered with all the dignityL could assume As they reached thecenter they saluted meSir the parade is formed I saidsaluting the colonelThe colonel returned as grave a salute as he had received and put the regiment through the manual of armsMeantime I marched a few paces behind him turned squarely and took position almost within arms length ofthe dear girl There I stood at paraderest with my back to her until theregiment wheeled into column to marchoff the field At that juncture I tookcommand of my company and wentwith it aboard an Illinois Central trainBetween the dear girl and myself therepassed no wordA few months passed and I receiveda slight wound The circumstance wasmentioned in the Chioago papers Thenfor the first time after my departurefrom Chicago the dear girl wrote me aletter It was a beautiful epistle fullof regret for our misunderstandinghopes that my wound would not proveserious assurances that she never couldhave doubted my ability and requestsfor forgiveness for her mistake I answered it and harmony was restoredAt the close of the war I at oncesought her the colonel added andfound her already married ChicagoTimes HeraldSheep In New South WalesIn the year 1788 there were only 29head of sheep in New South Wales butat the beginning of this century thenumber had increased to 2000000 andnow the stook has reached 60000000Australia New Zealand and Tasmaniatogether possess about 130000000sheep which is more than four tirneithe number in the whole of EuropeTHE WOODPECKERFour Characteristics of the tittle Drnmjuer of the WoodsThere is an article hy Frank SIChapman in St Nicholas on TheLittle Drummer of the Woods givingmuch curious information concerningthe woodpecker Mr Chapman saysIf we had woodpecker in our handswe should see in the beginning that itsbill is not slightly hooked with theupper mandible turned down at its endand overlapping the under mandible asin tho crow aud other birds that pickup a living but that both mandiblesare of equal length and cut squarelyoff at the tip It is thereforey like awedge or chiselPerhaps the tip of the birds tonguewill be seen appearing through its nearly closed mandibles and our attentionis at once attracted by its peculiarshape We discover that it is remarkably long and when fully extendedreaches almost if not quite an inch beyond the point of the bill It is notflat likq the crows but round andfleshy and has a sharp horny pointwhich by looking at it very closely wesee has a series of barbs on both sidesIn the meantime our hands havedoubtless been pricked by the birdstail feathers each feather being stiffbristly and pointed at the end Someof the larger woodpeckers the pileatedand ivorybill for instance have thissingular kind of tail feather highly developed The main stem or shaft of thefeather is much larger than usual andeach barb growing from this shaft iscurved downward and inward and isstrong and pointed Comparing thisfeather with the flat tail feather of acrow we see at once how different it isin formThe wings do not impress us as inany way unusual They are neithervery long nor very short but the arrangement of tho toes is so peculiarthat they were at once commented uponby a blind girl to whom I had handeda specimen of one of these birds Instead of the disposition common to mostbirds three toes diiected forward andone backward we discover two fronttoes and two hind ones and we willnote also that each toe is armed with astrong curved nailINVASION OF WASHINGTONAdmiral Cocklrarna Eih Soldiers Looted aud Fired the Public BuildingsThe last glimmer of twilight wasfading away when after the battle atBladensbnrg two miles distant fromWashington into the -well nigh deserted city rode the redoubtable Cockburnat the head of his band of maraudersClifford Howard in The LadiesHome Journal of the invasion and burning of our national capital by the British forces under Admiral Cockburn inAugust 1814 Elated at their decisivevictory over a force nearly twice aslarge as their own and thirsting

speakers chair from which withmock gravity he put the questionShall this harbor of the Yankee democracy be burned A yell of affirmationrang through the hall and without further preliminaries papers and othercombustibles were piled under the desksand set on fire In a few minutes thisnoble edifice that had been in course ofconstruction more than 20 years andcontaining the library of congress andvast quantities of official documents ofgreat historical value wras destroyedNow thoroughly aroused to theirwork of plunder a howling crowd ofthe desperate marauders hurried to theWhite House in tho hope perchance ofcapturing the president and his wifeFinding the house locked and desertedthey battered down the doors and consoling themselves for the loss of theirdistinguished captives by a ruthless destruction of the furniture they raidedthe larder and regaled themselves witha hastily prepared feast in the statedining room Then destroying the remaining provisions and breaking andmutilating whatever they could readilylay their hands on they concluded theirvisit by setting fire to the home of thepresident Numerous other public audprivate buildings were also destroyedby fireIA Carpet KnightThe following curious definitions of acarpet knight were recently given in anEnglish examination One who received his knighting upon the field ofthe cloth of gold a knight who stoodon a carpet and had another thrownover him while being knighted thecommon black beetle which whensquashed resembles all the differentshades of abrussels carpet a knightwhich sleeps on a carpet a

Iong AgoDuring the American Revolution anEnglish magazine published an estimateof the North American colonies Placing the population then at 2000000and assuming that it would double itself every 25 years the writer estimatedthat in the year 1890 the number wouldhave increased to 64000000 This maybe taken as a most remarkable prophecyinasmuch as the census of 1890 fixesthe total population at
