For Cancer
Few people axe born entirely free from
lipod taint This is oftea Yy Blight r

stall in one generation bnt breaks ont

Cancer the most dreadful of all dis
eases is often the result of some blood
fednt inherited from generations back
It often appears as a mere mole or i
ignificant pimple which latr 4eTlp

kiiows but that he may be subject to an
inherited impurity in the blood nor can
Ire tell whether or not thia may some
lay crop put in the form of destructive
cancer It is theref ore important that
Hiy little sore or scratch which des

tion or a serious condition may restdt
Mr -Robert Smedley of Ocala Fla
iris the victim of a malignant eancr
wfiich first appeared i the Maaer
akp e described He writes
M first I paid no attentien to the
Ettle blotches on my face thinking they
Tstiuld soon pass away Before long
Itowever they became soe and soon
began to enlarge I applied ordinary
local remedies but they had no effect
asid I then consulted a physician When
2se told me I had cancer I became
slprmed and hastened to obtain treat
ment for I knew how dangerous cancer
was
I received the best medical atten
tion but the cancer continued to
grow worse until the physicians
finally said that I would have to
Jiave an operation performed as that
-was the only hope for me This I re
fused to submit to as I knew cancer was
a blood disease and my common sense
told me that it was folly to expect an
operation to cure a blood disease
Knowing S S S to be a good blood
aremedy I decided to try it and the first
lxttle produced an improvement I
continued the medicine and in four
anonths the last scab dropped off Ten
years have elapsed and not a sign oi
-the disease has returned
The alarming increase in the number
of deaths which occur as the result of a
surgical operation is attracting general
attention and a strong sentiment against
such methods of treatment is fast de
veloping among the most intelligent
Masses It seems that in almost every
ase wiere the doctors treatment is
-unsuccessful the learned physicians de
cide at once that an operation must be
performed and the keen blade of the
surgeon is recklessly resorted to
The many caustic plasters which are
applied to remove cancers are more pain
ful than death and the danger of a sur
gical operation is as great as the disease
itself No plaster or surgical oper
ation can cure cancer because it is
blood disease the destructive cancer
-cells are in the blood and cannot be
cut out or removed by local treatment
As the disease must be forced from the

Why Many Criminals Are Easily Brought
to Justice
One reason why detectives appear
to do something miraculous occasional
ly is that there is after all very little
originality in criminals said one of
Chief Hazens sleuthhqunds recently
When a man sets out to get money
by crooked means he seldom sits down
and evolves a new plan On the con
trary he evidently thinks of the smart
cases he has heard of at different times
makes up his mind which suits him
best and copies the plan adopted very
closely indeed v
Hence when the detective sets out
he has in many instances quite a
string of precedents to take as guides to
the course the criminal will probably
pursue
One case years ago that helped me
immensely in the business was a forg
ery The man had disappeared and left
no clew whatever behind
I obtained access to his room and
found that he had developed a partial
ity for cutting scraps from newpapers
There was a whole drawerfnl of these
and I went through them carefully
Several had relation to forgery
cases and one cutting that appeared to
be pretty badly fingered described how
a forger had got away in womans at
tire
I worked on the theory that my
bird had flown in this manner and fol
lowed it up until I finally cot on the
track and captured the criminal
The capture was regarded as a very j
remarkable one but as a matter of
fact the runaway had left for me an
exceedingly valuable clew If he had
taken the precaution to burn that cut
ting ho might have escaped capture al
together Cincinnati Enquirer

Dont let me beg of you dont say

possibly because long practice on his
own signature makes the adverb easier
for him to write than the conjunction
Lately the word has begun to infest
the writings of English politicians pos
sibly as a result of association with the
Irish members of parliament for he
said how he was going is a literal
translation of the Gaelic equivalent of
he said that he was going But the
worst instance of its use appears in a
letter written by the Hon Auberon
