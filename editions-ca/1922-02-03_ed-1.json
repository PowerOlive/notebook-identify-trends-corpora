Saturday night Ernest Hughes, of
Leeslick, Harrison county, escaped
from Sheriff Ingels and Deputy
Sheriff Ammerman, of Harrison
county, after he had beenarrested on
a warrant charging him and an
other young man named Wood An
derson of the same vicinity, with the
theft of about 3,000 pounds of to
bacco from the barn of Vol W. Fer
guson, near Centerville, this county.
The Harrison county sheriffs ar
rested Hughes at Leeslick and took
him to Leesburg, where Sheriff M.
Peale Collier, of Bourbon county,
was waiting. Then it was arranged
to take Hughes back home where his
father would execute bond for his ap
pearance at the examining trial.
While the sheriffs were arranging the
bond, which' was partly written,
young Hughes' mother fainted, or be
came suddenly sick, and m the re
sulting confusion the young man
made a break for liberty, upsetting
furniture,- and rushing from the
room. He got away, and has not
been recaptured.
The tobacco in question was taken
from the Ferguson barn in a large
truck, and taken to Cincinnati, where
it was disposed of to a tobacco house,
the purchasers not knowing it had
been stolen. The men claimed the
tobacco as their own, and that they
had raised it m this county.
