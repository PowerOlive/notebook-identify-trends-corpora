Recommendation Says TheWar Must Stopdefers to the Battleship Maine Explosion ns a Sin of SpanishWeaknessWashington April 11 The presidentMonday sent the following message tothe congress of the United StatesObedient to that precept of the constitution which commands the president to giveirom time fco lime to congress informatfionof the state of the union and to recommend to their consideration such measuresas he shall judge necessary and expedientit becomes my duty now to address yourbody with regard to the grave crisis thatlias arisen in the relations of the UnitedStates to Spain by reason of the warfarethat for more than three years hasraged in the neighboring island of CubaI do so because of the intimate connectionof the Cuban question with the state of ourown union and the grave relation thecourse which it is now incumbent uponthe nation to adopt must needs bear tothe traditional policy of our governmentif it is to accord with the precepts laiddown by the founders of the republic andreligiously observed by succeeding administrations to the present dayUncivilized WarfareThe present revolution is but the successor of other similar insurrections whichhave occurred in Cuba against the dominion of Spain extending over a periodof nearly half a century each of whichduring its progress has subjected the United States to great effort and expense inenforcing its neutrality laws caused enormous losses to the American trade andcommerce caused irritation annoyance-and disturbance among our citizens andby the exercise of cruel barbarous anduncivilized practices of warfare shockedthe sensibilities and offended the humanesympathies of our peopleRavaged by Fire and SwordSince the present revolution began inFebruary 1S93 this country has sen thefertile domain at our threshold ravagedby fire and sword in the course of astruggle unequaled in the history of theislands and rarely paralleled as to thenumber of the combatants and the bitternessof the contest by any revolution of modern times where a dependent people striving to be free have been opposed by thepower of the sovereign state Our people have beheld a once prosperous community reduced to comparative want its commerce virtually paralyzed its exceptionalproductiveness diminished its- fields laidWaste its mills- in ruins and its peopleperishing by tens of thousands from hunger and destitution Wc have found ourselves constrained in the observance ofthat strict neutrality which our laws enjoini and which the law of nations- commands to police our waters and watch ourown seaports in prevention of any unlawfulact in aid of the Cubans Out trade hassuffered the capital invested by our citizens in Cuba has been largely lost andthe temper and vforbearance of our people has been so sorely tried as to beget aperilous unrest among our own citizenswhich has inevitably found its expression from time to time in the nationallegislature so that issues wholly externalto our own body politic engross attentionand stand in the way of that close devotion to domestic advancement that becomes a self contented commonwealthwhose primal maxim has been the avoidance of all foreign entangiements All thismust needsawakenand has indeed arousedthe utmost concern on the part of this government as well during my predecessorsadministration as my ownKiTorts for PeaceIn April 189G the evils from which ourcountry suffered through the Cuban warlecame so onerous that my predecessormade an effort to bring about a peacethrough the mediation of this governmentin any way that might tend to an honorable adjustment of the contest betweenSpain and her revolted colonv on thebasis of some effective scheme of self-governmentfor Cuba under the flag andsovereignty of Spain It failed throughthe refusal of the Spanish government thenin power to consider any form of mediationor indeed any plan of settlement which didnot begin with the actual submission ofthe insurgents to the mother country andthen only on such terms as Spain herselfmight see fit to grant The war continuedunabated The resistance of the insurgentswas in no wise diminishedSew Horrors AddedThe efforts of Spain were increased bothtoy the dispatch of fresh levies to Cuba andby the addition to the horrors of the strifeof a new and inhuman phase happily unprecedented in the modern historv of civilized Christian peopls The policy ofdevastation and concentration inaugurated by the captain generals bando of October 21 1S9G in the province of Pinar delJtio was thence extended so embrace all ofthe island to which the power cf the Span-ish arms was able to reach by occupation orby military operations The peasantry including all dwellings in the open agricultural interior were driven into the garrisontowns or isolated places held by the troopsThe raising and movement of provisions ofall kinds were interdicted The fields werelaid waste dwellings unroofed and firedmills destroyed and in short everythingthat could desolate the land and render ittinlit for human habitation or support wascommanded by one or the -other of the contending parties and executed by all thepowers at their disposal-Conditions a Year AroBy the time the present administrationtook office a year ago reconcentration so-called had been made effective over thebetter part of the four central and western provinces Santa Clara Matanzas Havana and Pinar del Rio The agriculturalpopulation to the estimated number of200000 or more was herded within thetowns and their immediate vicinage deprived of the means of support rendereddestitute of shelter left poorly clad andexposed td the most unsanitary conditionsAs the scarcity of food increased withthe devastation of the depopulated areasof production destitution and want became misery and Starvation Month bymonth the death rare -increased in analarming ratio By March 1S97 accordingto conservative estimates from official-Spanish sources the mortality among thereconcentrados from starvation and thediseases thereto incident exceeded 50 percentum of their total number Noical relief was accorded to the destitutee overburdened towns already sufferingm the general dearth could give

wilderness and the graveA Xotlceafele ChangeMeanwhile the military situation in theisland had undergone a noticeable changeThe extraordinary activity that characterized the second year of the war whenthe insurgents invaded even the hithertounharmed fields of Pinar del Rio and carried havoc and destitution up to the wallsof the city of Havana itself had relapsedinto a dogged struggle in the central andeastern provinces The Spanish arms regained a measure of control in Pinar delRio and parts of Havana but under theexisting conditions of the rural countrywithout immediate improvement of theirproductive situation Even thus partially restricted the revolutionists heldtheir own and their submission putforward by Spain as the essential and solebasis of peace seemed as far distant asat the outsetSteps Taken for ReliefIn this state of affairs my administrationfound itself confronted with the graveproblem of its duty My message of lastDecember reviewed the situation and detailed the steps taken with a view of relieving its acuteness and opening the wayto some form of honorable settlement Theassassination of the prime ministerCanovas led to a change of government inSpain The former administration pledgedto subjugation without concession gaveplace to that of a more liberal party committed long in advance to a policy of reform involving the wider principle ofhome rule for Cuba and Puerto Rico Theovertures of this government madethrough its new envoy Gen Woodfordand looking to an immediate and effectiveamelioration of the condition of the island although not accepted to the extentof admitted mediation in any shape wreremet by assurances that home rule in anadvanced phase would be forthwith offered to Cuba without waiting for thewar to end and that more humane methods should thenceforth prevail in the conduct of hostilities Incidentally with thesedeclarations the new government of Spaincontinued and completed the policy alreadybegun by its predecessor of testifyingfriendly regard for this nation by releasingAmerican citizens held under one chargeor another connected with the insurrectionso that by the end of November not asingle person entitled in any way to ournational protection remained in a SpanishprisonAn Appeal for HelpWhile these negotiations were In progress the increasing destitution of the urnfortunate reeoncentrdosi and the alarmingmortality among them claimed earnest attention The success which had attendedthe limited measure of relief extended tothe suffering American citizens- amongthem by the judicious expenditure throughthe consular agencies of the money appropriated expressly for their succor bythe joint resolution approved May 24 1S97prompted the humane extension of a similar scheme of aid to the great body ofsufferers A suggestion to this end wasacquiesced in by the Spanish authoritiesOn the 24th of December last I caused tobe issued an appeal to the American people inviting contributions in money or inkind for the succor of the starving sufferers in Cuba following this on the Sth elfJanuary by a similar public announcementof the formation of a central Cuban reliefcommittee with headquartersi in NewYork city composed of three members representing the American National Red Crossand the religious and business elements ofthe community The efforts of that commiittee have been untiring and accomplished much Arrangements f or free transportation to Cuba have greatly aided thecharitable work The president of theAmerican Red Cross and representativesof other contributory organizations havegenerously visited Cuba and co operatedwith the consul general and the local authorities to make effective distribution ofthe relief collected through the efforts ofthe central committee Nearly 200000 Inmoney and supplies has already reachedthe sufferers and more Is forthcomingThe supplies are admitted duty free andtransportation to the interior has beenarranged so that the relief at first necessarily confined to Havana and the largercities- is now extended through most if notall of the towns where suffering existsThousands of lives have already beenslaved The necessity for a change in thecondition of the is recognized by the Spanish government Withina few days past the orders of General Weyler have been revoked the recorocentrados are it is saidto be permitted to return to their homes and aided to resumethe self supporting pursuits ofpeace public works have been ordered to give thememployment and a sum of 000000 has beenappropriated for their reliefCan See Xo EndThe war in Cuba is of such a nature thatshort of subjugation or extermination afinal military victory for either side seemsimpracticable The alternative lies in thephysical exhaustion of the one or the otherparty or perhaps of both a conditionwhich in effect ended the ten years warby the truce of Zenjon The prospect ofsuch a protraction and conclusion of thepresent strife is a contingency hardlv tobe contemplated with equanimity by thecivilized world and least of all by theUnited States affected and injured as weare deeply and intimately by its very existenceAsked for an ArmisticeRealizing this it appeared to be my dutyin a spirit of true friendliness no less toSpain than to the Cubans who have somuch to lose by the prolongation of thestruggle to seek to bring about an immediate termination of the war To this endI submitted on the 27th ultimo as a result of much representation and correspondence through the United States minister at Madrid propositions to the Spanish government looking to an armistice until October 1 for the negotiation of peacewith the good offices of the presidentIn addition I asked the immediate revocation of the order of reconcentration so asto permit the people to return to theirfarms and the needy to be relieved withprovisions and supplies from the UnitedStates cooperating with the Spanish authorities so as to afford full reliefThe Reply of SpainThe reply of the Spanish cabinet wasreceived on the night of the 31st ult Itoffers as the means to bring about peacein Cuba to confide the preparation thereofto the insular department inasmuch as theconcurrence of that body would be necessary to reach a final result it being however understood that the powers reservedthe 4th of May next the Spanish government are not lessened or diminished Asthe Cuban parliament does not meet untilthe 4th of May next the Spanish government would not object for its part to accept at once a suspension of hostilities ifasked for by the insurgents from the general in chief to whom it would pertain insuch case to determine the duration andconditions of the armisticeThe propositions submitted bv GenWoodford and the reply of the Spanishgovernment were both in the form of briefmemoranda the texts of which are before me and are substantially in the language above given The function of theCuban parliament in the matter of preparing peace and the manner of its doing so are not expressed in the Spanishmemorandum but from Gen Woodfordsexplanatory reports of preliminary discussions preceding the final conference it isunderstood that the Spanish governmentstands ready to give the insular congressfull powers to settle the terms of peacewith the- insurgents whether bv direct negotiations or indirectly by means oZ legislation does not appearEnd of DiplomacyWith this last overture in the direction ofimmediate peace and its disappointing reception by Spain the executive was broughtto the end of his effortIn my annual message of December lastI caid t jOf tile untried measures there remainRecognition of the insurgents as belligerents recognition of the independence dfCuba neutral intervention to end thewar by imposing a rational compromisebetween the contestants and the intervention in favor of one or the other party Ispeak not of forcible annexation for thatlv - - i aim uy our coaeluiamj wuiiiu ue criminal aggressionThereupon I reviewed these alternativesin the light of President Grants measuredwords uttered in 1875 when after sevenyears of sanguinary destructive and cruelbarbarities in Cuba he reached the conclusion that the recognition of the independence of Cuba was impracticable andIndefensible and that the recognition ofbelligerence was not warranted by thefacts according to the tes s of public lawI commented especially upon the latter aspect of the question pointing out the inconveniences and positive dangers of arecognition of belLIgerency Which whileadding to th already onerous burdens ofneutrality within our own jurisdictioncould not n any way extend our influenceor effective offices in the territory of hostilities Nothing has since occurred tochange my view in this regard and IIMPERFECT IN ORIGINALM pgfffBfcranize as f ullv now as then that the issuanceof a proclamation of neutrality byVwhichprocess the so called recognition o belligerence is published could of itself andunattended by lother aetiion accomplishnothing toward the one end for which welabor the instant pacification of Cuba andthe cessation of the misery that afflicts theislandPrecedents from HistoryTurning to the question of recognizingat this time the independence of the present insurgent government in Cuba we findsafe precedents in our history from anearly day They are well summed up inPresident Jacksons message to congressDecember 21 383G on the subject of therecognition of the independence of TexasHe said In all the contests that havearisen out of the revolutions of Pranceout of the disputes relating to the crewsof Portugal and Spain out of the separation-of the American possessions of bothfrom the European governments and outof the numerous and constantly occurringstruggles for dominion in Spanish America so wisely consistent with our justprinciples has been the action of our government that we have under the mostcritical circumstances avoided all censure and encountered no other evil thanthat- produced by a transient estrangement of good will in those against whomwe have been by force of evidence compelled to decideOur Estalished PolicyIt was thus made known to the worldthat the uniform policy and practice of theUnited States is to avoid all interferencein disputes which merely relate to the internal government of other nations andeventually to recognize the authority ofthe prevailing party without reference toour particular interests and views or tothe merits of the original controversyBut on this as on every other trying occasion safety is to be found in a rigidadherence to principleIn the contest between Spain and the revolted colonies we stood aloof and waitednot only until the ability of the new statesto protect themselves was fully established but until the danger of their beingagain subjugated had entirely passedaway Then and not until then were theyrecognized Such was our course in regardto Mexico herselfThe Texas CaseIt is true that with regard to Texas thecivil authority of Mexico has been expelledits invading army defeated the chief of therepublic himself captured and all presentpower to control the newly organized government of to day annihilated within itsconfines But on the other hand there is inappearance at least ar immense disparityof physical force on the side of TexasThe Mexican republic under another executive is rallying its forces under a newleader and menacing a fresh invasion torecover its lost dominionUpon the issue of this threatened Invasion the independence of Texas may beconsidered as suspended and were therenothing peculiar in the situation of theUnited States and Texas our acknowledgment of its independence at such a crisiscould scarcely be regarded as consistentwith that prudent reserve

question is whether the community claiming recognition isy iigy iypwTHE NEWS PIKtS KY FMDAY APRIL 15 1898or is not independent beyond peradventureNor from the standpoint of expedience doI think it would be wise or prudent for thisgovernment to recognize at the presenttime the independence of the so calledCuban republic Such recognition is notnecessary in order to enable the UnitedStates to intervene and pacify the islandTo commit this country now to the recognition of any particular government inCuba might subject us to embarrassingconditions of international obligation towards the organization so recognized Incase of intervention our conduct would besubject to the approval or disapproval ofsuch government we would be required tosubmit to its direction and to assume toit the mere relations of a friendly allyWhen it shall appear hereafter that hereis- within the island a government capableof performing the duties and dischargingthe functions of a separate nation and having as a matter of fact the proper formsand attributes of nationality such government can be promptly and readily recognized and the relations and interests of theUnited States with such nation adjustedOur AlternativesThere remain the alternative forms of intervention to end the war either as animpartial neutral by imposing a rationalcompromise between the contestants oras the active ally of the one party or theotherAs to the first it is not to be forgottenthat during the last few months the relation of the United States has virtuallybeen one of friendly intervention in manyways each not of itself conclusive butall tending to the exertion of a potentialinfluence toward an ultimate pacific result just and honorable to all interestsconcerned The spirit of all our acts hitherto has been an earnest unselfish desirefor peace and prosperity in Cuba untarnished by differences between us and Spainand unstained by the blood of AmericancitizensIntervention JustifiableThe forcible intervention of the UnitedStates as a neutral to stop the war according to the large dictates of humanityand following many historical precedentswhere neighboring states have interferedto check the hopeless sacrifice of life byinternecine conflicts beyond their bordersis justifiable on rational grounds It involves however hostile constraint uponboth the parties to the contest as wellto enforce a truce as to guide the eventualsettlementGrounds for InterventionThe grounds for such intervention maybe briefly summariized as followsFirst In the cause of humanity and toput an end to the barbarities bloodshed starvation and horrible miseriesnow existing there and which theparties to the conflict are either unable or unwilling to stop or mitigateIt is no answer to say this is all in anothercountry belonging to another nation andis therefore none of our business It isspecially our duty for it is right at outdoorSecond We owe it to our citizens InCuba to afford them that protection andindemnity for life and property which nogovernment there can or will afford andi - rMUST I GET OUTII I I I II - I - - - I -- I - - IIhave hitherto held ourselves bound to treatall similar questionsThereupon Andrew Jackson proceeded toconsider the risk that there might be imputed to the United States of motives ofselfish interests in view of the former claimon our part to the territory of Texas and ofthe avowed purpose of the Texans in seeking recognition of independence as an incident to the incorporation of Texas inthe union concluding thusWords of JacksonPrudence therefore seems to dictatethat we should still stand aloof and maintain our present attitude if not until Mexico itself or one of the great foreign powersshall recognize the independence of thenew government at least until the lapse oftime or the course of events shall haveproved bevond cavil or dispute the abilityof the people of that country to maintaintheir separate sovereignty and to upholdthe government constituted by themNeither of the contending parties can justly complain of this course By pursuingit we are but carrying out the long established policy of our government a policywhich has secured to us respect and influence abroad and inspired confidence athomeConditions for RecognitionThese are the words of the resolute andpatriotic Jackson They are evidencethat the United States in addition tothe test imposed by public law as thecondition of the recognition of independence by a neutral state to wit that therevolted states shall constitute in fact abody politic having a government in sub-stance as well as in name possessed of theelements of stability and forming defacto if left to itself a state among thenations reasonably capable of dischargingthe duties of a state has imposed for itsown government in- dealing with cases likethese the further condition that recognition of independent statehood is nnt dueto a revolting dependency until tne dangerof its being subjugated by the parent statehas

of the islandFourth And which is of the utmost importance The present condition of affairsin Cuba is a constant menace to our peaceaad entails upon this government anenormous expense With such a conflictwaged for years in an island so near usand with which our people have such tradeand business relations when the lives andliberty of our citizens are in constant danger and their property destroyed and themselves ruined where our trading vesselsare liable to seizure and are seized at ourvery door by warships of a foreign nation the expeditions of filibustering thatwe are powerless to prevent altogether andthe irritating questions and entanglementsthus arising all these and others that Ineed not mention with the resultingstrained reliations are a constant menaceto our peace and compel us to keep on asemi war footing with a nation with whichwe are at peaceDestruction of the MaineI already pointed out have been strikinglyf illustrated bv a tragic event which hasdeeplv and justly moved the American people I have already transmitted to congress the report of the naval court of inquiry on the des iructiion of the battleshipMaine in the harbor of Havana during thenight of the lath of February The destruction of that noble vessel has filledthe national heart with Inexpressible horror Two hundred and fifty eight bravecn inrc a nri mavinps and two officers of ourravy reposing in the fancied security of afriendly hlarbor have been hurled to deathgrief and wa nt brought to their homesand forrow to the nationThe naval court of inquiry which it isneedless to say commands the unqualifiedconfidence of the government was unanimous in its conclusion that the destruction of the Maine was caused by an exterior explosion that of a submarine mineIt did not assume to place the responsibility That remains to bo fixedProof of Spains WeaknessTn ny event the destruction of th Mainebv whatever exterior cause is a patent andimpressive proof of a state of things inCuba that is intolerable That conditionis thus shown to be such that the Spanish cannot assure safety andsecuritv to a vessel of the American navyin the harbor of Havana on a mission ofpeace and rightfully thereFurther referring in this connection torecent diplomatic correspondence a dispatch from our minister to Spain of the26tli ult contained the statement thatthe Spanish minister for foreign affairsalssWed him positively that Spain will doall that the highest honor and justice reauire in fflie motter of the Maine The renlv above referred to of the 31st ult alsocontained an expression of the readinesteof Spain to submit to an arbitration ad thedifferences which can arise In this matterwnlch is subsequently explained by thenote of the Spanish minister atWashington of the 10th Inst as followsA Xote from SpainAs to the question of fact which springsfrom the diversity of views between thereport of the American and Spanishascertained by am impartial investigationby experts wmen aecisiuu opmn utucisin- advanceTo this I have made no replyGrant Is QuotedPresident Grant in 1S75 after discussingthe phases of the contest as it thenT3Tmifft JUKWWWWgpeared and Its hopeless and apparent indefinite prolongation saidIn such event I am of opinion thatother nations will be compelled to assumethe responsibility which devolves uponthem and to seriously consider the onlyremaining measures possible mediationand intervention Owing perhaps to thelarge expanse of water separating the island from the peninsula the contendingparties appear to have within themselvesno depository of common confidence tosuggest wisdom when passion and excite-ient have their sway and assume the partf peacemaker In this view in the earlierdays of the contest the good offices of theUnited States as a mediator were tenderedin good faith without any selfish purposein the interest of humanity and in sincerefriendship for both parties but were atthe time declined by Spain with the declaration nevertheless that at a future timethey Would be indispensableNo intimation has been received that inthe opinion of Spain that time has beenreached And yet the strife continues withall its dread horrors and all its injuries tothe interests of the United States and ofother natioms Each party seems quitecapable of working great injury and damage to the other as well as to all the relations and interests dependent on the existence of peace in the island but tjlieyseem incapable of reachSng any adjustmentand both have thus far failed of achievingany success whereby one party shall possess and control the island to the exclusionof the other Under the circumstances theagency of others either by mediaition orby intervention seems to be the only alternative which must sooner or later beInvoked for the termination of the strifeCleveland Is QuotedIn the last annual message of my immediate predecessor during the pending struggle it was saidWhen the inability of Spain to deal successfully with the -insurrection has becomemanifest and it is demonstrated that hersovereignty is extinct in Cuba for all purposes of its rightful existence and whena hopeless struggle for its reestablishmenthas degenerated 5nto a strife which meansnothing more than the useless Bacrificeof human life and the utter destruction ofthe very subject matter of the conflict asituation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain willbe superseded by higher obligations wh ichw can hardly hesitate to recognize anddischargeIn the Xear FutureIn my annual message to congress December last speaking to this question IsaidThe npar future will demonstratewhether the indispensable condition of arighteous peace just alike to the Cubansand to Spain as well as equitable to allour interests so intimately involved in thewelfare of Cuba is likely to be attainedIf not the exigency of further and otheraction by the United States will remainto be taken When that time comes thataction will be determined in the line ofindisputable right and duty It will befaced without misgiving or hesitancy inthe light of the obligation this governmentowes to itself to the people who nave confidedto it the protection of their interestsand honor and to humanityWill Act When the Time ComesSure of the right keeping free from alloffense ourselves actuated only by uprightand patriotic considerations moved neitherby passion nor selfishness the governmentwill continue its watchful care over therights and property of American citizensand will abate none of its efforts to bringabout by peaceful agencies- a peace whichshall be honorable and enduring If it shallhereafter appear to be a duty imposed byour obligations to ourselves to civilizationand humanity to intervene with force itshall be without fault on our part andonly because the necessity for such actionwill be so clear as to command the supportand approval of the civilized worldWar Must StopThe loi2T trial has proved that the objectfor which Spain has waged the war cannCtbe attained The fire of insurrection mayInflame or may smoulder with varying seasons but it has not been and it isi plain thatit cannot be extinguished- by present methods The only hops of relief and reposefrom a condition which cannot longer beendured i s the enforced pacification ofCuba In the name of humanity in thename of civilization in behalf of endangered American interests which give usthe right ar d the duty to speak and toact the war in Cuba must stopAsks Authority to ActIn view of these facts and these considerations I ask the congress to authorizeand empower the president to take measures to secure a full termination ofhostilities between the government ofSpain and the people of Cuba and to securein the island the establishment of a stablegovernment capable of maintaining orderand observing its international obligations insuring peace and tranquillity andthe security of its citizens as well as ourown and to use the military and navalforces of the United States as may benecessary for these purposesAnd in the interest of humanity and toaid in preserving the lives of the starving people of the island I recommend thatthe

civilization culminating-as they have in the destruction of a United States battle ship with 260 of its officers andcrew while on a friendly visit in theharbor of Havana and can not longerbe endured as has been set forth bythe president of the United States inhis message to congress of April 111S98 upon which the action of congresswas invited ThereforeResolved First That the people ofthe island of Cuba are and of rightought to be free and independentJ neverthelessAtJ pt LtxL mjmSWSSUNGlE SM Dont be Afraid Little Gal 111 Protect YouSecond That it is the duty of theUnited States to demand and the government of the United States doeshereby demand that the governmentof Spain at once relinquish its authority and government in the island ofCuba and withdraw its land and navalforces from Cuba and Cuban watersThird That the president of theUnited States be and hereby is directedand erapowared to use the entire landand naval forces of the United Statesand call into the actual service of theUnited States the militia of the several states to such extent as may benecessaiw to carry these resolutionsinto effectThe house was in a furore of excitement during the preliminary business No attention was paid to itThe members crowded about Mr Adams acting chairman of the foreignaffairs committee who brought overthe printed copy of the senate resolutions and read them aloud to half ahundred members in the main aislesThe democratic members of thehouse foreign affairs committee haverefused to join with the republicans onthe resolutions drafted by them and itis stated will report minority resolutions calling for immediate recognitionof the present Cuban republicThe report of the senate committeeon foreign relations en the Cuban situation was made by Senator Davis-chairman of that committee and wasa very thorough review of the entiresituation and a strong presentation of the facts which liasled the committee to its conclusions The report takes up theMaine disaster as the leading topic forconsideration and plunges into thatquestion in its first sentence which iSias follows The destruction of theUnited States battle ship Maine of twoof her officers and of 264 of her crewin the harbor of Havana on the nightof February 15 1S9S excited to an unprecedented degree the compassionand resentment of the American peopleContinuing the report says Manifestations of that resentment weresuspended although the feeling wasnot allayedv by the self restraint ofour people who determined to holdtheir judgment in suspense concerningtheir ultimate actiou until an officialinvestigation should disclose the causeof that great disaster and enable themby direct or circumstantial testimonyto impute the responsibility thereforThat investigation had been madeIt was conducted with judicial thoroughness and deliberation The difficulty of demonstrating by conclusiveproof the efficient personal cause ofthat sinister event was the usual oneof exposing plotted and mysteriouscrimes No such difficulty Howeverobscures its official and responsiblecauseThe committee say that the explosion itself of the Maine was dinkedwith a series of precedent transactions which can not in reason be disdisconnected from itWith animus by Spain so plainlyapparent that no one can even plausibly deny its existence but one reasonfor the conclusion of the investigatingmind must come in considering- the entire subject of the relations of theUnited States with that governmentIt is the opinion of your committeethat the destruction of the Maine wascompassed either by the official act ofthe Spanish authorities or was madepossible by a negligence on their partso willing and gross as to be equivalent in culpability to positive criminalactionWhen property and life are destroyed by an act which the exerciseof due diligence by the person whoseduty it is to use it could have prevented the happening of such an eventis sufficient proof that that diligencewas not employedThe time of the explosions saysthe report must have been calculated for the moment when the Maineshould swing- within the destructiveradius of the mineConcluding this portion of its presentation the committee says Theduplicity perfidy and cruelty of theSpanish character as they alwayshave been demonstrated still to continue by their manifestations duringthe present war in Cuba All thesecircumstances considered cumulatively warrant the conclusion that the destruction of the Maine was compassedeither by the official act of the Spanishauthorities and the ascertainment ofthe particular persons is not materialor was made possible by a negligenceon their part so willing and gross as tobe equivalent in culpability to positivecriminal actionSenator Turpie presented the

bySPRING FANCIESAgainst the gray of wintry skyThe trees outline their perfect graceAlong the branches lifted highThe slender twigs methinks do traceQuaint characters whose mysteryThe Dryad alphabet might beAh if the key were only mineSo I might read whats written thereIs it the tale of maid divineImprisoned Daphne young and fairAll conscious of the coming springBy inward throb and quiveringOr is It but the written songMurmured so softly to the treesThrough all the summer borne alongOn every tender balmy breezeThe lullaby for birds at restRocking all safely in the nestIt is a message for the springTo bid her hasten back againHer every influence sweet to bringThe warmer sun the gentler rainThe softer breeze that bears alongEach early birds sweet wooing songSo pleasant fancies come and goIf skies be bright or skies be grayI cannot gaze so long I knowToward heaven when brighter is the dayWhen leaves shall come theyll hide frommeThe slender twigs weird traceryIsidor D French in Boston TranscriptCRIME FROM ABUSINESS STANDPOINTmUBy George AdeTOES any criminal ever makeaJl success of his businessThis question was asked of InspectorJohn D Shea a few days agoWhat do you mean by successWell does he make a great deal ofmoney and escape imprisonmentThat depends on whether he callshimself an out-and-out crook or merelyoperates as a highly moral businessman replied the inspector with asmile Among the so called professional criminals there are a great manywho get hold of large sums of moneyat times and from the money standpoint you might say they were fairlysuccessful but iu nearly every instancelhey are finally landed in some penitentiaryDo you know of any professionalcriminal who escaped punishment altogether mYes I know of one and he is theonly one I can recall at this momentHe lives on the West side This fellowhas been a burglar and all round crooicfor jears and we are well satisfiedthat he has done a good many jobsbut we have never been able to get himHe has been wonderfully lucky Onenight he was brought into the Desplaines street station with a dark lantern a putty knife and some othertools of the trade on his person Thatis as near as we ever came to nabbinghim in the act ne had been caughtin an alley If he had been an oldtimer we might have got him out ofthe way for awhile on such proof butas he had never been convicted beforewe couldnt do anything This fellowhas had u great many partners andevery one of them has been caughtJMost of them are doing time now buthe has had remarkable luck Hell beiscnt over some day thoughWhen a man starts out to b a professional criminal how does he usuallybetray himself to the police Does hebecome overconfident after one or twosuccessful jobsYes he is apt to take chances if hehas got away with two or three jobsHe begins to think that he is toosmooth for the police Usually how-ever he first comes under suspicion brbeing seen in company with crookswho are well known to the policeCriminals naturally flock together andmake friends with one another Thecommon danger and the common interest help to make them intimate It isnatural for them to work in gangs andpairs and a fellow who starts out onins own hook is almost sure to landin a gang very soon and as soon as hedoes he comes under the notice of theoiicpThere are some perhaps who haveproverbial bad luckYes there are plenty who get out of- one penitentiary just in time to breakinto another Criminals as a class arepoorty paid if you count in the timethat they serve Leaving the wrongand right entirely out of the questionits a bad business proposition Justas an instance A few years ago anexpert bank sneak named Murphy wasleu out of Joliet and the next weekhe showed up here in Chicago Oneof the detectives met him and broughthim to the central station I asked himwhat he was doing and he said hewas looking for work and was going tolead an honest life He swore by allthat was good and holy that he wouldTiever steal another dollar as long as helived 1 didnt want to doubt the manbut I told him that if he wanted to bestraight hed better get out of Chicagoand awa3r from his old pals and settledown in some quiet place where thepolice wouldnt be watching him all thetime He thought well of my suggestion and left town About a week af terthat we got word that a couple of fellcws had been caught doAvn in Ohiotrying to do a job in a country bankThe police in Ohio couldnt identifythese fellows so Andy Rohan wentdown to take a look at them Of courseAndy knows more crooks by sight thananr other man in the department Theminute he saw these fellows he recognized one of them as Murphy Beinga good professional Murphy was putaway for a few years in OhioOne night I was turning theat Halsted and Madison streets andsaw a man and woman -crossing thestreet I got just a glimpse of the manimt I knew that I had seen him someTHE BOURBON NEWS PAMS KT FEIDAY APEIL 15 1898where before but couldnt place himWhen I had walked about 100 feet orso from the corner I heard some oneyelling behind me and saw people running toward a tailor ship I hurriedback and pushed into the shop andthere standing in the middle of thefloor with a crowd around him wasMurphy He was the fellow I had seenwith the woman As soon as I got afair peep at his face I knew him Iwent up to him and says Whats thematter Murphy He says I dontkaow but I guess Im crazy Thetailor told me that he had caught himtrying to get away with a bolt of clothThe woman had acted as a stall for himHe had got the bolt of cloth under hisovercoat and started down the streetwith it when it fell out The tailor sawit and ran after him and caught himI says to Murphy You have gotdown to stealing a bolt of cloth haveyou Well sir he was all broken upIt humiliated him to think that a manof his standing in the profession shouldbe caught doing such cheap work Itseemed that he had just got out of theOhio penitentiary a few days beforeand landed in Chicago He ran out ofmoney and decided to do any kind of asmall job that would give him a grubstake as he called it He got the woman to help him and didnt think therewas a chance on earth for him to failAs it was he was caught as easily as ifhe had been an amateur It settled himfor another term too just as surely a3if he had stolen 10000Many people of humane sentimentsand a general ignorance of criminalshave protested against the police keeping watch over ex convicts and all menwho have been photographed for therogues galleryIt is true that certain criminals aretaken into custody on sight whetheranv definite charge can be lodgedagainst them or not They are broughtin and questioned and sometimesthey are advised to leave town or elsethreatened with a bridewell sentenceon a charge of vagrancyThe claim is made that sometimesthe criminals and ex convicts are soharried and persecuted b3r the policethat they cannot reform The police interference prevents them from securing employment and so long as theyare regarded as criminals and treatedas criminals they might as well be criminals in fact and enjoy some of the rewards of crimeThere is another side to this slorv ofcourse If the police worked on the assumption that every man returningfrom Joliet had a sincere desire to reform and lead an honest life and therefore was not to be kept under surveillance there is no doubt that criminalswould flock to Chicago and operatemore boldly than at present It is afact that those cities in which the police have arbitrary power and exert iswith severity on all recorded criminalsarc the cities which the crooks give awide berth and in which life and property are much better protected thanthey would be otherwiseWhen it became a matter ofgeneralknbwledge that anv known crook inPittsburgh would be put to work onthe stone pile without legal fuss or ceremony the moral tone of the community moved up several notches InBROUGHT IN AND QUESTIONEDthe eyes cf the police the end justifiesthe means and an experienced officerand thief catcher such as InspectorShea has very little sympathy with sentimental theoriesIf a man really attempts to eformwill he be able to do it Wili the policepersecute him and call up his past andprevent his earning an honest livelihood The police say not Itisclaimedthat many reformed crooks are livingquietly in Chicago without any botherfrom the police Some of them have deodorized their records and gone intopolitics with great successWhen Maj McClaugbry came to Chicago to be chief of police under Hempstead Washburuo he visited every station in Chicago and met face to faceevery officer in the entire department While on his rounds he foundtwo policemen whom he had known asconvicts in Joliet penitentiary when hewas warden there He recognizee themas they stood in line and of courseihey recognized him Both men cameto the chiefs office to plead with himThey expected to be let off the forcebut the chief assured each man that hemight remain in the department on hismerits as an officer and the fact that hehad been a convict would not countagainst him in the leasr He also proinised to keep the secret Both men hadmade good policemen and had liveddown their early misfortunes Chicago Record3Ir Goslinjjton on Self ControlThe longer I live said Mr Goslington the more firmly I am convincedthat the greatest of all victories forman to attain is the victory of

Extinction ofNative AmericansSurely a Frenchman ought to be recognized as an authority on the questionof a declining birth rate France isthe one nation Avhere the birth rate hassleadily decreased until at last thedeaths outnumber the births Since1800 there has been an annual loss ofsomething like 20000 population inFrance It is a Frenchman of scienceArsene Dumont avIio predicts the destruction of the American people Inthe Journal of the Paris Statistical Society he reports the result of his studyof the vital statistics of MassachusettsIn spite of the efforts made in NewYork and other states it is an exasperating fact that Massachusetts alone collects trustAvorthy and comprehensiveA ital statistics and it is on these thatforeign statisticians rely for information as to the tendencies of Americanlife Yet Massachusetts is hardly representative She has an uncommon proportion of foreign born people andthey are more absorbed in the manufactures than the people of other statesThe proportion of the two sexes in thatsiflto is unlike the proportion of thewest and soutli and many importantconditions are peculiarMr Dumonts study of the birth ratein Massachusetts is not encouraging asto the future of Americans He saysthat marriages among Americanborn reveal a steady diminution ofthe birth rate The cause of this hefinds in the principle of democracyThis develops individualism the desireof each person to live his own life forhimself to obtain all the pleasure thereis in life Avhether intellectual or material He maintains that as they do notpropose to miss the chances of personal development Americans or any rcpublican people will not burden themselves with children He says there is apoison in republican civilization andthe more intense republicanism becomes the more acute individualism isEventually he asserts this must destroy the race and its culture He saysrepublics might escape this fate if theyAvould submit to the rule of sciencePerhaps it is this determination notto sacrifice nny of the pleasures of lifefor the pleasure of children that is thecause of the decline of the birth ratein France It is more reasonable thanthe explanation commonly given thatin the absence of a laAv of entail Frenchparents are led to limit the number otheir children The code Napoleon doesnot allow a man to leave the bulk of hisfortune to his oldest child as in England It is hardlj reasonable to thinkthat in order to bestow an estate on asingle child a man would denv himselfthe pleasure of rearing a number of children But in order to find a largeramount of liberty and pleasure for himself he might be AAilling to go childlessIt is strange that a French scientistshould dAell on the declining birthrate -of Massachusetts and make no reference to that of his OAvn country Atthe beginning Gf the century there werebirths for each 1000 of population inFrance In 1S50 it had declined to 27and in 1893 to 22 At the same time thebirth rate of Germany and Austria

WORLDIMPROVING QUALITYWhy Farm Butter Should Be Mailewltli the Same Care as the BestCreamery ProductOne of the problems of particular importance to the dairy interests is that ofimproung the quality of butter madeon a great many farms Large quantities are made in this way and a greatportion of it is of quite inferior qualityIt is not- remunerative to those whoproduce it says the Indiana Farmerand it adversely affects the generalmarket for good butter because it istransformed into ladles and processbutter which enter into competitioni1h gemiine butter with much thesame results as follow oleomargarinecompetition A good deal of the butterthat is made might just as well fromthe standpoint of the maker of the industry and of the consumer not bemade at all since it does not pay any ofthem If this butter could be improvedin quality it would add largely to thetalue of the daily product oi the country and would help its makers to earn aliving Perhaps the most serious obstacle to improving the lower g rade ofdairy butter is the fact that the butterin rural districts that is made on thefarm is so largely sold at groceries andgeneral stores The buyer is principally engaged in selling goods Ilejmust hold his trade and he purchasesfarm butter as a mere incident to hisbusiness He does not and dare notconduct this branch of it on its meritsHe is glad enough to buy good farmbutter if it comes to the store and hewill set it aside for his own use or forThe use of good customers but whenthe maker of poor butter brings in abatch he is afraid to refuse it or topay less for it than he did for the goodbutter He knows that he would losethe trade of the maker if he did Onefarmers wife will make good butterbut what inducement has she to try todo still better when her neighbor whosnakes poor butter gets as much apound for it as she does or whatmolivehas the maker of the poor butter tomake it better when she gets just asmuch for it as is paid for the betterbutter made in the neighborhoodHuman nature is so constituted thatthe doctrine of rewards and punishment cuts a large figure with it On-the average it does not take extratrouble and pains unless it sees corresponding rewards for doing so Thequality of a large mass of farm butter-would be very much improved if some-way could be devised whereby everypound that is made were sold upon itsactual merits the good butter

stripalongside he put on a top dressing oflime and on still another a broacl bandof phosphate was used This rotationwas kept up right along until he hadcovered five acres The result was veryfavorable

followed this plan fora good many years he is- sure that hemakes more money than by keepingstock and still keeps up the fertility ofhis soilA number of years ago 1 used to mixashes with hen manure for corn but alittle reflection taught me that this waspoor policy There is no doubt that thetwo will not mix without loss Thechemical union weakens the strengthof the combination E L Vincent inNational
