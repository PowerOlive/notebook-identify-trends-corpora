"As I understand it," said a geitle

SURPRISING CURE OF STOMACH
TROUBLE.
When you have trouble with your
stomach or chronic constipation, don't
imagine that your case is beyond help
just because your doctor fails to give
you relief. Mrs. G. Stengel, Plainfield,
N. J., writes: "For over a month past
I have been troubled with my stomach.
Everything I ate upset it terribly.
One of Chamberlain's advertising
booklets came to me. After reading
a few of the letters from people who
had been cured by Chamberlain's Tab
lets, I decided to try them. I have
taken nearly three-fourths of a pack
age of them and can now eat almost
I everything that I want."x For sale by

Courtesy Is Love of Man.
Courtesy. This is love in society,
love in relation to etiquette. "Love
doth not behave itself unseemly." Po
liteness has been defined as love in
trifles. Courtesy is said to be love in
little things. And the one secret of
politeness is to love. Love cannot
behave itself unseemly. Henry Drum-mond.

Eczema Ointment, on the sores and
the suffering stops instantly. Healing

a gentleman named Oliver Cromwell,
who by occupation is described as a

FOR CUTS, BURNS AND BRUISES.
In every home there should be a box
of Bucklen's Arnica Saive, ready to
apply in every case of burns, cuts,

could be cured." The world's best

Warm Enough?
While coaching a class of children
for a little play, the teacher told the
boys that in the third act they would
have to wear their heavy overcoats,
as that would be the snow scene. Af
ter a short silence a little fellow about
seven years old raised his hand and
said: "Teacher, father can't finish
my overcoat in time because he works
late; but will it be all right if I wear
my heavy underwear?"
By vote of five to two in the Coun
cil last night a permit to construct an
iron clad building- to be used as a
tobacco ware house to cost approxi
mately 30,000, was voted down.
At the last meeting of the CouncjJ, a
new company in the process of organi
zaion, presented a petition to the Coun
cil for a permit to construct the build
ing, but owing to a serious objection
being raised by a number of the adjoin
ing propery owners, the matter was re
ferred to the Improvement Committee
of the Council to report at the meet
ing last night. The report of the Com
mittee being filed a Vote was taken,
with the above result.
The new company had planned to
erect a fire-proof building on a site
selected in Barns Addition and in the
vicinity of the property of the Bour
bon Tobacco Ware house Company.
Options on several pieces of property
had been secured but further action
was deferred until the Council could
act upon the permit.
The firm of E. F. Spears & Sons
which recently suffered the loss of its
mammoth grass seed cleaning plant,
applied to the Council for a permit
to construct upon the site of the old
building a modern structure of con
crete and steel. It was stated by the
petitioners that the machinery used
in cleaning grass seed would be equip
ped with the latest improved dust
collectors, which it is said will dis
pense with one of the greatest ob
jections to the plant in its present
location. To the granting of a permit
an objection was filed by a number of
the residents but when put to a vote
it carried.
A right of way along the route of
the new sewer system, plans for
meeting of the Council, have been
secured from the private citizens
along the route and all that now re
mains to insure an early beginning
upon the improvement is the permis
sion of the Louisville & Nashville
railroad to extend the service through
its property.
Permission had been asked from
the head officials of the company in
Louisville, and the matter was referr
ed to Superintendent W. H. Anderson,
who has been empowered to use his
judgment in granting the city the
right. It was reported at the meeting
that Mr. Anderson would be ready
within the next few days to file the
conditions of the permit with the May
or and Improvement Committee of the
Council. Civil engineers will go over
the property before final action will be
taken by the officials of the railroad
company, bu it is probable the request
of the Council will be granted with
out any delay.
Where the Calculator Scores.
The best tradition requires that
whenever a lightning calculator tells
how many seconds there were in the
life of Methuselah some one must
shout: "Wrong! You've muffed it
this time. I've figured the whole thing
out,- and here are the figures."
Whereupon the lightning calculator re
ceives an armful of papers, glances
at the first few sheets, looks up, grin
ning and chuckles: "Just as I thought.
You've forgotten the leap years."
London's Primitiv Water Pipet.
London's water supply formerly
came through wooden pipes. These
were of the simplest construction,
formed of the stems of small elm
trees, drilled through the center and
cut in lengths of about six feet, one
end being tapered so as to fit into
the adjoining pipe. The wooden pipes,
of which at one time more than 400
miles were in use, leaked consider
ably, decayed rapidly, burst during
frosts and were always troublesome.
It was not until 1830 that they began
to be superseded by cast iron, and a
quarter of a century later some of the
old wooden pipes were still in use.
