L. 5 N. Planning Extensive Uss
v of its Lines.
That the Louisville & Nashville
railroad is planning to make extensive
use of its lines operating in South
western part of the State, which pene
trating hitherto unopened terri
tory, will yield unlimited results, by
constructing an extension from this
city to intersect the recently acquired
Lexington & Eastern, is evidenced by
the movements of a corps of civil engi
ners now engaged in surveying a route
for this most logical purpose and at
this time operating only a few miles
from this city.
While such conclusions are drawn
frcm the recent movements of the
company nothing official has been
given out that would tend to confirm
any rumors that may be afloat in re
gard to supposed purpese, but logical
reasons coupled with the indications at
the present time leaves the impression
that the company is planning an exten
sion, which will extend through the
Southeastern part of Bourbon county
opening up a territory where railroao
facilities have been long sought, and
it will be of untold benefit to Paris.
The question of establishing a line
to North Middletown, this county, has
long been agitated, but nothing has
ever come of all the movements ihat
have been launched with this as an
object. However, if the present sup
position develops into a reality, North
Middletown will bu ton the line. The
purpose of the new road, it is said, is
to penetrate the coal fields in Morgan
county that are undeveloped and also to
provide an easy outlet for the immense
traffic that will come from the L. & E.
extension the construction of which is
now under way.
rihree corps of surveyors are in the
field, mapping out the hew line, one
station at the half way hcuse, five
miles from Paris, another operating
near North Middktown and the third
is working over the line in Clark coun
ty. The survey, which start? d from this
city, began at whi.t is known as the
second car bridge, just "North of town
on the fai.m of Mr. B. B. fviarsh, run
ning through this land and paralleling
Stoner creek on the North side to a
corner of the base ball park then to
the Maysville pike crossing in East
Paris, passing tnrough the property
of Mr. James Whaley and from there
through the properties of Mr. Chas.
Barnett, Mrs. Sallie McMillan, Mrs.
Sue Moran, Mr. J. T. Hinton, Mr. (i.
W'. Wyatt, through the Trundle farm
and the place of Mr. Walter Kenney.
Frcm the present survey it will Le
seen that the proposed line follows
closely along Stoner creek and at the
bend neart he farm of Walter Kenney
it will likely cress t .e s ream and po
through the lards cf J. M. Dotsge . n i
W. L. Yerkes leaving the pike tt Jhis
point and again f jIIow Stoner Creek
until a point near North Middletown
in the vicinity of the farm of E. K.
Thomas. The roadbed will follow ihe
level valley along Sfeuner creek, which
will dispense with a necessarialy large
amount of grading. -
Leaving North Middletown the pro
posed road will run in a Southeasterly
airection and will c;o s the C. & O.
railroad at Hedgts Station in Clatk
count and will continue in the same
j directiun until Indian iuelds, a small
station on the L. & Jbi., is reached.
At this point, it is said the new road
will run parallel to the L. & E. into
Montgomery and Menifee counties and
terminating at West Liberty, the coun
ty seat of Morgan county.
While the survey extending into
Morgan county from Indian Fields
will in all probability be a further ex
tension of the proposed line, it is stac
ed the original intention wes ta tap
the L. & E. at ttis point to afford an
easy outlet 10- traffic ccming off of
that road from t-ie new exterisior,
which extends into Letcher county.
Sirce acquiring the L. & E. the L.
& N. has greatly improved the rccd,
rebuilding the old roadbed and extent. -ing
the line which terminated at Jack
son, through Brpathitt ar.d Perry
counties and into Letcher, where it
will find a terminus at Whitesburg
The extension of the L. & E. wi 1
have the effect of opening up a section
of mountain country, rich with coal
and without railroao facilities.
The people of North Middle .own "a:e
very enthuisastic over the movement
and no doubt-the right of way through
this county can be secured without the
least trouble. It is likely the ci.izens
of this neighborhood will hold a meet
ing in the near future to discuss tne
proposed right of way wanted by the
road, and come to some understandi g
regarding, the value of their lands tnd
the concessions jJesired by the com
pany.
Not only would the road grately en
hance the value of the Jands lying
along the right of way but would boom
the- thriving little village cf North
Middletown, and the extent of the
sbenefits Paris would , dei ive from the
project could not be estimated.
Freight and passenger service would
be handled by running the trains to
the starting point on the Marsh farm
and backing into the freight ar.d
passenger depots. The reason a direct
line would not be run into this city
would be on account of heavy grades
to be encountered and necessay curves
hat would necessitate an immense
expenditue of money.
The citizens of Paris should look far
enough ahead and readily seeing the
benefits this city would derive should
show a disposition to encourage the
movement. It will mean much to this
city, not only in the increase in tiaffic,
but it will bring hundreds of people
here Fn the course of a few yeais. li
meanR that Paris will be made the L.
& E. terminus, and. a distributing
point for all points on the division,
and in the course or timemay result
in the removal of the shops now locat
ed in Covington to Paris.
The City Council should take proper
steps. to encourage the L. & N. and
offer every inducement by granting
whatever concessions the road may
bsK .Interest in this important matter
should not be allowed to wane and a
little push and energy on the part of
the citizens would further the causa
that will be of untold benefit 'o Paris
and Bourbon county.
Several surveys tf the proposed
loute will be made and the most
feasible accepted provided the nht of
way can he securtd. At any rate it is
an assured fact that North Middle
town, which has been after ta rahroad
of some description for almost half a
century will be on or near the Tne,
and the people of this nieghbor! ood
are much elated over the prospsct?.
The road, extending through Clark
and Bourbon counties can be construct
ed at a very small expense compara
tively speaking, as very little grading
will be necessary and no bridges of
any importacne will be required.
The contsruction of a line from this
city would mean that all traffic coming
from the L. & E., east ot Indian
Fields, would pass through Paris, and
this, is prboably the principal reason
for thp prepestd establishment of the
new line. This is due to the fact that
immense traffic coming off of the road
could be handled more easily than 'by
detouring freight either to Winchester
or Lexington and then to Paris, which
is destined to be a distributing point
for the North and South.
Heavy grades exist on the L. & N.
between Winchester and Pais and on
the L. & Hi. dewteen Indian Fields and
Winchester. To handle with ease the
volume of traffic the road is expecting
to handle would make it necessary to
redcue the grade, which could only be
done at an enormous expense, and com
pared with the expense of building a
new road which would necessarily open
up new territory, the latter would be '
more practicable. I
a While both Winchester and Lexing-'
ton are making an effort tosecuro the
terminus of the L. & E. on the face of .
the existing conditions it looks as if'
Paris has the'best chance even in the
fact of the strong inducements offered
by the sister cities. The double track-!
ing ot the L. & N. from Covington
onlyjjextends to this city, which leads '
to the Delief the original intention of
the company was to make Paris the
terminus and a distributing point.

"BEVERLY."
Fashicn is a funny thin? and the
way in which styks are oiiginated,
especailly in articles of feminine at
tire, sometimes occur in a very unique
way. Although Geo. Barr McCutih
eon's "Beverly" has been published
for several years and although there
appeared on the cover of the book
"iciiijuii jl unci a uuijcepuuu ui. LUt!
Hoiric!nn h in Hi-i'r stn n-:n C iL. . .
ideal Jbeverly" garbed in a most
ravishing hat and veil, it was not until
the novel was dramatized and put on
the stage last psring that the "Bever
ly Hat became one
of fashion's
crazes. Now in every city of the
country where "Bevrely" has appear
ed the women have gonp crazy over
!he beauties of the Beverly hat and it
is being copied far and wide.
"Beverly" will be seen at the Grand
on next Tuesday, October 24. Watch
for the big advertisement in next issue

Lays New Pipes.
The Harrodbsurg Herald says: "Mr.
R. L. Whaley, of Paris, has been here
several days laying new pipes from
the Standard Oil supply tank to the
side track at the depot. The pipes in
use had been almost destroyed by rust
and in consequence the company wes
suffreing a loss of 20 gallons of oil a
day."
Grade Crossing to be Abolished.
The L. & N. Railroad Company,
through their agent, Mr. J. H. Hag
gard, has closed a deal with Mr. Os
sian Edwards, whereby the company
becomea the owner of the vacant lot
at the corner of Foruteanth and Main
streets. The price paid was $1,200.
.This ground was purchased in order
to abolish the dangerous grade cross
ing on Fourteenth street going into
Claysville. A tunnel will be built
under the company's tracks at this
point snd traffic over the rairload's
right cf way at this point will be step
ped. Ihe pruchase of the Edwards lot was
made for the prupese of allowing a
passway to the Standard Oil Com
pany's plant, which is located on the
L. & N. right of way.and which other
wise would be left on too high a point
to ptrmit "them using Fourteenth
street.
Work on the concrete buildings at
the Standard Oil Company's plant was
started last week.
