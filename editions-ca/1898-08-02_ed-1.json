ROSARY BEADS
They Were In Use Am one the Hindoos
Before the Era of Buddha
The prevailing idea in regard to a
rosary is that it belongs solely to follow- I
ers of the Catholic religion But take
away the cross that is hanging to the
beads and we find that one must turn to
the dim mysterious east for tho origin
of the rosary for it is among the tem
ples of India China and Japan that the
first sign of the practice is to be found
Ancient pictures of the Hindoo gods de
pict them with chaplets of beads in
their hands and it is believed that this
method of keeping count of their rnauy
prayers was in use among the Hindoos
before the era of Buddha or at least B
C 500
The use of the rosary seems especial
ly suited to an eastern clime aud to the
repose of an oriental mind The Bud
dhists are fond of using very smooth
beads of glass polished jade or coral
and it has been thought that the smooth
cool beads gliding through their fingers
as they murmur the holy name for thou
sands of times help them to arrive at
that state of holy abstraction from
earthly things which is so much prized
among the followers of Buddha
The favorite Japanese rosaries are
made of polished wood crystal onyx
and chased silver and the Japanese
Buddhists repeat in endless devotion
Namu Amida Butzu Save us
Buddha while their Chinese brothers
have the blessed name O-Mi-to-fu
forever on their lips A rosary of very
great size was recently brought from a
temple in Kioto Japan The largest
bead is about six inches in diameter and
the rosary entire is about 24 feet long
The huge beads are of dark brown pol
ished wood They are hollow and have
each a figure of a god inside the little
shrine which can be seen through a
lattice of brass work Cincinnati En

FALSIFIED HER AGE
A Court Trial That Disclosed a Queer
Phase of Russian Society
Even in Russia it seems despotism
does not go the length of forcing a
woman to tell her age or of punishing
her for stating it inaccurately A cer
tain Princess Eugalytcheff was recently
tried at Moscow and sentenced to life
long internment in the province of Olo
netzfor embezzling 140000 rubles
After the proceeding in court had come
to an end and after the noble lady had
retired to the country for her somewhat
prolonged rest from urban gayeties and
temptations a too careful official discov
ered that among the papers in the case
was the princess certificate of baptism
and that she had changed the date of it
from 1847 to 1867 Instantly this grave
crime was brought to the notice of the
authorities and the convicted embezzler
was summoned to meet the charge of
falsifying an official document Then a
curious fact was disclosed and a
prising amount of light was thrown on
Russian society
The Prince Eugalytcheff who was
cited aso a witness by the prosecutor
said that whether his bride was 20 years
older or younger than her certified age
was a matter of absolute indifference to
him All he could say was that he re
ceived the sum of 3 000 rubles for giv
ing the lady his name that immediate-
ly after the marriage ceremony he nro
A TRYING NAVAL JOB
WHAT IT MEANS TO PUT A WARSHIP
IN COMMISSION
Tho Enormous Amount of Work That Must
Be Performed and the Ceremonies That
Are Observed Before the Pennant and
the Stars and Stripes Are Hoisted
In times of peace as well as when
wars dark clouds gloom the nation you
are liable to read in the newspapers an
announcement to the effect that one of
the vessels of the navy is
going
into
commission It is not a very impress
ive phrase but the full meaning of the
term is something of which few have
any adequate conception To put a mod
ern warship into commission involves
an enormous amount of work which
can be fully appreciated only by one
who has observed the process from be
ginning to end
When a vessel of the navyJs laid up
in reserve in ordinary as it is call
ed it is far from an attractive object
and could hardly be recognized as the
same ship when in thorough trim with
crew aboard The ship is anchored at a
convenient navy yard the stores are
sent ashore her engines and guns cov
ered with oil and an antirust paint
her decks are allowed to become dirty
her sides dull and stained from rusty
chains Thus she lies perhaps for
months and then an order comes from
the secretary of the navy through the
chief of the bureau of navigation di
recting the commanding officer of the
yard to get her ready for sea
The first thing to be done is to bring
as many men as possible from the re
ceiving ship which lies hard by and
these with the force of the yard under
the direction of whatever officers are
available begin at once to put things to
rights and remove the accumulated dust
and dirt from the different parts of the
equipment the engineers force goes at
once to the engines and boiler rooms
the anitrust paint is removed from the
engines new packing is put in the
valves and joints the pumps are tested
the rust and dirt knocked from interiors
of fire boxes and boiler tubes and grate
bars renewed
Outwardly everything is now in fair
condition but this is only the begin
ning It remains to get up steam in
some of the boilers turn over the en
gines to see if they are in proper trim
start the dynamos test the electric
lights and the pilothouse signals turn
on the searchlights start the fans work
the steering gear and steering engines
set the hoisting machinery in motion
and put the boat cranes in operation
Every engine boiler pipe wire tube
rivet bolt nut and plate is carefully
inspected and if found unserviceable
from any cause repaired
Next the equipment storehouse is vis
ited and a full allowance of beef pork
beans potatoes coffee sugar salt flour
meal clothing shoes hammocks blan
kets paint tobacco in short the whole
miscellaneous assortment of thecom
missary department is placed on board
The paymaster of the ship is responsi
ble for every article received aud a
strict account is kept of each Then the
galley or cooking stove has to be ex
amined to see whether it is complete in
all its findings The outfit of a galley
usually consists of two copper kettles of
cured for her a separate passport and I 30 gallons each a 50 gallon kettle with
that since then he has known nothing cast iron jacket and copper hinged cov
more of his wife or her private affairs ers two steamers for vegetables each
The jury gallantly declined to convict
the accused princess on the trivial
charge about a womans age and she
was sent back to her provincial exile
Princes evidently come cheap in
Russia and this is perhaps the most in
teresting bit of news in the whole story

A Disastrous Ending
Two Detroit merchants were sitting
on adjacent stools and taking a 15 cent
lunch when one asked the other if he
consulted his wife in his business affaira
Cant do it was the response
Ive tried it a dozen times a month for
years but it always winds up just
about as it did yesterday I asked her
if she thought she could discuss a little
matter of business calmly and dispas
sionately She said she could but had
never known me to be able to do so I
complimented her sarcastically on her
angelic temper and she at once ac
cused me of being angry I told her
that I was regarded among men as hav
ing a very equable disposition and that
my employees called me Old Suavity
She called attention to the fact that
her pet dog that weighs about a pound
was called Danger Then I told her
straight from the shoulder that I de
clined to be made angry by her taunts
and odious comparisons but served
pointed notice that I was going to have
the -respect due the head of the house
She laughed cheerily and declared that
I was entirely too touchy
But what about the business confer
ence
OhI slammed the door and left

Ice Broke the Spell
There is a curious little- tale about
Captain Bagot M P for South West
moreland which cannot fail to interest
those superstitiously inclined It is said
that some generations ago a witch
cursed Levens Hall the seat of Captain
Bagot and said that there would bo no
direct male heir to the estate as long as
the Kent the river which runs through
the grounds flowed Such has indeed
been the case until in 1895 when
owing to the severe frost the Kent was
for a time entirely frozen up and a few
months afterward Mrs Bagot presented
her husband with a little boy London

Boston Traveler
with a capacity of 32 gallons two sets
of saucepans a fine set of tools for lift
ing and firing and the ordinary cooking
implements
The line officers look after the condi
tion of the guns the rigging the boats
the cables the anchors the flags and
signals the charts the nautical instru
ments and other parts of the ships
equipment What this means can only
be appreciated by one who has actually
undertaken the task A volume might
be written in regard to the signals alone
When all this work has been done
the ship is ready to go into commission
and up to this time everything has been
under control of the commandant of the
yard so that when the captain of the
ship arrives and reports himself to the
yard commander little remains for him
to attend to In the meantime men have
been brought together to constitute the
crew
Sometimes they are enlisted particu
larly for the ship which is about to go
into service at other times they are
withdrawn from other ships which have
just been put out of commission The
crew and marines report aboard with
bags and hammocks the captain orders
the crew to be drawn up on the spar
deck promptly at noon upon the day on
which the ship is to be put formally in
commission reads to them his orders
from the secretary of the navy detailing
him to the command hoists the com
mission pennant to the main truck and
the stars and stripes to the gaff or staff
at the stern and all is ready
The ship is now in commission San

Greek and Latin
M Jules Lemaitre condemned the
study of Greek and Latin the other day
at the Paris Sorbonne He declared that
the national mind had been formed not
by the literature of the Greeks and Ro
mans except in an indirect way but by
the Scriptures first and afterward by the
great French writers M Lemaitre
further declared that he regretted hav
ing studied Greek and Latin 12 years
whereas he is ignorant of English which
is spoken by half the world and only
knows German in a pitiful manner
