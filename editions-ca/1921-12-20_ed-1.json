CECIL B. DeMILLE'S PRODUCTION
"FORBIDDEN FRUIT"
By Jeanie Macphcrson-Av Paramount Picture
A vividly intimate revelation of love and maniedife. Baring a wife's strLpgle between duty to a rascally husband and
the call of her heart to a man who was worthy. Staged by a great company, with settings and gowns more gorgeous than
anything else DeMille has brought to the screen. A drama waim with the flash and blood of living men and womenr dressed in
"all the glowing color and luxury that DeMille can weave like a cloth of gold with one of the greatest casts ever assembled.

The most lavishly beautiful production ever screened. J3y all odds the best DeMille production made in a long time.

TODAY AND
THE GOOD OLD DAYS
Thirty years ago this morning,
Dad poked an unwilling foot out of
bed. Back it came with a jerk.
Then, with an effort, he plunged
into the chilly atmosphere.
With numb fingers he searched
for a match. It sputtered out. Again
he -tried and this time he got the
lamp lighted.
Shivering, he pattered down to the
kitchen and fixed up the fire in the
range. Then while Mother fried the
eggs, Dad struggled through his
shave with lukewarm water. A slice
out of his chin was charged to the
unsteady flame of the lamp.
Breakfast over, he started out on
his frigid hike to work.
And then we talk of the good old
days!
Most of the comforts that make
life easier to live nowadays are sup
plied by those big common servants
the Public Utilities. The light
that shines at a touch, the street
car that saves chilblains, the gas

telephone that eliminates the miles
of walking, the telegraph that does

DODGING
If you want to raise to the top, of
your business or your line of work,
you must -have the quality of ac
cepting ' responsibility instead of
evading it.
The man with a tendency to
"pass the buck" usually finds that
his ladder of successlfas but one
rung.
Business will Btand for almost
anything from a man who has the
courage to say, "Yes, that's my
fault. But I won't make this mis
take again." -
The man who attempts to place
the blame for his mistakes or short
comings upon other people or upon
existing conditions will never get
very far.
There is no large place in the,
