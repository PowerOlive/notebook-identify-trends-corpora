' Mr. Charles Fritsche, telegraph ed
itor of the Los Angeles, Cali., Times,
who is well-known in Paris as a
newspaper man connected with the
Goebel assassination trials at George
town and Frankfort, has just pub
lished a new love song, entitled
"Serenata Hindustani," which is re
ceiving most favorable comment
from critics and musicians.
The melody is described as the
"Sorrows of Young Werther," Goe
the's celebrated masterpiece of prose
poetry, done into music, and is said
to be full of sensuous warmth and
beauty. The new song will be in
cluded in her program next season
by Mmme Schumann-Heink. Mr!
Fritsche is making a name for her
self as a music composer, and has
published a number of popular melo
dies, including "Ladie Claire." Not
only is Mr. Fritsche an accomplished
imusician and fine all-round fellow,
but he is a first-class newspaper
man, which tops all his many accom
plishments. Buy an Edison!

HAVE YOUR PHONE DUSTED?
A joke-loving Paris man had a big
lot of fun one day last week with a
number of stenographers and busi
ness men in the city in an innocent
way.
Calling up his victims, he would
inform them in a business like way
that he was the representative of one
of the telephone companies. He
would then ask the identity of the
person answering the phone. The
stenographer or whoever answered
was told that the company was get
ting ready to clean their phones by
means of compressed air, and that it
would be necessary for the phones
to be covered up for a short while,
so that the dust that had accumulat
ed on the 'lines and in the instru
ments would not blow all over the
office.
There was much scurrying around,
and one of the victims in her haste
and desperation could find nothing
but a large office towel, with which
she, proceeded to swath the phone un
til it looked like a man getting a hot
towel in a barber chair. Others took
table covers or anything else that
came handy. Calls for their numbers
remained unanswered for fear of the
"spreading dust."
After a time the joker called in
person to see if instructions had been
carried out, and informed the victim
that the work had been completed.
The coverings were removed and
business proceeded as usual. But the
victims of the joker could detect no
difference in the workings of their
phones. The joke, of course, leaked
out, and it would have been an un
happy moment for the practical
joker if he had happened in the
vicinity of those offices a short time
after it became known.

BOURBON FARMING CONDITIONS.
There is a decided improvement in
crop conditions in the county since
the recent rains, followed by hot
sunshine. Corn and tobacco, hemp,
all the small fruits and garden stuff
have felt the revivifying effects of
the showers and are growing so fast
j they can be heard talking about it.
Wheat threshing is the only thing
interfered with by the rains. Some
say the wheat has not been cut quite
long enough yet, and is still going
through the sweating process.
Taken as a whole the gardeners
and farmers are well satisfied with
progress made and prospects for the
future.

MATRIMONIAL.

BROWN BRANNOCK.
A marriage license was issued re
cently from the office of County
Clerk Pearce Paton to Mr. John R.
Brannock and Miss Fannie May
Brown, both of this county.
After securing license Mr. Bran
nock and Miss Brown went to Lex
ington, where they were married at
the residence of the officiating min
ister, Eld. I. J. Spencer, in Lexing
ton, at 2:30 o'clock Thursday after
noon. The bride is a daughter of Mrs.
Kate Brown, of North Middletown,
where she had resided from child
hood. She is an excellent young
woman and will grace the household
of the lucky man, who has won her
affections. Mr., Brannock is a well
known young farmer of the North
Middletown vicinity.
IT PAYS TO ADVERTISE.
A child's ring, set with diamonds
lost in Paris several days ago, and
advertised in THE NEWS was found
and restored to the owner, Mr. Gus
Margolen, a few hours after the pa
per had been on the streets. The
ring was found near Seventh street
by Mr. Dora Scott, of the Paris post
office. Thus it is again forcibly demon
strated that "it pays to advertise."
Mr. Margolen and Mr. Scott are both
convinced of the fact, while there's
a happy child in the Margolen
household rejoicing over the return
of her ring.

FOR OUR
BOYS WHO
TO WAR.
WILL GO
Probably as striking an explana
tion of the wonderful fighting prow
ess of the French soldiers in this
world-war as has come to light is fur
nished in the translation of some
script from the trenches in Fland
ers. The translation is headed "French
Trench Philosophy." At the present
time when there are many anxious
eyes scanning the list in to-day's
NEWS of those who have been se
lected by number to form Bourbon's
first answer to the call to arms, the
translation is very timely bearing as
it does a spirit of philosophy and
matter-of-fact resignation to the ne
cessities of warfare. The translation
is an application of sound common
sense home-made philosophy, calm
and dignified. It reads as follows:
"You have two alternatives
either you are mobilized or you are
not.
If not, you have nothing to worry
about.
If you are, you have two alterna
tives either you are in camp or at
the front. k f ,
If you are in camp, you have
nothing to worry about
If you are at the front, you have
two alternatives either you are in
reserve or you are on the fighting
line. If in reserve, you have noth
ing to worry about.
If you are on the fighting line,
you have two alternatives either
you escape or you don't.
If you don't, you have nothing to
worry about.
If you do, you have two alterna
tives either you get slightly hurt
or you get badly hurt.
If you don't, you have nothing to
worry about.
If you do, you have two alterna
tives either you get slightly hurt
or you get badly hurt.
If slightly, you have nothing to
worry about.
If badly, you have two alternatives
either you recover or you don't.
If you recover, you have nothing to
worry about.
If you!dont' and have followed my
advice clear through, you have done
with worry forever.."

CANDIDATES FOR PROMOTION
Erastus Bowles, Taylor Chandler
and Lloyd Mann, Louisville and
Nashville firemen, residents of Paris,
were summoned to Covington, Mon
day to appear before the Master Me
chanic for examination.
Owing to the probability of many
valuable men among the engineers
being drafted for army service in the
first or second call the Louisville &
Nashville is preparing for an emer
gency by promoting firemen who
have proven competent and trust-
wortny to positions as engineers in
the future, or, in other words, mak
ing them a reserve. Messrs. Bowles,
Chandler and Mann will be included
in this class.

REAR HORN BACKING SIGNAL
Because not a few automobile ac
cidents have occurred while cars
were being backed up, a young wo
man has patented a rear-end horn
designed to prevent such mishaps.
The horn is situated at the back of
the car just beneath the body. The
electric wiring with which it is con
nected extends to the gear shift and
is attached to a brass contact arm
that is fastened in a horizontal posi
tion to the base of the brake lever.
This brass projection is so placed
that when the transmission is thrown
into reverse, the gear lever strikes
it and causes the horn to operate..
By having the tone of the libra enj
tirely different from, that oF signals
now used, the device is made, more
effective. '
