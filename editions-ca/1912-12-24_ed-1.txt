A com-Instead of the regular crossing thecompany proposes tojlconstiuct a concrete arch at Escodida which will besixteen feet wide and twelve feet inheight." In order to provide a propergrade for the railroad tracks it willbe necessary to lower the grade ofthe pika at that point from one to twofeet.In order to get proper headway thepike at Austerlitz will be lowered a distance of three feet and the railroadcompany proposes to construct twoconcrete abuttments with suitabletops about fifteen feet apart. In premittee appointed to investigate tnechanges in the pike near the Kingfarra was instructed to have a surveyand profile made of the proposedchanges.

How to Get the Best MulesThere is need for a greater use ofdraft hordes in the South for thepioduction of mules. The draft mule iscommon in the South buc when hishistory is written up it will be foundthat he was born in Missouri. Illinoisand Indiana ; was raised in Kentuckyand Tennessee and spent his matureyears in the Carolinas. Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisana.Light to medium weight draft mareswith plenty of quality produce thehighest Driced mules on the market today. The lightweight draft maresweichine frnm 1,400 to 1,600 pound3can be buuj-ht for less money on theNorthern markets than the weightytrotting or saddle bred mare. It consequently is a question of economics touse the draft mare with quality to produce our mules. That the nraft mareproduces the highest type of mules isshown bv the fact tnat nearly all ofthe highest priecd mules on the market are evidently from draft mares.Blue ribbons on mules at the Statefairs in the Iasl fewjyearshave alwaysgone to the mule3 that were out ofdraft mares. There has been in thisrespect an entire change from thepractice that prevailed a few yearsago when ribbons were tied on thelight and more or less fine bonedmules.ADes Moines man had an attack ofmuscular rhematism in nis shoulder.A friend advised him to go to HotSprings.

A musical and operatic event of thefirbt magnitude is announced for. theLexington Opera House, Thursday,January 2, when the De Koven OperaCo., composed of many of the foremost gi and and light opera stars ofthe country, will be heard in"an elaborate revival of "Robin Hood." Thefamous opera by Reginald De Koveoand HarryB. Smith, which for twentytwo years has been the recognizedAmerican light opera classic.The De Koven Co., of which DanielV. Arthur is the managing director,was brought into existence in order torevive the glories of opera comiqueand restore to the American stage astyle of entertainment which in thesedays of song and dance has almost disappeared from view. The plan contemplated a company of artists whoshould gradually develop a repertoireof light opera, and was planned on thesame scale which has maae the operacomique ofParis an internationally famous institution. Mr. De Koven, being the prize mover in the enterprise,and one of America's foremost composers, was asked to head the company.As a further compliment to him, hisown opera, "Robin Hood," one of themost popular operas of this or anyother day, was "elected as the firstproduction of the new company.Grand opera stars of internationalfame were engaged lor the company,and with an all star cast and a gorgeous scenic investiture and picturesquecostuming, "Robin Hood" vas revived at the New Amsterdam Theatre inNew York laat spring, with phenomenaljesults. For six months the opera,which had already been sung nearlyten thousand times in all parts of theglobe, drew capacity audiences. Theprofits were limited only by the seating capacity of this enormous theatre.Then the De Koven Opera Companyinaugurated a tcur of the principalcities, with the cast unchanged. Inspite of the enormous expense of moving one hundred and ten people, ofpaying a salary list of nine thousand,two hundied dollars each week, together with the colossal expense of aspecial orchestra, "Robin Hood" hasbeen presented in some half dozen cities, and in each case the music lovingpublic has shown its appreciation ofthis remarkable offering. It is a grandopera production, yet is given at priceswithin the range of all.This Dreeentation ot "Robin Hood"is unquestionably the greatest of allrevivals of the nation's light operaclassic, and it is safe to say that neveragain will the music loving publichave the opportunity of hearing sucha remarkable cast in any light opera atless than grand opera prices. Thepriges will be S2.50 and 2 on the lowerfloor; $2, 1.50 and $1 in balcony. Thesale of seats will open Tuesday morning, December 31.

It looked atone time as if Millersburg wjould beswept with another destructive tire.The building with its contents, astable belonging to Mr. E. B. Taylor,a small ntable, the property of theLouisville and Nashville railroad,are a total loss.The training and feed stable of McIntyre & Turner, which is just northof the blacksmith shop, was .on fireseveral times. Had the stableburned and the large frame warehouseadjoining it there is no certaintywhere it would have stopped as Iherawas a south wind blowing at the time.The origin of the fire is unknown.Everybody left the building about sixo'clock Thursday. Mr. Taylor saysthere was nothing of a combustible nature about the place, all Uhe doors hadbeen securely fastened. After thefire was discovered it was found thatthe"back"door had been opened.

Thefirm had received a consignment of sixnew buggies within the past few days.There were also other vehicles, tools,supplies and dressed lumber in thebuilding. The loss ot Taylor & Bowling is estimated at 3,500 with an insurance of $1,200. 1 he loss on theother buildings will not exceed $500.The firm has" recently purchased theblacksmithjShop of G. W.
