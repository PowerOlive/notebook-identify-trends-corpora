Alice Joyce
IN
"The Prey"
A sensational story of tangled lives.
In this emotional society drama, Alice
Joyce is seen in the midst of gorgeous set
tings, in banquet halls and ball rooms, in
palatial drawing rooms and suites de
luxe; and she proves again the age-old
truth that a woman's heart can beat as
sadly beneath the costliest silks as be
neath more humble garb.
From the opening scenes when as a
girl who finds merely living a positive joy,
to the more mature and shadowed period
when every circumstance seems to drive
the arrow of pain more deeply into her
heart, Alice Joyce,- the heroine of this
drama, is superb, and scales new emo
tional heights.
She is strongly supported in the in
tense scenes of this unusual play, and the
production is magnilicently mounted.
