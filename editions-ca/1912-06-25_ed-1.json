Paris Boy Seeks to Reach Home.
A dispatch from Savanah, Ga., Sat
urday was as follows : "His last ten
cents gone, homeless and without a
place to sleep. Henry Hodges, an
eighteen-year-old lad, has apnlied to
the police and the Associated Charities
for lodging until he can secure
sufficient money to take him to his
home at Paris, Ky.
"A victim of tuberculosis of the
bone of the left leg near the knee, the
youth still locks the world in the face
with a ready smile, without pessimism
or rebellion.
"Two and a half years ago Hodges
Iftt his home in Kentucky to seek a
living for himself and means of sup
porting his widowed mother. Eighteen
months auo tie went to Tampa to work
yt hi trad; t house painting. Six
ins nths bii tr-e di ease, from which ke
wat Hireadv suffering in a mild form,
became afute. He was taken to a hos
ni nl for cmui i is diseases, where in
ord -r to av i-- other limbs, it was
decided to take off his left arm. In
this condition the hospital turned him
out on the world.
"With a pitiful small sum of money
in his posession the boy started to
work his way home. His money last
ed until he reached Savannah, and here
he spent his last dime for food. With
nothing left in his pockets and star
vation staring him in the face, he was
forced to apply to the. charities of the
city for aid.
"Crippled in arm and leg, there is
little he can do to earn a living. He
has been advised to write home to his
mother for funds, but she is m string
ent circumstances herself and the boy
hates to apply to her. He hopes rath
er to be able in some manner to work
his way through. The boy refuses to
beg on the streets.
"Kind-hearted people have rallied to
the assistance of the lad A consider
able purse has already been made up
for him. The police, whose guest re
has been at the barracks Eince reach
ing Savannah, hope to obtain reduced
rates for him over the railroads."

Human Skull Unearthed.
While engaged in excavatjng for the
foundation of the Doyle buildinz, near
the corner of Main and Eighth streets,
Friday afternoon, w.orkmen unearthed
a human skull. The cranium wa3
iound at a depth of fifteen feet and
w?.s badly crushed by the nick of work
men. Close to the skull were found
several portions of the vertebra of a
human. The skull was very thin and
showed very high cheek bones, indi
cating thai it was a part of the skele
ton of an Indian woman. The teeth
of both the lower and upper jaws were
remarkably well preserved, and from
the condition of the skull it was evi
dent that it had been buried tor a
great many yeavs. Kain which fell
shoitly after the grewsome find was
made compelled the workmen to stop
digging, and as soon as work can he re
sumed an effort will be made to un
earth other portions of the skeleton
which are believed to hb in the vicin
ity of where the skull waafound. .
