Have You Thought
of Your Liver?
When you get up with a
heavy dull headache and a
bad taste in your mouth the
chances are your liver needs
cleaning. One of the easiest
ways to get it into shape is
to stir two teaspoonf uls of
Liver Saline into half a glass
of cold water and swallow
it just before breakfast. The
result will be a relieved
stomach and an active liver.

LIVER SALINE
4 is sold in two sizes, 30c and
(50c, and we recommend it
in every respect.

The following announcement
cards have been issued:
"Mrs. J. A. Colliver announces
the marriage of her daughter, Dora
Edith, to Mr. Orie Harvey Smith,
Thursday, August 16, 1917, Paris,
Ky."
The young couple had set Satur
day, Aug. 18, as the day upon which
the union of hearts and hands would
be cnsummated, but for reasons best
known to themselves, the marriage
date was moved up to Thursday.
Mr. Smith and Miss Colliver went
to the home of Rev. W. E. Ellis, at
Tenth and Main streets, Thursday
evening, at 7:30, when the ceremony
uniting them for better or worse, was
performed by Rev. Ellis.in the pres
ence of a few personal friends and
relatives. After the ceremony Mr.
and Mrs. Smith left for a short bridal
trip. They will make thei- home in
Paris.
The bride is the daughter of Mrs.
J. A. Colliver, and a sister of Mr.
C. E. Colliver, of South Main street.
She has been for the past few months
connected with the Simon Depart
ment Store, in (Paris. Mr. Smith is
a son of Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Smith,
his father being Superintendent of
the Paris Cemetery. He is a mem
ber of the clerical force in the
yardmaster's office of the Louisville

RELIGIOUS.
On Sunday, Sept. 2, the last quar
terly meeting of the Paris Methodist
church will be held. Presiding Elder
C. F. Oney, of the Frankfort District,
will be present as presiding officer.
He will also conduct the quarterly
communion services.
Rev. John Christopherson, for
mer pastor of the North Middletown
Christian church, occupied the pul
pit of the Paris Christian church
Sunday morning. Rev. Christopher
son has accepted the pastorate of the
Christian church at Williamsburg,
Ky. Rev. W. E. Ellis preached at the
North Middletown church Sunday
morning.
It must have been a sense of the
fitness of things that led the congre
gation of the Corinth, Ky., church to
employ Rev.s Sparrow and Canary to
conduct a revival there. The relig
ious editor of THE NEWS ventures
to suggest the opinion that the rev
erend gentlemen must be "birds" in
a revival.
