GAME WARDENS MAE3S RAID
State Game Warden A. W. Bul
lock, and County Game Warden Jas.
D. McClintock, both of Paris, made
another raid on fish and game traps
in Harrison county, near the Rob
ertson county line. They blew up
with dynamite two large fish dams,
in Licking river, each containing
two fish traps. Five basket traps
were found near the river, secreted
in high weeds. These were also des
troyed. No arrests were made, but
the officials have clues they are
working up, which may lead to the
capature of the law violators.
The Shelbyville Record, comment
ing on Mr. Bullock's good work,
says:
"State Game Warden Bullock, for
merly of Shelbyville, was fired on by
violators of the fish and game laws
five times while investigating their
misdeeds in Robertson and Harrison
counties the first of the week. All of
the bullets missed their mark. Mr.
Bullock, whose record as a public
official has always been praise
worthy, is now making his head
quarters at Paris."
