"The Virginian' at (he Orpheum
Following the, unusually successful
week in musical comedy the Orpheum
players will again return to the drama
beginning" Sunday' matinee, November
5, when they will produce the favorite
of all'Western plays, "The Virginian."
"The Virignian" is too well known to
enter into a lengthy discussion of the
plot, same being adapted from Owen
Winter's popular book of the same
name. The Orpheum Players are pre
pared to present "The Virignian" in a.
manner ana atmospnere oniy iouna in
New Yoik productions. As well as
being in a wonderful position to cast
the play so that each character will be
in the hands of a capable actor or ac
tress, the scenic effects are receiving
unlimited attention, in fact nothing
more could be done to make the .play
perfect in every detail if it were be
ing played for a season's run instead
uf just one week. Wilson Melrose, the
tall handsome leading man of the
Orpheum Players, will have a part
that if it were written expressly for
him it couldn't have suited him any
better. Mr. Melrose will no dobut
win fresh honors in this character,
although the nice things that have
been said of him by press and public
would suffice for the rest of his pro
fessional career The character of the
Virignian was originally played by
Uustin Farnum, wno had a very suc
cessful run in the niece. Miss Elsie
Esmond, the charming leading lady,
will be seen in the character of Mollie
Wood, the school teacher, a lovable
character in which Miss Esmond will
undoubtedly rivet the warm spot al
ready fixed in the hearts of her many
admirers. "Trampaa" will be played
by Walter Dickinson, whose interpre
tation of the part will be one of the
hits of the show. The Orpheum
Theatre is having a very successful
saason and the character of the plays
announced for forthcoming presenta
tion is an ample assurance that the
policy of the Orpheum Players in pre
senting the best stock production in
America is being carried out. Usual
matinee on Sunday, Thursday and Sat
urday, j
Young Rash Exonerated.
