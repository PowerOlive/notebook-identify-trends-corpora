At close of our Civil War in 1865
there appeared in the London Times
the following
If that mischievous financial pol
icy which had its origin in the North
American Republic during the late
Civil War in that country should be
come indurated down to a fixture
then that government will furnish its
moey without cost It will have all
the money that is necessary to carry
on its trade and commerce It will
become prosperous beyond precedent
in the history of civilized nations of
the world The brain and wealth of
ah countries will go to North America
THAT GOVERNMENT MUST BE
DESTROYED OR IT WILL DE
STROY EVERY MONARCHY ON
THIS GLOBE
The famous Hazzard circular to
capitalists in New York and the Buell
Bank circular to United States Bank
ers both emanating from London and
the fabulous corruption fund raised in
England and Germany estimated at
1500000 were the agents that se

government during the past year gold

STUCK IN THE SNOW
e YfeavelInK by Sledge IA
frttMM4a In Winter
Traveling by gladge in Siberia in
winter b its perils as the experience
of Mr Robert L Jefferson and bis
friends goes to illustrate The incident
is told in Roughing It In Siberia
We had chattered six sorry looking
horses to drag ni on lo the next stage
It was night when we started The driv
er maudlin drunk had to be helped
to his seat and we set off along the
narrow roadway at the usual gallop
which however soon dwindled into a
mere shuffle through the snow We bad
gone to sleep and some hours after our
horses which was lying buried up to
its neck II was clear that the driver
had fallen from his seat and that the
horses had wandered from the track
The poor beasts were stuck fast and a
closer inspection showed one of them
to be dead literally frozen to death If
we would save ourselves from the same
fate prompt action was necessary
The other horses were nearly suc
cumbing They lay flat on their stom
achs and nibbled at the snow We cut
the dead animal adrift and using the
spare rope as whips we stood on either
side of the living and lashed them till
onr arms ached At length they moved
and by pushing and pulling we got the
sledge turned Then step by step with
much floundering and many falls we
began to retrace our way
All this in pitch darkness in a raw
cold wind and in momentary expecta
tion of one or all of the hqrses dropping
dead
It was a terrible experience but we
regained the road and finally reached
the village

to What He la
I was greatly amused said a New
Orleans citizen who has lately made a
visit abroad to notice bow the term
Yankee widens in application as one
gets farther and farther away from the
habitat of the real thing
In New York a Yankee is common
ly supposed to be a native of Connecti
cut Vermont or Massachusetts and I
have noticed that the name is applied
to mean skinflints rather than to the
people in general In St Louis a Yankee
is understood loosely to be any one from
the extreme northeast Here in New
departure Gaskell woke me and said he Orleans the term includes pretty nearly
thought something was wrong everybody above Mason and Dixons
The sledge was at a standstill and line in short northerner andSTan
our shouts to the yemshik brought no kee are more or less synonymous
responsa Blaok darkness prevailed I I Now oomes the really absurd part
bundled out of the sledge so benumbed of it although quite in line with what
that I could scarcely move I felt along j I have just remarked While I was in
the sledge sinking to my knees in the London I found myself continually re
snow f erred to as a Yankee by natives who
The drivers nerch was emntv and had learned I was from New Orleans
just then I stumbled over one of the I think you Yankees are very

wanted tu be extra pleasant I know
several from your state I tried to ex
plain at first but I soon got tired of
that I was sure to be greeted by a stare
of amazement But I thought all
Americans were Yankees doncher
know would be the usual protest
Later on I met a very intelligent
hotel keeper at Bern in Switzerland
and in the course of conversation he re
marked that he had an extremely agree
able countryman of mine staying at his
house the previous season As you are
both Yankees he said you may by
chance know him Where does he
live I asked In Buenos Ayres re

INDIAN SIGNAL SERVICE
They Have Long Telephoned by the
Use of Drums
Travelers in uncivilized countries
have often wondered how some savage
tribes were able to transmit news for
hundreds of miles with no apparent
facilities for doing 60 An interesting
light is thown on this subject by Jose
Bach who tells of the means by whioh
the Indians on the Amazon communi
cate with each other at a distance The
natives live in groups of 100 to 200
persons in settlements half a mile or a
mile apart In each dwelling there is a
wooden drum which is buried for half
its height in sand mixed with
the memory of whose exploits still lives j ment8 of wood bone and mica and has
in the chronicles of the middle ages
In the year 999 Liege reckoned among
its valiant chiefs one Jean Colin He
acquired the name Maillard from his
chosen weapon being a mallet where
with in fight he used literally to crush
his opponents In one of the fends
which were of perpetual recurrence in
those times he encountered the Count
de Lourain in a pitched battle and so
runs the story in the first onset Colin
Maillard lost both his eyes He ordered
his esquire to take him into the thickest
of the fight and furiously brandishing
bis mallet did such fearful execution
that victory soon declared itself for him
When Robert of France heard of these
feats at arms he lavished favor and
honors upon Colin and so great was
the fame of the exploit that it was com
memorated in the pantomimic repre
sentations that formed part of tbe rude
dramatic performances of tbe age By
degrees the children learned to act it
for themselves and it took the form of
a familiar sport
The blindfolded pursuer as with
bandaged eyes and extended hands he
gropes for a victim to pounce upon
seems in some degree to repeat tbe ac
tion of Colin Maillard the tradition of
which is also traceable in the name

Some of the best of Dean Pigons sto

One of these concerns his verger one

with gray hair skullcap gown and

a triple diaphragm of leather wood
and rubber When this drum is struck
with a wooden mallet the sound travels
far and is distinctly beard in the other
drums in the neighboring dwellings
It is beyond doubt that the transmis
sion of the sound takes place through
the earth since the blows struck are
scaroely audible outside of the houses
in which the instruments are placed
After a malucca or dwelling has
been called up by an initial blow
conversation is carried on between the
two drums Mr Bachs explanation is
that the communication is facilitated
by the nature of the ground the drums
doubtless resting upon one and the same
stratum of rock since transmission
through ordinary alluvial earth could
not be depended upon This method
furnishes an ingenious modification of
the process employed by Indians for
perceiving distant noises such as the
gallop of a horse which consists in ap
plying the ear to the earth St Louis

Tod Sloanes gameness will never be
questioned by those who saw him win a
race on Walter in a nose finish at the
old East St Louis track some years
ago After the race Tod was hardly able
to dismount Then it was learned that
he had broken an arm in the race It
seems that he was crowded against the
fence in a jam around one of the turns
and broke his arm Switching the reins
to his good arm he rode the race out
with great determination putting up a
