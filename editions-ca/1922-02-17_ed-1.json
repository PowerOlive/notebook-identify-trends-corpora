SCHOOL NOTES
One hundred and fifty new
&ooks from the Kentucky Library
Commission at Frankfort, have just
oeen received and are ready for use.
These books are open to the public
for reading.
The following were visitors at
ihe Wednesday morning Chapel ex
ercises: Mesdames M. C. Grimes, G.
W: Judy, Ed. Hill, Carl Henson,
Mrs. Henson, Jas. Burroughs, Mollie
Burroughs, Tom Dwelly, J. W. Lan
caster, Edgar Hurst, Tom Stone,
Sherman Mitchell, Misses Nannie
Burroughs, Edna Clarke, Lillian
Bodkin, little Misses Christine Lan
caster and Elizabeth Hill, Master
James Stone, and Messrs, M. C.
Grimes and Thomas Stone. Under
the direction of Miss Nannie D.
Clarke, the First Grade gave a most
interesting program, thus reviving
the grade chapsl exercises that were
so interesting last year. Demon
stration work in reading and pen
manship proved beyond a doubt that
"little folk.," can accomplish much
under an efficient teacher. "Will
You Be My Valentine" was one en
tertaining feature wherin the little
lads and lassies appeared in most at
tractive costume, while the cherry
tree was actually cut down by a rep
resentative little George Washing
ton. Minor parts on the program
were well rendered. Altogether it was
anost creditable to both teacher and
pupils, notwithstanding the fact
that chicken pox and bad colds have
but repently kept many of the chil
dren out of school.

the first team of ' Carlisle High

11 in favor of Carlisle High. Two
of Millersburg's best players on
second boys' team, Price and Hick
