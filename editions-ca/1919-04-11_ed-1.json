Mr. S. M. Allen, Cashier of -the
Farmers Bank, is in receipt of a let
ter from the Postofflce Department,
at Washington, D. C, to the effect
that the Government h'as accepted
the terms for the remodeling -of the
postofflce building, and 'enlarging- it,
which is the property, of the Farm
ers Bank. The contract for the new
building will be let as soon as posi
sible, and work will be rushed speed
ily. The postofflce will be moved to
the Ingels property, occupied by the
nffipp nf Mr TV T1 P.larkft. Thfi nflftr.ft
I will return to the pld building it oc
jcupied for many years. There has
been three buildings on the site oc
cupied by the postofflce: Two of
them were destroyed by lire. Until
the last few years the postofflce oc
cupied this site for. more than a half
century. During the time' when Mr.
R. B. Boulden was P. M. the Farmers
Bank purchased, what was known as
the Smith corner. The building was
remodeled, the bank occupying the
corner portion of it, while the lower
part of the ground floor is occupied
by the postofflce. This is the most
commodious office that -Millersburg;
has had. At the time the offlce was
moved into the building it was
thought to be large enough for .all
purposes, but it has grown too small.
Some time ago the postofflce depart
ment announced that it would hax
to have more floor "Space. When tfyg
new offlce is completed it will bp
convenient in every particular, and
a credit to to a town larger than
Millersburg. The Farmer -Bank pro:
poses sparing no expense that will
make this building what it should be.
The bank itself will also undergo
many changes and will .'be. much
larger when finished. The "building
will be one of the most attractive in
Central Kentucky, which' is due to
the enterprising Cashier, S- M. Allen,
and no less enterprising . president,
W. D. Mclntyre, who is one of he
best, financiers in Central Kentucky,
These two men are indee4 two live
wires, and are doing much, to make
a greater Millersburg.
