SALVATIONIST AS
TRIAL AID
INDUS-
It is generally recognized that the
greatest force against industrial un
rest and Bolshevism in this country
is- content and plenty in the homes
of those who are usually the victims
of want,. Poverty and distress are
the forerunners of anarchy and dis
order. For these reasons it is recog
nized that the daily work of the Sal
vation Army in any great city in
North America to-day is probably
the most effective antidote that can
be administered to the disease which
has already commenced to taint the
great body which upholds the indus
tries of America.
The rules and regulatipns of the
Salvation Army are interesting
when viewed from this standpoint.
According to the regulations laid
down for him, the Corps Officer in
the Salvation Army must spend at
least eighteen hours every week vis
iting the community in which his
Corps is located. It is his business
to seek out the poor, the bereaved,
and the unfortunate, and any who
especially need help or guidance. To
many such homes, the visit of the
Salvation Army worker means new
life and at any time, by day or
night, he holds himself in readiness
to stretch out a helping hand. The
entire Corps also visit hospitals,
iails. work houses 'and all institu-
tions in its community where there
may be human suffering and despair.
At the Christmas season, bounti
ful baskets of ,food are given out to
needy 'families; "in the hot months
poor mothers and children are taken
to some spot where fresh air and the
beauties of nature, combined with
good food, give them a new and more
hopeful view of life.
In brief, the work of the Salva
tion Army is to help the man or
woman who is down, whether he is
"down on his luck" or down in. sin.
With the Salvationist is the belief
that there is hope and happiness and
another chance for all.

ance wishes to emphasize the impor
tance to service men of one of the

Tides that "No eompesation ijhall be

PEITZI SCHEFF DISAPPOINTS
HER MAYSVILLE AUDIENCE
Because of an attack of laryngitis,
resulting from a cold contracted
while visiting the grave of her for
mer husband, John Fox, Jr., in the
Paris Cemetery, Monday, Fritzi
Scheff was unable to play her role in
"Glorianna" at Maysville, Tuesday
night. The part was taken by her
understudy, Miss Virginia Burke.
The Maysville Bulletin says:
With every seat in Washington
Opera House sold and standing room
all taken, the hundreds of people
from this city and surrounding coun
tryside who came to see Fritzi Scheff
in 'Glorianna' waited patiently for
the curtain-rise and the famous
star's first appearance before a Mays
ville audience, when they were given
a shock and consequently disappoint
ment, the manager appearing be
fore the footlights and announcing
that Miss Scheff would not appear in
the cast, but that her understudy,
Miss Virginia Burk, would take the
part of 'Glorianna.' .
"The gentleman making the state

ill at her hotel, the Central, and un

Samuels. She was suffering
PREDICTS HIGHER COST OF
READING MATTER.
The price of novels will soon
soar. The higher cost of fiction is
inevitable, whatever the outcome of
the printers' vacation, according to
New York publishers. If the pres
ent difficulties were adjusted on the
basis of the offer of the master
printers, novels and juveniles would
be sold for $2.
If the strikers win the price will
be $2.50. If there is a compromise
we shall probably have a $2.25
novel. Fiction readers will grumble
but they will pay. New authors will
find it harder to break in when the
price goes up, for it is natural to
suppose that the volume of sales will
diminish and the publishers will be
less inclined than formerly to take a
chance with unknown writers.
NEW YORK PRINTERS STILL "ON
STRIKE." '
REV. CURT JETT CONVERTS RE
FORM SCHOOL BOYS.
KENTUCKY MAY BE MECCA FOR
FILM STARS SOON.
.
Will Kentucky become a stamping
ground for the moving picture pro
ducers? Will the bluegrass regions,
the beautiful mountain country, the
hills, the valleys, become the pic
turesque' backgrounds for pretty film
romances or dashing melodramas?
This seems more than probable
judging by the increasing number of
stories that are being written for the
screen with good old Kentucky as
the locale. It will be recalled that
several of D. W. Griffith's most re
cent productions were laid in Ken
tucky , where this master producer
spent his boyhood. .Other directors
of Paramount - Artcraft picures
seem to have a decided liking for
Kentucky as a setting for their film
creations.
And,-perhaps, Kentucky's fame as
the home of beauteous maidens may
havp much to do with this move
ment for what director would over
look the possibilities of having his
"extras" picked from the beauties of
a State famous for its fair folk?
Thomas H. Ince, one of the Para-mount-Artcraft
directors of fame,
has staged many stories with the
Blue Grass State as a background,
but has duplicated Kentucky scenery
out West. He knows Kentucky well,
having spent much time in this State
while a resident of Cincinnati, Ohio.
Many of his Kentucky friends have
urged him to send a producing com
pany into this State to take pictures
o trnTrmrtalize the State on the
screen. x
Billie Burke, one of the Para-mount-Artcraft
popular stars, is
known to be a strong admirer of the
Blue Grass State and has never
missed '"an- opportunity to motor
through the l country hereabouts
while playing at Kentucky theatres.

others of the Artcraft-Paramount
studios would look mighty good in

The printers' strike situation is
more complicated than ever in New
York.
New York pressman's union No.
51, which previously had decided to
rejoin its international organiza
tion, if permitted to do so in a body,
and then return to work, reversed
its decision and voted to stay on
strike. Criticism by other "seced
ing" pressmen is believed to be re
sponsible for the change of attitude.
Meanwhile hundreds of pressmen r
and feeders who reported for work
were prevented from carrying on
their trade because of lack of com
positors, ' who are on a "vacation."
Compositors are said to hold the key
to the situation, and until they re
turn to work little hope is held out
for full resumption of work in the
larger shops of the city.
It was stated that twenty more
shops resumed partial operation,
making 130 operating in all, but a
canvass of the plants showed little
improvements over conditions.

THE BANKER AND THE BOND
Arkansas bankers have evidenced
their appreciation of the value of
War Savings Stamps and the new
Treasury Certificates in the most
convincing manner. Running in
many of the newspapers of Arkan
sas are a series of attractive adver
tisements, paid for by the banks,
that carry to the general public the
message of the particular bank,
coupled with the message from the
U. S. Treasury Department showing
the advantages of saving and in
vesting the money thus saved i
War Savings Stamps. There may be
a few isolated cases when a banker
feared, erroneously, that money in
vested in these "baby bonds" mignt
deplete his savings deposits. But the
Arkansas bankers have a broader
vision. They know that if they can

save, they are laying the foundation
for future prosperity, and that the

and safe investment is building for
his own good and the good of the
community that he serves. -
WHAT COUlTRY GIRLS CAN DO.
Our country girl owes something
to the farm on which she lives. She
need not be a "one-talent girl."
She may be a help to the less for
tunate. She may serve a whole
countryside by upholding knolwedge,
culture, character, the principles of
hierh living:, and thus enrich her
State.
Our moral defenses, we are told,
are greater than flags or armies.
Good books are moral uplifts. . A
good library where every, volume
may tell its own story, means
knowledge, progress, power. All of
these belong to our inheritance. We
are entitled to clearn something of
science, philosophy, literature, the
fine arts and the great institutions of
civilized society. What music alone
means to a country home has never
been estimated.
After all, it remains that our first
concern is what we owe to ourselves.
The home may be well arranged,
well ordered, the meals as a neces
sity to health, well balanced. But
the human body must have constant
care. Proper diet, daily exercise and
bathing are great aids to youth
and suppleness, comeliness, and
higher usefulness. And still there
come the daily essentials of living
the care of the nails, the teeth, .the
hair and not least, the daily wearing
of the gown that truly clothes one
in an artistic sense. Just here let us
"speed the day" when the many la
borsaving conveniences will invade
our country homes that the young
may have more time for themselves.
Of all girls, it seems to me our
girls of the country should excel in
ideals. They have the vantage
ground in fields and hills and woods.
They live within the everlasting
beauty of sunsets and stars and sun
risings the finer things that touch
our life and swing our souls into
harmony with nature. If mental
gifts are spiritual realities, there are
lessons in birds and flowers and for
estry as in many wild created
things.
Not that ideals include the ' sole
duty of young womanhood. I am on
record somewhere as advocating the
woman who loves best her home and
surroundings. It is she that blesses
her neighborhood; this type of her,
whether of the -working or business
class, that circles toward the home.
It is the fine personality of her that
counts. Poverty does not enslave
her, nor wealth allure her. She has
the wisdom of the world condensed
to a synopsis of every day living.
She is optimistic and sweet-toned
and high-souled. She never grows
old.
