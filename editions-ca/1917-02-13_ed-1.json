The Worst Handicap
in the world is WORRY it ties a man hand and foot
takes off the. edge ofthis talents and cuts down his
ability.
WORRY as to what will happen to the family if any
thing should happen to you, will do more than anything
else to reduce your earning power.
LIFE INSURANCE solve the problem-the day you get
your Insurance Policy, is the day you cut your fetters.
LIFE INSURANCE is the only sure cure for WORRY.
