(28-lt)The European war will have a tremendous effect upon the retail pricesof many articles, and ft is expected to practically stop, for atime at least,importations from Europe. This means that laces, gloves, linens, toys,trimmmings, many notions, as well as many articles made in this couitry of raw materials or accessories tbat are imported, such as yarns, dyes,etc, will hi alai)3t lni335sible to S2cure.Prices are sure to advance on all such articles. In fact, many sf theretail stores of the larger cities have already advanced the price on somearticles that w car ry in stock, some as much as a hundred per cent. Weare of the opinion that a retail store, an institution like ours,is dutybound to work in behalf of its customers. This has always been our aim,and in a critical time like this, when much of the merchandise that we areoffering to you could not be replaced at the prices we ask, we are, nevertheless, maintaining our old prices. It will be time enough when we haveto purchase new goods at higher prices for us to advance prices to you.Our object in this store editorial is to advise you of our determinedpolicy of protecting our customers to the extent of our ability and also toadvise you beforehand that much merchandise will advance in prices,heavily, as well as being hard to obtain, a little later on, so that if possibleyou may provide now for some of your future wants.8z2 - tI iI cdami xl r4r 11ex- i "mmfliB v- m9w m msm " s" x xji UtUlt YV 11CIC lVCllcllJlllLV lVClIlS. &. 31iness was usually good.

It is right. Prohibition has to do with some otherman's control of you. It is wrong.' Temperance is self-imposed andself-controlled. Prohibition is imposedby others without your consent, inspite of your protest, and enforcedwith a policeman's club.Temperance always implies use,but forbids abuse. Prohibition forbids use even in moderation.Therefore, if temperance is right,prohibition is wrong.Every plea for temperance is an indictment of prohibition. When twoprinciples are fundamentall and eternally opposed to each other, both cannot be right.People who stand for right cannotsuport a policy that is wrong in principle. fNo Christian can support a movement that is un-Christian in character. v No sincere advocate of true temperance can afford to stand for a quackremedy for intemperance.Contrary 'To Reason.Prohibition is contrary to reason.Every proposition that is fundamentally right can be reconciled with common sense. It never can be reasonable to prohibit anything the use ofwhich is proper, but the abuse ofwhich may result in evil.If it were reasonable to prohibitanything because its use is abused, itwould be necessary to prohibit allgood. Every good thing in this worldis abused by some people. To forbidthe use of the good because of thisfact would not only be unreasonable,but idiotic.If the logic of prohibition-is reasonable then it would be proper to prohibit 4:he use of money. The abuseof money is a prolific source of crime.The right to free speech leads to con-'stant abuse aid great evil. Is it reasonable to prohibit free speech because of this fact?In th'e third chapter of St. James,verses 6 and 9 we read:"And the tongue is a fire, a worldof iniquity; so is' the tongue amongour members that it defileth thewhole body, and setteth on fire thecourse of nature; and it is set on fireof hell."For every kind of beast and ofbirds and of serpents and of things inthe sea, is tamed and hath beentamed of mankind; but the tonguecan no man tame; it is an. unruly evil,fuir of'Ndeadly poison. Therewithbless "we God, even the Father; andtherewith eursewe men- which aremade after the similitude of God."If the 1q0c of prohibition is sound,if you can destroy a thing because ofthe evil resulting from the abuse ofits use, then it would be reasonableto tear every man's tongue from histhroat. Like liquor, fire, and water,the tongue has a dual nature. Itsuse is proper. Infinite evil resultesfrom its obuse.If the priciple of prohibition issound, it would be proper to forbidthe exercise of all natural passions.The pathway to hell is literally pavedwith the wrecks of men and womenwho were ruined by the abuse ofnatural passions.If the logic and philosophy of prohibition can be reconciled with reason, idiocy is wisdom, slavery right,and freedom is a crime.People constantly abuse liberty:Yet nothing could be more unreasonable than to reduce men and womento the status .of wooden Indians orlegal jumping jacks on that account.The utter absurdity of prohibitionwill occur to every reasonable personwho stops to consider that societytrusts you with liberty to go to hell.The State trusts you with liberty tocommit murder, but prohibitionistsrefuse to trust you with liberty tomake, sell, or buy a scuttle of suds.A man gets sick. Ypu send for aj doctor. You give the sick man medicine, but you do not compel everyman in town to take medicine because one man is sick. That wouldbe unreasonable. Yet this is the logic,the doctrine, the philosophy and thepractice of prohibition.God gave man freedom of choicewhen he gave them reason. Withoutpersonal liberty, reason would be ajoke.It is utterly absurd to imagine thatyou can run society on the principleof an nsane asylum or a penitentiary.When a man needs a keeper, he oughtto be kept where he can do the leastpossible harm.We oppose prohibition not becausewe want to drink, but because it iscontrary to reason. Our opponentswill try to defend prohibition by attacking the liquor business. In sodoing they will admit the weakness, oftheir case. You cannot defend a proposition ty attacking something else.Prohibition as a principle muststand or fall own its own merits.Opposed toNature.Prohibition is not only contrary toreason, but it is opposed to nature.In conflict with nature men cannothope to win. Let the farmer planthis corn in December and his work,will be in vain.I can respect a law that forbids anyperson to throw bricks out of a tenstory window on to the heads of people in the street, but I would havesupreme contempt for any legislatorwho would write a bill to abolishgravity so that a brick could not fall.Let all nations in Congress assembled, pass a law. against the Fallsof Niagara, and Niagara will laughin the face of all .nations.But.

If he does notamount to a tinker's dam, I congratulate the girl. The thing in man thatjmakes prohibition a failure, makes.manhood a success. If you could.make prohibition a success, you-would make man a failure.Where did your hoy get the naturalImpulse to reject, resist and defy pro-lilbition? He got it from you. Youwould do the same thing and sowould I. Did we get it honestly?Go back with me to the Garden ofEden. Start at the beginning. Unless the Darwinian theory is true,Adam and Eve were the first of theiuman race. They were innocentpand perfect Unlike us, they did notliave long lines of ancestors, reachingbackward to dark ages with inheritedweakness, wickedness and sin.God placed these perfect people ina beautiful Eden, where there wasaiot a single excuse for going wrong.The birds sang night and day, thedlowers bloomed on every hand, and-when the storm struck the trees theyjmade music like a thousand harps.But one day there stood in theirpresence not an anti-Saloon Leagueleader with his self-assumed authority not a detective with -a 44in his hip pocket but there stood intheir presence the Omniponent Godwho flung a hundred million blazingsuns into space and holds the Universe in the hollow of his hands.This Omnipotent God, the embodi--mentof all authority, said to our ancestors, these perfect people:"Of every tree of the garden thoumayest freely eat "Up to the point of freedom all treeslooked alike to Adam and Eve. Theyhad no special curiosity concerningthe fruit of any particular tree, butwhen the Lord added:"But of the fruit of the tree whichis in the midst of the garden ye shall-aot eat of it, neither shall ye touch-it lest ye die," the curiosity of theseperfect people was aroused.What was the effect of this firstprohibition decree issued by the Supreme Authority to our perfect ancestors in Paradise? Why, whenAdam and Eve found that the Garden of Eden had gone prohibition, itjwas :a question of who would get tothe tree first, and Eve beat Adam toit She had to go some, too, believeme.Our opponents may argue that allthis proves that God was a Prohibitionists or that he made a mistake. Itproves nothing of the kind.This story in the Bible is given tous to illustrate the folly, fallacy, andinevitable failure of prohibition whenapplied either to the appetites or thenatural rights of man.Had God been a prohibitionists Hewould have built a fence around tlietree. Had God been a prohibitionist,Jle would have prohibited the snake.Our opponents will endeavor toprove that prohibition is not contraryt nature by pointing out the evilsof intemperance. It would be just asreasonable to attempt to justify infidelity, by proving the existence ofhyprocisy. - They will tell you thattke devil is opposed to prohibition.This is not true. Prohibition gavethe devil his first opportunity.A MenaceTo Manhood.Prohibition is not only contrary toreason and opposed to nature, but itis a menace to the development oftrue .manhood. It is only by exercising freedom of choice that one candevelop the faculty of self control.Prohibition is destined to rob men ofthis freedom, hence it would prevent42ie development of manhood's highestfaculty.You can no more develop moralforce without exercising peisonalliberty than you can develop physicalstrength without exercising yourncles. You can no more developtke faculty of self-control without"freedom of choice, than yon can develop mental power without exercising your brain.If you want to make your boy a"weakling, tie him to your prohibitionapron strings. Having prevented bylack ot exercise the proper development of the faculty - of self-control,your l,ov is liable to be wrecked u;the first storm that overtakes himat sea. It may not be the rock of intemperance, upon which his snip iswrecked, but some other. He maybe driven upon the shoals and reefsoC greed, jealously, lust or revenge,ad you may some day hear his helpless cries that rise above the roar ofike angry billows that engulf Tiislot forever.'

Of course.opponents will attempt to refute!r arfwoents oy painting a pitifulpicture of some poor drunkard. ButIt is far more important to develop-awai Manhood in the masses tban tosarin at their development in a futileeSert to save a few weaklings.Am Inmtkt., htfeeffiejeMoe.Fteblbttfea Ss ataaly a jumncs to. .. , iiiim, w& vpviyMRfyvuim m wn to row iroinswraI want to ask you a simple questionIs, it a compliment or an insult fora man to step up to you, look you inthe eye and say:"My friend, you are a weakling;you are incapable of choosing foryourself between good and evil; youneed a legal muzzle to keep you frombecoming a hog? I have selected myself to act as your guardian."This is exactly what prohibitionsay to every man and every woman.The whole prohibition contention isbased upon the idea that the citizenis a child and needs a guardian.Every dry parade . exemplifies this conception and illustrates the child ideaof citizenship. There will be a floatcontaining a number of little childrenin charge of a grown person or aguardian who. is there to see that thekids do not gouge each other's eyesout with their banners and tin horns.When a man fights the world for ajob and earns a dollar, that dollaris his by every law of God and man.If he spends it wisely he reaps a reward. If he snends it foolishly hesuffers the consequenceBut this experience is necessary to the develop-ment of his manhood. Of course, itmay sometimes work an injury to hiswife and children, but nothing ofvalue is ever won or retained withoutsuffering to some. They also sufferwhen he makes a bad investment inland", stocks or inventions, or putshis money in a bank that fails. Butthis right inherent in all men is paramount to the rights of a wife andchildren who happen to be exceptions. No other man can tell youwhat you shall do with your moneyand not insult your intelligence. Imade that statement in a speeci onetime and a minister sprang to nisfeet and shouted at the top of hisoice:"How about a man's wife?"And I yelled back at him in thesamt tone: "You let that man's witealone 'IWhen he recovered from the oao.ik,I said to the gentleman:"n ou have a wife and children ofyour own, you have a lifetime job. itis an insult to any other. man, rich orpoor, for you to assume for onemoment that he does not love hiswife and children as well as you love5 . a. -.v.'i e i,-yours, or is just as cayauic ui reviving care of them."The child idea of citizenship is absurd. I reject it. For 138 years wehave from Fourth of July platformsdeclared the American citizen to bea sovereign a king. The king doesnot need a guardian, and no man whoadmits that he needs one is competent to act as the guardian of another.If any man is to act as my guardianI want mm to get his appointmentin a court of record, according to lawand give a good and sufficient bondfor the faithful performance of hisduty in attending to my business.Take your choice oetween the childidea and the king idea of Americancitizenship. We who oppose prohibition look upon every citizen as asovereign. As sovereign citizens ofthis republic we can boast a coat ofarms' like the crowned heads of theold world. But our coat of armshows no Tmrbaric design emblematicof despotism and oppression. But itshows on the left a dove hovelingover the broken fragments of thronnsand the shattered shackles of humanslavery; on the right the Vulcan oflabor beating swords into plow sharesand spears into pruning hooks. Irthe center an eagle cleaving theclouds, bearing in its beak the motto,"Equal Rights to All," and in histalons a streamer inscribed with thelegend, "Right is Might."Such was the conception of ourfathers who established the nat'on,who suffered at Valley Forge and diedat Bunker Hill. This idea inspiredtheir valor on every battle field of thRepublic. They embodied this idealin the constitution of the UnitedStates, in the Declaration of Independence, and emblazoned it in letters of living light on the flag ofstursThis idea is worth fighting forworth dying to save. We oppose prohibition, not because we want to runsaloons, but because prohibition isan insult to manhood. .Our opponentswill try to prove that prohibition isnot an insult to your intelligence bydenouncing the white slave traffic, orsome other evil 'which they will attempt to connect with the liquortraffic. It would be just. as reasonable to attempt to prove that waterdoes not run down hill by affirmingthat a round square cheese exists inthe moon.Destructive ofHuman Equality.Prohibition is not only an insult tomanhood, opposed 'to nature, and contrary to reason, but it would destroythe equality of human rights. According to the genius of our institutions, you carry as much sovereignty under your hat as I carry tindermine. In all our rights we are equal.If this is not true, the Republic isbased upon a lie.I have no mere authority to saythat you shall not drink a glass ofbeer than you have to say that I shalldrink it. Neither can submit to theother and maintain equality of rights.But here is the main reason why yoncannot afford to let any man tell youwhat you shall not drink to-day. Youcannot be sure but what he willchange his mind to-morrow. Hemight tell you , to-day that you shallnot drink something you want. Tomorrow, having changed his mind, hecan make a monkey of you by demanding that you drink somethingyou don t want. Thiy Is the ridiculousposition in which prohibition placesa man. Reason, honor and pride Tebel at the very idea. Justice andliberty forbid.Before you sacrifice the equality ofHuman rights upon the altar of "prohibition, consider the price our fathers paid for this deathless principleConsider the value of this idea ofhuman equality. If you want to knowhow much it has been worth to theworld worth to the human racemeasure the progress made siuce1778 with all the progress made bymankind from the dawn of civilization to, the day our fathers proclamad aat all men are createdaqaLi Thaydwl notmean by-equali-ijr uim u me are ereatea eauaiiphjaicaBJv for y art not. Nor did!:hey refer to moral equality". Someare good, some are bad, and some areas the Englishmen say, "just 'alf and'alf." They did not mean that allmen are created equally mentally, because some are wise and some areotherwise. Our fathers meant bythat decaration that' all men are equalwith reference to their inalienablerights to life, liberty, the pursuit ofhappiness, and a voice in their owngovernment. I mean by a voice intheir own government the right togovern themselvs collectively asStates and Nations, and to governthemselves individually in the matterof temperance. I also want to emphasize the fact that by life our fathersdid not mean mere existence. Youcan nave existence ana wear a prohibition muzzle. You can have existence . and be in jail. You can haveexistence and be" a slave) but you cannot have liberty and prohibition.When our fathers declared that allmen are created equal, this old worldwas in darkness. Might made Right.Every ship of state was a piratecraft. Every ensign of sovereignty abloody butcher, while Freedom waschained to the dark, dungeon floorsof despotism, her white breast stained with blood. At the declarationthat all men are created equal, lightbroke through clouds, of darkness anddespotism, prison bars melted away,shackles fell from bruised and bleeding limbs, and the human race rosefrom its knees, looked the sun in theface, and commenced the mightiestmarch of progress ever witnessed bythe gods. Show me the automobile,the flying machine, the moving picture, wireless telegraphy, or anygreat invention that excites the admiration of gods and men, and I willshow you the children of Freedomand Human Equality.Show me the rack, the stake, thedungeon, the stocks, the thumbscrew,or any implement of torture or despotism, and I will show you the children of prohibition. We oppose prohibition not because we want to getdrunk, but because prohibition woulddestroy the equality of human rightsand turn the dial of Progress backward a thousand years.Cased Upona False Premise.Prohibition is not only destructiveof human equality, but its philosophyrests upon a false foundation. Thewhole contention is based upon afalse premise. When you argue froma false premise you may be as wiseas Solomon, but your conclusions willbe erroneous.There are two men in the liquorbusiness. One in front of the bar, theother behind. Which one of thesemen is responsible for the liquortraffic? One is the cause and theother the effect. If the man behindthe bar is the cause, the liquor business can be destroyed by voting himout of business. But on the otherhand, if he is the effect and the manin front of the bar the cause, votinghim out of business will ouly changethe channel through wheh the demand is to be supplied. I admit thatyou can vote the man behind the barout of business, but I deny that youcan vote the man in front of the barout of business. You can vote a towndry, but you cannot vote a man dry.If the traffic in liquor is evil," whichI deny, you could not cure the 'evil bytreating the effect instead ot thecause. The man in front is the cause,the liquor dealer the effect. Our opponents will make a strong argumentagainst the evils of intemperance.But every argument against the abuseof liquor is an argument for temperance, not prohibition. Our dry friendsare so hard for an argument in defense of prohibition that they arecompelled to use argument againstthe abuse and seek to make it ap-nlicable to the use of liquor. Theirlogic is absolutely unsound and utterly absurd. You cannot apply anyargument against the use of a thingthat is applicable only to its abuse.When a physician treats the effectinstead of the cause of your sickness,you call him a quack. Still I heardof a doctor like that who once saveda man's life. The poor devil sent' forhim and the doctor would not come.We reject prohibition not becausewe want to run a brewry, but because the whole contention rests upona false premise. Our dry friends willtry to prove that the prohibition contention does not rest upon a falsepremise because some men drink toexcess, some saloons are bad, certainpeople who drink are poor and otherscommit crimes. This is like tryingto establish the mnocence of a murderer by convicting some other manof theft. His logic is unsound andutterly absurd.An ImmoralProposition, 'Not ouly does the whole prohibition and Anti-Saloon League contention rest upon a false premises.but itis an immoral proposition. I knowthey claim to have a monopoly on allmorality, integrity and Christianvirtue connected with this controversy, but I am here to spoil thatmonopoly. When they have said,"This is a . moral question," theymeant that they were on the moralside of the proposition and all whooppose them stand for the immoralside of the question. Most prohibitionists .are good people, and whenthey realize the immoral character oftheir crusade, I feel certain they willabandon it. Prohibition is shown tobe an immoral proposition because itis destined to confiscate the liquorman's property without indemnity.You cannot pray loud enough to makethat right. You cannot pile up majorities big enough to make thatright. The principle-of confiscationwithout indemnity is exactly Hhe samemorally whether applied to bankproperty or brewry property, saloonproperty or farm property. It is notthe kind of property or the characterof the owner that determines themorality of this act. When the property or business in question has beena factor in the. legitimate commerceof the world for'ages, the morality ofconfiscation ist determine'd bvy the indemnity paid. for the property; takenor the' investment destroyed.' 'When a'StatVwkills a ; tubercularcow, she jttayjw a menace and a-nuisance, but it pays the fanner tor jthe property it destroys. This actstamps as immoral the proposition, todestroy the investment of any man,without the payment of a just indemnity. Some socialists argue that it wouldbe right to confiscate the propertyof capitalists, on the ground that theworking classes created the wealthuow in possession of the rich, andwere robbed. They hold that it would-be morally right to take this propertywithout paying indemnity. They havea better moral argument than the prohibitjionists, because prohibitionistscannot claim that they created thewealth now in possession of ' theliquor men unless they confess tohaving imbibed more booze thau wehave given them credit for.If you take my purse, that is theft.If you take my life, you call it murder. But when you take my liberty,that is prohibition. The brave inevery age of the world's historv havebeen willing to give up their propertyfor their lives, and then surrendertheir lives for liberty. If it is immoralto take my purse, a thing of littlevalue, it cannot he moral to tane thething of highest value a man's liberty. "We reject prohibition not becausewe want to make drunkards, but because prohibition it an immoral proposition. Our opponents try to prove thatprohibition is entirely moral becausethe United States abolished slavervwithout indemnifying the slaveowner. To make that argument goodthey'll have to show that there is nomorai aiuerence between selling a human being into slavery against hiswill, and sellirig a willing man a scuttle of suds. He will have to nmvAthat there is no moral difference between owning a case of beer and achattel slave.Undermines the3asis of Morality.Prohibition is not only an immoralproposition, but it strikes at the basisof all moralfty. This is a seriouscharge, and one that should be weighed with careful consideration. Noprinciple or movement ever had amore damaging charge broughtagainst. If I sustain this indictmenthonest prohibitionists will be compelled to abandon their position. Indetermining the morality of a question of this kind reason is the highestauthority.Instead of relying upon a dogmaticassertion to prove my charge I wantto ask this audience two questions.The only possible answer amII reveaithe basis of all morality:"Could God credit you with morality for doing something I compel youU' do?"I hear every person in this audience answer no."Could God credit me with moralityfor leaving something undone whirhyou prevented me from doing?'Again the verdict is unanimous andthe answer is no.These questions and answers provethat freedom of choice, or personalliberty, constitutes the basis of allmorality. In seeking to destrovfreedom of choice and drive a dagger into the heart of personal libertyprohibition underminds the 'basis ofall morality.You cannot have morality withoutpersonal responsibility. You cannothave personal responsibility withoutpersonal liberty. This is the rockupon which the prohibition shipbreaks to pieces.When you can. prove that waterdoes not run down hill you will beable to show that prohibition doesnot undermind the basis of morals.We antagonize prohibition not because we want to run a distilleiy, butbecause it strikes a blow at the basisof all morals. The drys will attemptto show that prohibition is moral:that it is right in principle becauseGod said "Thou shalt not kill." Unlike making, buylng, drinking andselling liquor, killing is never proper.Drinking becomes evil through theabuse of a, natural right. It is notwrong per se. Murder is wrong.You must drink to excess to becomea, drunkard. It is not necessary tokill to excess in order to become amurderer. Killing involves anotherman's life.Whether you kill is everybody's business. It is not everybody'sbusiness whether you take a drink.God prohibits the thing that in itselfis wrong that does not become evilby .abuse o excess. He prohibits,nothing that becomes evil by excess.In every such case temperance, regulation, is the divine order.Powerless as aRemedy for Intemperance.Prohibition is not only an immoralproposition, tending o undermind thefoundation of morals, destructive ofhuman equality, -and contrary to reason, but it is powerless as a remedyfor intemperance.Thts is shown by tne nature of thecase and the character of the law inquestion. Temperance is a virtue thatcannot be impaired by law. Likelove, it cannot be promoted by force.When it comes to binding love aspider's web is as potent as a triplechain of steel.Law may forbid a thing that iswrong, per se, but it cannot prevent-"c auuoc ui it guuu tiling.There are only two remedies foiintemperance: Moderation and totalabstinence. Euch belongs to therealm of personal liberty. Neithercan become personal virtues unlessself-imposed and self-enforced.You can take man away fromliquor, but you cannot take liquoraway trom man.A law designed to prevent a manfrom drinking requires constant repression for its enforcement. Beforesuch a law could become a remedyfor intemperance it would be necessary to establish an absolute des-uotism .upon the ruins . of liberty.With a bayonet at .every man'sbreast we would make a fine exhlbitiqn on the Fourth -of July singing:!'My Country, 'Tis of Thee, SweetLand of Liberty."To enforce such a law you wouldneed one man to stand over anotherwith .a. club all the ,time. It wouUalso be necessary o have' a third"watch thef other two, ,f orVJfS anybodylaid rdovnaclub somebody -would get; In eloiu the legitimate sAloon you jconvert the oeer drinker into a wbhvky drinker. This is a poor way topromote true, temperance, or save 'thedrunkard.Prohibition in trying to prevent aman from buying a drink makes itpossible for him to buy a drunk. Aglance at the record will convinceevery reasonable person that prohibition wherever tried has utterly failed !to prevent the consumption of liquor.On the other hand, the consumptionhas increased .despite the fact thatin the last sixty years more than 100.000 saloons have been abolished andone-halt the geographical territory ofthe United States placed under prohibitory law.The official records show and Idefy successful contradiction that in1850 when the first great prohibitionmovement started, the annual percapita consumption of alcoholicbeverages in the United States wasa fraction less than four gallons.Ten yars later it had risen to nearlysix and one-half gallons. This encouraged the drys, and they made adesperate struggle "for ten yearsmore. At the end of that time theconsumption increased to seven andthree-quarter gallon?. Of course, thisaroused still greater enthusiasmamong prohibition workers, and in1880 consumption ' reached ten gallons per capita. Inspired by theirwonderful progress prohibitionistsredoubled their diligence, and, notwithstanding they abolished thousands of saloons, the consumption ofliquor ten years later had increasedto fifteen and one-half gallons.About this time the drys organizedthe Anti-Saloon League. They enlisted a vast number of preachers andmany churches in their crusade, butdespite the abolition of legitimate saloons the per capita consumption ofalcoholic liquors reached seventeenand one-half gallons in 1900.This seemed to inspire them withboundless zeal, and with one gran.'lonslaught they placed city after city,county after county, State after Statein the dry column. Notwithstandingthis fact the latest internal revenuereport shows that, instead of consuming four gallons per capita, as in1850 when prohibitionists started tosave us from the demon rum, we arenow consuming twenty-four gallonsper ..capita.Prohibitionists by making one-halfthe geographical territory of the United States dry have increased the cjnsumption of liquor from four totwenty-four gallons per capita. GreatGod! Now, if the drys can provethat the more a man drinks the lessapt is he to become intoxicated theycan show that prohibition is a remedy for intemperance. If they sucseed in demonstrating that proposition I agree to prove that the less aman drinks the more drunken he becomes. While prohibition cannot promotetemperance, it does breed sneaks,liars, hypocrites, perjurers and pettycriminals any one of which is agreater menace to manhood, a greatermenace to morality than the worstsaloon that ever existed.We oppose; prohibition not ouly because it is a failure, but because intrying to suppress one vice by forceyou create five others more deadlythan the one you would destroy.We have already shown that prohibition is wrong in principle. Thisis true whether applied to one hundred people or one hundred million.When a thing is fundamentally andmorrally wrong even success can notmake it right.A Menace tothe Church.Prohibition it not only powerlessas a remedy for intemperance, it isalso a menace to the church to truereligion.The Federal census reports showthat in wet New York 43 per cent ofthe people belong to church. In wetRhode Island 54 per cent of the people belong to church. In prohibitionMaine less than 30 per cent of thepeople are church members, and indry Kansas less than 29 per cent areaffiliated with any church. In thenorthern group of States, to whichKansas and Maine belong, the average percentage of church membersnip' is 44.The reason for this condition inprohibition States is apparent to allwho think. JMen naturally resent the efforts ofministers to interfere with their private affairs.They refuse to go to church tohear a prohibition harangue insteadof a gospel sermon.They decline to support a ministerwho appeals to the law of force instead of the power of love.They know that every preacherwho calls upon the police to save mendiscredits the religion of JesusChrist.;.The spirit of intolerance manifested by advocates of prohibition drivespeople away from the church. Frequently the members are told by thepastors to vote dry or resign, theirmembership. Unable to convince menby reason that prohibition is right thedrys frequently resort to the socialor business thumb screw to compelothers to accept their views. Peoplewho honestly differ with them are denounced as children of hell.It is such actions "as these thatdrive men away from the church,away from God and Christ, and accounts for the fact that in prohibitionMaine and Kansas people hafe lessuse for the church than in any otherStates in the Union.Christians should oppose prohibittion not because they are particularlyinterested in the perpetuity of theliquor business, but because prohibition wherever tried has not only failed to help, but has invariably injuredthe cause of true religion. The opposition may attempt to belittle ourconcern for the church, but they mustremember that a majority of all thepeople who profess to be Christiansare now and always have been opposed to prohibition.Un-Chr'stiah .fn Character. ., Av Prohibition ot only a,efiace-.tbtrue religion, but It isWaferasy to tbidivine prdjf.

Before your songs and prayerscan be anything but hollow mockerythey must come through free lipsfrom willing hearts. God could writea message to-night across the sky inletters of fire, and the whole humanrace would fall on its knees. Thatwouia put an the ministers out ofbusiness in a jiffy, It is not God'sway. He might kill the devil, but Hedoesn't.Theologians have been telling usfor nearly two thousand years that"God made man able to stand, thou0!'free to fall." Did they tell us thetruth? If not, how can we believethem now? We know that they toldthe truth, because the doctrine ofpersonal liberty is in harmony withthe divine order.I now call your attention to theBible, accepted by all Christians asthe revealed willof God. I shall giveyou a few passages which will showthe position of the Deity on the question of using intoxicating liquors.- In Genesis, 14th chapter, 18 th versewe read:"And Melchizedek, King of Salem,brought forth bread and wine; anaLhe was the priest of the Most HighGod."Strange that the Most High Goddid not inform His priest that it waswrong to set wine an intoxicatingdrink before his guests.In Numbers, 15th chapter, lOtLveise, we read:"Thou shalt bring for a drink offering a hin of wine for an offering madeby "fire, of a sweet savor unto theLord."From this we learn that intoxicating wine as an offering was not onlyacceptable, but pleasing to God.In the 9th chapter of Judges, and13th verse, we read:"And the vine said unto them,should I leave my wine whichcheereth God and man, and go -to bepromoted over the tree?"If the use of wine is wrong hocould an evil thing be pleasing toGod?In the 9th chapter of Ecclesiastes.7th vers.e, we learn that as a rewardfor their devotion and loyalty Godgave His people the right to drink.It says:, "Go thy way, eat thy bread withjoy, and drink thy wine with a merryheart, for God now accepteth thvworks."Intead of abolishing personal liberty God here grants His people theright to drink as a reward for righteousness. in isaian, cnapter bz, verse s, Atmighty God solemnly pledges Hunself to protect His people in theirright to drink the wine for whichthey labor. This verse reads:"The Lord hath sworn by His righthand, and by the arm of His strength,surely I will no more give thy cornto be meat for the enemies; and th-sons of the stranger shall not drincthy wine for which thou hath labored." We see by this passage that afterall this conflict is a fight betwefiprohibitionists and God.The prohibitionists swear by Hoyson and Bill Sunday that the use ofintoxicating liquors shall be abolished. God has sworn by his righthand and by the arm of His strength"that no man nor set of men will d3prive His people of personal libertyon the drink question.I shall now proceed to show by tl&example of Christ that prohibitionis is un-Christian in character.In the 7th chapter of Luke, 33d and34th verses, Jesus contrasts Hirfhabits with the habits of John theBaptist. He says:"John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and y-3-sayhe hath a devil."The Son of Man is come eatingand drinking and ye say behold agluttonous man, a winebibber, afriend of publicans and sinners."The drys may deny that Jesusmeant to say that He drank whatJohn did not drink. But unless thislanguage means that John was ateettotalar and that Jesus was a temperate drinker of intoxicating wineit means absolutely nothing. Somuch for the example set by the idealmoral character of all ages.Every man who holds -that it ismorally wrong to use wine discreditsChrist. It never can be Christian toprohibit a thing that Jesus did. ButJesus not only drank wine, but madeit for others to drink.In the second chapter of St. Johawe have the story of Christ's firstmiracle. The host at the wedding'feast of Cana provided wine for hisguests, but the supply gave out before the feast ended. There arosea demand for more wine. The saintedMother of Christ called his attentionto this demand.There has never been on this eartha more appropriate opportunity formaking a prohibition speech. Confronted by this demand, had prohibition been a Christian priciple Jesuswould have condemned the host forproviding the wine m the first place.Had prohibition been In harmonywith the divine order Jesus wouldhave reproved the guests for drinking. This is what any prohibitionistwould have done, which shows howthey and Christ differ on this question. What was the answer of theSon of "God to the demand for an intoxicating beverage? He convertedwater into wine to supply the demand. Had He been a prohibitionistHe would have converted the wineinto water at the beginning of thefeast instead of converting waterinto wine at the end of the feast;Nobody denies but what He performed, a miracle to supply this demand, but prohibitionists tell you.that the wine He made wag not intoxicating. , ," Fortunately there was a witmeesresent that nobody could fool!grape-Juice. -Tn order' to determine -wlnot the wine Jean made wia1toaune an rvsst rjrvrV. t -r"i: .

Page 6)eating it is necessary -co learn whatkind of wine the guests wanted. Unless He perpetrated a fraud Jesussupplied the kind they wanted, andnot some substitute.In the .ninth verse we read:"When the ruler of the feast tastedthe water that made wine, and knewnot whence it was (but the servantsthat drew the water knew), the governor of the feast called the bridegroom."From this '-we learn that the rulerof the feast was not aware that amiracle had been performed. Hethought the supply had been securedfrom a regular dealer around the corner. His testimony was, therefore,free from prejudice or bias. Now,why did he call the bridegroom?Something out of the ordinary hadhappened.In verse 10 we are told that he saidto the bridegroom:"Every man at the beginning dothset forth good wine; and when menhave well drunk, then that which isworse; but thou hast kept the goodwine until now."Now we know what kind of winethe guests had at the beginning. Itwas good wine. This good wine gaveout, and, of course, they wanted moreof the same land. The good winewas the old intoxicating wine.This is shown in the next sentenceuttered by the ruler of the feast.After stating that it was customaryto set forth good wine at the beginning of the feast he said:"When men have well drunk, thenthat which is worse, but thou hastkept the good wine until now."From this we learn that the goodwine always set forth at the beginning of feasts would make mendrunk. Otherwise it would not benecessary, in order to prevent a debauch, to switch to the wine "whichis worse," or weak. Besides theexpression "have well drunk" in theoriginal reads "becomes thoroughlyintoxicated." In the German Bible itris translated "drunk through and'through." If the good wine set beforeguests at the beginning of feastswould intoxicate when drank to excess, so would the wine Jesus made,for the ruler of the feast said: "Thouhas kept the good wine until now." Ichallenge any man living to showthat the good wine was not old winethe intoxicating kind. I defy him,to prove that the guests wantedgrape juice.rms is tue plain, simple meaningof the text. I have made no effortto twist, distort or wrest any termfrom its manifest import. As Jesusused wine and made it for others todrink, prohibition can never be Christian in character.I do not say that He debauched thewedding feast. I do not claim thatthe guests got drunk on the goodwine. The ruler of the feast suggested the possibility, but does not averthat such happened on this occasion.I give you the record as it is.I deny that Jesus supplied a demand for intoxicating liquor to makemen drunk. I deny that when wevote to supply the demand for intoxicating liquors that we vote tomaiie men urunKarus. mere is avast difference between drinking andgetting drunk thci same differenceas there is between eating' and becoming a glutton; between buying agun and committing murder.Having settled forever by the example of Christ the true Christianattitude on the liquor question, I defyany man on earth to show how it canever become Christian to prohibitanything that Jesus practiced.In Deuteronomy, 14th chapter, 26thverse, God says:"And thou shalt bestow that moneyfor whatsoever thy sould lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or forwine, or for strong drink."It will be seen in this instancethat God became specific. He knewthe controversy that would arise, thestrife tins issue would engender.Hence in taking His position in favorof personal liberty on the drink question God made His meaning perfectlyclear. It God permits us to spend ourmoney for strong drink, who has theright to forbid?If God would permit His people tospend their money for strong drink,and then damn them for doing it, Hewould be a monster.I deny that GouV is a monster andin His defense brand prohibition as apolitical, legal, religious and moralmonstrosity.Prohibitionists have assumed a position on the drink question that indicts God as a monster and Qhrist asa criminal. I stand ready to defendChrist and God against their indictment and for this they denounce meas a blasphemer. I would rather discredit the opinion of every prohibitionist on this earth than to brandGod as a monster and Christ as acriminal the one for permitting Hispeople to spend their money forstorng drink, the other for perfom-mg a miracle to supply the demandfor intoxicating liquor.You cannot find within the lids ofthe Bible a single passage rightly in- 'terpeted that supports the principleof prohibition. If you could find apassage showing that it was wrong tospend your money for strong drinkmorally wrong to use liquor criminalto supply the demand, you would absolutely destroy the respect of mankind for God, for the Bible and forChrist.The Christian Bible is emphatically, and eternally opposed to prohibition as a principle. But I havehere another Bible, held to be sacredby hundreds of millions of people. Onpage 129 of this book we read:"O true believers, surely wine is anabomination of the works of Satan."This is the Mohammedan Biblethe Koran. Maliomet was a prohibitionist. Prohibition is a cardinal doctrine of the Mohammedan religion.Notwithstanding this fact the Turksare the most criminal, poverty-ridden-nation on this earth. The quotationirom the Koran sounds like a prohibi-tion speech. Drys will find it impos-sibl to (HvorJe thetr armfcani ft$mthis Mohammedan XetL Thfc jfoliiumedan gospel , runs through fif prohibitlon sermons, whetttaf preachedby Mohammedan 'priest or Christianministers. It is tti sum and shH-stance, the heart an& soul of theirphilosophy.By the Koran I have establishedtht fact that prohibition is Mohammedan in 'character; not Christian.With the Holy Bible I have clinchedmy affiirmation that prohibition iswrong in principle and un-Christanin character. Take your choice between the Bible and the Koran, between Christ and Mahommet. Jesusdrank wine and made it for othersto drink. The Koran declares that"wine is a abomination of the worksof Satan." Mahommet was a nrohi-bitionist; Christ was not.I have now shown by irrefutablelogic, unanswerable reason, officialrecords, and the sacred scripturesthat the prohibition of the manufacture and use of intoxicating liquors iswrong in principle, un-Christian incharacter, and powerless as a remedy for intemperance. I have demonstrated that prohibition is:Contrary to reason, opposed to nature, an insult to intelligence, de-jstructive of human equality, a menace to manhood, based upon a falsepremise, an immoral proposition, ablow at the basis of all morality,inimical to true religion, powerlessas a remedy for intemperance, antagonistic to the divine order, andthat in principle temperance and prohibition are eternal opposites.No man ever brought a more sweeping indictment aganst any cause thanI have brought against prohibition tonight. My charges will stand becausethey are true. They cannot be overthrown. When an argument is unanswerableyour opponents may do one of threethings. When unfair or dishonest,they resort to personalities. Whatthey lack in logic they make up bypersonal abuse of the speaker. Unable to refute his- argument theyseek to injure his character or reputation, and end by saying that hemade votes for their side.When they are wise, they either assert that you said nothing worthy ofconsideration, or they ignore you entirely. But if they are "otherwise,"they will expose the weaknesfe ,ofitheir cause by trying to demolishtruth, a thing impossible. I shall callattention briefly to some of the arguments advanced by these people.In reply to my charge that prohibition is contrary to reason, you willhear them say:"Then why prohibit theft and murder?" Because murder is wrong per se.You do not have to repeat the act ofmurder in order to become a murderer. Drinking becomes evil onlyby abuse. Besides, killing is everybody's business, but when you drinkit is nobody's business but yours. Alaw that concerns everybody can beenforced, but you cannot enforce itwhen it is nobody's business butyours. That is the moral differencebetween taking a drink and committing murder.These pople appear to be unable tosee the moral distinction betweenasking a man to have a friendlydrink and cutting his throat.I proved that prohibition is opposedto nature, and that the thing thatmakes prohibition ' a failure makesman a success, and some of the drysanswer drunkenness is wrong. As Ido not advocate drunkenness, nothingthey can say on tha,t propositionmeets my argument.I proved prohibition to be a menaceto the development, of true manhood.In reply you will be .told that somepeople who drink are poor. They willnot tell you why an equal number ofpeople are poor who do not drink.I denounce prohibition as an immoral proposition. For answer youwill be told that Windle was formerlya prohibitionist. St. Paul was aPharisee at one time in his life. Anyman who opens his mouth before heopens his mind is liable to become aprohibitionist.I proved that prohibition strikes ablow at the basis of all morality.,Some of our opponents answer bycharging that some liquor men areimmoral. So are some preachers, butthat is no argument against thechurch, nor is it a sane reason whyany man should condemn goodpreachers.I proved prohibition to be a menaceto the church. Some of my opponents will attempt to ridicule ourconcern for the church, forgettingthat there .has never been a Prohibition Christian nation on this earth.I proved by the records that prohibition has utterly failed to stopdrunkenness, and in order to meet myargument, it will be necessary toshow that more liquor we drink theless liable Ave are to become drunk.When they sustain this contention inthe Court or Reason, I ngree to proveby the same kind of logic that theless a man drinks the more drunkenhe becomes.I proved by the Bible, the specificpermission of God and the example ofChrist that prohibition is not only unChristian in character, but antagonistic to the divine order. In their fu-tile ettort to retute my contention myopponents will attempt to distortand twist certain Biblical quotatonsBut if you will stop to think you mustrealize that no passage rightly interpreted can be found in the Bible thatwould brand God as a monster byprohibiting a thing which he expressly permits, or that would convictJesus of crime for drinking or makingan intoxicant for others to drink.Plenty of things in the Bible favorable to temperance, but not a line forprohibition.Where the Bible mentions wine,whether it commands its use or condemns its abuse, the Hebrew word is"yayin," the equivalent for the Greekword, "oinos," which according to thehighest authorities on Biblical literature means the fermented juice ofgrapes.The Dictionary of Religious Knowledge and Gazetteer by Rev. S. M.Jackson, D. D., L.L. D., page 974says:"The Hebrew 'yayin' and its equivalent 'oinos? are general terms for allsorts of wine, that is. the fermentedjuice of grapes."The New Schac-Herzog Encyclopae-'t''- t v, W - Aw" -... z- '&12. par ?2; say a:"The universal Ueaignfcton for Mm-mented mpe juice is 'yajta,'spending to the Oreo trardand the -Latin Tfinuft:'"In all the passage I read tofrom the Bible, where, iritt 4mtioned, the original word is 'jjfl4f"oinos" and "shekhar," the lattermeaning strong drink made from $,thing other than grapes.Some times men who pretend .4 Hscholars will tell you that theHebrew word "shekhar" ti"strong drink," really means auiOn page 1913 of volume 16 ofClintock & Strong's Encyclopedia mBiblical and Theological Literatawl,we find that this high authority declares: "A vain attempt has been read eftconnecting the word (shekhar)logically with sugar, to prove iniace or the clearest facts to thetrary that it was a sweet non-in&eateating syrup."The Jewish Encyclopedia, wrftteexby 600 Hebrew scholars and publishedby Funk & Wagnalls, dispels all nytrtery as to the meaning of the tene l1"yayin" or the roct word from whielfcit sprung. On pages 532 and S3J efvolume 12 we are informed that"yayin" means "matured or fermeeed wine," That "shekhar" meeaa,"old powerful red wine," or strengrdrink. Also that in Rabbinical literature wine is called "yayin" not Because it is a pulpy mass, but becaaewhen drunk to excess it brings e .mentations and wailings."That is the meaning of the rootword. In volume 10, page 1011, atMcClintock & Strong's Encyclopediaof Biblical and Theological literature, we find this statement:"Yayin" means fermented grapejuice. In no passage can it be positively shown to have any other meaning. The same is true of its equiva-lent congeners Greek "oinos," Latin."vinum."The highest authorities completelyconfound and refute my critics whoseek to make you believe that I nave-misrepresented the plain meaning" otscripture on the question of drink.In their comment on the passagewhere St. Paul says that a "deacon,should not be given too much wine .McClintock & Strong in their Ifecyclopaedia of Biblical and TheologicaLLiterature, volume 10, page 191C,say;."The Bible makes no distinction,between intoxicating and non-intoxicatingwine. If the wine referred to-'were not intoxicating the apoetlemight as well have exhorted themagainst drinking too much milk orwater. He takes for granted the rigktto use, he recognizes the danger incident to use, but instead of prohib- 'iting, he cautions and exhorts against:excess. Moderation in eating anddrinking is the broad Christian lanr."On the question of prohibition the-Anti-SaloonLeague stands with Tatian, the man who founded the firstprohibition sect in the second century. His followers were called"Enkratites." Dr. John Henry Bluntin his Dictionary of Heresies, Sectsand Schools of Thought? on page 591,says:"Tatian condemns wine as the manufacture of the Devil."He was denounced as the incarnation of all heresies by St. Clement,St. Ireneus and St. Cyprian.On page 144, Dr. Blunt quotes Apostolic Canon 51, issued by the earlyChristian church against the prohibition heresy of Tatian and his followers. The canon reads:"If any bishop, priest, deacon orlayman abstain from wine out of abhorance, as having forgotten that allVthings are very good, let him amendor else be desposed and cast out of;the church."To-day an effort is being made toreverse the position taken by theprimitive church and expel men wharefuse to accept the prohibition heresy of Tatian. Which is more apt tobe in harmony with the divine order,,the earthly Fathers of the church whotouched hands with the disciples ofChrist, or some modern politicalpreacher? Mohammet agreed withTatian that wine is abomination ofthe works of Satan. Both were in.conflict with the opinion, precept andexample of Christ. Christ stood forthe force of law the sword.Now, my friends, in conclusion, Iwant to talk to you a little whileabout liberty. I am opposed to prohibition because it is opposed to libertyWhen you pronounce the word liberty, the birds sing, the flowers bloom,the sun shines and the rivers runlaughin to the sea.Pronounce the word prohibitionand you hear the clank of chains,the clang of prison doors, and the cryof the oppressed. It would be impossible for me to tell you all the things .that liberty has done for mankind..Human speeches contains many braveand beautiful words. Wife, love,mother, home and liberty are wordsaround which cluster pearls of joywords that breathe a tender sentiment that lift mankind from the sordid things of earth to the noble and'sublime. But without liberty love is:a mockery and the home becomes aprison in which wife and other lose;half their charms.Liberty breathed upon Leonidas aThermopylae and he wrote his name. ,.among the stars. She smiled upon.Miltiades on the plains of Marathon. .and the Persian hosts of oppression:fled before his uashing sword likewithered leaves; she stood by thcamp fires of Washington at ValleyForge and a new nation was horn in.a day; she kissed the lips of Patrick:Henry and he uttered words that will -liveuntil languages are dead and lipsare dust. She grasped the hand otTAbraham Lincoln and ha struck theshackles from the bruised and bleed-"ing limbs of 4,000,000 slaves. Libertybroke the bonds that had bound thebrave of all ages, and' Progress, Phoenix-like,arose from her ashes atblasted hopes and bathed her glittering wings in the nonday sun.Search the history of the world andyou will find that progress never topka forward step without liberty wasimprisoned.
