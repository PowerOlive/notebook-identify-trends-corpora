Aatoist Has Narrow Escape.
Dr. William Kenney, the popular
Paris physician, had a very narrow
escape a few nights ago, while out
driving m his motor car, at the hands
of an irate faitxier, who was in the act
of letting him have the contents of a
double-barrel shotgun. y

chine blew out.with a tremendous re
port, (you know Kenney never does
anything by, ha Ives) arousing half the
neighborhood. Squire Keller and his
.family included, .and forcing him to
bring his machine to an abrupt stop.
Thinking perhaps some tourist had
fired upon his watch dog, which was
making considerable noise in the yard.
Squire Keller rolled out of bed grab
bed his shotgun and made his way to
the road where he challenged the
owner of the disabled auto, demanding
to know why he had fired upon his dog
which was in the inclosilre.
The situation was rathar embarrass
ing for Dr. Kenney, who in the face of
the gun and in almost total darkness
hastily explained the cause of the ac
cident, revealed his identity and ap
pealed for aid. Squire Keller and Dr.
Kenney being great friends, the for
mer made profound apologieB. Going
to the house he procured lanterns and
returning with the entire family to
the scene of the accident rendered val
uable assistance in repairing the dam-
