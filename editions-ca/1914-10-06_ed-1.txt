Evangelist Ham preached a special sermon." The buildingfcaJ been decorated by a committeeunder the direction of Miss EllenHenry. Songs and cheers were givenunder the direction of Prof. Proctor,while the . High School band, underthe leadership of Prof. Prentice Lancaster, rendered a selection of instrumental music.The way to the Tabernacle is nowpointed out by a big electric crossover the main entrance.Saturday night a large crowd gathered in front of the Court House,frora where, after singing of hynms,they marched to the TabernaclelieaJed by the Paris High SchoolBand. At the Tabernacle appropriatesenices were held.Smday morning Evangelist Hamaddressed a big audience, taking assubject, "Separation." In the after-no-he spoke to an audience of menonly on "Tests of Manhood." At theevening service the house was filledto iverfiowing, 'with a crowd that1 e?d the Evangelist preach on thesuij.-ct of "The Judgment."(."a account of yesterday beingCc"uty Court Day, no meetings wereheld.Special nights will be set aside forthe fraternal organizations, whichjliai1 been invited to attend in abody.In order to furnish protection forthe audience against inclementwether, the Tabernacle has beenin- with heavy building paper, insures comfort and warmth.Interest in the meetings continuesto -row and the big building canhardly hold the crowds that attend.The business men of Millersburgwill be asked to close their storesfrom 3 p. m. to 4 p. m. on Wednesdayafternoon. The services will be conducted at 3 p. m. in the MethodistChurch. Evangelist Ham will preach,Chorister Ramsey will sing and Mr.Matthews play.Te record of attendance up todate show the total of 48,200, withcollections totaling $618.37. And theend is not yet.Crowds of men and women fromall over the county" have been atten-ling the services and the capacityof te Tabernacle has been sorelytaxed.An open field near the, 'site hasbeen secured for the accommodationof c runty visitors and abundant roomwill be provided for all kinds of vehicles. Sd many inquiries have been madeas :o when the Ham-Ramsey meetings would close that it was announced from the rostrum during theSunday afternoon meeting that theevangelists would remain until about.7jmr?rv l. or until they had "succeeded in -driving the devil fromParis." They stated in effect thatthey did not intend to be drivenaway by either bad weather or unfair criticisms; that they had a tonof coal stored away, and the Tabernacle had been made perfectly comfortable and secure against any possible sudden changes of weather;that Paris people would see a moreaggressive plan of campaign especially suited to local conditions, andthat it would not stop until they haddrr.en the devil and all his associates far beyond the confines of Bourbon County.State Chairman Thomas S. Rheahas selected Mr. William G. McClintock, of Paris, to fill the importantposition of Democratic Chairman ofBourbon County during the comingelection, and he will shortly selectan active campaign committee withrepresentation from every precinct ofthe county, and begin an energeticcampaign in behalf of the Democraticticket this fall.It must be remembered that a voteagainst the Democratic nominees isa repudiation of the brilliant administration of President Woodrow Wilson. A number of United States Senators are to be chosen in severalStates and Kentucky has the privilegeof selecting two. Upon these selections may depend the success orfailure of the Democratic administration at Washington, hence everyDemocrat in the State is charged witha greater responsibility than ever before. We feel sure that the Democrats ofKentucky, and of Bourbon County,will acquit themselves like men bygiving the Democratic candidates thegreatest majority ever received, andit is the purpose of Chairman McQlintock, to wage an intelligentthorough and vigorous campaign inorder that Bourbon County may doits full share in securing the desiredresult in the State.STREETRESURFACING COMPLETED.FRANKLIN COURT REVERSED.The judgment of the Franklin Circuit Court in the case of H. M. Boswortli vs. George Batterton, CountyAttorney of Bourbon County, was reversed bv the Court of Appeals lastTuesday. ,Mr. Batterton, as County Attorneyof Bourbon County, prosecuted thecase of the Sheriff of Bourbon County against Laura Belle Judy's administrator to recover inheritance tax.ue the State. The Commonwealthrecovered a judgment of $28.75. Batterton filed suit in the Franklin Circuit Court against Auditor Bosworthto obtain a mandamus requiring nunto issue a warrant in favor of Batterton for $4.31, being fifteen per cent,of the amount of tax collected. Thelower court awarded the mandamus.The Appellate Court says the questionto be decided in the case is whether aCounty Attorney is entitled to 15 percent, of the tax. The Court held thatit is part of the County Attorney'sduty to prosecute these cases.JURY DISAGREES.That the contractors in charge ofthe resurfacing of Main Street havemade an excellent job and havre alsomade unusually good time in finishing, considering the many delays towhich they were subjected in thestart, is the universal verdict of thepeople of Paris.The street was practically finishedSaturday night, when the big steamroller put the concluding touches onthe bitulithic near the store of Bramblette & Tarr,, Third Street, betweenPleasant and Main, was also resurfoced, the expense being divided between the merchants and businessmen of that vicinity and the city ofParis.The new street was thoroughlytested out Sunday by scores of automobiles and pronounced "perfectlysplendid" by all. The tendency nowwill be to exceed the speed limit.The temptation to "burn the wind" onthe new surface wilbbe very hard toresist, and the police will have plenty to do in warning and restrainingthe ambitious speeders.The working force was busy yesterday in cleaning off the surface of thenew street for the inspection of thecity officials. The machinery and material was shipped last night to Parrogo, Ark., where the firm has a bigcontract of the same kind of pavingto put in. -Superintendent Barnett speaks inthe highest terms of praise of theParis people and the considerationshown him and his work during hisstay here.iviitcnen ck DiaKemoresftWW.-..

The Germansdemanded the surrender of Antwerp.The demand has been refused.A dispatch to the Evening Newsfrom Antwerp says that the Germanattack on Antwerp continued throughout last night with little interruption.The Belgian forts replied so effectively, it is reported, that the Germans several times were compelledto change the position of their batteries. AUSTRIA PAYS ITALY ONE MILLION INDEMNITY.ROME, October 2. Officially deploring the sinking of Italian shipsby Austrian mines in the Adriatic,the Austrian Government has agreedto an immediate payment of an indemnity of $1,000,000 to the familiesof the 17 victims of the disaster.This incident is now officially closed,it is announced.Austria's action on Italy's energetic protest against the mining ofthe Adriatic has apparently removedwhat seemed to be a casus belli onthe part of Italy. The sinking of twoItalian fishing boats and the reportedsinking of an Italian torpedo boat byAustrian mines had greatly inflamedpublic opinion.Italy, it is announced, will reclaimits former provinces and reacquirethe coasts colonized and Italianizedby Venice, and will thus safeguardits own national rights upon the Adriatic. QUESTION OF INTERNATIONALLAW.WASHINGTON, Oct. 2. A gravequestion of international law wasraised in Washington Thursday. Itconcerns the shipment yesterday ofthe hydroaeroplane, America, andtwo sister craft to England to beused for military purposes., A protest is expected to be made byGermany. If the. machines are classed as munitions of war, the aeroplanes would merely be subject toseizure as contraband, but if classedas warships, the United States mightbe held to be responsible for allowing tneir departure irom a neutralport.An understanding about the shipment of foodstuffs and raw materialto neutral European countries maysoon be reached between the UnitedStates and Great Britain: Conferences are being held in Washingtonand London and in a few days anagreement is expected by which products shipped between the UnitedStates and foreign countries, bothneutral and belligerent, may be transported without interference fromBritish and French warships.There are many phases of this subject requiring separate examinationand treatment, and the State Department regards each one disposed of asa step toward a final comprehensiveunderstanding that will prevent anyfriction arising during the continuance of the European war.HINDU TROOPS IN FRANCE.PARIS, Oct. 2. Seventy thousandHindu troops have re-enforced thethe allied army and are taking partin the decisive phase of the greatbattle of the Aisne. Although thesetroops arrived on Tuesday, it was notuntil to-day that the censor wouldallow the fact to be made known.The 70,000 Hindu soldiers who werebrought into the war zone throughthe port of Marseilles, comprise theflower of the forces of the BritishEmpire's great colonial possession.The French and British are keeping up vigorous offensive movementson both flanks, the arrival of freshtroops enabling them to relieve someof the men who had been under firemost of the time since the engagement began on September 12.Although the German soldiers arelijcttiiug uuuiiLtjr iixiauKs along theline, the extreme exhaustion of theinvaders is shown by lack of thevigor which characterized their earlier offensive movements.It is reported that Gen. von Kluckhas been forced to order the retirement of a heavy section of his armybecause of the physical inability ofthe soldiers to meet the violent asWwsGERMANS ASSEMBLING ON RUSSIAN BORDER.ROME, (via Paris, Oct. 2) According to dispatches reaching here allBohemian and Moravian railroads arecongested with German troops andwar material which- is being transported to the Russian border. Germany is making a supreme effort toface the Russian advance and all civilian transport has been forbidden.Vienna dipatches say the Austrianstaff is entirely dependent upon thatof Germany, which has assumed supreme command in the campaignagainst Russia.STARVATION THREATENS BRUSSELS. LONDON, Oct. 2. Seven hundredthousand persons in Brussels are facing starvation, according to HughGibson, the Secretary of the American Embassy there, who is now inthis city.The supply of flour in the Belgiancapital will be exhausted to-day andother staples are virtually all consumed. The latest apportionment offlour to the citizens of Brussels willbe given out this afternoon.Efforts to get food in from Antwerrhave failed. Inasmuch as Brusselsis in charge of the Germans, it is ineffect German territory. Neutral nations could not undertake to supplyfood to Brussels, even if transportation facilities were not practicallycut off because of military operations. CONFIDENT OF PEACE.WASHINGTON, Oct. 2. Unofficialreports reaching the Administrationfrom Constitutionalists sources hereconveyed further assurances that permanent peace soon would be restoredin Mexico through the designation ofFernando Iglesias Calderon as Provisional President pending an election.No official word from Mexico Cityconcerning the convention which wascalled to meet Thursday to promulgate plans for a general election, orfrom the peace conference betweenCarranza and Villa representatives atZacatecas and Aguacallentes, was received by the State DepartmentThursday.Both President Wilson and Secretary Bryan said, however, the outlook for a peaceful settlement of thedifferences between the factions inMexico wac "veVy hopeful' Otherofficials said they confidently expected the peace conference to be successful.

Edwards.Was the Farthest Western OutpostDuring the Second War WithGreat Britain CommandsView of Mississippi.Warsaw, Illinois. Historic days ofa century ago have been honored atWarsaw, Illinois, in the erection thereof a monument in commemoration ofFort Edwards, the farthest westernoutpost during the second war withGreat Britain. In 1814 Zachary Taylor, then a major in the United Statesarmy, selected the high bluffs overlooking the Mississippi river at Warsaw as the most advantageous pointavailable for a frontier stockade,commanding as they did a sweepingview for miles to north and west.Today the point where the monumentstands is said to afford the most beautiful river view along 'the Mississippi.On September 29 and 30 and October1 the monument will be dedicated bythe state of Illinois in connectionwith a centennial jubilee, and theprincipal speakers at that time willbe Governor Edward F. Dunne and therepresentatives of the state in congress. For ten years after its erection FortEdwards was the headquarters ofUnited States troops. It was of particular value to the government indealing with the Indians, among whomEnglish agents continually were endeavoring to create trouble. At thattime the protection of settlers in thatregion was not concerning the govern-Fort Edwards Monument at Warsaw.ment in that they had not begun toarrive. Not long after the fort wasbuilt, though, people working towardthe West began to locate in the neighborhood of Fort Edwards, and foryears it housed many facilies whotook advantage of its shelter untilthey were able to secure locations oftheir own.In Zachary Taylor's time the regionwas heavily wooded. Directly acrossthe Mississippi is the boundary linebetween Iowa and Missouri. At thattime all of Iowa was in the Sac andFox Indian reservation, and eachspring, after the ice went out, the Indians came down the Des Moinesriver, which empties into tho Mississippi across from Warsaw, and theremet traders from St. Louis. That initself was one reason for Zachary Taylor's selection of the Illinois bluffs atWarsaw as a point of vantage forFort Edwards.Gradually civilization changed the town, renewed his subscription andnature of the country, but the years .got a copy of all the missing numhave not lessened the grandeur of its ; bers since his paper had been stopriver scenes. Progress has marked the ' ped, and when he arrived home therepoints where the red men met thetraders from the south. Today fromFort Edwards point the great Keokukpower dam may be seen one mile tothe north as a njonument ,te the advance oi a once desolate region.Fort Edwards was named after thefirst governor of Illinois, Ninian W.Edwards.

I remember whenI was a small boy, that was nearlyfifty years ago, a very wealthymanin our city came driving along towarda high overhead railroad bridge. Iwas playing with some companionsof mine on the bridge.I cannot exactly remember why itwas done, but I fished a penny out ofmy pocket and was showing it to myboy companions when it slippedthrough my fingers and dropped to thepavement below. The wealthy oldman drove up, and to all appearanceshe was in deep thought with his headburied upon his chest.He saw my penny, however, deliberately stopped his horse, getting outof his carriage, picked up that penny,pocketed it, and returning to kis wagon drove off as if nothing had everhappened.There was a sad heart pulsing overhis head, I can tell you, for a penny inthose days was as big as a dime isto a boy today, and I felt the lossof- it keenly. That man was a multimillionaire, and by just such littlethings as that was how he was constantly accumulating more all o thetime.The average boy of today does nottake advantage of his opportunitiesto make and to save. There seem tobe too many forms of tempta'tionthrown in his way to rid him of hisextra dimes and nickels, wrhen if theywere saved and deposited in somesavings institution a startling resultwould be achieved in a few years.Portland Express and Advertiser.DRAMA FOUND IN EVERYTHINGBargains in All Departments.T"W"ixiBrosClothing and Shoe Department.L.

Head.Washingtpn Gardner, Commander-in-Chief,Makes Plea That It Be KeptHonored by All as AmericanNational Anthem.Detroit. A plea for the perpetuation of "The Staf-Spangled Banner" asthe American anthem, without alloy,was made fervently by WashingtonGardner, commander-in-chief of theGrand 4rmy of the Republic, in hisaddress before the forty-eighth national encampment of that organization here.He urged the old soldiers to join ina movement to pay special honor tothis song, and to discountenance thepractice of playing it in medley withsuch "flippant and comparativelymeaningless ditties" as "YankeeDoodle" and "When Johnnie ComesMarching Home."He said there was something inspiring in an audience rising andstanding uncovered at the majesticstrains of the national anthem, but itwas "incongruous, bordering even onthe ludicrous," for the band to strikeup some other national air in medleywith this, and to observe the audienceresume sitting in "an irregular, halfashamed manner." It were better notto rise at all when the national hymnis played in medley, he said.A recommendation that permanentheadquarters for the G. A. R. be established in Washington was anotherpoint of his address. Chicago andPhiladelphia had been proposed, buthe preferred the national capital, andthought that if possible the necessaryspace should be secured in a government building where the officers couldkeep closely in touch with matters before congress which affected theGrand army.A standing committee of seven persons, with the commander-in-chief andadjutant general of the G. A. R. as exofficio members, he also recommendedprincipally for the purpose of takingcharge of all legislation which had theindorsement of the order. He saidthat such a committee would "concentrate responsibility, reduce expenseand give promise of better results."The present membership, in goodstanding, was reported as' 171,335.During the year the roll was curtailedby the death of 11,187 old soldiers,but notwithstanding this large figure,it is 151 less than died during thepreceding year.SEEK AID FOR JOBLESS GIRLSWoman's Department of NationalCivic Federation Ask Employersto Co-Operate.New York.

It is his belief that hecan best provoke the confidence -ofthe American people by steadfastlydoing the work assigned to him, leaving to others the task of meeting inpublic debate partisan misrepresentation and hostile criticism.This, is new doctrine to he pouredinto the ears of the present generation, though It is a doctrine that washeld high in esteem among thestatesmen of an earlier period. Butis it not sound 'doctrine? As thePresident says, the country knows aswell as it can be taught what it isthat has been 'accomplished duringthe past seventeen months of uninterrupted service. The President is content with it and shrinks naturallyfrom boasting about it. He prefersto give his whole thought and attention to matters that are taking shaperapidly, as for example the rebuilding of the merchant marine, and thefurther conservation'4 and economicuse of our diversified natural resources. And finally, as he values a man'sservice by the chaiacter of it, ne believes the country will value theservice of an administration by thecharacter and spirit of its performance. This, too, is uncommon doctrine in this day and generationwhen the spectacle is offered of individuals of ambition employing thetime assigned them for other work,with an adequate compensation, tofurther advance their own personalinterests. If a man is known by thecompany he keeps, a public secvantmay be fairly measured by his devotion to his job.Professional CardsJ. S. Wallingford, M.

Because the Judge of the Bourbon County Court, after the filing ofthe petition and before entering anorder of election thereon did nothear proof that said petition wassigned by a number of legal votersequal to twenty-five per cent, of thevotes cast in Bourbon County at thelast perceding' general 'election.4. Because said petitioners whosenames were signed to said petitiondid not offer any proof that said petition was signed by a number of legalvoters in said County equal to twentyfive per cent, of the votes cast thereinat the last preceding general election. 5. Because the Judge of the Bourbon County Court, at the next regular term thereof, after receiving saidpetition, did not make an order on hisorder book, directing an election to beheld in said county on some datenamed in said petition,. no earlier thansixty days after said application waslodged with the Judge of said Court,directing the Sheriff, or any otherofficer of said County, appointed tohold said election, to open a poll ateach and all voting places in saidCounty, on said .date, for the purposeof taking the sense of the legal votersof said County, who were qualifiedto vote at electrons tor Countyofficers, upon the proposition whetheror not spirituous, vinous or maltliqpor shall be sold, bartered or loaned therein, or whether or not anyprohibition law in force in saidCounty, or in any city, town, precincti or district thereof, by virtue of anygeneral or special act or acts shallI become inoperative.6. Because the order which wasspread upon the order book of theCounty Court, purporting to call saidelection on September 28th, 1914, wasnot signed by the Judge of the Bourbon County Court and is thereforenull an. void, and of no effect.7.

Because the County Board ofElection Commissioners in appointing the election officers to conductsaid registration and said election didnot divide said officers equally asrequired by law, between those favoring .said proposition and those opposing said proposition.10. Because at the special registration which was held in the Cityof Paris on September 18th 1914,legal voters in said City of Paris,who were entitled to registeron said date, and who were entitledto vote at said election, and who applied for permission to register inthe precinct in which they were legally entitled to register and vote, werenot permitted to register and therebywere prevented from voting.11.
