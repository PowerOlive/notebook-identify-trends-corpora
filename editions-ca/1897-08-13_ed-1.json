THE WOODPECKER
Four Characteristics of the Littlo Dram
jjjer of the Woods f
There is an article by Frank IS
Chapman in St Nicholas on The
Little Drummer of the Woods giving
much curious information concerning
the woodpeoker Mr Chapman says
If we had jr woodpecker in our hands
we should see in the beginning that its
bill is not slightly hooked with the
upper mandible turned down at its end
and overlapping the under mandible as
in the crow and other birds that pick
up a living but that both mandibles
are of equal length and cut squarely
off at the tip It is therefore like a
wedge or chisel
Perhaps the tip of the birds tongue
will be seen appearing through its near
ly closed mandibles and our attention
is at once attracted by its peculiar
shape We discover that it is remark
ably long and when fully extended
reaches almost if not quite an inch be
yond the point of the bill It is not
flat like the crows but round and
fleshy and has a sharp horny point
which by looking at it very closely we
see has a series of barbs on both sides
In the meantime our hands have
doubtless been pricked by the birds
tail feathers each feather being stiff
bristly and pointed at the end Some
of the larger woodpeckers the pileated
and ivorybill for instance have this
singular kind of tail feather highly de
veloped The main stem or shaft of the
feather is much larger than usual and
each barb growing from this shaft is
curved downward and inward and is
strong and pointed Comparing this
feather with the flat tail feather of a
crow we see at onco how different it is
in form
The wings do not impress us as in
any way unusual They are neither
very long nor very short but the ar
rangement of the toes is so peculiar
that they were at once commented upon
by a blind girl to whom I had handed
a specimen of one of these birds In
stead of the disposition common to most
birds three tees directed forward and
one backward we discover two front
toes and two hind ones and wo will
note also that each toe is armed- with a
strong curved nail

The last glimmer of

frwilight was
the battle at
JBladensborg two miles distant from
Washington into the well nigh desert

at the head of his band of marauders
writes Clifford Howard in The Ladies5
Home Journal of the invasion and burn
ing of our national capital by the Brit
ish forces under Admiral Cockburn in
August 1814 Elated at their decisive
victory over a force nearly twice as
large as their own and thirsting for
spoils the red coated soldiers marched
triumphantly toward the capitoL Dis
charging theirfirearms afc the window
the soldiers burst in the doors audi with
a shout of triumph carried their leader
to the speakers chair from whicb with
mock gravity he put the question
Shall this harborof the Yankee democ
racy be burned A yell of affirmation
rang through the ball and without fur
ther preliminaries papers and ether
combustibles were piled under the desks
and set on fire Id a few minutes this
noble edifice that had been ia course of
construction more than 20 years and
containing the library of congress and
vast quantities of official documents- of
great historical value was destroyed-
Now thoroughly aroused to their
work of plunder a howling crowd of
the desperate marauders hurried ta the
White House in the hope perchance- of

ihey battered down the doors and con
soling themselves for the loss of their
distinguished captives by a ruthless de
struction of the furniture they raided
the larder and regaled themselves with
a hastily prepared feast in the state
dining room Then destroying the re
maining provisions and breaking and
mutilating whatever they could readily
lay their hands on they concluded their
visit by setting1 fire to the home of the
president Numerous other public and
private buildings were also destroyed

A Carpet Knight-
The following curious definitions of a
carpet knight were recently given in an
English examination One who re
ceived his knighting upon the field of
the cloth of gold a knight who stood
on a carpet and had another thrown
over him while being knighted the
common black heetle which when
squashed resembles all the different
shades of a brussels carpet a knight
which sleeps on a carpet a man
like for instance Sir X Co who is
one of the bet carpet makers and be
cause he did make them so well he was
make a knigiit
A shot was said to go off because
the sudden shock in a sort of way
frightens the bullet And it was de
clared that a dog turns around several
times hefore settling down to sleep to
make sure he is not sitting on any un
pleasant objeot such as a black beetle

A Good Guess of Hong Ago
During the American Eevolution an
English magazine published an estimate
of the North American colonies Plac
ing the population Ihen at 3000000
and assuming that it would double it
self every 25 years the writer estimated
that in the year 1890 the number wQuld
have increased to 61000000 This may
be taken as a most remarkable prophecy
inasmuch as the census of 1890 fixes
the total population at 02622250
