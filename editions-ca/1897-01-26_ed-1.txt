business though notit better prices It is interesting thatalmost all prices which will change atall are lower than a week ago and vetbusiness is unquestionably largerThere is larger production but as yetnot as much increase in consumption and there is larger buyingof materials but at present only because better prices are expectedin the future - A few conspicuous failures during the week have had no material influence The market for securities is slightly stronger and yetthere is very little doing The numoerof hands employed all industries considered is slightly larger than aweek ago with adverse changein the rate of wanes Allapprehension of foreign disturbanceof money markets has passed awaybut there is still great caution in making loans It is a mistake to reckonthese as symptoms of depression Onthe contrary in view of the lowerrange of prices in important industriesthe conditions all indicate larger production and a consumption increasingnot as yet large but steadilyThe earnings of railroads in Januaryhave been 44 per cent smaller thanlast yearWheat corn and cotton exports arethe key of the financial situation andduring the past week wheat has declined e and corn v while cotton isunchanged The western receipts ofwheat are still smallThe woolen industry is as slow asever and no real improvement appearsin the demand for goods although owing to the lateness of the season thereis a little more doing both in springand in winter goods without quotablechange in prices The heavy buying of wool mentioned last week hascontinued and is understood to be inanticipation of expected duties thesales at Boston alone having amountedto 11856000 pounds Quotations havenot changed as yet although westernholders are quite stiff In the minormetals a stronger tone is generalThe

him thisweek The doubts about Mr Gagespolitical faith and economic creedshave been removed within the lasttwenty four hours by the visit of Alexander Revel of Chicago to Canton Itmay be safely assumed that his appointment is being more seriously considered than everThere is an impression that the cabinet will be practically completed within two or at least three weeks withthe possible exception of one placeThe secretary of state is of coursedecided upon and the secretary of thetreasury will be as definitely determined and so will be the secretary of theinterior but the portfolios of war ofthe navy of agriculture of justiceand the post office department will bechanged a good deal Gen Algers appointment to the cabinet is not regarded as certain but the belief that hewill be in it grows and this notion isstrengthened by the knowledge thatex Governor Merriam of Minnesotaand Henry C Payne of Wisconsinseems to have been dropped for thetime at least from tho list of those-who are are being

saw a manrushing- toward him whom he did notrecognizeYour name is Kenyon isnt itasked the man somewhat out of breathYes that is my nameI guess you dont remember me Iam the telegraph operator We havehad a dispatch waiting for you for sometime a cablegram from London Wehave searched all over the town for you1 t couldnt find 3ouAli said Kenyon is it importantWell that I dont know You hadbetter come with me to the office andget it Of course they dont generally cable unimportant things I remember it said something about you keeping yourself in readiness for somethingThey walked together to the telegraph office The boy was still searching for Kenyon with the original dispatch but the operator turned up thefile and read it to himYou see it wants an answer hesaid thats why I thought it was important to get you You will haveplenty of time for an answer to nightJohn took a lead pencil and wrotethe cable dispatch which Wentworthreceived He paid his money and saidI will go to my hotel It is thehouse I will wait there and if anjthing comes for me send it over assoon as possibleAll right said the operator thatis the best plan then we will know exactly where to find you Of coursethere is no use in your waiting- herebecause we can get you in five minutesPorhaps I had better telephone to thehotel for you if anything comesVery well said Kenyon I willleave it all in your handsWhether it was the effect of havingbeen in the country or not John feltthat somehow the cablegram he hadreceived was a good omen He meditated over the ill luck he had suffered inthe whole business from beginning toend and thought of oldworths favorite phraseMrLong-Theres nosuch thing as luckThen came a raj at his door and thebellbov said There is a gentlemanhere wishes to speak to youTell him to come up was the answer and two minutes later Von BrententeredAny news he aslisdJohn Avho wras in a state of mind-which made him suspicious of every-thing and everybody answered Nonothing freshAh I am sorry for that I had somehopes that perhaps you might be ableto raise the money before 12 oclock tomorrow Of course you know theends tit noon to morrowrJYes I know thatDid you know that Longworth wasan townNo said Kenyon I have been outof town myselfYes he came last night He has thes mon ey in the bank as I told you NowVJ VR not accept it until the very latestOf course legally I cannotaccept it before that time and just asTJleiralli I cannot refuse his monejr whenhe tenders it lam very sorry all thishas happened more sorry than I cantell you I hope y ou will not think that jI am to blame in the matterNo youare not in the slightest toblame There is nobody to blame except myself I feel that I have beenculpably negligent and altogether tootrustfulI wish to goodness I knew whereyou could get the money but of courseif I knew that I wrould have had it myself long agoI am very much obliged to yousaid Kenyon but the only thing youcan do for me is to see that vour clockis not ahead of time to morrow I mayperhaps be up at the office before 12oclock that is where I shall find youI supposeYes I shall be there all the forenoonI shall not leave until 12Very good I am much obliged toyou Mr Yon Brent for your sympathy I assure you I havent manyfriends and it well Im obliged toyou thats all An Englishman youknow is not very profuse in the matter of thanks but I mean itIm sure you do said Von Brentand Im only sorry that my assistancecannot be something substantial Wellgood by hoping to see you to morrowAfter he had departed Kenyons impatience increased as the hours wenton lie left the hotel and went directto the telegraph office but nothing hadcome for himIm afraid said the operator thatthere wont be anything more to nightIf it should come late shall I send itto your hotelCertainly no matter at what hour itcomes I wish you would let me haveit as soon as possible It is very importantLeaving the office he went up thestreet and passing the principal hotelin the place saw young Longworth asdapper and correct in costume as everhis single eyeglass the admiration ofall Ottawa for there was not anotherlike it in the city standing under theportico of the hotelHow do you do Kenyon said thatyoung manMy dear sir said Kenyon the lasttime you spoke to me you said you desired to have nothing more to sav tome I cordially reciprocated thatsentiment and I want to have nothingto say to youMy dear fellow cried young MrLongworth jauntily there is no harmdone Of course in New York I wata little out of sorts Everybody is inNew York beastly hole- I dont thinkit is worse than Ottawa but the air isurer here By the way perhaps youand I can make a little arrangement Iam going to buy that mine to morrowas doubtless you know Now I shouidlike to see it in the hands of a good andcompetent man If a couple of hundred pounds a year would be any temptation to you I think we can afford tolet you develop the mineThank you said KenjonI knew you would be grateful justthink over the matter will you anddont come to any rash decision Wecan xirobabiy give a little more thanthat but until we see how the mine isturning out it is not likely we shallspend a great deal of money on itOf course said John the propeianswer to yowv remark would be toknock you down but besides being alaw abiding citizen I have no desire toget into jail to night for doing it because there is one chance in a thousand Mr Longworth that I may havfsome business to do with that minemyself before 12 oclock to morrowAh it is my turn to be grateful nowsaid Mr Longworth In a rough-and-tumblefight I am afraid you wouldmaster me easier than you would do ina contest of diplomacyDo you call it diplomacy You refer I suppose to your action in relation to the mine I call it robberyOh do you Well that is the kindof conversation which leads to breachesof the peace and as I also am a lawabiding citizen I will not continue thediscussion any further I bid you avery good evening Mr Kenyon Saying which the young man turned intothe hotel John walked to his ownmuch more modest inn and retired forthe night He did not sleep well Allnight long phantom telegraph messengers were rapping at the door and hestarted up every now and then to receive cablegrams which faded away ashe awoke Shortly after breakfast hewent to the telegraph office but foundthat nothing had arrived for himI am afraid said the operatorthat nothing will arrive before noonBefore noon echoed John WhyThe wires are down in some placesin the east and messages are delayed agood deal Perhaps you noticed thelack of eastern news in the morningpapers Very little news came fromthe east last night Seeing Johnslook of anxious interest the operatorcontinued uoes the aisxiatcn youexpect pertain to money mattersYes it doesDo- they know you at the bankNo I dont think they doThen if I were you I would go up tothe bank to be identified so that if itis a matter of minutes no unnecessarytime may be lost You had better tellthem that you expect a money orderby telegram and although such ordersare paid without any identification atthe bank yet they take every precaution to see that it does not get into thehands of the wrong manThank you said Kenyon I ammuch obliged to you for your suggestion I will act upon it And assoon as the bank opened John Kenyonpresented himself to the cashierI am expecting a large amount ofmoney i om England to day It isver3r important that when it arrivesthere shJl be no delay in having itplaced atiny disposal I want to knowif there are any formalities to be gonethroughWhere 5s the money coming fromsaid the cleric --i4--It is coming from EnglandIs there anyone in Ottawa whocanidentifj youYes I know the telegraph operatorhereAh said the cashier somewhatdoubtfully anybody elseMr Von Brent knows me very wellThat will do Suppose you get MrVon Brent to come here and identifyyou as the man who bears the name ofKenyon Then the moment your cablegram comes the money will be at yourdisposalsKenyon hurried to Von Brentsrooms and found him alone Will youcome down to the bank and identify meas KenyonCertainly Has the money arrivedNo it hasi not but I expect it andwant to provide for every contingency1 do not wish to have any delay in myidentification when it does comeIf it comes by cable said VonBrent there will be no need of identification The bank is not responsibleyou know They take the money entirely at the senders risk They mightpay it to the telegraph operator whoreceives the message I believe theywould not be held liable However itis better to see that nothing is left undoneGoing over to the bank Von Brentsaid to the cashier This is JohnKenyonVery good replied the cashierHave you been at the telegraph officelately Mr KenyonNo I have not at least not for halfan hour or soWell I would go there as soon aspossible if I were youThat means said Von Brent assoon as they had reached the doorthat they have had their notice aboutthe money I believe it is already inthe bank for you I will go back to myrooms and not leave them till foucomeJohn hurried to the telegraph officeAnything for me yet hes aidNothing as yet Mr Kenyon I thinkhowever he added with a smile thatit will be all right I hope soThe moments ticked along with theirusual rapidity yet it seemed to Kenyonthe clock was going fearfully fastEleven oclock came and found him stillpacing up and down the office of thetelegraph The operator offered himthe hospitality of the private room butthis he declined Every time the machine clicked Johns ears were on thealert trying to catch a meaning fromthe instrumentTen minutes after 11Twenty minutes after 11 and still nodispatch The cold perspiration stoodon Johns brow and he groaned aloudI suppose it is very important saidthe operatorVery importantWell now I shouldnt say so butI know the money is in the bank for3ou Perhaps if you went up there anddemanded it they would give it to youIt was 25 minutes past the hourivhen John hurried up toward thebank I have every belief he said toShes coming Its all right John KenyonOttawathe cashier that the money is here forme now Is it possible for me to getitHave you the cablegramNo I have notWell you see we cannot pay themoney until we see the cablegram tothe person for whom it is intended Iftime is of importance you should notleave the telegraph office and the moment you get your message come hereihen there will be no delay whateverDo you wish to draw all the money atonceI dont know how much there is butI must have 20000Very well to save time you had better make out a check for 20000 thatwill be and here he gave the numberof dollars at the rate of the day on thepound Just make out a check forthat amount and I will certify it A certified check is as good as gold The moment yon get your message I will handyou the certified checkJohn wrote out the order and handedit to the cashier glancing at the clockas he did so It was now 25 minotes of 12 He rushed to the telegraph office with all the speed ofwhich he was capable but met only ablank look from the chief operatorIt has not come yet he said shaking his headGradually despair began to descendon the waiting man It was worse tpmiss everything now than neverto have had the hope of success It was like hanging aman who had once been reprievedHe resumed his nervous pace up anddown that chamber of torture Aquarter of twelve He heard the chimesving somewhere If the message didnot come before they rang again itwould be iorever too lateEourteen minutes 13 minutes 13minutes 11 minutes 10 minutes to 12and yet noHere you are shouted the operator in

DistrictsIn our anxiety to promote good farming there is no danger that the subjectof good roads will be overlooked Whena man gets the spirit in him to impro ehis farm his crops and his live stockthe

the unsightly bushes along the margin seewhere drainage is needed and how theroadway could be improved and thenresolve that it shall be done at the firstopportunity A good farmer is always ja good roads advocateJust now many things are conspiringto assure good roads in the near futureA few years ago the road scraper onwheels came into vogue A law wasenacted to permit a few adjoining roaddistricts to unite and purchase ascraper to be used in common as it isan expensive piece of machinery andrarely a single district could afford topurchase one alone Now these machines are common all over the stateand through their means road improvement has made rapid strides It is notnecessary to describe all their good- -KVLrs flOZ - -SBIyyiiiDRIVE NEAR MARIETTA Opoints for every one knows

wouldbicycling on country roads be now werethe old style hand road scrapers still inuse In removing earth from guttersinto the wragon track they left twosmall ridges along the space they traveled and these were seldom leveled Ifa wheel could travel them at all theywould certainly go bumpity bumpBicycles rarely have a clear course in atraveled wagon track for there aremore or less narrow ruts and horsesfeet are apt to cut up the paths inwhich they have to travel continuouslyThe modern road machines whereused for some time have had the effectto cut off the shoulders of the roads andplace this dry solid earth in the centerof the track picking it up so water willrun off at the sides as it should do instead of following ruts as formerlyI know a certain hill road extending tothe railroad station that was alwaysbad Its surface was broad stony andfull f ruts The wheeled scraper hasmade it the model road of the townshipand the district is proud of it Therewas a very steep ascending grade

western countrytown who cannot find a regular customer or customers who will take butter the year around at a good pricewhich will be a good round averagaprice for the year says the HomesteadAll that is necessary to make contracting of this kind easy is that the butteimaker establish a record for havingeverything nice and clean and for producing a quality that is both good anduniform The price that can be securedin this way is always considerably better than the ordinary way of selling tothe grocer or store keeper As a practical question it is subject to only onedrawback and that is from the side oithe customer We have known a goodmany town people who contracted fottheir butter- this way and a very common complaint among them was thatthey alwajs get their butter if theprice to be paid was a little better thanthe stores and groceries were payingbut when with the change of the season the price rose until the store keepeior grocer was paying a little above theagreed average price the butter makeivery commonly reported that the cowswere failing and he did not have anybutter to deliver under the contractOf course if one practices this speciesof dishonesty he will find it difficult

veterinary surgeon who has giventhe subject great thought and experimented with victims of cribbingand wind sucking habits declares thata horse having both or either of thesehabits should be classed as unsoundand that young horses often contractthe habit from being stalled near a confirmed rubber or wind sucker Thesame authority thinks the best preventive outside of a specially devised appalatus

HOLBKUOECopyright 1S97Pate was a cat and Leonard Herrickwas a mouse There had been somerare sport hut Herrick was of the opinion that it could not last much longerHe had run this way and that way anda thousand timeshe had fancied thathe was going to escape But alwaysthe velvet paws with the long sharpclaws springing out of them had caughthim just in time So at last he lay stillpanting not knowing which way toturnHe was in a big city all alone Thepeople who rushed by him were like thethoughts that whirled through hisbrainy they were shadows and the everlasting train of them had no beginning- nor end He could not distinguish thereal men and women whom he saw fromthose whom he merely rememberedNow and again there appeared in thethrong the faces of the dead he didntmind those but there were others thatho shrank fromlie stood with his back against theiron fence in front of Trinity churchThere was just light enough in thewestern sky to give the pile of stone ashadow which fell upon hurrying thousands who did not notice itHerricks hands were in his pocketsHe crumpled a crackling piece of paperwhich meant that he could live severaldays longer if he cared to do so Asto a more extended future he couldnot picture it All the lines of his lifeseemed to end in a knot which couldby no means be untied but mustmerely be dropped He rememberedthat there were miracles but he couldnot think of one to wish forFrom three oclock till four the crowdin that part of Broadway is rich andprosperous from four till five it boastsof wealthy connections and takes astrong interest in life after five it losescaste rapidly and by six it is a lot ofweary people going home to supperHerrick felt the degeneracy of thethrong without really seeing it If aiwhole street full of people could getshabby in an hour was it any wonderthat he had done it in five yearsne crossed Broadway and walkeddown Wall street slowly and withiiation for he had no errand A voicecried Cab sir almost in his earHe turned and looked up at the man onthe boxIs it possible he said to himselfthat I still look like a gentlemanHe felt toward the cabman as towardone who had given him a helping handWhy not pay the debt To do so wouldcost him only a day of his life He hada firerdollar bill in his pocketYes he said take me up to theFifth Avenue hotelIt was tlhe first place that had comeinto his mind He got into the caband snapped the door The cushionedseat and the comfortable support forhis head weire very refreshing Afancy came to Turn that he would dinedecently and then go to a theater Theextravagance would be trifling for itwas really of small importance whetherhe starved to death on Sunday or thefollowing Wednesday He was in amood to make a jest of it allA strong glare from an electric lightIt truck down into the carriage andmade visible to him a package inbrown paper that looked as if it mightbe a sandwich The object protrudedfrom under the seat He thought itmust be the cabmans supper whichhad been hidden in some small lockerand had fallen upon the fioor The ideathat the food should be Spoiled was disagreeable to Herrick and so he picked-up the little brown bundleIt was smaller than he had supposedand it did not feel like bread But hadit been food and he at the last pang ofstarvation the touch of it would nothave sent such a thrill through all hisframeHe knew that the contents of thatpackage was money It felt like a massof bills folded awkwardly wrapped upand fastened with elastic bandsThrough the brown covering Herrickcould feel the crispness of the govern-ment paper The amount might be apoor mans monthly wages or a richmans profit on a great transaction- As to his own conduct in this matterHerrick had no doubt whatever Fatehad thrown the money into his handsand fate might take it away but not ifhe could hold on tightly enough Hisfingers trembled as he picked at theelastic bands Suddenly and withouthis knowing why the rubber stringsvanished with a loud snap that startledhim and the xackage sprang open onhis knees He caught a flash of greencolor and then the cab rolled out oflight into shadowIt seemed a long time before auotherlight struck in upon him At the moment when it did so he saw a face closeto the cab door and he dodged backcovering the bills with his hands Butthe chance passenger on the street sawnothing he was thinking of his ownJJaffairs no doubt and had no inkling ofv the strauge thing- that passed so closeto his eyesHerrick was himself again in amoment and he bent forward eagerlyscanning the bills in his hands andcounting them feverishly There were40 of them and each was of the denitation of 1000- Throughout the latter period of theyoung mails misfortunes he had hadsubstantially but one wish to restPest had many forms suited to a vastariety of individual tastes To HerItk in his day dreams it had alwaysthe form of travel without caretil paths iif cper for a man who hasj4C0O ssfrr JMci t no reason whyyyiiu1vffl4withis money He did not even speculateupon the manner of its loss It hadpassed into the control of one who needed it and that was enoughHe disposed the notes in his pocketsin the best interests of comfort andsafety Then he folded up the brownpaper and pocketed that also with adim consciousness that if it were leftin the cab it might get the driver intotrouble The fellow was honest nodoubt and Herrick did not wish thathe should suffer a wrong He preferredto keep the wrapper himself and takethe risk of it until he could find somemeans of disposing of it that would besafer than throwing it out of the cabwindowHow to leave the cab was a questionwhich concerned him nearly He didnot wish to confront the driver againfor there might be an investigation anda question of identification might arisein which case it would be well to havethe man know as little as possible ofHerricks personal appearance He reflected with satisfaction that the spoton Wall street where he had enteredthe carriage had been rather darkThe cab stopped suddenly Its pathbeing blocked by a tangle of vehiclesHerrick softly put his hand upon thecatch of the door It yielded noiselessly the door swung openHerrick stepped out Turning backfor an instant he perceived the cabmansitting upon his box in entire unconsciousness of the fraud that was beingpracticed upon him He was a poorman and doubtless worked hard forall the money that he received Stillywy4iti5twB-voice with which to ask who was there -But one explanation was possible Tiemust have been watched Jy the policeHe tottered to the door and gavetterance to a hoarse inarticulate soundEight oclock sir called a voicewithout You asked to be called sirHe rushed to the window and flungopen the shutters Day streamed instrong and beautifuL The gas flamepaled He knew that he had slept ashe had not slept before in years Inthe mysterious depths of his life he felta new strength stirring but it was onlynascent as yetA bath and a breakfast revived himstill more He felt the exhilarationTofa busy day upon which he was entering He scanned the papers but so -faras he could see they had no news ofthe money that had been lost Hevasnot conscious of any excitement ansearching for that news The fear ofdetection had quite left him Of allstolen goods money is the hardest torecoverPresently he found himself ridingdowntown in an elevated railroad trainHe was going to a steamship office toarrange for his journey then to a bankers for a travelers cheque bookHis pockets were bulging with moneybut there was something in one of themthat he couldnt remember to have putthere He pulled it out and found itto be the brown paper wrapper that hadcontained the money As he held itin his hand it was concealed by hisnewspaper No fellow passenger couldsee it and that was doubly fortunatebecause in plain sight upon the paperwas a name and address Herbert LGraham 40 Wall streett YL vlli jf w jV x fI J JlT 1 WiHE DODGED BACK COVERINGit was reckless to attract his attentionagain especially so after having leftthe cab in that strange mannerThere was a way to the sidewalkthrough the press of vehicles Herricksaw it from the corner of his eye andwas about to take advantage of it Instead to his surprise he found himselfturning toward the cabman and immediately he heard his own voice sayingI have decided to get out here Howmuch do I owe youThe cabman named his price andHerrick paid him with the five dollarbill which had been the sum of hiswealth and the end of it so far as hecould see so short a time before Hecounted his change carefully remembering that he would probably have towait until the next day before he couldbreak -one of the thousands Enoughremained to him from the bill for asupper a bed and a breakfastTHE BILLS WITH HIS HANDsFstead of south Presently he foundhimself asking an elevator boy in a bigbuilding if he Icnew where Mr Gra rhams office was -Mr Graham happened to be in his 50 cent stamp andouter office

enchanted food It was thp farrof an Atlantic liner the delicacies ofEuropean hotels and the fruits of thetropicsHe cared little for his bed It wouldbe no more than a place to lie andthink of the future It Mas many anight since he had really slept Certainly with so much upon his mind hewould not sleep this night even if heshould try So when he had beenshown to his room in a hotel he piledhis pillows against the headboard ofthe bed and reclined against themfully dressed He was very happy Noquestion of right or wrong in what hehad done or what he expected to docame to torment him For a iong timehe had borne his life like a tremendousburden This had suddenly slippedfrom his shoulders leaving his naturalpowers benumbedIn the midst of the first vision of auew life he was aroused by a

newspapers has vaunted the proposedtransporting of a whole town some40 odd miles along a frozen river a heretofore unknown feat as it claims theobject of the removal being to place thetown among some hills that lend themselves admirably to the purpose of fortification thus securing a valuable military station It will undoubtedly bequite a feat to accomplish such a taskand if the Russian engineers find anyhitch in their plans they can surmountthe difficulties by reference to a similar undertaking successfully accomplished in the state of Illinois namelyirhe moving of the town of Nauvoo overa frozen river In the course of threewinters this was done and 700 houseswere transported and a new town nowa prosperous place was establihedThe Russian newspapers can boast ofthe great work of moving

for a building-and a government exhibit at theTennessee Centennial and Internationalexposition completes the grand schemeof the exposition managers and roundsout the success for which they havelabored so diligently and efficientlyduring the past 12 months The broadscope of the enterprise as originallyplanned has been fully provided forand that which many thought to be impossible has been accomplishedThe main buildings representingsome of the finest specimens of ancientarchitecture the world has ever knownhave been erected and completed withthe single exception of the Historybuilding one -of the grandest of theentire group and this is now wellunder way Outside of the state foreignand county buildings and some smallerones for amusements concessions etcthere are 12 principal

There is the same appear-ance of solidity and premanency whilethe art displayed in their constructionand finish apxeals to the wonder andadmiration of the visitor and makeshim open his eyes in astonishmentThese buildings having been cdnipleted the exposition could be openedat once and the management havingoffered to refund all money chargedfor space if the exhibits are in placeon opening day there remains 30 doubtthat the exposition will be complete oressentially so on the day the gates arethrown open to the public In this particular the Tennessee centennial andinternational exposition will avoid annoyance from the builders and exhibitors who will be out of the way or willliave their goods in place when the firstvisitors arriveThe handsome recognition by theUnited States government and the remarkable interest manifested byforeign countries establishes the claimand purpose of the Exposition company that this celebration of the statesone hundredth anniversary is not to
