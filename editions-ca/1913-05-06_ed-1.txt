It may be well to quietly reach under the hen and Removesuch egg shells as can be taken outwithout disturbing her, but nothingfurther should be attempted.The first duty is to provide a coopfor the hen and brood. No matterwhat kind of a coop, from a barrellaid down to the most improved patented article, is used. See that it isclean and the bottom covered withfind sand, or if the weather be reallycold, with oat chaff or short fine hay.When the chickens are twenty-fourhours old they are ready to be removed to their new quarters. Up tothis time, writes M. E. Scully of Illinois in the Prairie Farmer, theyshould have received no food, but theyare now ready for their first meal.Give them water to drink in a vesselinto which they cannot get theirbodies. A tin vegetable can withsmall holes punched around the bottom and placed in a deep saucer willanswer admirably. Whatever theirfirst food may be, give them only asmall quantity. The best rule forfeeding is "little and often."Two distinct methods of feedinghave their special advocates, the wet,that is, ground feed moistened withmilk or water; and the dry. I findthe latter method the more satisfactory. I feed cracked wheat, corn andoatmeal.Keep the chicks healthy and growing right from the start. Keep themdry and warm. Give them plenty ofgrit and pure water. If in a brooderscatter food in chaff and let them getexercise by scratching. The firstthree weeks are the most critical time;after that, if kept free from lice, theywill do well.HOPPER FOR FEEDING MASHHome-made Receptacle for keepingOyster Shells, Charcoal and GritIs Quite Convenient.I follow the "dry hopper" methodin feeling fowls and keep constantlybefore them a mash made of two partsbran and one part each by weight ofmiddlings, corn meal, gluten meal,ground oats and beef scraps. In themorning I scatter whole grain in thelitter and at night feed corn In winter, but only a little of it in summer,Dry Mash Self-Feeder.1 twrites Merrit T! Mead of MontgomeryCounty, Ind., in the Farm and Home.Oyster shells, charcoal and grit arekept in "bins" in the home-mader "hopper," which is herewith illustrated. From experience I think thisline of feeding satisfactory, for from115 hens I got 11,357 eggs in 11months.Tinnini 1 miii 1 im 1 1 amKeep something in the grit box.Millet is a great egg-producingfood.Crowding just now lessen the fertility of eggs.- Get an incubator and let the henskeep on laying.No better feed in the world thannice plump oats and wheat.The first warm days start vermin togrowing in unclean houses.The modern poultry house has' everything inside it easily movable.Never feed little chicks wet, sloppy food. It is bad enough for maturestock.Boiling the oats or wheat makes agood ration and' a desirable changeoccasionally.Feed at regular hours and the fowlswill always be ready and waiting fortheir last meal.A little more elbow grease used, in, keeping the premises clean will oftenprevent disease.A hopperful of bran Is always seasonable fed and the whole flock shouldhave access to it.Get rid of the hen that is nevercaught on the nest.

The followingplan, which is arranged to accommodate ten or twelve hens and a male,has been found very satisfactory. Itmay be enlarged for a greater number,always remembering that each additional fowl means from five to eightsquare feet more of floor space.The coop In question is five feetwide and twelve feet long, giving afloor space of sixty square feet fiveor six square feet per hen. It is sixfeet high at the front, and four feetat the back, and is built from cheaplumber, and covered with tarred roofing. On most farms there are oddsand ends of boards enough to putA Splendid Specimen.up such a coop, except for the roofing. As no glass is used, the onlyadditional expense will be for nails,hinges, a few yards of cheap cottondomestic, and a little poultry netting. The door into the coop is put at oneend of the front wall. It is not closedwith a solid door, but with a framecovered with wire netting, having acurtain of muslin on the inside foruse in cold weather. The upper halfof the remaining part of the front isalso left open and covered with netting, with an inside muslin curtain.In warm weather these curtains arekept rolled up, but in cold weatherthey are let down over the openings.They should be large enough to coverthem well, and have weights at theboftom to hold them in place. If ahen is run in, and a rather heavy slatthrust through the casing thus formed,they will stay in place very well.The only other openings in the coopare four little square doorways, eightby ten inches in size. If the hens arevery large, these may be made somewhat larger each way. One of theselittle doors should be in each end, andone in each lower corner ofi the backwall. They are closed with a slidingpanel, set in a little frame, whichcan be raised or lowered by a wire orstout cord. Only one is, of course, tobe used at a time."in the center of the back wall, twofeet above the flodr, fasten i frametwo feet wide and three feet long,carrying two roosting poles. Thisframe should be hinged to the wall soit can be raised out of the way whendesired. Under it, a foot from thefloor, make a little platform of boardsto catch the droppings. Do not fastenthis anywhere, as you will want totake it up to clean it. On the frontcorners of the roosting frame put legsa foot long, which should rest on thisdropping board when -the roost islowered in place. Have both roostingpoles the same height, not set so theframe will slant-.On the celling, directly above theroost, nail strips of inch boards so asto make a frame the same size, or atrifle larger, than the roost itself. Tothis tack strips of burlap sacking longenough to reach the floor, and wideenough to completely Burround thecoop when they are dropped in place.At the lower edges put slats to keepthem in place, as on th6 other curtains. On cold nights this makes asnug, and yet not stuffy, sleeping place'for the biddies. In the warmer partsof the country this inside curtainwill not be needed, T)ut in the colderstates it will give ample protectionthrough the winter. It should berolled up during the day.The nest boxes two are plentyshould be placed in the darkest partof the coop. This will be against thefront wall, in the corner farthestfrom the outer door. A box threefeet long and a foot deep, with partition-inthe middle, and doors cut inthe ends, makes a good nest whenturned bottom side up over a nicedeep bed of clean straw.

Thehouse should haye a cement or boardfloor and can be so built as to make itrat, wind and rain proof. I prefera floor of cement, writes William Scottof Abilene, Kan., in the FarmersMail and Breeze;The house should front south andyards may be laid off for the use of' iffiTTTTpr---fl0Good for Several Uses,individual pens if desired. This kindof house is also suitable for raisingearly hatched chicks.The upper windows are hinged sothey may be swung open at any desired angle or to be hooked up asthe weather -demands. The lowerfront is covered with one-inch meshwire and a drop canvas or windowsmay be used. The window should behung so as to swing in at any desiredangle. Roosts are placed along thenorth wall. A single roost runningthe length, of the building and setout two feet from the north wall, maybe made to serve the purpose.A roost shield for cold weather canbe made of a frame the length of theroosts and two feet wide, to be covered with sound burlap on top andsides. Place this frame six inchesabove the "birds' heads and let theburlap hang a foot below the roosts.This frame should be drawn up outof the way each morning.If nests are place low enough notmany hens will lay on the floor and itis often considered better still to placethem right on the floor. A screenmade of burlap so it will almost hidethe nests make them more atractiveto the hens and helps to prevent eggeating. 'SULPHURING' THE HEN HOUSEJob Should Be Performed at LeastOnce Every Month First Remove All Combustibles.To burn sulphur in a poultry housefirst remove all combustible matter.Then put an old iron kettle into adishpan and place on four bricks inthe middle of the house. In the kettle put some cobs which have beensoaked in a solution of one part ofpine tar to four parts of kerosene,sprinkle the sulphur over the cobsand set on fire.Be sure to have everything arrangedso is to beat a hasty retreat fromtheroom and close the door quicklyasr,the 'sulphur fumes are suffocating.Sulphur burned in this manner willpenetrate every crevice as well ascovering the surface and aids wonderfully in purifying the building andin destroying poultry vermin.One pint of turpentine may be added to the half gallon of kerosene aswell as the pine tar with beneficialresults. Once a month is none toooften to burn sulphur in every poultryhouse.Never breed from immuature stock.Ground bone is , great for layinghens.The first symptoms of roup swollen eyes.Dampness and chilling mean suredeath to chicks.Do not allow the fowls to be exposedto the strong winds.Soft-shelled eggs are a sign of lackof lime or of over-feeding.Scrub hens kept by scrub poultrymen make a bad combination.Sifted ashes scattered under theroosts make an excellent absorbent.Try hard never to catch' a hen bythe wing or feathers; gra"b her bythe legs.A little granulated charcoal mixedin tie soft feed is excellent in casesof diarrhoea.If there are cracks in the walls ofthe houses, the chilly winds are sureto create a draft.The best way to run an incubatoris to follow the directions that comewith the machine.The hen that will not scratch forher living is too lazy to make you aprofit as a layer.Leghorns make poor Bitters.
