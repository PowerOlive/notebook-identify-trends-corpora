Following the action of the newly
elected Board of Council in increas
ing the present police force by two,
and adding the sum of $1,200 to the
city salaries list, which was vetoed
by Mayor January, the following
petition has been p'laced in circula
tion in Paris, and being numerously
signed:
"We, the undersigned citizens and
taxpayers of the city of Paris, wish
to strongly commend the action of
Mayor January and Councilmen
Doyle, Mitchell and Santen, and to
show our appreciation of their
honest and sincere efforts to give us
an efficient administration without
increasing our tax burdens, which
are already as heavy as we can bear.
"We especially request our repre
sentatives not to increase our police
force or paid officials, as the protec
tion of our city depends, not only
the number, but the efficiency of its
police force, and we had been assur
ed that when alcoholic beverages
were legally voted out, we could de
crease and not increase our police
force.

The Lexington and Paris Knighta
of Columbus basket ball teams will
meet to-night on the Y. M. C. A.
floor, in a struggle which promises
to give the spectators plenty of ex
citement and interest. The Paris
boys are "up on their toes" and have
been for some time, putting in extra
hours of strenuous practice. They
are confident of taking the measure
of the Lexington boys in to-night'a
game, and will put forth every ef
fort to be returned winners. Paris
people have not had an opportunity
of seeing a basketball game since
last season, and the K. of C. team
solemnly promises the opener will be
one that will win their approval.
The probable line-up of the Lex
ington team will be as follows:
Deveraux and McCarty, forwards;
Heely, Center; Mooney and Bana
han, guards.
In last season's games the local K.
of C. team made an enviable record,
having a number of well-earned vic
tories to their credit.
