The
Cruel Knife
The alarming increase in the number
of deaths which occur as the result of a
surgical operation is attracting general
attention and a strong sentiment
against such methods of treatment is
fast developing among the most intelli
gent classes It seems that in almost
doctors treatment
every case for which the
ment is unsuccessful the learned physi
cians decide at once that an operation
must be performed and the keen blade
of the surgeon is recklessly resorted to
Doctors are human and of course are
liable to make mistakes but their mis
takes are too fatal to be indulged in
promiscuously and as so many lives are
sacrificed in this manner it is but natural
for the public to believe that half the
operations are unnecessary besides be
ing a fearful risk to human life even if
successful
It is a positive fact however that all
operations are not necessary and that a
majority of them are absolutely under
taken without the slightest chance of
success The doctors have never been
able to enre a blood disease and a sur
gical operation -is their only method of
treating deep seated cases such as can
cer and scrofulous affections Aside
from the great danger an operation
never did and never will cure cancer as
the disease never fails to return Can
cer is in the blood and common sense
leaches anyone that no disease can be
cut from the blood
Here is a case where the pain inflicted
on a sis-year-old boy was especially
cruel and after undergoing the tortures
produced by the surgeons knife he rap
idly grew worse Mr J N Murdoch
the father of the boy residing at 279
Snodgrass street Dallas Texas writes
When my son Will was six years
old a small sore appeared on his lip
which did not yield to the usual treat
ment but before long began to grow It
gave him a great deal of pain and con
tinued to spread He was treated by
several good doctors who said he had
cancer and advised that an operation
was necessary
After much reluctance we consented
and they cut down to the jaw bone
which they scraped The operation was
a severe one but I thought it was the
only hope for my boy Before a great
while the cancer returned and began to
grow rapidly We gave him many rem
edies without relief and finally upon the
advice of a friend decided to try SSS
Swifts Specific and with the second
bottle he began to improve After twenty
bottles had been taken the cancer dis
appeared entirely and he was cured
The cure was a permanent one for he is
now seventeen years old and has never
had a sign of the dreadful disease to re
turn
SSS is far ahead of all other blood
remedies because it is the only one
which cures deep seated obstinate blood
diseases such as Cancer Scrofula
Eczema Catarrh Rheumatism etc
It is the only blood remedy guaranteed
Purely Vegetable
containing not a particle of mercury
potash or other mineral ingredient
which are so injurious to the system
SSS is sold by all druggists j

THEIR QUEER W
ACTORS AND SINGERS ADjSlR
1 REMARKS ON Th Caitlo
Callous Indifference or Ignorance theTCom
nionest Refuse of the Artistic NstjM e
porter
There are many amusing things
about the artistic temperament ud
the innocent reporter but you hayeto
know the disposition in order fell
how funny they really are Youmnst
know enough not to believe thermal
ways and then through all yonrinter
course with the professionals therefwill
flow an accompaniment of easy humor
that gives acquaintance with theselper
sons an added pleasure One charnniig
incident of this can always be founcTin
their views of what the newspapers say
about them Mrs James Brown Potter
is the only woman I ever saw vwho
talked frankly about that subject
So long as they dont ignoreme
she said I dont care what they write
Let them say anything so long aslhey
say it but it would be horrible to be
left alone
That was a very truthful statement
of her own opinions and almostn
paralleled in its frankness Everybody
knows that Mrs Potter has never fhad
very much to thank the newspapers for
that was really pleasant but shoshad
plenty to be grateful for as long as she
was willing they should print anything
if it kept her in the public eye
Almost as genuine was a young
American singer who came back here
after she had made a debut and some
little reputation in Europe Sbewjas a
pretty woman and she had a good voice
but she was unfortunate Once sheiiad
a sore throat and another time shewas
out of condition for some other reason
At all events she was never in condi
tion to do herself justice So therewas
nothing pleasant that even with the
kindest intentions the newspapers could
say about the young woman One night
toward the close of the season shewas
in a grand tier bos at the opera house
During one of the entractes she was
walking about the foyer with a friend
and halted in front of the greenroom
What is that room her friend asked
Planting herself deliberately m
front of the partly opened curtains she
said in a voice audible to every man in
the room Oh that is the place they
go to write in the most disagreeable
way they can the most disagreeable
things they can think of about you
The younger singer was unjust but she
had no false vanity She was willing to
have it known that she read what the
newspapers said about her Her more
illustrious colleagues are not always so
willing to admit that
I have heard Mile Calve protest
that she never saw any newspaper but
the Paris Figaro and declare that she
really had not the slightest ideawhat
New York papers wrote about herShe
said this one day while waiting outside
of Maurice Grans office at theMetro
politan and then turning suddenly to
a reporter standing near her asked if he
was the man that wrote she had signed
a contract to give some concerts at
2000 a night when she was really to
receive 2200 The man did not un
derstand French so Mile Calves com
panion translated the question into
English The man replied that he rep
resented another newspaper and when
she turned this into French for Mile
Calve she mentioned the name qi the
newspaper from which she had had
translated the dreadfully erroneous
paragraph which had led the public to
believe that Mile Calve had consented
to take 200 less than she was to get
Mine Eames has an indicated in
difference for what the newspapers say
which is sometimes a little bit difficult
to reconcile with her intimate knowl
edge of what they publish about her
Mme Melba is also familiar with
them and she is a little less averse to
having that fact known than Mme
Eames is It is well known that Mme
Nordica takes her press clippings with
her coffee and she makes no bones of
it Jean de Reszke is a regular reader
of what the newspapers have tb say
about him and whatever he may think
about it in reality he never butdn one
instance took any notice of it Plancon
enjoys reading the agreeable things
that are written about him and doesnt
care who knows it Only the women
profess to bo wholly ignorant of what
the newspapers write
With the actresses the case is very
much the same The celebrated foreign
ers according to their own accounts
are quite unacquainted with anything
that the American press may write
about them Agnes Sorma said that she
did not intend to read any of the crit
icisms of her work until she started
home on the steamer It didnt take a
conversation of more than three min
utes to show that she had a fairly ac
curate knowledge of everything that
had been printed about her It must
have been some superior sort of clair
voyance that is possible only to the ar
tistic temperament for hadnt she said
that none of them would be read until
she had got on the steamer to go to Eu
rope Sarah Bernhardt has them all
translated to her and accompanies the
performance with more or less emphatic
reflections on the intelligence of the
writers who do hot agree with hex own
ideas of what she does It is said that
the atmosphere of the Hoffruaii House
was heavily charged with brimstone for
several days after Mme Sarah had the
New York accounts of ker performance
of Magda read aloud to her Jin Eng
lish When the American actors read
unfavorable accounts of themselves
they are always able to tell how they
came to be written There lftalways
some specific cause for everything unfa
vorable Either they snubbed tbj writer
accidentally or said something disagree
able about him to one of hiajfriends
There is never any esplanatiomBeyond
their bold truthfulness for the flattering
notices that appear New YofSSun
