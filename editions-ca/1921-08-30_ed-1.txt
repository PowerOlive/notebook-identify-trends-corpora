In each casereported the cruelty was wanton andwithout shadow of excuse.The first case was that of a prominent man, a former resident of thecounty, whom our informant stated,cruelly beat a fine bird dog until theanimal was almost exhausted. Thepleas of neighbors alone preventedthe animal from meeting a fate worsethan death. In another instance acolored man is said to have beaten amule until the animal was coveredwith blood and bruises. Other instances of wanton cruelty to helplessand defenseless animals have beenknown to us personally before thesecases were cited.Some kind of punishment should bometed out to these people, who usetheir strength in this wanton manner. Some years ago Paris had abranch of the Humane Society, witha Humane Officer, and for a time thesociety did good work. But at thistime its usefulness seems to have suffered a relapse and no one knowswho the authorized agent of the society is. If such an organization is nolonger in existence, it should be reformed, and authority placed in thehands of some fearless man who willsee that the offenders are arrestedand brought to justice.oLostGold watch charm, Masonic emblem encircled with wreath.

Neither theWhite House nor the Republican Congress has ever had a tax program; infact, the White House has had noprogram about anything except topay election debts and keep the partytogether. The making of the tax billhas been a matter of guess work andcatch-as-catch-can, .a matter of temporizing and grasping at straws. Thisand that have been suggested asthings to tax only to be abandoned.The lack of leadership has been painfully apparent.The trouble has been principallythat the making of the tax bill aswell as the tariff ball has been donewith only political effect in mind;the spirit of policies has ruled in amatter which should have been. considered only as an economic measure. The tax bill is designed to foolthe people, but it will not fool them;it will fool only those Republican reactionaries who have sacrificed anhonest financial policy to politicalexpediency. The very best it canaccomplish is to postpone the day ofwrath. ,The conference report on the anti-beer bill, definitely agreed on, andpresented to the Senate, exempts aman's home from search without warrant obtained in due course of lav;,but requires no warrant to searchother nronerty. provided an officeracts without malice and has reasonable cause to suspect the presence ofliquor.Along with the presentation of thereport, word reached the Senate thatprohibition leaders' of the House haddeclared there would be no recess ofCongress until the measure had bqenfinally enacted, Senate leaders, onthe other hand, announced that itwas hopeless to expect Senate acceptance in view of the rejection bythe confrees of the Stanley amendment passed unanimously, and designed to protect the home and otherproperty from indiscriminate searchthrough imposition of heavy penal'ties. The only point at issue in final deliberations of the managers was thesearching provision.
