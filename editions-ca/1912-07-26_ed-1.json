Plant Secret.
An old and experienced florist
taught me many valuable -and useful
things in regard to plants. One of hiB
tricks was that whenever he trans
planted any flower or plant he always
sifted steel filings into the new soil
before he put in the plant. He ex
plained to me that the steel filings
rusted when the soil was watered and
that the rust made the plants grow
rapidly. In the long time that I was
associated with him I never knew his
method of treatment to fail.

RESULTS BY HOPPER FEEDING
System Causes Least Trouble and Af

(By R. G. WEATHERSTONE.)
There are different methods of feed

has been said concerning the warm
mash and the good results obtained
therefrom. The hopper system is the
least trouble and with a variety of
feed placed before the birds they can
perhaps balance their own ration bet

The police will be instructed tomros
