H. Morehead and Dr. Fithiancomposed the quartette which render-1ed "Int the Hour of Trial," and"When Peace Xiike a River." Rev.Dr. B. M. Shive, pastor of the .Presbyterian Church, offeced prayer, andRev. ,W. E. Ellis, pastor of the Christian chmurch, read an appropriateScripture. lesson,followedby remarkswhich were altogether fitting, and expressive of the high esteem in whichMr. Clay was held, and of the nobility and dignity of his character.As the casket was being moved"Art Then Weary?" The body wasfollowed to the Paris cemetery by alarge concourse of relatives and-friends.As the casket was being loweredfrom the home the quartet sangto its lns resting place the quartetsang, "So ne -Day We'll Understand,"after which Rev.

Inshort he exemplified a' progressive spirit and effective generalshipin his extensive operations alongthese lines and contributed in nosmall degree to the furtherance ofthe best interests of the- county of hisnativity.A man of broad intellectual ken andwell fortified opinions Mr. Clay verynaturally became a leader in thoughtand action n this section and proveda beneficent force in public affairs.At various times during his careerhe has written articles on economicand political subjects, often anonymously, and seldom above his signature, and he has given his heart andhand ,to the articles of faith of theDemocratic party. In the past he hasgiven much service to the party inthis section of the State.In 1871 Mr. Clay was elected by tnevoters of Bourbon to -represent theBut regardless of all this, a man owes iUo himself andfamily to wear the right kind of clothes, and when you buyat this store you can appear well dressed and still not beextravagant.Our Suits and OvercoatsXATwinPRI6& & 60.

Forester,spoke before the National Conservation Congress in session at Washington, dwelling particularly on the present policies of the Government in respect to the activities vof the forestservice. Referring to the attitude ofthe present administration, as to theso-called States' rights policy, whichhas advocated JState instead of Federal control of forests, Mr. Gravessays there is no thought of anychange in the established system ofFederal ownership and control. TheForester spoke in part as follows:"The nation has an importantstake in forestry. Here as in allother countries, the real developmentof forestry began when the Government took up its practice. Even today some persons would leave theforests entirely to private owners,others insist that the public phasesof forestry are altogether a Statethis field uncalled for. Those whohold this view are usually eitherlukewarm concerning the need forforest conservation or opposed tq restricting private activities. Yet unrestricted private exploitation of forests is impossible if we continue tohave the forests that the nationneeds."National "responsibility in forestry is perfectly clear-cut. Thereneed be no confusion with an equally clear-cut responsibility of theStates. And as to private forestrylittle of value has so far been donethat has not been an outcome of pub-,lie action through State or Federlaagencies, or both. The nationalwork will always be the backbone ofAmerican forestry, not trenching onor interfering with State work ..or individual efforts, but serving as aguarantee that national needs whichStates cannot meet will be providedfor on a national scale."Underlying the forestry problemare two fundamental considerationswhich shold be emphasized and reiterated until thoroughly drivenhome. One is the public characterof forestry. Both in the matter of acontinued supply of forest productsand in that of t;he conservation ofwater resources the public welfare isat stake. Secondly, stability of policy and permanence of ownership areessential to any successful attackon this great conservation problem."I am frequently asked as If travelabout the country whether 1 am going to make important changes inforestry policy. I was asked thatvery often in 1910, when, I first tookoffice. I am asked it often this year.My answer is that what we are seeking is not change but the developmentof a permanent public enterprisewith consistent and stable policies.The national forests were set aside inthe recognition that the bulk of thelands should be handled permanentlyunder public protection and control."The aim of the present administration is not to overturn, but to takeevery possible step to' increase theefficiency of the organization, to adjust difficulties, and to advance asfast as possible the purposes forwhich the national forets were established., Secretary Houston recentlysaid to me:" 'Establish permanent boundaries.Classify your lands; segregate theagricultural land and fix right limitsfor what is needed as protective andproductive forests Develop permanent policies based on full recognition of lasting public interests, andSettled forestry practice fitted to theFORPhonographDon't LookOld Before.Your TimeWOMAN'S delicate system requiremore than ordinary care and attention more .care ard attention thanit is given by the average woman.Neglect tr and ills soon creep in, andthe look of old age, sometimes quietly,cometimes gradually follows.That backache, 'jt common amonr women, brings vrl'h it the surien chet tka"headache, tired muc!e, crow's-feet, and soon the jouthful body ia no more youth- Jfill in innoarnnnn nnrl yill hoMtflco rwf Jlf1r ? nt.tnTfin 1There is no reason -why you should be so unfortunate, -wjien you have at yourdisposal a remedy such as Dr. Piercog Favorite Prescription recommendedfor over 40 years as a 1 emedy for ailments peculiar to women.

HINTON.DEAFNESS CANNOT BE CUREDyBy local applications, as they cannot reach the diseased portions of theear. There is only one way to cure'deafness, and that is by constitutional remedies.

Some of the corporationsof which control was thus secured inlarge deals similar to the TennesseeCoal and Iron Corporation, ure certain steamship lines. The' case referred to is where the English Government's American representative seoiirp.rt with American dollars, andwent into that same Syndicate Trasury where others of past generationshave gone. These ships sail as secretsyndicate property and were put under British flag, causing considerablecriticism at the time, but it appearsthat as the ships sailed out of sightthe incident was forgotten.While the oceans are wide withmany harbors, English GevernmentSyndicate ships can be found everywhere, sailing under various corporation names, but always underthe Union Jack flag. No country onearth has contributed more ships into the Syndicate's Treasury than hasthe United States. When the constitution is upheld in every sense, theMonroe Doctrine carried out to theletter and the rights of the peopleare earnestly protected, then it willbe found that the people of this country were not permitted to 'contributeand construct the Panama Canalwithout a far-fetched purpose and design. The people of this countryhave provided and own the ships aswell as the canal. It is by the monopoly of ocean commerce and playingthe middleman between nations thatthe greatest' injustice is done to allnations, although apparently but little realized by any of them. All undertake to remedy economic evilswithin nations by temporary andlocal national legislation, instead ofgoing at the .head of the evil and adjusting matters from there downwardand outward.The Panama Canal may well beconsidered in connection with thestrings of steamships that Americanshave contributed to that syndicate! treasury. It may still oe rememoered that the Panama Canal is a .production of Americans, the same thingalso applies to the .ships. Here is acase where Americans were firstmade to produce the ships and thenthe Canal. Then comes in a corruDted European Government headingan international secret financial andpolitical syndicate and in its firstmove diplomatically dictates how theCanal should be managed.When it cbmes to considering theoperation of the Panama Canal lessons might be taken, but the operaation of the Canal should be parriedout with greater justice to all concerned than is the caes with the SuezCanaL Concerning the Suez Canalthe English Government owns firstthe "Canal," and second nearly allof the "ships," especially freightersdealing in commerce. The Governrnnnt Svndicate then makes the firstland second work hand sin hand andI puts the tolls in the Suez Canal sohsu on ail ships that it Just aboutshuts out competive steamship linesof other nations from European-Orientaltrade.' The Suez Cnal in its present formwas constructed and mostly paid forby the people of France. This wasdone by securing subscribers for largedenominations to interests in theCanal for its construction. The Latin nations of Europe invariably employed this method for raising fundsfrom the wealthier for any important undertaking.While the Latin nations employedthis system of raising funds from thewealthier classes, the English Government inaugurated the corporationand stock exchange system, forminga secret compact with the House ofRothchild heading the Jews of Europe.Out of this secret compact with theHouse of Rothchild, the present international stock exchange system wasdeveloped and is carried on withouteither government . supervision orcontrol.The stock exchange system operated by secret instruments of theEnglish Government may well becompared to that employed by theLatin nations for raising funds amongthe wealthier families. To illustratethe difference, we shall explain a few,incidents that happened in Europeimmediately after the last Presidential election in this country, afterwhich the English Government Syndicate seemed anxious to convertAmerican trust stock at high pricesInto cash and cut down its holdingsin this country. At the time the $250,000,000 deal with the Czar of Russiawas reported in Germany and Austria there was daily danger of theTriple Alliance declaring war withEngland and its auxiliary, the FrenchGovernment. The report of the $250,000,000 investment seemed to answerthe purpose of notifying the GermanvEmperor and the Triple Alliance,hat England had the aid or Russia,which ws also demonstrated byRussia's change in tactics. The report in the German and AustrianPress of the Czar's investment of$250,000,0000 in American securitieswas used as an inducement to getothers to invest in 'so-called "American Securities." Two particularinstances came to our notice wherelaboring men with small Savingswere confidentially advised by theirJewish broker-bankers to investholdings in these so-called "American Securities," which in these particular cases were corporation stock,Steel Trust stock and the stock inthree railroads, two of which werethe Union Pacific and St. Louis andSan Francisco railroads. By thismethod of classing corporation stockasstaple securities and disposing ofit at the high tide in values, all basisfor legitimate rating of interest isabolished.There were several motives forcrowding sales of American truststock. By- confidential whisperingof a prospective panic , in Germanyand Austria the stock was more read-ily disposed vof the banks were drained, foreign exchange was run up andthe- fight, was taken ou of the 'Emperor. By converting Americantrust stock into cash, the effects ofprospective tariff legislation wereevaded and at the same time theEnglish Government Syndicate wassupplied with funds mostly producedby Americans for making the Chinese,$500,000,000 and other large loans.The method employed by the English Government Syndicate to securedcomplete control of the Suez Canal,was a piece of political trickery littleshort of devilish. This control wassecured with the aid of the corrupted Rothchild French Governmentand courts. Some of the best men ofFrance who had control of the SuezCanal were led into a financial trapin connection with the first Panamaundertaking and were financiallyruined and 'socially disgraced by theHouse of Rothchild French Government and the corrupt secret syndicate courts. Among the financaiallypowerful taking such an active interest, was the British Ambassador toParis, who figured as the principal'foreign manipulator for the EnglishGovernment oynaicate in. me ouraCanal scandal and among the secret jclan, when talked about before othershe was simply referred to as "X."It was the devilish policies of thesepowerfully great before the world, bywhich the simpler people of Francewere deceived and which made it possible to cast a manufactured disgraceupon some of the best and most respected families of France. Thishappened about thirty years ago;since which time the better class ofcitizens of France, fearing fiercecontentions and manufactured disgrace have held aloof and have takenlittle active part in public affairs inFrance, thus making it possible forthe corrupted House of RothchildGovernment to serve with a freehand as an auxiliary of the EnglishGovernment.The modern deplorable spiritualand political conditions in Franceare directly tracteable and had theirorigin in- the crushing of truly patriotic and respected men of Francein connection with the English Government Syndicate's greed for securing complete control of the SuezCanal.When the contemptible methodsare understood as employed by theEnglish Government for acquiringcomplete cpntrol of the Suez CanaLand by this means of the Orient, thenit may be understood why the surmounting of almost impossible obstacles in constructing the PanamaCanal was made feasible. Carefulconsideration of international conditions in the world as well as leadersi iix niiiiiei s ui iiiituiue auu. uuiiuueiut:.yrhe Panama Canal opens a new gateway between the old world of Europeand the Qrient, with America by thechanged conditions as the main baseof operations. Divine Providenceevidently never intended that thePanama Canal should be either usedor controlled by the dull, deceptivegovernment of a little Europeanisland.F. X. WINSCHEUK.SUGGESTIONS LOOKING TO ATime-Saving and Effective LegislativeProgram.Eycept the long session of 1892-3,mainly occupied, in adapting the statute laws to the present constitution,the cbming session of the 'GeneralAssembly, on account of the embarrassed condition of the State Treasury and the revision of our fiscal system to meet this and future conditions, and to adapt its methods to therecently adopted amendment to theconstitution, and other pressing matters, will likely be the most important one held in a generation. Withall this work in view, with the limitations of a sixty-day session" in mind,and in the light of many years otcareful observation of legislativemethods at our own and other StateCapitals and at Washington, the following outline of procedure is respectfully suggested for the consideration of members.1. That a caucus of the Democratic members of the House be calledby the proper authorities to meet inFrankfort not latei than the middleof December, for the purpose ofnominating all of the officers of thatbody. As such nominations wouldbe equivalent to an election, 'thiswould enable the Speaker, after suchconsideration of the membership asmay be possible, to frame and announce the committees and for theorganization to be completed andready for work on the first day of 1the session. This caucus in advancewould involve little extra trouble orexpense to members, as most of themwill go to Frankfort within the nextfew weeks to select their seats or onother business, and they can easilymake one trip answer for all thesepurposes. No such advanced caucus would be necessary for the Senate, as the presiding officer of thatbody had already been selected andthe announcement of the committeesand completion of the organizationcould be easily effected in one day.2. Such a change in rules as 'willsubstitute for the tedious and timeconsuming "bill days," which haveheretofore taken up a large part oftwo days of each Aveek, the provision that bills may be introduced atany time when the House is in session by simply dropping them in, alocked receptacle at the Speaker'sdesks, as is done in Congress and inmany other States. This would enable that officer to take the bills tohis room for such consideration oftheir subject matter as may be necessary for their proper reference.3. That all bills shall be referredto the committees having charge ofthe matters to which they relate,without suggestion from their authorsor- other members from the floor orgreatest and most obvous evil in permitting the authefr of a bill to selectthe committee to 'which it shall go,this -change of rules will go a longway in protecting the Speaker frompersonal importunity of the appearance of discourtesy on this point, andprevent the reference to and consid-leration of two or more bills on thesame subject by different committees, Avith the confusion, lpssof timeand pubile danger inseparable from- - r. sa custom which, should have beensince abandoned, and which has beenabandoned almost everywhere elsej4. - That the House shall meet anHour or more earlier than in the past,the time thus gained and the earlydays of the session, so far as may be,to be devoted to the reference andfirst reading of bills. Few committee meetings are held in the morning,and, especially since the increase ofthe per diem to $10.00, it shauld beno hardship for business men, or forany other man serving his people ina representative capacity or enoughaccount to be there, to observe whatare considered ordinary buiness hoursat home.5. We should be just before weare generous, and, with the idea thatthe same rigid business principlesshould obtain in public as in privateaffairs, and that, while each department or worthy activity of the Stateshould have its fair proportion of the'available revenues, no expense shouldbe incurred without providing tunasto meet it the appropriation committee shall in effect be made a "Budget Convmittee," to which shall be referred all bills and resolutions containing appropriations, or involving,expense, before they can come up forfinal action.6. That bills shall be printed inthe order in which they are introduced and, under such penalties aswill get results, copies of every billshall be on the desk of members notless than five days after their reference. 7. That, except upon a majorityor two-thirds vote, no bill shall beintroduced after twenty days of. thesession has expired, and that at theend of thirty legislative days, if itthen appears that- the work, of thesession would be enhanced by suchaction, both Houses shall adjourn fora month and then re-convene. Thiswould give opportunity for hearingson all important" bills probably forthe passage of some of them beforethe recess and for such a leisurelystudy of, and for conference withspecially informed constituents about,all pending measures during the recess as should be most advantageous. 8. That Kentucky, and especiallyits General Assembly, has had enuoghof personal and factional policies toJ last a long time, and efforts to injectthe aspirations or canoiaacy or individuals or factions for future preferment, upon what should be astrictlybusiness session, will be looked uponwith disfavor.Such a program as is here outlinlined, modified as may seem best after full discussion and criticism,ought to go a long way in securingample time for the sane and orderlyconsideration of every importantmeasure to come before the session,wihout the rush and confusion of thepast, which have often proven sodangerous to the interests of the people, and for which an antiquated, vicious system rather than individualsis to be blamed.The legal questions involved in theI proposed adjournment and all the other changes have been submitted to,and passed upon favorably by the Attorney General. The suggestions aremade purely in the public interest,and, in the light of the work to bedone, are at least entitled to earnestconsideration. There is no pride ofopinion back of them, and if someother member will propose a betterplan it ought to be favored instead.Rubber shipments from FederatedMalay States have totaled 4.772,800pounds 100 per ecnt. increase overJanuary, 1912.

Henry Detmers writes a littlearticle entitled "A New Cure ForDrink." Mr. Detmers says that he hasbeen in the saloon business for twentyyears. He is not a drinker himselfand none of his sons drink. Out ofhis experience he recommends thefollowing cure for the liquor habit:"I found early in my experienceexceptions of course that regularconsumers of fruit was not a verygood customer in my business. Onthe other hand, a typical 'booze fighter' seldom touches fruit. I alwayskept some apples behind thebar formy own use, and J often experimentally offered one to a 'star customer,' who almost invariably refused. The more I looked into thismatter, the more firmly I became convinced that these two habits clash.Not caring to have my boys acquirethe one I inoculated them with theother, and I have found that the fruithabit early acquired acts as a perfectantidote to the liquor habit."I mention apples especially because they are something like bread,one never tires of them, . which ismore than can be said of peaches,pears and oranges. And, apples,thanks to cold storage , can be hadevery day of the' school year."Why shouldn't the apple habit becultivated in the public schools atpublic expense? School trusteescould advertise for bids to supply theschool. Then by .means of a push-the-buttoncontrivance placed at theboys' and girls' exits each child (could get his or her apple as theymarched out to play at recess time.Two apples a day would do the work.Children have a veritable craving forfruit. I have often heard our victims beg another for the 'core.' Andif it happens that I have merely imagined that the fruit habit offsets thedrink habit, I know that two apples aday will have a valued influence onthe health, good temper ' and moralsof 'the child."Please understand that I have oax to grind, I do not own a single ap-jpie tree.I have never claimed to have' discovered that fruit juices act as aliquor antidote, although I have talked it for twenty-five years.Some three years ago an articleappeared which claimed a Nebraskaphysician as the discoverer of the.theory. The good doctor and I willnever quarrel over it. He can havethe glory. I do not need it. I amonly too glad to see that ;my viewshave gained some scientific backing."If you remove the desire for drinkthe liquor question will solve itself,and while poverty may. not- be banished 'the general welfare of the peo-Ten DaysMISSESDEFTand Mainpie will be much improved. Andeven if my scheme is never adopted Iwill feel a thousand times repaid formy pains if I can only convince themothers of our country that thosewho have the means to do so, that toimplant the fruit habit in their children is the best assurance for a temperate "Ufe."Nay, Nay! ,A young gambler had just asked herto be "his'n," and the maidv popped herhead in the room and said: "Did youcall, sir?"
