Another Prompt Settlement by
Rudolph Davis Insurance
Agency.
Lexington, Ky., January 10, 1913.
'Mr. Rudolph Davis, Agent.
Dear Sir 1 wish to compliment you
on the manner in which you. and the
Travelers 'Liability Insurance Co.
handled the claim against me. I wish
to state in this letter, to whom it may
concern, that I have had six years ex
perience with automobile liability in
surance and never have I had the
prompt service irom any company that
I have received from yours.
Twelve hours after I reported the
accident to you you had your adjuster
from Louisville in Lexington and the
claim was settled and certainly believe
that there is no company handling this
sort of business from whom I could
have received such service.
Any time that I may say agoodword
for the Travelers Liability Insurance
Co., and my friend, Mr. R. Davis, you
can be assured that I will do it. Wish
ing you the prosperous business of the
coming year that you deserve, I am

for dispelling weakness, nervousness,
