Englishvessel having proceeded on her routs abit of paper is slipped into Ardiek s handby one of the sailors This is found to be awarning of a mutiny plot headed by Pradey the ne innate Ardiek

onlyavaailable boat The captain supercargoand second mate soon discover their plightbut hastily constructing a raft get awayJust before their vessel sinksCHAPTER VIIOF THE GREAT STRAIT WE FOUNDOURSELVES IN AND HOW THATSUBTLE ROGUE THE MATE SEEMEDSTILL TO TRIUMPHBy this time some showing of whatthe captain had prophesied as to achange of weather began to appearThe sun was now pretty high Imt itdid not strike dow D ith its usual heatthin whitish almost imperceptiblehaze floating between and presentlyI noticed that the northern sea linewas a little darkened so that the horizon itself was not so sharply cut as ithad been The air too had a changedfeeling a little damper as I might sayand with more of the ocean smell in it1 now surmised that we weretocatcha bit of a blow though not a hurricane and thai the wind would presently shift to the north What sort ofbusiness we could make of it Heavenonly knew and it was with no littlestirring of apprehension that I finallygave over my studying And directeda more general look a ound The longboat was still traveling southwest andno other sail was to be seen There wasthe same easy sea not so deeply blueas before the thin veil came over thesun but raising scarcely a crest andswinging and sinking in diminishingwater hitlo and valleys The raftclimbed up and -did down in the fashinn that such a contrivance must dashing 8 bit of spray over us now andthen but yet making some headwayand in this sort we continued for perhaps two hours By that time we hadall thought it best to get into our oilskins Mr Tym likewise discarding hiswi and in lieu of it drawing on a littleknit cap like a nightcap and when atlast it was quite a bit past noon T gotout and served dinner Of course ithad to be eaten eohk but we added alittle brandy and it relished well andafter this nothing happened till earlynightThe wind had swung a little into thenorth giving token of what was to beexpected and the sea was coming upa bit but as yet hid made no headsof dangerous size The sun was settingred but with a topping of gray cloudsand the air was growing chilly thoughit could not yet be called cold I sweptthe sea Hue once more for a sail butwithout success whereupon feelingweary and a bit discouraged I flungmyself down and drew a piece of canvasover me I heard Mr Tym stir aboutn little I say heard for I had coveredmy head for the moment and presently knew that he had gone aft torelieve the captain at the helm I hada strange sort of quiet secure feelingcome over me then in a way as thoughI had no further care of this businessand scarce needed- to feel fear and in amoment I was lapsing from that intoa drowse 1 was called back to myselfby a loud tone of talking and on throw-in-back the canvas round Mr Tym andthe captain on their feet and lookingwith great seeming of eagerness toward some point in he western seaboard I flung the canvas wholly fromme and sprang upThe sea had darkened even in thefew moments 1 had been under the canvas ami only a pale lemon coloredstreak in the west remained of thesunset The raft canted and made itsdownward slide just as I got steadiness of my legs and I could only whiskmy eye so to speak over the shoulderof the crest before we had droppedinto the duskiness of the hollow ButL rTHE BOURBON NEWS PA1US KY ERIDAY APRIL 21 1899in that glimpse I saw what it was thatmy companions had discovered Againstthe yellow western band stood out ablack dot which could only be a sailMy heart gave a great jump and Icould have shouted but in the end Icontented myself with saying two orthree times profoundly ThankGod and with that stood quietly onmy straddled legs waiting for the nextrise of the raft My companions hadgiven over their talking and seemedto be holding themselves in patienceas I was only that I think Mr Tymspoke to me as I stood about for mybalance and so drew his notice Theraft swung to the top of the crest andas it tipped for the next slide we alllooked eagerly for the black dotThere it was as distinct as ever andbeyond any manner of doubt the narrow-wiseview of a ship We cried outin a kind of cheer and I then fell toasking with eagerness how long shehad been in sightI raised her but a moment sinceanswered the captain She showedfirst as you see her and must thereforebe bows on But pray you pass memy glass and I will see what furthercan be made of herT hastened to fetch his glass from hisbox of instruments and when the nextlift of the raft was he brought it tobearMr Tym and I hung on his wordsfor it was an anxious moment andpresently felt a vast relief when hebroke outYes a large ship and bows on Shecan scarce be above four or five milesaway and o she does not change hercourse should fetch up to -within anhourI could not rest rain a step or two ofa sailors shuffle tit this great wasmy delight and Mr Tym smiledLet us have down the sail pursued the captain for now it does usno good and puts us to the labor olsteering1 perceived with this that the windhad indeed hauled much to the northand was therefore driving us continually to leeward I jumped to thesail and shut it up to the mast andwhipped the sheet round it J3y thistime quite sharp airs were blowingand the heads of the seas had come upin a sort to fling the spray in smallshowers over us We did not muchheed this and drew together in themiddle of the raft and while we keptan eye out for the ship continued ourdiscourseI mistrust she is a Spaniard saidthe captain She may well come fromthe Florida coast1 wish you might be wrong said Ifor the Spanish have no love for us atthis time There has been too muchdoing by the buccaneersYet we could speak them fair saidMr Tym and if pushed to it compound with them in some small manner of ransom I could raise a sumgiven a little timeMarry said I quite with a lightheart for the prospect of escape hadflown like wine into my head I amfor them ransom or no ransom Better a living slave than a dead sailorY continued to use the glass byturns and to discuss the thing till atlast we hod raised the ship to her hullShe was standing fairly toward us allher sails including topgallant sailsspread and looked to be a large lightfloating craftShe has bow ports said the captain who had the glas though theyare scarce visible as she is paintedNay but we must lose no more timelet her be what she may Take apiece of this canvas Master Aruickand display it from the mastI speedily had a distress flag flyingShe sees us cried Mr Tym whohad the glass There is a line ofIn ads along the forward bulwarkshe went on and a fellow with a telescope is climbing the fore riggingShe came along fast her yards allbut square and studding sails hungout aloft Her tall bows sent up agreat boiling of white which shearedsmoothly right and left as she camenearer though with many plumes ofspray and in this gallant style shestormed down till at last being buta gunshot off she clewed up some sailput down her helm and with her longbroadside swung around came drifting down upon usA man in dark attire with a trumpetin his hand climbed a few feet up themain riggingNow we shall know what nation sheis said apt Sellinger but fromthat steeple of a poop and the poorawkward ordering of those yards sheshould be SpanishSo indeed it seemed to prove Theman presently Iwiled and the speechwas SpanishRaft ahoyBoard the ship bellowed backthe captain Nay but I can go nofurther he said with a laugh I havescarce any Spanish Do you finish thebusinessHe addressed me and T sprang upand stood in his room The ship hadrapidly drifted down and was alreadywithin a hundred or a hundred andfifty yards The man in the riggingshouted If you would board us taketo your oars Be speedy or you willfall shortCHAPTER VIIIOF OUR RECEPTION ON THE SPANISHSHIPI saw that this was the case andlikewise feared that he might be ofthat cruel or indifferent sort thatwould leave us in the lurch if we failedWherefore I let fall the talk with himand hurriedly told the others how thematter stood The ship was not dead towindward but in the course she wasnow traveling stood to pass us about40 or 50 yards to the south and it wasto cover this gap that we must rowWe fell to it though it was but a poorpiece of work the raft being so clumsyand at last drew pretty nigh the shipsbow It was rioing and falling at greatheights above us but a seaman appeared on the boltsprit and at theright moment cast us a line I caughtit and made it fast and we quicklywarped as near as we dared to thelofty side The bulwark above us wasnow black with heads and a dark fellow in a kind of Dutch rig raised himself on the rail and from there directed us how to proceed The fore chainswere too nearly under the toweringhouse of a foredeck to serve our turnand the captain seemed too indifferentto put over a ladder wherefore wewere presently drawn along till wewere near amidships where indeed wemight make shift to scramble up Thiswe did first tying on our backs sucharticle of value as we eared to preserve and when we were over the sidethe raft was cast adrift We then putdown our burdens and with no littleinterest and anxiety fetched a lookabout usI may have been a bit confused fora moment for I find I got nothing thatsticks in my memory in that firstglance Hut presently I bring back acrowded deck most of the faces beingdark and some persons in handsomeattire standing a little way from thecompanion and for general surroundings a short flush waist of the shippoop and foredeck like little castlesand overhead a great but not overneatand shipmanliks spread of spars andsails Immediately a tall dark man inrough brown clothes a wide flappinghat and Flemish boots pushed out ofthe press and I recognized the personwho had held the trumpetIf you please Senor Captain saidI stepping to tko front and touchingmy hat we three arc escaped fromthe English ship Industry which wasscuttled and sunk Prom here I wenton and gave him the other chief outlines of our st ory He listened withou1comment and when I had finishedmade a sign to one of his officers andmm-ordered the ship put upon her courseHe then turned back to us and fromhis cold and rather stem expression Iwas not expecting a very agreeabVe orhospitable answer when there wassome stir in the crowd and tho se infront stepping aside a tall and statelylooking gentleman tame deliberatelvforward He was a- one would guessabout five-and-fifty years of age andwas comely in the face but thinthough sturdy and upright in figureHis dress fraS uncommonly rich andwas the most showy and striking I hadseen pp to that timeI bowed low somewhat impressed byhis elegance and waited with an air ofdeference for him to speak I doubtednot he was some rich grandee and vervI IVI fiPvx4tLjj vVvETTay A1r iXOi i ctilaw-97-Jt r1 VJI lLHffc r - f -You hav6 forfeited your libertylikely the owner of the ship and cargoHe looked at me coldly yet with somecuriosity and after a brief glance atmy companion said in choice SpanishWho are you senor and how didyou come upon the raftI repeated what I had told the captain though with some enlargementAs 1 proceeded I saw his brow darkenespecially at the mention that we wereEnglish1 grieve senor to find that you andyour friends belong to that nation ofheretics and robbers he said in asevere voice Pray upon what business was your ship and what was shedoing in these watersI perceived the dangerous thing thatwas in his mind and suffered no delayin answeringWhy your lordship I replied Iclapped this title to him at a ventureour ship was a peaceful merchantman and her business was to conveya cargo of English cloths and smallwares to Havana and fetch sugarpices and the like thither Our captain can give vou more of this matterAnd where think you went yourescaping mutineers he inquiredwithout pauseThis disconcerted me a bit but I feltit best to out with the truthTo join that scoundrel Morgan ifour guess is not greatly at fault Ilet go boldlyHe smiled in a grim fashionAye senor such was my thought ofthe matter They have gone to jointhat child of perdition doubtless andsome good Spanish blood may be shedIn consequence What think you hewent on looking at me fixedly shallI not be doing my sovereign and thichurch a service if I endeavor to discharge a small measure of this debtI began to think that we had fallenout of the frying pan into the fire forI was at no loss to guess what hemeant Nevertheless I was resolvednot to quail and indeed it was possible he might be only trying me Icollected myself therefore and answered himA debt your lordship should bepaid by the debtor and not by him whohas no part in it The Spanish bloodyou speak of was not shed by me or bymy comrades We abhor piracy andevery such lawless doingThe hidalgo nodded but I could notsee that I had produced any measurable impression on him It was ananxious moment and I discerned thatmy companions had detected something amiss and come closer though icould not than give heed to theinWell senor he replied at lastthere is reasou in what you say andI am not disposed to deal with youharshly Nevertheless here his lookhardened again and my spirits sankI cannot forget that you are Englishmen If you yourselves have done mycountrymen no harm neither had theSpaniards of Puerto Rico and Maracaibo done the English harm Yourlives are safe but vou have forfeitedvour libertv and on vour arrival atPanama will be sold as slaves Youmay go forward for the present andserve with the crewHe nodded tft signify that he had concluded and with the same stately precision as at first passed in among thecrowd and made his way out of sightI was in a measure dumfounded andstood where he had left me trying tograsp the full purport of what had befallen Cast into slavery and by thepeople of a Christian nation Whatworse would it have been had we fallenamong the heathen Algerines I wasaroused from this overwhelmed stateby the voice of Mr Tym and turningabout acquainted both him and thecaptain with what had passedSlaves to the dons is it said Sellinger when I had finished A middling hard port to steer into after allthat has befallen us The greasy lobscourers I hope we shall manage toput a trick or two upon them before weare done To think of such tallow headsmaking slaves of free born EnglishmenWe had time for only a few wordsfurther for soon one of the officersthe boatswain as I presently discovered came along and ordered us topick up our tilings and follow him tothe forecastle This we accordingly didI carrying the supercargos box toshow him that much respect thoughhe tried to dissuade me On the wayI took some thought of the people aboutme not having till now observed themwith particularity and found that mostsave a few in armor who seemed tobe

dispatchof Tuesday was the first knowledgethe department had that the Yorktown had gone on a special mission to relieve the Spanish garrison at Baler That the captureshould have been effected while theAmerican forces were on a mission ofmercy toward the Spaniards ratherthan in the prosecution of a campaignled to the belief that Spain would haveno further ground for questioning thegood faith with which the Americanswere seeking to relieve the conditionof the Spanish prisonersAlthough the dispatch gave no indication that Lieut Gilmoreand bis menhad lost their lives yet great anxietywas aroused by the mystery surrounding their fate while in the hands of anuncivilized enemy This is the firstcapture of amy Americans military ornaval so that it is unknown how theinsurgents will treat our men If civilized methods were pursued an exchangecould be quickly effected as Gen Otishas a large number of Filipino prisoners but the insurgents have beenaverse thus far to exchanging Spanishprisoners and

Porto Ricoand to send three regiments now inthis country to the Philippines as soonas they can be equipped and transported there though it is not believedthat they will reach Manila for two orthree months It is also stated thatthe conditions in Cuba are such that itis quite probable some troops can bewithdrawn from that island for services in the PhilippinesThe matter of returning the volunteers

plowing clay lands nearly all theadvantages of under draining can beobtained by back furrowing into narrow beds and by leaving a strip twoor three feet wide between the bedsunplowed It practically does awaywith the trouble of gullying by heavyrains as there are two channels insteadof one to carry off the water No perceptible difference in growth for yieldor crop can be seen in the dead furrowsafter being put in with modern improved implements and there is a saving of four furrows in plowing eachland or bed two in the middle of thebed and two at the dead furrow Thegreat advantage of back furrowing overlevel culture when plowing is donein the fall is that very often crops canbe sown several weeks earlier makinga fine crop and a good catch of grasswhen later sowing would fail

northwestern Texas and Oklahoma are keeping pace with modernimprovements and are no longer to beisolated from the rest of the worldA few months ago the ranchmen ofSeward county Kan met to propose aplan of connecting their ranches bytelephone facilities utilizing the barbwire fences instead of setting poles andstringing wires It had been demonstrated that a fence wire worked perfectly for a telephone connection Thescheme was favored by the stockmenand a local company was formed withheadquarters at Liberal that being thenearest telegraph pointLines have since been constructedand are in operation extending fromLiberal over the whole of Seward Stevens and Morton counties Kan andhave reached out into Heaver county0 T and Hansford county Tex Manyof the ranches in this ideal grazingcountry are situated miles from railroad and telegraph facilities Some ofthe owners arc compelled to travel 50miles to reach shipping points Thuswill be quickly seen the greal advantage to be derived from this enterprising move It not only affords theman opportunity to transact businessamong themselves but they have arranged to iet market quotations dailyfrom the telegraph station This information is invaluable to the cattlekingsIn addition to the lines now in operation further extensions are to be madeThe success of the wire fence telephone first established between Liberaland
