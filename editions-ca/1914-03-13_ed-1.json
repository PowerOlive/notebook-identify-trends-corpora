At the regular meeting of the
Council on March 4, Mr. R. M. Cald
well, correspondent for the News,
went before the Council, asking for an
ordinance to prohibit the fowls from
Tunning at large upon the streets.
As the hour was late before the mat
ter could be taken up and the Council
"had other important business on hand
and was not put in any definite form.
Of course a great majority of the cit
izens since then Jiave learned what
was done, and some exceptions have
been taken to it. This is due to the
foct that the people do not undersand
the nature of the ordinance. No or
dinance will be introduced which will
prohibit the owning or raising of
I fowls within the corporate limits of
Millersburg. The ordinance which
wil be presented at the next regular
meeting of the Council is that fowls
must be kept in enclosures on the
premises of those by whom they are
owned and not allowed to run at large
on the streets. Within the past few
years many of our citizens have re
moved their fences. Their lawns and
flower beds are exposed to everything
that travels the streets, and this ordi
nance is only intended to keep the
fowls off the premises. There are
now and wre last summer many run
ning at large in various parts of the
town. Within a few days the ordi
nance will be drafted and all interest
ed will be called upon to sign a peti
tion. This is dene at the solicitation
of many of our citizens, who are in
every way interested in the good of
the town, and who have done much to
imake the town what it is.

DODGE.
Mrs. Rebecca Kenney Dodge,
aged 79 years, died at her home on
the North Middletown pike, near this
city, at ten o'clock, Monday evening,
following a twelve days' illness.
The death of Mrs. Dodge resulted
from a fall received about two weeks
ago, dislocating her hip. She was
about 79 years of age arid had been
in declining health for some time,
and these facts made her recovery
from the fall very doubtful from the
vrst. So that her passing was not
unexpected, though the news of her
death was a shock to her many
friends. Mrs. Dodge was the widow
of the late David D-age, to whom she
was married in May, 1861. Four
children were born to this union,
three of whom survive: Mrs. Charles
Dodge and Mr. Victor Dodge, both of
Lexington, and Mr. Jas. L. Dodge, of
Paris, who resided with his mother.
Another son, Mr. Mills Dodge, died
in Lexington several years ago. Mrs.
Dodge was a half-sister of Mr. Millard
F. Kenney, of this city, and was a
teacher in the Sunday school as long
as she was physically able to attend.
The funeral was held at the Pres
byterian church Wednesday morning
at 11 o'clock, and was largely attend
ed. Her pastor, Rev. Dr. B. M. Shive.
paid a beautiful and richly-Tleserved
tribute to her memory, taking the
word "Mother" for the subject of his
remarks.
Mrs. Dodge was one of the most
prominent and beloved women in
Bourbon county, and will be sadly
missed, especially in the home and in
the Presbyterian church, of which she
was a faithful and active member.
Those from a distance who attend
ed the funeral were her daughter,
Mrs. Charles Blakely, of Topeka,
Kansas; Mr. and Mrs. Victor K.
Dodge, Mr. Joseph B. Kenney, Mrs.
Emma Hicks, Mr. and Mrs. Thornton
Moore, Mr. and Mrs. John Marr, Mr.
