"The Ladder of Lies"
A PARAMOUNT ARTCRAFT PICTURE
What did the cynic who wrote "Lies
in a Woman's Eyes'" know a woman's
heart?
See this great -romance of a girl who
lived a lie for anotner, a girl who sacrificed
her love and her own good name that
another's' love, another's home, might not
be shattered.
i A story as powerful as Ethel Clayton's
"Young Mrs. Winthrop," as appealingly
intimate as her "Thirteenth Command
ment." all brightened with smiles, crowded
with action, and crowned with a joyous
ending.
