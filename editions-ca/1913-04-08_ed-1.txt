JUDYFor JailerJOSEPH FARRISNew Nickel Rogues.Word has reached the Treasury Department that its chaste, new five centpieces, the glorified nickels, adornedwith buffalo and Indian head, are already the subject of emulation andsuspicion, says the New York Sun.Before the public in general has hadtime,ror opportunity to I become acquainted with the original enterprisinggentlemen have begun to issue imitations, similar in every respect save theinconvenient one that they are composed of lead. It is possible that thoseresponsible for these counterparts aresimply esthetic souls who have beenunable to wait for the new nickel tocome Jo lhem in due couise, and whoseonly motive is thedeEire to feast theireyes on 'the- artietic splendor of thenew design. The secret service bureau, however, inclines to the beliefthat they are counterfeiters pure andsimple,and actuated by reasons entirely worldly and financial.Removing Bad Impression.During the textile strike aud theaccompanying rioting and other lawlessness inLawrence, Mass., a year orso ago, that city received a largeamount of free advertising of an unenviable character.Lawrence, to be sure, has its goodpoints, its advantages and attractions,but the public did not hear anythingof these while the city was strugglingwith strike conditions. Since quietwas restored some or the good citizens' have been discussing ways and meansof removing the bad impression thatwas made on the country at large.(Jut of the discussion at least one novel idea was evolved. Soraecne offeredthe suggestion that the children of theseventh and eighth grades of thegrammar schools write short letters tothe editors of the newspapers and tothe superintendents of schools all overthe United States giving their viewsof Lawrence and of the strike whichbrought the city so much notoriety.The plan found favor with teachersand pupils and more than one thousandsuch letters bave been written. Ifnothing more should be accomplishedthe letters will convince those whoreceive them that Lawrence is notwholly comDosedof .strikers, thugs andtoughs, as they might have inferredfrom reading the press dispatches ayear ago; that thejnty is making progress educationally and otherwise andthat no traveler need fear to passthrough town, or even to stop overnight. The epistolary effort is commendable and with good behavior inthe future Lawrence should be able tooutliwe themalidoroua publicity of thepast.Modern Methods,Welding two pieces'of metal together by the old processes was at bestunreliable. When -the strain on thewelded joint was heavy, you neverknew whether it was going to hold ornot. But with the use of electricityin making the weld, the fiber of thetwopieces or metal are made t o flowinto each ott.er and so become practically one pieqe. The success of thisnew method was recognized at once,and now you have hardly a tool orpiece of machinery on your farm butwhat is electrically welded wherethere is a juncture of metals. Thepresent state of perfection of gardenand barnyard tools, mowers, reapers,binders, threshers, cultivators, kitchenutensils, dairy machinery, edge tools,chains, automobile engines and steering gears, bottoms of oil caas. framesof bicycles, etc., is made possiblethrough electric welding. The sameprocess produces "Pittsburg Perfect"electrically welded wire fencing, madeby the Pittsburg Steel Company,whose adevrtisements are Dpearingregularly in this paper. "PittsburgPerfect" fencing is a solid, one niecefabric with many distinctive advantages.among them being the ease withwhinh it is strung, the great tensionto which it can be stretched becauseof the absolute elimination of "long"and "short" line wires, the smoothsurface making wire-cuts impossible,and the neat appeal ance of the fence.The welded joints in "Pittsburg Perfect" are twice as strong as the wireitself, because two wires are made into one by electricity, which also pilesthe galvanizing around the joints, adding greatly to the life of the fence.Modern methods of manufacture inmany lines have been greatly benefited bv the discovery and practice ofwelding by electiicity.For rheumatism you will find nothing better than Chamberlain's Liniment.

The author says that with intelligent handling there is practicallyno danger, and excellent results aresecured after a little practice. Following is an extract:"Only about twenty-five per cent ofthe entire land area in the UnitedStates is improved farm land, yet wealready hear the wail of new settlersand would-be.Iandowners, who find improved farms too expensive for theirlimited capital, and who claim thatunimproved farm land is more thenscarce. Statistics, however, show thatJin Michigan and Wisconsin nearly fiftyper cent ot the land is :t II in the unimproved class and can De purchasedat a very cheap rtte. This unimprovedland consists mostly of cut over timberlands, lands containing a secondgrowth of timber and rocky lands toorough to be profitably woriced."Only those who have tried to clearsuch land by the use of explosivesknow how efficient the method is andwhat a great time and labor saver itis compared to the primitive man,hore and machinery method. Theexplosive method is of especial inteiest to new settlers and those of limited capital because it requires no largeinitial outlay of money, and eyerycent invested can be immediately usedfor the purpose of clearing up thefarm. Beisdes this, if properly handled explosives are as safe as the machinery method. Explosives will doas good work in clearing land as themost expensive machinery arid generally at less total cost."In GirlhoodWOMANHOOS) &?MOtfHESHEOOSa!mi:w?M:',v!AiL&!JhelnpflAssist Naturenow and then,with a gentlecathartic Dr.Pierce's PleascndPellets tone2ip and invigorate liver andbowels.

Thebody was caught on a submerged treein the water.The features of the boy were almostobliterated, decomposition having setin, and the long period the bodv hadbeen in the water rendered it almostbeyond recognition.The accident which cost the boy hislife occurred on the afternoon of Friday. March 14, while he and an olderbrother were riding alung the creekbank in the rear of his father's placeon the Colville pike, near Millersburg.In some manner the youth slippedfrom the back of the horse he waB riding and fell into the stream, which,swollen by a heavy rain, was veryswift.

Doubtful of his?ability to get a message to Detroitthrough the regular channels, D. B.Richardson, Mexico City, representative of the Studebaker Corporation,,has arrived at the automobile company's headquarters, making his way outofjthe "Sister Republic by a deviousroute, on a journey that consumedmore than twice the usual scheduletime. His purpose was to secure anadditional shipment of cars to meetthe abnormal demand which sprangrup as soon as theDiaz-Huerta government was established in power.Mr. Richardson's report of commercial conditions in Mexico will be reassuring to all American manufacturers."For some time prior to the revolution." he says, "business had heen almost'at a standstill, due to the beliefthat the Madero government was notfirmlv established. As soon as thebombardment was finished, there was:a resumption of confidence. Within aweek we had disposed of every automobile we had instock in addition tothree carloads of Studebaker '25' and'35' cars tnat arrived during the bombardment but could not be unloaded 'until it was over. I believe that ourexperience was reflected by that ofthe otljer dealers. Particularly wasthis true, aftei our supply had beenexhausted."Mr. Richardson wpnt through someexciting adventures during the fighting. His place of business was alternately within the lines of Madero andDiaz, though protected from artilleryfire by higher structures on threesides. In visiting it during the bombardment he had several narrow escapes, being compelled at one tiraa totake shelter behind a low wall of masonry that was hit many times bv riflefire. He also acted as the personalchauffeur of Paul Hudson, editor ofthe Mexican Herald, and carried himabout the zone of action in a Studebaker "30."While maintaining a strictly neutralattitude, Mr. Richardson deeply regretted the death of Gen. Ruiz, whowas captured in the first attack on theNational palacerand was promptly executed. Gen. Ruiz was a "live prospect" and was onlv waiting to see aStudebaker "35" before buying.Three Studebaker "20" deliverycars, owned by the postal service, distinguished themselves, carrving ammunition first for the governmentand then, after their capture, for therevolutionists.Mr. Richardson exuects to return toMexico City as soon as "traffic conditions in Mexico will permit his gettingthrough with a trainload of automobiles. adv.The best automobile insurance. 4-3t RUDOLPH DAVIS,.Notice to Dairymen.It is the order of the Cily Board offHealth, that owners of cows, who arefurnishing milk to the trade, musthave their herds examined, accordingto the State law and apply to the Secretary of the Board for a certificatelicensing the sale of their products.The law is strict in this matter.

COURT HOUSEUSE. 1MISS PECKHAM'S BEAUBy BLANCHE HARPER."Miss Peckham has a beau' announced Mrs. Bennett, breathlessly,to the women who were gatheredaround the bridge table."You -don't say so!" exclaimed Mrs.Holman. "Who is he?""The new boarder," replied Mrs.Bennett. "He's the tall young manwho sits at the middle table. He tooka great fancy to Miss Peckham thevery day he came. I'm so glad! MissPeckham is one of the finest womenat the Brownstone, and it certainly isa shame that she never had & beaubefore.""Never had a beau!""Never!" repeated Mrs. Bennett,impressively. "She admitted it tome in confidence one day. I intendto help her along all I can and seethat she lands Mr. Weed, for she deserves a good husband.""I should say she does!" agreedone of the other women. "Let's allput in a good word for her, and thenif she doesn't land him it won't beour fault."That evening after dinner Mrs.Bennett was sitting on the frontporch of the Brownstone alone whenyoung Weed, made his appearance."Good evening, Mr. Weed," chirped the gopher eyed Mrs. Bennett."How do you like the Brownstone?" "Very much indeed, Mrs. Bennett.The food is good and I find the people pleasant.""I'm so glad to hear you say so,Mr. Weed. . I've lived here four years,and I am very fond of all the peoplehere, especially the young ladies. Wehave such lovely young ladies here,don't you think so?""Yes, yes, indeed," young Weed replied nervously. A bachelor can neverbe too wary."I think Miss Peckham is an especially fine girl," Mrs. Bennet wenton. "She is perfectly splendid andshe makes the best things in a chafingdish you ever tasted."Mrs. Bennett glanced out of the corner of her alert brown eyes to seethe effect her speech was having uponyoung Weed. He was plainly moved,for he fingered his cane nervously andhurried down the steps, murmuringsomething about an engagement.The next morning MrB. Holmes metyoung Weed in the hall on his way tobreakfast."Good morning, Mr. Weed. Lovelymorning, isnt' it?""Fine, fine," agreed young Weed,standing politely aside for Mrs.Holman to pass, but that designingperson moved not at all."Too bad this isn't a holiday. Itwould be such a lovely morning toplay golf. You know, Miss Peckhamis an expert golfer, and you shouldchallenge her to a game some finemorning.""Yes?" spoke young Weed, inquiringly, reddening a trifle. "I am notmuch of a golfer myself.""Then you should have Miss Peckham take you in hand and teach you,"insisted Mrs. Holman. "I'm sure shewould love to. She is so accommodating! And she has such a perfect disposition! Really, Mr. Weed you shouldknow her better."Young Weed succeeded in drivingMrs. Holman before him to the breakfast room, where she beamed at himfrom her table across the room allthrough the meal.As young Weed stopped at the mailbox in the hall Mrs. Adams saileddown the front stairs, elbows waving."Looking for a love letter, Mr. Weed?"she bantered gayly."Not this morning, Mrs. Adams. Nosuch good luck for me. Haven't gota girl, you know." He smiled at herunsuspiciously."Well, now, that's too bad, Mr.Weed. A man with your good looksshould not have any trouble finding agirl. If you want any help, just letme know. I know of one not very faraway. She is a dear, and I'm sure youwould like her very much if you knewher better. There! I've let the catout of the bag, for you do know heralready. Really, Mr. Weed," she wenton confidentially, "Miss Peckham isone of the most charming girls at theBrownstone. And so versatile! Shecan do anything cook, sew, sing, converse intelligently, do anything.Really, you should cultivate her acquaintance. I'm sure you two wouldbe very congenial."Young Weed's hair fairly stoodup with alarm as he hurried away.Evidently there was a combinationto snare him.The next afternoon Miss Peckhamsat on the porch reading. She wasentirely unconscious of the havocthat had been wrought by her wellmeaning friends. She looked up insurprise as young Weed came out onthe porch? suitcase in hand, his long,pointed nose stabbing the atmospherebefore him. Having scented danger,he was making his retreat. He startedslightly as he spied Miss Peckham andtook a firmer grip upon his suitcase."Why, Mr. Weed, are you leavingus?" she inquired, turning her round,surprised eyes on the suitcase."Umph huh!" he grunted. "Going onthe North side to live. Walking distance from downtown, you know.""Well, you must not forget us, Mr.Weed. Come over and see us occasionally, won't you?"" 'Fraid not," young Weed mumbled,ungraciously, leveling his suspiciouseyes upon the anxious little spinster,his face wrinkling in a sour smile."Going to take up a correspondencecourse and will be too busy eveningsto make many calls. G'by!"He strode off down the street,swinging his suitcase relievedly.Chicago Daily News,Ptroxlde of Hydrogtn.Within recent years no remedy hacome into such general use as peroxide of hydrogen, the consumption ofwhich has reached enormous proportions. In this section of the countrythere is an especially great demandfor its use as a gargle for colds andcatarrhs, as well as a toilet preparation and as an antiseptic in connection with surgical operations. TheNew York Pharmaceutical Era callsattention to the fact that it is an unstable and widely variant product andthat Its sale should be closely supervised; that the manufacturer shouldbe compeled to indicate on the labelthe use for which it is intended andbe required to stamp (as it deteriorates with age) the date of manufacture. In most makes of peroxide ofhydrogen there is an addition of acet-an-illde,as a preservative. This isdangerous, and is said to be an unnecessary addition.Iron Bearing Plants.Experiments are under way at theagricultural bacteriological station inVienna to increase the quantity ofiron carried in certain plants, with aview to the effect on the human system when those plants are used asfood. Artificially prepared foods containing Iron do not always producethe deBired effect, because the ironis not completely assimilated. Thisdifficulty, it 1b thought, may be avoided by causing plants to take up an increased quantity of iron during theirnatural growth. By adding hydrate ofiron to the soil in which it was growing, the experimenters have succeededin producing spinach containing a percentage of iron seven times as greatas that found In ordinary spinach. ItIs believed that the process will provesuccessful with other ferruginousplants.If Yon Wan to Put ii WaterWorks fa Your flonse.Or Barn, or Bathroom Fixture orFnrnace, or Tin, Shingles or MfcaiRoofing, and all kinds of Tin Work,Guttering, Pipss, Filters, Water Tanks ,.Dipping Tanks, Sewerage Pipe andClay Flues.
