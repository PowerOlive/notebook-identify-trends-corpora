Historically It Is Among the Most Inter
esting Churches In the Country
Historically and in the relics of the
past which it contains few if any
churches in America are more interest
ing than old St Johns at Portsmouth
N H The founding of the parish dates
from 1638 but the present edifice is
modern It was built in 1S06 and the
good man who preached the dedication
sermon described it as a work of stu
pendous magnitude It is not however
the building which attracts us but its
belongings Here we see the old prayer
book with the prayer for the president
pasted over that for the king the
Vinegar Bible of which only 40
copies were printed and but five of
which are in the United States The
bell which calls the parish to prayers is
a capture from Louisburg and although
twice recast once by Paul Revere since
its voice was heard in its foreign home
it is yet the same old bell An arm
chair which stands behind the altar
rail was a gift fiom Queen Caroline
but is now known as the Washington
chair having been occupied by the first
president of the United States when he
attended service in the old church
Admiral JParragut was buried from
St Johns and the reading table is
made of wood from his flagship A
strange bit of treasure trove is the
heavy porphyry font taken from an old
nhnrnli ir Pnrf cinnntVi nnrl pinfmrpd hv
distributed to 12 old women in accord
ance with the terms of one Theodore
Ecclestons last will and testament and
because of a gift by will the church is
still heated by wood fires Nashaa N

The Child at the Play
The 6-year-old son of a newspaper
man occasionally goes to the matinee
with his mother but the trouble with
him is that he becomes greatly excited
and is apt to express his feelings in
words to the amusement of the audi
ence but somewhat to the annoyance
of the actors At a recent play one of
the actors was in the act of choking an
other whom he suspected of being guilty
of a crime As the actor went toward
the supposed villain with his hands
outstretched the boy became greatly ex
cited and as the men clinched the boy
stood up and called out Say let him
alone he didnt do it There was a
laugh from the audience and a surprised
look from the stage
At another time in a play where a
husband suspected his wife and she
was pleading to be taken home and
given an opportunity to prove her in
nocence the boy could not stand the
pleas and the husbands cold
FOMENTATIONS
Hoy to Prepare Them When Mo Hot
Water Is at Hand
Fomentations of hot or cold water are
often very useful and every one should
know how to eive them A flannel cloth
be folded wrung out of hot or cold
princess who has beu photographed as may
directly
many times and in as many different
poses as has Mrs Domenico Bounano
In Mrs JSouuauos case it was nothing
but a tribute first last and all the
time for in each instance she was pho
tographed only because she was beauti
ful Moreover the photographer was a
recognized authority on female beauty
a past grand master of the art of pho
tography a magician of lenses
He was Napoleon Sarony Mrs Bon
xianos first husband
When Sarony established his photo
graph gallery in New York he conceiv
ed the idea of advertising his business
by placing in prominent locations sam
ples of his work There were profes
sional beauties and handsome actresses
in those days just as there are in these
days but Sarony never found a more
inspiring subject than his own wife
and he iwed to delight to make pictures
of her in all sorts of artistic attitudes
and in all sorts of garb to which her
water as is desired and applied
to the skin It is much better after
wringing out the flannel as dry as de
sired to fold it in a dry flannel cloth of
one or two thicknesses before applying
it to the patient A little time is re
quired for the heat of the fomentation
to penetrate the dry flannel and thus
the skin is allowed an opportunity to
acquire tolerance for the heat and a
higher degree of temperature can be
borne if the moist cloth is brought di
rectly into contact with the surface
The outer fold of dry flannel will also
serve to keep the cloth warm by pre
venting evaporation
A hot fomentation is sometimes need
ed when no hot water is at hand It is
not necessary to wait for water to be
heated in the usual way Soak the flan
nel in cold water wring as dry as de
sired fold in a newspaper and layupon
the stove or wrap it about the stove
pipe In a few minutes it will be as
remarkable figure and charming features warm as the patient can bear The pa-
best lent themselves So it came about
that hundreds if not thousands of pho
tographs were taken of Mrs Bonnano
before her first husband died These
photographs extend over a period of
many years showing Mrs Bonnano in
the flush of youth and up to the maturi
The fomentation may be changed fre
quently and after it has been removed
massage may be given either by the per
son himself or another so as to
strengthen the part and promote a bet
ter circulation of blood in it Ex-change-

knowledge of the jargon of his kind
Why yes I guess so he responded
when he could get his breath What
the buyer meant was an old sewing ma
chine which could be turned in to the
sewing machine company as part pay
ment on a new machine The company
allows o on an old machine and some
times the agent or canvasser allows 5
more out of his commission on the sale
The public imagines that in some
way these old machines are valuable to
the company but in truth they are of
use only as arguments in forcing a sale
In the standard makes of machines there
is supposed to bo absolutely no cut in
prices and the only way that a seeming
reduction can be made is by taking in
an old machine and allowing for it
The company does this not for the sake
of getting the machine but for the sake
of making a trade Once the old timer
is in their possession it is broken up and
sold to a junk dealer
The companies know of course that
a large number of the families who
turn in old machines said to have been
bought by them before the flood really

Midnight Harmonies
The quaint old English cfaureh poet
George Herbert vtsu valking to Salis
bury one evening to join a musical par
ty when ho met a poer man with a
poorer horae thathad fallea under his
load They were both in distress and
Mr Herbert pulled off his coat and
helped the man to unload his horse He
then gave him some money and left
him At his arriving at Salisbury his
Mends wondered at his coming into
their company so soiled and discom
posed He explained the cause and
when one remarked that he had dis
paraged himself by so dirty an employ
ment he answered that the thought of
what he had done would prove music to
him at midnight and that the omission
of it would have upbraided and made
discord in his conscience For if 1 am
bound to pray for all that be in distress
so far as it is in my power I am to prac
tice what I pray for and let me tell
you I would not willingly pass one
day of my life without comforting a sad
soul or showing mercy and I bless God
