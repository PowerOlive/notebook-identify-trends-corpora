Consultations with the President and with his colleagues haveconvinced the junior Kentucky Senator that the legislative situation issuch that he cannot leave Washington without neglecting his official duties. The Senate is considering antitrust legislation and will have it under consideration until August 1, atthe earliest, so that Mr. Camden hasdecided he must leave his campaignfor re-election to his freinds."I want to be of such aid to thePresident as I can," said Mr. Camden."He believes, and I agree with himheartily, that Congress should remainhere until the trust bills are passedand then adjourn. I am a part ofCongress, and, therefore, it is my official duty, as well as my party service, to stay in Washington. It maybe that I can get to Kentucky withina day or two or tne primaries, butthat remains to be seen and is dependent entirely on the progress oflegislation."JPor some days the Senator anliis-secretaries have been conducting hiscampaign for re-election by letter.Now that Mr. Camden has finally decided that he cannot return to Kentucky at all during the Senatorialcampaign, the letters will continue tobe sent out by the thousands, and onthese. Mr. Camden will pin his hopesof election, which he says will be theratification of his choice by GovernorMcCreary.The House having no business ofspecial importance to transact, manyof the Kentucky members will gohome this week to remain until afterthe primary.MUDDY FORD DEMOCRATSORGANIZE THOMAS CLUB.A "Muddy Ford Thomas Club" wasorganized by the Democrats of Oxford and Turkeyfoot precincts, inScott County, at Muddy Ford withthe following as officers: H.

We have been reading aboutpets like lap dogs, Angora cats andtrained monkeys. We have heardthat women of fashion, who set thepace for other women to follow, havebeen going in for all sorts of records,golf, tennis, swimming, mountainclimbing, bridge, etc. But nobody hasbeen talking much about making arecord in raising healthy babies.Then suddenly, people discoveredthat neglecting babies was a bad thingfor the nation. Social workers beganto organize Mother Clubs in the congested districts of the cities for thepurpose of interesting mothers in theproper care of their babies. Thenalong comes Mrs. John Hays Hammond, one of the country's recognizedsocial leaders, with a society for thebetter education and training of richchildren. In the suburbs of richestNew York a little woman started aschool of mothercraft. What was theresult? Mother and baby came backinto style, and now everybody in talking about better babies.The Woman's Home Companion, amagazine which reaches all classesof mothers, was the first to recognizethe importance of making babies fashionable. It organized a Better BabiesBureau, whose object was to spreadthe Better Babies Contest idea allover the country. The publishers recorganized that the best way to preachthis beautiful gospel was through theState and county fair, at which cityand county mothers meet. Last yearthere were Better Babies Contest atthree hundred State and county fairs.One hundred thousand babies were examined, and are better babies to-daybecause their mothers learned something of the Better Babies idea atthese contests. This year it is expected that 200,000 babies will be examined under much better condition,and by physicians who have gainedi through the past year's experiencea better idea of the contest and its objects.A Better Babies Contest will be heldat Paris, July 20 to 31. Why not enter yaur baby in this contest?The Woman's Home Companionoffers .two medals to fine, healthy babies, who will be judged by the BetterBabies Standard Score Card for. physical and mental development. Tohighest scoring boy between ages of6 and 36 months, and to highest scoring girl between ages of 6 and 36months, each a bronze medalBetter Babies Diplomas to firstprize winners in all classes, and toeach child examined in the contest, abeautiful Certificate of Examinationshowing the record made by the child,and enrolling it permanently in thenation-wide ranks of better babies.The medals, sample score cards,diplomas and certificates are on display in C. O. Hinton's window, withthe picture of the Honor Roll of theBabies Health Contest, held last yearand one of the score cards used atthat time.1 k-STRAW HATSATHALF PRICE!Panamas and HopkinsStraws at Reduced,..

Thomas as a candidate for theDemocratic nomination for Congressman at the August primary, to beheld in " this county on Saturday,August 1, 1914.TH POLITICAL SITUATIONIN BOURBON COUNTY.It is only a little more than twoweeks until the August primary election, and it seems certain that Bourfcon County will go for Gov. Beckhamby a good majority. Six years agothis county was a McCreary countyby a majority of about 300.At present McCreary's strength is anegligible quantity in Bourbon, he being practically without any united following in the county. The straightout liquor forces are for Stanley, butJklcCreary's position on the liquorquestion has been so carefully concealed that in event of Stanley's withdrawal they would go to McCreary.The county, however, is certain, inany event, to go to Beckham by alarge majority. In the North Middletown precinct, one of the largest andmost substantial precincts in thecounty, the sentiment for Beckhamis practically unanimous, and it is coniidently predicted that he will carrynearly every precinct in the county.Stanley was here and made a speechin the courthouse to a small audienceearly in the campaign, but made avery unfavorable impression on account of the abusive and denunciarycharacter of his remarks, the wholespeech being devoted to a bitter denunciation of Mr. Beckham.In event that the efforts of theliquor interests to force the withdrawal of McCreary from the raceshould succeed, the bulk of McCreary's small following in Bourbonwould go to Beckham, but in eventthat both should remain in the raceBeckham will get a clear majorityover both in this county.The present indications are thatBourbon County will go overwhelmingly for Johnson N. Camden forthe short term. The general impression here is that the nomination ofMr. Beckham is as certain as anyfuture event, many believing that he"will get an actual majority of thevotes cast in the Senatorial primarythroughout the State.The nomination for Congressmanfrom the Seventh district is attractingmuch attention. Mr. Cantrill stoodwith Mr. Stanley in the last session ofCongress in opposition to the WebbKenyon bill, which was in effect a billto prevent bootlegging in localitieswhere, by the will of the people, thesale of liquor had been outlawed.Mr. Cantrill, in all his politicalcarreer, has been regarded as thefriend of the liquor interests in Congress. The Hon. Claude M. Thomas, ofBourbon, who is opposing Mr. Cantrill,is known throughout the State as anardent temperance man, and when inthe State Senate led the fight for thecounty unit bill, which owed its passage largely to his splendid leadership. He is a man of sterling character and scholarship, and a fine publicspeaker. He has pitched his campaignin. the temperance issue, and in hisspeeches assails with telling forceMr. -Cantrill's record in Congress andin the State Legislature as the openand acknowledged ally of the liquorinterests.The temperance forces throughoutthe district are rallying to his standard, recognizing their right to be represented in Washington by a man who' "will look to their interests. At firstit looked like Mr. Cantrill would win,but the setniment that the representative of this district should benamed by the people has grown tosuch dimensions that the nominationof Thomas seems reasonably certain.jThe campaign is daily growing in interest, and friends of both candidates,3ktq very active.Through failure to make the properrailroad connections at Winchester,Wednesday morning, the films of the"Million Dollar Mystery" which wereshown in Mt. Sterling, Tuesday nght,failed to reach Paris, and inquiries atMt.

He restedfifteen minutes on the road, andreached Paris at 11:45.

The energetic work of the StateGame and Fish Wardens in promptlyarresting and prosecuting violatorsot the game laws is meeting withhearty commendation from all truesportsmen who have not become"game hogs.".

Ithas been suggested that the Association could make a little money byconverting the grounds temporarilyinto an amusement park for the remainder of the summer and early fall.Taking into consideration the liberalpatronage bestowed on the ElleryBand during its afternoon and nightperformances here last summer, ithas been suggested by a public-spiritedcitizen that the Association makecontracts with some of the leadingmusical organizations for a series ofsummer night concerts at the FairGrounds, and especially for sacredconcerts on Sunday afternoons andnights. The popularity of such amusements is unquestioned and the largecrowds that patronized the ElleryBand performances attests the factthat Paris people would rather patronize a first-class musical attractionthan any other from of entertainment.It seems to us that the Associationcould make a neat profit by using thegrounds for this purpose, rather thanlet them be idle and unoccupied allthe year round.Some hustling citizen should takeup the matter with the .directors andpush it to a successful c onclusion.Do we hear from "Roxie" Davis?REFRESHING RAINS HELP-.

Thearmhole droops very low on theshoulders of these blouses and a fulllittle bishop sleeve of organdy is attached.

This newtaffeta has much more weight to itthan the taffeta so commonly usedthis summer.Are you thinking of buying a newsuit which will also be- serviceablefor fall? If so, buy it of gabardine,or serge, or broadcloth.

Young Barrow and a companion, Edward Leavenworth, a fellow-student,at the Students' MilitaryCamp, near Ludington, started out ina canoe for a trip on the lake afterthe noon lunch, alothough the lakewas very rough. When some distance out a sudden squall struck thefrail craft overturning it. Leavenworth swam ashore, leaving Barronclinging to the capsized boat while hesecure help from the coast guards.The supposition is that young Barrowbecame exhausted from clinging tothe canoe and dropped off and sankbefore aid could reach him. Lifesavers and the coast patrol made ineffectual efforts to recover the body.Young Barrow went to Ludington afew days ago to join a United StatesGovernment military camping partv.He was well known amoug the younger set in Paris society circles andthe news of his tragic death was received here with great sorrow by hisfriends and those of his distinguishedfather.Though the efforts of the beach patrol and of the men in boats, searching for the body were tireless, it hasnot been found.Throughout the day and far intothe night searching parties continuedto patrol the beach. Twenty-five orthirty boats were hurried to the sceneof the accident as soon as daylight appeared, and continued searching thatprotion of the lake until driven in bydarkness. At last accounts the searchwas still unavailing last night.BWf!imtvMiw(Copyright. byilTcClure Syndicate)' V-COUNTY COURT DAYS.Below is a list of the days County;Courts are held each month in counties tributary to Paris:Anderson, Lawrecemirg, 3d Monday.Bath, Owingsville, 2d Monday.Bourbon, Paris, lut Monday.Boyle, Danville, 3d Monday.Clark, Winchester, 4th Monday.Owen, Owenton, 4th Monday."Pendleton, Falmouoi, 1st Monday.Powell, Stanton, 1st Monday.Pulaski, Somerset, 3rd Monday.Scott, Georgetown, 3d Monday.Shelby, Shelbyville, 2d Monday.Wayne, Montecello, 4th Monday.Woodford, Versailles. 4th Monday.Fayette, Lexington, 2d Monday.Fleming, Flemingsburg, 4th MondayFranklin, Frankfort, 1st Monday.Garrard, Lancaster, 4th Monday.Grant, Williamstown, 2d Monday.Harrison, Cynthiana, 4th Monday.Jessamine, Nicholasville, 3d MondayLee, Beattyville, 4th Monday.Lincoln, Stanford, nd Monday.Madison, Richmond, 1st Monday.Mason, Maysville, 1st Monday.Mercer, Harrodsburg, 1st Monday.Montgomery, Mt.
