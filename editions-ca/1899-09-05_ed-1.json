His Sniorc In the Drrk
I am convinced of the truth of the
eld theory that the pleasure of smok
ing resides more largely In the taste
than it does in the sight said a busi
ness man of this city who recently
underwent a minor operation for gran
ulated eyelids I had to sit for three
days in total darkness and being a
confirmed smoker 1 longed for the
solace of a cigar The first difficulty I
encountered was in getting a light and
1 wouldnt confess my helplessness
until I had burned off half my mus
tache Then I let my wife hold the
match but I kept complaining that the
tobacco wouldnt ignite My wife
would assure me that it was burning
like a furnace but I couldnt taste a
thing
One of the main pleasures of the
habit although we dont realize it is
to exhale the smoke gently xul watch
it curl up into the air I caugTft myself
straining after that sight a hundred
times and there was an overwhelming
sense of something missing Except
when I inhaled the smoke it was abso
lutely impossible to tell whether the
cigar was going so I got some ciga
rettes and inhaled every one But it
was a poor substitute 1 felt instinc
tively that I was getting only a morsel
of the old delight
When they took off the bandage I
grabbed my pipe with an avidity that
surprised the euti household 1 have
been trying to catch up ever since
New Orleans Times Democrat
Struck by the System
A peddler the other day found him
self in an office building occupied
wholly by lawyers He went up to
the first flat looking for a customer
but he found all the doors locked Then
he went up to the second flat and there
he found everybody absent and so at
last he went to the top flat Here he
espied an open door and looking in
saw a man busy writing at his desk
The peddler began telling of his wares
but the lawyer interrupted with No
I dont want any Still the peddler
continued and again the lawyer pro
tested I tell you 1 dont want any
thing Get out But the peddler per
sisted so that the lawyer thoroughly
angry quickly arose and threw the in
truder down the stairs
Just as he lauded the lawyers part
ner appeared and taking it for grant
ed that there was good reason for such
action he seized the poor man and
threw him down the next flight
Strange enough the janitor of the
building saw the second landing of the
peddler and the fact that he was a
peddler was enough to cause him to
seize the victim and throw him down
the final flight of stairs Here the un
fortunate man picked himself up and
rubbing his bruises observed Well
this is the first visit I have made to
this building and I must say tbey have
got a perfect system Detroit Free

Paregoric Fiend
Down the village street getting on

See him a villager inquired of the
summer resident pointing a shoulder
at the shambling figure Thats a
paregoric fiend He swallows more
paregoric than all the babies in the
village put together Howd he get in
the way of taking the stuff Well
you know theres some old women in
our town that think paregoric good for
all manner of things thats the matter
with your insides an wheu daddy
had pains from eating too much his
wife dosed him with paregoric an the
first thing she knowed he couldnt get
on without it Hes worsen a drunk
ard now an you cant get within ten
feet of hii without smellin the stuff
He had a stroke a spell back an the
doctors tried to scare him about using
paregoric but it wasnt no use Hell

HI
Ah dear old Pietro man never had a
truer better friend Do you remember
lietro those happy days you aud your
maKter spent down in the pine woods
mid swamps of LouisiauaV Have you
k ten the little one room cabin al
ii in the very heart of Tickfaw
swamp where we dwelt all alone so long
just you and I
One morning in early spring I took
down my gun and commenced to clean
it Pietro lay in the corner watchiug
me He knew as well as I what my
every movement meant
It was a glorious morning The air
was filled with the perfume of yellow
jasmine watted down from the tops of
the tall trees No matter in what direc
tion I looked wild flowers met my eye
It was indeed an earthly paradise that
quiet little nook in the swamp Not a
sound disturbed the stillness of the scene
save now and then the splash of some
fish or animal in the dark water over
there
Sitting down on the upturned root of
an ancient cypress tree I prepared to
rest awhile and enjoy the scene to my
hearts content to live in paradise just
for once
I dont know how long I had been sit
ting there when hearing a rustling in
the tangled vines behind me I turned
my head The picture that met my gaze
will remain engraved upon my memory
bo long as life lasts
My eyes were dazzled by the girls in
describable beauty 1 turned them away
as I would from the sun then looked
again
Thou seemest surprised young stran
ger Verily I do bethink me thou takest
me for a spirit Thou art tall and strong
young man Surely a bit of a girl has
not frightened thee out of thy wits
No fair creature I repiled I am
not overcome from fright so much as by
surprise
Look thee stranger is not this truly
a lovely kingdom and as such should it
not have a ruler That being true why
should not I be its queen 2 My home is
just two miles away through the swamp
and we call it Jasmine Bower Often
times when time hangs heavily 1 turn my
footsteps to this spot An hour spent
here among these flowers drives away all
care and puts me in a good humor with
the world my little world What brings
thee into my kingdom Speak
I am but a wandering hunter fair la
dy I and my dnmb friend here patting
Pietro on the head lire back there
across the bayou all alone We started
out this morning for a hunt Sitting
down on that upturned root I gave my
self up to thought while lietro seized
the opportunity to take a imp Hearing
a rustling in the vines behind me I turn
ed my head and I beheld the most beau
ful creature that ere met the gaze of
man and
Nay nay the girl interrupted with
a frown say not those words 1 pray
thee rf thou wouldst not anger me
speak not again of my poor beauty
Pardon my hasty words Miss
Call me Laurine
I did not intend to offend Forgive
me I crave
Thon art forgiven she smilingly rA
pueo again buov nig ner perron teetn
But thou art my prisoner I claim thee
because ikon hast entered my kingdom
without royal permit At home I have
two toothers who too are mighty hunt
ers There is not a deer bear or turkey
in all of Tickfaw swamp the haunt of
which they do not know The rarest fish
ing places they can find ou the darkest
nights Come with me my stranger pris
oner and my giant brothers shall give
thee a lesson iu woodcraft Come and I
grant thee 1 will Drove a most merciful
queen Follow me
She started off along a path that led to
the right Pietro and 1 closely following
Entering a high arched gateway we
passed on through a wilderness of flow
ers from the modest blossoms of the
wood to the rarest specimens of the
world I could see at a glance why the
place was called Jasmine Bower for in
every direction that fragrant flower could
be seen
Laurine ushered me into a beautiful
room Here and there soft seated settees
were temptingly arranged and vases tilled
with flowers stood on a table near a win
dow Everything about the room from
the paintings on the wall to the well fill
ed bookcase betokened refinement and
taste
Presently she returned and placed be
fore me cake and wine aud bade me par
take
Just at this juncture I heard heary
steps in an adjoining room In a moment
tbe door opened and in stepped two as
fine specimens of manhood as ever met
my gaze Each was more than sis feet
tall and as strong as an ox
These are my brothers said Laurine
introducing us I told this gentleman
whom 1 met in the swamp that you
were mighty hunters and would show
him where to hunt and fish
Many were the hunts we had together
In the depths of the dark wild swamp
and many were the quiet smokes we en
joyed at night in my little cabin
Scarcely a day passed that I did not go
to the Bower and on each succeeding
visit my love for Laurine grew stronger
1 could think or dream of nothing else
save the beautiful girl At times I would
catch myself talking of her Pietro would
gaze up In my face with s look of won
der and injury I believe in my very
soul he knew what my trouble was and
more I believe he waa jealous
One morning I had known the girl
three months I took particular pains
with aiy toilet making myself as present
able as possible
On reaching the Bower I went direct
to the cozy little parlor expecting to find
Laurine there Picking up a book I had
just begun to read when my attention
was attracted by the rustling of skirts in
the hallway outside the door Just as I
arose- Laurine entered the room
She was not alone By her side with
his arm about her waist was a dapper
little Frenchman whom 1 had seen sev
eral times in New Orleans
What doos this mean Laurine I de
manded
Just then Pietro gave a loud bark I
awoke with a start
It had all been a dream Nashville
