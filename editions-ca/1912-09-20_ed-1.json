The Fall Festival, under the aua

will begin Monday. The Kraus Carni
val Companyone of the best in the

one great roun of pleasure.
This year, as in each year 'past, the
Kraufe Carnival Company has added
new attractions and surprises for the
public, found and prefected only by
great labor, patience and skill and with
the'outlay of a great deal of money.
The reportoir of new ideas and nov
elties advanced are above the old
sterotyped carnivals of a few years
; ago. The new attractions, new rid
ing devices, the new fun factories
are of the most unique and sensa
tional absolute from all others and are
receiving enthusiatic praise from the
press and public. The motto of the
Krause Shows has ever been: "Clean
liness and Morality,77 and this season
it will be no exception to the rule.
Nothing of a rough or rowdy nature is
permitted on the carnival grounds.
The free attraction will be Miss
EmmaMaier, the chmnjon lady swim
mer of the world who will give an ex
hibition of fancy swimming and div
ing after which she will mount a lad
der 75 feet in the air and dive into a
tank containing three'and a half feet
ot water. Miss Maier is said to be
the most daring lady in the world.
Miss Maier will give her exhibition
of swimming and diving afternoon and
evenings, during the week.
G. R. Keller Succumbes After
Short Illness.
'After an illness of only a few days,
Green R. Keller, editor of the Carlisle
Mercury, and Representative in the
State Legislature irom the Nicholas
Robertson District, died at his fhome
in Carlisle, Wednesday evening, at
6:30 o'clock. He was one of the best
knownjnewspaper men" inlthis section
of the State. Mr. Keller was stricken
suddenly ill Tuesday afternoon. He
was soon in a serious condition nad.his
physician and relatives had 'no hope of
his recovery from the 'start.
Mr. Keller was born in Harrison
county on May 7. 1845. He was the
son of Noah and Elizabeth Keller and
received his edcuation in the common
schools fo the county. For a number
of years he was a resident of Paris
and was identified with the newspaper
business. He represented Bourbon
county in the Legislature during the
first admiistration of Governor James
B. McCreary thirty-six years ago, and
has been the Clerk of that body sev
eral times since. Last year he was
elected as representative from the
Nicholas-Robertson District.
Mr. Keller was the founder of the
Cynthiana Democrat, which he subse
quently sold and embarked in th news
paper business in Paris. His first ven
ture here was Saturday Night, pub
lished first in 1876. Later he was en
gaged in the publication of a newsDa
per and in partnership with the lateW.
A. Johnson.
Mr. Keller, in connection with the
late J.-M. McCann in 1876 edited and
published a History of Paris, which
contained many interesting sketches
of the early historv of the city, and a
copy of which is still preserved in the
News office. In 1882 Mr. Keller pur
chased the Carlisle Mercury which he
has owned and published ever since.
At the outbreak of the Civil War the
sympathies of Mr. Keller went to the
Southland. In SeDtember, 1862, he
enlisted in Company C. Fifth Ken
tucky Cavalry, the company being
formed by Capt. Harry Bedford. fcHe
was in the brigade of Gen. Buford,
but was later transferred to the com-
'mand of General John H. Morgan.
Being brave and fearless he was al
ways at the front in all of the engage
ments in which his command partici
pated. He followed his leader through
Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio, and was
taken a prisoner at Buffington's Island
where the command, overwhelmed by
tin ion troops, surrendered after one of
the most daring raids in the history of
the struggle.
With his comrades, Mr. Keller was
confined in a Northern prison for a pe
riod of fourteen months. Following
the close of thexwar he returned to
his native State. He has always
been prominently identified with the
interests of the Confederate Veter
ans and did much toward the establish
iment of the Confederate Home at
Pewee Valley, and was also promi
nent in the efforts to secure a pension
for the aged ex-confederates.
Mr. Keller was the Democratic nom
inee in the Third District in 1897 and
was a candidate for the Democratic
nomination for State Auditor before
the Music Hall Convention in 1899.
In 1870 he married Miss Fannie Hol
ton, of Mason county. He was a mem
ber ofDaugherty Lodge No. 65, F,
and A. M., and of the Christian
Church. The funeral services will be
held at the home on Main street Fri
day morning at 10 :30o'clock, and the
Masons andConfederate Veterans will
have a promi nent part in the servicefl.
He was the only surviving son of
Mrs. Elizabeth Smith, of Cynthiana,
who is eighty-seven years of age, and
who was at his bedside when the end
came. Two sons Mr. Stanley Keller,
of Carlisle, and Dr. Harvey Keller, of
Louisville, also survive.

Thousands Attend Democratic
Rally.
Yesterday was a glorious day for
Kentucky Democracy, when thousands
from all parts of Kentucky assembled
at Lexington to attend the opening of
the campaign. The hosts began to
arrive early in the morning, special
trains from all parts of Kentucky car
rying large delegations, rolled into the
Fayette capital.
Among the distinguished visitors
who were heard on the speakers7 stand
were Speaker Champ Clark of the Na
tional House of Representatives : Unit
ed States Senator Ths. P. Gore, of
Oklahoma ; benator-elect Ollie M.
James, Congressman Swager Sherley.
Ben Johnson, J. Campbell Cantrill, A.
O. Stanley, Gov. McCreary. Lieut.
Gov. McDermott. former Congressman
W. P. Kimball, John S. Rhea, and
others.
Bourbon county sent a large delega
tion to the gathering, it being estimat
ed that four hundred Democrats took
advantage ot the opportunity to attend
the rally, which was pronounced to be
the greatest ever held in the State.
Headed by the High School Band, a
large number went on the early morn
ing cars, while each car following was
crowded to the guards. The gigantic
parade was the feature of the gather
ing, and. atter tormmg a march was
made to Woodland Park, where the
marching thousands found plenty to
eat in ther shape ot barbecued meats
and burgoo,

Thea attendance at the State JFair
for the entire week was 98,430, an in
crease of 9,421 over last year.
Owing to the prevalence of scabies
and foot rot in Ohio, Live Stock In
spector William Mitchell, of Mason
county, has received instructions not
to allow any sheep from that State to
rross the Ohio river into Mason county.
Reports from the Ohio side of the
river say that the disease is sDread
ing, although it has not made its ap
pearance in that county. Inspector
Mitchell is keeping a close eye on
shippers of live stock and has notified
them of the qurarantine.
GEORGETOWN .'COURT The
News reportsGeorgeown court as fol
lows: 'Yesterday was mule colt
da in Georgetown and the number of
colts un sale ecxeeded any former Sep
tember court day 'for a number of
years past. While a good many of the
calts were unsold at the close of the
diy, yetjjthe vast majority of them
changed hands at fairly good prices.
There was a scarcity of the real toppy
kind, and this class was brisk and sold
at strong prices, bringing from $85 up
to 115 per head. The second class
mules brought from $60 to $75, while
the common graed that found buyers
were disposed of at from $45 to $55.
'T'here was about 250 head of cattle
on the market. Anything with quality
from calves to feeders, bought good
strong prices, but the majority of
the offerings were the "foreign ' kind,
and on this kind the bidding was not
so brisk.

Pacing Kings.
The Kentucky Trotting Horse Breed
ers' Association seems to have done
wisely in offering a guaranteed stake
of $3,000 for pacers of the 2:05 class,
for it is now almcst certain that for
the first time in 1912 there ;will be a
meetirg of the four cracks, viz: Joe
Patchen 2nd, Batrden Direct, Jones
Gentry ard King Onward, the latter
being (he only horse that has defeat
ed Joe Patchen 2nd during the season.
Jones Gentry is unbeaten; Joe
Patchen 2nd has lost but one race;
Barden Direct but one, and that
through an accident, and many of the
Canadian contingent stand ready to
back the wonderful pony King Onward
against any one of the three. This
will certainly be a race among Kings,
and moreover as the four Kings of the
year have not vet met, the battle will
be a royal one and worth soing mnay
hundredjmiles to see. This race and
the Kentucky Futnriaty are carded for
October, the first day of Lexington's
great trots.
