Out of this they paid all current expense, which had grown cowsiderably in everything; built a modelschool at Currentsville, arranged according to the latest plans for thepreservation of the health of thechildren; paid the rural teachersfrom $44 to $65 per month for theusual term and at the end of theyear, July 1, 1919 had a surplus of$1,019.95.The next year the Board got thebenefit of 5 cents raise, or 15 centslevy to meet the advanced times. Outof this they paid the rural teachersas high as $76.00 and the high schoolprincipals as high as $200.00 permonth; ran all schools eight months,when they could get teachers; metall current expenses, which were atleast three times as high as usual;paid, or had resources to pay on theMillersburg school about $19,000.00and could have sold this same property for $26,000.00 profit, a sumwhich would alone pay the Superintendent's salary for twenty-sixyears. Shouldn't the Board be commended for the deal? At the end ofthe school year, July 1, 1920, theBoard had a surplus of $862.20.This school year, which beganJuly 1, 1920, the Board levied a 25cets tax, the very least possible under the law. The resources and disbursements will be as follows for theyear, as near as it can possibly befigured. The balance at the end ofthe year was $862.20, Taxes $56,250,state money $18,101.52, poll taxabout $900.00, Millersburg districttax about $2,600.00, Millersburgschool sold recently $3,000.00, Millersburg patrons donation on Principal's salary $400.00, Smith-Hughes'und $900.00, Slater fund $500.00,General Educational Board $200.00,land notes about $5,870.52. Totalresources, $89,582.23. Expenditureswill be about as follows: For eightmonths teachers" salaries, exceptthree high schools estimated for ninemonths and required by law, $44,536,City school tuition about $4,800.00,new seats $900.00, Coal and haulingsame $2,500.00, attendance officers$1,000.00. 'Total disbursements,$75,946.00. This will leave a balance of $13,638.24, a sum amplysufficient, I am sure, to pay all bills,both expected and possible, and extend the term to nine months in allschools, which has never been donein the county.The rural teachers are being paidfrom $75 to $125 per month thisyear.As to the high tax rate spoken ofso much for the next school year, thenew County Board will be absolutely in power to do as they choose, provided they stay within the limits ofthe law and do not get above themaximum or below the minimum. Asfar as I am cocerned, I will giveto the public what I had planned forthe schools for the remainder of myterm, after which, the new Superintendent, selected by the Board of theI people's choosing, will formulate hisown nroeram.

But I ampositive this rate will be amply sufficient to carry out our constructiveschool program which we had planned in having an eight months schoolterm, raising the teachers' salaries,paying off all obligations, paying allcurrent expense, and have at least$20,000.00 besides to be use as theBoard sees fit.As to the justness of the criticismagainst the Board, I shall leave the.
