Everything is in readiness for the event,which has long since been heralded asa week of unlimited pleasure to visitors from far and near as well as thehome folks. vWith a week of pleasant weatherthere should be nothing to preventthe most successful fair in the historyof the organization, which enjoys thedistinction of staging annually theoldest r fair in the State of Kentucky.The Bourbon- Fair ranks at the top ofKentucky fairs and is reagrded byhorsemen as well as the public as oneof the very greatest.From the fact that the first eventwas given in 1811 it is rightfully regarded as the historic fair of the State.From the time of the organization ofthe Society it has been regarded bythe public as the greatest of them all.and the sixty-sixth ennnal renewal willeclipse anything heretofore attempted.The Bourbon Fair since its organization has been held annually on thesame dates and not even the most powerful fair in the State has been sufficient to change them. In addition tothe wealth of horses, cattle, sheep andhogs there are hundreds of other attractions that have in the past servedto make this fair the most attractivefrom every standpoint.Since the rejuvention of the Societyin 1906, there has been a substantialimprovement in all departments, andnotwithstanding the gieat handicapwhich it was compelled to face, it hassteadily overcome all obstacles andtaken its place again in the fruntranks.Annually there has been noted a decided change in the manner of holdingthe fair, and which in each case hasproven a betterment to the organization. The constant improvement inthe premium department has had Jtheeffect of producing the best results.Horsemen from all sections of theStaie have been looking forward tothe Bourbon fair as the event which,nrecedinor the State Fair at Louisville, gives the average admirer of theequine a falrjdea of what the resultwill be in the show ring at the Stateexhibit when the cream of Kentuckyhorseflesh meet in the classical events.From this fact the best Kentucky ;can produce meet at the Bourbon Fairto compete for the Dremiums that areaannually improved, with the view ofbringing not only stock from Kentuckyto the show ring but that from otherStates. Aside rfom so manv premiumsthat were offered last year which havebeen renewed for the present exhibit,are several others, among which is thepremiumSfor mules, the feature of thefourth day of the fair.The directors of ihejSociety'have taken occasion to brovide for the amusemen o the crowds that are expectedto attend the fair this week and haveprovided an excellent line of midwayattractions, which come highly recommended, all of which are clean andwholesome. In addition of the dailyperformances all of the attractionswill run at night.The success of the fair largely depends upbn the patronage, which nodoubt will be larger than ever before.The untiring efforts of President Jos.M. Hall, Secretary Chas. Webber andthe Board of Directors to make thisfair the largest and best in the historyof the Society will'in all probabilitymeet with due return. Weather parmitting the Meek should be one of exceptional profit to the Society.2 Articles of incorporation of the People's Bank of Paris were filed inFrankfort yesterday with a capitalstock of $50,U00.

A. Moore,who by order of E. T. Bushnell, Acting First Assstant Postmaster General, will in a few days establish amounted carrier system to completethe service.All of the new additions in the cityof Paris will receive the benefits ofthe new service. Postmaster Moore hasirequently reeived petitions from residents in manv sections of the city f orjJacairier service and the matter wastaken up with the department in Washington, resulting in the order beingissued.The rapid groth of the city of Pariscoupled ith the increase in the city'spopulaion has made it impossible torthe present carrier sVstem toe over allol the territory within the city limitsand to overcome this and give residentsin the outskirts a'service the establishment of the mounted carrier as recommended to the postoh'ice department.There will be no increase in the present force ot carriers in the city, one oftne number now employed being j-.h-signedto the new route which is to beestablished within the next few days.His equipment will be similar to thatwhich is now being used by themounted mail carriers in larger citiesand will constitute a miniature postoffice on wheels, lo whicn is driven ahorse and which is constructed in amanner to be easily mounted by thecarrier. gThe only provision set out in the order from the department is that eachresidence along tne route of themounted carrier be provided with asuitable receptacle in svhich to receivetheir mail and unless such mail box isprovided ,the'servicewill not be extended. There is little doubt thateach resident will provide the necessary mail box trorn tne number ofanxious requests that have been rece ved for the service by the local post-office officials.The districts to he served oy themounted carrier are White Addition,Henry Addition, Nineteenth and Twentieth streets, Brent and Clitton avenues. These additions have heretofore beenjreceiving their mail throughthe general deliveryandjpnvate boxedand the new service will prove a greatconvenience to the residents in thosesections of the city.The city carrier service was put intoeffect in Paris about eight years ago,when three carriers employed madethe deliveries. Since that time, andkeeping abreast with the extension ofthe city and increasing population thenumber of carriers has been increasedto four, which gives Paris a mail delivery service equal to any fourth classcity in the State and the addition ofthe mounted carrier is calculated togreatly improve tha service and convenience the patrons.The completion of the route for themounted carrier is expected in thenext few days and the new service willgo into effect.TheBourbon Horse GoodsJSo.irscorporatecl.Manufacturers ofHarness, Horse Boots andLeather Novelties ofAH Kinds,All Orders Promptly Executed AndWork Guaranteed.No. 304 Main StreetRepairing of All Kind DoneWhile You Wait.Opp. Court House.tParsRestaurantFirst-Class MealsServed.Quick and CleanService.EverythingUp-to-Date.Main Street,Opp. Agricultural Bank B'fd'g.gawftvwitfiwj Paris Book Company;1 Mr. C.
