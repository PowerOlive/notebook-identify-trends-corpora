Forty eggs of the modern hen are
required to fill the eggshell of the
gigantic prehistoric ostrich which
has been placed on exhibition in the
American Museum of National His
tory. The specimen is the best of its
kind in the world and is in perfect
condition, with the exception of a
small hole through which the orig
inal contents may have disappeared.
The fossil shell, -when filled with wa
ter, was found to have a capacity of
a trifle more than two quarts.
This egg was discovered in the
Province of Honan, China, in June,
1915. It was seen sticking in the
bank of the Yellow River, where it
