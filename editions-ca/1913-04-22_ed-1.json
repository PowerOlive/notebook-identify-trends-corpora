Dolan Freed of Murder Charge.
Thomas TDoIan was freed of the
charge of murdering Patrick Mooney,
on the nighfof April 20, 1912, in the
Fayette Circuit Court, yesterday.
The Clark county jury reported to
Judge Kerr in Circuit vCourt at l(h45
that they were hopelessly "aisagreed,
and the Court discharged them.
Commonwealth's Attorney, John 1
Allen immediately held a conference
with Joseph Quisenberry, foreman of
the jury, in which he ascertained
how the jury stood. Then the Prose
cuting Attorney made a motion that
the court dismiss the case.
Judge Kerr accordingly directed that
the indictment dismissd and Dolan's
bondsmen released.
in asking that the charge be dis
missed Col. Allen said there had been
five trials of the case and that a con
viction had resulted in only one" case,
that being a manslaughter verdict.
Col. Allen said one of his chief rea
sons in asking for a dismissal was that
the case had cost the Commonwealth
a large amount of money and that it
seemed impossible to Drocure a convic
tion. Col. Allen in asking Judge Kerr to
- .dismiss the case against Dolan, said he
would have moved for a dismissal I
following the last trial, but for the
fact that the iurv broucrht in a verdint.
of guilty and in view of that fact he
did not think that it was consistent
to recomend a dismissal. He said he
did not think that it was fair to Dolan
to ask him to go into another trial in
view of the five trials and no legal
convict ioij.

cost of producing and raising a colt to
the age of three years averages S96.54,
while the selling price of , the animals
average $136.17.8 The princinal cost of
