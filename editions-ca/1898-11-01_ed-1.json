The Awkwardness of Being a Prince
The Prince of Wales is placed by fate
in the most difficult position of any
English subject Libeled incessantly
continuously and malignantly silence
is imposed on him by reasons of state
If he patronizes the drama for the
neglect of which the queen is persist
ently blamed the prince is depicted as 3
trifler who finds in the society of
mummers relief from the tedium of a
wasted life If he encourages our na
tional sports he is a profligate and ie
compared with royal predecessors
whose conduct would certainly not
commend itself today even to the
stanchest supporters of monarchy If
he does not lavish money he does not
possess he is said to be stingy If he
makes an outlay on a church at Sand
ringham or a ball at Marlborough
House he is a spendthrift Unworthy
friendships are attributed to him with
men upon whom he has never set eyes
orvith whom he may perhaps have ex
changed a casual word If he plays a
game of cards he is a gambler
Fierce as is the light that heats upon
a throne the cruel and searching illumi
nation of the princes life inflicts on
him the disabilities and responsibilities
while denying him either the power of
the throne or the privileges of a private
station Harpers Magazine

The English Broom
One of the botanical odities of Massa
chusetts is the existence rf the English
broom which grows in only two places
in Sterling this county and in Sa
lem It is not a native plant and how
it got across the water is a mystery
Perhaps some homesick colonist caused
it to be sent to him that the hills about
his new home might have the familiar
appearance of the old country It is a
beautiful golden yellow in color and
grows in a compact spirelike plant
with blossoms close together So thick
are the stalks that the pastures are like
sheets of gold and at first sight seem
to be buttercups in masses Arba Pierce
brought some of it into the city and
proposes to make a display of it at the
exhibition of the horticultural society
Every one has heard of the broom
English and Scotch literature is full o
it It was the flower of the royal house
of Plantagenet In fact the name Plan
taganet is the French for broom plant a
genet Their ancestor the Count dAn
jou wore a string of broom as a badge
therefore their name The name broom
is given it because of its usefulness for
the purpose Worcester Mass

A Bismarck Duel
A duel in which Bismarck was once
engaged had a very amusing origin It
occurred when he was chief secretary
of the Prussian legation at Frankfort
He went much into society and one
Christmas attended a big ball During
the height of the festivities Bismarcks
attention was directed to an exceedingly
pompous individual who strutted about
the room This was a M de Clancy a
noted French duelist Later on this im
portant individual took part in a dance
but having omitted to leave his hat at
the proper place had perforce to hold it
out almost at arms length while he
danced The spectacle tickled Bismarck
immensely and as the Frenchman came
sailing majestically along Bismarck
stepped forward and dropped a coin in
to the hat A duel was one of the next
days events Though it was with pis
tols Bismarck escaped unhurfc while
his adversary was wounded
Freedom From a Terrible Slavery
At last I am thankful to say the
opera is dead No longer shall my soul
be corroded by the thought that I ought
to be in my stall and am not No longer
when I am in my stall shall I writhe
in anger to think of the stupidity of
wasting my time so London Saturday

or Government Money
At close of our Civil War in 1865
there appeared in the London Times
the following
If that mischievous financial pol
icy which had its origin in the North
American Republic during the late
Civil War in that country should be
come indurated down to a fixture
then that government will furnish its
money without cost It will have all
the money that is necessary to carry
on its trade and commerce It will
become prosperous beyond precedent
in the history of civilized nations of
the world The brain and wealth of
all countries will go to North America
THAT GOVERNMENT MUST BE
DESTROYED OR IT WILL DE
STROY EVERY MONARCHY ON
THIS GLOBE
The famous Hazzard circular to
capitalists in New York and the Buell
Bank circular to United States Banks
ers both emanating from London and
trie iaDuious corruption iuna raisecun
England and Germany estimatedat
1500000 were the agents that se
cured the closing of our mints against
silver
The walk into my parlor policy
of England during and since the
Spanish War is the latest evidence
of English Diplomacy in shaping the
destiny of the United States Govern
ment
Notwithstanding the famine price
of wheat the Spanish War and fabu
lous expenditures of money by our
government during the past year gold
has increased in value eleven per cent
and all other values decreased in the
same proportion
For a thorough understanding of
the money question or silver issue
the Cincinnati Enquirer has uniformly
given evidence of its ability to teach
explain and produce all facts and
truth It is a paper that ought and
can be read by all classes with pleas
