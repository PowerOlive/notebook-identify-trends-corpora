1 General Horace Porter in the course
of a recent speech said Boston is not
a city it is a state of mind This dec
laration was greeted with laughter by
unthinking New Yorkers who failed to
see Gfeneral Porters point He meant
that as much mind is found in Boston
-as in an average state We thank Gen

In these seekers
wayside- Anrergne candidate for Sheriff 8ubject to the
after hair were known as chmmeurs of the Democratic ofrr
The Bretons called them margoulins
These terms have not fit English paral
lels
These curious jouigieymeii exerted
every effort to gain their ends a good
-head of hair the former preferring the
local fairs as a workroom the latter
choosing to visit the dwellings of their
possible clients In summer the Brittany
margoulin was often seen going through
the streets carrying his long staff from
which hung twists of hair while he
cried in doleful tones the well known
Piau piau at the sound of which
the cottagers with an itching desire to
possess some of his gewgaws attracted
the wanderers attention He was only
too pleased to dazzle their eyes with his
many colored wares and the bargaining
was not slow to begin While the women
fingered his goods the margoulin weigh
ed her Presses with his hand a proceed
ing at which he was adept through long
practice The bargain ended the woman
yielded her abundant locks in return for
a few yards of cotton stuff or a gay pet
ticoat to which thanks to the progress
of civilization the coupeur had to add a
small sum of money Sometimes the
transaction was not completed without
much discussion on both sides Very
often the coupeur had to return to the
charge owing to female indecision and
he was more than happy when sure that
a tardy remorse would not rob him of
half his coveted trophy
Until the authorities intervened cut
ting was conducted in public as an
amusement for onlookers it being con
sidered highly entertaining to hear 10
or 12 rival coupeurs eulogizing their
wares each protesting his to be far su
perior to his fellows The prohibition
of this custom drove the hair harvesters
to erect tents rent for the day unoccu
pied shops cellars stables or any corner
they could find wherein to establish
themselves Stioks were then stuck up
from them being suspended petticoats
as a lure as an indication of what could
be had in exchange for tresses to the
petticoats were attached twists of hair
as trademarks The ruse succeeded
peasants halted casting envious glances
at the multicolored garments They
were handled and even tried on thus
affording an opportunity to the coupeurs
to flatter their fair customers who did
not long rest and victory rewarded the
-cute buyers In Auvergne where the
coupeurs were most numerous the
greatest harvest was reaped on St Johns
- day The ingathering extended from
- April to September during which month
the butchers bakers locksmiths etc
forsook their ordinary avocations for
that of the coupeur returning to their
legitimate trades with the coming of
the dead season The hair of different
countries was distinguished by certain
v qualities For instance that of Au-
- vergne was the coarsest the finest and
tjnost flaxen from Belgium the blackest
and longest from Italy while that pro
cured in Brittany was the most beauti
ful though least well cared for--Hearth

HARVEST OF HAIR
HOW THE COUPEURS GATHERED IT
FROM THE HEADS OF THE POOR
Wiles Employedto Get a Woman to Part
With Her Chief Glory There Was Al
ivays a Sure Market For False Hair Was
Worn by AH Fashionable Indies
History records the fact that in 1682
in England long flaxen hair was pur
chased from the head at 10 shillings an
ounce while other fine hair fetched
from 5 to 7 shillings for the same quan
tity and within the present century the
heads of whole families in DeTonshire
were let out by the year at so much per
poll a periwig maker of Exeter going
xound at certain periods to cut the locks
afterward oiling the skull of eck bereft
person That the use of false hair as an
aid to feminine beauty was not unknown
to the ancients is well proved The
Greeks Romans and Egyptian long
before the dawn of the Christian era
resorted to the wearing of tresses ob
tained from otner persona heads They
even went so far as to pain bald heads
so as to represent them aa covered with
short hair also marble caps so painted
were worn A valuable merchandise in
the blond hair of German women is
mentioned in ancient Romaa history
A question that has doubtless often
presented itself is Where did all this
hair come from This question I will
endeavor to answer With the coming
of spring in the midlands and west of
Prance appeared what may fitly be
termed a singular class of nomadic indi
viduals armed with long iron tipped
staves and bearing heavy packs of mer
chandise upon their backs At first
glance one would have taken them to
be ordinary hawkers yet merchandise
was but an accessory to their strange
industry They were the coupeurs the
reapers of a hirsute harvest
Armed with long keen shears they
went their way seeking the tresses of
willing victmis dwelling in outlying
hamlets and villages of peasant France
and a laborious business it was From
