NEW ANNEX TO MASSIE HOSPI
TAL THROWN OPEN.
The colored people of the city and
county were given an opportunity on.
Wednesday morning to pay a visit of
inspection to the new annex to the
Massie Memorial Hospital, in this
city, which was made possible mainly
through contributions by them.
The new building was erected and
equipped at a total cost of about
$18,000, and is to be used as a hos
pital adjunct for the treatment and
care of colored patients. It is a com
plete hospital in itself; has its own
reception hall, dining room, kitchen,
operating room, warfs and bed rooms
and will accommodate fifteen pati
ents very comfortably. In the mat-
given smaller increases, all employes
who received less than $46 a month
are given a flat increase of $20 with
the provision that laborers paid by
the day shall get a minimum of 2
cents an hour above the rate six
months. s
The table of increases, as announc
ed, itemized for each dollar of wages
received in December, 1915, may be

To figure the increase he will get,
each employe should determine the
pay which his present position car
ried in December, 1915, for if he has
been promoted or demoted, his new
wage is based upon the 1915 pay of
the position which he now holds. In
creases which have accompanied pro
motions are not increases in the sense
of the new schedule, since "the wage
runs with the place," not with the
man.
. Back pay due under the retroactive
increases will be sent to any man who
has been dismissed from the railroad
service since January 1, or who has
entered the army or navy, but not to
an employe who quit voluntarily.
