"There are probably from forty to
fifty thousand more persons attend
ing Sunday schools in Kentucky than
ever before," Rev. George A. Joplin,
general secretary of the Kentucky
Sunday School Association said in
discussing the outlook for the year
1922. The workers of the State or
ganization have undertaken with the
coming of the new year, he said, to
add 100,000 more to the rolls by

"During the war," said Mr. Joplin,
"in Kentucky, as in most of the
States, there was a decrease in the
enrollment of Sunday schools of the
State. However, this decrease was
small as compared with other States.
"While great effort is being made
to add to the number attending Sun
day school, still greater effort is be
ing put forth to improve the teach
ing in the Sunday schools. In many
towns of the States there are commu

federations of adult classes and offi
cers associations that met from
month to month and make plans tea.
