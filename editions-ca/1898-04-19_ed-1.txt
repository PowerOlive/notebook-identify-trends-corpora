Ship Maine in Havana HarborGen Blanco Had Nothing to Do With thBlowing Up of the Vessel He Weptat the Palace Over the Terrible SeedWashington April 15 The testimony of Gen Lee given to the senateforeign relations committee was madepublic Thursday TThe most interesting portion of theconsul generals testimony that relating-to the Maine was lengthy Leesaid he was informed that the Spaniards had placed two rows of torpedoesat the mouth of the Havana harbor byMorro castlev within the last twomonths or subsequent to the Mainedisaster and that the switchboard was5n a room in the castle lie said bowel er that he had no information ofthe placing of any torpedoes beforethe Maine was destroyedThe letter of Gen Weyler broughtto light by Correspondent Laine wasreferred to Lee thought the lettergenuine This belief was based on aTelegram of which he knew It camefrom Weyler and read Grave circumstances cause me to ask you to destroythe last letter of February IS GenLee said that this telegram had neverbefore been publishedWith reference to the responsibilityfor the destruction of the Maine OnLee saidI am satisfied the explosion wasfrom the outside I have always hadan idea about the Maine that of courseit was not blown up by any private individual or by any private citizen butwas blown up by some of the officerswho had charge of the mines and electrical wires and torpedoes in the arsenal there who thoroughly understoodthe businessGen Lee said he did not- believeCapt Gen Blanco had anything to dowith it or even any knowledge of itHis reason for this belief was that hesaw Blanco just after the disaster andtears were coming from his ejes Heregretted it as much as anyone inHavanaLee said he thought the explosionwas the work of some of the subalternofficers who had been under WeylerGen Lee said he had seen a copy ofa telegram from Adm Manterol datedin Havana prior to the explosion tothe Spanish commission in Londonasking the commission to hurry upthe electrical cables Whether thatreferred to wire for submarine minesor torpedoes he did not knowHe continued I heard two or threedays afterward said Gen Lee in answer to a question by Senator Fryethat there was a great deal of rejoicing-among some of the officers Allreports I got said they were drinkingchampagne quite a thing to do in honor of the event and in different portions of the city officers were makingmerryHe said that he had not heard anythreats of or allusions to thetion of the Maine previous to the ex-Senator Lodge asked if he had heardof an attempt on the MontgomeiyGen Lee answered that he had heardtalk to that effect but it was found hbelieved on investigation that it didnot amount to anythingIn reply to a question by ForakerLee said he was sure no novice couldliave destroyed the Maine The workwas well done and by an expertContinuing he said I never havebeen certain thatthe submarine explosive was placed there prior to theentrance of the Maine into the barberIt might have been done afterwardThe Maine was anchored to a buoy bysome little chain A vessel swingingaround that wa3 sometimes gets atvarious places all around the circleWhen she would swing oif that waywith the bow next to the buoy and- these boats plying about the harbor allthe time an3 body could go pretty wellin front of her on a dark aright anddrop one of these submarine mines of500 poundsThey have fingers as it were andas the boat goes around it would touchthe fingers which makes coutact andexplodes the mine That might havebeen done after the Maine got in thereOne or two men in a boat could drop itoff the stern of the boat on a darknight The harbor is full of littleboats A mine weighs about 500pounds and I suppose it would takeprobably three or four men to handleThe Cubans he said were all for freeCuba The reconcentrados conditionhe said in reply to another questionwere almost as bad as Weylers daysSuppose Havana was blockadedsaid Senator Mills -so that no provisions could go in would the peoplethere have any way to get anyNone whatever responded GenLee The town would surrender ina short while- Gen Lee said that all but about 300000 Spaniards of the population ofCuba were CubansLee in speaking of the physical condition of the Spanish soldiers saidthat it was very poorSpanish Parliament to Open Next WednesdayMadrid April 15 A cabinet councilJias decided to

PASSESThe Resolutions Recognizing the Independence of the Cuban RepublicProminent Republicans in the House Conaider This a Direct Slap at the President and Will Bitterly Oppose Such a measureWashington April 18 Monday thedifficult task of adjusting the differences between the two houses of congress on the Cuban resolutions beganThe rock upon which the two housessplit is the recognition of the independence of the existing republicwhich was incorporated in the senateresolutions Were that clause of thesenate resolutions eliminated nothingcould have prevented immediate concurrence by the house as the greatmajority of the republicans of the lower branch of congress are eager for aconclusion Eut the action of the senate declaring for the recognition oiCubas independence against the directand specific recommendation of thepresident has given the conservativesa rallying cr3 from the standpoint ofparty alty which proved very effective Saturda3 One of the

allied herself with us in the revolutionary warit was for the purpose of gaining ourindependence but we were held to thecompact by a stipulation that no peacewith Great Eritain should be negotiated without Frances consent Morethan this it is claimed that thereare evidences that the senate will yieldthe recognition of independence ifthe house stands firm Notwithstanding the large majority for the

governmenthas received no intimation of thepreparation of any note on the part ofthe powers and members of the cabinet do not think the effort obviouslymaking by Spain to concentrate thepowers in her favor will result in theiragreeing on any particular line of action The present position of the administration is that of awaiting congressional action without attemptingto influence it or postpone itsdecisionThe president it can be stated is notat all likely to veto any resolution thatcongress may adopt on the Cubanquestion The administration does notbelieve congress will pass a resolutionfor the recognition of independence ofthe insurgents but if it shoulda veto of it would be very improbableIt is said however that the presidentmight regard it as an encroachmenton his prerogative the

FRANK BRANDRAMrwould not have dignified himYOU the description of a littlexman Little is no word to convey anidea of the lack of size He wasulouslv foolishly small diminutivefrail and utterly insignificant in appearance He could not have stoodmore than four feet six and he wasslight in proportion But his facewore a look of preternatural gravityYou might have imagined that upon hisshoulders had he any shoulders tospeak of rested the cares of an empire He looked like a boy masqerading with the head and face of a man reduced in size so as to suit his juvenilebod And the solemnity of his features was intensified by his clothingwhich was of the most funereal typoHe was dressed in a suit of black withblack hat black tic and even black cuffbuttons and he carried a blackthornstick almost as big as himselfIn most people you can trace a resemblance to some animal or bird orilsh if you are gifted with any imagination at all and this man reminded mevery forcibly of a jackdaw He had aretreating chin and prominent nosewhich in profile looked very much likea bill Then he had a peculiar way ofcocking up one of his little ferrety eyesand looking at you out of the cornerof it just as a jackdaw doesWhen I heard him speak I found thathis voice was as weak and insignificantas his general appearance It was amean kind of voice I dont know howotherwise to describe itI suppose if I had met the little manen the street 1 might have turned roundfor a second to look after him and thengone on about my business withouttroubling my head any more about himHut I was so placed that I had nothingto do for some minutes but watch themanikin and the consequence was that1 did trouble my head about him Heseemed to fascinate me I could notlake nvy eyes off him And after I hadlooked at him for some time a feeling ofirritability seemed to come over me Ifelt a curious longing to pick him upbetween my finger and thumb and drophim overboard into the dockFor it was on board an ocean linerthatlmei thisminiaturepieceof humanity I was waiting for the vessel tosail on her voyage to New York Mydiminutive friend was on the deck apparently talcing leave of a lady passenger While he was -perhaps 40years of age judged her to be about2S anil she was a woman of normalsize and pleasant appearance so different from her companionHe looked so little so utterlypracticable that there Reemcd to be noreason no necessity nor any excuse forhis existence at ail And he had withall his povtentuous solemnity a certaindeprecating expression his lips werecontinually twitching with a nervouskind of movement as though he wereframing an apology for being alive atallAt last came the signal for allstrangers to go ashoreWell good by my dear said the little man standing on tiptoe to kiss thelady and speaking in that irritatinglypiping voice of his Give my loveto but the finish of the sentence waslost to me as he was hustled off theboatI watched him go down the gangwaynndthen stand at- the docksideAt last the vessel swung loose fromher moorings and as she moved slowlyout into the Mersey the last I saw of mylittle friend with his black suit blackhat black tic black cuff buttons andgeneral undertakers air was his waving a farewell salute to the lady passenger with a black bordered handkerchiefWhen I turned back to look at the lachyI saw there were tears in her eyes andthen it occurred to me that the frailundersized fellow was better off than Ilor there was no eye to moisten at mydeparture from Liverpool there wouldbe none io lighten on my return to XewYorkI found that the ladys name was MrsJohnson a common enough namebut had I been inclined Ihadiio opportunity of learning anything from herconcerning her microscopical friendm i lffriiilII wmi njMtynnfor she kept to her stateroom throughout the entire voyageI never saw her after the first dayuntil she came on deck on our arrivalat New YorkAs we came into dock I saw her makefor the side of the boat and commencewaving- a handkerchief to some oneamong st the crowd on shoreLooking- in the direction in which shewas gazing I saw her signal answeredand answered with a black borderedhandkerchief ThenNow in the name of all that is1 infernal how the deuce did he get hereThere standing on the dock closeto the boat was my friend the manikinwith the same undaunted air of solemnity the same biack suit the sameblack hat black tie and black cuff buttons waving the same black borderedhandkerchiefI was puzzled Not only that I wasmad The same feeling of irritationwith which his appearance on the boatin Liverpool had inspired me came backintensified The same longing to pickhim up between my fiiiger and thumbreturned with uncontrollable forceUnfortunately or perhaps fortunately for him and me too Tlost sight ofhim in the hurry and bustle of land-mjrOn my way to the hotel I kept wondering how on earth this remarkablemorsel of humanity had got to XewYork ahead of us He could not havecome as a stowaway on our boat forI saw him standing on the dock whenwe left Liverpool nd I found himstanding on the dock when we reachedXew YorkHe could not have come by anotherline for the ship in which I had crossedwas the fastest Atlantic liner afloatand we had made a record voyageAnd yet the fact remained that I hadleft him in Liverpool and that I foundhim in Xew York on my arrivalThere was something I did not likeabout it something uncanny unnatural If he had intended crossing theAtlantic why did he not come by thesame steamer as his lady friend MrsJohnson Where was the necessity forthe tearful leave taking or the demonstrative reunionThen there came into my mind thethought that this was no man at allHe was a a spook anelf a goblinThe thing played upon my mind as Idrove to the hotel until I felt impelledto report the matter to the police Ibelieve I should have done this had nottwo considerations restrained me Thefirst wis that I had no time to spare andthe second was that I was afraid ofmaking a fool of myselfEventually I concluded that my manikin must have solved the problem ofaerial navigation and that he hadcrossed the Atlantic in an airshipAnd when I remembered his bird likeappearance I was more than half inclined to accept this theory as a correct oneI had just time to take a good dinner at the Hoffman house and thenI had to hurry off to the depot to catchthe night express for Chicago I hadbusiness there which required my immediate attention There was a MrPeckitt in the Windy city to whom Ihad a letter from a Liverpool merchantand whom it was necessary for me tosee at the earliest possible momentT had boarded thedrain and sat looking out of the window when T caughtsight of Mrs Johnson coming along theplatform with the MiteThe train was just on the point ofstarting and after thcy had gonethrough the same performance of kissin it as in Liverpool Mis Johnson rotinto the oar leaving the manikin standing on the platform As we steamedcut of the station I saw him waving afarewell signal with the old black-borderedhandkerchiefWell thank goodness thats the lastoC him said to myself as I turned into my sleeper Flying machine or noflying machine he cant get ahead ofthe train even if he did beat the steamshipI slept soundly and did not awakenuntil roused by the black porter in themorningNow may all the powers of darkness seize him was my prayer as onreaching Chicago I saw the little manstanding in the station waving hisblack bordered handkerchief to MrsJohnsonThere was the identical manikinwhom I had left- standing on the docksat Liverpool eight days ago and leftagain on the railway platform at Xewlork the nijrht beforeThe same black suit the same blackhat black tie black stick the sameblack bordered handkerchief waving inthe breezeIt was puzzling It was annoying Itook it as a personal affront Whyshould this travesty of mankind pursue me with such pestilent pertinacityCould I not go anywhere in this wideworld without meeting that eif like figure and having that garb of unutterable woe presented to my unwillingeyes Were there no means of puttinga quietus to this omnipresent mimicryoC humanity 1 should go crazy if itwas to be my fate to meet him at everycorner and crossroad in life Thisthing had gone far enough and I wasdetermined to put a stop to itI swore ttiat if he were am actualentity a real corporeal creature andnot a spook or a phantasm of the mindI would have him arrested as soon asI put foot on th groundBut my resftution was somewhatshaken by a sudden fear which tookjossessi6n of me Ibegan to entertaindoubts as id my ownsanityWas it possible I asked myself thatthat singular appearance of the dwarfin Liverpool had so impressed itselfupon my mind and worked upon myimagination during the enforced idleness of the voyage that I was beginsning to conjure up dwarfs at every turnand corner and see manikins wherethere were no manikins Who wouldbelieve such a story asthat a little man whom I had left behind in Liverpool had got to Xew Yorkbefore me and then after leaving himbehind in Xew York that he had got toChicago ahead of meBut the manikin I had only toproduce him in proof of my assertionI looked around for the object of mythoughts and then I found that I wastoo late Both he and Mrs Johnson haddisappeared While I had been debating within myself the question of myown sanity the whichwas undoubtedly working to unbalancemy reason had made good its escapeNever mind my little man I muttered only wait till I catch youasramAbout ten oclock after I had eatensome breakfast I set out for Mr Peckitts officeThere I was ushered by a clerk intoan inner room where to my utter consternation 1 found the diminutive figure in black with Mrs Johnson sittingopposite to itMr Peckitt I said in a scarcely audible voice for I had every reason tobelieve Peckitt to be a person of consideration in the commercial worldnot a spook or by anymeans but ainan of substanceYes sir Mr Peckitt answered inI suppose as pleasant a manner as hecould assume but nevertheless in thatirritatingly piping voice of his andwith that inexpressibly careworn lookwhich I had noticed in Liverpool andXew York Yes sir he repeated Iam delighted to meet you I have received letters from Liverpool concerning your business and shall be mosthappy to go into that matter with youat any time Allow me sir to introduce you to my sister Mrs JohnsonI went through the formality of theintroduction without venturing anyremark upon the fact that I had comeover from Liverpool to Xew York in thesame boat and traveled from Xew Yorkto Chicago in the same train as theladyWe talked on indifferent subjects fora few minutes and then when conversation seemed to be flagging I saidtentativelyI observe that you are in mourningMr Peckitt Peckitt How singularlyappropriate the cognomen to his birdlike appearance I trust you havehad no recent bereavementAh my dear sir Mr Peckitt answered the loss of one near and dearto us is always recent There arc somelosses the bitterness of which eventime cannot assuageHe did not volunteer any furtherstatement as to thd nature of his lossso after a moments silence I saidsomewhat hesitatinglyMight I ask how long it is since youwere in England Mr PeckittTwo years he repliedTwo years And it was only eightdays since I had seen him there Therewas undoubtedly some deep mysteryhere Had he sinister motives for wishing to conceal his movements or wasIt that he only wished to keep the method of his marvelous flight through spacea secret for some not unworthy reason uThat is strange I murmured unintentionally giving vent to InyJthoughtsStrange Mr Peckitt echoed in aninquiring toneWhy yes I answered desperatelyfor I thought Ave might as well come toan understanding now as later I didhoc want to do business with a manabout whom hung such peculiar mystery I could have sworn that 1 sawou in Liverpool in company with thislady only eight days agoAh ah Mr Peckitt exclaimed relaxing for an instant his habitual oppressingausterity of expression Thatwas my brother JohnSo Then you are twinsXo sir he replied not twinsThere were more than two ofusAh Xow I begin to understandYou have also a brother in Xew YorkYes sir Mr Peckitt assented Mybrother WilliamOh oh Then you are tripletsXo sir Mr Peckitt answered in asorrowful tone There was anotherthe best and brightest of all my brother Henry But he alas he is deadPoor Henry is no moreAnd it is for him you and yourbrothers are in mourningYes sirAnd he has been deadSeventeen years Mr Peckitt answered as he wiped away the tearswith his black bordered

extraordinary story corneabv way of a Lewistonman who not longngo visited the Maine and heard thestory from one of the sailors It seemsthat a San Francisco man was shanghaied from the city of the Golden Gateby a Japanese trading vessel That ishe was got drunk by one of the sailorsacting in the employ of the captain ofthe ship and when he was fully intoxicated he was carried on board the vessel and stowed in a bunk in the crewsquartersWhen he came to himself the vesselwas a long distance outside of the golden bars and the man was very mad Hegot into the cabin of the captain andwould have killed him but for the factthat he was overcome from behind bythe mate who shut off his wind with apiece of rope made in a noose Tlieunmanageable shanghaied was put intothe glory hole to cool off on bread andwaterAt the end of five days the captaincalled down and inquired if he wantedto come out and go to work His onlyanswer was a hallooed invitation forthe captain to go down below and drinkfrom the lake of fire and brimstoneAt Honolulu some generous soulamong the crew filed off the shacklesof the man and he swam ashore Thenhe tried to get back to the states Butnone of the steamers would let
