Way to Rest.
Lying flat on the floor Is a good
way to r"est and relax, but a much bet
ter way is to lie flat on the4 floor with
legs up to the knees resting on a
chair. This changes the entire circu
lation and is the very quickest way
to rest. To rest the eyes and make
them bright, while lying down have
them bandaged with a soft black silk
handkerchief.
