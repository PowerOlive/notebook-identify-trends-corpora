DJJTTCTJLT TO INCREASE CHURCH
ATTENDANCE
The average man will go to a
circus, or a show, or a ball game,
and consider the money well spent.
He will imbibe a certain amount of
information of some value, but gen
erally it is soon forgotten.
Nevertheless, he is ever ready
and anxious to go again.
He could spend an hour or so at
church on Sunday, drop a few nick
els in the collection box, and re
ceived more real and lasting benefit
than would be derived from, a dozen
shows or ball games.
Yet it is difficult to get him there.
Sometimes we wonder if it would
not be easier to fill a church by
charging a stiff admission at the
door.
We seem to place a higher value
on things that cost us the most, re
gardless of their worth.
Or -jKfi might stage a dog fight as
an attraction. That would bring
'em running.

MYSTERY MIXED WITH GASO
LINE' AND AUTOMOBILE
An abondoned automobile, des
erted and alone, with its rear
wheels projecting dejectedly into the
air, furnished considerable specula
tion Saturday morning for passers-by
on the Maysville pike, a few miles
below Paris. The machine, a Ford
sedan, had skidded to one side of the
road and landed 4n the roadside
ditch, with the rear wheels up in the
air, and the radiator buried in the
mud.
The license tags had been removed
from the machine, and no one could
be found who had witnessed the ac
cident or who knew anything that
would throw light on the mysterv of
how the machine came there. Some
time later in the day the machine
was removed, but no one knew who
did that or when it was done.
