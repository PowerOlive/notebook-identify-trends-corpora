better Therevolution is spreading and the Christians are in most cases fighting underthe flag- of GreeceThe commanders of the foreign men-of war now lying- off Canea persuadedthe commander of the

his ministers are now inperfect accord on the subject of theCretan policy and a royal decree hasbeen published to the effect that allavailable Greek warships shall beput into commission and requiring- thatseveral of them be sent to Crete withthe least possible delayThe conservative element in the legislative chamber is opposed to the policy of seizing- the island in defiance ofthe powers They argue that Greeceshould not attempt to annex the islanduntil she is assured of the support ofsome one of the great powers Theyclaim further that Europe is not prepared to sanction anything that mightserve to impel the Turkish problem toward solution at this time It is possible they assert that the warships ofoher nations will co operate in reestablishing-if not maintaining- peaceand that King- George may be servedwith notice that he must not overridethe European guarantee of Turkish reforms on the island of CreteOn the other hand the radical element insist that Crete should be annexed to Greece

and OwnersPETS SPREAD DISEASEMany Cases of Scarlet Fever Diphtheriaand Other Maladies Traced to CatsA common cuse of the widespreadprevalence of Infectious diseases hasbeen traced to an unusual and unsuspected source It has been found thatcats and other household pets are responsible for the scattering- of the microbes of coutagious diseaseHousehold pets are in the habit ofwandering out of doors even when themost careful vigilance is kept over themCats and dogs especially are in the habitof taking nocturnal excursions to garbage-ladenalleys and into the very central point- of disease and contagionThey have a peculiar penchant for making daily calls at our neighbors houseespecially when encouraged to come forthe sake of entertaining a sick childCats more particularly than dogs onaccount of their domestic habits havelong been suspected of being a partialfactor in conveying infection Physicians and students have of late begun a series of investigations wherewith to prove their well founded suspicions And they have inaugurated acrusade against any sort of living thingIn the way of a pet to prevent theirincursion and excursion where there is-diseaseCareful investigation has proved that-a great part of the diphtheria prevalentin the city and nearly all of the scarletfever has been traced to cats They not-only are subject to the disease itselfbut are also the means of a direct transference of microbes But diphtheriaand scarlet fever contagion has notbeen the sole extent of the evil Severalcases of smallpox -have been reportedby health officers in different parts ofthe country which have been broughtabout in the same way that is by a catfrom an infected house bringing disease to the family of a neighbor Another case is reported in Chicago ofcontagion where a rabbit was loanedas a plaything to a child with measlesX ater the innocent dumb beast was sentback carrying death in its very contactthrough the thoughtlessness and ignoance of both families concerned Innumerable cases of deadly typhus havebeen met with which have been inducedby the same means Yet people continue to wonder at the spread of disease and in their criminal carelessnesspermit their household pets to wanderabout at liberty Medical journals havebeen aroused of course by the reportsof investigators and by vigorous editorials and reports of specific cases aredrying to warn the community at leastagainst a terrible and newly unearthedevil French publications have offeredfheir assistance in the crusade Constcteuable space was given to a peculiarcase of a seamstress in Paris who inLev solitude and loneliness was in ihehabit of permitting her dog to lick herface At one time her pet who was alarge St Bernard remained away awhole week from the protecting roof ofhis mistress On his return her joywas so unbounded that she fondled himmore than ever Suddenly she was attacked with a severe inflammation ofthe right eye The cause was unknownSeveral oculists were visited and consuited but the treatment in every casewas unsuccessful The right eye became a swollen hideous mass and thesight was totally destroyed In thecourse of time the inflammation beganto spread to the left eye and to preventthe certain fatal influence the other eyewas cut out Upon careful examination a hideous -discover was madeWithin the member back of the corneawas found a tapeworm This the doghad probably picked up while lickingsome diseased and foul object whenaway from home and had transferreddt on his return to his mistress cheekCats and dogs are known to be indiscriminate and careless in the choice ofobjects on which they exercise theirtongues Then on account of theiryeal in licking the hands and faces of-their masters great danger lies in thetransmission of parasites Contagionby this means is simple and easy and itis marvelous that a greater amount ofhideous parasitic disease has not beenthe result Chicago Times Heraldhavingheard of that remarkable physical disorder which accompanied a religiousmovement which swept over the UnitedStates just prior to the war of 1812It was n fact a contao ious nervousdisease which for the want of bettedmime was called the jerks An earlyNew England writer who saw severalcases refers to this remarkable manifestation as follows The jerks tooktheir name from the fact that the wholebody was affected and that in a mostsingular fashion too The arms andlegs would be thrown about apparently by a force beyond control of theaffected individual Sometimes theJiead would be thrown backward andforward with great violence Occasionally the entire bodj would be affected and in such cases the victimwould fall upon the ground and flounceabout like a 5sh out of water Thedisorder soon became epidemicattacking a whole religious assemblage at one time making no distinction between the impious and thepious The only relief was to graspsomething and hold fast until the fitpossed off The disease if such it maybe called usually left its victimsbadly prostrated and in morethan one instance death ensuedduring the attack usually frombroken necks or violent concussions and contusions during the convulsion The

Armstrong in Chicago PostIE vicar of Whinfield was not popular witk his parishioners Hewas one of thosemen who without meaning to be disagreeable nevertheless make themselvesdisliked wherever they go he realreason was that he was utterly devoidof tact He seldom failed- to say thewrong thing especially when it was essential that he should say the rightIf there was a chance of putting his footinto it into it as sure as egg has footwent If he was obliged in the exercise of his duties to make an unpleasant remark he was absolutely certain tosay it in the most unpleasant wayThese unfortunate proclivities were always displaying themselvesThere was another little point abouthim which increased his unpopularityespecially among the tradesmen ofthe place He was near in the matterof money He seemed to have a constitutional aversion to parting with itEven when an account was due lie invariably dallied in the discharging ofthe same and though he always paidup in the end he often kept shopmenwaiting longer than they cared aboutIt was really a fad of his a mereidiosyncrasy and did not arise fromanv conscious churlishness But the ishopkeepers of Whinfield regraded itshopkeepers of Whinfield regarded itniggardly nature and though theysupplied the vicar because it was worththeir while they nevertheless dislikedhim with all their commercial soulsWhinfield was a small place of 1500inhabitants something between a tinytown and an overgrown village Ithad quite a fair number of shopsbutcher baker fishmonger grocerlinendraper ironmonger wine merchant and tobacconist It was servedby a doctor eke by an auctioneer Butthere was one importantthingnottobehad there namely law Kb solicitorhad yet found it worth his while to settle in so small a placeButaboutthe middleof October a yearor two since a solicitor did at lengthmake his appearance and set up inWhinfield His name was Perks Hewas a shrewd dapper little man of prepossessing exterior and insinuatingwavs who soon made to himself friendsAlthoughhis mannerwas bland and courteous it was prettyobvious that he was not quite a gentleman But as very f ew persons in Whinfield except the squire and the vicarhad any pretensions to that distinction the solicitors lack of the pure jhaut ton was no barrier to his gettingon Perhaps indeed it rather helpedhim since it was to the tradesmen andfarmers that he would chiefly nave tolook for business and they preferreda man with whom they could associateon a footing of equalityThis is just what Perks did He constantly went to the tradesmens housesHe dined and supped with them Hedid the civil to their wives and daughters He often dropped in casually inthe afternoon for a cup of tea or in theevening for a pipe and a glass of grogThis naturally made him -popular intheir circleMr Perks is quite the gentlemansaid Mrs Grocer Hobb and theres nonasty pride about him neitherTrue Maria asserted Hobb herspouse a fat and prosperous figurePerks is a good sort And if I have abit of lawyering to be done Ill put it iiPerks wayFor the first month or two after hisarrival in Whinfield Perks was a regularattendant at the parish church It wasthe proper the respectable thing to doBesides to get in with the vicar evenrTHE BOUKBON NEWS gERI DAY FBRTTAEY 12 1897when the vicar is unpopular may pay the vicar in the place They amountedo ucHtumci tMj weu ui i wuuuj jointly tc aoout zuu poundsBut the vicar did not take to Perks atall From the first he had shown a dislike to him and nothing that the solicitor did to ingratiate himself in thatquarter made any difference At theWHATS ALLPerks however was a smart man andhe managed in the end to engineerhis scheme He was it may be addedprovidentially assisted in this matterby the vicar himself Just at the rightminute from Perks standpoint thereverend gentleman had complained toGrocer Hobb about the quality of thebacon supplied him and had indeedsent back half a side as unfit to eatSomething of the same sort happenedin reference to Shanks the butcherShanks had a sirloin returned to himon the ground of its being cow beefIt was cow beef But Shanks had soldit for ox beef and he felt it an unwarrantable insult to have his word thusquestionedButcher Shanks was not logical norwas Grocer Hobb And each was ledby his dislike for the vicar to believethat the vicar himself hadpurpcaelyinsulted him Perks rejoiced to findthem both in this mood He struckwhile the iron was hot ne unfolded tothem his pretty little scheme for givingthe vicar beans If they and the othertradesmen in the place to whom thevicar owed bills would combine aidhand him their accounts to collect hewould soon read his reverence a lessonHe would teach him to be careful howhe insulted honest tradesmenGrocer Hobb and Buteher Shanksliked the idea of the vicar being taughtthat lesson But they made it a sinequa non that if they did this thing theother creditors of the vicar in Whinfield should do likewisePerks undertook to see the othsrj creditors and if possible to secure1 their compliance He saw them heI talked to them in his most insinuatingway he worked upon their unqualifiedhatred for the vicar The end of it wasthat the solicitor was instructed toIppt tllA KPVPTI Inrnroet nwnnnfe Ta vvluvw vritvu uyform of a valentine He had not toldhis clients the exact strain in which heshould write nor the extreme peremptoriness of the demand he should makeBut the letter which he posted to thevicar on Valentines eve was as good aspecimen of the sharp practice solicitorscomposition when intentionally insolent as could be well desired Thegist of it was that unless the wholeamount due on these seven accountswere paid to him Sdney Perks by return of post he should issue processagainst the vicar without further notice or delayThere said Perks to himself triumphantly as he sealed up the envelopeI calculate this will just about give hisreverence fitsIt did give his reverence fits That isto say it put him into a fine state ofrage and excitement when he read it atbreakfast next morning- His angrylooks and savage frowns struck decided consternation into the breasts oithe two other persons who were sharingthat meal with him These were hisonly daughter Amy and his nephewFrank Miller a young barrister whof requently came down from town whenhe was not very busy to stay at thevicarage The fact was there had longexisted a sort of attachment betweenthe cousins of which the vicar was unaw are It had not however developedinto an express engagement until thatvery morning when young Miller coming down early and finding his cousinin the garden had taken the opportunity for which the day was so singularly appropriate of declaring a passion which he could not any longer concealAmy had answered his proposal witha blushing acceptance stipulatingIt was then the end of the first weekin February and Perks intention wathat the vicar should receive his agreeable communication on the mornin ofv aientrnes day Perks had a tolerablemi notion ot eirect and he considered tihathowever that Frank should inform herfather of the circumstances immediately and this he had of course agreedto He did not however look forwardto the interview with any great pleasureor confidence for two sufficient reasonsIn the first place he knew that his unclehad a prejudice against first cousinsmarrying in the next his own

might if hechose make his only daughter a goodallowance But whether he would doso or would even countenance the engagement at all was a decidedly doubtful matter though Frank believed thatif he could manage to catcih his reverence in a good humor he might be abletc talk him roundFranks and Amys dismay therefore when they saw that the vicar hadbeen seriously put out of temper by hiscorrespondence can well be understood more especially as he was a manwho did not get over the effects ofprovocation at all quicklyr and had aplayful little way of venting his ani noyance on all who came near him-whether concerned in the provocationor not The worst of it wasFrank wasbound to be back in London in five or sixdays at the leastv and of course his interview with his uncle must take placebefore

forbidding Perks put up withseveral snubs from him pour le bonmotif But at length seeing the uselessness of such a course he abandonedfurther attempts to win the vicarsfriendship and openly declared himselfon the side of the reverend gentlemansenemiesThere was scarcely ar tradesman inWhinfield who was not to be numberedin this category Prom Grocer Hobbdownwards every one of them had hisgrievance against the vicar Treatsme like a dog he does said oneNever calls to see me when Im illsaid another Is always grumbling atmy meat said a third the localbutcher And so forth While in onecommon grievance against him all concurred namely his tiresome habitalready mentioned of keeping themwaiting for their little accountsTisnt as if he was hard up was theunanimous complaint He has plentyof money He simply does it to makehimself disagreeableOf course Perks heard these grumblesin his almost daily intercourse with thetradesmen of Whinfield The solicitorin spite of his bland exterior and Insinuating ways was not the man toforget a slight or to pardon a snubHe meant to give the vicar a Polandfor his Oliver when he saw the chanceand it occurred to him after some reflection that he might perhaps seethat chance in this aforesaid matterof the vicars little accountsIt was getting on into February andthe vicars Christmas bills still remained unsettled Perks conceived awish that the tradesmen to whom thebills were due would put them into hishands for collection The wish strengthened into a longing the longing into afixed resolve He began by a gradualand insinuating process to get thetradesmen in the mind to cooperateThis was not such a very easy matterFor though the Whinfield shopkeepersgrowled at and disliked the vicar in nomeasured degree still his custom wasa consideration and glad as theywould have been to dohim a nasty turnthey nevertheless were not preparedto take a step which would drive himaway altogether from their shopshe received the dunning letter in thewas going to pay these seven accountsthis week Still to have the money demanded in such an impudent way is intolerable I shall certainly leave allthese tradesmen who have instructedPerksI sihould They deserve being madeto sit up But in any case it will bemuch more agreeable for you not tohave to act in the matter personallyYou leave it entirely in my handsThis after some demur the vicar atlength agreed to do Frank persuadinghim that it would be far more dignifiedfor him to have no personal communication whatever w7ith Perks or with thetradesmen And so the affair wasplaced unreservedly in the young barristers handsThe vicar rubbed his glasses andlooked at the letter again He felt thathis eyes must have deceived him Butno There the thing was in black andwhite unmistakably clear and evidentand as the vicar read it a second timehe -gave quite a gratified smile Butstill he was puzzledThe letter was as follows2 and 3 The Broadway Feb 18 183Reverend Sir In thanking you for yourmost generous and honorable behavior Itake the opportunity of apologizing withall my heart for what has occurred inreference to my account The truth isreverend sir that I was enticed by thedeceiving arts of a cheat and swindler andI need not say that I shall be only toopleased to cooperate in any steps that maybe taken for his arrest and punishmentYour grateful and obedientHEZEKIAH HOBBThe vicar opened a second letter whichhad arrived by the same post It wasfrom Shanks the butcher and was evenmore effusively apologetic than HobbsIt also referred to your having actedso honorable and like the gentlemanThe vicar looked still blander and moregratified but still decidedly puzzledThere were five other letters fromlocal tradesmen and all ran in much thesame strain not one of them omittingto eulogise him for his honorable conduct Never in bis life before had thereverend gentleman received seven suchflattering communications He did notin the least understand what theymeant but still they put him in an excellent humor Honorable CertainlytSy ViVvacting on his nephews advice he hadgiven him checks for distributionamong the seven tradesmen on the previous day but that was only a settlement rather a tardy one into the bargain of his just debts There wasnothing extraordinarily honorable inthat Still it is always nice to be acTknowledged honorable especially byyour enemies And when the vicar hadfinished reading the seventh letter hewas in a very good temper indeedAt that fortunate moment a knockcame at his study door and Frank entered Seeing the expression on hisuncles face and auguring therefromthe best results he lost no time in making his momentous confession aboutAmy The vicar exclaimed Hehummed and hawed- But he was in alieavenly temper and he ended by giving his consentThis is how Frank Miller had workedhis little scheme Sidney Perks was thesolicitor whom he had come across inI town and in certain dealings with himFrank had learnt some facts aboutPerks by communicating which to theproper authorities he could havebrought him to the bar of the Old BaileyPerks had tried to obviate such a possibility by promptly clearing out oftown Curiously enough he had betaken himself to the very place of whichFranks uncle was vicarArmed with these irresistible arguments Frank had on the morning ofValentines day gone straight to Perksoffice and under threat of setting thepolice on to him immediately had madetwo demands to which after some useless demur Perks was fain to consentThe first demand was that he shouldwrite out and hand over to Frank receipts for the seven accounts The second that he should leave Whinfieldwithin 12 hours Upon these conditionshe should be left to escape and lose himself unmolested Frank was inexorable and Perks was not in a position toresist So both demands were compliedwithFranks next step two days laterswas to go round and see the tradesmeninforming them that the vicar had dulypaid their accounts to Perks and producing the receipts he also ad visedthem in a f riendly way to look sharpafter their money as ugly rumors werecurrent about Perks and he was saidtchave bolted Those concernedlost no time in hurrying round to Perksoffice where he was not and thence tchis house which his servant told themhe had quitted hurriedly two days before Where had he gone Hehadnt left no address Then indeedwas bitter lamentation and outcry heardamong the swindled shopkeepers Thenit was that the vicar all unknown tohimself had acted so honorable andlike a gentleman by writing the checksfor the seven accounts and handingthem to Frank to distribute Thisastute young man had left the tradesmen under the impression that in orderto save them from loss his uncle hadpaid their accounts twice over and haddescanted in rather strong terms uponthis truly Christian return of- goodfojjevilFrank did not acq5iainthisunclewiththese little mysteries until he was juststarting on his honeymoon And as bythat time the vicar had tasted thesweets of six months popularity in theparish and found it exceptionally agreeable he saw no- reason to forfeit it atthis late hour by any useless disclosures London TruthA Natural MistakeOh look I

about 18 feetlbng arnd 18 inches in diameter and hasbeen completely turned to iron or rather to- the iron ore known as brownheraatite and Fjrof Carter accountaf orthe phenomenon by the fact that theshales and the sandstones in the neighborhood are covered with red oxide ofiron aud sometimes with brown hematite It is presumed that the iron orewas reduced in water containing csibonic acid gas then as the waier holding the iron in solution came in contact with the tree the iron was precipitated on the latter and there was no interchange of vegetable and mineralmatter so that the rocks were

ior the American farmer to contemplate at this time Some of themarc political some economic some social Some are due to the selfishnessand greed of man some to corrupt iniluences in public places some to ignorance as to remedies to be appliedHost of these discouragements are theoutgrowth of years and can be corrected only by time and experience Meanlime the farmer suffersBut the farmer cannot escape responsibility if he permits untowardconditions which are within his owncontrol to continue The other day arepresentative of the Farmers Voicein the cornbelt of Illinois who had stored up inhis granaries three crops of corn 1S94i5 96 and who would not sell a bushel because the price he had himselfJixed three years ago had tiot beenreached That man will doubtless growanother corn crop in 1S97 and mayhare to build a granary to accommodite it The leading grocer in one ofthe towns in the belt told the Voiceman that every cabbage he sold wasshipped in from ChicagoWe talk of competition and the crowding of population What will we do ifvv- pursue present methods when thepopulation is numbered by the hundreds of millions Let us learn now theJessons of intensive and economic farmirg scientific farming as practiced inthe old world Take the island of Jersey for example There are 45 squaremiles something more than an Illinoistownship and there are 60000 peopleWhat of its agriculture The islandcontains 12000 head of cattle or 62head to every 100 cultivated acres Theisland of Guernsey is but 25 squaremiles in extent sustains a population of30000 and 66 head of cattle to every100 cultivated acres is the rule Andthese little islands are the richest andbest farming lands to be found anywhereThe greatest reform the farmer canvc r secure will be of his own makingWhen American farmers adopt scientific methods there will be no hardtimes for them and the American farmers who do practice this method nowprove it Intelligent economical management of the farm careful reading ofthe market reports and study of theprinciples which underlie the businessof farming will make the Americanfarmers the most prosperous in theworld Farmers VoiceWEIGHING DEVICESo Easily Made That Each

ThanAnything ElseOverfeeding is mostly done with softfood It is placed in a trough and thefowls are allowed to help themselvesthe consequences being that some getmore than their share while others getmuch less the fortunate ones becomingfat and lazy and all of them reachingthe same condition later Soft foodshould not be considered as a meal butonly a part thereof hence the fowlsshould never be given more than onehalf the quantity the would eat It isnecessary at times to vary the rationby the use of soft food as bran middlings linseed meal and ground meatiran best be given in such form but allclasses of will eat as much aspossible at a meal when there are anumber of fowls together as they areinduced to do so through competitionDucks and turkeys prefer soft food butchickens are more partial to whole 1grains and other seeds which can bescattered over a wide surface in whichcase all hens will share alike To learnnow niuen soit loocr to give put acertain amount of food in a trough

illnessstated as followsTwo years ago I had mv first experienceWith Dr Williams Piiik Pills For a longtime I was troubled with an ailment which1 feared would eventually drive me crazyunless I rid myself of it It will soundstrange no doubt to some but my heartdid not beat as it should Its action was irregular There would be two pulsations orperhaps three and then a sudden cessationMy heart seemed to rest for the period ofone or two beats and thenresumeits actionSometimes such lapses would not be so frequent as that but scarcely a day passed thatthey did not occur It felt as though something would strike the heart with greatforce and push it out of place During theperiod whenever I lay down to sleep orrest my hands would become perfectlynumb and helpless I could feel the temporary paralysis coming oyer them but Icould do nothing which would prevent itMy feet were affected in a like manner and1 had considerable difficulty in walkingwhen such a spell had possession of meNaturally that state of affairs completelyupset my nerves and anyone whose nervous system is well nigh shattered can appreciate and understand the misery chieflymental which I endured I lost much sleepand rest and often I was compelled fromsheer exhaustion to sit down during the dayto obtain some repose But as soon as I didso I felt that numb sensation come over myhands and feet and I rocked violently in mychair to drive it away but frequently to noavailOne day my son who was keeping a drugstore at the time brought me home some ofDr Williams Pink Pills for PalePeopie andadvised me to take
