Will Sne for Pence Before Porto Rico is Captured The Dilemma Then Would Be Howto Secure That IslandWashington June 1 Gen Lee hasleft Tampa for Jacksonville on theeast side of the Florida peninsula t9open headquarters there But one inference can be drawn from this movement namely that Jacksonville is tobe made a base of operations againstPorto Eico The town is admirablysituated for this purpose in fact it farsurpasses Key West as a base for operations even against any of the easternpoints of Cuba The terminus of anexcellent railroad system leading- fromthe north and west with good steamboat connection with New York witha navigable river affording a good harbor and distant only 1200 miles fromSan Juan in an air line to Jacksonville leaves little to be desired as abase of military operations Thereseems to be little doubt that the planof campaign contemplates the reduction of Porto Ilico and thepresident is being strongly urgedto begin this movement even beforeany serious attempt is made upon Havana His advisers point to what theyregard as the danger of a retreat onthe part of the Spanish governmentIt might be possible according to theirview for the Spanish to assert thatthey accept in full the demands of thisgovernments ultimatum and are prepared to withdraw their troops fromCuba In such case the UnitedStates would be placed in the disagreeable position before the worldof continuing to make war upon thecountry which holds out the flag oftruce The dilemma that would confront us in such case would be how tosecure Porto Rico without offendingagainst international law for it canbe safely accepted as the truth that theadministrationlis determined that Spanish rule in the western hemisphere mustcease Now that Gen Miles has goneit can be stated that for the last fivedays he has held frequent conferenceswith a prominent Porto Rican thoroughly conversant with the situationin that island and able to give exactinformation as to the Spanish strengthdefenses etc thereWhen the cabinet meeting adjournedTuesday it was announced that thematters under discussion were not ofvital importance nor was there anything of interest that could be

woodPART TVTHE STOCKADETHEWASABANDONEDIt was about half past one threebells in the sea phrase that the twoboats went ashore from the Hispaniola The captain the squire and Iwere talking matters ever in the cabinHad there been a breath of wind Aveshould have fallen on the six mutineerswho were left aboard with us slippedour cable and away to sea- But thewind was wanting and to completeour helplessness down came Hunterwith the news that Jim Hawkins hadslipped into a boat and was goneashore with the restIt had never occurred to us to doubtJim Hawkins but we were alarmedfor his safety With the men in thetemper thcr were in it seemed an evenchance if we should see the lad againWeranondeck Thepitchwas bubblingin the seams the nasty stench of theplace turned me sick if ever a mansmelled fever and dysentery it was inthat abominable anchorage The sixscoundrels were sitting grumblingunder a sail in the forecastle ashorewe could see the gigs made fast and aman sitting in each hard by where theriver runs in One of them was whistling LillibulleroWaiting was a strain and it was decided that Hunter and 1 should goashore with the jolly boat in quest ofinformationThe gigs had leaned to their rightbut Hunter and I pulled straight in inthe direction of the stockade upon thechart The two who were left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle atour appearance Lillibullero stoppedoff and I could sec the pair discussing jwhat they ought to bo Had they goneand told Silver all might have turnedout differently but they had theirorders I suppose and decided to sitquietly where they were and harkback again to LillibulleroThere was a slight bend in the coastand I steered so as to put it betweenus even before we landed we had thuslost sight of the gigs 1 jumped outand came as near running as I durstwith a big silk handkerchief under myhat for coolness sake and a brace ofpistols ready primed for safetyI had not gone 100 yards when I cameon the stockadeThis was how it was A spring ofclear water rose almost at the top of aknoll Well on the knoll and inclosingthe spring they had clapped a stoutlog house fit to hold two score peopleon a pinch and loop holed for musketry on every side All round thisthey had cleared a wide space and thenthe thing was completed by a palingsix feet high without door or opening too strong to pull down withouttime and labor and too open to shelterthe besiegers The people in the loghouse had them in every way theystood quiet in shelter and shot theothers like partridges All they wanted was a good watch and food forshort of a complete surprise theymight have held the place against aregimentWhat particularly took my fancy wasthe spring For though we had a goodenough place of it in the cabin of theHispaniola with plenty of arms andammunition and things to eat and excellent wines there had been one thingoverlooked we had no water 1 wasthinking this over when there cameringing over the island the cry of aman at the point of death I was notnew to violent death I have sei vedhis royal highness the duke of Cumberland and got a wound myself atFontenoy but I know my pulse wentdot and carry one Jim Hawkins isgone was my first thoughtIt is something to have been an oldsoldier but more still to have been adoctor There is no time to dilly dallyin our work And so now 1 made up mymind instantly and with no time lostreturned to the shore and jumped onboard the jolly boatBy good fortune Hunter jpulled agood oar We made the water fly andthe boat was soon alongside and 1aboard the schoonerI found them all shaken as was natural The squire was sitting down aswhite as a sheet thinking of the harmhe had led us to the good soul and oneof the six forecastle hands was littlebetterTheres a man said Capt Smollettnodding toward him new to thiswork He came nigh hand faintingdoctor when he heard the cry Another touch of the rudder and that manwould join usI told my plan to the captain and between us we settled on the details of itsaccomplishmentWe put old Redruth in the gallerybetwreen the cabin and ip forecastlewith three or tf ouiy loada niartress ftorbroughtmewopVoectlf Hunlthe boat roundunder the istern port and Joyce and set to workloading her with powder tins musketsbags of biscuits kegs of pork a caskof cognac and my invaluable medicinechestIn the meantime the squire and thecaptain stayed on deck and the latterhailed the cockswain who was theprincipal man on boardMr Hands he said here are twoof us with a brace of pistols each Ifany one of you six make a -signal of anydescription that mans deadThey were a good deal taken abackand after a little consultation one andall tumbled down the fore companionthinking no doubt to take us on therear But when they saw Redruthwaiting for them in the sparred gallery they went about ship at once anda head popped out on deckDown dog cries the captainAnd the head popped back again audwe heard no more for the time of thesesix very faint hearted seamenBy this time tumbling things in asthey came we had the jolly boat loadedas much as we dared Joyce and Igot out through the stern port and wemade for shore again as fast as ouroars could take usThis second trip fairly aroused thewatchers along the shore Lillibullero was dropped again and just before we lost sight of them behind tholittle point one of them whippedashore and disappeared I had half amind to change my plans and destroytheir boats but I feared that Silverand the others might be close at handand all might very well be lost by trying for too muchWe had soon touched land in thesome place before we set the provision in the block house All three madethe first journey heavily laden andtossed our stores over the palisadej Then leaving Joyce to guard themone man to be sure but with half adozen muskets Hunter and I returnedto the jolly boat and loaded ourselvesonce more So we proceeded withoutpausing to take breath till the wholecargo was bestowed when the two servants took up their position in theblock house and I with all my powersculled back to the HispaniolaThat we should have risked a secondbeat load seems more daring than itreally was They fiad the advantageof numbers of course but we had theadvantage of arms Not one of the menashore had a musket and before theycould get within range for pistol-shootingwe flattered ourselves we could beable to give a good account of a halfdozen at leastThe squhe was waiting for me atthe stern window all his faintness gonefrom him He caught the painter andmade it fast and we fell to loading theboat for our very lives Pork powderand biscuit was the cargo with pnly amusket and cutlass apiece for squireand me and Redruth and the captainThe rest of the arms and powder -weredropped overboard in two fathoms anda half of water so that we could see1 1VV4armtyMffthe bright steel sHintog far below usin the sun on the clear sandy bottomBy this time the tide was beginningto ebb and the ship was swingingaround to her anchor Voices wereheard hallooing in the direction of thetwo gigs and though this reassured usfor Joyce and Hunter who were well tothe eastward it warned our party tobe offRedruth retreated from his place inthe gallery and dropped into the boatwhich we had brought round to theships counter to be handier for CaptSmollettNow men said he do you hear9There Avas no answer from the forecastleIts to you Abraham Gray its toyou I am speakingStill no replyGray resumed Mr Smollett a littlelouder I am leaving this ship and Iorder you to follow your captain Iknow you are a good man at bottomand I dare say not one of the lot ofyous as bad as he makes out I havemy watch here in my hand I give you30 seconds to join me inThere was a pauseCome my fine fellow continuedthe captain dont hang so long instaj s Im risking my life and thelives of these good gentlemen everysecondThere was a sudden scuffle a soundof blows and out burst Abraham Grajwith aknife cut on the side of thecheekand came running to the captain like adog to the whistleIm with you sir said heAnd the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us and wehad shoved off and given wayWe were clear out of the ship butnot yet ashore

In herday she was a battle ship but she hasnot a turret nor a sponson and wouldbe little more than sport for a modernironclad In addition to being antiquated most of these vessels are broken down in engines and boilers Intheir reckless disregard of the simplest precautions for the preservationof the complex machinery of a warship the Spaniards are excelled by ncpeople and it is well known that theyhave been obliged to hire British engineers to run their engines wheneverthey did run There are some vesselsalthough a very few at Cadiz of mod-ern type but they are not numerousnor powerful

oldgentleman in distress Then he bringsyou up as his own son but if you preferred to go on being- your fathers sonI expect the old gentleman would makeit up to you in some other way nbooks the least thing does it You put-up the railway carriage window or youpick up his imrse when he drops it oryou say a hymn when he suddenly asksyou to and then your foitune is madeThe others did not seem to care muchabout the rescue They said therewasnt any deadly peril and we shouldliave to make one before we could rescue the old gentleman from it but Oswald didnt see that it mattered How-ir lieithbufflit he would trv some ofFtmyeasterKvays first by himself Sohe waited about the station and pulledup railway carriage windows for oldgentlemen who looked likelj but nothing happened and at last the porterssaid he was a nuisance So that was noTO jNo one had ever asked him in wvhymn though he had learnt a niceshort one beginning New everymorning and when an old gentlemandid drop a two shilling piece just byEllis the hair dressers and Oswaldpicked it up and was just thinking whathe should say when he returned it theold gentleman caught him by the collar and called him a young- thief Itwould have been very unpleasant forOswald if he hadnt happeued to be avery brave boy and known the policeman on that beat very well indeed Sothe policeman backed him up and theold gentleman said he was sorry andotfered Oswald sixpence Oswald refused it with polite disdain and nothingmore happened at allWhen Oswald had tried by himselfand it had not come off he said to theothers Were wasting our time nottrying to rescue the old gentleman indeadly peril Lets do somethingIt was dinner time and Pincher wasgoing round getting the bits off theplates There were plenty because itwas cold mutton day And Alice saidIts only fair to try Oswalds wayhe has tried all the things the othershave thought of Why couldnt we rescue Lord TottenhamLord Tottenham is the old gentleman who walks over the heath everyday at three oclock and when he getshalf way if there is no one about hechanges his collar and throws the dirtyone into the furze bushesDickie said Lord Tottenhams allright but wberes life deadly perilAnd we couldnt think of any Thereare no highwaymen on Blackheath nowI am sorry to say though Oswald saidhalf of us could be highwaymen and theother half the rescue party Dora saidit would be wrong to be a highwaymanand so we had to give that upTJhen Alice said What aboutPincherAnd wcall saw at once that it couldbe done Pincher is our fox terrier Heis very weli bred and he does IcnoNv oneor two things though we never couldleach him to beg But if you tell himto hold on he will do it even if youonly say Seize him in a whisperSo we arranged it all Dora said shewouldnt play she said she thought itwas wrong and she kuew it was sillyso we left her out and she went andsat in the dining room so as to be ableto say she didnt have anything to dowith it if we got into troubleAlice and II 0 were to hide in thefurze bushes where Lord Tottenhamchanges his collar and they were tosay Seize liim to Pincher and thenwhen Pincher had seized Lord Tottenham we were to go and rescue himfrom his deadly peril And he wouldsay How can I reward yon my nobleyoro pretrvers and it would be allISSWEWSo we went tip to the heath We wereafraid of being late Oswald told theothers what pracrastination -was sothey got to tho furze bushes a little after two oclock and it was rather coldAlice and H 0 and Pincher hid butPincher did not like it any more thanthey did and as we three walked np anddown we heard him whining AndAlice kept saying I am so cold Isnthe coming yet And HO wanted tocome out and jump about to warm himself But we told him he must learn tobe a Spartan boy and that he ought tobe very thankful that he hadnt got abeastly fox eating his inside all thetime HO is our little brother and weare not going to let it be our fault ifhe grows up a milksop Because it wasnot really cold So they stayed wherethey were And at last when even weother three were beginning to feelrather chilly we saw Lord Tottenhamsbig black cloak coming along flappingin the wind like a great bird So we saidto AliceHist he approaches Youll knowwhen to set Pincher on by hearing LordTottenham talking to himself he always does while he is taking off his collarThen we had walked away whistlingto show we Ave re not thinking of anything Our lips Avere rather cold butwe managed to do itLord Tottenham came striding alongtalking as usual People call him themad protectionist I dont know Avhatit means but I dont think people oughtto call a lord such namesAs he passed us he said Ivtiin of thecountry sir Fatal error fatal errorand then Ave looked back and saAA heAvas getting quite near Avhere PincherAvas aud Alice and H O We Avalked onso that he shouldnt think Ave Avere looking and in a minute Ave heard Pincherbark and then nothing for a bit andthen Ave looked around and sureenough good old Pincher had jrot LordTottenham by the trouser leg and Avasholding on so Ave started to runLord Tottenham had srot his collar offit Avas sticking out sideways underhis ears and he Avas shouting Helphelp murder exactly as if someonehad explained to him beforehand whathe was to do Pincher Avas growlingand snarling and holding on When Avegot up to him T saidDickie Ave must rescue this goodold manLord Tottenham roared in his furyGood old man beCall the dog offSo Dicky said It is a dangeroustask but Avho Avould hesitate to do anact of true braveryAnd all the time Pincher Avas worrving and snarling and Lord Tottenhamshouting to us to get rue dog aAvayAnd he Avas dancing about in the roadwith Pincher hanging on like grimdeath and his collar flapping aboutAvhere it Avas undoneThen Xoel said Haste ere yet it betoo late so I said to Lord TottenhamStand still aged sir and I will endeavor to alleviate your distressHe stood still and I stooped down andcaught hold of Pincher and AvhisperedDrop it sir drop itSo then Pincher dropped it and LordTottenham fastened his collar againhe never does change it if theres anyone looking and lie saidIm much obliged Im sure Xastyvicious brute Heres something todrink my healthBut Oswald explained that Ave are teetotalers and do not drink peopleshealth So Lord Tottenham saidWell Im much obliged anyway Andnow J come to think of it of courseyoure not young ruffians but gentlemens sons eh Still you -wont beabove taking a tip from an old boy Iwasnt when i Avas your age and hepulled out a half sovereignIt was very silly but now Ave haddone it 1 felt it Avould be meanto take the old boys cink after putting him in such a funk He didnt sayanything about bringing us up as hisown sons so I didnt know Avhat to doI let Pincher go and Avas just going tosay he was very Aveloome and Avedrather not have the money whichseemed the best way out of it Avhenthat beastly dog spoilt the Avhole sIioavDirectly I let go he began to jump upat us and bark for joy and try to lickour faces He Avas so proud of Avhathed doneLord Tottenham opened his eyes andhe just saidThe dog seems to know youAnd then Oswald saw it Avas all upand he said good morning and triedto get awayBut Lord Tottenham said Xot sofast and he caught Noel by the collarXoel gave a hcv1 aud Alice ran outfrom the bushes Xoel is her favo riteIm sure I dont know why Lord Tottenham looked at her and he said Sothere are more of you And then H 0came outDo you complete the party LordTottenham asked him and H 0 saidthere Averent any more of usLord Tottenham turned sharp off andbegan to -walk aAay holding Xoel bytheollar We caught up Avith him andasked him Avhere he Avas going and hesaid To the police stationSo then I said Well dont takeXoel hes not strong and he easilygets upaet Besides it wasnt his

separating all sick fowlsand confining them to some outbuildingkeeping the children away Doctoringsick fowls is very unprofitable businessand there is seldom any reason whythe fowls should be sick provided youhave done your part Your part is tokeep the roost clean and free fromlice Give clean water daily Fill upall low places where water is apt tocollect and clear away all rubbishburning it is the proper thing Furnish good sharp grit for the fowls anddont get the poultry so fat that the organs will be so clogged that they cannot perform iheir normal dutiesMake the roost tight and dry and provide convenient dusting places Makethe fowls exercise by scratching in2itter In fact this last point and cleanJresh water will go a long way towardkeeping the fowls in good healthThere is no kind of stock on the farmthat is more healthy than fowls whenthey have proper care Too many people try to crowd 100 fowls in too smalla house This not only lessens thenumber of eggs but is apt to breed disease as well The fowls in the center ofa crowded perch will get too warmind therefore colds will follow Ahouse 20 by 30 feet is not a bit too largefor 100 fowls The proper way is todivide the fowls up into smaller flocksof say 12 to 20 fowls each and separatethem during the cold weather at leastAgricultural EpitomistAMONG THE POULTRYThe pullet is so called until she is ayear oldNever feed sulphur to fowls in dampor rainy weatherBone meal can usually be fed to growing chickens to advantageBe sure and provide plenty of shadefor fowis during the summerIn quantity of eggs pullets will excelbut not in quality for hatchingThe loss of feathers often proceedsfjom unclean dusting arrangementsWhen a chicken picks itself frequently it is a good indication that it is lousjWith guineas to insure fertile eggsit will be best to keep them in pairsA good dust bath will help materiallyin keeping the fowls in a good conditionIt is a good plan to dip the eggs intepid water the day before they

Lay OnFlesh Very RapidlyIf the Best growth of the hogs Is secured during the summer it is essential to maintain good health and keepthe hogs as comfortable as possiblePlenty of good clover or grass with agood variety of ground grain or middlings made into slop with milk is animportant item in maintaining thriftBut in addition there must be goodshelter under which the hogs can liewhen their appetite is satisfied protected from the hot sun and from rainsIf the best health is maintained it isessential that the bedding for the hogsbe dry and this cannot be assured evenin summer unless a dry shelter is providedThe shelter in summer should ofcourse be well ventilated When onpasture rather more than when on dryfeed hogs require plenty of salt andone of the best ways of supply is tokeep abox under shelter in a convenientplace filled with salt and ashes threeparts ashes wood ashes are best andone part of salt A little copperasadded will make it still better Replenish as often as may be necessaryThere is no danger In this way of anyof them eating too nruch salt andashes and this plan will give betterresults than to give it at stated intervalsAnother item in maintaining goodhealth is to supply plenty of fresh water Xo matter how much milk or goodslop is given nothing will do so well insatisfying thirst as pure fresh waterand the hogs should have all that theywill drink every day If they do nothave access to a running stream freshwater should be given in the troughsVery little bedding is necessary butit should be changed occasionallyWith clover and a slop made ofmiddlings and milk it is an exceptionalcase when they will get too fat to thrivewell as middlings and clover furnishmore of the elements that make muscleand bone than fat But with corn andclover if the hogs are given all thatthey will eat every day they may keeptoo fat to thrive as they should As forgrowing pigs especially during thesummer there is no advantage in keeping them very fat Better health andgrowth can be maintained if they arekept in a thrifty condition If they arekept healthy and thrifty they will nearly always prove profitable St LouisRepublicCLEAN FARM BOILERAn Excellent Plan for Covering theKettle When It In ConstructedOut of DoorsPortable farm boilers for cookingvegetables for hogs and other animalsare now made in many styles but onmany farms the question of expensewill lead to the using still of the oldfashioned set kettle It is a commonpractice to set such a kettle in brickand leave it exposed to the weatherThe kettle is thus constantly beingfilled with rain and the top bricksM fwt r I l T iSaCVWJ VS839R1EafKsrrArrVTCir Vassssyyit Tb r iA jKJsgrjSfcSgTCOVERED KETTLEloosened The accompanying cut showsan excellent plan for covering the kettle when it is constructed out of doorsThis keeps everything snug and dryand presents a much better appearancethan does the kettle that is exposed tothe weather Such a kettle can be located convenient to the various farmbuildings to economize labor in feeding out the cooked food Whatever maybe the relative chemical value of cookedand uncooked food for farm animals itis safe to say that the digestibility ofvegetables is greatly aided by cookingwhich is a most important point in thecase of feeding young animals X YTribuneDemand for Merino ItnmnAmong the most conspicuous features of the present brisk trade in purebred sheep is the demand for Merinorams The advance in the price of wool2ias greatly stimulated the inquiries forrams of the fine wool varieties andbreeders report their stocks pretty wellcleaned up It would be well if thosewho resort to this cross would have regard somewhat unto the bodily excellence of the rams they buy If it costas much to raise a pound of wool inthe central west as some authoritieshave repeatedly stated there is surelyvery little encouragement yet to embark in the wool growing industrywithout regard to muton productionBreeders Gazetteltulky Food in SummerThere is no necessity for giving cutclover to fowls if they have the run ofa grass plot II confined in yards atgrass of any kind may be given once aday or a sod of grass may be placed inthe yard for the hens to pick Bulkyfood
