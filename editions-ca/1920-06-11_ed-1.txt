My stomachwas so upset that always aftermeals I became almost dearthlv sickand was often unable to retain anything I had eaten. I was continually bothered with nervous, sicl:headaches and my condition was fasttendering me unfit for the duties ofmy position, as I have to be out mall sorts of weather and under allkinds- of conditions. I have bee-nmoie or less nffected with rheumatism m my joints, too, at times,and to sum it ail up in a fewwords, my condition was jost thatmiserable, haltsick, no-accpunt feeling that robs life of nearly all itspleasure1 and makes work a burden."About a month ago a friend ofmine, knowing about my deplorablecondition, told me of the splendidresults he had gotten from Tanlacfor similar troubles. He was sostrong in his praise of it I bought abottle and it has put me right onmy feet again. I am no longer,bothered with sick stomach orheadaches and very seldom sufferfrom any pam in my joints. Mynerves have improved wonderfully,my sleep is sound and restful, an Jon getting on the scales the otherday I was astonished to find -that Ihad actually gained eight pounds. Iam still taking Tanlac and fromnow on I expect to keep a bottle onhand, for I see it is one medicinerhat can be depended upon for results." Tanlac is sold in Paris at thePeoples' Pharmacy!"
