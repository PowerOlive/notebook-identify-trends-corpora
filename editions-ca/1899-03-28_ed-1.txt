Lampkin has already sent forthe necessary medicines We were justgetting ready to startHave you yourself any hope thatMr Gielow may be found alive askedthe young lady as she roseHendricks looked downIt may sound paradoxical he saidbut I base my hopes in regard to hisfate on his statement made perhapstwo days ago that he was starvingOh dont say that cried MissHuntingtonYou see went on Hendricks as theyall moved towards the door BantinniCHAPTEB XXAs the carriage was ascending thegradual incline of the rugged roadthrough the woods surrounding the oldmansion the four occupants agreedthat to prevent any suspicion of theirintentions entering the mind of Kolathe sergeant and Mi- Huntingtonwere to remain inside the carriage withthe blinds down while Hendricks andDr Lampkin went in And just beforegetting out when the door was reachedHendricks said to the sergeantKeep a good look out and if heshould escape us and make a break fort lie front stop himAl right agreed the officer and hesmiled apologetically at Miss Huntington as he took out a big revolver andlaid it on the seat between themLampkin and Hendrieks had their revolvers cocked ready for use in thepockets of their overcoats It hadbeen agreed that thev were to takeKola by surprise get him well underfire and then calmly demand the restoration of the prisonerGoing up the steps Hendricks andLampkin found the big front door openand as no one came to answer theirring they were hesitating as to whatcourse to pursue when Kola thrust hiscowled head through the curtains andcalled out cheerilyOh hello Come right in gentlemenWhen they went into the room inwhich Kola had entertained them thenight before they found the windowsdarkened and the same dim lightsburning overheadI Lave just got up said the Indianwith a smile That performance lastnight took all the strength out of meI hope Ill never have to go throughthat sort of thing again to convinceanyone of niy ability in that lineYou wont have to my boy repliedthe detective But I want to have atalk with youI know I know sit down andKola waved his hand at the lounge onwhich be had reclined the precedingnight but it had been moved againstthe wall He sat down in a chair at atabic Hendricks and Lampkin bothobeyed The former thrust his handinto the pocket of his overcoat andgrasped the butt of his revolverKohi be began I have reasons forthinking Gielow is alive andHold on the Indian broke in witha laugh Listen to me HendrieksWhat if I should tell vou that vou areabsolutely in my powerfriend that simply byyou and yourpressing theelectric button under my hand 1 couldhurl you both into eternityA startled look flashed into the faceof the detective He looked above himand then down at his feetI should believe you he said MyGod doctor he has trapped usDont move a muscle or raise aif vou want time to sav vourprayers chuckled Kola for as sureas vou sit there vou will be dead ina minute The rug under your feetcovers some thin boards over a cavern200 feet deep With all your shrewdness you have never suspected me butyou do suspect Count Bantinni and itcoes not suit me to have you pryingfurther into his affairstwice to get you out of my way andI do not intend to fail this time Xowget ready I assure you it is a genuinedelight to see that expression on yourface Id get you a mirror Hendricksbut to do so Id have to take my handoff the buttonI can ask only one thing saidHendricks calmly and a perspirationbroke out over his faceWhat is that asked Kola with asmileMy friend here is not responsible forwhat I have done and 1 hopeOh there is not a ghost of a chancefor him broke in the Indian Youcan see that HendricksLampkin was speechless with surprise He had been slow to grasp theawful seriousness of their predicamentbut when he did it completely unnerved himKola glanced past them at a littleclock on the wallTil give you just a minute he saidIts as much time as I can afford toallow My Indian pal has becomeshaky and threatened to desert me ifI sprung the trap on you I must pacifyhim and show him how safe we areI could explain to your driver out therethat an accident had happened and noone would think of blaming meThen although their eyes were gluedto Kolas sinister face they observed the silk curtains behind the Indian stir as from a breeze then the curtains parted cautiously and SergtDenham peered in They saw fromthe wondering gaze of his wide openeyes that he was mystified by their unexpected silence their white faces andthe half crouching attitude of the Indian as he leaned over the table hissun nnsrers on the button Lake aplaced him in confinement for a flash a plan of action came to Hendrickspose If he had not desired that Gielow should be kept alive for awhile hewould have put him out of the way atonce It looks as if the count intendedto let him live for awhile and has forgotten to give him attentionMiss Huntington laid her hand onHendricks armI am going to ask a great favor shesaid tremulously I want to go withyou If he is dead I should like to bethere at -once you know and if he isj live I could helpHendricks face fell He iriauceddubiously at the sergeant and DrLampkin then his face slowly clearedupI really dont see why un couldntgo he said I have ordered a closedcarriage to meet us at the elevated station -You could remain in the carriage till we went in and made the arrest and then you certainly would comein handyOh you are so good she exclaimedPlease do not lose any timeand its subtility was worthy of his greatintellect The words he called out thenext instant he hoped would stay thedeath touch of the murderer and furnish a ke to their predicament to DenhamHold one second he cried Iknow something you ought to knowKola We are completely in vour now-electric button wc shall be hurled intothe pit below but you must listenKolas enjoyment seemed intenseI dont want to bear anything fromyou he laughed Get readyHendrieks drew a deep breath Themost startling feature of the situationwas that Denham did not seem to comprehend their peril He half smiled asif he thought Hendrieks were playingone of his practical jokes on his manbefore arresting himTimes up announced the IndianDenham jerk him backward yelledHendricks and in the sudden shock ofastonishment over the puzzling command the Indian involuntarily raisedhis tinge- from the bu ton and the situation seemed to flash upon DenhamLike a projectile hurled from somepowerful destroying machine he sprangat Kola He caught him by the throatand pulled him over the back of hischair Hendricks sprang from therug dragging the almost inactive doctor with him Kola wriggled in Denhams clutch and managed to get onhis feet But with his lingers digginginto the Indians throat the sergeantbore him backwards over the table Inthe struggle Kolas shoulder presseddown on the electric button Therewas a crash of timbers under the loungejust vacated and with a dull subterranean rumble the flooring over thatspot disappeared in a yawning blackholeHendrieks was beside himself withrage as he towered over the now passive IndianOh you dirty scamp he ejaculatedHe took a pair of handcuffs from hisYOU WILL BE DEAD IN A MINUTElocketand fastened them on KolawristsThe Indians face was the color ofashesDowned me after all he said resignedlyYou dirty puppy was all that Hendricks seemed able to sav but in amoment he was perfectly calmKola he said firmly we wantGielowThe Indian sat down in his chairHe had grown calmer and now a sortof dogged smile played over his faceOh you do lie said almost with asneerAnd we are going to have him added HendricksXever said Kola It doerfnt suitme to give him to you I know I amgood for the electric chair anyway sowhy should I tell you where he isThere is not another man alive thatknows the secret entrance to his cellYou would have to blast away thiswhole hill of stone to get at him andthen youd not find him alive Thelast time I saw him two days ago hewas dying of starvation Huh GieiOws suffering and death is all the satisfaction I shall have out of the business You will find enough of my electrical appliances down below to amuseyou but the secret vaults can be entered by no one besides myself Ilearned the secret from the soleI have tried vivor of the old gang of counterfeitersand leased the place for that reasonHendricks proposed to Lampkin togo with him downstairsGet your gun ready he said Hehas a dark skinnedassistant somewhereabout hereI think he has skipped said Denham I saw a fellow in foreign clothesrun out of the side door I was afraid itwas your man giving you the slip so Icame in to see about it and happened toget here in timeOh hes gone said Kola grimlyHe is a coward He knew what 1 wasgoing to do in regard to the dead falland was too chicken hearted to face itKola said Hendricks it can do vouno possible good to keep back informa1tion in regard to uieiow s whereaboutsYou will never know that from meanswered the IndianHendricks face fell He signaled DrLampkin to follow and led the waydownstairsIn the basement they found nothingof note except a trunk bearing the initials of Weldon CaruthersThats what he brought the body insaid HendricksIn the big cellars below they founddirectly under the trap Kola had arranged the yawning opening of a deeppitAn awful hole said Hendricks ashe turned away He pointed to somelarge steel vessels and two large copper cylinders such as are used for making lime light in the theatersThats where he cremated the bodysection by section he said Hethought as most murderers do thathis secret was well guardedThey searched through all the roomsof the cellar and then HendricksstoppedWe are losing time he grunted indisappointment I believe Kola toldthe truth about his being the only onewho knows the secret of Gielows hiding-placeI am also sure that Gielowh somewhere under ground We haveseen one cavern and it is not unlikehthat there are others It has long beenbelieved that they are under this haller I know that when you press that Cant you think of some plan to wringthe truth from that impThey had paused before the door ofa little room where a dim light shoneover the transom Lampkin tried thelatch and finding the door unlockedhe pushed it open The room hadshelves on all three of its walls and theseshelves were well filled with all sorts ofbo tiesHis laboratory said LampkinXo I cannot tell 3 ou w hat to do Ah 1have an ideaThe doctor took down a bottle andread the label and then uncorked it andapplied it to his noseEther be said This bottle reminds me of an

about exactlywhat he desires mot to keep backBring it upstairs for the love ofmercy cried the detective It cant doany harmAs they entered the recept ion roomKolas questioning glance became fixedon the

darted into a lxithroomnear by and returned with the requiredarticleNow lay his lordship on the floorthe doctor saidKola wriggled like an eel but withHendricks at his head and SergtDenhams determined hauds a his feetthey soon had him laid out Dr Lampkin folded the towel into the shape of afunnel and saturated it with the fluidfrom the bottle Then he started to putit over Kolas mouth and noseHold on give him one more chanceordered Hendricks Where is GielowKolaThe only answer the Indian made wasI to close his lips tightlythe devil is trying to hold hisbreath cried Lampkin HI showhim a trick that will beat that I canmake him take itAnd holding the towel over Kolasnose with his left hand he began topunch him violently in the chest Thisproceeding made the Indian gasp forbreath and forced

onewithout having been read He knew itbecause he had pasted two of the leavestogether Very likely We do not thinkof reading through a half or a quarterof the articles that are sent to us Itoften does not take half a minute to discard what one knows he doesnt wantIt is an old saying that one does notneed to eat a whole joint to learnwhether it is taintedIt would be a revelation to some ofthese writers to see how fast an experienced and conscientious editor can attimes go through a big pile of essaysstories or poems The title is oftenenough and he would say We dontwant an article on that subject Thenext article begins with a page or twoof commonplace introduction and thatis thrown aside in half a minutes inspection without turning more thanthe next page The next begins with aplatitude We cant print that stuffThe first verse of this next poem hasfalse meter and is tossed aside Thenext begins in schoolgirl style withdove and love it is not readthrough Of the next the editor readsten lines It is simply a dull description of a stream in a forest not wanted The next poem begins in a freshway seems to be constructed accordingto the rules is pretty good It is putone side to see if omer better poemswill crowd it out The next is a storyThe first page is promising but the Second shows a coarse strain and the reading stops theremany tropical countries and whatthrows the greatest obstacle in the wayof civilization of and good governmentin vast regions of central Africa is notclimate not distance from home andnot unfriendliness on the part of thenatives The obstacle is malaria

cats come back from Edenwas the way Lew put it Eden wasthe second place of residence of thisparticular cat and hes on this sideof tbe Monticello road nowSo I telephoned to Miles Sturtevantto come down from Hartwood the nextmorning to meet me I met his wagonon tbe road four miles from town Webumped our way over the turnpike tothe top of Sullivan county and thenturned into the old Texas road pickingop Lew Boyd and his hound on theway Three miles further on the irayroad strikes out to the east at rightingles Here we dismissed the wagonchained the hound and walked on inthe direction of Gray swamp At thehead of ray swamp we found thetracks of a big cat pointing toward theswamp and a few yards further on wecame upon a similar track crossingthe road in the opposite direction Lewaverted confidently that the twoIrsuks w re made that day and by theuae animal and the question re-J maned to be decided on whicd side cfthe road he was at that moment Hewas of the opinion that the cat was inLong swamp So we trudged tit roughthe woods for three miles along the topof a low ridgeWe passed innumerable deer trackson the way Asweneared Long swampwe put up a fine deer that went dashing off toward Port Jervis and a littlelater another jumped through thebrush close by Long swamp of theshape of an enormous two fingeredhand covering hundreds of acres After we gained the swamp the sun wentundrfer the clouds and even the instinctof direction possessed by Lew Boydtrained woodsman as he was was atfault We made our way by the aidof my pocket compasaOn the west edge of the swamp wecame suddenly upon a place wherethe ground was torn and trampledTufts of hair and pieces of pelt layabout on the blood stained snow andthere was every sign of a terrific struggle On the edge of the battlegroundlay the paunch of a deer and a fewfeet further on we found its head andspine gnawed clean The work hadbeen done two nights before and fromall sign this had been no running battle of miles The tragedy had all beenenacted within a few feet and we bothfelt a new respect for the animal Icould do wa with a nearlygrown deer Lew cut through to skirtthe east end of the Kwamp in qu st ofa fresh

A WEEKThe Hate at Which the II u m m illirds of South Auieriea AreBetas KilledDr Bobert Bidgway ornithologist olthe Smithsonian institution saysDealers have stablished themselvesiti many cities of South America for thesole object of buying and exportinghumming birdsThe Indians readilvlearn the art of skinning and preserving and because of the large profits olthe industry they often traverse greatdistances to procure the birds Residents of many parts of Brazil employtheir servants in collecting and preparing them for European markets andimmense numbers are shipped fromBio de Jantiro Bahia and PernambueoInmates of the convents are suppliedwith some of the most richly coloredspecies for the manufacture of featheiflowers Myriads of hummers are a I soused by the natives of Mexico in making the wonderful feather pictures foiwhich the descendants of the Aztecsare famous plumes of different colorsbeing employed in place of pigmentsBy far the most effective weaponfor the destruction of humuii ng birdsis the reed blow pipe which the SouthAmerican Indian- use with perfect certainty of aim In Brazil very tine netare utilized to capture the bird- andsometimes they are taken by means ofbird lime though that is apt to damagethe plumage Owing to the recklessslaughter of these little victims for ornamental purposes certain species arealready on the verge of extinctionThis doe- not seem surprising whenone learns that fejOOO skins of the ruby-and-topazhumming bird alone wereshipped not long ago from a Brazilianport in a single consignment while ata public sale of birdskins held
