OUTFITTERS T- - .- , . j, THE TOBACCO SITUATIONThe tobacco situation is causing ahardship on the merchants who haveconsiderable in accounts to collect,not so much by 'those who are absolutely unable to se'tle up becausetheir tobacco is not sold, but byhose who owe accounts, and areable to pay whether a pound of tobacco is sold -jr not. and who aretaking advantage of the situationand are refusing to settle theirsimall accounts.From our conversation with merchants who do a credit business weht.ve heard no objections to carrying the accounts of customers, orwaiting a while on those who areabsolutely honest, but dependent ontheir tobacco crops for the settlement of what they owe. A numberof merchants, however, say thatmany men with good bank accountsare putting off paying their bills bysaying they have not sold their tobacco, when, in fact, these samemen have always paid their bills regardless of whether their tobaccohas been sold or not.The merchants have to pay theirbUls when called on to do so orlose their credit racing, and theyare certainly entitled to a squaredeal in the latter. Be on the squarewith vhc merchant who has parriedyou, and if you can pay your billsdo so pron ptly, and help the merchant "carry the burden of theweak." He is willing to do hi3 part,now wralk up like a mand and doyours.

Don't leave itbecause hsrd blows are to be struckor disagree ble work performed.Those who have worked theirway up to wealth and usefulness donot Lelong to the shiftless and unstable class, but many be reckonedamong such as pulled off their coats,rolled up their sleeves, conqueredtheir prejudices against labor andmanfully bore the heat and burdenof the day.Whether upon the old farm,where our fathers toiled diligently,striving to bring the soil to productiveness; in the machine shop or factory, or the thousand other businessplaces that invite honest toil andskill let the motto ever be: Perseverance rnd industry.

Upon approaching the machine the officerfound a young man curled up onthe seat in a comfortable sleep.The man was awakened, and, afterbeing questioned, stated that he hadcome from Covington, where the carhadbeen hired by a Paris man, whohad accompanied him, and that hewas waiting for him to return toget his pay.- Patrolman Lusk called Chief ofPolice Link, and the two investigated the car. In the rear nf tlmachine they discovered ten gunnysacks, each containing a case ofbottled in bond whisky, in pints andquarts. The driver gave his name asCharles Tunny, and said the machine had been secured fiojin theFloyd & djaxton garage in Covington. H? was placed under arrost,the whisky removed to police headquarters, where it was put underguard, and the machine, a largetouring oar, was taken to the Bourbon Garage, wheie it is being heldunder the provisions of the prohibition act.Later cm John Cain, of Parifwas placed under arrest, Tunnyhaving given his name as the. onewho had h'"red him to bring the carto Pc.ris. Both Tuni.y and Cainwere piesented in the CountyCourt, Tuesday afternoon, befoieJudge George B;.tterton, chargedwith transporting liquor into localoption territory. The meni wereheld in $1,000 bond to appear inCourt Wednesday moining ChiefProbation Agent U G. McFarland,ot Lexington, who was called on thecae, declined it was not in Federaljurisdiction, butv would have to jbehandled under the State laws.When the case, was called Wednesday morning the question ofwhat the bottles contained was raised. Judge Batterton asked if anyone in the court room had la corkscrew, and thirteen hands went upin the air in response. One of thenumber produced the necessary article. One of the quart bottles wasopened by Judge Batterton, who, after inhaling the aipma from within,rendered an instant decision to theeffect that it was whisky and ordered the trial to proceed. Afteihearing the testimony of the arresting officer and the two principals,ss well as other witnesses JudgeBatterton held Cain over in $1,000bond to the grand iury at the Marchterm of tbe Bourb.'.n Circuit CourtTunny, waived examining trial, andwas also placed under ?1,000 bond,1o answer to the charge at theMarch term of Court.The seised liquor, which is un-!'der guard in the office of CircuitClerk um.

They are accustomed topaying their hired girls the equivalent normally of about $1 a monthand requiring them to be on dutyfrom early in the morning to late at.night, or even until 1 o'clock thefollowing morning.The servant girls of Spain usuallyare allowed a, half-day off eachmonth. ...The eight hour day pioposal hits1he householder hardest.

At a lecture given beforean assemblage of geographers andbiologists representing several societies, Dr. D. T. MacDougal, director ofthe Botanical research department ofthe Carnegie institution at Washington, described the results of a seriesof experiments extending over fourteen years and embracing 139 speciesof -plants, the experiments tending toshow that the wild plant is not always found in the environment mostsuited to it."A great many people think this,"said Dr. MacDougal, "but it has beenfound to be absolutely false."With stations established at fourdifferent altitudes, 8,000 feet, 5,200feet, 2,300 feet and at sea level, plantshave been transferred from one placeto another, and the results of the cultural experiments of fourteen yearshave now been compiled.Grow More Luxuriantly.In these experiments plants from themountain tops, some from a height ofclose to one and one-half miles abovesea level, were found to grow muchmore luxuriantly, producing moreleaves, flowers and fruits at sea levelthan they had in their native habitat.These plants were not cultivated, protected or fostered in any way in theirnew situations. Once placed, "theywere to all intents and purposes wildflowers and had to fight their own battles and take chances as before.One hundred and thirty-nine plantswere used in these experiments, embracing forms of such wide divergenceas grasses, wild lilies and oak and wal- Jnut trees, as well as cacti and otherunusual plants."While a plant may thrive .well inits new situation,"- said Dr. MacDougal, "It will sometimes display a behavior quite at variance with that bywhich it is ordinarily known. Thusthe common witchhazfjl, which isknown to bloom in the vicinity of NewYork when the frosts come, when taken to the equitable climate of the Pacific coast reverts to the normal orsummer-blooming habit. Other speciesshow flower forms, fruits and leavesnotably different from those previously displayed by them,"Aquatic plants of the cress familywere made to grow in soil on themountain tops, where the roots formedsmall radishes, like their relatives.The radish is a cress. In other words,these plants came back to the ancestral habit of forming a radish.Interest to Biologists."The manner In which plants travelabout the world or are distributed isa problem of great interest to biologists, and in this experimental workparticular attention was given to obtaining evidence on some of the problems of dissemination or movement ofplants across the face of tne country."It was found that rabbits and rodents which inhabit the oak zone atthe top of the mountain range actedvery effectively as a barrier to prevent cacti and other plants from moving up or down the mountain slopes.To verify this a barrage zone was established and the plants protected Inscreened enclosures which kept off thelittle nibbling animals. The plantsthrived and prospered and spreadwithin the enclosed section. Out inthe open, to either side of the barrage zone, they rapidly disappeared,being eaten by the rabbits. This explained the mysterious sudden stoppage of some of these plants not altitude nor heat nor cold, but actual destruction through being eaten. Theanimals were like a fence.The coastal laboratory at Carmel-by-the-Sea'and the desert laboratoryat Tucson, Ariz., are two of the experimental stations' which were usedin this work.FIND WRIGGLING EEL MINESteam Shovel Lifts Them Out by Hundreds From Wharf Site atPlymouth, Mass.Plymouth, Mass.

This is the summary ofPresident Wilson's proclamation asking the Nation to help the Chinese andwhich appeal the Rev. Dr. E. Y. Mullins, president of the Southern BaptistTheological Seminary, Louisville, Ky.,answered by accepting the chairmanship for Kentucky of the China Famine Fund.Dr. Mullins in making public thePresident's proclamtion, said no campaign, in the sense of a personally solicited canvass, would be held, but beginning early in February the peopleof Kentucky would be asked to sendvoluntary contributions to the StateHeadquarters in Louisville.President Wilson's proclamation follows: "A famine, alarming in its proportions, today holds in its grip severalImportant provinces in China. Thecrop failure is complete, and the present distress, which is great, is likely,before winter has run its course, to become appalling. In 'fact, our diplomatic and consular agencies in China,inform me that the loss resulting fromdeath in distressing form may run intomillions of souls. It is certain that thelocal Government and establishedagencies of relief are unable to copewith the magnitude of the disasterwhich faces them."Under the circumstances, relief tobe effective should be granted quickly.Once more an opportunity is offeredto -the American people to show thatprompt and ' generous response withwhich they have invariably met thei call of their . brother nations in distress."The case of China, I regard as especially worthy of the earnest attention of our citizeas. To an unusual degree the Chinese people look to us forcounsel and for effective friendship.Our churches, through their religiousSind medical missionaries, theirschools 4aud colleges and our philanthropic foundations have renderedChina an incalculable benefit, whichher people recognize with gratiture anddevotion to the United States. Therefore not only in the name of humanitybut in that of friendliness which wefeel for a great people in distress, Iventure to ask our citizens shall, eventhough the task of giving is not todaya light one, respond as they can1 to thisdistant but appealing cry for help."President Wilson in sending his proclamation to Dr. Mullins and throughhim to be made public, called on theseminary president to take charge ofthe campaign in Kentucky.Norman H.
