"Theatre goer of Elgin were treat
ed last night to one of the most pow
erful melodramas presented in this

play, "A Royal Slave," is a Mexican
production and with a perfect scenic
background and .a well balanced cast,
.proved a raiereat for the large audi
ence present.
Walter Hubbell, who first appeared
before an Elgin audience two years
ago in the title role of the same play,
again appeared as Aguila, the royal
slave, and interpreted his part perfect
ly. He was given encore after encore
by his auditors.
Lester R. Calvin, playing the part
of an American newspaper correpsond
ent in Mexico, is deserving of special
notice, his imitations and songs being
especially pleasing. George Fitch and
Miss Irene Soloiuon added color to the
performance by their finished acting.
The play was remarkably well stag
ed and the costumes worn by the actors
ana actresses of costly texture. Tha
fourth act Is one of the most forceful
scenic effects ever presented in the
Elgin opera house and Mr. Hubbell
was much applauded during the entire
scene."

is "The American Chanticleer Girl."
