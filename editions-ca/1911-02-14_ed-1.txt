I.wat heldFriday evening from 8 till 12 in thedrill hall. Fur the past several yearsthese classes have ben giving individual dances on a somewhat smallerscale. It was decided this year to givea joint midwinter dance, which hasbeen looked forward to by a societycircle in this and our sister town, asone of the pleasant eventu of the winter. The cadets have been enthusiasticand with the help of Mrs. Best, whocannot be excelled in social functions,made of this the crowning social eventof the institution.The dances which have been held inthe past have been pleasant and evenbrilliant, but the Senior-Junior danceof Friday evening surpasses all of itspredecessors in numbers, brilliancy,dress and pleasure. The weather,with all interested, has been the absorbing topic of conversation for several days, as much depended on it. Earlyin the morning of Friday all reaizedthat the coming event would be acrowning success and the weitherseemed to have been created fcr theoccasion.Guests arrived on all trors duringthe day and the holiday spirit seemedto prevade everybody. The eveningtrain from Lexington brought in morethan forty beautiful young ladies andchaperones. Col. and Mrs. liest leftnothing undone that would enhancethe pleasure of the occasion. AH ofthe lower floor of the main building ofthe institution was thrown open to theaccommodation of the guests. Thespacious drill hall was decorated intrue military style. This, with pennants of many colleges and universities, created a beautiul scene and onedid not have to draw on the imagination to fanry that he or she was at anational military ball. Ihe music wasfurnished by the Wright SaxophoneTroi of Columbus, Ohio.At shortly after eight o'clock thegrand march opened, which was participated in by twenty-three couples.In this all the dancing cadets were introduced. The figures were good andwell executed, after which the program of twenty-four numbers was begun. It was a brilliant aspect. Attimes the floor was somewhat crowdedas more than fifty couples wtre dancings It was a brilliant occasion madeup of the representative people of thisaid all the surrounding towns.When the first half of the programwas completed lunch was announced inthe dining room, but owing to thelarge crowd about half of the numberwas taken in at a time, and duringfour or five numbers, while lunch wasin prrogess, there was just enough onthe floor to make.it comfortable.

V. Bacon, of the Parisi Base Ball Club closed a deal Saturdayi for the sale of Wesley Holder, ofjLyonsJnd... who was last year themainstay of the Paris club behind thebat, to the Terre Haute Club of theCentral League. The sale of Holdermakes the seventh membsr of the BuleGrass League champions of last yearto advance to higher leagues.Umpire Jack Ronan has been ordered by the Blue Grass League to reportin Paris, May 8. He is to receive theregular League pay $125 a mjnth andexpenses.The Frankfort News says: "It isknown tow be a fact that, one of thebest evidences of a live progressivecity is the fact that the citizens arewilling to contribute enough.money topay part of the expens of running agood'nase ball club in a good leagueis allowed to drop out, the common expression is 'Well, that is a dead town.'"Right now it is a question as towhether Frankfort will be classed assuch a town or not. Unless a sufficient sum of money can be raised inthe next few days to guarantee themanager against a big loss, the Frankfort franchise in the Blue Gras?League will have to be surrendered.The committee that has been solicitinghas met with considerable success sofar and a number of liberal subscriptions are expected today and Friday."The reputation of Frankfort forprcgressiveness is at stake and thepublic spirited citizens should help outthe cluli whether they can attend theball games or not every time one isplayed. It would be a shame to let itba said that cities like Paris, Maysville and Winchester can raise enoughmoney to remain in the Blue GrassLeague and Frankfort cannot."What Richmond expects to do to gether club in shape for this season is amatter of deep concern in the Pioneercity.

Theold association refuses absolutely toh lve anything to do ith reorganizing,aid ns nearlv everv business man ofI the town was connected with the former club, it leaves no one who willtake hold and push the oragnization ofa new club. As the time grows nearer,it is believed, however, that Richmond will have a team, but there isnothing to depend upon just now. Ameetinsr of the old stockholders isI scheduled for February 15, at whichtime it is believed some plan will beformulated whereby Richmond willagain be represented in the league.The Winchester Democrat says:"But little has been said in regard tothe Winchester hase ball club, butsince the double section has beenadopted, work has been begun on the' team tor 1911. The sales of Toney tothe Chicago club and Kirchei to theSouthern League has reduced the deficit left by the last disastrous season.Contracts have been sent to the oldDlavers and they will report in duetime.

What kind ofwife do you esiiect her to make?""IIow should I know her qualifications for a wife?" Marriage is a lottery.Other men may marry for qualifications, but we youngsters don't pretendto forecast what a girl's going to be.And I don't believe the old ones hit itany better than we.""What makes you set your fianceedown as a fool?""I'll tell you, but, I must begin backa little way. She's Madge Whitrldge,only it should be Madge Wildfire instead. Not that she is so wild as shewas. She's been quieted-down a bit by1 a certain little happening that camonear resulting disastrously. She nearly caused my death.""You don't mean it! Not intentionI ally, I suppose."I "Well, whether there was a spark of, intention in it I don't know. You neverj can tell what a woman is going to doj or why she docs it. We can't be sureshe knows herself. If Madce hadf I caused my death any prosecuting at-( toruey might have made a very goodcase against her of doing it with mal, ice a fo ret he light.

Shemight have done it before this thingj I'm going to tell you about happened;but, as I said, it sobered her, and she'squite tame. That's the time I chose for1 putting salt on the bird's tail., "There's more appropriateness Inthis simile than you may imagine, asyou'll see In a moment. But for theIncident. We 'floor gliders,' as ouecalled our dancing club of young peo-pie there was not one over twenty,' and some of the girls weren't over fifteenconcluded we'd celebrate thei Mardi Gras with a masquerade ball. I'd' been getting sweet on Madge Wildfire' I may as well call her and about thetime the costumes were being arrang' ed I was sitting up to her like a &ickkitten to a warm brick. In fact, wearranged to have corresponding cos-tumes for the ball.! "This was after Rostand's play of' 'Chantecler' came out, and everybodywas talking about It. You know thatI the leading lady chicken in the play, Is the hen pheasant, the leading gentleman being the rooster chanticleer,i We concluded to get ourselves up asthese two birds. I was a mouth arranging my outfit I did it all myself,i you know but when 1 got it done ItI was a corker. I made the body of arooster, which I strapped under my! arms, with an elegant head and combI In front and a fine display of cock'si tail behind, the tall being made of! tissue paper of different color. Youj couldn't have told It from the realthing."I went to see Madge the afternoon' before the ball. It .. happened thatwe got to quarreling, and I wentoff in a huff. This was unfortunate,to say the least. We had spent a lotof time getting up our bird rigs andexpected to make a lot of fun billincrand cooing during the ball, and theworst of it was, now that we were injust the opposite condition from whatwe expected, we hadn't lime to getother rigs.""What was the cause of the quarrel?" "We tried on our costumes In ad-vance, and when she walked I toldher she waddled like a duck. Thatt made her mad, and she fired back, andI we soon were in for it hot and heavy."When the ball came off, instead ofi walking about together, I strutting,j she cuddling up beside me, we were asme nparc as possioie ana when wemet glared at each other. After awhileI saw her sitting In a window withXed Tucker. This made me all firedjealous as well as mad, and to showmy spleen what did I do but go upnear where they were silling andwhisk around with the intention ofturning my back on Madge. I didn'tcalculate haw near my tail featherswere to them, but it seems theybrushed their faces. This made Madgemadder than ever. Ned had just strucka match to light a cigarette. Madgejerked it out of his hand and held itunder the tip of my tail."In a second the whole of it was iuflames. I tried to get the rooster partof me off, but it was tied on so wellthat I couldn't do it. The flames ranfrom the tail to the wings and .fromtue wings to the rest of the body. Thewhole roomful of people rushed towardme, scared out of their seven senses,every one crying, Tut him out!'Whether they meant to put out theflames or put me ou,t to prevent my setting them all afire I don't know. Iwas howling with the burns and withfear when a Roman senator took offhis togs and wrapped it about me."I was taken to a carriage and home.I wasn't burned at all, but just to puuish the confounded girl that appliedthe match I gave out that I might die.She was knocked clean out, and whenI let up on her she wilted. She hadput a match to my tail; 1-put salt onhers and caught her.""You mean she caught you. Thereare lots of men who think thov do flmmatching when they are caught them-Motor Too Quiet-Arrested..The 1911 season has unquestionably accomplished much inthe way of quiet running motors. An unusual and ratheramusing incident of this was recently given in Los Angeles.J. B. Morrow, who owns an Inter-State, left the car alongsidethe sidewalk, thinking he had shut off the motor. A shortcircuit, however, kept the engine running, but so quietly thatMorrow did not detect it. A number of the Los Angeles policeforce coming up the sidewalk also thought the motor dead, andin order to grab a moments repose leaned up against the car'shood. He then detected a slight vibration, made investigationand found the motor running most industriously. He arrestedMorrow for leaving the engine running for over a half hour on.the street. -From the San Francisco Bulletin.1 Sss Br MMP MP HsslP SSSSjsrBt. i?vBourbon Garage and Supply Co.Thirty Years Together.Thirty years of association Thinkof it.

Apparently the British public Is notproperly enlightened as to the variousways of preparing tinned corn, cornmeal and hominy.

Phillip Terry further HonoredThe Royal Geographical Society ofLondon, an institution founded in 1E30by the great explorer cf that date,has recently elected Mr. T. PhililpTerry a Fellow. This is indeed a highhonor. The late Henry M. Stanleywas a member, and among the veryfew Americans who can now claimmembersnip is Commander Robert E.Peary, cf Aictic exploration fame.Mri leiry, uro is n Lrother of Miss-jes Beatrice and Maragiet Terry of this,city lelt his home in fans somethingover twentj-five years eko, wntnmere lad, for the West. He secured aposition in Kansas City with the Wells,Fargo Express Company, and afUrserving aome time v. ith them as anemploye in the oliice and then as express messenger, he removed to Mexico City, Mexico, where he secured employment with an American firm.During his leisure hours he appliedhimself diligently to the study of theSpanish language, which he-masteredso completely that within a few yearshe issued an "interpreter" to be usedby visitors to that country, and whichmet with such success that it is nowrunning through the thirteenth edition.His success in a business way in Mexi-'co attracted the attention of a great jsyiiuiuatu in rnuw xum, wnu seeureu Irus services as a commercial missionary. His field was the world. He wasnot expected to sell any goods, but tovisit foreign countries and work up afeeling of good .fellowship among theJapanese, Chinese, Koreans, Russians,French and all other foreign merchantsfor American dealers. He would befollowed in a short time by the salesman, who would secure large ordprsfor their houses. In this capacity hemade seven complete trips around theglobe, being accompaniedby hi3 wife,One of his children was born in Yokohama, Japan.Six years ago he resigned his position and gave his attention to a business which hf had started while livingin Mexico and which had grown sorapidly that it needed hi3 personal services. Meanwhile he wrote and gaveto the travelers of the wcrld "Terry'sMexico," said to be the most complueguide Look ever published. It is superior to the famous Baedeker of Europe,because it is more complete, and iswritten in the charming literary stylethat makes it valuable .as a librarybook even to those who cannot visitthe ecenes it depicits. This book ismeeting with a phenomenal sale.It attracted the attention of President Porfirio Diaz, who sent for Mr.Terry and personally thanked him forhis great work. Many of the bookswere bought by the Mexican government to send to its consuls, ambassadors, etc , and all of the railroads thatnow gridiron the republic on uur, Southsupplied their non-resident agentswith them that they might be placedin the hands of those visiting thatcountry. Although this book has notbeen ouc a great while, it is now in itssecond edition and the demand for ithas not diminished in the least.When on a recent visit to his sistersin Paris he arranged for the erectionof two dwelling houses in Paris on thelot at Twelfth and Main streets, wherehe spent his boyhood, thinking that hewould spend at least a part of the summer in Paris to see after their construction. But on arriving in Boston,the desire to again visit the East cameover him so on next Thursday he andhis wife will leave for San B'rancisco,where they will take ship for Japan,China, Korea and other countries.Urbs In Rure.Patent leather shoes were prominent among the Grangers, rather thanboots.
