The Farmers' -Bank of Millers-
.fcurg shows perhaps the most rapid
growth of any bank in the State of
Kentucky for its capacity and sur
roundings, this. too. in view of the
- fac that Millersburg is not a county
Allen, the institution was soon put
on a firm basis. After the death of
Mr. Robert Tarr, some ten years ago,
Mr. Allen, succeeded him as Presi
dent, which position he held until
July, 1916. Mr. Allen has seen the
bank, grow from an exceedingly small
bank to one of the solid financial in
stitutions. In July, 1916, after the
death of Mr. Allen, Mr. W. D. Mcln
tyre was made President. Mr. S. M.
Allen continued as Cashier, which
position he had held since his father
had assumed the presidency of the'
bank. Mr. Allen is a young man, a
live wire, wide awake and full of
push, pluck, energy and ability.
With these two young men at the
head of the institution it began to
make rapid strides and through their
business energies and prosperities of
the times leaving nothing undone on
their part to make the bank a pro
nounced success.
