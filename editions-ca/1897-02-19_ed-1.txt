weary way my babesA long and -weary wayCares wake with morn and hover near-Throughout the livelong dayAnd oft when thou art wrapped in sleepCares still their tedious vigils keepOut of the all surrounding gloomThe gray years come and goSilent they pass nor ever hearThe voice of mortal woeAr all the store of gifts they bringBefore the happy few they flingThese lightly sing and gayly hailThis world all flowery fairFor them its hours are rich with sweetsAnd mirth the king of careBut O the poor who dare not playThey fiftd lifes road a weary wayThe many bide in want my babesThough joy seems meant for allIn vain they call on God for aidHe does not heed their callPerhaps the Master wills that manHimself shall frame a fairer planWere toil sole price of mortal lifeIt were not dearly boughtToil is indeed a solace dearFor what weve vainly soughtWhile labor holds the thoughts in thrallSouls cease to hear their longings callWe may not know by what a planThe Master holds His swayWe only know that joys and griefsAlternate rule our dayThat each His purpose to fulfillMust bow to the Eternal willWherefore do thou rejoice my babesEre youthful days departToo soon the solemn 5ears will castA shadow in each heartPraise God thou knowst it not to dayPlow life shall prove a weary wayAnd yet not all a weary waySome long forgotten strainOf springtimes music echoes backAnd makes us glad

The trunk out of which she hadtaken the gown a few hours beforestood under the sloping eaves Shecrawled toward it on her hands andknees and dragged it out to the middle of the floor Then she began mechanically to unfasteu her dress andlittle by little as she did so there grewout of the half light in the room the figure of another woman younger thanherself by some 18 years who watchedher with sad and reproachful eyesHerself in truth in the likeness of heryouth the youth she had flung fromher with a stubborn handShe opened the trunk An odor ofcamphor struck across that of theherbs Here lay her wedding thingsin careful and separate fdlds beribboried and beruffed yellowing withage She ran her fingers along thetopinost garment it was trimmed withrows of some delicate hand knit Ipceand she remembered having walkedtwo miles in the sun to beg for thepattern Below this showed a loosenedbreadth of something fine and dovecolored It was the dress in whichshehad expected to marry Adam

to formulate a ration forhis dairy cow He savs For roughness I have enough shredded corn-fodderto give one feed a day and alfalfaand sorghum hay for the other feedFor grain old process oil meal at 20per ton wheat bran at seven dollars andcorn at 13 cents per bushel I preferto feed corn with the husks on depending on hogs to clean up the waste as Iallow them to work over the manurebefore hauling lo the field I am making butter at 20 cents per pound andwant the most economical productionTo which Prof W A Henry rexiies asfollowsOur correspondent can present amost excellent bill of fare to his covsand with the feeds at the prices naijedcan still make a good living in sellingl utter at 20 cents per pound provided everything is well managed andhe has good cows Do not think of usiig oil meal at the price named lor itis much the dearest food on the listILc alfalfa hay furnishes a good dealof protein making the necessity forWan not quite so great as if no alfalfawere fed on the other hand bran ischeap at seven dollars per ton Theeastern farmer would consider it almost a gift at such figures and whencorn is 13 cents or less per bushel orless than live dollars per ton all comparisons are of little avail Gie thejust as proposed then feed the equal often pounds of shell corn per thousandpounds of animal and give four poundsof wheat bran additional On this ration you should get about a pound ofbutter per cow daily with part of theherd fresh in spring and fresh part infall Be very careful to make the bestvse of the skim milk for no small partof the real profit comes from this Aimto feed not over three jjounds of skimmilk to one pound of corn to the piglore milk than this means a waste ofa most valuable by productWith corn at 13 cents per bushel andpork at three cents per pound the skimmilk should be worth 25 cents per 100pounds In its effect on young pigs inbuilding bone and muscle it is most valuable It is a necessity in the westv here bone and muscle-building- feedsare of the highest importance becausecorn is apt to be overfedFEEDING THE CALVESA Cheap and Handy Device Designed forThis PurposeIt is claimed that young calves whenfed on skim milk in the usual wayfrom a bucket or a trough gulp it downtoo rapidry for best results A cheapand handy device is made by using apieceof light wood board cut round soas to fit loosely inside of a common pailCALF FEEDING

of milk Heavy and fatiguing exercise or worlc diminishes thequantity of milk but the effect on itsquality is not -so clear or uniformThis is the conclusion arrived at byllcnkel in Germany after many experiments and an exhaustive study ofthe literature of the subject It confirms the judgment iof our best American dairymen The health of the cowand besl results in imlk and butter require moderate exercise outdoors during winter instead of being kept constantly tied up in close barns as isthe pisictice with inany dairymenOrange Judd FarmerWlgjr Milk Should Be AeratedDo not put milk into closely

be done with the use of but onestake secondly these stakes are notdriven into fresh earth but into thatjuut outside of the hole that was excavated and filled in during the planting processThis method of staking is suited totrees in almost any situation In thestreet for instance by having two oithe stakes enter the soil at the curband these spread a little farther apartthan the distance to the other stakethe tree may be brought within a footand a half of the curb and it shouldnever be closer It is at once apparenthow easily the tripod may be madeto serve as a tree guard against horsesand dogs by running wire held in placeby staples horizontally from stake tostake around the tree The first wirenmy be a foot above the ground to admit of the lawn mower passing underneath above this they might be threeor four inches apartThe plan here illustrated is best suited to trees ranging from six to twelvefeet in height In the case of transplanting larger trees except in thestreet the same plan may be modifiedby substituting the use of wire foithe stakes In that event the stays jmay be attached higher up in the treethan when stakes are used even amongbranches say at two thirds thethe tree provision being oicourse made for attaching the wiresboth in the tree and at the ground Inthe tree two iron half bands fitted withL ends and short bolts should be madeto tightry encircle the trunk at theproper height To this completed bandthe wire stays are attached extendingto the ground Here they are madei fast to three stout stakes driven intothe ground at equal distance apart andsome feet aAvay from the tree Ordinary fence wire will answer very wellfor the purpose If the trees are quitelarge the wire may be doubledSome one say that the stakeswires and the work involve expenseThis is

although during the present century atleast no single famine in India has attained that magnitude it is estimatedthat in the score or more disasters of thekind which have occureds between 15--000000and 20000000 lives have beenlost That which began in 1S75 andculminated in 1S77 was the most prolonged and destructive resulting in tindeath of 5500000 persons In lSG5 6a third of the

oithe native governments were besiegedand when the royal granaries wrere emptied the gods were propitiated with saclifices ending with the slaughter of human victims and the distribution oitheir flesh over the barren fields Butduring the past 30 years these deviceshave given wav to remedial measuresof a more practical and effective kindTaught by long experience the government of India has elaborated a systemof relief machine like in its operationcapable of being put inito effect at anytime and of adjustment to the needsof any particular scarcity The old notion that a government cannot

and inwhich sap had given place to hardyfiber If the young shoots have beenkilled as now seems likely the blowwill be a terrible one to the growersfor hundreds of them have investedtheir all in the attempt to rehabilitatetheir grovesIt is estimated that there were 200000 acrea in vegetables south of Jack-I sonville and the crop woiild soon havebeen ready for the northern marketsNinety per cent of this crop is lost andthe -truckers are now contemplating aheavy outlay and no hope of returnsThe vegetable acreage was much largerthan usual because since the destruction of the orange groves in 1895 growers generally had turned to vegetablesfor revenue while engaged in rehabilitating their grovesThe loss will reach hundreds of thousands of dollars and if the orangeshoots are killed will run in the millions The loss will fall heavily on thecountry merchants and the countrybanks which have made advances to thetruckers The railroads also which received fancy rates for carrying the

conversation later turnedto shop One of them had recentlymoved his office down town and therewas some discussion as to the advisability of separating house and officeWell said the separatist I cantsee any difference so long as I am atmy office during office hoursLet me tell you a story remarkedthe oldest man in the party Thirtyyears ago when I began practice I livedin Virginia and for a year or two Islept in my office Then I married andmy wife owned a nice house and I wentto it to live It sat back from the streetabout 50 feet and we decided that itwould be much nicer if we had my officeout on the street in the far corner of thelot Only 50 feet away you will observe but still it was enough In orderto see suoh callers as came during thenight I had a night bell and a speakingtube connecting the front door of theoffice with my bedroom You see I didnot want a patient to escape under anycircumstancesWell everything went nicely enoughfor three years or so when one night aring came to my bell It was then about2 oclook in the morning and the ringwas a hot one I asked who it was andthe answer came from a friend of mineto the effect that he was a mighty sickman and wanted to see me at once Itold him to come around to the houseand I would meet him at the door andtake care of him Then I got up andputting on my dressing gown and slippers I proceeded to the front door Butthere was no one there and no one insight on the way between the gate andthe houseThat was odd and I went back andcalled through the tube to know whatwas wrong I received no answer andbeing quite unable to account for it Ik took my lamp it was a very dark andstill nignt ana started to go ouc anuinvestigate Just as I was about to stepoff the porch I lowered my lamp toget a better light on the step and thereat the foot of the porch lay a body Iturned it over at once and as the lightfell on the face I saw it was my friendwho had only a minute before spoken tome He was quite dead And when anexamination was madeit was discoveredthat he had died of heart disease andso near to me that I could almost havetouched him Possibly I could not havebeen of any service to him if I had seenhim when he first rang the bell but thepossibility that I might so affected methat from that day to this I have hadmy office as near my bed as I could getit ExchangeHE LOST A FORTUNEOr There Are Moments Wlien One Wantsto Be AloneA

packages of good money tocatch suckers with and this moneyamounting to over 150000 was captured and placed in a big satchel by thecaptain I called on him for details ofthe story that afternoon He was alonein the office There were three of usthe captain myself and the satchel Heopened the satchel and showed mewealth beyond my wildest dreams Ihated to leave the beautiful visionAnd the narrator sighed deeplyWell said his friend I dont seehow that was anything like making youa rich manYou dont Well let me tell youthis If the captain had turned his backfor just six seconds I would have beena
