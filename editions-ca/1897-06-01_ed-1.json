C F Clay is a horse of great finish and style in fact as much so as any horse
we know of Is axbeautiful mahogany bay with black points and stands 153J

ter the dam of China Silk two-year-old record 216 beyond question the best
two-year-old filly of 1896 As a two three and five-year-old C F Clay was cam

dividuality and are especially speedy and asto race horse qualities the perfor
mances of Coleridge 205 Choral 208 Connor 211 Arthur W 211 and others
are too recent and of too much merit to need any comment But few better sires
than C F Clay are now in the stud His colts are not only trotters but are show
horses as well having probably been awarded as many premiums at the leading
fairs as the get of any horse in Kentucky C F Clay will make the season of 1897
