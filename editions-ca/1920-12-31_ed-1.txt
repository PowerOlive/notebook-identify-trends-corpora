Wagons anatrucks have been going throughParis each day for some" time. Thethree sales floors of the .Bourbon Tobacco Warehouse Company are practically fall of tobacco, and a largeamount has been unloaded at theNew Independent Tobacco Warehouse Co.'s houses Buyers for allthe big tobacco houses will be hereby the opening day, and the auctioneers have already arrived.Most of the weed already receivedand placed on the floors is said byobservers to be of fair quality, although there is a general belief thatthe weight will be light. Some of theleaves are said to be the largest andfinest quality for some time, butthere is a deficiency in weight whichwill, of course, reduce the remuneration to the grower. Many of thegrowers are said to b taking the advice given them on all sides and arekeeping their poor grades at homo.In no other way, U is said, can pricesbe kept up to a pacing margin.A matter of great concern to thegrowers is that of the extremelylight weight of this year's crop. OnFebruary 11, 1920, on a floor ofone of the local houses there wen1,404 baskets of tobacco, whichweighed 357,000 pounds, the largestsale ever held in Paris.

Davis, Paris grand old man"It was with genuine sorrowread of the death of Mr. George v.Davis. He was one of the best menI ever k'ew. His death has deprived Paris of one of its best citizens,and the community of a man whecould not well be spared from itbbusiness life. Words seem so futflewhen one tries to describe the lireand virtues of this good man. Theiearea great many people professing t:be Christians, but leal Christians ofthe George W. Davis type are regrettably scarce."I believe at times a, great manvof us entertain some doubts of immortality, or, at least, of an immortality that comprehends a continuance of the personality, but if beautiful characters like the lato GeorgeW. Daviy, whe dissipated thsedoubts, because it if so hard to conceive of such a useful life being rewarded with utter oblivion. I havenever known one who seemed to moreclearly walk hand .n hand with God.Conscience guided his every act. Hewas a model of mental industry inhis efforts to instruct the people.He was strictly honest in the servic?he rendered. He was not only amodel Cbiistian. but he was an honorable gentleman in the highestsense the term implies. To man, woman or child, sainc or sinner, he always extended a cordial greeting,that lent a r,ay of light to brightentheir pathway in the journey cf life.He commanded the respect of all secisand classes of people. Pans reanydid not. I suppose appreciate histrue worth until after the thread oflife was severed, but now the peoplemust have awakened to the realization that a good ar.d righteous manhas been taken from them."BAPTIST .CHURCH TO GIVE SOCIAL TO NIGHTThe members of the Baptist churchinvite you to meet them in a sociaito be given at seven o'clock, to-night,Friday, DecemDer 6i, in me ujiuiuuDUilding.

Tift College of Agriculture recommends that it is usually a mistake to kill the mature sowthat has raised a good litter of pigs.She should be retained in the breeding herd unless there is some goodreason for discarding her.It is well to study a sow veryclosely before deciding to breed herand when she has raised a good litterbhe should be further developed andretained' if she proved worthy.Records show that sows on the average, farrow and raise more andbetter pigs in the second and subsequent litter than they do the first.After she has weaned her first litter she will make easy and fairlyrapid gains if properly fed, andshould continue to gain in growthand weight up to the time she farrows her fcecond litter.Considering the present price ofcorn the average farmer should produce a reasonable quantity of hogs.YOU LOVE LIME? vTakes On a Different Color WhenYour Blood Is Rich andFree "From PoisonNotkre to StockhilderjThe stockholders of the Farmers'1and3 Traders Bank; of Pari1, Kentucky, will . meetv,at their" bank'Uyhouse on Monday, January 3, 1920,between the hours, of 91 . m. and 3p. m., to elect directors for the ensuing year.PRANK P.

Last January she had a severe attack of pneumonia and for a time no hope washeld out for her recovery. Finallythe crisis passed, however, and shewas able to sit up, but had to be lifted in and out of bed. She had noappetite, could not eat and just lingered on in her weakened condition.. "After the ordinary treatmentfailed to start her up hill I boughther a bottle of Tanlac and the wayshe has improved is astonishing.In a few days she had a splendid appetite and was up and about thehouse and is like an entirely different person. It has helped her justlike it had been made especially forher case and I have never seen orheard of anyone getting back theirstrength so rapidly. She slrep3soundly every night, gets up in themorning feeling thoroughly restedand refreshed. She has also gottenrid of a very annoying cough thepneumonia left her- with, and isgaining right along in weight. Iam thankful to vee her gettingstrong and well again that I can'tjust express my gratitude."Tanlac is sold in Paris at the People's Phamacy.

That's ane reason why s'omany painters have bad backs andsick kidneys. Exposure, frequentcolds and chills and the cjtrain ofclimbing up and down ladders helpstart the trouble.If your back aches, if sharp painsstrike you in the back when stoopinglifting or walking; if you have headaches, dizziness, rheumatic pairu, ifthe urine is discolored or passagespainful and scanty, try Doan's Kidney Pills, the remedy so widelyused and so well recommended bypien in the painting trade. Here's aParis testimony:Ed. Richardson, painter and decorator, 552 Vine street, says: "Isuffered severely from my back andit put me past going.
