writes For twenty seven years I had been
a constant sufferer from nervous prostra

fit Threo years ago my condition was
alarming the least noise would startle and
unnerve me I was unable to sleep had a
number of sinking spells and slowly grew
worse I began using Dr Miles Restorative
Nervine and Nerve and Liver Pills At first
the medicine seemed to have no effect but
after taking a few bottles I began to notice
a change I rested better at night my appe

better until now I am as nearly restored

OLD SivlOKESTACKS
An Article For Which There Is Always
Demand
Among the very great variety of
things that may be bought at second
hand are smokestacks of iron or of
steel It may be that an establishment
puts in a bigger boiler and wants a big
ger stack If it is using a steel or an
iron stack the old one is taken down
carefully and a new one set up The old
stack may be sold to a dealer in second
hand boilers and machinery or the
owner may keep it and sell it himself
to somebody that wants a secondhand
smokestack If it is sold to a dealer he
may remove it to his own yard or it
may be that the original owner eeps it
on his premises until the deader has
sold it A manufacturer may move from
one place to another and sell the old
plant or parts of it Here would be a
secondhand smokestack Secondhand
stacks are bought by various users It
may be that the smokestack of an estab
lishment is worn out and that the boiler
is not and that a secondhand stack
would last out the life of the boiler In
such a case the user would get a second
hand stack if ho could find one suitable
Secondhand stacks may be used with
various temporary plants set up by con
tractors and others A smokestack may
be blown down in a windstorm and the
user supply the place of it with one
bought secondhand
A steel or iron stack costs about half
as much as a brick stack A secondhand
iron stack costs about half as much as a
new one Stacks of metal are made now
usually of steel The steel used costs
now less than wrought iron There is
an increasing use of steel instead of
brick stacks Steel stacks up to 6 and 7
feet in diameter would be classed as
portable stacks larger stacks would be
of more or less permanent character
Steel smokestacks are now made up to
38 feet in diameter Very large smoke
stacks may be lined with brick
Secondhand smokestacks up to 2 feet
in diameter are likely to be found in
stock in the yard of the dealer in second
hand boilers and machinery and he is
likely to have stacks of larger sizes else
where There is always a demand for
secondhand

AVOIDING A TOUCH
One Womans Cheerful Method of Deny
ing a Polite Request
Men have something to learii from
women ju the art of warding off
touches for coin Women respond to
such requests about once in every thou
sand times but they are scientific in
their refusals A Washington woman
with a reputation as a borrower turned
up at the home of one of her friends the
other morning with a much done over
story about a persistent and threatening
dressmaker and the usual request for
the loan pay it back tomorrow cer
tain of 5
Why my dear certainly j wasthe
pleasant response to her carefully re
hearsed little yarn You poonthing
youl Just wait till I run up stains and
get my purse l
She ran up stairs The male head of
the house happened to be in the room
where she kept her purse He saw her
dig the purse out of a chiffonier drawer
and deliberately remove a wad of bills
from it leaving about 87 cents in silver
and copper in the change receptacle
The man was mean enough to lean over
the stair railing when his wife went
down stairs to the parlor with her flat
tened pocketbook in her hand
Oh Pin so sorry Mrs X he
heard her ay but I really thought I
had the money I find though that
John as usual has been at my purse
I heard him say something about set
tling a plumbers bill last night when I
was half asleep and the mean thing
has only left me enough for car fare
Too bad Of course you know if Ihad
it etc Washington Post
The Coin Cauie Back
I have once or twice read how small
the world was said a young fellow
and once or twice I have seen stories
of the same kind I am going to tell I
confess I never believed them but now
I know better Last summer when in
New York on my annual visit I was
struck with a sudden whim and
scratched my initials on a 25 cent piece
cutting into the silver deep enough to
make a lasting impression I paid for a
cigar in the Hoffman House with the
coin and guyed myself with being fool
ish I had forgotten all about the quar
ter when I entered a Carrollton car and
gave a half dollar to the conductor Im
agine my surprise when he handed me
in change the 25 cent piece I spent in
the Hoffman House 1 I think I will keep
the coin now and ever more as a curios
ity and the speaker pulled the money
from his pocket and showed it in veri
fication of his story New Orleans

Curious Policies
Accident insurance policies have tak
en many curious shapes ranging from
the penny in the slot to the coupon in
the weekly newspaper but the limit
has been reached in London where the
purchaser of a book of cigarette paper
is insured for 50 for a period of 70
days The annual cost of this amount
of insurance is about 75 cents a year
provided the holder of the novel policy
is not a cigarette fiend The amount of
insurance is specifically set aside for
the defraying of funeral expenses in the
event of accidental death New York

MOW TO FIND OUT
Fill a bottle or common gla5S with urine
and let it stand twenty four hours a sedi
ment or settling indicates an unhealthy con
dition of the Kidneys When urine stains
linen it is evidence of kidney trouble Too
frequent desire to urinate or pain in the
back is also convincing proof lhat the kid
neys and bladder are out of order
WHAT TO IH
There is comfort in the knowledge so often
expressed that Dr Kilmer Swamp Root
the great kid ey remedy fulfills every wish
in relieving pain in the back kidneys liver
bladder and every part of the urinary pas-
i sages It corrects inability to hold urine ana
witb which I had been afflicted for more i scalding pain in passing i

sules I have lost ail trace of pam and my I i omes mat unpleasant necessity ot being
compelled to ge lTp mony times during the
stomach is entirely well I can eat any- night to urinate The mild and the
thine and can truthfully say that I have dinary etiect or wamp Koot is soon realized
It stands the highest for its wonderful cures
