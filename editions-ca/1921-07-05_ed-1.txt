C. PARRISH.Realizing that the City' of Parisshould have as its chief executive inits time of extremity one upon whom1the city can rely to administer jtsaffairs in an economical, dignified,p.ffimpnt nnrl ssitia manner, alfdfurther realizing that your past ex-.Tiftri f&n n c f!rm n oilman 5Tin Gnflir-man of the Finance Committee hasjrendered you eminently qualified lorthis high post of honor, which youwill occupy with credit and distinction, not only to .the citizens of Paris,but to yourself also, we are hereby calling upon you to make therace for the Democratic nominationfrtv TVTnxrnv Anmiet fifViJ.VJ. i.J.Ji, .J-Ug, VIUU vu.i. .We believe your past record coinas a business man and as a Councilman entitles you to the respect ofevery good citizen of Paris, and willdeliver to you this nomination without any difficulty whatever, and wefurther believe you owe it toyournative city and to yourself to doyour part in rescuing Paris from thesituation in which she finds herself.We are tired of law suits, injunctions and vain promises. We wantaction. We have had one extravagance piled upon another until thistown has become almost the highestpriced one in Kentucky in which tolive. A person of moderate or anyother kind of means .can not affordto own property here on account ofthe high tax rate and the multipliedproperty valuation, and renters arebeing deprived of their hard-earneddollars for the same reason.We believe you will do your bestto return us to normalcv. and weknow at no time will you permit yourmouth J;o iwjork 'faster Jithan yourhrnin. We want a Mavor for Pariswho will be for the best interests ofthe citizens of Paris and the community at large. We believe you arethat man, for you have never beenan advertiser of self, nor have youever been afflicted with an exaggerated ego. In other words, we believe you would be considering yourcity instead of yourself. From , abusiness standpoint we believe youwould make an ideal Mayor. Weknow you would be at least conscientious and sensible. The citizens ofParis would now be enjoying a waterrent annroximatelv 50 lower thanthey are now paying had they accepted the contract you were directly responsible in having submitted tothem for their endorsement, andwhich was so violently opposed andmisrepresented by at least pne andpossibly two of the present candidates for Mayor, resulting in itsdefeat. This means there wouldnow be thousands of dollars in thecitizens' pockets where now therei&s.an aching void. We want a watchdog for tne City's money, and webelieve vou are the one to nlace onethere, and the right one at that. Webelieve you will curtail every unnecessary expense and extravagantact, and if given the right co-operationbring us back from the peakof exftravagjance to the plane ofsound business, doing away with thepresent practice lof importing experts for this that and Mother onthe slightest pretext, and with noapparent result except that more expense is added to the already overburdened taxpayers and rents go upagain, for the reason rents are sohigh in Paris is that taxes and valuations are so much higher in Paristhan they should be, and they arehigher because the City's financeshave been expended on things thatwere immaterial rather than on thehorrible 'holes and bumps lin ourstreets.We do not believe vou will bewax in any man's hands, for youhave alwavs shown that vnm ron-victions meant something to you andyou will not subsidize them to thepossibility of again running forMayor or something else, for we realize it will mean a real sacrifice toyou to be Mayor. We further believe you will stand for the cityordinances that should be enforced,and have the many silly ones now inexistence repealed. We know yourealize the fact that the police forceis under the direct supervision ofthe Mayor, and that it is the Mayor'sright to suspend any officer forcause, and that you will have 'themanhood not to try and lay any inefficiency that may exist iin thisbody, if any, to any door but to thatwhich it belongs the Mayor's.For these reasons, and for manymore just as strenuous, that couldbe enumerated, we are asking youto make this race, even though it beat a sacrifice to yourself in a greatmany ways. If the other candidatesfor this office really have thfe betterment of Paris as their first andhighest motives they will withdrawm favor of D. C. Parrish, and startoff with a unanimity of interestthat leads to a truly great little City.Sincerely,.IANY VOTERS AND TAX PAYERS(Adv-lt)BOURBON CIRCUIT COURTMost of the day in the Court Saturday was taken up with the hearingof the case of Charles Howard, colored, Charflred with the TnnrHv Vvf "KVnnTr.Humphreys, also colored, in Claysville, several weeks ago.

In thecase of Utah and her anti-cigarettelaw, the governed do not, as it happens, consent which is all the worsefor the law. In Salt Lake City it isa dead letter fiom the start. It isopenly violated, and there are no arrests because no one will swear tocomplaints. The Chief of Police declares in all frankness that he willmake no particular effort to enforceit, and other officials consider theiroths of office with misgiving. As forthe public, it has apparently becomea point of honor to violate ratherthan to abide by the law; people whonever smoke a cigarette before intheir lives are now to be seen inhaling the noxious fumes, purely as amatter of protest, of course.EX-PRESIDENT TAET NOW CHIEFJUSTICE11ass st.LMfevUI Ky.HalTs Catarrh MedicineThose who are ina "run down" condl-DB Will BOtir.A that faarv ViViiathem much more than when they are Inapod health.

My 4k:' , ,,irKentucky Jockey ChtbLatonia, Ky.,-CouneARE VACATIONS SOTFUL?This is a poor time of year forSenator Smoot to come forth, withthe boast that he has never takena vacation. No wonder he is quotedas saying that his life is very uninteresting. He has nevex. known theplasure of looking over the highlycolored summer resort bookies andrailroad folders. He knows nothingof sitting in a boat under the glareof a midsummer sun and cominghome with his entire face peelingloose and two small fish. There area lot of mountains sprawling aroundin his home State of Utah, but probably if he climbed one of them theSenator would call it work and denythat he was just out for the fun.The witness further confesses thathe never attends baseball games norplays golf, that he works sixteenhours a day and would rather raisethe tariff than attend the theatre.His only recreation is sleeping sevenhours each night.It takes all kinds of men to makea world, and no doubt there is rGomfor more such as this Spartan;given half a population of his kind,the other half could rest and playwithout stint, and still the world'swork would be done. It is a mistaketo idle away v one's time, SenatorSmoot declares, but the general verdict of his fellows .will be that it isan equally great mistake to be., sobound up in the business of banking,wool manufacturing and politicsasto find no time for or joji in what thepoet calls "living by the way as wejourney through life."L jiuupai i ib i muni rwn mniMif EveorthiniiTV VI' ft.' - JiA fwW i?iu8 3 lrnsTi M8 rji't ifrlrirMixfor QUALlnothing for showTHAT'S OUR IDEA hi makingCAMELS the Quality Cigarette.Why, just buy Camels and look at ilie package!It's the best packing science bas devised to keepcigarettes fresh and full flavored for your taste.Heavy paper outside secure foil wrapping insideand the revenue stamp over the end to seal the package and keep it air-tight'And note this!

Fightmaster, 316 Washingtonstreet, Newport, Ky. Mr. F.ightmaster, who was present, verified hiswife's statement in every; particular.She continued:"I had been in the hospital foreight weeks. I weighed only ninetyeight pounds and was so weak Icouldn't turn over in bed. I hadstomach trouble for years, andneither medicine or treatment did meany good. The first dose of Tanlachad to be given me like I was a baby,as I was too weak to lift a spoon tomy lips."The very first bottle stopped mystomach pains and nervous troublesand made me eat and sleep well. Isoon commenced to regain my lostweight and in a few weeks was backto my normal weight of one hundredand twenty pounds. It was trulywonderful. Ever since then I havetaken. a dose of Tanlac whenever Ifelt the slightest symptom of indigestion or of being run down, and itsoon set me right again. We areconvinced at our house that there isno medicine like Tanlac."oRURAL CARRIERS WILL BE PAH)TWICE A MONTHPleasing news for Kentucky ruralletter carriers to learn is that beginning July 1, they will be paid twicea month instead of monthly, instruction to that effect having been issued by Postmaster General Hays.This places the rural carriers on thesame basis as other postal employes,who have been paid bi-monthly. Itis announced also that rural carriers who are prevented after honesteffort from performing services ontheir routes by washouts and blizzards will not be penalized whenchange of regulations now in courseof preparation, are made effective.oGAMBLING AND BETTINGIn an Illinois town the presidentand cashier of a bank are accusedof embezling 400,000 and losing themoney in gambling transactions. Thestory is especially sad because thehead of the wrecked bank is the father of the cashier. If they areguilty they will ascribe their ruinto gambling, but it is difficult to seejust how humanity can be protectedfrom the lure in some form. . iAre the father and son accused ofbetting the bank's funds on hor3eraces? Are they accused of buying$2 and per cent, tickets in 'the mutuels? They are not. They are saidto have engaged, not in open betting,but in secret gambling. The risesand drops in the price of grain aresaid to have brought about the lossesof honor and money.Human nature is said to be unchangeable. One of its most frequentand conspicuous manifestations is toseek a scapegoat for its weaknesses.Assuming that these men are guilty,it is safe to say that they put theblame on grain speculation, whichaffords ample opportunity to winand lose large sums of money undercover. They will overlook and seekto have others overlook the weakness which led to excess in speculation. As between secret gambling andopen betting, there is a world of difference. The racetrack bettors standin line for all the world to see. Theybuy tickets in plain view and whenthey win, they cash their tickets inthe open. But just because bettingis open and above board, it must bethe object of an excited crusade,whereas secret speculation frequently leading to enormous defalcation, escapes the notice of the reformers. There is less danger in betting afew dollars on the horses than insecretely speculating in grain. Thereis less of hyporcisy in open betting.But forcing people to be hypocriticalin everything is the goal of reform.HER LIPS m,JOE B. SMITHJOE B.
