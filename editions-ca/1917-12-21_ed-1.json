THE WEATHER.
The weather man, evidently some
what ashamed of the way he has
treated the people, started a warm
wave on the road Wednesday, result
ing in higher temperature and a
general thaw. The fleecy covering
of snow that has mantled the earth
for over a week is in the language
of Mashimuri Togo, "fastly disap
pearing groundward." Streams of
melting snow from thawing roofs
and downspouts make the walking
on the pavements decidedly unpleas
ant. The melting snpw will do a great
deal of good to the growing wheat,
carrying down into the soil the
chemical elements needed for the
young growth.
The higher temperature has also
worked a great relief to the con
sumers of natural gas and other,
forms of fuel. The abnormal de
mand has now given way to, a more
equitable one, so that there is now
plenty of gas for all purposes.
