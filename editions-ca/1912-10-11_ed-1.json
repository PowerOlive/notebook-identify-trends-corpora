Rev. R. S. Sanders and Mr. A. T.
Moffett left Tuesday for Middlesboro
to attend the Synod of the Southern
Presbyterian church.
There is an ordinance in our city
laws which provides aga'inst the riding
of bicycles on the sidewalks. This is
becoming quite. a frequent practice on
North Main street and it is decidedly
dangerous especially to children.
Should this be reported to the authori
ties the offenders wuuld be subject to
a fine. There is no part of the side
walk on which cycling can be done
without creating an offense between
the bridge and M. M. I.
Our little city was stirred to its
depths Wednesday morning when the
news became generally knownthat Mr.
Alex S. Miller and Miss Ethel Victor
Johnson had gone to Lexington and
were quietly united in marriage by
Elder Mark Collie, of the First Christ
ian church, at his home in Fayette
Park.
The engagement of Miss Johnson to
Mr. Miller was announced several
weeks ago, the wedding .to take place
in the late autumn, but friends were
not much concerned inasmuch as they
believed that; the wedding would riot
be for several weeks. Preparations
went quietly on without even attract
ing the attention of the curious among
the ladies, and the secret was only di
vulged to a select few of their most in
timate friends.
The contracting parties belong to
two of the most prominent families of
this community and had a large circle
of friends in this and other States.
Miss Johnsonjjs the only daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. 0. M. Johnson .and is a
beautiful, highly cltured young lady,
a graduate of.the M. F. C., with many
accomplishments and admirable traits
of character. Mr. Miller j'b a promi
nent young business man, formerly of
the firm of Butler & Miller, dealers in
coal, lumber, etc, and now the junior
member of the Millersburg Coal and
Lumber Co. He is a son of Mr. and
Mrs. Jas. Miller and a direct descend
ant of John Miller, the founder of Mil
lersburg. He is quite a business man
and hasaa large number of friends in
business circles.
Mr. and Mrs. Miller begin life under
the most favorable circumstances,
each ,of them through their parents
being well endowed with the world's
goods. The wedding party was made
uo of Mr. and Mrs R. M. Johnson,
brother and sister of the bride, Mr. and
MrB. J. M. Caldwell, the latter of
Paris. After the ceremony the wed
ding yarty returned tothe'Phoenix Ho
tel, where they enjoyed ap elaborate

Paris is Assured ol Natural Gas.
The assurance of a natural gas sup
ply for Paris has been received by
. Mayor Hinton from Capt. John Ton
' kin, president of the Central Kentucky
i Natural Gas Co., who was a visitor in
Paris Wednesday.
According to Capt. Tonkin, the natu
ral gas mains extending from the
j Wayne countv fields will be laid to
: Pans next spring and that a natural
gas supply will be turned into Paris
next summer.
Capt. Tonkin is vastly interested in
the development of the Eastern Ken
tucky gas and coal fields and thinks
that piping the line to Paris would re-
I suit in a great profit to his company,
j The distance irom the line to this city
is not more than fourteen miles and to
i extend the mains to Paris would be a
! comparatively small undertaking.
It was first intended to becin the
work this fall but fearing cold weather
would hamper the progress of the line
it was thought best to abandon the
idea until next spring.
