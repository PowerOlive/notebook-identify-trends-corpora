FEAR DESTRUCTION OF CHURCH.
Further underground borings in the
vicinity of St. Paul's in London have
been suspended, owing to the condi
tion of the historic structure. It is
feared that the passage of trains
through the tunnels would have the
effect of causing the demolition of
the structure. The foundations have
been found to be seriously affected,
and the chief cause is the failure of
s'tone which was placed there by Sir
Christopher Wren, after the material
had already done centuries of service
in the previous structure. These
stones are now supporting consider
able weight, although they must have
been hewn many centuries ago. They
bear the unmistakable evidence of old
Roman workmanship.

ing members present: Councilmen
D. C. Parrish, W. O. Hinton, Harry
Baldwin, George D. Speakes, W. T.

Prof. William Yerkes was before
the .Council as President of the Board
of Trustees of the W. W. Massie Mem
orial Hospital. Mr. Yerkes reported
Mrs. Green Clay, of Mexico, Mo., and
asked the Council to accept the
the gift of $5,000 to the hospital, by
gift, which was done.
Mr. YerKes reported that the hos
pital trustees had elected Mr. W. O.
Hinton as Treasurer of the institu
tion and asked the Council to approve
the selection and fix a bond. The ap
appointment was ratified and Mr. Hin
ton's bond fixed at $5,000.
Mr. Yerkes asked the Council for an
'appropriation to help maintain the
hospital, and also stated that no pro
vision had been 'made for screening
the building, besides other items of
expense that necessarily would have to
be met.
Councilman Hinton stated that his
report as a member of the Finance
Committee included a levy for the
benefit of the hospital. Mr. Hinton
recommended however, that as the
Hospital Trustees had no ready money
on hand to meet pressing needs, that
the Council donate $1,500 for imme
diate use. The recommendation was
adopted and the money appropriated.

The Court of Appeals, by Chief
Justice Hobson, Friday, sustained the
mandamus granted the State Univer
sity against Henry M. Bosworth,
Auditor, to compel him to issue a
warrant for money appropriated by
the General Assembly, for the agri
cultural experiment station at Lexing
ton. A motion to dismiss the action,
made by Attorney General Garnett,
acting under the statute prohibiting
State institrutions from employing
special counsel, was overruled, the
court holding that in this case the
Attorney General was acting for the
Auditor, and refused to employ out
side counsel to bring the action on
behalf of the university.
The General Assembly appropriated
$50,000 annually to be paid quarterly
for the experiment station, but Audi
tor Bosworth refused to issue a warrant.
