1897Miners Convention Adjoarn UatU qchargday Without Taking a Vote Acceptanceof tho Operators Offer Doubtful vColumbus O Sept 9 -The interstate miners convention adjournedWednesday evening until Thursdaymorning without having taken a voteon the question of accepting ofejecting the proposed settlement bf thestrikeThe prospects for the acceptance ofthe settlement are somewhat doubtfulin fact a canvass of the situation showsa majority of the votes unless somechange should be brought about willbe cast against it The greater partof the afternoon session of theconvention was secret the delegateslistening to speeches from- NationalPresident Eatchford and State Presidents Farms of Ohio Knight of Indiana Carson of Illinois and Dolan ofPittsburgh All of the officials withthe exception of Mr Carson argued infavor of the acceptance of the Pittsburgh operators proposition Theytold the delegates very plainly that ifthe proposition was rejected the strikewould fail utterly that the contestcould not be continued as all resources had been exhausted Theyadvised- that inasmuch as thastrike had been precipitated rathe Pittsburgh district it wasvery proper that it should be settledthere President Carson of Illinoistold the delegates just as plainly whyhe could not support the propositionfor a settlement He said the Illinoisminers were practically ignored by itThe operators of his state had notifiedhim that they would not abide by anysettlement made with the Pittsburghoperators In many of the Hlinois districts moreover the miners hadsigned ironclad contracts which rununtil next May Should the Pittsburgh Ohio and Indiana miners resumeoperation the Illinois operators wouldbe compelled to open their mines alsoand the only recourse the miners of thestate would have would be a localstrike for which they were unpreparedThe best they could do would be to accept the operators terms and- thatwould eventually force a reductionagain in the other statesThe most important action of theconvention Wednesday was in determining the basis of representationSome of the delegates wanted a rulethat no delegate be allowed to castmore than six votes This if adopted it is claimed would havesettled the question of the acceptanceof the strike settlement very quickyIt was the sentiment of the conventionhowever that representation shouldbe fixed so that all miners should havea voice in the settlement Accordinglyit was decided that one vote should becast for every 100 miners representedThis makes the votes to be cast byeach state about as followsWestern Pennsylvania 230 Ohio 280West Virginia 110 Indiana GO Illinois 200The Hlinois vote which will be castagainst the acceptance of the operatorsproposition will about offset the tvoteof western PennsylvaniaPittsMrghdistrict The vote of Ohio isabutequally divided on the proposition alsothe West Virginia This practicallyleaves the balance of power in thehands of the Indiana delegates Shouldthey vote with Illinois which someof the delegates say they haveinstructions to do by inference ifnot by direct language the proposedsettlement will undoubtedly bedefeated The Indiana delegates saythey are instructed not to vote in favorof the operators proposition unless ageneral settlement will be effected byit In view of the position of theIllinois miners they do not see theirway clear to vote to accept the proposition It develops Wednesday nightthat the vote of the Pittsburgh districtwill not be unanimous in favor of accepting the settlement as some of thedelegates have stated openly theywould not vote for it The leaders ofthe miners were doing some quietmissionary work Wednesday nightCOL ISAAC W AVERYWell Known Georgian Falls From HisPorch and Receives Fatal InjuriesAtlanta Ga

deep that the smoking cars of thewestbound train went in on top olthree engines and two mail cars andbalanced there without turning overThe passengers in the smoking car escaped through the windows Thefrond end of this car wasenveloped in a volume of stiflingsmoke and steam belching up from thewreck below and the rear door wasjammed tight in the wreck of the carbehind The wreck caught fire fromthe engines The cars in the hole andthe smoking car burned to ashes in notime In climbing out of the smokingcar several men fell through therifts in the wreck below andit is impossible to tell whetherthey escaped or were burned todeath The west bound train carriedseven or eight coaches and its passengers included many excursionistswho had been to hear HonW J Bryanspeak at the county fair at BurlingameMr Bryan himself was on the trainbut was riding in the rear Pullmansome 400 feet from the cars which werewrecked He states that nothing buta heavy jolt was experienced by thepassengers in his coachMr Bryan was one of the noblestmen in the crowd of rescuers Hehelped to carry out the dead andwounded and gave the greatest attention to their care One poor fellowwho was badly maimed called to MrBryan and saidI went to hear you to day I am dying now and want to shake your handand say God bless you If you possibly can Mr Bryan get me a drink ofwaterMr Bryan went into the fast mailcar one end of which was burning andcame out with the drink of waterwhich he gave to the suffering passenger He brought out cushions for others of the injured and was everywhere present to minister to the wantsof the sufferingThe engineer of the westbound trainhad received orders to meet the fastmail at Emporia and w2s making uplost time These two are the fastesttrains in the Sante Fe system and thewestbound train must have been running at a speed of at least 40 miles anhour The westbound express was going around a slight curve and met thefast mail probably within 200 feetOf the seven or eight cars making upthe Mexico and California express onlythe mail baggage express and smoking cars were destroyed The coachfollowing the smoker was badly splinteredThere were not more than a dozenpassengers on the fast mail all in onecoach and while none of them wereseriously injured their shaking up wastexrible Every seat in the coach wastorn from the floor and many floorplanks came up with the seatsOne man John Sweeney was thrownoyer three seats and through a window but escaped with only scratchesand bruises The other cars of thefast mail train a baggage and an express were totally wreckedIt is stated that the wreck was caused by a miscarriage of oders from thetrainmaster At Emporia the oastbound fast mail train received ordersto pass the California express at Langseven miles east Another order wassent to Lang for the California expressto take the siding thereBut this order was not delivered andthe westbound train passed on thetrainmen expecting to pass the fastmail at EmporiaAt midnight it becomes apparentthat the earlier estimates of theber of dead were exaggerated and it isnow apparent that the number of deadwill not exceed ten or eleven Duringthe excitement early in the evening itwas reported that nearly all of the sixpostal clerks on the two trains werekilled or missing Two of the clerkswere killed All of the others saveone are more or less seriously injuredThe mail clerks who are hurt are WrF Jones R O McGee and Claud Holliday The latter may die as both hislegs are broken and he is otherwisebadly hurt Clerk E C Letcher escaped serious injuryThe dead were brought to EmporiaAt midnight a special train left Emporia bearing 17 of the injured to Topeka where they will be cared for inthe railroad hospitalMassachusetts Prohibition TicketBoston Sept

clothed in the brown duck ofthe miners common wear his pantaloons tucked into the tops of a pair ofhigh heavy boots laced across theinstep the soft felt hat pulled low overhis eyes more than anything else betraying his occupation in its splashesof candle grease But Dorothy knewher Rocky mountain world too well tothink of gauging the mans positionby the chance appearance of ihis clothesThat he was engaged in mining wasevident but he might be a tyro fromthe east out of luck and toiling fordaily wage or he might be the ownerof the richest property in all the district Whatever his present standingthere was that in the modulations ofhis voice in his niceties of speech whichtold of a sometime environment very remote from the rude life of the miningcamp That he was a gentleman appeared to her beyond question whileher womans instinct had been quick todecide that he was one to be trustedmoreover there was something abouthim that struck her as oddly fatmiliarWas he one of the boarders at the hotel and had she seen him there Thereseemed an assured friendliness abouthis manner which implied some measure of previous acquaintance Youwill show me the way she anxiouslyexclaimed flushing a little to be detected in intent study of his looks ashe glanced upCertainly But you will have to letme lift you on your horse Miss Meredith with your wrist you must nottry to help yourself at all he

her whipfrom the ground It is such a mercythat it is not the left wrist you canhold the rein al right he went onwith a gratulatory smile And theresanother silver lining to the cloudTheres an old shack

like this It will beraining cats and dogs within threeminutes If you will only let me getyou under shelter I wiil ride on myself to the Grubstake if you say so andlet your father know that you are

mans firstwords were of apology when springing to the ground he came back to seizeher horse by the bit and guide him upthe last few feet over an almost perpendicular mass of loose gray rockI would have gone round by the trailif I had known it was quite so roughbut were all right now he said turning to try the door of the rude hut towhich they had come The horseswere huddled together on a smallrhomboidal bit of ground formed at thetop of an old dump pile which wentcrumbling away in a sheer descent fardown among the trees some of whichhad been half buried in the lava likeflow At the left yawned the mouth ofa tunnel about which appeared no signof recent work while the rough slabdoor of the shanty was fastened by achain and padlock so rusted that theyseemed to have been exposed to thestorms of years By no means dauntedby this obstacle however the youngman coolly caught up a jagged piece ofrock and in a moment the staple wasbroken and the door thrown openIf you will just step inside while Irun the horses into the tunnel hehastily advised when he had lifted herto the ground Dorothy needed nosecond bidding but once within thedoor she paused peering about doubtfully It was

stranger smilingly observed as he came back carrying his hat filled with pine coneswhile he was further laden with anarmful of broken sticks And afirewill help the looks of things amazinglyTo say nothing of the comfort of itMiss Meredith rejoined her teeth chattering as she smiled How cold it hasgrownThat is the worst of this muchvaunted climate it has a capacity forinfinite variety When the

Can I do anythingto make you more comfortableI am doing beautifully thanksThere was a puzzled light in her eyesas she looked at him with a glance thatswiftly took note of his dark brownclose cropped hair showing a tendencyto curl at the ends which lay dampagainst his forehead the clear grayblue eyes the dark moustache and thesquare cut chin beneath It was astrong masterful face fine lookingrather than handsome There was intellectual force in the high foreheaduprightness in the frank glance whichhad a way of flashing in light of humorexquisitely contagious when he smiledIn that smile lay his strongest claim toreal beauty softening and brighteningthe whole face which expressed something of severity almost of sadness inrepose But even when he was graveit was a goodly face to look upon a faceto like and remember If in any partof the world she had ever met this manbefore Dorothy thought it would seemthat she could hardly fail to recognizehim now even under the partial disguise of his rough mining garb andyetI beg pardon you were about to saysomething he asked as with a littlecatch in her breath she looked awaymeeting his glanceIt was nothing only hesitatingwith a shy little smile

incredulously I thought yourvoice seemed familiar the moment Imet you to day but I did not half seeyour face that night and that it couldbe you of course such a tiling couldnot enter my mind She looked at himagain as though reduced to speechlessness for the wonder of it while helaughed amusedly saying nothing Ofcourse I guessed that you might befrom Colorado from your familiaritywith the building she presently wenton but to think of running across youhere of all placesAnd I fancied also that you mightbe from Colorado he rejoined looking up at her with pleased eyes Justas she had been keen to take account ofhis good looks a moment ago so washe missing no charm of the bronzebrown hair with its soft love lockspressed flat against her forehead whereher riding cap had btfien no curve of thedaintily rounded form so trimly dicplayed in the well fitting habit of thewildrose bloom of her face with itsgray eyes that now looked black in theshadows of the enticing lines of thesmall mouth where pride and passionseemed equally blended But unlikeher he would make no reservationsher beauty in his eyes was simply perfect And he could not say that he hadnot seen her face on the night of

Guideboard from Which SiGot Its NameThe guideboard which has stood atMoosehorn Corner Blanchard Mecountry crossroads for 60 years isfamous all over New England and isvisitedi and admired by hundreds oftourists every summer Tho idea oiusing the blades of moose antlers instead of boards for telling the publicthe names of and distances to near byplaces originated in the brain of TomPuffer the giant blacksmith of Piscataquis county who owned a shop atthe corner now called Moosehornthe center of four crossroads he putdown a stout post upon which hestrapped1 the antlers of two giganticmoose one above the other and placedat rightangles so half an antler pointeddown everv road The name of thtown and its distance were painted- upon the antler blades and for more thana quarter of a century the town oiBlanchard had the most valuable guideboard in the unionBlacksmith Puffer created his moosehorn guideboard 62 years ago this summer After his death the boys took liberties with it and finally succeeded inshooting the upper set of antlers awayThe lower set is in place to day Uponone blade painted in rude letters isthis inscription Munson 6 milesOn the opposite horn the reading isBlueberry Plains 2 miles Theantlers measure 72 inches from tip totip and the blades are eight incheswide Old residents say that the upperset which the boys used for a targetwas considerably larger with muchwider bladesSeventy five years ago when the region north of Dover was a wildernessPuffer went there and put up a blacksmith shop getting his trade from theoutgoing and incoming woods teamsWhen he was not busy in his shop hemade long trips in the woods Onespring when he was cruising on thenorth side of Bald mountain which iswest of Moosehead lake he came upona clearing that was thickly strewn withantlers of moose and caribou Theywere so plentiful that he said that hecould All a long rack with them withoutstarting up his cart He brought downseveral boat loads to Blanchard andcutthem up for handles for hunting kniveswhichhe forgedinhis shop Thewidestmoose antlers he saved hopinghe wouldbe able to sell them One set of moosehorns so tall that when set up on enda man couldr walk under the arch without touching it is believed to be thelargest pair ever worn upon earthCharles Dutton an aged resident whosaw them when Puffer was alive saysthey were fully eight feet from tip totip If his estimate is correct theywere larger than the horns of thelargest Irish elk that has been foundPuffer soon found that it was easierto find moose horn than it was to sellithem He was gettilngoldandrich

studyingtihe hands of certai nprominent English people her ultimateobject being to ascertain by means ofsuch study the causes of Great Britains greatness She has now returnedto Paris and has given a curious account of her experiences in EnglandTheaverage English hand she saysclearly denotes happiness All thesehands are firm and slighty red andthe fingers are square which is thetokenof punctuality good sense energyand activity Honesty is also denotedand this will not surprise those whoknow how upright Englishmen areThe English women have long thumbswhich is -a sign of strong will unlesscontrary lines in the hands modify thistendency Now all these qualitieswhich I have mentioned are good andthose who possess them are naturallyhappy and fortunate sFurthermore I examined nearly athousand hands among all classes orsociety courtiers as well as workingpeople and in all I found one verycharacteristic sign namely thement of unity of the Anglo Saxon raceThis sign is not to be found in Frenchhands According to al persons rankand social position in France will hisor her hand be By means of the handI can always in France distinguish tharistocrat from the plebeianIn English hands therearenotraceaof organic diseases In the thousandsiwhich I examined I f oundonly one caseof typhoid fever and in this instancerth e disease was contracted abroad Noone -who knows the progress of hygienein England can be surprised at this absence of disease Neither did I findin the hands of members of the Englishcourt any presages of accidents suchas I have found in French hands nor ofrevolution such as I have found at thetcourt of ItalyIn what respects the English handsvdiffer from the French and Italianhands I cannot yet say but I intend torerurn to England and to Italy and tostudy the subject thoroughly I willalso go to Germany and to Russia and Iexpect to make some curious discoveriesThe usefulness of such worlds manifest though at the same time it is certain that many of the casualities foreshadowed by the hands cannot as arule be avoided A person who isthreatened with a- violent blow on thehead will find it very difficult to escapeit Still by the use of will power andfby taking all necessary precautions itmay be avoided I have seen in thehands of many young women unquestionably indications of injury throughsome iron instrument andasallof themrode bicycles I

particular spot as it wasat least five miles from any habitationIt must be confessed -that -he was notover pleased He was unhappy andunhappiness is always- unreasonableso it seemed to him a distinct grievanceithat he should be compelled to listen toanything like frivolous gayety outthere on a lonely path which he hadsought jiist because it was lonelyIn another moment as ihe turned thebend of the road he came in sight of aJboyish figure stretched carelessly-under a tree by the wayside half leanting against its trunk half resting onhis elbow while he touched the stringsJn a light accompanimentShes a darling shes a queenShes the fairest one Ive seenhe sang gayly then suddenly stopped ashe saw Harding approach and half unonsciously as it seemed turned to thewheel that stood beside him This apparent inclination to mount and runuway changed quickty however andhe merely altered his position so thatJ he pedestrian no longer saw his faceKenneth smiled with a trace ofamusementPositively the boy is shy hethought a rare quality in boys nowadays Suits his face thoughHarding trudged on quickly forgetting the momentary interruption of thethoughts in which he was absorbedThat they were not pleasant thoughtswas evident from the stern hard expression on his sensitive face and themoody -misery in his gray eyesAt last wearied he flung himself unv der a tree and with hands claspedunder his head closed his eyes Heopened them soon however disturbedhy a faint sound opened them in timeto see the boy whom he had heard singing dart past on his wheel thetin slung satchelwise over his backAgain Harding smiled grimty Trulya sentimental youth he soliloquizeda modern troubadour awheel Justthe type too Blonde curly hair brightbrown eyes handsome face not

alaugh even more bitter Putting onehand in the breast pocket of his coathe drew out an envelope worn anddingy Slowly he extracted the contents a letter and a photograph Thelatter which represented a young manwith a fine strong face intellectualand attractive was his own picturehe allowed it to fall from his fingers ashe opened the letter and readDEAR KEN Try to forgive me I amvery unhappy butlpouldnothelp it IndeedT love you but you are so poor and I amafraid that we should both be miserableAnd Mr Brown is rich and mamma insistson my marrying him So I send yourpicture back I am to be married in StBartholemews next month Do forgiveme and wont you come to my weddingWhy should we not be friends just thesame Mr Brown does not know that wewere engaged Mamma said I had bettermot tell him Do write me Your lovingDORATheyoung mans face grew contemptuous as he read with a revulsion offeeling that startled himGood heavens he exclaimed whata fool I am to care to be made miserable by a weak bad woman capable ofwriting that Yes bad She would beperfectly willing to amuse herself bycontinuing to play at love with me afterher marriage True to no one neitherher husband nor to me This ends itINot another regret And no moreivoraen for meHe sprang to his feet and tore theletter into tiny fragments then strodeback the way he had come but with adifferent expression in his face Hisstep grew more elastic and he drewlor ft deep breaths as he felt that theshadow had passed he was freegainA day or two later Harding was passing over the same road He liked itsquiet the long reaches of -shadow wherethe trees almost met across it the tangled vines that claimbered and creptalong the rough fences A team wasrarely seen to disturb the stillness forit was the old road to Dorspringand although much more beautifulthan the new road was fully four mileslongerAs the young man approached thelend where he had seen the boy onhis previous walk he thought it wouldbe rather pleasant to hear again thegay voice of the yo ung troubadour ashe had named him But the only soundwas the unmusical mocking cawxiaw of a funereal crowWhen fairly past the- curve howt rever Harding espied the wheel leaningagainst the same tree as before andnear it lay the boy sound asleep therniandoiin beside him his sof tcap pulleddown as if to shade his eyes from anyrstray sunbeam that might find its wayUhrough the heavy leafageAlmost involuntarily Hardingstopped and a sudden impulse of mishief took possession of him Goingcloser to the sleeper close enough tonote the curve of the lips firm yetiweet aiid the blackness of the lahethat lay on the clear sun browned skinhe said to himself Yes he would be ajolly little comrade Pm certain sohere goes and he cautiously drew theinstrument toward him He could playrather well had been member of thecollege banjo and mandolin club andhe could sing more than well beingpossessed of a good tenor voice admirably trainedTwos on a summers eve whenroses bloom the words rang out onthe quiet air Instantly the boys eyesopened and flushing crimson frombrow to throat he sprang to his feetWhy who who are you he stammeredA fellow troubadour respondedHarding pleasantly I heard yousing a few days ago and caught afleeting glimpse of you to day Catching you asleep I took the liberty ofwaking you with your own song forthe selfish reason that I was lonely andthought you would perhaps give me afew moments of comradeship as atroubadour shouldThe flush had not quite left the boysface but he laughed responsively andsaid Very well Sir Knight I bidyou welcome But you must propitiatemy wrath at losing that delicious napby turning troubadour yourself orrather since you are one by givingme a prolonged exhibition of yourskillHe resumed his lounging attitude ashe spoke and Kenneth dropped into aplace near him It was the first time inmonths that the man had felt a moments gayety of mood and he gaveway to it freely Had his companionbeen a woman it would have been different Beserve would have taken theplace of spontaneity even had she possessed the power of evoking the moodwhich is to be doubted as Hardingshurt had not yet ceased to stingThe boy however proved to be asmerry a companion as Harding hadfancied With quick wit he adoptedthe young mans assumption ofmedievalism and used quaint phrasesin a serio comic way that amused hisnew acquaintance immenselyHe looked picturesque too as helounged under the tree which pleasedHardings artist eye His wheelingcostume although really simple enougha loosely fitting linen blouse of thenatural gray color tie of soft bluesilk knickers of a dark gray mix-vYHE BEGAN TO TRANSFER THE LITTLE SCENE TO ITS PAGESture hose of finely spun gray woolandlow shoes yet was oddly pretty onhimHarding took a sketchbook from hispocket and began to transfer the little scene to its pages But no soonerdid his companion see what he wTasdoing than he sprang to his feetwhirled his wheel into the road andwith a hasty Its awfully late and Imust rush Good by was off beforethe astonished Harding could utter aprotestA week passed before the youngarchitect again met his troubadour although he walked over the same roadalmost every day He was rather regretful The boy interested him withhis frank merriment and a certain unexpectedness and originality in moodand thoughtOne day however he heard thetinkle of the mandolin in a new spotand after some difficulty located itPushing through the underbrush hefollowed the faint sound until he coulddiscern dimly the form of the playerHe stopped for a moment to hear whatthe boy was plajing so lightly andsinging so softly It was the FaunsSong in Vagabondia and the youngmusician was evidently improvising anair for the dainty wordsHarding pushed hastily forward theboughs cracking loudly as he did soAt the sound the music ceased and theyoung man exclaimed reassuringlyDont stop little troubadour It isonly I and I have my mandolin tooThen as he came nearer said Wherehave you been I went up to town oneday and brought the mandolin backwith me and Ive brought it out everyday without finding youI heard I thought that you wentaway yesterday answered the boywith a curious embarrassmentYou speak of it as if that were thereason for your coming to day Notvery flattering I must say laughedthe man By the way I wish youwould tell me your name Mine is Kenneth Harding architect New Yorkvery much at your serviceMine is Frank Willard said theyouth after a moments pauseYou were improvising were younot Have you Vagabondia with youAh there it is

as nowhere else in the country are thousands-of acres of rich prolific land waitingf orthe plow and the homesteader Theprospect for the farmer and stock raiser is brighter there than it ever was oris

mistake iCleveland LeaderFRANK I FRAYNES FATAL SHOTAmerican Parallel to Recent FatalShooting on the Stagre in GermanyThe conviction of a German expertmarksman in a Berlin court of thecrime of pandering to the public lustfor excitement was the result of anaccident almost identical in every detail with a tragedy that occurred someyears ago in this country About sixweeks ago in a Berlin music hall amarksman attempted to shoot an applefrom the head of a young girl He hadfrequently accomplished the feat beforewith success But through some inaccuracy in aim the bullet instead ofpassing through the apple struck thewoman in the head and killed her instantly He was sentenced for this tosix months imprisonment There wasno charge of negligence or criminal intent So the charge that he had attempted to pander to the public lustfor excitement was invented to fit hiscaseThe victim of the American tragedywas Annie Von Behren and the manwho shot her was Frank I Frayne whowhen he retired from the stage hadmade a fortune through his expertnessa3 a marksman For many years he hadtraveled through the United States acting in a play called Si Slocum Itwas a rough-and-ready piece devisedchiefly to exhibit his skill in shootingand in the management of wild animals He carried a whole menagerieabout with him and this method ofexhibiting his talents had been adoptedafter an unsuccessful career as an actorHis wife Clara Butler who used tosing in his plays and act the partiofMrs Slocum was for a long time thewoman on whom his f eatsv of shootingwere tried One of the best knownof these was that in which standingwith his back to her he shot an applefrom her head and as in the story ofWilliam Tell this incident wras a crucialone in the play When his wife dieda young Brooklyn girl named AnnieVon Behren took her place in the company The apple shooting feat was successfully continued for three years Itwas done every night and frequentlytwice at the many matinees given inthe cheap theaters at which FrayneappearedToward the end of November 18S2the company reached a theater in Cincinnati known as the Coliseum Ithad been opened only two weeks whenSi Slocum was acted there OnThanksgiving day there were more than2000 persons at the theater at the extramatinee The play progressed to thescene in which the apple was to beshot from Mrs Slocums head Theapple was placed on the girls head andFrayne took aim and fired As theyheard the crack of the rifle the spectators saw Miss Von Behren fall to thestage with a spot of blood on her forehead The actor turned and seeing1 what had occurred ran to the spotwhere the girl lay and fell fainting bjher side The curtain dropped suddenly and the manager appeared beforethe curtain to announce that the playwould be broughtto an end immediatelySome of the audience had supposed thatthe scene was a part of the play Butit was soon whispered about that thegirl had been killed The holiday crowdin the street heard the report and before long several thousand people hadgathered in front of the building although nobody knew certainly of thetargedy insideThe girl died within a few minutesafter the bullet struck her over the lefteye Frayne who was frantic with excitement was locked up The applewas four inches above her head and ona hat and the accidental use of a defective cartridge was the cause of herdeath Frayne protested that therewas no danger in the backward shot asit had repeatedly been done withoutserious results The cbroners jury released him and he declared he wouldnever shoot again But after a brief retirement he returned to the stage andacted in his drama for nine years longer although he never repeated the backward shot with a woman and indeedabandoned the play in which the accident occurredIt is said of the German that he wasabout to marry the girl he killed andthe same story was told of Frayne andMiss Von Behren He died about sixyears ago and the shock he receivedwhen he killed the girl is said to haveimpaired his health seriouslyThe shot that killed Miss Von Behrenseems to have had a fatal effect on playsof this class Twenty years ago theywere highly popular and they continued so down to a very recent dateBut they have almost wholly disappeared from the stage now N Y SunFear in AnimalsBack in prehistoric times our ancestors probably knew fear as a constantfeeling They fought to defend theirlives and homes from one another Withthe beginning of agriculture and the domestication of animals fighting ceasedto be the chief object of existence gentler feelings had a chance to grow andfear was not so common a state of mindBut Ave are not in the condition of savage tribes We -do not live in fear ourselves and we understand that the animals we have domesticated must betreated with uniform kindness Thehorse is exceedingl nervous while cattle do not appear so nervous any dairyman will tell you that the utmost gentleness is necessary in caring for themWe can reason away most of our fearsneither the wild nor the domestic animals can do so much The one way toteach an animal to conquer fear is tolet him feel that he may trust us Itis the true and only way for it

notagainst you in particular It is all humanity who ride in elevators againstwhom his scorn is directed If youhappen to belong to that class of coursethe elevator boy is not to blame forthatHe is essentially suspicious He thinksthe whole world is in a conspiracyagainst him This is illustrated by astory told of a characteristically moroseelevator boy in one of the big downtown buildings He eyed every manwho got on his machine as ifto say Who told you youcould ride on this elevator Oneof the office holders in the buildingwho had been using the machine for ayear or more with constantly increasing trepidation finally concluded hewould get an expression from the elevator boy even if he were thrown downthe shaft for his temerity One dayhe said Will what would you do to aman if he would tell you his honestcandid opinion of youWithout the least hesitation in theworld the elevator boy said Id smashhim in themouth There isnt anotherman in the building who dares to address the czar of the lifting machineIt will be noticed that the class ofmanagers of the lifting machines arecalled elevator boys This is a- misnomer The geniuses who originalljpresided over the machines were boysbut so many accidents happened whenthe affairs were put into use that theboys were replaced by men who arestill out of courtesy called boysAs a rule the elevator boy has aneye for the aesthetic as well as the beautiful The Christmas season neverpasses that he does not decorate hismachine with mistletoe If a man asksMm what he means by devoting somuch time to embellish his lift he simply remarks Its the beginning of theholiday season and I like to call attention to the fact He is beginningto thaw out for the regular annua LChristmas and New Years tipsIt was during the Halloween season that an amusing incident happenedin one of the big buildings in the business end of town The elevator boywas one of those fellows who paid a3much attention to his hair and necktie as a club man There was not asingle young woman in the buildingthat he wasnt familiar enough writh toaddress by her first nameThe lower floor on this occasion wascrowded with anxious men who werefrowning and swearing because the elevator would not come down The upperfloor was likewise crowded with menwho were also breaking one of the commandments because the machine wouldnot move up The machine was suspended in midair The electric bellswere playing a sulphurous tune bothabove and below and dire threats weremade against the elevator boy Afteran interval of perhaps 15 minutes themachine glided swiftly down the chuteand came to a gentle halt The doorwas thrown back by the elevator boyand his face was cut by a grin whichextended from ear to ear A prettylittle miss stepped out her face coveredwith blushes and her hat
