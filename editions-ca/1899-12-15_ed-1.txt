scatteringtrees brought the three men to the closecolumns of the main forest and soonTom saw what appeared to be a confirmation of the mans story for in alittle opening- toward which they weredirecting- their steps he could distinguish the outlines of a hutThis is the place said t he guide athey reached the entrance Come inTom was right at his heels and followed him without hesitation It wasnow growing dark and at first he couldnot distinguish objects distinctly butgradually he became accustomed to thesemi light and saw a mans formstretched on the ground in one cornerof the interior while a deep groan canufrom the spotHank Bowers had altered his planssomewhat since first outlining them fora faint voice saidWho is it TurnerThere was no mistaking the voiceBoth Tom and the second mate recognized it instantly as belonging to t Inmate of the Seabird Tom steppedquickly to his side and bent over himsayingIts Tom Scott the man you robbedand nearly killedTorn ScottRider seemed to raise himself on hiselbow by a great effort and whisperedThank heaven Here Take the papers I stole I didnt hit you Jt wassome one else I did rob you thoughHere take them an sav a ver forgivemeWithout any suspicion of danger Tombent compassionately over the form ofthe recumbent man to take the paper-when he felt his pistol slip from his beltA hand had withdrawn it from behindIt was the hand of the guideTom straightened up and turnedsharply to find the muzzle of a revolverwithin an inch of his face while at thesame instant Hank Bowers appeared inthe doorway and covered the secondmate with a weapon saying sharplyHands up If yer move yer deadmeniIt is needless to that both Tomand Green did asthey were bid It wasmadness to attempt resistance for notonly was there something in the manstone that showed he was in earnest bua third reason presented itself in theshape of a weapon in the hand of Riderwhose face wore an expression of devilish triumph at seeing Toms pale faceWhat do you want of us demanded Green who was the first to find histongueWe want you was the prompt reoly Then we want the rest of thepa fry an we may as well take in therdust while were about it Turnertake them guns away from em ansee they haint got none out er sightThis was done and he addedHere Rider tie em up hand anfoot You ought ter be handy at malein knots that wont slip seein as yera sailorA rope which had evidently been prepared for the occasion was producedand cut into requisite lengths afterwhich Eider bound both prisoners securely and rolled them helpless intothe corner of the hut completing hiswork by tying pieces of blanket overtheir mouths in such a way that whilethey could breathe they could not givean alarm if so disposedAll this was accomplished muchquicker than it takes to tell it and inless than five miijutes from the timeTom and his friend crossed the threshold of the hut they were bound andhelpless prisoners while Hank Bowersand his two partners were congratulatingoutside at theing themselves on thecomplete success of their schemedark that they knewIt was now sothe party must camp for the nightThat search would beWhere it wasmade scon for the missing men wasand after a shortmore than probablethemselvesconcealedconsultation theyselves near the hut and waitedDeeper and deeper fell the shadowsuntil at length they were forced to theconclusion

comedown on us an hold the gang up withyer guns Ill git behind em an wevegot em thenGood whispered Bowers admiringly Thats a great schemeAnd it was When Turner appearedat the camp and told his story no onehad any suspicion that it was falseThe men were all familiar with Tomsstory and it did not seem unnaturalthat he should be charitable enough toremain by a dying man even though itwas an enemy The tents had beenpitched a cheerful fire built near byand Clara Avery was tripping lightlabout to prepare the evening mealwhile the men attended to the horsesand their precious burdensIf there had been any uneasiness inthe minds of Toms friends it wouldhave been dispelled when the strangersaid carelesslySay pards there aint room enoughin the shanty for four of us an if yerdont mind Ill jest stay here with yerter nightYoure welcome said Tarboxheartily Theres room in my tent unda spare blanket too Turn in withUS now and have some supperWhen the meal was over the men settled down by the fire Turner producedan old cherrywood pipe and lighted itwhile Tarbox threw on an armful ofsticks and made a cheerful blaze Thejj talked of mining and made no secret ofthe fact that they had struck a richspot and were returning with theirgold while Turner professed intensecuriosity to know the spot in order thathe might hasten there as soon as hewi relieved of his present care in theshape of the sick manWhen the pipes were empty he accepted Tarboxs offer and was soon apparently asleep an example which wasfollowed by all but Taylor who tookthe first watchHe was relieved by Tarbox who inturn aroused Avery but the nightpassed off without incident until dawnTarbox and Taylor were sound asleepin the tent with the stranger who nowraised himself quietly on his elbow andlistenedThe two men were breathing heavilyand mingled with their respirationscame the twittering of a bird outsideCarefully lifting- the edge of the tenthe peered outsideYes daylight was coming Firstcame a little motion of the air whichhad been still before Then from abush near by was heard the chirp ofa bird The outlines of the forest legan to be dist inguishable where massesbad beenIt was time to act First he rolled upthe tent flap to provide a retreat thenwith stealthy hand he removed theweapons from the belts of the sleepersand stole outside with themJust then a thin red streak appearedin the sky and Avery who had beenleaning against a tree near by cametoward him sayingYou are up earlyYes replied Turner Im goin tersee how the poor felier is gettin onBut Avery caught sight of the weapons in his hands and his suspicions wereat once arousedWhat are you doing with those revolvers he demanded stepping toward the other quickly and laying hishand on the butt of his own weaponBefore Turner had time to replyHank Bowers and Obed Rider sprangfrom behind a neighboring tree with aweapon in each hand The formershoutedHands upAvery obeyed instantly and Bider atonce disarmed himTurner sprang- to the tent occupiedby the capitalist and before the latterwas fairly awake he was disarmed andhelplessThe first shout had awakened Tarboxand Taylor but without weapons theycould make no resistance and in lessthan two minutes from the first sotfodthe four men were seated on theground their feet secured with a ropewhile Clara Avery was bundled unceremoniously into one of the tents androughly ordered to stay thereTo attempt to describe the feelings ofthe prisoners would be a hard taskThey were like men stunned Thewhole thing had been accomplished sosuddenly that they could hardly realizeit was not some fantastic dreamBowers and Turner wasted no timeAfter satisfying themselves that thefour men were securely fastened theybegan at once to pack the gold on threeof the horses In response to an orderfrom Bowers Obed Rider disappearedin the woods but soon returned withTom and the second mate their feethaving been released and the gagstaken from Iheir facesBidding Kider stand guard over theparty Bowers gave his whole attentionto his own work and in half an hourthe gold was strapped on the backs ofthree horses three more were saddledfor the robbers while the remaining Ipair was used to carry a supply of foodand a tentRealizing the uselessness of wordsour friends watched these preparations in dismay They well knew thatthe thieves could reach Dyea andtake a steamer before their crime wasknown for without horses pursuitwould be hopelessWhen he had packed all he desired tocarry Hank Bowers walked up to hisprisoners and sneeredYer had the fuist laff on me but itsmy turn now an I rather guess Ive gother best end of it heySeeing that theyecorned to reply hewent onWere off to Dyea By ther time yerI git thar well be some ways off on therwater I dont need all this grub anIll leave yer plenty ter last yer terDyea yerselves Thats fair aint itYer wont need eny guns This trail issafe enuff an theres no sech thing asholdups hereabout-Avery could restrain himself nolongerYou dirty thief he exclaimed Iwish I had put a bullet into your headthe night you sneaked into our caveI dare eav was the mocking- response as Bowers turned away butyer were too big a fool I wish yer allbetter luck next time yer strike it richCome on boys lets strike out for DyeaIm in a hurry to blow in some o thisdustThe three men mounted their stolenhorses without further delay and hurried away leading the animals onwhose backs were the fortunes of ourfriendsFive minutes later they had disappeared in the direction of Dyea and thedespoiled men were being freed byClara Avery and a sharp knifeTarboxs first act was to spring to hisfeet exclaimingStay here untiL I come back I wontbe longAs he spoke he dashed off in the samedirection taken by the robbers Half anhour later he returned with his faceworking strangelyI thought so he cried as the othersclustered about him It was all a bluffabout going to Dyea I smelt a rat assoon as that cuss told us It would betoo easy to trace them from there andthey know it They said it to get us togo to Dyea while they made tracks forDawson and went round the other wayto Seattle I saw them leave the trailand strike off to the rightWhere will they strike the trailagain asked Tom eagerlyTheyll come right back here as soonas we have had time to get out of theway was the confident reply Theymay think they can circle round us butI know this trail too well Thevll findthat out after awhile and then theyllcome back this way thinking weregone Itll take era all day to do allthis and I wouldnt be afraid to betthat they camp here to night At anyrate if they went to Dyea they wouldstick to the trail Youll find I amrightSuppose we stay right here askedTomStay hereYes Look here there are only threeof them Clara has got a revolver theydidnt know about Theres another inthe hut where they caught me I dontknow whether its loaded or not I sawit as we were coming out Why not7ipyL-- r WK L -iHands upihide here to day and if those men comeback and camp bere to night as Tarboxsays thejr will its a pity if we cantgive them a dose of their own medicineIm with you cried Tarbox Itsa famous plan They will never for aminute suspect such a thingCount me in too said Green andthe others were equally as eager whenthey understood the propositionTom made bis way at once to the hutand secured the revolver he had seenthere It was not loaded but he placedit in his belt hoping to find some cartridges at the camp to fit itWe might as- well have a bite toeat said the capitalist whose namewas Seymour 1 havent lost muchand I confess that I am hungry MissAvery do you suppose you could giveus a cup of coffeeThere were plenty of provisions lobehad and in spite of their misfortunesthey all ate a hearty breakfast and feltthe better for it When thej had finished Tarbox saidNow we must get out of sight andkeep a watch on the trail 1 have noidea theyll be along before late I hisafternoon but well take no chancesThis piece of woods runs 50 miles inthe direction theyre taking and theycant get through it Theyll give it upby noon and start back thinking we aregoneJoe Tarbox proved a true prophetHank Bowers and his companions spentthe forenoon trying to pass the woodand then the leader saidIt aint no use goin any farther thisway We might as well go back tertheir trail Them fools ha gone terDyea as fast as their feet kin take emter try an find us Come onHe wheeled hrs horse as he spoke andthe others followed his example Thesun was below the horizon when thetired animals once mope entered thetrackthey had left that morning andBowers hurried his along remarkingWe might as well git along- ter therold hut agin an camp ternight Itllsave ther bother of sticking out our tentan cuttin beds Stir up those crittersHalf an hour later they had reachedthe spot where they left their prisonersIt was deserted and Bowers chuckledwith satisfaction as he saidThink of emtrampin for all theyrewuth an we with all their stuffAs he spoke he dismounted andaddedWell hev ter lead these critters inter ther bush with us afc re we unpackem We must put all tt r dust in thehut with us I dont take no chancwWell stan a watch tooAfter some trouble the horses wereled to the hut the gold unloaded andplaced within Then Bowers threwhimself on the pile of boughs sayingCome on Turner lets warm oureyes Im too sleepy ter eat liideryou keep watch fer awhile an thenwake one o us upAlmost as he spoke he dropped asleepan example promptly followed by Turner while Rider sat by the door yawning Neither man had slept the nightbefore and soon his head began todroopTO BE

tissue ballots and thetangle in Nelson county over a typographical error in the certificate could-have been easily avoided Tha lawshould require the printing of all ballotsused in state and national elections to bedone by the public printer The secretary of state should certify to himalone the names to be placed on theballots and he should be held responsibleauder his bond for the correct executionof the work The ballots would then beOf uniform size the paper of uniformthickness and the chances of errorsredued to a minimum Under thepresent system the names of candidatesre err titled by the secretary of stateto one hundered and nineteen diflerentCJunty clerks presenting chances of atleast one hundered and nineteen errorsThese county clerks in many instances under a false idea of economyand with a desire to make as fine ashowing as posible before the fiscalcourt members of which frequentlyknow absolotly nothing about the valueof printing and could not recognize apiece of good work if thrust unde theirnoses hawk the printing of ballots tothe lowest bidder The loweRt bidderis not the best bidder The printer whounderestimates the value of good workis not capable of doing good work Theconsequence is the printing of the ballotsoften is in the hands of men who cannotdo justice to the job and the wonderis that more mistakes are not madeand more opportunities presented fordisfranchising the innocent voterThe ballots should be printed bypublic printer and charged up tothethecountvAnd next time let a cross be placedon both ends of the stencil so that thevoter who does not know his headfrom his heels but is yet a sovereigncitizen cannot stick the wrong on thebillot and kill his own voteElection Bets PaidD J Peed of this city has received hone hundred dollar check

and pulledthe lid downIt fell so heavily Allen was sure thegirls must have heard the noise forthey were in the other garret huntingrather aimlessly for they had growna little tired of the gameIn a few moments they heard Nancy call out that they were given upso they might as well discover themselvesOh dont I whispered Katy Weare so splendidly hid Let them huntiust a little bit longerBut presently

that when thelid fell he heard a sharp click thatought to have reminded him that thechest fastened with a spring lockHe was a sturdy ative boy and heput out all his strength to force thelid open but the Jock was made to protect the cortents of the chest and itwould have taken a much stronger person than Allen to have forced it operOh Allen what will we do whatwill we do cried Katy beginning tcunderstand that they were prisonerand terribly frightened at the thoughtWe must make all the noise possible Some one will be sure to heaius said Allen hopefullyThey called out as loudly as theycould

right thatchildren had disturbed in theirplay grumbling a little at the troublethey gaveThe scratching she took for a mousestill went on only it was growing fainter and fainter Jt seemed to come fromthe red cedar chest although itstopped entirely when Dilsey went toit which made her all the more confident that the mouse was there sincethey are always so quick to hear eventhe smallest soundThe

mouthclose to the keyhole was little Katyi faint pink in her cheeks alone robbingher of ail appearance of deathDilseys first act was to lift the windows she a few moments before hador t D so careful to lower Then she lifted Katy out of the red cedar che6t andlaid her on the floor where the nighwind could blow on herIt was far more difficult to drag Allenout of the chest that had nearly provedhis deathbed but love and fright gavethe old woman strength and Allen hadthe full benefit of the fresh life-revivingairThe color was deepening in Katyscheeks and Allen had sighed andstirred when Dilsey managed to beheard and had their mother called andhad also sent in hot haste for the nearest physicianYou happened to open the old cedarchest just in time Five minutes laterand the game of hide-and-seek wouldhave been fatal the doctor told DilseyAnd after that why Mrs Stewarthad spring locks abolished in the housas dangerous and Dilsey found thatshe had gotten rid of her great antipathy

moment completely lost his power ofspeech but finally informed the plainspoken lad- that this was the first timehe had been openly charged with holding a championship record as a modernAnanias He had no recollection of evertelling the gentleman anything thatcould be looked upon with the least suspicion of being apart from the truthand asked her husbands reason for making the libelous chargeMy

electrical storm After a verywarm da3 the sky late in the afternoon became suddenly dark Thecamels and men of the train couldhardly be distinguished in the gloomdark low lying clouds rolled up andtne wind and rain were so fierce thatlarge pebbles were lifted from theground and hurled to a distanceSheets and clouds of sand were dashedto and fro increasing the discomfortand danger of the cowering men andanimals The storm raged for twohours When it moderated a wonderful manifestation of atmospheric electricity began First there appearedat the end of the cross formed by thepommel of the camels saddles aluminous point of violet phosphorescence The end of a stick raised inthe air was surmounted by a flamelike that of burning alcohol Wherever the stick was moved the flamefollowed but when it was lowerednear to the ground the light becameweaker and presently died out Oneof the party repeated the experimentusing his sword instead of a stick anda longer and more brilliant flame followed the path made by the movingblade The woolen cloaks of theArabs were so surcharged that theslightest movement of their wearerscaused a crackling of sparks andsheets of blue light the shimmeringof which made a noise like that ofthe breaking of very thin glass Ifthe hand was passed over the garmentelectric shocks were felt of suchstrength as to be positively painfulespecially at the elbow joint

AmericanAgriculturistMULES FOR THE FARMTbey Are More Hardy Than HomehCan Do More Uork and Require Lesn CareAn exchange is asking its readers foranswers to the question which wouldbe the most profitable to the farmerduring a term of ten years a pair ofmules or a pair of mares which shouldproduce ten pairs and probably mightproduce and raise five or more pairs ofcolts in that time Something woulddepend upon the success in raising goodcelts and something upon whether theowner could so plan as to spare thework of his mares or make it verylight for about three months in a yearbut the suggestion of such a topic fordiscussion seems of itself a strong argument in favor of the mule team onthe farm If it requires the raising ofcolts to balance the account our eastern farmers who seldom breed theirmares if they have them and oftengreatly prefer geldings would findmules more profitable If there is noincrease from them they lose no timeon that account they are more hardythan the horse will last much longeras a mule 30 years did is more oftenseen than a horse of 15 and they canbe kept more cheaply We honestly believe a mule will do as much work asa horse every day at one half the expense for food and will be in as goodcondition after 20 years of labor as thehorse is after ten years if given equallygood care in other ways AmericanCultivatorToo Mneh Drone CombBees left to themselves are likely tobuild to much drone comb says theFarmers Voice This is not built forthe purpose by the bees as they buildit for storing honey in but if not filledthe queen will fill it next spring withdrone eggs and the hive will be overstocked with the idlers The way to prevent this is to use all foundation combworker size and then the queen will fillit with worker eggs and the colonywill be built up when hatching beginsin the spring If there is too muchdrone comb in the hive remove it andreplace with worker comb By doingthis the supply of drones is easily regulated the apiarist and the bees become more profitable than they wouldbe if left To their own devicesFeed Corn with JudgmentCorn shoud be fed with judgmentOld corn is better than new and thereis a loss in the

Command Good Pricesin the MarketThe time is at hand when the coltsdropped last spring will as a rule beweaned and as the latter day demandfor work horses lavs jjreat stress onweight the management of the coltsfrom now until grass comes again is ofthe highest importance because the desired weights cannot be made withoutfeed nor by allowing the colt to roughit through the winter as best it mayon frosted grass poor hay cornstalksand strawstaeks Given the start ofthe right kind of breeding and something more is wanted during the coltsfirst winter to produce a horse that willbring money on the market for if leftto shift for itself even the best bred coltwill in this way sustain an injury fromwhich no after care will enable it torecover The colt ought to be broughtup to weaning time with such trainingas to self feeding that it will mis themilk of the dam as little as possible Indeed to grow a colt as it should begrown the mothers milk is not sufficient for the colt longer than for thefirst three months of its life stipplementing the milk with meals or grainshould begin then or even earlier fothat by weaning time it will be aboutready to wean itself without any interruption of thrift After that feed grainpretty well up to the maximum of itspower to clean up and let it consistlargely of oats Good well bred hogsand cattle give the farmer a higherprice for his corn than he can obtain forit in any other way and there is no wayby which he can get a better price forhis oats than to feed it to a well breddraught colt There is something aboutoats that makes it fill the bill as a horsefeed as no other grain does and threeor four quarts a day is none too rmichduring the first winter and until theyoungster can go on grass in the springThere ought to be plenty of opportunityfor
