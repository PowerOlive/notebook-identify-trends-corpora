C rikI O Hospitals-
The questions of establishing and main
taining hospitals lor the use of sick or Injur
ed railroad men belonging io the J and O
system has been under disc ission for several
years by its officials And it would now seem
as a result of these deliberations- that the
time has arrived foi making practical test of
xne plan
Other great railroad lines have established
hospitals for the comfort and relief of their
sick or crippled employees and so faras the
Review is advised most beneficent results
have followed With emiil conditions and
under a wise and liberal policy so character
istic of the C and O management similar
good results -V ill bo accomplished here and
tiehospital system be made as popular as it
is on other lines
With a view to the early adoption of the
hospital system on the J and O Railway
Mr George W Stevens the general manager
of the company has selected a committee of
four trustworthy railroad men an nngiuer a
coudiPto f fireman and a brikemau and
urnlshed them with round trip passes to go
to st Luui and Moberly Mo to investigate
the hospital system on the Wabash and
Pacific railways Mr Charles A Craft of
Oliftou Forge who will leava on his mission
to day will represent the Brotherhood of Lo
comotive Bugineers and will be joined at
Huntington and Cincinnati by representa
tive from eacji of the othr bra dies of the
rain service named Dr Brock of Kicimoid
one or the companys surgeons will also ac
company the committee
The Review understands that besides a
minute inquiry into the matter by the com
mittee to uncertain ihe benefit- to be derived
from a institute of this character the Ches
apeake and Ohio railway company proposes
to erect and own the h sp tal buildings and
not to tax tneir employees for Their erection
as is done by some railways The C and O
company further we learn proposes to make
up any deficiency which may occur in main
taining their hospitals after collecting from
15 to c0 cents per mouth for all employees
who have worked a half a month or more
The Raview believes that the report of this
committee will be favorable to the adoption
of the hospital system ou the C and O rail
way Hues and it further believes that a large
of the employees of the road will
eartily approve the wholesome in novation
Gladys Inn admirably Ioc ited and cor
struoted need not remain idle loug after its
abandonment a few months hence as a hotel
It is just such a buildlngas is needed lor a
first class railway hospital and the R view is
iufsrmed it will be used for that purpose in
the event It shall be decided to adopt the hos
pital system
Of course there will brother hospital build
ings erected onepossibly at Huntington and
anotheratsome suitable point east of Clifton
