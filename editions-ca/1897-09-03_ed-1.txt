island in Martinez Campos time has just beenduplicated by Quintin BanderasThis negro war captain than whomno Cuban of the colored race exceptingMaceo perhaps has won greater honorsin the present struggle for independence led 12000 men from the easternend of the island where the patriots inarms are strongest to the we stern endwhere since Antonio Maceos deaththrough the treachery of his body physician Dr Zertucha the Cuban causehas not prospered so wellThese 12000 men represented allbranches of the Cuban -army serviceThey penetrated into the provincesof Matanzas Havana and Pinar delRio strengthening the existing forcesin each of those provinces to such anextent that the coming winter campaign there may be expected to be evenas disastrous for the Spanish arms asin the time of the redoubtable MaceoThe news of the brilliant achievement was brought to the Journal andAdvertiser by the mail from Havana inan autograph letter from Banderashimself In it he requests the publication of the proclamation that he issuedon taking charge of the departmentBanderas says that the second invasion of the west was made in compliance with plans that were completedby Maximo Gomez the general-in-chiefin June last and that the march waseffected with little or no trouble ormolestation from the Spanish troopsWe crossed their lines again andagain he says but there was nofight in them and we had no battlesOur men behaved nobly in the face ofconstantly possible attacks by largerforces There was no faltering at anytime and once more I have been ableto admire the heroism of our soldierswho have fought are fighting and willever fight I am convinced until theindependence of Cuba shall have beenattained they will fightThe proclamation intimates thatthere have been wholesale desertionsfrom the Spanish army in Havanaprovince into the Cuban service sayingIn taking command of this provinceI send greeting to all its forces butmore especially to the brave Spanishsoldiers of Pizarro cavalry regimentwhom I reviewed Sunday and thosewho filled with sympathy for an oppressed people fighting for their liberty have come over to our files inthis way giving most direct lie to thosewho say that the Spanish soldier existsonly to serve as food for the cannonand for the purpose of affording meansto their officers to get titles and decorationsThe rest of the proclamation is

ThatDay in Support of StrikersSt Louis Sept 1 It was 10 oclockTuesday when thecommittee on resolutions of the labor leaders conferencefiled into the hall and the delegateswere called to order to heai its reportThe platform as presented reads as followsThe fear of the watchful fathers of the republic has been justified The judiciary has become supreme We witness a political phenominon absolutely new in the history of theworld a republic prostrate at the feet of judgesappointed to administer its laws They acknowledge no superior on earth and their despotic deeds recall Miltons warning to hiscountrymen Who bids a man rule over himabove law may bid as well a savage beastUnder the cunning form of injunctionscourts have assumed to enact criminal lawsand after thus drawing to themselves the power of legislation have repealed the bill of rightsand for violation of those court made lawshave denied the accused the right of trial byjuryThe exercise of the commonest rights of freemen the right of assembly the right of freespeech the right of traveling the public highways have by legislation under the form ofinjunctions been made a crime and armedforces disperse as mobs people daring in company to exercise these rights At its last termthe supreme court of the United States decided that the Thirteenth amendment forbidding involuntary servitude is not violated byarresting a seaman imprisoning him until hisvessel is ready to leave port and then forciblyputting him on board to serve out the term ofhis contract a decision under which the oldfugitive slave laws may yet be revived andstriking laborers be seized and returned to theservice of their mastersHaving drawn to themselves all the powersof the federal government under congress andthe president may act only by judicial permission the federal judges have begun the subjugation of sovereign states so that unless acheck is soon put upon the progress of usurpation in a short time no government but absolute despotism of federal judges will exist anywhere over any portion of the United StatesThe pending strike of coal miners starved tofeebleness by their scant wages by arduousand dangerous toil the pending strike forthe right to be fed enough to make labor possible has been prolific of judicial usurpationshowing the willingness of judicial despots toresort to the most shameless defiance of decency as well as of law and humanity in orderto enable heartless avarice to drive its hungryserfs back to the mines to faint and die at theirdrudgery and there remains not one guaranteed right of American citizens the exercise ofwhich an injunction has not somewhere made acrime by these subversions of constitutionalliberty We have met to counsel together andhave come to the following conclusions thatWhereas the present strike of the coal miners has again demonstrated the fact that ourso called liberty is not freedom but is a stupendous sham under which millions are degenerating while hundreds of thousands menwomen and children are starving in hovelsand on the public highwaysWhereas this condition has become permanent for a large and ever increasing number ofour population as long as we permit a comparatively small class of legalized exploitersto monopolize the means of production and distribution for their private benefit a fact obvious in the case of minersWhereas Appeals to congress and to thecourts for relief are fruitless since the legislative as well as the executives judicial powers are under the control of the capitalisticclass so that it has come to pass in this freecountry that while cattle and swine have aright to the public highways Americans socalled free men have notWhereas Our capitalistic class as is againshown in the present strike is armed and hasnot only policemen marshals sheriffs and deputies but also a regular army and militia inorder to enforce government by injunctionsuppressing lawful assemblage free speechand the right to the public highway while onthe other hand the laboring men of the country are unarmed and defenseless contrary tothe words and spirit of the constitution of theUnited States therefore be itResolved No 1 That we hereby set apartFriday the 3rd day of September 1897 as aGood Friday for the cause of suffering laborin America and contribute the earnings of thatday to the support of our -struggling brothersthe miners and appeal to every union man andevery friend of labor throughout the country todo likewiseResolved 2 If the strike of the miners is notsettled by the 20th day of September 1897 andannouncement made to

Gulch an old trail turns-away from the more traveled countyroad leading through a rough mountain region to the scene of an abortivemining excitement now well nigh forgottenIt was in the spring of 1879 when thenewly discovered riches of Leadvillehad prepared a fortune hunting worldfor any marvel that somebody startedsi cry of carbonates in this quarterand from near and far came a hurryinghorde to view this latest land of promisewhile as if by magic a city of tents andframe shanties came into being in thedepths of the wilderness In the afteryears there came to be not a little disputing as to the real origin of this Silver City boom some believing that ithad been started by a couple of misguided tenderfeet of wholly honestintent whatever the mischief they inadvertently wrought while others claiming to be better informed held that itwas the work of a set of unprincipledpromoters among whom the name ofRandolph Meredith was alwaysmentioned with especial execrationHowever that might have been theboom was very real while it lasted andit lasted the longer that the spring waslate that year heavy falls of snow socovering the earth that few might guesswhat lay beneath The gambling spiritwas rife in the air and every one whocould call 1500 feet of that vauntedground his own was for the momentrich though nothing more tangible hadtouched his claim than the shiftingshadows of the location stakes Development work proceeded but feebly andfew had anything of real promise toshow but as though each had quaffedof some magic potion that gave himeyes to see but the fair illusion of thatfcr which he longed each clung withmad insistence to his dream of wealthscrambling fighting and in some instances even dying to hold to claimsfrom which the assayers fires wouldnever reveal so much as a trace of theprecious metalsAt length however there came a daywhen the snows had sunk downthrough the seepy soil and all the landlay bare to the probing of pick andpowder and after that the time was notlong ere a cursing company of adventurers went drifting back over theliills whence they came The sound ofthe builders hammers stopped shortwith the stilling of the dance hall music and before the sweet resinoussmells had been fairly lost from its newpine boards the embryo citywas left to desolation and decayBut while the rush and hurry wenton as though it would never stop abetter grade was discovered for itsheavily laden teams at a point whichleft the main highway a mile or morebeyond the original jjoint of turning sothat a bit of the way which had cometo ill repute for upsetting of stagesand kindred disasters came to besloughed off as it were and in acticallydisowned by the road which now appeared to have developed to a line 01travel of vast importance The gain insafety to be sure was somewhat offset by an added mile or more of distance so that the majority of thosewho came on horseback and all of thatvagabond company who toiled over thehills afoot still chose the older andshorter cut which was never altogetherabandoned until the Silver City roadwas left to degenerate to the Old Silvertrail by which name it came to beknown through all the after yearsAnd while inpatient footsteps hurried over the hills lured by the ignisfatuus of wealth never to be attainedand while in the heaviness of disappointment they toiled away againthere at one side of this unpromisingbit of old road a vein of gold lay waiting where every passing eye must fallupon its covering of sun baked earthwaiting and making no sign Foreons before Windy Gulch was or SilverCity had been conceived in the mindof man nature had hugged the precioussecret to her heart biding her timeMen groaning under burdens of poverty and woe and women whose heartswere like to break for the heaviness ofliving passed by the spot but the goldhad naught to do with pity its timewas not yet come Sometimes prosjectors discovered such signs in thesteep hillside that they paused to probethe earth here and there in futile effort but a rubus bush had spread itslithe arms over the little outcroppingof gray rock which might have toldthe story and none thought to look beneath Years passed away Autumnwinds swept bare the rubus bush winter storms beat upon the dull brocadeof lichen that had spread itself overthe sign writing on the rock over andover again the wooing Colorado sun-iilUUC tancu uiujiv jic wi wrich joy bolls in the bright springweather but now the Silver City excitement had been well nigh forgottenin other dreams and wakings andthe feet of man trod the old trailEarth held to her own with greedygladness and the gold waited on fulfilling the eternal plan of silenceBut one summer Harvey Neil wentwith a fishing party over beyond thespot where Silver City had been andcoming back a few adventurous spiritselected to spare the horses the teamsbeing heavily laden with camp equipage and the ill kept road full of heavygrades by walking over the now almost obliterated pathway whichf ormed a wavering hypothenuse acrossthe angle made by the junction of thetrail with the county road A fondness for flowers led the young man tostop to pluck one of the great creamyblossoms that lingered on the rubusbush and then idly beating with hisheel at the unnoticed rock below whilehe waited for his companions to overtake him he laid bare the secret whichhad been hidden from the beginning ofthe world A bit of the stone crumbledaway under his foot idly glancingdown his eyes were caught by theshimmer of free gold and the Mascotmine as he chose to call it was discoveredII arvey Neil was a type of adventurerby no means uncommon in the westHis father had been a large woolen manufacturer in Connecticut who hadfailed in business and died of heartfailure of a broken heart his widowalways contended just at the close ofthe boys college course It had alwaysbeen tacitly accepted in the family thatHarvey the only son should eventually devote himself to the mills as hisfather and his grandfather had donebefore him but now hampered by lackof both capital and experience thiscourse appeared scarcely practicablewhile his mother moreover evinced adeepTepugnance for the calling to whichshe charged his fathers untimely deathWhat with the mischievous tinkeringwith the tariff which was forever amenace to the business and the labortroubles to contribute endless turmoilshe would have her son look to someother field for the success which shecould not doubt must ultimately be hiswhichever way he turned And the ladfull of youths longing for adventurewas only too glad to leave the hackneyedpaths he had known all his life electingto go west and grow up with the countryIt was something of a shock to himto find the country rather more grownup and the opportunities for profitableadventure decidedly more meager thanhis dreams had pictured He had chosenColorado as his field of operations andin his eagerness to attain riches heturned naturally to mining where in afew brief months the little money hehad brought with him had gone in alluring ventures which returned him nothing beyond the experience he so surelyneeded but for which he was anythingbut grateful And now wholly unequipped by education or training forany labor open to him here knowingno more than a pampered child of anyprinciple of economy Harvey Neil experienced a few jears of very hard timesindeed The insurance on his fatherslife had placed his mother in comparative comfort but after the luxuries bywhich he had always seen her surrounded it seemed to the son so near to theborderland of poverty that not for theworld would he allow her to contribute another dollar to the undertakings in which he had come to feel himself fairly predestined to failure Hewould not even grieve her by telling ofthe ill luck which had pursued him andmore than one letter he wrote dilatingupon the glorious chances which thegreat west offered chances which he ledher to infer he held in his grasp whenhe had to wait for days merely to compass the purchase of a postage stamp tosend the letter To her if somewhatvague as to his doings he was alwaysgay and hopeful When he went towork as a harvest hand in the summersuch work as blistered his untriedhands and brought strange aches toevery bone in his body he only told herthat he had been invited to stay on aranch for awhile and amused her withhis droll accounts of the primitive waysof living affected by the natives to nomanners born and never was she allowed to know that he left the ranchlike a common tramp at last havingbeen cheated out of every dollar of thewages due him He sent her a merrydescription of sheep herding which hetried later as it would seem simply forthe fun of it while a few months afterthat when he had found a job shovelingcoal in one of the Denver smelters reduced to such living as must havewrung the mothers heart could shehave known the gentle lady was movedto innocent remonstrance for the wandering life he was leading She fearedhe Avas having too good a time shewrote sugar coating the pill of protestwith many a tender phrase she likedto know that he was enjoying himselfbut since his future depended so whollyupon himself his life could not well beall a holiday Was it not true shegently asked that he should put hisshoulder to the wheel and go to work inearnest His shouler to the wheelWell that the good lady could neverknow what tears blotted the admonitions it had cost her such pains ttopenBut he who labors as did Harvey Neilat this time unstintedly giving the bestthat is in him to honest effort thoughseemingly but to poor ends seldom failsin achieving gain far beyond the insignificant wage that slips through hispurse and while he writhing in therude environment

hetoiled the man in him was but developing to larger grander lines Hishorizon had broadened he had grownstronger in mind as well as in bodywhen finally promotion came and he began the upward climb of which each advancing step seemed more favored offortune than the last A chance encounter with one of the assayers of theestablishment to whom he happened tobe of some trifling service brought himinto congenial companionship and afriendliness of great use to him inmaterial ways He had taught himselfstenography to beguile the monotony ofhis time of sheep herding and nowthrough the assayers influence he wasgiven a position in the office whilethrough further favor of his friendwhom he was always glad to help inwork after hours he was enabled tostudy assaying for which an enthusiasm for chemistry in his college dayshad so well prepared him that beforethe year was out he found himself regularly engaged in that pursuit whichwas not only more congenial than officework but afforded better wagesAnd now for another year Iseil hadno thought of complaining though hisfortunes had come to a standstill Asystem rigid as that prevailing in thearmy regulated advance to the higheroffices in the business in which rarelyanything but death served as cause ofremoval and beyond the point theyoung man had now attained promotionwas necessarily slow After the hardtimes he had known however the comparative affluence of his present lotwas at first profoundly satisfying andhe asked no more but there came a daywhen the restless ambition of youthawoke again insistent impelling Thedaily round of unvarying duty grewwearisome in view of the fact that hecould look ahead to no definite advancehe longed for a wider field for the stimulus of nearer possibilities and asthough fate had caught the unutteredprayer it was about this time thathe went upon the vacation trip over theOld Silver trail and stumbled upon thediscovery of free goldNaturally he lest no time in beginning work upon his mine

changing its mind was rousedto such pitch of excitement that thehills about came to be staked out wifhclaims and riddled with prospect holesuntil it was all like an unkempt potters field while the papers made somuch of the unexpected strike that ColRandolph Meredith reading the accountof it in New York was moved to wirehis agent at Orodelphia to attend atonce to the long overdue assessmentUi yi

otherpossessions significantly known to himself as yellow dogsBut in mining perhaps more generally than in any other pursuit itu the unexpected that happens A fewfeet below the surface the Mascot

as sand the youngman was held in growing Tespect thecamp as a unit declaring that he deserved to play in better luck thanwas ever likely to be his share up thereby the old trailTo Neil it seemed simply inevitablethat he should go on with the work although with finances presently downto bedrock in the mining phrase hestruggled against heavy odds He hadfo far profited by lessons of adversityhowever that he was fertile in contrivance and when the last slice of baconhad gone into the frying pan and thelast stick of giant powder had plowedup the Mascot shaft to no end but toincrease its depth in no wise disheartened he betook himself to one ofIhe neighboring mines there to hammer a drill for day wages until a sufficient fund had been accumulated to renew the work upon his own claim Sofdr manymonths he alternated between the rough lot of the commonminer and what seemed the even harderexperiences of the mine owner untilthe numbing touch of despair had slowly settled upon his heart and he went ondully with the work more from forceof habit than firom any living hope inthe outcome And then as though fatehad tried his mettle far enough he ranintotf ree gold in such

and itbecame proverbial the facts hererecorded are but specimen pages fromthe book of his experienceWhen the Consolidated Canal company went into insolvency its assetsconsisted of a mortgaged right of waythrough the sagebrush and several completed but detached sections of a bigditchMr Brick Whalen the contractor onsection three had finished the heavywork there and was preparing to move-camp to section six when the companytvent broke It was in fact upon thevery day the suspension was posted thatWhalen having had his contract workinspected took the engineers certificate up to headquarters to get hischeck He received instead a statement-that the company was in temporary dif-Acuities and an assurance that it wouldsoon resumeWhalen had before this worked forshaky corporations he knew betterand lost no time in acting- on his knowledgeNo g ood howlin over a broken pipeor tryin to save the pieces he toldSlim self To his gang- of 20 men he saidBys the companys broke and so ami I cant

legendary backer This ditchingoutfit is the property of Martin of SanFrancisco and any man that meddleswith it will get the sheriff after himIll take one just the same saidShorty and tell Martin he can havehim again when my wages is paidabout fairA few others took the same view ofthe equities involved and took mulesto which Whalen made only a wordy resistance Most of the men were inducedto accept orders on the defunct company for the amount due them payable with large interest And if youdont get it very soon the interest willdouble your money said WhalenWhen the last man had gone Whalenwent out to the corral and counted themules Eorty one head that was apretty close call said heIt was late In the season to find another job of scraping but the mulescould not live on sagebrush and wereat once started for the railroad On asmall stream where camp was madeone night a band of trail sheep was alsocamped Whalen eyed them disdainfullyI see the beggars eat sage said heWhy certainly replied the sheepman thats the finest kind of feed forsheepI wish work mules would do that- -said Brick I never was so near asheep in my life he continued thesmell of em a mile away is enough forone Funny little fellows and they looksome like mules with ears and tails cutoff What do you do with themDouble our money on them everytwelve months was the replyNo extended description of sheepfarming would have impressed thefancy of the veteran mule skinner butdouble your money was his own familiar phrase for describing any hopeful venture and on that evening hesmoked many pipes of black plug overit A brute that can thrive on a brushdiet and doubleyourmoney every yearis an interesting creatureAt daybreak Whalen was in the sheepcamp- negotiating a trade of sheep formules on a basis of fifty to ene andprepared to accept much less Threedays later he sat in the door of theshack which had long done duty asniesshouse on suction three of the canalas many an evening before he had satwatching the mules come in from waterTo night there was never a mule insight Down the breeze came a pungentooor and a tinkling of little bells Overthe crest of an adjacent hill appearedthe flock browsing on

with brush he had commodioussheds and cross sections of poles divided the broad ditch into as many corris as he chosen The sheep were fatand carried heavy fleecesWhalen had for help two boys whohad wandered there and asked for workHe had proposed to hire one of thembut the boys protested that they hadnever been separated and that if theygot jobs at different ranches the otfcerbnewouldnt know where the other onewas p contingency which they couldnot abide So Whalen offered to takethe two at the price of one and on thatbasis they shared with him the shackherded the flock and cooked the grubThey soon knew as much or as ltleabout sheep as Brick himself and theproprietor found opportunity to breakthe monotony of camp life by occasionaltrips to the railroad and once to SanFranciscoIm going to see my friend Martinhe told the boys Now tend to business and dont let any get away Andthe boys gave their word that not oneshould escapeDuring Whalens absence in the cityhe went out of the sheep business evenmore abruptly than he went into it theprevious autumn The instruction tothe boys was fulfilled to the letter notany got awayIt happened on a hot day in Junewhen contrary to usual custom theboys brought the flock to camp and theshade of sheds at noontime It neverrains in that arid region but sometimes pours This was one of thosetimes Charged with ice and water agreat black cloud came drifting downthe wind and emptied out its load uponthe camp and the hillside above it Thecanal curving around its base formedan eave trough for the whole mountainand poured several thousand inches ofwater into Whalens improvised sheepsheds The flood very soon subsidedbut when the cloud had passed and thesun again shone forth there were noliving sheep Not many minutes arerequired to drown a rat in a holeMeanwhile the bojs greatly frightened by the sudden storm and with nothought for the safety of the flockwere in the shack The hail poundedand the wind shook it Water coveredthe floorPray Billy said the one on thebarrelNo you do it he answered from thetable topThe shack had no window and withthe door closed it was pretty dark inthere When Whalen reached home twohours later the floor was still wet andthe boys were yet roosting on table andbarrel but outside in the bright sunlight the ground appeared already almost dry A solitary goat stood uponthe shed roof he had been

the effort to over ornamentgowns undergarments and clothing ofwhatever kind or for whatever purposeIf this folly were committed by womenof wealth we might have the consolation of remembering that it furnishedmany needy persons with work andwhile we might deprecate the taste wec6uld approve the result However thisis not the ease as a most casual examination of the ready made goods of theshops will convince the most skepticalFor as a rule the more costly the goodsthe simpler and plainer the cut and theless elaborate the ornament Women ofwealth and refinement have long agodiscarded elaborate underwear withelaborate street gowns Even theirevening gowns are frequently characterized by a simplicity of cut and material which would hardly satisfy acountry girl who often scorns the simplicity of the lilies and aims to arrayherself in purple and fine linen on themost paltry occasions Too frequentlyshe takes as the models of fashion andelegance the showily dressed maids inwaiting behind the counters of fashionable city stores She would scorn ifshe is a good sensible girl as she usually is in other matters to copy her dressfrom thefemalemembers of a theatricaltroupe She would recognize there whatshe failed to recognize m the dress ofthe shop girl the incongruity betweenher own domestic life and the costumesintended to attract the plaudits of thecrowdThe refined women of elegant tastesare not much in evidence in the citystreets and elsewhere whence the country visitor is likely to copy the styleswhich shall be the envy of the remotehamlet in which she lives She isyoung and fair and it is natural sheshould desire to be daintily clothed andshould love picturesque effects Sheshould remember however that thestriking styles of dress she sees on thecity streets and in the stores as a ruleare hardly less theatrical than those shesees on the stage itself It has becomea part of the business of the Americantradesman to surround his store with atheatrical glamour of lofty frescoedceilings hardwood carving rich carpetsand hanging The shop girl is compelled by her business to array herselfhowever simple her tastes may be inshowy manner to suit the ensemble ofthe shop There are many refinedwomen in the showy crowds of the citystreets but they are so simply dressedin these public places that they passwithout notice from the lookeronThe trend of fashion is steadilytoward simplicity in dress Elegance indress depends more upon the artistictasteful grouping of harmonious colorsthe perfect fit and the fine materialthan upon the elaborate make Nothingis more deplorable than the hoursspent often long after midnight bywearied mothers stitching elaboratetucks and puffs in baby garments whichshould be made as plain as a simplekerchief All childrens slips and

the strangest sects in theUnited States whose existence was until recently practically almost unknown are the Hinkleyites who occupy a small settlement among Pennsylvanias hills a few miles from tlhe NewYork state line not far from the city ofBinghamton There strange as it mayseem in these hard times money is adrug on the market and yet the inhabitants are contented and happy Butit is doubtful though if all the moneyin the entire community were scrapedtogether it would foot up more thanten dollars at any timeThis peculiar settlement is known asHinkleys Corners It consists of a halfdozen houses a like number of barnsand other outbuildings and a framestructure used as a place of worship incold weather As long as the weatherwill permit the religious rites of thisstrange sect are held in the open airusually in a cave near the woodsThe history of this peculiar community is a strange one About 35 yearsago a man named Hinkley beganpreaching a crusade in the city of Pittsburgh He claimed that Christianityby disregarding the Mosaic laws hadviolated one of the principles uponwhich it was foundedHinkleys crusade was so much of asuccess many prominent persons following his standard that the policesuddenly put a stop to the sacrificesThe result of this threat was to causeHinkley and a few followers to emigrate to the mountains there to startthe peculiar settlement that exists today

Test of HistoryWe all want to consider the days ofchivalry as the golden days never tobe recalled for womankind This isby implication a rank injustice to ourown timeWith all its fine expressions of ardentdevotion to the fair sex and the multitude of its exquisite pretensions chivalry was the degradation of the highestand tenderest human instincts theveritable curse of the course of truelove Such a statement presents itfielfto the romantic believer as a terriblecounterblast but it is true nevertheless The records of the treasury andthe law courts of those dajs in furnishing the experience of popular lifedeeply marked by the worst shades ofmodern shortcomings provide the fullest proofChivalry did not make marriages atleast in the sense of those born of lovesyoung dream it entirely ignored allsexual affections and sold its victimswith ruthless indifference to all mutualityThere were not two parties to its bargains there was only one who was always the third of the group and theone interested not in satisfying theyearnings of the impassioned but in apecuniary sense of their value He wasthe vendor and might be either Icing orbaron But whichever he was he wasthe incarnation of unscrupulous powerThe matrimonial transactions of chivalry were mercenary To them therewere no contracting parties in theshape of whispering lovers ardentswains and coy maidens On the otherhand there was but sullen indifferenceor hating compliance Chivalry cantedabout its faith in women and the purityof its own motives because it could notsing of love it maj be said that it socanted because it knew it must cantIt knew that its marriage had notbeen made in Heaven and of etherealsentiment They were consequentlybargained for either in the kings exchequer or in the open market placeChivalry knew itself as a social falsityand the parent of lust As a consequence the lower orders have had togive us the nomenclature of our loveaffairs Chaucer the very mirror of theera of chivalry has typified lust withhis master hand but he has no pictureof the gratified tenderness of longingyouth In his surroundings it was notsuffered to exist These surroundingshad no terms to enumerate the ardentswains and coy maidens of rusticityBut if the aristocracy can produce noone instance of the coy maiden and therustic sweetheart remains to mock thedubious fiancee it has a wealth of thearts of diplomacy and an inexhaustiblelist of the terms of intrigue Chivalrygave expression to the word maitressewhich may have and had the funniestof meanings N Y HeraldWOMEN AS SCHOOL TEACHERSMembers of the

Englishauthority on poultry in commenting onreport of the Rhode Island experimentstation regarding the value of fowls toorchards says For many years I haveadvocated the introduction of poultryinto apple orchards maintaining thatthey do good service in two very distinct modes first by manuring theground and secondly by the destruction of insects and grubs that hibernate in the soilThe apple maggot appears to be extending in America attacking the favorHe Baldwin which is so well knownas being imported largely into thiscountry and rendering it entirely unfit for use but the spraying the treeswith Bordeaux mixture and Paris greenhas appeared to prevent all serious attacks of this insectIn the mature state this insect is afly which deposits its eggs in the pulpof the apple beneath the skin Theyoung maggots grow within the fruitwhich they render worthless and whenmature emerge from the apple and gointo the ground lying in the pupa statebeneath the surface soil among thegrass roots Samples of the earth sixinches square were taken and the number of maggots under the trees variedaccording to the size from 1600 to morethan 12000 under each tree the pupaesomewhat resembling kernels of wheatNow comes the point which was particularly interesting to me Thement was tried as to whether poultryif confined to a small range and encouraged to scratch would destroy thesepupae A large movable wire fence wasplaced about a tree whose fruit hadbeen destroyed by insects One side ofthe 1 ence was raised and fiO hens werecalled into the inclosure The fence walet down and they were confined to thespace around the tree As soon as theyhad eaten the corn they naturally began to scratch for pupae and in thecourse of three or four days it wasJound that the latter had disappearedAs these insects remain in the pupaestate from the fall of the apple to thefollowing spring when they appear itmay be expected that next year thenumber of flies breeding from the apple maggot will be greatly diminishedin the localities where this plan is followedFrom personal experience extendingover many years I can speak positivelyof the advantages of allowing fowls andchickens a free range in apple orchardsThey not only manure the soil and destroy all insects harboring in it butthey find for some weeks a considerable proportion of their own food thewindfalls which they devour greedilywith any grubs they may containFARM TOOL HOUSEEvery Vegetable and Fruit FarmerShould Have OneThe plan of a farm tool house as submitted herewith is planned for 14 or 15ty 30 feet but the proportions can be

beetle receivesits common name from the fact that itsnative home was at the eastern base ofthe Rocky mountains where it fed upon a species of -wild potatoes quite common to this negion known as the Sandbur Solanum rostratum It was collected there and described by ThomasSajr in 1824 It was iirst mentioned asan injurious insect in 1S59 when semeof the early settlers of western 2s ebraska reported it feeding in large numibers upon the Irish potato We thus-see that the species changed its foodjfrom a wild to a cultivated plant as hasJbeen the case with many of our injurlious insects Farmers

average country highways asthere existing broad smooth roadways splendidly surfaced with stonesuitable for heavy traffic in all kinds ofweather and generally lined on bothsides with tall stately trees shadingthe highway like a park driveway Hewould wonder at the money which hadbeen spent upon them With a solidstone roadway on wThich an ordinarywagon tire would make no impressionit is not to be wondered at that threeand four tons of produce should beloaded upon an ordinary farm wagonwhich is there built with tires four orsix inches wide A French load of hayapproaching our American farmerfrom a distance wTould bring to hismind a vision as of a moving hay stacksuch a great difference is there between the ordinary load of hay as there7 -1 vROAD NEAR NILES MICHTravel Over Such a Road Is AnythingBut Pleasanthauled to market and the load he isaccustomed to see among his AmericanneighborsContrast such a system of roads withthose of our county with which all ofus dwelling in a rural community areso familiar The law lays out a highway 66 feet wide but it is rare thatmore than 20 feet of -this ground areappropriated for highway purposesproper The highway such as it isis rough and uneven and the ordinarywagon passing over it travels throughan inch or two inches of dust in dryweather and through three or fourinches of bog very frequently after arain of no unusual severity This isthe road on the level Where a hill exists conditions are evien worse for theaction of rain and snow washes awaythe soil at the top of the hill leavingthe surface covered with the roughestof gravel and transforming the roadat the foot of the hill into what aftera shower is a veritable quagmireWhat wonder then that the averagewagon load as we see it in the UnitedStates is so entirely different a thingfrom that seen abroad Travel over aroad of this kind is necessarily slowwith any kind of a load and as the distance from the farm to the market iagreater by far than in France and Germany the farmer reduces the weight ofhis load that his team may make somerespectable progress without beingworn out during the first few miles ofthe trip Reducing his loads the farmers trips are multiplied in number andtne result of it is that it requires threeor four times as long to market his cropas would be consumed on EuropeanhighwaysThe movement for good roads is continually and rapidly growing Everythinking farmer who has become familiar with the publications of the department of agriculture becomes atonce an advocate of better highwaysand an advocate of better methods inbuilding them The American peoplehave brought their system of watertransportation to a high state of perfection and we are the possessors of a system of railroads which is unequaled bythat of any other nation in the worldIt now looks as if the American peoplewere seriously turning their attentionto the common country road and it issafe to assume that once the movementfor better highways is led along definitelines we shall before many years havea system of country roads equal in everyway to our water and railway transportation facilities Cleveland CyclingGazetteHINTS FOR DAIRYMENTaste decides the merit of

Relation Between Theni Discovered ly SpectroscopyA curious though at present unimportant discovery in regard to the relation between magnetism and light isiusi now puzzling many scientists Aforeign investigator named zeeman announced a few moniths ago that if onewere engaged in examining the vaporof certain metals sodium for instancewith a spectroscepe and if the beam oflight were made to pass between theboles of a strong magnet before entering the instrument a novel effect wouldbe observed The black cross linescharacteristic of the spectrum of thefaietal in question would be found tobe about twice as wide as they usuallyare whereas as soon as the influenceof the magnet ceased the lines wouldShrink to their natural breadth Sincethat time other experimenters have reported that the magnet seemed to reverse a line that is to say change itto a bright line if dark originally orinto a dark one if it was bright at firstTrof Albert A Michelson of theUniversity of Chicago has just madepublic some observations which probably describe the phenomenon more accurately than do the earlier reportsjlle finds that with cadmium sodiumand some other metals the line is notwidened but is doubled tine two members of the pair being separated for adistance which varies in proportion tothe strength of the magnet Sometimes this interval is thrice as broad asone of the lines but if the magneticfield is weak the lines will be closer together The blank space between themcomes where the single line was before so that one of the new images isdisplaced a little to the right and theother a little to the left The numberof substances examined thus far issmall It includes sodium cadmiumamd mercury This is hardly enough tojustify the statement that the duplication as a result of magnetic influenceon a beam of light before spectroscopicanalysis occurs with all the knownelements but it suggests the probability that such is the caseThe only other known influence ofmagnetism upon light is observediwhena ray that has been polarized by going through a certain kind of crystalfalls upon another crystal The second in one position will let the polarized ray pass through but if it beslowly twisted around just one quarterof a rotation the light cannot penetrate Now Faraday discovered nearly a century ago that if the polarizedbeam passed between the north andsouth poles of a magnet the secondcrystal would act peculiarly It wouldextinguish the light when in the rightposition to transmit an unmag netizedbeam and wrould transmit when in theright position to extinguish the sameThe key to this mysterjr is still missingA kindred problem is afforded by theresearches of Zeeman and MichelsonThey both suggest what Clerk Maxwell has tried to prove in other waysthat light is itself an electro magneticphenomenon N Y TribuneNEW METALLIC COMPOUNDHarder Than Diamonds and Will Revolutionize Many IndustriesWithin a few days the patent officewill grant title in a discovery whichmay fairly

making by artifice have obtained such widepublicity The uttmost secrecy hasbeen maintained in regard to thenatter but investigation reveals the factthat the substance in question is acarbide of

be used for the cutting of diamondsTitanium is one of the most interesting of the rare metals It is about halfas heavy as iron and like the latterit is white when perfectly pure Chemically it
