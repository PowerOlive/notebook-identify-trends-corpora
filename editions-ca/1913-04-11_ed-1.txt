The negrothrough his attorney, Mr. Wade Whitley, entered a yjlea of self , defense,which wasfsubstantiated by the evidence introduced at the examination.The killingjoccurred on the night ofOctober 27 last year, following an argument over a game of cards. It developed at the trial that a number ofnegroes were engaged in both card andcrap games in one of the shanties atthe camp, and Story, losing all of hismoney in one of thpgames becamevery abusive towafa Sturdevant. Itwas also broughtout at the trial thatStory blew oqthe lamp in the house.and flourishing his revolver in a reckless manner frightened the inmates,who fled from the building.When on the outside Story Tdrew hisrevolver and fired two shots in the direction of Sturdevant, who it appearedwas leaving the camp, when the latterreturned the fire, .emptying threechambers of his revolver. One bullettook effect in Story's head, inflicting awound from which he died at a Lexington hospital seeral days later.After hearing the! evidence JudgeDundon dismissed the warrant againstSturdevant. At the instance ofCounty Attorney George Batterton awarrant charging him with carryingconcealed weapons was issued. Thiswarrant was also dismissed by JudgeDundon, who held that the evidenceintroduced did not suuport . the chargeas none of the witnesses had seenSturdevant with a revolver in thehouse and failed to see him draw theweapon when he fired in defense of hislife.Sturdevant. who was emoloyed atthe camp of D. B. Lacy & Son, escaped after the killing, but returnedto Paris last week and was taken intocustody by Patrolman Fred Link.

Victor Hugo's storyof Jean Valjean in "Les Miserables"is duplicated in many of the circumstances surrounding an eighteen-year-oldColorado boy "who three years agoran away from the industrial schoolat Golden, worked himself into a goodposition and then, a year after he hadbeen married to a Des Moines, Iowa,girl, found his past rising behind him,relentless as Hugo's Inspector Javert.Six years ago Rosie E. Sheldon's father died at Glenwood Springs. Ayear later the boy was sent to the industrial school for boys at Golden asincorrigible. The intervening year themother had lost all control over himand it was at her request that he wastaken in charge by the state.The state made a poor job of reforming Sheldon. Its method of curinghigh spirits did not succeed, and Sheldon ran away. The first few times heran away he was caught and broughtback. Early in 1910 he managed toslip away and stay lost. The officerslooked for him a few weeks and thengave up the search, although they didnot forget.Sheldon went to Des Moines, Iowa,and there started out to do what thebig state of Colorado had not been jable to do. He started out to reformhimself. 1He got a job in the big Cownie glovefactory at $10 a week, commenced tosave his money and: to go to nightsschool. Before long his salary wasraised, and then pretty soon it wasraised again, and he was given a responsible" position.A little more than a year ago hemet and fell in love with the daughter of a Des Moines business man.The two were married and startedhousekeeping. Sheldon was so happythat he wrote to his mother fn Denver to tell her about his wife and thebaby had just come. He told her thenew name he had taken when hie ranaway from the reform school.The mother told some of her friends,Sheldon's younger brother, now in theschool, heard where his brother wasand through some of these sourcesSuperintendent Fred L. Paddleford oftthe industrial school board heard!where his runaway had gone.It was not long thereafter that Chiefof Detectives Johnson of Des Moinesarrested Sheldon and took him to jail.Sheldon told the story to the detective4and begged to be released?. Dispatches that carried the story did not statewhether the detective had ever heardof Jean Valjean and the good bishop,but it is in the role of tho bishop thatDetective Johnson figures from nowon.He promised the boy that althoughhe couldn't let him go be would takean appeal direct to the governor ofColorado) and asfe him to grant a pardon to the runaway boy who had madegood.Governor Shafoxth said that hewould act inthe case as- soon as itwas officially caHfid to Ms attentionand would take whatever action thefacts might warnsnt.Superintendent Fred L Paddlefordof the school declared that the boymust be returned' to th school "forthe sake of discipline.""The fact thai Sheldoni is marriedand apparently doing, all' right nowcarft be takem afr any eacuse,"" the superintendent said'. "The only way wehave to preserve order here1 and toprevent the boys running; away when--everthey gefe tired, of staying is tomake severe example efr them whenthey are caught:"If Sheldon were made anr exceptionthe chances are that ail' the boyswould plan, to run away and get mar-,ried."GIRL WEDS BRAVE RESCUER!

Cure ForBlindness.What id believed to be a remarkablecure for blindness by the use of Bheepglands has been discovered by a physician at a Philadelphia hospital. Atest case has been made of David Abberoth, who has regained his sight after having been pronounced to be hopelessly blind. The result is accreditedto dust developed from the juice of thethyroid glands takn from the throat ofa sheep.Diseases of the eye, due to hereditary causes, are not benefited by thejuice, but in all cases where the corneais inflamed, causing blindness, due tolack of nutrition of the eye, the physician says that an absolute cure canbe effected. In speaking of the newcure a specialist at the hospital says:"The action of the gland extract,which is administered in tablet form,is through the general nutrition of thebody. Blindness is due to the inflammation.of the cornea, or window of theeye, which is of nutritional origin, andprobably due to some deranged function of the ductless glands. The administaticn of the thyroid elands restores the normal nutrition and inflammation disappears, allowing thecornear to clear and the light to enter."Glove Protector.To ward off a hole in a kid glorewhere the fingernails cut through, fasten a small piece of kid of the samecolor to the seams on the inside ofthe finger and the glove will last forwveks.'A WIRED HOUSEIS STMf UP-TO-DATEIf Yon Want to Put ia WaterWorks in Your HouseOr Barn, or Bathroom Fixtures orFurnace, or Tin, Shingles or MetalRoofing, and all kinds of Tin Work,Guttering, Pipss, Filters, Water Tanks,Dipping Tanks, Sewerage Pipe andClay Flues.

Mo., has the fo'lowing editorially of the exDulsion ot the BlueGtass Leacue from organized base ballwhich indicated there is a profitablelesson to be found in the action of Secretary FarreU :' "Though we still hold to the opinionthat the Blue Grass League shouldhave beun given an apnortunity to reconsider its intentions, before an orderexcelling it was issued based on chargeof "violation of a rule, where there wasno violation, but only an announcedintention to violate.yet organized baseball is to be congratulated on the outcome of the trouble. It is just.'as wellthat the National Association and the(National Commission are nut lorcedto show down.' "The developments in the situationsof themselves argue in favor of moreconsideration for the Blue Grass thanwas given. Apparently there was anelement in that league that did not favor the stand taken toy its leaders instarting a suit to determine territorialrights, and had the proper overturesbeen made to this element it mighthave refused to endorse the action ofthe league officials. This is indicatedby the refusal of certain of the clubowners to favor a warlike attitude.Instead they brought about dissolutionof the league and then two of the mostimportant clubs, Maysville and Lexington, being free from alliance withthe disturbing element, made application for membership in the Ohio StateLeague, and being properly lucatedgeographically, were admittec, subjectto the approval of the Na ional Association. "There is food for reflection on thepart of the National Association in thecircumstances which brought aboutthe ruction in the Blue Grass. Herewas a league that comprised five cities-well able to support minor base ball.These five could not round out theircircuit because there was no sixth city"available outside the territorial limitsof another organization. By the addition of Covington a compact six clubcircuit could ne formed and Covingtonwas desirous of entering in that circuit. "But Covington, though in anotherState, lies within the five mile radiusover which August Herrmann is givensuzerainty under the rules of the National Agreement. Mr. Herrmanncould view with complacency the installation of an outlaw club in Covington, or even in Cincinnati, but he couldnot show such'philanthropic dispositionto an embarrassed minor league io organized base ball."The Blue Grass League took cognizance of the situation as it relatesto Jersey City, which, though withintheAfive mile radius of New York City,was expelled from territorial claimsby the major league clubs in the metropolis. The Blue Grass 'is a Kentucky organization and Covington is aKentucky city. Kentuckians are sometimes inclined to clannishness, andCovington held out an opening and awelcome to fellow Kentuckians. Anoutlander across the river in Ohio denied Kentuckians their own and tnerewas another Southern rebellion."The outcome is that three Kentucky cities that can and would support base ball are denied that privilege, while two cities which happen to Jbe so situated geographically thatthey can join a circuit in another stateare compelled to identify themselveswith a combination somewhat foreignto them in order to get in the game."Had the National Asociation, withthe counsel and co-operation of theNational'Commission., taken up thematter of districting minor territory,as was advocated two years ago andagain last year, this situation wouldnot exist. The minor league divisionsare made on a hit or miss plan withoutregaid to convenience as to railwayconnections or allowance Qtor naturalrivalry of cities. The 40-odd circuitsare the result of hap-hazard development. The result is unnecessary expenditure in the matter ofmileage andoften lack of interest because of citiesin a league being strangers to.Jeachother. No greater (constructive workcould be done by the authorities of organized base ball than that of readjusting these anachronisms. But organized base ball has been blind tothe condition. Instead, twhen there isa revolt againet such unnatural (conditions, it rushes it to play the tyrantwithout asking the whyfor of thegrievance."There is a lesson to be drawn fromthe Blue Grass case, but we doubt ifthe men who control the game arebroad enough to grasp it, that opinionbeing based on past performance."Loose Screws.Very often a screw hole gets boworn that the screw will not stay in.In such a case cut narrow strips ofcorn and fill the hole completely.
