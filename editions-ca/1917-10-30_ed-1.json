' fr. Emile P. Vimon, aged sixty-
kre, for many years a highly-re-
N-apected resfdent of Millersburg, died
tajULay at noon at the State Hospital,
-, "SjScington, -after a lingering ill-
imss. Mrj.if imbnt had been in fail-
iaM kealth for two years, and had
" yiZm? 4mder treatment at the State
TfiQapittl for over a year.
H was a son of tne late uoi. rnos.
ety, and especially to young men and
boys now in school. A large audi
ence was in attendance and consid
erable interest was manifested. Ad
dresses were made by Rev. J. D.
Redd, Col. C. M. Best, Elder C. 0.
Cossaboom, of Millersburg, and the
following from Paris: Messrs. M. P.
Collier, Henry Power and Mr. Wil
cox, of the. Y. M. C. A. Rev. A. S.
Venable, of the. Presbyterian church
presiding.
The addresses were all good and
strictly along the line of needed re
form. Col. Best pointed out how
many of his boys upon more than one
occasion had been decoyed into a
pool room on more than one Sunday
afternoon. He also paid his respects
l to the cigarette habit, and said is was
doing more to ruin nten than .the
whisky habit, especially now since
the nation was thoroughly aroused
on the liquor situation, Elder Csosa
boom, submitted a resolution, to be
presented to the City Council, at its
j next meeting, praying them to refuse
to grant lisense to the pool rooms
now in operation at the expiration of
their time, and also to refuse to
grant licenses to any that might ap
ply to operate the same. The reso
lution carried, and Elder Cossaboom,
with the official board of the four
evangelical churches, will ge before
the next Council meeting, on the
evening of November 7th. The reso
lution also embodies that a place -of
amusement will be provided by the
citizens of the town, which will
build up our young manhood', soci
ally, -morrally and religiously.
A motion was made, seconded and
carried that the chair appoint a com
mittee of five to wait upon the cigar
ette dealers, and ask them to discon
tinue their sale. The chair reserved
the appointment until later. Messrs.
Collier, Powers and Wilcox were
asked to address the meeting along
the line of Y.M. C. A. work. - It
now looks as though Millersburg is
soon to have a Y. M.. C. A. The
tfiree gentlemen of Paris pledged us
their .support and said they would
give us all the assistance and ..co
operation possible. However, no
definite action ' was 'taken by the
meeting. There will be other con
ferences with he Paris association,
after which .another meeting will be
called. The meeting was harmonious
throughout, and thus far everything
is moving nicely.
