GETTING THE MOST OUT

-which if correctly saved and applied
5s exceedingly valuable. Every hun
dred pounds of stable manure is worth
10 to 15 cents, every ton from $2.00
to $8.00. The liquid is more valuable
than the solid and should therefore
"be saved by the use of ample bed

when their only run of the game was
counted. Each player on the Paris
team seemed to be on his mettle, as
well as those of their opponents, and
during the entire contest not an er

A pass and stolen base in the

-jare muse oe iaKen to prevent neat
ing, leaching and waste of the urine.
Most of this loss is prevented when
-stock, such as cattle and mules, are
ted in sheds, the manure being tightly
compacted by the tramping of the
-stock, which excludes the air and pre
vents heating, the urine being saved
by abundant bedding, and the shelter
ed situation preventing leaching by
rains.
On account of sanitary considera
tions manure can not be allowed
thus to accumulate in the dairy barn,
in which case it should" be removed to
ta shed or covered pit to prevent loss.
It pays to provide such protection for
the cow manure, but if the dairymen
does not have ashed or pit the manure
should not be allowed to accumulate,
"but should be regularly hauled away
.and scattered.
One advantage of live stock farming
is that it furnishes a supply of ma
nure. The stock farmer keeps most of
liis farm in grass, hay, forage crops,
jand this means plenty food is kept
in the soil and the land is prevented
from washing. He carefuly saves
and applies the manure and his land
rows more productive each year.
5ood crops can not be grown with
out manuring the land in some way
either by commercial fertilizers,
jreen manure crops, stuble manure,
and for Kentucky farms stable ma
nure is by far the most profitable
means of fertilizing.
The writer in his own farm prac
tice has hauled and scattered many
hundreds of loads ofstable manure.
3fuch of this was placed on washed,
thin, gullied land, and on this land
to-day are growing rank sods of grass.
Kentucky farmers have in the past
failed sadly in making the most of
their stable manure. On thousands
of farms there fields that have been
croped for generations without the ap
plication of a single forkful of ma
nure. With proper attention given to
fertilization, with stable litter sup
plemented by the rational use of
ground limestone and ground phos
phate rock and with good rotation sys
tems the crop yield of the state could
be doubled in the next generation.
Undoubtedly our farmers will find
ihis work highly profitable. In a
Tccent address in Kentucky,, Dr.C. G.
l;opkins, of Illinois, said, "There is no
investment which an honest man can
at white Park Saturday afternoon,
anParis will meet the Chippewa In
dians, an excellent organization that is
touring the country and made up of
some of the very best ball players.
The Indians are carrying a head
liner with them in the person of
Pitcher Pennance, who is a big
league star, two years ago being
with the New York Americans. The
score of Sunday's game follows:

Fear Always a Handicap.
Fear never did any good to any
body. Even when cause for fear is
real, a man must not give up to it. If
pou can just bolster yourself upo the
point of nerve that will enable you to
master your fears, you will add 50
per cent, to your results and a like
percentage to the influence for good
rou can bring to your house.
Reason for It.
Grandma "In my day girls were
more modest and reserved than they
are now." May "That's because you
were taught that modesty and reserve
were more alluring to the men."
Judge.
Daily Reminder.
No matter how the other markets
fluctuate, good, old, common, every
day politeness is still quoted at tht
same figures. v
High Prices for Gruesome Relics.
' Gruesome relics were sold in a
Paris auction room the other day.
One was that of the petrified body of
a. Patagonian slain in battle several
thousand years ago. The price was
$1,640. Head of Indian cut off in bat
tle, $265; two books, one bound in the
3kin of a white woman, the other in
the skin of a negress, $100.
Explanationof Potlatch.
The word potlatch is a corruption
of an Indian word common among the
Pacific coast tribes, meaning fes
tival of gifts. At a patshatl (pot
latch) celebration the more personal
property an Indian gives away, blan
kets, ornaments, etc., the higher he
stands in the estimation of his neigh
bors, and the more he expects to re
ceive in return at the next potlatch.
The festival is also accompanied by
music, dancing and feasting.
Plays Favorites.
Opportunity knocks once at every
man's door, and even follows some
men out to the ball park.
OVER THIRTY BLOCKS
IN HOT SPRINGS BURN
More than thirty blocks on the east
ern edge of the business section of
Hot Springs, Ark., had been swept
clean Friday night by a fire which at
9 o'clock threatened to eat its way
towards Central Avenue, the main
business street. A high wind was
blowing and the Hot Springs and the
Little Rock fire 'departments had
made but little headway in checking
the flames.

Life's True Heroes.
Wordsworth characterizes the "lit

kindness and of love" as the "best

real heroism of life is to do its little
duties promptly and faithfully.
Dog Had Appetite for Chlcktn.
A chicken-stealing do, in th Ih
btrton (Scotland) district, recently oc
casioned some anxiety to a number of
hen keepers. On a thorough search
being made a number of fowls were
recovered buried in a field. Some
fowls were eaten, and those not re
quired for immediate use were hidden
It was discovered that the cause of
the trouble was a large black Labra

district at will for several weeks.

AN OLD
GENTLEMAN WHO
HID HIS MONEY
OVER THE CLOCK
NEARLY LOST
$000J
After an intelligent old gentleman at the age of 76 dropped dead in his
home, his son found over TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS in PAPER MONEY
over the old clock which stood on the wooden mantel, surrounding an open
crackling fire. Not even HIS OWN WIFE knew that much monev was thrp
The old gentleman was simply CARELESS. His son had married the town
banker's daughter, and the bank was trusted. Both the old gentleman's
MONEY and LIFE were in danger; for burglars have a way of LEARNING
where money is hidden, and FIRE at any time might have burned the house.
