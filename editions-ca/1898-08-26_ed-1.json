THE FATAL UNLF OEM
COLONEL SEXTON TELLS HOW IT
CHANGED HIS LIFE
Tho Girl Who Would Have Married
Didnt Like the Idea of Younjr Fellows
In Officers Clothes She Relented a tit
tle When Her Admirer Was Wounded
The only bad feature of this thing
of addressing the school children said
Colonel James A Sexton the former
postmaster is the fact that they al
ways want me to wear my regimentals
Its a thing I havent the courage to do
except when Im among a uniformed
body of men
JMy aversion to wearing a uniform
about iii public dates from my boyhood
days Upon that aversion is based an
early incident that may have had a
good deal to do with the course of my
subsequent life
I enlisted as a private at the outbreak
of the war being then a boy of 17
rather mature looking however for
those years Like all boys of that age
I was of a romantic turn but exceed
ingly bashful in the presence of women
The one woman in whose presence I was
especially shy was a dear girl whom I
used to see home from prayer meeting
No parting in all that time of part
ing was more affecting than was ours
when my regiment started for the front
When a year later I was sent back to
Chicago to recover from a wound in the
jaw I found myself as dear to her as
ever and she as dear to me it goes
without saying I was in the hospital
at Camp Douglas My wound healed
rapidly I was allowed to go about the
ity very much as I chose and prayer
meetings with their escort privileges
laiined a great part of my attention
About that time the Y M C A
was organizing a regiment to bo com
posed exclusively of men who professed
religion The scheme naturally attract
ed a great deal of attention The papers
were full of it I was selected to cap
tain one of the new regiments compa
nies Protest against tho selection was
made on account of my age then just
18 The matter was carried up to the
adjutant general of the state who final
ly decided in my favor My age the
singular character of the case and tho
popularity of the regiment caused such
an amount of newspaper gossip that it
seemed as though everybody must have
heard of the matter at least All this
time I never wore my uniform outside
of camp The dear girl therefore nev
er saw me except in citizeus clothes
Its an outrage she said just after
we met a very youthful looking man in J
bantams uniform on one of our walks
that such voung men are trusted with rites
the responsibilities of command I dont
know what the country is coming to
For a moment I was overcome by
the shock When I recovered my breath
I told her that youth did not necessarily
debar a man from possession of the
qualities of a commander She declined
to be convinced and the conversation
became decidedly chilly Instead of
making my customary call when we
reached her house I stopped at the front
gate
Laura I said I must tell you
goodby My regiment has orders to
leave for the front tomorrow It may
be that we never shall see each other
again
But we did All fashionable Chicago
came to Camp Douglas the next day to
see the final dress parade of the much
s talked of Y M C A regiment and I
juiuu aeo mo uuui gut ULuuuy me uiuwu
My new captains uniform gave me a
good deal of satisfaction just at that
time I can tell you The colonel of the
regiment had asked me on acoount of
the power of my voice to act as adju
tant for the occasion That furnished
additional gratification The parade had
the magnificent splendor that only a
dress parade can have and the solemnity
of this occasion was vastly increased by
the reflection not to be dismissed that
many of those among regiment and spec
tators were seeing each other for the
last time on earth The band plaved as
though speaking our last farewell to
our friends Every one I am sure was
deeply impressed It was at tiis time
that the dear girl had her first and last
view of me in my captains uniform
Officers to the front and center 1
March I ordered with all the dignity
L could assume As they reached the
center they saluted me
Sir the parade is formed I said
saluting the colonel
The colonel returned as grave a sa
lute as he had received and put the reg
iment through the manual of arms
Meantime I marched a few paces be
hind him turned squarely and took po
sition almost within arms length of
the dear girl There I stood at parade
rest with my back to her until the
regiment wheeled into column to march
off the field At that juncture I took
command of my company and went
with it aboard an Illinois Central train
Between the dear girl and myself there
passed no word
A few months passed and I received
a slight wound The circumstance was
mentioned in the Chioago papers Then
for the first time after my departure
from Chicago the dear girl wrote me a
letter It was a beautiful epistle full
of regret for our misunderstanding
hopes that my wound would not prove
serious assurances that she never could
have doubted my ability and requests
for forgiveness for her mistake I an
swered it and harmony was restored
At the close of the war I at once
sought her the colonel added and
found her already married Chicago
Times Herald
Sheep In New South Wales
In the year 1788 there were only 29
head of sheep in New South Wales but
at the beginning of this century the
number had increased to 2000000 and
now the stook has reached 60000000
Australia New Zealand and Tasmania
together possess about 130000000
sheep which is more than four tirnei
the number in the whole of Europe
THE WOODPECKER
Four Characteristics of the tittle Drnm
juer of the Woods
There is an article hy Frank SI
Chapman in St Nicholas on The
Little Drummer of the Woods giving
much curious information concerning
the woodpecker Mr Chapman says
If we had woodpecker in our hands
we should see in the beginning that its
bill is not slightly hooked with the
upper mandible turned down at its end
and overlapping the under mandible as
in tho crow aud other birds that pick
up a living but that both mandibles
are of equal length and cut squarely
off at the tip It is thereforey like a
wedge or chisel
Perhaps the tip of the birds tongue
will be seen appearing through its near
ly closed mandibles and our attention
is at once attracted by its peculiar
shape We discover that it is remark
ably long and when fully extended
reaches almost if not quite an inch be
yond the point of the bill It is not
flat likq the crows but round and
fleshy and has a sharp horny point
which by looking at it very closely we
see has a series of barbs on both sides
In the meantime our hands have
doubtless been pricked by the birds
tail feathers each feather being stiff
bristly and pointed at the end Some
of the larger woodpeckers the pileated
and ivorybill for instance have this
singular kind of tail feather highly de
veloped The main stem or shaft of the
feather is much larger than usual and
each barb growing from this shaft is
curved downward and inward and is
strong and pointed Comparing this
feather with the flat tail feather of a
crow we see at once how different it is
in form
The wings do not impress us as in
any way unusual They are neither
very long nor very short but the ar
rangement of tho toes is so peculiar
that they were at once commented upon
by a blind girl to whom I had handed
a specimen of one of these birds In
stead of the disposition common to most
birds three toes diiected forward and
one backward we discover two front
toes and two hind ones and we will
note also that each toe is armed with a
strong curved nail
INVASION OF WASHINGTON
Admiral Cocklrarna Eih Soldiers Loot
ed aud Fired the Public Buildings
The last glimmer of twilight was
fading away when after the battle at
Bladensbnrg two miles distant from
Washington into the -well nigh desert
ed city rode the redoubtable Cockburn
at the head of his band of marauders
Clifford Howard in The Ladies
Home Journal of the invasion and burn
ing of our national capital by the Brit
ish forces under Admiral Cockburn in
August 1814 Elated at their decisive
victory over a force nearly twice as
large as their own and thirsting for
spoils the red coated soldiers marched
triumphantly toward the capitol Dis
charging their firearms at the windows
-the soldiers-burst-in- thjg dporsnd with
a shout of triumph carried their leader
to the speakers chair from which with
mock gravity he put the question
Shall this harbor of the Yankee democ
racy be burned A yell of affirmation
rang through the hall and without fur
ther preliminaries papers and other
combustibles were piled under the desks
and set on fire In a few minutes this
noble edifice that had been in course of
construction more than 20 years and
containing the library of congress and
vast quantities of official documents of
great historical value wras destroyed
Now thoroughly aroused to their
work of plunder a howling crowd of
the desperate marauders hurried to the
White House in tho hope perchance of
capturing the president and his wife
Finding the house locked and deserted
they battered down the doors and con
soling themselves for the loss of their
distinguished captives by a ruthless de
struction of the furniture they raided
the larder and regaled themselves with
a hastily prepared feast in the state
dining room Then destroying the re
maining provisions and breaking and
mutilating whatever they could readily
lay their hands on they concluded their
visit by setting fire to the home of the
president Numerous other public aud
private buildings were also destroyed
by fire

A Carpet Knight
The following curious definitions of a
carpet knight were recently given in an
English examination One who re
ceived his knighting upon the field of
the cloth of gold a knight who stood
on a carpet and had another thrown
over him while being knighted the
common black beetle which when
squashed resembles all the different
shades of abrussels carpet a knight
which sleeps on a carpet a man
like for instance Sir X Co who is
one of the best carpet makers aud be
cause he did make them so well he was
make a knight
A shot was said to go off because
the sudden shock in a Eort of Msay
frightens the bullet And it was de
clared that a dog turns around several
times before settling down to sleep to
make suie he is not sitting on any un
pleasant object such as a black beetle

A Good Guess of Iong Ago
During the American Revolution an
English magazine published an estimate
of the North American colonies Plac
ing the population then at 2000000
and assuming that it would double it
self every 25 years the writer estimated
that in the year 1890 the number would
have increased to 64000000 This may
be taken as a most remarkable prophecy
inasmuch as the census of 1890 fixes
the total population at 62622250
