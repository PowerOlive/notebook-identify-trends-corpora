How to
Cure Catarrh
Poland China
FOR SALE
4i A -v
THE BOURBON NEWS TUESDAY OCTOBER 5 1897
Every sufferer from Catarrh should
know that it is impossible to cure the
disease with sprays washes inhala
tions etc which are universally used
In fact the experience of growing
worse all the while is proof that the
treatment is all wrong Many
who have been under treatment for
years and met with disappointment in
stead of benefit are willing to doubt
that there is any cure for Catarrh
The trouble is that all of the treat
ment they have received has been mis
directed and has not touched their
trouble Catarrh is a stubborn deep
seated blood disease and everybody
should know that to simply treat the
surface that is the local irritation
does not reach the disease A blood
remedy is needed but it must be a good
one a remedy which goes down to the
very bottom of the trouble and forces it
out SSS Swifts Specific is the only
one which can have the slightest effect
upon Catarrh for it is the only one which
goes to the seat of the disease and per
manently gets rid of it This is the only
reasonable way to treat Catarrh
Mr B P McAllister of Harrodsburg
Ky had Catarrh for years He writes
I could see no improvement what
ever though I was constantly treated
with sprays and washes and different
inhaling remedies in fact I could feel
that each winter I was worse than the
year previous
Finally it was brought to my notice
that Catarrh was a blood disease and
after thinking over the matter I saw it
was unreasonable to expect to be cured
by remedies which only reached the
surface I then decided to try S S S
and the results were gratifying for
after a few bottles were used I noticed
a perceptible improvement Continu
ing to take the remedy the disease was
forced out of my system and a com
plete and permanent cure was the
result I advise all who have this
dreadful disease to abandon their local
treatment which has never done them
any good and take SSS Swifts Spe
cific a remedy which can reach the
disease and cure it
To continue the wrong treatment for
Catarrh is to continue to suffer Swifts
Specific never fails to cure even
the most aggravated cases It is a
real blood remedy and cures Catarrh
Rheumatism Contagious Blood Poison
Eczema Cancer Scrofula and all other
blood diseases S S S is guaranteed

A RIGHT ROYAL ROBE
ilado of Rate leathers T1 t tlie Ruler of
th Sandwich lanCs
A million dollars ectx s a pretty
round sum to pay for a clrrk and prob
ably even Worth never drc amed of ask
ing so fabulous a price for the most
elaborate of his garments And yet in
the National museum at Washington is
a cloak the cost of which cannot be
reckoned at less than this vast amount
not one but several flourishing king
doms the kings chiefs and nobles
whenever they appeared in public on
state occasions wore instead of the
purple and ermine of more civilized
potentates capes and cloaks of brilliant
feathers The ladies of the court were
forced to content themselves with feath
er boas as we should call them known
as leis These capes and collars were
made from the yellow red and black
feathers of a few species of small birds
peculiar to the Sandwich Islands and
called from their habits honey suck
ers Fashion ruled even in those days
and as the yellow feathers were scarcer
than the red yellow was the fashionable
color and the more powerful the chief
the more yellow was his robe of state
These yellow feathers were found only
on two or three species of birds the
finest coming from a bird called in the
native language mamo and known as
Drepanis pacifica by ornithologists
and yellow plumage were as dear to
the hearts of the Hawaiian monarchs as
they might be today to the hearts of
patriotic Princeton students and were
sought for far and near throughout the
islands The populace paid poll taxes in
golden feathers instead of golden dol
lars and as each bird furnished but a
few feathers the taxes may be consicL
ered as
mate of the value of the feathers may
be formed from tho prices paid in later
times when a piece of nankeen cloth
valued at 150 was the equivalent of
five feathers but after all the great
element in the cost of these cloaks was
METHOD IN HIS MADNESS
Police Officers Who Humored a Man Found
Out Their Error
A tall slim man with a vacant stare
walked into the police station erf a west

duty and said in a hollow voice
Sir I have an important communi

murderer and have rne buried

WHAT TO DO
There Is comfort in the knowledge so ofon
expressed that Dr Kilmers Swamp Root
the great kid ey remedy fulfills every wish
n relieving pain in the back kidneys live
bladder and every part of the tirinnrv nnJ
vision the police surgeon and all the
constables obeyed the summons In a
moment the room was packed with a
crowd of persons all anxiously looking
toward tho surgeon who in such cases
has the first word
Just so the latter said addressing
the stranger I could tell at a glance
yon were dead Do you happen to know
your name
Certainly- the maniac replied
My name is Berthold Lenwarz
And your address V

Who is the murderer
Columbus
The same as discovered America
Yes
Then let me congratulate you We
have captured the smart chap Come I
will show you to his cell
Directly said the madman in re
ply to the surgeons diplomatic little
speech and began fumbling in his pock
et from which he quickly produced a
thick packet of neatly bound almanacs
Gentlemen when I was alive I used
to soil these almanacs They are the
J best sold in this- country and only cost
threepence each You will admit that
these handsome little volumes ought
not to be left to molder in the grave
and as we appear on such friendly
terms perhaps the gentlemen will not
object to buy the lot
Ten minutes later almanacs all sold
he departed Scottish Nights

He sat in his office musing Now
here are two tickets for the theater to

thing thats been here in a year that
my wife really wants to see and if I
dont ask any one to go and plan to take
her Ill learn when its too lato to make
any change that nothing could hire her
to sit through the old piece
He puzzled his head over the question
for an hour and then he tossed up a
quarter to decide what he would do al
though he knew he would lose which
