J., a Quakercity; is really older than the QuakerCity, and the pictures here shown areof some of its ancient landmarks. Naturally the town is one of great historic interest and one which will well repay the study of the historian.Before Philadelphia was eventhought of William Penn and his partymade a landing where the city of Salem now stands. It was covered thenwith a beautiful forest, and out of theslaughter of trees that has followedone handsome oak was saved. It haBsuccessfully battled with wind andweather well on to 300 years Thespread of its. branches is 117 feet, itsgirth two feet from the ground, is 20feet eight inches and its height isS5 feet.The tree is in the center of theQuaker burial ground, and this fact isbelieved to account for its great sizeand endurance. The Salem peopleare very proud of the tree, and it hasa "caretaker." The old Wood housenear the wharf, at the foot of thesame street which the old oak beautifies, bears the date of 1691, and wasbuilt by bricks brought from Englandby the Penn colonists. This ancestraldwelling of 223 years is now occupiedand kept in good repair.The city of Salem being one of thevery oldest communities in the UnitedStates, it is naturally one of the mostinteresting, and many are the buildings which have endured far beyondthe usual time buildings are supposedto stand.One of the features of the old andsubstantial dwellings is the date atthe end of the building and sometimesj the initials of the original owner,j The residence of Henry II. Johnson,i known as the Johnson homestead, hasj from decade to decade been in theI possession of a Johnson family fromthe time of its builder, Colonel Robert G. Johnson, up to. the present ownJ er, who has no heirs, and great interest is felt as to whom the propertyOld Hancock House.will revert at his death. At the rearof the residence is a magnificent estate, kept up in Colonial style. Theinterior of the mansion has caryedmantels and all the handsome furniture of Revolutionary times. -Salem and Greenwich, N. J., havetheir old but picturesque Quakermeeting house. Each town has two.Why? Because years ago there wasa division. Many left the old creed,and to this day are called Hicksitesfrom the man whom they followed.Those still clinging to the Orthodoxare few and are fast dying out.Many of the Orthodox meetinghouses are closed, while the majorityof those by the other branch are in aflourishing condition.The Quakers are conservative, theyat times hinder radical changes. Theyare wealthy and compose theclass of people. The men and womenenter different doors the men do nottake off their hats. The service is aseason of silence. Ministers withflowery words are not in evidenceeven at the weddings the contractingparties tie their own knot. It seemsmore serious and binding than whena minister does it.March 21, 1778, there was a massacre of American patriots in the oldHancock house at Hancock's Bridge,near Salem, by the British. A tabletin the wall of the house, placed thereby the Daughters of the AmericanRevolution, is a memorial of theeventH Daughter's Suitor Arrested.Newton, N.

Sometimes a cheap-!er wood may fornu the basis .of thebox, with paper-thin veneers of thetropical cedar over it.- !tIt has been suggested that certainkinds of timber on the National forests be reserved for the needs of thenavy. This recalls the fact that thefirst forest reservations in this country were made for naval material.The Department of Agriculture istrying to eliminate the danger tocattle from poisonous plants on National forest ranges. Of these plants,larkspur loco weed, death camas andwater hemlock are the most poisonouns. Larkspur does the most harm,because it is so widely distributed andis particularly bad for cattle. Ordinarily, horses will not eat larkspur,and sheep can eat it without apparent injury.In replacng a l'ailroad trestle recently burned along the North shoreof Great Salt Lake, engineers havejust found that the pies are still perfectly sound after 43 years of service. Looking for the cause, sincethese were only of local pine and fir,they found the timbers were impregnated throughout with salt from thelake.At another point on the lake, 18inch piles, set 29 years, are similarlypreserved with salt which has penetrated to their very center. Timbersin the Southern Pacific trestles acrossSalt Lake, placed in 7902, appear tobe as 'ood as on the day when thepiles were driven. They have beenpreserved well above the water lineby the salt dashed on them by thewaves, a fact apparently anticipatedby the engineers who -built the trestles. The first transcontinental telegraph line, built before the railroad,extended west from Salt Lake Citythrough the prosperous mining campsof Eureka, Austin and Virginia City.When the railroad was built, the telegraph line was transferred to followits right-of-way and the old polessawed off at the ground. An engineerwho recently examined the butts leftin the ground in the salt desert nearFish Springs found that, althoughfifty years had passed since the poleswere cut off, the old butts were perfectly sound.Telephone and electric companiesin the Calt Lake valley have used thelocal salt for preserving poles. Whenset up, about 75 pounds of salt isplaced around the pole on the ground.This method can not be used, however, when the pole is on or near alawn, or in any place where vegetation is desired.Ijt is pointed out that the reasonwhy the waters of Salt Lake act sostrong as a preservative, as distinguished from ocean waters, is because the lake water is so much saltier, being practically a saturate solution. Preservation with, salt is of nouse in ocean piling against the attackof eredos and other marine borers.Experts in the forest service whohave been investigating the preservative treatment of timber offer the suggesion that ties and poles which havebeen immersed for some time in thewaters of the lake ought to be" impervious to decay if the salt is notleaked out by the action of the elements. It has been suggested thatthis can be guarded against, for ex-jampie, uy yajuuug uie , uull ul lucpole with a coat of creosote whichwill keep out the moisture and keepin the salt.L-aMRS.

It is therefore natural thatthey should, all alike, without distinction of race or religion, desire autonomy under Ottoman sovereignty.This defines the present duty of theOttoman state, viz., to go forward relying on her military strength and establish Macedonian autonomy. TheGreeks have no right to remain inKavala, or in Salonika, the capital ofthe new principality. The Ottomanarmy should advance beyond Salonika,to Elassona, and enter Thessaly, andcancel the claims of the Greeks tothe islands also. This erection ofMacedonia into an autonomous principality would serve the interests ofRoumanla and of the great powers ofEurope, and make possible a real balance of power in the Balkans, andstop the present deadly rivalry.THE VENGEANCE OF OUTLAWSTELL BY THE BELL"For Sale by All Druggists.THIS NEW MEDICINESAVES YOU MONEYWe are druggists right here inyour town and make a living out ofthe drug business, but it is becausepeople have to have drugs and not because we like to see people sufferwe don't.
