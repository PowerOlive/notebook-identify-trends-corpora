SCHOOL NOTES
The faculty attended the meet
ing of the Bourbon County Teachers'
Association, w"hich was held at Clin-
tonville, Friday.
The Teachers' Study Class,
which meets every Thursday after
noon at 3:45 o'clock, is at present
jmaking a survey of the retarded pu-'.-
pils in all the grades and High
i- School, ascertaining the cause of
? their retardation and seeking, where
- it is possible, to bring them up to
-their age requirements. The class is
using Strayer and Englehart's
text, "The Classroom Teacher."
The Parent-Teacher Association
met "Tuesday evening with fifty-two
present. An interesting program-
was rendered, consisting of a read
ing by little Miss Mariam Hunt
Lancaster, solo, "Mother of My
Heart,"" by Dorothy Bonar, 'The
lw&e1faSse&ir by -itfe Third
and Fourth grades, and -a talk by
JEtev. g7W. Nutter on "Co-operation
of Parents and Teachers." Short
talks were tlso made by Rev. W. D.
Welbiirn, Messrs. Clark BascomM.
E. Pruitt and 0. E. Hurst. Plans
were discussed for making the
schools a greater help to the com
munity, which resulted in the Asso
ciation voting unanimously to erect
a radio station on the school
grounds. Plans are also being made
tQ have the annual "Get-Together
Day" one of Jthe big features of
Commencemerit week, on which day
an old-fashioned basket dinner will
be served. The First Grade won the
school pennant for the month, by
having the largest number of .visit
ors present.
The student body will take
their spring vacation next ' week,
while the entire faculty attends the
Kentucky Educational' Association!
which meets in Louisville, April
11-14.
The commencement exercises of
Millersburg County High School will
begin May 14, continuing until
May 19. A calendar of the week's
events will appear in these columns
later.
The Junior Agricultural Club
will "meet Monday afternoon, April
10, at Caywood Hall.
An important feature of Wed
nesday's Chapel exercises was the
presentation of a sweater to Prof.
Jones by the Boys' and Girls' Bas
ket Ball teams in appreciation of
his services as coach. The presen
tation speech was made by Prof.
Lancaster, who, as a co-worker of
Mr. Jones' for a period of some six
or seven yfears, paid a beautiful
tribute 'to his efficiency as a teacher
and sterling worth as a man. The
loud applause tendeied by the stu
dent body bespoke the regard the
entire school has for this quiet, nu
assuming man, who goes in and out
among us. There is a rumor that
the farm is calling Mr. Jones, but
we trust that a deaf ear will' be
turned to the call and that we may
be privileged to have him with us
again next year. '
Wednesday's Chapel exercises
were conducted by the pupils of
Mrs. Frank P. Bedford, teacher of
the Fifth Grade. A chorus by a
number of little ladies dressed as
buttercups was appreciated by an
unusually large audience, while the
recitations, songs and little playlet
"Better Speech," came in for their
share of the generous applause.
These Chapel programs -by the
grades are -growing very interesting
and are looked forward to with
pleasure by the pupils (and back
upon in like manner by the teach
ers.) The next Chapel program,
April 19, will be rendered by the
Sixth Grade, who will give "The
Old School at Hickory Holler." The
