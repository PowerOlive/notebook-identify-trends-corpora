V&C.,!vsT,ftf4PUBLISHED EVERY TUESDAY ANDTHE-YEAR.VOLUME XLI!PARIS, BOURBON COUNTY, KENTUCKY, FRIDAY, MARCH 31, 1922u.BOURBON JtEWS4FRIDAY INMnajyJEWISH BELIEF CAMPAIGHCLOSES IN BOURBONRaising ,an excess of $603 overthe required $2,000 quota forBourbon county, the campaign inthis city and county for, the JewishRelief Fund came to a glorious closeyesterday. The teams of solicitorshave been energetic and faithful inthe performance of their duties,making it possible for Bourbon tobe the first county in this districtto report its full quota and more,raised before the specified time.Chairman William Shire reportedto District Chairman Jonas Weilyesterday that Bourbon county had"gone over the top" in the matterof raising its quota, and that thesum of $2,60 had been secured. Ofthis amount the larger portion wasin cash, a very small per cent ofpledges remaining to be collected.The sum of $1,070 was raisedamong the Jewish residents of thecounty, there being only fourteenfamilies in this city to take part inthe campaign. The re'sponse to theappeal in behalf of the starving Jewsand Russians of Europe was a spontaneous one, and showed the milk ofhuman kindness still was morethan a figure of speech. We thoughtwe had become surfeited with"drives" and "campaigns," but ourpeople could not have it said ofthem that they were callous to thecries of starving women and children. One who could not be touched by an appeal like this must havebeen hardened to the very last decree. Mr. Shire and assistants desirethrough THE NEWS to return theirsincere thanks to those who contributed to this worthy cause, and toassure them that each will receive asilent vote of thanks from the hungry mouths that this money willTielp to feed.TOBACCO CANVASATscnr- -tf257-J"We Know BowtYOUR NEWSTETSONHATFOR SPRINGIS HERECJ Many of the most discriminating youngmen among our customers choose Stetsonsseason after season.I They rely on- Stetsonquality.
