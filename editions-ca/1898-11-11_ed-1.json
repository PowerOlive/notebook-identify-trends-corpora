He Has a Weakness For an Army of Fam
ily Servants
We were a family of 8 occasionally
of 10 or 12 says Prince Kropotkin in
The Atlantic but 50 servants at Mos
cow and half as many more in the
country were considered not one too
many Four coachmen to attend a dozen
horses three cooks for the masters and
two more for the servants a dozen men
to wait upon us at dinner time one
man plate in hand standing behind
each person seated at the table and
girls innumerable in the maidservants
room but how could any one do with
less than this
Besides the ambition of every landed
proprietor was that everything required
for his household should be made at
home by his own men
How nicely your piano is always
tuned I suppose Herr Schimmel must
be your tuner one of the visitors
would remark
To be able to answer I have my
own piano tuner was in those times
the correct thing
What beautiful pastry the guests
would exclaim when a work of art
composed of ices and pastry appeared
toward the end of the dinner Confess
prince that it comes from Tremble
the fashionable pastry cook
It is my own confectioner a pupil
of Tremble whom I have allowed to
show what he can do was the reply
whioh elicited general admiration
To have embroideries harnesses fur
niture in fact everything made by
ones own men was the ideal of the
rich and respected landed proprietor
Bismarck as Dr Jeltyll
No greater contrast could possibly be
imagined than that which existed be
tween the Bismarck of private life and
the Bismarck of politics In the home
circle writes a correspondent who
knew him well he was perfectly
charming easy going and good natured
He was passionately fond of children
and I have seen him over and over again
have a game with the little ones of his
gardener who were very familiar with
him and would not hesitate to climb
upon his knee
Once when his gardeners little girl
J died the great statesman went to con
dole with inin He was dreadfully up
set and while holding the poor fathers
hand burst into tears for he was very
fond of the child He kissed the littlo
corpse and himself placed a bunch of
roses in its hand He was always eager
to assist his poorer neighbors and en
joyed chatting with them oa all sub
jects but politics These he never men
tioned London Chronicle
Tlio Professors Wisdom
The stern professor of the feminine
preparatory school sat at his desk try
ing to unravel a knotty problem when
a fluffy haired miss of 16 approached
Please sir she began in a tremu
lous voice will you grant me permis
sion to go out riding with my brother
this afternoon
Now the old man had not forgotten
the days of his youth neither was he a
fool and looking over his spectacles he
slowly said
So you want to go riding with your
brother do you By the way is this
brother of yours any relation to you

Servian men do not marry for love
but to secure an additional worker for
the household so very young men mar

or Government Money
At close of our Civil War in 1865
there appeared in the London Times
the following
If that mischievous financial pol
icy which had its origin in the North
American Republic during the late
Civil War in that country should be
come indurated down to a fixture
then that government will furnish its
money without cost It will have all
the money that is necessary to carry
on its trade and commerce It will
become prosperous beyond precedent
in the history of civilized nations of
the world The brain and wealth of
all countries will go to North America
THAT GOVERNMENT MUST BE
DESTROYED OR IT WILL DE
STROY EVERY MONARCHY ON
THIS GLOBE
The famous Hazzard circular to
capitalists in New York and the Buell
Bank circular to United StatesJBank
ers both emanating from London arid
the fabulous corruption fund raised in
England and Germany estimated at
1500000 were the agents that se
cured the closing of our mints against
silver
The walk into my parlor policy
of England during and since the
Spanish War is the latest evidence
of English Diplomacy in shaping the
destiny of the United States Govern
ment
Notwithstanding the famine price
of wheat the Spanish War and fabu
lous expenditures of money by our
government during the past year gold
has increased in value eleven per cent
and all other values decreased in the
same proportion
For a thorough understanding of
the money question or silver issue
the Cincinnati Enquirer has uniformly
given evidence of its ability to teach
explain and produce all facts and
truth It is a paper that ought and
can be read by all classes with pleas
ure and profit
