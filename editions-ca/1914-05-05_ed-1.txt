In June,July and August the mean temperature in Mexico will be 85 degrees.During the same months in Philadelphia the temperature will not. reachmore than 76 degrees on an average.Contrasted with the coast city ofVera' Cruz, Mexico City is comparatively dry. At Vera Cruz the annualrainfall is about 100 inches, while atMexico City not more than 'thirtyinches fall annually. The humidityat Vera Cruz is, consequently, greaterthan at Mexico City, but the heat during the summer months at the latterpoint is terribly oppressive."Should American soldiers invadeinterior Mexico," said ForecasterBliss recently, "they will undoubtedlyfind the heat their worst foe. BeforeNorthern men can live in Mexico withcomfort thay must became acclim-ated. Although the temperature doesnot advance more than 9 degreesabove our mean temperature, theI heat conditions in Mexico differ fromthose in Philadelphia and other North-J ern cities, by reason of the fact thata warm spell in this climate neverI lasts more than five or six days at theI utmost. In Mexico a mean averagetemperature of 85 degrees is usualand, therefore, residents of the North,who have been accustomed to a variable climate, will find themselves hadrpressed if forced to remain in Mexicofor any length of time."Along the coast of Mexico, especially at Vera Cruz, the humidity is terribly oppressive.

Agriculture Descrmes its value asEarly Pastruage and Soil Improver,WASHINGTON, D. C, April 29A number of ways in which the earlyappearance of crimson clover in thespring can be turned to the farme'sadvantage are pointed out in a newpublication of the United States Depal tment of Agriculture, Farmers'Bulletin 579, "Crimson Clover Utilization." In the Southern and CentralAtlantic States this crop is of particular value. Generally speaking itsuffers from the severe winters in theNorth and from too great drynessWest of the Mississippi. In Floridaalso it has proved less successful thanelsewhere.Crimson clover, says the bulletin,has two great advantages. It is anexcellent fertilizer and it can be usedfor pasture and hay before any othergreen growth is available, the landbeing then sown with ordinary summer-growncrop. The clover itself canbe sown toward the end of the summer on land where such late crops ascorn or tomatoes are still under cultivation. Its use, therefore, does notinterfere with other products and itsbenefits cost little but the labor andseed involved.To obtain the full value of crimsonclover as a fertilizer the entire greencrop should be plowed under, thusadding to the soil a large quantity ofnitrogen and humus, or decayed vegetable matter. The poorer the landthe greater is the benefit that the succeeding crop derives from this process. A yield of 30 bushels of cornper acre may ordinarily be increasedby crimson clover to 45, but on richerland an increase of more than 10bushels is uncommon. A convenientmethod of calculation is to considera full crop of crimson clover, weighing with roots and tops, about 10tons per acre. In this way the soilis greatly enriched each year withoutinterfering in any way with the regular -money crops, such as corn, cotton jor tomatoes.It is, however, by no means necessary to sacrifice the entire crop ofcrimson clover to fertilizing purposes.Excellent results can be obtained byploughing under merely the roots andstubble. This it is estimated returnsto the soil 40 per cent, as much nitrogen as the green crop. When this isdone the clover itself can be usedeither for pasture, before ordinarygrass is sufficiently far adyanced to beavailable, or for hay which can begathered in time to leave the land forfor another crop.Crimson clover intended for haymust, however, be cut at the rightmoment, when t the most advancedheads are beginning to show fadedflowers at their base. At this stagethe iplants contain the maximumamount of protein and dry matter,while the leaves are still present andthe stems comparatively green. Ifthe harvest is put off. the short hairson the stehis and flower heads become dry and s'tiff. In this stagethere is danger that they may formhard dry hair balls in the intestinaltracts of the horses and mules towhich the hay is fed. These hairhniis sniiri nnmnnnf fpir-iifco crnipf.ures, nearly always cause death,Early cutting, however, and judiciousmixing with other hay will obiviatethis difRcultv to a jrreat extent, and.under any circumstances, cattle arerarely aftected. By dairymen, crimson clover hay is considered a roughage feed fully equal it not superiorto either red or alsike clover.For early pasturing crimson cloveris even more satisfactory, its chiefdrawback being the limited period inwhich it can be utilized for this purpose. This period, however, is ample to enable the ordinary grass pastures to attain a growth which willgreatly increase their carrying capacity later in the season. After thecattle are lemoved, the uneatenplants and the manure left behind areploughed under, the manure of course,forming a valuable addition to the fertilizing effect ot the clover.As a pasture, hay or fertilizer,therefore, crimson clover offers itselfto farmers at the time when the ordinary summer-grown crops are notavailable. Incidentally, it should besaid, this clover is valuable for poultry. A tubful of hand-cropped leavesthrown into the pouldtry yard willprovide the chickens with the bestpossible green food at a season wheneggs are ordinarily high and everything that promotes laying is mostwelcome. Small patches of crimsonclover are, in fact, grown by poultryraisers for this purpose alone.Methods of growing the crop, thepreparation of the seed bed, and thesoils and selections best adapted tothe purpose are discussed in a previ- jous publication of the Department otAgriculture, Farmers' Bulletin 550, j"Crimson Clover; Utilization," will be jsent free on request.FOR A TORPID LIVER."I have used Chamberlain's Tabletsoff and on for the past six yearswhenever my liver shows signs of being m a disordered condition.

Various means for fightingthese bugs have been devised buttheir most successful enemies are thebirds of the air. In regard to the natural destroyers of the insect pest theauthor of the article writes as follows :"If the law of the survival of the fit-J test applies in all cases, it is reason-able to believe that the ultimatecheck to the propagation of thechinch bug will come about by thebirds that eat them at all stages oftheir life history. Among the birdsthat eat millions oi these pests maybe mentioned the quail, the meadowlark and the sparrow."If the chinch bug is to be practically eradicated we must depend uponthe efforts of the quai. as his homeis in the brooding grounds of thechinch bug. Nowadays things thatare done have a certain degree of theidea of permanency about them,i hence the first step in the permnentdestruction of the chinch bug is afmore complete protection of the quailj that assists also in lowering the loss-ies caused by the cotton weevil, tnegrasshopper and the potato bug."One of the Mysteries of life is howa girl manages to hanldle a two-footcold with a two-inch handkerchief andj never use her fingers as auxiliaries.virtue is its own reward, but thatdoesn't do the Fatted Calf any goodwhen the Prodigal Son is feasting onroast veal.iMUUJco$so5ooo ' Arer Sale by ftl!
