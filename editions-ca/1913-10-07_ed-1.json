OF MILLER
The City Council in regular meet
ing Vrednesday night ordered a chem
dcal fire engine. This puts our volun
tary fire department in most excellent
-condition, and places Millersburg far
T&eyond any little city of its size. The
m&w steam engine which was ordered
. few weeks ago is expected to arrive
ait any time, and when the chemical
engine arrives this will give vl two
steam engines, a chemical -engine, a.
ladfler wagon and a sufficient amount
of hose. The new fire cistern is about
completed. It is 30 feet in length, 10
-feet in width and 10 feet deep, and
will be never-failing.inasmuch as it is
to be supplied from the never-failing
cistern at the Peed & McClintock
lam, and when the connections are
-m&de the water can be pumped into
it at the same time it is being
jumped up. With the new chemical
sngiae we will be prepared to cope
Tvitfc almost any fire that is likely to
occur.

after a short service at the grave con

had been spent in this community,
and a large crowd was present to pay
the last sad tribute to her memory.
She was the widow of the late Joseph
McCleland, who died about twenty
years ago, and is survived by one son,
Mr. Joseph McClelland, Jr., of Cincin
nati. Two sons have preceded her to
the grave. She was a lifelong mem

many years was an active worker in

TWO INJURED WHEN CYCLE
COLLIDES WITH AUTOMOBILE
Keller Farmer, a telegraph opera
tor on the Louisville and Nashville
railroad and C. B. Cook were injured
the former perhaps seriously in an ac
cident which occurred on the Win
chester pike Saturday afternoon.
Farmer and Cook were riding the ma
chine which collided with an automo
bile driven by Mr. Harry Clay.
The accident occurred about one
half mile from the city. Cook was
driving the motorcycle and in turning
to the side of the road to allow an
automobile to pass, the couple failed
to note the approach of Mr. Clay from
the rear, as the approach of the ma
chine was obscured by the dust.
The car driven by Mr. Clay struck
the motorcycle, throwing the riders
to the ground and passing entirely
over them. Mr. Clay ran some dis
tance before his car could be brought
to a stop and backing up succeeded
in disengaging the two men from the
wreck of the motorcycle. They were
placed in the car and brought to this
city where they were given every at
tention. Farmer was badly hurt about the
limbs, suffering a severe wrench to
the right member and was badly cut
about the body. He is at his home on
Scott avenue and it is probable he
will be confined to his bed for several
weeks. Cook escaped with a few
slight bruises. While the accident
was very unfortunate, no blame is at
tached to Mr. Clay.

women who are interested in the
schools will remember to register.

L
Evans' Minstrels at Lexington.
The coming of "Honey Boy" Evans
to the Lexington Opera House for
three nights and Wednesday matinee,
commencing last night, recalls the in
augural appearance of this favorite
little monologist at the head of the
first "Honey Boy" minstrels, under
the direction of Cohan and Harris.
Evans was the featured star of that
big assemblage of stars, but he did not
become sole owner and proprietor un
til the middle of the second year of
the Cohan and Harris tour; it was in
February, 1910, that Evans bought
out Cohan and Harris and assumed
his managerial dignity. George Evans
was for years a minstrel enthusiast.
He was one of the original Reed and
Collier minstrels at the Bush strret
Theatre, San Francisco. He was a
ballad sjiger also in Haverly's big
Mastodon troupe. So it may be seen
that he had "been to school" in min
strelsy long before the Cohan and
Harris venture. This year, the sixth
of the "Ilcnoy Boy" Minstrels, finds
George Evans as enthusiastic about
the possibilities of America's time
honored entertainment as he has
ever been, and he contends that min
strelsy is really only in its infancy,
and that the public is as eager now
as ever to applaud its strides. Seats
are now on sale. (adv)

The first view of the Kinetophone,
the genuine Edison Talking Pictures,
will be given at the Paris Grand Oct.
10 and 11, where the apparently im
posible will be achieved, the audience
hearing and also seeing a musical
performance, a minstrel show, and
geting an ' explanation. It seems be
yond .belief, but the beginning is only
in sight. We are making history
every day, and the Kinetophone will
give future generations the complete
story in every detail. The Edison
Talking Pictures are all that they are
heralded to be, the synchronization is
perfect, the voices clear and distinct.
and have created an unlimited amount
of talk where shown. (adv)

William A. Brady's production of
"Little Women", a dramatization of
Louisa M. Alcott's immortal story,
will be presented at the Paris Grand,
Wednesday, Oct. 8, matinee and
night, just as it ran for a solid year
at the Playhouse, New York.
"Little Women," as it is pictured
by Miss Aicott in her book of that
name, is in truth the story of the four
Aicott girls, the daughters of Amos
Bronson Aicott. Brought ud in thp.
atmosphere of "plain living and high
tnmKing'witli Emerson, Thoreau
and Hawthorne as neighbors and
family friends, what wonder that the
reader of today is startled by the mod
ern spirit which Miss Aicott, the Jo of
the story, has put in her little book?
It has taken years to get the Aicott
heirs to consent to having "Little
Woman" put on the stage, but the ar
gument which finally prevailed was
that the play would actually repro
duce the book, and that Miss Aicott,
herslf, with her keen love for the
stage and her delight in playwriting,
would have been the first to welcome
her story in stage form.
Ever since William A. Bradv an
nounced his forthcoming production
of "Little Women," his office has been
deluged with letters both of inquiry
and suggestion. "Please make Jo
marry Laurie" is on of the favorites,
which recalls to those familiar with
Louisa M. Alcott's charming "Life and
Letters," one characteristic entry in
her journal: "I don't care; I will not
let Jo marry Laurie, no matter what
people say." Another is: "Please
don't let Beth die for I like her best
of all." All of which goes to show
how thoroughly the story has been
absorbed and enjoyed.
The city school will dismiss at 2:45
so that the scholars can attend the
matinee. Curtian at 3:00.
