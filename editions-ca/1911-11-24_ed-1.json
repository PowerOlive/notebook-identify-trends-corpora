Eastern Leaguer May Minage
Paris.
The question of selecting a manager
to pilot the Bourbonices next season is
a matter of deep concern among the
local fans even at this eaily date, and
while several are mentioned for the
position none of them seem to fill the
desires of the head of the Paris club. I
The fact that McKernan has foun,d a
berth with the Battle Creek club of
the Southrcn Michigan League has put
a damper on the hopes of the fans
that he may be retained by the Paris
club to manage the club during the
coming season.
Before leaving McKernan recom
mended several men to President
Bacon any one of whom would most
likely come up to the mark in point of
management btit even no wit is diffi
cult to get a line on any of them.
However President Bacon has one man
under consideration who he believes
will come nearer filling McKernan's
place than any that have been
mentioned.
The Paris President is not inclined
to divulge his namB at present and
will give out no further information
other than that he has been playing
with marked success in the Eastern
League and it is probable that if no
other with '. better qualicafitions can
be secured negotiation will be opened
soon after the beginning of the year
looking to the securing of this man to
head the club next year.
The Directors of the Paris club will
hold a meeting some time during the
month of January when this important
matter will be taken up and a decision
reached at an early date that the new
manager may have ample time to get
together a team that will be up in the
running next season.

stairway was full and women were
struggling and swaying in a congested
mass, unable either to advance or
retreat
"Come on," a leader cried, "there's
no getting through here. As she spoke
she gathered up her skirts, gave a
quick spring and landed astride the
banister. There was a flash of stock
ings and lace, and the next instant
she was on the floor below, fighting
her way toward the counter. One after
another the bolder ones followed un
til the banister was full of sliding
women.- One after another they land
ed at the bottom in shrieking heaps
and would plunge into the struggling
mass in front of the counter. At the
handbag counter the usual bargain
tactics were resorted to. A woman
would seize four or five bags and hold
them all untli she had made a choice.
Many women were accompanied by
their husbands, and it was their part
to "hold out" desirable looking articles
until the wife decided which was the
most desirable, the rest would be
dumped back on the counter.
