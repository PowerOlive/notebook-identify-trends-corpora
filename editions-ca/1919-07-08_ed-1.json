'AMERICA DEVOURING EUROPE'S
ART TREASURES
;3 '
(New York World)
America's absortion of the world's
stock of diamonds continues to ex
cite concern in Europe. London
alone in the first five months of the
year sent us $15,000,000 worth of
them, nearly double the amount for
the corresponding period of 1918 and
representing 65 per cent, of the sup
ply of uncut stones. Buyers for Amer
ican jewelry firms are also reported
as oil their way to Russia to procure
hitherto7 unobtainable gems.
Is this country soon to have a mo
nopoly on diamonds? Figures pub
lished a year ago indicated that it
then possessed more than half of the
world's visible supply, and war con
ditions are certain to increase ex
portations of the precious stones to
this market.
They seem destined also to swell
the- export or works of art to this
country, a drift which had created
apprehension in England before the
war began. In the case of a cele
brated portrait by Sir Joshua Rey
' nolds, soon to be placed on sale by
the Duke of Westminster, the art
critic of a London newspaper warns
English collectors against "the art
devouring monster of the West."
No Aoubt that art-devouring mon
ster will gulp down, other precious
things besides diamonds and pictures.
Where the money is, there will the
market be. But the process has eco
nomic aspects which outweigh the
sentimental. Europe in parting with
its gems and artistic treasures is ex
changing collateral for cash or
credit, and the transaction helps to
rtore the equilibrium disturbed by
thenar..

EGGS AS HUMAN EOOD
There is no other single element
of human diet of either animal or
vegetable character which is, per
haps, more commonly used the world
over, nor served for the uses of man
in a greater variety of styles and
ways than are eggs; andr while the
egg of the common barnyard chicken
is the one most generally and uni
versally used, a complete list of the
different kinds and varieties of eggs
which are somewhere subjected to the
dietary uses of man must include a
range extending from the ostrich to
the insect must mention ostrich,
turkey, goose, duck, guinea fowl,
chicken, seagull, murre, heron, sea
swallow, many land birds, alliga
tor, turtle, terrapin, lizard, serpent,
fish and even insect.
Where ostriches are raised as an
important industry in both the Unit
ed States and South Africa, ostrich
eggs are used as human food and said
to be of an excellent quality. Turkey
eggs are used as a diet, but they are
generally far too valuable for breed
ing purposes to permit of their exten
sive dietary use. Goose, duck and
guinea eggs are more or less exten
sively used as elements of human
food, the last-named being especially
prized for delicacy of flavor. Turtle
eggs, of both fresh and water and salt
water varieties, are highly prized as
a diet in most of the countries and
sections in which they are found
abundantly, and the eggs of the ter
rapin are usually served, not separ
ately as such, but along with the
flesh or meat, when prepared for
the table, while sturgeon eggs and
shad roe are the most common in
stances of the use of fish eggs as hu
man diet; but the eggs of the alli
gator, of the lizzard, of the snake,
and even of some insects, are used
as human food by some races which
are without the prejudices of our
Western civilization.

DEATHS.
BURDIN.
Mrs. John H. Burdin, aged sixty
eight, wife of Rev. John H. Burdin,
for many years a resident of Paris,
died at her home near the Forks of
Elkhorn, in Franklin county, Sunday
night after a long illness. She 'is
survived by her husband, two daugh
ters, Mrs. J. L. Lee, of Steadman
town, and Mrs. Margaret Singer, of
Harrodsburg; and four sons, Luther
E. Burdin, of Louisville, Frank Bur
din, of Frankfort, Paul Burdin and
John Burdin, of the Forks of Elk
horn. The funeral was held yesterday af
ternoon at three o'clock in the
chapel of the Frankfort Cemetery,
followed by burial on the family lot.
MITCHELL.
Dr. S. E.' Mitchell, one of the
oldest physicians in the county, and
perhaps in this section of the State,
died at the Massie Memorial Hospital,
in this city, at five o'clock Sunday af
ernoon, after a long illness of urae
mic poisoning. Dr. Mitchell at the
time of his death, was in his eighty
fifth year.
Dr. Mitchell had been an active
practicioner of medicine in the North
Middletown vicinity for many years.
Leaving there he went to Texas,
where he practiced successfully a
a number of years, then returned to
Kentucky again, where he resumed
his practice. He opened an office in
Paris, but his active participation in
the work was not of very long dura
tion, and he retired from practice.
For some time he has been residing
in the country, and was brought to
the Massie Memorial Hospital a short
time ago. He has relatives in Flor
ida and Missouri, as well as in Ken
tucky. The funeral will take place in the
Paris Cemetery this afternoon, at
three o'clock, with services conduct
ed at the grave by Mr. A. L.' Boat
right, of the Paris Christian church.

U. S. HAS GOLD MARKET PRACTI
CALLY CORNERED.
Already possessed of the greatest
single stock of gold in history, the
United States could lay claim to-day
to most "oi the remaining free gold
of the world in payment of its favor
able merchandise balance, the Fed
eral Reserve Bulletin will say in its
July issue. The, balance approxi
mated $9,000,000,000 in the last
three years and bids fair to continue
at the same rate this year, affording
a problem to arrange payments with
out bankrupting debtor nations and
still further enhancing the cost of
living here through the importation
of more metal.
Under the gold embargo, which re-
cently was lifted, making the United
States practically the only free gold
market in the world, the federal re
serve board issued 1,142 licenses for
the evpont of $152,326,976 of goTd
and 1,500 licenses for the shipment
of $502,756,003 in silver. About 755
applications of all classes were Re
clined. HOW MONEY GROWS.
An interesting display made re
cently in a St. Louis Bank window
showed sixteen quarters, a dime and
two pennies under the legend "To
day," while an arrow pointed frcja
this money to another legend, "Nehv
Year's Day, 1924." with exactly six
teen quarters, a dime and two cents,
then an equal mark, followed by a
War Savings Stamp and the arrow
ppinted to a $5.00 bill under the
coins on the opposite side. This was
a graphic way of showing that $4.12
in itself would not grow at all dur
ing five yars, whereas invested in
Thrift Stamps it will earn nearly an
other dollar.
NOT TO BE EXPECTED
It was not to be expected that any
special commission of Germans, least
of all one whose membership was
made up principally of military and
naval officers, would find that the ex
ecution of Capt. Fryatt, of the Brit
ish merchant marine was in violation
of international law, nor is there any
evidence that the Germans recognize
in the ruthless submarine campaign,
in which thousands of non-combat-tants
were murdered, anything to be
regretted except in so far as the
Tripitz methods in their political
consequences proved disastrous. s
UNCLE SAM'S MONEY XOOKS
MIGHTY GOOD TO THE
SOLDIER BOYS
Just how gbod American money
looks to a man away from home is
illustrated in the story told by one
of those boys in khaki who fought in
France in the war for the preserva
tion of civilization and who after
wards saw service across the border
in Germany.
Sergt. H. H. Coffee was attached
to Company G., 45th Infantry, and
for six months was at Frier, Ger
(many, 30 miles from Luxemburg.
Now he is back in old Missouri and
fills a desk at the Western Newspa
per Union.
"While we were in France," said
Sergt. Coffee, "we were paid in
French money. And afterward,
when we were in Germany, we were
paid in German money.
"The difference in the French and
German money, as compared with
United States money is amazing. It
is printed on white paper, of an in
ferior quality and one gets an awful
wad of it for a comparatively small
quantity of American money.
"When we got this foreign stuff
the boy3 were very liberal with it.
They would gamble with it, would
lend it and handle it very carelessly.
But when we got to Brest, on our
way home and all that bum money
was exchanged for real American
money, all that liberality disappeared
and it was guarded zealously."
That is one of the lessons the war
has taught. American (money, any(

A NAVAL BAROMETER
Directions for converting a burned
out incandescent light bulb into a
barometer that will foretell changes
in the weather with remarkable suc
cess are given in the Youth's Com
panion. Place a discarded bulb un
der water in a deep basin, and after
protecting the hands against danger
from broken glass, break off the
pointed bit of glass at the very end
of the bulb with a pair of pliers.
As soon as an opening is made in
the glass the bulb will fill with wa
ter, which rushes in to take the place
of the vacuum. Tie a cord or stout
string about the neck of the bulb and
hang it on a hook or nail. If the
weather is to be fine no water will
drop from the hole at the bottom of
the bulb. When the water begins to
bulge out of the opening until drops
fall from the bulb you may expect
a change in the weather. Atmos
pheric pressure governs the action of
this simple barometer. When the
pressure increases a sign of fair
weather it rushes the water back
from the mouth on the bulb, and no
drop can fonm; when it falls, the wa
ter expands through the opening un
til a few drops fall. As lower press
ure nearly always proceeds a change
of weather, a drip from the bulb
usually indicates a coming storm.
