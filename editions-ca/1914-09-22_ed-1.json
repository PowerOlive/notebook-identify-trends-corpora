.e uXmn 7of.;; gea Pand pleasure. "The Queen . of
Venice the City of the Sea i essentially a musical
famous the world over ror us poeuu
and haunting -beauty, constitutes one
of the big features to be presented
by Lyman H. Howe at the Paris
Grand Opera House on Thursday,
October 1, 1914. Throned on her
hundred isles, it resembles no other
city on earth, not merely because
of the perpetual pageant of graceful
gondolas gliding tnrougn us uquiu
avenues, but there is something so
distinctive in its architecture that
must be seen, to be appreciated.
Here are architctural jewels unsur
passed anywhere else even in Italy.
At every turn there is a blending of
the poetical and picturesque. The
transcendent beauty of the city is
rivalecTonly by the glory of its histo
ry romantic and tragic. After view
ing Venice by daylight, the scenes
change to the hour of sunset, when
the sun, like a cunning necromancer
robes the city in beauty that is im
perial and dazzling. Finally they
change again to Venice by moonlight.
ThP. color transformations from the
golden glow of sunset to the en
chanting emerald of moonlight in this
paradise of pleasure may well thrill
heart and mind. The glide along
these curving promenades of rippling
water lined with palaces, massive
columns, marble balconies and sculp
tured arches all under tne speu oi

9th and 29th with a matinee Tues
day. Not in many seasons nas a mu-
sical attraction wan. leucxrcu
such favor as that which greeted M.r.
Riley's production in New York. The
-whole thing is a joy and delight and
the fun kept at high spee, every sec
ond. Such, a chorus of loveliness is
seldom seen. They sing like larks,
dance with dream-like grace and
lightness, and wear such stunning
clothes that it makes the feminine
mnn.harc: of tii p. audience gasp with
envy' and cause the eye-balls of the
