IF I WERE YCJ
I wouldnt think aboiu distress
If 1 were you
I wouldnt even once confess
To ever feeling blue
But when the sun is well disposed
To shine upon our friends and foei
Id be content with even less
If 1 were you
Just let it rain or snow or shine
Twill bring no gain
To blame misfortune or repine
The longest lane
Will end som time and every day
Roses will bloom along the way
Because of rain
Then sing your songs cry if you must
But keep in view
The healthy soul inspiring trust
Thats alwajs due
To them that strive to live above
All earthly things exoepting love
Id let all other treasures rust
If I were yowl

FATE OF A CAESARS ASHES
Shakespeares Conceit Finds a Coun
terpart In Reality
When Shakespeare put In the mouth
of Hamlet the curious conceit about
the dust of the great Alexander hav
ing become loam and then stopping a
bunghole in a beer barrel he had seem
ed to reach the ultimate extravagance
of imagination Yet near the Porta
Salaria a still more unexpected ex
travagance was revealed after the ex
cavations carried on there In these
a cippus or sepulchral Ifolumn con
taining a cinerary urn of rare oriental
alabaster was brought to light The
inscription on the cippus revealed that
the ashes contained within the urn
were those of Calpunius Piso Licini
anus who in Februaiy A D 09 was
proclaimed Cmuiar by the Emperor
Galbra Four days afterward Galbra
was killed and Piso also suffered
death ill his thirty first year His were
the ashes that the alabaster uru con
tained
The precious uru was given to a
workman employed on the premises to
take care of Some days after when
the proprietor of the place asked for
the urn he found it empty Where
said he are the ashes that were
here The workman surprised said
that he gathered them together and
never dreaming that they were any
good but being white and clean sent
them to his wife to make lye for hor
washing And thus said the late
Shakespeare Wood describing this in
cident have the ashes of an imperial
Caesar adopted by Galbra as Tiberius
was adopted by Augustus and accept
ed by the senate been used more than
18 centuries after his death by a Uo
man washerwoman to cleanse her dirty
iiuen together with the ashes of other
members of the family in whose veins
flowed the noble blood of Crassi and
of Pompey the Great Baltimore Sun

It was such a good joke on me
said the girl in gray to the girl in blue
as they stirred their chocolate that I
must tell you
You know how John has been pro
posing to me at regular intervals ever
since he was out of knickerbockers
Well he did it again the other night
and with his usual facility chose an
occasion when I was very cross
He did it a little more awkwardly
than usual too deliberately choosing
the old fashioned method of offering
me his hand and heart
Here she paused to drink some choc
olate and the girl in blue asked
breathlessly what she said
Oh remarked the other in the
tone of one relating an event of no
importance 1 told him that 1 bellevud
I was already provided with tL full
quota of bodily organs and liiat I
wouldnt deprive him
And what did he say
Well Belle thats the funny thing
He seemed to brace up and said po
litely that at any rate there was no
doubt about my having my full share
of cheek And I was so delighted to
find a man capable of even that much
repartee on bring rejected that I ac
