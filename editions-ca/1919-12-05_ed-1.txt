The marketthroughout was strong and the bidding brisk. It was generally predicted that the Paris market willagain lead the State in averages.Auctioneer W. H. Wycoff conductedthe sales at the two Bourbon houses.A remarkable incident happenedduring the sale. A farmer who had"his crop of tobacco on the floorwaiting for the auctioneer to reach5t was approached by a local broker,and asked what he would take forhis crop as a whole. The farmeranswered that he would sell it forseventj- cents a pound. The brokerimmediately accepted the offer, andin less than five minutes after thetransaction had resold it on thefloor for nienty cents a pound.Preceding the sales AuctioneerOllie. Clay, representing the AlliedTobacco League of America, made arousing talk to the growers and"handlers, in which he urged thefarmers and all other business interest connected with the growingand handling of tobacco 10 organize and work against Uip anti-tobaccocrusade. The first basket insales was secured by J. M. Sturgeon,Tepresenting the American TobaccoCompany.An unusual sale was made by Mr.Charles N. Peddicord just beforethe opening sale. A ciop of 3,150-pounds raised by Charles N. Peddicord, sas sold on the breaks atprices ranging up to 88 cents. Justbefore the sale Mr. Peddicord solda half-interest in the crop to MattLair for $1,035, clearing the netsum of $700.

And while fiveyears is the time designated in whichto pay this sum, yet it seems like atremendous undertaking for a congregation no larger than this one;but such is the spirit of consecrationand determination which prevailsthat no task seems too great for thepeople to attempt. The SundaySchool pledged $1,000 to the campaign. Lunch was served at noon, andRev. Fox preached a sermon especially to the members of the church at 2p. m.The B. Y. P. U. was largely attended at 6:30, Mrs. Prewitt Wil-"mouth having charge of the program.At 7:30 p. m. Rev. Fox againpreached one of his forcible and heartreaching sermons. The Jr. OrderUnited American Mechanics attendedthe evening service in a body, and themembers were given a cordial welcome. There were three additions to thechurch: Mr. T. B. Tune and Mrs.Holmes Smart by letter, and one byconfession; these with the five additions the previous Sunday, makeeight since the arrival of Rev. Fox.The local drive will continuethrough this week, and it is confidently expected that the full amount$60,000 will he pledged beforethe close of the week.IS GENUINESafely Stop Colds As Told In "BayerPackages"To break up a cold in the head,neck, back, or any part of body besure you take only "Bayer Tabletsof Aspirin" with the safety "BayerCross" on them.

It makes little difference what minority it is; whethercapital or labor, or any other class;no sort of privilege will ever be per-tiubbcu mi uuuiiuaie inis country."Orderly processes, the message declared, were the only ones by whichrelief and reform could be obtained."Those who would propose anyother method of reform are enemiesof this country," the- message aid.Let those beware who take theshorter road" of disorder and revolution." Notable among his recommendations is one for measures which will"remove the causes" of political restlessness in our body politic, declaring that those causes were "superficial rather than deep seated." Themessage was read to the Congress byclerks the President's illness preventing his delivering the address in person. fcReferring to the causes of the unrest he declared that they "arise fromor are connected with the failure onthe part of our Government to arrivespeedily at a just and permanentpeace, permitting return to normalconditions; from the transfusion ofradical theories from seething European centers, pending such delay;from heartless profiteering, resultingfrom the increase of the cost of living, and, lastly, from the machinations of passionate and malevolentagitators. With the return to normalconditions this unrest will rapidlydisappear."oWhere Blame Lies.Life starts most of us out with anexcellent endowment of strength.

The Paris market sold 12,000,000 pounds of tobacco the past seasfor the hlfhest average obtained on anyvmarket in Kentucky.2. The Bourbon Tobacco Warehouse Company sold in their two hovsesmore than 8,000,000 pounds of tobacco for die highest average on Paris market. 3. We now have three of the best and finest lighted houses in Kentucky.4. Our Auctioneer, Mr. Wikoff, will be back. He is in a class by himself,as those who have heard him know.5. We have the best starter in Kentucky.6. This Company has held down the fees on the Paris market for sevenyears and will hold them down again this year in spite of the fact that we werestrongly urged to raise them.7. This means a saving of 30 cents per hundred on $40 tobacco; a savingof 35 cents per hundred on $50 tobacco and 40 cents per hundred on $60 tobacco. Last season the lower fees saved the patrons of Paris market $36,000.8. We do not try to pinhookour customers, but do our best to give all thesame treatment and the best information at our command at all times. Last season we advised everybody to hold tobacco until January 1st. We now want toinform you that tobacco is very, very high in North Carolina, and judging ourmarket by that, as we have been able to do in the past, good bright tobacco willbe very high in Kentucky. The apparent large per cent, of low grade tobacco inthis crop has a tendency to make us apprehensive of lower prices for commontobacco, though we are glad to note a very considerable advance in low gradesupon hogshead market in the past ten days.9. It will pay you to put your tobacco over the floor. The speculatorwho offers to buy expects to make money and is probably better posted thanyou.10.

LOCK ASSISTING INCROSS CAMPAIGN.BED559 CHAIBKAN OF mOOPAL CgSpUJH CAMPAIGHMrs. Wilson Stilwell has been -pointedchairman in the Paris parisnto, aid the campaign to raise ?30'2,-iT n three yeara in ttte LexingtonDiocese of the Episcopal Church.The canvass here is a part of thenationwide campaign to further theinterests of the church.Mrs. Stilwell will be gUd to explain to any interested the workthat will be done, how the money isto be pledged and give further information concerning the work. Itis believed that Paris will be promptin pledging its share in this greatmovement The amount asked ineach parish is comparatively small.The Paris quota will be announcedin a few days.In 1919, the Lexington Diocesehas received from the Board of Missions $6,000 and contributed to theboard just ?2,911.50. See what adifference there is in what has beengiven and what has been received?In 1920, the Iiexington Diocese expects to receive from the MissionsBoard $95,618.64, and it is asked tocontribute only 118,935. Plain figures show the Lexington Diocese receives more than it gives.The funds raised in this campaignwill go toward increasing the general work of the church all over thediocese, for development of MargaretCollege for Girls at Versailles andSt. John's Institute and "WentworthFarm at Corbin. It is hoped toplace three new diocesan missionaries in the field and to build a community home for the negro congregation of St. Andrew's Church, Lexington. The work of the church is spreading, and its influence is daily growing in power. But it must havehelp, just as any other movementmust. The churches of the Episcopalian Institutions in this diocesehave a record to be proud of anywhere, and the scope of its activityis unlimited.rtTJpn &7xm3gmjkm tPDr. J. S.

Strength comes from food. Thelack of food means a lack ofstrength, and, since appetite influences the amount of -food you eat,then appetite is necessary to strength.Nutrition, which gives strength tothe body, must be taken from thefood brought by the appetite into thestomach. If the digestive organs arepoor and do not take sufficient nutrition from the food you eat, thenyour body and vital organs graduallyweaken from lack of nourishment.Blood is the carrier of nutrition tovarious tissues and parts of .the body,and to the liver, kidneys, bladder andother organs. If the blood becomesthin and watery it can not carry asufficient amount, of nutrition, ndthe body all over and the variousvital organs starve and weaken.Neryes direct the carrying of .nutrition by the blood. When the nerveago wrong the body all over suffersand grows weaker.Good appetite, good, digestion, goodblood, good nerves those four thingsbring strength, and Vola-Tonic,"Builder of Strength," brings -thosefour things.Vola-Tonic tones up the "stomachand cleanses the bowels and intestines of foul waste matter. It bringsthe weakened, rundown man or woman a normal, healthy appetite. VolaTonic then helps the digestive organstake strengthening nutrition from thefood you eat and it builds up rich,red blood to carry this nutrition tothe starving, weakening organs andparts of the body that are crying outfor it Vola-Tonic soothes andstrengthens the nerves so that theycan perform their duties as theyshould, and it brings, sound, restfulsleep at night.As the use of Vola-Tonic is continued the body and .system is builtup to full, normal strength, and theformer weakened, rundown man orwoman feels better aH over.Good appetite, good digestion, goodblood, good lierves get those fourthings and you will get good health.They affect every vital organ, everytissue, every part of the body.Vola-Tonic, "Builder of Strength,"brings those four things.SUPPLY OF VOLA-TONIC IS TOBE GIVEN LOCAL PEOPLE FREEEverybody Is Urged to ActQuickly,SEND IN COUPON NOWRequests Will Be Honored inOrder Received.Vol Remedies Company announced to-day that they will giveaway, absolutely free of charge, alimited supply of their wonderfulpreparation, Vola-Tonic, "Builder ofStrength."

Particularlynoticeable is "the frequency withwhich" it bears upon the novelty ofhaving real comic opera here instead of having to go somewhereto it.We have received a press sheetcontaining half a hundred clippings from well-known papers incities like our own, from which itis clearly evident that Ralph Dunbar,, the producer of "Robin Hood"is making good with his pretentious project.With the advent of prosperity andhigh speed in every branch of industry and commerce, Mr. Dunbardecided that the application of theprincples of high class merchandising, often summarized as "the squaredeal" to the problem of deliveringhigh-class operatic productionswould win enough supporters tomake them pay out, and it seemstobe workine: that way. This ."allL brings assurance that an. entertaining event may be expected in mecoming "Robin Hood," which willmerit the attendance of every loverof comic opera.0FRVITS,-NiJTSt CANDIES, CIGAKS.Let usm fill your order or fow.fruits,-nuts,, box candies in box andbulk;-fltte imported uigareucs anuLciM:s. tttvwt(X) JfltA-WiV DJilJ-.

The yearly interest on the war debt, however, is?1, 017, 500,000, which sum alone isgreater than all the appropriationsfor all purposes whatsoever of anypeace-time Congress.All in all, the estimates justifythe predictions made on the floor ofCongress during, consideration ofwar tax bills, that the present generation would not see the Governmentconducted at an expense of less than$4,000,000,000 a year.The estimated appropriations forthe principal Government departments were presented as follows:Legislative (Congress), $9,025297.25. Executive (White House and Government departments), $149,111,463.77. Judicial, $1,634,190.Army, $989,578,657.20.Navy, $542,031,804.80.Pensions, $215,030,000.Public works, $283,921,810.17.Miscellaneous, $833,717,637.96.Foreign intercourse, $11,243,250.91. The total of all estimates, including some comparatively minoritems not included in the foregoing,is $4,865,410,031.62, the greatestsum ever asked of any Congresswhen the country was not actuallyat war.The billion dollar estimate for thearmy includes some $85,000,000 forthe National guard. Normal peacetime estimate for the army beforethe war was between 10 and 15 millions. The $542,600,000 estimatefor the navy includes provision forthe programme of increase and iscomparable to an annual estimate ofsome $15,000,000 before the war.NURSE OFFERSOPINION OFTONIC'S MERIT'Trutona Worked Like Magic InMy Case," Mrs. KitcheyAsserts.btstpnik hisimoh0 ."Knew we'd get together"Ches.

Inorder that every bit of informationbe made available, Manager Sprakecheerfully invites inquiry and enendeavors to inform the public accurately. "Bobin Hood" was produced byRalp-h Dunbar, the Chicago purveyorof musical entertainment, with ttieassistance and co-operation of Reg-I inold De Jvoven, the famous composer of the opera. The leading soprano role is in the hands of Katherine Galloway, one of Kentucky'sfairest daughters, whose place ofeminence as a singing actress is sure.She . starred three seasons with theHenry W. Savage productions, coming to "Robin Hood" last Februaryfor the big revival.The principal baritone is JamesStevens, who interprets "LittleJohn." Mr. Stevens sung principalroles with Century and Abron companies in New York before Mr. Dunbar prevailed on him to join hisI forces, and the manager accreditshim as being one of the really greatAmerican operatic singers. Thingsequally commendatory can be said ofthe other eight principal singers of,Wie cast, as well as the chorus andorcheslia, were there space.START A SAVINGS ACCOUNT ATPEOPLES DEPOSIT BANKTHF Al AMIA AMU UAIII fillAMII ' Aim tt An AflUlls i0C pius iC Wir liX-; ; 2ecA"mfc r-Tfcl B rLl mW -vihwhv -w mi m- 11 nwlUIOOlvUtChildren and Gallery9c plus lc'war tax....iQcTODAY, FRIDAYWILL RODGERSIN"Almost a Husband"Comedy, drama and pathos combineto make to make this one of the finest entertainment treats of the year.
