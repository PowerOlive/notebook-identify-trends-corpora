Taint
Here is a case of inherited blood taint
which resulted in what threatened to be
a complete wreck of an innocent young
life The most serious feature of being
afflicted with a blood disease is the fact
that innocent posterity must suffer The
man or woman with the slightest taint
in the blood forces the undesirable leg
acy of impurity upon their children
whose veins flow with the impure inher
itance which handicaps them in the race
ef life
No child who has a trace of bad blood
can be healthy or strong and those pre
disposedto Scrofula are liable to a great
deal of sickness because their constitu
tions are weak and cannot withstand the
many dangers which beset the path of
childhood Medical statistics show that
a majority of lung troubles result directly
from Scrofula so that a child afflicted
with this disease is likely to fall a vic
tihj to dreaded consumption
Mr W A Clayton of Addie N C
believes SSS ie the only blood remedy
which can have any effect whatever
upon obstinate cases He says
My three-year-old boy had the worst
case of Scrofula I ever heard of He
MR W A CLAYTON
was given many blood remedies without
relief and treated by the best doctors
He seemed to get worse all the while
however and the disease finally resulted
in curvature of the spine making him
utterly helpless
The bad sores on his neck increased
in size and were a source of constant
pain He was in this pitiful condition
for two years when some one recom
mended SSS stating that it had cured
some of the worst cases of blood diseases
As soon as his system was under the ef
fect of the medicine the sores began to
get better and in eight days were com
pletely healed Before long he could
walk on crutches and was improving
every day In three months he threw
aside his crutches for he had no further
use for them the dreadful disease had
been eliminated entirely from his sys
tem and he was restored to perfect
health The cure was a permanent one
as no sign of the disease has returned
ibr tea years
SSS is a real blood remedy and
promptly reaches all deep seated and
obstinate blood diseases it matters not
what other treatment has failed It is
the only remedy which acts on the cor
rect principle of forcing the disease from
the system and getting rid of it perma
nently
S S S is a sure cure for Scrofula
Cancer Catarrh Eczema Rheumatism
Tetter and all other blood diseases It is
Purely Vegetable
and is the only remedy guaranteed to
contain no potash mercury or other
harmful mineral

LINCOLN AT GETTYSBURG
Account
of How He First Wrote His
Famous Speech
Speaking of the dedication of the na
tional cemetery at Gettysburg and Mr
Lincolns famous address delivered on
that occasion Nov 19 1868 Governor
Curtin began by saying that there had
been much discussion as to and
when that address was written arid he
continued says The Independent
I can tell you all about that Of
course I was there and the president
and his cabinet had arrived and were
at the hotel Soon after his arrival as
we were sitting around in the parlor
Mr Lincoln looked thoughtful for a
moment or two and then said I be
lieve gentlemen the committee are ex
pecting me to say something here to
day If you will excuse me I will go
into this room here and prepare it
After a time he returned holding in
his hand a large yellow government
envelope on which he had written his
address
Here gentlemen he said I want
to read this to you to see if it will do
And sitting down he read it to us and I
then said Now for your criticisms
Will it do What do you say
Several spoke in favor of it and
one or two commended it in strong
terms Well says the president
havent you any criticisms What do
you say Seward
Mr Seward made one or two sug
gestions bearing on some slight verbal
changes which I believe Mr Lincoln
incorporated
Now if you will allow me gentle
men continued the president I will
copy this off And he again withdrew
made a copy of the address
Ah continued the governor if I
had had wit enough about me to have
begged of him that yellow envelope
what a trophy it would have been 1 How
much it would have been worth to some
of the ladies fairs which a little later
began to be held to raise money for the
hospitals and the soldiers But I did
not think of it then
HUMOR AND ITS USES
It Is the Sunshine of the World hut May
Be Overworked
Humor is the very sunshine of the
world writes Carrie E Garrett in
The Womans Home Companion
Hardly any other single gift will go
so far to refresh and inspire one in
everyday life and keep the heart still
young It steals merrily across the
workaday world animating the drear
iest monotony and finding place in the
most hopeless destiny Such a gay trav
eling companion is humor for the pil
grimage of life
The woman with a sense of humor
has a safeguard against ennui against
folly and against despair She can never
be dull so Jong as the comedy of life is
being played before her eyes With a
keen sense of the ridiculous she isjiot
-likely to make a fool of herself ind
she will never be hopelessly unhappy
for she will find in the most adverse
fate something still to laugh at -and
after all laughter is your true alchemist
However it may be with the unmusical
person surely the surly individual who
cannot laugh spontaneously on occasions
is fit for treasons strategems and spoils
But this blessed gift of humor should
be used to lift the shadows of life not
to deepen them A joke which causes
another a pang of humiliation or makes
some sensitive heartache is not only a
cruel sort of amusement but it is also
a very expensive indulgence For just a
moments gratification at having made
a hit the funny woman may forever
lose a friend and may even arouse a
very genuine spirit of enmity We learn

frequent desire to urinate or pain in the

WHAT TO DO
There is comfort in the knowledge so often
expressed that Dr Kilmers Swamp Root
the great kidney remedy fulfills every wish
in relieving pain in the back kidneys liver
bladder and every part of the urinary pas
sages It corrects inability to hold urine and
scalding pain in passing i or bad effects fol

compelled to get up many times during the
night to urinate The mild and the extraor

Hurt No One and No One Hurt Him
At the battle of Chickamauga I saw
a fellow shooting straight up in the air
and praying as lustily as ever one of
Cromwells roundheads prayed
The Presbyterians of 1646 prayed
loud and sang hymns in battle but they
shot straight at the cavaliers every
time This fellow was blazing away at
the sky and when Lieutenant Killing
worth remonstrated with him about it
he paid no attention to him whatever
Captain Joe Billingsley threatened tq
cut him down with his sword if hd
didnt shoot at the enemy for thewooda
in front were full of them He merely
remarked to the captain You can kill
me if you want to but I am not going
to appear before my God with the blood
of my fellow man on my soul
He never flinched but stood squarely
up exposed to every volley of the ene
mys fire When the sun set on the
evening of Sept 18 1863 Captain J C
Billingsley and Lieutenant Allen Kill
ingworth both lay dead on the battle
field of Chickamauga and E went
