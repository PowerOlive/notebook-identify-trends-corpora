COUNTY COURT 0RDEHS
Physicians claim there is nothing
that will increase weight, strength
and endurance like organic phos
phate commonly known by druggists
as argo-phosphate; it is inexpensive
and is sold by all leading druggists
everywhere under a " guarantee to
give satisfaction or money refunded.
Weakness and thinness are usually
due to starved nervous conditions.
Our bodies need more phosphates
than are contained in the foods we
eat.
If you wish a more rounded figure
and plump well-developed arms,
neck and bust in place of hollows
you should simply take plain argo
phosphate, as it builds up and re
stores run-down, nervous conditions
by phosphatizing the system. It
tiansforms the appearance and an
increase in weight it oftentimes
quickly produced.
The increase in weight also aids
in improving the general health.
Sleeplessness, nervousness, lack of
energy and ambition quickly disap
pear. Pale cheeks are changed to rosy
ones and dull eyes become bright.
Miss Lena Brown of Atlanta, Ga.,
who only weighed 90 pounds reports
that she gained 10 pounds in twe
weeks time and says argo-phosphate
has made a different person of her
and she has never felt better in hei
life.
SPECIAL NOTICE Owing to the
fact that so many physicians and
druggists are recommending argo
phosphate for relieving all nervous,
worn-out debilitated conditions and
the unusually large sale for argo
phosphate there will be found in
in the market numerous substitutes
for the genuine ariicle. All imita
tions are inferior preparations and
owing to its ususual flesh producing
qualities it should not be used by
any one unless they desire to put on,
flesh and increase in weight.
