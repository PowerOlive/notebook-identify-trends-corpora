F. Spears & Sons Wednesdaynight about 10:30 o'clock destroyedthe x building together with its contents, entailing a loss variously estimated at from $3Q,000 to $50,000.The fire was discovered by one ofthe workmen who saw the smokeissuing from the floor above, where hewas engaged at work, and giving thealarm, all of the men employed inthe building made an effort to checkits progress by the use of hand extinguishers which were maintained inthe building.An alarm of fire was sent in andthe department responding readily,made a heroic effort to cofine theflames to the top floor, but withoutresult. The highly inflamable matterstored in this section of the buildingsoon got beyond the control of thefiremen who then devoted their energies to saving the adjoining property. The fire is supposed to have resulted from a spontaneous combustion. On the third floor of the buildingwas 'stored hundreds of barrels of fancy cleaned grass seed and this being rapidly consumed, the flames werecommunicated to the other portionsof the building.Heat from the fire was so intensethat the firemen experienced greatdifficulty in getting close enough to ithe burning building to check theflames, and immense volumes of water were poured on the blazing massfrom adjoining buildings and fromlines of hose across the railroad track.At one time during the height ofthe fire it looked as though the building occupied by Hutchcraft & Brtntand which contained a large quantityof grass seed, besides expensivemachinery,- and the Louisville andNashville freight depot across therailroad track would be destroyed. The large grain elevator of Tt.B. Hutchcraft and the warehouse ofSpears & Soiu. facing on Pleasantstreet were in danger of having thefire communicated to them by showersof sparks that were sent skywardwhen the floors of the cleaning plantcollapsed.Firemen on the roof the building ofHutchcraft & Brent in the face of theintense heat poured water into theseething furnace and on the adjoiningbuildings. So effective was their workafter it was seen to be impossible tosave the plant that the stable only afew feet from the burned buildingwas not damaged.The plant of E. F. Spears & Son wasthe most complete in the world, being one of five in existence, threeof which are operated in this city,one in Winchester and one in Lexington. It was equipped with the mostmodern machinery- used in cleaninggrass seed and only recently severalnew appliances were installed.It has been in constant operationfor the past several months, only ashort time ago the firm finishing thecleaning of the immense crop of grassseed from last season, which consumed all of the winter months and whenthe present crop was harvested theplant continued to run to clean thecrop of the present season.When the fire was at its height itwas almost impossible for spectators toget within a square of the building sointense was the heat from the flameswhich leaped high into the air, illuminating the sky to such an extentthat it could be easily seen for a distance of eight miles in the country.It is said the equipment of theplant was fully insured. The members of the firm will not give anjr information as to their future plans, butit is rumored they contempate rebuilding at an early date a concretestructure upon the site of the formerbuilding.Workmen were engaged yesterdaymorning in tearing down the brickvtslls a the side of the building zoixto the railroad ad removing the debris. The codition of the wails weresuch as to render them unsafe, and itwas feared they might fall at anymoment."WE KNOW HOW"If You Have '$10 to .SpendJust come to this store and invest it in oneof these two-piece Summer Suits which we areselling for a "Ten-Spot."If you want to see real values just glanceat our windows and you will be convinced thatwe can give you a better suit than can be purchased at any other store in town for a greatdeal more money.These suits are all well made and trim-med.

M. Campbell of Darlington,Ind., has been engaged to judge thepoultry classes.Heretofore the pigeon departmenthas been under the management ofthe poultry department, but throughthe interest of the wideawake pigeonbreeders of this section the management of the Blue Grass Fair has appointed a committee of the foremostpigeon breeders of this section andplaced the pigeon department in theirhands, which assures a big show under pioper management.Mr. George Feather of Boston,Mass., has been engaged as judge anda winning here will mean as much asat any state fair in the country.

Every attentionwill be given birds not accompaniedby owners, so, in making an entryhere, you can rest assured that yourbirds will be well cared for.MARVELOUS PUZZLEPICTURE AT THE FAIR"The Shadow of the Gross"Secured (or Art Lovers, .Lovers of art and those interestedin phenomena will have an opportunity of a life time when "The Shadowof the Cross," the great unfinished,mysterious painting, is placed on exhibition at the Blue Grass Fair thisyear.Seen in the light, there is a fulllength standing figure of the Christ,one hand resting across his breast,the other hanging by his side. Of allthe famous paintings of the Saviour,perhaps none other so conveys theclearness of his realization, the pathosof his resignation, and he-brings innearer touch than ever before thepeace vouchsafed to all mankind.Seen in the dark, the figure ofChrist appears to be walking in thepale moonlight, an effect of lightwhich no human hand can paint, andnow one feels himself in the presenceof the man as he was in the Gardenof Gethsemane. Above and behindthe figure hovers a dark cross, andthis is what first suggested the famous title, "The Shadow of the Cross."At the World's Fair, St. Louis, inCormack's chapel, in the Irish village,the painting registered more paid admissions than any attraction at thefair. It received a gold medal. Thedaily papers were pleased to state,"It is the only real novelty at theWorld's Fair." It also received goldmedals at the Jamestown Exposition'and the Alaskan-Yukon-Pacific Exposition at Seattle, Wash.SPEED PROGRAMRunning Races Provided ForEachDay of Blue Grass Fair.An excellent speed program hasbeen arranged for the Blue Grass Fairat Lexington, week of Aug. 11 to 16.On each of the six days there willbe running races and harness racingon every day but Saturday.

It is the most important race before the voters for theirdecision. The County Judge is by virtue of his position the presiding officer of the Fiscal Court, and one of theduties of the Fiscal Court is the building and maintenance of the roads ofthe county which the traveling publichave the right to use, and in view ofthe amount of taxes which have beenpaid by the people of this county, theright to expect them to be in good contion. How the present administratioa of the affairs of the county, headed by the present County Jugde,Dennis Dundon, has discharged thismost important duty, is a matter ofsupreme importance to every sovereign voter who goes into the bftothto cast his vote at the coming primary.That Judge Dundon's attministration inthis particular has been a conspicuousfailure needs noproof. It is a matterof public knowledge and common observation. We have no personal grievance against Judge Dundon, but whena candidate who has filled an officeoffers for re-election, what he has donein office is not only a matter of publicconcern, but it is the duty of everyvoter in the county to know how hehas discharged liis duty in office sothat he may know what to expect ofthat officer if he lends that officer hissupport In the past, many administrations have come and gone withinoar personal experience, and s"b far as"we lmow or can learn, the first timein the history of the county that thesubject of bad management of theturnpikes of Bourbon county was madethe object of an investigation and report by a grandoury of Bourbon county-occurred during the present administkB"and as late as last March, 1913,and yet in the face 4of that reportJudge Dundon, the head of the court,owes forward to claim the support oftke voters of this county.But let the grand jury of Bourbonocmaty, in the discharge of the duty itQ-wefl to the tax payers of Bourbon4Hinty, make its own statement inite own way on the subject."Your grand jury has made a thorough investigation of the condition ofthe public roads of the county, andhave very serious fault to find withthe manner in which, it is kept, the results received for the amount of moneyexpended, aad the general handlingof the county's business in this regard.We have examined a number of witBMses and from our personal knowledge find that a large per cent, of purturnpikes are in a deplorable condition.Some of these have had practically norepairs made upon them for the pasttwo or three years."We have compared our turnpikesritk the turnpikes of other countieshaving practically the same road fundper mile available and find that thefiscal courts and supervisors of thesecounties have been able to keep theirroads in satisfactory condition andthat their condition is strong evidencethat there is something' greatly atfault with the manner in which themoney of our county is expended andthe work done upon the roads. Weare thoroughly convinced from theevidence at hand that these conditionsare caused by the neglect of the Fiscal Court and Road Supervisors. Wefind that practically no personal attention is given to the condition of the' roads or to the manner of their up. keep by the Fiscal Court or the RoadSupervisors. .i "Again we find that some of the'roads of the county have been shownpreference over other roads in thecounty in regard to the amount ofi money expended for their up-keep andrepair. We find no jusifiable reasonfor this."BOOKS CLOSED LAST NIGHTON PRIMARY CANDIDIATES.The books on the Democratic andRepublican primary candidates closedwith midnight last night, and CountyClerk Pearce Paton was kept busy-until a late hour filling petitions.Three Republicans appear amongthe list of candidates to be voted forai the August primary D.

Mr. HenryButler, the oldest child of Mr. andMrs. Butler, died infthis city a fewweks ago.In the last issue of the BourbonNews appeared a request from a subsscriber from Centerville for us to republish an article that appeared in aFrankfort or neighboring city paper, inin regard to a meeting of the CountyJudges' Convention which met inFrankfort last fall.The article referred to has been located. It appeared in the AndersonCounty News, of which Hon. JessieAlverson is the editor. Mr. Alversonis a son-in-law of Mr. J. G. Allen, ofMillersburg. The article referred tois as follows:"At the County Judges' and CountyAttorneys' meeting at Frankfort lastFriday, Judge Dennis Dundon, of thecounty of Bourbon, presided over thedeliberations of that body, which wereof supreme importance to the State ingeneral, and to our sorrowwe neversaw a man preside over a body of intelligent gentlemen and Kentuckianswith as little dignity and as little regard for their feelings, when wantingto speak, and speaking, as did thisman Dundon. At every juncture, heseemed to 'mistake impudence forwit' and made as complete an 'ass' outof himself as one could make for thetime-being. Dundon evidently thoughthe was presiding over a lot of 'hoodlums or 'bums' from the undignifiedmanner and sarcasm that he showedthe members of the above association on the occasion mentioned. Ifhe pleases the citizenship of Bourbon,they are undoubtedly easily pleasedfrom an outsider's standpoint."ENTERS PLEA OF GUILTY.The trial of the Commonwealth vs.Walther C.

If a basket ofraffia is planned for a room furnishedin a definite color raffia in matchingor harmoniously contrasting shadecan be bought.ne of the useful things which theraffia worker can make for the summer house is small flower holders.These are really no more than littlebaskets fitted with glass or chinadishes to hold water, but they are veryeffective.A pair of them on dressing table ordesk gives an artistic touch to awhole room, and they can be effectively placed in any bare spot. Theyare especially good for holding suchshort stemmed flowers as pansies,nasturtiums, forget-me-nots, annuallarkspur, small roses, alyssum, candytuft and English daisies.These little baskets can be made tofit about old and handleless cups ordeep saucers. In either case the basket should be narrowed above the topof the dish to a vide neck, and thenshould flare at the top. This shapesthe basket like a vase and gives goodsupport for the flower stems.For these baskets the raffia can bewound about either heavy cord ordamp willow. Lazy squaw stitch isthe easiest and most quickly accomplished of all stitches.Small mats for holding water glasses on the bare table, to take the placeof coasters, larger mats for holdingwater carafe, teapot or water jug, baskets of various sizes and shapes forcard trays, work baskets and catchallsand large, flat baskets with long handles for garden and flower baskets areall useful and interesting things tomake with a bunch of raffia.RIBBON RUCHES FORUtTQi irIOHome Millinery Is Greatly Assistedby the Reappearance of ThisFashion.The fashion of ribbon ruches as hattrimmings has reappeared, and is usually adapted to mourning hats. Homemillinery is greatly assisted by thisand by the ready-made leaves andflowers sold in the shops. Ostrichruches for hats also save much trou-ble to the home milliner. The vul -ture mount, less graceful than the os -trich feather, is easily adjusted.Lancer feathers, though not so fashionable as they have been, are stillin considerable demand, and, apparently, are much cheaper than theywere when every smart woman considered that she ought to have atleast one of her hats trimmed withthem. The straight brimmed sailorshape seems to be the favorite at thepresent moment, but toques are alsofashionable and can be much more becoming than any other style.RIBBON TRIMMINGSThe darker hat is of black andwhite striped straw with ,a smoothfacing of black velvet around thebrim. The bow of black moire ribbonis placed at an effective angle againstthe uprolled brim.The white hat is of plain wood fiberwith a simply arranged bow ofbright or silk ribbon, held in front bya cluster of silk fruit, showing brightred and green shades.Keeping Buttons On.If buttons tear away from a woolensweater or woolen fabric, try sewingthem on with a small linn button on1the wrong side. Pass the needlethrough both, buttons at on time.Violin Notes Attract Mosquito.In somg parts of India, wheref mosquitoes abound, it is impossible toplay' the violin because the music attracts the insects in grpat numbers.When the first notes are heard, themosquitoes swarm in clouds aroundthe player and make the movementsof the hand impossible.Explaining Why They Got Married.In New York recently a lot of postcards were mailed to married men asking them why they had married.Among the replies was one from a manwho -vrote: "Please don't stir me up."Another man answered: "I yearnedfor company. We now have companyall the time her folks."At Least Something New.First Mother "How was the babyshow?" Second Mother "Fair. Ofcourse, there is not much change inthe style, but the display of accessories, such as five-minute detachablenighties, cry mufflers, and self-startingcradles was particularly good." -REPORT OF THE CONDITION OF THEPEOPLES BANKat the close of business on the 30th day of June, 1913.Begun business October 17th, 1912.'

Of course, any sortof chiffon veil can he 3atisfactorilycleaned in gasoline, hut it is ratherunpleasant to have anything cleanedin this way come in close contact withthe skin of the face.When a washable chiffon veil is soiled fold it neatly and tack the foldssecurely with' basting thread. Thenwash the veil carefully in soapy water and rinse it in salt water to set. the color. Press the folded veil betweena couple of heavy bath towels to getthe water out, and doot wring it atall.When as much water has been pressed out as it is possible to get out cutthe bastings and-pull them out. Layone edge of the veil straight on theironing board and iron it dry with amoderately hot iron. Then iron eachof thw other sides dry, and then ironthe middle of the veil until it, too, isdry. By ironing the edges first theveil can be ironed without stretchingor pulling out of shape.Lay the veil fiat on a bed for anhour or two after it is ironed. If itis ironed in this way it will keep itsshape and will not wrinkle easily.3$9SaS85$S3$S$SfC9$5eSG9BEAUTIFUL GOWN4WmX kkr-Low Roundlripfrom Paris toFaresNew York & Boston30 day limit Tourist fares toNew York $28.0060 day limit variable route fares toNew York $31.95 Boston $35.55Reduced round trip fares to many other cities and resorts in the EastSuperior Service to the EastForparticulars, rates, folders, descriptiveliterature and sleeper reservations, addressW.

What isthe woman who must wear a streetsuit for a part of every day of thesummer going to do, the woman whogoes back and forth to business, perhaps, or who, for some other reason,must spend much time in street carsor trains?Ratine seems to be a good substitutefor other lightweight materials for thesummer knockabouts. Its price by theyard is expensive, but it is wide. Agood quality selling for $1.50 measures66 inches, and of this width not morethan three and a half or four yardswill be needed for a coat and skirt.Ratine, of couse, has not the crisp-,ness of 'linen and crash, but it is moderately cool, and, if made carefully,looks light and summery. It showscreases and wrinkles hardly so muchas serge does. The blue, green andother dark shades suitable for streetwear do not soil easily and, when theyare soiled, can be laundered withoutstarch.A ratine suit, with shirtwaists ofcotton crepe, voile or tub sliks, wouldmake an ideal working outfit for thesummer woman, an outfit at oncedurable, suitable,- comfortable and instyle.Gift for Bridesmaids.

Animals never forget. "I know of two little boys and anold family mare, not an unusual combination on most farms. This old marehas often been teased by one littleboy, and when he comes near she laysback her ears, and with flashing eyesand snapping teeth tries to get at him.Some time when he is off his guardperhaps the chance will come, andwho knows what will happen?"The other lad always petted andplayed with the old mare and talkedto her, and she will come to him andfollow him anywhere. When she ishitched up he can drive her any place,and she always obeys every word hesays. But he will never tease her, andshe shows her gratitude in her onlyway."Teasing colts, horses or other dumbanimals shows a streak of hiddenmeanness and should not be permitted.It also spoils the disposition of theanimal; and it would be utterly uselessfor them in after years to try to doanything with the embittered animaland expect entire success. Bruteforce may compel obedience for atime, but how much better to havethem act from motives of affectionthan fear."""

But think of the land flyers who have time enough to preparefor a journey to the moon. The successors to Jules Verne have figured itall out for the French Society of Physics. The egine for the aeroplane imustbe of 414,000 horsepower. Thiswould propell a machine weighing aton to the moon in forty-eight and onehalf hours. It would take twentyfour miutes and nine seconds 'to setout of the circle of the earth's attraction. Before the force of the moon'sgravity would be encountered therewould be an interval of forty-eighthours and and fifty-eight seconds oftravel in nothingness. The slack-uppreparatory to landing on the moonwould require three minutes and fortysix seconds.These figures remind one of thework of Benjamine Price, the mathematician who published a book thathad a sale of approximately 100 copiesand that number represented the totalof persons who could comprehend itPrice need to calculate the weight ofthe moon as a diversion, and nodoubt would have reveled in theproblem submitted to the French physicists.EGG WITHIN AN EGG.An egg broken at the home of MackHammonds, Nicholas county, wasfound found to contain a smaller perfectly formed egg.
