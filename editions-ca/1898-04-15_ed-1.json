MY FRIEND FROM INDIA
That clever farce Aly Friend from
India which wiil be seen here Wed
nesday night is delighting large
audiences this week at the Grand in
Cincinnati The Enquirer says There
is no reason to the farce but for humor
ous situations it can boast of more than
any other piece of like nature before the
public and whatever literary merit the
farce may lack is entirely lost sight of in
the laughter which its absurdities
arouse This is the sole recommenda
tion which the piece possesses and it is
sufficient If theatre goers are desirous
ot enjoying a really lunny farce they
should not miss this opportunity The
story or slender plot to My Friend
from India is too well known to be re
called at this time
John Fox recently had an unpleasant
experience while in Breathitt county to
get material for a new story He came
down the Kentucky river on a logging
raft to Valley View where he spent the
night He arose at four oclock Sunday
morning and walked to Nicholasville to
catch an early train to Lexington only
to find that the train did not run on
Sundays He finally got to Lexington
however and donned his store clothes
once more
