Coy, writing in Leslie'sMagazine says:Pyrethum powder burnt in a housestupefies a fly until you can sweep himup and put him where he belongs. Alittle of this burnt in the rooms in themorning, after which the rooms shoulbe aired will make the house exempt from flies all day. Twenty dropsof carbolic acid dropped on a hotshovel or on any piece of warm ironcreates a vapor that lays flies low.The common mignonette plant grownin jars and placed in a room makesthings unpleasant for the flies. A dandy thing is the white clover. It isstrange,but flies hate the odor ofwhite clover. Have a little of thisaround in a vase and you will noticethat the flies have business in otherdirection. This clover should be renewed etfery day or so, for when itbecomes dry it irritates the nostrils.A cheap-and effective poison, not dangerous to the human life, is bichrorate of potash in solution. Onedrachm dissolved in two ounces ofsweetened water and placed in shallow dishes will call the roll for anynumber of pests. Another remedy forall purposes has few equals is a solution of formaline or formaldehydein water. A spoonful of this liquid ina quarter of a pint of water left exposed in a room will make the flies scarcein a very short time. Flies are sensative io light; keep.1;he window curtains drawn, all except one little slit,and they will gravitate toward it.Then you can easily drive them outside."Merchant of Venice," at P. H.

Following is an extract: "The commonest site of cancer inmen is the mouth region, particularlythe lips or tongue at the time whichthe teeth are beginning to be lost andthe jaws to shrivel in consequence,and nearly three-fifths of cancers thatoccur in women develop in the organsof reproduction, the uterus and mammary glands after the menopause, orchange of life. Hence, we know thatit is well to pay early and prompt atattention to warts, fissues or chroniculcers, jagged or projecting teeth inmen between forty-five and sixty, andto any pains, hemorrhages, or seriousdisturbances in women near or justfollowing the change of life."Although several forms of cancercan be readily transmitted from onecase to another in mice, in chickens,and several other animals, all the attempts to discover the organism orgerm of the process, or to find validevidence of infection of one humanbeing with cancer from another casehave failed utterly. So that thereappears to be no reason at present forbelieving that the disease is eithercaused by a germ or is infectious orcontagious in any way; Those whohave charge of such cases have noreason to dread infection, althoughthe most scrupulous cleanliness andand all aseptic and antiseptic precautions should be taken."Mt.

The Latonia racetrack, which is situated just acrossthe Ohio river from Cincinnati, is oneof the most beautiful race courses inthe West. The pari mutuel systemof betting is in vogue at Latonia, andthis system gives the small better achance to win a fortune. In fact foursmall fortunes were given away therelast spring on a two-dollar bet. Inthe last race on June 17, 1912, a fillynamed Wishing Ring won the race,and each holder of a two-dollar ticketwas paid the sum of $1,880.50 whenhe presented his ticket to he cashedat, the cashier's office. This is thelargest winning ever recorded in theworld on a mutuel ticket. Only fourtwo-dollar tickets were sold on thishorse in a pool of more than $7,000,eo it can he readily seen how eachdollar won nearly $1,000.The peculiar thing about the running of this race was that the holdersof these tickets knew nothing at allabout the horses, but were just at thetrack to enjoy a day's outing. Nodope, no workouts, no handicapping,were usea by these persons. Theyjust picked out their horse and bettheir two dollars on it. It is also anoteworthy fact that three out of thefour successful tcket holders were visitors in Cincinnati.Only one resident of that city waslucky enough to pick th-e winner. Oneof the holders was a lady from Chicago who was visiting Cincinnati andwas taken to the races by her host.Another holder was a man from Mt.Vernon, Ind., who came up to see whata horse race looked like, and the thirdout-of-town winner was a resident ofLouisville, Ky.This was not the only occasion thata small fortune was given away bymeans of the mutuel system of wagering. On May 7, 1910, a horse namedMuzetta W. won at Lexington, Ky.,and the holders oj two-dollar ticketswere paid $830.70 apiece. At theChurchill Downs track at Louisville,on May 13, 1911, a horse named JackParker won and paid the holders oftwo-dollar tickets $411.50 apiece. OnMay 2 of this year a horse named Silver Bill won at Lexington and theholders of two-dollar tickets were eachpaid the sum of $413.30.The winning of these sums is onlypossible where the mutuel system ofbetting is in vogue.

BroadwayLexinston, KentuckyCHAUTAUQUA GALLS USSouthern People by the ThousandDrawn Every Year for Rest, Sport,Intellectual Entertainment or Formal Study to Famous Resort inWestern New York.At this season of the year the headsof households begin to think of vacation for the wholej family, and placesline Vjuo.uiu.uquo,,New York, contend with otherquite unlikeplaces for our vacation choice.About 50,000 people vvisit Chautauqua each year forperiods rangingfrom an hour toseveral months.Perhaps 10,000 isthe average summer population, inwhich every statein the Union anda number Nof foreign countries arerepresented. TheSouthern contingent is particularChautauqua LakeSteamboat.ly strong."Chautauqua" is the name of fivetowns in the states of Illinois, Kansas,New York, Texas and Washington.In two instances the county bears thesame name. About five hundred communities in cottages or tents arecalled "Chautauqua," besides the altogether improper use of the word asapplied to series of Indoor meetings.The name is derived from an Indianphrase, the latest interpretation ofwhich' is that it refers to the muscallonge, for which the lake to thesouthwest of Buffalo, New York, isstill famous, and that it means "theplace where the fish was taken out."However that may be, the name wouldhave been as local as Mankato had itnot been for the activities set goingin 1874 by Lewis Miller and BishopJohn H. Vincent. But the fame ofthis place has encircled the world.Two Southern states, Kentucky andTexas, send more than a thousand persons each to Chautauqua every summer. Six Southern states contributemore than 500 persons each to thesummer population of this unique community in western New York. Barring one-day .visitors, there are asmany Southerners as New Yorkers atChautauqua every year.What is the force that draws solarge a number from this distance toa single locality? The cosmopolitancharacter of the attendance may havesome influence.. There are aboutas many Canadians q,s Virginiansat Chautauqua, and always asprinkling of foreigners from abroad,some of them distinguished persons. Southerners are not insensible of the mutual advantages of suchassociation. 'The tendency of birds ofa feather to "flock together," also,may be effective to some degree.Many Southerners doubtless go because so many others go. Another attraction is the delightful climate andscenic charm of the Chautauqua re- jgion, with its lake over 20miles inlength, at an altitude of 1,400 feetabove sea level, its exemption fromheat, malaria, mosquitoes, and otherthings that do annoy, and its comparatively easy access from Southernpoints. After all, however, these advantages might conceivably uniteelsewhere and the Chautauqua enthusiast will tell you that any other placewhere they should all be found wouldstill not be Chautauqua. Chautauquais not merely a community, it is an institution, and pervading the institution is a moral and intellectual force.A kindly trickster who diverts youwith chaff and then when you aren'tlooking slips good things into yourpockets, is the figure by which a wellknown speaker at Chautauqua illustrated the character of that institution. Then, if you don't appreciate thegood things after all, in any case theyneed not detract from your enjoymentof the trifles by which you were firstallured. Many go on enjoying thesefor a whole summer and never giye agreat deal of thought to other matters. Some are content with harmlessnothings for themselves, yet take satisfaction in seeing the treasures ofknowledge or moral benefit quietly introduced into the possession of theirwives and young people. This is asone's mind and circumstances may determine. There is, after all, nothing occult'or even obscure in the working of theChautauqua influence. It is what youtake it to be. If you see in Chautauqua merely a pretty, pleasant andhealthful place for outdoor life, wheresailing, launching, boating, fishing,bathing, baseball, tennis and roqueare popular and "Where those of sedentary inclination read, smoke, or playcheckers at the hotel or the club, thenyou have seen rightly as far as youhave gone. As a compromise midwaybetween Newport and the northwoods, you will find Chautauqua satisfactory. Hundreds do.If along with an innocent andwholesome outdoor life in a delightful climate you expect musical, literary and dramatic entertainers of aclean, unobjectionable and more thanusually talented order for the relaxation of evening hours; if you seekvariety of amusement for the childrenat all times under proper safeguardsof direction and restraint, you will notbe disappointed.Perhaps you crave, together withthe ase of do nothing days, opportunity for not too serious attentionto th discussion of present mattersof national or world-wide interest.

A greatdeal of public sentiment against the 'parlor match has been worked up, withthe thousand of distressing fatalitiesand the'millions of losses for whichits flying heads are responsible. Thebig match manufacturers have seenthe rising tide of sentiment and arenow ready to cooperate in enforcingreasonable restrictions to reduce thehazards of their product. Bills forbidding the use of the parlor matcheswere introduced in several' states thisyear. They were defeated as impracticable in some of their details, but intheir place a new measure has beenintroduced which lias been endorsedby the sponsors of original legislation.The bill will not be opposed by t"hematch manufacturers in general, although it materially increases theircosts, since they recognize the justiceof the charges made against the hazardous match.The new measure positively prohibits the manufacture, storage,sale anddistribution of white phosphorus single dipped strike anywhere matches ofthe type generally known as the parlormatch. It also prohibits the use of alltypes ' of matches which will ignitewhen stepped upon or will shoot offburning particles, the measure prescribing the degree of tenacity theheads must maintain to prevent thisfeature which has been responsiblefor the bulk of the match fires.The bill in addition to outlawing theparlor match, p'revents the marketingof defectve goods in boxes not plainly marked as such, which will put anend to the. common practice of manufacturers of selling defective matchesin job lots to the cheap retail tra'de.The bill also regulates the packingand storing of matches, together withthe 'number of matches in a box andthe number of boxes in a case, aswell as the size and material of thepacking cases, in these regards complying the regulation made by the Interstate Commerce Commission andthe Bureau for the transportation ofExplosives. The measure also corresponds with the city ordinance prepared by H. C. Henley,of the St. LouisFire Prevention Bureau, which regu-4 lates the sale and storage ofmatchesfrom the municipal standpoint.Tobacco Men to Meet.The 13th annual convention of theTobacco Association of the UnitedStates will be held at Richmond, Va.,June 5, 6 and 7th, at the Jefferson Hotel, where special rates for the occasion have been secured.The Richmond Tobacco Trade, withthe city of Richmond and the Chamber of Commerce, will be the host, andthe committees have arranged an attractive program, the chief features ofwhich will be asm oker a the JeffersonAuditorium, and an all day trip downJames River to Jamestown.Several distinguished speakers willpresentt matters of interest to thetrade.All tobacco men, including leaf dealers, warehousemen, manufacturers andagents for manufacturers and exporters, are urged to attend this greatmeeting.Tobacco men will be present fromevery section of the United States, aswell as from some of the foreign countries.
