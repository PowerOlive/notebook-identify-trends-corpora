.- TEE RAILROAD BULLETIN
THE NEWS has received a copy of
The Railway Bulletin, issued at Lou
isville5 by the United States Railway
Administration, as represented by the
Louisville & Nashville and other
roads entering there. The Bulletin
is full of newsy notes concerning the
doings in railway circles, and is a
very creditable publication. The
publication is issued under the su
pervision of Mr. W. L. Mapother,
Federal Manager of Railroads at Lou
isville. In the initial publication
The Bulletin says:
"Here we present to our readers
the initial issue of the United States
Railroad Administration Bulletin,
covering the lines within the juris
Uctioa of Federal Manager Map
oilier; "The purpose of this publication
is to make up better acquainted
among ourselves to furnish news of
a personal or general nature within
our own. organizations and to carry
information regarding the railroad
industry as a whole, including offi
cial information from the Central Ad
ministration in Washington.
"These columns will not be open
to propaganda of , any sort. The char
acter of the matter carried in this
issue will indicate in a general way
that of the issues which are to fol
low, excepting that we expect to see
the news section grow.
"In order to launch the initial
issue this month, the Federal Mana
gers were obliged to assemble and
prepare their "copy" within a few
days. Consequently it was necessary
to use almost entirely information
immediately availiable at headquarters-
and the first Bulletin does not
carry the wide variety of local items
which will be found in future num
bers The purpose is to have some
thing of interest from along each line
under Mr. Mapother's jurisdiction."

When Mr. Sparks Wilson, of North

ka, a short time ago, telling the
"home folks" that he was going on a

it is asserted by those in a position
to know and its headquarters will be
in Louisville.
Elwood Hamilton, present collector
in the Seventh District, will, it is
stated, be the collector. The two
Senators from Kentucky and some of
the Congressmen have made at least
a perfunctory effort to have the State
divided into two districts, but it is
said that the order for the consoli
dation of the Kentucky districts into
one, with headquarters in the Fed
eral building in Louisville, has al
ready been decided upon.
It is said that Commissioner Roper
offered Mr. Hamilton the post of
supervisor of collectors' offices at $6,
000 a year, which would have left
the way open for the appointment of
Charles J. Cronan, of Louisville, as
revenue collector for Kentucky, but
Mr. Hamilton declined the offer, it is
said, and will continue in the office
of collector at $6,000.
The revenue agent's office in each
district will be abolished and a chief
field officer under the direction of the
collector wil have charge of all field
work at a salary of $4,500 a year,
the amount now paid to collectors.

RED CROSS TO DISTRIBUTE
GAUZE TO HOSPITALS.
The American Red Cross is about
to distribute to the hospitals of the
United States aproximately 25,000,
000 yards of gauze, such distribution
being based upon data" procured and
recommendations made by the Ameri
can Hospital Association. Inquiries
have already been received from va
rious hospitals as to this possibility
of utilizing the services of Red Cross
workers in making up this material
into surgical dressings. Assisting
the civil hospitals of the country in
this manner is thoroughly in accord
with the present policies of the Red
Cross.
"Chapters will be urged," says a
report from Lake Division headquar
ters of the American Red Cross, "to
volunteer the services of their work
ers to local hospitals in making up
materials supplied by such hospitals
into the surgical dressings, hospital
garments or hospital supplies.
"By thus offering to hospitals the
service of Red Cross workers the
value of the contribution to be made
will be greatly increased and the Red
Cross will effectively demonstrate its
appreciation of co-operation given
during the stress of war."
These recommendations made
recently in a letter from F. C. Mon
roe, General Manager of the Ameri
con Cross at Washington, D. C, will
answer the questions which have
been asked from time to time as to
what the Red Cross is doing with this
material not in use at the time of the
signing of the armistice.
After trying for nearly five years,
the Germans are in Paris at last.
But they aren't boasting about it.
MUSIC TEACHERS TO MEET IN
LOUISVILLE.
A convention of the Kentucky

honor on Wednesday.
Mr. Georges Vigneti, Mr. Albert
d'Scheu Habberstro, Miss Myrtle
Critchfield, of the Lexington College
of Music, are all mentioned as being
on the program, and Dr. McVey,
President of the University of Ken
tucky, will give an address before the
convention on Thursday morning.
CUT THOSE WEEDS!
Is that weed patch yours? Cut
them down. The city is just as re
sponsible as a private owner, and
should not overlook an opportunity
to set an example for others to fol
low. Some vegetable matter may be
pretty and pleasing to the eye, and
yet be a menace to the health of the
community.
The Board of Health will enforce
the ordinance regarding the cutting
of weeds in the city. They must be
cut within five days from date of this
notice.

City Health Officer.

TRACTING GREAT INTEREST
The reports from all over Ken

man of the million dollar drive for
the Masonic Widows and Orphans'
Home, Indicate the liveliest interest
in the movement. People are writ
ing constantly to headquarters in

butions have been sent from the
Bourbon county lodges, with an as
surance of more to follow.
Larger numbers of applications for
admission to Masonic lodges are be
ing received than ever before in the
history of the order in Kentucky.
Since the close of the war there has
been unprecedented interest mani
fested in Masonic circles.
PEOPLE GATHERED HAIL AND
FROZE ICE CSEAM.
A terrific hail storm in the Big
White Oak neighborhood near Green
up, Ky., did damage to the growing
crops.
The hail fell for nearly an hour
and several people gathered it and
made ice cream practically about
all they will derive from this spring's
hard work. Corn and garden truck
were cut off to the ground, wheat and
oats were beaten into the soft earth,
pastures were ruined and young trees
were stripped of their limbs. The
storm had a path about a mile wide
and probably three miles in length
and all growing stuff was killed in. its
path.
Mr. and Mrs. Stanhope Wiede
mann, of near Paris, are receiving
congratulations upon the new arrival

to Mrs. Wiedemann at the Good
