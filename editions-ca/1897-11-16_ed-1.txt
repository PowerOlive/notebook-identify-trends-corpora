Roadsand Thus Perish MiserablyNew York Nov 12 The Sun correspondent in Cuba writes his papertinder date of November 6 that up tothat time 150000 persons had died ofhunger in Cuba This statement isphased on reports received from all overthe island and he claims it is in noway exaggeratedHe gives quotations from the pressdescribing the pitiable condition allover the island They tell of larelamilies decimated by famine and ofpeople taking their own lies while suffering from the pangs of hungerPeople drop in the streets and roadsand perish miserably Children havebeen the greatest sufferers lIn the town of Santo Domingo Santa Clara province an average of 50 persons are dying every day The townoriginally had only a population of4500 Most of the dead there remainunburied the

Henry Theodore Durrant will notbe hanged at San Quentin Friday afterall the supreme court of this state having granted him another respite at theeleventh hour Up to four oclockThursday afternoon when the newsflashed over the wires from Sacramento that the court now in session there had granted a writof probable cause and instructedWarden Hale not to carry out the execution of Durrant until further ordersthere was apparently no further hopefor the condemned murderer of BlancheLamont and Minnie Williams as hisattorneys Messrs Dickinson andBoardman had made a futile effort tosecure another writ of habeas corpusin the United States court and had noteven been granted permission to appealfrom that decision to the supremecourt of the United StatesMeanwhile however Attorney Duprey hastened to Sacramento and applied to the state supreme court for awrit of probable cause for the purpose of staying the proceedings againsthis client upon the grounds that noofficial knowledge of the action of thesupreme court of the United States inthe matter of Durrants appealing fromthe decision of the federal court hadyet been received that the superiorcourt had acted too hastily in sentencing Durrant to be hanged Friday as thelaw required that he be given at least60 days -grace and thirdly that thependency of an appeal in the supremecourt affecting th6 condemned was ofitself sufficient cause for a stay of execution The matter was partiallyargued in chambers and later arguedbefore the full court and taken underadvisement Shortly afterward thecourt announced its decision grantingthe writ applied

and Jlis Associates Are Waiting-an Opportunity to Confer With theRepresentative of the United StatesPeace Near at HandNew York Nov 15 A dispatch tothe Tribune from Washington saysImportant advices are expected fromConsul General Lee in Havana thisweek By this time it is thought someidea should be had as to whether GenBlancos policy is causing improvementin the condition of the starving recon-centrados The prospects of negotiations between the Spanish authoritiesand the insurgents may also be determined by the presence of Gen LeeThe insurgent leaders have alreadystated unmistakably that they will notaccept the autonomy Little hope isfelt in administration circles that theywill change their mindsNevertheless an intimation has beenthrown out that Gen Gonier and hisassociates in the Held were waiting anopportunity to communicate with therepresentatives of the United StatesTheir position is said to be that asthis country has offered its good officesto Spain to eud the war it is competent to receive a suggestion from otherparties to the war While the insurgents have not received recognition asbelligerents they want to be treatedas such in making a proposition forpeaceAn inkling of their purpose has beenreceived This is to make knownthrough the consul general their desire to have the United States act asintermediary with Spain in arrangingterms of peace but peace on the basisof independence This is meant asa counter movement to the proffer ofautonomy Spain has already declaredthat Cuba can not buy independencebut the insurgents do not care for thatWhilestrengthening themselves in thefield they intend to do some diplomaticfencingNo special instructions were givenGen Lee as full confidence is felt inhis discretion A proposition from theinsurgents for mediation by theUnited States on the basis suggestedmight be transmitted to Washingtonbut it would hardly go further Thefeeling based on pretty accurate information is that before long boththe Sagasta ministry and the insurgents will be availing themselves ofthe good offices of this country thoughjust how this will come about is uncertain Some sanguine officials predict peace

place of exclusive preference for Great BritainIt would disappoint many in this country but the question must be viewedin the broad light of Anglo AmericanrelationsNo one will deny that Canada

watering-pot and emptied about a quart ofwater on the ground You ought tohave given that to your thirsty plantsJhe saidIt is the first time I have left waterin it sir apologized Robert I suppose I was absent minded yesterdaySo you have not used it to dayNo sirWell thats all said Hendricksturning- to the mayor It is a very perplexing-case indeedShall I telephone my men askedCapt Welsh Dont you think weought to take some steps to catch thefellowNot yet replied Hendricks andwalking- by Welsh he nudged himsharply with his elbow But we cango into the house out of the sunAs they started to the house Hendricks dropped back with Fred Walters and his wife but she went forwardand joined her mother When theywere in the hall Hendricks saidfWhere is your study Mr RoundtreeThis room on the rightYes replied the mayorWell lets go in there a momentAh he exclaimed in a tone of satisfaction as they entered the room youhave a typewriter It is just what Ivant I must write a letter at onceto my assistant in New York to tellhim that I am detained here But Icant use this make of machine Whouses it Mr Roundtree Ah I see MrsWaiters does 4They all looked at Hendricks in wonderPray how did you guess thattalced Mrs Walters a cold smile on herfaceOne of the tricks of my calling -wasthe reply Its easy I noticed thatthe nails of your two index fingers areworn down roughty so I know that younot only write on the machine but youdo it slowly for you employ only thosetwo fingers Experienced writers useall the fingers of the handIt is simpQe enough since you haveexplained it replied Mrs WaltersAnd you are exactly rightWill you oblige me by writing ashort note at my dictation Hendricks-asked pushing a choir towards the machine I would scratch it down witha pencil but all the letters I send to myoffice are carefully filed and they lookbetter typewrittenI kave a machine and a stenographerat the office interposed Capt Welshmy man will do it for you in a hurrySurely we have no time to lose themayor and the ladies will feel insecureif we do not make a move pretty soonI think myself Mr Hendricksthe mayor began but the detective interrupted himOh it will only take a moment Iliave an addressed envelope ready in myjDOcket and I can drop it in a letterbox as I go down Take a seat MrsWaltersLilian obeyed with a curious upwardlook into his face and a touch of hesitation as she put a sheet of paper between the rollersDear Hasbrooke Hendricks beganYour letter received Am engagedon important case here Cant comethis week Will wire you later Ladsley affair must wait HendricksWhen Mrs Walters had drawn thessheet from the machine and given it tothe detective he turned to the mayorWhat did you do with your old type--writerhe asked as he folded theletter and put it into an envelope andtook a stamp from his watchcaseWhy I I think it is in the lumberroom the mayor stammered Buthow did you know 1 had oneHendricks smiled as he touched thestamp with his tongue and placed itcarefully on the corner of the envelope-Another easy thing Judging from itsappearance this machine cannot havebeen in use more than a mouth andMrs Walters writes too well to haveJearned within thac time I did notthink it lively that she had practicedout of the House She looks like a stay--at-homelittle bodyHow very simple the mayor exclaimed If only your keen sight will- help us solve this mystery we shall be-all gratefulMrs Roundtree seemed displeasedwith the delayArent you going to do somethingtowards protecting ur house captain she asked turning to WelshSome one has attempted the life of niyshild I shall go mad if something isnot done at onceCapt Welsh looked embarrassedThe case is really inMr Hendrickshands he said awkwardly It is sohard to get his services owing to hiswide reputation and the demandsbn histime that he is usually granted unlimited authority and He stopped forlack vrordiM4There is no reason why you may notplace a guard round the house night andday captain said Hendricks frowning slightly at Welshs compliment Ifit allays the fears of the ladies it willserve a good purposeThank 3rou said Mrs RoundtreetoldlyWhere is your telephone mayorasked WelshIn the library across the hall Showit to him Lilian said the mayorWhen Mrs Roundtree heard the telephone bell Eing she went into the library to hear Welsh give his orders andFred Walters f olloAved her leaving themayor and Hendricks togetherv While they are in there I should beglad to get a look at the grounds froma back window upstairs if you willshow me up said the detectiveCertainly with pleasure the mayorreplied This way And he led Hendricks up the rear steps to the floorabove There is a window in thisservants room he went on pushing adoor open but it looks out on the siderather than the back The old lumberroom is in the rear but youll get allover dust if you go thereNo matter it wont hurt meWhen they had opened the door ofthe lumber room and were makingtheir way through dusty piles of oldfurniture carpets rugs pictures andbroken statuary Hendricks smiled andpointed to a typewriter on a table nearthe window See how wrell I guessedhe said crossing the room and bendingover the machine I am interested intypewriters I had a chance to buystock in one before they became therage and if I had done so I wrould nowbe too rich to have to be nosing roundin other peoples affairs like this Thismachine was made about 85 purpleand copying he added rubbing hisfinger on the ribbon and transferringthe stain to his cuff I like the blackbetter Then he went to a windowand carelessly looked out Ah hesaid you see how thick the woods arebehind the place where we found histracks He could have got away veryeasity Would your daughter be ableto defend herself Mr Roundtree incase of sudden attack Hendricksasked as they came back toward thestairs Can she use a revolverQuite well indeed the mayor an-swered her husband taught her ButI dont like her to carry one It makesher mother uneasyAs they reached the lower floor theothers were coming from the libraryWelsh went out to call a cab and Hendricks joined him The moment thecab stopped at the door the captaingot in but Hendricks held back Ihave left my umbrella out there hesaid apologetically Wait a momentHendricks went down the walk andwas soon hidden from view by theboxwood bushes Five minutes passedWelsh was impatiently wonderingwhat had become of him when heemerged from the shrubbery lightinga cigar Without a word of explanationsfor his delay he got into the cab beside Welsh and told the driver to goaheadWell said Mrs Roundtree as thecab drove away that man must beoverrated certainly If I had not heardthat he was a brilliant member of hisprofession I should have said he wasche most stupid man alive I felt soirritated by his dawdling actions that Iwas tempted to turn my back on himThe idea of his wanting tosee the gardening tools lecturing Robert aboutnot hanging up a watering pot andusing our house to write his correspondence in and at such an awfultime tooI think he was unable to find a ghostof a clew remarked Fred WaltersHe was trying to hide his disappointment by indifference He has no doubtaccomplished great things in Europeand elsewhere in this country but anyone can see that he has met his WaterloohereWhat did he go upstairs for MrsWalters spoke to her father in a tonethat was too low for the others to hearHe had sat down at his desk several feetfrom where his wife and son-in-lawwere standingTo get a look at the grounds fromthe back windows the mayor repliedFrom the servants room sheaskedNo the lumber room And themayor drew a sheet of paper towardhim and began to write He did not notice that she stared at him strangelyfor a moment after he had answeredand that she sat down in a rcckingehair with her back to the light andtook no part in the conversation goingon between Walters and her motherCHAPTER IXHendricks sat smoking beside Welshall the way down town He seemed sodeeply thoughtful that Welsh wasafraid to disturb him Presently however Hendricks sighed looked into thecaptains expectant face and saidMy New York case is puzzling meI cant make head or tail of it It is certainly a most complicated matter Youmayhave read of the Sixth avenue jeweler who was found deadMy God Mr Ilendiicks pardonme broke in Welsh with a flash ofthe eyes but this is really going toofar Surely you dont realize any position I have taken it on nryself toemploy you with the citys money cdand surely this is no time to be talking of other casesHendricks stared in surprise blushedand threw away his cigar The cab wasslowing up at Welshs office Hendricks said nothing until they were rnside and he had closed the door thenhe coolly lighted another cigar andwent onYou must pardon me really captain but I have always worked withmen who understood my awkwardways They usually let me alone andI forgot that you dont know my methods I am a great economists timewhen I am in thinking trim and asI had already arrived at the only concluffTTlfsion possible in your case at least at thisstage I was working on the other matter I mentionedConclusion What conclusioncried WelshWhy I thought you were followingme step by step up at the mayorsthough now I do recall that you madeone or two proposals that rather seemedto indicate a lack of proper cautionWhy I saw absolutely nothing replied Welsh To be frank I thoughtyou were helplessly stumped and weresimply trying to kill time and make afavorable impression on the ladiesI was trying to be agreeable WelshI confess it Thats my style It makesam unpleasant job pleasanter to allconcerned If you ever have to handcuff a woman tell her she has prettywirists and she wont mind it half somuchI am at sea said Welsh and completely overboardHendricks leaned back threw his feeton a desk and chewed the end of hiscigar I did not expect to find what Idiscovered up there he said musinglybut when I once got started the wholemchain of circumstances began to unroll Iand was so easy to follow that I feltas if I were playing with a toy I couldhave kicked myself for having to appear to take it all so seriously I wastempted to make a joke of it When Iwas half through I wanted to throwdown my hand and say Look here Ihold so and so and Ill bet my reputation you havent a thingFm still in deep water said WelshI sawr the bullet hole her tracks thefellows tracks and that was all Thenervousness of the ladies and the mayors anxiety absorbed meI did not go there to sympathizewith anyone answered the detectiveI was looking for facts But follow menow and draw your own conclusionsas we go Well what wTas the first incongruous thing that happened afterwe arrived Why if you rememberMrs Walters said she was sure sheheard the report before she felt the ballpass through her sleeve The distancewas about 100 yards and if the difference were noticeable at all it wouldhave been scientifically you know exactly the reverseBut surely protested Welsh youdhardly expect an excited woman to becorrect about such a minor detail asthatMrs Walters was not excitedHendricks answered You must havenoticed that If she had been I shouldnot have made a point there Howeverthat was only a little thing to startfrom but it was sufficient as I foundout later The iiext thing I did was toexamine the hole in her sleeve Whatdid I do that for To find out if it weremade by a bullet It was rather toodark in the house to see well but outin the sunlight I got another look Isaw that it really was abullet hole Inoticed a few black specks on the clothbut withoutbemg openly impertinent ICan she use a revolvercould not decide whether they had beencaused by powder or soot for the gownwas grayAt that distance Who ever heardofHold on not so fast Ah I see youare not following me but youll catchon in a moment so lets continue Shenext showed us her tracks Did1 younotice how deep and distinct they wereIt was the first thing that struck meHer mother is twice as heavy as she isand stood in the same sort of soil buther feet made hardly any impressionsDont forget that I marked the spotwhere Mrs Walters stood with myumbrella after that you know wewent over to the fence There is aminor point here in Mrs Waltersbeing the first to see the footprints beyond the fence but we will pass thatand come to the footprints themselvesDid you notice nothing remarkableabout them captain No Well inall my experience I never saw such comical footprints I was tempted to laughoutright but it would have spoiledeverything so I smothered my amusementI saw nothing remarkable aboutthem said Capt Welsh impatientlyThey were made captain by mensslippers a number ten with very thinsoles The heels had been well presseddown into the soft clay and so were themiddle parts of the soles but the thinedges all round had turned up so easilythat only a faint impression of the bottom was leftWhat did 3011 deduce from thatasked Welsh still perplexedThat they were worn by feet nothalf large enough for them 1 houghthey had doubtless been drawn on overa pair of boots saw by the shape ofthe track that the right one had comeoff once as the wearer drew it from themudAh curious exclaimed the captain but I dont yet see what you aredriving at though I think you suspectbut how could you WhyBut that isfribt all the detectivewent on smiling You remember perhaps that I asked if It had rained outthejjgerecently Well I was tryiHg toaccount since there has not been anyrainjjFately for that naturally dry spotof clay being soft enough to have received such distinct footprints Onclospsamination I detected the faintsemicircular mark of a vessel in theedgmof the grass and at exactly therigjSydistance from it a spot where alittle water had trickled down from thespout on the clayH the waterin8 pot cried WelshWonderful wonderful Now I knowwhat all that rigmarole to the gardener meantand I found a little water in ittodfand learned that it had last nightbeenflef t on the floor when Robert declard that he usually hung it up and ontheljottom of it the stupid rainmakerhadleft a trace of the very clay inwhich we found the footprints But Iamtoofast foryou rememberasl stoodat the big tracks I sighted along overthe f ence at mj umbrella on the lawnremember said Welsh with alaugh And I own I thought youwere making a blooming ass of yourself and simply pretending to makeinvestigations when you knew youwere whollv at sea But what were youdoing it forWhen I got my bearings in thatway I calculated that the handle ofmy umbrella was just about where hersleeve must have been when she wasbending over As I sightednloncrEXACTING DISCIPLINEatit I saw that if a bullet were fired fromwhere I stood and passed through hersleeve it must as it would

with the hardships common topioneer life It required not a little courage and perseverance to conquerthe forests and to exterminate the reptiles and wolves but a still more formidable foe to these lonely people wasthe miasma that arose from the slowmuddy creek that wound its waythrough the beautiful valley If youwere to walk to day through the Jurying ground ou the East Hill you wouldread the story upon the little whiteslabs so thickly set in the green grassIf was a hard climate for little childrenIn those days when traveling to anew country was done by wagons itwas customary for wagons to join atrain whether strangers or not andwhen one or two or three dropped outjio one thought it strange or indeedthought of it at all For this reasonno one knew when Diadamie came orwhere she livedThe people of the village knew heronly as a peddler of the berries thatgrew amongst the hills These berrieswere rich and sweet and were keenlyrelished where fruit was almost unknown The housewives had learnedto expect Diadamie some time early inJuly and thereafter once twice orperhaps three times a weekDiadamies approach to the villagewas across the creek through a coveredbridge which brought her suddenly tothe foot of tl main and only streetShe carried a large basket upon herhead and as she emerged from thebridge her clear mellow voice rang outupon the summer air Old DiadamieThis call was repeated from door to door until the lastof the little shining berries were disposed of Then Diadamie would makesome small purchases at the villagestore always including a stick or twoof bright red and white striped candyafter which she walked out across thestretch of level road and disappearedin the shadow of the mountainWhy she called herself Old Diadamie was a mystery Her figure wasstraight and slim and she walked witha quick firm step which does not belong to age Her eyes were blue butof so dark a shade as to be easily mistaken for black Her hair was deepblack with a strong tendency to curlhad it not been lashed back with bandsand pins in her effort to subdue it Hermouth was large and strong and whenshe laughed she showed that everytooth was of amazing whiteness andperfection Diadamie wore a dress ofindigo blue calico with a sunbonnetof the same material She was alwaysscrupulously clean and neatDiadamies house was little morethan a hut It was built of logs andhad but on i room it was situated uponthe top of the mountain hemmed inand sheltered by the dense forest ButDiadamie did not live quite alone Noshe had Tietro Tietro who knew heronly as Nanan Walled in by hugedrifts of snow the winters were drearenough to this strange pair Whensummer came and Diadamie wasobliged to spade and plant her gardenand later to go on long walks gathering berries and afterwards to tramp tothe village to dispose of them the dayswere long and lonely for Tietro It wasthen in the silence of the mountainthat little Tietros brain was full ofimaginings that caused him to askmany bewildering questions of Diadamie upon her returnTietro sat all day long just as Diadamie had placed him in the rudelyconstructed chair which was highenough to enable him to look out of thewindow There was a rest for the longthin useless limbs and a cushion forthe misshapen oack For hours Tietrowould sit listening to the wind in thetrees and watching the patches of sunlight upon the soft green moss Nowand then a gray squirrel would run upand down the trees but no sound fromthe outside would ever reach Tietrosears He had never seen a living beingbut Diadamie Tietros arms were longand thin like his lower limbs but theywere not so limp He could use hishands and arms but he had neverwalked a step Diadamie alwaysdressed him in a long1 looseered in full about his slender little neckso that the folds would fall over hispoor shapeless body and cover his deformity Likewise she had let his yellow hair grow long and trained it tofall in soft loose curls over his shoulders reaching far down below wherehe should have had a waist Tietrosface was always white and his eyeswere as large and blue as the speedwellflowerDiadamie had returned from her firsttrip to the village She stooped downand kissed Tietros cheek then steppedback and with her hands behind herbade him guess what she had broughthimCandy exclaimed the little boyHow well he knewYes laughed DiadamieTietro unrolled the little packagewith shining eyes How beautiful itlooked to the little creature those twotwisted sticks of red and white sugarThe berries were now ripening fastand Diadamie anxious to increase herstore as much as possible had remained out longer than usual It wasfast approaching twilight when sheclimbed up the mountain side andstruck the little path leading to herhouse Once she thought she heard acry like a child but no that could notbe yet she quickened her steps Againit came and this time clearer Shestopped to listen a moment then hurried on Within a few rods of the doorshe heard Tietro call Nanan NananDiadamie answered the call -with aclear reassuring tone Here Tietrohere is Nanan and in a moment shehad her arms around the frightenedchild soothing and caressing himWhat has frightened Nanans

beenfalling Sunday morning Diadamiearose early and built a fire in the fireplace which blazed and crackled cheerfully Then she carried in more logsswept the snow from them and builtthem up close to the fireplaceenough to last all day so that shemight not have to bring in snowy woodto chill the air for the suffering childThe day dragged by Diadamie felt aweight upon her heart from whichthere was no relief for it was plainthat Tietro was not so well The stillness of that snow entombed mountainwas awful She could not interestTietro in any way Before it was quitedark he wished to go to bed Diadamielaid him down tenderly tucked him inand kissed him many times but he onlysmiled in answer to her good night andsoon fell asleep Diadamie piled thelogs on the fire and the blaze filled theroom with a bright glow Tietro slepton and breathed more easily now andafter one more look at his wasted faceshe threw herself down on a rude couchat the foot of his bed- and fell asleepWhen she awakened the fire was lowand she seemed to have been dreamingShe surely heard Tietro laugh Sheopened her eyes slowly and when consciousness had fully returned she wastoo terrified to move for the room

persuade Tietro to lether go to the village but finally afterpromises of candy and extra rewards he consented and Diadamie setout wjth her usual stock of berriesShe felt the load to be heavy somehow and the way long The day washot Many in the village were ill withfever and it was harder than it hadever been to sell her berries Whenthe last measure was sold and Diadamiehad started home the sun was

bewilderment Tietro sittingquietly in his chair as she had lefthim except that there was a strangelight in his ejes and a smile of deep content upon his little white face Diadamiealmost doubted her

mountains While the village still dreamsof sumoner the mountain trees havechanged their tints from red to goldand from gold to brown The windhas scattered the leaves over the greenmoss stones and

greatest record of the duke of Butland who in one day in the October ofWaterloo year killed 125 head of gamedoes not look a very formidable bag forfive hours shooting although early inthe century it

SeasonsYou see George said Mr Wingleby whose youthful son had asked himhow we came to have different kindsof weather the weather is put up intin cans a days weather to a can andusually they put about a years supplyahead enough to last through a springsummer autumn and winter In fillingthe cans they sort it ail out as well aspossible Sometimes when they get acan full there may be a little left overand whatever remains in this way theythrow into one lot When theyve gotpretty nearly all the cans full and theregular stock of weather has run outthey fill up from that lot of odds andends The cans so filled contain what iscalled variable weather because itsmized but most of the weather they getpretty well sorted out according to theseasonWhen theyve got all the cans filledthey stack em up where theyll behandy to get at and theres a man thatdoes nothing but open them Everyday he cuts a can and pours out theweather for that day and of course agreat deal depends upon him Sometimes this man gets careless and pullsdown a lot of the wrong cans gettingthem say from the July shelf in themonth of April and likely as not getting down a weeks supply at once soas to have them handy on the openingtable Of course he discovers his mistake the first can he opens but he istoo lazy to put the rest back and so hekeeps on then until he has opened themall and thats how it comes about asit sometimes does that we get a hotspell at a season when we ought tohave nothing but cool weatherBut of course those April cans arenot lost they must be around somewhere and we get em later Maybethe man will sprinkle them along withthe hope that we wont notice themmuch but as likely as not he opensthem one after another together maybe after some terribly hot spell in July Jor August wnen they are

large country Itsentire population is materially lessthan that of the state of New York andmits area is 46000 square miles a thousand less than this state Yet it hasbecome one of the principal grain exporting countries of EuropeSince the country was turned intoone of peasant proprietors by thedivision of the crown estates the cultivation of cereals and especially ofwheat has increased largely and withit the exports Last year Boumaniashipped from her Danubian ports 25 percent more grain for export than shedid in 1895 and of this total wheat wasthe chief item Last years wheat cropin Boumania was 70000000 bushelswhich in view of the size of the country is enormous Nor is wheat the onlyproduct of this Danubian kingdom forcorn or maize as it is called there israised to the value of 20000000 a yearand the product of barley is 250000 tonsa year and of rye 100000 The importance of these figures will be seenwhen it is stated that there is 50 percent more rye raised in Boumania thanin the entire United Kingdom and thatthe corn or maize crop in Boumania islarger than in any European country -withthe exception of Austria and ItalyThe total grain product in Boumaniaamounts in a j ear to more than 200000000 bushels and the average yieldto the acre of cultivated land is 25 bushels whereas it is only 20 bushels iniFrance and Germany and only ten inItaly and Bussia A table appearedsome time ago in one of the Europeanscientific journals showing the averageyield in bushels of grain to theitant in the various countries In thiscomputation the United States stood atthe head with an average of 40 Denmarks average was nearly as large andthree other countries had an average ot23 bushels each Bussia Sweden andEoumanh The average in France was20 in Germany 10 and in the UnitedjKingdom eight The lowest of European countries was Switzerland Theshortage of grain crops in many European countries has led to an unusually large demand of which the UnitedStates as the chief grain producingcountry of the world is getting thelargest benefit but other countrieswhich have surplus for export are gainfog some advantages too and Boumania is one of the countries so favoredUnlike the other Danubian political divisions it has a railroad system ofeighteen hundred miles and it has better roads than most of its neighborsN Y SunA Queer GraveyardIn a little hillside graveyard west

American system of subdivided local authority whats everybodys business is nobodys businessand controversies being frequent asto the liability of national state or municipal authority for needful expenditures very little was done The National League for Good Roads was organized in 1892 to awaken general interest in the improvement of public roadsto determine the best methods of building and maintaining them and conductand foster such publications as mayx serve these purposes Atthe beginningof the agitation the good roads question did not make much headway andit was not omtil the popularity of bicycling grew that the demand forDrovcd roads became organized and isince then considerable headway hasbeen made- A computation which findsmuch favor among the advocates of-good roads is this There are approximately though the number is steadilyion the decline 14000000 horses in theUnited States -there were 15000000 bythe census of lS90and there are about2000000 mules principally in the souththe annual cost for fodder for these arrivals being lvH0i00O0OO On fine stoneiroads one horse can haul as much asthree horses can -haul over the averagedirt road of this country It is estimated that tit would be necessary tofound about 1000000 miles of macadamized roads in the United States inorder to have as -good a system of public highways as is found in several European states At 4000 per mile hiswould involve an outlay of 4000000j000a pretty large sum But if half of thedraught animals could be dispensedwith by itheibuilding of such roadsthere would be an annual saving

it has been known to seriously injure fruit trees for over 50 yearsIt was first discovered on American soilin 1877 in an orchard near Elmira NY and has gradually spread especially to the south and central west Itwas observed in large numbers in orchards in South Carolina in 1885 86Two years later it was found in Indiana and is now well establishedthroughout the central Mississippi valleyMy attention has been called to itseveral times this season in Marylandand the editor of this journal has referred a query from a subscriber regarding the same pest I have observed it lately in several orchards andsome nurseries It rarely ever doefFRUIT BARKBEETLE AND ITS WORKLserious injury in nurseries and attackonly trees whose vitality has been reduced by being broken by plowing orinjured in some other way It doeanot confine its attacks to fruit treesbut is found working on shade and ornamental trees as well usually themaple elm and mountain ashThe beetle will attack perfectlyhealthy trees but has a decided preference for weak and sickly ones Atree infested with this insect can beeasily detected by a little careful observation The trunk and largerbranches are usually peppered full -oflittle round holes about the size of apin head see cut In many instancesthe gummy exudation from these punctures is very conspicuous standing outin bead like masses or running downthe branches and trunk I have seenmany trees especially cherry in thiscondition the present seasonThe little beetle responsible for thismischief is about one tenth of an inchin length and one third as wide It isnearly black in color somewhat cylindrical in general form and under aglass of moderate power shows a clothing of yellowish hairs on the head andwing covers The head is vertical andihe jaws are short and stout Thebeetle is shown in our figure very muchenlarged after ForbesThe adult beetle after making a holein the tree deposits her eggs in littlegrooves made in the inner bark Theyoung that hatch from these eggs feedupon the inner bark and sapwood making long channels running in all directions from the central groove as shownin lower right corner These youngworms frequently become so numerousas to completely girdle the branch ortrunk as the case may be The younghave no feet and are white with smallbrown heads of the general shape-shown in the illustration They transform in these channels and in duetime the adults eat their way out thusmaking more openings similar to theones made by the female when depositing her eggs There are probably twobroods each year One brood depositsits eggs in September and the insectspass the winter as larvae or wormsunder the bark These transform inthe spring and begin to emerge asadults as early as thti middle of 3Ianeh1 have also found a full grown

branches earlyand to enter a college of music which herparents promised she could do as soon asshe should finish the common branchesHow many children by diligent study toachieve their ambitions are injuring theirhealth It was so in this case The childstudied hard all day and often far into thenight and had won the respect and admiration of her teacher and of all the school byher aptness and rapid learningFor some time Louise experienced an indisposition which she would not makeknown to her parents for fear thejr wouldhave her remain from school Her headrache soon became unendurable and

ofthe Baltimore and Ohio west of and between Martinsburg W Va and NorthMountain have been completed November 1st They cover a distance of nearlyfour miles starting three miles west of Martinsburg and extending some distancewest of Myers Hole which is near the Northfountain station At Myers Hole the linewas changed taking out some very objectionable curvature and the roadbedraised nearly fifteen feet eliminating twogrades of 42 feet per mile which came together at Myers Hole and substituting therefor an almost level track This point on theroad has always been a dangerous one andmany freight wrecks have occurred thereApart from doing away with the dangerousfeature of two sharp down grades comingtogether as was the case in this instancethe saving in operation of the road by thechange will be very large as it enables thetons per train to be greatly increased andreduces the liability of accident to the minimum At Tablers the road bed has beenlowered about 13 feet and the same atTabbs besides taking out objectionable curvature and reducing the rate of grades atthese points from 42 feet per mile to 10 feetmile thus increasing the cars that canEer hauled per train Though these improvements have cost quite a sum of money theexpenditure is fully justified by the greatsaving in operationWhat It WokPapa Alice I thought I heard a loudsmack in the hall last nightAlices Yes Mr
