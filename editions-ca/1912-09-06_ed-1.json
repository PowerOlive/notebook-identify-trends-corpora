"THE ROSART."
Every theatregcer in this city knows
that "The Rosary" as the most talk
ed about play in the popular priced
houses last season. This play struck
a responsive chord "in the hearts of
the people, and with its many human
interest qualities, it proved to be im
mensely Dopular. Owing to its lasi
season's success "The Rosary" is be
ing repeated again this season by the
well known producers. Rowland and
Clifford, and it comes to this theatre
on Septembei 9, 1912.
Whaling has almost ceased to hold
its place as one of our national indus
tries. Though almost.'all of its men
and ships have passed away, an illumi
nating description of this hazardous
vocation has ricver been written. But
fortunately it has been recorded by the
best and truest of all posible methods
of recording facts the tiny negatives
cf animated pictures. These will be
presented by Lvman-H. Howe at the
Paris Giand on September 10. The
scenes are of absorbing interest
throughout. Tney reveal the imple
ments and tactics of whalers, the sight
ing, approach and bamooning of tht
whale, its Irantic.convuNive struggles,
its enormous r'ze as seen along side
the vessel and finally the processes em
ployed in dressing it for its products.
