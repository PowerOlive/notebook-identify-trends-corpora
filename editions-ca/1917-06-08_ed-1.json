''THE FIGHTING URST"
CALLS FOR RECRUITS.
(By Capt. H. B. Kinsolving, Jr., 1st
Regt., Ky. National Guard.)
Kentuckians between the ages of
twenty-one and thirty-one, inclu
sive, have been called to the colors.
They have already registered for
that service. They will be selected,
beginning Sept. 5, to perform the
highest duty which is incidental to
their citizenship.
Kentuckians, likewise all Ameri
cans, have thought of citizenship
only in terms of rights, privileges,
licenses. Never has that reciprocal
I term, duty, seemed to impress them
with its full significance. They speak
f feelingly of their inviolable, constitu
tional rights and privileges never of
their duties!
Who guaranteed to them the priv
ileges they boast? Who shed their
life-blood that they, to-day might be
freed? Who made America safe for
democracy during the past one hun
dred and forty-one years of her glo
rious history? Who made the
name of Kentucky respected in every
civilized country on the face of the
earth? Think, Kentuckians, what
duty do you of to-day owe to pos
terity! France has furnished us a splen
did example. Her sons of to-day by
their valor and heroic sacrifice have
written another glorious page in his
tory for, liberty, equality and frater
nity; Democracy has joined with auto
cracy. It is war to the bitter end.
Kentuckians must sense that fact
and immediately respond by joining
the colors.
You have the xopportunity now.
"The Fighting First," Kentucky's
First Infantry Regiment, has its
representatives at the Sheriff's office
in Paris. Capt. H. B. Kinsolving, an
old Montgomery county boy, Ser
geant Richard Freeman and Ser
geant A. Y. Culton are at the office
from seven o'clock in the morning to
ten o'clock at night to accept candi
dates for enlistment.
STOCK, CROP, ETC.
Caywood, Smith & McClintocK
sold to Clarence Wright a pair of
extra nice four-year-old mare mules
for $521. They purchased a five-year-old
mule from John Smith, of
near Paris, for $200.
FARMING CONDITIONS.
The present outlook for farmers in
some sections of Bourbon county is
somewhat discouraging. The contin
ued rains and the absence of much
needed sunshine are the principal
factors operating against them.
. Storms of wind, rnin find hail in Hia
! past weeks have gashed and washed
the earth, undoing much of the
j work the farmers had so carefully
done, and which will take them
some time to repair.
In many sections of the county
J tobacco plant beds -were totally de
stroyed, as they wTere completely
covered by the dirt blown and wash
ed over them by the storm. This
will greatly curtail the acreage of
tobacco to be planted in this county.
Many farmers took advantage of
the favorable weatbvr following the
storms and commenced the setting
out of tobacco plants. Most of them
found their corn ground so torn up
that it has required replanting.
During the past few days the blue
grass pastures have grown consider
ably and it is believed that there will
be a fifty per cent, production of the
staple. The hay and timothy fields,
which two or three weeks ago pre
sented a rather bad uppearance, have
come out considerably, and it is now
believed that there will be a good
production.
Gardeners are getting along as well
as they can under unfavorable weath
er and other conditions, and are
making the utmost endeavors to in
crease their production this year.
PARISIAN GETS
MERITED PROMOTION.
As a fitting reward for his con
scientious and efficient three-years'
service, Mr. Emerson Galloway, who
has been stationed in the Philippines
in the employ of the United States
Government, has received a promo
tion .to the position of first assistant
chief of the fiber division of the Bu
reau. The recommendation was made
by Chief Boyle, after considering the
names of several others whose rec
ords were good, also.
Mr. Galloway is a son of Mr. and
Mrs. Grant Galloway, of near Paris.
He is a graduate of the Paris High
School and of the College of Agri
culture of the University of Ken
tucky. The Manila Times, published
at Manila, P. I., where Mr. Galloway
is stationed in the service, pays him
a fine tribute.
According to the Bible, the people
once habrded manna and it spoiled
on their hands. .Let us trust that
history is still capable of repeating
DEATHS.

phia, a sister of Miss Minnie Boehm,

three, prominent Clark county farm
er died at his home in Winchester,
following a protracted illness. Mr.

Paris. He leaves a widow and one

JOINT EFFORT TO
INCREASE SUPPLIES.
With the view of increasing the
production and stimulating interest
in conservation of all food supplies
raised, while at the same time in
stilling the lesson of practical patri
otism, Hon. W. C. G. Hobbs, presi
dent of Knights of Pythias Widows'
and Orphans' Home, located near
Lexington, has addressed a letter to
Superintendent George Moore, sug
gesting that the boys and girls of
the Home be enlisted in a friendly
patriotic contest, in growing vege
tables and other food products, on
the Home farm this year. President
Hobbs hopes that the Pythian lodges
in other sections of the State, will
follow out the suggestion, and boost
the Home garden movement in their
various communities.
The Pythian Home farm comprises
107 arces, and under the able man
agement of Superintendent Moore,
has been able during the past few
years, to make a splendid showing in
the matter of vegetable production
for use of the inmates. There are 85
children, besides the supervisors and
helpers, at the Home, and President
Hobbs believes that with the interest
aroused by such a contest as he sug
gests, there will be a largely increas
ed production of food stuffs on the
farm.
A CORK FABRIC.
The war has cut down the supply
of standard fabrics, but European
chemists have met the situation in
part by inventing new ones. Stories
of grass clothes in the European
markets are numerous, but under
wear manufactured from new water
proof material made of cork is even
more remarkable. The latter is of
particularly great value since the
price of rubber has become so high.
It is made by treating thin slices of
cork with chemical baths to remove
the brittle substances and then glu
ing them to cloth. The result is a
fabric so flexible that it may be roll
ed up, and so close in texture that It
affords efficient protection against
the rain and also against the heat
of the sun at least, such are the
claims for it.
FIREPROOF AEROS.
One of the greatest dangers to the,
war fliers is that they will be set on
fire by shrapnel or incendiary bul
lets. W. R. Weeks has written a
letter to the Aero Club of America
stating that this difficulty has been
overcome by the invention of a
liquid chemical compound which will
make the wooden and canvas parts of
the machine absolutely fireproof. If
this invention is all that is claimed
for it, one of the greatest dangers
has been removed from flying, not
only in war but in peace, for there
is always danger that the machine
may catch fire from the engine.
DRUGGISTS' ASSOCIATION
MEET IN LOUISVILLE.
Several of the local druggists will
go to Louisville next week to attend

maceutical Association, which con
venes there on June 19 for a three
