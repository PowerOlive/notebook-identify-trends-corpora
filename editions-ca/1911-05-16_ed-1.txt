Hibler, agent forthe Blue Grass Traction Company inthis city and a member of one ofFaris' most prominent families, shothimself through the head with suicidalintent a few minutes after midnightSaturday at the interurban office andwhen found a few minutes later lifewas extinct.The act was evidently premeditated. as he had snread uoon the floor of thefruight office a blanket upon which helay with a revolver clutched in hi3ripht hand.The discovery of the body was madeby Motorman James Davis and Conductor Elmer McGinnis, who arrivedfrom Lexington shortly after 12 o'clockand went to the office to report. Seeing the door of the freight room opened Motorman Davis susppcted thatsomething was wrong as it was not thecustom of Mr. Hibler to leave thatportion of the building open and thelights burning.The body was still warm, and a gaping wound in the right temple Bhowedwhere the bullet, which hack snuffedout the life had entered. Feigns living near the office say they'Heard ashot shortly after twelve o'clock butas the report was not very distinct itcaused no alarm and no investigationwas made.Mr. Hibler was seen early in theevening and was in his usual goodhumor, showing no sign of despondency. About ten o'clock on the nightof the tragedy he was seen at theoffice, chatting and joking with persons waiting for the car.Although he left no note or writingof any kind to throw any light on thetragedy, from conversations he hashad recently with his most intimatefriends it is believed the fact that hishealth, which has been very bad,weighed so heavily upon his mind tosuch an extent that it impaired hisfaculty and in a fit of momentary insanity, committed the rash act.For a number of years Mr. Hiblerwas engaged at the carpenter tradeand during his career suffered manysevere accidents. On one occasion ahatchet fell from a building strikinghim on the head, inflicting a severe injury and again he had the misfortuneto fall from a scaffolding which hewas erecting around a smoke-stack atthe Paris Milling Co. He never recovered from tne latter accident, andcomplained frequently of sufferingintense pains.Mr. Hibler had been in the employof the Traction Company here forbout a year. He was prompt and attentive to his duties and was held inthe highest esteem by the officials andthe traveling public. Officials of theroad were in Pari3 yesterday goingover his books which were found to bein good shape and his accounts perfect. Mr. Hibler is survived by a wife,one daughter and a sun, three brothers,Messrs. Henry, Harvey and BishopHibler. He was prominent in fraternal circes, being a member of thelocal lodge of Odd Fellows and Knightsof Pythias.The funeral services were held at theresidence on Eighth street yesterdayafternoon at 2:30 o'clock conducted byElder Carey E.

One day not longago he came into the shop with a mopof hair that would do credit to a football player.

His appearance wasnot prepossessing. He was extraordinarily thin, with a stiff carriage. Hehad a long, bony face blotched with redand scanty hair of a dirty yellow color.His hollow eyes gleamed under thickreddish eyebrows, but were furtiveand restless, never looking straight atany one save by stealth."That is a bad man," declared Napoleon when he had seen him. "Hiseye as he examined me was like ahyena's caught in a trap."He really resembled this horrid, slyanimal in its walk as well as in hairand eyes.

Wur special new feature in this planter is that we not only get an accurate number of kernels in each hill, but we get the number of kernels in each hill which thefertility of the soil is able to bring to perfect maturity.No field was ever known to contain exact uniformity in strength of soil. It isjust as unreasonable to expect the same results from thin, weak soil, in comparisonwith deep, rich soil, as it is to expect a child to do a man's work. This is a reasonable proposition, particularly to the scientific corn grower.More money is being spent and greater efforts along educational lines are beingmade to-day than ever before in the world's history to increase the yield of corn peracre. We contributed a very large effort to accomplish these results with our BlackHawk single kernel edge drop, and we now add to our combination the No. 15 Variable Drop, with which the drop can be changed to 2, 3 or 4 kernels in a hill withoutstopping the team; or can drill 7 1-2, 10 or 15 inches, 9, 12 or 17 1-2 inches, or 11, 14or 22 inches apart, without stopping the team.Hand Drop Attachment with each Planter, has Foot Drop also.

Saturday Evening Post.Threatened tho King.The honor of knighthood is not onewhich appeals to everybody. Coke ofNorfolk, who considered that he had afar better claim than the speaker totho designation of first commoner ofEngland, strongly disliked the idea ofa handle to his name. This fact waswell known to George IV. When Cokewas chosen to head a deputation praying the king to dismiss from his person and council those advisers who bytheir conduct had proved themselvesalike enemies to the throne and people George announced that he wouldget even with him. "If Coke of Norfolk enters my presence," he declared,"I swear I'll knight him." The threatwas repeated to Coke, who rejoined,"If he dares such a thing I swear I'llbreak his sword." And as the sturdyNorfolk squire was quite capable ofdoing this, George refrained from carrying out his threat. London Chronicle. Clumsy Breton Women.To the casual observer the Bretonne fis not attractive or even supremely interesting. As a femme de chambre sheis clumsy, slovenly and rough ofspeech, lacking the graces and neatness of her Parisian sister. She shuffles about in felt slippers, her voluminous black skirts catch in everything,and if she waits at the table d'hote hermethod of handling cutlery is stronglycalculated to sever one's jugular vein.She has no regularity in her work, andat the hour that she ought to be making beds she is probably sittiug on thepublic staircase nursing her baby. Sheis generally married and, conversely,often ten years younger than you takeher to be. To English eyes she is rarely beautiful. Iler hair is trained tightly under her cap, her cheeks have seldom any delicacy of tint, and her fig- jure and motions are ungainly andawkward.
