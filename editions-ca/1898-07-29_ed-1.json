Perhaps the most prevalent mania of

Christmas dinner with his people and
Mr Gately had had his at the rectors
house Mr Gately was assistant at the
parish church The major poor man
had had no other resource than to sit at

What kind of dinner did the duchess

of the major who was dealing with
quiet precision
Colossal replied the major colos

Do you mean said I she gave
you the same old things only more of
them
Precisely madam It is your lead

The cherry stone has been a favorite
subject for tho worker in miniature
since Hadrhnus Junius saw at Mechlin
a cherry stone cut into the form of a
basket in wnich were 14 pairs of dice
distinct the spots and numbers of which
wcro easily to be discerned with a good
eye A museum in Massachusetts hag
nmong its other possessions a cherry
stone containing a dozen silver spoons
As the stone is of the ordinary size the
spoons are so small that their shape can
only bo admired by the aid of a micro
scope Other remarkable cherry stones
are the ones carved all over with 124
heads mostly of popes and potentates
and the one fashioned by a topmaker at
Nuremberg which contains a plan of

smallest steam engine in the world is
one of an upright pattern made of sil

Of examples of microscope writing

Guilty Conscience by William Mayna
dier Browne in Scribners
The London Lancet Says It Is Not 1
ous to Smokers
Referring to the agitation started in j
France hy a society hich acts on the
principle that tobacco is always use-
less often harmful and sometimes homi
cidal The Lancet says We agree in
so far that we allow tobacco to be some
times very harmful It is of course a
poison but so is tea as also coffee
two vegetable products which are con
sumed by nearly every inhabitant of
either England or France All three can
be and very often are abused but this
does not do away with their reasonable
use In these days of rush and hurry to
bacco has often a most soothing and
restful effect The tobacco sold in
France is to put it mildly not good
and although in England it is possible
to buy fairly good toLacco it is next
door to impossible to get it pure
That is to say it is nearly always
scented or treated in some way so as to
give it an artificial flavor Cigars are
beyond the purse of any but a rich man
and as for cigarettes the filth sold as
such is beyond description A pure to
bacco society would be an admirable in
stitution and as for the traders saying
customers like scented tobacco the
1 customer seldom gets the chance of
an ounce all f smoking anything else The truth is
that as in the case of highly scented
tea or soap it is cheaper to fake infe
rior qualities of stuff than to supply the
real thing To be unsophisticated an
article must be of good quality but the
craze for cheapness is ruining every
thing and when people buy cigarettes
at 36 cents a hundred it is not to be
wondered at that they get well an in
ferior article
In view of these dicta it is interesting
to note that cigarettes are turned out in
large quantities by firms of repute at a
retail price nearly a third less than the
price mentioned by The Lancet Lon

Red Men So Love to Drink
I was down in the Indian Territory
a few weeks ago said a St Louis man
the other day and business took me to
the capital of the Cherokee Nation
There is no country in the world where
prohibitory laws are as strictly enforced
as in the five civilized tribes It is
against the law to import any sort of
intoxicating liquors under severe penal
ties The result is that it is a common
thing for people to drink camphor per
fume hair tonics and any old liquor
that contains the faintest suggestion of
alcohol
I actually saw one fellow drink a
large swallow of red ink and learned
that this carmine fluid was a most pop
ular beverage A good sized bottle of it
could be had for 50 cents and it was
warranted to make the drunk come
It seemed to me that when the Indians
were willing to go to such extremes to
indulge their craving for fire water that
it would be just as well to let them
have the genuine article which couldnt
at the worst be half as baneful as the
vile compounds they habitually use
