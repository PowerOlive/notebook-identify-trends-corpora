TheKepablicans In tho Matter ofrations Playing a Waiting GameThe New SenatorsWashington March 15 Monday atnoon Doth houses of the Fifty fifthcongress commenced in extra sessionIt is not likely that the senate will remain in continuous session during theweek unless the president is muchmore expeditious than he has been inmaking nominations There is nothing before the senate and there will henothing to require close application tobusiness unless the committee on foreign relations reports the arbitrationtreaty with great Britain A specialmeeting of the committee for the further consideration of this subject hasbeen called for MondayWhen Senator Davis motion to refer the treaty back to the committeediscussed at the special sessionthere was a general expression ofopinion that the designation of judgesof the United States supreme court asmembers of the tribunal should beeliminated It was thought that asjurists in the court of lastresort in this country the judgesmight be called upon to pass onsimilar to those that might ariseunder this treaty of arbitration andshould this prove to be the case thesituation would be mqre than embarrassing as the opinion of the judgeas a member of our own courtmight act as an extoppel inthe exercise of his rights as an independent member of the tribunal Itis almost certain that the treaty willalso be amended along the lines of theTurpie amendments of last session soas to provide that every case or question intended to be submitted to arbitration under this general treaty shallfirst be submitted to the senate for itsratificationIt seems to be a general impressionthat when the senator appointed bythe governor of Florida to succeed MrCall arrives he will be seated Thelegislature of Florida does not convene until April 7 and six years agothe senate seated Mr Posco ad interimunder precisely similar conditionsThe appointee from Oregon in placeof Mr Mitchell has not yet arrivedHis claim to a seat is regarded as resadjudicata by the decision of the senate in the Montana Washington andWyoming cases in the last congressllis credentials will undoubtedly besent to the committee on privilegesand ejections as were those of Maj AT Wood the appointee of Gov Bradley cf KentuckyMeanwhile the republicans in thematter of organization of the committees are playing a waiting gameThey will make no effort to do moreVthan j fill their own vacancies Thelegislatures of the two states electIt is understood an agreement hasabout been reached with the democratsto this end The proposition to consolidate all elements opposed to therepublicans for the purpose of capturing the organization and the commit-Vtees appears to have fallen throughowing o tne maDuiby oj tnese elements to come togetherThe republican majority in the househaving adopted in caucus with unanimity the old ticket the organizationof that body will take but little timeand there is no reason outside of hisown possible desire for a days longertime why the president should notsend in his message to congresson opening day which is ratheran unusual happening All the househas to do after organizing is to drawfor seats and this can easily be donewhile the joint committee is on theway to the white house to notify thepresident that the Fifty fifth congressis ready for businessN Kev Dr 1 ii Martin of Chicagotalked of as -consul-general to HavanaGEN

followsGentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives When the present administration came into power it was confronted with alarge floating debt and an insufficient revenueto pay current expensesYour attention was called to this and reliefrequested at the last session You were asked to enact laws to abolish unnecessary offices reduce salaries curtail expenses provide necessary revenue prevent mob violencebut eachof these recommendations passedunheeded the result of which is that thefinancial credit of the state has suffered seriously expenses have increased and mob rulehas prevailed to an extent never heretoforeknown in this commonwealthMOB VIOLENCESince your adjournment a number of citizens of the state have been atrociously murdered by cowardly mobs In some instancesalthough guarantees of protection had beengiven they proved mere ropes of sand andalthough courts- were in session and in oneinstance the defendant on trial the sanctity ofthe law was ruthlessly invaded decency outraged and murder committed under pretense ofpurifying society and punishing crime Noapology or excuse can bo made for such conduct Those who congregate and conspire totake humanlife are legally greater criminalsthan those whose lives they seek or take forno crime is so base and repulsive astbat committed under cloak of pretended vindicationof law Such action does not deter criminalsor prevent crime Its effects are direful uponthe community and bring the administrationof jnstice into contemptThe condemned criminal suffers fearful andindescribable punishment and torture as heconfronts certain approaching death and notesthe silent passage of the hours that bringhim nearer to eternity Society is impressedwith his harrowing position and thus a legalcondemnation and tho execution which follows inspire horror in the mind of thedoomed man and fear in that of the would bemurderer The action of a mob on the otherhand begets a spirit of lawlessness and disregard for human rights and is the work ofonly a few moments leaving in its wake anindelible stain on the locality where it occurs dealing out punishment the swiftnessof which compared to that inflicted by thelaw is actual reliefNot only has hurffan life been lawlessly taken but rights of property have been disregarded and midnight raiders in the countiesof Franklin Woodford Lewis Madison Anderson Fleming Lincoln Mercer Washington and probably others have with impunityintimidated citizens closed aud destroyedtollgates and houses and openly defied thelawThe civil authorities have failed up to thistime so far as I know to convict and have almost universally failed to arrest any of themurderers and raiders who have thus disgraced the commonwealth This is a sad commentary on our civilizationRECOMMENDATIONSAt your last session you were earnestly asked in my first official communication to takesteps to prevent and punish mob violenceThereafter another message was sent to yourecommending the enactment of a law makingthe counties in which such outrages werecommitted responsible in damages to the legalor personal representative of the victims andgiving change of vefiue to other counties inorder that a fair trial might be had The samemeasures are now recommenueu togetuerwith such provisions as will make countiesliable in case of personal injury where death3oes not ensue- It is further recommended that in caseswhere prisoners in confinement may be armed without thereby enabling them to escapethe officer having them in custody shall havethe right to arm them in order that they mayresist such attacks No mob would be ableto stand before the prisoner fighting for hislife and the jailer or sheriff fighting for his officeSTATE INDEBTEDNESSThe manner in which claims against thestate have been hawked about and discountedtheir holders fleeced and shaved is discreditable Following is given a statement of thepresent condition of affairs and you are mostearnestly requested to enact such measuresas will liquidate the floating debt and promptly pay current expenses so that the credit ofstate and those to whom the state may become indebted will not suffer in the futurcPLAKS TO INCREASE REVENUEIt is suggested that the passage of a wellregulated law increasing the license fees ofwholesale and retail liquor dealers druggistsand distillers would produce considerablerevenue The same may be said of increasedlicenso fees on pool and billiard tables andother similar devices and of special taxes forthe sale of tobacco cigars etcThe licenseLfces for circuses and other entertainments might well be increased A feeof 2 might be charged for each commissionissued to an officerDELINQUENT TAXESUnder the presant law a large amount ofland is sold to the state for delinquent taxesUnder the decisions of the courts these salesaro null and void if all the hfns required bylaw for the collection of t x s by the sheriffand the assessment of taxes by the assessorhave not been strirtly complied with It issuggested that i law should be passed compelling the sheriff before he can receive credit from the auditor for his land sales to produce evidence that allthe necessary stepshave been taken to make the sale a lcgjl oneand thereby insure greater care on the part ofsheriffs and greater security to the state inthe purchase of these lands for delinquenttaxesThere is- no sufficient provision in the statutes for the collection of delinquent taxes onpersonal property In the large cities especially an enormous number of lists of delinquent personal taxes are allowed bv thefiscal courts and credited to the sheriff eachyear After the sheriff has received credit forthem he has no incentive to further attemptto collect them as the 4 per centis too small to recompense himfor the trouble of levyimr andmaking the proper search for property onwhich to levy on this class of juncs A lnvshould be passed authorizing some personother thi tils

Mag said that before flying from the house Angus raised meto the sofaPerhaps said the sheriff he hadno letter from Miss Hill and merelymade the assertion as a pretext to geinto the houseThat question Miss Hill could doubtless settle said Herbert but onething to my mind is clear his expectations were- to have the deed over andli o traces on his person and to haveentered the library and closed the bedroom door before my cousin descendedthe stairs O f course he did not expecttc see me again and when we bothconfronted him so suddenly with allthe evidences of his guilt before usthe reeking knife in his hand he wasstruck dumb He knew that he mustfly for his life and thus lose all thathe had hoped to gain as the result ofhis crime if indeed he hoped for gainat all He doubtless thought the

13 chapter 41 of Kentucky statutesprovides penalties against certain frauds laelections many of which are dead letters because section 3594 prohibits conviction uponthe testimony of a single witness unless sustained by strong corroborating circumstancesSurely such a safeguard as this to- the defendant is unnecessary in view of the fact that heis a competent witnessThe practice of corraling voters and withmoney and whisky persuading them to remainaway from the polls is Quite common It isalso common to hire men to remain away fromthe pollsThe law should prevent thisPUNISHMENT INADEQUATESection 1557 prescribes a fine of 50 and imprisonment in the county jail against anofficer upon whom a duty is imposed in chapter 41 who shall wilfully perform it in such away as to hinder the object of the law Aglance at the many importantduties which this section governswill demonstratcthat the punishment is entirely inadequate as to officers of registratioaand officers of regular and primary electionsIt is recommended that the law be carefullyrevised so as to severely punish ail violatorsthereof and make it sufficiently comprehensive to provide safety and security for thevoter and certainly that his vote will be fairlycountedSection 14 18 limits the appointmeut of officers of elections to housekeepers Many competent persons are excluded by this sectionand it should bo alteredIn addition to tho foregoing- suggestionsyour attention is called to Sectioni 1482 of thostatutes That section should be so amendedas to allow ballots to be counted even if nocsealed and certifiedas required if it should bomade to appear by proof positive or circumstantial that they are in fact the ballots concerning which there is a disputeThe voter should not be deprived of hi3right of suffrage

is absolutely necessary- It is represented too that unless some steps should betaken by your body to prevent it a portion ofJefferson county recently taken into the cityof Louisville will be denied the right to voteby reason of defective apportionment lawsThe framers of the present constitution determined to secure a just apportionment otthe state and for that purpose adopted suitable provisions No political party has thoright to invade or violate the rights or thepeople to just equality in the privilege of citizenship Ihe present general assembly being republican in one branch and democraticn the other is well constituted to make a fairapportionment of the stateSection 116 constitution requires Thegeneral assembly shall before the regularelection in 1891 divide the state by

executionInformation received from the commissioners develops some difficulty in carrying out the measure Some dispute hasarisen as to whethec separate houses areto be erected at different places It is suggested that experience at the deaf and dumbasylum blind aslum and house of reform in iLouisville has demonstrated that boys andgirls may be well controlled in one buildingbv beinjr separated from each other- Shouldthis be- recognized as the feasible course topursne and only one house established onlyone sec of oflicers would have-to-be appointedthus saving a large outlay by the stateThe

furnishing a soil mulch TheI spring tooth harrow is in rdality astrument to conserve moisture tneteeth should penetrate to the depth ofabout three inches and to produce thebett effect the ridges left by it shouldbe leveled off by a smoother which cannow be purchased as an attachment tothe harrow The tillage of orchardsby the harrow is now practiced extensively and nothing short of irrigationwill so nearly meet the demands of treesfor moisture particularly upon theheavier soils A harrow having a plowlike action of its blades serves topulverize the surface soil to spread tholcose mulch evenly and it leaves a mostexcellent seed bed The cutaway ordisc harrow may be beneficial or ofabsolute injury If the discs are soset that they cover buta portion ofthe surface of the mulch they leavea ridge exposed to the action of thewind and sun and the rate of evaporation is greatly increased The discshould be set at such an angle that thewhole surface shall be stirred or covered Their chief value lies in theircutting and pulverizing action on claysoils but as conservers of moisturethey are inferior to the harrow withplow like action or the spring toothSoils which need the disc brrowershould generally be gone over againwith some shallower tool Thlower the soil the lighter should be thework done by the harrow On mostheavy orchard soils it will be foundnecessary to use the heavy tools likethe spring tooth and disc harrows inthe spring but if the land is properlyhandled it should be in such conditionas to allow the use of a spike tootis orsmoothing harrow during summerThis light summer harrowing shouldbe sufficient to keep down the wedsand it preserves the soil mulch jij mostexcellent condition With such a jooland on land in good tilth a man canharrow ten or more acres a

her time for several years to therelief of distress among the very poorpeople of New York city succedded inopening- the eyes and likewise the poscketbook of a cynical rich man not manyflays ago She solicited financial aidfrom him and doubtless would havemet with a brusque rebuff had it notbeen that her- position in society commanded ijolite consideration As it wasthe rich man essayed to be patronizingand said My dear madaim I knowthat you try to do good among- thesepoor people but I can assure you thatyour efforts are practically wastedThey take your money and such clothing-and food as yon can- give them andthen chuckle over your gnllabilityIf I can induce a starving- creatureto chuckle I shall consider the timeand money well spent replied thewoman with a mild tinge of reproofOh well I suppose that you axebound to keep on wasting- your timeretorted the rich cynic After a briefpause he continued If you will demonstrate to me that you can actuallyrelieve distress with a dollar I willgive it to you just as of ten as you candemonstrate its usefulness in that directionWill you come with me asked thewoman thus challenged The rich manassented and accompanied his philanthropic caller to her coupe Both entered the conveyance and were driven tothe neighborhood- of Eleventh avenueand Fiftieth streetThe coupe stopped in front of an unsightly tenement In silence the manfollowed his companionup two or threeflights of stairs and he was soon standing-in a cheerless room about 12 feetsquare The floor and the walls wereabsolutely barren and there were notmore than four pieces of furniture insight One was a small stove in whicha scant fire was turning A middleaged man lay helpless on a cot andkneeling by him were a boy and a girlso raggedly clad that their white skinwas visible through more than onerent A few empty dishes and cookingutensils lying on the floor near thestove told their mute story of destitution The pathetic eagerness withIwhich the three emaciated occupantsof the room turned their glances uponthe visitors touched a long dormantchord of the rich mans heart He voluntarily thrust his fingers into his vestpocket but his companion laying arestraining hand upop his arnij advanced to the cot and in a delicate ttfiidSympathetic manner questioned theplowed in good season under ordinary I sJlnan r0egardin Wmself and hischildren She that theirconditions it is comparatively an easymatter to get the seeding done in goodseason JBut it is important vhat thev ork be done thorough There shouldbe no cutting and covering nor shouldthere be any skips If a stone or iootthrows the plow out the team shouldbe stopped and backed up and the furrow caught againWith ail spring crops it is an item tostir the soil thoroughly an cL reasonablydeep One of the essential conditions insc curing a good growth and yield is tohave the soil in a fine tilth when theplanting is done and thorough plowingis a great aid in getting the soil inthis conditiontIn order to lessen the work of theteams and at the same time lessen thecost of the plowing in many cases itwillbe found economical to use a somewhat larger plow one that tiums afurrow 14 or 1G inches in preference toone that turns only 10 or 12 With alarge plow and three good horses oneman will be able to do not only morework but better woTkIt is a good plan to take eer3r opportunity to plow Sod land can beplowed when fallow land would be toowet It is an exceptional case afterthis when it can be considered goodeconomy to plow old land when it is toowet to work readily into a good tilthWhile deep stirring of the soil isbest giving not only a better yieldbut lessening the risk of failure stillif the plowing is delayed until springit should be done very little deeperthan the land has been plowed beforeus bringing up to the surface of anygreat amount of fresh subsoil will provemore or less detrimental Deepeningold ground by plowing should nearlyalways be done gradually St
