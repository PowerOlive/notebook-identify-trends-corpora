Plenty to Do
I thought you told me Witson that
you intended to do business just the
same after you had moved into the sub
urbs I know you have plenty but I
always thought you one of those men
who insist upon dying in the harness
Yon were right about it my old
friend I believe that it would be im
possible for me to avoid spending at
least two or three hours a day on
change but my time is completely tak
en ap and I havent looked at a market
report for a month
Wouldnt believe it if any one else
told me How do you exist
Im having young trees set out get
ting a garden ready superintending the
building of a barn watching them pave
the street and having a continued kick
witb the assessors who seem to think
that my property is worth all I paid for
it
Youll soon have all that off your
hands I was afraid you might have
left us permanently
Oh Ive only commenced I have a
Jersey cow a pointer pup a tandem
two Berkshire pigs and a kodak be
sides
Never mind The cow the pup and
the kodak are enough Ill just tell the
boys that its all off so far as trade
with you is concerned You have three
fads that will keep you busier than a
coon in a bee tree Detroit Free
Press
The Undertakers Chairs
I see in the windows of undertak
ing shops said Mr Staybolt a pla
card which says thac campstools and
folding chairs are to hire there deliver
ed by express wagon I infer from this
that chairs must be hired out for other
than funeral purposes for festive occa
sions in fact as indeed I know of no
reason why they should not be
But they must lead a varied life
the chairs funeral one day and wed
ding it may be the next They know
when they start where theyre going
that is they know the nature of the oc
casion They can tell that by the wag
on they go in If when they are carried
out they find themselves put into the
black wagon of the undertaker they
know its a funeral theyre going to If
they aro put into just a plain ordinary
delivery wagon they know that they
are going to a wedding or a party or
some gathering of more or less gayety
but they cannot tell what will happen
next
Well I dont know that theres
anything so very remarkable about this
after all The experience of the chairs
is like that of the people who sit on
them They have their days of smiles
and their days of tears New York

Her Impressions of Angels
The wife of a well known senator
took her little daughter a 4-year-old
damsel to a matinee once to see Jack
and the Beanstalk A week or so aft
erward she was discovered pirouetting
and lifting her petticoats before a- che
val glass Her father reproved her and
told her it wasnt a pretty way to do
Why said tbe child I saw the
angels do it
The angels exclaimed her father
Why where
When mamma and I went to heaveit
that day said the child
The father explained that the fancied
heaven was only the theater The little
girls face fell
And wasnt they ai2gelsTsh9 asked
JSo said the father they were
just girls
The child put on aoaair a intense
disgust
Well she said I fink they ought
to be taked home and spanked Jcause
they wasnt dressed any more than an
