FRANK-BROWNING.
TheTmarriaKe of Miss Helen Frank
to Mr. Milton Gulp Browning waB cel
ebrated Wednesday evening at 7:30
o'clock at the elegant family home on
Broadway and High streets. Owing
to a recent bereavement in the familv
of the bride the wedding was verv
quiet, but beautiful in all its details.
Rev. W. E. Ellis, of the Christian
church, was the officiating minister,
and the wedding music was played by
Mrs. Minnie Muth Miller, of Nashville".
Tenn.
Onlv the immediate members of the
family witnessed the ceremony, to
gether with a few of the bride's' clos
est and most intimate friends. At
the appointed time the bridal chorus
from Lohenrgin, plaved on the piano
by Mrs. Miller, annourc2ri the ap
proach of the wedding partv. The
bride entered the parlor on "the arm
of her brother, Mr. B. A. Frank, who
gave her in marriage, and they were
joined bv the bridegroom and Mrs.
Buckner Woodford, Jr. The party
grouped in the folding doorway be
tween the parlors, while the ceremony
was performed by Rev. Mr. Ellis in a
solemn and impresBive manner.
The bride was charming and grace
fully gowned in her bridal robe of
clinging white crepe trimmed in real
lace, and her bridal veil was becom
ingly arranged as a Dutch bonnet. She
is the daucrhter nf tho into Mr qo
Wre. Louis Frank, of this citv. and is
a young woman of unusual attractive
ness, is noted for her beauty and love
ly disposition, and which haVe won for
her the admiration of all who know
her and has made her a social favorite.
The bridegroom, who is a former
resident of Versailles, now lives in
Cleveland, 0., where he is a prosper
ous young business man. He is very
popular and is in every way worthv
of the charming bride whose affection
he has won.
After the ceremony and congratula
tions the guests were served with ices
in candy baskets, when the wpdriino-
Noel Stivers Again Under Arrefct
Noel Stiver, sent to ths reform
school at Greendale, near Lexington,
because of his connection with several
burglaries.who escaped from the insti
tution last August and who has since
been at large was taken into custody
yesterday morning at 3 o'clock by
Patrolman Fred Link, in a room occu
pied by his father in the Ficklen build
ing on Main street.
The boy. who is aged about eighteen
years, is confined in the county jail
and will be returned to the reform
atory. Since his escape he told the
officers that he had been in Washing
ton, Pittsburg and other large cities
and returned to Paris about the middle
of September. While here he worked
with a street fair company that ex
hibited here, going awav with them
and later returniDg. He succeeded in
concealing his identity by a moustache
which he wore as a disguise.
It is believed by the police that
Stivers was implicated in the robbery
of the grocery store of A. W. Cot
tingham recently, where the cash reg
ister in the establishment was broken
ODen and a small amount of money
secured after an entrance to the build
ing had been effected through one of
the rear doors. It has been learned
that he had been seen in the vicinity
of the store on the night of the rob
bry. Patrolman Link received informa
tion that the boy had been spending
the nights at the Louisville and Nash
villepump station and made an effort
to locate him there, but without re
sult, and later found him in his
father's apartments. Last night he
telephoned the authorities at Lexing
ton of the capture of the boy and he
will return him to the reformatory to
day. A reward which W33 offered for
his apprehension will be paid to him.
