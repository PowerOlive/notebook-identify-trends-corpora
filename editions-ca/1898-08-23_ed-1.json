ETe Avoided Ncvrspapei Men but a Denver
Reporter Trapped Him Once Sent One
Man to Jim Kcenc BLow Ho learned
That Whisky Was a Bad Surveyor
There was nothing he detested more j
than newspaper notoriety Ho used to
dodge reporters and only one of them
as far as known ever Liirly outwitted
him Fred Skiff the city editor ot the
i Denver Trihune detailed reporter after I
reporter to interview Mr Gould during i
one of his visits to Colorado but each
brought hack word that the little rail- j
road king would not be seen and had
posted sentinels all along the hotel I
j ridors to drive intruders away So Skiff j
i set out to do the job himself He hunted j
LHEE3 is no more responsible position up a friendly Pullman car conductor
on earth than that of a railroad anl borrowed his uniform Ihen he
eer On his steady nerves clear brain i talked into the hotel and up the stairs i
bright eye and perfect self L00k a here said ho to the first i
npnd thfi sifotv of tlift train and the lives ii i ir riA t
of its passengers Dr Mles iNervine and
other remedies are especially adapted to v r
keeninsr the nerves steady the brain clear
to use it tomorrow Ivo got to take it i
back to Chicago
The sentry knew nothing ahont the
car of course and advised Skiff to see
Gould about it himself So Skiff success
fully ran the gantlet of the half dozen
lackeys growling all the time about tho
bother of being compelled to attend to
other peoples business Judge Usher
one of Goulds attorneys who was in
consultation with his client when the
bogus sleeping car conductor was shown
in immediately recognized Skiff hav
ing known him back in Kansas
When did you get out of the news
paper business inquired the astonish
ed lawyer I aint out of it replied
Skiff but I had to put on this disguise
in order to get in here to interview Mr
Gould
Young man said Mr Gould stern
ly if youre a reporter you can take
yourself right out of the room for I am
not to be interviewed
Skiff argued the point ananot being
invited to be seated coolly sat down on
the floor
Unless you put me out said he
I shall stay here till you tell me what
your plans are
This audacity pleased Gould Ho
looked at Usher and seeing the lawyer
chuckling heartily broke out into a loud
laugh
Well what do you want to know
he said finally in the tone of a man who
is wearied with objecting
Skiff knew he had triumphed He
produced his notebook drew up to the
table at which Gould sat and set indus
triously to work putting out questions
and noting the replies The result was
a reliable forecast of the immense rail
road enterprise in which Gould subse
quently embarked and of which the
public would not otherwise have been
forewarned
Less happy was the fate of the Chi
cago reporter who followed Gould by
rail down into Indiana and finally over
hauled his special car and knocked at
the door Mr Gould responded in per
son and the reporter held up his card
so that his victim could read it through
the glass window
The Chicago Bugle wants your opin
ion he shouted on the question of
refunding the 6 per cents
Mr Gould regarded him through the
glass with such a frigid expression that
the interviewer has shivered at the mere
memory of it ever since but finally
opened the door on a crack and asked
Young man do you wanfc me
Yes sir I want to interview you
on the subject of
Mr Gould began to shut the door
On the subject of the devil yelled
the indignant reporter as he saw all his
hopes fading away
Young man said Mr Gould open
ing the door once more an inch or two
on that subject you had better see Jim
Keene Hes got all the points and is
anxious to give them away to spite old
Plood
Gould always believed that the secret
of his ability to overcome others in any
contest of wits was his temperate habit
of life He never tasted whisky but once
In the days when he was a surveyor in
a small way and was mapping a county
on the practical line of getting lodgings
and meals of the farmers in exchange
for marking correct sundials on their
doorafceps he became tired one hot
dusty afternoon He came to a country
tavern In hi pocket was a 5 cent piece
It suddenly struck him that as i medi
cine to relieve f aintness he ought to buy a
glass of whisky with his nickel I was
ignorant of bar usage he said once in
describing the incident to a t riena and
so when a glass and a bottle were set
before me I filled the tumbler chock
full The bartender made no protest
and I swallowed the big horn Then 1
went my way trundling my wheelbar
row like measure of distances and occa
sionally taking the bearings with a sex
tant Never in my life had my work
gone off half so blithesomely and for
awhile I felt as though making a map of
the starry heavens instead of a Tery
dusty portiort of this mundane sphera
After an hour or more of exaltation I
grew sleepy and took a long nap under
a tree in a field I awoke with an awful
headache and found that the figures en
tered in my notebook during the time of
extra steam were quite incoherent I
was fully convinced that whisky was a
bad surveyor and I have never tried it
for any other purpose Cor Kate

Tea as Medicine
In some forms of heart disease tea
proves a useful sedative while in others
it is positively injurious Many cases
of severe nervous headache are instantly
relieved by a cup of strong green tea
taken without the addition of either
milk or sugar but it should be only occa
sionally resorted to in such cases it be
ing much better to avoid the cause
New York Journal
A BOLD BURGLAR
When I wm engaged in my profession
down south some ycrrsngo I was called on
to defend a young man whom I will call
Jake who was arrested for burglary He
was only 19 good looking and exceedingly
bright According to his story which I
found was true lie was left an orphan at
an early age and was brought up by his
grandmother who kept a small store in a
country town in Pennsylvania While ho
was reading with a Presbyterian clergy
man preparatory to his entering college
he became disgusted with his mode of life
and started off to look for adventures Ho
wandered away on foot and his money
was soon spent and he found himself one
night moneyless and houseless and al
most in rars He came across a planta
tion and tne lights in the great house
shone out bright and cheerful He turned
up a narrow path and soon found himself
with only a narrow coppice between him
and the house He crept through the cop
pice and saw that a large company thronged
tho big dwelling and were evidently hav
ing a good time Tho parlors were crowd
ed and lie saw that preparations had been
made for private theatricals Keeping in
the shadow he passed round to tho side of
the house and saw a window in tho second
floor brightly lighted Che sash was open
and a young man was inside evidently
putting on a dress for somo part in a play
Presently the light was turned down and
tho young man disappeared from tho room
After a time Jake went cautiously toward
the house and had a look at the situation
of tho window Walking round to tho
rear ho came across a ladder which ho
brought and placed so as to enable him to
reacli the window Ho ascended the lad
der and after satisfying himself that all
ws clear entered the room
On the bed lay a full dress suit no
doubt laid aside by tho recent occupant
and a handsome gold watch and chain at
tached to tho vest Patent leather shoes
lay on the floor On tho dressing table
was a pocketbook containing over 600 in
bills and a diamond ring and pin lay near
by In a valise lying open on a chair were
various articles of clothing He threw off
his brogues and put on the patent leathers
Then he drew on tho trousers which were
lying on tho bed His next act was to put
on a shirt taken from the valise a collar
and a necktie Ho arrayed himself in the
vest and dress coat and took a view of
himself in the large glass He unlocked
the door walked out boldly into the cor
ridor and turned toward the capacious
stairway In tho hall below gayly dressed
people were walking around Presently
a bell rang and these persons moved to
ward tho parlors into which they crowded
Jake calmly walked down stairs to ap
proach the door of the parlors After
standing for a few minutes gazing on the
scene he went toward the rack where hats
and overcoats were hanging Selecting a
hat which he thought would fit him ho
took ic from the rack and placed it on his
head It fitted well At the moment he
was selecting an overcoat a servant ap
proached and offered tolielp him He put
on tho coat with tho aidof the servant
and saying lam just going for a stroll
ho walked out of the door and away Ho
knew that there was a railroad station not
far away for he had seen the depot as he
came along and he turned his steps
thitherward
On reaching it he found that a train
was due and after asking the porter a few
questions he took a ticket for a junction
20 miles away The train camoJiina few
minutes later and ho got on board and
was soon steaming away In thepocket
of tho overcoat he found a case of line ci
gars one of which he lit On reaching
tho junction a train was waiting into
which he got and was whirled awayr ho
cared not whither
At daylight the train stopped for a quar
ter of an hour The young man who had
purposely dropped his hat while looking
out the car window as the name on the
hat might give hhn away asked the con
ductor where he could get another hat
There was a store opposite the station and
to that the conductor directed him and
there he got a soft felt hat Then he got
something to eat and went off with the
train Of course I could tell you just
where Jake stopped but thats not neces
sary By dusk he had reached Ja populous
city and there he parted with his over
coat and his dress coat and got new ones
in their places He went to a hoteL antL
had a good feed and treated himself to a
bottle of wine
He was too restless to- stay there all
nightr and so he took a train north and
in due time reached New York He bought
some things needful and put them in a
valise After seeing the town he deter
mined to visit his old home and you may
be sure his old grandmother was surprised
to see him It was dusk when he arrived
and he invented a story to- account for his
absence and improved appearance- The
old lady was suspicious- and told him her
mind and he grew alarmed fearing that
she might do something to endanger his
safety After she was fast asleep he left
the house went to the railroad station a
mile away and took a train for Ohio
How comes the- remarkable part of the
story It looks like an invention but it is
every word true Jake reached the place
to which he had taken his ticket next day
and staid there for a few hours Late in
the afternoon lie resolved to go farther
west and went to the station Many per-
sons were waiting as it was a junction
and several trains were expected A series
of whistles rang out and an engine and
tender appeared in a cutting approaching
at a rapid rate As the en sine passed
there was a loud report and something
shot up into the air It turned out to be a
broken nut It descended with terrific
force and injured a passenger on the plat
form of the station His son and daugh
ter who were accompanying him home
rushed to the spot and among the first to
render aid was Jake A doctor attended
to the in juredL man and he was removed to
a hotel near by The son had been atten
tively observing Jake for some time and
just as the wounded man was carried
away his son said to Jake
Will you be good enough to tell me the
time
The young fellow drew out the watch
which he had stolen and told the time
The son turned aside and spoke to an offi
cial and presently both came up to Jake
accompanied by another man This per
son said the son has in his possession a
watch and chain stolen from me at such a
time and place And he also wears a dia
mond pin taken at the same time I re
quest you to arrest him Exchange
