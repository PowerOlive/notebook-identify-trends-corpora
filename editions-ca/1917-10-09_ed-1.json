equally good. Their work was mark

the heavyweight. The catch was
made about half a mile above High
Bridge, Saturday afternoon. ,It took
the three, men two hours and a half

fish was brought back to Lexington
and photographed, after which'it was
'sliced up for dinner."

eases, Mrs. Ida Phillips Dickey, aged
ffty, wife of Rev. J. J. Dickey, re
cently pastor of the Hutchison Chapel
at" Hutchison, died at her home at
ton o'clock Friday morning.
Mrs. Dickey had been ill for several
months with a complication, whicn
her physicians were unable to diag
nose, and all that medical science
eoujd do was done to relieve her
suffering, but to no avail, and her
lifegradually ebbed away.
Mrs. Dickey was before her mar
riage Miss Ida Phillips, a native of
Fleming county, where her younger
ears were spent. She was known
to her host of friends as a conse
crated Christian woman, a gifted mu
sician and a teacher of more than
cidinary abililty and accomplish
ments. She was devoted to her
church and charitable work and was
untiring in her efforts in behalf of
both. Last winter, Mrs. Dickey, who
had just returned from a visit to her
venerable mother, Mrs. Phillips, in
Fleming county, was recalled there
when her mother was accidently
burned to death, and she never re
covered from the shock.
Besides her husband, Rev. J. J,
Dickey, she is survived by one sister,
Mrs. Mary Fleming, of Flemingsburg,
who was constantly with her for sev
eral weeks preceding and up to her
tleath.

ison Chapel Sunday afternoon at
two o'clock. The remains were taken
to Flemingsburg yesterday morning,
where the interment took place in

,K The folio wing -article regarding
the Rev. Ptei Robertson, of Cin
cinnati, is -'taken frojgrthe jCinpift-
nati uommerciai-Tribune of a re
cent date. Rev. Robertson was for
two or more years pastor of the
Presbyterian (Northern) church in
this city, in the building which is
now occupied by the George W. Da
vis establishment. Rev. Robertson
-vas a man of deep convictions and
intense loyalty to a cause, and those
in Paris who know him best cannot
wonder at the patriotism that led
him to offer his services to the coun
try. The article is as follows:
Rev. Peter Robertson, D. D., pas
tor 'of the Mohawk Presbyterian
church, is determined to do his bit in
the service of the United States in
the war with Germany if possible,
as a somier assigned to auty as a
baker. Not being able to enlist in
Cincinnati, Dr. Robertson has taken
the matter up with headquarters in
Washington, and has secured the a3-
njsistance of several of his prominent
friends in pushing his case. He sent
the following letter Tuesday:
"2363 Stratford Avenue, Cincinnati,
"September 25, 1917.
"Hon. Newton Baker, Secretary of
War, Washington, D. C:
"My Dear Mr. Baker The United
States Government is calling aloud
for thousands of bakers, and as that
craft is .mainly in the hands of Ger
mans in this county, and an evil re
port was published three months
ago of an effort to poison a large
body of United States Engineers by
means of the bread supply, I presume
to say, though father and founder of
the above church here, occupying a
very large field of usefulness, that I
am a full-fledged baker.
"When 14 years of age I served
three years in the Adelphia Biscuit
and Cake factory, Glasgow, Scotland;
learned much of baking by machin
ery as well as by hand. I added
four and a half years to complete
my apprenticeship. I worked one
year in Glasgow thereafter as a
journeyman. I came to Indianapolis
and worked there in every depart

"PETER ROBERTSON.."
Attached to the foregoing letter
were several from well-known Cin
cinnati men, also addressed to Sec
jetary Baker, commending Dr. Rob
ertson in the highest terms and de
claring his ability to fill any execu
tive of other position to which he
may aspire. Two letters from phy
sicians also were inclosed. Br. C.
R. Heebower's letter says in part:
"Dr. Robertson is a man of excep
tional executive ability and of the
highest practical Christian character.
Besides this, he has always had a
mostJexceptional physical constitu
tion, jwhich has enabled nim to ac
complish a vast amount of useful
work. His abilities are such as to
commend him to your serious consid
eration for any post in tire service of
our government to Vhich he may be
called."
A. p. Bircherd, M. D., says in his
letter: "This is to certify that I
have ma,de a careful physical exam
ination of Rev. Peter Robertson and
find him physically sound and in
good health. I have been his physi
cian for many years and know him
to be of good constitution, strong
and full of energy and capable of en
during a great deal of hard work."
