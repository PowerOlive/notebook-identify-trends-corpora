. Cantrill Addresses Bourbon
Voters.
Hon. J. Campbell Cantrill, candi
date for the Democratic nomination
for Congress from the Seventh Con
gressional District addressed the vot
ers of Bourbon county in the interest
of his candidacy at -the court-house
yesterday afternoon. A crowd esti
mated at about two hundred greeted
the Congressman but little enthusiasm
was displayed.
Mr. CantrilFs speech was along the
same lines as those delivered in his
paat campaigns. He referred to his
record in Congress and the interest he
had taken in legislation for the benefit
of the agricultural interests of the
State. Severe criticism was meted out
to the Lexington Herald for its active
campaign against his candidacy and he
denied the charges that had been
brought againbt him in a previous
campaign regarding the alleced bribe
paid him by John (J. Noel to change
his vote as to the location of the capi
tal, in which he declared he had been
vindicated by the court.
Nr. Cantrill paid a high compliment
to his opponent.Hon. H. A. Schoberth,
but in the same breath arraigned him
severely for breaking faith after he
(Cantrill) had befriended him in his
race for the Speakership of the
House.
March Court.
March court day was cold and dis
agreeable and while the crowd was
good considering the weather con
ditions, business vvss rather slow but
the merchants reported fair trade,
which is dua in a degree to the lage
amounts of money derived from the
sale of tobacco recently and which bus
been turned into the hands of the
farmers.
The mule market was rather brisk
owing to the approach of the spring
season when work stock will be in de
mand and a number of good sales were
made. Thetlemand was good and of
the 100 head which were on the mark
et a great many changed hands at
prices ranging from 8150 to 180 per
head.
Caywood & McClintock, 'who a few
days ago purchased the business of Mr.
Walter Clark, were on the market with
some fine mules and repcrt the follow
ing sales: Nine head to Asa Jewell,
of Liexington, for $1,630 ; 2 to Mr
Monson at $325; 2 to Oscar Henry at
$365; 2 head to Woodford Buckner,
$385 . 2 to Jeff Weathers, $375. They
purchased 6 mules at prices ranging
from $150 to $185 per hea. Very few
horses were offered but the supply
greatly exceeded the demand.
At the pens of M.J. Murphy & Co..
only one bunch of thirty-five head of
850 pound cattle were offered but
there was no demand and they were
left unsold.
MILLERSBURG ITEMS.
Beauty Hint.
Red elbows, says the Evening News,
are happily a thorn which may be re
moved. Saw off the red elbows, soak
them in a bleaching mixture of un
slaked lime, steep them in carbolic
acid, and they will never trouble you
again. Cold feet may be treated similarly.
Purchase Mule Barn.
Mr. H. S. Caywood.of North Middle
town and Mr. W. G. McClintock, of
Paris, purchased of Mr. Walter Clark
his mule barn on South Main street
and took possession Friday. The busi
ness will be conducted under the firm

Goodman the First to Report.
The first member of the Paris team
for the season of 1912 to report fop
spring training was B. F. Goodman,
who caie in Thursday night from his
home at Paintsvilie. The remainder of
the team are scheduled to report to
the Paris management March 20.
Goodman came in several days ahead
of the regular date set for reportiug,
but the fact that smallpox is raging in
a nearby town to Paintsvilie and for
fear of the disease spreading to his
home town, which in that event might
result in a quarantine, he decided to
come to Paris and make the best of
the time between now and the date set
for reporting in getting himself in
condition. Goodman looks the picture
of health and 'states that during the
winter he has taken on about fourteen
pounds. As soon as the weather per
mits he will begin active training and
hopes to be in excellent shape when
Manager Lewis and the other members
of the team put in their appearance.
CURIOUS BITS
OF HISTORY
A FIRE-FIGHTING INVENTOR.
By A. W. MACY.
John Lofting, a citizen of
London in the latter part of the
eighteenth century, had a pas
sion for fighting fires. Though
never a member of the fire de
partment, he always responded
to an alarm, and was usually
one of the first to arrive on the
scene. He rendered efficient
service, but would accept no
pay. He was a metal work
er by trade, and in 1792 he in
vented a contrivance to protect
the thumb while sewing. It
was a sort of bell-shaped cup,
hence It was called a thumb
bell. In the course of time this
was changed into the more
euphonious "thimble." The arti
cle is now worn on one of the
fingers while sewing, instead of
on the thumb as formerly,
xnougn. sailors stick to the old
custom.
