Tenement' House Damaged by
Fire. The fire department was called out
Wednesday afternoon in response to an
alarm from Box 31, near Eleventh
street, where a frame cottage was
burning fiercely.
The fire originated from a coal oil
stove, which wafi left burning in the
hall upstairs. It is supposed that the
blaze was turned too high and ignited
the paper on the walls of the narrrow
passage. The flames quickly spread,
the entire roof was burned and noth
ing was saved from the second floor,
the consents which were not destroyed
by the fire being ruined by the water.
The fire department prevented the
spreading of the fire to adjoining
frame structures, as a stiff breeze was
blowing. Ihe roof of the house be
longing to Mary A. Judy and the
stable belonging to Mr. W. L. Yerkes,
on the opposite of High street, caught
but no damage was done. The house
belonged to Mr. J. B. Northcott and
was occupied by four colored families.

Mystery Surrounds Discharge ol
Conductors.
The Cincinnati Enquirer of yester
day contained the following: "Mystery
surrounds the discharge of eight
passenger conductors on the Knox
ville-Cincinnati division of the Louis
ville and Nashville. Officials declare
that no conductors have been dismiss
ed from the service ot the road, while
the men and their friends declare that
they have been let go. The men were
let out on short notice, but why is a
mystery.
"About a year ago the Louisville
and Nashville put "spotters" on
trains, most of them being women. A
number of charges were turned in by
the "spotters," but no action was
taken by the road. Beyond admitting
that they have left the service of the
L. and N. the men, who claim that
they have been discharged, fdecline to
discuss their dismissal. When con
fronted with these facta officials of the
rod stenruously denied that any con
ductors had left the service.
"Humors were afloat yesterday,both
in Cincinnati and Covington that the
Order of Railway Conductors will be
called upon to take a hand in the mat
ter, as the local committee have
exhausted all means in their power
to get the men reinstated."

" Railway detectives. .
They Trace Those Who Steal or De
stroy Property of the Road.
The secret service Is a hard game
to tackle, but, like all kinds of work,
it has its easy jobs. One of them is
that of special agent for a railroad.
The agent is supposed to trace those
who steal or destroy railroad property.
When he is notified that a trunk or
other article of baggage is missing he
finds out by its number from where it
was sent and follows it on the books,
to the last station where it has been
checked. Then he notifies the police,
in the vicinity between the station
where the baggage was last checked
and the station where it should have
been checked. The police get busy,
and probably the property is soon re
covered and the thieves put in jail.
The baggage is then turned over to
the special agent, who notifies the rail
road official that he has recovered the
stolen goods.
If a freight car is robbed the spe
cial agent pursues the same tactics.
He finds out where the car was last
sealed and the place where the car was
reported as having its seal broken.
The police or constables in the coun
try between the two points are noti
fied, and if they fail to capture the
robbers the railroad may never hear
again of the stolen goods. Wherever
destruction has occurred to railroad
property it is usually police officers
who trace and arrest those guilty.
However, the special agent must
be a keen judge of human nature and
with sufficient tact to make himself
popular with the police officers in his
territory. Usually he is an old time
detective and is well enough acquaint
ed with detectives and police through
out the country to obtain results where
an amateur would fail.
THE JUDGE ERRED.
His Mistake Clearly Explained by the
Old Colored Woman.
The judge of the juvenile court,
leaning forward in his chair, looked
searchingly from the discreet and
very ragged piccaninny before his
desk to the ample and solicitous form
of the culprit's mother. "Why do
you send him to the railroad yards to
pick up coal?" demanded his honor.
"You know it is against the law to
send your child where he will be in
jeopardy of his life."
" 'Deed, jedge, I doesn't send 'im.
I nebber has sent 'im, 'deed"
"Doesn't he bring home the coal?"
interrupted the judge impatiently.
"But, jedge, I whips 'im, jedge,
ebery time he brings it. I whips de
little rapscallion till he cayn't set,
'deed I does."
The careful disciplinarian turned her
broad, shiny countenance reprovingly
upon her undisturbed offspring, but
kept a conciliatory eye for the judge.
"You burn the coal he brings, do
you not?" persisted the judge.
"Burns it burns it cose I burns it.1
W'y, jedge, I has to git it out ob de
way."
"Why don't you send him back with
it?" His honor smiled insinuatingly
as he rasped out the question.
"Send 'im back, jedge!" exclaimed
the woman, throwing up her hands in
a gesture of astonishment. "Send 'im
back! W'y, jedge, ain't yo' jest done
been told me I didn't oughter send my
chile to no seen dange'some and
jeopardous place?" Youth's Compan
ion. Bumps on the Head.
The lump raised by a blow on the
head is due to the resistance offered
by the hard skull and its close connec
tion with the movable elastic scalp by
many circumscribed bands of connec
tive tissue. The result of a blow when
the scalp is no cut is the bruising and
laceration of many of the small blood
vessels or capillaries. Blood or its
fluid constituent, serum, is poured into
the meshes of the surrounding con
nective tissue, which is delicate,
spongy, distensible and cellular, and
the well known bump or lump is quick
ly formed. This cannot push inward
at all and naturally takes the line of
least resistance. Similar bumps may
be formed on the skin in exactly the
same way, for the shin bone also is
covered only by skin and subcutaneous
connective tissue.
The First Iron Bridge.
The first iron bridge ever erected in
the world and which is in constant use
at the present time spans a little river
in the county of Salop, on the railroad
leading from Shrewsbury to Worces
ter, England. It was built in the year
1778 and is exactly ninety-six feet in
length. The total amount of iron used
in its construction was 378 tons. Ste
phenson, the great engineer, in writ
ing concerning it said, "When we con
sider the fact that the casting of iron
was at that time in its infancy, we
are convinced that unblushing audac
ity alone could conceive and carry into
execution such an undertaking."
Fertile Socotra.
Socotra, a large island in the Indian
ocean, is one of the least known of
the inhabited parts of the world. .It is
mountainous, but very fertile, and in
ancient times was famed for frankin
cense and myrrh, aloes, dragon's blood
and spices. But now Sumatra and
South America produce more dragon's
blood.

Deiih-Dealin Gun.
The United States Navy is 'planning
a new 16-ineh gun which will make the
present world beating 14-inch gun
obsolete.
The navy has justefinished one of the
fourteen-inch guns, but it has been
heard .that some of the nations, Japan,
especially, are also building the same
calibre to keep pace with the situation
in case the world is awakened from its
dream of jpeace.
The plans for the new gun have
been made by Admiral Twining, Chief
of the Bureau of Ordnance. The
length of the gun will be 67 feet. It
will carry a shell weighing 2,000
pounds and will be effective at 15
miles, thus proving that the horizon
cannot put a limit to modern naval
science. ,
The fourteen-inch gun fires a shell
weighing 1,400 pounds and has a range
of 11 miles.
Two New Clubs in Blue Grass
League.
A news dispatch from Lexington
says: "President Thomas A. Sheets,
of the Lexington club of the Blue
Grass League, announced here this
morning that the Blue Grass League
will invade Covington and Newport
next season, having clubs in each of
those cities, thus' giving the league
eight clubs and putting it probably in
ClaRs C instead of Class D, where it
now is.
"All clubs in the league will remain
unless Wincnester drops out. and iE it
does, Mt. Sterling wants a franchise
bBdly.
"Preisdent Neal, of Louisville,
talked the plans over with the present
league officials here, and all agreed on
the proposed scheme. This is the first
time those cities have ever been in
vaded by the Bluegrass baseball
organization."
