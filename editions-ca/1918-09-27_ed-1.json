YOU CANN07 BUY
TWO DOLLARS FOR ONE
: 2fohody is coming around' dffering to' ;sell Two Dollars iff b
real ..money for One Dollar. To be sure, there are many good!
xinyestment opportunities where' One Dollar will buy a chance? .
to make Two, Three, even .Ten. But after the other fellow
has taken the risk and reaped the harvest he is not going to ;
sell it to you at first cost. f
Of course, it is not wise to jump at every proposition that
5omes along. Before investing your money you should make a
thorough investigation and not place your earnings in a doubt- '
ful undertaking. There are too many good roads to fortune
fo fake bad ones. ; ijf
The Bourbon Oil and Development Company is a Paris in
stitution, which invites the closest investigation. It has pass-
ed the doubtful stage. It. has found the road to success. Those
who go along with it are marching to certain,' fortune. "
You can no longer buy Two Dollars for One : in Bourbon "" '
stock.' The figures are reversed. A Dollar-Share of Bourbon
is now worth Two Dollars. .It oon will '. bd worth Three,
.lour, "Five, Ten or Twenty. , Many oil stocks have doubled ten
times over with less valuable properties to bact them up than
the Bourbon has. Bourbon stock is a better bargain now at
$2 than it was once at 50 cents. f
Only a small amount of Bourbon stock remains' fo be sold. ,
