Everything as nearly perfect as is humanly possible.Mabley's Invites You To Call.,Retired farmers who move to townseldom find city life "what it iscracked up to be," according to W.D. Nicholls, head of the farm economics department, of the College ofAgriculture.Farm management studies whichhave been made in Kentucky pointout this fact as one of the mostdetrimental to country life, he said."Such movement often fails tobring contentment and pleasure anticipated and the retired farmer inmost cases' is not satisfied with thechange. Time hangs heavily on hishands and living expenses are higherthan he anticipated. He then feelsit necessary to exact the last pennythat can be expected from the tenant on his farm thereby making the'latter dissatisfied and destroying theincentive of the renter to keep upthe land and take care of the improvements." These facts are significant inworking-out satisfactory leasing contracts betweent landlords and tenants in Kentucky where more thanone-third of the farms are rented,according to Mr. Nicholls."It has been found that it oftenis better for the landlord to retireon his own farm, renting the landout on a share basis to a younger,more active man," he continued."In this way, the owner continuesto take an interest in the management problems and can give thebenefit of his long farming experience and trained judgment in buying and selling."THE PROPER COURSEInformation of Priceless Value toEvery Paris CitizenxMv mJMr mabteuimtvdatw(di& n VATI'TtrCINCINNATI, OHIOHow to act in an emergency Isknowledge of inestimable worth, andthis is particularly true of the dis-1eases and ills of the human body.
