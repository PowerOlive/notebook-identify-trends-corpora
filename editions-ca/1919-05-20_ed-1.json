RM. CALDWELL.
The commencement exercises of
due M. M. I. opened Thursday morn
ing' at 9:00 t'clock, with the annual
-competitive drill at 8:00 a. m. The
Cadets met the band at the train, go
ing in parade from the depot to the
college grounds. The day was beau
tiful, the crowd fully up to the aver
age, and all the exercises of the
morning compared favorably with
former years. The medal in the man-ual-atjarms
was won by Cadet Carey,
of Lexington, and Company A. carries
the flag next year, winning over
CVvm.na.Trvr B. In the afternoon at
2:30 was an intejesting ball game
ganie1 between the M. M. I. and old
Carets. Another large crowd was in
attendance, the score standing 15 to
8 in favor of M. M. I. at the close
of the game.
Owing to, the Cadets having been
quarantined-on account of the "flu"
conditions, until last few weeks, they
li&ve flayed no games this season, ex
cept among themselves.. From their
brilliant playing Thursday after
noon, they demonstrated the fact that
they have a good team, and had they
had' an opportunity might have won
many laurels for themselves with all
of our surrounding teams. At 8:15
. pi., Thursday, the M. M. I. Cadets
put -on a minstrel at the Drill Hall.
They were greeted with another large
audience. The cast was large and
wclf-staged, and in their solos and
choruses were the recipients of many
encqres. Tuesday at 10:30 a. m. a
large audience assembled at M. M. I.
Auditorium to be present at the com
mencement exercises. At the ap
pointed' time the class of 1919, four
teen incumber, headed by Col. Best,
marched into the hall, 'taking their
places on the stage. After the splen
did musical program, a brilliant ad
dress was delivered by Dr. Fortune,
of Transylvania University, of Lex
ington. The address was in keeping
with the times and the occasion. It
was both powerful and simple. It was
one that everyone could carry home,
and was certainly calculated to in
spire all ambitious young men. At
tne close ot the address Col. Best,
in an appropriate address, awarded
the diplomas. Class honors were
won by Cadet Yates, of Virginia,
while the highest average nt tho
school during the year was won by
oaaet van Meter, of Winchester, af
ter which the officers for the coming
year were announced. At 11:30 a
furlough to the M. M. I. Cadets was
granted until September 10, most of
the Cadets leaving: for their vpsnoot.
ive homes in the afternoon and even
ing, the remainer Saturday morning.
The commencement exercises of
the M. C. opened at 8:15 n m fh.
day with a brilliant recital in the M.
u. Auditorium by the advand nn.
pils in music. Notwithstanding the
cm ea.Lemng weatner a large audi
ence was in attendance. The exer
cises were good. The young ladies
were at tneir best. A laughable
farce, entitled. "The Broken EiifRPP.
ment," opened the exercises and made
a most pleasing beginning, and was
followed by a number of trood vnoni
selections, solos and choruses, and
aiso pantomine work. Saturday at
10:30 a, m. the biennial meeting of
M. F. C. and M. C. was held at the
M. C. Auditorium. Quite a, mimher
of the Alumni were present from
all the surroundincr towns, and a fw
from other States. The address was
delivered by Rev. W. E. Eillis, of the
Paris Christian church. At noon a
delightful banquet was served in the
college dining room, at which a -num-
oer or toasts were responded to, and
in the afternoon an informal recep
tion was held in the library and par
lors of the college. At 8:15 t. m.
Saturday another large audience
assembled in the M. C. auditorium,
at which time the young ladies of
tne college put on a two-act play,
entitled "The American Girl," which
was good and well tendered. The
work was also largely made up of
solos and choruses, and everyone
went home well pleased. Sunday at
10:45 a, m. the Methodist church
was filled to overflowing, at which
time tne .saccular eate sermon was
preached by Dr. H. C. Morrison, of
Asburry College. Preceeding the
sermon was a good and well-selected
musical program. Dr. Morrison did
not come to us as a stranger, there-
tore we knew wnat to expect, but he
gave most of us more than we ex
pected. He took for his text, "What
Doth It Profit A Man If He Gained
the Whole World and Loseth His
Own Soul." Many believed, that they
were going to listen to an evangelical
sermon, but this, however, was not
true. He launched out into the
problems of to-day, and his sermon
was one that will always be remem
bered by those who heard him. See
next issue for a continuation of com
mencement exercises.
