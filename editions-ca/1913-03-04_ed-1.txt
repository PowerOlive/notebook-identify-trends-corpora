For the local department to respond to the call the permission of Mayor Hinton had to be secured and he ordered the engine and several lines of lmse taken to the scene toprotect the proDerty adjoining.When the hre department arrived onthe scene the building was enveloDedin flames and brisk wind was fanningthem fiercely. For a' time the warehouses and cattle irarns adjoining wereimperiled, as tmf wind blowing fromthe West carried the sparks and flamesin their direction.A sudden decline in the temperaturemade the work of fighting the firedifficult and those who were handlingthe lines of hose sufiered intenselyfromthe cold. Good work, however,resulted from the'ir efforts as the firewas confined to the building in whichit originated and no damage was suffered to any of the adjoining buildings. While the origin of the fire is unknown it is the opinion that Upstartedfrom a spontaneous combustion" in tnedust room or from some kind of an explosion in the boiler room. When theflames were discovered they were blazing fiercely in that part of the building. A sudden change in the course nf thewind probably saved the cattle barnsin which were housed 875 head of cattle, each chained to the trough racks.They were the property of Jonas Weil,of Fayette county, and were being fedat the distillery. Had the wind continued in that direction all of the stockwould have Derished, as the barns areframe structures and the flames couldhave been easily communicated tothem.In the grain rooms were about 9,000bushels of grain, which together 'witha car of shelled corn on the siding,which was waiting to be unloadedwere destroyed. The warehouses containing about 30,000 barrels of whiskywere not damaged and none of thewhisky was destroyed, although workmen were prepared to remove as muchwhisky from the buildings as possiblein event the fire was communicated tothem.The distillery which had a capacitvof about 60 barrels per day had neen inoperation since January 1, and sincetnat time had been running at fullcapacity. Since the operations beganabout 5,000 barrels of whisky had beenrun. As a consequence of the fire theentire iorce oi men employed ac me anlnnt- in thp. nnmhpr nf sp.wentv-hve.were thrown out of employment. The &,loss on the proi erty is fully covered by S?insurance. The only part of the building which was not destroyed was thebeer room in which were more than1 100,000 gallons of beer. Th;s portionwas Eaved from destruction by a bricKwall fulling upon the part adjoiningthe building, proper, demolishing alarge section and smothering '-out theflames which had begun to eat theirwav into the frame structure.The cattle which were being fed atthe distillery wdre shipDed away asrapidly as possible Sunday, as therewas not sufficient slop to supoly themover one day. More than ninety carswere employed in moving the eattle.The fire furnished a very spectacularscene which was witnessed by a largenumber of residents of this city whowould not venture out in the cold. Theburning copper served to produceflames on many hues and when thegiant smoke stack, loosed from itsmoorings by the flames, fell to theground, caused myriads of sparks tomount high into the air.Since the construction of the distillery at the close of the Civil War ithas been operated by many firms.The original owners were George 'M.Bedford and W. T. Buckner, who operated the plant until 1880 when it wasbought by Samuel Clay, Jr.. & Co.,and later'sold to the Welsh DistillingCo., of Covington. Later it was absorbed by the Kentucky Distillers &Warehouse Co., which is known as thewhisky trust. At'the plant was madethe famous Sam Clay" whisky whichname was derived from the product ofone of its former owners.Nothing definite is knownas to whatplans for the future are being considered but it is probable4the distillingplant will be reconstructed and comnleted by the coming fall when it willbe placed in operation. This distilleryis the only one which has operated inEourbon county for a number of years,as all of those controlled by the Jrusthave been dismantled, and the machinery and pquipment taken away.Yesterday afternoon the beer room,which escaped the flames Sunday morning caught fire, and was consumed.Every orecaution had been taken andit waslthought there was little dangerof the smouldering ruins breaking intoflames. The fire started about noonand little coulcTbe done rjo check itsspread until the remainder of the building had burned to the ground.'II?&'.firK&J& .v-AJUiV"IPBJCNOW HOWF.J. ti&J"1.Great ReductionsMON$,ainter Suits0- 't aANDOvercoatsNkwAnd All Winter Goods4''J5Come ESrly and Take Advantageof Reduced Prices.Of "k'- ,ji p ?vee Our ootw&arMitchell & Blakemore,W r"fcMflft"FSff-f-4irc f-4-b rVIrtrtikiaris, KentuckyHiMH).5v.42 Es9 IIMtimiiiiiimiiijiiniinmi iinniiiiiiiiiiiiiniiiiiiiiiiiinTiiiiiiiiiiiririuniiiiiiiiniiiiiuiiiiuuMiiuiiiiiiiiiiiiniiuiiiiiiHFRANK & COSThe Store Where Reliability Reigns.TtAnnounce'V.o'J0h0 m!sww ?-?lt Splendid Showin,.

JHorse racing in this country was allhot .killed a few years ago by thosewho-called themselves its friends, butwho in reality were its worst enemies.There is now a chance of it ' being resuscitated, aa the result of a judicialdecision in New Yark State, Moldingthat oral betting is not illegal.If the New York race tracks reopen,the sport "will enjoy a revit al throughou the countrv. The prospect givesgreat satisfaction to horse owners andhorse lovers generally. Racing in itself is so harmless and yet so pleasurable that it deserves.support and encouragement rather than condemnation. The breeding of fine horses alsodeserves'ancouragement, and one wayot g!ving;this encouragement is the!holding of properly 'conducted racingmeets.In reviving "tha sport of kings."however there should be no revival ofits old attendant evils, especially thegambling evil. It was the scandalousmanner in which 'sports was formerlyconducted that led to the' enactment oflaws which resulted in the closing ofso many race track gates. Those whowere responsible for such legislationhadnothinggainst the Ahorse or thehorse lover; it was the professionalgambler they were after, the bookmaker, who had Decome a stench in-& noatrils of decent citizens.

Tilton advises -that Governor McCreary keep off the track irrtheSenatorial contest, in which it is saidhe will oppose former Governor Beckham. The Advocate in a-recentrjssuehas the following about the Senatorialcontest ;"Time will bring forth the announcement of Gov. J.B. McCreary for United States Senator, is the opinion ofpoliticians who have been watchingthemaneuvers of his closest politicalfriends, and it is the opinion of manyDemocrats of this county that thestep will prove a serious one to thjs,good old Democrat, who has been honored often by the highest positionswithin the gift of the Democrats ofthis State. To our way of thinking itwould be much better to round out hisactive political life by retiring afterhis present term of office expires,rather than possibly meet defeat andbe dead politically." .That Governor Beckham standshighly with the Democrats of. Woodford county-is seen in tho following"dispatch from Versailles to the Louisville Post published recentlv :"Former Governor J. C. W. Beckham spent 'yesterday in Woodfordcounty in the interest of his candidacyfor the Democratic nomination -vf orUnited States Senator, to be voted upon in the August primary election.He received the personal pledges ofhundreds of Democrats during theday, many of whom were opposed tohim or for another candidate, when hewas last before the Democracy ofthis state. All day-long on the streetsof Versailles he was surrounded byWoodford county citizens. He-did r.otmake a speech, contenting himselfwith shaking hands and talking withhis friends relative to his candidacy."There has been quite a change ofsentiment toward the former Governorby those in this county who have op-Dosed,him in the paBt. He has alwaysbeen strong here, -but his strength has jgrown in the years he has been out ofpublic life and office, and it, may besafely stated that he would now' get alarge majority in Woodford . countyover any Democac in Kentucky, whomight aspire to an office against him."While here Gov. Beckham informed bis friends that he proposes tomake an active canvass before thepeople of Kentucky for the Senatorialhonor of which he was robbed by theperfidvofthe so called Democrats alew years back when W. O. Bradley jwas sent to the United States Senate."Within a month the former Governor proposes to get in the campaign"right and keeoftat it daily until the davof the August primary."Following an effort to get a line onthe voters of Garrard county an adherent of Governor McCreary who hadbeen sent there for that purpose, wascompelled to return to the capital.witnanything but assuring news. The' voters ot uarrara put a stamp of disap- jDroval on the proposed candidacy ofMcCreary which is indicated by theiollowing dispatch from Lancaster:"Col. George T. Farris, ex-StateSenator from this district, and nowprivate policeman of the Capitol, atFrankfort, under appointment of Gov.McCreary, was here court day, andtook occasicn to sound out a number ofthe leading Democrats of Garrardcounty in regard to the sentimentwhich exists here toward Gov.' "McCreay making the race lor the democratic nomination for United StatesSenator! ''l'A large majprity cf the responseshe met with were in no way favorableto the Governor making this race.Many Democats who have been McCreary men in all hia previous campaigns told ' him that not only werethey opposed to hi making the, race,but that they intended to vote forBeckham for Senator, and that 95 percent ox the Democrats of Garrard feltthe same way about the matter."Men like John M.

The theory of the tests which may'lead to the cure of a broken leg infour or five days is based upon thepossibility of accelerating the processes whereby nature repairs injuries to its organisms by the replacing of diseased or broken tissues withstrong and healthy ones. In otherwords, it indicates the possibility ofthe growth of tissues at a much fasterj rate than is the case in the ordinarycourse of events. Wonders have been,accomplished in this direction in experiments with plant life, and evenwith animal life in its lower forms.The achievements of a hothouse or otan incubator are merely incidents inthe same 'progress toward aiding the.impulses of nature. Bees are aided intheir gathering of honey by the cunning of the apiarist, who furnishes thetiny workers with glucose at the doors,to their hives, and thus saves themthe long labor of flying from flower toflower. The soil is enriched and itsproductive functions are stimulated byan artificial supply of phosphates andother elements needed for the renovation of its spent energies. Life-givingproperties in the air itsel fare enhanced and focused to a given point,by the use of oxygen when life is atthe vanishing point. It is not hard to?believe that Dr. Carrel Is right in hisforecast of the time when the processes of the replacement of injuredcells In the human body will,-' be sostimulated by scientific treatment that -thereign of pain on earth will hegreatly curtailed. ..One Virtue. .Poverty is no dicsraco, but Ihtabout all that can be said initsfsyr.Detroit ITee' Precs.

The music did not bore him and, moreover,Daisy Hiltson was with him, and hewas enjoying Daisy's society evenmore than the opera. He reflectedthat he had simply wasted his timetaking other, girls to the opera, whenhe might have engaged Daisy for theentire season if he had had his witsabout him. Lannigan,' however, feltcomplacent and at peace with, theworld.At the first intermission a handtapped Lanigan's- shoulder. "Let mesee your checks, please," quietly saida voice accompanying the, hand. Lannigan stiffened indignantly. Then,fishing in his pockets for his checks,he frostily passed them back over hisshoulder."Wrong seats," murmured the voice."Sorry, but you belong on the otherside of the house.""The dickens I do!" Lannigan exploded. "These areseason tickets, I'dhave you know. I've sat here all winter" . c"Sorry!" said the imperturbablevoice, "but the people who own theseseats are waiting for 'm, and you'llhave to move."Lannigan absolutely choked withrage. That this should happen of allnights on the night when Daisy waswith him ! He controlled himself withan effort and spoke out of the side ofhis mouth over his shoulder: "Ishan't move!""Sorry!" said the inexorable voice."I hope you won't make a scene. Ifyou don't go I'll have to put youout."Lannigan boiled over. "It'll take abigger man than you are to do that!"he said very audibly. "You confounded" "Oh, I'm big enough," drawled thevoice, insultingly.Lannigan, whirling around with bloodin his eyes, confronted the grinningface of Phillips, one of his bestfriends.Daisy giggled audibly. "I thoughtI'd die!" she gasped, mopping hereyes with a whisp of handkerchief."Really, I never saw anything donemore cleverly, Mr. Phillips. I didn'trecognize you at. first myBelf; thislight is so dim. I never saw anythingso funny in my life. Mr. Lanniganwas so so- perfectly belligerent!""Phillips never will know how nearhe was to going over the railing," declared Lannigan, grimly, still weakfrom the shock.It quite spoiled the opera for him.Besides upsetting his calmness ofmind and his self-satisfaction, he hadan , additional worry. He did not atall like Daisy's open admiration ofPhillips' brightness. Lannigan wasat the nervous stage in his courtshipwhere the blowing of straws pointedthe way. Then he had an inspiration."Phillips is so frightfully careless,"Lannigan told Daisy a week later,when again he was taking her to theopera. "He'll never once look at thedates. Oh, I wrote him the nicest sortof note. I told him that I thought Iowed it to him and hoped he could usemy opera seats tonight as I could notand I sent him tickets for a monthago that I didn't use. I know himhe'll ask some girl and when the manat the door turns him down he'll haveto buy seats and I hope everything'sgone but the dearest ones. That'llserve him right!""How aw-fully funny!" giggled DaisyHiltson. "Really, that's terribly bright,Mr. Lannigan. How clever it was ofyou to think of that."Lannigan beamed. He felt comfortable again and fully reinstated inDaisy's admiring opinion.Almost obstreperously he presentedhis tickets to the man at the door.There was a colloquy. Then takingDaisy by the arm, Lannigan led heroiit of the crush and, with a muttered"Excuse me just a moment, please,"he vanished."What's the matter?" Daisy asked,bewilderedly, when he returned fromthe ticket office.Lannigan looked- confused. "Oh,nothing,", he said, heavily.

KingdomCome1 resolved to put a woman, ofthe Vxiginia mountains into a novel,he followed his old plan of hewing atrail into the remotest spot of ijie-Appalacbian Mountain chain, where no.dust of the outsid world had penetrated ; a place where he could find theideal representation ot the natural andthe human. He went and 'returnedand gave the world the delightfulstory, "The Trail of the LonesomePine." .Eugene Walter read the book, -followingthe trail, as Mr. Fox had blazedit, wrote his plav in a mountain vCoVe""and his visualization of the primitivemountaiii girl, June, has delightedthousands. ' 'Mr. Walter admits that his sojournin a Virginia mountain cove wasamong his most interesting experien-.ceg. A few days after his arrival at'Lonesome Cove he invited a mountaineer to give his opinion as to whetherthe tract of land had ever been at thebottom of the sea, as the sides, bearthe marks of erosion. The mountainer replied, "Ef it 'twar so, 'iwar before his pappy's or his grandpippy'stime."l'nese coves were the first points-settled because they afforded abetterboth from the weather, which is oftensevere, and from the pursuing attentions of former neighbors in the valleywhose ideas of equity were undulywarped by a too thorough appreciationof merely legal technicalities. Thedescendants of these first settlers-howoccupy the ground first cleared'-bythem, and the courteous mountaineer'first mentioned who so delicately -veil-edhis probable conjecture that hisgeological questioner was a "plumeejit," might have made his point stillstronger by presenting the same -evidencefrom. hiB granpappy's graripappy. But the interest of the averagemountaineer in public or private history seldom carries him far enough, toinquire beyond the generations withwhom he has a speaking acquaintance.Little is known about the first settlements. There are no tombstones?There are few, comparatively fewtraditions. Those exist ng are apt tobe considered ecxlusively with familytraits and incidents illustrative of thecourage and generosity of the "covitea." The nride f birth, as well asthe refuse of the Vere de Veres, isJthemnnnf Qinoor'a alsn A nAiinn mnri rrmaiden of matrimonial aspirationwould find it a serious drawback to belong to "white liwered" kin, especiallyif the "coveted partner occupied thenormal position in being Tallied to good"fightin' stock." , '.Any business to be transacted is preceded by a decorous silence. Nothingso offends the good taste of the mountaineer as vulgar haste. The socialside of the mountaineer is very charming. He is perfectly at ease withoutbeing self-important, he makes fewblunders and ignores those that otherpeople make ; indeed he is always considerate of other people's feelings.His conversation is characterized by agentle humor, tinged with sarcasm,but whatever he pays gains a charmfrom his peculiar drawl and intonation. Whole phrases may be eluded,but every syllable of every word usedis dwelt on with solemn deliberation.He seldom argues and never contradicts, for to contradict is equivalentto "givin' a man the lie." an intolpr-able affront which can only be wipedout by a rifle ballSOTHERN AND MARLOWE ATLEXINGTON.E.

WCouncilman Walker says we conveyed a wrong impression in stating inour last issue that he opposed a franchise for natural gas at the last meeting of the City Council. He says whathe opposed was recognizing the franchise notice as an ordinance. , He sayswe also prred in stating that that wasthe only thing of importance that!transpired at the meeting, as he hadopposed the paying of the city workhands every Saturday as it was contrary to law to so pay them.We may ha"e been wrong in thinking that Mr. Walker was opposed tothe franchise, but we based our conclusion not only on the fact that he opposed the ordinance as published, onthe grounds of a technical legal error,but also from the fact that when theordinance was read and offered in theway in which he had suggested wouldbe legal and when the yea and nayvote was called on the ordinance toadvertise the sale of a natural gasfranchise when Mr. Walker voted nay,all others, except perhaps one, votingyea and carrying the ordinance.The ordinance, however, was reconsidered and rejected unanimously because Col. Stewart, representing thenatura gas people statedytfe would notbid on ' the ordinance in the form in;which it was offered as the companyobjected to some or the terms laiddown for a guarantee that they wouldcarry out theircmtract and actuallyfurnish natural gas within a specifiedtime. He stated however, he thoughtthat if the matter were deferred toanother meeting he thought satisfactory terms could be argeed-upon.As to the other important pointwhich Mr. Walker says was omittedwe did not intend to slight the matter.Mr. Walker did oppose the weeklypayment of the day laborers as he considered it illegal to do so and askedthat they should wait for;their moneyuntil it could be allowed at rthe regular Council meetings every two weeks,but as the explanation was made thatthere had been standing on the city'records for a number of years a resolution that the day laborers be paidtheir wages each week we did not consider that this was a very importantmatter, as the Council voted not tochange the custom.Fire, wind and lightning insurance.
