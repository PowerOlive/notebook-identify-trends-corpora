Investigating School Census
Here.
The school census of the city of
Paris is under investigation bv in
spectors from the Educational depart
ment at Frankfort. The report made
ti the State Department shows a total
population approximating 38 per cent,
of the entire population of the city.
This is consideied abnormal,' as
twenty-two per cent is considered an
average, according to Superintendent
of Pubic Instruction Barksdale Ham
lets.and thrity per cent, very -unusual.
This high figure has caused the State
Superintendent to send two inspectors
here, and Saturday Messrs. Marion
Pogue and T. W. Vinson visited Paris
with the obiect in view.
While the inspectors were here they
were in consultation with Superinten
dent George W. Chapman and County
Supetitendent Miss Mabel Robbins.
The report of the inspectors has not
been made oublic and it is the oninion
the matter will be left in the hands of
the local school authorities, a3 it is
said they have shown a disposition to
rectify the matter and they had no in
tention ot padding the census.
President Clitton ArnsDarger of
theParis School Board said" yesterday
he did not know the result of the in
vestigation conductedby the inspect
ors on their visit to Paris, and an
effort will be made to reach Mrs.
Newton Clark, the local truant officer,
who compiled the census of the city,
with a view of straightening the mat
ter out at the earliest possible date
and to the satisfaction of the State De
partment. Mrs. Clark is at present
out of the city but the mattecr will be
taken up immediaely upon her return.

are finding hard to solve. It is tyjU
protection of Oi Sen, a Chinese slavej
girl, when slie shall have been re
leased from custody after testifying
against two members of the powerful
Hop Sing Tong. They are facing
death for killing a young Chinaman
of modern ideas who tried to rescue
the girl from" slavery.
Members of their band have threat
ened the girl's life and declare that
some day and somewhere no matter
what the authorities may do a high
binder will reach Oi Sen and she will
be slain. The Hop Sings have
branches wherever there are Chi
nese settlements, and it is known they
will protect members and take ven
geance on anyone who transgresses
their code.
Oi Sen was a slave of Wong Si
Sam, whom she describes as a high
binder and a hatchet man. On the
witness stand she asserted that fre-
quently members of the Hop Sing
Tong gathered in his room and talked
over assaults and murders. Seid Wah
Bing was her friend and sweeaheart.
He aimed to get her away from her
life of slavery. Members of the Hop
Sing Tong learned of his attentions
and finally decided he must die. She
warned Seid, but he laughed and said
he was not afraid.
On the night of the murder Wong
and Loo Soon attacked him with a
razor, a hatchet, a knife and a club

and after cutting him to pieces placed
the dismembered body in Oi Sen's
trunk and compelled her to check the
remains to Seattle, Wash., after being
an eye witness to the crime.
For several days Oi Sen remained
in hiding with Wong Si Sam. When
the trunk was found with her name
upon it she was ordered to Canada.
At Billings, Mont., she was ordered
placed under arrest and taken back
to Portland. At first she refused to
make a statement. Then she tried
to commit suicide, stating she had
been warned that if she testified in
court she would be tortured and slain.
Later she wa3 told that the crime
would be fixed upon her if she did
not tell all she knew.
The authorities believe that Oi
Sen's testimony will send the Soon
brothers to their death. It is prob
able the authorities will use her to
identify other highbinders in Port
land. Speck of Dust in Court.
