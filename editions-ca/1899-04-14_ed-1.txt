on theIndustry bound for Havana Mr Tymthe supercargo descries a sail The strangevessel gives chase but is disabled by theIndustrys guns In the fray one of thecrew is killed and Houthwick is seen tofall The captain is found to be dead butthe Industry is litttle damaged Selllngerfirst mate takes charge and puts into Sidmouth to secure a new mate Several dayslater when well out to sea an Englishmerchantman is met whose captain has aletter addressed to Jeremiah Hope atHavana The crew of the vessel tellstrange tales of the buccaneer Morganwho is sailing under the kings commission to take Panama One night a littlelater the English vessel having proceededon her course a bit of paper Is slipped intoArdicks hand by one of the sailorsCHAPTER VOF A VERY STIRRING PIECE OF BUSINESSI was eager and I might say anxiousto know what the slip of paper contained and determined to examine itwithout delay I would not take it tothe bittacle for there the helmsmanmight see me and yet I was for making use of the bittacle lanthorn Iascended the poop ladder turning overa little plot in my mind and when Iwas nearly up with the bittacle boxI stopped and uttered a sharp exciaxuationiPshViiing I growled Curseslight on the villainous tailor that mustleave a pocket as open as a chimneyI must have a fling of your lanthornI took it out of the box without waiting for his consent and whisked itaround to the hither side The fellowdare not leave his tiller even had hesufficient interest or curiosity to doso and for the instant I was safe Iheld the paper low that none forwardcould make me out and on spreadingit open discovered that it bore a fewlines of most villainous ugly writingThey had the seeming indeed of having been traced with a bit of charcoalor the point of a charred stick Ibrought all my clerkly powers to bearind in quicker time than I could havethought possible finally decipheredthe words Luckily they were few innumber Men be going to mutinizeso the missive ran Tower daysThe mate bee is the leeder I amwatchedIt seemed to me at that moment thatthe fellow at the wheel must haveheard the throb my heart gave Iiooked at him as I straightened upat his black outlines as he bowed overthe tiller tackle and hungfnr the moment all in the windI left him and walked leisurely to thehead of the ladder whence with acareless air I surveyed the deck Bythe faint light of the stars I couldmake out the dim shapes of two of themen and a red spark by the foot of themainmast where a third was at themoment starting his pipe None werevery near which was the thing I wouldknow The foot of the poop must liewell in shadow so that one slippingup to the companion and slyly opening it would run but small risk of bejrg seen I was heavy and heartsoreunder the sudden smiting of this business and could not yet persuade myself that it was all true or bring myself into the heart of it to appreciate itI threw one swift glance around andsaw no one apparently looking Thetwo nearest men had swung about andwere facing aft and the smoker hadhitched partially around giving methe square of his shoulder Now wasmy opportunity I darted in closingthe door after me A glance showedthat a lighted lanthorn hung againstthe mast but the berth was empty Istopped for nothing further butlong and softly toward the captains cabin This was the first counting from the starboard side of thetiree after rooms the next being occupied by the mate and the third bytfce supercargo I skirted the tablea nd reached the door and put out myhand to rap gently upon it While yetmy knuckles were presented the dooriiirthest on my right that is to saytbe supercargos abruptly openedand Mr Tym himsei put out his headI fell back a step not being prepared for this interruption and erecould speak or utter a caution hestrode out and hailed me sharplyStand What do you seekHist hist I said in a sharp whisTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY FRIDAY APRIL 14 1899per A word with you if you willbut no noiseBy this time he recognized me whichnow I saw that he had not at first andhe fell back without a word and motioned for me to enter I whipped inwith all speed and immediately thatI was past him he gently closed thedoorI immediately advanced my lips tohis ear and acquainted him in thefewest words possible with what wasdoing Speak sir I concluded for you know the matesberth adjoins thisHe took away his head and looked atme as one thunderstruck Instead ofanswering he plucked off his barnacles and put them in the case andwalked to the window I conceivedthat he might be collecting his witswhich must be a little shaken and thatwithout any impairment of his courage Clapping up his hand to guide thesound he said in my earWe will confound the arch villainStay but a moment till I can prepareand we will be about itMy own spirits and courage rose atthis and I stood up very sturdily as 1nodded assentHe thereupon softly advanced to thewall whence he took down his swordand buckled it on and from beneathhis bunk produced a box which provedto contain a brace ot pistols with powder and ballHe handed these weapons to me witha sign to load them and while I wasobeying him he took from a coveredsheif against the bulkhead a littleiron tool which at first I took to bea kind of awl and this he proceeded toscrew into the wooden cap of his armhaving first removed the iron hookI was now ready to hear him declarehis plan but he first took from a naila coil of small cord after which hewhispered in my earBefore aught else is done we mustsecure the mate That stands clear inmy mind And we may not wait tosummon the captain lest the fellowtake the alarm Mark me IavM knockon his door and say I desire to speakwith him On his appearance we willeach clap a pistol to his head takeyou this and compel him forth andbind himHe softly opened the door and westole out As I crossed the thresholdI heard a sharp sudden little knocking from somewhere in the shadow ofthe table It gave me a start and Iglanced that way only to discover thatwhich affected my nerves a vast dealmore A tall but stooped figure madea scramble from all fours to its feetand with one long straddling boundwas bursting out of the companionTradey veiled the supercargoand let fly with his pistolI could see that he was too late andthereupon with a shock of alarm andmortification I made a dash of it alsoand flew through the open door Themate was bounding off the quarterdeck to the main shouting out something which I did not catch and in averitable tuty I let go my pistol Icould not have made a close shot buthis yelling increased and now I couldsee the crew pouring out of the forecastle hatch and the watch runningtoward him I had the sense to perceive that all was up and sullenly retreated stopping at the companionto shoot the bolt of the doorWhen I tiirned aboxit though theplace was still a little smoky I madeout both the supercargo and the captain the latter in Ins shirt with adrawn sword in his handPray you dress said Mr Tym withexcellent coolness as the captain stoodfast glaring fiercely toward the companion Naj we are safe enough forthe moment he added glancing downat the door leading into the tweendecks which I now perceived he hadsecuredThe abominable villain growledSellinger relaxing his warlike attitudehowever and lowering his point Iwill take your advice and be with youpresentlyHe withdrew into his berth and MrTym said to me almost humorouslyAbominable or not he played ashrewd part and is like to reap thereward of it A very pretty piece ofeavesdropping indeedHow will it be with us now Iasked aloud Can we make a sufficient defense think youNay he answered coolly not ifthey stand to it with heart You conceive that they have in all points theadvantage They can starve us outfor we have nothing beyond a few biscuits and no drink but wine or canbatter in the doors and bear us downby main force or they can seta watchupon us and keep us boxed up here tillthey reach some convenient point whenthey can scuttle the ship and leave usin the plight of so many inconvenientkittensStay I cried as a sudden thoughtstruck me I think they will be atnone of that I mean the scuttlingRemember you not the magpie fromthe Happy Bess He that yarned soconcerning Morgan I am ready toswear that his talk and the matesscheming have brought this aboutThese rogues will be for turning piratesI had just uttered this when CaptSellinger came out of his cabin He wasfully dressed save for his coat andwas now armed with a brace of pistolsin addition to his swordI believe you have hit the nail onthe head cried the captain with asavage slap on the table Oh thatsnake Aye he is at the bottom of itThese simpletons would not have risenbut for him On my soul never wasa crew better treated Such pork andsuch beef and such soft tack on Sundays and then the scouse and the aleAh well it avails not talking of itWhat is your counsel Master TymWhat may we do in such a straitMy counsel is of the simplest answered Mr Tym without hesitationWe should stand clear of the doorslest they take it into their heads toshoot through and watch sharplypoint at which they might seekto catch us at advantageI think they are coming I saidas coolly as I could Secretly my heartbegan to thump Aye and anothergang advances tween decks I addedas I also heard a stir thereStand ready said the supercargoin low hard tones All together withthe pistols and then a rush Yet tarrytill the rams or what else they maybatter with have made a fair opening Master Ardick you have nosword therefore remain somewhatback Also I would counsel you towhip yon cloak about your left armthat it may serve in a sort as a shieldPistols forward friends They comeCHAPTER TTOF THE STAND THAT WE MADEAND DIVERS EVENTS THAT FOELOWEDI know not what manner of implements the fellow used but they werepassing effectual for both doorscrashed in at the first assault and wecaught sight of their pack of bodiesand bristle of weapons But an instant so and then we all let go in avolley making a tremendous noise inthe small place and confusing everything with smoke One fellow in theopening of a companion fetched adreadful howl as high pitched as adogs and before the sound was wellout of him thrust headlong forwardand crashed down at our feet Thegang in the door thereupon set up agreat roaring and cursing and in themidst of it four or five of them dashedrecklessly in The foremost bent forward and I saw his hand go out witha pistol in it but before he could firethe captain let bang at him and hefetched up short and gave a queer sortof writhing bow and fell back uponthe threshold The others hung in thewind a moment whereupon Capt Sellinger raised a great shout and setupon them with his sword I had amoment now to glance over my shoulder and perceived that Mr Tym washolding the others at bay they indeed crowding together cursing andstamping but not offering to advanceEncouraged at this and wishing to beperforming some part I caught up MrTyms cloak which I had before neglected wound it around my left armand having exchanged the pistol formy sheathknife advanced a pace andmade ready to fall on By this timethe light in the place was exceedingEe fetched up shortdim the smoke though in part drawing up through the companion continuing also about the lanthorn till ithad the seeming of a beacon in a fogNevertheless upon looking with someintentness I made out that the fellowsthe captain was fighting were three ofthe ordinary sailors bjr name TomDoll Will Minton and Jack Availing all men of fair courage but notextraordinarily able of body or ofknown skill with weaponsHave at one of these fellows sirI shouted to the captain and discreetly picking out Doll I made a bold dashand so dismayed the rascal that hefetched his blow at me before the timeand I closed with him ere he could gethis hanger up again and dug my knifeinto his side He collapsed like anempty sack uttering a direful groanand at the same moment the captainrun Minton throtigh the heart Walling who was an active fellow thereupon whirled short and with one flying bound cleared the door and landedwell out upon the deckThat gives us riddance of so manyof the rogues puffed the captainwhowas by this time very short of breathStay you here Ardick and guard thecompanion while I go to Tyms assistance By St Paul he has little needof it such poltroons as these fellowsbeMr Tym had now fallen back a pacefrom his first station for some of hisadversaries had obtained pistols andas we joined him they let go a sort ofscattering volley Their range waslimited on account of the walls of thestairs and no harm was done Therewas a bit of silence but not to mention and immediately the whole gangcame bursting up Then it was thatthe supercargo acquitted himself rarely Forward he darted and before thefirst fellow who happened to be PierreLovigne could order his guard thelittle lithe man stooped whipped inand passed his sword a foot throughi the burly rascals midriff Back twopaces then and as the next fellowpressed on the sword flew round andwith a sidelong stroke shore awaytwo or three of the rascals fingers Itwas all while I seemed to be gettingone long breath and letting it outagainHave at ye scum yelled the captain fired at this feat of arms and hebrandished his sword and ran in uponthe now crowded and confused seamenMr Tym saw the opportunitj andsprang to his side and together theythrust and slashed so fiercely and yetwith such deadly skill that three moreof the saif6rs were either killed or destperateiy wounded and the otheribroke and poured headlong down thstepsThe captains blood was up and hmade to follow but Mr Tym caughlhim b3r the sleeve and in a word oitwo showed him the danger of it scthat he reluctantly gave overAll this time that arch traitor thmate had kept in the background butnow we heard his voice and I conjectured that he was rating and perhapstrying to rally his men It seemedthat he had been in the rear of thosewho came up from tween decks buteither from necessity or inclinationhad fallen back when Mr Tym and thej captain made their final onslaughtBut do what he could the fellows hewas talking to had no heart for further ventures and we heard thembreak away from him and retreat tcthe forward part of the ship He musthave followed for it was immediatelyquiet tween decks and so that pointof our defense seemed to be safeenough As for the companion it stillstood open just as they had broken itin but the misused door only bangedat will with the motion of the ship andno one appeared to be near it or toguard itWe were now minded to investigatethe condition of the fallen mutineersand found all dead Capt Sellinger wasfor bringing the affair to a head without further parley and would have ussally out and fall upon the fellows andcut them down if they would not surrender Mr Tym opposed this sayingwe were still three against eight notincluding the wounded sailor and oldLewson the latter would hardly desert to us as yet and in the open deckwe could not expect to work suchhavoc as we had in the cabin In the attack here they had fallenon uswithoutorder or precision crowding togethertill they could not get the avail oftheir weapons and missing their shotsbecause of their hastiness but on deckthey could spread out and encompassus front and rear and would be certain to be more circumspect But forthe surprise into which they hadbeen thrown by the sudden call of themate it was doubtful if we could havegained the day as it was Better towait then urged Mr Tym and letthe rascals call for a truce whichdoubtless they will soon do being nowa light crew for the ship and likewiselacking nautical instruments thosebeing all here in the cabinTO BE
