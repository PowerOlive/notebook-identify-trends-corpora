You are running a newsaperand I am running a magazine.If you were here, I would take youin and introduce you to Miss Gould,our Fashion Editor. I believe thatyou a man would be interested in herideas about women and fashions. Ifyou could hear her " talk about thesubject you 'would enjoy. If wecould be educated to look at fashionsthe way Miss Gould looks at them,we should have a better and happiercountry. She likes to have womendress fashionably, but she doesn'twant them to run-to extremes. Shebelieves in the well-dressed woman,not the dressed-up woman. She isagainst the eccentric, the immodest,the grotesque, the conspicious. Shesays :"Fools dress so that people willturn around and stare at them. Iwant women to dress so that peopleiVill not stare at them. I want themto look well be comfortable, feel fashionable, and yet accomplishing all thisat a reasonable expenditure of money.I am showing our women how theycan do this very thing."Now, Miss Gould has got up an. Advance Autumn Fashion Number of theWoman's Home Companion, which you! and whatever women folks you are interested in, ought to see. Under separate cover I am sending you a copytogether with a copy of our Editor'sClip Sheet, which, this month, is jmadeup largely of selections from MissGould's department. Look over thismaterial and you will get a new andrefreshing view of just the place thatfashions ought to have. You will realize that women Miss Gould is showing to so wisely are not away off insome imaginary field, far from everyday life.
