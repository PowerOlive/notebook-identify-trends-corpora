WITH AGNES AYERS, MILTON SILLS, AND CAST OF ALL STARS
Marriage is like a furnace. When two people marry without love, then life becomes a furnace. Instead of a sacrament, it
becomes a sacrilege or a sacrifice. Jealousy, thatred, revenge feed its flame's until it either destroys or purifies.
The great William D. Taylor production of "The Furnace" is one of the most tremendous presentations of this question yet
conceived on the screen. You will be profoundly moved by the struggle of the people in "The Furnace" for happiness and love.
Here is a picture which for drama, power, and dazzling scenic effects, has never been surpassed. Don't miss it.

Clustered about Hie flowers that
covered her last resting place, ming
ling with the silence that shrouds
the revered spot, and quivering
amidst the gloom of the grave, the
holiest memories speak in tones that
fill the ear and thrill the sorrowing
heart. All that there was of life,
ihat has faded into the night of end
less sleep; its lights and its shad
ows; its sweetness and ts nobility;
its power and its purity, pass before
us like a rapidly moving panorama.
Under such an influence we pause to
consider the loss to those who loved
her and the loss to the community:
"All who ere living, soon or late,
Must pass within the Garden gate;
"Muse kneel alone in darkness there
And battle with so.me fierce despair.
God pity those who cannot say,
'Not mine, but thine, who only pray
'Let this cup pass,' and cannot see
The purpose in Gethsemane."
