MELLERSBURG
Mrs. H. D. Jones is also improv
ing. Mrs. W. G.'Dailey is improving
nicely.
Mr. S. C. Bascom and Dr. J. D.
Calhoun were in Cincinnati on bus-J
mess Monday.
T. P. Wadell and E. Martin have
returned from a two-weeks' fiishing
trip in Estill county.
- Mr. G. S. Allen and sisters, Mrs.
Frankie Cook and Mrs. Jane Neal,
Ij&ve returned from a visit to rela
tives in Winchester.
Mr. J. C. Head', of Lawrenceburg,
was here on business Tuesday. It
will be remembered that Mr. Head
'was formerly manager of the Bour
bon. Telephone Co.
J. . Steager, of Winchester,
was arrested here by City Marshal
liinville on a charge of violating the
speed laws. He was taken before
Judge Stewart, where he pleaded
guilty and was fined $10 and costs.
Witnesses testified that the car was
going at the rate of fifty miles ai
3iour. On reaching the curve in the
pike at the end of Main street the
machine ran into the house of Nellie
Henderson, colored, who appeared
against Staeger and claimed $50 dam
ages. Other occupants of the car were
a Mr. Haggard, of Winchester, and
two young women from Paris, whose
names could not be learned.
The Spanish influenza is on the
increase here, and unless some steps
are taken by the Board of Health to
check the progress it will soon in
vade every family in town and com-'
munity. It's progress here has not
been rapid, but it is evidently grow
ing worse. Steps should be taken to
.see that all homes are placarded and
v&ll inmates kept In where the disease
is known to exist. Loafers should not
be allowed Ground the stores and
other places of business. People
should purchase what they need and
;then. leave the business house. All
persons should be kept away from the
depot: except the traveling public and
thqse who must necessarily be there
in some business capacity. You are
Hat only endangering yourself, but
perhaps those whom you come in con
tact. One family makes it a business
to', loaf at the depot every evening,
when it is positively known that they
nave no business there except to soak
nip the L. & N. heat and watch the
train come in.
In other places groups of men and
vomen are not allowed on the streets.
This should be done here, and
not more than two or three should
for. the- past three yers,fcand has re
alized during all that time xthat the.
end could. not be far distant. ,Aoout
two weeks a.ea Tie received a Tartial
stroke -of ''paralysis in his right side,"
from that time until the end ne con
tinue to grov worse.
Dvt Miller was one of the most
prominent, asKwell as one of the most
philanthropic, citizens ofTVIillersburg.
He-was a son' of Mr. and Mrs. James
Miller, and was one of a family of
nine children. ' In his early life he
was traveling salesman for a well7
known Cincinnati drug house. Later
he onened a drus: store m the room
occupied by the Millersburg hardware
store, then the property of the late
Mr. G. W. Bryan.
After the fire of 1884 he erected a
VmilriiTif on n lot ripnt1v t nrp.hasp.fi
from Mrs. Adella Miller, now of At
lanta. Ga.. and moved his drug store
to this property, which he occupied
until the early nineties, selling tne
same to Mr. H. M. Phillips, now of
Winchester. He did not enter Jthe"
practice of medicine as early as "many
of his profession, but was a successful
physician, with a lucrative practice,
as long as he continued as apractic
ing physician. For a numbervof years
nis oflice was at the drug store.
Later he built an office, after which
he formed a partnership with Dr. C.
B. Smith, they continuing together
for a, number of years, Dr. Miller
then retiring from active business
life. In 1906 he organized the Ex
change Bank, being one of the larg
est stockholders, and from the time
the bank was, installed until his
health began to fail he was president
of the institution. He has been a
member of Amity Lodge No. 40, F.
and A. M., since' young manhood, and
has gone through all the chairs of
the lodge. For many years he was
Senior Deacon under the late and be
loved Hiram Basset, they conferring
many degrees in the lodge of all the
surrounding counties.
He was a life-long member of the
Methodist church, and was active in
church work, as in all of his under
takings. Since young manhood he has
been an officer in the church and was
member of the official board at the
time of his death. It was largely
through his effort that the present
handsome Methodist church was
erected. And it was one of the
prides of his life. He was one of the
most public spirited men who ever
lived in Millersburg, always willing
and ready, often times taking the
lead, to co-operate in everything that
was for the good of his town, county
or State. He was twice united in
marriage, early in life to Miss Mattie
Hutchcraft. Their lives were beauti
ful and harmonious. No couple ever
lived that was more highly esteemed
in their community. Mrs. Miller died
in 1903. Dr. Miller was afterward
be -seen together at any time. The
disease can be stamped out here, as
" ""iS.rSS lrIr " united in marriage to Miss Allie
nelTa cmnlluee on onCe to J do their i Har, and by this union his life was
part. Members of families are allow- (brightened to the fullest extent by

CHARLES W, GDLKEY
When a good citizen, -an excellent'
neighbor and a public-spirited, patri
otic man, dies, his memorV and
worth should receive at least a pass
ing tribute. In the person of Mr,
Charles W. Gilkey, who " laid down
life's burden at the good bid age of
seventy-eight, the community of
North Middletown, where most of his
life was spent, lost a splendid and
honorable citizen.
Although born in Montgomery
county, his active, long and useful
life was spent in this community, In
October, 1866, he was married to Miss
Mary Aronld, a most worthy help
mate. She survives him in serene
and kindly old age, a true "Mother
in Israel," a most hospitable and gen
erous friend and neighbor, "ambi
tious only of good deeds.' Besides
his wife three sens survive Mr. Gil
key Dr. J. A. Gilkey, the able and
well-known physician of Paris; Robt.
M. Gilkey, the capable and popular
Sheriff of Bourbon county, and Ash
ton Gilkey, a prominent farmer of
the North Middletown vicinity.
Mr. Gilkey and his devoted wife
both lived to see these sons reared to
manhood, and to assume honorable
and respected places in society. In
this there was much to give them joy,
for their home in North Middletown
was ever open with genial hospitality
to their many friends and acquain
tances. Mr. Gilkey took deep interest
in the many public questions of the
day, and was ever ready to champion
and defend what he deemed was
right. Bue he is gone. The commu
nity will miss his cheery companion
ship. And above all, to his devoted
wife, who journeyed for more than
half a centry by his side, who was,
indeed, wife, companion, guidexand
helpmate, to her the bereavement is,
indeed, irreparable.
To her and to her sons the deepest
sympathy of this entire neighborhood)
goes out, in this sad hour of their
unspeakable sorrow. "One by one the
lights go out, one by one our friends
depart," yet He who is the Resurrec
tion and the- Life has promised that
the darkest hours in this vale of
tears are but the postals to an eter
nity of bliss, and that our friends
"who have gone away" shall greet
us again with "Happy Good Morn"
ing" in the realms of that "Beautiful
Isle of Somewhere."

LATONIA PACES POSTPONED
ACCOUNT OF EPIDEMIC,
ON
: -
i " inniiiinntfmmit
Followers of the racing game were
again disappointed regarding the
opening of Latonia races when an
nouncement was made yesterday by
Manager John Hachmeister that" the
"opening had been indefinitely post
poned. A conference of the members
of the State Board of Health was held
at Louisville and again at Frankfort,
when an. order was issued prohibiting
the opening of Tthe track on account
of the influenza epidemic Manager
Hachmeister announced that he was
unable to announce "a, date for the
opening. He, added, however) that
the racing public may depend, upon,
th next announced -date for the
opening! as he does not intend to
take, any, more chance of disappoints
It is passing strange that anyone
at all cognizant of Governor Start
ley's record could for an instant ac
cuse him of unfriendliness to labor.
He has in all his acts and utterances
shown his sympathy for the' men who
wear the overalls and earn their liv
ing by the sweat of their brows. The
contract between , the Lexington
street tJar 'company and its men pro
vides -that whenever there is a disa
greement which, the representatives
of the company and the men can not
adjust, the Governor will be called
on to name an arbitrator. Such a
situation occurred recently in that
city and the Governor named Hon.
C. U. McElroy.'of Bowling Green, as
arbitrator. The Republicans immedi
ately opened up their propaganda and
made the men dissatisfied because, a&
they alleged, the appointee is a first
cousin of the company's chief counsel.
The men therefore, declined to ac
cept McElroy and appealed for a
government arbitrator. It' was agreed
to and the differences settled. Now,
Mr. H. 'L. Thomasv acting secretary
of Amalgamated Association Street
and Electric Railway of Kentucky,
finds on investigation, which might
have been made at first, that there is
no relationship between the men
named, except the only basis of the
foolish statement being that the at
torney's wfe is distantly related to
McEroy's step father. He has accord
ingly made due apology to Gov. Stan
ley and says that not only he but men
and organized labor generally will
give the governor hearty support.
Thus falls another effort of the in
terested to discredit the man who is
labor's heartiest champion. As Con
gressman and7 as Governor, Stanley
has accomplished much for the work
ingman and all intelligent laborers
will show their appreciation by their
votes for him for United States Sen
ator. tel 15S IBB'

Extracts From Gov. Stanley's
Speeches.
. On March 1619,18, Governor Stanley
made a speech in Cincinnati, Ohio. The
Cincinnati Enquirer, a Democratic news
paper, in its issue of March 17, 1918, re
ports his speech as follows:
He also sailed into the Prohibi
tionists by declaring there is little
use of our boys laying down their
- lives for liberty in France "if a lot
of fanatics and cranks" are allowed
to deprive Americans of liberty at
home. "These fanatics are worse
tyrants than the Kaiser, and are"
bigger fools," was1 his parting shot.
This was quoted in an ' editorial in the
Lexington Herald, also a Democratic news
paper, in its issue of date March JL 9, 1918,
and that paper made this comment:
Would it not be better for the
Governor of Kentucky, in whom, is
invested the supreme executive
power of the State, to exert himself
to provide a force to preserve peace
in Kentucky, than to be "over
there" across the Ohio declaim
ing about "pellets of lead from flam
ing rifles" and denouncing Prohi
bitionists as "worse tyrants than the
Kaiser and bigger fools?"
