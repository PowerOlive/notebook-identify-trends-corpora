Clothierarid FurnishersForrest Lawrence, charged with killing George Thomas in the saloon ofMike Woods on last Saturday night,was held to the grand jury at his examining trial held before Judge Dundon yesterday morning. A number ofwitnesses were introduced at the rrialand the evidence given was practicallythe same as that brought out in theinvestigation conducted by CoronerRudolph Davis Monday morning.Lawrence was represented by Attorneys G. A. McMillan and Vm. B.tArdrey, while County Attorney George; Batterton conducted the prosecution.The revolver which was taken fromtne r.egro alter he naa been shot was' brought into court and identified bythe witnesses as the one he had removjed alter the shouting.A. K. McKennev, the bartender whowitnessed tbe shooting, was the first. Commonwealth witness placed on the, btand. He told in detail of the incidents that occurred prior to the shooting or tne negro by Lawrence. liesaid the first intimation he had thati there was any trouble was wheni Thomas came to him, telling him thatt the white man was trying to maketrouble, and asked what was best forhim to do. According to the witness,he was advised to' leave by one of therear doors and was in the act of doingso when Lawrnece fired upon him.Dr. William Kenney, one of th attending physicians, was placed on the'stand and stated the nature of thewound which caused the death ofThomas. He said he saw the revolverin the hands of McKenney which hewas told had been taken from thenegro after he had been shot. He alsosaid a number of cartridges were foundon the pool table where Thomas wasIving and which it wa said had fallenfrom his pocket.Both Mike and Kirby Woods testified practically the same as beforethe coroner's jury. The former didnot see the nrst shot fired and saidthere was no weapon in the hand ofThomas when he fell to the floor alterbeing wounded. The latter told ofbeing engaged behind the bar whenthe trouble took place and saw neitherof the shots fireo. He said there wasno weapon ol any sort visible, butwhile Thomas was lying on the floorhe took from under his coat a large45 calibre Colts' revolver, the cylinderuf which was loaded with cartridges.One of the cartridges he said showedmarks but said he could not tell whether or not a trigger had been snappedupon it. He said he did not see eitherof the men enter the saloon and had norecollection of serving either withdrinks.Walter Gray, who was in the poolroom when the shooting occurred, saidhe did not see either of the Bhots firednor Thomas fall. Had not seen ertherof the men during the eveninc and hadno knowlede of who did the shootincuntil he saw Abe McKenney si applewith Lawrence and wrench the piatolfiom his hand. Sam Biddle. a coloredboy, was in the saloon at the time oithe shooting with a lunch ran andgave a description of where the negrowas standing and how he tell after being wounded. Ho heard no lemarkspass between Lawrence and the negro.After the Commonwealth closed thecase Judge Denis Dundon recucnizedall of the witnesses in the sum of S100for their appearance before the Bourbon county grand jury which conveneson March 10 and ordered the deiendantommitted to jail without bond.A Handsome Likeness.Dr. M.

Glasscocksaid :"I deem this an opportune time tocall your attention to the undevelopedwater power of West Virginia and thepossibilities in this direction for revenue and for the establishment withinour borders of great manufacturingplants. When we think of such riversaa the New, the two Kanawhas, Potomac, Cheat, Greenbrier, Monongahela, Elk, Gauley and Tug, the watersfrom some of which come down froman altitude of three or four thousandfeet, it is easv to understand thatthese rivers are capable of producingelectric energy by the cheapest of allforces and make these streams asource of inestimable wealth to ourpeople."This advice is applicable to Kentucky. No state in the Union, perhaps isbetter supplied with waterways, and in these waterways are tremendous possibilities of water powerdevelopment. The utilization uf thi3power would mean enormous industrialexpansions and activity. It stands toreason that the opportunities that areoffered in Kentuky will not always beneglected. When the time eomes thatour water power is in demand theState should be in position to profitbv it.The Hodgkins --heirs, of Clarkcounty, sold a farm of 112J acres ofland toJohn Greening at $100 per acre.The land is situated on Muddy" Creek.The stockholders of the PerrvviileFair Association met last week, reorganized and selected officers for theensuing year.

There's no use in deny- :ing the fact that young lovers of New ,York City have a pretty hard time ingetting away with it. Anyhow, tender-heartedMiss Gordenia Winthropof Washington, after five years oflorgnetted investigation of some ofthe rather distressing social conditions of the town, says it is so. Forthwith she decided something reallyought to be done hence a rather interesting announcement from MissWinthrop. ,But before launching into Miss Winthrop's solution, let's see just what isthis problem of the young lovers ofNew York. The answer is: "Whereare they going to do their courting?"Or, rather, that leads up to the answer, and in the meantime proposes afew questions.With a few million people trying tooccupy the narrow confines of Manhattan Island, it goes without furtherelaboration that 'every family cannotplace at the disposal of Sal and Janea parlor each for the entertainment oftheir young man friends over an evening's call. Moreover, a large percentage of "the other half" in New YorkCity cannot afford a single parlor fprthe -whole family.So when Freddie makes a datewith Sal, Sal must make answer toFreddie something to this effect: "Allright, Freddie; meetcha at the cornerof Hundred and Twenty-fifth andEighth." Freddie arrives duly, wewill say; likewise Sal. Presently thepopular street corner under the glaring arc lamps and intfull sight of thepassing throng becomes as inviting fora continuance of the tryst as Broadway for a rest cure.There's little in the way of a choicefor Freddie and Sal. They might walka while, yes; but more than love'syoung dream is necessary to make alovers' lane out of a New York street.There's the Cafe de Something aroundthe corner. The lights are dim there;nobody is his brother's keeper acrossthat threshold. So we can't approveof Sal and Freddie going there.They have another choice, and onlyabout one more. It's the noisy dancehall down the avenue. The brassymusic mimics sadly the sighing of theevening's breeze of the country lane,which is nature's own trysting placefor the village lad and lass; the thick,smoky atmosphere of the dance hallis a poor substitute, surely, for theopen sky that falls to the lot of young 1lovers away from a great city's congestion. No; the dance hall will notdo.For the solution of the problem ofthe courting couples of New York wemay turn gladly to Miss Winthrop'sannouncement. The fair philanthropist has viewed the problem viewedfrom afar, perhaps, but still closeenough to see the temptations whichmock the lot of the young lovers ofthe city; to see that love's youngdream unfolding in a dance hall orcafe may result in something verydifferent from a storybook ending;to see, finally, that the city is sadlydeficient in proper courting places forthe young whose homes offer no suchaccommodations. "Miss Winthrop's proposition is this:She will establish at her own expenseof $15,000 a house, convenientlylocated for the Working class, wherethe young people may meet underthe supervision of experienced chaperons. -"I have been over every section ofthis country studying its social evils,"Miss Winthrop said, "and I think Ihave found now what will be a greatremedy for the young in this greatcity."MOBILESSupplies of All Kinds, Repairing, Etc.AUTO.SSourbon Sararge $f Supply Co.I C.I"RD.C.

No one who hasnot used natural gas for heating andlighting a home cannot estimate itscheapness or appreciate its advantageas to cleanliness. The introduction ofnatural gas in Paris means' the savingannually of thousands of dollars, infact, in every homp where it raav beinstalled, the saving annually betweenit and the cost of coal for heat andelectricity for light, will be sufficientto pay city, county and state taxes onthahome. 'Ihis is no g6ess work.The hrst year the saving will meetthe cost incurred in equipping- thehome with natural gas heaters and agas cooking range. The small heaterscost from 3 to 36 each and a good sixcap gas range with bake oven and hotwater attachment for bath service canbe installed for from S5 to SxOO.In order to show exactly the cost ofnatural eras for heating and li&htinei purposes I am herewith appending thegas bills of a neighbor lor the sevenmonths beginning July 1, 1912, andending January 31, 1913.I take this illustration for the reasonthat during 1st July and August theamount of ges used was for the family only. Commencing with September, the family took six students fromKentucky State University for roomand board and eight additional studentsfor table board. This made an increase of three rooms for heat andight, and students generally engage instuny until near midnight. It increased the number for table boardfrom seven to twenty-one besides thecook and waitress, making a family oftwenty-three to cook for. Thirteenpereons used the bath service fromtwice to three times per week, whichrequired an almost constant supply ofhot water.Some light washing and ironing wasalso done twice each week.The gas bills for the entire household, seven rooms equipped with gasbeaters and which were used more orless throughout each dav and night forheat and light, and as I have abovestated, cooking, washing, ironing andbath service and here is what itjuiy anu August ior private lamilvthe bills were, July, S2.10, and August, S2.25. For September S4.20, October, $4.80, November, S8.10, December, S9.90, and January. 1913, $9.80.It will be seen that the January bill,,notwithstanding for that month therate per 1,000 cubic feet of gas increased from 30 to 35 cents, due to thecompany connecting its mains with theWest Virginia gas fields, was lessthan for December. January was avery mild month, hence the reductionunder those circumstances. The entirecost for heat and light j for the sevenmonths is therefore seen to be $41.Had the family not taken in the sixroomers and the fourteen boarders, itmight be reasonably expected thatthe entirejeost for the seven monthswould -have been greatly reduced.But the cheapness ot gas is not theonly thing that recommends it tothe favorable consideration of thegreat majority of households. Byuaing natural gas you do away withcoal and kindling, ashes, soot andsmoke. With natural gas Lall that isneeded to make a fire is a match andthe gas can be turned (on and lightedin less than a minute. The use ofnatural gas appeals strongly both tohushand andwife, in that the formerwho usually defrays the bills has lessmoney to pay out and she who ischarged with the care and comfoit otme nome is always aengntea dv reason of its cleanliness. No coal tocarrv in and no ashes to carry out.No stove pipes to take down and nowalls blackenei with soot and smokeThose wno will oppose the introduction of natural gas will use the old exdoded arguments, that it emits fumeswhich are dangerous to health, is liable to explode and tear up everythingincluding limb, body and life and thatby reason of it being a moisture absorbent will greatly damage the furniture of the house.I moved to Lexington in August,1910, and at once installed naturalgas. We were told the same dire storyand had all of the gas heaters connected with two inch pipes as a conductor the fumes to escape. This causedan additional expense of about 535.Since then we have dismantled thepipes and have experienced no badeirects, in iact tne cnange was nevernoticeable. We have noticedno damage to furniture, because the heat Jssteady indregular, like Ithat from aradiator connected with a furnace,and a gas heater can be placed withina loot oi any piece or furniture without doing if damage.During cold weather the windows inthe house will sweat and frosi morefreely than from a coal fire and thisis practically the only objection thatcan$be argued against the use of natural gas. Of course every one herewho uses natural gas keens at leastone giate or stove connection in thehouse ior the use of coal in theeentof an accident to the gas mains, likethat which happened during the coldmonth of January of last year. Thedamage was repaired in less thanforty-eight hours and nothing has occurred since to diminish the pressureor flow of gas.Although living in Lexington as amatter;of convenience in the handlingof my work 1 have lost none of the interest 1 always entertained for my oldJ i,niitEqual Rights Association forParis."Captain Jasper" as presented bythe Black Patti Mueical Company; atthe Paris Grand on Tuesday, February18, for night.

HI -Kt MOt - - .Franchise.The Cily Council at" its meeting lastnight passed upon the franchise thatwas offered several weeks ago, admitting natural gas to this city, afterMayor Hinton and City Attorney C. A.McMillan had been instructed to act i:conjunction with the Light Committeeof the Council to go over the franchise,make such changes as would safeguardlocal interests and advertise for bidsupon the franchise.The action of the Council followedan unusual session tand the franchisewas freely discussed. Col. Stuart, ofWinchester, who as a representativeof the Central Kentucky Natural GasCo., presented the franchise to theCouncil, was present, the object of hisvisit being to confer with the members of the Board in rpgard to the objections that hudjbeen marie to l.it andwhichjresulted in its rejection at a recent meeting.Col. Stuart presented his claim tothe Board and after a prolonged discussion it was agreed that the section otthe franchise which contained theclause fixing the maximum rate wouldbe changed t" conform with the franchises now in effect in Winchester,Lexington and Mt. Sterling, and thatthe rate in Paris at all times should bethe same in force and effect in thosecities.Col. Stuart said the purpose of thatsection was to equalize the rate forgas and readily agreed to the changesto meet the demands of the Council.He said his company, if it purchasedthe franchise, would act in good faithwith the people of Paris and would begin work within four months and complete the laying of the pipe lines tothis citywitliin six months as providedby the franchise, andexpend a sum oE$150,000 in the construction work.Hon. Claude M. Thomas, representing the Paris Gas and Electric Co.,addressed the Council in an efiort tohave it refuse to grant the franchise,stating the company which Had submitted the propositionghad no intention ofbringing natural gas here. He intimated that there bad been an effort ofcertain capitalists'to buy the local gasand electric company and after theirfailure to do so, had adopted this planto force a sale ot the plants and equipment while pretending to be in goodfaith in regard to bringing natural gasto Paris. He appealed to the Councilto consider local interests before goingtoo deep into the affair, and from thefact thai the prospective purchasersof the franchise had shown no consideration for the local interests and hadntimated that they would not purchase the property of the local plant inevent thpy should pipe gas to this city.Col. Stuart assured Mr. Thomas andthe members of the Council that inevent his company came into possession of the franchise, the companywould agree to purchase all the mainsin the city that were suitable for thepurpose.The members of the Light Committee, Mayor Hinton and Attorney McMillan will meet.in in few days andtake the matter up, and it is probablebids will be advertised for at an earlydate.$ Inspector of Weights and Measures,M.

Liquor Bill Passes Senate. ,The Senate Mynday night by aviva voce vote passed the Webb Liquor Bill, already passed by the Houseas a substitute for the Kenyon-SheD-pardbill.The Wtbb bill would prohibit 'shipments of intoxicating liquors fromone State to another when intendedto be received or sold in violation ofthe law ot the state tu which theshipment is made.The House concurred in the Senatebill Tuesday, which differs from thebill pdbsed by the House only in number. A report that President Taftwill vetu the measure created a stirmong Democratic Senators and Congressmen. The friends of the measure are worried because thev fear that it will beimpossible to pass the bill over thePresident's veto. This means, ofcourse, that the question would berevived and injectad into the Wilsonadministration. It is believed thattwc thirds of the House would vote tooverride the President's veto of thismeasure, but there is small chancethat thelsentiment in the Senate isstrong enough to accomDlish this end.IE the President vetoes the bill itwill be on constitutional grounds. Heis said to share the views of those,including the Kentucky membeis,who took that position.In the Senate debate Senators Sutheiland and Eoot. both Rioted constitutional lawyers, took the same view inopposing the bill aa that of SenatorPaynter in his speech attacking thebill.The President is said to believe themeasuie unquestionably is unconstitutional, and that its passage by Congress simply shifts the burden ot responsibility for its final defeat fromthe shoulders of politicians in the Supreme Court.Ti.e substitution of the Webb bill forthe Kenyon-Sheppard bill came at theclose of urolonged debate, and was byviva voce vote, no recall being demanded. Patriotism.A quaint little incident is related bya French war correspondent, whichsheds light on the enthusiasm andnervousness with which the Greeksentered upon their war with Turkey,When the mobilization orders reachedthe little town of Chalkis, all ownersof horses and mules hastened to comply, but there were no soldiers to escort the animals to Athens, wherethey were urgently needed, the military being already on the frontier.Thereupon the mayor of Chalkis setan example, which was followed bytwo or three of the oldest lawyers,school teachers, doctors and hotelkeepers. All these notable andlearned men put their dignity on oneside, and turned themselves for thenonce into grooms and stable lads.After two days journeying theygravely marched in procession throughthe principal streets of Athens, leading their beasts, and nobody laughed,'Which, indeed, there was no reason todo.All the Difference.A tale is being told on a certain railroad division about one of its conductors that is, they tell it when he isn'taround something like this: At astation, which is a near-city one, ayoung lady got aboard the train, and,the car being crowded, sat with another lady earlier aboard. When the"con" came around she smiled andbowed, and he returned her greetingpolitely, but in a distant fashion. Asecond time Misg Young Lady triedthe gushing act with no luck. Thenshe complained to her seatmate. "Ican't imagine what's the matter withConductor Blank. We've always beensuch good friends, and today he hardly seems to know me!" "Perhaps it isbecause you are sitting with me ""saidI the other lady. "Oh. I hardlv thinkthat could make any difference," objected the flirtatious one. "I don'treally see how" "It might, easily, Ithink; you see, I'm his wife!"Hero In Humble Life.A pathetic case of a dying man'sforgetfulness of self occurred the oth-i er day at the village of Old Colwyn,North wales. A sewer was beingbuilt .when a portion of the trench collapsed. Two men were buried underthe earth. The surveying staff, fourdoctors, and seme others were quickly at work, and hearing the faint criesof the entombed men labored heroically to remove the heavy mass" of soilin time to save life. An elderly mannamed Lloyd was first pulled out,and between the gasps he was heardto say: "Never mind me, boy. Lookafter the other man." He died whilethe rescue work was still going on.After arduous labor the second man,Morris Edwards, was reached and taken to the hospital.Pertinent.It is the fashion in England to attach to houses names that in many instances are absurd or misleading as"Applecot," where the only trees arefirs; but, as this London Chroniclestory shows,, fitness and humor sometimes govern the choice. A retired Indian civil servant, on his return toEngland, yielded to e his wife's importunities, and said that she might havea new bouse. "But mind," he emphasized, "it must not cost above threethousand pounds." It cost double thatamount, as houses have a way of doing, and when it came time to namettie place, the owner had considerablefine masculine feeling to put into it;so, not wholly in memory of India, hecalled it: "Mysore Place."!

But. nevertheless,cooks cannot be had, even at the mostsatisfying salaries. As1 a matter offac conditions have never been suchas they are now and there is only onereason to assignfor it.Almost any day in the week it canbe found that cooks are wanted inhomes, and almost any dav the complaint is heard that "my cook hasleft." The fortunate persons whopossesses the employment of one skilled in the culinary art frequently wakein the morning to find the cook hasn'shown up, and the housewife musteither exercise her own cooking knowledge or do without breakfast.It has come to light that the reasonfor this is that a large number of colored women employed around thehomes in this city spend their nightsin drunken revelry instead of keepingthemselves in condition to attend totheir duties. A good "souse" invariably brines on that independent feeling and the result is when the timecomes to go to work, the employe assumes a "don't care" attitude aidquits the job.This is a matter which we wish tobring to the attention or the police.
