which resulted in what threatened to be
s complete wreck of an innocent young
3ife The most serious feature of being
afflicted with a blood disease is the fact
that innocent posterity must suffer The
aaan or woman with the slightest taint
5n the blood forces the undesirable leg
acy of impurity upon their children
-whose veins flow with the impure inher
itance which handicaps them in the race
f life
No child who has a trace of bad blood
can be healthy or strong and those pre
disposed to Scrofula are liable to a great
Ieal of sickness because their constitu
tions are weak and cannot withstand the
anany dangers which beset the path of
Medical statistics show that
amajorityof lung troubles result directly
from Scrofula so that a child afflicted
wiiu mis uiseiuc is iiKeiy to laii a
lim to dreaded consumption
Mr W A Clayton of Addie N C
1elieves SSS is the only blood remedy
which can have any effect whatever
npon obstinate caes He says
My three-year-old boy had the worst
case of Scrofula I ever heard of He
MR W A CLAYTON
was given many blood remedies without
relief and treated by the best doctors
He seemed to get worse all the while
iowever and the disease finally resulted
in curvature of the spine making him
utterly helpless
The bad sores on his neck increased
in size and were a source of constant
pain He was in this pitiful condition
for two years when some one recom
mended SSS stating that it had cured
some of the worst cases of blood diseases
As soon as his system was under the ef
iect of the medicine the sores began to
get better and in eight days were com
pletely healed Before long he could
walk on crutches and was improving
every day In three months he threw
aside his crutches for he had no further
use for them the dreadful disease had
been eliminated entirely from his sys
tem and he was restored to perfect
iealth The cure was a permanent one
as no sign of the disease has returned
for ten years
SSS is a real blood remedy and
promptly reaches all deep seated and
obstinate blood diseases it matters not
what other treatment has failed It is
lhe only remedy which acts on the cor
rect principle of forcing the disease from
the system and getting rid of it perma
nently

One Can Tell Whence He Came His

There are portions of the north of Ire
land where nature assumes a grand and
wild aspect On the coast of Antrim
larly abandoned profession could still
be felt by any one it might be in the
presence of the marvelous spectacle of
that sea whose waves never subside of
those grottos whose pillars and vaults
possess a power which the art of the
architect can never equal Nature her-
of strangers was a match to light the

THE OLD FLYBOOK
It Is Dearer to the Angrier ThanlAisy
Other Possession
Is there anything closer to an anglers
heart than his fiybook Iktfow of a case
where a burglar among other things
took a fiybook He was arrested and
speedily convioted and imprisoned He
cleared things out pretty well in the
house but the owner seemed to care for
nothing about the missing fur coats
sealskin sacks silverware and other
valuable Lares and Penates but he did
bftwail the loss of his book of flies The
there is no armistice in the furious bat- 0ther things he could buy again but to
tie that since the first ages of the get together such an assortment of valu
restrial globe was engaged between the able flies seemed to him an impossible
wavpsaud the rocks Columns of basalt thing He had been years collecting
like gigantic sentinels stand on guard them picking up odd
until for
to resist the invasion of the ocean and
the profound excavations made under
the granite rocks that protect this por
tion of the soil of La Verte Erin prove
that the waves must have frequently
made most vigorous onslaughts and only
retired after they had mined a land
which they could not conquer I
It is not difficult to imagine that this
maiestic and desolate site should have
ones Here and
there quality and variety
his book could not be excelled
It was a fly storehouse as it were
No matter where he intended fishing
or whether for trout bass or salmon he
could always find a choice assortment
to draw from with which to fill up a
supplementary book
Although it was some time ago he
yet bewails the loss of that fiybook
Many have been the efforts to get track
of it but all in vain He has gone to
seduced one of the vanquished ones m
AVTPT1RA nf RM1ainfi to the nn in
life one who had absolutely decided to
a distanfc cifcy a endeavoring to pre-
separate himself from the society of vail upon q COnvict to divulge the
man The real hermits are becoming hiding place of the book but without
more and more rare indeed it was be- success A persistent search of the
lieved that they had completely pawnshops and periodical advertising
peared but if a vocation for that have produced no better results
There were flies in that book for trout
and salmon in Irish waters flies for the
salmon and trout of the Scotch lakes
and the English streams and flies for
the salmon of Norway The favorites
from Maine to California and from one
end of Canada to another were collected
self seems to have created in those rocks iu that wallet anything and every-
a refuge for the shipwrecked for the
proscriLed and perhaps also for those
who despise the vanities of life
About ten years ago a mysterious in
dividual made his home in the grottoes
of the coast of Antrim The approach
of any human being seemed to inspire
him with an invincible repugnance As
soon as the cavern which he had select
ed for his refuge was discovered by the
fishermen of the neighborhood he imme
diately disappeared and took up his
quarters 20 or 30 kilometers farther on
in another retreat which appeared more
inaccessible For a few months his
domicile was in an old abandoned mine
the principal gallery of which advanced
under the ground to the distance of
about five kilometers but as the inhab
itants of the nearest village had long
before carried away the beams that sus
tained the vault to convert them into
firewood the hermit was obliged to quit
that dangerous refuge where he was
constantly exposed to the danger of be
ing buried alive So he installed himself
in a grotto the access to which was
more easily discovered but it was less
obscure less humid and less liable to
cave in There he flattered himself that
he would find at least some of the con
ditions of existence that belonged to the
men of the caverns But it was in vain
that he hoped to return to the life of
the first ages of prehistoric humanity
He- was obliged to pay tribute to the
exigencies of civilization and to mani
fest less repugnance for all contact with
his fellow beings
One day he found an empty barrel
that the tempest had tossed upon the
thing from the feather down midget
with cobweb gut to the lordly salmon
fly absolutely irresistible to the lurk
ing salmon deep down in the icy pools
of the Cascapedia
There were flies in that book on I
which famous bass trout and salmon
had been hooked each fly carrying with
it memories of battles fought from ca
noes among the rushing swirling wa
ters Forest and Stream
MOONSHINER IN REAL LIFE
Quite Different From His Confrere as
Seen on the Stage
The Kentucky moonshiner in real life
does not resemble his counterpart de
scribed in novels and impersonated on
the stage in the least He does not
wear top boots and a slouch hat As a
rule he is too poor to possess the former
and he is more apt to go barefoot or to
amble along in a pair of wornout bro
gans than to wear top boots His hat is
usually a torn straw Jimmy and his
-clothes are yellow and faded wii age
Eegularly on days when the grand jury
meets in Louisville a dozen or more of
the moonshiners are presented for in
dictment They present a woebegone
appearance as they pass along the streets
in charge of the marshal In their own
poor homes in the mountains they are
hospitable but of the stranger ever sus
picious The latter may make his bed
in the one room where the entire fami
ly sleeps but his request for a taste of
liquor brings forth a statement that
none is to be had this side of the
I store At the same time a still mav
shore and he could not resist the temp- i be in operation within ten feet of his
tation of bringing it home to serve as a whereabouts
bed Some indiscreet persons taking
advantage of his absence to visit his
apartments discovered that he had a
pot for cooking his food Where did
that cooking utensil come from Was it
also a piece of wreckage rolled up upon
the sand by the furious waves or was
it the last souvenir of civilized life car
ried away by the anchorite who while
endeavoring to return to the conditions
of existence that belonged to prehistoric
times could not abandon the habit of
cooking his food
That is a question which has never
been answered and it is also impossi
ble to find out where he gets the
toes upon which he lives Did they come
from the discreet charity of the poor
fishermen of the neighborhood who at
the proper time renewed his provisions
or in separating himself from the world
did he make arrangements for the trans
portation of his modest provisions That
is also a mystery which has never been
fathomed One point however is cer
tain and that is that the hermit deter
mined to livo upon potatoes alone One
day a sailor offered him half of his din
ner The hermit pretended to be glad to
accept the gift but he never touched
the food In the absence of the kind
hearted sailor he tossed it into the sea
Apparently he also vowed that he would
never enter a house and never touch a
piece of money He kept his resolutions
The store represents to the moun
taineer all civilization On winter
mornings he will tramp to it through
cold and snow to sell a few stiff rabbits
and swap yarns not overbrilliant One
of the mountaineers chief sources of
income is his honey and this finds
ready sale at the store The moon
shiner seldom receives money in pay for
his wares but is paid in a bit of bright
calico for his wife or a shoulder of ba
con If he can add to this a few pipe
fuls of tobacco he is well satisfied with
the results of his labors New York

What Typhoid Fever Costs
A correspondent of the Washington
Post gives the following appalling ty
phoid statistics Every year in the
United States 400000 people are sick
with typhoid fever Forty thousand of
them die They are sick 28 days on an
average out of every 3G5 days Thus
we have 11200000 days of sickness
from this disease
Every case of this sickness means one
month generally two mouths of idle
ness If the wages of the patient are
only 50 cents a day there is a loss of
15 a month Generally this sickness
means a loss of wages in two months
time of 60 or 80 The average loss of
wages for six weeks would be 50 Add
to this the doctors bill Tvhinh is
Nothing could ever induce him to cross where from 60 to 100 we will say
the threshold of any one of the little 6T Tf the patient lives in the city and
houses of the fishermen who began to has a trained nurse for only three weeks
have a sort of affection for him and there is another 45 Ten dollars for
never once was he known to beg The the prepared food ice milk etc
only liberality that he would accept and brings this moderate bill up to 165
solicited rrom tne munificence Multiolv this bv the number of people
sick and we can see every vear in the
