engineering-firm in Westminster was inlull swing at the Ifroad Street hoteland everything jvas gding as smoothlyas the organisers coiild have wishedTwo of the non professional performers who assisted at that entertainment were Jack Langley and ArthurMayhew langley was one of the mostpopular men in the office He had akind unselfish nature whichmade himlilved on all sides whilst whenever thefirm had any festivity in jrogress hecharmed everyone with his beautifulbaritone voice His popularity and hissinging made him hated by one manand that man was Arthur MayhewThe two young men occupied rathersubordinate positioiis in the officeLangley was one of the assistant bookkeepers whilst Mayhew who was twoyears his junior was in the correspondence department Mayhew hadalways been the acknowledged singerof the office until - Langley came andthen he had to take a back seat for heknew that the newcomer could givekim any amount of points at the singing business and beat him every timeThoroughty jealous by nature Mayhew conceived first of all a violent jealousy and later an intense hatred of hisrival and he resolved to do him an evilturn when the first opportunity cameLangley was in fine form to nightlie sang the song noted on the programme and at the end of it receivedan enthusiastic encore He sang againreceiving even a greater reception thanbefore and at the close the excited audience greedy for more called for himafresh The chairman Mr GeorgeCardew then -arose to his feet and announced that Mr Langley wouldThen the noisysettled down and waitedcalmly the next turnA little later in the evening Mayhew-came on He sang his best but his bestwas not to be compared with Langleysworst and though the indulgentapplauded him moderately helenew in his heart of hearts that he didnot deserve one round of axplause Andyet knowing this he hated the manwho was winning praise which wasthoroughly deservedAt length the end came as it comesto everything In the cloak room anoisjr band of riotous smokers demanded their hats and coots and Langleyfound himself beside MayhewHalloa Mayhew he said cheerilyCongratulate you my boy Your songtvent all right Im sureHe said this in all good nature for hefelt sorry for the other man andwished to comfort him as far as possible But Mayhew sick with jealousyand excited with the alcohol he hadbeejii drinking turned on him savagelyConfound you and your congratulations he said keep them to yourself Good nightTurning abruptly on his heel hemade his way out of the cloak roomleaving Langley aghast at his behaviorOld Mayhew must be a bit hurt andno mistake remarked a young f ellowwho stood close by fanc3r his goingon like thatPoov chap said Langley after allI dont wonder at his being upset Itsawfully discouraging when you feelthat you havent made a real successAnd all the way home he was thinking of Mayhew and saying to himselfPoor Mayhew poor old chapWhilst Mayhew as he walked homeward was saying I hate him I hatehim I hate himWhen two men are brouglit constantly together one of them desiring to injure the other an opportunity for doing-so invariably presents itself sooneror later In the case of Arthur Mayhow it arrived sooner than he expectedind it fell out in this wiseAbout two months after the concertrecorded at the beginning of this history the firm were much distressed tofind that some one in their employ wasrobbing them week after week Oneday postal orders would vanish thenjther valuables and so on Even personal property was appropriated andat length there came the day when MrCardew said that the scandal must go3n no longer He accordingly communicated with the police and a detective ofgreat experience was sent down to iitterview himowso that the news of the detectives advent should not become publicin the office Mr Cardew arranged forhisVisit to take place at seven oclockwhen everybody was supposed to havegone home And this indeed was thease all the staff having departed withthe exception of MayhewHe was just about to close his booksfor the night and put on his hat andtoat when the sound of voicesin the adjoining room which happened to beMr- Cardew s private office made himdraw- back and listen attentively Thepartition between the two walls was sothin that h was able to hear distinctlyevery word that passed between thepartner and the detectiveIt may be wondered why Mayhew desired to overhear the conversation Helid so simply because he made a practice of eavesdropping whenever he hada chance In days gone by he liacljicked up one or two valuable tipshe therefore listened now with all hisearsFirst of all said the detective Imtist ask you if everyone has left theoffice for the plan I am about to propose to you Mr Cardew is one whichxtfust never go b ey on d ourselves df it isto have any possible chance of successI believe everyone has gone homereturned the other but let us comeand make certainHearing- these words the ingeniousMayhew slipped behind the huge safein the corner of the room so that whenthe two ihen looked in they saw no onethereWere safe enough said the detective gruffly And now sir PJ1 detail toyou what I proposeGo on said Mr Cardew quietly Iam listening Whatever you proposein reason shall be carried out and Iam resolved to discover the culprit concerned in all fhesq disgraceful theftsevenfifij costsme 1000 to do itThe detective gave the partner asomewhat contemptuous look asthough he despised him for his displayof excitement Then he said veryslowly and deliberatelyWhat I propose is this sir 3SextSaturday morning ajf 31 oclock leaveon a conspicuous part of your desk intills room your purse Let it be wellfilled with gold not with -notes forthieves often figlit shy of notes for obvious reasons Notes have numbersand numbers are awkward things sometimes Let the gold therefore be theonly thing in the purse and leave itas 1 have said where everyone can seeit You might scatter one or two otherarticles of personal property such as ahandkerchief a cigar case etc on thedesk so as to give the business an unprearranged appearance Having- doneall this let it be known that you arecoimr out and will not be back for afew hours Come back at one and seeif the purse is still on the desk If itis not send downstairs for me and Ishall be in waiting at the door with acouple of plain clothes men Your nextaction will be to have every door inthe place locked and allow nobody toleave until he has been thoroughlysearched If you have a cloak room orhat room that must be searched alsoas it is quite as likely the thief would deposit the stolen property in his overcoat as anywhere elseMr Cardew rose and paced the roomexcitablyMy dear sir he said speaking in aquick nervous tone I really dontthink I could possibly sanction such acourse as that It is most un Englishmost arbitrary most humiliatingDoubtless it is returned the othercoolly but its about the only way Ican see of clearing up this businessIf youll allow me to make the remarksir I would remind you that just nowyou said you would give a thousandpounds to do soSo I would so I would but I cannothumiliate my assistants some of whomare old and trusted servantsThere Avill be no humiliation Youcan explain the circumstances and -Iam sure every sensible man jack ofthem will see that the course taken isthe only one under tne circumstancesBesides you can tone it down by announcing a holiday or something ofthat sort to make up for their temporary inconvenienceYes I might do that replied MrCardew musingly and after all asyou say when they realize the circumstances they cannot possibly take offense Well well and here he sighedslightly if you are convinced that thiscourse is for the best take it by allmeansVery good sir said the detectiveas he rose to take his leave On Saturday next then at one p m I shall beat the door If you want me you hadbetter let me know yourself as in casesof this kind third persons are alwaysdangerous Good night sirHe left the room quickly Mr Cardewaccompanying him to the door and letting himself out at the same timeThen Mayhew slowly took his wayhome thinking deeply all the timeHere was a chance at last a gloriouswonderful chance of getting his rivalJack Langley into disgrace It would beas easy as smoking a cigarette On Saturday he would find an excuse for entering the partners room and he wouldthen take thepursesecretingitinLangleys overcoat pocket downstairs in thecloakroom lie would have no difficulty in finding the coaf among thelarge number there for Langlej s pegwas No 66 just above his own whichwas 35Then there would follow the findingof the purse in his hated rivals pocketand then perhaps the police stationand the subsequent disgrace of a criminal trial Perhaps the firm would lethim off but at any rate he would bedismissed and his talents and popularity would rankle no more in the plotters heart Yes It couldbe done andby Jove it would be doneHe knew that young Langley hadlately been a little pressed for moneyand had obtained advances from thecashier This would malce his guilt allthe more palpable and it seemed to himas he thought over the foul plot thatfate itself was on his side aiding himand abetting him in the vile schemethat now was alrve in his subtle brainSaturday morning came in duecourse At 11 oclock Mr Cardew entered the large office where all theworkers were engaged and said to thecashier in a voice that all could hearIm going down to the works I shallbe back in an hour or soWithin 20 minutes of his departurelew cautiously approached hisroom and there sure enough on thepartners desk lay a small purse Hedid not stop to examine the contentsbut hastily putting it in his pocket herusTied downstairs into the cloakroomwhich fortuately

Massachusetts the office of statefiremarshal was established manyyears ago The year previous therewere only 17 convictions for incendiarism7 although the number of incendiaryfireswas 1170 In 1896 there were onlyC35 of such fires while the percentageof convictions to arrests was 86Though the rule is not universal itmaypae said generally that the fires olincendiary origin are more damagingthan those which arise from accidentor neglect The reason of this is to befound in the fact that incendiary firesare started usually atiight or in theearly-morning- when they have a chanceto spreadIt is

and I would not go back toit for 100 a day You have really no ideaof how it wears on a man Some stand itbetter than others but it wrecks everyones nerves sooner or laterWhen I was appointed night dispatcheron this road I thought I was the biggestman in Missouri I took to smoking 15cent cigars and wcayng 8 hats I had awell developed case of swelled head andshowed it all over me A few months exierienco with faithless operators trickytrainmen and arrogant superiors howevertook the conceit out of me and I began torealize just how big a job it was to handlea heavy train wire and give satisfactionThe fact is the man who can please allhands has yet to be born There are timeswhen some train must be delayed and itsoften a case of Hobsons choice The trainmen who wait curse the dispatcher intothemiddle of purgatory and back againand those who get advantage brag aboutthe run they madeOne night the road was fairly hot withtrains when I came on duty I wonderedhow in thunder I should ever get the passenger train through without delay Thereseemed to be a train on every side trackover the whole length of the road and morebetween stations I worked like a beaverIt was in the old days of what are knownas single orders when each train receiveda separate order which must be sent toeach one concerned singly You will easilysee how in the rush of business a singleorder might be incorrectly transmitted andtrains leave stations under conflicting orders which would certainly bring themtogether unless corrected Nowadays themost progressive roads all use orders sowordd that two trains or more receivethem at the same time and thus the riskof error is lessened That system washardly known in my time and we workedon the perilous single order planA double header left the foot of themountain auout midnight holding anorcLr giving it the right to Summit About35 minutes ahead of it was a fast freightThe latter had an engine numbered 427and the double train had engines 342 and327 You must remember I was workingevery minute trying to keep the freightsout of the way of the night passengertrainsAlong toward morning a train wasready to go down the mountain and 1gave it an order to run wild and wait forengine 427 at Summit In some way orother the double train following slippedmy memory completely I have thoughtsince I must have got mixed on the twonumbers 427 and 327 At any rate whenthe operator at Summit reported the twotrains leaving it came over me with thesuddenness and pain of a galvanic shockuhat I had given what we call a lap orderThe horrible feeling that seized me often makes me shudder when I think of itnow My nana ten rrom tne Key limpand nerveless Something seemed to casta blur before my eyes so I could not readthe orders before me The blood rushed tomy head and my temples beat like triphammers But only for a second Like aflash I seized the key and asked the operator to stop the down train It was toolate it had1 gone Then I tried to reachthe double train but it too had passedthe last telegraph office and I knew thatno earthly power could prevent those trainsfrom striking and striking hard for thegrade is nearly 20 feet to the mile up thereI sent for the chief dispatcher immediately and told him the situation He wasan old hand at the business and an affairof this kind fretted his nerves almost tothe point of insanity He added nearlyOOper cent to my agony of mind He wouldgit down and look the train sheet over andseem to devour the fatal orders with hiseyes then jump up with a gesture of despair and say By gosh thats too bad IThen he would pace up and down the floorrepeating to himself Thats too bad toobad theyll strike as sure as the worldreturning always to pore over the trainsheet and order book I could have screamedwith the awful strain of nervous suspenseI confidently believe that nothing but laclof courage and the curious fascination keptme from rushing out and jumping off thebridge into the river 75 feet belowI felt absolutelycertain that some ofthose men would be killed Had both trainsbeen single the drivers might possibly seeeach others headlights in time to jumpbut I was sure ihe men on the second engine of the double header would go intothe wreck all over and die as sure as fateIt has become fashionable nowadays to disbelieve in a physical hereafter I dontknow anything about that but I do knowthat if mental torture be the let cf thosewho sin in this life after err accounts areaudited I should prefer to take my chanceswith the old fashioned style of punishmentSuddenly both relays opened with asnap The chief looked at me with a perfectly indesoribable expression and went tothe switchboard without a word We bothknew without telling what it meant Thetrains had struck and the piled up wreckage had broken the wires down We testedfor the break and soon located it half wayup the mountain I gave up the last particle of hope at this and only waited in akind of dull wonder to learn the extent ofthe casualtyThe 35 or 40 minutes that elapsed afterthe wire failed until we got he official report of the accident seem to me now asmisty as a dream I worked away2at thewire imechanically guided only by theforce of habit using the circuits as theywere made up by the chief He kept fusslfg at the switchboard in a perfect misery3f nervousnessAt length the Summit operator calledand my heart beat almost audibly as I answered him for I knew from his tremulous sending that he had received the report I think he must have understoodmy feelings for the first words he telegraphed almost crazed me with gratitudeBefore sending a line of the formal reporthe told me Theres nobody hurt I gaveup right then and there and said Mr Hyoull have to take the rest of this reportI cant and got up and went homeIt seems the engineer saw the headlights and jumped and the men on thefirst engine of the double header aftersounding a sharp whistle for brakesBhrieked to the following crew to jump andkept on shrieking after they struck theground and until the engine passed themThe warning was heard in time and allhands got off with nothing worse than afew bruises but that finished my traindispatching ExchangeOrigin
