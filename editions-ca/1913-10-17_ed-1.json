Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad Com
pany, in favor of the estate of T. J.
Johns, a Louisville & Nashville fire
iman, killed in a head-on collision in
Shelby county January 16, 1912.
The regular L. & N. passenger
train on which Johns was firing was
running on its schedule and had the
right of way going from Frankfort to
Louisville. The Chesapeake & Ohio
train was running from Louisville to
Lexington "dead" carrying only its
crew. They collided and all the en
ginemen of the two. trains were
killed.
Reviewing the facts, the Court of
Appeals said the C. & O. train should
have taken a siding for the L. & N.
train, which it had three opportunities
to do between Anchorage and Shelby
viell. It ran for five minutes on the
L. & N. train's time and should -have
been on the siding at Eastwood when
the wreck occurred.
The suit was instituted against both
railroads, but was dismissed as to the
L. & N., after which the jury re
turned the verdict for $25,000 against
the C. & O.
The defendant company was rep
resented by Willis, Todd & Bond, of
Shelbyville, former Judge of the Court
of Appeals E. C. O'Rear and Judge
Ben Williams, of Frankfort, and at
torney Chas. R. 'McDowell, of Dan
ville, while the plaintiff, Mrs. Johns,
was represented in the Circuit Court
and in the Court of Appeals by the
law firm of Franklin & Talbott, of
Lexington and Paris.
FISH OF STONER CREEK ARE
BEING RUTHLESSLY KILLED.
tunately the low water this season has
worked quite a hardship, but an effort
is being made to protect the fish now
in the stream.
AH the land owners below the city
will be asked within the next few
days to have their lands posted to
keep off this class of fisherman, and
already a number have signified their
willingness to take the proper steps
to rid the stream of trespassers. In
addition a number ofthose who are
most interested will give all the assis
tance possible to the local game war
den and any tresspasser will proba
bly be drawn into court, and the mat
ter will be brought to the notice of
the next grand jury.
ONLY ONE CANDIDATE
IN RACE IN CARLISLE.
As yet there is but one candidate
for a city office in Carlisle at the No
vember election. Judge Thomas S.
Watson, Democratic nominee for Po-
llice Judge, is the only candidate. No
j other nominations for city offices were
.made in the primary by the Demo
icrats and neither Republicans or Pro
'gresives offered any candidates. It
is said, however, that Mayor John H.
.Frey and the members of the present
Council will be candidates, and that
their names will be on the ballot by
petition. It is said former Postmaster
Homer B. Bryson, a Republican, may
also file a petition to get his name on
the ballot as an independent candi
dte for Police Judge. ( All of the inde
pendidate candidates' will probably
make the race on the Citizens' ticket. !
COST OF LIVING CONSIDERED
BY APPELLATE COURT.
"Courts of this State have been
very conservative in the amount of
damages which they permit to be as
sessed in personal injury cases, but
of late years, in view of the decreased
purchasing power of money, they
have shown a disposition to approve
larger verdicts," said the Court of
Appeals Tuesday morning, affirming
a verdict of ?25,000, awarded in the
Peterson was 55 yars of age.
iie . Shelby
Circuit Court against the
Complaints have been lodged with
the local game warden against the
ruthless slaughter of the fish that re
remain in Stoner Creek above the dam
of the Paris Milling Co., which is
made possible by the low stage of the
j creek at the present time. With a
jview of protecting the fish that are
'remaining, practically all of the land
owners on both sides of the creek
from the mill to Spears' Mill have had
their property posted, but there seems
no relief from the onslaught of the ir
responsible persons who are taking
advantage of the condition of the
creek to gig and seine.
It has been the endeavor of the
sportsmen of this city and county to
have Stoner Creek stocked with a
supply of fish that would furnish sport
for "the legitimate fisherman, and it
has taken years to do so. Unfor-
