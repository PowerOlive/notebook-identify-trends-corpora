Functions of the War BoardWashington May 25 There aresigns in Madrid that have been notedhere seeming to warrant the supposition that there has been a completechange in the Spanish plan of conducting the war Indications are believedto point to a relaxation if not atotal abandonment of the effortsto conduct the campaign in Cubaand the West Indian waters Thenatural conclusion if this premise iswell founded would be that theSpaniards were going to concentratetheir entire energies to the defense ofthe Philippines with the view to retaining them in the event peace isforced upon them by virtue of theprinciple of international law whichlimits a victorious nation in indemnifying herself from the vanquished tothe territory she actually occupieswhen peace is declared So the retreatof the Spanish squadron from theWest Indies would be significant firstin the danger it would place Deweyimmediately and second in the hintit would convey that the Spanish mindfor the first time contemplates thepossibilities of peaceThe war board lately known as thestrategy board had a short sessionTuesday morning There appears tobe a great misconception on the partof the public and newspapers as tothe nature of this board its composition and manner of work According to the popular mind this boardsits in the navy department and withautocratic orders directs the movements of fleets and the execution ofplans of campaigns down to the verysmallest details This conception hasled to a good deal of comment somehumorous and some serious at the expense of the board and the idea hadeven spread to Europe where so conservative a paper as the London Timeshas delivered itself of this criticismIt would be wise in the future toleave the direction of operations tonaval commanders Councils havenever pro red capable directors of warTheir proper function is to obtain information and to forward it to the admiral who must be as Nelson claimedthe right to be free to act when thefitting opportunity arrivedNow Secretary Long is a member ofthe war board at least he is frequenty with it during its sessions and hesays that the views of the Times as tothe proper functions of a war councilexpress exactly the functions conferred upon and exercised by the navalwar board It has worked ceaselesslyand intelligently to learn the movements of the enenry and the enemys plans and to gather all kindsof information that could be of valueto the United States naval commanders now at sea It has not undertakento hamper them with unnecessary instructions but supplying them withall information obtainable thatmight assist has kept ever inmind the principle that the commander on the spot is the person best qualified to act Theboard has not made a single mistakesince the beginning of the war wasthe tribute that Secretary Long paidto it Just how little it interfereswith our naval commanders is shownin the epigramatic message to Deweyat Hong KongCommence operations at once particularly against the Spanish fleetYou must capture vessels or destroyThere was no suggestion there of unnecessary instructions And again atSan Juan according to SecretaryLong all that the board did was toauthorize Adm Sampson to proceedas he did and attack the place Helikewise had no vexatious limitationspassed upon himCOMMODORE WATSONNow in Charge of the Blockading Squadron at HavanaTroops Arriving at ChickamausraChattanooga

Officials Have InformationThat He is at Santiago HemmedIn By Oar VesselsWashington May 26 There seemsto be no longer any doubt that theSpanish fleet now in Santiago harboris hemmed in by Commodore Schleyssquadron and that their escape is almost if not quite impossible Members of the cabinet are exultant overWednesdays news and although theyare not willing to make public thesource of their information they regard it as perfectly trustworthy Theythe exact positionare not willing to statetion of Sampsons fleet but do saythnt it is actincr in concertwith Schley and can come to hisrelief at any time should the situationrequire it The published report thatanother and more formidable fleet isen route from Cadiz to the relief of theimprisoned squadron is not creditedby members of the administrationbut should this prove to be the factthe move would be welcomed byour naval authorities as it wouldcertainly result it is said inthe destruction of the two fleetsinstead of one It is authoritativelystated that the situation of the Santiago harbor is such that our gunboatswhich are available for the purposecould successfully prevent the escapeof the Spaniards thus relieving a considerable part of both Sampsons andSchleys fleets for operations elsewhereMembers of the administration regardthe present situation as mostfavorable for our cause and donot doubt that in a very shortspace of time the Spanish fleetwill be utterly destroyed and activeoperations begun against Havana andCuba by both our military and navalforces The safe arrival of the Oregon at Jupiter inlet Fla

oerI can hear the mistyriver breakingon its ghostly1 - shoreAt the window with my crutches as thedaylight fades awayI sit and watch the shadows neath thehoary maples playIt is then I hear the music of a bugle loudand shrillAnd the long- roll in the twilight seems tocome from yonder hillBut awake or dreaming ever I can see theold blue linesAnd again the army marches marchesunderneath the pinesWith a tread that echoes ever in the veterans heart to dayMarches still that grand old army mongthe trees so far awayAnd I see its banners floating proudlygainst the azure skyJust as though beneath my window it today were passing byI can recognize the comrades touching elbows as of yoreWith a beautiful devotion that will liveforever moreAnd the sun in cloudless heavens uponblade and baynet shinesAnd the breezes stir the pennons of thearmy in the pinesSitting here I count the marches one cannever more forgetI can see the gleaming camp fires whenthe stars their watch have setYonder rides the graybeard colonel witha comrades smile for allThat morning In the wilderness he wasthe first to fallI remember how we laid him neath thedark green branches lowAnd turned to meet the charges of the evervaliant foeI seem to hear wars thunder as it rolledalong our linesWaking not the dear old colonel sleepingsweetly neath the pinesfcut my crutches oft remind me that ourbattle flags are furldThat where we fought the angel Peace proclaims to alfthe worldThat love cements the sections and thatbrothers true to dayBeneath the starry banner fair stand boththe Blue and GrayThe roses bloom in beauty where we heardthe mad shells screamAnd southern lilies grow beside the squadron guarded streamAnd everywhere this sacred day lovegratefully entwinesA fragrant wreath in memory of the armyin the pinesThe sound of music thrills me they arecoming down the streetI plainly hear upon the wind the trampof many feetWith natures treasures beautiful theymarch again to keepMemorial day and crown the boys whereside by

Lincolns cifor troops The came from a quietfarm home in one of the northern counties of Indiana All of them left homefor the battlefields with a mothersblessing on their heads but the mothersheart went out especially to the youngest her baby He was but a boy of 19to whom the hard work of the farm hadalways been more of a burden than hisfrail body could bear and for that reason he was made much of by the othermembers of the family But men wereneeded her sons thought it their placeto go and it was not her part to standin the way of their duty to their countryMonth after month wore away Themother watched anxiously for eachmail and was occasionally rewardedwith a letter always from her babyHe told her of his brothers of the armyof their camp life of their marches andtheir battles but of himself he told herlittle except that he was as well as usualBut the mother read between the linesThe hardships of campaigning waswearing away her babys health andhow she longed for himAnd then one day a letter came fromHiram His brother the mothersbaby was ill and they would sendhim home to her She could feel almoM glad that he was sick for it wouldbring him back How carefully shewould nurse him and by the time thewar was over he should be well againBut the mothers hopes were not to berealized Her baby came home to heronly to be taken away again foreverShe watched beside his bedside she didall the many lititle things that only amother knows how to do but withoutsuccess Long before the war was overthey had laid him in the little cemeteryand his furlough was extended intoeternityWhen the old folks died the farm ofmore than 00 acres was left to Hiramand Josiah Walker to be divided equally or worked together as the brothersmight choose For several years theyfarmed their laud together and thenIliram married After that the landwas divided Hiram taking the part onwhich the home stood for himself andhis bride and Josiah was to make hishome with themAdded to the ties of blood were theties of comradeship on the battlefieldsof the south and tlie3 seemed inseparable Nothing it seemed could comebetween them They assisted each other in their work they shared each others earnings they made it a point toplant at the same time they reapedtheir crops at the same time and theysold the products of their farms to thesame men Their liveb were the happ3ones of peace and good willAnd then came a time of doubt ofhard words and all the comradeship ofthe past was forgottenIt was in the winter time and bothbrothers were fattening hogs for market The pens in which their hogs werekept adjoined and da3 after day theyhad stooc together and remarked aboutthe condition of the stock One morn-ing as Joiiah came out to the barnyardhe found his brother counting his hogsand as he reached his side Hiram turnedto him and saidJosh theres a board loose and oneof my shoats has worked its wa3 intoyour pen I think its the spotted onein the corner thereGuess youre mistaken niramthats

either would nave gladly given theother had he asked it wos to come between them -At his first opportunity Hiram car-lied out his intention of putting the piginto his own pen and in less than 24Jiours afterwards he was arrested ona warrant sworn out by his brotherThe case went through the justicecourt with a decision for Josiah whenappealed to the grand jury the decisionwas the other way At a retrial the decision was again reversed and then itwent to the state courts where it wastried time after time until now it hadreached the supreme court and Hiramhoped to have the last decision againstbiin reversedDuring the progress of the case bothbrothers had become heavily involvedin raising the money needed to paycourt and attorneys fees Hiram sfarm had been mortgaged his cropssold to pay the same kind of bills Theneeds of his family had counted fornaught against this legal monster Hisboy had left school that he might takethe place of a hired man and so savethat expense as well as that incurredhy his schooling The daughters haddone without the clothes they were accustomed to They and their motherhad worked over their old ones untilthey would bear no more and thencame this plea

Turlcy demTenn While Mr Lodge confinedhimself to a discussion of the proposed tax on corporations and bankdeposits strongly urging that such taxes benot imposed Mr Chilton and Mr Turley covered pretty fully the general features of thebill Their speeches dealt comprehensivelywith the theories of taxation and were therefore in the very nature of things legal andtechnical dissertations upon the subjectJJ Noaction of any kind was taken upon the billHouse The day in the house was devotedchiefly to the consideration of District of Columbia legislation Two bills of minor importance affecting the volunteer military werepassed -Washington May 25 Senate That feature of the war revenue measure placing a taxof one quarter of one per centum upon thegross receipts of corporations was under discussion in the senate throughout Tuesdayssession Incidentally the proposed tax onbank deposits was adverted to The principalspeeches were delivered by Mr Piatt repCt and Mr Lindsay dem Ivy both ofwhom vigorously attacked the corporationtax The weight of the formers argumentwas thrown aaiust the tax on the groundthat it was unconstitutional because the taxwas not levied alike upon all persons engagedIn a particular lines of business He maintained that an occupation tax could be leviedprovided that the conditions were fair andequitable but that the business of a corporation could not be taxed simply because iiwas conducted by a corporation Mr Lindsay vigorously antagonized the proposed issue of legal tender notes declaring that it accentuated the existingmenace to the gold reserve of the treasury andwas besides the dearest money ever devi edHe held that such an isue would be a hlovrto the nations financial credit He also presented an argument against the proposed corporation tax maintaining that if enacted intolaw it would breed a batch of lawsuits instead of providing what the government neededready money with which to conduct thewar operationsHouse The session of the house

frankly announced that if certain provisions of the billput into it by the democrat on the financecommittee were not agreed to by the senate hewould offer some amendments to the measurethat probably would precipitate debate Hestrongly intimated too that if the war sho Idnot be prolonged it might not be necessary toprovide so such revenue as the pending bill would raise and adesire to await

irigh Explosivesand Its OperationThe newest type of dynamite gunconaists of two tubes placed directly oneabove the other whereas in the old typethere are three tubes placed side byside in the same horizontal plane Theelimination of the third tube means agreat saving- in the weight of the guntmd at the same time it is claimed itseffectiveness is increased It is saidthat the gun can be fired at least fivetimes in two minutesOf the two tubes the upper is severalfeet the longer and is smooth bore -Itreceives the projectile and the materialused in its construction is either brassor steel the latter being preferableWithin the lower tube there is an innertube in which the blank cartridge containing seven ounces of smokeless powder is placed The inner tube opens intothe lower tube which in turn oiensintothe upper tube through a port immediately behind the projectile When theprojectile is placed in the upper tubeand the blank cartridge in the lowerthe breeches are closed and the gun isready for firing The pulling of thelanyard xplods the smokeless powder which compresses the air in thetube and this passing info the uppertube through the port exerts there apressure of 5000 pounds to the squareinch This presstire expels the projectile The air forms a cushion andprotects from shock the walls of theshell and it is claimed obviates thedanger which would follow from theconcussion of the powder were it exploded directly behind the projectileThe entire length of the projectileused is 34 inches This includes a tailpiece about ten inches in length andfitted with a vane set at an angle thatinsures slow rotation The body of theshell is a brass cylinder having a conicalhead containing a fuse The mainbody of the shell contains usually acharge of explosive gelatine although iguncotton or any other explosive maybe used The ignition is effected bymeans of a mechanical fuse and it issc arranged that the explosion can fol 1low immediately upon impact ormay be delayed for as much as six seconds thereafter When the shell strikesthe water or any other object a smallsteel ball acting as a hammer is drivenfoi ward by the sudden retardation ofthe flight of the shell and strikes one ormore percussion caps causing a detonation This ignites a tube of powdercommunicating with the fulminate ofmercury and so explodes successivelythe guncotton and the main explosiveThe fuse embodies a device which renders the shell inactive until it has traveled at least 300 feet from the gun Thisdevice is very ingenious There is attached to the head of the fuse a littlevane or windmill

WARThere was a great rush of feet acrossthe deck I could hear people tumblingup from the cabin and the foksle andslipping in an instant outside my barrel I dived behind the foresail madea double toward the stem and cameout upon the open deck in time to joinHunter and Dr Livesey in the rush forthe weather bowThere all hands were already congregated A belt of fog had lifted almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon Away to thesouthwest of us we saw two low hillsabout a couple of miles apart andrising behind one of them a thirdand higher hill whose peak was stillburied in the fog All three seemedsharp and conical in figureSo much I saw almost in a dreamfor I had not yet recovered from mjhorrid fear of a minute or two before And then I heard the voice ofCapt Smollett issuing orders TheHispaniola was laid a couple ofpoints nearer the wind and now saileda course that would just clear the island on the eastAnd now men said the captainwhen all was sheeted home has anyone of you ever seen that land aheadI have sir said Silver Ive watered there with a trader I was cookinThe anchorage is on the south behind an islet I fancy asked the captainYes sir Skeleton island they callit It were a main place for piratesonce and a hand we had on boardknowed all their names for it The hillto the norard they calls the Foremasthill there are three hills in a row running southward fore main and mizzen sir But the main thats the bigun with the cloud on it they usuallycalls the Spy glass by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in theanchorage cleaning for its there theycleaned their ships sir asking yourpardonI have a chart here says CaptSmollett See if thats the placeLong Johns eyes burned in his headas he took the chart but by the freshlook of the paper 1 knew he wasdoomed to disappointment This wasnot the map we found in Billy Poneschest but an accurate copy completein all things names and heights andsoundings with the single exceptionof the red crosses and the written notesSharp as must have been his annoyance Silver had the strength of mindto hide itYes sir said he this is the spotto be sure and very prettily drawedout Who might have done that Iwonder The pirates were too ignorant 1 reckon Ay here it is CaptKidds anchorage just the name myshipmate called it Theres a strongcurrent runs along the south and thenaway norard up the west coast Rightyou was sir says he to haul yourwind and keep the weather of theisland Leastwavs if such was vourintention as to enter and careen andthere aint no better place for that inthese watersThank you my man says CaptSmollett Ill ask you later on togive us a help You ma- goI was surprised at the coolness withwhich John avowed his knowledge ofthe island and 1 own I was half frightened when I saw him drawing nearerto myself He did net know to be surethat I had overheard his council fromthe apple barrel and yet 1 had by thistime taken such a horror of his crueltyduplicity and power that I couidscarce conceal a shudder when he laidhis hand upon my armAh says he this here is a sweetspot this island a sweet spot for a ladto get ashore on Youll bathe andyoull climb trees and youll huntgoats you will and youll get alofton them hills like a goat yourselfWhy it makes me young again Iwas going to forget my timber leg Iwas Its a pleasant thing to be youngand have ten toes and you may layto that When you want to go a bitof exploring you just ask old John andhell put up a snack for you to takealongAnd clapping me in the friendliestway upon ihc shoulder he hobbled offforward and went belowCapt Smollett the squire and DrLivesey were talking together on thequarter deck and anxious as 1 was totell them my story 1 durst not interrupt them openly While I was stillcasting aroout in my thoughts to findsome probable excuse Dr Liveseycalled nu to his side lie iiad left hispipe below nud being a slave tohad icam that 1 should fetch itfsy n jiintHMHyyWiK j r wiiiitniriiJJIIJIJ p ijiiWfWTbut as soon as I was near enough tosjDeak and not be overheard I broke outimmediately Doctor let me speakGet the captain and squire down tothe cabin and then make some pretenseto send for me I have terrible newsThe doctor changed countenance alittle but next moment he was masterof himselfThank you Jim said he quiteloudly that was all 1 wanted toknow as if he had asked me a questionAnd with that he turned on his heeland rejoined the other two Theyspoke together for a little and thoughnone of them started or raised hisvoice or so much as whistled it wasplain enough that Dr Livesey had communicated my request for the nextthing that I heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson and allhands were piped on deckMy lads said Capt Smollett Ivea word to say to you This land thatwe have sighted is the place we havebeen sailing to Mr Trelawney beinga very open handed gentleman as weall know has just asked me a word ortwo and as 1 was able to tell him thatevery man on board had done his dutyalow and aloft as I never ask to see itdone better why he and 1 and thedoctor are going below to the cabin todrink your health and luck and youllhave grog served out for you to drinkour health and luck Ill tell you what1 think of this I think it handsomeAnd if you think as I do youll givea good sea cheer for the gentleman thatdoes itxThe cheer followed that was a matter of course but it rang out so fulland hearty that 1 confess I could hardly Relieve these same men were plotting for our bloodOne more cheer for Capn Smollettcried Long John when the first hadsubsidedAnd this also was given with a willOn the top of that the three gentlemen went below and not long afterword was sent forward that JimHawkins was wanted in the cabinI found them all three seated roundthe table a bottle of Spanish wine andsome raisins before them and the doctor smoking away with his wig on hislap and that I knew was a sign that hewas agitated The stern window wasopen for it was a warm night and youcould see the moon shining behind onthe ships wakeXow Hawkins said the squireyou have something to say SpeakupI did as I was bid and as short asI could make it told the whole detailsof Silvers conversation Nobody interrupted me till it was done nor didan oue of the three make so much asa movement but they kept their eyesupon my face from first to lastJim said Dr Livesey take aseatAnd they made me sit down at tablebeside them poured me out a glass ofwine filled my hands with raisinsand all three one afer the other andeach with a bow drank my good healthcourageNow captain said the squire youwere right and T was wrong I owninyself an ass and I await your ordersNo more an ass than 1 sir returned the captain I never heard of acrew that meant to mutiny but whatshowed signs before for any man thathad an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps accordingly Butthis crew he added beats meCaptain said the doctor withyour permission thats

mSHORE ADVENTURECHAPTER XIIIBEGAN MY SHORE ADVENTUREThe appearance of the island when Icame on deck next morning was altogether changed Although thebreeze had now utterly failed we hadmade a great deal of way during thenight and were now lying becalmedabout half a mile to the southeast ofthe low eastern coast Gray coloredwoods covered a large part of the surface This even tint was indeedbroken up by streaks of yellow sandbreak in the lower lands and by manytall trees of the pine family out-toppingthe others some singly some inclumps but the general coloring wasuniform and sad The hills ran upcicar above the vegetation in spires ofnaked rock All were strangelyshaped and the Spy -glass which wasby 300 or 400 feet the tallest on theisland was likewise the strangest inconfiguration running up sheer fromalmost every side and then suddenlycut off at the top like a pedestal to puta statue onThe Hispaniola was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell Thebooms were tearing at the blocks therudder was banging to and fro andthe whole ship creaking groaning andjumping like a manufactory I had tocling tight to the backstay and theworld turned giddily before my eyesfor though I was a good enough sailorwhen there was way on this standingstill and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never learned to standwithout a qualm or so above all in themorning on an empty stomachPerhaps it was this perhaps it wasthe look of the island -with its graymelancholy woods and wild stonespires and the surf that we could bothsee and hear foaming and thunderingon the steep beach at least althoughthe sun shone bright and hot and theshore birds were fishing and crying allaround us and you would have thoughtanj one would have been glad to get toland after being so long at sea myheart sunk as the saying is into myboots and from that first look onwardI hated the very thought of TreasureIslandWe had a dreary mornings work before us for there was no sign of anywind and the boats had to be got outand manned and the ship warped threeor four miles round the corner of theisland and up the narrow passage tothe haven behind Skeleton island Ivolunteered for one of the boats whereI had of course no business Theheat was sweltering and the mengrumbled fiercely over their workAnderson was in command of my boatand instead of keeping the crew inGrder he grumbled as lotul as theVoorstWell he said with an oath itsnot foreverT thought this was a very bad signtor up to that day the men had goneand their service to me for my luck and vBciskly and willingly about theirfcfTfcss -but the very sight of the islandfjhad relaxed the cords of disciplineAll the -way in Long John stood- bythe steersman and conned the shipHe knew the passage like the palm ofhis hand and though the man in thechains got everjwhere more waterthan was down in the chart John neverhesitated onceTheres a strong scour with theebb he said and this here passagehas been dug out in a -manner of speaking with a spadeWe brought up just where the anchor was in the chart about a third ofa mile from either shore the mainlandon one side and Skeleton island on theother The bottom was clean sandThe plunge of our anchor sent upclouds of birds -wheeling and cryingover the woods but in less than a min-ute they were all dowu again and allwas once more silentThe place was entirely land lockedburied in woods the trees comingright down to high water mark theshores mostly flat and the hill topsstanding round at a distance in a sort ofamphitheater one here one there Twolittle rivers or rather two swampsemptied out

buriedamong trees and if it had not beenfor the chart on the companion wemight have been the first that had everanchored there since the island aroseout of the seasThere was not a breath of air moving nor a sound but that of the surfbooming half a mile away along thebeaches and against the rocks outsideA peculiar stagnant smell hung overthe anchorage a smell of soddenleaves and rotten tree trunks I observed the doctor sniffing and sniffinglike some one tasting a bad eggI dont know about treasure hesaid but Ill stake my wig theresfever hereIf the conduct of the men had beenalarming in the boat it became trulythreatening when they had comeaboard They lay about the deckgrowling together in talk The slightest order was received with a blacklook and grudgingly and carelesslyobeyed Even the honest

mother whowas in the liext room could come to his rescue In tearing his clothing trom him theskin and ilesh came off in strips and themothers hands were badly burned Theskin came off his body from above the middleof the back to below the calves of his legsThe burn was deep and the case desperateFor two months he was under the care of ourfamily physician We then took him to StPaul and acting under his alvice called in oneof the leading surgeons of the city who tookthe case in charge Other physicians werecalled in consultation sixty pieces of skinwere grafted at one time yet notwithstanding all the skill of the doctors and the mostunremitting care two months afterwards allhope had been given up For months hehad1 lain on pillows with his face down andbuffered terribly He had no appetite andcould retain nothing on his stomachThe sores were indolent and for twomonths had lain perfectly dormant MyAttention was then called to Allens UlcerineBalve and in desperation ready to try anything that promised help we commenced itsuse Results were apparent at once It atonce aroused the sores to action and stimulated a healthy discharge We kept theboys strength up with a

weight per cubic footprincipally for the amount of pressureto which it has been subjected Hencethe last foot or live feet in a silo whichhas been filled up to 20 feet deep ismuch heavier because more

more than 24 or 30inches high With modern implementsof cultivation there is no need of havingthe tops formed as cur fathers used toso as to allow a horse to walk under thebranches By forming the top lowthere is less danger of injury from highwinds and because the fruit is near theground the expense of harvesting ismuch less The pruning the first yearshould consist in shortening the leading branches of the last years growthleaving them distributed along thestem left at planting time Avoid having the branches radiate from a common center If properly distributedalong the trunk a branch broken bywind or an overload of fruit works nopermanent injury to the tree Pruning after the first year should consistin shortening the main branches so asto form a short jointed compnet headContinue this shortening process eachyear doing the work when the wood isdormant In this way the trees will bekept low and the fruit within easyreach Low trees will support all thefruit a tree ought to cany the expenseof ladders will be saved the fruit canbe more rapidly harvested and at leatten years will be added to the lifetimeof the tree If vigorous growth is allowed each year without shorteningn a few years the weight of the fruit isborne at the end of long brancheswhich are sure to break with the firstload of fruit destroying the tree justwhen it ought to be in its prime Manymake the mistake of thinning too muchthe small twigs from the insidebranches They will bear as goodfruit as is grown on the tree Xaturewill indicate when they ought to be removed Much of the work of thinningthe fruit

WormsThe currant worm is a slow travelerand seldom leaves the clump of busheswhere it was born and bred even whenit gets into the moth stage Where theave once eradicated on a farm someyears of exemption ma be hoped foreven when the pest is plentiful a fewmiles away Still the use of helleboreevery spring just as soon as the currant leaves appear and renewing itafter every rain is advisable It is farbetter to head off the intruder beforethe damage is done than to wait untilcurrant bushes are stripped bare Inthe latter case probably some of theworms have gone into the pupa stagebefore the poison is applied and will beon hand another spring AmericanCultivatorPaint to Repel BorersAll kinds of insects are attracted tothe plants which are appropriate fortheir food or where their eggs

office at that time on the second floorof this building On the main floor werethe offices of Keece Pierce Co I was inthe habit of stopping in each morning andgreeting Col Pierce and usually the

spending their money for champagne or at least one of them was witha liberality that was nigh akin to recklessness The number of quart bottlesthat they consumed was startling andevery time the colored attendant broughtin a fresh bottle he was presented witha 1 note Whenever the contents ofone were pretty nearly gone the elderof the bacchanalians shouted out to thewaiter Who told you to stop bringingin wineBut along toward evening the supply ran out much to the disgust of thepair and they had to be content withhigh halls cocktails and other plebeiandrinks These were sufficient howeverto keep up their spirits and later inthe night 1 could hear them yelling foranother roundThe next day the conductor of thetrain told me that this couple had beenriding up and down the road for nearlya week and that they hadnt drawn asober breath in all that while It seemed that it was the odd way taken by thesenior member to indulge in a spreeHe took the younger man along merelyfor company and footed all the billsAbout once a year the notion took himto go off on a tear and not wishing toindulge in inebriation at home hecouldnt think of as good a scheme asriding continuously on a trunk
