"iiS'Sxr X Shoi,jr auuuicj u. u. vjime, orParis.Following administration of thev, ,, w.l.u.o j.w. iii. vnn.cj' clilUjames Gibson, the grand jury wasselected and sworn in. The jury iscomposed of the following: JohnWoodford, foreman; John R. Fisher,Chas. B. Layson, Tollie Youns:.Lindsay Stewart, S. W. Spears, J.W. Young, Jr., T. J. Kiser, H. L.Baldwin, Robert Jones, Wm. P. Wornall, A. H. Buckner.In his charge to the Grand JuryJudge Stout, called attention to thefact that in their hands and alsothose who were to follow them onfuture juries rested the reputation- or the occurrence yesterdav in theneighboringcounty of Woodford,where a mob, without excuse, tookfrom the county jail a prisoner andexecuted him. I have been goingover the State bragging about thecitizenship to serve as juror. Whenever a defendant feels that he hasbeen tried by a fair jury he is in ameasure satisfied. When the citizens feel that both the defendantand the State have had a fair andsquare deal from the jury,, there willbe no trouble. So long as the courtsare compelled to take on men whoare not fit to serve as jurors therewill occasionally crop out the mobspirit. The State does not exactgreat sacrifices from its citizens,when it asks them to serve as jurors.It was a matter of satisfaction tohi,m, Judge Stout said, that he hadbeen informed by the Sheriff andCounty Attorney that conditions inBourbon county, so far as violationsof the law are concerned, are excellent. Of course, there are some violations of the law, but the generalconditions are something to beproud of. It is a valuable asset toany community to have a reputationfor peace and good order.At the conclusion of the Judge'scharge the iro-rbcrs of the GrandJury returned to their rooms to begin their labors. The Case of Raymind Fryman, charged with cuttingand wounding Dr. BaylesS, of Louisville, during an altercation on theNorth Middletown pike, about a yearago, will be called for trial duringthis term. A number of cases foralleged violation of the prohibitionlaws are also on the docket, to betried at this term.Judge Stout issued an order yesterday calling a special term of theWoodford Circuit Court for March26, to conduct an investigation intothe lynching of Richard James, colored, on Sunday morning, near Versailles by a mob of masked men.of CowsCOMMERCIAL CITJB LUNCHEON.Robert Lee Stout, Judge of theBourbon Circuit Court, will speak atthe Commercial Club noon luncheonto-day. Judge B.M. Dickson will actas toastmaster. The announcementthat Judge Stout will speak will bewelcomed not only by the membersare acquainted with him. Judge Stout is avery impressive speaker, and the,fact that he has seldom spoken before meetings in Paris in the pastwill make him all the more welcome.There has been some misunderstanding about the luncheon, many havinggained the impression that it is tobe served in the Wilson building, aswere the last two.

ITRY THE OTHER TACKSay, people of Paris, don't talkpessimism. It puts similar ideas intothe minds of other people, and suchideas create doubt and uncertainty,and hamper the ordinary progress ofcommercial activity and expansion.If you can't see anything good inthe future get some other fellow todo your looking for you until you adjust yourself to conditions and acquire a better perspective of affairsin general.If a pnan goes out in the morningand tells every person he meets thathe is sick, and keeps up the fictionfrom day to day, it will grow on himuntil he is in reality unfit for business. It is so in the business world. Ityou want to create disaster go outand preach it until other people begin to take stock in what you sayand to see things as you do.- Thenyou will soon have disaster at leastfor yourself. This frame of mind wasverv much in evidence in Paris during the days following the openingof the tobacco markets, when theslump in prices caused many to goabout with long faces, predictingeverything would go to smash in thebusiness world on that account. ButParis and Bourbon county didn't goto smash, and the old business shipis going along as smoothly as ifthere had never been such a thing inthe world as tobacco.If you want to make things betterand brighter in the business worlddon't be pessimistic' Quit growling.Talk better times and put the joy ofconfidence into other hearts as wellas your own. Paris and the countyare solidly founded on good businessprinciples and will continue to goalong safely as long as we continueto make it our duty to take the advantage of opportunities and reallydo something to encourage and promote prosperity.fl rfHACGrapeDo vou makethe gradeof atrying day's workfree from fatigue?For those who lack reservestrength and energyNutsis the ideal food.This sturdy blend of wholewheat and malted barley isrich in the very elementsrequired to build and maintain health and strengthKeady-Co6ked--Easy to DigestEconomicalMade by Postum Cereal Co-jIncBattk CreekCcb.Sold by Grocers EverywhereIHUllSBl!llS&lsIliESIIM SSJ:SLgi.'
