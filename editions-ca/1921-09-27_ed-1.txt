The wayyou have taken up horse breedingis particularly gratifying and is anexample for other communities tofollow. Every man and womanloves a good horse, and the peopleof this Valley can produce the bestkind as a by product of their farms.You've got the sod, the water, theclimate and the horses to breedfrom.""It is frequently said," resumedthe Senator, "that the horse will besupplanted by the tractor and theauto and that the world war provedit."If you -will examine the equipment of the late war you will findthat we had nearly as many horsesand mules per one thousand menin service as during the Civil War,when the tractor was not known.It isn't pleasant to discuss thepossibility of another war, but youmust remember that our defense willalways depend upon the resources ofthe country."And of these elements none surpass ,the horse and mule. Whilethe day may never come, and wehope it may not come, it is wise tobe prepared and it is a singular factthat in every conflict in which ourcountry has been involved, we haveentered it unprepared."That unpreparedness made theIlate war cost us some twenty-sixbillion, five hundred millions of dollars in bonds and certificates issued, besides some ten billions of dollars raised by direct taxation, all ofwhich the tax payers have to pay."Col. Stanley Koch, on page 7 inRemount Bulletin No. 18, publishedMarch 15, 1920, from the office ofthe Quartermaster General of theWar Department in Washington,said:"The army will always requirehorses in large numbers. Motortransportation can never entirely replace horses and particularly cavalryor riding horses. No matter to whatextent tractor and aircraft may beimproved the horse will always berequired in war."In the late World War due tothe scarcity of animals our tablesof organization were cut time aftertime to reduce the numbers of horsesrequired for a division, in an endeavor to substitute motor transportation, but we were never able toget below 4,991 animals per division and of this number 2,248 wereriding horses. This you must remember refers to an Infantry Division. .We had no mounted cavalry inTrance for the simple reason that wecould not provide horses for them.All wars are not going to be foughtunder the conditions of this one.The day of cavalry is not past. It isas important an arm as ever."Col. Raymond T. Briggs, in Re-i mount Bulletin No. 23, Page 12, says:"The British Army in France hasnow about 440,000 animals dividedapprorimately into 115,000 ridinghorses, 165,000 light draft horses,70,000 heavy draft horses, 6,000pack horses and 84,000 mules."FORMER PARIS GIRL VICTIM OPPOISONING"PARIS BOY EDITOR OE C0LLEG1PAPERThe Crimson Rambler, studentpublication of Transylvania Collegemade its first appearance this seasonFriday afternoon.

Some years agothe family moved to Lonisville, whereMr. Hukill died, his wife precedinghim to the grave several years. TheLouisville Herald yesterday carriedthe following story regarding the untimely end of the pretty Paris girl, avictim of cocaine poisoning."Mrs. Judith Yent, 32, 711 WestChestnut street, is dead and GeorgeW. Williams, 25, who lived at thesame address, is in a serious condition at the City Hospital as the result of cocaine poisoning, caused byan overdose of the drug which Williams says was administered by thewoman at her home at 9 o'clock lastnight."Dr. J. C. McCreary, who was called when Williams became sick fromthe effects of the drug, said he wasadministering antidotes to Williamswhen Mrs. Yent said, "I am sick,too. I believe I am going to die."He then transferred his attentions toher, but she died a few momentslater."Police who were called to thehouse at 9:30 o'clock found Mrs.Yent dead and Williams in a seriouscondition. Williams was rushed tothe City Hospital, where his lifeprobably was saved by the promptwork of attendants."Williams told police he had beenliving at 711 West Chestunt streetfor some time and had been goingwith Mrs. Yent, who has been separated from her husband for severalyears. He said that the woman frequently had used drugs and that lastnight she asked him if "he wanteda shot." He informed the policethat he had had several drinks ofwhisky and that he permitted her to"shoot something into him with ahypodermic needle.""I had been trying to persuade herto let it alone," he said. "I wouldnot have taken it myself if I had notbeen drinking.""Coroner O. L. Carter was calledon the case and pronounced the deathof Mrs. Yent due to cocaine poisoning. He said she had taken a doseof cocaine that vererinarians useforhorses. Police are trying to learnAvhere the drug was obtained."

Teacher is still studying the matter.A Paris man who thinks he hassaid something original wants toknow whether the world can be mariomoral by blue laws, boards of censorship, prohibitory legislation, andall the rest of it. We give it up.But perhaps it would help some iffirst there should be agreement as towhat that word "moral" connotes.A Paris young woman out motoringwith her steady company playfullyparked a caterpiller on the back ofhis neck as they were coming downMain street, and he was fined forreckless driving. Fine sense of humor, that! Suppose she carried bananas to funerals so that she can scatter the peels in front of the pallbearers, eh?The latest fashion dictum fromParis, (France, of course) saysthat gowns shall be tight up againstthe neck and front and backs shall bebare to the waist.

TheyI may, however, be excused when it isconsidered that the Rhoda Royal bis?railroad show is coming with an aggregation of Ting attractions and;great zoological collection from thejungles and forests of five continents.There is a large, three-ring show, amonster menagerie, which, by theway, is entirely distinct and separate from the wild beast show, whichconsists of all kinds of savage'brutes, exhibited in startling performances, in a huge steel-barredcircular cage, the same as seen inthe European capitals, New Yorkand Chicago, and at the AtlanticExhibition. Then there is a real Roman hippodrome, and a world of wonders which space forbids a detailedaccount of here. All in all the Royal"shows are to be a most surprising,and pleasing unification of all thatis new and wonderful in the greatshow world. There will be a grandstreet parade, and the tents will bepitched at the Murphy show grounds.o (THOSE NAUGHTY PARIS, FRANCE,GIRLS.SOCIAL AND PERSONAL.Comings and Goings of OurPeople Here, There andElsewhere.Most folk in this country thoughtthe girls of Paris (France) werethoroughly impregnated with thenaughtiness of the world. They were Jpresumed to be connoisseurs of allthe small vices extant. Yet it isbut recently that French womenhave taken to smoking cigarettes.So far as the gentler sex is concerned practically all the smoking inParis is done by English and American women. In this seclusion ofher own rooms a French damselmight touch off a torch, but she wasseldom seen puffing smoke in a publicplace. That was for the visitorsfrom England and America. But theFrench women have been watchingtheir sisters from across the waterfor so long that they are getting intothe habit themselves and now it isbecoming quite the thing for theFrench maids and matrons to burna cigarette after a meal in hotel,restaurant or private home. Theymay yet learn to hit the pipe; Pari3,France, may yet be as naughty asi Paris, Ky.

It exisrssomewhere, but it is not here, and gowhere you will it is not there, atleast not so plentifully as formerly.The banks haven't got it as they oncehad, nor has the government, andprivate hoardings are not believedto account for the deficit. There harealwa3rs been haorders.Bankers explain that the quantityof money is really as great as ever,but that curtailment of credit andthe slackening of industrial andother operations has checked itscirculation. In the days of plenty,money passed from hand to handquickly, each handler having a quantity of it for a brief time. He gotmore, and he spent more, than now,and that is all.The experts deny that money is onthe wing and claim that the realtrouble is that it is not using itswings, because of the unavoidableconditions of readjustment.The truth of the matter is that ayear ago a great many people werespending money recklessly and evenfoolishly, and this put lots of moneyin circulation. To-day these samepeople are economizing, some from'Choice, and this has reduced the volume of money in circulation. Thatis all there is to it.It will be a good thing for the-country, and for the every individualin it, if the foolish flush times neverreturn. It wasn't sound business,and without sound business thecountry cannot really prosper.GIRLS!

Onehalf of the deaths from the disease,to which children particularly aresubject, occur every year withinthree months after schools reopen."These deaths are absolutely needless. If, after the disease has beenacquired, enough antitoxin is administered to the child suffering within jthe first three days of the disease'scourse, the sufferer's life will be saved every time. The thing for parents to do is to send each childwhich has a sore throat to a doctorimmediately, and, where he has hadthe disease, not to permit him to return to school until he is shown bya laboratory analysis to be completely cured."Last year for the first time sincevital statistics in Kentucky havebeen kept the death rate from diphtheria increased. This did notalarm us especially as the increasein this State conformed to an increase all over the United .States,but the State Board of Health isanxious to keep the disease well inhand this year."Dr. C.
