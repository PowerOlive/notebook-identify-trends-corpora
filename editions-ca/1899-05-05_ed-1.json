THE BOURBON NEWS JfAI3 H7 FH1DAY MAY 5 1899
ER IS DEADLY
This fearful disease often first appears
as a mere scratch a pimple or lump in
the breast too small to attract any
notice until in many cases the deadly
disease is fully developed
Cancer can not be cured by a surgical
operation because the disease is a virulent
iison in the blood circulating throughout the system and although
e sore or ulcer known as the Cancer may be cut away the
poison remains in the blood and promptly breaks out afresh with
renewed violence
The wonderful success of S S S in curing obstinate deep seated
tlood diseases which were considered incurable induced a few de
spairing sufferers to try it for Cancer after exhausting the skill of
the physicians without a cure Much to their delight S S S proved
qual to the disease and promptly effected a cure The glad news
preaa rapidly and it was soon demonstrated
foeyond doubt that a cure had at last been
tfound for deadly Cancer Evidence has accu
mulated which is incontrovertible of which
the following is a specimen
Cancer is hereditary in our family my father a
ister and an aunt having died from this dreadful
disease My feelings may be imagined when the hor
rible disease made its appearance on my side It was
m malignant Cancer eating inwardly in such a way as
o cause great alarm The disease seemed beyond the
iskill of the doctors for their treatment did no good
whatever the Cancer growing worse all the while
Numerous remedies were used for it but the Cancer
MRS S M IDOL
grew steadily worse until it seemed that I was doomed
to follow the others of the family for I know how deadly Cancer is especially
when inherited I was advised to try Swifts Specific S S S which from the
first day forced out the poison I continued its use until I had taken eighteen
bottles when I was cured sound and well and have had no symptoms of the
dreadful affliction though many years have elapsed S S S is the ovij cure
for Cancer Mrs S M Idol Winston N C t

Equal to Occasion
Lord Whitworth who held various
lists of honor in English diplomatic
sircles was a kindly gracious gentle
man as well as a wit and a man of the
world He had indeed almost measured
Bwords with Napoleon at the Tnileries
when that despot railed at England for
not having evacuated Egypt and Malta
accused her of having violated treaties
and ended by flourishing a cane danger
ously near the face of the English em
bassador
Lord Whitworth put his hand on the
hilt of his sword
What would you have done it tire
emperor had struck you he was after
ward asked
I would have felled him to the
ground was the quiet answer
Perhaps the best story told of him is
one showing how his quick wit disposed
of a rival When he was at the Russian
court Fox sent there as a sort of em
bassador of bis own a man named Adair
the son of a surgeon
One day the empress speaking in
French said to Lord Whitworth
Is be a very important man this
M Adair
Not ao very madame replied Lord
Whitworth although his father was a
grand saigneur a remark which read
ers of French will recognize as a very
good pun for the word as used by Lord
Whitworth means blood letter while
by its sound it also meant a great lord
Youths Companion
The Poetical Old Lady
An old lady in a small country town
has kept for the last 20 years and still
keeps ber accounts in doggerel verse
For example and the specimens given
ure actual extracts from her books if
Mrs Jones has half a pound of tea on
tick it is entered thus
Mrs Jonea doth owe to me
For half a pound of Souchong tea Is 4d
Or if Mr Smith buys a pound of sug
ar two pounds of rice and a Dutch
cheese the entry will be under Smiths
name
A pound of moist sugar
And two of best rice
With four pounds of Dutch eheese
Which I hope will be nice Is lld
And so on all through the book In
some cases the verses express doubt as
to the customers intention or ability to
pay for the goods ordered Thus
Lizzie Barber for her father
Had some flour today
Some apples too and toilet soap
But 1 dont believe hell pay 2s 3d
This booking work will drive me mad
When 1 think of folk like they
The lines in brackets are very sugges
tive if not exactly grammatical
Chambers Journal
Cats and Monkeys
All animals even the wildest can be
subjected in some way to the dominion
of man and be domesticated to some ex
tent Here for instance are two very
curious facts about cats Many persons
including some of our greatest natriral
i6ts believe that our English domestic
cat U descended from the Egyptian do
mestic cat Yet all records go to prove
that the cats of Egypt lived in droves
were cared for in droves were fed in
droves and worshiped in droves with
the result that Egyptian cats never got
domesticated or became half as intelli
gent as ours
The like trnth is suggested from In
dia where monkeyB are worshiped
These are allowed to become nuisances
They are fed and thefy have any amount
of liberty and what is the consequence
They never lose their innate savagery
The method of caring for them has been
wrong All the devotion and care ex
pended en them are practically wasted
and if we treated our cats in the same
fashion as the Indians do these monkeys
they would become just as wild and un
domesticated Cassells Magazine
A Prince as a Railway Guard
Prince Chilkow the Russian minister

of all worked as an ordinary mechanic
in the locomotive works at Liverpool
after which he became a railway guard
and afterward station master at an Eng
lish town Returning to Russia he
again worked as a mechanic and after
ward as a station master After passing
several years on the Transcaspian rail
way he was made director of the Var
sovie railway then inspector general of
railways and finally minister Paris
