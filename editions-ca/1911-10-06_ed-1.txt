Payable inCan the Growers be Fooled.Whenever Judge O'Rear gets into atobacco district he promises the growers that if they will elect him Governor, he will get twelve cents for theirtobacco. He is making other promisesequally impracticable and impossibleof performance in a mad effort torange the tobacco people on his side inthis contest.As usual, the 'Judge's promises donot square with his actual performances. When the machine which worked with such precision at Phoenix Hillcame to the selection of a Secretaryof State, out popped Senator JackOliver Judge O'Rear's personalchoice for that office. Oliver's recordin the Legislature consistently opposedevery measure for the relief of the tobacco growers of this state, but JudgeO'Rear believed that it would strengthen the ticket in his section of the state,and so put this avowed enemy of thetobacco growers on the ticket.When the Democrats came to nominate a Secretary of State they selected Dr. C. F. Crecelius, of Pendletoncounty. When he was a member ofthe Legislature he prepared'the Crecelius tobacco bill, under which the farmers are protected in the pooling oftheir crops. Unuder the Doctor'svigorous championship it became alaw, thereby permitting the tobaccopeople to maintain the integrity oftheir pools, and get better prices fortheir products.This is only one more in the longlist of insincerities that can be laid atthe door of Judge O'Rear. He is forthe tobacco people when he thinks hecan gain a vote by it in one section,while playing into the hands of thtirenemies by selecting a man like Oliver, who voted against them in theLegislature at every opportunity.The ExConfedrates for GovernorMcCreary,When Augustus E. Willson ran furGovernor, he made a great parade cfthe fact that some of the Confederatesoldiers were for him, and he nevertired of telling how grateful he was tothese brave defenders, of the lost causefor their support. There were somefew Confederates, who, for personaljeasons, voted for Willson, but theyhave lived to regret it, as has everyother Democrat who trusted in Repu Vlifan promises or pledges.At the last session of the Legislatures bill was passed to.'erect a monument to Jefferson Davis, who wasborn in Kentucky, and who has wonimmortality as President of the Confederacy. Although the Democrats atthe session before had voted $2,500 forthe erection of a monument to, Abraham Lincoln, because he too was aKentucian ; Governor Willson, forgetting the Confederates had been forhim, vetoed their measure, and threwit back in the faces of its supporters.Governor McCreary is not runningfor office onfhis record as a Confederate soldier, But he served during thewar under the stars and bars, andthousands of his old comrades attesthis courage and fidelity. Even if hedid not have a claim that a brother inarms always has, they would still befor him, because they remember thetreachery cf Governor Willson, andthey have learned that the promises ofRepublican politicians are made onlyto be broken.Democracy Pleads for HonestElections.There is no more important plank inthe Democratic platform than SectionSix, which commits the party to thepassage of an act'that will punish allcorrupt practices in elections, andguaratees to every man that his voteshall be honestly counted as cast.Section Six is as follows:"We favor the enactment of an explicit and effective corrupt practiceact, which shall determine what camnaicn exnenses shall be legitimate.j and which provide for the compulsorypublication in detail, unoer neavypenalties, of the campaign epxenses ofevery candidate for public office."This Section supplements SectionFive, which provides for a direct' primary election law, providing that allprimary elections bejield at public ex-$1.00DEMOCRATIC STATE TICKET.For United States SenatorOLLIE M.

Kentucky has 'suffered in thepast from dishonest elections, and thepeople are demanding that these corrupt practices be stopped. The opportunity to institute this reform wllcome to the Democratic party afterthis election, because it will controlbcth Houses of theflLegislature.Governor McCreary is heartily infavor of the passage of this law. Hisinfluence put in in the platform, andhe will recommend it to the Legislature.and use all the power in his handsto gfve it a permanent place upon theStatute Book.When the people know hov; much aman spends for his nomination and hiselection, and from what source hiscampaign fund comes, they will be$ able to judge whether he is his ownmaster, or whether he must shape hisofficial acts to suit those who havebought his office for him.

In this campaign no candidate for office can fail to do his dutywithout sacrificing his honor.Bryan Agrees to Tour Kentucky.Secretary Bob Phillips, at the Democratic State Campaign heaJquarters inLouisville has announced that arrangements are approaching completion fora deluge of Democratic orators ofnational repute to speak in Kentuckyduring the month of October in theinterests of the Democratic Stateticket, headed by Mr. James B.

This idea of extreme simplicity is carried out in the veranda ofred corrugated iron supported on plain2 by 4 studding.If the building, the main building,lacks beauty, the old coal house ismuch worse. It looks as if after yearsof wear and tear the neighbors hadfelt sorry for it and had had something of a donation party. This, ofcourse, is merely a surmise, but it isthe only possible solution to the general makeup of the building. Evidently one neighbor had donatedsome old red roofing tin.

A buggy rattledon the road below, and a voice calledshrilly:"Hello! Anybody up there?""Yes, and I want to get in to put mylantern in place," answered 'the lecturer. "Didn't you hear that we hadchanged the place?" queried the voice."No.""Well, we did. You better get yourthings in your wagon and come downto the schoolhouse, half a mile downthe road, for the folks is there waitingfor you.""How did you happen to change theplace of the lecture at the last moment?" "It was this way: You see, we knewyou had to have a big light in yourlantern oil or sumthin' er otherand we knew, too. that you had tohave a sheet or sumthin' big and whiteto throw the pictures on to and itwould have to be tacked on to the wall.We have just had put down a brandnew carpet on the church and paperedthe walls, so we were afraid you wouldspill oil on the carpet or punch holes inthe new wall paper tacking up yoursheet. You see, we were afraid you'dhurt the church some way, so we moved you down here because you couldn'thurt the schoolhouse at all."The Boy Understood.One of the educational committee inLouisville had pinned on his buttonand went out onto the street for a paper. While the boy was counting outthe pennies in change he caught sight3f the white and blue button.

The curve had been made toreach a boom town which had laterbeen fire swept and then abandoned.The Widow Carter, relict of a farmer,lived on the line of the rejected cutoff. It must run between two lakeson her farm, and the isthmus -was -onlyseventy feet wide.There was not a doubt on the partof the railroad people that the widowwould sell the right of way for $100or so. One day a company lawyerpaid her a call. He was a man offifty, about the widow's age, and thetwo had not talked ten minutes bef eit developed that they used to go toschool together as children. -When itcame to speaking of the right of waythe lawyer treated it as a trifling matter. All other landowners on the lineliad granted it for nothing, but in Mrs.Carter's case they would pay $100 ifshe -would bind herself to keep quietabout it."I won't say either yes or no today,"she replied. "There's something 1want to remember about our schooldays some incident of importance thatyou were connected with I guess Ican think it up tonight, nd you cancome back tomorrow."The lawyer departed, thinking thewidow a bit odd in her ways, and hewas back in due time next day."Look here, Sam Davis," said Mrs.Carter as they were seated. "1 waspurty sure there was some incident,and it has come to me. You knowthere was a hill back of the schoolhouse at Wharton r""Yes." ""And we used to slide down on sledsand boards at recess and after school?""So we did.""One noon you asked me to ride onyour sled. Halfway down the hill itupset, and I lost a big cud of gum 1was chewing."The lawyer laughed and slapped hisleg, but the widow had a very seriousface as she went on:"And so your old railroad has gotto pay me a thousand dollars for theright of way. NI'm going to get evenfor that lost gum.""A hundred dollars is a big price,widow. It's land that you make nouse of.""But I may decide to make use ofit. 'No; the railroad can have it for athousand dollars, but not a cent less."It can condemn the land under thelaw, you understand, and in that caseit would get it for $10.""Well, let 'em go ahead."The railroad company didn't care togo ahead until it had exhausted othermeans. It would raise its figures, andit would send' other lawyers to her.t Meanwhile the widow consulted a lawyer in the village. He was a one horse:International$Atlanta, Ga..

If theowner asks an exorbitant figure thevalue is to be set by three adjacentlandowners. This law applied In thewidow's case, or soon would. She atonce ordered lumber to build a shantyon that isthmus, and within a weekshe was living in it.The railroad sent on another lawyer,who offered $200 for the right of way.Mrs. Carter was firm. Then anotherlawyer and $400. Mrs. Carter wasfirmer.Railroads often seize by force whatthey covet and then fight it out incourt The idea was to do it in thiscase. Mrs. Carter borrowed every shotgun for a mile around and was readyfor battle. She actually fired a chargeof bird shot that entered the legs ofthree trespassers and sent them howling. Then the railroad people got aminister from the village to go downand talk with the widow. He savedhis breath, even if he didn't earn hismoney. The moment she understoodhis errand she, said."Now, parson, you don't want to buttinto this. Your .business is to preachof goodness and heaven and angels.Mine is to beat the railroad. You goright back home and leave me to runthings here."Then the railroad offered S500."Just halt my figure!" was the woman's reply.Then they called for a commission ofthree to view and value. They werethroe farmers and were good friendsof- Mrs. Carter. They put the value at.$2,000. One o! their reasons was thatthe passing of trains would make thefish in the two lakes very nervous.Another was that the whistles of thelocomotives would prevent the widowfrom hearing her clock strike andmight set her roosters to crowing anhour ahead of time.When the award was made knownthe railroad company wanted to settle' for $1,500."1 don't want but a thousand." saidthe widow. "That has been my figgerright along.

Everyone who uses pills fortheir action on the liver, should know that largedoses rarely prove as satisfactory as small ones.Large doses simply purge and pass out of the system, usually leaving the bowels constipated, andseldom-.removing the cause of the trouble, or improve the general health. On the other hand,small doses develop the alterative effect of themedicine, do not irritate or constipate the bowels,but gently stimulate the liver and prevent theaccumulation of bile by directing its flow into theproper channels.

F. Massaner,which achieved such popularity in thiscountry when sung by Miss, Mary Gar-,den. ' jThe book is a magnicfient piece ofniciaiuic, auu uic upcia uaa manythings to relieve it of harsh criticismand much lhat is truly beautiful.Many thought the dramatization ofthe beautiful opera would be a thankless one, but Mr. Wilstach is a daringchap and Mr. Gaites is what is knownas "game," so the production wentforward and the outcome iswell knownfor after the first performance "Thais"was a distinct dramatic triumph,Few operas have been dramatized.Merimee wrote "Carmen" in 1845, butit was fif tv vears before anvone undertook a dramatization of the story for 'tns stage. In 1895 Miss Olga Nethersole comissioned Henry Hamilton, aBritish writer, to rrake such a versionfo" her use, and as all the world knowstoday it proved one of t.the most successful plays ever written by a modernauthor. Miss Nethersole, alone, hasplayed it over 1500itimes, and was thefirst actress to appear in the part inParis.talthoughit was 62 years aftertht novel was written, and it has beenjone of the most popular works in theentire repertory of French operas.I It may have been a recollection ofthis episode that stirred Mr. Wilstachto action with "Thais."As a usual thing, however, it is notcounted a good business lisk to dramatize themes that ar familiar with amusical accompaniment. But Mr.Gaites made arrangements with Massanut for the use of his score forentr'acte musice, so this latter is animportant feature of the dramatic"Thais.""Thais" is a story showing the anchorites of the ancient Theban desart.The piece takes its name from a beau-'tiful creature, as sinful as sne is beautiful There comes to her a hermitwho seeks to convert her from herwick d li'e. He preaches and prays andenoures the temptations that befelParsifal. Finally he yields but whenhe has come thoroughly under the influence of "Thais," and has lost hisoul, she suddenly awakens to the newlife, has heard his teachings and pleadirgs, and goes to the "White Sisters"on the African shore of the Mediterranean. Mr. Gaites, in addition to Miss Collier, has engaged Tyrone Power to appear in the part of the hermit. AndJulian L'Estrange to play the part otNicias, the favorite, lover."Thais" is produced with a wonderfully beautiful scenic Investure andwill te the treat of the theatrical season.

Snider, Leading Writeron Philosophical and Psychological Subjects, FinallyCompletes Long Task.St. Louis, Mo. Dr. Denton J. Snider, St. Louis savant, who has beenpronounced by eminent Americanand European critics the leading writer on philosophical and nsycholegicalsubjects, has just completed the finalwork in his system of universal psychology. The new book is entitled "The Biocosmos," and is an exposition of thelife of nature psychologically treated.Specifically it treats of the science ofbiology in its widest sense. In Dr.Snider's system this is the third "partrf nature, as the whole is conceived..Scientists and the world of letters'-V9 been following the progress ofDr. Snider's labors during manyyears, and his announcement that theentire work is completed Is one ofthe important literary items of theseason.In this tremendous work the dreamof the Greek philosopher Aristotle,and later that of Herbert Spencer, ofaccumulating all there was of definiteknowledge and weaving it into a vast,comprehensive system, to be a monument for future ages, has been realized by the St. Louisan.Aristotle accomplished what he setout to do, and in a measure Spencerwas successful, but in the system ofthe English thinker there are certaingaps, such as history and esthetics.These gaps are filled, and the progress in learning since Aristotle's timeis supplied in Dr. Snider's new system. The works of Dr. Snider numbermore than 36, but the essential onesincluded in his new science are 16.The entire subject is grouped underseven general heads: Organic psychology, psychology of philosophy,psychology of nature, psychology ofart, psychology of institutions, psychology of history and psychology ofbiography.For more than half a century Dr.Snider has been gathering the materials for and working upon his system. Most of his labors were performed in St. Louis, but in the courseof his investigations he visited foreign countries, where he was able tobring into play the dozen or morelanguages of which he is master.During the years of toil he was notthe absorbed, solitary scholar, such asFaust is represented, "buried in musty volumes and away from the "world."He has taught a large following ofstudents in classes that at times numbered well into the hundreds.These classes were unique and werethe beginnings of a sort of world'suniversity which Dr. Snider hopes willsurvive him and use the materials hehas created. In recent years theclasses, open to all, have been held inthe branch library buildings.Books were given to the studentswithout charge by their author, andthe talks and lessons were by Dr. Snider himself. Now there are a numberof classes conducted by former pupils,who have mastered the system..JBREAKS HER LEG ON A BOATWoman's Physician Happened to Beon Same Vessel and She IsGiven Quick Attention.Philadelphia.

Seeing her mother slip, the daughter, Cynthia Fries, made an Ineffectualeffort to save her 'from striking thedeck. By a remarkable coincidence,Mrs. Fries was treated for her injuries by Dr. William C. Barrett, whofor thirty-five years had been the family's regular practitioner, and whowas returning from Trenton on thesame boat, unconscious of the proximity of his friends.The aged woman had secured a goodseat on the upper deck as the vesselleft the landing. When they were inmidstream two attaches of the boatline asked her to move. As she arosefrom her seat Mrs. Fries lost her balance and fell to the deck. While Dr.Barrett was examining her injuries.which proved to- consist of a fracturedleg, Dr. R. B. Wolf of St. Timothy'shospital, improvised splints frompieces of wood lying near by.

O. O.F. Hall. For ssme reason they remained over a few days this week, boarding in the home of Geo. Clay, colored.Monday evening a dance was given,also a free entertainment by thetroupe. Ed Victor and Bud Miller gotinto an altercation which was thoughtto have been quieted by Johnson, oneof the troupe.but the trouble was soonrenewed, when at the conclusion of adance, Miller claims to have accidentally stepped on Victor's foot. At thisjuncture a scrap ensued and after somedifficulty Victor was ejected from thehouse, but returned later after lhavingprocured a grass hook from the backporch and was again ejected.The entire party thei went to thestreet and proceeded toward the footof the hill approaching town fightingall the way using rocks and other missiles.

As to the nature ofthese altercations we are unable toascertain. Miller admits that he boozed some while at Paris and it is claimed oy some present at the Clay ho'i,ethat Victor was also drinking.
