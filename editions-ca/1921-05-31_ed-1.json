Arrangements are being made by
a committee of'enthusiastic workers
from P. I. McCarthy Council, Knights
of Columbus, for a monster all-day
picnic to he given near Paris on
July 4. While the arrangements
are yet in the early stages, it is
safe to say that the picnic will, like
the previous one given under the au
spices of the Knights, be one of
many enjoyable features, and a win
ner from start to finish. Tentative
plans for -the big event are in the
hands of Jos. J. Grosche and assist
ants who are working with a good
will and". earnest purpose to make
the picnic one of the best of the
kind ever given in Paris.
Though the preparations have not
progressed to a point wnere mucu
publicity can be given, we have been
assured by Mr. Grosche that a pleas
ing program will be presented com
prising patriotic speeches by noted
orators, reading of the Declaration
of Independence, Music by the Boys
Band from the Odd Fellows' Home
at Lexington, a cake waiK ior tue
championship of the Bluegrass, and
other features to be decided on later.
Further" details of the big event
will be given publicity through the
