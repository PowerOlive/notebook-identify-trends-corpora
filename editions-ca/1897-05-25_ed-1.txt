towhat action the house may take on theCuban resolution passed by the senateFriday but it was understood thatSpeaker Reed would have a conference with the president on the subjectat an early day and no action wouldbe taken until after that conferenceThe inference was that the actionof the house managers would beguided to a large extent by the resultsof the conference It is probable thatsome attempt will be made on thepart of the democrats to have the resolution considered as soon as it reachesthe house but this can not be done except by unanimous consent which willnot be given or by a special orderfrom the committee on rules Thisspecial order will not be brought inuntil the republican leaders are readyfor actionSenator Davis chairman of the committee on foreign relations had a conference with the president by appointment Friday It is understood to havehad reference to the effect of thesenates action on the Morgan Cubanbelligerency resolution and upon thegeneral subject of the administrationsattitude towards CubaWashington May 22 The republican senators will hold a caucus Monday to consider the tariff bill Thefirst effort will be to devise plans toexpedite the consideration of the billand there will also be ail attempt toreconcile differences of opinion as tothe merits of some features Some ofthe schedules are objectionable tomany of the senators and it is thoughtadvisable to settle such differences incaucus rather than in the senateThe principal object of the caucushowever is to agree upon a plan forthe limitation of tha time for debateand under the present rules this canonly be done by mutual consent Whatthe tariff leaders will first attempt isto secure an agreement among republican senators to restrain any desirethey may have for general speechesand thus throw the responsibility fordelay upon the opposition So far asagreed upon the programme is to haveSenator Aldrich make his statement onMonday or Tuesday of next week andto follow this by immediately takingup the schedules and making no setspeeches on the republican side of thechamberThere are now indications that thedebate may not be so greatly prolonged as at first seemed probable Thedemocrats populists and silver republicans all aver that they will consume no unnecessary time withspeeches The democrats profess tobe especially anxious that there shouldbe no delay The democrats will alsohold a caucus soon to decide upon aline of action especially on the subjects of amendments A democraticmember of the finance committee expressed the opinion Thursday thata month would be sufficienttime for debate A number of woolcommission men from Philadelphiawere at the capitol Friday seeing members of the finance committee to securea revocation of the comjnitteejj actionin

Outline of What is Supposed to BeMcKinloys Scheme to Settle the CubanQuestionWashington May 22 The supplication made in both houses of congressThursda3 for further delay on the Cuban question to enable the president tocarry forward some supposed negotiations in the interest of Cuban independence has caused a searching inquiry to be made Friday asto the character of these negotiationsThe terms are reported to be as follows1 A formal submission by the Cubanleaders to Spanish authority upon theguarantee by the United States thatthis shall be followed by Spanishrecognition of Cuban independence2 That the Cuban republic shall assume the indebtness of Spain incurredduring the present and previous rebellions in Cuba and represented by theSpanish bonds issued for war loansCuban

the SenateThe Democratic Amendments Will BoIntroduced by Senator Vest The JVlorganCuban Resolutions Will NotBe Acted Upon This WeekWashington May 24 On Tuesdaynext ten weeks and a day afterthe beginning of the session the senate will take up the tariff bill for thepassage of which the session was especially called The bill was to havebeen called up- on Monday but thedeath of Senator Earle of South Carolina will render necessary an adjournment for a day Senator Aldrichwill call up the bill move its consideration and make a speech in its support The democratic amendmentstriking out the internal revenue features of the bill will be introduced bySenator VestAfter this the course of procedureis somewhat indefinite The democratsare not clear as to whether they willpermit the immediate taking up of theschedules or will demand an opportunity to make set speeches bearingupon the general policy of the billThe prevailing opinion among thedemocratic leaders is against the policyof general speeches at the beginningof the discussion but they will notattempt to restrain individual senators who may wish to beheard There are some democratic senators who are disposedto discuss the general features of thebill and who incline to the opinionthat the best time for such speeches iswhile the debate on the bill is youngSenator Vest does not expect to makea speech in representing the motion tostrike out the revenue features but themotion may lead to immediate debateand in case exception is taken to itthe Missouri senator will be heardfrom The silver republicans andpopulists will seek opportunityduring the pendency of thebill to present some remarks of a political nature and some of them maybe heard during the week The general sentiment among straight republicans is adverse to the encouragement of any general discussion of thebill or long speeches on schedules butno party policy has yet been decidedupon A caucus has been calledfor this purpose to be held Monday afternoon There will undoubtedly be strong opposition to someof the schedules on tbe part ofrepublican senators and amendmentswill be firmly pressed Some cf theseamendments will be offered to thechemical schedule the first of thelist and they will probably be reachedduring the present week Otherfeatures of the bill which republicansenators will attack are those affecting the sugar and wool duties andtaking hides from the free list SenatorPettigrews amendment against trustsis also certain to orove fruitful ofmuch general debate when reachedSenator Aldrich says he will notspeak to exceed an hour

belligerency of the Cuban insurgents which passed the senate onThursday will not be acted upon bythe house this week That is the decision of the republican leaders Theyhave decided to block the resolutionuntil the plans of the president whichare now maturing are formulatedThere will doubtless be a demand onthe part of the minority for immediate action but they are powerlessto secure consideration unless the rulescommittee will report a special orderThis the rules committee will not doThe majority will antagonize any attempt at consideration with a motionto adjourn until Thursday

made up his room andblacked his boots a company laundresswashed the very few7 items sent to hereach week and declared that the captain stopped the price of two pairs ofgloves out of her wages because shewore the thumb off one of them scrubbing-the dirt off the other He neverwent to theater opera or other diversion never took part in any of thegayeties of the garrison never subscribed for a newspaper or magazinebut was always on hand to get first lookat those service journals which wereIntended for the post library Hesmoked an old alack brier root pipewhich he charged with commissary plugtobacco preferring it to all others Hechewed tobacco navy plug and didnot care who knew it He shaved himself and when his hair needed trimmingit was done by the company barberHe had no bills He would be neitherborrowerhor well there was some talkabout his lending money on unimpeachable security and usurious interest butto those officers who applied either injest or earnest he said he never had acent to lend and wouldnt lend it if hehadThen what on earth did Close do withhis moneyMuch of this was told to Lambert inNew Orleans More of it he learnedlater On this particular day he wasdestined to have another peep into theIDeeuliarities of this most unusual characterHe had walked perhaps half a milerevolving these matters in his mindand keeping occasional lookout for Parmelees which was evidently furtheraway than he had been led to supposewhen he heard some one shouting afterhim It was a soldier running hardand in a moment Lambert recognized inhim the affable corporal who was thefirst to receive him that morning Thistime the corporal saluted as he camepanting to a halt Possibly SergtBurns had been giving the company apointerDid anybody pass you lieutenantanybody on horsebackNo answered Lambert wonderingwhat now might be coming-Well cap says er rather the captain wants you to come back Didntnobody go along here a horsebackAnd the corporal was evidently perplexed

was bustle and suppressed excitement Close was seatedat his tent smoking imperturbably andlistening to the tremulous words of atall sallow civilian who was leaningagainst the shoulder of a panting

explored thetwo rooms of the primitive buildingused as a jail and now came out to saythere was nobody there which feemedto tickle the fancy of the rallying populace Still the bell kept up its deafening clamor and Lambert was waxingboth nervous and indignant The absence of the civil officers of the lawthe deputy marshal or sheriffdered him practically powerless to actHe could not pitch into

awayThe next Sunday there was no opposition to Dans driving the bay mareto the Larkinsville church and MrsBiggs was really xroud of her boy asshe watched him drive away so sprucely dressed in his new clothes It wasnearly dark when he returned but noone questioned him and he made noexplanation as to what had detainedhimAnd so the summer passed away andSunday became Dans day olV Sometimes he would

COLONIESWlttkont Them Beekeeping Is Sure tBe a DisappointmentOne of the difficult things for thonovice in beekeeping to learn is thatten strong colonies will store morehoney than twenty weak ones Thereis an anxiety for large numbers andeach colony is counted one no matterhow feeble it may be So the inexperienced is often delighted a getting two three or even four o fiveswarms from a single colony notvrchstanding the fact that the last twor three swarms contain only a handful of bees They make sure to die before the winter is over and then he decides that he doesnt care for such veryweak colonies but still clings to thethought that one strong enough tolive tlirough it is all rightMany times however it is true economy to lessen the number even withthe view of having the largest number possible in the succeeding fallSuppose for instance there are fouiweak colonies in the spring each onehaving enough bees to fairly covertwo combs Unite two of them andleave the other two without unitingYou now have only three colonies instead of four and yet you may be better off for the one colony with beesto cover four combs will go right onincreasing in strength and by the timethe white clover harvest is fairly underway it will be strong enough to giveyou a rousing swarm and you willnow have two strong colonies for itwhile the two weaklings have only justbegun fairly to build up They stoodstill not showing any increase in number for a long time evidently needingall the strength they had to keep upexistence and make good the loss of thedying bees by the young bees raisedIf instead of trying to increase theeffort be to get all the possiblesupposing neither colony offers toswarm the difference is fully as noticeable if not more so The united colonywill have more bees than there are inboth the others It is easy to see thatit will store more surplus But if youvehad no experience in the matter it maybe hard for you to believe how muchmore Farmers UnionAN EXCELLENT PLANNesting

to write to her for advice in regard to theircomplaints and being a woman it was easy for her ailing sisters to pour intoher ears every detail of their sufferingIn this way she was able to do for them what the physicians were unableto do simply because she had the proper information to work upon andfrom the little group of women who sought her advice years ago a greatarmy of her fellow beings are to day constantly applying for advice and relief and the fact that more than one hundred thousand of them have beensuccessfully treated by Mrs Pinkham during the last year is indicative ofthe grand results which are produced by her unequaled experience andtrainingNo physician in the world has had such a training or has such an amountof information at hand to assist in the treatment of all kinds of female illsfrom the simplest local irritation to the most complicated diseases of the wombThis therefore is the reason why Mrs Pinkham in her laboratory atLynn Mass is able to do more for the ailing women of America than thef amily physician Any woman therefore is responsible for her own sufferingwho will not take the trouble to write to Mrs Pinkham for adviceThe testimonials which we are
