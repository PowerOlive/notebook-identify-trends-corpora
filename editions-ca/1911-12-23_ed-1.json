I he annual Christmas hop was given
by the young Men's Dancing Club
Thursday night. The gentlemen were
very much in veidence and were here
from all the surrounding towns, how
ever here were but few ladies pres
ent. It is claimed by some that this is
due to the fact that no special -effort
was put tortn by the home boys. The
music was furnished by the Wright
Saxophone Trio, of Colubmus, O.
While the number of couples was
small the dance in many respects was
one of the best ever given. Everybody
had plenty nf room and at no time was
the floor crowded. The following were
among the number of out of town
ladies present: Misses Etta Duchemin,
