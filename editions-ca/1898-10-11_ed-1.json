Vondefal Figure
One of the most marvelous workmen
in the world is Hauanuma Masakichi
of Tokyo who has carved a figure in
wood so like himself that when the two
are placed side by side it is said to be
almost impossible to tell which lives
and breathes and which does not
By several connoisseurs in art this
wooden figure has been pronounced the
most perfect and human image of man
ever made Masakichi has faithfully
reproduced every scar vein and wrinkle
to be seen on his own body The figure
is composed of 2000 pieces of wood
dovetailed and jointed with such won
derful skill that no seams can be de
tected
Tiny holes were drilled for the recep
tion of hairs and the wooden figure has
glass eyes and eyelashes in which no
dissimilarity to Masakichi sown can be
detected
The Japanese artist posed between
two mirrors while modeling this figure
and for some time after its completion
he posed frequently beside it to the
confusion of spectators who were often
entirely at a loss as to which was the
artist The figure stands with a little
mask in one hand and an instrument
for carving in the other The lifelike
eyes are apparently gazing at the mask
and the face wears a look of intense ab
sorption
The Opium Cannots
Well now can you from your ex
tensive experience give us your opinion
as to the state of Chinese opinion in re
gard to the opium habit looking at the
state of things not only among the
working classes but also the merchants
the literati the official classes and also
can you tell us what you saw during
your sojourn in the interior which
would give you an opportunity of form
ing an opinion as to how the Chinese
regard this question
As regards Chinese popular opinion
in respect to the opium habit it is de
cidedly against it There is a common
Cantonese saying which sums up rather
appositely the ten cannots with regard
to the opium sot It says First give
up the habit second enjoy sleep third
wait for his turn when sharing his pipe
with his friends fourth rise early
fifth be cured if sick sixth help rela
tions in need seventh enjoy wealth
eighth plan anything ninth get cred
it even when an old customer tenth
walk any long distance That 1 think
sums up the popular view of the Chi
nese with regard to the opium habit

How Galviu Caught Ward Nappinjj
There never was a pitcher in this
country who could excel old Jimmy
Galvin in catching base runners nap
ping said Jack Crooks I remember
seeing the old fellow catch the foxiest
base runners in the country asleep off
the bags with the quickest kind of a
motion There was one occasion when
Gavie played a star trick of this kind
on Johnny Ward The Pittsburgs were
playing the New Yorks and the score
was very close in favor of the former
The New Yorks had two men on bases
and Ward at the bat with two out
Galvin signaled to George Miller to step
to one side of the plate and deliberately
gave four balls to Ward Johnny trot
ted to first and the next instant Galvin
caught him napping big Beckley block
ing him off It was a put up job and
old Gavie didnt do a thing to Lawyer
Ward but laugh at him all the way to
the bench It was a feather in the old
mans cap for Ward at that time was
the star base runner of the League

The bill poster of Paris is a more
picturesque personage than his brother
of New York He plies his trade in all
winds and weather and he is nothing
daunted by the assignment of a bleak
suburban district on a rainy day
He ties his posters incased in a wa
terproof cover across his back He
fastens on his paste pot He mounts his
bicycle Then he opens his umbrella
for he is an expert wheelman and can
manage it and his wheel at once All
over the umbrella are advertisements
in little form of the article or the event
which he intends to advertise in large
by his posters so his entire route is
placarded and he himself is a living

HATING IN GEKMAN
THE SARCASMS OF A VICTIM WHO
SURVIVED ITS CHARMS
Be Kicks All the Way Down the Bill of
Fare and 13 Particularly Irritated Over
a Dish of Powdered Horse Iladish Served
With Frozen Whipped Cream
When you have examined the con
stitution of the German cuisine you
are tempted to grow loquacious You
are conscious of having discovered that
the psychology of a nation cannot be
constructed upon a mere analysis of its
made dishes Your estimate of Brillat
Savarin sinks He could not tell you
what you are even from all the menus
of your lifetime Freiligraths philo
sophic conclusion that man is what
he eats you straightway qualify as
true only when referring to cannibal
ism And you will aver that only in
the case of paleolithic man can you
construct a man from the crumbs that
fall from his dinner table And this
you will want to prove and conse
quently will grow talkative with pre
senting of much evidence
And yet in your sane moments you
will have a sneaking affection for the
statement that a German is a German
because he eats what he eats As a gen
eral rule he may be said to eat five
times a day But his hunger - is con
stantly being stilled
He starts early in the day with a cup
of cafe au lait and a small buttered
roll This keeps him going till 11
oclock when he demolishes a slice of
buttered rye bread spread with sHgos
of hard boiled egg raw chopped beef or
cheese This he washes down with a
glass of ale thus stilling his inner man
till dinner time Dinner takes place to
ward 1 oclock and consists of soup
generally nourishing a plate of meat
with potatoes and fruit cranberries
prunes or apricots occasionally cheese
seldom sweets rarely a green vegetable
Three hours later coffee is taken
served with a piece of cake or thick
bread and butter This is the hour pre
cious to the gossip and the busybody
the time for spreading scandal Toward
8 oclock the appetite again asserts
itself The hour of the ubiquitous sau
sages has arrived Their name is legion
and they share the honors with slices
of ham smoked gonse breast pieces of
raw pickled hterring and in summer
hard boiled eggs and potato salad
Such is the German method of spread
ing the meals over the day Of course
there are exceptions Many families
have two ample meals a day but the
bulk of the population eats mostly but
tered bread and snacks In justice to
Germany one must say that the fare in
many a home will compare favorably
with that of many an American family
In the German restaurant the cuisine
is on the whole monotonous and the
food singularly insipid All meats seem
to have the same flavor all are served
with the same heavy viscous sauces
and invariably escorted with the same
soaplike potatoes Stodginess and
ness are the great blots on the German
fare The element of variety too seems
considered superfluous
In the concrete the subject is almost
too painful to face the difficulty being
to steer clear of exclamations denoting
positive offeusiveness Some of the
kickshaws which figure regularly upon
the German table are reputed to be most
sustaining They certainly are intense
ly and ostentatiously wonder inspiring
One preparation is everywhere met
with under the name more or less pho
netically spelled of beefsteak a la tar
tare Its basis is raw chopped beef
this spread out into a pat of elliptical
shape is crowned with the raw yolktif
an egg raw finely chopped onion iis
sprinkled over it a garniture of gher
kins is added and the whole is eaten
with much gusto and no worse conse
quences than a durable thirst
In many of the dishes you discover
all the humor feeling and imagination
of a Wagnerian composition You find
the resolute desire to build up harmony
upon discord Of this nature may 6e
considered the traditional menu of New
Years eve carp pancake and punch
These three brought into immediate
juxtaposition and consumed in plethoric
quantities generally have the desired
effect that of inducing a hysterical
good humor Z
For stodginess nothing beats the fa
vorite dish panache It consists -of
pickled pork sour cabbage and a puree
of split peas boiled down to the con
sistency of stiff dough Experiments on
this mass produce deplorable capers and
cause one to grunt mournfully A va
riety of this diet is found in Berlin
You substitute boiled balls of dough
and indifferent prunes for the peas and
cabbage and you have the dish popu
larly termed the Silesian kingdom of
heaven Cold eels imbedded ina
transhicid glutinous substance figiire
in all workmens taverns while roast
goose is de rigueur for all solemnities
A dainty which we have recently
met with in Berlin recalled Darwins
remark that hardly any experiment is
so absurd as not to be worth trying
It consisted of finely powdered horse
radish served up with frozen whipped
cream
One may sum up ones judgment by
saying of German cooking what the art
critic said of nature It has infinite
potentialities Not the least of these
is its ambition to discover victims that
survive its charms onlv in the fnrm
that the walls of Jericho survived the
trumpet blast of Joshua LippinootVs
