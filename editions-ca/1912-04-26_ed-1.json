of the following, from Mr. John W

Directors of the Blue Grass Fair Associa

which was confined in the smaller barns
around the main building. It looked at
one time as though some of the other
barns would burn, and a number of
mules were turned loose. The building
destroye.1 was censtrusted by a JMr.
Davies, of Paris, and wos equipped with
machinery for the manufacture of whisk-.
About the time the war closed the price
of whisky took a tumble and as Mr.
Davis was a large dealer his embarass

necessary for him to make an assign

was controlled a number of years by the
late George White, of Paris, but was
never operated as a distillery. After the
death oi White the property was
again sold and was purchased by Them s
McClintock & Sons. The building was
arranged for a stock barn, for which it
had been used ever since. A few years
ago the firm of Thomas McClintock &
Sons dissolved, and it was purchased by
J. J. Peed aud W. G. McClintock, ex
tensive dealers in mules. The building
was insured for $2,000. Origin of the

Base Ball Season Close at Hand.
Local interest is centered on the
ooening of the base ball season in this
city next Wednesday when the Blue
Grass League championshiD season is
launch with the jcame 3witb the Win
chester Hustlers. Although Paris has
been in the leatrue three seasons in the
past this is the first season that the
opening game in the championship
series has been scheduled for the local
grounds, and the season will have a
very auspacious opening if the weather
man will permit.
It is the plan of the local Tmanage
ment to celebrate the occasion with a
grand parade, which wH be headed by
the High School band and march to the
ball park. In the past it ihas been
the established rule to close all of the
stores between two o'clock in the
afternoon until five to allow the clerks
and business men to attend the game,
and it is the opinion that the rule will
be followed' this season, especially so
as the Paris team plays its first game
at home.
Mayor J. T. Hinton will in all prob
ability throw the first ball, and deliver
a short speech. In all the occasion at
this date bids fair to be very successful
from every point of view, apd the Paris
management will exert itself with this
object in view.
The local team which has been at
practice for the past three weeks, is
making much progress and'imnroving
daily. The men should be in grand
shape to Dattle with the Hustlers in
the opener, as the practice games in
which they have played have helped
them wonderfully, and from the fact
they have not lost a single one, look
pretty good on the face.
Tomorrow afternoon the locals will
meet the strong Heidleburg team from
Cincinnati and also Sunday afternoon,
at White Park. The Paris management
haj placed .on sale at the, drug store fo
Varden & Sons the box Beats for the
opening game.
