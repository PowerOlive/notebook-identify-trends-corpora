pri "VVednesday morning by a number
of ''citizens and notified that he must
'discontinue business here, as he was"
conducting- an undesirable house..

"home on Vimont street late Tuesday
afternoon, having died sometime
Monday night. On Monday he was
seen on the street apparently in good
health. His neighbors had not seen

terjj,oon they became alarmed about
him. His house was found locked.
An entrance, however, was made,
and,., on entering his room, he was
found on Tiis bed lying on his left
side. He seems to have died without
a struggle. Heart failure was
thought to be the trouble. He was

him. He was interred in the colored
cemetery Wednesday morning.

There was little demonstration.
There was no public Christinas trftes,
but a number of private trees in the
homes. The little folks were all
made happy, and, an the whole, it
was the happiest Christmas ever ex
perienced here. The merchants all
enjoyed a large business, this, too, in
view of the fact that the "flu" ban
had .just" been lifted. Had it not
beeji for that the merchants would
have sold out clean. As soon as it
wsa known that the war had closed
tlie Chrispias spirit took possession
of everyone, and everybody bought
liberally. ..There were a number of
Christmas dinners and family re

THE APPEAL OP THE GARDEN
ARMY.
The United States School Garden
Arpny .gives an opportunity for a more
effective appeal to the patriotism of
American youth than is possible
through any local organization act
ing alone, even though it be State
wide in. its scope. Tying up the gar
dening activities of the schools to the
Garden Army established and foster
ed by the President of the United
States has given the work a dignity
and. importance which would have
been impossible under any other
plan. This fact is shown by the ex
perience of many supervisors and
teachers who have had experiences
similar to that of Miss aiaoei j.
Weeks, of Waltham, Mass., who sends
this hopeful note:
"I can't help telling you just what
a great thing this army organization
has been and is to the children. Re
cently 600 or 700 of my soldiers had
a. splendid parade. It was long, and
yet the entire distance they marched
like true soldiers. My officers are
helping me. with garden inspection,
-the' captains reporting at stated in
tervals. It has not only developed &
jjense of responsibility, but their
whole attitude has changed, for each
and every one seems to feel that he
fa,,aua$eolute need to 'Uncle Sfn.'
I - "amd know yoa must be re
eiiriftg the same sort of word from
mmy other places?'
PEED PATTON.

Peed, the handsome and vivacious

parents, on South Main street, at five
o'clock, Wednesday afternoon. The

WHAT A JATHEE SAID TO EDWIN
MAEEHAM
Here's a poejauu-you should, ruad
yourself, ask your wife to read it,
learn it and teach, it to the chidren.
It was written by Bishop Janies D.
Hughes of -the M. E. Church, Pasa
dena,' Cal. - .
Greater significance is given to his
lines because of the fact that Dr.
Hughes' son was killed in action and
lies buried "somewhere" in France.
MarkhanVs Question.
"0 mother, will you longer give;! your
sones . -
To feed the awful nunger of the
guns?
What is the sworthwof all these battle
drums . "H
If from the fields the loved one n6ver
comes? v
V3iat all these loud Hossanna tp the
brav) ' s-k
If all your share is some forgotten
grave?
The Bishou's noem is as follows! -J
The Unselfish Mother's Answer.
"God gave my son in trust to mje;
Christ died for him, and he should be
A man for Christ. He Is his own.
And God's and (man's, not mine alone.
He was not mine to give; He gave
Himself that he might help save
All that a Christian should revere,
All that enlightened men held dear.
All to feed the guns? O,torpid soul.
Awake and see life as a whole,
When freedom, honor, justice right
Were threatened by the despot's
might.
With heart aflame and soul alight
He bravely went for God to fight
Against base savages whose prid
The laws of God and man defied i
He did nQ$.go to feed the guns
He went to save from ruthless Huns
His home and country, and to be
A guardian of democracy.
'What if he does not come?' you say;
Ah, well, my sky would be (more gray
But through the clouds the sun would
shine,
And vital memories be mine. ,
'God's test of manhood is, I know
Not 'will he come?' but 'did he go?'
My son well knew that he might die,
And yet he went, "with purpose high,
To fight for peace, and overthrew
The plans of Christ's relentless' foe.
He dreaded not the battlefield
He went to make fierce vandals yield.
If he comes not again to me
Ishall be sad; but not that he
Went like a man a hero true
His part unselfishly to do.
My heart will feel exultant pride
That for humanity he died.
'Forgotten grave.' This selfish plea
Awakens no response in me,
For, though his grave I )may not see,
My boy will ne'er forgotten be,
My real son can never die;
'Tis but his body that may lie "
In foreign land, and I shall keep
Remembrance fond forever, deep
Withfn my heart of my true son.
Because of triumphs that he wdn.
It matters not where anyone
May lie and sleep when work is done.
It matters not where some men liye;
If my dear son his life must give.
Hosauna I will sing -for him,
E'en though (my eyes with tears be
dim,
And when the war is over when
His gallant comrades conie again,
I'll cheer theni as they're marching
by,
Rejoicing that they did not die.
And when his vacant place I see,
My heart will bound with, joy that he
Was mine so long my fair young
son
And cheer for him whose work is
' done." ,
