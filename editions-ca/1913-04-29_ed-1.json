29-3t S. E. BRUCE.
For the past six weeks a movement
- Tbas been on foot to organize a loose
leaf warehouse company in Millers
burg. The idea Was conceived some
months ago by Mr. M. P. Collier who
lias in a quiet, though successful
way, prosecuted it from that time un
til now. Mr. Collier largely through
his own efforts had secured stock to
the amount of $7,300, in shares of $100
each. On Saturday afternoon he called
a mass meeting of citizens for the pur
pose of discussing the adisabiliry of
such a warehouse and to devise ways
and mean of procuring stock. The
rneetincr was far more successful than
air. Collier or any one else had antici
pated, notwithstanding the fact that it
rained almost the entire day of Satur
day a large crowd of representative
citizens were at the City Hall at three
o'clock, Mi. Collier actingjas chairman
of the meeting, stated the purpose
and at once much enthusiasm was
'manifested. Short addresses were
''made by Messrs. W. D. Mclntyre, W.S
Judy, J.C. Leer, E. C. Hawkins. Col.
W. ZM. Layson and others. Messrs.
!McIutyre and Judy who have had large
-experience on the" loose leaf market
were asked a number of questions, and
xojall they replied that a loose leai
market would be a good thing for Mil
M
5rj
f
jf a
lersburg ; that the farmers graw the
best tobacco, the largest amount to
the acre, and that buyers would be
sent to procure it. There being a sur
plus of warehouses throughout this
section, naturally some were sketpic.
This however, was dispelled when Mr.
Leer, said that if they would build a
$12.000ahouse and loose leaf proved a
failure that he would rent the same
from them at 6 per cent, on their in
vestment. The enterprise took a new
life, and considerable stock was sub
scribed at once After an earnest ad
dress by Mr. Collier, calling attention
to what this would do for Millersburg
and surrounding country and the em
ployment it would give to labor, the
money that would be saved at home
which now goes elsewhere, a motion
was made by Mr. Mclntvre to appoint
Messrs. M. P. Collier, S. M. Allen and
J. C. Leer a committee to solicit stock
during the week.
There is no longer any question as
to the building of the warehouse. It
can be erected for about $1,200, and
more than that amount will probahly
be raised in the next few days. There
will be a meeing of stockholders in the
near future.
Mr. Henley Houston visited rela
vties at Carlisle Saturday and Sunday.
Mr. Clarence McCarty arrived from
Lexington yesterday with his automo

Miss Bernice Wimberley a recital in
violin Saturday evening, Miss Alma
Duke Jones her graduation recital in
Diano Thursday evening, May 15,
which will practically open the com
mencement exerises of M. F. C. All
of these recitals will be given at the
Chapel and the public is cordially in
vited. Miss Helen Asbury gave her gradu
ation recital in expression at the M. F.
C. chapel Friday evening. Notwith
standin the inclement weather, she was
greeted with a great audience. The
program was peculiarly good inasmuch
as it was the departure fromthe aver
age. Miss Asbury gave a complete
story of the three carts entitled, "The
Littlest Rebel," instead of miscellane
ous selections. Her work was well ex
ecuted, and the musical prorgam was
exceedingly appropriate. The first
part was made up of a medley of
Southern airs, on violin and piano by
Misses Jones and Kimberley. "The sec
ond was a duet, songs from the South-'
land by Misses Maris aDd Norn's, and
the third was a quartet of three violins
and piano. All of these selections as
sisted Miss Asbury in carrying out the
true thought of her story as the scpne
-was laid in the Southland.

Committee Ordered to Close
Contract.
With a view of closing the"contract
for the amusement features for the
Bourbon Fair next; September, the
Board of Directorstheld a v meeting at
the court house Saturday morning,
and directed the Amusement Com
mittee to close a contract with the
Krause Carnival Company for the
week of the fair.
The Amusement Committee will
take the matter up with the company
at once and thev hope to have the con
tract in hand within the next week.
The Krause Carnival Co., it will be
remembered gave an exhibition in this
city last fall under the auspices of the
local Maccsbee Tent, and the fact that
it gave such general satisfaction, as
to the class of attractions furnished, it
was deemed advisable to secure it or
another company of equal merit.
Secretary John Wiggins has been in
communication with the company, the
management of which has (.expressed a
great willingness to play a return date
here, and thinking, perhaps, the good
imnression'created on the'former visit
would be quite a drawing card, an
effort will be made to secure the con
tract withuut furtberfdelay and before
the rcuto has been made for the com
ing season.
President Joseph M. Hall presided
at the meeting held Satuidav, with
Secretary Wiggins and the following
Board of Directors present: J. M.
Ward, Geo. Stuart, W. G. Talbott,
Duncan. Bell, tGeo. Rassenfoss, s John'
T. Collins, Geo. Speakes, A. P. Adair,
A. S. Thompson, and S. G. Clay.
$An order was entered instructing the
Amusement Committee to dispose of
the dining room privileges 'and Secre
tary Wiggins and John T. Collins were
appointed a committee to ascertain
who will qualify an act as director
from the FlataRock precinct.

' phan's Home.
Custody of Carey Holton Hamilton,
the 10-year-old son of H. H. Hamilton,
oE Bouibon county, over whom litiga
tion has been going on in the Bourbon
courts for months, was awarded to the
Widows' and Orphans' Home at Louis
ville by the Court of Appeals at Frank
fort, but the Bourbon Circuit Court
was held to have erred in setting 8side
a previous decree whereby Frank P.
Bedford, a wealthy farmer of thiB
county had adopted the child so that it
could inherit his estate.
The history ot the case shows that
the child's mother died when he was
two years old, and the father not be
ing in condition to provide for him,
gave him absolutely to the Widows'
and Orphans' Home. Thje latter two
years laterjby contract, gave the child
to Bedford 'and Bedford conceived a
deepvaffection for the boy, finally by
court proceedings adopted him as his
heir; but the father was not made a
party to the proceeding, so r o attempt
was made in the decree to award Bed
ford parental, control.
In the mean time H. H. Hamilton
married again and being in better cir-
i cumBtances secured a writ of habeas
corpus in the Bourbon County Court
awarding him possession of the child.
Then Bedford, Hamilton, the child,
by his guardian ad litem, and the
home engaged in litigtion for custody
of the child. The father having con
tended that Bedford was not Ja proper
person to have control of hia son, .the
Vidows' and Orphans' Home aakedthe
court, if the 'fact was estab'ished, to
give the boy back to it.
The Court of Apnsals said the chan
cellor has wide latitude in such mat
ters, and should consider only the wel
fare of the1nfant. The court consid
ered the Widows' and Orphans' Home
the best custodian ; but insofar as the
Bourbon Circuit Court had rcoked the
dceree making the child Bedford's heir
it was reversed.
