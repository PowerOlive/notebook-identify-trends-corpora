Clay by County pierk Pearce Paton,
of Pans. Mr. Clay represented Boui-
bon ctiunty in the U10 and 1912 ses
sions of the LgislaCureandthe measure
which was introduced during the first
vear in office, was defeated. At the
tast session of the,-Legislature the
measure Iwas again defeated and
through his efforts and thp efforts of
I'M?. J. Qiucry Ward, of Paris, who
was appointed by Governor McCreary
as the tiead of the commission, its pas
sage was secured, and the bill became
a law.
, Mr. Ward was in Ppris Sunday and
stated he had outlined the work of the
Game and Fish Commission and gave
out the following statement: .
' "Game protection in the United
States has developed along somewhat
broader lines than in other countnes.
Its object is not only to preserve a few
animals and birds to furnish sport foi
a limited class, but to protect the in
crease useful species for the benefit of
the people in general.
"The personale of the, new Game
and Fish Commission guarantees a
faithful and efficient enforcement ot
the laws of the state, which are de
signed to preserve not onlv the game
naimals and game birds, but also
birds of song and plumage and those
which are benafttiil as destroyers of
injurious insects and noxious weeds.
While securing the support of the
sportsmen, it benefits the la.mer bv
increasing the species which are useful
to him and commands the interest of
that ever-increasing class of persons
who find health or recreationjin observ
ing or-iStudying nature.
"With Jthe development of legisla
tion for tne protection of fish and game
has occurred another development in
tended to afford greater protection tc
land owners and tenants. This legis
lation tootc the form cf penalties incor
porated in the game laws for certain
"forms of trespass an3 vandalism The
land owner had, and still retains prac
t:callv complete control ot the game
on his premises, since he can to a cer
tain extent fix the conditions undei
which it shall be taken and has abso
lute right to say Whether or not it
shall be hunted at all, but the facili
ties for enforcing his desire were of
such a personal character that he hesi
tated taking the vigorous action neces
sary to gee results. Now, however,
with the inauguration of the State De
partment for the protection of game
and fish, with a svstem of wardens
throughout the state, whose sworn
duty is to enforce the laws, the activi
ties of those wardens in each county,
the policy of publicity and education
of the department and the interest of
the true sportsman and law abiding
citizen who takes out his license; the
enforcement of trespass laws become a
matter of course, the riuhts ot prop
erty owners is established alike in the
mind ot the careless ci izen, the
thoughtless friend and the vicious law
breaker. "That the game on the farm has a
money value is not always recognized,
or, if so. seldom receives due conside;
ation. Rabbits, quail and other game
taken duiing the open season, afford
not only an irapoitant additiun to the

penditure for other, meat. The value
of this game. is, therefore, not merely
the amount it would, bring in cash or
in provisions at the country store, but
rather what it saves in the cost of
other meats. This economic result,
this increased food supply is of certain
benefit to the whole state and makes
the work of the commission in enforc
ing the same and fish laws of sreat
DUblicJnterest and worthy of every
man's'supnort.
"Now as regards fish. You will
notice that ours is a Game and Fish
Commission and our duties and pur
poses embrace the care and propaga
tion of fish as well as game, and as a
matter of "fact the fisherman will reap
the benefits of its activities along
with the man with uh aud dog, and
while the law,does not require a license
to fish the good spgrtsman and jjublic
apirited angler should, anu doubtless
will, contribute to the game and fish
protection fund by taking out a license.
-- "The last legislature made a hand
some appropriation lor tne putcnase of
lanu.adioining the Stale Fair for the
purpose" of estalisning a hatchet y which
wilj be operated oy the United States
Government, in the propagation of
fish for distribution and educational
purposes of pxhili ion. The stocking
of streams and caring for the propaga
tion of fish is a work whicn. tt.anks to
the facilities offered from the depart
ment at Washington, can be taken up
right away, and already this depart
ment is in cemmumcation with the
Fisheries Commistion looking to the
shipment into the state, fur distribu
tion under our supervision, of a large
consignment for stocking purpses.
"The laws of the state piohibit, Jand
providepenalties for, the-use of wing
net, gill or trammel net or other con
trivance for purpose of. catching fish
or hindering ihe passage of fish in run
ning streamer of the use of drugs, or
other substances whereby fibh are sick
ened, intoxicated or killed, or the water
polluted or rendered unfit for use. It
is unlawful to use dynamite or other
explosive agent with intent to injure
or catch fish, and if there is any one
thing that will claim the attention of
the commission in its activiries ifr will
be the apprehension and vigorus prose
cution of the uynamiter who ruthless
ly destroys thousands of small hsu by
this barbarous method."
