BOURBON EISHERMAN MAKES A
BIG CATCH. ' '
This is, ot course, the proper sea
son of the year for fish stories, and
not a few tales of miraculous catches
of the finny tribes have been handed
around. One of the largest of thu
tribe we have seen was brought to
this clfice yesterday by George Wil
liams Clay.
- The fish, a tikie channel catfish,
weighing eight pounds, was caught
with hook and line in -the big pond
on the Thomas Henry Clay farm,
near Paris, by George Bramel.
Bramel had an exciting experience
in landing the big fellow, and came
real losing h'"s tackle in the effort
to land it. The fish completely filled
j a large dishpan, with no room to
snaie. A few years ago about six
hundred fish of this species were
placed in the Clay pond, but the one
bi ought in yesterday is so far "the
king of all."

KENTUCKY HORSEMEN ATTACK
ANTI-RACING BILL.
Kentucky horsemen took an active
part in opposing the passage of the
Simms-Sterling bill, introduced in
both Houses ot Congress to prohibit
the transmission between States of
neavs of horseracing. Representa
tives of the Thoroughbred Horse As
sociation, the American Recount
Association and the Kentucky Jock
ey Club wre present, as well a
lepresentative horse breeders "of
other States and newspaper pub
lishers, all joining in protest
against the bill.
A. J. Carroll, of Louisville, coun
sel for the Kentucky Jockey Club,,
was the principal speaker hefore
the House Committee on Interstate
and Foreign Commerce. He said .the
bill was an entering wedge intended
to' eventually destroy racing in such
States as now lecognize it as a legit
imate sport. He declared that it
violated the freedom of the press;
that it is contrary to the doctrine
of' State rights; that it means the
end of horse breeding, as well as rac
ing, and that it is intended to be the
forerunner of other forma of sump
tuary legislation.
A. B. Hancock, of Paris, vfce-pres-ident
of the American Remount As
sociation and a director of the
Thoroughbred Horse Association,
said the passage of the pending bili
would probably prove a fatal blow
to horse breeding. He showed the
effect it would have on the army by
aserting that 95 per cent, of the
horses used in the United States
cavalry are thoroughbreds, "and that
breeding would be destroyed by the
passage of the bill.
Maurice Galvin, of the Kentucky
Jockey Club, declared that poolroom
gamblingon horse racing can be
broken up without federal aid by
means of State legislation, as has
been done in Covington.
Desha Breckinridge, editor of The
Lexington Herald, filed with the
committee a letter stating that the
passage of the bill "would be, in my
judgment, a blunder so great as td
amount to a crime," that it would
be disastrous to the great horse
breeding industry of Kentucky and
lhat there is -no more justification
for its passage than for the passage
of a bill nrohibiting the transmis
sion of news of stock exchange
transactions:
Kentucky Congressmen who lent
their presence in opposition to the
measure were Messrs. Ogden, Rouse.
Cantrill, Swope a-nd Barclay, the
latter a member of the committee
which is considering the bill.
