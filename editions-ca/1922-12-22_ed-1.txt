And if its symbolism is explained to them and they are madeto see how the story of the birth ofJesus is really the source of alltheir happiness, Christmas will notbe merely a day of enjoyment butan influence in shaping andstrengthening character. To thegrown-up who instructs the childquite as much as to the child who isinstructed the retelling of theChristmas story and the endeavor tomake its appeal vivid and personalwill probably bring some additionof grace if not of strength for facing life's immediate problems.In emphasizing the religiouscharacter of Christmas it is important that we should realize andmake clear what the character ofLour religion is. Because Christianity is the religion of friendliness,of cheerfulness, of happiness, andnot a religion of gloom and asceticism, we should make the day dedicated to the founding of Christianity one of good cheer. In recognition of the ajppropriateness of suchobservance we give presents and seethat the Christmas feast is gay andjolly. We bring our families andfriends together and renew ourcommon interests and the bonds ofour hospitality warm and cordial;if we are guests, we enter into thespirit of the house in which we areentertained, fThere is still another thoughtabout our religion that should be inour minds on Christmas Day. Because Christianity is the religion, offriendship and cheerfulness, it isthe religion of workT The religionsof meditation and contemplationhave never produced the spirit offriendship, the spirit that gave riseto the greeting, "Merry Christmas!"In celebrating Christmas let us findin the sympathy, affection, andcheerfulness that flow out to us astimulus to better work and greateraccomplishment.On Christmas Day we think of theabsent a special intensity of longing. For many people the spirit ofcheerfulness has a hard fight tcsmake on that day. Memories ofother and happier Christmas arisememories of dear ones who noloiger can join in the merrymaking. But they whose presence gavea radiance to past Chrictmas Dayswould not wish their absence tothrow a gloom over Christmas tocome. They would say. if theycould. "Let this be your special effort to keep the children and theguests from seeing what you seethe vacant chair in shadow beforethe Christmas fire."EMBROIDERED HANDKERCHIEFS" .

VARIETY TO SELECHRISTMAS GIFTS JROMWith only a few days le,ft beforeChristmas, the subject of appropriate Chrisfirias gifts in' naturajly uppermost in the minds of near everyrParis citizen. Already the tide ofChristmas shopping is heavy, and tomorrow, Saturday, being always agood day for the; country people,Paris merchants are anticipating aheavy trade.The stores and store windows,which since Thanksgiving, haveworn festive clothes, are now displaying a most striking variety ofholiday wares. From a tour of thestores it would seem there is not anarticle useful or ornamental, fromautomobiles and fur coats, to themerest trifles displayed on the counters of the department stores, buthave their separate claims to beingthe ideal Christmas present.The problem of gift ' selectionswill be one of too much variety inthe choice of gifts, limited only bythe size of one's purse, the generosity of the giver, and his or her relation to the recipient. And don'tforget that the live merchants arethose who advertise in THE NEWSwhat they have for the Christmastrade.CHRISTMAS PRESENTSNECKTIES WILL MAKE A NICEAND USEFUL CHRISTMAS PRESENT. (It) S?
