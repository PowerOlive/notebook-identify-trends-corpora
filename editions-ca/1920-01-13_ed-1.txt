President Wilson's decision that theLeague of Nations issue should bedplaced before the voters as a solemnreferendum, and William J. Bryan'scontention that the Democraticparty cannot go before the countryon the question, but should acceptsuch compromises "as may be possible," are the twin surprises of theconclave of party chieftains whichfound its climax in the annualJackson dinner Thursday night.The President's message to theparty, written from the sick room inthe White House, and read to thediners, made no mention of a thirdterm for himself, and no announcement of an impending retirement toprivate life, as (many had predictedit would.Mr. Bryan's speech, taking definite issue with the President's decision-on the great question was accompanied by a statement that hewas not speaking as a candidate forthe Presidential nomination. Manyof the Democratic diners freely saidthat poition was a distinct surpriseto them.To-day the rank and file of theDemocratic party as well as theleaders throughout the country arestudying the opposite announcements of the two national leadersand are attempting to gauge theireffect on the party's foi tunes at thenominating convention .which willbe held in San Francisco, June 28,and at the polls next November."DANDERINE" PUTSBEAUTY IN HAIRGirls!

TheDemocratic National Convention of1920 will be in San Francisco andwill open at 12 o'clock noon Monday,June 28.In selecting San Francisco to bethe city to entertain the next Democratic National Convention the Democratic National Committee hasset a political precedent, as it willbe the first national convention ofeither party to be called west of theRocky Mountains.-There was a lively contest betweenChicago, Kansas City and San Francisco for the honor, of entertainingthe convention. On the first ballotit developed that San Francisco hadconsiderably greater strength thaneither Chicago or Kansas City, and aunanimous decision in favor of SanFrancisco soon was reached.San Francisco made by far themost attractive financial offer. Itoffered a pledge of $125,000 to theDemocratic National Committee anda further pledge to obtain $50,000 tobe an entertainment fund.Its 'delegation demonstrated thatno city outside of New York or Chicago could offer hotel accommodations comparable with those of SanFrancisco. The delegation also showed that San Francisco was able tohouse the convention in the finestauditorium on the continent, the giftof the Panama-Pacific InternationalExpositionAccording to members of the committee the pleas of the women' aidedin winning for San Francisco. MissMary E. Foy, of California, eloquently pleaded that the Democratic National Committee owed it to the women of the -West to send the convention to San Francisco. She said thatthe women of the West had won thevictory for the Democratic party in1916. They were the pioneers in thewoman suffrage movement, she said,and now that the example of theWestern States in giving the franchise to women had been followed byso many states it would be a gracious compliment to them and politically profitable to. the Democrats to recognize the great work which they haddone, both in bringing about womansuffrage in the United States and inaiding Democratic success.BREAKSAilNJUSTAFEW HOURS"Pape's Cold Compound" InstantlyRelieves Stuffiness andDistress ,Don't stay stuffed -up!
