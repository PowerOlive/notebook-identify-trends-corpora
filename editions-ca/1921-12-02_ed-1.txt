This year thereis a policy.Formerly a great deal was saidabout the severe pressure 'broughton store clerks and mail and expressemployes by "the habit of buyingChristmas presents during the briefperiod before the holidays, and thensending them all in a heap. It is amost inhuman and preposterouspractice, and all that has been saidpreviously applies now.vThis year, if people would startright in to-day and buy their Christmas stuff, it would do a lot to helptrade. Many factories are still running on short time. If the merchantscould by the first of December cleanup -a good share of their holidaytrade, it. would enable them to goahead and buy new stuff. Thiswould set to work a lot of peoplewho otherwise would be idle or employed only on part time, and wouldhelp them get through the hardtimes of winter.There is bound to be more activityin trade after Christmas anyway.The big holiday rush always turnsa lot of goods into money and permits renewed buying and sends athrill of energy into the work ofmanufacturing production all overthe "country.Now the question arises whetherthe country will get that new impulse of activity in January as-theresult of a big clean-up of goods inDecember? Or can it come in December, as the result of a big cleanup of goods in November. If a lot ofpeople who have been finding faultwith poor business would simply getbusy and buy now. the things theywill buy anyway, it would produce abig busirfess revival at once andbring prosperous times one monthnearer. Any merchant in Pariswould tell you that a rush of buyingin November would permit him toplace new orders for stuff a monthearlier than he otherwise would.BOUBBON NUBSEBIES.

Cross.These disasters caused p45perty- damage estimated at $30,000,000, affectedlixty-seven communities and rendered65,000 families homeless.. The year's disasters were of varying types, including several which previously had never been thought ofas railing witmn mat ciassinca-tion. The Red Cross furnishedrelief in seventeen fires of magnitude,five floods, seven tornadoes or cyclones, one devastating Btorm, threeexplosions, including the one in ; Wall"street; one building y accident,' twotyphoid epidemics the most serious being that at Salem, Ohio, Y?hlcli affected 9 per cent of the population;one smallpox epidemic, in the republicof Haiti ; one train wreck, the race riotat Tulsa, Okla.; the famine in China,''emergency relief in famine among theIndians of Alaska, the grasshopperplague In North Dakota and an earthquake in Italy.Pusbto Most SeriousBy far the most severe of the disasters in the United States during theperiod covered by the "Red Cross report was the Pueblo flood early inJune, 1921. The rehabilitation problem confronting the Red Cross inPueblofiras one of the most difficultin recent years. When the first news,of the horror was flashed throughoutthe country, the American Red CrossNational Headquarters responded withn grant of 105,000 for relief work.Governor Shoup of Colorado, appreciating the long and successful experience of the Red Cross In organizingdisaster relief work, placed j the entire responsibility for the administration of relief in its hands.In response to appeals from President Harding, Governor Shoup andother governors of western states andthrough local chapters of the RedCross and other community organizations, public-spirited citizens broughtthe total contributed for Pueblo's re;"habilitation to more than $325,000.The terrible havoc wrought by thes flood waters is a matter of record.More than 2,300 homes were affectedand 7,351 persons were left homeless.Estimates of $500,000 as an absoluteminimum for rehabilitation were madeby Red Cross officials In charge of therelief work.Fast Work In Wall StreetThe Wall street explosion was notable In that relief workers of the RedCross were on the scene twenty minutes after the disaster occurred. Therace riot at Tulsa also was unique Indisaster relief annals In that outsideof a small emergency relief fund contributed by the Red Cross, the onlyrelief measures outside the city consisted of the service of social workers, nurses and a trained executivewhose object was to assist local forcesin directing their own efforts.In decided contrast with the previous year, only one tornado assumedthe proportions of a major disaster.This occurred on April 15, in the border sections of Texas and Arkansaswith the city of Texarkana as thecenter. The significant feature of thisdisaster relief work was the fact thatit covered so much rural territory asto make necessary a large number ofrelief workers.The famine In China, necessitatingrelief expenditures totalling more than$1,000,000 by the American Red Crosswas by far the most serious of the"foreign disasters In which the RedCross gave aid.Builds Up Its MachineryIn connection with the administration of disaster relief measures, an increasing effectiveness on the part ofthe Red Cross to deal with emergencies was manifested during the pastyear. In 328 Chapters of the American Red Cross there have been formedspecial committees to survey the resources of their respective communities and to be prepared in case ofdisaster. In others of the 3,402 activeChapters, a network of communicationhas been formed through which instantaneous relief may be dispatched toany part of the United States.That its work in this field may becontinued with ever greater effectiveness, the American Red Cross Is appealing for widespread renewal ofmembership during its Annual RollCall, to be conducted this year fromNovember 11 to 24.ITTIN'G about their camp-fires on Christmas eve, 300years ago, the Pilgrims on'shore" lieard "a rcrV in thewoods and jumped to theirfeet, expecting a sudden onrush ofrhooping Indians.

Plastering the cake to the paper helps to keep it in position. Foldthe rest of the paper neatly around thecake and slip under it a piece of cardboard or thin board the exact size ofthe cake.

Mr. President, will .the Senator from Georgia yield?Mr. Watson, of Georgia. Withpleasure.Mr. Stanley. Aside from the merits of this controversy, I wish to callto the attention of the Senator fromGeorgia another phase of the subject he is now discussing. Whatthe Senator from Georgia is pleasedIto call the Prussianizing of thearmy is, after all, but an incidentin the Prussianizing of America.'The trouble is that in the army andout, in Congress and out, in theSenate and out, in the field and inthe factory, in civil and militarylife, we are drifting perilously, pathetically away from the most precious heritage of the Saxon race theindependence, the dignity, yea, andthe sancity of a mere man for a that.Those in power, clothed with somepetty authority, forget that withoutauthority, without shoulder straps inwar, without a police baton or starin peace,man is the noblest work ofGod, not a little lower but muchhigher than the angels in Heaven.That spirit permeated our civil lifeand military life for 1,000 years.That spirit permeated every armythat was ever raised in England orIreland or Scotland or Wales, fromthe Battle of Hastings to the Battleof Waterloo and beyond. That spirithas permeated the armies of theSouth to even a greater extent thanthe armies of the North, and in thisconnection I wish to give the Senatora simple illustration, which mightgo as a companion piece to what hehas said -The great John C. Breckinridge, ofKentucky, expelled by the Senate forhis loyalty to- the South, was Adonisin love, Mars in war, and Ulysses incounsel, framed in the rich prodigality o'f natureMr. Watson, of Georgia. And thehansomest man who ever rode ahorse.Mr. Stanley. The handsomestman gf his day; as brave as JuliusCaesar and as tender as a woman.He commanded the "Orphan" brigade, Mr. President, 7,000 men whomno man ever lived to lead into a second field of car nage or of glory. Theyleft all their leaders dead on thefield of fame. They closed all thegaps of the Army of Tennessee.My father went out with a hundred and more of them and cameback with "less than a dozen, and allbut two shot all to pieces. No moremartial men ever careered over afield of fame; not they of the LightBrigade at" Balaklava; not the OldGuard in the blood-stained pass ofOhain; never since men armed themselves to settle upon the reeking,reeling field of carnage and conquest, the mastery of nations; neversince they fought with wooden clubsuntil the day of 'poison gas had anyman ever led gamer men than theyto glory or to death.On one occasion, a captain in the"Orphan" brigade commanded a private to sweep about his tent, and theprivate told him, if such language ispermissible in this 'distinguished,body, to go tQ liell; whereheshouldhave sent him for such a command.The captain sent the man to theguardhouse, and somebody reportedthe incident to Breckinridge. Andthen the great rebel chieftain got onhis horse and rode down, to that captain's tent, whipping his horse withhis slouch hat, and said, "Sir, I understand you have ordered a privateto sweep about your tent, and he hasrefused, and you sent m him to theguardhouse." The captain answered,"I did, sir," and Gen. Breckinridgereplied, "I .want you to understandthat when a private refuses to voluntarily sweep out my tent I will do itmyself. They are not menials in the'Orphan' brigade. They are all gentlemen, and you have, no right tocommand one of them to do menialservice. Now you go to the guardhouse and apologize to the soldieryou have insulted and sweep aboutyour own tent, or you will take hisplace."That was the spirit that makesevery survivor of the Lost Causeready to-day to fight for the honorof his superior "officer, and mjikhimregard the membory of the ead Lee.Jaekson, jJohnson aad :Breck"iaHdgecra mmK'viflK( maif Jtne-5' "? .r. tT At- rin '- - 4"Ji "tr-i.-Vitt- $&?Jmother.

The recent- announcement by Dr. P. S. Haley, local,surgeon, that he has photographed theto eric double of a man's thumb,which had been, cut off at the Joint,3i8 aroused an interesting scientificdiscussion.Scientists say Doctor Haley's experhrot raises the question of whether mMi possesses within himself dormant energy to reproduce parts ofhimself, such as an arm or leg, when2ie loses them.Doctor Haley does not profess thathis experiment proves such a theory,but declares that he believes he hasprovided the basis for far-reachingbiological research.Likewise he insists his experimentin no wise is of a "spiritualistic" nature. ."My own contribution is simply to-show by photography that crystallza--tionof energy exists. Scientists may-go much further and possibly in timedemonstrate that such crystallizationof energy may be made permanent instead of momentary, such as myythotographs show," Doctor Haleysld."Likewise it may prove that 'ghostsnre not supernatural, but simply a-natural and material compound of externalized energy. It is certain thatome animals see things not visibleto human eyes. Likewise certain persons are psychically sensitive tothinjrs which others are not. There Is-a great field for investigation openedby my experiment."Thumb Off; Felt Pain.Doctor Haley's subject In his interesting test waB a woodworker whohad lost his thumb. The woodworker'believed himself conscious to painwhen a plnwas inserted where thethumb once was. For the experiment'the stump was placed on highly sensitized paper In a photographic solution. Four impressions were takenranging In time from one-half to aminute and a half."My theory is that the etheric double remains attached to the member,and, under influence of will power andwith the aid of other factor possiblynot understood, the body energy radiates from the point where the stumpis, filling in the etheric double, saidDoctor Haley. Illustrating with one ofthe photographs."In such an event as the photographs show the etheric double actsis a 'blue print,' " continued the doctor. "Externalizatlon of energy is aTact that has been known for yearsmid which fact I took into consideration In my work.Holds Discovery Valuable."This sort of work may throw lighton many of the biological problems,.such as heredity, and should have anapplication on medicine. The experiment is not exactly along my line ofwoik, and it Is my intention to turnwhat facts I have over to the University of California or the CaliforniaAcademy of Science for further consideration, If they care for them."The value of my discovery will beta possible diagnostic factor in neurology and a contribution to biological"IcnowJedge, I believe," said DoctorHaley, when aked what his findingsmight be ued for."The 'etheric double' is not spiritualistic, but, as I say, biological and,uiided by the power of the human bodyand psychic mechanism effects on the'body, it may be applied to medicine.It is my firm belief that a system ofjraedlcal 'diagnosis may eventually beTounded on the theory," the doctorconcluded.Doctor Haley said he had beenworking on his latest experiment but-one month.Finds Her Beau Is a Girl.New York.

Thenumerous pearly white berries covering the mistletoe all winter attractthe birds. When a bird eats a cherryhe swallows the meat and drops thepit, but the seed of the mistletoe issticky arfd clings to the bird's bill. Theonly way for the bird to rid himselfof the annoying seed Is to wipe It off.Tills he does, on some branch of thetree on which he happens to be atthe time. Later this seed sprouts, andnot finding earth, which its habitshave made it cease to want, it sinksIts roots into the bark of the tree andthere receives the richest nourishment. It keeps its leaves all winter,and when the oaks are bare Its waxy,pale-green leaves stand out prominently against the dull brown bark.Edwin Tarrise.The Real Spirit.Has the real Christmas spirit beenlaid upon its bier by a lot of oldfogies who have lived too long tosense the thrill of the holly and mistletoe; whose spectacles and whiskershave debarred them from entering thekingdom of pure delight where thechildren wander; and whose dyspepticspirits have been warped with acidbitterness until they can no longerflow with the sweet joy of Christmascheer?

The best, barometer Is ie public market and the auction sales at Saratoga last August showed that, despite the general prostration of business, well bred horses with individuality brought the bast averagein many years. The highest price of the season at Saratoga was $21,000 fortLe brother to The Porter. Several other were sold for more than $10,000each and a number of likely rooking colts and miiesJrought from $5,000to $7,000 each. The market generally was steady and unspotted, which is toy it was stable.The prices were based on the probable earning power of these coltsand fillies, and if organizations like the Kentucky Jockey Club did notoffer generous stakes and purses, it would noi be possible fcjv bi omarket their yeni lings advantageously. Neither would it have been possiblefor S. C. Hildretli to have paid $125,00 for the brother to Man o' War,f 150,000 for Iuchcape, or for Benjamin Block to have paid on a $75,000 valuation for the mighty Morvich, or for,, a lumber of others to have paid thelarge prices given for horses with capacity to hold their own in contests onthe turf.Tifteen years ago It was no uncommon thing in Kentucky for turfmento run their horses for $400 purses. This year the Kentucky Jlockey Clubdistributed in stakes and purses an average of $12,000 a day to tho turfmen ;co purse at Churchill Downs or Latonia was under $1,300, and many of thernreaching $1,400 and $1,500 each. In 1005 the Kentucky Dorby was worth$4,850. Since the existence of the Kentucky Jockey Club, which was organized three years ngo, the Kentucky Derby was worth in 1919 over $20,000;lu W20 over $30,000, and in 1021 the Kentucky Jockey Club added $50,000to the royal stake. All the other stakes on the rosier of the KentuckyJockey Club at Lexington, Churchill Downs and Latonia hav been proportionately increased.In the three years ef its existence the Kentucky Jockey Club has distributed to the turfmen $3,479,665, the greater part of which sum was paid Ucitizens of Kentucky wh own and breed race horses.Since the Kentucky Legislature in 1106 created the State Racing Conmission, we have had cleaner and better rating than ever before, and sinesthe organization of the Kentucky Jockey Club we have had an era of prosperity for breeders and turfmen unequalled In the turf history 'of this State.Here are the official figures for thepaj?r seventeen years, from 1905 to1G21, inclusive:1W5Total number of racing days.. 155Total amount of moneydistributed $420,350.00The liigliest purse given was $750and the lowest $300. and the averagewa a little more than $400 each.1906Total number of racingTotal amount of moneydays. .174distributed $517,800.00Purses averaged about $450 each.-1907 .Total number of racing days. .110Total amount of moneydistributed $362,350.00Purees a erased about $450 each.Total number of racing days. .111Total amount of moneydistributed $299,400.00Purses averaged about $450 each.7.1909Total number of racing days . .112Total amount of moneydistributed . ." $249,900.00Purses averaged about $450 each, although this year purses at Lexingtonran as low -as $250.1910Total number of racing days . .112Total amount of moneydistributed $316,550.00Lexington purses ran as low as $301),and the average for the whole circuitwas $4.j0 each.4911Total number of racing days . .116Total amount of moneydistributed $388,350.00Purses averaged about $500 each."1912Total number of racing days . .109Total. amount of money- distributed $347,200.00Turves averaged about $500 each,1913Total number of racing days . .108Total amount of moneydistributed $444,900.00N Purses averaged over $600 each.Voice Not Very Still.A New York youth arrested for kidraping a motor carsay hgtook itbecause he -did notTiave. street car'fare.
