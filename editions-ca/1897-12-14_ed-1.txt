legislation in the near future This contemplates the disposal of appropriationbills as fast as they are ready for consideration Aft er these the bankruptcybill will be given the first opportunityfor a hearing This measure will bexeported by Chairman Henderson oithe judiciary committee before theholiday recess but it will not be takennip by the house until after the recessIt is understood that Speaker Reed andthe committee on rules will be disposed to give this bill every advantagein the way of securing early time fordebateIt is equally well undevtood that forthe present there will hi no effort totake up financial legislation on theiloor of the house This is due mainlyto the fact that a strong impressionprevails among members of the housethat the committee on banking andcurrency will not be able to reconcilethe many conflicting interests insidoof the committeeAside from bankruptcy and appropriation bills some emergency measures such as that relating to Behringsea introduced by Mr Hitt will havea hearing as they involve questions oi Igeneral policy and are not likely tomeet with opposition With these exceptions the disposition of the houseleaders will be to keep radical

that the trachwas something like 200 feet short tothe miie and therefore the actual distance traveled was about 2014 milesMiller was 07 miles ahead of Kicethe second man and thus thelatter will have

Lampkinthoughtfully I cant make it out Dolyou think he did it for the fun of thethingNo Im sure he really meant toIceep his word said Hendricks andthat something suddenly caused him tohanire his

walk to and froLie down here said the doctoruTvelax your body and let me put youi o sleep This sort of thing will do noigood you wont be able to work toimorrowHendricks threw himself on thellounge but at the sound of footstepson the stairs sprang up expectantlyThank God he muttered Thedoor opened and a messenger boy inblue uniform entered and handed thedetective a letter It is from our mansaid Hendricks as he opened itDear Sir the letter said I did notwant to break faith with you this eveningthe straw as the saying is I hypnotizedWhidby and tried to make him committhe deed but failed My first intention wasto lay the crime on him but after I left thehouse I wrote the notes and scattered themabout town to keep the young man frombeing suspected I hated them both onefor stealing and the other for being theperson who would eventually get the benefit of the money but I could not let anothersuffer for a deed of mine If you come assoon as you get this to 567 Mott streetwhere I have a

anyone called to ask about itsince it was leftNo sir I have been in the officeever sinceThe conversation paused for a moment then the detective seemed to collect his thoughts with a start He gavethe

could please me more Itseems to me that you have been doingall the work I want to get into itibut I had to do it The truth is something 0 the wick and some of the tallowoccurred to me that I must

been directedAlong the street were several opiumdens dimly lighted and on the cornernot far away a man was selling hotsausages from a steaming vessel over acharcoal fireAs Hendricks and the doctor werealighting from the cab near the houseto which they were going a solitarypoliceman approached and was aboutto pass when Hendricks called to himThe detective introduced himself andtold the astonished fellow to stand inreadiness near the door of No 5G7 Thepoliceman consented evidently highlyflattered at being in the service of thefamous detectiveAs they went up the steps to the littlestoop Hendricks advised the policemanto pass on so as not to be noticed bywhoever opened the door Thedetectiverang There was a faint light shiningthrough the girimy transom over thedoor but no sound came from withinHendricks rang again and when theclanging of the bell had died away adoor beneath the stoop opened a chainrattled against an iron gate and a woman half clad and with hair disheveledcame out amidst a heap of garbage andash barrels and glared up at themWhat do ye want she asked crust-ay-We have an appointment with a M rFarleigh who has a room here I thinkHendricks repliedA purty timeo night for it snarledthe woman But I promised the gintleman to let ye in an so if yell waittill I come up Ill open the doorIn a minute she admitted themYe was to go up to his room the topfloor froat ye cant miss it I wouldgo up ahead o ye but Im that stiffWell get there all right Hendricksinterrupted passing her We wontbe long Would you mind leaving thedoor unlockedNot at all sir she replied The detective thanked her and went up thestairsfThe door of the room in the front ohvthe top floor was closed There was atransom over it but no light shonethrough Hendricks knocked and waited Then he put his hands on the latchAs he did so Dr Lampkin drew his revolverHendricks laughed grimly Put itup he muttered You wont needitThe door was not fastened Hendricks pushed it open and as he did sosome strips of cotton batting fell to thefloor from the side and the top Theroom was very dark The outside blindshad been closed and the curtains drawnso that no light came in from the streetbelow nor from the moon aboveThe detective struck a match and1 ghted the gas near the door The yellow glare filled the room and revealeda gruesome sight A bed stood in therighthand corner and on his side hisface to the windows lay the body of aman A 44 caliber old stjle pistol hadbeen tied to the back of a chair in sucha way that the muzzle was within threeinches of a dark hole in the mans templeOriginal idea was Hendricks firstobservation He pointed to a faint lineof ashes from the chair across the barefloor to the airhole of a little stove inthe fireplaceI cant understand it said DrLampkin stoopingto examine the ashesHendricks opened the door of thestoveI have never seen this method before he said reflectively The lineof ashes was made bv a fuse runninsrfrom the tube of the jistol to a candlein the stove See here are the remainsThe fuse was fastened in the end of thecandle he lit it closed the door of thestove to keep the light from disturbinghim and lay there waiting for it toburn down to the fuse and thus fire thepistol It must have been his intentionto have death come npon him while hewas asleepMy God what anidea exclaimedftwDr Lampkin I see He calculatedon a painless death by hypnotizing himself to sleepCan it be done asked HendricksHardly the doctor replied I dontthink the creature was ever born whocould in that way put himself to sleepwhile facing eternity especially aftercommitting a crime His consciencewould not allow it Dr Lampkin bentforward and made a close examinationof the dead mans features Poor fellow he said He evidently tried tosleep I think he wanted to be foundwith a smile on his face But he failedEven in death he shows the awful dreadhe must have had There is no doubtthat he mentally suffered Do youIcnow what a friend of mine is doingHe is making a study of the features ofthe dead for the purpose of scientifically proving to people who dont believein the immortality of the soul thatthere is a future life He says if onlyour sight were educated sufficiently wecould read on the faces of dead peopleexpressions that could not be put thereby mortal thought expressions thatare formed just as the awakened soulis leaving the body I agree with himthat it is a great field for study Heis an artist and has painted the strongest picture that I have ever seen It isthe living face of a man distorted bythe worst of human passions and by itsside is the same face after death wearing the spiritual expression I mentionedI hope Hendricks remarked with ashudder as he glanced at the deadmans features your friend would notargue that the horrible expressions onthe faces of some suicides would provethat that they have no chance youknowNot at all replied the doctor Hesays the soul is simply separated fromthe body so hastily that there is no timefor it to leave its real expression Butwe are certainly en a gruesome subjectI suppose Farleigh used the cotton batting to close up the chinks in the doorto deaden the sound of the pistolHendricks nodded lowered the gasand led his friend down to the streetHe hastily explained to the policemanwhat had happened and told him tostand guard at the place till he couldsummon the coronerI suppose you are going to notify thecoroner the first thing you do observed Dr Lampkin as they were entering a telegraph office on BroadwayHendricks took a blank from the deskand without replying hastily wrote amessage When he had finished it hehanded it to his friend with a heartysmileThats the first thing on the programme and I thank God that I am ableto do itMiss Annette Delmar ran the messageMurderer of Strong just suicided leaving complete confession Whidby shall bereleased to morrowLAMPKIN AND HENDRICKSWill it be so soon as that the doctor askedYes a telegraphic report from

Whidby said Hendricks There is nohurry about the other It wont takea coroners jury long to give a verdictwhen they read the confessionThe next day at 12 oclock Hendricks called at Dr Lampkins officeHe found the doctor aloneIts all right he exclaimed Ithought youd want to feel sure aboutit so Iranup The news has just reachedthe police here that everything is satisfactory Whidby is out by this timeHeres something you are interestedin He handed the doctor a telegramIt was as followsMinr 1 Hendricks and Dr LampkinNew YorkGod bless you both I never was so happy in my life Papa went with me to

UsedOf special interest to the exportingmerchants of the United States is thecompilation recently issued by thestate department of the weights andmeasures of foreign countries All theinformation given is valuable and someof it is decidedly curious Thus theword barrel in Spain used alonemeans 100 pounds of raisins but in sMalta it is the official custom term for114 gallonsThe word candy in India means 500pounds in Madras and 529 pounds inBombay In the Spanish language piemeans a measure equal to nine tenthsof the English foot On the other handa person calling f or a sho pronouncedshoe in Japan receives 1 6 10 quartsof somethingIn Germany the word last refers totwo metric tons or 4400 pounds English but in England it stands for 2bushels of dry malt Dun is Japanesefor one inch and li Chinese for 2115feetIn Palestine rottle means 6 poundsbut only 54 pounds in the neighboringcountry Syria Seer is Indian for1 pound and 13 ounces Salm isMaltese for 490 pounds and pundRussian for 36 poundsA catty in China Japan and Javameans 1 1 3 pounds but in Sumatra itmeans nearly twice that weight Theword coyau is Sarawak for 3 poundsand Siamese for 2y2 poundsThe Spanish word f anega has probably the most diversified meaning ofany in the list Standard Spanish dictionaries describe t as a common unitof dry measure nearly equivalent tothe English bushel and so in truth it litin Spain but in Chili it means 2ys bushels in Uruguay 388 bushels in Venezuela and Central America iys bushels In Colombia the word has for themost part retained its original meaningbut locally the usage varies thus onthe west coast a fanega of salt is 110pounds and in El Choco a fanega ofcorn is only 32 pounds Here it maybe parenthetically remarked that theSpanish language abounds in words ofa metaphorical meaning Thus fromfanega a bushel is derived fanegada a small farm and afanegadasabundance of plenty A farmer askedabout his crops would reply in casethe yield was abundant a fanegadasand it would be equally proper tosay of a man who had moneyto burn plata a fanegadasmeaning that he had bushels of moneyArroba is a measure of weightmeaning 32 1 3 pounds in Brazil and25 1 3 pounds throughout the rest ofSouth America Arshure is a Russian yard of 28 English inches MostEuropean countries have adopted themetric system and metres kilos andlitres are in common use but somequeer names of widely different meaning still linger in Denmark and SwedenFor example tonde in Denmarkmeans 394 bushels while tunnaSweden means 4 bushelsmAgaintondland in Denmark means 13Racres while tunnland in Swedenmeans 122 acres N Y SunFrom the Tennessee MountainsA young man and young lady werewalking hand-in-hand out Cedar streetwest of the capitol They seemed mentally disturbed about somethingdenly

leaders incolonial days committed his depredations along the Atlantic coast fromNewfoundland to Panama he took special delight in wreaking- vengeance uponthe crews and captains of New EnglandvesselsThe reason for this is found in theaccounts of his exploits by an old historian The sturdy colonists would notjjermit him to perform his outrageswithout some sort of retaliation Soformidable a foe did they send after thenoted pirate chief that more than onceihewas cornered and nearly capturedIn June 1723 Gapt Low formed apartnership with a successful pirate oflesser note known as Charles HarrisThe two united forces and directed theirenergies toward the New England coastThey soon aroused such indignation inthe New England coast towns that thewarship Greyhound was sent out afterthe pirate and disguised as a merchantman she soon fell in with the enemyThe war ship was manned with 20 gunsand 120 men When she sighted thepirates her captain pretended to be ingreat consternation and the vesselstood away for tw hanrs with thepirates close at her heelsWhen Low and Harris were in gunshot the war ship suddenly turnedaround and delivered several broadsidesinto the chasing vessels During theconflict which followed Capt Lowescaped on bis fleet vessel but Harrisand his crew were captured and hangednear Newport on July 10 1723This incident created a feeling- of relief and rejoicing throughout New England but it was of short duration Instead of being frightened away by thefate of his partner and his crew CaptXow increased his activity and scouredJibe seas after New England vesselsAt that time New England was sending-out large fleets of whaling boats andthe stUrdj innocent seamen of thesewere bothered by the pirates probablymore than any Mother class They corried verjr little merchandise that was ofany value to the pirates but out of asense of revenge Capt Low took specialdelight in destroying- the whaling vessels and in setting their crews adrift insmall boats or killing themMatters went on this way for a fewmonths when the noted pirate chiefeither became frightened at the numberof war ships searching for him or hefelt that he had been sufficiently revenged for the hanging of his partnerfor after the winter of 1723 there is norecord to show that he ever again visited the American coast His operationsthereafter were confined chiefly to theAfrican coast and among the Canariesand Cape Verde islandsBut one incident of his career amongthe New England whalers before he leftfor southern waters will illustrate thepluck and ingenuity of the sturdy seamen of that dayThe Carrie Bald of Boston sailedfrom that city manned with a crew of15 saiiors and after ten weeks of successful whaling she turned her prowtoward home loaded down with blubber and whale oil Her crew Avere in thebest of spirits anticipating large profitsfrom their cargo and a hearty welcomehome by their wives children and sweetheartsOn July 10 she sighted land whichproved to be a rocky headland on theMaine coast With this guide post telling the captain and crew that theywuiild be in Boston harbor in a fewdays everybody began to make preparations for landing Everything about thevessel was put ship shape and the oldsailors even got their belongings together and packed them in bags andold sailclothBut before Mount Desert islanduas sighted a sail was seen headingtoward the coast standing up from thesea like a great white cloud CaptBald of the Carrie grew auxious asihv sail approached nearer and displayed a flag at the mizzen mastheadwhich he could not make out One reason for his running so far inshore hadleen to escape the notice of any piratical oraft that might bi cruising upxml down the coast Most of the tradfciir vessels Flood well out from thearckv Mainr anureHalf an uf riiuer Capt Bald feltreaKabl sin v that the approaching Nailmeant mischief and that his whaler wasin imminent dangerWell run in a bit he remarkedtohis first mateLong familiarity with the New England coast now stood him in good service He ran his craft so close to theshore that it was dangerous for one notfamiliar with the channels to follow-Its no use captain the first matesaid after a long pause If thatsCapt Low he knows every inch of thiswater Hes better acquainted withthis coast than any other whaling cap-tain from Portland to New BedfordWell if it aint Ned Low well givehim a chase among these rocks that hewont forget very soon replied gruffCapt Bald pulling his long whiskersnervouslyIn a short time the black flag of thepirates indicated even to the crew whatmission the ship was bent on Therewas a short time of general fear whenstout hearts quaked and rugged facesturned pale Every sailor knew thecruelty of the pirate captain and hishorde of savagesThen Capt Bald called the crew together and addressed them in thesewordsWe may as well face this little difficulty bravely my men and not mincematters Thats Ned Lows ship andye know what hes after he nevershows mercy to anybody especiallyto a New Englander and wed betterdie fighting than be strung up to theyardarm or have our lips and nosescut off for a fry Weve got harpoonsand axes aboard and every one of yeknows how to use em So just getem and stick together and fight untilyere dead Just remember that itsbetter to be killed than to fall in theirhands Ill use my wits to get awayfrom them but if worst comes toworst we must fight Thats allThe stout words of the grim old whaling captain lent new courage to thecrew and they gave a little cheer thatmeant more than the loud huzzah of acrowd Every man felt that he wasabout to face death and he was determined to do it with a brave frontNearer and nearer approached thethreatening boat on whose decks blackswarms of armed men could now beseen A small swivel gun sent a ballricocheting across the waves towardthe whaling schooner but the lattercontinued to thread her way carefullyamong- the sunken rocksThe pirate craft when she reachedthe outlying fringe of rocks hove toand beat up and down like a duck uncertain which way to goIts dangerous water here if youdont know your way muttered CaptBald and I guess you dont know itHe was scanning the ship through hissea glassesAha Now Capt Low takes thewheel His pilot dont know the wayNow were in for itThere was a change noticeable onboard the pirate Then she directedher- course once more toward the rocksand plunged boldly between them following-the narrow tortuous channelCapt Bald watched her in silenceThen his light blue eyes shaded bythick shaggy eyebrows grew worriedA DENSE WREATH OF SMOKE COULDBE SEEN CURLING UPWARDand restless He scanned the sea andthe shore and then he returned hisgaze to the pirateWe cant lose them here he saidfinally to his first mate Theyll overhaul us before night and thenHe shuddered involuntarilyWe might run her aground and swimfor the shore he ejaculated finallyNo well run her up the river Thisis Machias Point and we might reachthe river ahead of emThis decision was no sooner madethan the order was given to changethe course of the schooner In half anhour she rounded the point and stoodin toward the mouth of the river Thepirate craft sent several solid shotsafter the old whaler but the aim waspoor and no particular damage wasdoneIt was late in the afternoon when theCarrie sailed up the mouth of the riveragainst a strong tide with the piratecraft less than a mile astern The coastat this point was bleak and deserted inthose days and it was almost as certain a death to laud and desert theship as to face the piratesStill well do it Capt Bald saidIts better to fall among the Indiansthan among these human -fiends Idrather be eaten by wolves than have mytongue and eyes gouged outThe pirates were so certain of theirprey now that their loud shouts ofuefiance could be distinctly heard by thewhaling crew Suddenly Capt Baldstarted and knowing that the best wayto keep his men brave was to find employment for them he gave ordersquicklyGet the whaleboats ready for action he shoutedThere were four of these two oneither side and each one was mannedwith a crew of three sailors and on offierr When the men had unlashedI shoutedz35F35SV3WTHE BOURBQN NEWS fCTJAY JDEGEMBEB 14 1897Form a vater buckefc brigade forAre in the holdThis strange order made some of themen hesitate but explicit obedience intheir captains words had become ahabit with themWhen the men were inline armed withtheir buckets Capt Bald went belowand in a few minutes the men were passing-the buckets from one to the otheremptying- their contents first intoonewhaleboat and then into another Butthere was no fire to fight and the menwere not handling water They weredipping the whale oil from the greattanks and hogsheads in the hold andpouring it into the small boatsEnough shouted the captainta little later Every man on deckThe novelty of the orders made themen now obey with alacrity and theyhad partly forgotten their danger intheir exertions But when they assembled on deck again and saw thepirate only a short distance off theirfaces paled once moreBut Capt Bald realized that the moment for action had come and he gavehis orders in quick sharp commandsLower the boats and tie them together with a rope 20 feet longHe fastened one of the lengths ofrope to the first boat himself and threwthe other end to the first mate Thepirates saw the launching of the fourwhaleboats and prepared to do the samewith their boats But they little reralized that the brave seamen were not-making-readyto escape to the shore butwere planning for their destructionI want four brave men who are willing to risk their live for the rest of usCapt Bald said in his usual abrupt wayWill they please step forwardInstead of four men every one of thecrew stepped forvrfardThats enough my brave men thecaptain said while his eyes grew moistIll select my menThen taking four of his most trustworthy sailors he gave them brief butemphatic directions what to do Thesailors nodded their heads and jumpedinto the boats each carrying a life-pre-preserverwith him The last words thecaptain said to them wereRemember the right bank Swimtoward it and Ill pick you upWhat could he mean The sailors onboard the Carrie asked this and thepirates must have been curious also toknow They stopped a moment in theiryelling and watched the peculiar proceedings of the men in the whaleboatThe four boats shot out from theCarrie and were rowed directly towardthe pirate the strong- current of theriver helping them in their speed Thepirates did not notice at first that eachboat was fastened by strong ropes toeach others prows They were too intent in watching the strange proceedings of this attack It might havedawned upon their obtuse minds thatpart of the crew of the Carrie had deserted or that they were coming toplead for mercyBut the four rowers were silent andactive When they were with in 50 yardsof the pirate thetnen threw away theiroars simultaneously and bent oversomething in the middle of their whaleboats There was a tiny spark of lighta flash and then a sudden upward blazeThe four brave men slipped over theside of their boats into the water anddisappeared But the flames which theyhad started burned furiously Thewhale oil in the bottom of the feoatsfurnished fuel that made a fire hardto extinguish The tide was carryingthe boats rapidly down the river towardthe pirate Then for the first time thepirates noticed that the boats were tiedtogether forming- a wide line stretching half across the riverInstantly there was commotion onboard the pirate ship In the confusioneverybody forgot the prey they had soneatly hemmed in the rayer The gunswere aimed at the approaching oil boatsof fire and one vas actually blown topieces but the oil floated on the waterand only spread the flamesIn a few minutes the fire boats struckthe pirate ship and the ropes holdingthem together drew the end boatsaround toward the ship in such a waythat flames were soon spreadingthrough the rigging and hull A fewbrave pirates climbed down and cutthe ropes but before they floated awaythe ship was a huge mass of flames andsmokeMeanwhile Capt Bald had not beenidle Just as Joon as his men droppedinto the water from the fire boats hecrowded on all sail and helped by thetide he went bowling down the riverclose up toward the right bankWhile the pirates were fighting thefire and trying to avert the doom oftheir ship Capt Bald was leisurely picking up the four brave sailors who hadcaused the mischiefNow well stand out to sea he saidand let era chase us againBut the last he saw of the pirates ashis schooner rounded the point of landat the mouth of the river was a cheering sight Most of them were seekingsafety in the water For more than twohours a dense wreath of smoke could beseen curling upward and as long as itwas visible Capt Bald chuckled softlyto himself on the forward deckWhat wouldnt Capt Low give tocatch

the changein temperature has chilled them so thatthey are -dormant and they huddle asclosely to the stem asipossible and willnot move unless they are stirred up-When we take the bunch downstairs tothe banana room where it is quitewarm they wake up and get livelyThey will not bite unless they are bothered or unless a man puts his hand onone of them accidentally Even thenthe bite is not dangerous because theskin of the average fruit handlers handIs so hard that the fang- will not pierceit But we had a man here who wasbitten cti the arm once and it swelledup much as a snake bite does Theonly thing to do is to give him the snakebite remedy fill him up with rum and hewill get over the bite all rightThe banana snakes are not especially dangerous They are long greensnakes about the size of

condiment is sogeneral and so universally believed inas necessary that we rarely hear a wordagainst its excessive use but there arc amultitude of persons who eat far toomuch salt eat it on everything onmeat fish potatoes melons in butteron tomatoes turnips and squash inbread and on a host of foods too numerous to mention To so great an extentis it used that no food is relished whichlias not a salty taste and this hidesmore or less the real taste which isoften very delicate Now the amountof salt required in the system is comparatively small and if the diet hasbeen rightly compounded very little isnecessary Some go so far as to discardits use altogether but whether this iswise or not we will not here considerWhat are some of the evils of the excessive use of salt They are to paralyzethe nerves of taste or to pervert them sothey cannot enjoy anything which hasnot a salty flavor and in addition thereis a direct tax on both the skin and thekidnejs in removing it from the bloodWhether the skin is harmed by thistaxwe do not know Possibly it is not greatly injured yet we know that few peoplepossess a healthy skin but it is nowpretty well settled that an excessive useof salt does overtax the kidneys in itsremoval and that the great number ofcases of derangement and disease ofthese organs is due to this vise It takesonly a little time to learn to enjoy manyKinds of food without salt and we advise our readers and others to look intothis matter and to try and diminish theuse of this condiment so far as possibleWe believe they will be better for itJournal of

indeed it can be so described is at least several centuriesold The whistling language is usedby the shepherd folk of Teneriffe andGomera and the first recorded noticeof it was made by a French traveler asfar back as 1455 Since then stray wanderers have called the worlds attention at long intervals to the language Some years ago while roamingthrough the mountain ranges of Teneriffe it fell to the writers lot to hearthe shepherds thus conversing Byplacing two or three fingers in themouth they contrived to make thewhistle carry to a distance of threemiles or thereabouts The lonely hillsseem silent and deserted when suddenly out of the far distance comes a longdrawn and very shrill whistle the summons to a conversation In reply a similar call strikes piercingly on the earfrom the opposite direction The whistlers are widely separated and perhapsare having some difficulty with theirflocks At any rate if you listen youwill soon hear them in the thick of alengthy conversation though thespeakers are three miles or moreapartLogeard the well known Frenchsavant has conclusively proved that thawhistling is in Spanish Easy wordaare taken and the sounds imitated bythe whistlers Long practice andheredity have naturally given the shepherds extraordinary skill and their vocabulary is now quite a long one whilein addition they have a regular code ofgraduated notes which convey telegraphically what they cannot satisfactorily reproduce in the ordinarymannerThe writer heard three parties ofshepherds exchange their hopes andfears regarding the weather by thismeans On another occasion he heardan invitation to a dance sent in thewhistling language across a stretchof country exceeding four miles inlength The young boys and even thegirls are adepts at the language andthe very sheep appear to understandwhistled commands at a considerabledistance In fact the whistling language dating as it does from before1455 makes one wonder whether thotelephone is such a modern marvel

should be tothoroughly pack and firmly unite everypart of the material used The onlyway to accomplish this is to roll every3ayer of dirt stone gravel or other material separately Before any of theetone is deposited the subsoil should bethoroughly hardened by rolling witha heavy roller A layer of stone if it is toproperly pack and form a hard roadi bed must have above all a solid foundation Stone deposited upon loosegravel on soft ground or in a bed ofmud can never be successfully packedeither with a roller or by travelSo too if it is intended to place a layerof gravel or smaller crushed stone orscreenings on the surface the layer ofcrushed stone beneath should first bethoroughly hardened and packed Itis a mistake to suppose that the twocan be packed and rolled togetherMaterial to be thus compacted must- -be uniform in character and size and-while the angular pieces of stone willshift about under the weight of theroller until they are all firmly wedgedin place round particles of gravel orsmaller pieces loose dirt or sandwhen mixed with these angular pieceswill prevent their being thus crowdedtogether and compactedThe above explanations are the result of a careful study of the instructions issued by the state highwaycommissions of Massachusetts California New Jersej and Connecticutand indicate the principles followed inthose states in the construction ofroads by state aid The same principlesare laid down in treatises upon macadam roads as built in PennsylvaniaAlabama New York North Carolinaand Ontario and they constitute thefundamental rules laid down by experienced road engineers all over theworldThe building of macadam roads offers opportunities for manifold mistakes and for an enormous waste ofpublic funds If ever it be true thatwhat is worth doing at all is worth doing well it is emphatically true in thebuilding of stone roads A macadamroad when once properly constructedneeds little repairing and lasts forgenerations as has been indisputably andrepeatedly proven in England and onthe European continent A stone roadpoorly built for want of -successfulrolling even with excellent materialis but a poor highway at best Manyso called macadam roads recently builttby inexperienced men or without thei proper use of good road rollers are continually going to pieces by the wearingof ruts and the subsequent combinedaction of water and travel Every goodmacadam road testifies to the value ofdurable highways while every stoneroad improperly built throws a shadowof doubt upon the movement for betterhighways Those who believe in goodroads

Well Protected andCaret For It PaysThere is always a demand for extragood milk We are in favor of sellingmilk when from five to eight cents perquart can be obtained In the suburbsthat is not a high price because the owner of milch cows have to pay high foiall the feed they buy It requires muchbran shorts and linseed meal to keepthe cows to their milk That s to saysuch cows as come fresh- in Decemberand succeeding months The shelrhas to be closely watched and the stallswell littered and water has to be tempered before giving it ti the cows orthey will not drink it We again remind our readers that it is not godpractice to wash the cows bags Itmakes the skin tender ind is apt tocrack the teats which by ve necessarymilking twice a day are hard to healup Now no sensible persoD will imagine that we oppose warm vvuter fora wash absolutely necessary but whena soft brush and a clean soft cloth cando the work I use no waterJersey cows -are not of the kind topour out a great qnantitj of milk for amess but most people of experienceknow that their milk is very rich containing ofttimes twice as much creamas that of ordinary stock hence theirmilk should bring an extra price because it is worth itMany people give larger rations thancommon so soon as tbey notice that thecow is springing bag For a youngcow liberal feeding may be allowed butthe older cows seldom develop largerudders nor is it desirable Our experience teaches that high feeding up tothe time of calving is very dangerousbecause it increases the parturitionfever more or less of which is always tobe expected Hence we counsel to withdraw the feed of the usual rations onethird and when the udder is much distended even more than that After 36or 48 hours if the cow is ready to eatcommence to increase the feed and ina few days thereafter you may give herall the feed she can assimilate and youwill find the flow of milk correspondingly increased Charles W Mlirtf eldtin St Louis RepublicDRYING VEGETABLESIn California It lias Become Quite ailImportant IndustryIn California the drying of vegetableshas developed into an important industry Potatoes carrots and othertubers are poured into the hoppers ofcutting machines where rotating bladesslice them a quarter of an inch thickThey are then slightly sulphured in awooden chamber If this process is overdone the vegetables will taste of thefumes if too little bacteria attractedby the starch will develop A little sulphuring is necessary to prevent decayand to preserve the color The tubersare now revolved for a few hours closeto a- hot pipe in an evaporator whichis a sort of Ferris wheel consisting of abrick oven with glass windows At theend of this time the potatoes are takenout in the form of dry chips It requires six or seven pounds of the freshto make one of the dried As bacteriado not take kindly to onions they areonly slightly sulphured It takes 20pounds of the fresh onions to make oneof dried they shrivel up so much Nineparts of fresh carrots are required tomake one of the dried The industry isproving very profitable as there is agreat demand for the dried fruit andvegetables in the country and at minesIf steam comes into use in the processtie starch in potatoes could be sterilizedaird partly cooked before they are evaporated In this way they would be ridof sulphur Chicago Inter OceanHANDY MILKING STOOLAlthough 3Iade ut Home It Has

we had in the garden were alwajs more liable to rot and to be affected by insects than the trees thatstood in dry places and surrounded bygrass It may be that it is the extramoisture in the cultivated soil that predisposes cherries to rot or it may be themanure annually applied to the gardenand to which the cherry tree rootshelped themselves freely The cherrytree does not do well with wet feetOn high dry land its roots will rundeeply enough to find all the moistureit needs and on such land in grass isthe best to plant cherries for profitablefruiting American CultivatorGood Season for
