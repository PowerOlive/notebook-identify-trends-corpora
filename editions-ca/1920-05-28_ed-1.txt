Thjdelegation was late in getting in,due to delays along the road. Theirreception here was .not a very enthusiastic one, not that the Parispeople have a grudge against theirneighbors, but because they weretoo busy taking care of their ownbusiness to wax enthusiastic over al-eighborly visit.The delegation arrived here fromCynthiana, being met at the citylimits by a reception committeecomposed of Mayor E. B. January,Councilman John J. Williams, JohnT. Collins, Ollie Marshall and E. M.Dickson. Their machines wereparked near the court house, and aparade formed, composed of the Lexington men, headed by the Stat-3University band, and accompaniedby the reception committee. Theparade marched up Main street, returning to the court house, where asmall crowd gathered. The welcomeaddress was made by E. M. Dicksan,who was intioduced by Councilman iWilliamsThp rpRnnnse was deliv-ered by Frank B. Jones, presidentof the Lexington Chamber of Commerce. Robert J. Breckinridge, ofLexington, delivered an eloquentaddress. A feature of the programwas the music rendered by the State iUniversity Band. The delegationrang a number of songs, and distributed souvenirs among the audience. Farewells were then said,and the motorcade left the city forGeorgetown, on the last lap of thehomeward journey.oALMOST ALL STUDENTS PASS.iIt developed that most of the students of the Eighth Grade in thecounty schools who recently tookthe examinations for promotion tothe High School work, passed successfully and there will be a numberof -new faces in the ranks of theHigh Schools when they convenelor the fall term.The teachers had been preparingthe students for the examinations,and this special work is given as thecause for the unusually large percentage passing. Most of those whofailed to successfully pass the examination were held out of study byillness and other causes. On theAvhole. the result of the examinations ha$ been very gracifying tothe Superintendent, and the teachers of the county schools.NOVELTY CREATIONS.Beautiful novelties in Jewelry,Diamonds, Beaded Bags, S Iverand Gold Wedding Gifts inSilver best and most popularpatterns.THE A.

Clubs have come and clubshave gone, and left behind themonly the record of things half-wayattempted. But now things are toassume a different turn, thanks tothe real live wires who have takenhold of the project.For some time the fate of a Commercial Club, already organizedhere has swung in the balance andits final disposition seemed a thing.for speculation. Now the futurelooms up rosily and the way seemsbrighter. At a meeting held at thecourt house in this city Tuesdaynight, eighteen energetic' businessmen of Paris took hold of affairs andresolved to make the CommercialClub a reality and a sticker. A B.Hancock, always foremost in allpublic spirited moves, presided overthe meeting, and Lawrence Pricewith his trusty pen, officiated assecretary. Mi. Hancock stated theobject of the meeting and the aimsof the progressive business men oL'Paris, and called for expressions ofopinion from the members as to thewisdom of continuing the Club inthe future. Short talks favoring thefuture of the Club and advocatingits continuance were made by I. L.Price, John T. Collins, H. A. Power,Lee Frice, N. Ford Brent, E. B.January and others. And everything they said had the true ling ofa desire to help Paris.Mr. Hancock appointed a committee composed of N. F. Brent, JohnT. Collins, and B. M. Renick, toappoint an organization committee.The committee named H. A. Power,I. L. Price, A. B. Hancock, Rudolph Da-is, and M. Peale Collierfor the purpose. Among otherthings to be considered by the Clubwill be the employment of a livewire as a business secretary, a manwho is not in any way connectedwith a faction or any disgruntledelement in Paris.Those present and taking part inthe meeting were A.

McGUIRE, Ph.GPhysicians, scientists .and medical men have labored for years inperfect laxatives and cathartics.Their efforts are represented by thenumerous preparations now on themarket. Yet, the main fault withall tiiese preparations lies in that,either they were too mild or too violent and drastic in their action andupset the system of the user. Thesemf-n tell us there is nothing newunder the sun, but they do admitthat the new combinations of nature's elements are bound to be discovered, in tiie same manner as newpieces of music.An eminent druggist set to workpome years ago, and, after carryingon extensive experiments with hundreds of different compounds, hasfinally produced a little tablet thatfills the long-needed want for thoseof us bothered with constipation,distressing indigestion and torpidliver. It is a new combination ofMother Nature's vegetable elements with Pepsin and Gingeradded. He has named his new discovery Pepsotone and is now placing the preparation in drug storeseverywhere, within reach of all. Itcomes in boxes of twenty-five tab-lets a month's supply, at the popular price of only twenty-five cents.A single Pepsotone tablet "takenat bed time with a swallow of water produces no griping, no distress, no sickening sensations.Next morning your liver is active,your entire digestive tract relievedand purified and you feel just finewith a hearty appetite for breakfast everything tastes good andagrees with you.Getting tiie bowels to functiondaily, b the Pepsotone treatment,an nature intended, the entire system is naturally invigorated.Blood circulates better, nerves become refreshed, dull eyes growbright and pale cheeks glow withthe bloom of perfect health. Sleeplessness, -nervousness, lack of energy, tired-worn-out feeling all heroine things of the past.Simply step in any drug storeanywhere, obtain a quarter's worthof Pepsotone tablets and beginthis very night to conquer constipation; increase your bodilystrength, youi neivq force, yourpowei of endarance and materiallyimprove your system, complexionand appearance.

C. Carpenter, 1905 Virginiaavenue, Huntington, West Virginia,bill clerk for the Huntington Lumber Supply Company, is still anotherwho has cause to be glad he was induced to give Tanlac, the "MasterMedicine," an honest trial."Talking about things that helppeople," said Mr. Carpenter lecently, "Tanlac has done me more goodthan anything else I ever got holdof. Before I took it I had been inthe worst kind of a fix for more thana year, but now I am just like arew made man."I had gotten in such bati shapeon account of stomach trouble, lossof appetite and poor digestion thatI was constantly losing time frommy work. My wife would fix up allkinds of good things trying to temptmy appetite, but after eating amouthful or two my stomach wouldrebel and I simply had to leave theiable without eating any moreWhat little I did manage to forcedown would sour, causing gas andsuch violent pains m my stomachthat I could hardly stand it. Somelimes I suffered so much agony thatI just felt like I could not live another hour. My tongue was coatedall the time, I had raging headaches and suftered so that everything seemed blurred to me, andwhile these spells were on me, andthey usually lasted for several minutes, I couldn't see. When not inpain I felt sluggish and drowsy andwanted to sleep, but my sleep wasunnatural and did not seem to restme."I was under treatment severaltimes, but no one seemed to understand my case and I kept gettingworse until there was hardly aminute night or day but what I wasin misery. I read a statement inthe paper describing a case likemine that TaiUac had relieved, butas I had always been prejudicedaginst all advertised medicines,I passed it up, believingthat it would not help me.But one day I wras talking with afriend who had taken Tanlac withfine results, and he told me if Itried it and it did not help me hewould refund my money out of hisown pocket. Well I bought a bottle and sure enough just as he toldme, I had not finished taking it before there was a marked impiovement in my condition. Then I gotanother bottle and now my stomachtrouble is gone entirely. Theheadaches have also left me and mysleep is natural,) sound and lestful.I am working regularly every daynow and feel just fine, but, honestly, I don't believe I would havegotten will if I had not taken Tanlac. I just want to give all thepraise, thanks and gratitude I canfind words to express to Tanlac andmy friend who persuaded me to tryit, and from now on I will neverdoubt anything good I read aboutTanlac." vTanlac is sold in Paris at the People's Pharmacy.
