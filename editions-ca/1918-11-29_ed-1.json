The money raised from the sale of this stock will continue to
be used, as -it has been used in the past, hi the development and
expansion of the company's properties. Over $325,000.00 of
capital raised from the sale of stock has been invested in prop
erties and equipment in the twelve months of the company's
existence. Its outstanding- position today as the leader men?
the independent oil companies operating' Ik Kentucky may be
ascribed to following this policy of expansion. Results accom
plished to date are but a forerunner of those which may be ex
pected to ensue from the further development of the company's
concededly valuable holdings, and expansion in the field of its
operations through increasing the size of its refining plant, now
operating, and the purchase of additional producing properties.
In view of progress to date "McCombs" stock at $2.00 per share
is an extremely attractive investment opportunity with the,
probabilities of unlimited enhancement in value.
