The article called attentionto the fact that so many pamperedmarried women (and single ones, aswell) waited until the last moment,and then strolled leisurely into astore at almost closing time, and detain the wearied clerks from ten minutes to half an hour.These shoppers liave no consideration whatever for the young peoplewho have stood patiently all day attending to the wants of the public,graciously and courteously showingand exploiting their wares, and always ready and anxious to pleaseeven the most fastidious tastes. 'It is only natural that as the hourof 5:30 rolls around, the salesladiesshould have tempting thoughts ofhome and warm suppers, possibly tothe movies, and then a refreshingnight's sleep. But as it is, on manyoccasions some haughty, spoiled andutterly selfish shopper comes intostore at the last minute, handles thegoods, with a bored air, asks forsamples and then finds -a millionfaults, and condescends to ask theclerk's advice as to this, that or theother color and material, until thatpatient young person is well-nighon the verge of collapse.Then it is no wonder when theclerk at last drags herself wearilyhome, she has lost appetite fjor hersupper, which has possibly growncold by the unwonted wait. She 'istoo tired to make herself attractiveenough to attend places of amusement, and thus, lacking any recreation, spends a restless night, andarises in the morning unfreshed forher day's work.The business hours for Paris storesafford plenty of time for shopping.Unless the customer can finish Jiershopping before five o'clock, or 5 "30,she should put it off until the nextmorning.

The active resumption of recruiting by thesea soldiers is expected speeany ioclear the decks of the recruitingoffices of all unissued medals. ' Theaid of the American Legion, -veteransof foreign wars-and the posts ofthe Army and Navy Union has alsobeen .enlisted for this purpose. Application to the nearest Marine CorpsRecruiting Office is all that is necessary, as the usual government redtape for the distribution of the -VictoryMedal has been eliminated bythe Marine Corps. Each recruitingoffice has been issued a complete listof all officers and men who served inthe war, and opposite each name isa record of all battle clasps andbther devices that go with the individual medal.Ex-Marines living in Indiana orKentucky who have not receivedtheir Victory Medal, win receivesame by writing or applying at theMarine Corps Recruiting v Station,157 North Illinois Street, Indianapolis, Indiana.o(Washington Star)There is a tree which because ofthe affectionate regard which oldfashioned folk have for it, is called"the old home tree." It is the blacklocust, which is also called, becauseof the, color of its wood, the yellowlocust. Nearly as far back as colonial records go in this part of thecountry it would seem that a mancould not sell us his home withoutsuriounding it with these trees.The practice continued at least aslate as the Civil War, but pincethen other trees have become thefashion. All around the old homestin the Potomac region grow thesevenerable trees, generally rougn,gnarled and storm-broken, and theyalso mark the site of many a housethat long ago passed from earth.One of the reasons so many of ourancestors chose this tree as their"home tree" is that bees revel inthe nectar of its flowers and love itnearly as dearly as they do the linden, or "the bee tree." Anotherreason was that they believe the!locust tree had the power of protecting a house from lightning,and another reason was that theybelieved that its shade was coolerthan that of any other tree.For RentHouse with garden.
