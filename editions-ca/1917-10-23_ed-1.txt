Of courseyou would that's one of the greattroubles with all of us. We wantthe sunny spots in the winter andthe. shady spots in the summer, andwe forget to think of the troublesand miseries of someone else justaround the corner. Sometimes weh'tfcome weary of this humdrumdaily existence and forget to whitewash our words, and then we speakas we think, and it does not soundvery good to the other fellow not tous, either, for the simple reason thatIt is only too true.;Now, if "we are overweary to-day,- and it the 'pen is dipped in the acidof observation and experience youwill at least have the consolationor knowing that we love you, thoughwe chastise you for your shortcomings. When we turn our horses and cattle out to graze we head them forthe spot where the grass is greenand the feed is wholesome. We arecareful of their welfare for they arean. asset, they are things of value,they represent more dollars to add toour bank rollsWhen the old hen come off the nestwith a brood of little 'chicks we bestir ourselves and guard them religiously from the -sharp fangs of the-hungry marauder. In this we emulate the example of the mother hen,and it is good to see and good to do.When the cat delivers to us a basket of fuzzy little kittens, helpless"in their blindness," we take theminto our homes, and fondle them,v and mother them, and give them awarm T)ed in back of the kitchen- Move for our hearts go out to thetender little things.And so. it is with every-thing ofiife -that-brings money, or recrea" tion or amusement into the home." w-egive them our care, our attention, our solicitude.

We see young boys runningwild and imbibing the vices of manhood, smoking, swearing, drinking,gambling, swaggering, using language too vile" for print. No, theyare not assets either. They are justsomebody's kids, -kids of somebodywho doesn't deserve kids. But they,too, are somebody's flesh and blood,and should be given the care thatwill make them, too, useful men andwomen.If the parents of these boys cannot see the hell of the future in storelor them if they continue their present course, isn't it possible for thecommunity at large to do somethingto save them? Are they, young humans, not as valuable in our sight asthe horse, the cow, the chick or thekitten? There are many lovingmothers and fathers in this community who can find a way, if theychoose. But will they? We makethis suggestion in a spirit of fairnessand humanity, that something practical and beneficial may be done for"somebody's kids." Will you do it?Our False Security.Nations are like individuals theyoften imagine themselves immunefrom danger right at the time whenthey are in the greatest jeopardy. Itis so with the United States to-day.There is a lull in' the German situation, Japan has had nothing to sayfor a few weeks, and Mexico appearsto be taking a siesta. Hence, without looking beneath the surface, wejump to the conclusion that "everything is fine and the dove is flirtingwith the American Eagle." But justbefore every disastrous storm thereis a lull, with scarcely a ripple onthe water, with not a leaf stirring.We appear to be indifferently sleeping in uch a lull to-day, giving noheed to the tempest that may beroaring to-morrow. - And in the endwe will pay the price of our folly.As To Universal Service. -A year ago only a handful of people could be found who were in favorof universal military " service. Nowthft man who ouDoses such serviceis the exception. Americans are essentially a fair minded people whenfacts are brought forcibly to tneirattention, and this fact has beenamply exemplified in the tremendouschange of national sentiment regarding universal service. Daily papersof the great cities assert that theprincipal objection to universal service comes from the rural districts.But the daily papers are wrong. Theyoung men of our community are ona par with those of other rural districts, and yet we unhesitatingly assert that no where in this broad landwill be found a more unified or patriotic sentiment than that which, exists in the hearts of our own youngmen. lf the best interests of thecountry demand that each one, richand poor alike, shall serve his sixmonths in a training camp, thenwhen the time comes we will findthem stepping briskly to the front,with heads erect and eyes upon theflag of freedom, There will be noshirking, or quibbling, or hanging"back on the part of our young men.And The Women, Too!The imminence of war for tinscountry has brought our women tothe front with a rush. Noble women! There never was anything onthis earth to compare with them.Hundreds of thousands of them in allparts of the country have announcedtheir readiness to serve their country in hospitals or anywhere elsetheir services may be utilized to advantage. It is like them, it is whatwe might expect of them, and it iswhat will happen when the crucialmoment arrives. There is no uncertainty as to the attitude of our wo-men.fe S 13BDESERVES A GOLD MEDAL TOETHIS.Cincinnati Authority Tells How toDry Up Any Corn or Callous SoJt Lifts Bight Off.You corn-pestered men and womenneed suffer no longer.

NAPIER,(4-tf) 12S Mam StreetTo The Public!The merchants of Paris recentlysigned agreements to cloae theirstores as follows; Grocery stores at7 p m. and Saturdays 11 p. m.Other lines of business at 5 p. m., excepting Saturdays. Some of our merchants are doing all they can to liveup to their agreement, while othersfind all kind of excuses to exteud thetime of closing. One of their mainexcuses has been that customers willdelay their purchases to the lastminute, and by entering stores at theclosing hour make it difficult formerchants to close their stores asagreed upon.The Merchants Protective Association of Bourbon County at its lastmeeting directed by an unanimousvote that the undersigned make .anurgent appeal to the public to kindlyassist the merchants by making alltheir purchases so as not 'to conflictwith this closing arrangement.There must be reason in allthings. A business or householdconducted without order and system.cannot bring complete success. Remember success does not mean moneyalone but also means "Happiness,Harmony and Good Health."The mechanic and ordinary daylaborer will not work over 10 or 8JiOurs per day. This you will agreeis exactly right. But why theneuhi.w expect - a jnsrcluuit towork from Is a." m'. to 10 or even 12p. m., or from 12 to l3 EoUW per4ay? -The merchant desires goo"d healthand wants to live as long as others.He wants to enjoy the company ofhis wife and children at eveningduring the week as well as only onSundays. Two .hours extra rest eachday means all this for him and betterservice for you on the next day. Nodoubt you believe this is right andare willing to grant him and hisclerks and porters this necessaryrest. Then why not help him to liveup to his pledge and make your purchases accordingly?To those merchants who" have sofar failed to close their stores aspromptly as they agreed, we appeal-again, "For the good of all, as wellsis. your own welfare, let us stand Tto-Igether and work like one man."To those merchants who ,so farhave failed to fall in line on theclosing agreement, we extend anearnest appeal to "Come and work to-'gether with us for a common cause,"and to the public we appeal for theirencouragement and co-operation inthis movement, because we believe itright.SignedFRED WECKESSBR, Chairman.WM.

The material?are usually velvet or duvetyn, in anyof the soft shades of the presentseason.Simplicity Plus -CharmThe slogan of "American "Fashions" has brought out some wonderfully interesting tnings. Indeed,there is no reason why the Americandesigners should not be the bestjudges of the styles most becomingand appropriate to the American wojnan. The slightly fitted waist, notunlike the first form of the basque,has a piquant qharm when combinedwith the tunic that is longer in thefront than the back, and the anklelength skirt. It is truly the costumeof the lady, and the illustration hereshows some of the newest features ofthis style. The points of the waistare weighted with balls and cams inthe form of amber beads.

This statement is absolutelyuntrue, and has caused a flood of inquiries to which the following is asample of our reply:"Chicago advices absolutely untrueand do not represent opinion or proposed action of the Food Administration, which will take no steps tojeopardize live stock producers' interests. All our power will be used tbvkeep prices at which allied and governmental purchases are made, on aplane that gives an assured return. ofcost and profit to producers of meatanimals. In our opinion the bestmarket obtainable for the presentcorn crop of the country will bethrough live stock. We need increased production of beef and porkand the Only way to secure this increase will be .!)y a profit on production. Will appreciate your givingthis widest publicity.
