When the roll call was called by
years from 1855 including 1913, it
was both interesting and effective.
Mrs. America Butler was the only one
representing the class of 1855. An ex
cellent musical program was rendered
by the Alumnea. The principal fea
ture of the exercises was the address
by Judge Dennis Dundon, of Paris, an
old Millersburg boy.
At the close of the exercises the
Alumnae went into business session
and decided to hold its reunions bi
ennially inst'ead of annually as at
present. At 1 o'clock the Alumnea
banquet was held in the dining room
of the ccJlege, the Alumnae going in
by classes. There were several vis
itors present. The banquet was very
elaborate, and at the close a "number
responded to toasts. Miss Maymie
DeLong, one of the faculty, presided
as toastmistress. She proved a most
excellent toast mistress and made
every one feel free and easy and wil
ling to talk. The following respond
ed to toasts: Agnes Purnell, "Alum
nep. Days;" Miss Hortense Letton,
"Wood Memories"; Miss Maud Dacres,
"Class of '81;" Mrs. Frankie Allen
Harris, "Poem Reading;" Miss Eliza
beth McClintock Ingels; Mrs. Arthur
Best, "The Future Alumnae of M. F.
C." Mrs. Elizabeth Pery, Milersburg.
At the close of the regular program
a number of extempraneous toasts
were responded to which were very
spicy.
At 8 o'clock Saturday evening the
annual concert was held in the col
lege chapel. The program was clas
sical and well rendered. The audience
was as larg as on the previous even
ing. Sunday at 10:30 a. m., Rev. S. K.
Struve, of Clarksburg, W. Va., preach
ed the baccelaurate sermon at the
Methodist Church. The auspacious
auditorinm and Sunday School room
was filled to overflowing and many
were turned away. The musical pro
gram was exceedingly atractive, the
discourses rendered by Rev. Struve
was appropriate and fully up to the
average.
""Sunday evening at 8 o'clock Rev. E.
G. B. Mann, Presiding Elder of the
Maysvile District, preached the Mis
sionary sermon to the Y. W. C. A.
of the college at Methodist Church.
This addres was to have beendeliver
ed by Mrs. Spillman, of Harodsburg,
but owing to illness at home she was
unable to attend. Another equally
good musical program was rendered.
Mr. Man alos delivered a most excel
lent discourse. Dr. Fisher read a re
port of the Misionary work of the col
lege during the year, and a collection

NERVOUS TROUBLES
DRIVE AWAY HAPPINESS.
Tona Vita Will Quickly Drive Away
the Nervous Troubles
People who are run down in health
who are worn out, nervous and half
sick, are apt to be thoroughly discour
aged. They are half-hearted, listless
and depressed and feel that this is a
terrible world with many pains in it
and few pleasures.
This state of mind is recognized by
physicians as a common symptom of
nervous debility.
If you are one of the many Ameri
cans who are suffering with nervous
breakdown or nervous exhaustion,
you can get back your old health and
spirits in a few weeks' time. Go to
your druggist and obtain a bottle of
Tona Vita. This remarkable tonic is
helping thousands back to health and
it will not fail in your case. In fact
it never fails. You wil be astonished
how quickly it will build you up both
in mind and body.
Tona Vita is sold by Chas. E. Butler

License Must Be Procured.
Railway news companies selling soft
drinks to passengers on the trains,
must procure alicense from the coun
ty clerk in each county through which
the railroad pases or the soft drinks
are sold, to escape the penalty pro
vided by the statute for selling soft
drinks without a license.
Auditor Boaworth Friday announced
this rule in response to an inquiry of
the Van Noy News Company, which
asked if a blanket license to sell soft
drinks in the state would not cover all
of the counties.
Auditor Bosworth said that he want
ed it distinctly understood that blan
ket licenses would not cover cases like
this.nor street fairs, midways and
other such organizations.
The "Sweet Jar.'
The June Woman's Home Compan
ion contains an article entitled "How
to Use June Roses." Several old-fashioned
roses petal recipes are included.
Following is an extract:
"There are roses in jars that aro
called 'sweet jars;' these are for the
scenting of halls and parlors. They
are nice in the dining rom where they
can be opened and stirred before meal
time, and they are exquisite in the
sleeping rooms, for their effect upou
the nerves is very soothing.
"As important as the sweet jar is
the aromatic jar. This made with rose
leaves for a base, but it does not stop
with them by any means. The aro
matic jar is heavy with spicy odors;
it is scented with pinks, it breathes of
cinnamon and has a suggestion of
frankincense and myrrh."
Methodists in England.
There are only about 1,000,000 Meth
odists in England, and comparative
ly few of them are rich.but they have
just finished a cathedral in London
which "cost $5,300,000. It was built by
a vast number of small contributions
and very few relatively speaking,
which were for large sume.
At Leipzig the university is not
merely a German university but it
is first and foremost the University of
Leipzig a municipal institution.
Nine" Hours Sleep Says Wilson.
These are busy days at the White
House. President Woodrow Wilson
rises early, has breakfast at 8:30 and
is at work at nine. He shaves himself
and the barbers of Presidents Roose
velt and Taft are without occupation.
President McKinley was able to per
form the operation without a glass in
front of him, wlfile President Wilson
uses glases upon glasses.
The President is a firm advocate of
the simple life. He seldom remains up
later than eleven o'clock and even on
the night of his inauguration it is said
that he excused himself at 10:30 and
retired, so the orders are "lights out"
at 11 a contrast to the midnight
lights often burning to two or three
o'clock in the morning, when Presi
dent Taft was in the White House.
President Wilson is an advocate of
sleep he requires itis said, nine hours
though Napoleon may have decreed
five sufficient and Edison three. The
new President has a fondness for
guests at luncheon, and delights in an
old-fashioned visit. He has his din
ner hour at seven sharp, instead of at
eight.as during the previous adminis
tration, and some say he has alluded
to the evening meal often as "supper."
