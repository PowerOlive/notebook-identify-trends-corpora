BASE BALL,
FRIDAY.
Paris was successful against the Colts
in the game at Lexington Friday which
re'sulted in a score of 4 to 2 in favor of
the Bourbonites. The locals nut ud a
SDlendid fielding game behind Hauser
and were able to connect with Turner's
slants at the time when they counted
most. At times the fielding of the lo
cals wasjiothing ', short of sensational
both Harrell and Mollenkamp figurirg
Drominentlv in (his regard. Harrell
was the star ot the day getting on base
every time ud, tne rfist three times on
hits, stole two bases and scored the
first two runs for.Paris.
SATURDAY.
Mt. Sterling defeated . Paris Satur
day afternoon by a sere of 5 to 2. Ap
nlegate. who was on the rubber fcr
Paris was extremely wild and while
he allowed only six hits they came
when most
with a fpw
the game,
needed, and this coupled
errors gave the Orphans
SUNDAY.
Paris lost a seesaw game to the
Colts at Lexington Sunday afternoon
and thereby relinquished all claim on
anything other than fifth position.
The final score was 8 to 6. After
taKing a good lead the contest was
thrown awav in the seventh innng
when the Colts were allowed to scoie
four runs. Hauser was on the mound
for Paris and with the proper support
should have come out the victor, but
errors at critical stages coupled with
timely hitting resulted in his defeat.

Below is the report of the"commitfee
on future work adopted by the County

1. We urge the schools of Bourbon
countv to make eVery effort to be well
represented in the International On-,
vention of the Churches of Christ, in

ure from the enthusiasm and inspira
tion of this great gathering of .the

do our part in welcoming our brethren
of the whole world on Kentucky soil.
2. We recommend and urge that z.11
Sunday Schools attend our County

attend can testify to the belp and in
spiration we gather at these meetings.
3. We would also recommend that
more emphasis be placed upon the
observance of the Front Rank Stand

especially the items referring to the

To Seal Envelopes.
Persons using bond paper envelopes
in their correspondence, are often an.
noyed when these envelopes fail to
seal properly. This is not due to a
poor quality of gum on the envelope,
but to the non-absorbent properties of
the high-grade paper, and may be over
come by thoroughly moistening the
flap on the outside before moistening
the gum. This vill insure perfect
sealing and is worth trying.
Putting the Garters On.
Mrs. Brown was preserving peaches
in the kitchen amid an array of glass
jars, covers, rubber bands, etc. Mar
garet, aged four, watched the process
quietly until the fruit was in the jars
and the covers ready, then she ex
claimed, ';oh, mother, please let me
put the garters on!"
STOCK, CROP AND FARM NOTES.
Nicholas county growers are har
vesting the heaviest peach crop in
years.
Thomas Ballew, of Boone county
Me., recently bought from James
Glenn and Mode Glenn, of near Millers
burg, two mule colts at $100 eech.
Almost incessant rains have
greatly interferred with tne cutting
of tobacco in Woodford county, i he
condition of the crop is greatly im
proved and is considerably in euvance
of various years.
Henry Caywood, of North Middk-
town, sold two high-class, three-caited
five year old horses to Walter Clark,
of Warm Springs, Va. The price is
private, but understood to be a good
one. One of the horses is by Bourbon
Chief, the other is a grandson of Ches
ter Dare.
Export cattl are bemgjshippedlfrom
Bath county, which are weighing
heavily and bringing from 7 to 8 cents,
the highest price in that county, and
averaging $150 per head. During the
past two weeks it is estreated that ex
port catle Dut into the banks at Sharps
burg the sum of S202.500. A lot of
monev willjbe invested in cattle.
The following are among the mule
sales made at Winchester court: John
Daniels to W. A. Thomason. 3 mules
at $475, FletcherjMann, of Lexirgton,
sold to W. A. Ihomascn, of North
Middletown. two mules for $400, one
mule.for $210 and one mule for S225.
H. S. Caywood, uf North Middletown,
bought four mules at prices ranging
from $1F0 to $175. and several horses
at prices rang ing from $135 to$ 150.
A most hopeful sign, indicative of
results largely attributed to the per
sistent efforts heretofore made by the
United States Department of Agricul
ture in the line of seed' testing, is
manifest from an inspection of the
catalogues of more than fiftv of the
principal dealers of the country.
All the firms refetred to make defi
nite statements that they test their
seeds for germination. Nine firms ad
vise purchasers to send samples either
to the seed testing laboratory of the
U. S. Department of Argiculture or
to a State experiment station to be
tested. Seven firms state that they
offer and that the seeds are thereby
officially guaranteed to be of the high
grade represented. Six firms allow a
stated time for making a test, advise
purchasers to make such test on re
ceipt uf seeds, and request the return
of seeds which do not satisfactorily
meft the test. J;M
Five firms state that the seeds" they
are celling comply with Slate laws,
and a number of firms gave the per
cntace of puritv and germination in
compliance with State laws.
Thse statements indicate thaf com
petition Letween seed dealers 13 be
coming more nad Jrnore a comrjetition
bastd on quality -a healthful tendency
from the standpoint of both custoum
ers and Jionest dealers.
