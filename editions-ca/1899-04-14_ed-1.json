THE BOURBON NEWS ARIS KY FRIDAY APRIL 14 1399
Not much attention is often paid to the
first symptoms of Eczema but it is not long
before the little redness begins to itch and
burn This is but the beginning and will
lead to suffering and torture almost unen
durable It is a common mistake to regard
a roughness and redness of the skin as
merely a local irritation it is but an indica
tion of a humor in the blood of terrible
which is more than skin deep and can not be reached by local
of ointments salves etc annlied to the surface The disease itself
real cause of the trouble is in the blood although allauffprinerisDroduced
Bkrongh the skin the only way to reach the disease therefore is through
i looa
Mr Phil T Jones of Mixersville Ind writes
I had Eczema thirty years and after a great deal
treatment my leg was so raw and sore that it gave mew
Fiant pain ix nnany Droae into a running sore and
to spread and grow worse tor the past five or
flriatjyears I have suffered untold agony and had given up
atf Jaope of ever being free from the disease as I have
Qku reated by some of the best physicians and have
ftataec many blood medicines all in vain With little
left 1 began to take S 8 S and it apparently
the Eczema worse but I knew that this was the
the remedy got rid of the poison Continuing
SLS the sore healed up entirely the skin became
dear and smooth and I was cured perfectly
Eczema is an obstinate disease and can not be cured by a remedy which is
42slj a tonic Swifts Specific
S S S FOR THE BLOOD
5a superior to other blood remedies because it cures diseases which thy oan
cetieach It goes to the bottom to the cause of the disease and wil cure
he 5rsr case of Eczema no matter what other treatment has failed It is
Che only blood remedy guaranteed to be free from potash mercury or any
W00tx mineral and never fails to cure Eczema Scrofula Contagious Blood
Boasoc Ouncer Tetter Rheumatism Open Sores Ulcers Boils etc Insist
agpcm S B S nothing can take its place
