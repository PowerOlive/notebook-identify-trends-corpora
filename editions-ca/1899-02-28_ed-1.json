The Flrt John Jacob Astor
Concerning Appendicitia Although Mr Astor had led a life
Dr H R Lemen of Alton Ills says mainly devoted to business interests
I often meet people who have such a he found great pleasure in the society
wholesome fear of appendicitis that they of literary men says Mra Julia Ward
do not eat grapes tomatoes figs or Howe in The Atlanti Dr Cogswell
fruits containing little seeds because of made his home with us for some years
a fear that these seeds will lodge in the after the closing of his famous school
appendix and cause appendicitis I but finally wont to reside with Mr As-
Whenever I hear a person say he tor attracted partly by the latters
denies himself fruits because of this
fear I take occasion to assure him that
it is useless to take any such
pendicitis seven in ten instances is
due to other things than seeds Little
particles of food of any kind can lodge
in the appendix and produce appendi
citis even a bread crumb being capable

Sam Hodgkins says the Lewiston
Journal was in his day and genera
tion a much respected citizen of Han-
known all over the eastern portion of
the county An amusing story is told
by some of his old acquaintances to an
eastern Maine paper of how he once
of his happiest and most generous
moods and realizing no doubt the un
certainty of human life concluded that
he would bequeath to his seven sons
Dudley Zachariah Moses Sam Shem
Gee and Elliot his worldly goods and
possessions
He was very anxious that the will
should be legal and was careful lest
any of his children might be left un
mentioned in some way So the old
man drew up the instrument in part
like this Half to Dud half to Zack
and all the rest to Moses Shem is
blind Sam is poor Gee has moved to
the Falls Sullivan Falls and Elliot is
tiie baby As the will wa never pro
bated it answered the purpose just as
well as any
Bismarck and tbe French
Bismarck had no great opinion of the
French He believed that they are too
easily swayed by popular catchwords
Talk to a Frenchman about liberty
equality and fraternity tell him that
his nation is the greatest in the world
and you can do anything with him
You can impress the French more than
any other people if you tell them it is Qm
done in the name of freedom
Asked his opinion in the case of a
certain French spy he said Its a
sad case Youve gt to hang him but
do it with the utmost politeness so as
not to hurt his feeings Exchange
Equal to a Fairy Story
Bilkins was seated in an easy chair
enjoying his paper while his wife was
busy with fancy work Bobby the
diera Presently the little fellow tired
of his play and exclaimed
Mamma wont you please tell me a
fairy story
I dont feel like it tonight Bobby
said Mrs Bilkins Go and get your
papa to tell you what detained him
down town so late last night Ohio

Missed the Combination
He is one of those gushing old beaus
who think flattery the key to favor
with the gentler sex The other evening
he was at a reception with his wife
and they met the handsome Miss Blank
at whom he fired a whole battery of
compliments Then turning to his wife
he said Its a good thing I didnt
meet her before I married you my
dear
Indeed it is she smiled sweetly
for her I congratulate Miss Blank

A Delicate Distinction
How much does your position pay
asked the rural relative
I dont know as I could figure it up
offhand answered Senator Sorghum
You surely know your own salary
Yes but that isnt what you asked
me Washington Star
promise to endow a public library in
the city of New York This was accom
plished after some delay and the doc
tions If you like fruit eat it for tor was for many years director of the
Astor library He used to relate some
humorous anecdotes of excursions which
he made with Mr Astor In the course
of one of these the two gentlemen took
supper together at a hotel recently
of it In addition a great many cases opened Mr Astor remarked
are caused by something entirely out- man will never succeed
ide the appendix something causing
the inflammation
To all I would say Go ahead and
eat anything you like for all precau
tions you may take are not going to
save you from appendicitis if you are
going to have it The inexplicable
things to which the majority of cases
are attributable cannot be guarded
against and it is useless to fight the
minority
This
Why not inquired the other
Dont you see replied the finan
cier what large lumps of sugar he
puts in the sugar bowl
Once as they were walking slowly to
a pilotboat which the old gentleman
had chartered for a trip down the har
bor Dr Cogswell said Mr Astor 1
have just been calculating that this
boat costs you 25 cents a minute Mr
Astor at once hastened his pace reluc
tant to waste so much money
