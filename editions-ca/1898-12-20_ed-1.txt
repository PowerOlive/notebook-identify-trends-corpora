Itis no small indemnity for the cost of the warThis governmenthas proved itself Invinciblein the recent war and out of it has come a nation which will remain indivisible for evermore No worthier contributions have beenmade in patriotism and in men than by thepeople of these southern states When at lastthe opportunity came they were eager tomeet it and with promptness respondedto the call of

Recess in the House Will Begin Thursday and Extend Until January The Appropriations AreVVery Well AdvancedWashington Dec 19 The week inthe senate opened with a speech hySenator Piatt of Connecticut on thequestion of expansion Mr Piatt willreply to the speech of Senator Vestmade last Monday as he has givenvery careful attention to theextension of our territorial areano little interest is manifestedamong senators in his presentation oithe matter and it is not improbableunless the Nicaragua bill preventsthat the speech will precipitate a moreor less general debate upon thisquestion Whether it does or not a number of speeches on the same subjectwill be made after the Christmas holidays preparatory to the considerationof the peace treatyIt is hoped that the treaty will betaken up for discussion early in -JanuaryAlready there is talk of theprobability of disposing of the treatyduring the present session and the impression favorable to this result isgrowing A few senators manifest adisposition to debate the treaty atlength and some profess unalterableopposition but the feeling is sostrong against an extra session and infavor of the postponement of- thesettlement of the disposition of thePhilippines after they come into ourpossession that it now seems that eventhe minority will consent to the treatysratification without material delaySenator Morgan said Sunday that hemeant to press the Nicaragua canalbill as vigorously as possible and heexpressed the hope that he might geta vote before next Wednesday theprobable date of the Christmas adjournment The indications are however against such an early disposal ofthe subject and it may be accepted asquite certain that even if Senator Turpies motion for postponement till January 10 should not prevail the billwillbe naturally thrown over beyond theholidays It is evidently the purposeof the opposition to prevent action during the few remaining days prior toadjournmentThe bill concerning the registry offoreign built vessels wrecked on theAmerican coast is still on the calendaras a special order and Senator Elkinswill probably make another effort tosecure consideration Senator Cullomhas also expressed a

AdmDeweys health has broken down as aresult of his wonderful work in Manila harbor on May 1 last He wasin fine physical condition when Ileft him and he was then overthe strain of the naval fightThere is another thing that I wouldlike the people to know It is thatthe climate of the Philippines is notby any means as it is said to be Imet a number of Europeans there whohad been in the country for 14 yearsor more and they seemed to thriveand had no serious complaints aboutthe climate to make The mortalityamong our troops sent to preserve order there would not be as great assome would have the people believeAs to Gen Miles bill to increasethe United States army to 100000 atpresent I can not discuss the proposedmeasure for the reason that I have notyet seen a copy of it I think it willtake about 30000 soldiers to hold theislands in case this country desires tokeep them and I see no reason why itshould notI have no comment to make on theso called expansion which is being discussed pro and con these da3rs Thereare many Spaniards on the islands thatwant to remain there With 15000United States soldiers and the remaining 15000 evenly divided between theFilipinos and Spaniards I feel

followed her companion of the night To ease the horseI slipped from the saddle and hangingon to the pommel was towed along byhim as the good beast breasted thestream bravely The current set toward the opposite bank and the forceof it carried us down it seemed in amoment fully 50 yards from the spotwhere he had plunged in to within afew feet of the opposite shore Herehowever the river ran strong and swiftly the bank was high and the horsescould make no headway but kept drifting down By this time the troopershad reached the scene of the fight andI could hear them howling with angeras they gathered around their fallenleaders and without a head to guidethem hesitated what to do each moment of delay giving me precious timeand bringing me closer to a shelvingbank a few yards to the left Not oneof the troopers dared the stream andthey had apparently emptied their arquebuses after us in pursuit for nonefixed although they called to eachother Shoot him down shoot himdownA couple of men galloped down streama little below me and dismounting began to load hurriedly it being evidentlytheir intention to pick me off as I driftsed past For the moment I gave myselfup for lost but determining to make alast effort to save myself made a snatchat the willows that overhung the bankand brushed us with their wet and drippingleaves as we struggled underneathAs I did this I loosed my hold of thesaddle and the horses slid past me andI was dragged by the current right in tothe bank The willows were tough andI held on to them like a leech and thetroopers who had seen what I was aboutbegan to laugh at me and adjured meto hold on tight as they would be readyto shoot in a moment The fools Theygave me the moments time I wantedand digging my foot into the soft bankI laid hold of the stem of a willow

bringing me down Theyaimed truly enough and had I not lainto earth as I did 1 should infallibtyhave been killed for the bullets whizzedpast it seemed but a few inches aboveme I let out a yell as if I

Even if nofurther attempt to follow me was madeto night which was uncertain as deGomeron was not the man to let thebarest chance slip through his fingersyet there was no doubt as to what wouldhappen on the morrow I congratulated nrrself on having crippled the lastof the sleuth hounds as my gentlemenwould be placed thereb3r in a difficultyin regard to my route and if thescoured the country in twos and threesI felt confident of being able withJacques aid to give a good account ofmyself did we meet despite my bruisedleg which reminded me of itself unpleasantlyAs I patted Couronnes neck I thoughtof Nicholas and with the memor ofhim the face of Marie came up I feltmyself in a measure responsible for hisdeath and -was resolved to weigh out infull to Marie the payment I had promised them both It was a debt I woulddischarge to the end of the measureA sense of relief came to my mindvith this resolve and as Bouvres couldnot be far distant I slackened pace tolet the horses breathe a trifle and liegun to hastily plan my future course ofaction on reaching Paris I had notonly discovered what was evidently adeep and widely spread plot but hadalso stumbled on the dreadful secret ofthe death of the woman who was to bequeen of France in name as she was inIt was certain that she hadbeen foully murdered It was certainthat the kings most trusted captainand many of his greatest nobles werehilt deep in treachery so much I knewIhadseen wiith mine own eyes and heardwith mine own ears but beyond thisI had no proofs and what would mywordi weigh against theirs Besidesthis there was -my own troubleDAyeris mocking warning wnexplieitenough when read with- Palins confidence and any doubt Imay have hadon that point was almost set at rest bywhat I had overheard In short I wasthe rival of the king and felt my headvery loose upon my neckWhat was I to do It was no easymatter to decide but I came to the conclusion that my best course was toseek out the all powerful Sully tell himwhat I knew and beg the help of thatgreat man I did not know him except by repute but my case was strongand my cause good I would delay nota moment about this on reaching Parisbut it was Bouvres I had to come tofirst and many a league lay for reflection between me and the LouvreAt last I heard the Lauds chime solemnly out into the night and in a fewminutes pulled up the weary beasts before the gates of Bouvres Here I founda difficulty I might have anticipatedThe gates were shut and the unpleasantprospect of a dreary wait of some hourslay before me This was not to beborne and I raised a clamor thatmight have awakened the dead Ithad the desired effect of rousing thewatch at the gate a wicket was openedthe light of a lantern flashed throughand a gruff voice bade me begoneupen x roareu open in

turned into the g uardroomand congratulated myself on my stratagem and the luck that had befriendedit I knew enough of court intrigue tobe aware that De Sancy and the marshal were at each others throats andthat I could therefore always get protection here b3r declaring myself againstBiron Then came a short turn to theright and M de Preaulx of the Anjoumois was at the door of the Grard CerfIt opened to my knock and Jacquesfaithful knave was in waiting Afterthis there followed the usual little delayand bustle consequent on a new arrivalAs I dismounted Jacques whisperedin my ear You are M de

Palais de Justice where the housesare so crowded that they seem to cliirihone over the other in their efforts toreach higher and higher in their searchfor air is a small street called the Buedes Deux Mondes It had this advantage that it was wider than most of theother roads in that part of Paris andopened out abruptly on to the riverface very nearly opposite the upperportion of the Pont Neuf then undercourse of construction but not to befinished for some years later At thecorner of the street and overlookingthe river the Pont Keuf the Passeuraux Vaches with a glimpse of theQuai Malaquais and the mansions ofthe Faubourg St Germain was a houseof modern size kept and owned by aMaitre Pantin who was engaged nominally in some legal business in thecourts of the cityIt was this house of Maitre Pantin itwill be remembered that had been recommended to me as a lodging by Palinwho told me of the owners occupationand when I demurred on account of myreligious convictions the Huguenotpointed out that I had to do things inParis which required a safe retreat andthat he cou3d vouch for the honesty anddiscretion of Pantin I admitted thathis arguments were reasonable and resolved to take advantage of his recommendationWe rode into Paris by the St Germains gate and I was immediatelystruck by the aspect of gloom that thecity wore Most of the shops were indeed open but there appeared to be nobusiness doing and instead of menhurrying backward and forward thestreets were filled with groups of people evidently engaged in discussingsome affair of the utmost momentEvery third or fourth man wore a blackscarf over his right arm and the bellsof the churches were tolling dismallyfor the dead From St German desPres from St Severin from the airyspire of Ste Chapelle they called outmournfully

hundreds oflong robed students were assembledand the windows of many of the greathouses including the Logis de Neverswere hung with black It was strangeto see Paris always so bright and gaywith this

oonveniency tocheap wits It seems however thatthe feeling is recognized as such in lawas in a recent case wherea man sued hismother-in-law to recover some propertythe jury were closely questioned as tcwhether they entertained a prejudiceeither generally or specifically againstmothers-in-law that would preventtheir rendering a just verdict A lasttwelve good men and true presumablybachelors were found who testified tohaving no feeling on the mother-in-lawquestion and the case proceededProbably very few men would admitto being influenced by the stale andsilly gibes at mothers-in-law but thaithey have great weight is proven by theattitude that almost- every man takestoward his wifes mother He hasbeen warned by the comic papers thatshe will attempt to manage him andrun his house that she will incite hiswife to acts of independence and puther up to defying his opinion So heis on his guard He looks upon herwith suspicion and is apt to think thatthe most harmless suggestion is unwarranted interferingTo a certain degree this feeling maybe traced to a not unnatural jealousyThe young husband is always veryself dmportant He expects to be allin all to his wife He is determined

his debtswas not raised is the owner of booksand manuscripts relating to his greatancestor Columbus which are almostpriceless Among them are books thatwere owned by Columbus himself Awriter in the New York Times in reviewing this subject says with fineirony considering Veraguas characterthat possibly the duke might be patriotic enough to help his country bydisposing of the correspondence of Columbus which he prizes so highlyThese artistic and literary treasuresrepresent an immense sum of moneyand at one time during the war a Spanish paper suggested that while thetreasury was practically empty itmight be supplied with money by disposing of these worksBut the suggestion was not adoptedand Spain maj congratulate herself onthe fact that she was not opposed by agrasping enemy If she

labor inthis way is shown in the accompanyingillustration The farm sled can be usedas the scraping platform b Thescalding vat a may be any large barrel which will hold water Securelyblock and brace it so that it will notbe displaced in putting the hog in andtalcing it out In the iron kettle c thewater is heated The hog is killed anddrawn along the side of the scrapingplatform opposite the iron

PLAGUESome Excellent Results Obtainedfrom tlie Serum Treatment ofDr D ja SalmonDuring the past two years the department of agriculture nas conducted aseries of experiments in the use of aserum as a remedy for hogs affected bycholera or swine plague The experiments were conducted by Dr D E Salmon chief of the bureau of animal industry and the results were eminentlysatisfactory proving that the dreadeddisease can be successfully treated easily and inexpensively The losses suffered by the farmers of the UnitedSiates annually from hog cholera aggregate an enormous sum In Iowaalone during 1S96 it is estimated thatthe hog raisers lost through the ravageof the disease 15000000 The department of agriculture conducted experiments in Page county la the resultashowing a loss of only 20 per cent ofthe affected droves This year the experiments have been extensive and fatreaching The bureau treated 022 hogsOf these 170 head died the numbttsaved being 81 out of every 100 Theanimals comprised 17 droves and olthese six droves lost only one hog eachOn the other hand 1107 hogs in otherdroves were served and not subjectedto the serum treatment Of these 87Sdied showing a loss of 79S hogs out ofevery 100 The cholera serum is procured by keeping apart for treatmentn animal a horse or a cow and injecting into its blood a small amount olthe blood of a cholera diseased hogThis will sicken the subject but he willrecover when another dose will be administered and so on for a time untilfinally his blood becomes so impregnated as to render him practicallycholera proof Then his blood is letand the clot drawn off leaving the thinyellowish portion which is the serumThis is used to inject the diseased hogsand operates to render them likewisecholera proof or even cures them olthe diseaseWHEN TO APPLY MANUREResult of a Comparative Test Made asYear Ago at the Ohio Experiment StationA year ago the Ohio experiment station began a comparative test betweercow manure taken from tbestable to the field in the spring and manure of the same sort which had beenallowed to lie in the open yard duringthe winter The plan of the experimentis to apply both kinds of manure tcland intended for corn plow under ata shallow depth and follow the cornwith wheat and clover without anyfurther manuring Four duplicateplcts are treated with each kind of manure applied at the rate of eight tonsper acre the ti eatment for each pair oiplots being exactly alike in all otheirespects The result thus far is that thecorn of 1S97 gave an increase of 13 bushels per acre from the yard manuraagainst 16 bushels from the stall ma-nufeandtheAvheatcrsopollowing hasgiven an increase of ten bushels peiacre for the yard manure against 11bushels from the stall manure Valuing the corn at 33 cents and the wheatat 80 cents per bushel and the strawand stover at three dollars per ton theincrease from the yard manure in thetwo crops has amounted to 15 per acreand that from the stall manure to 17an average of two dollars

Products for HogsOne of the best ways to obtain betteiresults iu swine breeding is to makemore use of the mill products that canbe obtained in most regions It maynot be generally- known that we exportgreat quantities of oil meal for theEnglish farmers to fatten their hogs onand yet not one farmer in a thousandever uses this as swine food Xow tlnibeet sugar factories are being put upin various parts of the country tnerewill be added another mill product forutilizing for swine feeding DakotaField and FarmBacteria in the MilkIt is thought by many that the organisms en the hay that is eaten as foodmay pass through the body of the animal and be excreted in the milk butsuch is notthe case - The bacteria thatenter the body in the food or drink donot escape from the intestine If theyare not destroyed by the gastric juicesther are excreted in the manure andcan only gain access to the milk by contaminating the same subsequent tomilking H h EukcIL in HoardDfuryiaaaTHE BENEFICEHT INVENTORHis Work Mast Be Timelr ud Complete to Win SubstantialSuccessA deserved tribute to the inventor asa promoter of human progress is paidby Engineering a leading Englishweekly But that excellent periodicalemphasizes some of the essentials tosuccess It declares that somethingmore is needed than mechanical ingenuitj if a man is really to serve hisday and generation He must have asense of the needs of the time to directhis energies into the right channel Hemust present his work at the momentwhen the intellect of the period isreadjr to receive it and when a latentdemand awaits its advent The manwho is in advance of the age wastes hislabor and does positive harm by distracting attention from more practicable schemes He may comfort himselfin his failure by the thought that he isworking for posterity but in so doinghe cherishes a delusive solace No oneknows what the needs of posterity willbe nor along what line mechanical development will proceedAnother essential of a beneficent invention is that it is complete or thatit is capable of rapid completion Thereis nothing easier than to invent if youdisregard the details Hundreds perhaps thousands of people invented thesurface condenser for the marine engine and yet it was years before it attained a practical form As for watertube boilers the name of their inventoris Legion or rather was for he diedyears ago Some of the boilers wouldhave been successful if they could havebeen constructed with solid drawnsteel tubes and if there had been aready way of malting the numerousjoints they often contained But theseessentials were not forthcomingThe man who perfects the weak link isfrom the present point of view as trulythe inventor of the whole as he whooriginates the rest for without him theprevious work was uselessHowever a new device be it a machine or a process needs a good dealof nursing before it can fight its wayin the world Very frequently we hadalmost written generally those whoare prolific in original ideas are notskillful in business negotiations andhence they often see their brightest offspring perish of inanition Fortunateis the inventor who has a partner to actas foster parent to his progeny and drynurse them into strength and activityAs we have already said the abandonedpatent is a bar to progress and insteadof being an aid to the civilization of theworld is just the opposite For someinventions no commercial ability couldsecure an immediate useful existencethey are prematurely born But thereare many which perish simply for lackof care and it is in regard to such casesas these

of pigeonsin Kentucky that extended as far asthe eye could reach and was more thanfive hours iu passing He attempted tocompute the number of individual birdsin the flight and found that beyondquestion there were more than 500000000 Further he estimated that therecould not have been less than that number in the smaller flights which wereobserved passing northward in greatnumbers early in the day
