FEEBACK GORDON.
Miss Rosie P. xFeeback, of this
county, and Mr. Geonre N. Gordon.
the Tf Rushville, Indiana, were married
in. this city by County Judge George
Batterton.
. Captain Reuben Brents 'Hutch
crafty Jr., the son of. Dorcas. A.,. -and
IL'B. HutchcFaft, wasborn in.aris,
Kentucky, on December 15, 1886.
received his early training- in the
'-local schools and at a tender age
gave promise j of those splendid
traits of mind' arid heart which later
1 in life so distinguished him. In
3.903 lie entered what was then old
Kentucky JJniversity. He was grad
uated therefrom in 1907with honors,
receiving the' "degree of Bachelor of
Arts. He became- a 'post-graduate
student in Harvard University the
4 same year, specializing in political
economy, msiury sum guveuuucuu

'study of law in the Harvard Law
JSchodl. He graduated in the sum
her of 1911 with the degree of
Bachelor of Law! While at the Uni--versity
he' was actively interested in
Massachusetts politics and the public
questions of the day, and though
merely a school boy, earned for "him
'self u reputation as a political think
er; speaker and debater that- few
men, at any age have equalled. His
H&rvard career throughout was dis
tinguished. In his senior year he
became an associate editor of the
Harvard Law Review. The articles
contributed to this magazine by
Captain Hutchcraft are keen legal
studies, and promise a splendid
scholarship for their-author.
'After graduation CaptainHutch--j-aft
began the practice of law in
Paris, Kentucky, in the fall- of,
'1911. He was an'able and resource
ful practitioner. Though a young
lawyer, he became interested in
much, important litigation. Mr.
Hutchcraft was attorney for the con
testees in the liocal Option Election
Contest case of 1914 and very suc
cessfully in all courts upheld the le
gality of the election. Although a
first-class, technical .lawyer, Captain
Hutchcraft was professionally inter
ested mainly in problems of State,
and political and governmental
questions. And for their solution he
was equipped with a. superbly train
ed scholarship and "a wonderfully
acute, logical and analytical mind.
His opportunity came soon. . In the
fail of 1913.be was nominated and
elected without opposition to the
office of Representative of Bourbon
County. Again in 1915 .he was
elected to the same office. He at
tied two sessions of the General
A embly of Kentucky, in 19 14 and
5 010. He was a member at the
v SpWal .Session of 1917. As a Rep
resentative he was interested in and
responsible for much of the legisla
tion of that period. His Legislative
Tecord throughout was a brilliant
one. He was a constructive states
man. Recognizing fiis ability as an
expert on the subject of taxation,
the Governor of- Kentucky in 1916
appointed Captain Hutchcraft one of
I the four House members of the
Kentucky Tax Commission. It was
the duty of this Commission to write
a new Tax Law for the Common-
-. wealth. "'How well it succeeded and
..- b'ow well Captain Hutchcraft 'suc
ceeded, may be inferred from the
fact that the law as drafted by the
Commission was adopted without
material change by the Legislature at
i. the special session of 1917.
' fu 1915 Captain Hutchcraft ' was
appointed to the Chair of Law in the
'Law.. Department of the University
of Kentucky at Lexington. He held
' 'this position -two years and resigned
in order to answer his country's bu
gie call. In the early spring of 1917
he entered the first Officers' Training
N Camp at Fort Benjamin Harrison,.
' and' upon completing the course, was
'commissioned a First Lieutenant.
IP. the early fall of the same year he
was ordered to foreign duty. He saw
active service from the start as a
'First lieutenant, afterwards Cap
tain, in the 166th U. S. Infantry, a
regiment of the famous Rainbow Di
vision. He went into battle with.
America's first combat troops, and
was actively engaged until his death.
He was killed in action November 6,
1918, near Sedan, on his country's
K furtherest advanced battle line. He
passed on, almost at the supreme pno-
' rnent of victory, just as the weary
guns were -about to grow silent, and
when healing peace was already on
her way earthwards. He sleeps his
peaceful soldier sleep near where he
fell, "somewhere in France," in a
spot that is and shall ever be a part
of Kentucky.
Such, in brief, are the facts in the
life of Captain Hutchcraft a life of
service crowned with, a hero's death.
He is,survived by his mother and far
ther and two sisters, who in his
death have suffered the most grievous
loss of an only son and brother. .
Therefore. Be It Resolved: That
in the death of Captain Hutchcraft
ytrareaved family has lost a loving
and -dutiful, son and atender and af
fectionate 'brother; the County of
Bourbon, one of her most distin
guished citizens; the Bourbon and
Kentucky Bar, an able and brilliant
lawyer; the Commonwealth, a most
competent and efficient Legislator;
the Cause of Legal Education in
Kentucky, an eloquent advocate; a
host of friends, a warm-hearted, gen
erous companion; and the Nation at
-N Large, a brave and gallant soldier.
Be It Further Res61ved: That
thase Resolutions be spread upon the
records of this- Association and of the
Bourbon Circuit Court; that a copy
of same besent to each newspaper
in. 'Bourbon. County, Kentucky, for
publication therein; and that a copy
of same be sent to each newspaper
family. - v

COMMUNICATION, FROM STATE
B0ABD OE HEALTH. t
Paris, Ky., Jan. 14, 1919.
Believing that a former order of
the City Board of Health strongly
urging the importanse of innoculation
with the Rosenow-Mayo serum as the
safest known niethod for protection
against influenza and pneumonia,
has in a large measure been disre
garded, the percentage of innoculate
children in the various rooms of the
City School being about six, and in
further view of the fact that the
Board finds many cases, though mild,
which might have been prevented,
respectfully calls attention to the fol
lowing communication:
Bowling Green, Ky., Jan. 9, 1919.
THE STATE BOARD OF HEALTH.
THE ROSENOW MAYO VACCINE
Dr. A. H. Keller, City Health Officer,
Paris, Ky.
As requested, I am sending you the
Rosenow-Mayo Vaccine for preven
tive inoculation against influenza,
and especially against the types of
pneumonia which have caused most of
the deaths during this epidemic. Dr.
Rosenow says "This vaccine is pre
pared from pneumococci of the vari
ous types and allied green-producing
streptococci, from hemolytic strept
ococci, staphylococci and influenza
bacilli, as isolated from the sputa and
lunors of cases durine the nresent epi
demic of influenza and pneumonia." I
Dr. Rosenow advises that individu-j
als be given three inoculations, one
week apart, in order to get the high
est and most enduriner immunity.
There is usually no reaction from the
inoculation except in persons about I
to come down with influenza, and
even then the disease seems to run a i
shorter and milder course and com
plicating pneumonia seldom occurs.
As a treatment during an attack of
influenza the dose indicated on the
label is to be given daily for three
days and, although some reaction
may follow, many physicians report
excellent results Jin relieving the in
fluenza and in presenting pneumonia.
As to the preventive value of the
inoculation, the records in the office
of the Surgeon General of the Army,
dealing with a division of 27,000
troops in the early stage of the epi
demic, show that of 12,000 men who
received the inoculation 8 developed
pneumonia, with no deaths ;of 15,000
not inoculated, 800 developed pneu
monia, with 120 deaths. The Equit
able Life Insurance Company re
ports its use in 20,000 of its policy
holders and their families, and the
Mayo clinic reports its use in 20,000
cases, each without a death. At the
Homestead Steel Works; near Pitts
burg, of 7,651 employees of 1,687
who were not inoculated, 558 develop
ed pneumonia and 42 'died; of 4,72Q
who were inoculated, 66 developed
the disease, with no deaths. Many
similar experiences might be given if
space permitted. Not a single case of
harm from its use has been reported.
With the approval of the Surgeon
General, the entire army has been
inoculated. This Board after the
fullest investigation endorses its use
by every person 'in Kentucky who is
not certain that he or she has re
cently had influenza. It has already
distributed 250,000 doses, and will
gladly send it free to any physician
who will keep a record of its use in
each case, on blanks furnished for
that purpose and his promise to re
turn them to Bowling Green for tabu
lation and study, and for the use of
Dr. Rosenow, 60 days after the last
dose is given.
Dr. South, here, has entire charge
of the distribution of the vaccine and
it will prevent delay and confusion if
all requests for it by letter or wire,
are addressed to her. Also, on ac
count of the scarcity of glassware,
please mail all vials and containers
back as soon as they are emptied.
Very respectfully,
J. S. McCORMICK,
Secretary.
