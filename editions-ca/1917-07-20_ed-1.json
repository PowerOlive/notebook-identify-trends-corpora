The Ladies' Missionary Society
of the Methodist church held a meet
ing at the home of Mrs. Elizabeth H.
Miller, Wednesday afternoon. The
Young Peoples' Society was enter
tain as guests. At 6 p. m. an elabor
ate picnic lunch was served on the
lawn. The regular business routine
was gone through at the afternoon
meeting, and the husbands of the
ladies joined them at lunch.
Our town was considerably
shaken up Tuesday night when bur
glars made their annual visit to Mil
lersburg. As they did not make
their appearance as early in the sum
mer as they have done in the past
two years it was thought by a num
ber of our ladies that they would
pass us up this time, and they began
to feel decidedly comfortable. Tues
day night they entered the home of
Messrs. W. D. Mclntyre and M. C.
Grimes. In the home of Mr. Mcln
tyre they entered from a front win
dow on the veranda, secured about
$30 in cash from Mr. Mclntyre and
about $9 in cash from a, guest in the
house. The home was entered about
midnight so far as can be ascertain
ed,. It was thought by the inmates
that they heard slight noises about
the premises, but of this they are not
certain. At the home of Mr. Grimes
they entered from a rear door in the
kitchen, the inside lock being unlock
ed, fastened only by a screen, and
helped themselves to something to
eat. As soori as their appearance was
discovered the Mulligan Wood hounds
was summoned from Lexington, and
were on the trail about 8 o'clock.
The trail was followed successfully
until they reached the farm of Mr. J.
H. Barnes, where it was lost in a
field. There the thieves c. mounted
horses of Mr. Barnes and rode away,
later turning the horses loose., They
were round at tne entrance or tne
Barnes place early in the morning.
An effort will be made to sift this to
the bottom, a still hunt will be made.
Several suspects are being closely
matched. Not only have burglars en
tered the mose, but in the past few
night the gardens of Messrs. Joe Far
ris, E. D. Baldwin and Robert Mad
den were partially plundered. The
meat house of Mr.'C. L. Vimont also
came in for its share.

MATRIMONIAL.
HEISER JACKSON.
Mr. Mitchell B. Jackson, of
Paris, and Miss Anna Heiser of Fal
mouth, sprang a surprise on their
many friends and relatives by com
ing to Paris, Wednesday night from
Boonesboro, where they have been
members of a camping party, and be
ing married.
The party took every precaution
to keep their plans secret. They
came to Paris in Mr. Jackson's auto
and taking two intimate friends in
their confidence proceeded, after se
curing the marriage license, to the
residence of Rev. W. E. Ellis, where
the ceremony was performed in the
presence of a few witnesses and mem
bers of their families. After the
ceremony Mr. and Mrs. Jackson re
turned to Boonesboro, where they
will spend their honeymoon.
Mr. Jackson is a son of Mrs. J. H.
Martin, of near Paris. He was for
fifteen years a clerk in the depart
ment store of H. M. Collins & Co.,
leaving there about two years ago
to take a half-interest in the man
agement of the Fordham Hotel, the
bowling alleys and billiard room.
He is a young man of clean charac
ter, a successful business man whose
friends are legion. His bride is a
dau&hter of Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Heiser,
of Falmouth, and a sister of Mrs.
Edward Summers, of Paris, at
whose home she has been a frequent
visitor. She is a young woman of de
cidedly handsome personality, bright
and vivacious, and a most charming
young woman.
THE NEWS extends heartiest con
gratulations and best wishes to Mr.
and Mrs. Jackson. May they live
long and prosper.
MERCER McCOY.

nic Tuesday in the woodland on the
farm of Mr. E. K. Thomas, eight
miles from Paris. The picnic dinner
was spread on the grass and every
body did justice to it, plenty being
left. The trip was made 'possible by
the generosity of the J. T. Hinton
Co., who furnished their motor ve
hicles for the transportation of the
party.

COMPRESSED AIR SERVICE.
IMPROVED
Mccormick

Few visitors to Paris realize that
the French capital has an extensive
compressed air service analogus to
the ordinary gas or municipal water
service. There are several hundred
miles of compressed air piping under
lying the Paris streets. The air is
supplied to stores and cafes, and is
used in cooling-rooms, and as a
means of furnishing power to fans,
sewing machines, and even a few
elevators. The air is metered like
gas.
