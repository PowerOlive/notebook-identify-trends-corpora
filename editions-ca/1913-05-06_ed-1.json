Shelburne Champion Fertilizer
is Best for Burley Tobacco.
I have had the Champion Tobacco
Fertilizer put up especially for Burley
tobacco on Blue- Grass lands. The mix
ture is the result of analysis and ex
periments made by the State Experi
ment Station here, and contains a full
supply of potash, which is needed to
make the tobacco crop and not so much
phosphate, as these lands are well sup
plied with it.
We haye also avoided putting in too
much amonia, which lute too much
stable manure, is liable to grow the
plant too fast and coarse. The price
is 530 per ton. Cash or note with ap
proved security. Parties who wish to
try it will please advise us at.once, as
the demand is very heavy and the
factory ,over run with orders. At pres
ant we have some in stock here and at
Georgetown, Winchester and Mt. Ster
ling and Paris.

Letter From Justus Gobel.
The following letter from Mr. Jus
tus Goebel to Mr. fcHai Woodford, of
this city, is self explanatory.
Covington, Ky., Aoril 22, 191&
Mr. J. Hal Woodford. Pans, Ky.
My Dear Mr. Woodford: I under
stand that some persons at Alt. Ster
ling are industriously circulating a re
port that my friend, J. Will Clay,-who
is a candidatte for the State Senate,
bolted my brother. I have always un
derstood, .from mv brother's closest
and'best friends there, that Mr. Clay
opposed William Goebel in the conven
tion for Captain Stone, but after his
nomination he gave him his earnest
support.
I write this in simple justice to Mr.
Clav, knowing him to be a sterling
Democrat and for the reason that I do
not want anv Democrat who supported
my brother to have his loyalty im
punged tn his detriment.
Sincerely your Friend "

May Court Day raws SU1J
Crowd.
A busy season, coupled -with kteal
weather for farm work, had the effect
of reducing the crowd in attendance
upon May court to one of the small
est in manv months. Farmers were
free to take advanage of the opportu
nity of completing their farm work
and as a result only a small number
were in town, yesterday.
Business, however, from the reports
of merchants was very good consider
ing the attendance which was a de
cided falling "off from that of last
court day.
Farmers at 'this time of the year
beiog well suppplied with work stock
there was little demand for horses or
mules. Not more than five or six.
mules were offered for sale on lhe
public square. Caywood & McClintock
sold two head to a Lexingon party for
$480, one to Asa Jewell for S250 and
one to Dave May for 200. They pur
chased from James Crumble one mule
for $175.50.
At the pens of M. J. Murphy & Co.
about 13n head of cattle were offered,
The demand was strong and all sold at
prices ranging from $25 to $37.50 per
head.
