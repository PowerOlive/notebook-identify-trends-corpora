not that we eat slowly or fastbut that when we do eat we chew withenergy Of course where the haste isdue to some meutal anxiety this mayinjuriously inhibit the secretions Sloweating begets a habit of simply mum-ing it while the hurried eater is inclined to swallow his food before propermastication Hence hurried eating isbad but rapid mastication is advantageous It concentrates our energieson the act in question and hence morethoroughly accomplishes it Moreoverenergetic chewing stimulates the secretion of saliva in the most favorablemanner These various points are socommonly misunderstood at least bythe laity that they demand our frequent attentionThe Gloved PashaMustapba Pasha Fehmi prime minister of Egypt decorated by Queen Victoria with the grand cross of the Orderof St Michael and St

werereturned almost immediately the Merriams among the first although theMerriams were not among the first towelcome her arrival As luck wouldhave it Merriam was out on some troopduty Mrs Merriam saw her comingaccompanied by Mrs Grafton and fairly flew upstairs to her room instead offirst giving instructions to her servantas an older soldier of society wouldhave done In consequence the Chinaman admitted her caller to Floys pretty parlor and went in search of the ladyof the house Mrs Grafton seated herself in an easy chair but Fanny flittedrapidly from point to point scanningpictures books and Johnpresently reappeared smiling vacuouslyNo can see She sick velly hesturdily reported-Mrs Grafton looked concerned MrsMcLane annovedIm sure I saw her on the tenniscourt not an hour since she mutteredto her hostess as after proper expressions of sympathy and regret theyretrained the roadwavWell she hasnt been looking wellfor some days said Mrs Grafton andits quite possible she is illThe schoolmates had been housed together only a few days before MrsGrafton became convinced that Fannysdevotions were rapidly waning thatwith recovering health and bloom andspirits the crying need for the one dearfriend to lean on had vanished Lessand less grew the hours of confidentialchat More and more was the late disconsolate widow becoming interestednot to say absorbed in the details ofgarrison life Freeman formerly ofthe th but now a squadron commander at Sedgwick remarked thatthe lady was beginning to take noticeuncommonly eariy and Minturn withwhom she was quite ready to walk andeven to visit the tennis court was heardto ask if they never had such things ashalf mourning hops Whittaker whowas sulky about something and preternaturally stately as a consequencereminded him that Mrs McLane wasstill in deep mourning full mourningthat he only wished that other fullscould be as lightly worn She mayhave been in the depths of woe beforeshe left Chicago as Mrs Grafton de-come to an end and with them the j clares she was said Mrs Buxton atan spirited piroquetters dropped finally out of sight- i SunWit en ltK NeeeesuryHeres an article for women hesaid on How to Make Yourself

sheniarriesNr doubt he was as she said vmean old thing Chicago Postlady with years of experiences butshes bravely overit soon enough Shellbo dancing next And this unchristian uncharitable remark was calledforth by the sight of the lady going toride with Whittaker Whittaker whoat first could be induced to calland who now could hardly be inducedto believe it time to goAnd of course before she had beenat the post a week everybody knewthat this was the woman to whom Merriam was at least believed to be engaged two years before anded to the thrilling interest of the situartion For a little while it had beenquite a problem how to entertain herShe didnt go to dances or dinnersShe could perhaps ride and play tennis but tennis she did not care forRiding was unpleasant because therewere no winding wood roads no elasticturf The mesa was pebbly or sandyby turns the canyon narrow the roadsdusty Ladies lunches very veryquiet and informal she consented toattent but she did not care for lunchesThe women presently declared she didnot care for womenThe men especially Minturn andWhittaker had early become devotedto her and there could be no doubt ofher powers of fascination The gunnerand the trooper grew cold and constrained in their manner toward eachother and Whittaker quit going as gohe used to day and night to Haynes orMerriams The colonels wife dyingto be hospitable had urged a littlequiet home dinner Just yourselfyour friends the Graftons and Merriams and say Mr Minturn Mrs Grafton assured the kind army woman thatMrs McLane would not think of accepting Mrs McLane amazed her hostess by eventually saying yesSince the Tuesday evening- of theircall not once had the Merriams heldconversation with the widow Shecalled as has been seen and Mrs Merriam had to be excused Mrs Merriamused to love tennis but quit the gameas soon as Mrs McLane began comingto the court Mrs Merriam who usedto love to ride with Randy had discontinued it a day or two after that alleged illness as though to carry outthe illusion but by the Thursday sheagain appeared in the saddle and galloped out upon the mesa by her husbands side Returning they met MrsMcLane just starting out with her gunner friend and the ice had to be brokenThe stylishly habited widow beamedon both beg ged Floy to let hor knowat what hour they would ride next dayas she adored it of all things and nextday Floys horse was reported deadlame and she would ride no otherWhen Mrs Colonels invitation came forthat utterly unlooked for dinner theMerriams were cornered for Floythough looking sallow and heavy eyednow was not really ill and could urge noexcuse Garrison dinner bids must beanswered as promptly as those in citylife Weve got to go dear said Merriam calml so send our acceptanceI wont go said Floy to herself asshe penned and signed the little noteand when Saturday came she was tooill to leave her bed Mrs Ffajne cameto minister to and sit with her TheFreemans were bidden instead andMrs Freeman could have stampedher pretty foot in vexation for neithershe nor her lord thoug ht it the properthing for Mrs McLane to be going todinners so early in her widowhood besides there were other reasonsThe dinner came oft however andwas a dismal feast with a dramatic conclusionAs has been shown only twice hadMrs McLane bad speech with Merriamduring the seven days and both timesit was in presence of his wife TheGraftons Havnes and Freemans weredelighted with him as a consequenceand rejoiced in secret over her Butnot a whit did the widow show disappointment or discomfiture She wasamply entertained apparently withthe increasing devotions of Minturnand Whittaker and the latter spenttwo miserable hours this Saturdayevening in jealous contemplation of hisown outcast lot and Minturns presumable bliss Yet the colonel could nothave both to dinner so Mrs Colonelwas allowed to decide and her preference was for the artilleryman TheGraftons went with rather bad graceMrs Grafton warning her guest thatthe whole garrison would be talkingof her inconstancy but as Ned Parryremarked on a previous occasion Fanhad had her own way ever since she cuther first tooth and did not propose tobe ruled nowAlmost the last words Mr McLanewhispered said she indignantlywere to implore me not to waste myyouth in vain lamentation Life is tooshort to be spent in tears were hisvery words and evidently the widowwas here in full sympathy with theexpressed or reported views of thedear departed She went She lookeduncommonly pretty in a gown of deepest most somber and most expensivecrape bhe sat at the colonels rightand made eves at him all through dinner leaving Minturn on herrighttosulk and scowl and seek comfort in thecommandants champagne Fanny herself partook not too sparingly of thisseductive fluid and was sparkling withanimation and good spirits when justbefore coffee was served just as thetrumpets were sounding tattoo out onthe moonlit parade a servant came andwhispered to the master of the houseTell him Im at dinner and cant seehim nowThe servant vanished then reappeared bent and whispered againTell him Im at dinner and wontsee him now said the colonel not unwilling to impress on his fair guest theidea of his professional importance andpersonal force The servant bent andwhispered again whereat the colonel-to which a cynic in shoulderstraps changed color and glanced up uncerwho happened to be present repliedtainly in the troubled face of the messenger then as uncertainly around thetable his eyes only for an instant meeting those of his guestWill you excuse me a moment mydear he said to his wife and left thetable and the roomConversation went on somewhat constrainedly Mrs McLane intent onfascinating the colonel had rather ignored the rest Minturn was plainly inthe sulks and Mrs Colonel with anxiety in her eyes was plainly listeningto the hurried talk in the outer roomPresently in came the servant WouldCapt Grafton please join the colonelin the parlor and wondering- GraftonwentIts ihat dreadful telegraph operator said Mrs Colonel in a lowtroubled tone Its some bad newsIndian outbreak probably or hednever be so insistentThen all conversation seemed to dragand people only spoke in monosyllablesor hazarded v some guess as to whatcould be the matterBut it wasnt Indians It wasnt warfare It was only the soldier telegrapher at the post who bore with hima message which the operator at theJunction had received positive instructions from the eastern manager to deliver at once and report delivery andget an answer It was for Mrs McLaneSo there was nothing- for it but to callher and with sudden panic in her eyesshe hurried into the parlor shrankfor a moment from the proffered dispatch then with an effort at self-controltook it tore it open read with dilated eyes lifted her hand to her faceas though in bewilderment and dismaystaring into vacancy as she did so andthen suddenly without a moan withouta sound from her lips went down in alimp heap upon thebearskin rug whereon she stood and the ladies rushed tobut could not revive herFull half an hour they labored overher The messenger had dashed forthe doctor and brought him to thescene Grafton had rescued the paperjust as it seemed about to flutter intothe fireplace folding- and stowing itaway in his coat pocket and not untilafter ten did she seem to recover consciousness not until near the sounding of taps could they bear her homeand then the messenger came backThe operator at the Junction said theymust have report of the receipt of themessage and some answer this wasimperative Grafton appealed to thedoctor The doctor said Mrs McLanewas only semi conscious and could answer nothing- She is your guest manRead the dispatch and reply as best 3oucan Whatever its contents they haveshocked her seriouslyAnd so finally Grafton read the message and could fathom only aportion ofits meaningArrested Chicago Your uncle strickenparalysis You will be summonedSecure papers otherwise lose everythingC MCHAPTER IXThree days after the colonels dinner Mrs McLane was pronounced sufficiently well to take the open air butdid not not look sufficiently well inher own opinion to take the hint Nordid Mrs Grafton too eagerly urge Bythis time the hostess was fully convinced that Fanny was far from beingthe frank confiding creature she hadpictured herself to be that she hadcome to Sedgwick with other purposesin view than that of seeking the sympathy and counsel of her erstwhileschoolmate that she was concealingfrom her to whom she once longed tounbosom her every thought some vitaland thrilling circumstance and wrorstShe rushed out after himof all that Capt Graiton now knewwhat it was and wouldnt tell Thisperhaps was almost unpardonable Invain had Mrs Grafton insinuated inquired

to theheart from which it sprung She wascharity itself and a wonderful organizer of charitable relief on a large scaleIt is said that she gave out of her ownpocket a good fifth of the annualamount granted to her by parliamentand a story vouched for by the StJames Budget shows that she knewhow to give on a small scale to be generous in mind as well as with moneyThere were to be some festivities atWhite Lodge the Richmond residenceof the duchess and an invitation wassent to the secretary of a charity inwhich the duchess was interested Bya later post the young- lady received aletter from a

in whichthe writer declared to her friend thatshe was very sorry she could not cometo tennis because Stout Mary hadasked her to White Lodge and she wasbound to goThe day duly arrived and the frankyoung lady was warmly welcomed bythe duchess who afterward took heraside and laughingly saidMy dear girl I know I am stout butI cannot help it You should be morecareful in posting your letters

gardens in Germany are to be found between Potsdam and Berlin It is however in the cherry orchards of Werderthat the suburban resident makes hismost confident appeal They areplanted on the slopes of sandy dunesand the slory of their blossom in springand the fruits of their flower in summer are due to the most careful cultivation and parental indulgence of thesoil The whole great mass of cherrytrees consists of a forest of dwarfs cutso low that the branches almost touchThe ground and the ripening fruitgathers the full benefit of the reflected heat of the sand The groundabout the roots
