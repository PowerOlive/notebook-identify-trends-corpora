But it can not be cured by sprays
washes and inhaling mixtures which
reach only the surface The disease is
in the blood and can only be reached
through the blood S S S is the only
remedy which can have any effect upon
Catarrh it cures the disease perma

Not Incurable
writes I was af
flicted from infancy
with Catarrh and no
one can know the
suffering it produces
better than 1 The
sprays and washes
prescribed by the doc
tors relieved me only
temporarily and
though I used them
constantly for ten years the disease had a
firmer hold than ever I tried a number oi
blood remedies but their mineral ingredients
settled in my bones and gave me rheumatism
I was in a lamentable condition and after ex
hausting all treatment was declared incurable
Seeing S S S advertised as a cure for blood
diseases I decided to try it As soon as my
system was under the effect of the medicine
I began to improve and after taking it for
two months I was cured completely the
dreadful disease was eradicated from my sys
tem and I have had no return of it
Many have been taking local treat
ment for years and find themselves
worse now than ever A trial of
Blood
will prove it to be the right remedy
for Catarrh It will cure the most ob
stinate case

A druggist in Macon Ga says 1
have sold a large quantity of Mothers
Friend and have never known an in
stance where it has failed to produce the
good results claimed for it All women
agree that it makes labor shorter and less
painful
Mothers Friend
is not a chance remedy Its good effects
are readily experienced by all expectant
mothers who use it Years ago it passed
the experimental stage While it always
shortens labor and lessens the pains of
delivery it is also o the greatest benefil
during the earlier months of pregnancy
Morning sickness and nervousness are
readily overcome and the liniment relaxes
the strained muscles permitting them to
expand without causing distress Mothers
Friend gives great recuperative power to
the mother and her recovery is sure and
rapid Danger from rising and s lied
breasts is done away with completely
