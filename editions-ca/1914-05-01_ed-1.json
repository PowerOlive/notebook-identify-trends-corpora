me becond team of Transylvania
University lost an exciting game of
baseball with the Millersburg Military
Institute here by the score of 8 to 1.
Good team work, coolness in tight
places, and efficient and timely bat
ting were responsible for the victory
of the cadets, while the lack of these
things on the part of the collegians
were the chief factors in creating the
large score.' Smith pitched good ball
throughout the' game and was sup
ported in fine style by his team, Fogg,
Allen and Keyser playing especially
well. For the visitors Robertson and
Arnett played splendid ball.

For general information, historical
and geographical, reinforced by clear,
accurate maps, those who are follow
ing events in our present crisis could
do no better than turn to "Terry's
Mexico," a handbook by T. Phillip
Teny, published by Houghton-Mifflin
Company. "Terry's Mexico" is not a
book of hasty impressions; it is a
compendium of exact information
taold in practical and interesting fash
ion. The chapter oh Vera Cruz, is
just now Of peculiar interest. This
city was namGd La Villa Rica de la
Vera Cruz, ("The rich Town of the
True Cross") by Hernando Cortes,
who anchored in the roadstead April
21, 1519, and landed the following day,
which was Good Friday. Almost im
mediately the settlement was moved
inland, but in 1599 Gaspar de Zuniga,
Viceroy of Mexico and Count of Mon
terey, ordeied the town removed to
the original site. For many years the
present town was called New Vera
Cruz to differentiate it from the old
abandoned town. Until the middle of i
the last century a high stone wall sur-'
rounded the port, completely exclud-,
ing the purifying sea breezes and ren-1
dering it one of the most unhealthy
spots on the Gulf Coast. Few cities
have suffered more heart-breaking
trials. It has been repeatedly sacked
by buccaneers, bombarded by foreign
fleets, scourged by cholera and yellow
fever, torn by internecine stnie, ana
buffeted and wrecked by hurricanes.
At the close of the Mexican war for
independence (1821) the Spanish
troops subjected the port to such a
terrifiic bombardment that it was al
most ground to powder. In 1838 both
the town and castle were attacked by
the French, and in 1847 both again
suffered a cannonading by the Ameri
can forces under the command of Gen-
