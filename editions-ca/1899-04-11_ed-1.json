There is not the slightest doubt that the
doctors do more harm than good in treating
Contagious Blood Poison many victims of
this loathsome disease would be much better
off to day if they had never allowed them
selves to be dosed on mercury and potash the
only remedies which the doctors ever give for
blood poison
The doctors are whollv unable to get rid of
his vilf poison and onlv attempt to heal up the outward appearance of the
the sores and eruptions This they do by driving the poison into the
yrtem and endeavor to keep it shut in with their constant doses of potash
aaafd mercury The mouth and throat and other delicate parts then break out
OB -sores and the fight is continued indefinitely the drugs doing the system

To carry the name farther back it is
alleged by the Irish genealogists that
Fenius Farsaidh was a schoolmaster as
