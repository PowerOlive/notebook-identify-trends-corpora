WOTTLD HAT WAR "GOSSIP.
(Rocky Mountain News.)
In some of the knitting circles of
the country a rule has been estab
lished that when a knitter speaks
concerning anything except the' work
in ha-nd she must pay a fine of 5
cents. We think this is altogether
too hard !a rule and that it should
be modified to- the extent of making
an offender pay only when she 'gos
sips about something which may
hurt the country a-nd help the enemy.
Several of the departments of tlie
Government, as they- are constituted
in war time, are bending their efforts
to stop the kind of gossip which hurts
the cause of the country. - The ladies
with the usual God bless them
have been offenders In this respect,
while the men, without any particu
lar blessing for them, have kept them
tongue clacking company. The Com
mitte on Public Information, which
also is an American Propaganda
Cojmmittee, has felt; it necessary to
urge and urge again that no de
pressing stories be told in sewing cir
cles or elsewhere, and that no heart
be allowed to tire, even though its
beating keeps time to the needle
clicking off ten miles of knitting.

One of the favorite excuses of the
German military critics for the de
feats which the German army is suf
fering is that the German command
miscalculated the number of Foch's
reserves and some of them say plain
ly that the high conlmand underesti
mated the extent " of the American
contribution to that reserve.
In this country it has been the
theory all along that the German
army heaquarters knew all about the
Americans and had them counted to
the man. The stories they told the
German people about the insignifi
cance of American intervention were
set dow.n as, deliberate falsehoods
designed to keep -up the spirit of the
nation. .
Is it really true that Hindenburg
and Ludendorff were deceived and
that they did not believe the United
States could land or had landed an
anmy in Fran'ce?
If so, then who has been lying to
Hindenburg and Ludendorff?
and county who heard with sincere
regret the news of his death.

and Mrs. W. 0. Butler, five brothers,

(Pittsburg Gazette Times.)
Though the German Emperor sur
passed himself in hypocrisy when ad
dressing the workmen at the Krupp
munitions factories, his speech con-1
tained much that should be weighed
by every American. At the bottom
the Kaiser pleaded with labor of all
kinds to stand behind his' armies and
exert themselves to the last ounce of
their power that victory might be
achieved by the German sword. He
confessed absolute dependence of the
country ondte loyal workmen. If
they fail for, any reason to perform
their allotted tasks Germany will lose
the war. How' serious is the urirest
ajmong the workers may be judged
from the appearance of the Kaiser in
the shops. What effect his plea will
have remains to be demonstrated.
But the fact for our contemplation is
that, exactly to the extent that the
German arjmies depend on the sup
port of all kinds of Tabor at home, so
do the American armies depend on
labor in the United States to back
them up and make it possible for
thejm to drive on against the enemy
until he is crushed. We are all war
workers, however we may be placed,
or we are disloyal. It is country
against country, people against peo
ple. Every American must do his
part toward winning the war or he
will help Germany win it. ;

Spanish 'influenza claimed an
other Bourbon County soldier at
Camp Taylor, Sunday, when the life
of Harry H. Ghinn, Jr., of near Cen

rifice in the service of his country.
Young Chinn was a son of Mr. and
Mrs. Harvey H. Chinn, of Jackson
ville, and a young man of great
promise. He had been engaged in
farming before being called to the
colors to which he responded with a
glad heart and a willing, patriotic
purpose. He was a member of one
of the Bourbon County draft con
tingents which went early in the
Spring to Camp Taylor, and was in
active training for overseas service
when stricken with influenza.
The body was brought to Paris
Tuesday afternoon, and taken to the
