WORK ON NATURAL GAS
PIPE LINE BEGINS MONDAY.
The first dirt toward the laying of
natural gas pipe line into this city by
the Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co.,
was turned yesterday, when a force of
about fifteen men began work on the
Clintonville pike in the neighborhood
of the warehouse of the American To
bacco Company.
One car of an eighteen car shipment
nf material to be used in extending
ithe line to this city arrived yesterday
and was unloaded on the ground. The
bills of lading for the other mater
ial have been received and it is ex
pected to arrive in the next few days.
It is the purpose of the Central Ken
tucky Natural Gas Co. to push the
work with all possible haste, working a
force of men from the Clark county
line to the Bourbon capital to meet
half way between the two points. The
workmen from this end are laying the
line south on the Clintonville pike.
This indicates that natural gas will
more than likely be turned into Paris
this fall.

A Refrigerator Substitute.
Anyone who cannot afford a refrig-
erator will find this a good substitute:
If you have a good cellar, procure a
box, the larger the better; knock the
bottom out, then dig a hole in the cel
lar just large enough for the box and
fit in. About twice a week clean it
out, strew borax around, and you will
find everything nice and cool.
