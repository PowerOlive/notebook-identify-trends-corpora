Manifesto Issued by the Council of theSo Called Provisional Government AuOrder to Military CommandersSantiago de Cuba Sept 15 Thecouncil of the so called provisionalgovernment of the republic of Cubamet at Santa Cruz on September 1 andformulated a manifesto to the Cubanpeople with an order to the militarycommanders of the Cuban army bothof which have been promulgatedThe manifesto touches on the history of the movement for Cuban independence and the principles uponwhich the Cuban people have foughtfor their liberty It proceeds in partsas followsThough the principal object of our revolution has been obtained that is the destruction of Spanish domination the work of thiscouncil is not yet at an end for the Cuban republic the ideal for which we have foughthas not yet been constituted Now that hostilities have ceased and Spain has renouncedher sovereignty it is the duty of this councilto set before the Cuban people the feelingsand purposes of the men who made the revolutionWe always felt confident that through ourown perseverance we would in the long rundestroy Spanish domination but we must acknowledge that an indefinite prolongation ofthe struggle would have annihilated the littlethat was left of our wealth and populationThe entrance upon the field of a powerful anddecisive factor upon which we have alwaysrelied and toward which the hearts of all Cubans have always turned has put an end to thehorrors of war to the benefit of all concernedThis prompt solution we must acknowledgewe could never have obtained It is proper toacknowledge the evident truth This is thebest title the United States has to our gratitude We were abandoned by the world somenations ignoring us through selfishnessothers ignorant of our real condition considering us an obstinate and ungovernable people because we did not accept the cajoleriesand flatteries with which Spain tried to sootheour just angerThis was our situation when the people ofthe United States their government and congress came to our rescue and took upon theirshoulders the task of delivering us at oncefrom an unbearable yoke as our sufferingscould not be endured or permitted longerThey have accomplished their programmebrilliantly What is more they have liberatedin one way or another from the rule of Spainall peoples oppressed by her The liberationis definite and irrevocable Spain has beenexpeled from this hemisphereWe are grateful In nations as well as inindividuals gratitude is ennobling As we begin now our national life we more than anyother people mast be jealous of our nationalhonor It is therefore the duty of this councilto explain to the people of Cuba what in itsopinion are our duties toward the UnitedStates and towards ouselves and what are therules that ought to direct our conductWhen after a long struggle the UnitedStates congress recognized the right of thepeople of Cuba to be free and independent andordered the Spanish forces to withdraw fromthe island no Cuban government was recognized but the one we had constituted thoughnot recognized was not opposed and has notbeen opposed No steps have been taken todislodge it from the place where it exercisedits functions nor has it been considered an illegitimate authority which events have dissolved or destroyed for the good of the peopleof CubaIt could not be otherwise The UnitedStates could not interfere in our struggle forthe sake of what our enemies might considera political faction The American governmentcould intervene for the benefit of the wholepeople of Cuba a part of whom being underSpanish rule was not free to express a purpose or a preference The intention of theUnited States was that as soon as the obstacle of Spanish rule had been removed thewhole Cuban people should choose a government that would shape the destinies of theislandThe people of the United States have all alongappreciated the fact that the majority of thepeople of Cuba is in agreement with our prinsiples for the motto of the United States government has been the same as our own absolute independence of Cuba Under these conditions the Americans could not take a hostileattitude toward us or consider our authority illegitimate and harmful to the welfare of theCuban peopleThese considerations have convinced usthat we should not dissolve and that the powers we have received from an assembly electedby the people under arms should not vanishOn the contrary we feel that we should remainas a nucleus and guide for those who havevested such power in usWe have therefore decided to call togetheranother assembly which will determine ourfuture courseIn conclusion the manifesto gives a numberof reasons why the proposed assembly shouldbe convened and some government or anotherchosen not with the character of a government as yet but as an official representationof those Cubans who fought against Spain andof those who in the cities under Spains control and in foreign countries have helped andsupported themSPAIN ACCEPTS THE TERMSJioth Houses of Parliament Pass the BillAccepting the Protocol and the QueenRegent Signs the DocumentWashington Sept 15 In officialquarters much satisfaction

and genial frameof mind one moment before all thewrath which had been battened downfor the past 12 months blazed up inside me before Jane had finished announcing him and I smiled uporahimIt was generally understood amongmy friends and acquaintances and relations that I suffered a secret and unceasing pang of hopeless love aftermy Cousin George changed his mindand delicatel3r refused the honor ofmy hand and perhaps the only ray ofcomfort which slanted mv Avay camefrom the inner knowledge which Imight hug to myself that it wasnttrue that I had not a spark of hopeless love in me that the onlv stroncrfeeling I had in the matter and naturally enough too was the one whichfound expression inthe words uttered quite privately to myself Allright Cousin George you just wait abit And I think I didnt look quiteas pretty as usual us I murmuredthemOF course if I had been offered toCousin George and he had not wishedto possess me that would have beenanother matter and I should havebeen the last to blame him but theway in which he philandered roundi d pestered me when he came homeirom Heidelberg nearly four yearsago became more than a joke it became absolutely absorbing I hadnteven time to mend my frocks for Ididnt like to bring a whole shabbyskirt into the drawing room to bindthe bottom of it while he sat andlooked at me so I used to do sillysmall things such as darning threecornered rents in my pocket handkerchiefs where 1 had hitched them onto the bushes and such like thingsI should never have dreamed of doing at all if he had not been thereHe proposed to me five times whichI thought a jity each time he did itand his proposals used to make nitvery hot and exhausted They wereall made in June and generally in thesun Cousin George never had muchidea of the fitness of things and I sosoon came to the end of all I had tosay that T was at a disadvantage andquite as uncomfortable sitting thereand saying nothing whereas CousinGeorge seemed to be able to prattleon forever1 dont know why I did it but thefifth time Cousin George grew whiteabout the lips and finished up asusual by saying Will you marry meFlo I said Oh well I dont mindif I do And really I didnt mind-for I had known Cousin George foryears and years and was very fondof him and I felt that at any rateit would put an end to his proposalsand Aunt Theresa said that July wasgoing- to be very liotWell anyhow whether it was rightor wrong or stupid or sensible I saidstraight out I dont mind if I doand then of course we were engagedreally did not mind it at all for Iknew Cousin George so we and heknew me and there was no botherabout rearranging ones ideas and habits as some girls have to just to pleasethe man theyre going to marry 1used to look at him sometimes whenhe didnt happen to be looking at meand say to myself Well to thinkthat thats the man Im going tomarry I f or it really did seem oddbutx 1 wasnt at all upset about it andafter awhile I decided that it wasreally a most comfortable arrangement and that it was probably allnonsense that height of bliss andoverwhelming happiness sort oftufF that some persons talk and writeaboutjI was very jnatter of fact at firstbut when poor George chafed at thatJ did my best to play up to my partI never could imagine why personscoiildnvt go on just as usual instead ofslinking off just likesilly children Helling secrets butGeorge seemed to like It and by degrees 1 got on capitally I really triedhard to do as other engaged girls didI dont mean to say that I had to tryhard because it was irksome to meI really did not object to it only Iwas apt to forget sometimes However in less than a month I broke myself of tugging away from him andlooking bothered or resentful when hekissed me and when we had had atiff I was always ready to be friendsagain In tjhose days when we hadhad a tiff and hadgrown tirea oisparring George always used to saLet us go down the river to the island And I always went The island always meant making up ourquarrels again and being more devotedto one another than usual and Georgeadmitted that I never bore malice inmy hearjSo the months went on and Georgehad to go away and I grew much fonder of him then and I dont think Iwould have cared to change him forany other man I knew as a fianceeand I used to write such lovely lettersto him I used to think out sentencesin the night little remarks I knewhed like to get from me I really wasvery attentive to him Ive nothing toreproach myself with on that scoreAnd so things went onAnd then after awhile when Georgehad been gone some time his letterschanged and he seemed rathertroubled about something I didnttake much notice of it I just thoughtthat perhaps the climate didnt suithim and once I took the trouble tocopy out and send to him a recipewhich I had heard was good for oneif one felt irritableHut nothing seemed to cheer Georgeand at length when I was reallj beginning to grow troubled about histemper I had a letter from him tosay he thought we had better sayGood by he thought it was his dutyto me to say so he felt that we weif you please had made a mistakehe could never hope to be worthy ofme his modesty was somewhat newetc a whole heap of itI wrote back and said Oh verywell I expect you know best ButI was really awfully angry and whatmade me angrier than anything elsewas the thought that neither he noranyone else really knew how hard Ihad found it to play the sweetheartpart of the arrangement to Georgeand that I hadnt wanted to be engaged at alL Of course they allthought that I was secretly wearingthe willow and the livelier I becameas the days passed by the more compassionately my relations looked atme Shes overacting poor dearthey were thinking Im fairly placidas a rule but my wrath did simmerup at times and I did think a fewstrong thoughts of GeorgeAs I said just now my wrath blazedout strong as ever when Jane openedthe door this afternoon and announced Cousin George his very selfand T smiled straight into his face andtalked away without a momentsawkwardness and said how glad I wasto see him which was true Heseemed rather uneas3r and not in verygood spirits perhaps he was a tinybit ashamed of himself in spite of mjfriendly manner But I made him sitdown and I talked on blandly anddidnt shirk a thing I told him abputevery person and every place we hadseen and known together and I positively dallied over the subject of hislong absence and the summer beforehis departure I did it chiefly to proveto Trim that memories were nothing toine that was mere justice to myselfbut I did see him grip his hands nowand then and his lips grew white justas they used to do when he kept onproposingHe didnt talk very much on theAvhole he answered my questions witha good many monosyllables but nowand then he would dash into conversation with a strange sounding voiceAnd I played off my dimple recklesslyand felt so glad that my frock was extremely becomingAt length there came a pause in ourconversation and thenI feigned another mood and I made up my mindthat I would not break the silenceCousin Georgesat and breathed hardfor a minute or two and then I suppose he decided on breaking downihe artificiality of our interview forhe got up from his chair and strodeabout I looked out of windowand pretended to be pensive At lasthe stopped beside me and said FloI looked up at him and laughedCousin George I said with mocksolemnityDont laugh he said drawing backhis lipI must I said when you look soseriousI am serious he declaredwont you f oreriveForgive I repeated wrinkling mybrow

Review HesaysFrom our own experience in performing statute labor a few yearsago it was anj thing else but a busytask Those who engaged in this workdid not busy themselves so much intrj ing to do a

guide people in performingstatute labor to day or not we are notprepared to state definitely We fancy however that a great deal of it isperformed in the same dont care andhalf hearted wayIt may be perhaps that the agitation in behalf of good roads duringthe past ten years has had the effectof imbuing those to whom the task ofperforming statute labor in this country is committed with more patrioticzeal and a desire to do theirutmost tosecure better roads and that insteadof a desire to do his share of the workat as little sacrifice to himself as possible everyone who performs

taken together to thecreamery in the same can the milkwill most assuredly be in bad condition wheii it reaches the separatorThe cause of the bad condition is ofcourse the same as given above lack ofcooling and aeration before startingbut the action seems to be intensifiedby placing warm milk in with the coldThis seems to be due to the fact thatin every case bacterial formation willhave established itself in the nichtsmilk and the addition of the warmmilk increases the growth of these undesirable elements very rapidlyFarmers ReviewSalting Cows RegularlyNow that cows are turned out topasture care should be taken to givethem regular supplies of salt Thebest way is to place some rock salt ina sheltered place where they can lickit at will Some salt is found by analysis in milk It is a curious fact that solong as the calls food is chiefly milkit has no craving for salt This craving begins when the calf begins toeat grass and other egetables all ofwhich require some s alt to aid

was a fire In such a casein an isolated hamlet each ought tohelp his neighbor and in fact all theable bodied inhabitants of the placehastened toward the structure inflames a carriage house with groundfloor and forage lofts Five hundredmen were soon gathered thereAmong them a retired officer a manof cool head and authority known toeverybody became naturally the chiefMy village possesses a fire engine butthis engine has no suction hose Itmust be filled with buckets Severalbasins were in the A icinity The commander chose one and disposed usrapidly in twTo files one for the fullbuckets and one for the empty andthe double chain thus formed the engine began its regular functions Thiscontinued about half an hour Orderswere executed promptly and silentlythe work was marvelous and the firegrew feebleAll at once from one side came agreat noise of horses at a gallop andoll of rushing wheels and almost immediately the same fracas resoundedfrom the other side It was the engines from the two neighboring townsThey arrived carrying their equipment of firemen It was sublimeThere were the heroic grocers the important butchers and the majesticbakers They had retained their ordinary costumes But they wore thecasque a gorgeous glittering ornamented helmet worn alike by the firemen of London Paris and Rome Andunder this martial headpiece theywere of ferocious visage and of nobleattitude They recognized thegrandeur of their mission I will neverforget the imperious figure the terrible eyes and the frowning brows ofthe butcher who drove the first vehicleNo Roman consul on the car of triumph drawn by four white horses wasmore sculptural than this honorabletradesman And his peers yielded himnothing Their heroism absorbedthem to such a Qoint that they seemedblind and deaf At once they threwtheir teams into the midst of the chainwhich was broken up In their tumultuous unloading we were dispersedThey ran here and there demandingwith great cries where the water was-but not listening to the responsesWhen they had finally comprehendedthat several basins existed a memorable question arose These would useone reservoir those wished to use theother Some insults were exchangedmenacing pantomiises were perceived Our commander tried to establish order and to reconstitute hischain of buckets But the newcomerswould not recognize him and had noreason to obej him He did not weareven a casque Could anybody talk tothem of a chain when they had hoseFor they had some hose The gendarmes came in from various directions They begged one group afteranother to go away but as the firemenwere of equal rank they persisted intheir disaccord Numerous curiouspeople hastened up there were nowseveral hundred there All of themoffered counsel spouted howledswore were angry and hustled eachother It was the second act ofMaitres ChanteursMeanwhile the fire which had beenput out peaceably resumedbusiness the flames had reappearedand rose into the night The wholestable burned A good hour hadslipped by in this manner Then Jlttle by little calm was restored andmen ceased to insult each other Goodfeeling was restored They understood themselves Half an hour laterand they were able to act The hosethe precious hose was placed Andthey commenced to vanquish the fireut a good part of the building wasin ashes which might have yet remained intact but for the benevolentmeeting of
