test subscription receipt book and com
mence work among your friends. You
willjJbeTsurprisedlto learn how 'easily
you can pile up thousands of votes be
tween now and the.close of the contest
and you can easily win a place that
will entitle you to one of the valuable
prizes.
Remember that this contest is just
an infant as yet'and,that no onehas a
start that cannot be" easily overcome.
The contest does not close for some
weeks to come. That's a long while
and the preliminary skirmish has not
yet commenced, to say nothing ot the
real battle. Send your name in today
and be ready for the fray. Get your
complete'equipment, a goodly supply
of ammunition, plan your campaign and
then go out and "engage the enemy.'7
Take him prisoner and make him ran
som himselfwith a year's subscription
to the "Bourbon News. He'll do it,
cheerfully, when he finds that you
mean business and intend to land one
of those big Drizes.
A MISUNDERSTANDING.
There is some little misunderstand
ing as to herevotes may, be gotten in
this contest. Subscriptions may be se
cured anywhere. Candidates arenct
confined to their districts or to the two
districts. They may sacure subscrip
ions anywhere that the mail will take
them at the regular newspaper rate.
No matter where the subscriptions
come from, if they are accompanied by
the money, votes will be issued in ac
cordance with the scale.
LET YOUR FRIENDS KNOW.
There is nothing to be ashamed of
in this contest. If you are going to be
a candidate, be one. Don't place your
self on record as being in the recep
tive class. SAnyone of the prizes are
well worth the time and effort it will
require to wiXthem. Active, agrges
sive, concentrated,energy is the fabric
of which success is woven, and so far
as known there is no determined Co
lumbusjlooking around in dark corners
to discover concealed talent and force
fulness. Come out in the open and be
a candidate with all your heart. Let
your friendsknow'it, and they'll get
their friends know it. All of which
means that the other contestants are
bound to know it when they come to
soliciting those friends you have al
ready seen.
Regrets for the mistakes of yester
day are vain and constitute a large
partof the stockjn trade of the weak
ling: "I'll doittomorrow" is a laud
able spirit, but "do it now" is much
better and the essence of wisdom. So
get busy RIGHT NOW.
