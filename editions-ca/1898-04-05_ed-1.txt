Were Iost By theSudden Onslaught of Waters HousesFloating With Their OccupantsClinging to Their HoofsXouisville Ky April 4 A specialio the Courier Journal from EvansvilleInd saysAt G oclock Sunday afternoon thelevee at Shawneetown 111 broke amile above the town and from all theinformation that can be secured hereit- is learned that a great part of theplace has been destroyed and that perhaps a large number of citizens havebeen drownedShawneetown is 75 miles belowEvansville on the Ohio river It issituated in a valley of extremely lowland with hills skirting it in the rearand with a 25 foot levee in front running from hill to hilL The town is-very much in the position of a fortified city and when the levee gave waya mile above town under the pressureof the very high river the water shotthrough a 20 foot opening and struckthe place like a hurricane sweepingeverything before itHouses were turned and tossedabout like boxes The people were notwarned of the break and for that reason so many were caught Those athome sought refuge in second storiesand on housetops Those in the streetsAvere carried before the avalanche ofwater and probably a majority weredrownedCitizens came from the place by-skiffs to a telephone several milesaway and asked for aid from Evansville They said that more than 200people were drowned and they hadreason to believe it would reach 500or even 1000The water stands from 20 to 30 feetall over the townThere are of course no fire or lightsin the place and darkness envelopesthe desolate scene Consequently itimpossible for them to have anything like definite information Themen quickly left the telephone and no-communication has since been hadwith the placeAll telephone and telegraph wiresare now down and outside communication appears to be impossibleAt ten oclock Svmday night twosteamboats and a couple of tugs started for Shawneetown under full head ofsteam and it is expected that some ofthem will arrive there by two oclock inthe morning They carry large supplies of food and blankets quickly collected by the city officialsChicago April 4 A special to theEecord from Cypress Junction 111says Two hundred and fiftj personswere drowned Sunday by the inundation of Shawneetown six miles fromthis placeThe north levee broke at 420 oclockSunday afternoon and the Ohio riverflowed over the town many feet deepScores of houses were floating aboutSunday night and many persons were-clinging to the wreckage in the hopethat rescuers would soon appear withboats to take them to places of safetyAll communication with the town isVoir v Trains can not reach therenabteTephone and telegraph wires areownThe first report that reached herewas that the entire population hadbeen drowned but this is not confirmedThe levee was built by the government and was regarded as impregnable hence the people had taken noprecautions against a possible flood Itis reported that the flood now extendsfour miles inland and people are fleeing for their lives from the lowlandhamletsEa ruxgtox Ky April 4 At S45Sunday evening Superintendent W SMartin of the Henderson St Louisdivision of the Louisville Nashvillerailroad stationed at EvansvilleInd

LyndeBradley an expert electrician of thiscity has perfected plans for the use ofthe X ray on board war vessels and onthe field and in case of war will immediately enlist in the government service Mr Bradley saysthat while it would be a simplematter to bring the X ray intouse on a war ship that considerabledifficulty would be attached to the introduction of the machine on thefield A small engine boiler and dynamo would have to be mounted onwheels for field use and the X ray machine mounted on a carriage The apparatus however will be much lighterand more portable than may be imagined and his field apparatus could befurnished in a weekI have been thinking of this matterfor months said Mr Bradley Saturday but have waited for hostilitiesto begin before taking any activesteps The great help that the X Raywould be to surgeons lies in the quickeasy and painless method of locating abullet or splinter in a mans body afracture of a bone or other sexious injuryTORPEDO FLOTILLABeached the Cape Verd Island 2000Miles From Porto Rico on SaturdayMadrid April 4 The statementcabled Friday night that the torpedoflotilla of Spain has arrived at PortoRico was taken from a newspaperhere Investigation shows the announcement to be erroneous TheSpanish flotilla has arrived at theCape Verd islands and it is saidwill proceed after coalingWashington April 2 The announcement that the Spanish torpedoflotilla was at the Cape Verd islands off the west coast of Africa instead of at Porto Rico was receivedwith a good deaLof satisfaction at thenavy department which was withoutinformation of its own on the whereabouts of the flotilla The islands aremore than 2000 miles from Porto Ricoand it is the opinion of naval expertsthat at the very best ten or twelvedays would be the least time withinwhich they could make the run acrossROYAL FAMILYOf Spain Fears an Outbreak Unless theDifferences With the United States AreSoon SettledBerlin April 4 The German ambassador at Madrid Herr Von

PRESIDENTWilKRecommend Kccocrnition of Cuban Independence But Will Omit All Keferenceto Armed InterventionWashington April 4 A member ofthe senate commmittee on foreign relations who visited the president Sunday night after leaving the whitehouse stated that the message wouldbe sent to congress on Wednesday andthat it would recommend thetion of the independence of Cuba butomit aii reference to armed interventionThis it is believed will not be satisfactory to congress There is a suspicion that the president pursues thiscourse for the purpose of throwing theentire responsibility for whatnay follow on congressArmy Regiments Practically FullWashington April 4 Adj Gen Corbin Saturday pronounced absolutelyfalse the report circulated in New Yorkthat the war department had issuedorders to add 10000 men to the armyNo such orders he said had been issued or are contemplated The armyregiments are now practically fullwith the exception of a few men needed to fill companies to their full

in a FewDaysThis Delay Will Be Welcomed By Thoso inCharge of the War Preparations CanCongress Be Restrained Untilthe Message is IssuedWashington April 4 The opinionalmost universally held in WashingtonSunday night by leading public menand diplomats is that the crisis willreach its climax this week and thatthe question of war or peace will bedetermined within the next seven daysSenators and representatives met andconferred all day about the gravity oithe situation and at the white housethe president consulted with severalmembers of his cabinet and otherconfidential advisers regarding themessage which he is preparingto send to congress At the statewar and navy building active workwas going on and altogether it hasbeen a day of suppressed feelinsr Ncabsolute day yet announced when themessage is to be sent to congress andall that seemed to be absolutely certain Sunday night was that it wouldnot go in Monday Tuesday possiblybut more probably Wednesday or perhaps Thursday In addition to thephysical work of preparing thecomprehensive document upon whichthe president expects to rest Americas case with the world thereare other reasons why those in chargeof the war preparations will welcomeevery hours delay War material whichwe have ordered abroad is not yetshipped and the factories in this country which are running day and nightmaking powder and r jojectiles areanxious for delay Some of the factories in Connecticut with contractshave telegraphed Representative Hillurging all the delay possible Theysay every day now is preciousThere is still a divergence of opinionas to what the president will recommend in his message indeed thereseems to be still a question as towhether the president will make anyspecific recommendations Some ofhis most intimate friends however assert emphatically that his recommendations will be specific and vigorous andsuch that his party and country couldwillingly follow when he points theway One of these said that the president in his strong desire for peaceand his earnest hope that war mightpossibly be avoided was yielding somewhat to the sentiment of the leadersof his part3r and the country He hasnot given up hope yet that hostilitiesmay be averted There are those whobelieve the president has not yet madeup his mind as to the exact course hewill pursue and there seems to be aquestion as to whether the consularreports and the diplomatic correspondence is to be transmitted with themessageThe suspense caused by the necessary delay in the preparation of the message is very trying upon mermers ofboth houses and the most universallydiscussed question in WashinglonfSunday night was whether congressmanbe restrained until the messageliistransmitted All realize tlieidifficultand arduous rtask ofwwwwwwiiwriiini7orspection and the care which mustbe exercised and there seems to beno disposition to unduly hasten thepresident The party leaders are extremely anxious to avoid a breachwith the executive such as would occur if congress were to take the initiative After a careful canvas of thesituation Sunday they believe the radical republicans can be held in line afew days longer until Wednesday atleast The conference of republicansof the house who have been insistingupon prompt action hold anothermeeting Monday night Whilemany of them are now in favorof giving the president moreleeway than they were last week it isrealized that 25 republican votes inthe house would with the democraticand populist votes be sufficient to actIt can be pretty confidently assertedthat all the republicans of the housewith possibly exceptions which couldbe counted on the fingers of one handcan be controlled until WednesdayAfter that what might happen if thepresident asks for further delay isproblematical Mr Bromwell of Ohiofor instance who says he hopes he willnot be obliged to part company withthe president says he will vote withthe democrats if necessary to overrule the speaker after Wednesday MrCooper of Wisconsin has made a similar statement The republicans ofthe house committee on foreign affairshave held informal meetings Sundayand have practically agreed to reporta resolution of a tenor similar to thatagreed upon by the foreign relationscommittee of the senate SaturdayThe house resolutions will probablyfollow the language of those of thesenate regarding the blowing up of theMaineWashington April 4 The full senate committee on foreign relations haspractically agreed to accept the recommendation of the sub committee for aresolution recognizing the independence of Cuba and recommending armedintervention if necessary to secure itThis conclusion was reached aftera session Saturday that did not continue for more than an hour and sofar as can be learned there was no division of opinion expressed in thecommittee as to the propriety of thecourseM Zola FreeParis April 4 The court of Cassation has quashed the sentence of oneyears imprisonment and three thousand

heard that they have metagain Much good may it do themJackson responded with a sneer Thenhe went on And since you found myhiding place perhaps youll tell me-what you expect to gain by coming toit Have you arrived at your rightsenses againI have came the answerOh then you agree to give yourdaughter to me I thought you wouldcome to timeNo a thousand times no I havecome to have an accounting from youAccounting From me For whatI wonder Jackson asked with insolenceYou have broken our solemn agreement You have removedinot only yourshare of wha remains but also mineRestore it and you will not be injuredalthough we can never again resumeour compact Refuse to do so and Iwill crush youOh ho you will will you Howasked Jackson in derisive tonesBv denouncimr you Mr Morley replied sternlyNow that is useless and foolish talkLet us reason as between two businessmen said Jackson assuming a confidential style I want to marry yourdaughter At first you kept promisingme that I should do so All through thefive years of patient waiting for an opportunity to tup the vault you kept meto the job by that promise Lately yourefuse to fulfill your promise and yetyou now talk to me of breaking ouragreement Give me your daughterYou know she would be influenced byyour wishIt canrfbtbe t t t -And why not I know she doesntlike me but I love her and want hermore than anything on earth Shelldo as vou tell her vou know thatCome Ill give up not only your shareof wrhat remains but all my own I amrich now and dont need itAnd who made you richOh you did I dont deny it and youhave my thanks replied Jackson inmocking tones That last deal inwhich we were on opposite sides happened to tucn my way and I got thepile you dropped Thats my luck Ican give Tier as luxurious a home asshe has had Come old man be reasonableNever You cannot have her Shedespises you and her likes and dislikes have more weight with me thananything you could offer Thank Godshe will marry a better man than eithervou or meOh she will Not while I live Noshe shall marry no one if not me Jackson exclaimed in rageAnd you thought that removing thestolen bonds to some secret hiding placeof your own and thereby depriving meel my share would compel me to accede to your demand for my daughters hand asked Mr Morley in greatscornPartly that There was another reason too I had an idea that some onewas on our track and it was my purpose to throw proof on the one who wasuniversally considered the guilty part3rin case it became too hot for usToo hot for you quietly interposedMr MorleyNo for us Do you suppose I havebeen such a fool as to place myself socompletely in your power that my safety should depend on your whim Notmuch If I am found out be sure jougo down with me in spite of your highstanding and incorruptible honorJackson hissed out these words withvenomThis -conversation is fruitless Wewill change it remarked Mr Morleyin tones wherein great effort at selfcontrol was evident Now restore myportion of the bonds and you have myword that I will not molest you Refuse and Ill grind you down in the-dirt where you belongBluff all bluff exclaimed Jackson with a derisive laugh There wasa time when I was afraid of 3ou but notnow not now Youve been so very kindas to tell what youll do now let meave my say Youll give me youraughter or I will denounce you Youkn o w I can do it I hold absolute proof swhich will astonish the world you betDont answer just yet Think overwhat I am saying I know well I mustfall when you do My showing you upnecessarily includes that But youare such a senseless old fool in refusing me your daughter that it wouldbe a pleasure to show you up BesidesI do love Florence and if I cant haveher I dont care what happens to meThere must have been something iuMr Morley after this speech which disturbed Jackson for he gave vent to anervous laugh and backed away so thatI could not see himNow dont act like a fool old manand do anythingBefore Jackson could finish a pistolshot rang outThis was immediately followed bytwo other reports Mr Morley had evidently missed the first time and hissecond shot sounded simultaneouslywith Jacksons return fireThen Mr Morley staggered before thepassageway His arms were upraisedand the hands worked convulsivelyHe made a great effort to speak butno sound came from his lips except adeep groan as he fell forward fulllength And there he lay motionlesshis face resting on the hard floorIn a moment Jackson was bendingover him The look of horror of fearof dread in his face as he arose frombeside the prostrate body told a tale ofmurderWith nervous haste he picked up thepapers which had fallen from his handand throwing a hasty glance aroundseized the lantern and entered the passageway intent on instant flightToo horrified to think what course topursue I backed away from the doorand took a position near the stairsJackson entered the cook house cellar and placing the lantern upon thefloor closed the door Then he turnedand peered about The start he graveand the alarm on his face told me Iwas discovered He had his pistol stillin his hand and started to raise his -armNo no I cried keep that handdown He saw I had him covered with1 my revolver and he obeyed my command for the moment But I knew thathe was a desperate man and would nothesitate to throw his life away in tlieendeavor to escape Therefore I hastilyfollowed up the advantageYoull throw that pistol to me Ieontmued Instantly 3ou damnedvillain you murderer or as sure asHeavenBut my words were interrupted Hehad backed up against the door hiseyes staring fixedly at me There wasa movement of his arm and I was aboutto pull the trigger to forestall his purpose of firing at me when a reportsounded out from behind- him as heleaned against the wall and doorandwith a loud cry he sprang forwardcame down all in a heap rolled over onhis back and lajr there dead dead andby his own murderous device for guarding his hiding placeHurried footsteps were crossing theroom above and I hastily took up a newposition of defenseStop I yelled as the feet began todescend The stairs are covered by mypistolThere was a pause and a hurried consultation upon the landingIs that you down there Mr Conway inquired a voice which I recognizedYes it is and as I do not knowwhether you are an enemy or a friendMr Sonntag I guess I wont run anyrisk Youd better stay up You havemednypur powerv penned up here inJthis hole but if Ive got to die someone else goes with meAgain there was a hurried conversation in low tones between Sonntag andsome other party who I surmised wasSkinnerPerhaps yoti will not object to myapproach Nelson a voice called outas a second pair of legs came downWe are all friends true friends itcontinuedThere was something so familiar inthe sound of the voice that I hesitatedin again uttering a remonstranceWe are all friends the man saidagain as his head reached below thelevel of the floor Dim though the lightwas upon the stairs I recognized himi ramediaf el y and with a loud callsprang toward himMr Perry Oh thank God youhave come I stepped unthinkinglyon the plank at the bottom and hecame down to me and grasped my handDont mind that It cannot hurtyou I remarked as the warning voiceagain sounded out just as though itsservices were longer neededI know it cannot Mr Perry remarked with a smile Here Sonntagand another man brushed by us andwent to Jacksons prostrate bodyWill you look here sir Sonntagcalled motioning for Mr Perry to approachMy God It is Jackson How terrible Is he dead Who did it askedMr Perry glancing up at me Wereyou compelled to shoot him NelsonNo I am thankful that no mansblood is on my hands Although Icame very near shooting himThen I explained how Jackson hadbeen killed I told nothing about MrMorleys connection with the affairThey listened intently and then Sonntag carrying a jimmy went to the doorWill you two stand to one sideSonntag called out That shooting apparatus might go off again in gettingthe door openThe bundle of papers which hadfallen from the dead mans grasp waspicked up by Sonntags companion andhanded by him to Mr Perry Then theman turned to me and bestowing asmile upon me at the astonishment heevidently saw depicted on mj face Aventto Sonntags assistanceNo wonder I was amazed For theman was he who had played such atreacherous game upon Florence hadtried to shoot me and had escaped mywrath a few minutes before Skinnerthe station agent at SidingtonAh here is some of it Nelson someof the stolen bonds Mr Perrj exclaimed in excitement Perhaps wemay recover all of them 1 dont suppose there is any hope of getting backthe money he continued with a sighOh well the bonds stolen amounted to500000 If we get them back it willbe somethingThen he hurriedly stepped oyer nearT f w -the door to watch Sonntag and Skinner leaving me to my thoughtsPoor Florence My heart was rentwhen I pictured her grief And mypromise to Mr Morley that she shouldnever hear anything against her father to cause a diminution of her loveand respect how was I to keep thatpromise when the father lay there inyonder room shot to death by his partner his tool his pupil in crimeHere another pistol report soundedfollowed by an exclamation of satisfaction from Sonntag for immediately thedoor swung openNow then Mr Conway you caninvestigate this mystery he said coming toward meWhile Mr Perry and Skinner were engaged in searching for the cause of thevoice and the pistol shots Sonntagspoke in low earnest tonesWhere is the man who came downafter you he askedI pointed toward the inner apartmentWhat did Jackson lock him upthere How did he succeed Then hepaused and holding the lantern highergazed thoughtfully in my face Deadtoo You dont mean to tell meI nodded my headLord Almighty Sonntag exclaimed and then turned slowly fromme and joined the two at the doorMr Conway come here Mr Perrycalled to me See he said when Icame up here is the voiceOn one side of the door was a woodenI box in which was a phonographYou observe this wire began Skinner It is attached to the instrumentand runs down seemingly in theground Now Ill go and step on theplank and see if the wire is not movedand the phonograph set a going Hedid so and a olock work arrangementwas set in motion which communicatedwith the instrumentLet us see what pulls the wire saidMr PerryWe went over to the plank and sawthat Skinner had raised it so we couldlook underneath There was a steelspring under one end which was compressed when a weight was put uponthe plank The compression operated alever which pulled the wire attached toit The wire ran through an iron pipexmder the stones toward the phonograph the other end being fastened tothe clock apparatus as we had alreadyseenAn arrangement like that which operates the phonograph was also used for4iiilrJliyilllliUBftftft mL 1Sis eyes Etarin fixedly at methe revolver which was fixed above itthe muzzle pointing to the small holein the mortar between two

leaning the weight of my handagainst the door when I had stoopeddown to peer into the hole had operatedthe spring as had Jacksons body whenhe backed from meClever rascal that Jackson and apatient one remarked SonntagThen you know he robbed thebank I askedOh yes we knew it and have knownit for some time Sonntag said drylyThen why was he not arrested IcontinuedWell we wanted to recover the property also He had it hidden aroundhis hunting lodge somewhere we werequite sure but he was too cunning forus and Ave could not discover whereit was Then yesterday you told meof the walled up cellar and I knew Ihad himFrom what you tell me now andwhat I have heretofore thought of yourpeculiar ways I suppose I am right insurmising that you are a detective IsaidYes I am a detective he quietly respondedAnd your name is not SonntagNo Wilson is my name It wassimply a stroke of chance that mademe your lawyer and agent for a shorttime It was necessary to be presenthere and the death of your formeragent came most opportunelySo then Jackson never suspectedyouNo At least I believe notAnd how did you come to suspectJackson I asked curiouslyBy looking up his recordwas he a regular criminalNo Not until he robbed the bankHe used to be in the employ of a largesafe manufactory an an expert on locksWhen we found that out we were certain he was the man in the bank whocould open the lock when the timepiece was off without knowing thecombinationDid the detectives know of Mr Morleys connection with the affair Ifnot I could easily keep secret what IknewAnd you think Jackson was alonein the affair I asked with a view to- fpTsTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS EX TUESDAY APRIL 5 1898ascertaining how much Sonntag1 orWilson knewHe cast upon me one of his whimsicallooks and after a pause replied Atfirst it seemed quite certain there wassome one sonnected with Jackson in theaffair But now I find there was notHere Skinner who had been listeningto our conversation glanced quickly upat Wilson and I saw some signalflashed between the twoAnd what may your name be Areyou a detective too I asked of SkinnerYes he replied simply I am adetective and Skinner is my nameWhy did you try to shoot meI didnt 1 fired in the air StillI did want you to think I did It wasfor two purposes One to frighten youaway until this affair was settled another to make you really clown on meYou see Jackson at last seemed tosuspect me and I thought if I couldshow him you were terribly down onme it would put me all the closer inhis confidenceOh you succeeded in making himbelieve you were his friend I remarked Worked the pal racket onhim ehAs much as I couldThen you really were not treacherous to your contract with Miss MorleyGood God no Who could play falseto her Skinner exclaimed in suchconvincing tones that I was satisfiedHere Mr Perry broke in Yourname will come out resplendent Nelson when the whole truth is knownand we will take care that it be knownthat you allowed yourself to be madea martyr of by enduring the suspicionfor the sake of aiding the search forthe real robbers Now then come gentlemen Let us go into the other placeTO BE CONTJKUEDllAN ANECDOTE OF MEILHACiHott He Chose an Heir at a PartyGiven

observance of Easter dates backto about the year 68 at which timethere was much contention among theEastern and Western churches as towhat day the festival be observed Itwas finally ordained at the council ofNice in the year 325 that it must be observed throughout the Christian worldon the same day The decision settledthat Easter should be kept upon theSunday first after the fourteenth day ofthe first Jewish month but no generalconclusion was arrived at as to the cycleby which the first feativul was to be regulated and some churches adopted onerule and some another This diversityof usage was put an end to and theRoman rule making Easter the firstSunday after the fourteenth day of thecalendar moon was established in England in 669 After nine centuries a discrepancy in the keeping of Easter wascaused by the authorities of the EnglishChurch declining to adopt the reformation of the Gregorian Calendar in 1582The difference wa settled in 1752 by theadoption of the rule which makes Easterday

everywhereThe old home oer me rears Its mossygableA dusky shape against the starry skyIA gray grown dreamer wrapped in shadows sableAnd musing oer the happy days gone byThe firefly lamps among the

familiarlyacquainted with Bill Higgles to haveassociated with him any such an ethereal and effeminate folly as a romanceSuperlatively tall angular awkwardand diffident I have never known amore reticent man and except in onething a less emotional one Comelyenough after a rough fashion with honest deep set gray eyes firm but pleasant mouth and broad forehead withexaggerated mustache just a shade lessbrown than hip ruddy cheeks he wassimply a type of the commonplace cowpuncher remarkable in no one particuJar among his fellows Not exactlywhat one would call a ladies manand yet no woman

when they gotwell acquainted with him which generally took time as he was as slow informing friendships as he was in breaking them and their liking grew withthe yeaisThat Bill should have had a romancewas one of those inexplicable freaks offate that are always materializing forour mystification I have never ceasedwondering why fortune singled him outfor that high distinction or how the capricious dame could have dared experiment with such unpromising materialI say this in np derogation oi my oldcomrade He was unpromising only inthat he was a clear headed cooi sensible and emineutly practical man notgiven usually to any romantic hallucinations or other vacuous foolishness ofthat sort Of course he had the characteristic cowboy reverence for the sexand had exaggerated notions of thecourteous chivalry and deference dueall womankind but he was a fool onlyin regard to one womanFor that matter I guess that is acommon failing with us all Our affections center on one woman alone as arule and we generally are as foolish asthe law allows in that respect but hisfolly was purely of an hallucinatorykind and would have been laughable ifit had not been so sincere In shortBill was iu

his present job asforeman It was a real nice letter andcome as near to telling the truth aboutold Bill as a man could expectHe posted it himself at Maybell and Ilike to fell off my horse one day whenI rode up after the mail a month laterand found a letter there addressedWilliam Biggies Esq in a womanshand write and bearing the RichmondVa postmarkBill was all alone in the corral whenI rode up and put it in his hand withouta word He turned kind of pale aroundthe gills and let his rope fall and stoodthere looking at the letter like a man ina dream Then he braced up put it inthe inside pocket of his vest and pickedup his rope But he was plumb offand I soon saw that he couldnt catchnothing Why he was so rattled thathe couldnt hardly catch his breath letalone a wild bronco and I told him Idtend to the work for him But he hungaround and helped some and after supper he hauls the letter out and saysBead it formeIll own up to a surprise party rightthen and there She wasnt that kindof a girl at all and she really was a girlafter all The letter was a long oneand I cant remember the exact wordsand I havent got it to quote from Billsgot it in his bosom and hes but thatsgetting ahead of my storyThe substance of it was that she acknowledged the receipt of Bills letterwhich had been handed to her theoriginal of the picture we had inclosedby the factory superintendent Ourletter had been sealed and addressedTo the lady whose picture this is andinclosed in a letter to the cigarettemaker She thanked the gentlemanfor his very kind and flattering proposaland begged time to consider it Shestated frankly that she was only a factory hand a cigarette roller and hadposed for that picture only because shewas compelled to do so for businessreasonsshe had an invalid mother tosupport and work was hard to getHere I had to explain to Bill whoclutched his gun with a horrible imprecation against the factory ownerand said something about meetingthat skunk and squaring thingsShe was 23

flakes and wafth repeatedlyuntil it is no longer salt and then putit into a pan of cold wafer and let itcome gradually to the boiling pointIt must remain this way for at least20 minutes and it is important to remember that the water should notreally boilAn excellent sauce is made by measuring a pint of rich milk for sach pintof codfish and stirring it into a tablespoonful of flour which has previouslybeen melted in an equal measure ofbutter The sauce must simmer slowly the bubbles rising only at the sidesWhen the Avater on the dish is at lastallowed to boil turn it off and put thedrained

kinds as a dessert is a pernicious one In the first place it isan inducement to overeating since it isquite probable that enough has beeneaten before the dessert is served If thearticles offered are wliolesome theyshould be served and eaten with themeal as a part of it and not at itsclose in addition to the meal But itis generally the case that most of thearticles served at dessert are

effort to secure good roads for the stateand -with a fair prospect of successThey have placed themselves in comimmication -with the farmers and it isreported that there is an excellent understanding-between these two classeswhose interests are so closely alliedIt has required much demonstration toconvince the farmers that good roadsare a profitable investment The workof the agricultural experimental stations in this regardhas been invaluableICxperiments with broad and narrowtires conducted under the eyes of thefarmers have definitely shown the follyof maintaining the present system ofsmall tired wheels as long as the roadsare indifferent or positively bad inquality There are two points fromwhich to view the relationship beteweenthe tires and the quality of the roadThe experiments have shown first thatas long as the roads are in poor condition subject to much moisture andthereby liable to become heavy andmuddy at short notice the use of ther- ft Pin ft UmMWmROAD LEADING TO SLEEPYHOLLOWN Ynarrow tire is a positive hindrance Itrequires more power to haul a wagon soequipped for the tire sinks deep intothe material of the road and thus formsfor itself a constant obstruction thatmust be overcome But the broad tirehas a use other and indeed better thanthat of minimizing the labor and therefore the cost of hauling It cures thebad conditions that have been largelycaused by the narrow tire serving asa compressor and gradually compacting the material and greatly improving its condition Thus the broad tiremeans a double gain It saves the costof hauling Xyy permitting heavier loadsto be hauled by the sanfe agencies and3ii less time and it saves too in the costooad making and in repairing It isbelieved that if all road users could bepersuaded to change the tires of theirdraft vehicles especially in the districtswhere bad roads are the rule ratherthan the exception the ultimate cost ofbringing the country thorougnfares upto a modern standard would within avery shoit time be so low that the mostcomprehensive road improvement lawscould be passed without difficult Thepresent movement in Maryland is concentrated in an effort to secure the enactment by the legislature of certain2ending bills that aim at the construction of good roads by authorizingthe people to bond themselves for thipurpose In some states much has beendone by granting exemptions from roadtaxes to those road users who haveadopted the broad tires and likewise tothose who have adjusted their vehiclesho that the front and rear wheels willnot track thus minimizing thechances of wearing the surface of theroad It has been found that withbroad tires in use the amount of roadsurfacing material needed is comparatively small All these facts have beengi adually and persistently brought tothe attention of the agricultural classesso that now the plea of the wheelmenwho are growing to be a material powerii the land by reason of their mimbersis being heeded far more earnestlythan ever before Washington StarCARE OF UTENSILSXSairy Pans and Pails Should AlwaysBe Made of Tin and IveptSorupnlonsly CleanAll dairy utensils should be made oftin It is a

or less aggravated form Fewdiseases are more painful to the individualor more far reaching in their effects onhuman life and happiness What the dyspeptic needs is not local treatment notmere temporary stimulus The real needis the toning up of the entire system Fortify the system and it will do its own fighting and promptly eject any intrudingdisease The success of Dr Ayers Sarsaparilla in curing indigestion and dyspepsia is due to just this quality which itpossesses of renewing the vital forcesrepairing the waste and loss of the bodyThe ordinary treatment brings the fooddown to the level of the weak stomachDr Ayers Sarsaparilla puts strength intothe stomach and brings it up to the level ofthe strong food fit for men It does thisby strengthening the entire system Thestomach cannot stay weak when all theother organs are gaining strength WhatDr Ayers Sarsaparilla will do for dyspepsia is best illustrated in cases like that ofM S Shields Meridian Miss Mr Shieldshad got down to the last
