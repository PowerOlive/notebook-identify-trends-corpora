A white man, suspected of being implicated in the escape of themen, could not be located, and hisautomobile was missing.Rankin and Hanks had been lodged in the older part of the jail.There are now four steel cellswhich that night contained twoprisoners. Jailer Taylor stated thatlie was under the impression that aState law would have prohibitedhim from incarcerating the two colored men in the same portion of thejail which Js used for white prisoners.

However, the season has closed with the League playing out itsentire schedule of games.The first half of the season waswon by Maysville, with the Paristeam in second place. The secondhalf, judging from the papers of thevarious towns, seems to be somewhat in doubt. However, at 1heclose of the beason, the Paris teamhad won twenty-four game and hadlost eighteen games. The Cynthia naI team had also won twenty-fourgames and had lost eighteen games,thus leaving the Paris team and theCynthiana team tied for first place.The Mt. Sterling team,' under themanagement of Preacher Hill andHod Eller, an ex-snine ball artidt ofthe Cincinnati Reds, who was acting as manager for the Mt. Sterlingteam, claimed that they wQra wfnners of the peunant. Eller strivedto secure that position for his clubthrough techn;cahties and allegedirregularities of both the Paris andCynthiana tearr.b, out upon investigation the records showed that thoirregularities were not in the Cynthiana and Paris managmiu, but inthe management of the Mt. Sterlingteam, who had failed to iile contracts 'ipon any player until the 29day of Augast, of this year. AlsoPotts t;ie iirs laseman ,f the Mt.SterlUj team. w:ls by M;. r.irre'.l,declarpi an cv.:.w. and nil of tln-games won by J&t. Scrims, inwhich Potts nla-.ed, were tfcrewnout and not courted in the finalstanding of the clubs. This eliminated Mt. Sterling from any claimsshe had unon the nennanr ttTlpralso declared that Noble Ballou wasan outlaw and not eligible to playupon iiie Paris team. However,' Mr.Farrell, the Chairman and Secretaryof the National Board of Arbitration, disagreed with Eller, and saidthat the standing of Noble Ballouwas O. K., and that Pari- was entitled to the games in which he participated, thus leaving Cyathianaand Paris tied for first place.Then in order to settle the matteras to who was the winner of thesecond, half of the series, Jesse Morton, the manager and owntr of theLexington club, volunteered the information that he had .defeatedCynthiana one game in which heused a pitcher without sisrninfr thPpitcher to a contract. This beingcontrary to the rules of organizedbaseball, this game was taken fromCynthiana's losing column, leavingCynthiana as winning twenty-fojrgames and losing seventeen, therebyfinishing the season one-half a -gameahead of Paris. Mr. Morton, themanager and owner of the Lexington team, voluteered this information, and for which confessed irregularity he is liable to a severe fine.In addition to the fine. ManaserMorton failed to complete the seasonwith his club and forfeited severalgames to Winchester and Mt. Sterling. It, is reported on reliable authority that his failure to completethe season and also his confessedirregularities in running his teamwill be the cause of Mr. Morton losing the franchise of the Lexingtonclub. No action has been takenupon this matter at the present, butthe Directors of the Blue GrassLeague expect to act upon the sameat some future, date.At the final winding up of theseason, Cynthiana was declared thewinner of the second half by onetialf a game over the Paris club, andis now playing off a series withMaysville.TAXPAYERS NOTICETO AVOID ERRORS ANDUNDERSTANDINGS WEMIS-WILLNOT PAY TAXES POR OUR CUSTOMERS UNLESS SPECIALLY INSTRUCTED TO DO SO.FIRST NATIONAL BANK,FARMERS & TRADERS BANK.PEOPLES - DEPOSIT BANK ANDTRUST CO.,BOURBON -AGRICULTURAL BANK& TRUST CO.oct 6-to dec 1)BIRTHSMr. and Mrs. Dan Isgrigg arereceiving congratulations upon theadvent of a ten-pound son at theirhome in East Paris.

Sterling teamcame from behind in the ninth inning and defeated the Mammoths bya score 13 to 12. Paris entered aprotest at the beginning of thegame on account of Deveraux, formerly of the Winchester team, playing with Mt. Sterling. It was stated that Deveraux's contract withthe Winchester club did not expireuntil next Thursday, October 12.As the score indicated the contestwas a free-for-all in the hittins- order, Paris using four pitchers dur-ing the nine 'innings. Nippert, Ci-cona, Winger. Eller and Rittpr figured in the hit column, Cicona getting two three-base hits. Ciconawas slightly injured in slidingheadlong into home plate.The batteries were: For ParisWills, Cotter, Mueller, Woods andMacke; for Mt. Sterling Ferrell.Harrison and Lackev. TTmniroaBroekman and KlnnnAccording to published schedulethe Louisville Colonels will playthe Paris Mammoths at League Parknext Saturday, October 14. TheColonels had, to travel ten inningsto defeat the Winchester team ofthe Bluegrass League at Winchester,Sunday. Hod, Eller,' former worldseries star and present manager forthe. Mt. Sterling team, pitched forWinchester, and was in splendidform. The final score was 5 to 4.Tincup 'started pitching for Louisville, but was relieved in the fifthby Deberry, who was touched upfor ten hits, and four runs. Winchester tied the score in the ninth,Louisville putting over the winningrun in the tenth.I The agony is at last over, and theofficial seal has been placed on Cynthiana as winner of the second series of the Blue Grass League race.Paris fondly hoped to be the abidingplace of the pennant, and for awhile even the proverbial Philadelphia lawyer would have been puzzled to ascertain which team was tobe dubbed the champions. Mt. Sterling claimed it. Cynthiana was sureit belonged there, and Paris thoughtIt was cinch, while Winchester andLexington were officially out of therunning. We are all gladAt is over,but sorry Paris was euchered outof the honor, which few of us doubtbelonged here the championship ofthe Blue Grass League.A proposal has been made atLwrencebur to' start a baseballleague next year with Lawrenceburg, Frankfort, Shelbyville, Harrodsburg, Bloomfield and Bardstownas members. And already there istalk here of organizing a base ballleague in Bourbon county, composed Ior iNorin lviiaaietown, jacKsonvme,Millersburg, Austerlitz, Escondida,Hutchison, Ruddles Mills', SpearsMill and Paris. Some league, that!The first game of the Elue GrassLeague championship series betweenthe Maysville and Cynthiana teamswas staged on the Cynthianagrounds Sunday afternoon, resultingafter an uphill fight in the score being tied in the eighth inning, andthe game called on account of darkness. The score then stood 6 to 6,and no prospects of either team being able to pull another run acrossthe plate before darkness settleddown over the conflict. Boskinpitched a good game for Maysvilleuntil the eighth inning when heweakened, and this, coupled witherrors, netted the Cynthiana teamfour runs. Monhollen, on the pitching mound for Cynthiana strengthened as the game progressed. Cynthiana's first run came in the fourthinning, when Barker after hittingfor two bases, scored on a deep- single by Farley, The batteries were:For Cynthiana, Monhollan and Barker; for Maysville, Boskin and Con-'nolly. The third and fourth gamesin the series will be played at Mays- tville on next Thursday and Friday, 'the fifth at Cynthiana Saturday, andthe sixth contest at Maysville Sunday.

Now the moral is: Don'tbelieve everything your wife tells.you."A little learning is a dangerous-thing."-As proof, pray take the caseOf, some sweet maid"When first she learns'To decorate her face."What persons regulate to theirspeechDepends on what they would reach;""The man who asks you for a loan-Xiikely talks in softest tone.A Paris father chided his son because his school books were so cleanas to suggest infrequent use."Well," said the kid, "my geographyain't no cleaner than your Bible.""What has become of the old-fash-ionedParis wife who thought her'husband was so humane because heiwent down town every night to,feed the kitty?"'When you size up the fellow whocomplains he has been "the victim ofcircumstances, you generally conclude that circumstances .didn'thave a very hard tussle in downingJiim.We are accustomed to thinking ofTPhiladelphia as slow. Yet the dis' 'Covery has just been made that a.ign on one of, the principal buildings in Louisville has been wrong"'.for more than, twenty-five years.I heard of a man sying of hisdead friend: "He didn't have a dollar, but he was one of the best-lovedmen in town." Was not that asperfect an epitaph as the humantongue could devise or human beiing wish for?Thursday will be the annual recurrence of Columbus Day, which-will be appropriately celebrated all-over America. But we are willingto bet that when Columbus discovered America he couldn't have hadthe thrill that a fellow gets when hefinds a five-dollar bill in the pocket-of an old pair of pants.The man whose thirst impels him"to purchase liquor from a bootleggercan judge by a simple test whetherr not it is safe to dring the stuff.Just pour the entire contents ofeach container into an open sewer.lit the liquor crawls out of the pipeand back into the bottle, it is impure; if it goes through it's safe.tSee?There is nothing sadder in thisworld .than the spectacle of a littleParis boy complaining as he goes tofoed, that the day has been so short."he only had time to break four-wimdows, rip his trousers three.timwHirive a nail through the-family alhum xad put three snakesPAGE TWOin theteacher,s"desk. We know it,for we have been along that line,nd have done those very thingsand caught what was coming to usafter, too.Thomas A. Edison will be handeddown in world history as a great inventor because he is believed tonave invented tnat yarn aDoutbeing possible to work twenty hours Ja. day, and sleep during that part ofthe remaining four hours that is notdevoted to eating or recreation. ,One reason for frequent divorcesin America is the popularity, of theideal expressed in the term "lovenest," and the unpopularity of theold-fashioned conception of household equipment which included atin wash basin on the back porchfor some of the boys to use while therest of the children washed theirfaces and hands in the house.Of course we're an old grouch, anddon't know nothing about it anyhownoways, either, but, if our opinionwere asked, we would say that muchof this enthusiasm about the worldseries, strikes us as being made toorder. If you've got the money, andare willing to spend it, you canhave a winning team; that seemsto be the way out of it, and onessporting blood is just as little stirred over , such a contest as when awealthy stock broker gives, an orderto buy a likely Derby winner andluck stays with him long enough fora blue ribbon.October is rich in notable birthday anniversaries.

Theabove illustration is an example. We are often carried away bythe foolish idea that out of townstores can give us better prices, disregarding the fact thatour homemerchants have a fixed policy to askonly that just percentage of profitthat permits 'the doing of businesson a modern scale. 'MORAL Reward is sweet whenyou know you have done the rightthing.SNIPE EXTINCT ANIMALWhat was once a popular diversion -in the rural districts has almost become decadent. This was the"snipe hunt" arranged for the unsophisticated visitor from the citywho nearly always fell for the jokeput up by his country cousin.These1 "snipe hunts" always werearranged with great detail and thevictim from the city stationed atsome lonely spot to hold the bag forthe collection of the snipe after thedrive. After holding out for severalhours and hearing all sorts ofstrange noises the terrorized bagholder ordinarily tumbled to thesell and sneaked back to his quarters to undergo the jibes and tauntsof the perpetrators of the trick.The expression, "holding the bag,"owes its origin to the old-fashioned"snipe .hunt" in which the countryfolks .turned the tables on, smartcity chap.

It had been announced thatthe State Committee would makeendeavors to relieve the families ofthe men connected with the Clayhole election case.During the meeting, which hadformed itself into a mass assembly,a resolution was offered by JosephRobinson, of Lancaster, asking thatevery Kentucky Democrat make extraordinary efforts to elect the congressional candidates and JudgeDavid A.

It saidthat practically every member ofthe State and National organizationhad violated promises made to secure their election."NOW. IF I WAS RUNNING THISTOWN""Alomst every day of the week wehear some one say, 'Believe me. if Iwas running this town I'd do so andso.' Probably at least half of thesuggestions might prove valuableand the people who are running thetown would be glad to get them."The plain truth of the matter isthat every citizen of the town has orshould have a hand in the way atown is operated. Far too many ofthem feel that when they have elected a mayor or city council they havedispensed with their full duty.Those people are elected simply inorder that the will of the peoplemay be carried out not in orderthat the town may be run as a merehandful of men dictate."These men you have elected donot claim to be all-wise in the bestmethods of governing a town. Theyare there to carry out the wisest ofthe suggestions they receive. Naturally when they do not receive anyhave to fall back on their own ideas.But they would be only too glad toget ideas from every citizen', sohereafter, instead of saying, 'Believeme, if I was running this town'just realize that it is part of yourjob to have a hand in the runningand tell the right person what youwould do."PRIZE FOR HIGHEST SCHOOLGRADEThe announcement that JonasWeil, a prominent Fayette countylivestock dealer and farmer, willgive $100 yearly for a prize to theagricultural student making thehighest grades during his- freshmanand sophomore years at the collegeof agriculture of Kentucky University, shows his close feeling for thecollege.

History is full of examples, and peaceas well as war shows many heroes.Sometimes the hero is not even a.man, or a human being, but ahumble animal; a god, perhaps,whose love of his master is greater, than his love of life.A dog, so say the scientists, hasonly instinct. A dog, say the wisemen, does not think or reason; heloes but react to his environment.Doubtless they know, but if a dogdoes not think or reason, what holdsa dog; to his master's side in theface of certain and painful death?Trapped in the plant of the LongIsland Waste Company, John Bracken, watchman, died from fire andsmoke. By his .side died his bulpup. When they were found, afterthe smoke and flame had stilled thedog's barks for help, he was not atthe barred door, or at the blocked-window; he was found with hishead upon his dead master. To makethis true story the better one, let ithe chronicled that John Derrick,friend, was so severely burned in afutile effort to rescue man and dogthat he, too, may die.Probably dogs do not reason orthink; the scientists are usuallyright. Probably John Derrick didn'tthink of anything but his love forhis -friends when he fought fire fortheir lives. Would that more of uscould learn the lesson of brotherhood as these have learned it, manand dog. Perhaps the little heropup did not die in vain, if his selfless heroism brings home to us whoread, the lesson which John read tous so many years ago.CORNSfLift,Off with Fingers.ra J1 VXTm 11Doesn't murt a bit!

(adv-T)OIL DEVELOPING STEADILYKentucky is forging to the frontas t a great oil producing State.Some idea of the extent and development of the industry may be gained from official figures of the outputwhich showed that during June 1,700,000 barrels were produced inKentucky wells.Practically in its infancy, oil production is steadily being developedin nearly every section of "the State.The oil fields now producing in paying quantities are not confined toany one section, but extend fromthe Pennyrile to the Big SandyThis would seem to warrant the belief held by many that the wholeState is a potential oil field.Unlike coal, which pays no producing tax, oil pays a onQ-cent impost on the barrel to the State taxfund and a half-cent on the barrelto the county in which it is produced. This has served to augment thecounty revenues, and has raisedsome of them from the so-called"pauper" class, a term commonlyapplied to a counfy whose proportion of State taxes does not equalthe, amount received from the Statefor court costs and other items.Many fortunes have been made inoil development in Kentucky duringthe past decade, and persons in ordinary circumstances have becomerich over night.The oil boom, on the other land,caused a feverish speculation in oilstocks. Many of the wells existedonly on paper, with the result thatmany "suckers" were fleeced duringthe eras of "wildcatting."Oil production steadily is increasing, however, and daily adding to the wealth and commercialimportance of Kentucky.What has become of the, old-fashionedman who used to use thatcurly eatin' tobacco?KING LOPS OFFii.-i Ta$50,000 A YEARGeorge of Great Britain Forcedto Effect Economies in Expense of Household.GUTS DOWN HIS RACING STUDIn Spite of Rise in Cost of Living, theKing Has Resolutely Declined toAsk Nation for Any Increase in GrantLondon. King George has set yetanother example which may advantageously be followed by thousands ofhis subjects. As a result of recenteconomies in the king's household, anannual saving of something like $50,000 is being made. This is the result of the special Investigation theking ordered some months ago, when,in order to achieve economies in accordance with the spirit of the time,he directed that the whole organization of the royal household 'Should beoverhauled. The work of reorganization at Buckingham palace, Windsorcastle and other royal residences hasbeen in progress ever since. Its completion, with the saving mentioned, isnaturally a matter of satisfaction tothe king, whose financial resources areprobably much overestimated In thepublic mind. Moreover, the. economyhas been secured without the efficientand effective administration of theroyal household being impaired in theslightest. It has to be borne in mindthat the amount of money granted bythe house of commons annually for themaintenance of the crown and theroyal household remains at the samefigure as in' 1914.Refuses to Ask Increase.In spite of the general rise in thecost of living and of all commodities, the king has resolutely declinedto apply to the nation for any increase. This has meant, inevitably,that he has had to draw heavily uponhis private resources during the pasteight years to an extent that wouldcause considerable surprise could thefigures be published. In his task ofreducing expenses the king has beenfortunate in having the assistance ofso experienced. and astute a financieras the veteran Viscount Farquhar, lordsteward of the household. This isnot the first instance in which LordFarquhar has been called upon toact in this capacity. He served KingEdward in similar fashion after hecame to the throne, when it was foundthat the entire royal household required to be remodeled, and the manysinecures that had grown up duringthe later years of the reign of QueenVictoria rigorously abolished.Early in the present year Lord Farquhar was able to submit a balancesheet showing how the money wasbeing expended In the royal household and where reductions mightprofitably be made without any lossof efficiency. This the king considered for some days with very particular care, and in the end gave it hishearty approval, and this work of reorganization at his various residenceswent forward. In the meantime hismajesty decided It was necessary forhim to retrench his personal expensesin every manner possible. Thereforehe gave directions that his racing studbe cut down to a minimum and thatno unnecessary expense was to be Incurred In connection with his stables.He decided, as a farther economy,that his famous old racing cutter Britannia should not be put into commission this year. This, however, had aneffect upon which the king had not calculated. Britannia to Race Again.The withdrawal of the yacht fromthe races In which it was customaryfor it to take part in the past led "toother owners of big yachts decidingto lay their boats up. An unfortunateblow was thus hit at the sport, andnot a little unemployment was causedamong those who had been accustomed to man these large racingcraft." This aspect of the matter wasbrought to the notice of the kingwhen he was staying at Cowes recently. Any development causing unemployment at once receives the sympathetic attention of the king, who deelded to inspect the Britannia, nowlaid up in the Medina river in the Isleof Wight, in order to see what repairs and renovations wouid be required to render it seaworthy for theopening of the yachting season nextyear. As a result the Britannia willhoist her pennant again next year.This is a fact which will cause thegreatest satisfaction in yachting circles throughout the kingdom. It isalso now probable that when the autumn sales of bloodstock open at Doncaster, Newmarket and elsewhere, theking will order new horses to be obtained with a view to bringing hisracing stud into line with what it usedto be in the days of King Edward..

With Its thousand pagodas, its deserted palaces andIts picturesque ruins, the city ofMandalay continues to be a place ofchief attraction for the European orAmerican visitor to Burma.The palace grounds, surrounded bya wall and moat, are about a mileand a half square. The buildings havea cheap gaudiness about them whichcompares in many ways to that of anAmerican street carnival. Still preserved are the throne rooms and theapartments of the king, the seniorqueens. MIndon MIn, the next to thelast king of Burma, married 57 wivesseeking, evidently, to discover whatthe "57 varieties" are like.From the palace grounds an American taxi takes the visitor to the footof Mandalay hill, one of the holyplaces of Burma Buddhism. Herethose who are adherents of the 3uddhlst religion and are willing to remove their footwear may obtain greatmerit by climbing the nearly 400 stepswhich lead to the summit.Many Americans have been confused as to the exact location of Mandalay by a couple of geographical errors which occur in Kipling's wellknown poem. It could hardly be"where theflylng fishes play," whenthe sea is over a hundred miles distant. And China isn't "just across thebay," but is just across the mountains Instead.
