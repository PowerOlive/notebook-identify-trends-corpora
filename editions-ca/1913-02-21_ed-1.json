"Pm sick and tirerrof working."
"What's the matter?"
"Oh, it's clean, clean, clean, and as fast as
you clean the house is sooty again."
"It's not so bad at our place. Electric
light doesn't make any soot, you know, and
since I got the electric flat iron to use, there's
no need of a kitchen fire to soil up the place
no ironing day."
"I wish to goodness we had electric light."
"Why don't you write, 'phone or see the
PARIS GAS & ELECTRIC CO., Inc., they will
wire the house at cost. Better do this right

False Confession, Declares
Deaton.
D. F. Deaton, who was implicated
as the arch conspirator in the murder
of Ed Callahan," former sheriff of
Beathitt, and who is incarcerated in the
Winchester jail, in a statement given
out as a confession by Dock, Lish and
Govan Smith a few days ago, denoun
ces the whole proceeding. Deaton
says that when the trials are resumed
evidence will be produced to break
down the alleged confession.
Deaton says that John Clair, whom
he bel'eved to be as innocent as him
self, was drawn into the "frame-up"
for the simple reason that he was un
der indictment for killing "Bummer"
Spicer, a relative of the Callahans.
He says a nrson interested in the
prosecution had stated that he could
never be convicted, but they "would
never stoD until thev broke him ud.",-
D. F. Deaton spoke for himself and
his son, Jim Deaton, the latter being
one of the men, according to the con
fession, who were on the hillside and
firing at Ed Calliahan through the
window.

The Cincinnati Automobile Show
There be exceeding pleasure in re
cording the untiring brilliant activities
of the directing committees of the
Cincinnati Automobile Dealers Associ
ation in behalf of its annual motor car
show, which opens in North wing of
Music Hall February 24.
Months back a comprehensive, elab
orate plan was initiated, aiminz at an
exhibit that leaves nothing to chance
and presents the very best that can
be offered in the way of variety and
high excellence.
Managing head has been and is Har
ry S. Leyman, President of the Asso
ciation, he being ably and aggressive
ly assisted by Committeemen Frank
H. Miller, ot the George C. Miller
Sons Company, H. O. Brunton, of 'the
Cincinnati Automobile Company, Jack
TarbiiJ, of the Citizens Motor Car
Company, William G. Welbon, of the
WelbongMotor Car Company, and Rob
ert C. CiouiheiF, of the Kentucky
Motor Car Company.
First attention wes bestowed to the
matter of suitable decorations, a con
tract being entered into with the
William Beck SonsCompany, and one
calling forlarcejexpenditure of money,
together with plans tmost pleasing in
detail and ensemble
Entertainment has been urovided
throuch presence of Cincinnati's
"pride" band, that conducted bv John
LC. Webber, master of programs that
make appeal to the widesu range of
listeners.
The very latest and most advanced
models of motor car construction Lhave
been'obtoined, not only such a are
daily seen in Cincinnati, but notably
those special. ones that have formed
distinctive features at the great Na
tional Shows in New York, Chicago
and elsewhere on the ten city circuit
established by the Association of Au
tomobile Manufacturers.
From everv standpoint this exposi
tion wi'l be deserving of generous pa
tronage on part of the local community
and outlying cities.
STOCK, CROP AND FARM NOTES
At Mt. Sterling Court Monday C.
M. Clay, of Bourbon, sold three pair
of heavy mules to L. C. A gee, of Lex
ington, at an average of $412.50 a pair.
A fine jack belonging to W. R.
Gabhait, of near Danville, while reach
ing up into a loft for hay hung its head
between two planks ana was choked to
death. t
The Cynthiana Democrat says :
"Friday night Pennsylvania buyers
shipped live cars of horses from Cyn-
thiana. Buyers offer such high prices
1 that Kentuckians can no longer afford
to own good horses, and the country is
constantly stripped."
Larue Hockinsmith, of Lexington,
sold to George L. Evitt, of Boston, the
five year old chestnut mare, Anna B.
H., by Cocnrato, dam Bethe B. .H, by
King Laurt, and dam of George Todd.

showed fast in her work it was up in

Rankin Clemmons. of Fayette
county, has purchased of F. P. Leon
ard his fine Salt river farm of several
hundred acres, which adjoins two other
farms of his in Mercer county, at a fan
cv price. Mr. Leonard then bought ot
James Forsythe his splendid blue grass
farm of 280 seres at $135 an acre,
which was a record price for land in
that county.
Can Not Be Indicted For Felony.
Corporations cannot be indicted for
ordinary crime and misdemeanors that
involve criminal or immoral intent
such as are crouped in the books of
the common law under the threefold
designation uf treason, felony and
breach of the peace. This decision
was rendered by the Appellate Court
in the case of the Commonwealth
acainst the Illinois Central Railroa
Company' whichfhad been indicted fo
involuntary manslaughter. John Ben
nett, an epmloye of the railroad comf-
pany, was killed in Hickman countjl,
and the railroad company, as a corp
ration, was indicted for theJJoffense.
The court says that a railroad com
pany may be indicted for misfeasance
and nonfeasance nf duties to the pub
lic and that a corporation may be pun
ished by a nne, hut if the statute pro
vides both a fine and imprisonment as
a penalty, then the statute is inop
erative, as it cannot be enforced.

Tonight at School Auditorium.
Mr. Frederick W. Truman, the cele
brated impersonator, will appear at
the Paris Public School Auditorium in
Dickens' "The Cricket on the Hearth"
to-nighr, at eight o'clock.
Mr. Truman's unique representation
of the charming story "The Cricket on
the Hearth" has proved him to be the
possessor of a gift of high degree.
Every character is so faithfully por
trayed as to bring the speaker visibly
before the minds of his hearers, so
completely is he the master of his art.
The following letter was received by
Mr. Truman from Mr. Edward L. Til
ton, Architect to Andrew Carnegie:
"I wiih to send you an expression
on the ple'asure it gave me to listen to
your lecital I was much impressed
by your dramatic ability to make th6
various invisible characters appear
actually present, so that at time I felt
the platform would be insufficient to
hold the number of persons that were
called up simultaneously by your wiz
ardlike powers. It was a rich harvest
of enjoyment."
Tickets for this dehehtful enter
tainment are now on sale at the drug
stores of Clarke & Co., and Oberdor
fer's at 25 cents each.
Francisco Madero's Brother Ex
ecuted.
The execution of Gustavo Madero,

ment has not relaxed in carrying out
mobilization orders.
