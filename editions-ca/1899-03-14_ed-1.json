THE BOURBON NEWS AARIS KY TUESDAY MARCH 14 1898
From Millersbarg Gazette
Oue Of The Great Problems
Confronting The American
People
The Acquisition Of The Great
Archipelago One Of The
lu foreseen Events Of
The War
American Destiny Viewed From
a Democratic Standpoint
Destiny has forced expansion upon
us and the whole face of the world has
Deen cnangea we nave come to a
consciousness of our greatness as we
never before understood it We are
now entering the great struggle for
commercial and financial supremacy of
the world the great trade of the Orient
Every foot of territory that has ever
been added to the American Uuion ex
cept Alaska has been under democratic
auspices
It now looks like President McKin
ley and his party are adopting Demo
cratic principles and platforms and are
trying to became the political heirs of
Jefferson Jackson and Polk
Was Thomas Jefferson a Democrat
He annexed terrtories by the side of
which the Phillippine are a mere po
tato patch and without the least re
gard for congress and he arranged to
do so and to govern them without so
much as a passing thought of the con
sent of the governed Was Calhoun a
Democrat Remember the Mexican
war and the seizure of the empire ir
the Southwest Such has been the
policy of the democracy and all of its
great leaders Cass Buchanan Morcy
etc from the foundation of the gov
ernment All this talk about imper
ialism is mere I osh nonsense
humbugery
The permanent occupancy of the
Phillippines by this government will
meet with the approving consciences
of all civilization and the sober judg
ment of nine tenths of the people
The culmination of the late war will
allow that oppressed and stricken peo
ple freedom freedom to acquire wealth
and to breathe in Gods sunlight
Jefferson paid 15000000 for Louisi
ana and that vast territory which in
cludes St Louis and it is now worth
five times fifteen billions of dollars
Talk about the consent of the geverned
what do they know about government
of any kind After they have re
ceived the blessings of this govern
ment for an hundred years then we
can talk about the consent of the gov
erned
Fighting for their liberties against
foreign invaders most of them fighting
with bows and arrows and destitute of
any clothing what nonserse this takl
aooutnhe consent of the governed
Our Government is acting wisely to
put down the insnrrection and to main
tain order and cizilization otherwise
all would be choas misery and bar
barism
We should hold on to the Phillip
pines forever hold them as we hold
Alaska New Mexico and Arazona
Why New Mexi o has 200000 popula
tion more than 1000 miles of railroad
and great and flourishing cities yet it
remains a territory
We are under no obligation to make
States of the newly acquired territor
ies
It is all bugbear that anybody living
on territory or other property of the
United States is a citizen We can
make laws and keep them just where
they are just as we exclude the
Chinese from this grand Continpnt of
ours
We must stand firm for the present
American Union of Sister States undi
vided by anybodys archipellegoes
We dont propose to divide this great
Republic the heritage of our fathers
among them
This mighty Republic now commands
one side of the Pacific California
alone has more than a thousand miles
front upon the greatest of oceans then
Oregon Washington Alaska and then
Aleutian islands that reach to Asia
We can easly dominate the other side
and then we have midway stations in
the Sandwich and other islands so
that practically this greatest of Oceans
is in the hands of our people who will
convert it into a great American
Lake
China and the far east facing as they
do the Pacific coast lie practically at
the back door of the United States
And the events of the hour are carry
ing our great Country forward with
almost bewildering rapidity
We must hold on to the islands and
thus render the United States indepen
dent of all other countries in the pro
duction of tropical products It costs
now 3000001 00 to secure these pro
ducts which is a source of great expense
Then how else can we receive any in
I demnitv for the expenses of the war
Spain being a bankrupt nation
But few of the American people real
ize the unsurpassed resources of the
Phillipines and do not realize how
large the Philippine archipelago is
Luzon itself on which is located Man
ila the capital of the islands is in area
as large as Illinois Mindinao is nearly
as large as Kentucky There are f ulb
2000 islands ranging in size from a
half acre to the size of Luzon
This tropical archipelago reaches
within four degrees of the equator on j
the south and is in the same latitude
as Venzuela and Central America Sev
eral hundred of the islands varying in
areafrom fifty to 600 square miles have
never been explored and are said to
contain a population as fierce and sav
age as our Apaches or Sioux and are as
wild as Hottentots It is indeed al
most an unknown land It was dis
covered by Magellen in 1521 and they
stretch no- th and south for more than
a thousand miles and lie about 600
miles from the southeastern coast of
China while the island of Borneo is
much nearer on the southwest Their
total areais about 160000 square mile9
and named after King Phillip II the
husband of Queen Mary of England
The climate is thoroughly tropical
the thermometer ranging from a mean
temperature of 72 during the cold sea
son to an average of 87 during the hot
season
The races are mixed up being a
combination of some dozen different
rrpa Tt is ft common saving in Man
ila ucky is he that knows his own
father
The imagination kindles as it recog
nizes what these islands in the East
may yet become
The advancing progress of mankind
has changed national boundaries and
they will become the gems and glories
of those tropical seas With their lux
urant productiveness they are capa
ble of supplying the food of the world
We can hardly estimate the variety
and opulence of their great ealth
They have forests of fine woods that
are inexhaustible and of incalculable
Value which will become an industry
of the first Importance They have
mines of ere of every sort
The great staple product which
and I makes the islands of so much import
ance to the world is Manila hemp
Some of the finer grades of this hemp
and woven into fabrics of wearing ap
nral liumv articles of which are
said to be very beautiful and expen
sive They produce the hemp thar
binds the cereal crops of the American
continent Under our control million
aire fortunes will be made in this arti
cle alone
There are immense possibilities in
the culture of hemp tobacco sugar
indigo rice coffee fruits etc Sugar
cane grows like magic and comes to
maturity from the seed in one y ar
and these plantations hold the worlds
record for high production of rich cane
to the acre Indigo grows in incredi
ble lux jriance throughout the islands
and many of the richest families live
in Madrid or Paris who have made
their wealth on that article alone
No where else does rice and the finer
qualities of tobacco grow so prolifically
and crops that require the niceet culti
vation in other parts of the world grow
wild and in great luxuriance over tht
islands Coffee grows in all the islands
and owing to the marvelous fertility ol
the soil is produced in great abundance
American trade and commerce during j
the approaching century will be simply
fabulous It will be a trade witn more
than a fourth of the population of the
world a trad between different zones
and with a people who will send ut
things that we want and cannot pro -duce
and take in return from us thing
that they want and cannot produce
Then we must have our Nicarauguu
canal completed at the earliest moment
possible Without this waterway the
great South is practically excluded from
the great market which her industries
are best fitted to supply Congress has
voted the money to cut through this
great barrier that nature has imposed
across the pathway ot American coin
m erce
It is a veritableland of flowers They
are in the greatest profusion everywhere
and without end Plants which are
highly prized and carefully cultivated
in this country grow as weeds in this
tropical country It is covered with
picturesque cocoanut trees waving
palm and banana trees The oleaader
is a giant tree over topping the honses
The begonia thrives m gre it clumps
with massive leaves of a beautiful irri
discence The night blooming cerus
the choicest flower in the c onservatory
in America abouuds throughout the is
lands and is a big roval plant The air
is perfumed with the scent of violets and
the breeze blow soft as a caress to ones
cheeks ana with all the pungency of
tropical verdure and the broken lazy
clouds as white as cottou float in a sea
of deep blue above the horizou
Under American rule Cuba the gem
the Queen of the Antilles and the
Phillippines the El Dorado of the
Orient will become the great centers
of the worlds wealth and the most ex
quisite and charming couutries on
this habitable globe Under our rule
will vn Hbertv and law and civilization
and all that is noblest in the history of
the hnmau race and they and their de
scendants will celebrate the landing of
American troops which brought them
freedom and America will receive the
benedictians the plaudits and the bless
ings of all future generations
