Mrs. O. M. Johnson were the enter
tainers in the room who ushered them
in turn into the marguerites and choc
olate room, which was presided over
by Mrs. R. M. Johnson, Mrs. J. T.
Jefferson, Mrs. M. C. Grimes, Mrs.J.
T. Prather, Mrs. W. D. Daniels, the
latter of Paris. From here they
passed into the dining room, where
a delightful lunch; consisting of old
ham, chicken--salad, beaten biscuit,
cheese sandwiches," pickle, . potato
chips, grape ice and mints was served
by Mrs. T. P. Wadell, Mrs, C. B.
Smith, and Mrs. E. T. Beeding, the
latter of Lexington, and Miss Eugenia
Wadell. The pleasure and mirth of
the entertainment was centered in the
bride's book, which was in the recep
tion hall, in charge of Mrs. W. A.
Butler. In this book every guest was
required to inscribe a -wish for the
bride. The wishes were interesting
to read. At the apponted time the
asembly parted and all were happy for
having been there.
One of the best drilled entertain
ments "ever put on at the M. F. C,
was "The Rivals," a five-act comedy
drama, by Miss Bascom's class in ex
pression, Saturday evening. All of
the voiwfe ladies had been thoroughly
trained and the parts were well taken.
I Of course the male characters were
-n W ' ,
spite this fact, they did their parts
well. Their dramatic action was
good and all of 'the spoken work was
perfectly natural. There was no
straining of voices and peculiar punc
tuations and emphasis that character
ized sonuch of the work of Miss
Walker while she was in the institu
tion. The piece was rather heavy,
it being one of the pieces in which Joe
Jefferson starred for more than fifty
years. We are sorry that space will
not permit us to make just comment
on each individual character. Miss
Mary Bell Rudd as "Mrs. Malprop,"
Miss Elizabeth Isham as "Sir Anthony
Miss Elizabeth Isham as "Sir Antnony
and Marfe gmith as
Absolute." Mfsses Mar
garet Peterson and Mattie , Burford
as "Lydia Languish" ana "Julia" an
deserve especial mention, wjnie
Miss Mary Bruce Redd, as fighting
! s? : ..jK
"Ftnh Acres." did her part m more
part that Mr. Jefferson used to play,
and could he have been present on
Saturday night, notwithstanding the
fact that a young ladi- was doing the
part we know he would have applaud
de and complimented Jier afterward.
The acts were interspersed with
lively music, which gave much vari
ety, and there were no miscellaneous
readings between acts, as has often
been the case at such entertainments.
The public go to see the play, and not
to listen to miscellaneous readings.
These we can get in the various re
citals. Miss Bascom needs to be con
gratulated upon the manner in which
she handled her class in this difficult
and classical piece, and we know that
she will have something good for us
at the close of school. She has been
the recipient of showers of compli
ments ever since the entertainment
and we trustthat she will be with us
again next year. All who have wit
nessed her work woud be delighted
to have her do something of the kind
with the young ladies and gentlemen
of the town. We know that she could
brine: forth good results that the piece

As an experiment, the supervisor of
the Beaverhead National forest is
stripping the bark from the base of a
number of lodgepole pine trees at va
rious periods before they are to be
cut for telephone poles. This gird
ling causes the trees to exude resin,
and it is desired to find what effect
this may have as a preservative treat
ment for the poles.
The State of New York has just
published a comprehensive report of
its wood-using industries.
Canada has a society qf forest en
gineers. Dr. B. E. Fernow, of Toronto
is President, and Mr. F. W. H. Ja
combe, of Ottawa, is Secretary.
Lodgepole pine seed sown broadcast
on the snow in Southern Idaho last
spring germinated when the snow
melted, and as many as 60 little
trees were counted to the square foot.
The summer was so dry, however,
that most of the plants died, except
where sheltered by brush or logs.

DEATHS
KENNEDY.
Mr. John Kennedy, aged 20 years,
died Friday morning at Corbin, while
en route from Middlesboro to his
home in Richmond, from an attack of
acute indigestion. Mr. Kennedy was
formerly employed as a clerk in the
freight department of the Louisville
& Nashville railroad in this city. He
left here about six months ago for
his home in Richmond and later ac
cepted a traveling position, which he
held at the time of bis death. He
was taken from a train at Corbin.
He was the son of Mr. Joseph Kenne
dy, a clerk in the Frankfort peniten
tiary. PATON.
Mr. H. T. Paton died at his home
in Lexington yesterday morning at 7
o'clock, following an illness of sever
al days. Mr. Paton was 84 years old,
and death was due to Bright's disease,
coupled with la gripne.
For several days before his death
he was unconscious and his passing
was no surprise to the members of
his family, who had been patiently
watching at his bedside.
Mr. Paton was a native of Bourbon
county, but moved to Lexington "about
twenty-five years ago, engaging in the
business of a cabinet workman.
He was a member of Bourbon
Lodge of Odd Fellows, in this city, for
many years, and was an industrious,
energetic, good-natured man, who was
esteemed by all who knew him for his
sterling qualities.
He is survived by four children:
Mr. Burr Paton, for the last twenty
years mailing clerk on the staff of
the Lexington Leader; Mr. Henry T.
Paton, Jr., formerly collector for B.
B. Smith & Co., both of Lexington;
Mr. James Paton, assistant cashier of
the First National Bank, of Temple,
Texas, and Miss Amanda Paton, of
Mineral Wells, Texas.
Mr. Paton's wife, Mrs. Ella Paton,
died about one year ago, and the
death of Mr. Paton comes as a double
bereavement to the sons and daugh
ter, who have the sympathy of many
friends in their irreparable loss.
Mr. Henry Tyler Paton was the son
of James and Catherine Trundle Pat
on, He was born in Paris, Septem
ber 22, 1830, and was the second son
of thirteen children, his father having
married twice. He with his father
was initiated into the Paris Lodge of
Odd Fellows January 26, 1852, conse
quently was one of its oldest mem
bers. Mr. Paton held the office of
Sheriff back in the sixties, and at the
expiration of his term of office con
cluded to embark in the furniture
business. He was a successful mer
chant for many years.
Mr. Paton was an uncle of County
Clerk Pearce Paton, of this city.
