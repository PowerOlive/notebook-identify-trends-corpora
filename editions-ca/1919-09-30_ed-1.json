IDEAL FALL WEATHER
This section of God's footstool has
been greatly blessed in the way of
fine weather in the past few days.
1 Ideal weather conditions for fall have
prevailed though the drouth has been
a serious matter for the farmers to
contend with. In the jmatter of
weather, though, everything has been
as near perfect as could be. Warm,
bright sunshine has contributed to
drive away all kinds of "blues," in
cluding the alcoholic, and pleasure
seekers have taken advantage of the
conditions to get better acquainted
with old Mother Nature. All in all,
it has been a fine beginning for fall,
with a prospect for "Indian Sum
mer" bringing up the rear with a
continuance of the same. For all of
which we are duly thankful.
