THE MIDDLE-AGED MAfJ.
The fallacy or the inefficiency of thy
middle-aged man is to be exposed if
possible by a committee of Chicago
capitalists who will make tests of men
"between, forty-five and sixty-five years
old in comparison with younger men.
Tliis is a very wisely undertaken
task, for it has long seemed strange
that in a country which is managed
in every important aspect by men of
jaiddle age and over, the same age in
subservant position should be under
estimated by reason of prjudice. For
it cannot be doubted that prejudice
more than reason has caused the de
gassing of older men as useful work
ers.
It is well enough known that the
mere physical endurance of a man of
forty to fifty is greater tiian that of a
man of twenty-one. Moreover, the old
cr man's judgment is mature, his ex
perience has ripened; frequently his
-failure to have advanced his own ma
terial interests is due solely to the
fait-Mulness with which he has served
his employer's interests. Younger men
aiay have more effervescence; they
may indulge in the display of more
T)ep" in their work; but these are
Tassing qualities, and as often as not
they represent lost motion. They seem
tx indicate that the youngster is really
accomplishing something, when as of
ten as not the quiet worker who docs
not attract much attention by his
"rush" is really achieving more stead
ily and substantially. It is on the cool
er side of the "pep" period that a man
reaches his greatest efficiency, and hie
-ralue as a servant in any line of en
. teavor ought to be at its height about
the age of fifry-five.
Tho young man lias his place in the
Tvork of the world, and the older man
ihas his place. Wise administration
will put age where it can best exercise
its power. It is just as impossible for
Tunger men to imake older ,men un
necessary in the daily work of shoul
dering the world along, as it is for
older men to dispense with younger
men. Age is an individual matter any
way, and not a matter -of years. The
oolor of the hair is not an infallible
indication, of the vigor of the mind
The Chicago committee, by pursuing
proper meaiods in its test, may do
"much to correct the current prejudicf.
about the onan who has grown old
onough to control his powers and woric
without fuss or noise.

MAN IS LEFT-HANDED
BOTH INSIDE AND OUT.
The body of William King, which
lias been preserved for twenty months
is described by anatomists as "left
handed, both inside and out," according
to a statement made public at the City
Hospital in SL Louis, Mo.
On May 8, 1915, King, who was 35
years old. applied at the hospital tor
treatment. He said he was a laborc.
and had lived most. of his life in Wis
consin. He was suffering from ty
phoid fever.
When asked who should be notified
in case of his death, King said: "Don't
worry about that. Just cut me up and
examine any body; there's some thing
wrong with me besides the fever." lio
died a few days later.
When surgeons made an axaminatioi:
of the body they found one of the ab
normal cases in the history of surgery.
The heart was on the right side; the
liver on the left; the appendix was on
the left side and the s'pleen on the
right. The stomach was turned around
completely. On the left lung was three
lobes; the right lung had but two.
The left kidney was larger and lower
than the right one.
j EXERCISE YOUR WILL.
J In the January Woman's Home
Companion a writer says:
"Let us keep it in mind each day
tiliat a weak will is the sign of inferi
ority; it means that we belong to the
lower classes, to the weaker and infer
ior; and then, remember that if we re
main weak and inferior, it is not be
cause we must, but entirely because
we prefer to; and rcfneimber that we
can become one -of the intelligent rul
ing class if we choose: Let us set our
selves certain tests of will, and remem
ber to let them be tests, not tasks. Let
us throw away if we can, all somber
ideas of duty and all ideas of our
weakness being sinful. Perhaps il
might be accounted so by those of a
strongly religious trend; but let us re
member that our task, our whole splen
did and joyous task in. this instance,
is to learn to exercise and use our owa
powers.
"It is Emerson who says, 'What you
are speaks so loudly, I cannot hear
what you say. "
,for ipassage next week and if they
again are rejected they will be rein
troduced in the torm of a separate
bill.
The postoffice bill, carrying appro
priations of $322,000,000, was complet
ed in contnitt.ee of the whole and
House leaders expect it to pass. Other
provisions stricken out included $100,
000 appropriation for an experimental
aeroplane service and a proposal for
a bonding guarantee system for postal
employes. Repeated efforts to put into
the bill a section authorizing govern
ment ownership of telegraph and tele
phone lines were blocked by points of
order.

WHY-TRAINS RUN,
LATE IN WINTER
Whenever severely cold weather ur
snowstorms of unusual extent trouble
the earth, freight and passenger
trains run late, anywhere from an
h'our to a day. The Cincinnati Post
has been looking into the matter, and
as a result publishes the following edi
torial, which will be interesting
to Paris and Bourbon county readers
of THE NEWS, who are not well vers
ed in the fickle ways of railroai
'trains 'missing their schedule:
"Every time we have a spell of cold
weather in this country railroad sys
tems seem to go to pieces.
"All travelers know the
fact, and
most of them speak vio ntly about it.
In any cold snap no train that runs
400 tmiles will arrive on time. When
teh mercury begins to drop the train:;
begin to run late. The lower it drops
the later they run.
"There seems to be some mathemat
ical rule about it. Every degree of
lower temperature takes off so 'much of.
train efficiency. A train that will be
an hour late on a temperature of 12
above will be two hours late on a tem
perature of 6, three hours late at zero
and a day late at 24 below.
"Railroad men say there are two
causes. In cold weather the locomo
tives will not make enough steam to
haul the trains and heat them, too.
And in cold weather switches at sta-
ti us s-nd ju ftion point? '"reezn up and
Inust be thawed out before a train can
go ahead.
"No doubt this explains why trains
are late. But it doesn't explain why
railroad management allows them to
be late. Other countries much colde'
than our do not have these troubles.
Norway, Switzerland, the South Island
of New Zeland operate railroads in
worse weather than we usually have,
and do it without our abominable nui
sance of late trains.
"It isn't necessary to have frozen
switches. It isn't necessary to have
such long trains that locomotives will
not pull them and heat them, too.
The Hungarian Government has es
tablished an experiment station for the
study of the culture of flax and hemp.
SOME CURIOUS FACTS.
If a tallow candle be placed in a
gun, and be shot at a door, it would
go through without sustaining any in
jury, and a musket ball fired into the
water will rebound and be flattened
as if fired against a hard substance.
A musket ball may be fired against
gone of glass, and, if the glass be sus
pended by a thread, it will not even
vibrate. Cork, if sunk twenty feet m
the ocean, will not rise again, on ac
! count, of the nressure of water. In
i till e Arctic regions, when the ther-noni-leter
is below zero, persons can C3ii
j verse more than a imile distant. Mr.

I MONEY IN THE SCRAP HEAP,
I The American people are coming to
realize that big "money lies hidden in.
the scrap heap, and they are profiting
by the lesson. The Sebree, (Ky.) Ban ,
ner, in a recent issue, has the follow
ing with reference to the "trash" of
the tobacco growers, which may even
tually prove of great interest and a
source of revenue to the tobacco grow
ers of this county, as well as those
of all the counties in tjhe State: j
i
t "There was a time when faunierjs
looked on a $2 price as the top for
trash, and it was a common saying
.that 'trash is trash. Those who were
present and watched the sales on the
loose floor (here Saturday were con
vinced that trash was more than trasn,
, when one one farmer received a higher
price for his trash than he received for
lugs off the same tobacco. Several
baskets of the commonest trash sold
for $8 and higher."
i
The rise in prices is another thrifty
lessen to the tobacco growers and will
I help greatly to stimulate the national
thrift campaign. It may be said that
'where there is no waste there is no
!want, and that it will be possible to
embark in the banking business at the
i sign of the scrap heap.
GIRLS HIT "HIGH COST;"
SHORT SKIRTS THE THING
Assemblyman Carl Pieper, of Mil
waukee, believes the eighth wonder of
the world is the American girl who
has tackled the high cost of living pro
positron and is making a good job of it
Because he regards the short skirt
as "real economy and retrenchment'
he has (prepared a joint resolution con
gratulating t4ie women of the State
for pointing out one avenue for the
smashing of high prices.
"What has bothered our best ex
perts," said he, "is accompanied by
the American girl with a grace ar.d
style that excites the admiration of
every human being from the boot
black in the street to dignified Jus
tices of the Supreme Court.
"Having gone the limit in saving
material in the make-up of the dress
from the neck down, the American
girl now startles the world with her
economy and retrenchment on. the
other end."
THE FIRST STEP.
One cent "drop" letter .postage will
probably become a reality as a result
"A legislation whicfi it is expected tin
present session of Congress will en
act as a first move in the direction of
a general rate of one cent for ordinary
letters.
An active campaign has been in
progress for the last five years look
ing towards one cent letter nostace.
(This has culminated in a definite
I agreement on the part of legislative
....n. : t-i- Li a. i L
.lutiiui icit:s ul v (isuuigioii to grant a
'one-cent local rate in all cities aud

is the first step, the one which counts.
