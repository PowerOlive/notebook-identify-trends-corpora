The commencement v exercises of
fcha M. F. C. which began ;lastFriday
night were continued Monday,, the
most of the day being devoted to, the
alumnea of the college. The services
began at 10 a. m.t with a good repre-
) - c j.t : j i.
semacion ot tuis suuieuy present,
representing this ad other states.
The address of welcome was deliver
ed by Mrs. 0. B. Smith, the response
by Mrs. Leslie Shrout, of Owingsville.
The princi Dal feature of the mornin?
was an address by Rev. J. D. Redd,
of Paintsville, a graduate of the Ken
tucky Wesley an College when located
here. His wife was a graduate of M.
P. C. and a daughter is a member of
the class of 1912. He paid a glowing
tribute to Millersburg when fce re
f erred to the removal of the Ken
fcuckian Weslevan College to Win
Chester by the Southern Methodist
Conference. He moved eyery heart
with pride when ne touched on the
noble womanhood that had gone put
from this institution and were doing
good work in this broad laud of ours.-
, The roll call ot classes followed,
and when the 'class, of 1857 was called
Mrs. America Butler, ot Millersburg,
was present and,.recerved a hearty
applause. The musical program was
J good. At the close of the exercises
the alumni went into secret session
for a short time, electing officers for
the coming year and transacting other
business. At 1 p. m. , tne alumnea
.banquet took place in tha dining
of the college. The alumni and a few
invited guests took their places at the
tables under the. beautiful strains of
sweet music by Miss Alma Duke
Jones and Esther K. Nell. After
luncheon toasts were delivered with
Mrs. W. M. Britt as ' toastmistress.
At the close of the banquet an in-
formal reception was held in the li
brary and parlors of the college from
3 to 5. At 8 p. m , the annual concert
took place in" the auditorium. A
large audience was present and an en
joyable program was rendered. Miss
Best who is in charge of the piano de
partment is thouroughly accomplish
ed and one of the best instructors in
Kentucky, having for two years
studied under som eminent masters in
Germany. The result of her efforts
were reflected by her pupils.
Tuesday at 10 a. m. the annual
commencement exercises took placu
in the auditorium. The spirit of
pride throbbed in every heart when
the 1912 class proceeded by their lady
and gentleman ushers'fiied in solemn
procession down the aisle and took
their places on the rostrum. The
principal feature of the morning was
the address of Dr. Richard Wilker
son, of Louisville. He took as the
basis of his thought the "Economic
of Education." Jn the opinion of
many who heard him it was the best
literary address delivered in Millers
burg on a commencement occasion.
A brilliant musical program was
rendered during the exercises. Fol
lowing the address Dr. C.C. Fisher,
president of the college, in a brief
talk presented the diplomas to the
class of 1912. The following consti
tuted the senior class.' Adwina Am

Margaret Stanara, of Pueblo, Col,,
receiving the highest, an average of

ceived an average above ninety-five.
With the commencement exercises
of 1912 closes one of the most bril-.
liaht as well as the most successful
years in the history of the M. F. C.
This was also one of the most, bril
lsant commencement seasons, while
there were not many out of town
guests present, visitors in the various
homes as we have had in the past, yet
all the exercises were, greeted with
large audiences, and were it not for
the help proposition there would have
been more visitors in our homes.
