Tourists and automobile travelers
between Lexington and Cincinnati re
port to local garages that the best
Toad between Cincinnati and Lexing
ton is through Alexandria, Butler,
Falmouth, Cynthiana and Paris. This
is a decided boost for the Licking
Valley Highway, an enterprise in
which Paris and Bourbon county peo
ple are greatly interested.
QUICK ACTION SAVE NICHOLAS
COUNTY TOWN
STRAY FORD POUND
The Falmouth Outlook says: "Mr.
and Mrs. Frank Cushman awoke the
other morning and found a Ford
touring car parked in their side
yard. It stood there for several days
and they became puzzled. It was not
Santa Claus season and they began
to think that someone had played a
joke on them. However, after a
lapse of several days a man from
North Middletown, Ky., came
Falmouth and claimed the car."
The village of Barterville probably
was saved from a ruinous fire by the
quick work of William Earlywine,
whose attention was attracted by a
flickering light in the general store.
He secured a key, knocked down a
flaming kerosene lamp and hurled it
from the door a second before it ex
ploded and showered the road with
burning oil.

The generally hot weather exist
ing throughout the country ha3
caused more than a normal seasonal
decrease in the total production of
eggs, butter and cheese, and this,
coupled with the good demand for
these products has produced higher
market values.
The movement of spring chickens,
as is natural at this time of the year,
is increasing.
Careful handling in the production
and marketing of poultry, eggs and
butter by the producer, especially
during the heated season, contrib
utes to improved products, better
values and better satisfaction to the
ultimate consumer.
