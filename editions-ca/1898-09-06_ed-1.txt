Satisfied That the Sick Aroas Well Cared for as They CouldBe in a Field HospitalWashington Aug 5 Secretary Alger who returned late Saturday nightfrom New York after his inspectiontour through Camp Wikoff at MontaukPoint with President McKinley andseveral of the bureau officials of thewar department commented Sundaynight upon the conditions of the campand stated the results of his visit Thesecretary saidI feel certain after a careful examination of Camp Wikoff and a thorough investigation of its conditionsthat everything possible is being donefor the men both sick and well whoare detained there The camp is anadmirable one the best I think Iever saw The site is ideal It isbeautiful without being picturesqueand is as neaitntm a camplocation as could be found in the eastern countryWhile the conditions are as goodas could reasonably be expected in thecircumstances even better than I everknew them to be in a camp a shade oigloom is cast over the encampment bythe physical condition of the menSickness suffering and death marwhat would otherwise be a magnificent military picture These conditions however are not the result ofthe situation of the camp itselfbut o the terrible campaignthrough which the troops have justpassed That campaign of Santiagowill be memorable in the military history of the world It was wonderfulboth in its conduct and in the resultsaccomplished Few military expertsexpected when the campaign wasinaugurated that such a success couldbe achieved in so short a time Itwas a tremendous undertaking to begin a campaign in a tropical countryduring the rain season against a position naturally so strong and so welldefended as was Santiago That success was achieved so soon and with aloss comparatively so small is due tothe energy and ability of Gen Shafterand his commanding officers and thedash bravery and splendid fightingqualities of the men of Gen ShafterscorpsThe president was particularly solicitous about the condition of themen who are ill He went to CampWikoff to ascertain for himself whether the men in the ranks needed anything they were not getting His orders were that they shduld want fornothing but he desired personatIytoknow whether these orders were being carried out After several hoursof patient investigation and careful examination he left thecamp satisfied that the men wereas well cared for as they could be in afield hospital He took no officialsword for anything He had come tothe camp to see ior himself and hisconviction as to the conditions wasreached only after he had come in personal contact with those conditionsIn the hospitals he went from ward tqward almost from cot to cot stoppingevery few seconds to talk to the sickmen and cheer them with a kind expression or a grasp of the hand Itwas an experience not soon to beforgotten Success of the visitas President McKinlej made to CampWikoff Saturday is almost unique inthe military annals He went to thecamp equipped with knowledge judgment and experience to make an investigation He had served in the campand in the field himself and he knewjust what ought to be expected in thecircumstances That he was reasonably well satisfied

Sept 2 The Echo says there5s reason to believe that the ministerof justice has taken steps toward ordering a new trial for ex Capt DreyfusIt is significant the paper adds thatLieut Col Henry committed suicideshortly after being visited by an officer of the general staff who after aprolonged stay ordered the sentry atthe door not to disturb Henry as hehad a great deal of work to do Afterthe departure of the officer HenTy must have written his farewell letters including telegramsaddressed to Gen Jioiadeffre and M Cavaignac minister of war and then cut4his throat An officer of high rank isauthority for the statement that MCavaignac is convinced that Henry didjCmot initiate the forgery of the fabricated letter and every effort will be madeto discover his accomplicesIt is rumored that the arrest ofLieut Col Pcty de Clam is imminentand there is also a widespread beliefthat a majority of the officers of thegeneral staff will resignLater in the day La Patrie anmounced that Col Paty de Clam hadbeen arrested for complicity in theDreyfus forgeryParis Sept 2 It is now insinuatedthat the suicide of Lieut Col Henryihe chief of the intelligence department of the French minister for warwas connived at by the French armyauthorities In any case the suiicide occurred shortly after theprisoner had received a visittfrom an officer of the general staffwho on leaving ordered the sentryon duty before CoL Henrys place ofConfinement not to disturb the prisoner as he had a lot of work to do Itis recalled that a similar opportunityto commit suicide was afforded toDreyfus who however declined toprofit by itParis Sept 2 The Dreyfus casepresents no new features but there isa plentiful supply of rumors The first4bf these is that Dreyfus it dead no letter having been received from him forsome weeksAnother reDort is that Genfre who has just resigned the post ofchief of the general staff has committed suicide Both these rumors areundoubtedly without foundation ColPaty du Clam is on a vacation trip inSwitzerland and there is noof the statement of La Patrie thathe had been arrested for complicity inthe Henry forgeryThe Public Debt StatementWashington Sept 2 The monthlystatement of

Santiago de Cnba and Locked HisFleet in the HarborParis Sept From a responsiblediplomatic source it is learned thatAd m Cervera will be court martialedupon his return to Spain and in allprobability severely reprimanded ordegraded in the service This actionwill undoubtedly arouse the chivalroussympathy of Americans against theSpanish ministry The trial of Cervera however is not merely a cloakto hide the administrative weakness ofSpain in the late warThe Spanish commission which corresponded to the war board at Washington had prepared a definite plan ofsampaign Adm Cervera was orderedto proceed to Martinique where hewas informed of the position of Sampsons ships From Martinique he wasordered to Havana by a certain courseDn which he could be reached at several points by dispatch and supplyships All went well according to the plan up to Cerreras departure from MartiniqueNo sooner had the Cape Verdefleet left Martinique than the Spanishboard realized the f utility of any navalLEADING CHARACTERSBioperations in Cuban waters Thismay seem a remarkable statement butit is a positive fact thatjdispatch boatswere to be hurried to meet Cerveraand order him to the PhilippinesPlans for coal and supplies had beencarefully laid to meet this emergencyBut Cervera taking matters into hisown hands instead of following thecourse prescribed leading to Havanadeliberately locked himself up in SantiagoThe dispatch boats hunted in vainfor the fleet and the naval board founditself helpless Thus it was that Camaras nondescripv fleet was hurriedlyprepared to do what had been plannedfor Cerveras more effective squadronThe Spanish had planned to keep Cain aras fleet at home for defense TheWatson bluff ruined this last effort toreach Manila Adm Cervera will becalled before a Spanish court of navalinquiry and asked to explain why he disobeyed ordersFrench naval authorities say that Cervera will undoubtedly be found guiltyand will be degraded The wholestory gives a curious insight into theseeming lack of executive force atMadrid and shows that the authoritiesat the last moment recognized thehopelessness of accomplishing dnjthing in American waters It throwsthe

thenarrow gauge track between Jem andthe mines of Big Horn gulch but theywere in the hands of the strikers andcarried chiefly armed men and munitions of murder They brought theposse of 50 men who had detailed themselves for special duty at the mineFaith witnessed this ill omened arrival from the second story gallerywhere she was walking alone in thestarlight herself being unseen in theshadow of the roof She watched themovements of the men with anxiety andsaw them in threatening consultationwith Abby Even as she listened to thesound of their bodeful voices her ownname was under discussion and themen were proposing to put her to thequestion concerning the whereaboutsof the spyDont bother with her its timewasted for nothing Abby advisedShe was asing Wan about him herself this morning and Wan was sulkyand scared and pretended he didntknow But I saw you going awajsomewhere with him says she Thatswhat she said I heard her myselfYou bet he knows all there is to cnowYou go find WanThe doctor also had witnessed theominous arrival and was at that moment in the cellar warning the refugees to be ready and to have out theirlight in case it should be seen whenthe cellar door opened to admit

he mighthave occasion to display for Mike hada warm Irish imagination and he wasas vain of his valor as he was sure ofit The doctor had omitted to mention as a detail of his plan that hehad not as yet presented the same toFaith He was deliberately conspiring with the cruel circumstances thatbeset the girl to capture all her scruplesat once there was no other way butto harden his heart against doubts andcompunctions and to put confidencein the men he had chosen in the placeof her natural protectors The doctor was no bungling judge of malecharacter and in his opinion ainanmay be a young girls natural protectorin other than the established waybut the doctor was not yet a fatherAs he left the cellar his ear waschocked by a sound of pitiable screamsand hoarse brutal cries and lookingacross the gulch he saw as in a visionof the Inferno a wretched strugglingngure haled along at the end of arope towed by a mass of men as fastas they could go over the rough groundin the direction of the secret tamaracksThe person of the victim was scarcelydistinguishable but the doctor knewit could beonly the miserable Chinaman ad a strange familiarity withthe fact crossed him as if he had beheldthe shameful scene before in some moment of prophetic consciousness andhad always known that such would bethe end of WanIn that horror stricken momentFaith had flown to her father forgetful of the breach between them andconfident of his protection for thewretched Wan She could not yetcount him as naught or quite believefor all the doctors unrelenting summing up of facts that

at the bottom of his sudden latedemand for his daughters society inthe west if he had fancied that it wouldimpart a trifling zest to his jaded existence to have youth and beauty nearhim and increase his popularity withhis brother mine owners at a criticaltime he had been properly disappointed in the sequel The cloud of suspicion that rested on the mine had neverlifted the time had not been suitedto an exchange of hospitalities evenwith a beautiful young daughter to beintroduced to the society of the campsIt brought not tho aoctor but Darcie Hamiltonout of tne cellarand all the brightness Faith hadbrought with her to the Big Horn andthat promise of adaptability that herfather had welcomed in her had beenextinguished under the burden of himself and his elderly failings which shehad taken upon her virgin conscienceIt was simply keeping a recording angel in the house for his sole and personal benefit one who wept perhapsbut never dropped a tear upon thepage where her fathers slips were unfalteringly set down The grief of hisangel had never interfered with thestrictness of her record It was preposterous He smiled with sardonicenjoyment of the joke that he was tobe reformed at his time of life according to the maiden aunt school oftraining But it was also a beastly annoyance it sent him often to the society of those familiars which he keptunder lock and key in his sideboardcloset With his daughter presidingconscience wise over personal habitsand with Darcie Hamilton investigating his business management it wasno wonder that a frail minded old gentleman with a rather darkling recordshould have gone off somewhat in histemper Heaven and earth was he tobe baited childrenTTa had said to Faith that she couldnot go without extraordinary precauVra imr snfntv in

for itscare The king felt no inclination towade through this heap of learninghimself and ordered his well fed andwell paid librarians to furnish himwith extracts for his private use Theyset to work and in 20 years time produced a nice little encyclopedia whichmight easily have been carried by 30camels But the monarch found it stilltoo large and had not the patience toread even the preface The indefatigable Brahmins began afresh withtheir labors and reduced the libraryso greatly that a single ass could carryit comfortably but the kings dislikefor reading had increased with age andhe was

and some of them havebeen tried for lessening the work ofcarting farm produce into town Thetraction engine is used for that purpose to a considerable extent in England although in America very littlelauling is done therewith Thenagain there has been a good deal oftalk about laying broad guttered railson the common highway for the wheelsof the ordinary wagon to run in Thisis a rather more popular idea and hasa prgmising future in our own countryIn some parts of the United Statesthere are trolley lines reaching outthrough the rural regions and carry-STROLLEY FARM WAGONing not only passengers but also mailand express matter Inside limits in many places special trolley carsare made for local postal and expressservice and in the vicinity of verylarge cities one will sometimes findthat a certain style of low platformcars are provided by the steam roadsfor carrying into town the heavytrucks of the market gardeners ladenwith fresh vegetablesAnd now still another plan has beenproposed A Toledo man named Bonner has devised a special truck whichas designed to run on a street railwayand to carry a farm or express wagon Inasmuch as the ordinary vehiclewould not lit the truck Mr Bonnerthinks it better to have his own wagonis well as his railway truck He hastaken out a patent on the idea andLas obtained a franchise from the cityof Toledo for running his wagonsThrough the streets As soon as helias manufactured and sold a numberof his special wagons to the expresscompanies in town and has also had afew of his trucks made he wrill be in aposition to take the wagons on thetrucks through such streets as havetrolley lines The trucks are intended to be coupled to a trolley car andare not provided with electric motorsof their own rAfter the city service is fairly started Mr Bonner will endeavor to securerural patronage Of course it will benecesary for such farmers as wish totake advantage of his plan to have theTight sort of wagons and to haul themby horsepower near enough to town toreach the trolley tracks But in Ohiothere are Tiumerous trolley roads extending from one town to another andattaining a length of ten 15 and even-25 miles M a farmer only lives alongone of these routes he will not needto haul his wagons more than a fewrods Indeed if he has a switch andsidetrack and loads his wagons whilethey stand on the latter he will havean easy taslc before him The rapid development of trolley lines through therural districts nowadays makes MrBonners idea an interesting oneThere is no telling how far it is liketyto becoTne -serviceable to

6 1898-BROAD TIRED WAGONSExhaustive Tests Show Tiexn to BeIniinitely Superior lto theNarrow VarietyThe use of the bicycle is affording anlilustration of the operalion of thebroad tired vehicles in keeping roadways in good condition This illustration is conspicuous after showerswhen it will be noted that the tires ofthe bicycles beat down and hardenthe bicycle path much more rapidlythan the narrow tired wagons restorethe roadway proper to a smooth condition It is true that the action ofthe pneumatic tire is more beneficialto a soft roadway than that of thehard broad tire but its tamping effect is an illustration of what thewide tire does in comparison with thecutting effect of the conventional narrow tireWere it possible to substitute broadtires for the narrow ttires now generally used the condition of the average countrj road would be improvedin a comparatively short time Notonly that but the efficiency of thethe average draught horse would bematerially raised Instead of cuttinginto the soft spots in a roadway thewide tire compresses the soft earthand passes over it leaving the spot iran improved condition for the pasacre of the next wheelAn exhaustive test of the broad andnarrow tire made at the agriculturalexperiment station of the Missouristate university demonstrated that onhard smooth and nearly level macadam roadways the strain required tohaul a given load was 357 per cent lesswith the broad tire than with the narrow tire On a gravel road with a hardsurface there was a margin of 333 percent in favor of the broad tire Ona road composed of a large quantityof sand mixed witfcigravel the marginwas 455 per cent in favor of thebroad tire Over a new unused drygravel road the difference in favor ofthe broad lire Avas 266 per cent Thenarrow tire required less strain forhaulage on a load where water covered the surface and loose sand fromone to two and a half inches deep wasfound But while the broad tire requried a greater strain for haulage itdid no injury to the road whereas thenarrow tire cut through the soft earthbeneath the water and destroyed thesurfacing The broad tire was also ata disadvantage on roads where thehardpan was covered with dust as thenarrow tire cut through to the hardpan while the wide tire pinched andheaped up the dust and thus increasedthe strain of haulage The broad tirealso required a greater strain on somekinds of mud roads But asa wholethe tests were strongly favorable tothe use of broad tires for the averageroads Milwaukee WisconsinCORNERS OF THE SILOAh Eastern Farmer Explains How HHas Solved the

undertakers are a cheerful lotof people much given to professional joking and taking the cares ofthe world lightly on their shouldersThe gravediggers are employed bthe superintendents of the various cemeteries and are recruited from theranks of laborers who are employedfrom day to dayAt Greetfivood cemetery a regularforce of 50 gravediggers is constantlyemployed and when there are manyfunerals extra men are taken on Thegravediggers am paid 16 cents per hourand sometimes work 12 hours a dayBefore the last hot wave there wereonly eight interments per day on theaverage and when the hot wave set inthe average jumped up to 30 per dayWhen there are no graves to be dugthe gravediggers fill in their sparetime mowing the lawns in front of thevaults They sometimes sing as theywork One of the

of a grave digger issought after a good deal by the laborers as it means constant work Thegravediggers crack jokes as they pursue their avocation just as the gravediggers in Hamlet but their jokeshave no venom in them Most ofthem save their money and invest it insmall houses near the cemetery Thenthey bring their wives and childrenout on slimmer afternoons for a strollamong the gravesA number of years ago the Greenwood gravediggers founded a local assembly of the Knights of Labor knownas the Yorick Labor club Its yearlypicnics were attended by all the choicespirits in other trades unions Afterawhile the gravediggers in Calvarycemetery formed a rival union Thena war of extermination began Eachunion started in to cut rates andgraves in the language of an indignant member of the Yorick Labor clubwere going to the dogs Finallyboth the organizations went to piecesAbout a year ago a movement wasstarted to revive the Yorick Laborclub by recriting members from thegravediggers in all the
