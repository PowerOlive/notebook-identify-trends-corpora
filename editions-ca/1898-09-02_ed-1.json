A WONDERFUL FOND
Human Eyes Are Often Inhabited by
Large Numbers of Living Creatures
The water contained in a well de
veloped well formed eye in which the
Bight is not impaired more especially
where a person is farsighted presents
many curious phenomena Looking
through an open window in daylight
upon a hazy atmosphere or upon a fog
such as is seen in any city or looking
t5 the north upon a gray atmosphere
one will see if conditions are as above
strange disks flitting and jumpiug about
in the eye water It has been my privi
lege to watch these organisms for
eral years flitting about in the eTo
water jumping toward each other again
in strife and combat in the which the
water would become comparatively
char of amcebifcrm organisms only to
he again full of micrococci and the com
bals as above
The various shapes of these auimal
cuhe are Fuiprisitg Some are attenu
ate d with line filaments Again others
are like wee bits of fine porcelain with
little projections reminding one of
turtles hopping about Again others
present the appearance of cyclops and
daphne
water is a rnystery perhaps in the
water we drink or foods we eat either
or both The fact that the eye water is
inhabited like all other bodies of water
is a truth that can be proved positively
beyond peradventure by any oculist
when he may extract a diseased eye
and place the fluid under the glass
May not the accumulation of these
organisms in the eye water their rapid
growth and the survival of the fittest
or strongest be the cause of much blind
ness wherein may be casts coagulation
of the eye water so called paralysis of
the optic nerve cataracts and other
forms of disease
May not numerous headaches and
other pains be caused by the overac
cumulation or growth of these minute
organisms in which they stop the cir
culation of the active principle of life
in the arterial circulation or the nerv
ous forces The same organisms are seen
when looking upon drawing paper

Senator Pettus Fropliccy
This is a story that au Alabamiari
tellB about Senator Pettus and ex-Senator
Pugh During Mr Clevelands
first administration Mr Pettus was
anxious to fill the place on the supreme
court bench to which Senator Lamar
was afterward appointed He applied
to his friend Senator Pugh and the
latter made an earnest and sincere ap
peal for the appointment of Mr Pettus
The president inquired as to the age of
Pettus and when informed said he was
too old Senator Pugh communicated
this fact to Pettus and also suggested
to another eminent but younger lawyer
in his state to apply for the place as it
was a settled fact that a southern man
would surely succeed to the vacancy
Senator Pettus heard of Senator Pughs
letter to the other friend and it made
him mad Coming to Washington he
called on PurIi and asked him why he
did not stand out for him Pugh ex
plained that Mr Cleveland would not
alter his determination about not ap
pointing a man of Pettus age but this
did not satisfy Pettus Before leaving
Pugh Pettus said Well I may be too
old to sit on the supreme bench of the
land but I am not too old to sit in the
senate and your seat will just about fit
me Pettus was as good as a prophet
He succeeded Senator Pugh on the 4th
of March last and if I am not mistaken
occupies the identical seat which Pugh
occupied during a former term Sena
tor Pugh was 77 last December Sena
tor Pettus is 76 Washington Post

Strange Domestic Pets
Mr Hutchison while British resi
dent at Kurnassi had a panther pre
sented to him by the king of Ashanti
This animal he succeeded in taming
and transformed from a forest terror
into a domestic pet Charles James Fox
had a young tiger which showed great
affection for him until one day while
licking its masters hand it scraped off
the skin At the first taste of blood its
dormant instincts returned and its
glaring eyes revealed to Mr Fox his
danger Without attempting to remove
his hand he led it by gentle words into
the next room where a loaded pistol
hung over the mantelpiece Reaching
it down he shot his now dangerous pet
through the head

THE RIVER OF LIFE
Tis n fleeting changeful river
Blent of calm and crusted wave
Flowing in and out forever
Tween the cradle and the grave
Changeful river ever flowing
Narrower and broader growing
Flowing flowing ever going
Toward the still and solemn sea
Forms of light and shapes of shadow
Float upon its troubled bieast
Through the moorland and the meadow
On the waters will not rest
Here a bud by churl hand wrested
Flung into tho angry foam
There a flower with blooms invested
Plucked and ravished from its home
Youth end age and st rength asad weakness
Beauty innocence and sin
Pride and power and love and meekness
Ail in turn are galheied in
Time and Death two grand old wrders
Watch it rise and mark it flow
Death upon the sLill seas borders
Bids the ire wind on it blow
Changeful river fond hearts parting
In that still and solemn sea
Joined to heal the grief and smarting-
Eud and flower with stem shall be
For oer Time and Death an angel
Gods strong angel walks the waves
Claiming with his trump Evangel
All that pass within th grave
Claiming for his Lord and Master
By the flaming eross lie- wears
All though battered by disaster
All the sullen river bears
Changeful river ever flowing
Narrower and broader growing
Flowing flowing ever going
Toward the still and solemn aea

DONKEY DOG AND GOAT
The Three Great Sights of a- Transconti
nental Journey
The three oddest things that I saw
outside of New York said- a New
Yorker who had gone overland to Den
ver aud returned by water by way of
Galveston were a donkey a dog and
a goat The donkey was the motive
power of the single bobtail car that
goes up the hill on South Broadway
Denver He was an amusing follow
After I made my first trip up that steep
hill I was astonished to see thecon
ductor unhitch the donkey aud put him
aboard the car The dashboard was fit-
How these organisms get into the eye ted up as a sort of stall and he stoodt
there sideways when the car started
back down the hill under its ownimi
petus The donkeys face took on a de
lighted expression as he found himselfs
in the role of passenger He really
seemed to be grinning at the conductor
and the passengers
1 saw the dog as I was about to
the Taber Opera House in Denver
The dog was called Bill and he was
part of the outfit of a cigar store in the
opera house building Ho was a black
spaniel He was- rigged up in Zouave
trousers and jacket trimmed with gold
braid had a tasseled fez on his head
and spectacles on his nose The oddest
thing about him was that he sat on his
haunches writh his paws in the air
actually smoking a cigarette like a con
firmed cigarette fiend I found that he
had been trained to smoke the cigarettes
while the audience was going into the
theater as an advertisement of his own
ers business That was the first time
I had ever seen a dog smoking
I made the acquaintance of the goat
in a tobacco factory in Key West There
were 200 Cuban girls there nearly all
of them pretty aisd all of them smokers
orchewers of tobacco The goat was
their particular pet He was the biggest
goat I ever saw almost as large as a
Shetland pony with big branching
horns and perfectly tame He playfully
butted the girls or pranced around
among them His best trick however
was the larceny of their dinner baskets
He used to go nosing around until he
found a particularly choice luncheon
He would knock over the basket seize
the lunch and dash outdoors with it
No amount of chastisement had ever
broken him of the trick Of course I
saw wonderful scenery in the journey
but the donkey and the dog and the
goat were by long odds the most inter
esting livingthings that I encountered

A Clever Lawyer -
An old lawyer in Paris had instruct

every time he struck the desk with his
hand Unfortunately the barrister for
got and struck the desk at the wrong
moment The client fell to sobbing and
crying
What is the matter with you
asked th presiding judge
Well he told me to cry as often as
he struck the table
Here was a nice predicament but
the astute lawyer was equal to the oc
casion Addressing the jury he said
Well gentlemen let me ask you
how you can reconcile the idea of crime
in conjunction with such candor and
simplicity I await your verdict wieh
