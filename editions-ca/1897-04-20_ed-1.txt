with Jerry In the lumbercamps Jerry was the strongest bestnaturcd worker among the men During slack days the pair huntedtrapped and snowshoed together andTerry came to love the boy as he had- never loved any other human being Jimiwas as dear to him as the forest or thebeautiful OswegatchieThe cold weather broke suddenlywith warm rains The river rose- carrying hundreds of logs down stream untilthey caught upon some rocks forminga dangerous jam a quarter of a mileabove the Windfall Then the riverfroze again and the men could walk onthe ice almost to the foot of the tangleof logsBut one morning a warm south windrose increasing to a violent windstormas the day wore on The softened icebegan to xound against the jam fromabove and the loggers stood idly aboutwaiting for the break On the

HINTSTHE ROAD QUESTIONHow Progressive Farwers SlictiltlView TIi is Important ProlilcmItis only during1 seasons of abnormalrainfall that the average farmer feeisdisposed to manifest a more thaninterest in the subject of road improvement Jn most sections the settling of the roads Tate in the spring settles for the time being the general agitation of this question That it will bobOpagain with renewed emphasis is justas certain as that the roads will breakup in the fall for neglect of highwaysat anv time only intensifies their badconditions Eternal vigilance andeternal agitation seems to be the priceof good roads in this country It wouldseem that the most conservative manwould need only to open his eyes to themiserable condition of country roadsin many of the states during a greatpart of the year and consider carefullythe annual cost of maintaining- themAn such condition to realize thatroadmaking methods and the sj stem underwhich the are applied are seriousty atfault We believe a majority of thefarmers in the states referred to knowWilliWWHAT A ROAD SHOULD BEthe present system to be wrong otherwise they would show their faith bytheir works they would no longer feeljustified in performing 3 worth oflabor on the farm one day and 150Morth on the road the nextWe have long stood with those whothink the road tax should be collectedin money and have paid cash for severalyears but under the present system ofroad management it cannot always beapplied to the best advantageIn some sections even where greatclaims were made for the naturallygood condition of the roads the bountiful crops sometimes lie unmovedthrough a period of high prices simplybecause the naturally bad condition ofthe roads at certain seasons of the yearforbids the hauling of loads Farmersstudy and plan and work to increaseproduction they the law of supply and demand they watch the mar3ets that they may be enabled to selltheir produce when prices are bestin short the many of them do theirpart as well as far as their own privatebusiness is concerned On the otherhand the railroads and elevators areever ready to do their part as far astljeir private business of handling thefarmers produce is concerned Underthese conditions what is to hinder theintelligent farmer from always pushinghis produce into market at such time ashis best judgment dictates Simply theweakness of the connecting link thehighway the one thing over which thepeople have full control There aretimes when the farm is practicallymuch farther from the nearest villagethan the village is from the great martto which it is tributary and until theweak link is made strong farming willnot be as generally profitable as itotherwise would be The EpitomistDAIRY SUGGESTIONSMilk of different temperatures shouldnever be mixedWith cows long in

tle Feathered Visitors ShouldHe Carefully ProteeeffThe farmer who pretends to keepup with the times provides himselfwith all the modern appliances whichare adapted to his businessIf part of the land is marsh he willunderlay it with the most approvedsystem of drainage if it has not beenproperly cultivated he buys the bestsubsoil plows in order that the richeswhich lie just below the surface maybe brought to light The fertilizers which he thinks best adapted tothe crop which he wishes to cultivateare procured and applied with a lavishhand knowing as he does that this expenditure will repay him perhapsa hundredfold The enterprising farmer calls to his aid not only all the improved tools and improvements for cultivation irrigation and protection butinvokes also all the forces of naturewhich can in any way assist him Helifts the subsoil and invites the air tohelp him pulverize it he erects a windmill and asks the wind to aid in raising the water with which to irrigatehe digs ditches and calls urion the water which the wiud power has liftedto do its part in nourishing the parchedearth Thus his vegetables his grainand his grasses through an intelligentuse of natures forces spring up andflourish for a time but only to meetnew dangers ZSow the insects appear upon the scene and the aspectchangesCan it be that the farmer has put himself to all this great expenditure of labor tools material and time only tobe thwarted at last It certainly looksso But nature which was responsiblefor the dangernowprovldes the remedyand that remedy is the birds whichcome in regular order each spring almost as 3 egular as the seasons In theBigelow Papers this reference ismadcto the blackbirds in A Xew EnglandSpringFust come theblackbirds clatterin intall treesAn settlin things in windy congressesQueer politicians though for Ill beskinnedEf all on em dont head against the -windThen the blackbirds are soon followed by others and when the propertime comes each family does it fullduty and the insects are obliged tosuccumb It is stated by competent authority that the red winged blackbirdsdestroyed in a single locality morethan 10000000000 insects during oneseason The blackbird does not rivalPatti as a singer but it does attendstrictly to business and its businesslike that of an entomologist is bugsIut long before this other birds havebeen working for the farmer searchingall the hidden places under the bark oftrees about old stumps amidst themoss and dead leaves and in otherplaces which the farmer never dreamsof for the concealed larvae1 where theembryo insects are thus destroyed bythe million One of the most industrious of these early workers is theBrown Creeper which searches everytree as if it had a special contract tosecure a certain number of specimensof larvae every week Thus does thisbird like may others take time by theforelock and destroy millions of insects before they lune a chance toemerge from this first stage of their existenceBut we must not forget our old friendthe robin of which it is saidBy some name or otherAll men who know him call him brotherThe robin is more than a brother tothe farmer for by his activity in devouring insects he sometimes benefitsthe farmer more than could a -realbrotherIlave the farmers any adequate ideaof the aluc of the services renderedthem by the birds The best authority states that the biids effect saving tothe country each year of not less than100000000 The farmer should be thebirds best friend and stanch defender for it is the birds alone which standbetween the farmer and the loss ofhis crops But argues some picayune tiller of the soil the birds oatmy cherries and the crows pull up mycorn ami Im bound to kill emThe Smithsonian Institution longago sent out a warning to the farmerso the country regarding the impendingextinction of the birds and the direful results which are sure to followWhen the last bird yields its life tothe pot hunter or is offered up to satisfv the demands of that tvrant DameFashion then and only then willsome farmers see where they have erredbut it will be too late The ruin willhave been wrought the damage doneThe farmer should see to it that theboys and girls of his neighborhood aretaught that the killing of birds orrobbery of their nests is a crime notonly an injury to their neighbors butan actual harm to themselves for beyond all question the destruction of thebirds will cause the boys and girls ofthe present day to weep bitter tears ofrepentance later in life when they realize the harm which has been done andthey will reap the penalty Under theold English law and ours as well amans house is his castle and the manhas a right to defend his home evento the extent of killing the man whotries to enter without permission Willanyone attempt to say that a bird whobuilds a nest in which it lays its eggsand rears its young has no right to protection It has the right of ownershiprven by a power higher than the authority which granted the titles to theland on which we live a title from itsCreator and yoursWhy should I deprive my neighborOf his goods against his willHands were made for honest laborSot to plunder nor to stealTie who robs a birds

theRochester man leaning comfortablyback in his chair going through thelong grass after your prey at full peltVt first it seems as if only a miraclecan save your horse from tripping overthe burnt tip stumps and roots of coarseherbage but if you have a sure footedhorse a scramble or two is all that youwill probably suffer The chief dangerarises from blind nullahs dried tipvaster courses and jheels against whicheven the best trained beast will bite thedustShould the unlucky rider happen tobe thrown where the ground is hard asbaked bricks he will find it no jokefew get off witihoujt a real shaking Aman once told one that as a rule theworst falls were off small horses because when they came down- theyseemed to make less effort to save theniselves and so their burden strikes theground with the full and undiminished force that the pace creates Lastyear at Jodhpore the worst fall of tiheseason irom wnieii a laay sustainedsome terrible injuries that happily didnot prove fatal was one from an Arabpony that crossed his legs on the flatOn a day 1 well remember there werethree croppers two of them none toopleasant One man fell into a nullahand got a slight confcussiion a seconddid not keep his seat when Shis horsepecked badly over a root and camedown wiit h1 the thick and leaded butt endof his spear under his arm bruisinghis ribs badly and the third went headover heels just in front of meduringthelast run of the day in the thick grassWe v ere divided in several partiesin order to succesfuilly beat up tine highgrass Our party was mot so advantageously situated as the rest and twoboars had been killed before we had ahand in the game Then we struck afine old fellow that led us a prettychase before we finally brought him tothe ground As is well known there isno gamer animal on earth than ani oldboar He will charge a tiger and evenan eleplhant and never reckons for a moment the size or strength of the foetherefore when he is at bay he nearlyalways goes for the horse or if he getsa chance for the manAn exciting adventure occurred tocne of the native princes at Jodhporewhile I was there His horse fell withhim just as he had got up to a cunningiig that crossed and recrossed thehorses- stride and as he was on theground the boar came for him but in amoment he was up Jumping on oneside he caught the old pig by the hindlegs and held him until his companionscame up and got in their spearsOn the way back to the bungalowfrom this hunt we had a good gallopIn the far distance we saw a pig aheadof us going hard so off we darted atfull pace to ride him dawn Of hhe threeone fell heavily in the thick grass butwe others were lucky enough to keepour feet Bound by the rnaharajahsshooting tower went the pig and weafter him until at last after a run offour miles we Tcde him into anullahinand out of which he dodged first to oneside and then to the other until aftera short fight he had had his fill Altogether four old boars were killed to bebrought back in triumph while we wereat lunch at about 1230 oclock Themaharajah could not of course eatwith us oni account of his caste butcame in and smoked his cigarette in ourcompany immediately afterward Xoman was seriously hurt and no horsedamaged so with the sport we enjoyed it had truly been a delightfulday Rochester X Y UnionSULTAN GOES AT FULL SPEED5inlsters Have to Run to Keep Upvritli HimAbdul Hamid leads a life of retirement a political necessity which doesnot interfere with his amusementsOnce a week his visit to the mosque alaborious journey of some 80 yardsprovides the spectator with an admirable entertainment The card of theBritish embassy admits you to a pavilion where as the sultans guest youare handsomely refreshed with tea coffee sweets and cigarettes the eternalcigarettes without which the whole machinery of Turkish administrationwould cease to act If Abdul Ilamidknew that a visitor had lacked a cigarette I believe he would take to his bedand refuse to exercise that subtle humanitj for which his regime is so justly renownedOnce upon a time the commanderof the faitlif ul used to ride a white horseto the mosque That became too fatiguing and he took to a carriage whichwas driven slowly back to the palacewhile the ministers walked on eitherside Sometimes however such is thsimpetuosity of the sultans nature hedrives himself back in a park phaetonat so liery a pace that the unfortunateministers have to run clutching oneanother by the coattails for it is theirdutjr to reach the palace steps in timeto receive their gracious master whenhe alislits Should they
