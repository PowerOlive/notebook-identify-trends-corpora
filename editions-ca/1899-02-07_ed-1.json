A CRUEL OPERATION
WE PROCESS
SHELL
BY WHICH TORTOISE
IS PROCURED
Set the Living Turtle to
the Boar Layers of th Hnnu in
Which He Lives A Business That
tSlruck an Observer as Heartless
There are many articles of daily and
ibourly use constantly passing before
ur eyes and through our hands about
the production of which we know com
aratively little or nothing An inter
Feating example of this is tortoise shell
iom which oombs and hairpins are
groaflp besides a multitude of trinkets
Sar the dressing table the desk and
vihe pocket Fierce crusades have been
Instituted in recent years against the
ifilaughter of birds for the procurement
their plumage for hat trimmings
rand yet I venture to say that the proc
tsee of procuring tortoise shell is a cru
elty to animal life which far exceeds
that to which birds are subjected
In the eighties I happened to be down
In Blueficlds on that awful Mosquito
coast and at the invitation of one
JUanuel Latona who was the owner and
captain of a small schooner went with
Jtiim to the cay El Roncador for tortoise
shell This cay gets its name which in
English would be the Snorer from the
exceedingly angry surf which can be
heard for a long distance breaking over
the reefs This is the cay on which a
couple of years back the historic old
hip Kearsarge was wrecked and bat
tered to pieces El Roncador is nothing
more or less than a typical coral is
land such as is found throughout the
southern seas three quarters of a mile
long perhaps and not more than a j
quarter of a mile across its widest part I
Surrounding the island is a reef inside
of which the water is smooth and j
er shallow and at the bottom of this
shallow water there grows a peculiar
kind of sea grass which is a dainty
food for the turtle tribes There is also
found on the top of the water inside the
xeef a sort of small blubber fish called
in Spanish dedalcs cr thimble fish
which is perhaps the greatest delicacy
ii the entire turtle menu
The turtle whose shell is valued in
commerce is a small species known as
the hawk bill There are other varie
ties which come to El Roncador to
pawn but they are net molested Dur
ing the night the turtles crawl up on
the shore to lay their eggs each female
depositing on an average about 70 To
do this they dig holes in the sand about
two feet deep and fter laying the eggs
ovcr thczn CYX so deftly that it is al
most impossible for a novice to find
ihem These eggs are really delicious
Tivhen roasted but the turtle fishers are
careful not to destroy those they do not
take for food so as to promote as much
as possible the increase of this valuable
ea reptile At night the Ishers conceal
themselves along the shore as well as
possible and when the turtles come up
jf the wsr on the beach tbey rush
forth and turn them over on their backs
with iron hooks leaving them secure in
this position until morning
The tortoise shell of commerce is not
as is generally believed the horny cover
ing or shell proper of the turtle it is
the scales which cover the shield These
ficales are 13 in number 8 of them be
ing flat and the other 5 somewhat curved
Tour of those that are flat are quite
large sometimes being as much as 12
inches long and 7 inches broad nearly
transparent and beautifully variegated
in color with red yellow white and
dark brown clouds which give the ef
fects so fully brought out when the shell
is properly polished A turtle of aver
age size will furnish about eight pounds
ol these laminae or scales each piece
being from an eighth to a quarter of an
inch in thickness
It is the method by which these scales
are loosened which is the repulsive part
of the business The turtlts are not
killed as that would lead to their ex
termination in a very few years After
crturing them the fishers wait for day
J ht to complete the work The turtles
are turned over again in their natural
position and fastened firmly to the
ground by means of pegs Then a bunch
of dried leaves or sea grass is spread
evenly over the back of the turtle and
set afire The heat is not great enough
to injure the shell merely causing it to
separate the joints A large blade very
titular in shape to a chemists spatula
is then inserted horizontally between
tin laminae which are gently pried
ii m the back Great care must be tak
er not to injure the shell by too much
heat and yet it is not forced off until it
is fully prepared for separation by a
sufficient amount of warmth
The operation as one may readily
imagine is the extreme of cruelty and
many turtles do not survive it Most of
them do live however and thrive and
In time grow a new covering just as
a man will grow a new finger nail in
place of one he might lose The pecul
iarity of the second growth of shell
though is that instead of reproducing
t 3 original number of 13 segments it is
restored in one solid piece
To see the operation of taking the
shell from the living turtle once is
al jut all a man of northern breeding
wants of it and if the helpless reptiles
had the power of voicing their suffer
ings under it their cries would tell of
as heartless a business as man has yet
e gaged in Now York Post

DINING AND FEEDING
American Table Manners Not So Open to
Criticism as Formerly
It has been conceded that the degree
of civilization a people has reached may
be accurately measured by its dietary
Now some one has said that the
American feeds the Englishman de
vours the Frenchman dines In view
of this statement one wonders what the
English have been doing through the
centuries to have advanced so little We
do not pretend to answer for them but
would say for ourselves we have been
hewing our way through forests
neering in every direction in every
sense ample apology for feeding in
stead of dining
But of course it was a Frenchman
who made the declaration and of
course he made it long ago when mor
tifying though it be honesty compels
us to acknowledge that we may have
been guilty Times however and con
ditions have changed and not even the
most bigoted Frenchman will refuse to
admit that when the American has
reached the dining point he will have
more to dine upon than any other man
in the world The culture of man in
America w ill demand all the art in his
cuisine that France by study has evolv
ed with the added merit of honesty in
his food the disguises incident to

you look upon the wives and daughters

characters who have staid in the east
but sent no representatives abroad
These Jewesses love display and court
admiration They are much fairer than
the men milky skinned with a pale
pink flush as if they were hothouse
bred Their clothes are gay red green
and blue being their favorite colors
and the married women all wear decel
lete bodices fashioned very low in front
and showing a fancy shirt of embroidery
and lace which either reveals the mold
of their forms or makes startling ex
posures of the forms themselves Their
chests are always quite bare This in a
land where the other women expose
nothing but their eyes is all the more
astonishing On their cions the Jew
ish matrons wear very showy often
beautiful headdresses composed of a
cap of red green and yellow silk or
cloth that is carried down the back of
the head in a bag that envelops their
tresses Often these bags are finished

of the most significant scenes in the no tire indira ae ainst the ftprman
history of the new world It has been
brilliantly described and I may but
mention it
On June 14 3 671 a strange body of
men was assembled on this hill It was
composed of foar classes the official
representatives of the king of France
the Catholic missionaries the voyageurs
and the Indians Weeks before word
had been sent out to the chiefs of 14 of
the different tribes of Indians in the re
gion to meet at the Soo on the date
mentioned An immense cross of wood
was made and carried to the top of the
hill overlooking the swift flowing
rapids A stout timber with an en
graved plate on it was set up near the
deep hole in the ground which was to
hold the foot of the cross
When all had assembled St Lusson

singing People who were introduced to
me used to ask if I was German As I
speak French and not German I con
