SHE SPOKE AT LAST
hce upon a time thaw lived a king
o had an immense garden Its pathf
Wtto strewn with gayly colored sand i
the niches of its yew tree hedge stood
White marble statues and strange flowers
of burning colors surrounded the grass
Wit But in the middle of tho garden was
oad in the centor of which was a group
ofc fish tailed sea gods who sitting upon
scouting dolphins were biwlag their
akell trumpets
All the world admired this garde
3crewas only one person whom it did
Bt please This was the king younaf and
st beautiful daughter Those shameless
hen gods f risrhtened bar she al-
avoided the rden
therefore the king who loved hi
daughter above all the world sont for a
Jjang gardener who had travalad thjrougk
Xiny lands and had seen many splendid
tWngs and commanded him to make a
netw garden in place of the old ona He
wished to make a present of it to the prin
oass on her birthday
The gardener did- his best H dug and
chopped and he planted Sunshine and
rJn did their part also and when the
bitthday came the gardeneE stood at the
entrance gate and held a salver on which
he offered to the princess the golden keys
to the garden Followed by courtiers and
ladies in waiting the princess then made
a tour of the garden
The heart of the kings daughter leaped
within hor for joy She forsook the gravel
walk and sprang lightly over the lawn so
that her court ladies haddifficulty in keep
ing up with her But with measured tread
and a frequent shake of the head tho court
jenna folio wed the frolicsome young
p3 A nodding rose twig had stuck in her
Pv tiered hair ns she passed She thought
the new garden hideous
Sow the princess was nearing the spot
whero the marble basin had formerly had
a lace Today there lay a tiny smiling
green lake
Oh how charming exclaimed the
princess and the ladies repeated the word
after her
Then a dreadful thing happened A fat
green frog which was sitting in the reeds
looking out for water ladies being dis
turbed by the rustle of silken garments
made a gcac jump and plunged into the
water so violently that the drops spurted
up
JGvery one screamed and the princess
sank down all palo upon the ground
Nnw the courtduenna hastened her stops
and was shocked to see what had happen
ed Luckily musk and smelling salts were
easily found The fainting girl soon came
to herself but fright had taken away her
ppwer of speech With disturbed faces and
shaking with anxiety the ladies in waiting
carried her back to the palace
In honor of the princess the townspeo
ple had decked their houses with greens
and gay flags but when the midday hour
ohimed they removed all signs of decora
tion for Dame Rumor announced that tho
kings daughter had suddenly become
dumb
And unhappily this was no empty hear
eayw
The princess had long recovered from
her fright She could eat and drink but
no word passed her lips She had lost the
power of speech
Physicians came to her side They
caused all the circumstances to be told
them put their heads together and wrote
long prescriptions The pation swallowed
obediently drops pills and powders but
the power of speech did not return v
The whole court was draped in mourn
ing But the old king who was usually so
mild and kind foamed with rage He or
dered all the frogs in his kingdom to be
killed and set a price of a farthing on the
head of every frog and he threw the gar
dener into prison Of what use was it all
The princess remained dumb
Days weeks and months passed by
Physicians collected there from all corners
of the globe What one ordered tho other
always condemned but not one of them
could give backto the kings daughter her
power of speech Wise women and clever
shepherds were also sent for Even Master
Hammerlein the executioner was com
manded to come They plied their strange
and secret remedies but none of them
could help her
In the meantime the poor gardener was
in a sorry plight He had hoped for a rich
reward and now he was lying in chains
and could behold neither sun or moon
But his old mother was still living in the
homestead and she was a clever woman
of much experience When she heard what
had happened to her son she tied up her
bundle and wandered off to the kings
town When she arrived there she betook
herself to the prison and implored the
turnkey with such moving words that he
at last led her into the prison
The mother and son remained alone to
ge t4ior half an hour Then the old wom
an jRbbled cff But when the warder
bright his jug of water to the young
man he was walking about his cell with
his head high whistling a tune
Next day he demanded to be taken be
fore the king He claimed that he possess
ed the remedy which would restore the
power of speech to the princess
The princess had been obliged that same
fiay to under to a great deal First she had
been pricked with redhot needles by a for-
eign doctor At this she had groaned and
sobbed but not a word had she spoken
After that she had been given at the ad
vice of an old herb doctor the heart brain
and tongue of a magpie and this was also
quite useless Now the princess was lying
pale and languid on a couch so exhausted
that she had closed her eyes
Uey brought the gardener to her side
His chains were clanking but he walked
rect and seemed jp good spirits
Try your arts said tie king and if
-you cam cure her you shall receive the Or-
der of tffie Green Crocodile and as much
gold as you can carry V
r Vs
The eardener went to the invalids
7 couch made her sit up which she did
willingly took her little white hand in
ifis and gazedlnlo her tired eyes x
- Poor little princess he then said
So unhappy and only one and twenty
Jtsrs old
-Then a slight blush covered the
tess countenance her bosom rose and fell
pahifuliy and from her lips burst the
-words Not yet 19
The power of speech had returned to
- her But king wept tears of joy in
which the wholecoiirt joined him From

Wit of a Scotch Lunatic
This lunatic asylum story comes from
Glasgow Two councilors of that city
wero taken over a large asylum the other
day by one of the patients a safe man
He had led them to a room to display a
view from a window when some one
shut the door with its self acting lock
and the three men were prisoners The
patient alone preserved his composure
While the councilors clamored to be re
leased he remarked 1
If I were you I would be quiet
No help coming the councilors grew
desperate Beads of perspiration stood
on their brows od they fairly yelled
If I were you repeated the patient
soothingly I would keep quiet
But were no daft pleaded one of
the visitors

labor and Wealth t
Labor in some form is the means by
which the true wealth of a nation is in
creased and it ought to be the means
used to inorease the wealth of any indi
vidual The varieties of labor are so nu
merous that every healthy man and
woman can choose from among them
but to try to obtain money much or
little without rendering in some way a
fair equivalent lor it is to live a life of
dependence which is equally disgraoe
fuhunder whatever guise it may seek to
hide itself New York Ledger
Servant JLa nr
It will surprise most people to know
that there is an English law to punish

Great Newspaper
Without a single exception there
is beyond doubt no greater or more
popular newspaper in the United
States than the Cincinnati Enquirer
or a more successful publisher than
fts proprietor Mr John R McLean
The old time prices for the Daily
Enquirer have been maintained and
its circulation largely increased each
year hard times and cheaper jour
nals failing to arrest its onward inarch
and high appreciation of the public
for its true worth and merit
The Weekly Enquirer at beginning
of the campaign year was offered at
50 cents a year and its circulation
increased by the addition of over
200000 new subscribers the most
substantial and coveted testimonial a
publisher could desire
When asked for the secret of such
success Mr McLean frankly answers
The Enquirer has no opinions to force
pon its patrons it simply prints the
and tells the truth that the reader
i k J form his own opinions By
ining the price of the xpaper
J ews and greater variety can be

Trivial Jata f SreM
A certain up town Olevelsinder is the
happy possessor of misarital itau3t ia
a very pretty and accomplished lady
She is fond of niee clothag and always
looks well dressed and her husband is
just as proud of her as he should be
But from a technical point of view he
knows nothing whatever about her gar
ments nnd it bothers him greatly when
she assumes that he does She fires
broadsides of qusfcios aA hi when
ever she is dressing to accompany him
George how does my skirt haug
Is it too long in front Does my
belt cover the pins Do you think
this gown is beoomiug my collar
down at the back Are there any
wrinkles in this waist Is my hat on
straight These and a hundred other
interrogations are fired at hira at short
intervals If he doesnt pay close atten
tion she gets cross So he pretends to
listen carefully and answers glibly al
though always at random
The other day a neat wayof getting
even dawned upon him When he was
dressing that night for a party he sud
denly called his wife from the adjoining
room
Alma he said do you think
these new trousers inmg just a3 grace
fully as they should
Why George she said I dont
know anything about it Why do you
bother me
Hold on said George I was
wondering if this shirt bosom sits quite
right
Of course it doe3 snapped Alma
And these shoes do you really
think they are becoming to my com
plexion
1 What a silly question
And hold on Alma isnt the coat
a little long in the tails on one side I
mean and cant you pin it up
Why- George I never heard you
talk such nonsense You havent been
drinking have you
And just wait a minute Alma
He qnicjdy raised his silk hat from the
dresser and clapped it on the back of
his head Now dear please pay at
tention Is my hat on straight
Ttign she understood his wicked little
game
They walked together in silence until
they came within sight of their destina
tion and the deeply wounded Alma
managed to stammer
Well George you mean old thing
is my hat really and truly on straight
Whereat they both laughed Cleve

The Enterprising Schoolboy Who Slept In
the Coronation Chair
It is a Jong walk from the dining
room of the Westminster school to the
coronation chair which stands behind
the old stone screen just back of the
altar in the abbey but there is an in
teresting conection between the two
This chair as is well known is a rude
heavy oak chair much worn by time
It contains the Stone of Scone and
was made by the order of Edward I in
1297 and every English sovereign since
then has sat in it to be crowned
A stout railing in front of the chair
restrains the crowd of visitors from
coming near but if they were allowed
to examine it as closely as I was for
tunate enough to do they would find
cut boldly into the solid oak seat in
such sprawling letters as the school
boys knife makes upon his desk P
Abbott slept in this chair Jan 4 1801
P Abbott it seems was a Westminster
schoolboy and a tradition5 whioh there
is every reason to believe is true tells
that he made a wager with a sohool
mate that he dare stay in the abbey all
night alone
In order to win his wager he hid in
some corner of the old building until
the doors were locked for the night and
thus was left alone there Fearing
however that when morning came the
boy with whom he had made the bet
would disbelieve his statement that he
had won it he determined to have
some proof of the fact and so spent the
hours of the early morning in carving
on the coronation chair the sentence
which even now nearly a century aft
er bears witness for him It is disap
pointing that the tradition does not
record just what form and amount of
punishment was visited upon the lad
for his escapade and that history does
not tell us of his later years I wonder
whether the courage and grit which
this deed manifested foretold an ener
getic successful life or was dissipated
in mera bravado Max Bennett Thrash

Tlie Neivest Envelope
Opening an envelope by pulling a
string is the latest labor saving device
Like all simnle contrivances it seems
queer no one thought of it before but
that doesnt impair its usefulness
Any envelope can be equipped with
the opener An ordinary piece of thread
is inserted at the top of the flap and
when the fold is made the thread pro
jects from one end To open the en
velope all that is necessary to do is to
pull back the thread
This envelope opener is a New York
invention and ic promises to be very
popular with the busy business man
