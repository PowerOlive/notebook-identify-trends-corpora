every department unjtil it became the
largest and best in existence. Sev
eral years ago John the Second retir

ed to the leadership of John G. Rob
inson, a grandson of the founder,
and a man wTell known to
numerous residents in this vicinity.
This season the circus has four
long railroad trains, five hundred
horses, 1,427 employees, three hun
dred famous arenic artists, a remark

THE 1919 DOLLAR IN 1924
Here's a thought that may not
have occurred to you in selling Sav
ings Stamps: Dollars saved now will
be worth half again as much in five
years. This is the rather startling
statement of experts in economics
who are studying the present finan
cial condition of the country. What
is meant is that the buying power of
a dollar will be increased by so much
in that space of time.
At present, conditions are far from
normal, owing to the world-wide ef
fects of the war, but all authorities
agree that these abnormal conditions
will gradually .disappear and that
the dollars of 1924 will go much fur
ther, as a purchasing medium, than
the dollars spent to-day.
The value of all staples has always
soared immediately following a war,
but as business conditions readjust
themselves prices will gradually be
come more normal again.
Thus the purchaser of Savings
Stamps may reasonably expect a
much greater return than the inter
est allows, at the time of maturity.
