ily moved Thursday from rooms in
the Best Flat to their farm recently
purchased near Lebanon. Mr. Am
merman and family came to our com
munity a number of years ago from
Cynthiana, purchasing the farm of
the heirs of the late Mr. Zed Lay
son. They resided on this farm for
several years, Mr. Ammerman then
selling it to Mr. Knox, after which
the family moved to town. He then
formed a partnership with Mr. D. E.
Clarke, handling coal, salt, ship
stuff and farming implements. Mr.
Ammerman, feeling that there was
not business enough for his entire
time, began some months ago pros

long to the out-of-door life in Biioxi
nearly all the year round.
Biioxi is not wholly dependent
upon tourists. It has an all-the-year-round
population. A Tourist
Club is sustained during the winter
months from a colony largely of Mid
dle States, Northern people who cen
ter there yearly from mid-winter to
early spring. Never has the writer
seen more glorious sunsets or more
beautiful moonlights. What more
fascinating than the silvery sheen in
the wake of a white sailboat as she
silently glides along. Her hold may
be filled with oysters which she may
be carrying to be unloaded at some
oyster house a mile or so around the
bend of the, bay; or it may be that
with Shrimp from deeper waters
she is laden. If you happen to be
there next morning, where the boat
is being unloaded you will find it a
process worth seeing. Inside of a
long building all is activity men,
women and children are employed by
the hundreds in opening the oyster
shells. The oysters are first dropped
into tubs of water and the last pro
cess is when they are placed in cases
which are sealed and neatly labeled
and then are ready for the market.
There are homes for the workers
and their families who live near the
plants or oyster factories. There is
also a settlement house not far
away with beautiful trees about it,
with kindergarten, and playgrounds
for the children, who are thus cared
for while their mothers are at work
at the oyster houses. The season is
short and consequently the earnings
are for only a short time of the year.
Again and again from the cold
rigid winters- of the north we shall
seek the shore of beautiful Biioxi
and perhaps now and' then for a
respite in the summer, too.-
So when you made up your route
for trips South henceforth, we advise
you by all means to include Biioxi

shirts and one hundred and fifty pa
jamas. The box of hospital supplies
and the box of knitting were sent to
Cleveland this week. The first box

'CRISIS IS REACHED BY GER
MANY IN MAN POWER.
Cable reports reaching Washington
from Switzerland say Germany has
reached the crisis so far as her man
power is concerned. For three years,
according to these dispatches, Ger
many has lost on an average of 1,
200,000 men annually, and this num
ber will at least be equalled in 1913.
It is contended that to continue the
war, on the same scale for another
year the Germans must have at their
command a reseive of at least two
million men, whereas they actually
will have a reserve of only one and
one-half million, including youths of
the class of 1920.
