"Sapho" at The Columbia."
On Monday, Nov. 10, the patrons of
The Columbia will have an, opportu
nity to see one of the finest as well
as the most sensational pictures ever
shown in this city "Sapho," in fonrJ
reels taken from the novel of At
phonse Daudet and from Olga Nether
sole's famous play, which stirred art
theatre-goers a few years aeo to
frenzy. This picture is produced W
j one of the best of the French makers
or nims, ana the acting and the scen
ery are the finest ever shown in a
picture of this 'kind. Mile. Cecile
Guyan as the worldly "Sapho"' and
lover, are the leading characters in
lover, are the leading charasters in
this sensational picture, and witfc.
these two celebrated French players
in the leading role of this play the
public can be assured of seeing a pic
ture that they will not soon forget.
"Sapho," denounced at the time of
its writing in an age of prudery as
immoral, is now everywhere recog
nized as a great moral lesson. It is,
bold in its treatment of the facts of
life, but the boldness is for the best.
This picture, "Sapho," is to the pic
ture films -what the much-talked of
play, "Damaged Goods," is to the
stage. Every one who can see this
picture at The Columbia Mondaj
should not fail to do so, as it will be
a picture which will long be remem
bered. It will be shown for one day
only, both afternoon and evening,
and owing to the enombus cost of pro
duction, of this picture, the admis
sion for this day will be 20 cents.
Mr. Percy Reed will be heard in one
of his favorite songs at each per
formance. . (adv)
Columbia Theater.
"The Ironmaster," in two parts, a
picture )lay which deals with theCiv
il War, will be a feature at The Co
lumbia tomorrow.
The scenes in which the reception,
of the bulletins announcing the fall
of Fort Sumter in the litle Southern
town is shown are convincingly real-,
istic. ' So, also, are the cavalry skir
mishes and attacks upon the Iron
Works. The whole plot gives a fine
opportunity for vivid action of the
most absorbing kind and the story is
so clearly indicated, from scene to
scene, that explanation is unneces
sary. A comedy reel will be shown ea
titled "Faded Beauties." Mr. Reed
will sing "Anna Eliza' s Wedding .
Day." (adv) '
