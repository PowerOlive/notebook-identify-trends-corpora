Lick water vein in the public well. : Saturday with their brother, Mr
Jack Hill, at North Middletown.
The public well is one of the ancient
landmarks of Millersburg, and is al
most as old as Millersburg. For the
past hundred years it has furnished
water for all families who did not

The crops in this section are suf
fering very much for rain. Owing to
the severe drouth some farmers are
compelled to cut their tobacco to
and while it had gotten low at times
it was never known to go dry. Last
fall it was cleaned out, the walls put
in thorough repair and covered with
a concrete top, with a new pump.l
On Monday while someone was draw
ing water from the well a peculiar
odor was noticeable. On further and
more careful examination it was
learned, that the water contained all
of the properties, so Jar as can be
ascertained by chemical analysis of
Blue Lick water, such as was found
in the famous old Blue Lick Springs.
Dr. F. A. Hobert and Mr. O. W.
Ingels made a further examination
of the water Wednesday and it can
be seen sparkling in the well just as
the -old water used to bubble in the
springs. The surface water will be
pumped from the well in a few days
and a retainer of it will be sent to
Kentucky" State University for chem
ical analysis. Notwithstanding the
fact that the well is full of water7
the sulphur, salt and other proper
ties of Blue Lick water .are very
strong. There is no way of account
ing for this sudden appearance of the
water unless there has been a vein
very near the vein of the other water
with a thin wall. The vein will not
be tampered with and every effort
will be made to care for and protect
the water without endangering the
vein. "
Mr. Barton W. Kern, aged seventy-six,
a cousin of the late Hoi
John W Kern, of Indiana, Vice-Presidential
nominee and U. S. Senator,
who died recently, died at his home
in Owingsville, Sunday morning, af
ter a long illness of a complication of
diseases.
Mr. Kern was one of the pioneer
citizens of Bath county, and one of
the most highly-respectedTmen in that
section of the State. He was twice
married, his first wife being Miss
Stewart, and his second being Mrs.
Graves, of Nicholascounty. He was
a brother of Mrs. Ella May Herrin, of
Paris.
Mr. Kern is survived by one son
and one daughter, and one sister,
Mrs. Herrin, of Paris. The latter,
with her daughter, Miss Maude Her
rin, of Paris, attended the funeral,
which was held at Sharpsburg, Tuesday.

JOHNSTONE THOMAS.
The marriage' of Miss Carey
Johnstone, of Lexington, to Mr.
Hanson Thomas, of the same city, a
son of Mr. and Mrs. W. It. Thomas,
formerly of Paris, was celebrated
Wednesday at Wuequetonsjng, Mich.,
where the members of the families of
each have been for some time.
The ceremony was perforniecfln the
historic little church at Wueque
tonsing. The bride was - given in
marriage by her uncle, Mr. Benj.
Gratz, of St. Louis. Her attendants
were her cousins, Misses Marion and
Helen Gratz, of St. Louis. A recep
tion followed at the cottage of Mrs.
J. It. Morton, an aunt of the bride.
After -the ceremony Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas left for Pittsburg, where the
groom holds a position with the Oli
ver Company.
The wedding is of special interest
m Paris, from the fact that the
groom's parents were both natives of
and residents of this city for several
years, and he and his bride have been
frequent visitors here and partici
pants in social events.

CASSELL.
Mr. Thomas L. Cassell, aged seventy-three,
Confederate veteran and
retired business man, died at his
home in Lexington, Tuesday morn
ing, of hardening of the arteries.
Mr. Cassell had been ill for three
weeks and there had been little pros
pect of recovery, owing to his ad
vanced age.
Mr. Cassell had been prominently
identified for years with the business
life of Lexington. In early life he
became a member of Company A.,
Sixteenth Missouri Regt., C. S. A.,
an served throughout the war. At
the cose of the conflict he moved to
Lexington, and took a position as
head salesman with the clothing firm
of Louis &Gus Straus, which posi
tion he held for thirty-five years?
He came to Paris as head of a branch
house, which the Messrs. Straus es
tablished here, and built up. a good
trade'. Mr. Cassell retired from active
business several years ago. . i
Besides his widow, Mrs. Tillie i
Cassell, he is survived by one son,
Mr. Maxwell Cassell; one daughter,
Mrs. Annie Cassell Simrall, arid two
sisters, Miss Margaret CasselK and
J-Mrs. Geo. E. Spencer, all of Lexinsr-'
ton.
Funeral services were held at the
family residence at four o'clock Wed-;
nesday afternoon. The 'burial fol-j
lowed in the Lexington Cemetery. '
The committal services at the grave
were in charge of the Lexington
Masonic lodges.
Reorganization of the companies
and brigades of the armies of the
United States, as proposed' by thj3
War Department, will mean the in
crease of the company to 250 men
and six officers and the change of the
brigade to 10,800 men instead of ap-
prorimately 6,000.
Whether the Kentucky brigade will
have its strength increased to- the
full 10,800 by the addition of drafted
men from the State is not certain,
as no 'official communication in re
gard to organization has as yet been
received from Washington. If men
are taken from the' drafted army and
placed with the volunteers under offi
cers from their own State there is
little doubt that many of them would
be better satisfied with their lot.
