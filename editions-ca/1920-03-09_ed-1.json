GAME COMMISSION OFFICIAL
URGES LAW ENFORCEMENT
Mr. J. Quincy Ward, Executive
Agent of the State Game and Fish
Commission was in Paris, Saturday
and Sunday, as a guest or his broth
er, Mr. J. Miller Ward, and Mrs.
Ward, at their country home, near
Paris. ,
Mr. Ward is greatly interested in
the task of stocking the woods and
streams of Kentucky with fish and
game of all varieties, and is devoting
to this work a great deal of energy
and time in return for which he
g-ets very little in the way of liiate
rial reward. He delights in it for
the love of the sport. u-
Kentucky, in the opinion of Mr.
Ward, needs a strong organization
of sportsmen to back up the laws
which have been passed for the pro
tection of fish and game. He says
Kentucky is splendidly supplied
with streams and forests, and
should, under proper development,
furnish rare sport for the fisherman
and the hunter. Deer and wild
turkey, if given protection for a few
years, will multiply in this State,
a-nd all over the Common wealth
there are streams suited for the
propagation of the small-mouth
black bass, "inch for inch, the gam
est fish that swims." It is likely that
an eifort will be made this year to
organize a State Gaie and Fish As
sociation with branches in every
county, and Mr. Ward wants Bour
bon to have one of the very best.
HAS THESE THINGS HAPPENED
TO YOU?
Once upon a tinie a man' entered
a watcnmaKers snop, to -nave nis
watch repaired. "When may I have
my watch?" asked the man. "In
about six weeks," answered the
watchmaker. "Why the delay?"
the man inquired. "There is a great
scarcity of mainspring repairs," said
the watchmaker.
And the man fared forth, and,
slipped and fell upon the pavement,
which, owing to the scarcity of I
shovelers,was icy.
v The man tried to telephone to the
automobile service station, to get
his car, which had been promised to
him that afternoon, but the foreman
told, hifa that there was a shortage
of mechanics and that he could not
have his car for two weeks. It took
the man twenty minutes to get the
service fetation by telephone, owing
to the shortage of telephone opera
tors. ' "Well' said the man, "the sub

THE SCHO.OL TEACHER IS EN
TITLED TO A LIVING.
The lack of trained teachers has
been a matter of c4nmon lamenta
tion for year's. We have lamented,
but we have done little or nothing
to get trained teachers, and now we
are indulging in even deeper lamen
'tation over the lack of any teacher
at all.
There is no secret- to why teach
ers of the right sort 'are almost im
possible to get in the rural districts,
or why teachers of any kind are be
coming scarcer and scarcer. Every
one knows that it is because teach
ers are not paid a living wage.
East" Tennesse teachers held a
meeting recently and decided that no
college graduate ought to teach
for less than $100 a month for the
first year; no normal school gradu
ate for less than $80 a month; no
high school graduate for less than
$60 a month, and -that these salaries
ought steadily to be increased with
the increased experience of the
teachers. These figures are not a bit
too high. Considering what unskill
ed laborers of many kinds are get-
ling, and what it costs even to live
these days, tbey are low.
One thing is certain teachers
must be better paid, or there7 will
soon be no teachers to pay. We may
just as well make up our minds to
pay them more.

HUMORIST'S DESCRIPTION OF
OIL WELL LAUGHABLE. ,
George Fitch, the humorist, has
expressed his opinion of oil wells.
George's description of an oil well
reads like pome of his millionaire
dollar plays. Here is the humorist's
description of a well:
"An oil well is a hole in the
ground about a quarter of a mile
deep, into which a man may put a
Ismail fortune or out of which he
may take a big one. And he never
knows until the hole, is finished.
"Nothing is as noncommittal as an
oil well that isn't finished. A sphinx
is garrulous beside it. But when it
is finished it either goes on being
quieter than ever or it begins
spouting automobiles,' trips to Eu
rope and largely nobby mansions in
New York." " ( ,

A little comedy now and then is
relished by the wisest of men. A
little nonsense often tends to dispel
the glocn of the work-a-day world.
In this connection it may be re
marked tha,t the average "coon" i3

aiid often gets off sane funny say
iHg without anpearinc: to know or
feel that they are in the funny class.

THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT
Ken tuckians in Washington are
quoted in a daily paper of recent
date as "manifesting 'great surprise
when the Census Bureau's report
showed Lexington's population as
being only 41,534." What's worry
ing most people is to figure out
where the "surprise" part comes in.
That ungodly city has been claijriing
all along that the census would
shaw a population of 50,000. But
the Government's unbiased workers
: found things different there.
As one
prominent Lexington man once re
' marked, "The best thing- about Lex-
mgton is the fact that there's so
many different ways of getting out
of the place in a hurry!

ha. Beer has been the poor man's
beve rage for a thousand years. The
j Norsemen conquered new worlds on
beer and cheese. The Tartars brew
ed it '500 years B. C. The Britons
who settled this country were raised
on beer. And for 300 years beer
has been part of our American life.
And now because a few fanatics con
trol Congress, the use of beer is not
only forbidden, but is made-a felony.
No 'matter haw decent and law
abiding a citizen may be, ,if he is
found taking a drink of beer he is
herded with the thug, the degenerate
and the murderer. And he is taxed
heavily that 40,000 spies may spend
millions of dollars prying into his
affairs for fear that he might iake
a glass of beer. It seems a joke, but
the Holy Joes who own Congress
right now know that "the Great

RIGHT SORT OF AMBITION.
The height of the ambition o,f
some people in these United States
is to be the proud possessor of a
dangerous prosperity seldom if ever
adorned 'their persons with a "biled
shirt." Silk shirts even when they
were selling at normal pripes were
never economical. haberdashers
have always prominently displayed
the sign, "silk goods not guaran
teed." But now the quality is no
better and the prices are outrage
ously high. The man who wants
the dozen silk shirts -now would do
better were he to invest $82.49 in a
Treasury Savings Certificate and five
years hence draw down one hundred
dollars in gold. By that time he
would not spend very much of his
salary on so flimsy and perishable a
garment as a silk shirt.
