True, thereisn't much trouble in finding moonshine, but this is the liquid variety.

The outfitconsisted of a large keg used forfermentation, a tin lard can with ahole in the center for the still andabout ten feet of gas pipe, used fora "worm." In clone proximity totbis equipment a lot of meal andmash was found.Arthur and the Bedinger womanwere placed under arrest and taktn: to jail to await their examiningtrial.

Coming intothe office as a boy while his father,the late Ed Paton, was CountyClerk, Mr. Paton applied hitmself asdeputy in the conduct of the officeand literally grew up in it. He soonfamiliarized himself with all the essential details of management androutine work, and proved an indispensible assistant. As the son of hisfather, who was accounted one otbest County Clerks who ever filledthe office, "little Bally Paton" soonbecame known to the people as oneof the county's most efficient publicservants. Atter the death of hisfather Bourbon county elevated theson to the office of County Clerk,as a "token of their appreciation ofhis thoroughness, his ability and hisfitness for the place. Mr. Pdtonhas continued in that capacity ever.since, and in that time has broughtthe details ofvthe office to a remarkable degree of perfection. Not theslightest detail that tended to improvement and dispatch in the conduct of his official duties was overlooked by Mr. Paton, and the records and books have been so systematized that there is not theslightest trouble in getting information necessary to the public.These facts, matters of commonknowledge, do not need elaborating."Bally" Paton's record of manyyeai stands him in good stead inhis candidacy. Tbe County Clerk'soffice with Pearce Paton left outwould seem like tbe play of Hamletwith the melancholy Dane absent.Aside from Mr. Paton's efficiencyand fitness for the position he luibother and equally as strong qualitiesto lecommend hipn. As a Democrathe stands the test at one hundredper cent, pure and no traces ofalloy. He has been a prominentfigure in all the movements tendingtoward the advancement of the material interests of the city andcounty, and bore a prominent partin all pre-war activities, and during the progress of the war. As amember of the Bourbon CountyDraft Board he brought the work oCthat important body to a high stateof efficiency, and it becajme recognizod as the most thoroughly-equippedof any in the State. In this capacity Mr. Paton donated his services to the common cause anrfwould not accept a cent in remuneration. And nearly everyoneknows the work required in that position was of a most arduous andexacting nature.Mr. Paton comes to the people ofthe county with a clean record andclean hands, and asks for an endorsement of his candidacy. Thathe deserves well at the hands ofhis party and tf the wnoie' peoplegoes without saying. His friendsare legion, and his popularity withthem is such that it would be almost inconceivable of anyone elseoccupying the office of County Clerk.He does not regard himself as invincible, and does not affect theconceit that no one else could fill theoffice acceptably. But his friendsare of the opinion that ttie best interests of the county would be conserved by retaining him and to thatend their energies will be directedin the campaign to come.IF YOU ARE READY TO DYE,DON'T CALL THE DOCTOR ORUNDERTAKER.

Every manshould belong to a political, partythe party that most nearly representshis views and should take a livelyinterest in politics. I have neveraffiliated myself with any set orgroup of men for the purpose ofcontrolling the party, or for the purpose of influencing the results ofthe election of any group of candirdates. I am not now associated andwill not be associated with any groupor combination who have in view thecontrol of county offices contrary tothe will of the majority of the citizens of the county. I believe a partyshould stand for ideals and principles that mean something. I. believethere is a place in politics for honestysinceiitv. deeencv and Truth. T hp-lieve that character and integrity are Ijust as essential in political leadership as in successful business achievement, and I shall make my race forthis nomination strictly upon my ownmerits and shall gladly abide by thewill of the majority of the Demo-!cratic voters.I have served you as Superintendent a little more than three years tothe best of my ability. I have triedto be a channel through which GodGould operate. I have endeavoredto give the people of Bourbon aclean, honest, open straighforward,self-respecting and business-like administration. Every day I appreciatemore and more the tremendous responsibility that goes with this bigjob in a great forward-looking county like Bourbon. I am trying to discharge my duties faithfully andconscientiously. Trying to be justand fair. Trying to give every onem isouroon a square deal. Tryingto be a Superintendent of the wholepeople and to keep constantly inmina that that county is greatestwhich does most for its citizens andmakes them happy and prosperous.Although the salary of the office hasbeen very small I have spared neither time, energy, or my own money intrying to give each child a betteropportunity to secure an educationtnat ms him and gives him a showin the race of life. If I have madeany enemies in this effort I regretvery much that I have been so unfortunate; but I consider my firstduty to serve the school interests, ofBourbon County, and I have triedto do so withou't regard to how suchcourse would effect my future political weiiaie, andmy only regretis that 1 was not able to accomplishgreater results for the school children, of the county. In fact I havejust got to where results could begin. It is my belief that each officerof the county should be a true servant of the people, and if nominatedto this important office I pledge you.wiiib au mi umes i snail give my nestand most diligent efforts to serveyou well and faithfully, and shallgive my full time to the duties Whichsuch office would place upon me.I hope to see all the voters inBourbon County between this andthe primary and shall appreciate yoursupport.

It was reported that a number of Paris business men wrsounding the people of the city andcounty as to the advisibility of forming a stock company for the purposeof erecting a big plant in this city. "It was stated that among those wiowere deeply interested in the proposed, plant were John Merrinfctr,Jeff Denton, N. Ford Brent and anumber of others. A large numberof pledges had already been securedfor the purchase of stock, and thecampaign was beiag waged jmenilywith the prospect of ultimate suecew.Several sites are being considered for"the new venture, the most availableand most desirable one being locatedat a point near the Louisville & Nashville railroad, within a short distanceof the business center of the city.There has long been need of competition in the matter of ice for thecity of Paris. We all remember thevexatious delays and troubles thatensued with the local nlant in-fchpast two years, various reasons being assigned for the shortage in thesupply and the consequent almost,prohibitive rates caused thereby. Ascompetition is the life of trade, it ishoped that ice business in Paris, withthe acquisition and aid of the proposed new $iant, will be brought to apoint where the consumer may reapsome of the benefit.It was further learned yesterday,that the new company, which is totake the name of the Home IceCompany, will be capitalized aff$50,000. Mr. Denton will be thelargest stockholder, but will hare,associated with him practically allthe 'larger ice consumers in Paris',including the grocers, meat dealers,refreshment houses and restaurantproprietors. The greater part ofstock, it was said, has alreadybeen subscribed and efforts are being made to complete the list ofsubscripiions withm the next fewdays. Mr. Denton will probablytake active charge of the plant.The plan bas the active support"and co-operation of the Pari3 Commercial Club.' It was stated yesterday that if "theventure is a go, and there is no reasonwhy it should not be one of the mostcomplete ice manufacturing plantsin the State will be erected, withcompetent men in charge. There isplenty of local capital for the purpose, THE NEWS expresses theopinion that the new venture will becarried forward to a successful conclusion.
