Blue Grass Moguls Enter Suit.
State Senator Lewis W. Arnett, of
Covington, Wednesday in tbe Federal
Court in Covington, along with T. M.
Russell and T. VV. JSheets, representing
the Blue Grass League, attacked the
validity of the five mile clause of the
national base ball agreement through
injunction proceedings. Mr. Arnett
asserts that he is desirous of estab
lishingjateanxin Covington in connec
tion with the'Blue Grass League; that
Russell and Sheets made application
for the Covington team to the league;
that August Herrmann's consent was
asked and refused, and allege they
were threatened with the penalty of
being expelled from professional base
ball should the team of Arnett's be
placed Jn that cil.v. The chief conten
tion is the paragraph which reads
"that the party of the second fpart,
National Association, hereby guaran
tees that none of tne leagues in its
membership shall establish or main
tain a club in a city or circuit of
either major leagues or within five
miles of the limit thereof without the
consent in writing of the major league
club or clubs located therein."
Herrmann, Arnett asserts, is in er
ror in his contentions of the national
agreement, or. if correct, that said
' agreement is in violation of law and
equitv in that he claim?, the nhrase
. within five miles ot the limits re
ferred to ascertaining tc the city of
; Cincinnati emhraces both terriatory in
j Ohio and Kentucky, that if such con
struction is in error the National As
I sociation has the light to grant the
! plaintiff the territoiy asiced for in the
Blue Grass League.

Fiscal Court Meets.
The regular meeting of the Bourbon
Fiscal Court was held yesterday but
little business of importance was
transacted. The session was presided
over by Judge Dennis Dundon, with
the following magistrates present:
Squires L. J. Fretwell, E. P. Thoma
son, R. H. Burns, J. J. Redmon, B.
-F. Stipp, O. B. Lloyd, John N. Shrop
shire and George K. Redmon
The report of Road Supervisor C. F.
Redmon for the month of February,
was read and accepted and ordered
made of record. A sum of $1,540.82
was ordered paid for work on the turn
pikes and $1,500 was appropriated for
his use during the present month.
Supervisor Redmon was ordered to
advertise for biris for work on the
turnpikes of the county to be let pub
licly, ana an appropriation of 81,250
per mile for the construction of one
and one-half miles of road on the
Shropshire turnpike was made provid
ed the property owners along the turn
pike would furnish enough money to
complete same according tu specifica
tions. Accounts to the amount of S689.49
-were allowed and ordered paid, when
the court adjourned to meet April 3.
Baseball Meeting This Alter
noon. An effort to determine the sense of
the people in regard to base ball will
he made today and a meeting will be
held at the court house at 2:30 o'clock
and it is the sincere hop that a large
number of fans will be present to
voice their sentimentsgin regard to the
advisability of beginning the season.
Nevei in the history of base ball has
the Paris club been in such dire
straits, and unless something is done
to relieve the situation at the meeting
this afternoon, up will go the spunge.
Result: Sale of the franchise and no
more base ball for Paris.
The meeting this afternoon should
appeal to the pride of local fans to the
extent th,at there will not be a single
one to remain away from the meeting
this afternoon. There is a remedy for
the present conditions and it is planned
to hvae every phase d;scussed.
Paris should have base ball by all
means. Since the town has been rep
resented in the Blue Gcass League it
has never had a better advertisement.
Last year was a bad year not only to
Paris and other Blue Grass League
teams, but even the big leagues suffer
ed from a lack of attendance. Local
fans rallied to the Bupport of the team
last season when there was a need of
funds. Why not now with the pros
pects for a bright season.
Every person who has the interest of
the town at heart shou'd boost for the
great national game. We can have a
good team with the proper support and
there are too many good sports in this
city ro allow this great 3umme,r pas
time to slip through their fingers for
the want of a little interest. At any
'rate attend the meeting this afternoon.
If anyone has a view on the subject
he will be free to dicsuss it.
ATTEND AND BRING SOMEONE
WITH YOU.
