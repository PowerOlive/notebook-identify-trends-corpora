WOMAN'S TRUNKS.
Lexington has some nervy thieves

A few days ago Mrs. N.- A. Moore

her clothing, unifonms, kimpnas and
other valuable articles of apparel she
had packed for use at the .Hospital.
Upon calling for her trunk the theft
was discovered. The Lexington police
were notified and after a long searbh
arrested two negro women who were
parading the street attired in Mrs.
Moore's clothing.
Before the clothing had been re
covered and returned to Mrs.Moore",
she was compelled to return to Paris
and procure another outfit, not deem
ing it advisable to use the clothing

HREBTIGS HAVE A GRUDGE
AGAINST LEBUS?
For the third time this month
fierbugs seemingly with a grudge-
against Clarence LeBus, have ap-.
plied the torch, figuratively speaking,
to his property in Cynthiana. .On Oc
tober 1 a large warehouse and part
of another, was destroyed, by fire of
evident incendiary origin, entailing-'a
loss of about ? 3 4,0 00, Tvith about
$10,000 insurance. The first of the
week a large dwelling on his Edge
water farm burned the property loss
amounting to several thousand dol
lars, partly insured. Friday after
noon the sale and feed stable of Smith
& Turney, on Pike street, and the
three-story ironclad LeBus warehouse
in the rear of the stable were de
stroyed by fire. .The buildings were
in the heart of ithe city, and in a
closely-built district, which was
threatened with destruction.
The property loss in Friday's fire
was estimated by Mr. Lebus as be
ing close to $13,000, with no insur
ance. .Representatives from tne State
Fire Marshal's office and detectives
are investigating the fires, the orgin
of -which are still shrouded in mys
tery.
Thinking the big fire would get be
yond the control of the local firemen
the Cynthiana authorities, appealed
to Mayor E. B. January, of Paris, for
"help. The auto fire truck with a big
supply of hose, was sent instantly to
Cynthiana, in charge of Fire Chief
Lancaster and a detail of firemen.
They made the trip in thirty-seven
minutes. Upon arriving at the scene
they found the Cynthiana fire depart
ment had the fire under control, and
returned to Paris. During their short
stay in Cynthiana the firemen were
taken in charge by business men and
ladies and shown greatly-appreciated
courtesies.
