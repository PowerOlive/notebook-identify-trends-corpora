WAR SAVINGS.
Thrift Stamps and War Savings
Stamps are the most democratic of
investments and America expects
every American to show love of re
publican institution by investing
in this Democratic security. The
aggregate amount of the invest
ments and the number of investors
in these War Savings securities are
in a way the answer of the people
of this great Democracy to the call
of-the cause of democracy through
out the world and the vindication
of civilization and humanity.
They afford every person, how
ever humble and however small his
means, the opportunity to contrib
ute his part, to do his bit, in this
great struggle against the military
masters of Germany who seek to
dominate the world in contempt of
justice and right and freedom and
without conscience and without
mercy.
Surely every American desires to
have a part in the defeat of auto
cracy and the success of liberty !

INSURANCE FOR EVERY
FIGHTER.
The Treasury Department is mak
ing every effortto have every mem
ber of America's fighting forces
take advantage of the Government
insurance plan, which Secretary
McAdoo asserts tobe "the most just
and humane provision ever made by
any nation for its soldiers and sail
ors.' The purpose is rapidly being
achieved, the insurance having
passed the third billipn mark in the
total of policies written, and there
are many military units in which
every .member has taken insurance.
The automatic insurance provid
ed by the law is only partial and
limited protection, payable only to
wife, child, or widowed mother and
ceases after February 12, 1918. It
is important, therefore, not only to
the soldiers and sailors of the coun
try, but to their families "and de
pendents, that before that date they
avail themselves of the full Govern
ment -protection, which can go as
high as $10,000 and is payable to a
wife, husband, child, grandfather,
parent, brother or sister.
The law also provides for the re
education and, rehabilitation of the
totally disabled acrid monthly com
pensation -to' those disabled;-"
