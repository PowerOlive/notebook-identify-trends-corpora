Capt. V. .Mullikin and his bloodhounds came downfrom Lexington, and took the trail,The dogs followed a trail to the Louisville & Nashville railroad, wherethe scent was lost.Seemingly possessed of a desire toput the clothing firm of Mitchell &Blakemore out of business in Paris,burglars paid a visit to their storeWednesday night, effecting an entrance in the sajme manner as that ofa previous visit, by 'jimmying" theback door.The visitors made a thorough jobof the visit this time, taking a largequantity of clothing, valued at several hundred dollars, and, as before,showing good taste in the manner oftheir selections, which includedsuits of clothes, all kinds of furnishings, and, in addition, the sum of$200, which they took from thesafe. The job was evidently thework of experts, and from theamount of goods taken, it must haverequired a truck to carry the assortment away. The interior of the storelooked as if it had been visited by anearthquake. In their search for bargains, and for the best of everythingthe thieves threw piles of clotheson the floor, and tore up a number ofhats that did not seepn to appeal totheir taste. Owing to the fact thatit would require a complete inventory of the stock in the store it couldnot be determined exactly howmuch stock was missing.The police were immediately informed of the visitation, and Capt. V.G. Mullikin, of Lexington, with hisbloodhounds, came to Paris early yesterday morning to take up the trailwhile it was warm. The dogs tookreadily to their task, and after being placed on the trail in the backpart of the store, proceeded to therear yard, from there down Pleasantstreet, up the railroad yards into theLouisville & Nashville baggage room,where they "treed" at a big new suitcase standing" alone in one corner ofthe rocjm. When this was opened itwas found to be filled with an assortment-ofnew collars, neckware, socks,arid other articles of wearing apparelwhich were indetified as being a portion of the Mitchell & Blakemorestock. These were taken in chargeby the police. The hounds thenworked close to the vicinity of tim.carnival grounds, .and back ttf tSbaggage room, where they remainedas if the trail ended there.It was learned that two suspiciouslooking men had taken roojns at aboarding house Wednesday night inthe vicinity of the carnival grounds,and that they had with them severalheavily loaded suit cases. They lefton the early morning train, buyingtickets for Falmouth. Their descriptions were given to the police, whoimmediately got busy on the trail. Abundle of clothing and other articles taken from the store were foundscattered under a step at the boarding house where these men spent thenight, and these were also turnedover to .the police.It was reported last night that oneof the men was caught and the policewere hot on the trail of the others,AUTOISTS HAVE CLOSE CALLTwo deaths were narrowly avertedTuesday afternoon, near Paris, whenthe autqmobile in which James Milliken and Miss Margaret Foster, ofWinchester, were returning to theirhomes after a visit in this city.The machine was proceeding at apretty fair rate of speed, and whenat a point on a curve of the pike between Paris and Winchester the carswerved, striking a telephone pole.There was no windshield on the machine, which was a fortunate thingfor the occupants, as it sayed themfrom being disfigured by flying glass.Miss Foster received a bad cut in theside, which required several stitchesand sustained severe bruises, possibly internal injuries, while youngMilliken received minor bruises anda severe shaking up.The injured people were taken bypassers-by into Winchester, wherethey were taken to their respectivehomes and given medical attention.Miss Foster's injuries are reported asbeing serious. She is a daughter ofMr. and Mrs. K. N. Foster, of Winchester, and is well-known in Paris.FIRECHIEFS ELECT OFFICERSAT LOUISVILLE.W. A.

There was an enroll-of Mr. J. H. McGinnis, at the inter-section of the Lexington pike, andthe Hume and Bedford pike, nearParis, Monday night.In view of a series of daring raidson general stores in the county andin the city recently by what was apparently an organized gang, andheeding the advice of the police tomeet the intruders with a loaded shotgun, Mr. McGinnis kept handy astotgun loaded with buckshot for usein an emergency. This emergencypresented itself at a late hour Monday night. Awakened from his sleepby noises at the front of the store,Mr. McGinnis, whose residence is buta few feet away fropn the store, secured his shotgun, and quietly enteredthe rear of the store. He stole softlylip toward the front, and in the semi-darkness spied three men at work onthe front door. They had torn thescreen door from its hinges and hadthrown it in the pike. They forcedthe inner store door and one of themen was advancing- into the storewhen Mr. McGinnis fired. The loadtook effect, the man dropping to thefloor. The other two made their escape, running o'ut the Bethlehempike.Not knowing the man was dead,Mr. McGinnis telephoned to DeputySheriff Ollie Marshall stating he hadcaptured a burglar, and was standingguard over him pending the arrivalof the officers. "When the officials arrived a hasty examination disclosedthe fact that the man was dead.Coroner Rudolph Davis was notifiedand took charge of the case. A jurywas ijmpaneled and the inquest heldat the court house Tuesday. Fromthe testimony of Mr. McGinnis it wasunnecessary -for the jury to renderother than a formal verdict in accordance with the facts as detailedby him. Mr. McGinnis was acquitted. It developed that the dead man hadformerly been an. employe of theLouisville & Nashville railroad atthis point. In his pocket was founda printed prayer card, with the nameof Jas. L. Gorey, assistant Bishop ofthe Covington Diocese of the Catholicchurch, written across the face. Thebody being unclaimed, was interredin the colored cemetery at this place.The verdict rendered by the Coroner's jury in this case was, a mostunusual one, in that it commendedMr. McGinnis for his act, as follows:"We. the jury, find that CharlesMorrris cme to his death while burWrizing the store of J. H. McGinnis, and that his death was caused bya gunshot wound in the head andneck, inflicted by the said J. H. McGinnis, while Morris was breakinginto McGinnis store. This jurycompliments Mr. McGinnis upon thethorough and efficient manner inwhich he protected his home andproperty, and the service he has rendered the public."(Signed) H. M.

A. BU,special agent for a carnival composy-,playing here, and Lieut. Runser,pilot of the big Curtiss alrplame,which made flights here last Sundaymet again. "Bell went overseas with a detach--mentof Uncle Sam's aviation corps,,and saw many months of active service as an airman in the Aerial Observation Corps of the aipiy. In th-'course of his sojourn in France hbecame acquainted with Lieut. Ruaser, a native of Ft. Wayne, Ind., wfiowas an experienced air pilot. Thetwo Americans became fast friendand comrades, and were finally de-tailed to work together on specialduty in the air service. After thesigning of the armistice and thecessation of hostilities they returnedto America, and their homes being in.different parts of the country, theyseparated at New York, hardly expecting to see each other again.Last Sunday, Bell, hearing- of thepresence of the airplane in Paris,drove to the Hancock farm, in company with several friends, to witnessthe sfart of an afternoon flight. Intorducing himself to Sergt- Coons,the mechanician in charge of theplane, Bell told of his service in thearmy aviation corps and expressed adesire to make a flight in the machine. Sergt. Coons told him to puton the heavy aviation coat, helmetand goggles of the aviation outfit andwait the coming of-the pilot, whohad gone to Paris. Thus effectuallydisguised, and unaware of the identity of the pilot, who was similarly,attired, Bell climbed in beside himand accompanied him on a half-hourflight. When they landed again, andbegan removing their aviation,clothes, the astonishing discoverywas made that the pilot was Lieut.Runser, Bell's former comrade overseas. Then there was a reunion thatcaused the spectators to look in wonder. The reunited friends spent several hours going over their exptriences abroad and parted again in thehope of another jmeeting.THE LEXINGTON TROTSLexington Trots, Sept. 2 tcP.Octt11Let's go. . t v -' , '(septM)-;-... oFALL SEEDSBest quality Northern GrewnRosen Seed Rye.

Dr. Pierce, ofBuffalo, N. Y., long since found out whati3 naturally best for women's diseases.He learned it all through treating thousands of cases. The result of his studieswas a medicine called Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription. This medicine is madeof vegetable growths that nature surelyintended for backache, headache, weakening, bearing-down pains, irregularities,pelvic inflammations, and for the manydisorders common to women in all ages oflife.. Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription ismade of lady's slipper root, black cohoshroot, unicorn root, blue cohosh root andOregon grape root. Dr. Pierce knew,when he first made this standard medicine, that whiskey and morphine are injurious, and so he has always kept themout of his remedies. Women who takethis standard remedy know that in Dr.Pierce's Favorite 'Prescription they aregetting a safe woman's tonic so good thatdruggists everywhere sell it, in liquid ortablet form, 'Leather.hPsahr. -vs gazaaShoes NeatMMMfrPERSHING GIVEN HOUSING WEIr- OME AT UEW YORK.NEW YORK, Sept. 11. Americawelcomed General John J. Pershinghome this week.Honored by foreign rulers andGovernments, the Commander inChief of the mightiest army that everfought its way to victory under theStars and Stripes returned to hisown folk to meet a greater honorthan any foreign potentate or powercould confer the thanks of theworld's greatest democracy to theman who planned the decisive blowin democracy's supreme fight againsttyranny.The stern-faced soldier, who hadmaintained his iron self-control amidthe shambles of Meuse and the blooddrenched forest of Argonne, was notproof against the tribute of praiseand gratitude which was roaredfrom hundreds of thousands of thethroats and hearts of his fellowcitizens. His voice trembled with emotionas he responded to the greetings extended by Secretary of War NewtonD. Baker in his own behalf and thatof the President, .as well, as the welcoming addresses of representativesof the Senate and House, the stateand city.As his car passed slowly throughthe cheering multitudes, which jammed Broadway from the Battery toCity Hall Park, General Pershingattempted in vain to maintain hiscomposure. At first he replied tothe cheers with the stiff salute whichmilitary etiquette demands, but hesoon was carried away by the stormof applause which swept in greatgusts about himRising to his feet he waved his capabout his head with boyish gesturewhich told how deeply he was stirred,while the grim lines of his bronzedface broke into a smile which was asinfectious as it was rare.After the General walked downthe gangplank at Hoboken he received the first reward which a grateful country has offered to him. Inthe name of the nation Secretary ofWar Baker handed him his commission as full General in the Americanarmy, a rank held previously by onlythree men U. S. Grant, W. T. Sherman and "Phil" Sheridan.Commanded the military operations against the Moros in CentralMindanao, October, 1902, to June,1899, until June 1903.Standing behind him, completelyhidden by the imposing figure of theGeneral, was a little boy, trying tolook dignified and soldierly. He was"Sergeant" Warren Pershing, theCommander in Chief's only survivingchild. .When the General receivedhis commission he turned to his sonand handed him the document, withan injunction to keep it safe. The"Sergeant" kept it safely all right,but later on, in the great crowd atthe City Hall, he became separatedfrom his father, much to the dismayof the General.Pershing's Campaigns.Here is the fighting record of General John J. (Pershing:Served in the Apache Indian campaign, New Mexico and Arizona,1886.Took part in the Sioux campaign,Dakota, 1890-91.Commanded the Sioux Indianscouts until August, 1891.Served with the Tenth Cavalry inCuba, 1898.Was in the Philippines, November,1903.Accompanied Kuroki's "army inManchuria, March to September,1905Was "in charge of the victoriouscampaign against Moros which ended in rout of enemy at the Battle ofBagsag, June 10, 1913.Commanded United States punitive expedition which went into Mexico after Villa, March, 1916.Sailed to take command of A.
