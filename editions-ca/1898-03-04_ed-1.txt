unnecessarily to theflood of surmises conjecture andprophesy concerning the finding of thecourt of inquiry it is fair to say thatas a matter of fact most of the navalofficers here and at Key AArest inclineto the opinion that the court will findthat the disaster to the Maine wascaused by the explosion of a floatingsub marine mine under the port sideof the ship forward Opinions differas to whether this mine was made ofhigh explosives such as wet and drygun cotton or ordinary gun powderOpinions agree not only as to theexistence of mines in the harbor butalso that this one was laid purposelynear the buoy where foreign war vessels were directed to moor and wasfired from an electric battery on shoreIt is believed barely possible thatthe explosion of the mine was the result of the carelessness or ignoranceof Spanish officers in charge of themine station keys when testingthe circuit but the lattersupposition is not felt tobe probable It is furtherregarded as settled by the evidence before the court that the port side of thehull forward was completely blown tcpieces and that the only explosion onthe Maine except of isolated cases offixed ammunition was that of 2000pounds of salutin powder stored forward and of which no trace can befoundThese views are gathered from officers who talk with great reserve andonly upon the assurance that theiridentity will never be revealed Thefact remains that only the members ofthe court of inquiry know all the testimony elicited and no one is authorized to make public matters in advanceof the final judgmentKey AA7est Fla March 3 TheUnited

Woodworth in Chicago AdvanceA CLEW BY WIREOr An Interrupted CurrentBY HOWARD M YOST g5 Copyright 1896 by J B Lippincott CoCHAPTER VI ContinuedThe remainder of the forenoon wasspent in going- through the barns andover the farmA small structure twenty or thirtyfeetfrom the house had been used todo the cooking baking churningwashing and ironing in We could notgain access to the cooking house as ithad been called the door being lockedThere had been no care taken of thisplace and I could hardly see through thedust and dirt which obscured the windows when I attempted to look insideThere is nothing to be seen in thereanyhow I said But I rememberedthe pile of cakes and the loaves of breadwhich had issued from the old Dutchoven built in one side of the cookhouse How I wish for some of thegood things nowAfter a midday dinner I harnessedthe horse in the bugg According tomy instructions my agent had providedme with a single rig and I now proposed to use it to drive Sarah home andthen keep on down the road past Sidington Station across the river toTwineburgh in which place Mr Sonntag my lawyer residedI had never seen Mr Sonntag Myformer agent had died nearly a yearago and six months after his deathSonntag had bought the law businessfrom the heirsI had been advised of this fact by acircular detterJjointhepjesentiincuinUeJitgiyingeferencesfastoyaT3iltyKonesiy etc Mr Sonntag had also requested me to allow him to assumemanagement of my small estate AsMr Perry the president of the bankwas down among the names of reference I was most willing to grant MrSonntags request and wrote him tothat effectOn the way to Sarahs house I unbosomed myself to the good old soul1 told her of my hopes regarding Florence and my fears that those hopeswould never be realizedAch yes answered Sarah you villmarry her some day Just see howyouve been brought both to de sameplace togedder And I know she lof esyouYou are more certain than I am ofthat I answered somewhat gloomilyI have told yon everything about myself because I have no mother to confide in and you will no more violateiuy confidence than a mother wouldof that I am certainAch Nel I got no leetle vons ofmine own she answered with trembling voice There were tears in hereyes too when she said I vould do asmuch for you as a mudder I guess Ivould NelHer love was grateful to me orphaned as I had been for many yearsiind for the last year without a friendto console or advise meBud you vas foolish Nel to say younot see her undil you fint de robbersSarah went on foolishhart for her too I betof you andyou she haflots of heartacheWhat else could I do though inhonor I exclaimedVeil you are innocent and she lofesydu and knows too dat you didntrob de bank So den it vould be no dishonor to drust her lofe and be happin idSarahs logic found an echo in myheart Perhaps it was unjust tolove not to ask her to share myburden I knew if I could share anysorrow or trouble of hers how happyI would beWe soon reached Sarahs house and Ireined up to allow her to alight ThenI continued on my wayTwineburgh was about two milesacross the valley beyond Sidington Itwas a lively little place of about 2000inhabitants One of the great trunklines of railroad ran through the townThe road to Twineburgh crossed thetrack at Sidington station near thedepotAs I reined up my horse to a walkand down the trackand glanced npbefore crossing I saw the station agentstanding on the edge of the platformI nodded to the fellow and he answered with a grin Then as he slowly-came toward me I stopped the horseand waitedYou took the trunk didnt you heskedMr Hunsicker came for it I repliedI saw thfe trunk was gone when Icame back he said in his lumberingfaohion Did Jake tmke you over toNelovilleYea I am much obliged to you fordirecting me to him I said shortlyI thought mebbe he wouldHaving said this he shifted hisweight to the other foot I patientlywaitedNice country around Nelsonvillehe finally went on Some of the cityfolks beginning to find it out and gothere for the summer Mr Morleycbeen there six months now Know MrMorleyI am slightly acquainted with himI repliedThen theres another feller comes upfrom the city Lets hisname now Hes got a little hut a mileor so from here and comes up to huntand fish Guess he dont shoot verymuch It never see him take any gameback to town with him Oh yes now Iremember His names JacksonI started in surprise and became alittle more interestedWhat Not Horace Jackson IaskedYes thats his name Acquaintedwith himI used to know Mr Jackson quitewellSeems to be a nice fellow the agentremarked reflectivelyA very pleasant gentleman Oh bythe way I went on is there a telegraph instrument at the depotTo be sureAnd I could send a message whenever I want toYes that is whenever Im hereWell but supposing I had an important message to send when you arenot here I asked Where could Ifind you1 live up the track about a mile herepliedThis directionYes The house is right by thetrack just where the switch beginsAnd whats your nameAsk for HunterIt appeared to me that the fellow didnot relish my questioning He seemedto be ill at ease under itxyuca u kjiysuii jju uu iur iuorxey shouse when he comes up here I askedI guess he does sometimes He aintbeen up lately not for five or six weeksAt least I havent seen himDoes Mr Morley stay at Nelsonvilleall the time I asked Or does he goto town every dayHe goes to the city three days in theweek sometimes moren that ne takesthe morning train here at Sidingtonand comes up to Twineburgh on theafternoon trainI bowed my head and drove onThe fellows words gave me food forthought Horace Jackson a frequentvisitor at the Morleys or at least until recently why I knew he had somebusiness relations with Mr MorleyJackson himself had told me so Butthen why did he not transact his business at Mr Morleys office in theXo doubt he did and therefore visitedNelsonville for another reason Florence Morlev was- the attraction Remembering thaVeiatjssarineftby2without a greeting iny heart grewheavywith doubtCHAPTER VIIThe probability that I had a rival inthe field and one who had a free roadwhile I was handicapped by the suspicion of a crime filled me with desperationHad I only followed my first impulse and not allowed a whole year tointervene without making an attemptto clear myself If you want anythingof consequence done do it yourselfwas a maxim I had always believed inand as far as possible followed outBut in this one most important instance where the circumstances affected my whole life and promised to annulall possibility of future happiness Ihad held aloof with a supineness forwhich I could not now condemn mvselfstrongly enoughI knew the bank officials had usedevery effort to recover their propertyI knew the shrewdest detectives hadbeen put on the case Notwithstanding-this nothing had been discoveredHow could I then hope to succeedWhere could I begin There was notthe least sign of a clew to work onI soon drove into Twineburgh andhad no trouble in locating Mr Sonntags officeAn undersized old fellow with bristling gray hair was seated at a deskhis back toward the door He tookno notice of me and after standingfor a few minutes gazing at the backof his head I made known my presenceI wish to speak to Mr Sonntag IsaidTake a chair be at leisure in amoment came the answer in quickjerky tones He did not even turn hishead but went on with his workI sat down and looked around Itwas a tjpical small town lawyers office I was in There were a few lawbooks in a small rickety bookcase onone side of the room a few roughwooden chairs warranted to cause abackache only to look at them a fewold maps and calendars most of thelatter of former years hanging on thewalls a wooden spittoon filled withsawdust on the floor a rusty stovefrom which the discolorations of thefires of the last winter had not beenremoved standing in one corner andlastly the desk before which was seated my agent and lawyerI thought the old fellow judgingfrom his back was in complete harmony with his surroundings but Isoon found I had misjudged the manFor when he finally arose turned toward mc and favored me with a searching glance from a pair of the keeneststeel blue eyes I had ever seen it wasery evident Mr Sonntag was not asrusty as his surroundingsThere was something familiar to meabout him Had I met him beforeI could not rememToerArising I was about to make myselfknown but before I could utter a wordhe stepped briskly up to me and witha smile extended his handI am glad to see you he beganTHE BOURBON NEWS FRIDT MARCH 4 1898Of course you are my client Mr Nelson ConvayYes that is my name I answeredsomewhat surprised But as 3rou haveprobably never seen me before although your face does seem familiarI should like to ask how you knewNothing remarkable about it at allYou wrote me from Paris 3ou remember stating the probable time of yourarrival home And although I havebeen here only six months I have gotto know by sight at least every oneabout this place Therefore I knewyou were a stranger that Mr Conwaywas about due and well there youhave it Have you just arrivedI came yesterday noonIndeed And where are you stoppingOver at tW old house of courseWhere else should I have goneOh I supposed you would have putup at the hotel here in Twineburghuntil we could get things in a lifcttebetter shape for you at the homesteadHow did you find thingsConsidering that the house has beenvacant so many jrears I was very agreeably surprised to note the good stateof repair it is in I repliedI have tried to follow out the plansof my predecessor as far as possibleYou think you will enjoy yourself inNelson ville he asked flashing an inquiring glance at meOh yes I hope to have absoluterest and peace at any rate I repliedsomewhat hesitatingly for my sojournat the old house had certainly not begun restf ully I had slept but little thenight beforeNothing about the arrangements Ihave made for your comfort to preventit is there he askedNo You have done well I want toask you before I forget it why did youhave the cellar off of the old storeroom walled upA look of perplexity came over hisface and as he did not seem to comprehend my question I went on moreexplicitlyThere were two doorways one leading to the storeroom and the otherleading to the outside Both these doorways have been built up with solidmasonry to correspond with the foundation walls I simply ask out of curiosity what your reasons were for havingit done not that I have any objectionMy question was a simple enoughone Mr Sonntag seemed to think itnecessary to ponder over it howeverLet me see The cellar you havereference to is directly under the roomyou proposed in your letter of instruction to me to occupy he finally saidYes and there used to be two doorstoAnd they have been built up hebroke inYes Do you not know about it Iasked in surpriseNo he replied shortlyThen you did not have it doneCertainly not I had nothing to dowith it Know jnothinFfoWabout it he4rf IxSSTVvfFlorence Morleyanswered decidedly If they arebuilt up it has been done within sixweeks For when I received your letterannouncing your intention to occupythe house for a time I went all throughthe place and those doorways were notbuilt up then I even went into thatcellar It was a damp musty hole andI intended to call your attention to itand ask what you wished done about itWell thats strange Who couldhave done it I exclaimed thoroughlyperplexed How did you get into thestoreroom I had to kick open the doorOh I had a key to the outside doorand got in that way Hm It is as yousay very strange indeed But resumeyour seat Mr ConwayAgain the thought occurred to methat I had- met Mr Sonntag or at leastseen him somewhere beforeDid I ever meet you I asked voicing my thoughtHe glanced quickly at me and thensmiled as he said Look like some oneyou know do I One often meets people who put them in mind of some oneelse Now regarding this cellar affairIs there anyone you know who is interested in your property he askedin a brisk business like mannerNo one I replied I am the lastof my race a lonely man and onewho is sick at heart I was about toaddMr Sonntags face became seriousand I thought there was a touch of pityon itCheer up Mr Conway The tableswill turn some day and you will forget the time of trouble and despondency the old lawyer said cheerily andhopefully perhaps sooner than youhave any idea of Now then he continued returning to his brisk businesslike manner some one has walled upthose doorways Who was it and forwhat purpose If it was done with theidea of n hiding place what was thething to be hidden Something whfcliwas neverr again to be reproduced evidently or the room would not havebeen wholly sealed Perhaps there wasa secret entrance provided But thenwhy should your property have beenselected Were you alone when thediscovery was madeNo sir A woman who used to actas nurse girl when I was a young onewas with me and also Mrs Snyder thewidow who takes care of the houseYes I know I believe the oldwidow can be relied upon to say nothing about the circumstances if she istold not to How about the other yourold nurseShe would do anything possible forme I was her idol when a child andnow devotion for me seems to havebeen augmented in proportion to mystature Sarah is wholly trustworthyand if I requested her not to mentionthe matter she would have her tonguecut out rather than breathe a wordof itThats good The discovery had bestbe kept secret the old lawyer said reflectivelyThere is another thing I wish to mention though perhaps it is hardly worthdwelling upon Mrs Snyder thinksthere is something strange about thehouse And she has so succeeded inimpressing my old nurse with the ideathat Sarah is quite concerned about mystaying -She seems to be imbued withan inexplicable fear that somethingharmful threatens meIndeed What do you mean whenyou say there is something strangeYou mean mysterious the old lawyerasked in the manner he would haveused in cross examining a witnessYes Mrs Snyder claims to haveseen mysterious lights at night andheard strange noisesMr Sonntags eyes lost their shrewdexpression for a few moments he relapsed into deep thoughtTO BE CONTINUEDTHE RETIRED BURGLARHis Professional Instincts SubmergedIn Patriotic EmotionPoking along the side of the houseone night looking for the

Teutonic raceof northern Europe one which evenmore than divorce is directly the concomitant of modern intellectual andeconomic progress We refer to suicide Morsel li devotes a chapter of hisinteresting treatise upon this subjectto proving that the purer the German race that is to say tne strongerthe Germanism e g Teutonism of acountry the more it reveals in itspsychical character an extraordinarypropensity to self destruction On theother hand the Slavic peoples seem tohim to be relatively immune Theseconclusions he draws from detailedcomparison of the distribution of suicide in the various countries of westernEurope and it must be confessed thathe has collected data for a very plausible case There can be no doubt thatin German the phenomenon culminates in frequency for all

famous Signor Salviatoria as single handed andalone he prepared the paraphernalia forhis tight rope performance which hadbrought him his glory would have everimagined that there was time or spacein his busy life for a romance Thesignor was a peripatetic perambulatorof the rope and his field of performance lay in country towns where it washis wont to stretch his narrow pathwayacross a street from roof to roof ofhouses whose owners were willing toextend that privilege to him in exchange for tickets to the Great andOnly Megatherian Concert which followed the outdoor exhibition Yet hehad a romance and there were in itthose elements which one greater thanSignor Salviatoria might easily havecrjstallized into a melodrama thatwould have stirred the applause of athousand galleriesThe greatest act I ever done hesaid with a natural and easy disregardof accent and syntax I done in anOhio town about ten years ago I wasdoing my turn there for a week and itwas the county fair season and I wasfollowing their trail like a sleuth forthey brought people to town and helpedmy business never none too good Thethird night of my performance whichwas a half hour exhibition in midairbefore the concert had begun I hadgone up on the roof to git things readyand while I was pottering around snuggin up the rope and seeing that therewasnt any loose cogs to be droppingI heard a screech up through the scuttlehele leading to the roof and the nextsecond out popped a woman like oneof these here jumping jacks -It giveme a hard pull on my nerves but Iflew over to see what the matter wasIt was my landlady and here I wantto say that when I stop for any timein a town I go to a boarding housewhere I can get a rate that wontbreak me Got to do it in this lineCant give it all to railroads and hotelsIn this case I not only stopped atthis boarding house but the landladylet me stretch my rope from her roofto the roof of the house across theand as it was the main street ofthe town it was convenient all the wayround for me The only drawback wasthat the lady had a husbandthat never had done anything for herwhen he had his senses and now shehad to support him and take his abuseof her every time he got a jealous fitwhich was every time she had a newboarder that was anything for looksand styleSignor Salviatoria stopped a momentat this remark stroked his little chinwhisker and smiled retrospectivelyShe had only been polite fo me because I had been polite to her as anygent should be when there is a prettywoman around and the landlady wasthe prettiest little woman about asbig as a piece of soap I had metAs I was saying when I got to hershe had slung the cover to the scuttlehole over it and was sitting on it withher jaw set and trying to stick hertoes into the roof to help hold it downIn a mighty few words she told meher husband was on the chase afterher with a hatchet to kill her and hewould be up fram below in a minuteShe wasnt as bad scared as I was forI didnt have much experience in thatkind of business and didnt know whatto do I didnt have anything to defendmyself or her with either and themore I thought of the situation themore I began to think how many thingsthere were that was more dangerousthan walking a tight rope 50 feet abovethe earth and me as innocent as ababe The little woman told me tobring a barrel half full of sand therewas over in one corner of the roof andwed set it over the cover of the scuttleto hold it down I done it as fast asI could and when we had the barrelthere and about fixed the crazy husband came slashing up with his hatchetAs luck would have it the sand fellin on him and knocked him off the ladder below and the barrel got stuckin the hole so the little woman and mhad a minute or two to think and shedone the thinkingAre you afraid says she44 Some snys I nodding toward thescuttle holeI mean of me says she smilingNot much says IAre you strong says she44 4Thats part of my act says I Butnot against a crazy man with a hatchetsays I wondering what she would donext and about how long it would betill the crazy was on deck with histomahawk gleaming in the airThen says she grab hold of meright quick and cany me across thercpe over to Mrs Pecks house sosmyhusband wont get at me with fha axShe had more nerve in a minute thanI had in a week but when she said thatmy professional pride come to me andwithout any more talk I reached for mybalancing pole and stooping down soshe could get on my back which shedidnt like very much I made a quickrun for the end of the rope just as thecrazy husband came out of the scuttlethrough the barrel and tumbled downon the roof half smothered with sandI told her to hold tight and do the prayin for both of us and I thought I couldget her through safe I dont knowhow I ever got on that rope with her onmy back for that wasnt the way myprofession done business but I gotthere and as I shot out with the womanclinging to me the people an the streetbelow set up such a yell as I never heardbefore and I come near losing my balance for I knew as they didnt whythis feature that wasnt on the bills wasbeing showedThe crowd yelled about twice andthen all of a sudden got so still I couldhear the little womans heart beatAnyway I thought I could but maybei t wa s my own I knew wh e a th ey do nethat the crowd had seen the man on theroof with the hatchet and recognizedhim for all the people in the town knewthe kind of a fellow he was At thesame time the crowd got still somethingcame to me telling me to nerve myselffor the crazy man would cut the ropeand drop me and my load in the streetto be crushed into a shapeless mass andI came near letting go and dropping before I was dropped I couldnt see whatwas going on behind me and all thelittle woman knew she was whispering iome to go ahead because we were safe ifI only kept my path I didnt knowwhether she thought about the manwith the hatchet or not Likely shedid It wasnt her tomention it thoughunder them circumstancesvvliile I was thinking about hinLcutting the rope I was getting along ittoward the safe end as fast as I couldthe little woman hanging on till shenearly choked me but it didnt hurtand I was standing it beautiful Itsf unny how a man will find pleasure inlife when theres so much in sight thataint and I nearly forgot the man withthe hatchet thinking about the littlewomans arms holding onto my neckaathe one hope of her life But it wasonly for a second then I felt a jar onthe rope and I choked and braced myself for I was sure that the crazy manwas beginnig to cut and I knew thatthree or four licks would be enough Iwaited for the second jar but it didntcome and in its place come a springtothe rope as if a weight had beerf takenoff of it followed by a swishing soundand a dull thud on the sidewalk 50 feetbelow us At the same time the crowdsent up a groan as if every person inlitwas hurt I didnt know for sure whathad happened but I guessed that thaicrazy man like most any crazy personor a mad dog only had room in his mindfor one thing atja timeand whenlatwas there there wasnt space for anymore He wanted to kill his wife andthe only way he knew how to do it waswith the hatchet by cuttinjr her topieces It did not strike him that hecould kill her by cutting the rope andletting her drop to the ground Thatwas too much for him He knew aneasier way and as she was out thereon the rope not 40 feet from him hewould go out there and kill her Crazypeople have such a crazy way of doingthings dont they He did and whenhe took his second step out on the ropehe went over and down to his deathThats what had made the rope springback I guess the little woman musthave felt thatsomething awf ul had happened though she never said a wordbecause when I at last stepped safe onto the roof and the crowd yelled a hundred times louder than they did beforethe j knew what they were yellingabout the little woman let go her holdaround my neck and dropped at my feetin a dead faint and I didnt blame hereither it was time for somebody tofaint and if she hadnt a done it I wouldsure pop Her doing it gave me something else to think about and I gother downstairs as quick as I couldwhere the women took charge of herand soon brought her out all rightI guess thats all there is to itsmiled the signor picking up his balancing pole and pointing to a date lineand some initials on it This is the onethat steadied us over and the littlewoman had them pat on there when shebecame the blushing bride of SignorSalviatoria and the signor bowed witha sweep that would have entranced

Philadelphia has even seenwas Maelzel The exhibition which hegave in the hall on Fifth street belowWalnut which bore his own name andis now the site of the Tatham buildinghas probably not since been equaledIn the early part of the century thisGerman inventor was regarded as amarvel in the art of mechanical entertainment and was an associate of Beethovens His speaking dolls his songbirds and his rope dancers were considered fine specimens of ingeniouscontrivance but they were lookedupon as insignificant when comparedwith his automaton trumpeter hischess player and his Burning of Moscow It was Maelzel who introducedBlitz to the Philadelphia public in ahall where Greens hotel is now situated and while the 3oung magicianwas making his first tour of the country His nimble witted clevernessmade a strong impression on the multitude who had not yet become accustomed to European masricians of thefirst rank Some of the most eminentAmericans of the time were delightedwith his feats as a necromancer andamong the ignorant he was spoken ofas a spiritualist or an astrologer ofmore than mortal powers Indeed itwas not infrequent that he was calledupon to work miracles in curing thesick One of his most amusing experiences in frightening people although hu usually employed his skillto that purpose only in a jocose waywas when he was assailed on thesuburban streets by rowdies He wasa master of ventriloquism and his sefpossessioh did not desert him Hethrew his voice into a far off hurriedconversation of two men and emittedalternately the bark of dogs so thatthe scamps imagined that he Avas aboutto be rescued and betook themselves toflightIndeed the amusing things whichthe signor did a thousand times withhis ventriloquial resources are the bestremembered anecdotes of his

in Northfield Massdesires our opinion on the questionWere the winters of 50 or 75 years agomuch colder or were the snowfallsfleeper than at present The opinionIs widely held that the winters werecolder and the snowfalls deeper but Ican find nothing to warrant the beliefexcept that in the first part of the century a much larger percentage of thepopulation lived in the hill towns in theInterior which are much colder thanthe valley or the coast townsOn the general question as to appreciable changes in climate the editorsopinion is that there has been no suchchange in any respect whatever so faras meteorology proper is concernedIf we divide our records of the weatherrecorded in North America since theflays of Columbus into two periodsviz before and after the year 1800 weshall find that every peculiarity suchas remarkable storms winds rainsfloods frosts etc recorded in the current century can be matched by a corresponding remarkable event beforethe year 1800 The popular impressionsalluded to by our correspondent resultalmost entirely from the imperfectionsof our records and especially of ourmemories There is a large class of persons whose habits of thought are socrude that when they experience anyvery remarkable weather they jump tothe conclusion that the climate haschanged forgetting that they themselves have had such a limited personal experience that they are not fairjudges of the weather over the wholecountry or of the climate of a centuryOur correspondent seems to suggestthat a certain change in the habits- ofthe people such as the removal fromthe interior to the coast or from foreststo prairies or from country to city orvice versa will account for widespread errors in respect to the climateThe suggestion is excellent but theeditor would be inclined to interpretthe phenomenon somewhat differentlyThe general movement of the population in the past century has been fromthe Atlantic states westward and fromthe country to the city or quite opposite to the movements suggested by ourcorrespondent In fact we find no realagreement in the so called popular traditions with regard to the weather Wehave met with quite as many personswho think the winters are more severeas with those who think the winters areless severe than formerly Everything seems to depend upon how andwhere the oldest inhabitant livedwhen he was a boy as compared withhis present condition The average climate of Xew England so far as theweather is concerned has not appreciably changed since the days when heroldest forest trees were young saplings Monthly Weather ReviewA MOTHER BIRDS LOVEHOWa Pigreon Cut Her Way to Hct- - ii- In the animal kingdom there aremany strong examples of mother loveand the birds are particularly noted foidisplaying it A remarkable instanceof this maternal instinct was recentlynoticed near Elwood Ind A motheipigeon whose young one had mysteriously disappeared searched unceasingly for weeks for the little one and oneday last December she was seen flyingviolently against the side of a framebuilding in the cityEach time she came in contact withthe house she chipped off a small bitof wood with her bill Eor nearly twedays the old bird kept this practiceup often during that time falling exhausted from the repeated shocks andthe fatigue In the afternoon of thesecond day she had pecked a hole in thewall the wood of which was old andsoft from the weather This hole waslarge enough to admit a mans headand through this the mother bird wentand cameEvery time she entered she carriedgrain or seeds or grass Some curiouspeople investigated the hole while shewas absent and there they found thelittle lost pigeon just below the holewedged in between the weatherboardsFor two days more the bird continuedto bring the little one food and wouldfluttering near the hole chirruping and trying to cheer the little prisoner up Many times it entered andseemed to be trying to extricate itsyoung one but it could not succeed indoing so try as it would The prisonerhad flown into the building which wasempty and managed to get betweenthe weather boarding near the top oithe inside Falling a considerable distance it lodged in the narrow spacewhich did not permit it to use its wingsin rising again Its plaints had reachedthe mother and she not being able toreach it from the inside had cutthrough from without An admiringman thrust his hand through the holeand brought out the fluttering youngthing to the great delight of the anxious mamma bird Chicago ChroniclePawning Bicycles in FranceOne curious feature- of

milking- in the way the averagefarmer docs for a number of years in anopen lot with a straw stack for shelterand concluding that if a cow housewould not be a paying investment itwould at least add very much to thecomfort of both cows and milker webuilt one this fall It is not an elaborateor costly affair and is within the reachof almost any farmer who keeps a fewcows If there is anything more exasperating than milking- a restless cowin a muddy lot I have failed to find itIt not only tries the patience but injures the health and at least part of thecows feed is wastedBut I started to tell you about thecow house It is 40 feet long and 11feet wide with shingle roof The stallsare a little less than four feet wide andthere is room for nine cows and a placeto store feed Milking which has always been a burden is now a pastimeeach cow knows her place and theleather does not interfere with milking time We have broken three heiferswithout any clubs or profanity Twoor three weeks before calving theywere put in the cow house taught tostand tied and fed regularly with theright land of feed and gave no troubleeither with calving or milkingThe total cost labor included wasless than 50 The interest on that sumat ten per cent would only be five dollars and it does seem that the saving- infeed comfort and health ought to beworth that The dairy business doesnot seem to be very encouraging atpresent but it gives a regular incomeand there is generally a demand for agood article of butter and with a lot ofthrifty pigs to utilize the waste products there ought to be some profit init J M Terrell in Journal of AgricultureRIPENING OF CHEESEThe CJhanges Which Usually OccurDuring the ProcessA well cured cheese contains a higherpercentage of fat than the same cheesedoes when green and this gave rise tothe idea that the action of rennet or ofthe fermentation process caused certain of the constituents of the cheeseto be converted into fat Partly withthe object of testing this theory DrCaldwell has undertaken an investigation of the changes which occur in thecuring of cheese The course pursuedwas to take several green cheeses freshfrom the hoop analyze the same andthen keep them in air tight receiversto cure By daily examination of theair in the receivers everything- that wasgiven off from the cheese or absorbedby it was traced and notedWithout going into minute detailsit will be enough to say in brief thatthe examination of the air in thrj receivers showed that the cheeses allv alike rapidly gave off carbonic acid andwater and as rapidly absorbed oxygen-in tthe early stages of curing but after--wardthis steadily diminished Theweighing showed a steady loss in thetotal dry substance of the cheese fromoxidation and a loss in the total of eachsolid constituent fat and casein andthat the casein lost more than the fatthus leaving- the fat in the cured cheesein larger proportion than in its greenstage and demonstrating- that the increased percentage of fat in the ripecheese over that in its unripe conditionwas not due to any increase of fat in thecuring process but to a greater loss ofcasein than of fat by oxidation C GFreer Thonger in

from 200 to 1000 bushels andthese numbers are not quite the extremes either for occasionally a cropof 1200 bushels is heard of and it is byno means uncommon to see crops of lessthan 200 bushels but a man who canaverage 500 to GOO may consider himselfa successful onion grower while 400 to500 is a very fair crop The width of therows the quality and quantity varyingfrom four to six pounds per acre
