G. Taylor for violations of the speed laws.In court Saturday morning Levyand Brophy were assessed $7.50 each,while the case against Taylor wascontinued until next week, owing tothe absence of important witnesses.It is to the credit of Acting Chiefof Police George M. Hill that during the brief tenure of his office thespeeders learned that an effort wouldbe made to curb their activities, andit was through his activity that theappointment of two special trafficcops was made possible. Knowing itwas impossible for the limited policeforce to properly patrol all parts, ofthe city, it wasi determined to havethe two extra men appointed, andthe wisdom of the move "has beenvery apparent.THE.NEWS was told the other dayby an attorney that the city had thepower of imposing a special tax onautomobile owners for the purpose ofemploying and paying special officersfor the purpose of compelling an observance of the automobile traffic ordinances, and that it would be a goodthing to have two more such appointed, to back up and supplementthe work of the men who have justtaken office. This matter will probably be brought to the attention ofthe City Council at its next regularmeeting. The people of Paris wouldlike to see the gilt-edged speedera,as well as those of "the lower classes"brought to a summary punishmentfor their wilful violation of the automobile traffic laws. The officialsshould play no favorites in this matter, and should work together forthe suppression of speeding and lawviolations, no matter who it hurts,male or female, of high or low degree. Let the good work go on.BOLD BURGLARS BUSYBurglars entered the home ofMr. and Mrs. George K. Jones) onthe Clintonville pike, near Paris,Sunday night, during the absence ofthe family, and ransacked the placefrom end to end. A small amountof money was taken, together witha gun, watch, razor and others smallarticles, and a purse belonging toHarry Jones. The burglars overlooked a large roll of bills secreted in another part of the house. It isthough the burgary was committedby a band of juvenile thieves whohave been working in Paris lately,several stores having been enteredhere and robbed. The authoritieswere notified.'80FULLTIME HEALTH OFFICERFOR BOURBONAt a special meeting of the Bourbon Fiscal Court, the physicians ofthe city, members of the present andthe new City Council and City Attorney Denis'Dundon, held last weekat the court house, Dr. A.

Alexander, one, of thelargest landowners and tobaccogrowers in WOodford county, has reclared for the contract of the BurleyTobacco Marketing Association.

This would apply very well to that baby show toldof in a Falmouth paper some timeago where one of the judges, a mereman, made a woeful mistake.A Paris woman wrapped a bundlein a copy of THE BOURBON NEWS,and sent it to a relative, who is amissionary in China. Eleven weekslater she received a letter from therelative asking if there was anychance of getting a pair of No. 6shoes that had been advertised in aspecial sale conducted by one of thelocal stores.
