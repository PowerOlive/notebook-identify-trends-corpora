raising business and demandedthe restoration of protectionThey did not endorse the Dingleybill now before e ways and meanscommittee of the house Judge WmLawrence president of the associationmoved to amend by inserting an endorsement of the Dingley bill Itwas developed in the discussion thatfollowed that the committee thoughtthe bill too radical and wouldnot report the resolutions with theendorsement in them The amendment offered by Judge Lawrence wasfinally adopted on a weak vote Inthe course of his remarks Judge Lawrence said if the incoming administration did not do something- for the farmer Ohio would go for free silver fouryears henceThe preamble declares that the severest blow ever dealt the agriculturalinterest oi tne united states was inflicted by the tariff of 1894 and themost disastrous of all was the placingof wool on the free list this action depreciating the American flocks onethird reducing- the price of wool50 per centloss to thethree years ofand seventv

KnowledgeLondon Jan la The ChroniclesWashington correspondent telegraphsthat Russia has been most keenlyanxious to obtain knowledge regarding the treaty of arbitration justsigned by the representatives of theUnited States and Great Britain Hesays during the negotiations the Russian minister to the United Statesasked Secretary of State Olney whetherIt was a treaty of offense and defenseand whether it committed the twesoun tries to an allianceMr Olney according to the correspondent replied in the ordinary diplomatic acceptance of the term it wasnot such a treaty but was an alliancewith Great Britain in support of theMonroe doctrine Great Britain by theterms of the Venezuelan treaty having acknowledged the validity of theMonroe doctrine which hitherto shehad affected to regard as merely theipse dixit of the United States not having the force of international lawThe Chronicle vouches for the correctness of the foregoing and claimsto be in a position to declare that theAmerican executive holds that withGreat Britains support the danger oiEuropean interference in the westernhemisphere vanishes and the UnitedStates becomes supreme This thepaper says was one of the chief reasons that caused the United States toendeavor to secure the treaty TheAmerican government now does notfear that any power will question JbheMonroe doctrineIt adds that Russia more than onceoffered assistance to the United Stateswhen the relations with Great Britainthreatened to become ruptured Thesecretaries of state recognized thatthe offers were not prompted so muchby friendship for the United States asby enmity for England If Russia hadany influence in Washington it wouldbe directed to preventing ratificationof the treaty by the senateA BLACK FIENDConfesses to Criminally

chanceOh no youre not but you do needsome one to take care of youShe suddenly held him at armslength from herYou dont imagine for a momentGeorge Wentworth that I came here today for for thisCertainly

until herlaughing lips touched hisAlthoughCHAPTER XXthe steamship that tookKenjon to America was one of thespeediest in the Atlantic service 3 etthe voyage was inexpressively drearyto him He spent most of his timex walking up and dowTn the deck thinking about the other voyage of a fewmonths before The one consolationof his present trip was its quicknessWhen he arrived at his hotel in NewYork he asked if there was any message there for him and the clerk handed him an enveloxje which he tore openIt was a cable dispatch from Wentworth with the words Longworthat Windsor Proceed to Ottawa immediately Get option renewed Longworth duping usJohn knitted his brows and wondered where Windsor was The clerkseeing his perplexity asked if he couldbe of any assistanceI have received this cablegram butdont quite understand it Where isWindsorOh that means the Windsor hotelJust up the streetKenyon registered and told the clerkto assign him a room and send his baggage up to it when it came Then hewalked out from the hotel and soughtthe WindsorHe found the colossal hostelry andwas just inquiring- of the clerk whethera Mr Longworth was staying therewhen that gentleman appeared at thedesk and took some letters and his keyKenyon tapped him on the shoulderYoung Longworth turned roundwith more alacrity than he usually displayed and gave a long- whistle of surprise when he saw whom it wasIn the name of all the gods hecried what are you doing hereThen before Kenyon could reply hesaid Come up to my roomThey went to the elevator rose afew stories and passed down an apparently endless hall carpeted withsome noiseless stuff that gave no echoof the footfall Longworth put his keyinto the door and opened it Theyentered a large and pleasant roomWell he said this is a surpriseWhat is the reason of your being hereAnything wrong in LondonNothing- wTong so far as I am aware-- We received no cablegrams from youand thought there might be some hitchrXinthe9buMiess therefore I cameA feAh I see I cabled over to your address and said I was staying at theWindsor for a few days I sent a cablegram almost as long as a letter but itdidnt appear to do any goodNo I did not receive itAnd what did yon expect was wrongover hereThat I did not know I knew youhad time to get to Ottawa and see themine in twelve days from London Nothearing from you in that time andknowing the option was running outboth Wentworth and I became anxiousand so I came overExactly Well Im afraid youvehad your trip for nothingWhat do you mean Is not themine all I said it wtfsOh the mine is all right all Imeant was there was really no necessity of your comingBut you know the option ends in avery short timeWell the option like the mine is allright I thing you might quite safelyhave left it in my handsIt must be admitted that John Kenyon began to feel he had acted with unreasonable rashness in taking his longtripIs Mr Melville here with youMr Melville has returned home Hehad not time to stay longer All hewanted to do wTas to satisfy himselfabout the mine He wTas satisfied andhe has gone home If you were in London now you would be able to see himDid you meet Mr Von BrentYes he took us to the mineAnd did you say anything about theoption to himWell we had some conversationabout it There will be no troubleabout the option What Von Brentwants is to sell his mine that is allThere was a few moments silencethen Longworth said When are yougoing backI dont know I think I ought tosee Von Brent I am not at all easyabout leaving matters as they are Ithink I ought to get a renewal of theoption It is not wise to risk thingsas we are doing Von Brent might atI wS ft ffiiiJSSAnd m be Lady Wentworth yetany time get an offer for his mine justas we are forming our company andof course if the option had not been renewed he would sell to the first manwho put down the money As you sayall he wants is to sell the mineLongworth was busy opening his letters and apparently paying very littleattention to what Kenyon said Atlast however he spokeIf I were you if you care to take myadvice I would go straight back toEngland You will do no good hereI merely say this to save you any further trouble time and expenseDont you think it would be as wellto get a renewal of the optionOh certainly but as I told youbefore it was not at all necessary foryou to come over I may say furthermore that Von Brent will not again renew the option without a handsomesum down to be forfeited if the company is not formed Have you themoney to pay himNo I have notVery well then there will not bethe slightest use in your seeing VonBrentYoung Mr Longworth arched hiseyebrows and gazed at John throughhis eyeglass I will let you have mythird of the money if that will do anygoodHow much money does Von BrentwantHow should I know To tell youthe truth Mr Kenyon and truth neverhurts or oughtnt to I dont at all likethis visit of yours to America Youand Mr Wentworth have been goodenough to be suspicious about me fromthe very first You have not taken anypains to conceal it either of you Yourappearance m America at this particular juncture is nothing more nor lessthan an insult to me I intend to receive it as suchI have no intention of insulting yousaid Kenyon if you are dealing fairlywith meThere it is again That remark isan insult I wish to have nothing moreto say to you I give you my advice thatit is better for you and cheaper to goback to London You need not act onit unless you like I have nothing further to say to you and so this interviewmay as well be considered closedAnd how about the mineI imagine the mine will Take care ofitselfDo you think this is courteous treatment of a business partnerMy dear sir I do not take my lessonsin courtesy from you Whether you arepleased or displeased with my treatment of you is a matter of supreme indifference to me I am tired of livingin an atmosphere of suspicion and Ihave done with it thats all You thinksome game is being played on youboth you and Wentworth think thatand yet you havent the cuteness asthey call it here or the sharpness tofind it out Now a man who has suspicions he cannot prdve should keepthose suspicions to himself until he canThat is my advice toypuX wish youIjEroodday SLl -T HE HOTJKBON NEWS PEIDA Y JANUABY 15 1897John Kenyon walked back to his hotelmore suspicious than ever He wrote aletter to Wentworth detailing the conversation telling him Melville hadsailed for home and advising him tosee that gentleman He stayed in NewYork that night and took the morningtrain to Montreal In due time he arrived at Ottawa and called on Von BrentHe found that gentleman in his chambers looking as if he had never left theroom since the option was signed VonBrent at first did not recognize his visitor but after gazing a moment at himhe sprang from his chair and held outhis handI really did not know you he saidyou have changed a great deal sinceI saw you last You look haggard andnot at all well What is the matter withyouI do not think anything is the matter I am in very good health thank3ou I have had a few busines worriesthat is allAh yes said Von Brent Iamvery sorry indeed you failed to formyour campanyFailed echoed KenyonYes you havent succeeded haveyouWell I dont know about that we -arein a fair wray to succeed You metLongworth and Melville who came outto see the mine I saw Longworth inNew York and he told me you had takenthem out thereAre they interested with you in themineCertainly they are helping me toform the companyVonJBrent seemed amazed I did notunderstand that at all In fact I understood the exact opposite I thoughtyou had attempted to form a companyand failed They showed me an attackin one of the financial papers upon youand said that killed your chances offorming a company in London Theywere here apparently on their ownbusinessArid what was their businessTo buy the mineHave they bought itPractically yes Of course whileyour option holds good I cannot sell itbut that as you know expires in a veryfew daysKenyon finding his worst suspicionrealized seemed speechless with amazement and in his agony mopped fromhis brow the drops collected thereYou appear to be astonished at thissaid Von BrentI am very much astonishedWell you cannot blame me I haveacted perfectly square in the matterI had no idea Longworth and the gentlemanwTho was with him had any connection with you whatever Their attention had been drawrn to the mirietheysaid bv that article Thev had investigated it and appeared to be satisfied there was something in it in themine I mean not in the article Theysaid they had attended a meeting whichyou hd called but it was quite evidentyou were not going to be able to formthe company So they came here andmade me a cash offer for the mineThey have deposited 20000 at the bankhere and on the day your option closesthey will give me a check for theamountServes me right said Kenyon 1have been cheated and duped I hadgrave suspicions of it all along but Idid not act upon them I have been tootimorous and cowardly This manLongworth has made a pretense of heljing me to form a company Everythinghe has done has been to delay me Hecame out here apparently in the interestof the company I was forming and nowhe has got the option for himselfYes he has said Von Brent Imay say I am very sorry indeed for theturn affairs have taken Of course asI have told you I had no idea how theland laj You see you bad placed nodeposit with me and I had to look aftermy own interests However the optionis open for a few days more and I willnot turn the mine over to them till thelast minute of the time has expiredIsnt there any chance of your gettingthe money before thenXot the slightestWell you see in that case I cannothelp myself I am bound by a legaldocument to turn the mine over to themon receipt of the 20000 the momentyour option is ended Everything isdone legally and I am perfectly helpless in the matterYes I see that said John Goodby He went to the telegraph officeand sent a cablegramWentworth received the dispatch inLondon the next morning It readWe are cheated Longworth has theoption on the mine in his own nameCHAPTER XXIWhen G eorge Wentworth received thismessage he read it several times overbefore its full meaning dawned uponhim Then he paced up and down hisroom and gave way to his feelings Hisbest friends who had been privilegedto hear Georges vocabulary when hewas rather angry admitted that theyoung man had a fluency of expressionwhich was very much more terse thanproper When the real significance ofthe dispatch became apparent to himGeorge outdid himself in this particularline Then he realized that howeverconsolatory such language is to a veryangry man it does little good in anypractical way He paced silently up anddown the room wondering wThat hecould do and the more he wonderedthe less light he saw through the fogHe put on his hat and went into theother roomHenry he said to his partner doyou know anybodj who would lend me20000Henry laughed The idea of anybody lending that sum of money except on the very best security was in itself extremely comicDo you want it to day he saidYes I want it to dayWell I dont know any better planthan to go out into the street and askevery man if he has that sum about himYou are certain to meet men wlio havevery much more than W000 and perhaps one of them struck by your verysane appearance at the moment mighthand over the sum to you I thinkGeorge that you would bemore successful if you met the capitalist in a secluded lane sohie dark nightand had a good reliable club in yourhandYou are right said George Ofcourse there is just as much possibility of my reaching the moon as gettingthat sum of money on short noticeYes or on long notice either Iimagine I know plenty of r en whohave the money but I wouldnt undertake to ask them for it and I dont believe you would Still there is nothinglike trying He who tries may succeedbut no one can succeed who doesnttry Why not go to old LongworthHe could let you have the money in amoment if he wanted to do so Heknows you Whats your securitywhat are you going to do with it thatI eternal mine of yoursYes that eternal mine I want itto be mine That is why I need the20000Well George I dont see much hopefor you You never spoke to old Longworth about it did you Ee wasntone of the men you intended to get intothis companyNo he was not I wish he had beerHe would have treated us better thajbis rascally nephew has doneAh that immaculate young man hasbeen playing you tricks has heHe has played me one trick whichis enoughWell why dont you go and see theold man and lay the case before himHe treats that nephew as if he werehis son Now a man will do a greatdeal for his son and perhaps old Longworth might do something for hisnephewYes but I should have to explain tohim that his nephew is a scoundrelVery well that is just the kind of explanation to bring the 20000 If hisnephew really is a scoundrel and youcan prove it you could not want a better lever than that on the old mansmoney bagsBy Jove said Wentworth I believe I shall try it I want to let himknow anyhow wrhat sort of a man hisnephew is Ill go and sec himI would said the other turning tohis work And so George Wentworthputting the cablegram in his pocketwent to see old Mr Longworth in aframe of mind in which no man shouldsee his fellow manHe did not wait to be announced butwalked to the astonishment of theclerk straight through into Mr Longwrorths room He found the old manseated at his deskto be continuedBATTLE OF MARATHONTremendous Consequences Hinged Uponthe ictory of the GreeksThere has been one day in the historyof the world fraught with tremendousconsequences to the whole of mankind There have been days whenone or more countries have hadreason -to believe that the crisishad been reached in their historyand their welfare hinged on the success of their encounter with the enemya victory that one day might win or losefor them These were as naught compared with the tremendous weight thathung in the balance when the Greeksmet the Persians at MarathonIn the handful of tiny states that inhabited Greece a new life had arisenThe Greek intellect had developed faculties which indicated that man had advanced another stage toward the highest ideals Foremost among these littie nations was Athens destined toreach the highest intellectual gloryAthens too contained the germs ofhuman freedom it was the forerunnerof the democracies of the world Butthe very existence of Athens and Greecowas threatened by the huge barbaricempire of Persia Darius had sent outhis hordes of warriors to add the Grecian states to his vast dominions Faceto face his numerous forces met theAthenians on the plain of MarathonHitherto invincible in the field the Persians looked upon the little army opposedto them with contempt The Greeksthemselves hesitated to hazard a battlewith the conquerors of the world Theirgenerals debated the question and thedecision to fight the Persians wascaused by the eloquence of the immortalMiltiades He led his 10000 Greeksagainst the Persian hosts and gained adecisive victory The glorious day ofMarathon beat back the advancing tideof eastern despotism and barbarismand saved the freedom and civilizationof the western world Cincinnati ErquirerHow Gillot DrewThe story

so small and so out of the way thatyou would never find it except by ac-cident Indeed it stands apart in somefields absolutely concealed in alow and is oniy approached on oneside by a footpath which in the winteris usually under water on another bya cart track of the rudest and roughestdescription When you do arrive thereihe first object to strike you is thechurchThere is something pleasing something grateful to the eye in this grayplain disproportioned little structureIt seems to fit into its surroundingsadmirably the farmyard the cottagesthe brook flowing just below theycall it the river there where everything is on so reduced a scale the everpresent geese and sheep and cattleand the perfect seclusion of surround-ving pastures Nothing but green which-ever way you look No houses exceptthe quaint little cluster round thechurch no distant view everythingshut in by the slopes which skirt thevalley a complete environment of-everlasting fieldsI have seen many churchyards Thisone lying begirt on all sides by thef arm homestead tiny indifferently keptshaded by many cypresses and weepingssb where scarcely once a year per--hapsis the slumbering soil disturbed-for a new grave and where everything-speaks of dreamy restfulness thischurchyard of R is the spot in whichI myself would soonest choose to lieOne I knew who nawr reposes therea former rector the kindest heartiestienderest most beloved of pastorsThose who have since died in Uhave all wished to be laid near himAnd now around him sleeps a littlpcluster of his horny handed friends Afamily The whole churchyardas peaceful But in that especial cornerthe peacefulness seems always mostprofoundIt was this rectors nephew and successorfor E has been a familyang anjr time this two centuries pastto whom I am indebted for the following story He often strolled out withme when I went to paint and whilesmoking innumerable pipes told meirnany interesting local yarns This onehowever the facts of which had lately come under his own experience quiteovertopped all the others in strikingness and peculiarity Here it is substantially in my informants wordsYou see that cottage over there3he said pointing to a dismantled hovel3n the corner of the field where I hadpitched my canvas1 noddedA most remarkable history is at-Cached to it he went on Not aUegend but a fact Of this I can assure you because I myself had a handiin finding it out It centers round a ceriain couple who lived there the mostextraordinary old folk that I ever cameacross I should like you to have seenthem I think you would have admittedthem to be the ugliest pair in England as they certainly wTere the mostfelose and unfriendly During the 16years that they lived in that cottagethey never once asked a neighbor insideUmph Hermits indeed I observedAbsolute hermits There was howraver some slight excuse for their eschewing All outside company Each suffered from a severe physical infirmityThe woman was neairly stone deaf therruan was dumb When they first cannehere 18 years ago now I think mywho as jrou know wras then recrtor tried to find out what he couldabout them He only learned a littleslluI that little was nothing out of theway It transpired that the man wasan ex sailor of the royal navy who hadlost his speech after a severe attack ofyellow fever in the West Indies Hewas now entitled to a pension whichhe drew half yearly and which myuncle only knew about by the fact thatthe old fellow had to come to himodically to get his papers signed Thewoman was his sister so she gave theneighbors to understand and so alsomight have been inferred from a certain-family likeness which was noticeablebetween them She was a most ill-favoredhag shrivelled unkempt anddirty beyond description Althoughshe then must have been nearer 70 than-HO her long touzled hair was still asblack as a coal and hung in hideousuntidiness about her hawk like facewhich with its dark eyes andits hookedvj ro tfosds was most uncommonly forbid--tZiULifiJLiis- f jl I-l- Iding The poor people all pronouncedher a witch and for that reason gavehe a wide berth Probably the womanpurposely encouraged the idea tforher great aim and object was evidentlyto be left aloneAlthough her brothers pensionamounting to about Is lid a day wasample to keep two old folks decentlyand even comfortably in thakcheapestof neighborhoods these two alwaysgave tlhe impression of being halfstarved and I do not believe that eitherof them purchased a new article ofclothing the whole time they lived inR From this people began to inferthat they were misers and as time wenton things happened to strengthenthe inference All along they had discovered the greatest anxiety and apprehension when anyone tried to gainaccess to their hovel Indeed my unclehas often told me that the expression ofthe old peoples faces when he calledthere and one or other of them peeredround the chained vdpor at him wasreally quite comical in its suspicioustrepidation and the older they grewthe more pronounced did their precautions to prevent outsiders entering becomeAt first they had sometimes venturedto lock up their house and make an excursion together into FTHE BOtmBbNifiwstfibAY JANUA Y 15 1897Henamed the adjoining market townwhich I will not further particularizeBut by and by they gave up such recklessness entirely and whenever one ofthem went out the other always remained on guard at homer The precaution was quite necessary All the poorin the neighborhood were by this timefully convinced that there was something unked about them and no onein R or for miles round wouldhave willingly crossed their thresholdeven if the door had been left openBut these old misers were altogethertoo suspicious to reason andto live in an ever increasingseemedfear ofhaving their privacy invadedMy uncle as he himself told meshortly before his death was greatlyexercised about his two strange parishioners Many rectors would haveconsidered themselves absolved of allobligations toward people who notmerely never attended church but refused even to admit their clergymaninto their house when he called Butthat was not my uncles way EverjTpoor man who lived in his parish heheld to be under his pastoral protectionand he felt himself bound to look afterhis interests In regard to these twoold misers however it was difficult toknow what was the kindest course Tolet them live on in their present halfstarved condition and in that fearfullyinsanitary hovel undisturbed seemedno real kindness And yet he was loathto set the parish or the sanitary officerupon their track He held very strongly to the opinion that an Englishmanshouse even if it be nothing better thana pig sty is his castle and in his heartby no means approved of the wide compulsory power then lately given to thelocal authoritiesBesides after all what could suchauthorities do Compel them to evacuate their miserable shanty no doubtBut the old people would then simptychange their local habitation not theirmode of life And as regards starvingthemselves not all the boards of guardians in Somerset could make people eatwho did not choose to do so It was possible indeed that they might bemedically found of unsound mind andin that case they could be removed tothe workhouse infirmary or the countyasylum But even supposing that feasible it was a course from which my uncle shrank And the outcome of it allwas that he let things remain in statuquoWhen I succeeded him hen I wentto call now and then on the Id people meeting however with the sametreatment that my uncle had alwaysexperienced Sometimes they wouldnot open the door at all at others theydid so with the chain up and conversedwith me through a narrow aperture Inreply to my inquiries whether I could doanything or give them any assistanceI always had a negative returned untilat last I gave up trying to make headway in so hopeless a direction and leftthe two hermits pretty much to themselvesThe man came to me regularly everyhalf year to get his pension paperssigned and I took advantage of theseopportunities to give him some friendlyadvice and to remonstrate with himon his folly in starving himself andwearing such inadequate clothing inthe coldest weather At first I had madehim a present of some old coats trousersand flannel shirts But I soon gave upthat for he never wore them and Iformed the impression that he had probably converted them into cash Infact I asked him one day what he haddone with them all He only looked cunning affected stupidity and made someunintelligible signs Despite his dumbness he could make me understandthings very well when he liked especially anything connected with bispension papers It was only when hedid not wish to make himself understood that his signs had no meaning inthemIn this matter of coming to have hishis papers signed he wasaslhavesaidalways absolutely punctual On March25 and September 29 he axpeared atthe rectory as regularly as clockworktaking me on the way to E where-he had to present his papers at thepost oifice I always looked for himon the morning of those days and always took the jrecaution to have mystudy windows wide open The oldman ana water had long been mutualstrangers and the atmosphere whichattended him was to say the leastrather oppressive When he was goneI added to my disinfectant precautions with a strong pipe and I can assure you that the foulest pipe in my rackhad to be called into requisition Asort of homoeopathy you see However this is by the wayHe was always aa I have saidpunctual in coming And when oneMichaelmas day it was just two yearsago now came and went without hisputting in an appearance I at onceremarked it as a very noticeable circumstance The next day I expectedbim with opened windows and thenext and the next but he did not turnup At length after waiting a weekI felt sure that he must be ill and wentover to the shantyto inquireI hammered at the door Nobodyanswered I hammered louder andlouder with the same result In theend as a last resort I tried it To mysurprise it was unfastened I pushedit open and went inI cannot tell you what my feelingswere as I entered that miserable styA more dismal forlorn and withalfilthy hovel has surely never been inhabited by human beings There wasscarcely any furniture The wralls wereblack and covered with cobwebs andsimply alive with creeping insects andthe floor well I wont attempt to describe it I -think you could cut the atmosphere with a knife so thick andfoul it was and fetid oh insufferablyfetid It nearly poisoned me and myfirst impulse was to beat a hasty retreat into the open But a 1owt moanfrom the corner attracted me I lookedand there I saw a sight at once loathsome and pitiableCrouching against the wall upon thedamp and moldy floor was a figure covered with an old sack I went nearerAt first I could not see which of thetwo itwras But on looking more closelyI made it out to be the old woman Shewas almost naked except for the covering of the sack and one of her yellow arms which lay exposed lookedunspeakably lean and shriveled andweird I also noted another point Thetangled black hair which had ahvaysstruck me so about her was now- betrayed as not being her own It was awig half on and half off at that moment giving her a fearfully grotesqueappearance and clearly revealing herbald pate scantily fringed with a fewwkisps of gray hair beneathWhat is the matter Are you illI asked bending down and speakingin a loud clear voice for I knew herto be almost stone deafShe stared at me with dazed suspicious eyes and said nothing onlymoaningaagainAre you ill I repeatedAnother moanWhere is your brother I shoutedHas he left you aloneShe looked hard at me I could seein her restless black eyes that this timeshe had caught the purport of my questionBrother Tom she mutteredYes I roared Where is heShe looked at me very cunninglyHer eyes seemed to waive up and sparklewith an almost unnatural brightnessDont you know she gaspedI shook my headWell you shall hear she went onIm just going the same way myselfand its no use keeping secrets anylonger Hes deadDead I exclaimed supposing thather wits were w andering for I hadseen him at his hovel door less than afortnight since When did he dieShe gave a low chuckleFifteen year agoNow of course I saw that she wasraving Her hawk like eyes fixed onmy face in a most forbidding leer atonce read my thoughtsNo I aint mad Its the truth Hedied 15 year ago and I buried him myself under yonder hearthstone Getthem to dig it up and youll find hisbonesAs she spoke the hag clutched mysleeve and half raised herself by a supreme effort Her face wore a fiendishly exultant grin Her whole expressionwas grotesque and repulsive Sheleered jinto my face with a look that Ican never forgetYes yes she said All true alltrue I hid it and no one knew Andwith a hideous chuckle Ive drord hispension myself for 15 yearAnd were her brothers bones foundthere I asked the rector in the courseof a subsequent conversation on thesubjectYes He had been buried scarcelya couple of feet below the surface Andin a hole in the chimney we found themisers savings more than 500 ingold and notes It was paid over to thegovernment in return forhe 15 yearspension out of wihich they had beencheatedIt was a wonder that no one foundout the womans dual personalityIt was indeed But no one dreaimedof suspecting And the woman musthave worked it very cunningly The difference in her look with and withoutthe black wig was quite remarkableThen her brothers dumbness was afeature in her favor no chance of being found out by the voice Of courseto anyone who haa the smallest suspicion the whole thing would soon haverevealed itself as plain as a pikestaffBut

First Place bythe Humble GooseThe turkey is the American nationalbird in respect of Christmas He arulesthe roost here at Yuletide by virtue oiancient custom and no less in token oihis own succulent

say the favorite fowl is a roastpig dressed with boiled buckwheat andgarnished with his own liver heart amliother important organsFrenchmen love their poulet onChristmas as on other days of thuyear It is served by preference withthe famous Languedoc stew which isa mess of beef bacon ganrlic cognacwine etc Their neighbors the Bel jgians yearn at Christmas time for turkey with truffles but will compromiseon a goose stuffed with chestnuts sothat the famous Walloon wafers bethrown inGive a German a smoked goose andplenty of cabbage and he will makehis Christmas dinner The Dutchmanis fond of goose also but likes it afterthe Belgian fashion roast and stuffedwith chestnutsThe Hungarian national goulasehmakes room onfor a roasted goosethe Christmas tableThe same estimablefowl satisfies the

of place American AgriculturistTrotting Horse Breeders Have Been TooCareless About ItThe general and universal depressionin the trotting iiorse business duringthe last three 3 ears has bred a greatdeal of inexcusable carelessness on thepart of breeders and owners of stallionsbearing on the subject of establishingand verifying pedigrees says theWestern Horseman As is well knownunder the ruling of the Register association an animal cannot be registeredwithout a certificate from the owner ofthe sire or his accredited agent andalso a certificate from the owner of thodam at the time she was bred Durinirrecent years all owners have been moreor less recreant about registering andmany standard but unregistered animals have changed hands and manywho bred standard mares to standardsires have neglected to have their holdings registered As the future looksmuch brighter for the breeding interest owners are growing proportionately concerned about registration andat this point they encounter troubleas parties who bred standard animalsand sold them unregistered and owriersof stallions to which mares were bredmanifest a great indifference aboutfurnishing evidences to establish breeding when called upon This is not rightAny breeder who sells an animal unregistered is in honor bound to promptlyfurnish evidence of breeding whencalled upon and an owner of a sire whowill not promptly furnish the evidenceof breeding when called upon and anowner of a sire who will not promptlyfurnish the evidence that a certainmare was bred to his horse on a certaindate when applied to for that evidenceis not entitled to the patronage of otheibleedersKILLING THISTLESHow the Destructive Weeds Aresoded by GrassThe notion that Canada thistles canbe killed by mowing them in dog day-when the

not be disturbedif thej are doing well for if a stronghealthy colony is rudely disturbed somebees will leave the cluster and perchance the hive If the wTeather is coldenough to chill them many of these willperish Another bad result of such adisturbance is that from some instinctive cause the bees fill themselves withhoney and if a prolonged period of arctic weather follows and prevents themfrom taking a cleansing flight the colony will become unhealthy whichcauses its loss entirelyBut these cautionary suggestions donot imply that there is no winter workto be performed in the apiary Themost skillful bee keeper look aftertheir bees at all seasons He watchesthem throughout the year anil is acquainted with the situation and conditions of each colony It happens sometimes that a colony goes into winterquarters with a large number of oldand nearly wornout bees and but fewof younger stock In very cold weatherthe older bees succumb and fallingsoon clog the entrance to the hive Unless they are removed the entire colonywill smother The entrance must bekept open This is easily done witha wire hpok about a foot long Sometimes excessive moisture in a hivecauses some fatality often sufficient toblock the entrance at the bottom Thusit is necessary to watch the apiaryevery day to avoid unnecessary lossesCare is required in removing dead beesin order that the live ones may notbe disturbed or aroused to activityIt sometimes happens notwithstanding the attentio that may have beengiven to fail feeding that a colony mayhave consumed its supply of honey inmidwinter It must be fed or be lostMethods of feeding are familiar to allbut it is not out of place to state thatone of the simplest and easiest is tofill a wide mouth fruit jar with a sirupmade of granulated sugar and waterof a consistency thick enough to answer the purpose and tying cheesesacking tightly over the mouth of thejar Invert the jar and place it directly over the cluster The bees soon findit and appease their hunger Some beekeepers however prefer bee candy fothis purpose It is made by boilingsugar sirup until it reaches the candystate and then pouring it while hotinto pie tins When cold it is readyfor use It is placed on the framesover the cluster and does not disturbthe bees Farmers VoiceSPLENDID NEST BOXESA Row of Them Can Be Made at a VerySmall ExpenseThe row of nests shown in the illustration can be made by anyone at allhandy with tools They answer everypurpose and are quite inexpensive affairs The row of nests is 12 feet longand contains 12 nests to a tier one tierabove the other 24 in all The nests are1G inches from back to front so that theend boards and partitions betweennests are 1G inches wide The height ofnest row from floor to the broad boardfastened on top of upper row of boxesmeasures a little over 30 inches Thelower nests are shown with the doorsstanding open while the doors of theupper row are shut The doors to thoI 1 i 1 1mmROW OF NEST BOXESupper row open back or up and areheld open by hooks and staples thestaples being driven into the broadboard above The upper doors will stayclosed without fastening of coursebut the lower doors are provided withhooks and staples Little wooden buttons would answer the same purposeand are less expensive This 12 footdouble row of nests is placed lengthwise of the poultry house in such away as to make them the partition between the main or roosting room andthe nest room At each end of this partition there is a tall door frame andscreen door the frame with pickets ontop so that fowls cannot fly over orout The object in having the uppertier of nests sloping is to prevent thefowls from roosting upon them Theycannot gain a foothold and are obligedto be content with the regular roosting arrangement of the house Thebroad board above the nests is fastenedto the door frames and above this isstretched a 32 inch strip of poultry netting to keep them from flying over thispart of the nest box

broodyonesWhen a hen wants to sit a nest andeggs are given her the door opening into the main room is shut and the doorto the nest that opens into the nestroom is left open instead that she mayleave her nest for feed at her pleasure The arrangement is really verycomplete and worth trying The expense of such a set of 24 nests shouldnot be heavy provided they were madeat home from cheap material

of possible hostilitiestvith Spain a special interest attachesto the announcement that a board ofnavy and army officers is to examinePort Jefferson on Garden Key in theDry Tortugas with a view to rehabilitating it and to founding a naval station there Theie are ten low lying islands partly covered with mangrovebushes and the group lies about 120miles southwest of the end of the Florida mainlandUnlike nearly or quite all our otherdefensive works Fort Jefferson was notdesigned to protect an important cityIt is perhaps the most conspicuous example to be found of our fortifyinga purely strategic position for KeyWest has some intrinsic consequenceas a town In the Dry Tortugas whatwe have of value is one of the finestmost commodious and safest harborsof the southern coast and it is desiredboth to make it available for ourselvesand to prevent it from being seizedas the sheltering haven and the baseof an enemyA round half century has elapsedsince Fort Jefferson was begun in 1846under President Polk with JeffersonDavis as secretary of war It is oneof the- largest works in the UnitedStates covering the greater part of Garden Key and was originally designedif we do not mistake for about 420guns although only a part were mounted and it cost about 5000000 It wasseen then as now that an enemys fleetobtaining the harbor of the Dry Tortugas as a base might control both theFlorida straits and the Yucatan channel For this reason it has sharedwith Key West the reputation of beingthe military key of the Gulf of MexicoDuring the civil wrar Fort Jeffersonwas used as a military prison but whenin the reaction after the war post afterpost on the seaboard lost its garrisonand was even suffered to fall into decay Fort Jefferson followed this fateIt attracted attention for a time as theplace of confinement for Dr Muddwhose life sentence was remitted afterhis valuable service during the yellowfever scourge of 18G8 when the surgeons cf the station succumbed Thenit became as it is to day a quarantinestation and this use of it is accordingto a report made by the inspector-generalsdepartment a few years ago anobstacle to its reoccupationIn that report it was urged that theharbor of the Dry Tortugas has beenfor years a tempting and easy prizefor the audacious and that owing toits isolation and accessibility we mighthave lost it at any time during the interval without knowing until too latethat it had passed out of our possession Its real value as a naval auxiliary would have become apparent in theeffort to recapture itIt is noticeable that in the list of the21 principal ports requiring defensecompiled by the fortifications board or1SS5 the harbor of the Dry Tortugasis not included Rut that is not a pointagainst it as even Puget sound wasnot found in the list Several years agoGen Howard advised the reoccupationof Fort Jefferson and the present movement is founded on the desirability ofgetting a more sheltered and deeperharbor than Key West for a naval coaling station in that region The DrjTortugas lying about 60 miles to thewest furnish it is believed such a harbor and at all events on this point theboard will reportTwenty years or more must havepassed since the garrison of Fort Jefferson after being reduced in 1S70 waswithdrawn altogether The marinehospital service which then took possession of it naturally kept up onlywhat its own accommodations neededand the account given by the army inspecting officers a few years ago as toits military condition was discouragingRotten gun carriages cracked bastions rust guns in fact general decay were apparent on all sides Thebrieve work throughout needed and stillneeds repairing All the bastions hadcracked and settled and there werethousands of lineal feet of cracks inother parts of the walls Many of thocasemates leaked and the moisture hadcaused an excessive formation of stalactites Nearly all the embrasures ofthe two tiers of casemates had been enlarged so as nearly to equal in widththe span of the arches It is said thatthis mutilation of the fort was doneby the troops during the fever epidemicof 1SG8The six wooden platforms for the15 incth guns in barbette are in ruinsthrough decay The other barbetteplatfqrms are of old pattern but withfour inch pintles Whether they wouldwithstand the shock of full servicecharges cannot be definitely settled butprobably notIf the Dry Tortugas should be turnedinto a naval coaling base the hospitalwould doubtless be removed and awharf built Probably many of thebuildings could be repaired and madeuseful both for naval purposes and foithe artillery garrison that would be stationed there Fort Jefferson is of thbold type as are the guns now7 mountedthere but the condition of 23 ten inchguns was found by the inspectors to beood and it would be easy to supplement the old ordnance by some modernhigh power guns and mortars so as togive the station an adequate defenseN Y SunKept His VoWhen she scorned me shrieked

started for the carcassintending to watch it in the hope thatthe bear would return He waited andwatched until about 8 oclock in theafternoon when he began to think ofreturning to camp A soft footfall baokin the woods the orafty step of somewild animal just then sounded in hisears Pretty soon the bear was chewingthe caribou meat and Jim could see itplainly He leveled his buckshot gunand pulled the trigger when the wabbling muzzle was pointed in what hethought was the right direction Thebeast went down and Jim started for itThen he stopped with his mouth openThe beast had leaped to his feet andjumped sideways with its back upJim knew the yell and he also reoognized the humped back It was a wounded lynx spoiling for a fight Not havingtime to level his gun to shoot the manclubbed it and

the day Before the mothers setout to work in the morning they wraptheir babies in swaddling barids leaving nothing but their little faces exposed Then the babies are taken andlaid under a ledge of rock from whichwater is falling and by means of abamboo the water is made to drip gently on each babys forehead The effectof the dripping water is most soothingand soon the little ones are all

substantial members ofthe community authorized to act upontheir own judgment was in session atDeaoon Closes he having a site that hewanted to sell for the proposed buildingI regard this movement as deservingof popular approval and aid said theminister It aims to secure a widerintelligence and a better tone of morality among our people Every one shouldgive according to his meansAfter theditor the doctor and thebanker had talked in the same vein thelawyer proposed that they get down tobusiness Deaoon Olose he continued has a desirable lot for which heasks 2 000 It strikes me as a prettystiff price but I have no doubt that hewill make us a donation of 500 andmake a deed of the site for 1500There was applause in which thedeacon did not participate but risingreluctantly he delivered himself as follows I must say that I agree withwhat has been said in praise of this enterprise Our town needs it and thereis no place for it more desirable thanthe lot I have offered Of course I wantto bear my full share of the expenseSince I offered you this lot thedeacon went on there has been a greatimprovement in times Money is easierprices are better and realty gets an enhanced value because of the generalprosperity I will let you have the lotfor 2500 and throw off 500 as a donationThe minister muttered something hewas glad the rest did not hear Thedoctor laughed the banker scowled andthe lawyer

Hatcli Their Eggs byQuer XvioaIt is well known that the Australianmegapod is a bird that is accustomed tosit on its eggs In certain parts of Australia are found numerous mounds ofconsiderable size and height which thefirst explorers took to be burial groundsThese were made by the Megapodiustumulus which uses them for hatohiugits eggs They have sometimes considerable dimensions A nest that is 14feet high and 55 feet in ciroumferenoemay be regarded as largeEach megapod bulds its own nestwith material whioh it gathers from allsides and these are exactly what thegardener uses in the month of March tomake his forcing beds namely leavesand decomposing vegetable matterwhioh by their fermentation give offan appreciable amount of heat In theforcing beds this heat hastens the sprouting of the seeds In the nest it sufficesfor the development and hatching of theyoung birds and the mother can gowhere she likes and occupy herself asshe wishes without being troubled bythe duties of sittingIn the small island of Ninafou inthe Pacific another bird has a somewhat similar habit in so far as it alsoabandons its eggs but in place of obtaining the necessary heat from fermentation it gets it from warm sandThe leipoa or native pheasant of Australia acts like the megapod and watches the temperature of its mound veryclosely covering and uncovering theeggs several times a day to cool themor heat them as becomes necessary After hatching the young bird remains inthe mound several hours It leaves onthe second day but returns for thenight and not until the third day is itable to leave for good
