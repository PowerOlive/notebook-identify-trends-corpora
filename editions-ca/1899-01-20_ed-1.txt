enabled me to take a precaution that it turned out was neededfor as I pushed the door I drove thedeath hunter back with it and the moment it was sufficiently open to let mepass I sprang- out and seized her leftarm Quick as I was however I wasnot quite quick enough to avoid theblow of her dagger and received a fleshwound which however was after allbut slight Then there was anotherstruggle and affairs were adjusted between Babette and myself without anyspeeial harm being done to herNow listen to me I said Whatever happens 1 will kill you first ifthere is any treaehery Take mestraight to madameShe is not here was the sullen replyThen I take you with me to theHotel de Ville Come to your sensesShe broke into the most terrible imprecations but time was precious andI quenched this readily enough and atlast it was clear she was utterly cowedAgain I repeat that no harm was doneand it was only dire necessity that compelled me to use the violence I didCome and I shook her up whereis madameShe looked from right to left with aquick uneasy motion of her eyes Ido not know she is not hereLook here and I gave my prisonera shake I fully believe that madameis here and if you wish to save yourselffrom the rack it hurts more than whatT have done to you you will see that nooarm comes to her You followShe was speechless but her eyes wereblazing with wrath as she made a sullen movement of her headYou had better tell M de Gomeronyour master that I refuse his terms ItTHE BOURBON NEWS PA1US KY FRIDAY JANUARY 20 1899will save him the trouble of knowingthat I have escaped you understandThis time she nodded eagerly enoughNow I went on we will open thelast doorI took the bunch of keys and after atry or two succeeded in hitting on theright one After this I pushed Babettebefore me into the small flagged yardand saw to my surprise that it wasnight and that the moon was outThen I gave the fact no further thoughtbeyond an inward Thank God forthe uncertain moonlight that wouldcover my escape As I pushed my captive along the shadow of the wall untilwe came to the entrance gate I lookedaround and above me carefullv butthere was nothing to indicate wheremadame was A hundred times was 1tempted to turn back and risk all insearching the house for her and it wasonly because I was convinced that thesole chance of saving her was to be freefirst myself that I did not give in to mydesire On reaching the gate I discovered that there was a wicket in itlarge enough to squeeze a mans bodythrough and that this was closed butby a heavy pair of iron cross bars asecure enough defense from the outsideHolding Babette at arms length fromme I put down the bar and opened thewicket Then still keeping my hold onher I freed her hands and bendingslightly forwards and looking herstraight in the face said RememberAnd adieu Mine de MauginotAt these words which brought backto her memory her crime on the battlefield of La Fere she shrank back hereyes seemed to sink into their socketsand as I loosed my hold of her shoulder she fell in a huddled heap on theflags of the yardCHAPTER XVIA COUNCIL OF WARAs 1 slipped through the wicket Icast a hurried glance around me andthen acting on the impulse of the moment ran forwards along the road forabout 50 paces with Babettes daggerclenched in my hand There 1 wasbrought to a stand by a dead wallstudded with iron spikes at the topwhich rose sheer above me for fully20 feet and barred all further progressIt was evident that the Toison dOrstood in a blind alley and that I hadtaken the wrong turning Xot even anape could have scaled the moss grownand slippery surface of those stonesand leaning against a buttress in thedarkest coiner of the wall I stood fora moment or so and waited determinedto sell my life as dearly as possibleshould I be pursued There was nosound however all was still as thegrave So I stole forth from the shadowof the buttress and keeping the daggerieady to strike retraced my steps pastthe Toison dOr and along the windingand crooked passage keeping as faraway from the walls as possible to avoidany sudden attack until at last I fomdmyself in a cross street down which Iwent taking note of such landmarks asT could to gnideme lack when I shouldreturn with vengeance in my righthand The cross street led into otherwinding and twistirfg lanes whosesqualid inhabitants were either flittingup and down or quarreling amongstthemselves or else sitting in a sullensilenceHow long I wandered in that maze ofstreets I cannot sav but at last I cameupon an open space and finding it moreor less empty stopped to take my bearings My only chance to get back to mylodging that night and it was alT important to do so was to strike the Seineat some point or other but in what direction the river lav I could not for thelife of me tell At last I determined tosteer by the moon and holding hertrack to the southwest of me went onkeeping as a landmark on my left thetall spire of a church whose name Ithen did not know So I must haveplodded on for about an hour until atlast I was sensible that the streetwhich I was in was wider than the others I had passed through and finally Isaw before me a couple of lanterns evidently slung on a rope that stretchedacross a street much broader still thanthe one I was in That and the sight ofthe lanterns convinced me that I hadgained one of the main arteries of thecity and it was with an inward ThankGod that I stepped under the light andlooked about me uncertain which direction 1 should take for if I kept themoon behind me as I had done hithertoI should have to cr5ss over and leavethe street and I felt sure that thiswould be a serious error and that wouldonly lead me into further difliculties Itwas as jet no more than a half hour orso beyond Compline so the street wasfull and unwilling to attract the attention of the watch which had a habit ofconfining its beat to places where it wasleast required I began to stroll slowlydown determined to inquire the way ofthe first passer by who looked in a moodamiable enough to exchange a wordwith so bedraggled a wretch as I wasthenI had not long to wait for in a shorttime I noticed one who was evidently awell-to-do citizen hurrvinjr along witha persuading staff in his right hand andthe muffled figure of a lady clinging onto his left arm 1 could make out nothing of her but the man himself wasshort and stout of figure and I ran tothe conclusion that he must be a cheerysoul for as far as I could see by thelight of the street lamps he looked likeone who enjoyed a good meal and a canto follow and approaching I addressedhimTardon monsieur but 1 have lostmy wayI had hardly spoken so much whenloosening his arm from the lady thelittle man jumped back a yard and began flourishing his stickStand back called out the littleman dabbing his stick at meBe still Mangel So you wish tofind the rue de Bourdonnais sirHe had better find the watch interrupted Maitre Mangel they havegone that way towards the Porte StMartinThen this is theRue St MartinA hundred thanks i now knowwhere I am and have only to follow mynose to get where I want I thank youonce more and good nightAt last I was once again in the rue desDeux Mondes very footsore and wearybut kept up by the thought of what Ihad before me and ready to drop deadbefore I should yield to fatigue Therewas no one in the street and seizingthe huge knocker I hammered at thedoor in a manner loud enough to wakenthe dead It had the effect of arousingone or two of the inhabitants of the adjoining houses who opened their windows and peered out into the night andthen shut them again lastily for thewind blew chill across the Passeur auxVaches There was no answer to myknock and then 1 again beat furiouslyat the door with a little sinking of myheart as it came to me that perhapssome harm had befallen these goodpeople This time however I heard anoise within and presently Pantinsvoice inquiring in angry accents who itwas that disturbed the rest of honestpeople at so late an hourOpen Pantin I shouted It is Ido you not know meThen 1 heard another voice and asudden joy went through me for it wasthat of my trusty JacquesGrand Dieu It is the chevalierOpen the door quick manIt was done in a trice and as 1 steppedin Pantin closed it again rapidly whilstJacques seized my hand in his andthen letting it go gambolled about likea great dog that has just found its master1 noticed nowever at the first glanceI took around that both Pantin andJacques were fully dressed late as itwas and that the notary was very paleand the hand in which he held a lanternwas visibly tremblingMonsieur he began and thenstopped but I understood the questionin his voice and answered at oncePantin I have come back to free hercome back almost from the deadThen monsieur there are those herewho can help you still I had thoughtyou brought the worst news and helooked at me where I stood soiled andwet This way M le Chevalier hecontinuedIn a moment rantin cut in DameAnnettes voice and the good womancame up to me with a flagon of warmeuwine in her handTake this first ehevaliei tis MaitrePantins nightcap but I do not thinkhe will need it this night God bethanked you have come back safeI wrung her hand and drained thewine at a draught and then with Pantin alK ad holding his lantern aloft weascended the stairs that led to my apartments As we went up I asked JacquesDid you manage the businessYes monsieur and Marie and herfather are both safe at Auriac I rodeA3I -II 1 m Vyf S -I WA3 NOT QUICK ENOUGHbaek almost without drawing rein andreached here but this afternoon andthen monsieur 1 heard what had happened and gave you up for lostAt this juncture we reached the smalllanding near the sitting room I hadoccupied and Pantin without furtherceremony flung open the door and announced me by name I stepped in withsome surprise the others crowdingafter me and at the first glance recognized to my astonishment de Belin whohad half risen from his seat his hand onhis sword hilt as the door was ilungopen and in the other figure seated inarmchair and staring moodily into thefire saw Palin who however made nomovement toward turning his headand looking coldly at me Not no Belinfor he sprang forward to meet me inhis impulsive way calling outAruidicu You are back Palintake heart man He would never havecome back aloneThe last words struck me like a blowand my confusion was increased by thedemeanor of Palin who gave no signof recognition and there 1 stood in themidst of them fumbling with the hilt of1113- sword and facing the still motionless figure before me the light of thecandles falling on the stern drawn features of the HuguenotMy forehead grew hot with shameand anger as 1 looked from one to another and then like a criminal beforea judge 1 faced the old man and toldhim exactly what had happened aitexcept one thing which 1 kept back Atthe mention of Ravaillaes name and ofhis identity with the capuchin the viscompte de Belin uwore bitterly underhis mustache and but for that exclamation my story was heard in stillnessto its bitter end For a moment onemight have heard a pin fall 3nd thenPalin said And you left her thereThe dry contempt of his manner stungme but I could say nothing save mutterI did what I cculdThe one ewe lamb of the fold thelast and the best beloved he said as ifspeaking to himself and then in a sudden fury he sprang to his feet butv hy do we stand prating here Thereare five of us and we know where sheis comeBut Belin put his hand on his shoulder Patience Maitre Palin patienceI have had enough of patience andenough of trusting others and tiheHuguenot shook off the hand and lookedat me with a soowl Come M d Auriac if you would make amends lea dme to this Toison dOr and we will seewhat an old

have my plan but I shouldlike to ask a question or two before IspeakAnd these questions aireI presume I am suspected of this abductionAnd of more XomdeDien Manyour mare was found dead and besideher

Maitre Palins suggestionYou are saving me the trouble ofthinkingAgain I went on it is not certainif madame is still at the Toison dOrand apart from that I doubt if I couldfind my way back there to

undertooka series of experiments on suakes witha view to extracting a sufficient amountof their venom to form a basis for investigation in order if possible to discover some antidote His laboratory isa curious and somewhat uncanny placeand one from which those with unsteady nerves instinctively recoilThe apparatus for extracting thovenom is a most ingenious and yet avery simply oue A bit of chamois istied over the top of a funnel whichleads to a bottle Everything is securedvery firmly The snake is caught by theback of the neck and placed close tothis chamois He strikes his fangsthrough it when tiny jets of venom arethrown from the fangs upon the glasssides of the bottle trickling thence intothe bottle Again and again the snakeis made to strike If necessary othersuakes of the same species are used until a sufficient amount of the venom iscollectedThe relative deadly qualities of thevenom of snakes have also been the subject of experiments It appears that thediamond back rattlesnake is tbe mostto be dreaded The next in order is thebanded rattlesnake followed by thecopperhead and the water moccasin orcottonmouthThe poison machinery of the snakeconsists of a pair of needle pointedfangs which when the creature is atrest are folded back in the roof of themouth When it becomes angry thesefangs are thrown forward and in theact of striking a tiny jet of poison isthrown from each The poison is a thinyellow fluid which upon exposure decomposes very rapidly Snake poisonif kept from the air or dried retains itsfull force for many years New YorkLedgerINDEMNITY AGAINST LOSSSome Ancient Instance of InsuranceCan Be Eawily FoundProbably the first recorded instanceof insurance was one mentioned byLivy During the second Punio war thecoutractors for delivering corn intoSpain stipulated that the governmentshould indemnify them against loss bythe enemy or tempest Cicero too after his victory in Cilicia seems to haveobtained security against the loss of hisbooty during its transit to Rome Theseinstances however are not regarded astrue cases of insurance by many authorities who assert that only after the revival of commerce in the tenth centurydid it come into vogue If this be sothe first mention of insurance is theestablishment in 1810 at Bruges at therequest of the inhabitants of a chamberof assuranceThe contract of reciprocal insurancewas known likewise iu Portugal iu thefourteenth century aud in the fifteenthSept 10 1436 King Edward of Portugal writes from Lisbon that the merchant vessels of the English which badbeeu chartered for the Tangier expedition had not been insured owing tothe fault of their proprietors whilethose of the Portuguese even ot theroyal navy were It is probable however that insurance came iuto use inItaly early in the twelfth century andwas by the Lombards transplanted intothose countries with which they hadcommercial dealings To them therefore the invention of insurance as it isnow uuderstood is generally concededExchangeTenting Cornstalk PithThe American consul geueral at StPetersburg gives this account of a trialof cornstalk pith made by the Russianadmiralty board on the proving groundsat Peligon near St PetersburgA cofferdam 6 feet long 6 feet deepand 3 feet broad was packed with blocksof cellulose made from the pith of Indian corn stalks The material was supplied by an American corporation A 6inch solid shot was fired through thedam striking it about 20 inches fromthe bottom The shot passed clearthrough both the iron walls and thecellulose packing Less than half apound of cellulose was carried out by jthe projectile The water compartmentof the dam was filled giving a pressureof nearly five feet of water on the perforated surface In just half an hour amoist spot began to show on the outersurface of the dam but it was evidentthe moisture had come along the bottomof the packiug and not along the pathof the shot In four hours no water hadcome through the shots pathThe experiment conclusively demonstrated that a ship provided with acofferdam packed as was the one usedin the experiment could be perforatedfive feet below the water line withoutthe least danger of the entiance of

means of a letter purporting to come from her ladyship authorizing the handing over of hhe caselo the messenger1 sat down and took out my notebook I shall be glad to hear full details I remarked if you will be goodenough to let me have themI will tell you all there is to tellAbout three months ago the jewels weredeposited with us by Lord Pollock onbehalf of his wife and the usual receiptgiven for the same The case was deposited in the strong room after theordirary mistom and there it remaineduntil la Monday morning On thatmorning about 11 oclock a cab droveup to tfcf bank and a footman wearingthe Pollock liverj handed a note to thecashier over the counter It was broughtto me in the absence of the head manager and this is what he saidThereupon he handed me a piece ofstiff note paper bearing a crest andstamped 2t0 Grosvenor Gate MayfairIt was as followsTo the Manager London and Paris BankThreadnecdk Street E C Dear Sir Willyou kindly hand my jewel case to the bearer as I require

Pollock and the receiptbeing in order I of course authorizedthe clerk to hand the case to the messenger immediately This urns uvnnliugiy done and the man having signedthi receipt form he was driven rapidlyway In due course a letter was sentby us to her ladyship confirming thetransaction and next morning w wirastounded to receive a visit trwn Lordand Lady Pollock and to hear that theJtrwela had never been requisition zedbv either of them the first intimationol the business being the letter from thebank Herladyship as youmay well imagine was iu a terrible eontiition and it required the united efforts-of Lord Pollock and myself tobring her to something approaching alational stat Her husband also wasvery emphatic and hinted plainly thathe should hold us responsible for thelessNow Mr Wisney you know as muchabout the case as 1 do for I have givenyou the main facts as exactly as 1 canremember themThank you very much I returnedhaving made a few notes in my book ofLis remarks I wish all persons wereequally concise and clear And now Ishould like to ask you a most importantquestionWhat is it he inquired quietlySimply this Is it in your opinionat all possible that Lady Pollock mayknow more of he theft than she is supposed to know Is it at all probablethat the wixtie business is simply anhChKSTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY FRIDAY JANUARY 20 1899awful device to obtain the jewels anddamages from the bank as wellHe thought for a moment and thensaidAnything is possible in these extraordinary times but such a supposition is certainly not very probableLord Pollock is one of the richest menin England and his wife has an exceedingly liberal allowance as 1 happen to know from our own books Stillof course such a thing is always possibleI hope I am not wronging her ladyship in expressing such a theory Isaid quickly but we all know thatwomen in desperate straits will do desperate things My next step will be tointerview the persons who took part inthe transaction of handing over the diamonds last Monday morningCertainly he replied the headcashier and the junior strongroomclerkHe pressed a bell and a messenger inuniform appearedBe good enough to send Sydneyand Mr Wilson hereMr Sydney proved to be a middleaged respectable looking man whilstWilson was an ingenuous boy of 18Both of them were obviously nervouswhen I addressed themWhich of you I asked saw thesupposed messenger from Lady Pollock last MondayI did sir returned the elder man1 was standing at my desk when a carriage drove up and a tall footmanalightedDescribe him I saidHe was about six feet high cleanshaven powdered wig small hands anda long thin face in fact he was thetypical footman all overA clever disguise doubtless I remarked What elseThere was nothing else very noticeable sir He simply handed me theletter which 1 at once took in to MrReeves here the submanager MrBeeves having examined the note carefully told me to instruct Wilson theyoung gentleman here to fetch thecase This he did and 1 at once gaveit to the man who went oil as brisklyas though he were the honestest chapin the city of LondonThat will do said I and nowwhat has Mr Wilson to tell us Hehad nothing to say beyond confirminghis seniors words and having thankedthe two officials for their informationI dismissed themBising from my chair I told the submanager in a few words what I contemplated doing next I intended going straight to the Pollocks house tocarry on my investigations from thatendYou are quite right I am sure MrBeeves replied and it will be well ifI give you a note of introduction to hislordshipSitting down he hastily scribbled abrief note which I placed in my pocketand then having shaken hands andpromised to inform him if anything ofimportance transpired I took my leaveThe hansom was waiting at the doorNo 230 Grosvenor Gate I cried tothe cabby The man touched up hishorse which deposited the cab and me20 minutes later at the house I requiredLord and Lady Pollock were out theservant informed me but they wereexpected home shortly before luncheon Would I walk into the library and wait I at once resolved todo so and was ushered into the apartment where I sat down and took outthe open letter of introductionIt was very short as such a letter naturally would be It simply stated thatI was the official from Scotland Yard towhom the diamond robbery affair hadbeen intrusted and that any information which could be given me at Grosvenor Gate might probably be of serviceto meThis was all that I gathered on perusing the note for the first time but asmy eyes wandered over it mechanicallya second time I noticed with a curiousfeeling of excitement in my brainsomething which had escaped me onthe first reading Controllingmy agitation as best I could 1 drewfrom my pocket the forged letter to the Ibank and then au ejaculation escapedmeBy Jove I believe Im rightI rushed to the door There was littletime to lose and if my theory were theright one my waiting to interview Lordand Lady Pollock would be quite unnecessary Hailing a cab I drove quickly to Scotland Yard and taking up a directory 1 found that Mr Beeves of theLondon and Paris bank resided at Apsley mansions Begents Park My nextstep was abrupt I went straight to thechief and asked for a search warrant toinvestigate the residence of JohnBeeves of Apsley mansions XWHe gave it to me at once and oncemore a cab bore me away This timemy way lay in the direction of BegentsBarkApsley mansions proved to be a gorgeous set of flats and on inquiry of thehall porter I discovered that MrBeeves flat was on the second floorHe is away just now said the obliging functionary in the city but youcan leave a message with his manI went upstairs promptly and rangthe bell A respectable man servant appeared almost instantlyYou are Mr Beeves servant I believe I asked quicklyYes sir Do you wish to leave aSh91sageo 1 am Detective Sergeant Wisney of Scotland yard and I have awarrant to search these rooms Hereit is You are at liberty to assist me ornot as you choose but there must beno interference you understand thatHe did not appear to understand atall but seemed thunderstricken Itwas obvious that if Beeves were suiltythis man was perfectly innocent of anycomplicity in the business He collapsed into a chair and sat motionlessunable to comprehend my visitHowever there was no necessity forhis assistance and I did not troublehim for it Without further ado Imethodically searched the flat whichfrom the extravagance of its garnishing plainly showed that the ownerthereof was a man of somewhat expensive tastes The dining room revealednothing but in a corner of his sltepingapartment I stumbled against a smallsafe Hardened official as I was myheart beat fircely as I drew out myskeleton keys to try the lock for if thediamonds were in Beeves possession itwas a hundred chances to one theywould be in the safe No man in hissenses would dream of disposing ofsuch well known stones whilst the hueand cry after them was ragingAfter several ineffectual attempts Iwas successful and the safe door swungopen A cry of joy escaped me as I espieda small jewel case bearing the Pollockcrest on the lid The diamonds wereapparently intact not one of them hadbeen removed so far as I could perceive I could hardly believe my goodfortune but all the same I did not waitto gloat over it Stowing awaj the casein the recesses of my breast pocket Ileft the building leaving the amazedservant still wonderingMy journey to the bank whence Inext took my steps or rather to whicha cab bore me was consumed with emotions in which perhaps anxiety predominated I was anxious because itseemed to me that perhaps even at theeleventh hour I might lose my man Ifby any mishap Beeves had got wind ofmy visit to his house he would in allprobability have made good his flightere this Still the diamonds were inmy possession and that was the mainpoint after allAha the bank at last Leaping fromthe vehicle I rushed into the buildingMr Beeves gone yet I shouted toa clerkI think he is just going sir returned the manWiftiout waiting to be announced Idarted upstairs into the room which Ihad quitted that morning Beeves waslighting a cigar previous to leaving thebank and he looked up quickly when IenteredBack so soon he ejaculated thatmeans good news Have you a clew1 have I answered sternly andwhat is more I have the diamonds aswellHe turned very white and clung tothe table for supportAfe you joking man whatdo you meanIt means I returned deliberatelyas I locked the door and pocketed thekey that your crime has been discovered and that you are my prisonerJohr Beeves It is my duty to arrestyou in the queens name on the chargeof being connected with the theft ofLady Pollocks diamondsHe collapsed like a house of cardsdemolished by a blow His kneesknocked together his lips trembledhis hands twitched violently A moreabject creature I have never seen andif ever guilt was written on a mansface and in a mans figure it was written on his face and in his figure thenHe accompanied me down the stairsand into a cab like a man in a dreamThe evidence against Beeves being soconclusive he was advised by his counsel to plead guilty and to make a fullconfession This he did and the confession which revealed a crime ofsingular ingenuity and daricg ranthusThat being desperately hard upthrough high play and betting on theturf he had been at his wits ends toobtain money and it therefore occurredto him to take advantage of his positionat the bank to obtain and dispose ofsome of the banks valuablesThat his first idea had been to do thisand decamp but that further deliberation showed him how he might with impunity obtain his nefarious ends andyet remain in the banks serviceThat the plan which he at length hitupon was to arrange with an accomplice to present himself at the bankwith a letter forged by himself andpurporting to come from Lady Pollockasking that the jewel case deposited byher ladyship should be given upThat he had arranged with the saidaccomplice to wait until the head manager was away from London so thatthere might be nobody to criticise thelorgery for in the absence of the chiefit of course fell upon Reeves himselfto deal with letters of the kind inquestionThat the receipt which the supposedmes senger had handed in with the letter was simply another forgery by theingenious Beeves copied naturallyfrom the genuine document in the possession of Lady Pollock which copyhad been made by Reeves on the morning when the jewels were depositedthree months previouslyHe was sentenced to a considerableterm of imprisonment a punishmentwhich he certainly meritedPerhaps they who have read theselines will wonder what was thf linkwhich set me on the right track andwhich connected John Reeves with thecrime Ah well it was the smallestlink in the world and yet it was justthe kind of link which the most skillfulcriminal is often careless enough toforge and which leads to his destruction The clew in question was merelya semi colon Both the forged letter tothe bank and the note of introductionhanded me by Reeves bore that littlepunctuation mark which is hardlyever used in ordinary correspondenceexcept by professional writers Recognizing the extreme rarity of the markit flashed upon me in an instant of illumination that in all prtbablity thewriter of the forgery and the writer ofthe other note were one and the sameperson Acting on this theory T tookthe action I have recorded and achievedthe success for which I had workedHad Mr Reeves employed a full stop ora

EnquirerTRAITS OF THE OYSTEKThis Shellfish Gets Green on PlanFood Fattens in Fresh Water andIs as Nutritious as MilkPersons who eat oysters frequentlyhave doubtless observed that now andthen the oysters set before them aremore or less green in color There is acommon prejudice against a greenoyster Some persons attribute the coloring to disease and others to parasitesor to the presence of copper Scientific investigation has demonstratedthat this greening of oysters is inreality due to the fact that the oystershave fed on greet plants of simplestructure which are sometimes foundin abundance in brackish or saltwaterC F Langworthy of the office of experiment stations of the United States department of agriculture in a bulletinon Fish as Food says that in theopinion of those who have investigatedthe matter carefully the green color inoysters is harmless In Europe greenoysters are more highly prized thanothers The green color be removed by placing the oysters for a timein water where the green plants are notabundantIt is a common practice of oysterdealers instead of selling the ovstersin the condition in which they aretaken from the beds in salt water toplace them for a period of about 48hours in fresh water in order to fattenthem The oystermen call this operation floating or laying out Theprocess gives the oyster plumpness androtundity its bulk and weight being soincreased as to materiallv enhance itsselling value The belief is commonamong oystermen that this fatteningis due to actual gain of flesh and fatand that the nutritive value of theoyster is increased by the processOysters lose much of their salty flavorin floating however and it is an established fact that if the fattenedoysters are left too long on the floatsthey become lean again Careful experiments have shown that oysters takenout of the natural beds in salt waterand placed in fresh water actually irainin weight This is due largely to thefact that they lose mineral weight andgain a considerable amount of waterBat there is an accompanying loss ofnutrients When in their natural condition oysters contain from one eighthto one tilth more nutritive materialthan when fattenedIt is interesting to note that the governments experiments conducted atthe Xevv Jersey stations thus far haveshown that oysters freshened by floating will not remain alive as long asthose taken directly from salt waterFreshening really reduces the lifeperiod of an oyster one half In theopinion of many consumers the improvement in appearance and flavor ofan oyster due to the dilution of thesalts more than compensates for theloss in nutritive value Prof Langworthy remarks Often flavor has avalue which cannot be estimated indollars and centsOysters come nearer to milk than almost any other common food materialas regards both the amounts and therelative proportions of nutrients Generally speaking a quart of oysters contains on an average about the samequantity of actual nutritive substancesas a quart of milk or three fourths of apound of beef two pounds of fresh codfish or one pound of bread The nutritive substance of an oyster containsconsiderable protein the substancewhose principal function is to make orrepair blood muscle tendon bonebrain and other nitrogenous matterApparently as the oyster grows olderat least up to a certain time not onlvdo the proportions of flesh and liquidsincrease more rapidly than the shellsbut the proportion of nutrients in theedible part increases also For illustration 100 pounds of young oysters in theshell appear to contain less of flesh andof liquids than 100 pounds of older oneand when both have been shucked apound of meat from the shells of theolder oyster would contain more nutriment than a pound from the youngerInvestigation has shown that considering the edible portion of the oysterafter it has been removed from theshell the differences in different specimens are much greater than is commonly supposed This is clearly apparent when a comparison is made ofeither the flesh or liquor of differentspecimens or the whole edible portionof the meats and liquor together Thepercentage of water in the edible portion of different specimens of oysterswhich were analyzed for the UnitedStates fish commission varied fromabout 83 to 91 per cent and averagedS7 per cent In other words the nutritive material in a quart of solidoysters varied from 2 to o 1 3 ouncesThe man who buys oysters in the shellpays for an enormous percentage ofwaste material The average of 31specimens of oysters in the shell forinstance showed only 2 3 10 per centof actual nutrients Clams and mussels yield a somewhat higher percentage X Y TimesWaste of Animal Life in AfricaAlthough in some particulars oxenshow

full of men An excitable volunteer major startled out of his sleepordered the men in support over thebrow of the hill into the trenches Theygrabbed their guns and run over thecrest of the hill only to find the intrenchments filled to the limit withtneir own men They had to lie downjust back ot the trenches without coverThe men in the trenches were blazing-away for all that was in them Thenew men sent up back of them were somany that they could not iillieSidVby side but some had to lie one behind anotherIt was a dark night Orders weredrowned in the vollejs of musketryand to many of the

excitable lad of not more than 17or IS in the rear rank of those back ofthe trenches loaded and fired At thatmoment a comrade just in front of himwho had lifted himself on his elbows tosee the advancing Spaniards flattenedout on his face stone deadThe Spaniards were soon glad toallop back to their intrenchments Thenthe support was ordered back under thebrow of the hill again and brought itsdead with itThe man who had been killed just infront of the excitable lad had a holein him that looked mighty like aSpringfield rifle bullet from the rearA man beside the lad had seen him fireand the dead man drop The lad himself admitted he had fired The captainof the company his men say is a goodofficer but excitable In this case hewas horrified and showed a disposition to be hasty and a

important advancestep that a rural community can takeThe value of a mans farm is not dependent so much on the distance fromtown or railroad as it is on the time required to reach them The value ofgood roads both for business and pleasure has been so clearly demonstratedand so much has been written on thesubject within recent years that permanent road building is not only indorsed but the work is actually beingdone all over New England So alsois the telephone Both have the sameobject quicker and better transportation The highway carries the farmerand his produce The telephone carriesinformation One ounce of foresightis worth a pound of hindsight and thetelephone can safely be said to furnishthe foresightWith the aid of the telephone thefarmer can keep posted on the marketmany times can bargain and sell hisproduce before it leaves his premisesHe can save many useless trip to townby practiaclly bringing the town tohim over the wire It is truly wonderful the way that news can travel overthe telephone Within an hour fromthe time the Associated Press was telegraphing dispatches to the daily papersin the large cities announcing the greatnaval victories in our conflict withSpain the telephones were whisperingthe same thrilling news into the earsof subscribers up in the back woodsfrom Maine to California In fact itis said that the people in Californiaheard the new s two hours by the clockbefore it happenedThe telephone business in all thelarger cities and towns is controlled bylarge corporations that make directpersonal communication possible between points 500 to 1000 miles apartLocal companies can be organized tooperate in country communities atcomparatively small cost to the subscribers and afford a great deal oiprofit and amusement as well 1 havehad a telephone in my house the pastyear and now think I could hardly keephouse without it A few weeks ago t hwhole family were entertained for anhour listening to the soft mellowstrains of music that came to us oveithe wire from the band concert in thecity four miles distant Having hadtwo years experience in constructingand operating telephone lines I can sayfrankly and freely that the

injuring the trees G Frederick in Farm and HomeRolling and Harrowing SoilThe effect of rolling a soil is to conpact it to close up the spaces betweenthe grains produced by cultivation ndthus to facilitate the rise of moisture tothe immediate surface It does good ingrain fields that need the mosture butit means a heavy loss of moiiture if thesoil thus remains compact A good rulethen is to roll the land whenever thecrop shows the need of moisture andthat crop is shallow rooted and as soonas moisture tecomes apparent at thesurface to loosen the soil with a harrow to about three inches The grainwill not be materially injured by theharrow the excessive escape of neededmoisture will be prevented and at thesame time the roots will secure a supply American Fruit Growers JournalA good

measured fromou dietary standpoint for fat andoleaginous fish against which thestomach of a denizen of the warmerzones would revolt lut the frozen fatof the animals of the far north is assweet and palatible tu a resident ofthat region as is the yam or the fruitof the plantain to an inhabitant of thetropics Both kinds of food performthe required function in their respective climatic zones One furnishes themaximum degree of heat to the bodywher it is needed the other the minimum degree of animal heat to sustainliie under its special climatic conditionsThe popular notion prevails that theclimate and foods of the tropics areconducive to indolence and human degeneracy It is quite as much of a popular error as is the other popular theory that fish is food for the brain andthus conducive to a greater mental development and activity If the latter were true of fish diet the Swashesand other aboriginal tribes of thenorthern coast of this continent wouldbe the most intellectual representativesof the human race in existence Asit is they constitute one of the lowesttypes of the race the black of the Australian bush and the Digger Indian ofCalifornia only being inferior to themin the scale of human developmentAs a matter of fact the activity ofmen is determined by other factors inhis existence than either food or climate All aboriginal tribes are content to exist The energies of mindand body are not exerted by them beyond the actual necessities of existence The Esquimaux of the frigidnorth and the Indians of the temperatezone are quite as indolent as the

Little Chance For Male Monkeys at BirthMonkeys in India are an unmitigatednuisance especially in the country Ihave often come across in the junglesadjoining the villages of northern Bengal whole troops of them whose depredations in fields and orchards were thedespair of the unfortunate villagersThese troops always consisted of onehuge male and about 100 females Thefact is when a little monkey is born inthe pack it is suffered to live if a female but instantly killed by the fatherif it happens to be a male The motherhowever sometimes manages to hidethe little one until he is able to getabout and then sends him away beforethe big male catches sight of him Inthis way it often happens that individual males are to be found living bythemselves in single blessedness Nowgetting tired of solitude after a timeand perhaps believing in union as asource of strength these bachelors oftenjoin together and form a pack of theirown as a sort of clubThen the fun begins They wantwives very naturally But how arethey to get them All the femalemonkeys of the country belong to theharem of some big brute or otherClearly the only solution is to attacksuch a harem kill the gotha the aforesaid big brute and then divide thespoils So an ultimatum is sent andrejected War is declared The battleis a fierce one and often lasts severaldays The party attacked always triesto retreat and often traverses severaljungles fields and even villages Butthe pursuit is hot and vigorous and atlast a stand has to be made sometimesin a village green or even an orchard ofsome country mansion In the actualfight the females generally remainfaithful to their lord and master andhelp him fiercely against his numerousassailants But the result is a foregoneconclusion and the several widowsafter a ver short period of mourningusually manifested by a show of illtemper are consoled by the victoriousmalesNow these battles cause sad havoc tothe fields and orchards of the countryand often prove a positive danger to thepeople for though monkeys seldom attack men woe to the luckless one whoventures to come near them in theirdeadly struggle Moreover when pressedby hunger these packs are not to betrifled with You may not mind eventhe damage done to your orchard byhundreds of monkeys gobbling up everything they can lay their hands on butit is quite a different matter when youhave to shut your doors and windowsand stay in for days at a time because ofthe anny outsideConsequently the object of the nativesis to break up these packs by capturingtheir leaders Killing is against the dictates of conscience but capture is notespecially as the monkey is liberated ina short time as will appear presentlySo when a pack is about the natives employ the following method Close to anorchard a bit of level space is selectedand a hole dug in it about 2 feet deepand 6 or 8 inches in diameter A nooseis made at one end of a long stout cordand placed over the mouth of the holeThe cord is then passed through a pulleyor ring attached to a tree close to thehouse and the other end held some distance away by a concealed person Thenoose and about 10 or 15 feet of thecord are covered with sand Then a nicetempting banana is placed in the holeand a number of rotten ones coveredhowever with fresh skins are strewnall over the ground near the holeWhen the pack comes the femalesare too shy to venture out into the openpace near the house but the big gothais a brave fellow He sees the bananason the ground leaps down takes up onethrows it away in disgust then anotherwith the same result Suddenly he notices the nice tempting ne in the holeand plunges his arm in Immediatelythe cord is pulled the noose fastenedon the arm close to the shoulder and themonkey dragged willy nilly to the treeTvhcrc tbs pulley or ring fc atchedThen the hiding shikari comes forthand circling round and round the treewith the cord held tight in his handbinds the unfortunate monkey safe andfast ajl Lut the head The pvrfley orring is iatroduced not merely to bindthe monkey to the tree but also becauseit would be highly dangerous to dragthe infuriated brute right up to a personThe monkey however is not killedInstead they lather his head amd faceno special care being taken in selectingthe finest soap or the purest water Theoperation is an interesting one and asource of great amusement to the bystanders The monkey however dodgeshis head about only to get a good doseof soap in his eyes and mouth Then hehas enough of it especially as he feelsdreadfully achy all over and the cordscutting into his body every inch tosay nothing of the personal remarks andthe highly adjectival language of thebystanders He submits to his fate witheastern stoicism His head is shavedclean as a billiard ball and then theface as well nice and smooth like ababys Then they let him go But alassuch is the vanity of life his wiveswill not have him now that his beautyis gone They disown him completelycut him dead Nay they drive himaway from the pack with contumelywith the ends of their tails in the absence of domestio broomsticks Andthus being without a leader the packis soon broken up Strand MagazineThe
