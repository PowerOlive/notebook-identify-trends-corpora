Master Herbert Gardner, the little
son of Elder W. A. Gardner, who re
sided here until November, died at the
home of his father at Olatha, Kansas.
January 17, after a short protracted
illness. Herbert has ben in a decline
since early last spring. It as
thought I when the summer weather
came on he would build up.
When theTfamily broke up for the
summer, after Elder Garaner resigned
his charge as pastor of the Christian
church here, Herbert went to Shelby,
O.. to spend tha summer with friends.
During the time he gained no strength
and when the family returned in the
i fall he was unable to come. Later in
I the autumn he was seized with a seri
ous attack of pneumonia and for a
number of days his life was despaired
of. However, he rallied, but never
' regained bis strength.
I About the first ot January he was
moved to the Jhome of his father at
Olatha, Kansas, where he continue
to grow worse unTn me enu came, ine
grief-stricken family have the sympa
thy of a multitude of friends here who
are deeply interested in their welfare
and success.

Citizens Complain About Crass
ings.
Considerable complaint has been
heard from the residents of both High
and Pleasant streets about the cross
ings that were removed a few years
ago. During the past week the con
dition of both streets ha3 been some
thing terrible. Pedestrians have been
compelled to wade through mu4 al
most ankle deep to get from one side
of the street to the other. There is no
way of flushrng either High or Pleas
aut to get rid of the mud for the wank
of crossings and the citizens are com
pelled to go through the deep mud
whenever it rains. We would suggest
thb city fathers take some action and
replace the crossings that were removed.
Sunday School Teachers Orga

various curchss of Paris met Sunaay
