R3 MARY LEWIS wife of a promi
nent farmer and well known by all
old residents near Belmont N Y
writes For twenty seven years 1 had been
a constant sufferer from nervous prostra
tion and paid arso sums of money for
and advertised remedies without bene
fit Three years ago my condition was
alarming the least noise would startle and
unnerve me I was unable to sleep had a
number of sinking spells and slowly grew
worse I began using Dr Miles Restorative
Nervine and Nerve and Liver Pills At first
the medicine seemed to have no effect but
after taking a few bottles I began to notice
a change I rested better at night my appe
tite began to improve and I rapidly grew
better until now I am as nearly restored
to health as one of my age may expect God

I rrot
T liavn boon
to 7uc at once said Mrae
searching for Felice ever
tinco I received raailames directions I
do not tLinlc that she can be in the house
Indeed if inadanie will permit nic I tnink
I can TCaS Felice iias lvcn in tho habit
of goiig out of evenings Felice has a
lover
Indeed said Mme Perrot
nrettv girls fTonornHy liavo beans
she should not fcrget her duties
If inadanio will permit the servants
say that this beau of Feliuds is a gentle
man not a man of her own position and
that but no mattor it is none of my
business Only young girls wore more
prudent in my days-
4 1 will speak to Felice said madawo
It was right of you to mention this
Then she Mink back into her chair and
waited a little longer Sho was not r
nervous person and yet a gloom and dread
for which sho had no words began to set
tle down upon her Sho shuddered sho
grew cold sho dared not look behind her
Now she was gone The dread
knew not what was heavier than
of sho
before
Sho could neither scream nor run
All that sho could do was to drag herself
to bed and draw the coverlets over her
head Whether she fainted or lost con
sciousness sho never knew
It was late when sho awoke The hands
of tho alabaster clock upon tho mantel
piece pointed to the hour of 10 but instead
of tho usual domestic rounds of tho hour
sho was conscious of a strange bustle and
confusion and sho thought sho heard tho
name Felico repeated in tones of horror
more than once Why did they not como
to her and tell her
In a moment more the door opened and
M Perrot wrapped in his quilted dress
ing gown camo in His faco was very
grave
Youre awake my love he asked
Yes I am awake What has hap
pened
Your maid Felico is dead Sho has
taken poison Her mother a washerwom
an lives in the Rue St Cvr She went
there yesterday afternoon and this morn
ing was found dead in bed The lamen
tations of the poor woman awakened mo
Sho had brought a note which Felice had
left for you Shall I read it
Yes mon ami said Mmo Perrot
trembling violently
Adored madame ho began I shall
never dress that beautiful hair again I
knew it when I arranged it an hour ago
When you return home Felico will bo
dead Sho is too miserable to live Ah
madame when you touch that little bell I
have obeyed so long it seems to mo that
my spirit must hear it and como to you
again
Henri cried Mme Perrot with a
scream Oh Henri this is terrible Fe
lico undressed my hair herself at midnight
Felice who was then dead Come to
me Let mo touch you Save me from
this great terror that is gathering about
me
M Perrot flew to his wifes side The
light from tho open window fell across tho
pillow and over the beautiful head that
lay upon it Ho stared at it for a moment
Mon Dieu my child he cried
amazed and horrified what has hap
pened Your hair has turned white
And this is how Mmo Perrots hair
turned white at the age of 20 Exchange
Manslaughter In Football
In an English case Mr Justice Hawkins
recently said respecting manslaughter in
football that it might be useful to remind
those who played this rough and danger
ous game that if a man caused violence
whether willful or through gross negli
gence to another in such a way as to pro
duce death ho would be responsible for
tho fatal issue and that if he willfully
caused grievous bodily harm to another
and thereby caused his death his crime
would bo not manslaughter but murder
It appears froin Law Notes London
that Jbhe accused was convicted in this
case but allovred to go on his own recog
nizance of 50 to come up for judgment if
called upon to do so Case and Comment
A SAILOES YAM
Courtin haint done in thesodays like it
was when me an Hole Tomes was sailin
round in tho social wThirl lookin fur con
sorts Them times wod put on every stitch
of canvas and go after tiro prize even if wo
had to do a little smugglin or turn pirate
fur a trip or two If Hek had gone into
I the navy stead of tradin all ovor tho hull
Well I hod be a admiral now draw in pay
0nly i on tho retired list and telling tho strategy
board moron they over dreamed of
When wo uster drop anchor at the ole
town where Hek made hisfhst landin the
skipper which was Hek hisself would
put on his shore goin cloes be pulkd to
the landin steer a straight course to his
mothers house just to let her know ho
was in port and then hoavo ahead till ho
reached a certain young lady as ho know td
ever sinco ho got his bearins
After she had refused hi in five times
runnin Hek begin to have a idee maybe
she thought he couldnt capture her and
that was jest the same as saym that the re
she fancied strange voices borne to her on- was no sailin rough enough to keep him
tho breeze that lifted the curtains over the
open windows
In tho salon M Perrot and some old
friends drank wine and played ccarto
She would have gono to them had sho
dared but sho dreaded tho long corridor
too much Sho absolutely did not daro to
open tho door
Some one who knew tho valuo of the
jewels she had worn that day might have
followed her home The idea of the black
vis aged ruffian was so terribly vivid that
Mine Perrot actually gave a little scream
and seizing tho small silver hand boll
which stood upon tho table near her rang
it violently
It was in this way that she was wont to
summon Felice from her own little room
hard by The other servants only answer
ed the bell which communicated with tho
kitchen but Mmo Perrot had now be
come to nervous to cross tho room to
touch it
She rang the little silver bell and looked
over her shoulder toward the door hoping
that some one had heard The door open
ed and Felice entered slowly
Her faco was very pale her large dark
eyes were darker than ever SLo mado
her little courtesy and stood before Mmo
Perrot with her hands folded together
You have been a long whilo in com
ing said Mme Perrot I havo waited
for you two hours This must never hap
pen again
No madame never again
See that it docs not My dressing
gown Felice
The girl already held it in her hands
Usually sho was brisk and active in her
movements Today she was strangely
slow and solemn
If it was my shroud you could not be
graver over it cried Mme Perrot
There comb my hair and go You are
too frightfully solemn to endure any lon
ger
It ismadameswill that Ijshould comb
her hair she said
Have you gono crazy Felice Have
you not dono it every night for a year
If it is madamos will I must do it
said Felice in tho same strange way and
sho stepped behind the ladys chair
Slowly the great masses of golden floss
fell about tho ladys shoulders Softly tho
maid gathered them under her hands and
began to pass the comb through them
As she did so Mme Perrot experienced
such a shock as one receives from an elec
tric battery
What a strange feeling she cried
Again tho comb entered her hair
Again sho experienced that singular sen
sation
What are you doing to me Felice
sho cried starting to her feet What are
you doing to me You
I But there was no one there Tho door
hrd not opened or shut Felice had been
standing behind her tho instant before
from gcttin her So the next time in mo
bein first mate of the sloop with her crew
of seven all told Hek called mo into tho
cabin fur to hold a council of war Then
I went out and had a talk with tho crow
and when Hek G foot 200 pounds and
with lungs accordin kim out with his
courtin unerform on to tako tho boat fur
tho dock ho saicf quick and snappylike
Now you all know what you got to do
boys
Aye aye they sung out and then fell
to laughin soons nek was out of earshot
Ho coursed rouud past tho old ladys jest
to report and then hurried to Kates sho
bein the one he was manouvorin fur Her
dad was a jolly olo dog hisself bein hid
up at that time with gout which he was
doctorin fur rheumatiz Hek had another
council with him ho havin lost his con
sort when Kate was carryin short sail aud
when they got through ho was roarin so
with laughin he couldnt git a chance to
swear cause his leg was killin him
Courso Kato como in when she heard
ail this racket and after they had dipped
pennants Hek told her as how he had
thought maybo shed liko to go aboard tho
Spright that buin his schooner KU-
said that she didnt havo no particular
cravin to see tho beat but when ho told
her bout a lot of thii gs ho had from
Chinoy bright feathered birds and other
trinkets ccurse she wanted to go waitin
fur proper urgin as all gals do I vvouM
bo gone long daddy sho said on leavin
but ho givo her kind of a long salute
which imdc Hek more determined than
oer Just as thiy vas bout to come
longside we was swingin the schooners
bowsprit slowly frum the shore and haulm
lusty on the ropes as tho sails went up
4 What tho devil arc you doin there
thundered Hek Whats tho meanin of
all this
I It means wo gotn new skipper an-
swered big Tim who was tho ugliest man
on salt water Kevins commandin now
I That was me
Great heavens A mutiny shouted
1 Hek as ho sprang aboard with Kato up as
1 quick as hisself Tim clutched a sheath
knife and I had an ax when I told Hek to
1 go below seein as Iwas in command
Ill defend this lady with my lifo
roared Hek and he looked so fierco that
durncd if I wasnt gittin uneasy Things
looked still worse when the gal picked up
a handjpi3e and cracked Tim vor his
busiiy red head afore ho know sho was af
er him We all rushed at her s though we
I was goin to tear her to pieces but I said
wo wouldnt hurt a hair of her head if tho
fight was stopped right there
j Then I surrender says Hek but the
girl was of lightin stock and after callin
him a coward and a land lubber sho was
fur crackin more pates and wo had to
hustle the couple below whilo he was tryin
to tell her that ho would have fought the
whole crew but fur fear of havin her
killed But that didnH suit her She
I made thrco or f ciiir sallies and there wasnt
a man cf us had a wholo co erin to his
faco when sho linerly settled down to
abusin Hek fur giviu up to thomurdorin
pirates
Ilo wasnt tho man that could stand this
long so one night after sho had given
him a terrible dressin down fur givin up
his ship and allow in her to be carried ell
in it he waited till sho hael time fur to git
to sleep in her bunk and somehows he
gQt on to the deck Then there was the
darndest rumpus you ever hear fur bout
15 minutes When the gal camo fly in up
to tako a hand we all felt likoclimbin tho
masts but Hek tolel her as how ho hael re
captureel tho ship and tho admiring look
she give him was what hohadbeencruisin
after fur years Ho give us a good talkin
to and hael a harel tiino convincin her that
wo should not all bo put in irons but he
said ho must havo help in runnin the
schooner and that ho would shoot the first
1 man that didnt obey orders
Wo mado a port way down on the south
ern coast just as soon as we could and
thero Hek and Kate was spliced by a regu
lar church pilot When wo all rushed up
after the words was said and hugged the
skipper and told his consort how much we
thought of her when big Tim pulled his
topknot and said as ho had dono nuthin
but what he was ordered her eyes got big
ger and they wasnt so much color in her
face But I told you what kind of stock
she came of Soons she got tho skipper
in the cabin sho said Hek did daddy
know about this
Well I dont think ho expected you
back that night
W7hat made you do it Hek
Causo I loved you Kate and that
music fellow seemed to bo sailin round me
in the race I jest had to shanghai you or
kill him off
Hold she said and looked as anxious
as though the schooner was afire If that
mutiny had been real business would you
have pitched in and helped retake the
ship
There wouldnt have been one left to
tell the tale Kato
Then she fell into his arms and it was
big Tim that come sneakin on deck to tell
11s she had signed papers fur life and
while Hek might sail the ship shed alius
sail Hek
That gives you some idea of how we
used to do our courtin in them good ole
days Exchange
First Opera Glasses
The single opera glass was iirst used in
the time of Louis XIV It became the
rage and everybody used one The double
opera glass Jumelle was invented in
1825 but did not at first find favor with
women A treatise was written In the
early part of this century on lart do lor
gner in which it was shown that a woman
with fine arms would hold the glass with
both hands if sho were blessed with fine
hands she would tako off her gloves if
her neck were lpug sho would recline back
in her chair and so on It was quite a
treatise on coquetry New York Post
