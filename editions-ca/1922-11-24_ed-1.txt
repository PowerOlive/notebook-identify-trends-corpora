It has been a long time sinceKentucky was the scene of acute tobacco troubles of depredations committed against the growers determined to raise a crop. With burleyand dark tobacco growers alreadyorganized for co-operative marketing, troubles that formerly besetthe tobacco farmers seem to be over.Several attempts have been madeto control the acreage, and, failingby lawful means to influence thegrowers to adopt the "no crop"idea, unlawful methds often wereresorted to in the hope of intimidating and coercing the recalcitrant growers. Favorite methodswere- "salting" and "scraping" theplant beds, thus preventing any setting out of a crop; cutting downof growing plants in the field andeven the burning of tobacco barnsafter the crop had been gatheredand was4 in process of curing forthe sale market, were among theoutrages.Growing tobacco under such circumstances was a hazardous anduncertain undertaking, but co-operationand sound business principles have supplnated force and intimidation in the tobacco growingindustry.DECEMBER 16 TIME LIMIT FORVETERAN AIDDisabled veterans who have notyet made application for vocationaltraining must do so before December 16 or lose the opportunity ofreceiving, government aid, Col.Charles R.

In fact, the Paris Water company has issued severalwarnings, advising people to restrict the use of hose, and are nowissuing another, warninng them tobe careful and conservative in theuse of water.For a second time in alomst acentury the water has reached anextremely low stage in the creeks,Stoner creek being the main sourceof supply for the city. Should asudden cold snap come of sufficientseverity to freezs the creeks, withthe small body of water in themnow, the situation would take on amore alarming aspect, and the citywould probably be placed in a serious plight. There must always bea sufficient supply for use in casesof fire, and to censerve this it mightbecome necessary to cut off manyuses of water as at present.oNOTICE TO WATEE CONSUMEES.OWING TO THE CONTINUED,DEOUGHT WE WILL BE COMPELLED TO LIMIT THE USE OFWATEE TO SPECIFIED HOUES.WILL TJEGE ALL TO ECONOMIZEIN THE USE OF WATEE AS MUCHAS POSSIBLE.PAMS WATEE COMPANY,'.

In a report sent out by Director of Warehouses Ralph M. Barker to the tobacco trade generally.it is shown that tobacco sales atauction' dropped from 297,000,000pounds in 1920 to 57,000.000pounds in 1921, the first year of theco-operative, or a loss to the auctions of more than 80 per cent.These figures, of course, are based on the growers who sold throughthe association in 1921. When onereflects that since the crop of 1921was sold 16,000 additional growershave come into the association, hemay get some idea of the probableloss to the auction system this yearcompared with 1920 or even with1921.A speaker for the Burley Association a few days ago predicted thatten years from now. if the words"loose leaf warehouse" are mentioned in the hearing of a farmchild, he will ask: "Why, what wasa loose leaf warehouse?" The Interior Journal believes that is notoverstating it.Much fun is poked at "KentuckyColonels" and they have furnishedthe inspirations for many a misapplied, but the ordinary Kentuckiandoes not resent or seriously objectto being dubbed "Colonel." Manyof them like it.Some few of the Colonels acquired the rank in military service andothers had it conferred upon, themby being appointed on the Governor's staff, but the most of themwear the title only through courtesy. For some unaccountable reason an auctioneer is accorded theprefix of colonel and the politicalboss is addressed as colonel by hisunderlings. Strangers have noticedthat the most reticent Kentuckian isapt to warm up and respond whenaddressed as "Colonel" and this ina way may account for freedomwith which the title is applied.Before the passing of the mintjulep and old-fashioned toddy, thepunsters with constant reiterationmade it appear that a "KentuckyColonel" acquired the title becausehe was a good judge of whisky, butthis was a gross libel on manybone-dry "Colonels." The erroneous impression gave rise to the oldcouplet: "Kentucky is full of colonels and the colonels full of corn."Tennessee has a preponderence ofgenerals due to the fact that everypublic . prosecutor acquires and retains the title. - In Virginia, themajors are said to predominate,but in Kentucky it is safe to use"colonel" indiscriminately.oDON'T PUT IT OFFOur line of Christmas Greetingcards is complete.

Kehoeand Bush W. Allen, of the BurleyTobacco Growers' Co-operative Association, last week, Mr. Kehoesaid the growers were not askingany favors or any special consideration but that they simply askedtheir constitutional right to exemption of farm products from taxation.for linear after -they are grown."We simply claim that, underthe constitution, farm products areexempt from taxation for one yearfrom the time they are grown,"said Mr. Kehoe. "The purpose ofthe framers of the constitution inthat exemption was to encourageagriculture, develop full agricultural production, and, consequently, j the distinguished guest of the nareasonably low prices for food pro- tion and . many of the Kentuckyducts."Welearned at Frankfort thatthe farmers of Kentucky have been .paying taxes on farm productsassessed at $36,000,000, when as a.matter of law that property oughtnot to have been assessed at all.The amount we expect to save thefarmers who are members of theBurley co-operative is a tremendoussum, hundreds of thousands of dollars in the long run. and our contention is that none of this taxshould be paid by the. growers."Our tobacco in the Burley district is not 'grown' in the meaningof the Constitution until about October 1, when it is cut. From thatdate until October i, following, orrather September 30 following, it isexempt from taxation. If we haveany of it still left on July 1, thatportion of the crop will be subjectto taxation."The 1922 crop, which was cutabout October 1, similarly, will notbe taxable until October 1, 1923,and will not be actually taxablethen until the following July, asthere is no taxation date, or datewhen property is listed for taxationuntil the following July, whichwould be applicable to that crop."It is extremely improbablethat at any time we shall have tobacco on hand as late as July, fromthe previous year's crop, so that Iam certain the tobacco growerscrops in our hands will not be subject to State, county and city taxation."

In a way it recalls thevisit of Gen. Marquis de Lafayette,of Revolutionary fame, who visitedthe United States in 1826 on a like,mission.If M. Clemenceau will includeKentucky in his itinerary he canbe taken over the very ground traveled by his illustrious predecessorninety-six years ago. General Lafayette was taken from Louisvilleto Frankfort by stagecoach. Thedistinguished French hero who cameto the' aid of the struggling American patriots was feted wherever hewent. The beauty and chivalry ofthe State vied in paying homage tobelles of that dayrelating to theirnever tired ofgranddaughtersthat they had danced with the gal-lant Lafayette.No doubt an effort will be madeto get "Tiger" Clemenceau to cometo Kentucky and if he does he maybe assured that Ken'tuckians 'willput the big pot in the little one inah effort to outdo the grand reception accorded his distinguishedpredecessor nearly a centry ago.oSHEINERS TO GATHER IN LOUISVILLE Between 7.000 and 10.000 Shriners are expected to gather in Louisville Thanksgiving Day for thesacred festival of the Temple ofKosair," and in addition to the regular initiation ceremonies throughwhich applicants for membershipwill pass a complete social programhas been planned for the day byLouisville members of the clan.Headquarters will be maintainedat the Henry Watterson Hotel.
