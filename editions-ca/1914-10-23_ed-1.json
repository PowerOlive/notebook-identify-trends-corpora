Feathered Visitors to Panama.
A number of the birds in Panama
are mere winter visitors from the
United States. These include such
familiar varieties as sparrows, tana
gers, orioles, flycatchers, swallows,
thrushes, warblers and catbirds.
Surer.

who counts on his fingers is not apt
to be so disappointed as the man
