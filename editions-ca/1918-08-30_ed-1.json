to relatives of the bridegroom, after
which they will ge to Camp Perry, in
Northern Ohio, where Lieut. Nelson
is stationed.
The bride is the only daughter of
Judge and Mrs. T. P. Wadell. She is
an attractive, brillia-nt and accom
plished young lady, a graduate of the
M. F. C. and was a member of the
class of 1916, a member and organ
ist of the Baptist church and prom
inent in church work. For the past
year she has occupied the position of
pianist at the Majestic picture thea
tre, and was instrumental in causing
many to spend many happy hours at
this popular place of amusement.
Lieut. Nelson for the past two
years was one of the faculty of the
M. 3M. I. Coming into our community
as a stranger he soon made many
friends. He resigned his position in
May, 1918, and went into the IT. S.
Army, and has since been stationed
at Camp Perry, 0. He was a military
man, and had the rank of Major at
the M. M. I. He will probably remain
in Camp Perry the greater part of the
winter, during which time his .wife
will be with him. They were the re
cipients of numerous useful and
handsome presents.
Mrs. Nelson belongs to one of the
pioneer families of Kentucky, with
an extensive relationship throughout
the State. Her father is a member of
the firm of W. D. Wadell & Co.,
druggist, and lor several years was
Police Judge of Millersburg. The
young couple left Millersburg with
showers of congratulations from all
who knew them.

THE STANLEY STEAMER
w
22nd Year Its Fuel as KEROSENE
' The "pick-up ' of the Stanley in emergency does not wait for the power to be built up
in a fly wheel; the power is stored in advance, to be instantaneously delivered to the driv
ing wheels, AND THERE ARE NO GEARS TO SHIFT.
In city traffic, in rough going, at blind corners, on unexpected hills you have always done
ivhat your car wanted you to do because you have been limited to the power delivered by
the speed of the motor the power in the fly-wheel. With the stored power of the Stanley
at your command, your car does what you want it to do, and precisely when you want it,
and with not a single controlling device except the finger touch at the throttle. '
YOU WANT A CAR WITH STANLEY PERFORMANCE
That iswhy you have been buying cars with 6 or 8 or 12 cylinders and 3,000 or more
revolutions a minute.
YOU HAVE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE
thai; the only way you can get the performance you want is by multiplying the cylinders
and increasing the flywheel speed. Tht Stanley with only two cylinders, with only 17
moving parts in tha engine and only 400 revolutions a minute-will prove to you that
this belief is erroneous. We want you to know this Stanley performance; we want you
to. realize that the ideals you have been longing for are here NOW. We want to convince
you by putting you at the wheel of a STANLEY. " .
