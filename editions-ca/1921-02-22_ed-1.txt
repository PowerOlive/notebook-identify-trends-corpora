Plans for such a memorialwere discussed shortly after theclose of the war, and later a memorial fund, aggregating more than$10,000 was subscribed, and morethan half paid over.There was a wide divergence ofviews as to what forjm the memorialshould take, and, due to the highprices of materials of all kinds, nodefinite steps have ever been takentoward construction. In recentweeks discussion of the proposed memoiial has been revived and the directors of the Paris CommercialClub have given the matter consideration at the request of some ofthe subscribers.The directors have decided that,in the event the proposal meetswith the approval of those most interested, a referendum vote of .allsubscribers should be taken to determine the forni of memorial.Among the suggestions that 'havebeen made are these: A monumentin the court house yard; an educational fund; a playground for thechildren, with -a suitable memorialtablet; a memorial bridge overStoner creek, at ihe foot of Mainstreet ; (memorial parks; memorialmarkers of different designs.These suggestions will be incorporated in the referendum, anablanks will be left for any furthersuggestions. After the referendahave been returned, the CommercialClub directors will recommend theconstruction of that form of memolial which received the largest number of votes.-oNOTICE.Foot vr specialist permanently located.

Company sold Friday on the floorsat the Bourbon house TMn 3 o wnijOf 132.890 pounds of tobacco fo-M.tf,dU.87, an average of $10.3?.The maiket showed a slight improvement with a larger offeiing ofthe higher grades. There wa aconsiderable quantity of inferior tobacco on the floors, and the averagettas correspondingly low. The cropaverages ranged from $19.20 to$22.62. This average was-realizedon, a crop of 1,345 pounds belonging to Ray & Conway.Exclusive of the sales' held yesterdey -there has been sold on thefloors of the local tobacco warehouses, foi the season a total of 6,308,825 pounds of tobacco, for anaverage of $12.60 per hundredpounds. Of this amount the Bourbon Tobacco Warehouse Cosold3,840,780 pounds at an average of$12.51, and the New IndependentTobacco Warehouse Co. 2,468,145pounds, for an average of $12.88.Sales of tobacco on the Pans markef during the pat.t week showed aslight advance, grade for grado, overthe prices of the week before. Theaverage for the week was a decreasej 0f one cent from that of the previousweek's ales, but a large amount ofinferior tobacco went over thebreaks at all the houses. Goodweather during the week was probably largely responsible for the unusually large receipts, but now thata big snow and a cold spell has arrived it is expected that the rushwill be lessened for a few days. 'It appears that the best of thecrops .have already been brought inand sold, and now the fanmers aregetting rid of some of their lowgrades. A big effort was madeearly in the season to keep the inferior grades off- the market in thehope that this might cause an advance in the prices of the bettergrades. It is the opinion of thegiowers and wuiehousemen thatthe markets in the future will showmore strength.The Bourbon Tobacco WarehouseCo. sold 3resterday on the Bourbonfloor 289,385 pounds for $29,120.43,an average of $13.51. The generalquality of this floor oftobacco wassomewhat better than usual.PARIS HIGH SCHOOL DEPARTMENT REPORTS.COMMERCIAL DEPARTMENTThe Commercial Department ofParis High School is serving thecommunity in a splendid way.Number enrolled in Bookkeeping,45.Number enrolled in TypewritingNumber enrolled in Shorthand 30.Number of different students r61.Number of High School studentsenrolled 47.Number of young women and menwho aie working and taking parttime work in the CommercialSchool 14.HOME ECONOMICSOne of the most efficient departments of the City High School is theDepartment of Domestic Science orHome Economics.Number enrolled in sewing classes 42.Number enrolled in cooking"classes 4 2.Two rooms are used for laboratories for this depai tjTnent.

Walter Payne, is notas complete as it should be. "Thefundamental principle of city maildelivery," says Mr. Payne, "is tohave the houses of the city properlynumbered and street sign.s properlyplaced on the corner of each street.""The cost of installing the housenumbers is such a small sum incomparison to the i-id it gives themail carriers" said -Mr. Payne, "thatevery housekeeper or property-ownershould see that their property isproperly numbered." Mr. Paynethinks that in most cases where thenumbers are missing U is due tothoughtlessness on the part of theowners, and that it the matter isbrought to their attention he believes they will comply with the request. oThe loyalty in. business meansstanding up for your own opinionbefore your employer axjd for youremployer's opinions before theworld.SOMETHING NEW IN THEMOVIES.The Latin Department of nio ' In the event that sufficient pUdgParis High School announces the. to reduce the 1921 acrttfi ofshowing, in the near future, of a burley tobacco are not secure tomoving picture veision of the Sixth the Burley Tobacco Growers' JLmoBook of Vergil's "Aeneid." i ciation meets on March 7, an imtwi-This film was produced in Janu- j sive campaign will be put in. ottn-'ary by the Girls' High School of At-' ciation (meets on March 7, an JBltClanta, Go.

In suchcases many features of Vergil's descriptions have been borrowed.

A merry sex war isin progress in Uncle Sam's money factory. The war started when the PlatePrinters' union in the bureau of engraving aud printing made formalcharges that there were, too many"trifling girls" itL the bureau and thatthey were retarding the efficiencyand the amount of production ofpaper money. In their charges theplate printers intimated that too muchtime was, spent by girls employed inthe bureau in administering "littledabs of paint and powder." In factit was intimated that the plate piintters objected to "flappers" being employed in the bureau.The plate printers let themselves infor trouble.Federal Employees' Union No. 105,embracing the women employees of thebureau, at an indignation meeting,condemned the attitude of the. plateprinters, denied their charges and deplored their giving publicity to whatthey alleged to be a misstatement offacts.Miss Gertrude McNally, secretaryof the union, declared that the recordsof the examining division showedthat the greatest percentage of spoilage of printers' work is for "slywipes," "lifts" and "breaks," whtclispoilage could in no way be attributedto the assistants."Plate printers are paid by thepiece .rate and in many instances thepresses are speeded up for productionat the expense of the quality of thework," Miss McNally stated.It is predicted that the charges ofthe Plate Printers' union will resultin considerable friction in the futurebetween the printers and. their assistants, since if inefficiency does existthe responsibility for the same hasbeen placed by one side on the other.HATS OF OTHER LANDSThis young girl of the Spreewalddistrict of Germany Is shown wearing the headdress donned by all women of the district during the festiveseasons.FINDS GROOM IS BELOW PARSwiss Father Sues Detective Bureaufor False Recommendationof Daughter's Suitor.Geneva.

The Kentucky GoodRoads Association was the first organization in the State to concentrate itsefforts on the creation of a State Highway Department and the building of aState-wide system of highways. It hasseen the movement for good roads inKentucky grow from a few voices crying in the wilderness into as good asystem of highway administration as isenjoyed by any of the States.Naturally, together with all otherKentuckians, its membership has beenmuch concerned recently by the repeated reports made to the public and thepress that the whole system is "goingto pot" for lack of funds and thatthe only thing that will save it willbe an extra session of the Legislatureto submit to a vote of the people abond issue estimated at anywhere from$20,000,000 to $60,000,000.Investigation made by Robert J.

America has successfully maintained her leadership in thenavigation of the air, so far as heavierthan air craft are concerned, despitethe lack of aerial laws, landing fieldsand other such handicaps, accordingto a review of the year 1920, issuedby the Manufacturers' Aircraft association. The review says:"Decreased production and a general contraction in the aeronauticalindustry generally is offset by themore encouraging records of performance made in American aviation thisyear. While the last twelve monthshave not brought the carefully outlined policy of federal jurisdiction required to assure steady and economicalprogress in commercial aviation, theyhave witnessed many remarkableachievements by American pilots InAmerican machines."Year's Performances.Then follows a long, detailed listof performances, among them the following :"Commander A. C. Read, hero ofthe transatlantic flight in the NC-4,commanded the same flying boat on anoteworthy expedition from Rockaway, L. I., down the Atlantic coast,along the gulf coast and up the Mississippi river to Cairo, 111. When the JNC-4 returned to Rockaway January27 last it had flown 7,740 nauticalmiles. Three of the four PackardLiberty engines had operated withouttrouble during the 118 hours in theair, the fourth more than eighty-twohours. Along the Mississippi themotors were run on commercial gasoline picked up from point to point enroute. Read reported that the greatest difficulty encountered was lack ofproper maps."Compared to long-flight attemptsconducted by European governmentsthe American ventures were particularly successful. No less than fourexpeditions attempted to fly the 5.20Gmiles from Cairo to Capetown, SouthAfrica. Colonel Pk Van Ryndveldand Major C. J. O. Brand finally com-1pleted their flight on March 20, 1920,in a DH-9 plane sent up by the government of the Union of South Africaafter their Vickers-Vlmy machine hadcrashed. They had et out from CairoFebruary 10. None of' the machinesthat started reached Capetown."Different success attended theAlaskan flying expedition of the United States Army Air service. FourGallaudet remodelled DH-4-B planes,each powered .with a single Libertymotor, and each carrying two persons flew from Mitehel Field, L. I., toNome, Alaska, and return in 112 hoursflying time, a total distance of 9,000miles, without a motor missing fire orother accident serious enough to delay the party. Rain and fog causedmost of 'the difficulty in flying, overcountry not even charted on the maps.Operation of Air Mail Service."The Air Mail in 1920 operating between New York and Washington,New York, Cleveland, Chicago, Omaha,Salt Lake City and San Francisco,transported approximately one hundred million letters at ordinary postage rates. The system was extendedin 1920 from Chicago to San Francisco, from Key West, Fla., to Havana,Cuba, and from Seattle, Wash., to Victoria, B. C. About thirty-five air mailplanes are in the air each day flyinga total, in round trips, of about 8,000miles."During the year the navy has beenmaking an aerial survey of the Panama Canal zone."The geological survey has cooperated with the marine corps in mappingthe coastline of Haytl. American seaplanes, Curtiss, Aeromarine and Boeing types, have operated on passengerroutes in China."Major R. W. Schroeder, flyings anAmerican designed and built PackardLepero biplane, went up from McCookField, Dayton, Ohio, on February 26,and reached the world's 'record altitude of 33,000 feet."EXECUTE 4 FOR FLOUR THEFTSPolish Soldiers Found Guilty of Stealing Nine Sacks From ArmyAre Shot.Cracow, Poland.

Six thousand Greekrefugees at Batum, Transcaucasia,their clothing worn to shreds, are "living like wild animals in dens" anddying at the rate of from thirty-fiveto fifty a day, writes Dr. W. E. Rambo, a Near East Relief worker of WestPhiladelphia, Pa., in a report from theBlack sea port received here.Jn.what he calls "a tragic exodusthat bids to become historic," Dr. Rambo says the Greek government alreadyhas repatriated 20,000 who emigratedfrom the Near East to colonize Thraceand that from 10,000 to 12,000 remainto be transported from Batum backto their homeland.Most of these, he says, are physically strong, but the 6,000 r&ugess fromother regions who flocked to Batumin (he expectation of relief have beenin that city five months, waiting invain for help, their condition dailybecoming more desperate on accountof the rigors of the present Georgianwinter.The Greek government, Dr. Ramboexplains, disclaiming responsibility forthe plight of the people, has undertaken, through humane considerationsonly, to feed and doctor the refugees,but, so far, has declined to transportthem to Greece, on the ground thatthere is insufficient housing there toshelter them."Meanwhile," the letter says, "theG.000 are overcrowded In barracks unfit for human habitation.

Various reports from government sources, however, indicatethat there will be coal for a whilelonger, and that the people need notbe alarmed over the situation. As amatter of fact, anx inspector of theUnited States bureau of mines recently investigated the coal resources ofUtah and found there two mines ofbituminous coal in beds of such greatthickness that their exhaustibility wasconsidered to be hardly" within therange of calculation, says ChristianScience Monitor. He declared thesebeds the thickest of the kind in thecountry. It seems reasonable to expect that coal will be utilized for heatand power for many years to come.the conservation measures to insureagainst waste and to bring about alarger development of hydro-electricpower are likely to lessen the demandsupon the coal mines.Forty protesting Englishmen arecredited with the intention of sailingfrom England in quest of an islandhome in the South seas, where they.can be free from fiscal oppression.Most of them are said to be club men,while the schooner of these politicalpilgrims will sail the Spanish Mainrigged up with all the comforts ofa club on Piccadilly.

If the city has not thepower to protect the streets againstthis misuse and abuse, it must getthat power.

It is a ridiculous absurdity that the people of the cityshould vote bond issues and shouldtax themselves generously to buildnew streets and. to repair old ones,and to have those streets destroyedalmost as rapidly as they arc built.oThe turning over of a new leaf isthe symbol of a fresh start and a&Save 40 and 50On Your Shoes!Entire Stock Shoes, Rubbers and OxfordsNow on sale at sweeping reductions regardless of cost orvalues.
