djw FTEE suffering for nearly thirty years
r from dyspepsia Mrs II E Dugdale
wife of a prominent business man of
Warsaw N Y writes For 23 years I was
a constant sufferer from dyspepsia and a
sreak stomach The lightest food produced
distress causing severe pain and the forma
tion of gas No matter how careful of my
Iiet I suffered agonizing pain after eating
I was treated by many physicians and tried
numerous remedies without permanent help
Two years ago I began taking Dr Miles
Nerve and Liver Pill3 and Nervine Within
a week I commenced improving and per
sisting in the treatment I was soon able to
eat what I liked with no evil effects
I keep them at hand and a single doso dispels
my old symptoms
