The horrors of theChickarnauga hospitals grow GenBreckinridge will probably insist upona congressional investigation whichwill reveal one of the greatest scandals in the history of the armyWhen an official investigation shallhave been made of the causes leadingup to the sickness and death of somany soldiers of the volunteer armyat Chickamauga park it will reveal adecree of negligence and ignorance onthe part of officers and surgeons thatis hardly to be credited as having occurred in the United States of Americaduring the close of the nineteenth centuryMen with raging fevers were sent tothese places and compelled in manycases to lie on the ground on blanketswhile the rain beat in through thepoorly protected tentsThere were few surgeons and fewernurses and the poor fellow who became sick was in the main left to hisown care with an occasional visitfrom the surgeon There was littleice to be had and ice baths were ofrare occurrenceIn one division hospital for severalweeks there were only two temperature thermometers The sick were allowed to lie r unprotected tents forhours until physicians could have anopportunity to examine them and decide whether they ought to be admitted to hospitals or not and in somecases men with fever were compelledto wait for 24 hours after giving upas they called it and they were always kept going as long as they couldbefore receiving attentionThe surgeons themselves state thattheir supplies were inadequate theaccomodations illy equipped thenurses and attendants few and inexperienced and as one surgeon saidIt is a wonder that every fever patient did not dieIt is stated that the department didnot know of the situation for sometime Surgeon General Sternbergsorder as to sanitation had been grossly ignored and requisitions for medical supplies were sent to his department with snail like rapidityMen suffered and died for lack ofmedicines and proper attention Thewhole system seems to have been totally wrong and inhuman and as a result the people of the country are simply appalled at the revelations madeand when the whole truth is knownin all the sickening details the publicwill wonder that the soldiers at Chickamauga park have been able to escapeas well as they haveGeorge A Echle member of Company L 9th Pennsylvania says thathis command has been shamefullv nejrlected that the sick have not beensupplied Avith ice but have been allowed to almost famish in the hot sunThe men have received wines brandiespillow cases and such things from relatives and friends at home but theywould gladly have given them all foran adequate supply of iceEchle says that a sink has existed inthe camp of his command close up tothe mess tent and that flies and insects from this reeking mass of filthand putrefication would alight in thefood as the men were eatingAbout a week or two ago a privatein the Gth Ohio an estimable and reliable man wrenched his knee in townand split the bone He was picked upby a wagon laden with hospital supplies in charge of a surgeon Thelatter knew the private was inpain and badly crippled yet he nevervouchsafed a word of inquiry or offered to render him the least assistance The wagon was driven to itsdestination in an open field The injured man was ordered out and leftseveral miles away from his camp inan open field whence in great suffering hefouad his way to his regimentIt appears that some of the medicalofficers in the interest of science ofsurgery are cutting up bodies of soldiers or rather holding summary autopsies without the consent of the relatives of the dead men and over theprotests of their friendsA few da3s ago the body of a soldierwho died of meningitis was taken into Chattanooga When the body wasuncovered it was found that the mansskull had been lifted and that hisbrain had been taken out and replacedwith a handful of hay His intestinesbad also been removed and the stomach filled with hay This autopsy wasperformed without the consent of themans peoplePeace

forthe present sickness and death amongthe soldierslAs you doubtless know I was opposed to Aie war nrosrramme Buthaving begun the war we should haveconducted it in such a way as to haveprotected our own soldiersMr Sherman said that the presidentwas not resposible for neglect or misconduct on the part of subordinatesin the departments The presidenthe said had been diligent active andpatriotic in the conduct of the warand he felt confident that had congress withheld its harsh declarationthe president and the state department would have secured by negotiations with Spain the substantial independence of CubaWhen asked as to the course thatshould be pursued in order to get atthe truth Mr Sherman said -Thepresident has power to order an investigation which can be conductedby a board of inquiry to be appointedby him Such a board would not haveexecutive powers and its findingswould have a moral rather than ajudicial influence If the board foundthat American soldiers had needlessly

everlastingdisgrace in case of conviction In thatcase the president would beheld equally responsible with the secretary fornot having ordered an inquiry promptly upon the presentation of charges ofso

OtherNations May Follow Views ofSoine European PapersLondon 29 The czars proposition for an international conferencefor the purpose of securing- real andlasting- peace among- the powers andthe termination of the progressive increase in armanents as conveyedin a note from Count Muravioffthe Russian foreign ministerto the foreign diplomats atSt Petersburg- is likely to produce asensation throughout Europe andcoming- from such a quarter and withsuch evident sincerity of purpose itis likely to have important effectsThere is no doubt that with Russiataking the lead in such a step Germany France and the other nationswill be ready to followRome Aug 29 The czars note hasmade a profound impression hereSome of the newspapers applaud whileothers greet the communication withreserve or distrustLondon Aug 29 The Daily GraphicMonday morning- referring- to the proposal of Emperor Nicholas saysIt would be idle to attempt to ignore the many and grave difficultiesstanding in the way of the attainmentof the czars wishes but it can not bepossible to doubt the sincerity of themagnanimous proposalThe Standard says speaking- editorially of the czars proposalIn England at least respect andsympathy will be felt for the proposalIt is a conception well worthy of theyoung- sovereign It is painfully obvious that there are enormous difficulties to be overcome which it is possible the czar in his ardor and humane enthusiasm has not maturely consideredIt is a vision which has occurred tomany minds but has always had to bedismissed as a mere dream The nations are not likely to cast away thesword unless they have a better warrant than paper protocols and conventions Moreover the moment does notseem altogether propitious JNewarmed nations are arising in Asia andAmerica whom it might not be easyto convince of the safety and desirability of abandoning the enterprise onwhich they have embarked with soimuch energyEnumerating- the many obstacles to4he attainment of the obiect

wouldbe perceptibly nearerRSme 29 The belief here isthat the czar first obtained Austrianand German assent to the conferenceThe papers admit the extraordinaryimportance of the document and paytribute to the humanitarian motivesThe Tribuna thinks Germany andItaly will consent but France willdisapprove of her allys actionParis 29 The Figaro believesthat the conference will assemble be-cause the czar would not have risked arefusal It believes however that theaspiration is chimericalThe Gaulois thinks the proposal anatural one from Russia because theimmense armament imposed upon heris the principal obstacle to her development The Gaulois saysLFrance would not gain whatand the other powers would bydisarmament Universal peace hasbeen often proposed but never realizedLe Journal thinks the-

unhesitatingly recommendthat work be suspended and the mineshut down pending a complete reorganization of the force The morale ofthe men is what might be looked for asthe result of inefficiency wasteful extravagance and corruption in the officers I should recommend the discharge of every man on the pay rollsbeginning with the manager and excepting the doctor At present themine is run in the

Civil War In recounting hisexperience to a reporter Mr Dunn saidAbout a year and a half ago I began tohave trouble with my stomach My suffering was so intense that I tried different medicines and doctored with several physiciansbut without permanent reliefA Wounded SoldierI read anaccount ofDr Williams PinkPills for PalePeople having cured acase muchlike mineand I decided to givethem a trialwhich I didAftertaking fiveboxes I wascured Inever feltbetter thanI do now even in my younger days I amnaturally a robust man but that stomachtrouble together with rheumatism whichafterward set in were making fast inroadsupon my health and I am satisfied that itwould have been but a short time before mycomrades would have been conducting theregulation funeral ceremonies over my remains had I not chanced to read of andtaken Dr Williams Pink PillsThere are several others in the home whoare taking thesepills and are receiving greatbenefit RICHARD DUNNSubscribed and sworn to before me this1st day of Nov 1897HENRY GIBSON Notary PublicSergeant Dunn is perfectly willing thatanyone should write him in reference to hiscase provided stamp is enclosed for replyAll the elements necessary to give newlife and richness to the blood and restoreshattered nerves are contained in a condensed form in Dr Williams Pink PillsThey are also a specific for troubles peculiarto females such as suppressions irregularities and all forms of weakness In men theycure cases nrising from mental worry overwork or excesses of whatever natureTHE CAPTAINS SPEECHIt Was Interestingly Brief and Decidedly to the Point Hut Unsatisfactory to the OratorOne of the volunteer companies recentlyat Camp Alger possesses a beautiful newflag which was made and presented by anumber of patriotic women m the Pennsylvania town from which the company comesIt was presented just before the companymarched away or steamed away to be accurateand the presentation was the occasion of much ceremony The company wasdrawn up in a long line company front1 believe is the nuutary term lor it and avery charming young lady read a verycharming and somewhat lengthy addresswhich contained a great deal of flowery language The captain was it then and hadto reply lie is not an eloquent man at anytime and he is extremely shy but he hadwritten out a graceful speech of acceptance and he stepped forward confidentlyand received the bannerLadies he began in a Fourth of Julyvoice Ladies we will accept this flag Ladies we we will accept this flag Herehis color forsook him He had forgotten thebest of his speech One trembling handsought the pocket of his blouse The manuscript was goneLadies he began acrairi desnemtplvwith a gulping kind of gasp Ladies wewin accept tins ljagana ana and thanksawfully for it dont you knowAnd after all I dare say the impromptuwas quite as effective as the address hehad prepared but the captain doesnt liketo talk about it Washington PostA shbwcr is distressing to wlieelmen butthe man with a horse ought
