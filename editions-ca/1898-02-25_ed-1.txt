the recommendations ofCapt Sampson of the court of inquiryas to the raising of the wreck Theview of naval officers was that CaptSampson and his associates were giving this advice not as a court but asofficers in a position to speak as to thebest methods to be adopted for wrecking the Maine Various interpretations were put on the expression forward half completely destroyedThis was regarded as a partial confirmation of the theory that the forward magazine had exploded as thatis one of the most important portionsforward half of the ship Atine same xime xx was neia Dy somenaval authorities that the destructionof the forward half of the ship did notnecessarily mean that the forwardmagazine had exploded as this mightbe still intact although a part of thegeneral wreckageHavana Feb 24 via Key Westblow up the Maine if such a plot existed but they believe the junior Spanish officers who from the nature ofthings are more conversant with modern explosives than their elders andsuperiors were at the bottom of thedisaster if there were anv outsideagencyIt is pointed out that it would notbe impossible to plant a mine of wetand dry gun cotton near where a foreign war vessel was directed to anchorsuch a mine communicating with anelectric battery on shore It is regarded as an interesting point thatthe Maine for the first time duringher stay in the haibor lay at the particular spot where she was at the timeof the catastrophe and it is saidthough not officially voiced that theMaine was the first foreign war vesselmoored to this particular buoy sincethe troubles in Cuba grew acuteAll stories as to lax discipline on theMaine are without a shadow of truthOn the contrary Capt Sigsbee wascomplained of by some for the rigidityof his rules and the strictness withwhich he enforced them Moreoverthe Maine has been in commission foryears and never had a serious accident until anchored in this quiet harborIn reply to a question put by thiscorrespondent to a high American official as to what the outcome would beif it were proved that the disaster wasdue to an outside agency the official inquestion saidSir the American people could notbe restrained I mean war Still Idoubt whether it would be necessaryto fire a shot Adm Sicard couldanchor the Iowa the Indiana the Massachusetts and the New Yortk outsideHavana harbor to prevent the ingressof the food supplies without whichthe city could not exist a fortnightCuba is a waste of ashes and desolation Even the hotels and cafes herein Havana live from hand to mouth onsupplies brought from the UnitedStates -If Adm Sicarddemanded the surrender of Havana giving 24 hours forthe removal of the women and children surrender would follow Theforts are old structures and could bedemolished by a six Suchnew guns as have been mounted

Lippincott CoMWmhWtKmtKWmmwmmiCHAPTER IV ContinuedThe president was writing- when Ientered but he laid aside his pen whenhe saw meTake a seat Conway he saidI did as requested My heart washeavy before but it was heavier whenI noticed the troubled look on his faceAir Perry have you read the papers I askedThe president nodded assentHow is it that such a general impression has gone abroad that I hadsomething to do with the affair Whohas started such a rumorI do not know Conway unless thepolice have given public expression totheir opinionThe police And what is their opinion Was it not shown beyond anydoubt that I was miles away from thevault at the time that the robbery mustmust have been committed I say nothing-about my own assertions But howcan anyone doubt the word of a manof Mr Morle3rs standingWell Conway no one does doubtthat you told the truth in that ButMr Perry seemed loath to proceedBut what sir I demanded aftera pauseThe detectives theory is that youhad accomplices who from directionsgiven by you were able to carry out aprearranged planI answered with a scornful laughAccomplices Who are they IaskedWell I suppose they are looking forthem Mr Perry said with a halfsmileI hope theyll enjoy the search Isaid sarcastically Oh Mr Perry whyis this thing brought upon me Whyam I so universally suspected whennothing- can be shown against me Ifthere is enough cause to attribute therobbery to me why am I not arrestedWe had hoped to keep the affair a secret for a time at least Thereforesoine few of the trustees thought itbest not to make it public as having3rou arrested would have done We wereall pledged to secrecy but somehow theaffair got abroad I suppose you didnot mention itNo indeed I have not spoken to asoul on the subject I replied Ml-Perry I cried impulsively you do notbelieve I am guilty do youI do not wish to believe so he replied guardedlyOh think sir what this terrible affair means to me It is a fearful burden for a young fellow to bear who iswholly innocentIt is indeed But you see it is thisway The bank is a public institutionand I as its head dare not let my personal feelings interfere with my dutyto the public Personally it does notseem possible that you could have anycoxxnection with the loss of the peoplesmoneyOh thank you Mr Perry I knewyou could not thinkHe cut me short Officially I musthold you in doubt so much so at leastthat I cannot give you back your positionAnd did jrou suppose I expected toremain I asked indignantly I couldnot I want to hold no position whereabsolute and perfect confidence is notfelt in me You can consider this as myresignation sir I addedI am glad you look upon it in thatlight It is manly sir said Mr PerryAnd Nelson not even the restorationof the missing funds would give me asgreat pleasure as the establishment ofyour innocenceNever fear sir my innocence willsoon be proved It cannot be otherwisefor I am innocent I said confidentlyI have a small estate which came tome from my grandfather I continuedEvery cent shall be expended if necessary for the purpose of proving myinnocenceYou can do as you see fit about thatthe president said after a long pauseduring which he seemed to be pondering over my words But if you wishfor my advice I would say do nothingwhatever on your own hook Nelsonhe continued coming close up to me andspeaking low secret measures have already been begun to solve the mysteryand they will be thorough and farreaching This is wholly independentof any investigations the police authorities may undertake You see myboji that I do trust and believe in youliter all What I have told you ia instrict confidence Live as quietly andpatiently as possible under the cloudTake a trip to Europe and enjoy yourselfNo Ill stay and face the music Iam not afraid of anyconsidering his answerMy daughter is rather indignantshe thinks that you are unjustlytreated he finally saidI could not restrain myself on hearing this I sprang from my seat andapproached himMr Morley you do not know whatit means to me to hear this You cannotimagine how your daughters opinionfills me with hope May I ask you sirto express to her my deepest gratitudefor her faith in my innocence As Tiodbears me her faith is not misplacedThere was no controlling my voice ittrembled in spite of my efforts to becalm Dear true hearted girlI will convey to her your messagesaid Mr Morley She has informed meof the sentiment you entertain for herBut Mr Conway I believe you are ayoung man of sense and honor Youmust therefore realize the position youwould place her in by insisting on thecontinuation of a friendship which outof kindness and gentleness of disposition she would probably not refuse youTHE BOURBON NEWS PRIDinvestigationswhich may be made into my lifev ell good by now I must not allowyou to take up any more of my time 1beg of you to follow my advice and undertake no search on your- own hookIn spite of discouragement heartacheor long delay do nothing yourselfHe shook my hand heartily and I lefthimAs I was going out the door leadinginto the lobby I ran against a man justcoming in He was an old fellow smalland thin and had piercing steel blueeyes He rebounded a trifle from thecollision then gazed at me sharplyI beg your pardon I said I hopeI did not hurt youNo Not much at any rate I wantto see the president Are you the president he askedThere seemed to me to be somethinginsoleDt about his question as thoughhe knew I was not the president and hehad asked but to mock meYou will find the president in his office I replied curtly As for me Iam a bank robberThere was the suspicion of a twinklecame in his eyes as he said IndeedWell you dont look itThe old fellow then entered the office and I went outside to the streetA few days went by and althoughnothing was found to sustain the theoryof the detectives that fact did not lessenI the general suspicion which rested uponmeIndeed it was a case of surprise to methat I was not arrested It woujd havebeen an easy matter for I had nothought of hiding The most publicstreets during the daytime and a concert or the theater at night were frequented by me I held my head erectas I had a right to do but it was with aheavy heart and a chastened spirit thatI realized that people shunned meHouses where I had been on most friendly terms were closed against meI was tempted many times to seekconsolation and encouragement in thepresence of Florence Morley but it didnot seem right nor kind to burden herbright life with my troubles evenshould she consent to see me of whichI was doubtful under the changed circumstances Perhaps it was this fearwhich kept me away as much as anyother ideaAbout a week after the robbery a letter came to my boarding placeMr Nelson Conway Dear Sir If convenient kindly favor me with an opportunity for conversation this evening ateight I remain in town over night and youwill find me at my city residenceSYLVESTER MORLEYWondering what he could wish to sayto me I repaired to his house at thetime mentionedMr Morley received me in the libraryand arose from his chair as I enteredGood evening Mr Conway hegravely said bowing his head Pleasebe seatedAfter I had chosen a chair on the opposite side of the room and he had resumed his seat he began somewhat reluctantly but in his stately courteouswayOur conversation may prove unsatisfactory to you If so I beg your pardon in advance Of course you areaware that the public in general connects your name wth that daring andmysterious affair at the bankI know very well sir that it is soI replied sadlyNow I do not mind saying that I donot necessarily condemn a man becausehe is suspected Mr Morley continuedIn a case like yours the general publics opinion does not influence my opinion At the same time the generalpublic is not to be blamed so muchafter all The people form their opinions from the newspapers and I amsorry to note that the papers do notseem friendly toward youThat is true sir I answered AndI cannot imagine why they should takethat stand when nothing absolutelynothing can be found to criminate meI can furnish no idea why it is so1 simply state a fact As I intimated itis not my custom to condemn a manbefore he has been found guilt Butwhatever my private opinion may be inthis case you must understand that thesuspicion which has fallen upon youwill necessarily preclude a continuation of the friendly relations which haveexisted between you and and myhouseholdOh sir you cannot believe in yourheart that I had anything to do withthe banks loss I exclaimed bitterlyfor kindly as was his manner thewords he spoke seemed to strike a knellto my fondest hopesI have already said all I care to sayon that score Mr Morley repliedrather coldlyAnd and your daughter sir Iwent on with trembling voice shedoes not share the general suspicionA smile flitted across his face for amoment Then he became grave againand regarded me earnestly He did notreply for some time he seemed to beIt would be unjust to her embarrassingto you and wholly contrary to mywishesI fully appreciate the meaning ofyour words Mr Morley Believe me Iregard your daughter too highly tointrude upon her notice under existingcircumstances It is no sentiment Ientertain for her it is love sir deepertruer fonder than mere sentimentThis love has become the ruling motiveof my life and will always remain soBut I promise you I will hold no communication with your daughter untilit is shown before the world that I aminnocent I confess to follow thiscourse will be the greatest sacrifice ofmy life I have no parents no near relations to whom I can go for love andsympathy It means something therefore for me to promise you thisMr Morlev arose from his chairThere was a kindly gleam in his eyesand an expression on his face of sadness was it At any rate there wasundoubtedly a touch of sorrow in hisvoice when he spoke again It seemedsomewhat strange to me at the timeHe had obtained the promise he wishedbut it did not seem to give him the pleasure I naturally expected it wouldHe extended his hand Mr Conwayyou are a man of honor he said Ideem it a favor to shake hands withyou I sincerely hope your innocencemay be established But he hesitated here do not be over sanguineBobberies have occurred before whichhave ever remained mysteries I mustconfess although I am one of thetrustees and am therefore an interestedparty I am not so sure the perpetratorsof this last robbery will ever be discovered There seems to be not theslightest clew to work on I do notsay this to cause you pain but simplyto warn you against entertaining hopeswhich may never be realizedCHAPTER VOn the first evening of my occupancyof the old homestead I recalled MrMorleys words and thought with sorrow how much superior his judgmenthad been to mineA year had gone by a year of heartache disappointment and unfulfilledlonging and the cloud had not beenlifted from my life And oh I was sohomesick for just a glimpse of my dearloves faceA few days after my interview withMr Morley I had received a note fromFlorenceDear Mr Conway Father has informedme of your resolve not to call on me or attempt to keep up the friendship which mademe so happy until you are freed from allsuspicion I appreciate the manlinesswhich prompts you to such a resolve andI wish to assure you from the bottom of myheart that I respect and trust you I knowyou are innocent and shall always believeso Keep up a brave spirit The mysterywill be explained and you exonerated Remember I believe in you wholly and shallalways remain Your true friendFLORENCE MORLEYI took the worn note from the locketwhich I wore around my neck andfillSpeak out I say or m Arepressed it to my lips as I had donemany times since its receipt and I wondered if her heart was still true to thesentiment expressed in itThe harvest moon was resplendentand the white beams came into the window where I sat in my night robe flooding my white drapery with light Therewere no bounds of human life theworld seemed left wholly to the crickets and katydids With a sigh fromthe depths of my lonely heart I replaced the note in its receptacle andaroseTurning from the window I sawright opposite me on the other sideof the room a tall white figure Whatwas it There it stood while I gazedspellbound motionless mysterious Ina lightning flash of thought Sarahsforebodings came to meThen I grasped my pistol which waslying on the table beside meNow then if this is a practical jokeintended simply to frighten mc letit stop I said It was with some difficulty I confess that my voice waskept steadyWhoever you are speak and explain or Ill see if you have substanceenough to stop a bulletI paused for a reply but none cameSpeak out I say or as sure as thereis a God in Heaven Ill fire I calledagain and again received no replyThe white thing remained there inspite of my threats After anotherpause during which the cold chillschased up and down my spine I raisedmy arm took deliberate aim and firedA rattle of breaking glass followedthe report of the pistol and a darkspot appeared in the center of thewhite figure The flash of the pistolhad been reflected back and in an instant I realized the truthWith a scornful laugh and a condemnatory exclamation at my foolishness I placed the pistol on the tableand got into bedThen a slight scuffling noise seeming to come from beneath reached myear and I said aloud and with a laughIve stirred up the rats at any rateHello whats that I exclaimed as adeep muffled sound accompanied by aslight jar immediately followed Itwas as though a heavy door in sometEBEUARY 25 1898disiantfnart of the house ha slaiamedTor quite a time I sat tp in bed andlistenedbut no more Tmunual soundsfollowedMrs Snyders words concerning mysterious happenings in my house andSarahs unreasonable fears for my safety followed by the two events just mentioned did have an effect upon me although the first event was due whollyto an ordinary cause and the secondthe apparent sound of a slamming doormight be and probably was just whatit seemed A gentle night breeze hadarisen and some of the windows in theupper part of the house might havebeen left open thereby producinga draught and causing an interveningdoor to swing shut True the soundseemed to come from beneath me Butthen that was probably imaginationIn the silence of night a sudden noiseis rather difficult to locate How oftenthe most common events under unfamiliar circumstances become inexplicable mysteriesI am not of a superstitious make upand therefore Sarahs vague fears didnot produce in me a feeling of frightbut there was a watchfulness about mysenses as though there were funnythings to use Sarahs term about thehouse which would become apparentin due timeNestling my head down on the pillow redolent with the grateful healthgiving aroma of spruce I closed myeyesSleep did not come as quickly as I hadboasted to my old nurse it would andit was some time before my consciousness began to wander into the domainof vague fancies and indistinct ideaswhich characterize the period betweenwaking and sleepingThen almost before my eyes couldopen I suddenly sat up in bed andlistened with hearing sharpened by thesense of i expectancy which had comeover meOut through the silence of my roomthere came stealing the sound of a voicebut such a voice Not possessed byany human being surely Pitched ona high quavering tone and yet so softand small so faint as though bornefrom l great distance so plain asthough right at my bedside bearing nosemblance to human tones but nevertheless undoubtedly a voice for aftera time I could distinguish a word nowand thenJf there were in the world weird misshapen little folks like fairies andgnomes and we could hear their conversation I imagine their voices wouldsound like this one to which now I waslisteningThere was no wonder Mrs Snyderhad been impressed by it if this werethe voice she had heardStrange indeed and unnatural asthough not of this waild it seemed tome A creeping sensation came overme not exactly like that produced byfear there was more of awe of solemnity about itLTO BE CONTINUESNOVEL LADDERIt Was

postpone as long as possible the crisis which is almost certainto be precipitated by the report of theboard of inquiry commissioned toinvestigate the destruction of thebattleship Maine In the inner circles of the administration it is no longer pretended that the Maine was blownup by accident Good authority isgiven for the assertion that Mr McKinley has had in his possession forthree days positive evidence showingthat the Maine was destroyed by external agenciesThe Spanisn authorities are awareof the fact that the president has thisevidence in his possession and theyhave sent messages which have beenkept from the public disavowingall responsibility for the act andoffering to make humble apology aswell as monetary compensation forthe damage inflicted and in short todo anything which may be done honorably to prevent war between Spainand the United StatesThe evidence in the presidentshands fails to disclose the identity ofthe men who are responsible forthe awfnl crime At least

answered Of courseits a wonderful thing which he givesout as truth but a man of ProfSchencks standing is entitled to tilaimalmost anything and then to fool lis allby proving itWeil said the other who was a company captain and not in the medicalcorps I can only look upon it as preposterous Its interesting you know rarely interesting Its as good a story as thatof Orpheus and the rocks and treesnnd things which he called to him byhis playing Yes and to my mindtheres just about as much fact in itThe major leaned back in his chairand the lamplight of the clubroomfalling upon his golden oak leaves andupon his calm thought concealing faceilluminated the last traces of a smallsmile which flitted across and was goneThe Orpheus busiuess isnt impossible either Kennedy he said Oh Iam not poking fun old man Im serious about it Indeed I am Ive always had a wholesome respect for theyarn about those animated rocks thatis always since the incident of Wheeler and of the private who killed himAnd by the same token right there iHa case of pre natal influence that mightfit in with our talkCapt Kennedy debated no furtherHe was a philosopher in his way and heresolved that he would rather hear astory than triumph as a logician Theother officers joined him in asking themajor to go right ahead witli his illustrationI was stationed down in well letslet names and dates go he beganAnyhow it was years ago and it wasfar enough away to be beyond all present reach A wild country not mountainous so much as desert and volcanicGreat cinders of rocks burned under asun which was in business all the timev and the uplands were rough jaggedand untravelable like juniior Himalayasmade of coke Still all this has nothingto do with the story It only comesback to me now because I rememberwhat a time of it we had finding anylh ing fit to be made into a respectablecemeterj when we buried Lieut Wheeler who as Esaid had been killed by oneof his own men a fellow named SouljiItalian maybe Austrian Spaniardsomething out of the common run ofcity enlisted menIt was Soulji who acted under the prenatal influence The first time I noticedThis was on a day when one of his companions had Jieen kicked by a horseand nearly killed The victim was carried to the post hospital a meager sortof institution as you can imagineand Soulji was detailed to go to myquarters and notify me He came hurrying over to my house and was aboutto turn up the steps when m3 nine-year-oldboy who was sitting on thestoop with a mouth organ for company started some kind of tune Hecouldnt play with any skill or art butassoon as Soulji heard the first note hetook off his cap and stood like a statuelistening The boy kept on playingand at last the attention of somebodyin the house was called to the soldierHe was a statue I tell you just a perfect statue immovable rapt attentiveAn hour or so afterward I went to thewindow and saw he was still therelistening listening listening while theboy quavered nnd exploded up and downthe instrumentAs I viewed him this la3t time a sergeant came hurrying up to the housea lid seeing Soulji spoke as it seemedto me from his actions rebukinglySoulji struck him and was arrestedHis guardhouse term was I imaginefor the combination offense of strikingthe sergeant and of failiug to deliverthe sick call to me Others in the postwondered at the mans conduct but asI thought it over it seemed to me thatperhaps there was something more thanmere inattention and insubordinationin his having given himself so entirelyto the boys mouth organ music and Ijiuestioned himMle wouldnt talk about it tit firstimt after awilile he told me As I hadhalf suspected music was a pulsionyes more than that a life principlewTith him Music of any kind overpowered him enslaved him Hecouldnt resist it Every sense but thatof hearing- left himwhenjpTHE BOUJRBON NEi PHIDAY FEBRUARY 25 1898a cornetsounded The bugle calls thrilled andand mastered him And the oddest partof it all was thai he couldnt play anykind of an instrument Kot oneCouldnt even whistle a tune Thewhole thing was purely objective tohim Then as well as he could he explained it to me but I deduced most ofthe story His mother had been marriedto a musician who was destined to become famous Everybody had said soall predicted great fame for him Buthe died before the boy was born andthe mother determining that the greatness which the father missed shouldcome to the son gave her whole soul tothe task of forming his nature after thefashion of what the dead man had hopedto be She went crazy on the subjectand the child was born in a madhouseHe grew receptively musical inordinately so but he hadnt the slightesttrace of the creative powerHe told me that my boys mouthorgan haddriven all thought of his hospital errand out of his mind and whenthe sergeant came and interrupted hisdevotions he wanted to kill himWell thats really what happenedlater The band was at practice oneright and Soulji as usual was listeningLieut Wheeler coming along calledthe man to him no one knows for whatpurpose He refused to hear his supeiior and Wheeler walked over to himand spoke to him again rather sharplyI imagine Soulji turned on him andbeat him to death When the guardfound him the officer had just strengthenough to name his murderer and diedThe man hunt which was carried orduring all that night the next day andthe following night was a thing longtcbe remembered I might say that theordinary discipline and routine of thegarrison was abandoned for the timeand all hands were out in the searchThe soldiers did not like Soulji on account of his mysterious and uncannyways while Wheeler was a beloved officer The utter lack of reason for themurder was another infuriating thingSo very very much like a mob the command spread over the country and intathe coke built mountains and the oldvolcanoes and water holes and searchedfor the missing man It was all in vainhowever The morning of the secondcame and we had to acknowledgethat he had got across the line tcthe south So the chase was discontinued and the command was set inreadiness for giving Wheeler a soldiersfuneral We sought out as favorable aspot as we could a sort of sentinel poinlabove a little scalding thread of ariver and there where the only patchof green in all the area we had traversed was to be found we dug hisgrave The command marched downfrom the post a matter I should sayof five miles It was too long a distanceSOULJI WALKED INTO THE MIDSTOF USin that oven of a country for the continued playing of the band so thecolonel directed the leader to holdbackuntil we got to the top of thft Jiill Hedid that and as we drew near to theplace of the burial the massive notesof Chopins funeral march reverberatedand echoed from the rocks and heightsI am not a musician and

great and vast the wOiidis and how small is a man and his iieand how little he has to expect now cthereafter there was a change from athat and a sweet softness rose and onscould almost see Hope coming up ou1of the desert to greet poor dead Wheber The band marched on to the opengrave and swung around still playingand at that very moment a face appeared above the overhanging promontory ledge and as we all stood surprised into utter inability to speak crmove a soldier form appeared andSoulji head high and eyes wide walkedinto the midst of usSoulji told me on the night beforehis execution four months later thrthV could have escaped but he had usoldiers knowledge of the burial serice of an officer and he wanted to lieatthe band play once more Lingering inan unknown cave just over the ledge

by Prof George Darwiifduring his recent visit to this country wasthat of the possible and probable increase in the length of the day IWhen once the earth is in imotionabout an axis no matter how the motion came about it would continue forever and at the same rate thus makingthe day always the same length unlesssomething is happening or will happento interfere with that motion Nowthere are several causes in operationwhich affect the period of the earthsrotation some of which tend to makethe period less and others to make itgreater Fortunately the influence ofeach of the causes is very small Theyare generally easy to understand anda simple experiment will illustrate oneof themTie a stone to one end of a string andholding the other in the hand whirlit around as nearly as maybe in the circumference of a cycle when its speedis nearly uniform allow the string towind up on the finger It will be noticed that as the string shortens theangular velocity increases In the sameway if the matter forming the earthshould in any way be drawn nearer theaxis of rotation it would turn fasterand the day would be shortenedBy continual loss of heat a shrinkageof the earth is probably in progressand although the process isslow it certainly tends to diminishthe period of rotation On the otherhand any addition of matter from theoutside will tend to increase that periodand make the day longer Undoubtedly slight additions to the mass of theearth are constantly made by the arrestof meteoric bodies passing through theatmosphere Their influence is opposedto and tends to neutralize that of anyearth shrinkage that may be going onThe most important interferencewith the rotation of the earth that weknow of is that of the tidal wave whichis due to the attraction of the sun andmoon but more largely to the latterIt is easy to see that this is a resistance against which the earth turnsand its effect is to increase the length ofthe dayAstronomical observations extendingover about 2000 j ears have failed toshow any sensible change in the daybut the influence of the tides must become evident after the lapse of a greatmany years Prof Darwin declares thatthe day may lengthen until it is at last50 times as long as it is at present andthat would also be the period of the revolution of the moon about the earthA day of 1320 hours such hours as wenow have would offer many interesting advantages but there would beRome thing about it not altogetheragreeable As it is not likely to comefor some millions of years it is not amatter of immediate anxiety YputhsCompanion VKLONDIKE FREIGHTCARSrJP rV Xnmc for Women and DogrsThatPack LoadsA young man who is in charge of aparty of gold seekers on the route tothe Klondike sends a full account byletter to a companion in Spokane ofthe means b3 which he has been transporting his supplies northward Oneof these means was a pack dog whichhas been denominated on account ofhis importance a Klondike freightcarHe is not a large dog says the letter-writerbut he will pack 75 poundsthrough the snow after the snowshoeshave made the trail Dogs that willpack 40 or 50 pounds are commonThe Indians at Madison Creek moveeverything with dogs

thejiosts are kettles to keep mice andsquirrels from getting at the fishAnother Klondike freight carwhich this expedition came across wasa klootchman or Indian woman whodid not weigh more than 125 poundsbut who would nevertheless carry abarrel of provisions weighing not lessthan 150 pounds nailed to a board andthe board strapped on her back Withthis burden she marched 30 miles between daylight

quite the proper thing to laughso loudly that she can hear youIt was a strong faced old man whogave expression to the above whilestanding on the corner of State andMadison streets one evening lately Hereferred to the great discomfiturewhich overcame a pretty little womanwho like most of her sex managed toget off a street car the wrong way Inalighting she turned her back on thestill moving train and as a result shewas left sprawling in the damp streetthe observed of hundreds of eyes Herlight colored dress was irretrievablyruined and her flying ribbons slappedand fluttered in the little puddles madeby the melting snowAnd her face It was clothed in ascrimson a color as a full blown hollvhock Pour or five men leaped to herassistance and in a jiffy had the littlewoman upon her feett But she did notthank them Not a word She just kepther eyes on the ground and with a wildand startled bound leaped for the sidewalk and in a moment disappearedwithin the capacious doors of one of thebazaars near by Then those bigbearded pirates who a moment beforewere all grace and tenderness in theirsolicitude began to roarNot exactly right to laugh continued the old man who had witnessedevery phase of the above incident butit can hardly be helped under the circumstances If women will persist ingetting off the cars contrary to the manner in which they should why theymust expect to take a tumble But evenwith one mistake if they would onlybe careful in the future it certainlydoes seem to me that they might avoidtheir very annoying acrobatic featsWell sir put in one of the men whohad assisted the little woman to herfeet the only reason I can figure outtheir persistence in jumping off cars inreverse is because they see newsboysand street car employes do it I haveseen one of these boys drop off a cargoing at full speed alight on one footand retain to perfection his equilibriumHow he manages to do it is past mycomprehension The momentum isjsnch that it would topple me over likethe proverbial load of apple sauceBut there are women who alightwith as much ease- and as gracefully asthe men said another These are theyounger women those of the athleticor new woman type They never askthe conductor to stop his car eithercoming or going but if you watch emyoull see that they jump manfashionIn my opinion I do not consider myselfat all ungallant These awkward worn-en should be laughed at It may teachthem better sense for the next jumpLet them wait until the cars slow upThats what they ought to do interposed the old man as he- turned toleave and if they dont do it theyought to tumble about the streets Itsnot the conductors fault though 1dont approve of his and the gripmansloud guffaws as they pull away fromthe floundering heap of ribbons-
