The funeral of Mrs. J. H. Col
lier, who died at Massie Memorial
Hospital, Paris, last Wednesday, was
conducted Friday at 2:00 p. m.,
from her late residence on North.
Main street, by her pastor, Rev. W.
W. Morton, of the Presbyterian
church. Mrs. Collier had been a
long sufferer. She bore her afflic
tions bravely and without murmur
ing. She was a devoted member of
the Presbyterian church sinceearfy
womanhood, and wasc a student pi
the Bible. On the mprnjng prior ,to
her death, which took place in tHe
afternoon, she realized the end "was
near, and talked beautifully to her
husband, children tnL grand chil
dren. She lived for .her family and
friends, in the assurance that when
the time came' for her to give up her
mortality for immortality, that the
Lord would claim her for his own.
There was never a more devoted
family. The four sons were thor
oughly devoted to their parents, and.
in the declining years of these good
old people, these sons have done
what they could to make life pleas-.'
ant for them. The sons were the'
pall-bearers. The song serVice was f
verv annronriate. and after the
'funeral service her remains were j
laid to rest Qn the family lot in the
Millersburg Cemetery, beside those
of her daughter-in-law, and a little
three-year-old grand-daughter.
