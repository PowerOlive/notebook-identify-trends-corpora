policythat will govern the task of taking thecensus of 1900 was outlined in an official statement made Saturday by Director Merriam and Assistant DirectorWines Director Merriam starts forMinnesota Saturday afternoon leavingAssistant Director Wines in chargeOn Gov Merriams return Dr Wineswill go home to settle his private affairs Meantime there will be no consideration of appointments and itwill be at least 30 daysyet before another selection oia staff officer is made with the probable exception of Prof Henry Gannettof this city as geographer This is inaccordance with a decision of the director Saturday that in his absencethere must be no promises of office norassurances nor encouragement for anygiven Several of the officials selectedThursday night have qualified and theactive preliminary work will begin atonce The statement of policy followsAs to prospective appointments tooffice the services of no more staff officers can be utilized at present andthere will be no others selected withincertainly 30 days Prof Henry -Gannettthe well known geographer of thegeological survey who was the politicaland statistical geographer of the lastcensus has been asked to take chargeof the same work for the coming censusand if the geological survey is willingto spare him sufficiently to undertakethis work he will be entrusted with itand given an absolutely free handUntil the schedules come back from theenumerators in July 1900 there will beno clerks wanted save such a smalltkeleton force as would be needed toLake care of the correspondence and office work preliminary to taking of the census When the schedulesDome back there will be a large forceof employes appointed All applications for office will receive consideration and a large number already havebeen received and placed on fileWhile the impression has gone abroadthat the census is to be a refuge for incompetency the truth and the actualfacts are that all applicants will besubjected to examination before appointment which will be as rigid as theexaminations before the civil serviceeommission No political influencewill be sufficient to put an emplo3e onthe census payrolls of whose competency to do the work to be assignedhim the director is not satisfied in advance Ana turtnermpre it any employe is found to be incompetent ontrial such employe will be dischargedregardless of his or her political backing The examinations of employes willDe directed not so much for the testing3f their general information andcapaety as it will be their fitness forthe work to be done as for exampleqo copyist who ean not write or spellsatisfactorily will be appointed norcalculators who can not calculateFirst of all after the general administrative officers are selected there mustbe 300 supervisors appointed and intheir selection consultation will be hadwith senators and representatives inthe respective states It may be announced also that senators and representatives who do not belong to therepublican party will receive thesame fair treatment and considerition along this line that is given republicansThis will be no small task Assuming the population of the United Statesat this time to be in round numbers80000000 people there must be 400000sheets issued for the population schedule alone Adding to these the otherschedules there will have to be in theaggregate not less than half a millionsnch

the last census will be adopted for that of 1900The office will have to selectfrom the various devices the onemost satisfactory and a sufficientnumber to do the work must thenbe manufactured The work will bepushed with all possible speed consistent with accurac3 and every effortmade to avoid dragging the work alongunnecessarily Taken all in all thecomplete uumber of appointments thatwill be made

Obstacle in the ay Is the Completion of the Rolls The Work IsBeing HastenedHavana March 11 The only obstacle now in the way of paying off theCuban troops is the completion jf therolls a work which is being hastenedby Inspector General Roloff He saysthat in some cases the rosters of thecommands must be created as the oldrosters are either missing or too defective to be useful He points out thatthe insurgents often have no paperpens or inkGen Gomez explains that 0000 commissioned and 10000 non commissoinedofficers are relatively large numbers inan army of 32 OOOpiivats but that theseofficers in many cases received theirappointments because the Cubans haveno other wa3r of recognizing braveryand stimulating enthusiasm It mayseem he says a cheap sort of promotion but it meant a good deal tcthe CubansGen Gomez continues to produce anexcellent impression upon the American militar3T authoritiesThe stories printed here and elsewhere to the effect that Gov GenBrooke intends to require the Cubanmilitary assembly to discontinue itsmeetings are officially denied Another secret session thought it is saidthere was no quorum was held FridayFriday morning the committee appointed Thursday by the assemblycalled upon Gen Gomez to ask an explanation of his conduct and a definition of the understanding reached between him and Gen lirooke which thecommittee declared had prevented asuccessful issue of the assemblys financial project Jen Gomez declined tccomply with the requestWhether Gen Brookes message declaring that the United States willnot recognize any financial obligation entered into by anypersons claiming to representthe people of Cuba without thepresidents authorization was deliveredto the assembly has not yet developedbut it appears that members of the assembly fear that this message willbe followed by others of a morestringent nature The session Saturday will be public and the businesswill be an explanation of what hasbeen done in secret session and a discussion of

changein some features of the governmentof the island of Cuba It is probable that the militarj government willto a certain extent be replaced withzivil government The head of thegovernment must of course remainmilitary but the change in contemplation is to have civil officers in place ofmilitary men in the cabinet and subordinate positions It is believed thatexperts in different lines such asfinance and revenue and in the management of much of the business of theland and the different municipalitieswill get along more smoothly than thearmy officers It is said that the officers being brought up under strictmilitary discipline hold not only thestatutes but the army rules and regulations as the guide in all things whilethe civilian officers would hold the statues as the supreme guide and endeavor to get along under them in the bestmanner possible and with more diplomacy than is possessed by the armymen It is not known whether thecontemplated change has reached apoint further than discussion in thewar department and with the president but its advantages have beenpointed out and the authority of thegovernment to establish such a civilgovernment under control of the military

byCubans on All SidesHavana March IS- After six hounof violent session tne Cuban assemblySaturday evening dismissed Gen Gomez from his position as commander-in-chiefof the army The voce was 94to 0 The first motion to abolish theposition was amended to one dismissingGen Gomez and leaving the post operfor appointment of a successor Manjexciting scenes occurred During thsitting on one or two occasions thdeputies almost came to blows Emanuel Sanguilly was the prneipal arrainger of Gomez He charged binwith being a traitor to Cuba eharactrsrized him as a cardboard Napoleonand likentd him to Marie Antoinettewho a foreigner raised revolt amongthe people of the country of her adoptionGov Gen Brooke was notified Saturday night of the deposition of Gomezand when seen Sunday morning hewas mnch interested to learn the details of the assemblys proceedingsHe said he could not express anopinion as to the effect of thtassemblys action upon the future relations between Gen Gomeand the United States particularlyin the matter of disbursing- the53000000 offered by Washinton to theCuban troops as a condition of disbandmentbut the impression seems tcbe among the American authoritiesthat as the assembly has never beenofficially recognized by the UnitedStates government its action so far asWashington is concerned will notamount to more than the resolutions olany other body of individualsThe assembly is being strongly cenured by Cubans on all sides and therewere popular demonstrations Sundayafternoon in favor of the deposed commander-in-chiefthe crowds shoutingLong live Gomez and Death to theAssemblyThere is no doubt that a majority ofthe people support him as against theassembly The local press will probably attack the assembly urging itsdissolution as the best thing that canhappen and insisting that there is noreason why the United States authorities may not continue to treat withGen Gomez in the matter of the payment to the troops It is said on goodauthority that the pay rolls Gomezis preparing to hand Gen Brookeare most complete full andfair and that when the army learns hecan aid the troops in procuring 83000000 whereas it is problematical whetherthe assembly can obtain anythingthere is little doubt as to the side thearmy will take in the controversy Thetroops are tired of the field and insufficient food and the indications arethat they would readily disband on receipt of the 53000000 unless deceivedby the assembly with promises of alarger payment in the event of refusing to disbandGen Gcmez enjoys the confidence ofthe American military authorities amialthough he says he is glad of his newfound liberty since it will enable himto return home it is not believed thathe will leave Cuba at present He haalways insisted that an active share indistributing the money would fall tchim and there seems no good reasonwhy he can not continue to act as GenBrookes advisor and helperThe patriotic clubs have decided tcabolish the junta patriotica the members of whifh are elected by them andto establish a patriotic league in itsplace Gen Gomez it is said will beasked to accept the presidency of thenew organizationGen Gomez Sunday issued a statement to the Cuban people and army inregard to his deposition as commander Among other things he saidAs a sincere man I confess I thankthem because they relieve me of greatpolitical obligations and also leave mefree to return to my abandoned homewhich during 30 years of continualstrife for the good of this countrythat I love so much has been my ownaspiration Foreigner as 1 am I didnot come

Kola an East Indian interested inoccult researches who had helped him inmuch previous detective work and locatedin an old colonial mansion among the palisades Dr Lampkin is summoned by Hendricks who has been shot Bullet is removed and detective warned not to leavehis room Hendricks calls for a cre matoryemploye who confirms the supposition thatashes found were those of human bodyMiss Huntington receives letter from Gielow in his own handwriting postmarkat Charleston S C telling of his crimeand flight Noted graphologist examineshandwriting of this letter and says it isgenuine During a call on

confessboth in person to Henri and by letters toothersCHAPTER XIVAt half after seven oclock that evening Dr Lampkin was waiting for Hendricks at the latters office Promptlyat the time set by the detective he hurried into the room out of breath Alaglance it was plain to Lampkin that tehad met with no successIts no good said Hendricks fuming 1 cant get the slightest hint ato his whereabouts They say he hasleft the city and there it endsare you going to do nextquestioned Lampkin This case is fretting-the life ou4 of me 1 never felt somuch concern over anything in mylifeHendricks brow ran together andwithout making a reply lie went intothe adjoining room and Lampkin heardhim ring the telephone There was apause then he heard the voice of thedetective calmly asking for the connection Then tenselyTs that Miss Huntington VPause of a moment Then HendricksVpieeBt you ought not to sit up therelike that I wint to say that Dr Lampkin and I are going out into the country and that you need not expect tohear from me again to nightAnother pause then the voice of thedetective broke the silenceYes really I can tell you nothingto night I am sorry to say that so farI have been unsuccessful but whilethere is life you know there is hopeThen there -vas silence for a momentraid Hendricks rang off When he entered the room he was white in the faceand his fat hands the hands which hadtightened about the throats and wristsof a hundred criminals were tremblingOld man he said I heard her fallto the floor just now I heard her auntscream and run to her Hendricks satdown and leaned on his desk Therewas something in his eyes that Lampkin had never seen in the eyes of anyhtiman beingDoctor Hendricks added if I dorun across that dirty scamp I I amafraid I never can wait for justice totake its course I am satisfied that heis not only Gialows abductor but thathe is the man who has tried twice to doint up in such a cowardly fashionlien Hendricks shook himself as ifashamed of his outburst and leanedback in the light of the green shadedlampI heard yon telephone Miss Funtington that you and I were going outinto the country said Lampkiu Wasthat only a pretextNo I am going out to have a talkwith Ivola and as you said youd liketo see his big rambling den I want totake you along for companyNothing could please me moreI have ordered a carriage to meet usat the One Hundred and Twenty fifthstreet elevated station Come on ImreadyAs the carriage after having passedthrough a rather dense wood for abouthalf a mile drew up at the old brickmansion with its three and a halfstories and massive fluted columnsreaching from the ground to the ratherflat roof Lampkin remarkedRather an isolated place No badplace for the gang of robbers of whichyou spokeIt just suits Kola as I said once before answered Hendricks By thetime his hoodwinked customers get herethey ore prepared for anything imaginativeTelling the driver to wait for them atthe door they alighted There was butone light in sight and that was a dismal red one which could be seenthrough the old fashioned side lights ofthe big door on the stone verandaThere was no bell on the door but simply a quaint old knockerI wish observed Hendricks that itwere day instead of night You canform no idea of the picturesque ruggedness of the scenery You see we cameby the old road through the woods butjust behind the house there is a newdrive At this point it has been cutthrough solid stone and there is a cliffwithin 400 feet of us over a hundredfeet in height In blasting th stoneaway it was thought that the old mansion became unsrfe especially as it isbelieved that there are caverns underthe hillHendricks mounted the steps andused the knocker vigorously Theclatter had scarcely died out when thetones of a bell as soft and mellow ascathedral chimes in the distance camefrom the houseKola knows my rap and the bell isa signal to his attendant to admit mesaid Hendricks If I make no mistakeyou are going to be repaid for your rideout here In psychic tom foolery andmysticism you are a schoolboy compared to Kola He imbibed it at thedusky brer st of an eastern mother andhis very life is steeped in itThe door was opened by an Indian inthe costume of his country He placedhis finger on his lip to indicate thatthey were to remain silent and thengave a salaam that brought his turbanalmost into contact with the floorI want to see your master whispered Hendricks handing him his cardAgain the man bowed silently closedthe great door and left them in thespacious hall With many and profusedraperies Kola had hung the walls andceiling so that the effect was distinctlyoriental The ornaments scrolls paintings and statues were all eastern btuwhat struck Lampkin most forciblyperhaps because it was so ill suited toits environment was a dragon of carvedwalnut which stood at the foot of thewide curving stairwayThat belongs to the house explained Hendricks in a whisper It isa genuine curiosity The carving is excellent One would think it of Japaneseorigin but if you will notice it is of thesame material as the balustrade andthat must have been made in this countryJust then the attendant glided frombetween two heavy silken curtains andwith another Balaam invited them topass before him Doing so they foundthemselves in Kolas big reception roomHere their vision was given a rare treatThe lessee of the old ruin had removedthe two floors above the one on whichthey stood giving a becoming altitudeto the walls which were gracefullydraped with long flowing hangings ofdifferent blending cloths The ceilingwas disguised by a filmy mass of whitematerial as gauzy as cobwebs behindwhich shone red and yellow lights likesignal fires in a mistLampkin almost uttered an exclamation of delight but the impressive manner of the attendant and Hendricksunwonted silence checked the impulseThe servant gave them seats with theirbacks to the door through which theyhad entered and then he stood still inthe center of the room his head bowedhis turban held in front of himAfter a moment the mellow tonedbell which they had heard before andwhich was suspended somewhereamong the lights overhead struck threetimes slowly Then a white light blazedup and Kola was seen in a hitherto darkalcove He wore his gray gown andelose fitting cowl and was seen to bepacing back and forth Without seeming conscious of their presence so nearhim he picked up an unlighted electricbulb and turned the button Thenholding the light in his right hand heapproached a black tripod over whichlay a red cloth He lifted the cloth anda big polished crystal sphere was exposed to view It was about ten inchesin diameter and as clear as a diamondReflecting the dull sensuous lights overhead and the bright rays of the electricbulb it was certainly a marvelous sightStill Kola seemed unconscious oftheir proximity From the walls nearhim the smoke of incensp began to risea rosy light pervaded the room and softseductive music was heard somewhereaboveKola held the electric bulb over thecrystal and began to gaze into itsdepths uttering in sing song toneswords of a st tongueLampkin heard the detective take adeep impatient breath and then hisvoice jarred harshly through the roomOh I say Kola he remonstratedI came out here the other day and hadto sit and watch you go through thissort of thing till 1 was obliged to leaveFor the sake ofKola turned furiously his featuresworking wildly Holding up his handhe saidYou must be patient Mr HendricksYou are as ignorant as an infant of theimportance of what I am doing Youlaugh at what you dont understandbut you dont know all that there is tobe known Bight this minute I amreading for you and seeing what youruntutored eyes will never see I knewyou were coming I saw it here touching the crystal I know what youdont know about the case you areworking on If your eye were onlytrained you could see it now in the crystalPardon me said Hendricks that iswhat I come to see you about I amabout to the end of my resources andsomething must be doneWait Kola turned to the crystalThe music changed to a weird air likea Chinese funeral chant After a pauseof several minutes he looked upThe other night I was reading thecrystal I saw a big hotel A man wasmurdered his body was shipped offsomewhere in a trunk its ashes were returned by express and placed in an urntogether with a severed hand Theyoung man who had murdered hisrival went to his rooms his studiothere he remained a week and then hefled south yes it was south I wentinto a trance and my astral body myspirit followed him I saw himaboard a ship bound for Liverpool Iwas near him on deck one dark nightand saw him hurl himself into thewater He is deadRot Rubbish exclaimed Hendricks You have been reading thenewspapers KolaThe face of the Indian darkened itwas terrible to behold Turning off theelectric light and covering up the crystal as if to protect it from the profanegaze of an unbeliever he strode fromthe alcove and stood before HendricksWhen next he spoke his voice washusky tremulous almost threateningYou doubt it he said his accentfor the first time showing a slight foreign touchI do my boy most thoroughly andI really did think you would have morerespect fcr me than to make such absurd statements to my faceKola twisted his long hands togetherin the folds of his gownAs to the crystal he began it isof inestimable value It was cut fromthe most perfectly translucent rockcrystal on earth and it took a manslifetime to polish it I inherited it Itis reverenced by the ancient Society ofRosicrutians and the Society of the IIluminati You whose mind is schooledto know only the signification of fallenstraws and chips of material events canpM y1KOLA TURNED FURIOUSLYknow nothing of what is revealed tonlife long student of the occultT was not ridiculing the powers ofyour glass globe said Hendricksblendinga sneer and a smile but whenyou said you had gone out of your body Iami roamed all round over sea and landwell you know that is a little toomuchKolas face darkened again For amoment he bent over the back of one ofthe carved chairsHendricks he began with tight lipsYou are a sensible man in most thingsand I want your good opinion Now1 am willing for you to put me to anysort of teal you or Dr Lampkin maysuggest to prove the truth of myclaimsOh I havent time just now for thatsort of thing answered HendricksT came out here to Lave a talk withyou aboutI know that very weii broke in theadept but it does not suit me to discuss anything with you till you aeknowledge that I can do everything Iclaim After you are convinced andycu will be my dear sir then 3011 willvalue the information I gave you justnow and it may mean much to you Itwill not take five minutes for the testI proposeWell what is it T asked Hendrickswho had noted Dr Lampkins look ofintense interest in Kolas remarksIt is tnis said Kola impressivelyI will give you the opportunity toname any article at any distance fromus that you wish Then I will reclineon that couch there and after five minutes has passed I will allow Dr Lampkin to examine my body to see if it isnot absolutely at the very lowest possible stage of vitality As a signal toshow when the spirit has left my bodyI will cause the bell overhead to strikeonce TI1211 within five minutes fromthat time I will bring to you here whatever article you have decided onYou in do that exclaimed Lampkin impulsivelyTry me answered the IndianThink of anything Mr Hendricksiny important paper in your office orbook or article in your houseKola was bending towards Hendricksand gazing fixedly into his eyes LampUin who was a member of the PsychicalResearch society of London was takenalmost out of himself by the Indiansearnestness and his novel propositionHendricks la jghedBring me my Bible he said lightlyIt is a beautiful book bound In goldand pearls which was presented to meby a good old bishop for whom 1 oncedid a favorThe idea of jr having a Biblejested Kola his eyes falling to the floorNow quick think of something anything in your office or Dr LampkinsHendricks glanced at the doctor witha smile which seemed to say I havehim there watch me make him squirmout of his own propositionThe Bible or nothing he said toKola Get into your trance and bringme my Bible from home I want toread a chapter on my way back Youcant mistake it It is bound in Russianleather and has gold and pearl trimmingsFor a moment Kola stood as if uvdecided then he went to the lounge andthrew himself on itYou will have to tell me where it ishe said I confess that I know littlemore when out of my body about material things than I do now Peoplelike that fleeing artist sometimes drawme to them magnetically but any inanimate thing is different Where isthe bookHendricks laughedIt is on the center table in the library directly under the chandelieryou cant miss itThanks said the Indian Now DrLampkin when you hear the bellstrike make an examination of mybody Then when the bell strikes fiveminutes later sit quiet and and MrHendricks shall have his proofIf 3rou do what you propose saidHendricks still tauntingly you willmake a convert of me but mind KolaI dont want any explanations about unfavorable conditions preventing theperformance or anything of that kindIt wont go downKola made no answer The musicoverhead had ceased The clouds of incense had risen and hovered about thered and yellow lights above The Indians breast heaved as he took a deepbreath and then he lay still Graduallyhe grew paler and paler till he lookedMke a corpse His features and limbswere rigid Hendricks up to this moment had been smiling at theabsurdityof Kolas proposal but the earnestnessdepicted on Dr Lampkins face finallyinfluenced him and he grew strangelyquietIn about five minutes the bell overhead struck There was a fragmentarywave of soft music and it died away inthe distanceTO BE CONTINUEDTHE LETTER THAT CAMEThere W an a Story Back of It

fair purposes This is an exceedingly good offeras the grounds are easily susceptible tosub division for building lots and thepurchasers could realize a nice advanceon their investment but theyare willingto surrender the grounds to help the fairproject alongA more propitious time or place couldnot be selected for establishing a fairbecause manv of the fairs u this sectionof the State have passed out of existenceand there is a strong popular demandfor this class of amusement Turnpikesare free now and the attendance wouldnaturally be much larger as a consequence The money formerly paid fortoll could be used for the small admission fee to the grounds There are manyother good and sensible reasons whyevery one should do what they can tohelp start the fair againThe merchants well know that thefair as formerly hdd in the first of September was always a great stimulantto trade in all branches and at atime when trade would otherwise beslow Many dollars would flow to thecoffers of the

assistantproperty man with the Abbey GrauItalian Opera company that opened theAuditorium One night wo put onDianorah with Patti in the title roleDiano rah you know is a half wittedgirl who wanders through the mountains here sole companion being a goatThere is a bridge in the mountain andthe two in making their entrance passover itI was sent out the day of the performance to find a goat I located atruck farmer on the West side whosaidhe would accommodate me if 1 gave hima pass J wrote an order on the houseand in the afternoon the goat wasbrought to the stage door with a recommendation as to is gentility Theanimal was brought arly to the theater because William Pary the stagemanager wanted one of his lieutenantsto rehearse with it that is lead itthrough the mountain scene and overthe bridge a few times so that it wouldbecome used to its strange surroundingsBill was a sad eyed beast but themoment it reached us it cheered up andseemed pleased at the prospect of supporting the divine Patti it did noblyat rehearsal going through its part likea veteran actor I was pleased and Ifully expected to be complimented bythe stage manager for finding such raretalentIn the evening we tied the goat nearthe property room and everybody wento supper leaving the stage dark IIntended to feed it just before the performance but when we returned it wasnot necessary When we turned on thelights that confounded beast was licking its chops with the greatest satisfaction while ruin was on all sides of itIt had eaten the side out of a kitchenscene chewed up two set rocks and devoured the water wheel belonging tothe mill in the very scene in which itwas to make its debutI was in disgrace and to this dav Idhave not succeeded in making peacewith Stage Manager Parv We had toimprovise

gives the interestinginformation that camels are employedin the transport service on our greatplain The text book fails to mentionthe Illinois prairies as the present habitat cf the American bison and in factit contains fewer errors on Americangeography than are usually found in aforeign school book The palm for humorous treatment of American mattersmust be awarded to the Swiss atlaswhich awhile ago stamped the wordYankee- in bright red letters acrossthe New England statesThe British inaccuracy with regardto camels doubtless arose from the introduction years ago of a few of theanimals in our southwestern semiaiidregion It may be that some of themare there yet but they have never cutany figure in our transport servicethough they were brought toin tbe time when pack horses andmule trains

istlaeMhIf some one should ask Whin is tobe gained bv learning a trade the answer first suggesting itself would be toshow that a skilled worker an artisanor mechanic earns two or evenfour times as much wages in the samenumber of hours cr day as an unskilled laborer one who does work thatrequires no special training- Tb serfices of a skilled worker are also in moreconstant demand and while he earnstwo or three times a much per hourhe has longer periods of work and lessenforced idlem than has the unskilled laborer The possession of Strade gives a comforting seme ofpurity and independence for one thusskilled is always sure of a comfortablelivelihood and with economy a competency for the declining years of hislife and besides he ha various opportunities of engaging- in profitable business for himself These advantages arewithin the reach of every bright boyand obtainable without asaerifiee Thiswill be understood when it is considered that the wages of an apprenticeo a trade are

under democraticauspicesIt now looks like President McKinley and his party are adopting Democratic principles and platforms and aretrying to became the political heirs ofJefferson Jackson and PolkWas Thomas Jefferson a DemocratHe annexed terrtories by the side ofwhich the Phillippine are a mere potato patch and without the least regard for congress and he arranged todo so and to govern them without somuch as a passing thought of the consent of the governed Was Calhoun aDemocrat Remember the Mexicanwar and the seizure of the empire irthe Southwest Such has been thepolicy of the democracy and all of itsgreat leaders Cass Buchanan Morcyetc from the foundation of the government All this talk about imperialism is mere I osh nonsensehumbugeryThe permanent occupancy of thePhillippines by this government willmeet with the approving consciencesof all civilization and the sober judgment of nine tenths of the peopleThe culmination of the late war willallow that oppressed and stricken people freedom freedom to acquire wealthand to breathe in Gods sunlightJefferson paid 15000000 for Louisiana and that vast territory which includes St Louis and it is now worthfive times fifteen

located Manila the capital of the islands is in areaas large as Illinois Mindinao is nearlyas large as Kentucky There are f ulb2000 islands ranging in size from ahalf acre to the size of LuzonThis tropical archipelago reacheswithin four degrees of the equator on jthe south and is in the same latitudeas Venzuela and Central America Several hundred of the islands varying inareafrom fifty to 600 square miles havenever been explored and are said tocontain a population as fierce and savage as our Apaches or Sioux and are aswild as Hottentots It is indeed almost an unknown land It was discovered by Magellen in 1521 and theystretch no- th and south for more thana thousand miles and lie about 600miles from the southeastern coast ofChina while the island of Borneo ismuch nearer on the southwest
