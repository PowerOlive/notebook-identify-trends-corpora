portant event f married life The young
Wife who is to become a mother delights
to think ol the happiness in store for her
when the little one shall nestle upon her
breast and latterly she shall hear it lisp
the sweet kt holy name mother
But her happy anticipation quickly van
ishes when she realizes the terrible pain
and BtiftVrirg through which she must
pass while bringing the little one into
the world A n i ndeeeribable fear of the
danger attendant upon the ordeal soon
dissipates her joyfulness
Tiiousnnds of women have learned
by experience that there is absolutely
no necessity for the sufferings which at
tend child birth they know that by
the use of Mothers Friond a scien
tific liniment for a few weeks before
the trying hour expectant mothers can
so prepare themselves for the final
hour that the pain and suffering of the
drfeeded event are entirely obviated and

little discomfort
All women are interested and es
pecially expectant mothers who for the
first time have to undergo this trial in
such a remedy for they know the pain
and suffering tc v nothing of the dan
ger which is i e for them Moth
