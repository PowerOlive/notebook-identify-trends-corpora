The first relates tothe personal exemptions allowedmarried persons, and the second tothe previous requiring that a return be made of gross income of $5,000 or more."The act provides that a marriedperson living with husband or wife,whose net income for 1921 was $5,000 or less shall be allowed a personal exemption of $2,500. If thenet income of such person was over$5,000 the exemption is $2,000. Under the Revenue Act of 1918 the personal exemption allowed a" marriedperson was $2,000, regardless of theamount of net income. The normaltax rate remains unchanged, 4 percent, on the first $4,000 of net income above the exemptions and 8 percent on the remaining net income."In order that an income slightlyPresident Stone Asks Tobacco"livered In Crop Lots ToFacilitate HandlingBe-LAYMEN'S CONFEBENCE TO BEHELD HEBEMABKETS TO OPEN SOON"I want to thank the members ofthe association for their patienceand loyalty," said James C.

" 'Net income' is gross income,less certain deductions. The factthat allowable deductions from grossincome, for business expenses, losses,bad debts, ete., may reduce the netincome to an amount below the personal exemptions of ?1,000 or ?2,000, does not alter the requirementto file a return of gross income, ifsuch gross income equalled" or exceeded ?5,000."AMEBICAff LEGION ELECTSOFFICEESand Mrs. Laf6nbehalf of 2&tb.

A crude statue of clay andfibre, representing the flesh and hair ofthe chief as he looked in real life, ismade, his actual skull being used forthe framework of the head, and aroundthis the festivities take place."For years the natives of the teands were the prey of the 'Blackblrders,' or labor pirates, because theyare generally considered more industrious and sturdier of build thanthe average kanaka. They are reputedto have cannibalistic tendencies, to betreacherous and of uncertain temper,facts probably due In some measure tothe treatment to which they were"subjected by these traders.

If a thimbleful oradium costs $120,000, how can mamifacturers afford to use It for paintlnrthe dials of $4.98 wrist watchesDoes this paint really contain radium'The answer to these frequentlyheard questions explains some of thewonders of radium, for that metal Isused for this work, each dial containing a ' minute portion of the realradium. The fact 'that so Infinitesimal a quantity of radium as Is usedon .a watch dial is able to make thefigures glow in the' dark makes iteasier for the average person to understand how and why"-"radium Inlarger quantities is effective whenbrought into contact with diseased tls.sue by the medical profession.Luminous material seen on watchand clock dials is a combination olradium and a specially prepared zincsulphide. If one of these dials be examined with a good reading glass, inthe dark, after the eyes of the examiner have been iru darkness forabout five minutes, the luminous material will be seen to be seething withscintillations or tiny flashes of light.These flashes are c&used by the explosion of the atoms In the minuteportion of real radium in the mixture. "From a gram of rajlium (one thimbleful) there are about 134,000,000,000projectlle-llke particles every second.Crystals of zinc sulphide would breakdown quickly if exposed to such abombardment. By reducing the percentage of radium until t' numberof these particles from the explodingatoms on the dial was about 200,000a second, it has been found that thediaT wou'd have a brightness easilyvisible In darkness and for a periodof five years. This means that thequantity of radium In the average dialcannot be more than one-millionth ofa gram, and it is only about such aquantity that is on the average dial."SAYS C0L0P?5 AFFECT USWilliam Hoyt I'eck, New York scientist and authority on the psychologicaleffect of color on humanity, declaresthat "brilliant green street lightswould clear all thoroughfares ofgunmen and burglars and that brightred lights should be used In quicklunch rooms to save patrons from theravages of dyspepsia.

(Prom Congerssional Record)Senator Heflin (Dem., Ala.), madethe statement that in the Northwestoats are selling for about 17 to 20cents a bushel, then referring to theRepublican administration, said,"And by their fruit ye shall knowthem.". Mr. Caraway Mr.- President, inthe interest of accuracy only, let mesuggest that when the Senator fromAlabama said that we should, knowtheRepttblican' party' by its fruits,he meant we should know them btheir oats.Mr. Heflin That is right, by theprice of oats now.

In fact, nobody in the postal department evendream8-otreducingv the system in.the larger places.Why should the people of $hesmall towns be picked on to suffer?If the government once starts thisthing of abandoning the little service it now gives small communities, there is no telling where Itwill end. If 752 towns can.be ruth-jlessly deprived of letter dellevery inone big dump, it will be easyenough to pick larger places, oneby one, and drop them from thesystem.All American towns of less than10,000 population ought to raise atremendous fuss about this matterright away and never let up' untilthe government adopts a direct opposite policy a policy-of extensionof service rather than abandonment of afly service under the sun,whatever it is.3 : r"- ' Variety" of" Meney. -In Africa, a weird assortmentbeads, elephants tusks and spearheads Is made use, of as coins. laBurmah little cowrie shells generallyanswer the purpose of Interchange, butfor very small transactions disks ofporcelain" are made use of.

One of the twoold parties has been given into theexecutive hands of a man who ismore statesman than politician.The National Committee of theDemocratic party has made CordellHull its chairman.Hull is not at all the type generally placed in that important position. A past master at practicalpolitics is usually selected.That is the first reason for surprise. He knows very little andprobably cares less about big, orthodox political manipulations. That isnot his way of doing things.Also, Hull is decidedly a progressive, by habit and from conviction.In Congress, he ranked among thegreatest constructive .forces ever tosit in the House. He was a greatstudent and a tireless worker. Hedemonstrated exceptional capacity asan economist. The income tax lawwas a product of his planning. Ontariff and revenue questions he wasparticularly expert.He is clean, courageous, scho'larlya statesman of the Old School whois thoroughly abreast of modernproblems.It will be highly interesting toobserve how the Democratic partyresponds to this kind of leadership.(jan3-13-T)INTERURBAN TIMETABLEParis toLexingtonC45 a. m.8:15 a. m.9:45 a. m.11:15 a. m.12:45 p. m.1:15 p. zn..3:45 p. xn.5:15 p. m.(:50 p. m.m.m.m.,.f:15firsoLexingtonTo Paris5:50 a. m.7:20 a m.8:50 p. m.10:20 a. m.11:50 a, m.1:20 p. m.3:50 p. m.4:20 p. m.6:00 p. m.7:20 p. m.9:10 p. m.11:00 p. m.dash Fare. 60c: Ticket Fare, 54c.utation 52 trip monthly book,2.00.
