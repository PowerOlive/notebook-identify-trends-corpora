eerticate of William S aylor was signedby the election commissioners and hewas declared to be the governor electof KentuckyThe official figures of the vote filedwith Secretary of State Finley areTaylor 193714 Goebel 191331 Taylors plurality 23S3 The operationwhich ended for the time being atleast the bitterly fought gubernatorial contest was conducted in thesimplest manner The majority opinion of Commissioner Pryor and Ellisand the minority opinion of Commissioner Poyntz which were publishedSaturday morning were not read aswas the original intention The threecommissioners walked first to theoffice of the clerk of the state supreme court where they filed twoopinions They then passed into theoffice of the secretary of state ClerkChenault of the board of commissioners read the figures showing that therepublican candidates for offices onthe state ticket had received the largest number of votes and then certificates of election were signed at oncethat of Mr Taylor being first on thelist There were only 14 people inthe room at the time and of thisnumber only two were there as idlespectatorsThere was no crowd around thebuilding and no interest manifestedin the work save by those engaged init and those who stood looking onThe certificates as soon as signedwere filed with the secretary of stateand certificates will be issued to theelected men at once by Gov BradleyLate Friday night when the decision had gone forth to the publicCommissioner Ellis upon whoseshoulders the greatest part of thework of preparing the opinion hadfallen discussed the matter freelyThis has been a hard thing for mehe said his eyes inflamed by loss ofsleep and the heavy lines in his facebearing eloquent witness to the truthof his statement Tt has been ahard thing for all of us I wish however that all the people of the country knew how nobly Judge Pryorhas acted in this matter and howconscientiously he has done what heconsidered his duty He is a greatman one of the greatest in my opinion that Kentucky has ever producedand I am sure his conduct in this casehas been another piece of his long andhonorable career as a public officerSpeaking for myself continued MrEllis I say frankly I did no like todo this thing but under the law andthe evidence there is nothing else Ican do and be an honest man WhyI was an original Goebel man 1 wasa Goebel man long before he receivedthe nomination and I am a Goebelman now I can go beyond that andsay I am a Goebel partisan I havealways been a partisan in politics arank partisan and it would give megreater pleasure than I can expressto be able to declare for the democrats in this thing but I cant do itThe proceedings before the boardwere so overwhelmingly in favor ofthe republicans and they had so muchme best of the arguments that it isalmost idle to discuss the affairThere was to the minds of JudgePryor and myself only one thing todo and that we have done I knowthere are plenty of men who thinkthat strong democratic partisan as1 have always been I should haveremained a democratic partisan andvoted otherwise How can I do thatHow can I commit such a rape on myreputation and conscience as thatViewed from the legal standpointwhich in things like this is the onlystandpoint I have done what my conscience and my long career as a lawyer tell me is right and I will do otherwise for no man nor upon any con-6ioerationThe statements made by Mr Ellishave been upheld by his conduct fromfirst to last throughout the canvassHe did all of the questioning of theatorneys and seemed at every stage tobe most anxious to obtain the truthimpartial to both sides Mr Goebelwas apparently in the best of humorater being told that Mr Taylorscertificate had been signedCommissioner Poyntz declined tosign the republican certificates ofelection saying that he stood by theopinion he had rendered and couldnot consistently do so He consented to sigr the certificates of the railroad commissioners howeverWants A

waswhite his eyes wandering while over hiskin ran cold and hot hushes His mothersat by the big window at the west end ofthe dining room Mary Carr was at thedoor her hand upon the knob She wasspeaking to JohnOf course if you have got to be made togo theres no heroism in it The TenthPennsylvania dont want that class of menBut if you love me if you think anythingof the old liag if you go because you oughti to go why you can come and say good byto me to nightThe latch clicked and she was gone Sloanlooked at the troubled face of his motherand left the house Mechanically he wandered to the great red barn and the stallswhere sleek horses stamped There he battled with himselfThe Sloan farm in Pennsylvania on thebanks of the Juanita river has been workedfor a hundred years by men of the sameblood 1 think the livings the McClellandthe Curtins and last the Sloans all intermarried have been the possessors of theacreage since the battle of BrandywineEach generation of this family down to theSloans had a fighting man in the nationsserviceIt is not to be wondered then that theSloans suffered in their pride to find thatthey were tiie first of the race to be without a military representative John Sloantheir only son heir to their goodly estawas a physical coward lie knew it and sodid his gray haired lather and kindly facedmotherMorally he was a clean wholesome boyPhysically he was tali ruddy faced wellmuscled and more than good looking Yetil was a matter of horror and shame to himthat he feared firearms dreaded the blowgiven in friendly contest with other boysand was in a tremble if bodily harmseemed imminentBut if the suffering had been a sore trialto him in his earlier days John Sloan neverrealized its full agony until following theoperations of the American army in Culand the war with Spain there came thecall for troops to serve in the Philippinesand the Tenth Pennsylvania regiment wasordered to prepare for service in the fieldThe destination of the regiment was Maui aWord had gone out from Pittsburgh tharecruits would be accepted by the regimentThis message reached the settlement aboutthe Sloan farm in the Juanita countrySeveral young men promptly came forwardand deciarc J they would enlist The grlthat John Sloan loved and wished to be hibetrothed Mary Carr asked him if hedid not intend to join His answers wereevasive Then she called at the Sloan homeand asked him directly to enlist And itwas after this scene that John Sloan liedto the red barn to hide Ins miseryA womans will is Btronger than a manVwhen that man loves the woman John- oan won a partial victory over his tearsand decided that he would join the regimentAt evening time the young man crossed thefields to tiie Carr homestead He expectedthat Mary would be watching for him butshe was not at the gate nor on the frontporch Her mother greeted him with thewordsWe had a sudden telegram from IowaJohn that Marys sister was ill very illPa hitched up at once and Mary left on theafternoon train Shes gone to Cedar Rapids cause none of the rest of us could goShe left this note for youThe lines within ran like thisJohn mother will tell you about myhurried going I have prayed every minute since I left your bouse that you wouldsee your duty clearly Ii when you receivethis ou have decided to enlist you will knowthat you have made your best friends veryhappy and done your duty to your countryand the Bag MaryIt is making a long story rightfully shortto say that the next day he left for Pittsburgh passed through the test of enlistment was accepted and assigned to company A of the Tenth Pennsylvania A letter which his father had written to ColHawkins commander of the regiment secured him some courtesies he otherwisewould not have receivedHe wrote to Mary Carr at Cedar Rapidsthe date his regiment would leave Pittsburghand its route to Sail Francisco and it wasafter this letter was gone that he was seizedwith an inspiration lie made his way tohis captain and told him frankly that hewould like to leave Pittsburgh several daysAhead of the regimenvand meet it at CedarRapids as it traveled west He said franklyalso that the reason for his going to CedarRaDids was a woman Ten hours later liewas on his way to Chicago dressed in hisregimentals and marked by all who observed him as a recruit for the PhilippinesHis peace of mind did not increase as theKorth Western carried him from Chicagoto Cedar Rapids aCTOSI the Mississippi intothe fertile fields of IowaJt is Dot necessary to go into the detailsof Sloans meeting with -Mary Carr nor theinevitable pleading on his part that beforehe left she would give him her plightedword When the moment of final separation was at hand she said to himYou know and I know that T care foryou how much it is not necessary to tellLet the way you do your duty at the frontprove to me how much or how little I am tocare for you in the future I am not sending you to greatness but oh John I wantyou to come back a proven man and andthe day you do 1 will give you my final answer Jo now and God be with you tillwe meet againSloan joined his regiment crossed withthem the historic Union Pacific and CentralPaeiiie railroads and came at last to thePresidio at San Francisco where the regiment was stationed for a short timeThe sailing was on June 15 and as thetransport passed out of the Golden Gate onher long journey Lo the orient he leaned overthe rail of the troop deck until the lajid hadentirely faded Iron sight sick at heart unmanned a pitiable object to himself if notto his companions One of them threw hisArms about the neck of Sloan and sang outjn gleeful toneThen stand to your glasses steadyJujd drink to your comrades eyesHeres a cup for the dead and the dyingHurrah for tht next one that diesSloan shuddered broke away and hid inhis bunk Overhead was Col HawkinsRarnett Maj Cutlibertson the gentle chaplain Hunter and other heroic leadersAnd although Sloan did not know it thenthere was one captain above whose thoughtwas upon him and whom he was to learn tocall My Captain to the end of his daysThis captain carried in his effects a letter from John Sloans father in which werethe linesMy boy is going to battle in your command Years ao your father and mybrother went to hattle as comrades ard inthe heat of conflict your father fell wounded34y brother carried him to a place of safetyTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY TUESDAY DECEMBER 12 1899and in the end nursed him back to strengthI ask you to care for my boy as one of mineonce did for yours He is a good lad but heneeds a friend now as he never did beforeAnd this was the reason why after thetransport had cleared Honolulu and wason the last tack for Manila that John Sloanfound himself detached frOm his companyand on duty in the officers quarters wheremuch to his surprise a certain captainoften spoke kindly to him and gave him encouragementI have watched you enough Sloan toknow that you are mortally afraid of whatwe are going into You are a bundle of nonsensical nerves but whatever is going tohappen when we are on shore rememberthis Sloan dont runMen pray even in these hard days andJohn Sloan prayed that night for strengthprayed as only a man can who knows thathe is a coward yet is determined to tight tothe end In the morning while looking overhis kit he came across a North -Westernrailroad folder which was the only one remaining of several he had provided himselfwith when starting from home and somehow it gave him cheer and comfort to readthe old familiar names in the states and toknow that back there many were thinkingand living for himThe landing was rough Their transporthad pa ed up the harbor by the Olympiathe Raleigh the Boston flags flying bandsplaying and the great admiral on his bridgebowing and raising his hat as the troopscheered which had come to his aid EvenSloan forgot his fidgets and waved his caphigh in the air and yelledHurrah DeweyManila was still in the hands of the Spanish Aguinaldo was seekii cure recognition from the United States and at thesame time to capture Manila and loot thecity Dewey was holding the insurgentsin check and preparing to take the city TheTenth Pennsylvania was landed at Civileand then marched to the trenches at Malatein front of the Spanish outposts Activeservice was commenced at once The firstduty that came to Sloan after the regimentwas in the trenches was that of picket Hiswas on the edge of a thicket scarce amile from the Spanish line The tropicalrains had commenced and the feverwas already upon some of the menHe was given particular instructions towatch out for a surprise the Spaniards having displayed great activity during the dayalong trie front of their linerapped in his rough weather eo at holding his gun underneath it to keep it drySloan paced up and down his post splashingin the water wondering at the brilliancy oithe lightning and shivering in dread anticipation of trouble A flash of lightningshowed him figures on the plain in front ofhim moving toward himOnly the enemy could come from that direction Sloan stood stil as if welded to theground His hair rose on end He yelledand tired in the direction of the advancingfoeStrang is it not that that Bhot fired byJohn Sloan coward gave to the Americanarmy its notice of the advance of theSpaniards al Malate defeated the enemyand made a her of a trembling frightenedhalf boy half manin after tiring ran back towards hiown lines and stumbled or fell at the feetof that captain who had first encouragedhim to do his duty He jumped up out ofthe slush saturated and was ordered to takeposition with his company Twice duringthe battle did Sloan have the wildest desireto run But as it has done many times before in the worlds history that nameMary held him to his place and dutyWhen morning came and it was realizedthat American pluck and valor had won theday it was Sloans captain who sending forhim saidYou knew your duty last night Youhave placed yourself in line for promotionThe colonel knows of your service as picketThen out of the boys heart rushed allthose years of misery and doubt all thoseunnamed fears that held manhood back andkept him the child There came messagesfrom far away home At the end of hismothers letter there was a penciled lineThe Dodd boys have written home ofyour bravery at Malate We hear you maybe promoted Keep up John Mary CarrThat kind of a love letter wouid not satisfy all men but it did satisfy John Sloanwho tucked it away in his blouse and leadit many times in the days to come Hewould sit in the shade of his tent read theshort lines from Mary Carr over draw outhis North Western railroad folder and onthe ground work out the topographical mapof the long range of country from the GoldenGate to the Juanita regionOther soldiers came to watch his self-appointedtask Some suggested the outlinesof the Missouri valley others the location ofAmes and Clinton still others the topographical building of that beautiful sweepof Illinois from Clinton to Chicago Thelittle time table and folder from which theydrew their general dan was preserved asthough priceless in intrinsic value Nostalgia that dread disease of all armies calledin the Cerman Heimweh in EnglishHomesickness was fought off with thisstrip of printed paper and these rough tracings on the face of the earth time and timeagainThere was not much soldiering to be doneafter the July fight until late in December Hostilities with the insurgents commenced shortly afterwards and by Februaryreal war was again raging on the island ofLuzon The day and the night of February4 will be remembered by Sloan BO long ashe livesDuring the day of February i insurgentskept creeping up on the American outptand there was desultory tiring That nightSloan was stationed on picket duty perhaps200 yards from a Chinese hospital in whichwere several hundred Filipinos The oppresisve darkness of an oriental evening hadalready settled down when a number of theseinsurgents attacked the American lines oroutposts at the point where Sloan wasplaced At the first scattering volley thatapprised him he was under lire he ran likea madman toward his own lines There wasa ditch to cross and in the brush of its bottom was a liarbed wire Becoming entangled in this he fell and stunned himselfwhile his regiment coming to the frontpassed over him and men of the hospitalcorps lacking him up for wounded sent himto the rear There it was quickly discoveredthat with the exception of a cut on his headfrom the fall Sloan was uninjured and hewas ordered back to the frontAt daybreak word came to the Tenth thata charge was soon to be ordered The captain of whom Sloan was so proud was nearhim and quietly taking note of his wretchedr countenance Of a sudden he ordered bloanto come to him and when the latter approached saidSomeone on the picket line ran last nightWas it yopYes said Sloan feeling a strange relief come over him at getting the truth outWell said the captain speaking veryslowly you ought to be shot As it is fightto day for Gods sake fightSloan went back to the ranks all in a flamethe blood coming hot and then cold in hisveins The bugles rang officers shoutedand the line of American boys swept forward first very slowly then gaining momentum increasing the speed until it was amad rush and every man on his metal toreach the hospital first Shots were popping from it men were falling Landis wentdown and others but the rush neverstoppedBut the maddest of all sights was JohnSloan hatless far beyond his own line running like a hare for the hospital gun well upbut never firing a shot Officers yelled inastonishment as he ran by them privatesenvying him his gait shouted in encouragement He was a stimulant to the entireline this coward from the Juanita countryHe was in front of the walled church noweager to fight his way in Men were yellingon all sides of him and there was the snapof flames in the thatch Suddenly the earthseemed to slip away from him his headwhirled he threw up his arms and wentdown wounded Sloan had given his bloodin atonement for his cowardice and no mancan do more than that When his sensesreturned to him he was in the field hospitaland his left shoulder done up in bandagesThere he remained until March receivingfrom home many kind letters but none sodear as the one which ran like thisT know all about what you did everybody is talking of your bravery if you werehere 1 would tell you John what 1 think ofyou do do come home MARY CARRBut John Sloan was yet to fight at Maiolosto cross a Filipino river under tire withFunston the men swimming side by side tobe with the Utah battery the ThirteenthMinnesota the men from Oregon and Nebraska and whin Maiolos was taken hewas to fall in the middle of its main streetsshot again as he held the colors high tor thecheer of his comrades It was then he wastaken back to Manila as Sergt Sloan of theTenth and nursed until such strength cameback as enabled him to return to the dearold railroad folder and with pencil and paperthis time map out the long journey homefrom the Golden Gate over the Union Pacific and the North Western to the JuanitacountryThe Tenth caim inl i Manila to relieve thaFifty first Iowa at Cavite and there to itcame the glad news that it was ordered homeand would go as soon as the transport wasready The gallant regiment had been 69days on the firing line and made a wonderfulrecord for bravery The latter part of Junethe men went on board ship and late in Julyreached San Francisco bringing into theGolden Cute the body of Col Hawkins whohad died en routeThe Union Pacific and North Westsrnbrought them over the Sierras through theRockies across the plains of the Platte andsafely to Chicago A little Later they werein Pittsburgh where royal greeting awaitedthem But Sloan could not wait for thisand hastened to the home of Mary CarrJohn was at the foot of a small hill whenlooking up the path to the summit he sawher coming for a moment she did not seehim but paus d to gather a lower by tiie wayThen he walked up toward her one handoutstretched No gnised him andthere was a flame in the hazel eyes and flameon the soft cheeks and the quick heart-givingcry ofJohnHe was by her side now the white handof the maiden caught in the brown of thesoldierI have come he said all the old fearsgone a long way to teil you that I am nolonger afraid I have done my duty Thiswith a touch of pride 1 was often troubledI did many things I ought not to have donebut 1 have conquered myself Mary MaryI want youFor no hero of war or of peace can therebe greater reward than the love of a purewoman The emoluments of governmentor the rewards bestowed by patriotic citisens sink into significance beside the givingto a man of a good womans heart Therecame nestling into the hand of John Sloannot one white hand but two and the face ofMary Carr was lifted to his and her lipsgiven to himThen she turned back with him and thetwo thus united after sore trial walkedtheir happy way up to the old farm and theold folks waiting there Much had Sloan totell much to go over and over again hislighting his wounds his myriad experiencesin Malayland but when he had toid all hewould that night he brought out the fadedNorth Western folder and he tossed it intothe lap of Mary Carr with the wordsThat was a living link with home to usin the field and at Manila keep it foreverit did much to save me for youAnd being a woman she asked him whyand in time he told her this storyNote Cpon receipt of six cents in postLe stamps this complete story in bookform handsomely

saw Turn rrtop and converse with the stranger afew moments when the latter drew rjm and Bowers whisperedIts the man they call Taylor Hesn after bosses sure1 unconscious of the proximity ofthe two men Taylor tramped s4uron and was soon out of hearing in thewoods Then the two left their ambushai hurried after Turner who awaitedthem far out on the plainWhat did he say inquired RowerseagerlyAsked me where I was bound anr re was any hosses ter be gotin Dyea said Turner who neverst emed to waste a wordI knew it declared Rowers Nowall weve got ter do is find a snug placethis side whar the trail

dense woods buteach day was divided into watcheswhen they took turns standing on sentinel duty From a knoll a short distance from the hut they had built thetrail was visible for fully a mile andfrom daylight to dark they watched itcloselyTheir patience was rewarded whenLate one afternoon they saw Dick Taylor riding along to the north leading astring of horses behind himOur time is most up now

sighting the party Rider was toconceal himself in the woods near thehut Rowers himself was to remain inthe hut on the boughs which servedhim for a bed while Turners part wasto meet the travelers and play the roleof a decoyThey all know my phiz said Bowers an some o them knows RiderYou are the only one they dont knowOf course Taylor will remember meetin yer the other day when he was goinin an ver

said Turner sententiously while even Rider began to beimpressed with the Clever scheme Itwas also a great relief to know thatthere was to be no bloodshed for badas he was he had not the heart for suchdeeds when he was soberAfter carefully discussing everyphase of their villainous plot and arranging the details the trio stretchedthemselves on their rude beds and weresoon sleeping as soundly as though noguilt rested on thsdr mindsCHAPTER XVIROBBEDAll unconscious of the snare ahead ofthem the successful gold hunters rodealong over the trail theirgold secured on theiranimals and theirhearts filled with natural thanksgivingat their success They were rich richbeyond their wildest hopes and it hadell been done in a few short weeksThey had registered their claims inDyea but there was considf rable doubtrh ther they were located in Americanor British territory as the boundaryline was not exactly known This how-r had been fairly explained to thepurchasers who declared their willing-to take the risk This they couldwell afford to do for they had boughtthe claims for about one quarter theiractual value and were well aware ofthe fact Tiny had only to registerthem in Dawson also to make them-safeTheir progress was necessarily slowt ach horse carried not only a ridera large amount of gold as wellWhere the trail was very rough the menre forced to dismount at soit was nearly night on the secondw hen the party drew near the pieceof woods where Hank Rowers and hisally confederates were hiddenTaylor was leading the way as theyreached the first trees where alreadythe lengthening shadows were stretch-ing a toss the trail The others werestragglingalong behind him while Tomri Avery rode side by side inrearIn fact this had already become hisusual place and his devotion was soWell

suddenly a man hurried out of the woods at his left andcame directly toward him shoutingStranger Hold onChecking in his horse Taylor allowedthe man to reach his horses side andthen exclaimedWho are

if sumthin cant be didfer him Hes in a bad wayTaylor looked hard at the strangerHe was apparently about 40 years oldrather tall a scar across his thin nosewhich made his eyes seem close together It was not a face to inspireconfidence but Dick Taylorhad not theslightest suspicion of danger as heaskedWho is- the man and where did hecome from Whats the matter withhimHes a sailor sort of a chap an hishorse throwed him he says Then hispardner skipped off an Iefthim ter kickther buckel iloneAs the man spoke Taylor suddenly remembered his faceDidnt I meet you not long ago onthis trail he

latlonOne of the besetting sins of the expert Tritness is thi habit or tendencyto use a lot of Latin words in describing an injury to tlie jury In some exceptional cases doubtless this is donewirhcut affectation or for a purposebut we have no hesitation in sayingthat in the majority of instances it isa very good index of the learning andcapacity of the expert on the assumption that the more words of this sortare used the more probability there isthat they cover a deficiency of knowledge and thorough grounding on thepart of the user A really able manin his profession will always accommodate himself to circumstances andrealizing the capacity of the averagejuror use very different forms andmethods of expression in testifying before court and jury than if he weremaking an address or delivering apaper on some scientific subject beforean audience of his professional brethrenA physician for example who whenupon the stand he is asked to describesomething to the jury uses all the highsounding terms and expressions he canmuster deserves to have very littleattention paid to his testimony andusually gets his deserts An amusingexample of this truth is given in thefollowing account of an actual happening in an English court It is from alittle book entitled Hints on Advocacy published first in EnglandI discovered considerable ecchymosis under the left orbit caused byextravasation
