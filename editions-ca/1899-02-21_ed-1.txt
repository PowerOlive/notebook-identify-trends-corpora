Upon searchof Caruthers apartments remains of cremated body and jeweled hand of victim arefound in a vase Hand bears marks offinger nails manicured to sharp pointsLampkin recalls reports of a row betweenCaruthers and Arthur GieJow both suitorsfor hand of Dorothy Huntington who isheiress to several millions should she marry Caruthers unconditionally in case ofCaruthers death Late that night Hendricks and Lampkin call at home of MissHuntington Dorothy mentions a letterWhich she had received from CaruthersDetective asks to see itCHAPTER IV ContinuedThe door opened just then and theheiress entered followed by her auntMiss Huntington opened the letterand handed it to the detectiveEven at a distance of several feet ami inthe dim sensuous glow made by thelight striking- through the ruby coloredglobes the doctor saw Bend ricks eyesflush as they fixed themselves on thesheet of paper and noted the eagerflash of bis face which betokened a discovered clew The letter ran as followsMy Dear Miss Huntington How can Iever hope to get your forgiveness for running away from New fork so suddenlywithout acquainting you with my plansHowever this will teach you in time toinclose the tickets for the Horse Show Iv am sure Count Bantinni will see to yourpleasure and comfort I am here situethree days and have every day nay everyhour been occupied with pressing business Hoping soon to see you again andtendering my best regards to Mis Winfret believe me Yours sincerelyWKLDOX CAROTHER8Silence filled t lie room as Rend ricksret J and reread the letter his eyesdv elling on the lower part of the pageLampkin thought with eager fixityDoes Mr Caruthers speak Frenchfluently was the first question he directed to Miss HuntingtonHe does not speak it at all repliedthat young ladyOr GermanThat language neitherHas he a command of any othertongue except EnglishXo I am positive that he has notanswered Miss Huntington authoritativelyThen he did not write this saidsHendricks iu a certain tone of satisfaction peculiar to a man who has foundhimself correct in a conclusion derivedfrom slight evidenceSurely you must be mistaken began the young lady but the detectiveleaned forward pointing to a line onthe paperThe person who wrote or dictatedthis communication is accustomed tospeaking foreign languages The letter as a whole is correct English butat one point the writer made a slipSee he says 1 am here since threedays Now that is one of the idiomswhich are discarded last by foreignersin their efforts to acquire oar languageYou know we say 1 have been hereetcYou certainly are most observantgranted Miss Huntington with an incredulous smile but 1 happen to knowthat Mi Caruthers often dictated hiscorrespondence to stenographers athotels during his travels and on thisoccasion he may have employed a typewriter whose one weak point may bethe very idiom you mentionI thought of that before I spokesaid the detective Hut typewritersIn this country usually are Englishspeaking men and women Moreoveri see In the inequality of the strokesthat this was done by a band new atthe businessMiss Huntingtons face fell and thna nervous worried expression cameinto itTell me frankly she said what allthis is aboutHendricks drew himself upI wonder he said if you would object to speaking to my friend and myself alone It is a little matter tihatperhaps Mrs YVinfret may not be exactly interested inThe heiress threw a perplexed glanceat Mrs YVinfret and for a momertseemed not to be able to formulate areply Her aunts intuition howeverhad been sharpened by the nervousstrain upon herSomething has gone wrong with MrCaruthers she burst forth Youthink I am too excitable to hear it but Iam not What has happenedYou may speak before her saidMiss Huntington slowly paling Ingreat trials -she is as strong as thestrongestWe have vital reasons for believingMr Caruthers has been foully dealtwith said Hendricks He studied theirset faces for instantan and then concluded The truth is he was murderedin his apartments on the night he wassaid to have leftOh simultaneously burst fromboth ladies and then dead silence filledthe room There was no sound withoutexcept the dull rumble of a passingstageMurdered came from the lips ofthe young ladyHendricks noddedBut I think we had better not go intothe details to night The papers willbe full of it in the morningBut you must you must have cometo me for a purpose said Miss Huntington helplesslyIt was because if you will pardonthe allusion I seem to see the shadowof a motive for the murder in the factthat your uncle had stipulated in hiswill that your inheritance from him dependedMy marriage to Mr Caruthers interrupted the girl Yes that is trueAlso added the detective your acquiring the fortune without marryinghim was not possible except in the caseof his deathAh I see what you mean xclaimcdMiss Huntington1 have no one in view quickly resumed Hendricks but you must knowthat such a vast fortune and the hopeof winning your hand with it would bea great temptation to many You musthave several suitors and it was withthe hope thatyou might confer with meabout them that I sought you so quickly Little suggestions from the fountain head so to speak often save memuch futile researchThe heiress leaned back in her chairwhite mod faint The delicate taperinghand she placed on her brow shook asif with palsyOh aunt she ejaculated and thenshe tightly pressed her lips togetherand remained muteYou should not think of those youreally care for said Hendricks moresympathetically than Lampkin had imagined possible to his weather beatennature There must be many verymany who have hoped to gain vour regardThe suggestion evoked no responsefrom Miss Huntington Her featuresseemed under the control of but onedominant idea and that idea whateverit was deprived of her normal actionThere can be no harm in telling allwe know broke in Mrs Winfret whoacquired considerable calmness in feeling that she might be of service Youknow Dorothy there have been so verymanyThe young lady seemed still too muchagitated to speakGossip has associated jour namewith one of the most worthy young menin town said Hendricks delicatelyand as he is doubtless wholly innocentof any connection with the tragedy youmight be doing him a service to put meon to all available clewsDorothys face was like a death maskin yellow plasterCould they pofisibly associate himwith it she questionedUnfortunately it is said that he hadsome sort of difficulty with Mr Caruthers only a short while before he wasreported to have left the cityThe features of the girl shrank together as if she had been smitten in theface She made no replyWe heard about it put in Mrs Winfret And 1 did not like it either Theonly sensible view to take of the stipulation in the will was that Dorothyought to carry out her uncles wishesand Arthur Gielow acted so insanelyover it I advised him to go abroad buthe wouldnt listen to reason It was anawfully egotistical thing his quarreling with Mr Caruthers in a publicplaceA flush of anger flowed into the whiteness of the girls faceIt is absurd to speak of that quarrelat such a moment she said with spirit except from the standpoint of itsprejudicing the ignorant public againstan innocent manI seldom make mistakes said Hendricks and I assure you that 1 amgoing to work on the theorjr that Gielcw us not the man I am looking forMiss Huntington leaned forwardeagerly She almost smiled in herboundless reliefI am so glad to hear you say thatshe said softly He has had so muchtrouble already that to be suspected ofthis would break his heart completelyOf all the suitors she has had 1 havethe least use for that Italian CountBantinni declared Mrs Winfret Icannot bear him in my sight Nobodyknows how he ever got such a footholdin society He was introduced by SirKeginald Tyler who was the rage herefor a mouth and went away suddenlyand has never once been heard of sinceCount Bantinni seems to have kept hisplace only becarse of his learning People seemed to be afraid it would showigiorance on their part to refuse himtheir hospitalityCount Bantinni mused Hendricksknow such a man doctorOnly from having seen his name insociety papers was Lampkin replyHe is absolute the Queerestvidual on earth pursued Mrs Winfretas if glad of an opportunity to expressher dislike Dorothy has refused himthree times We should never havegone with him last night to the HorseShow if Mr Caruthers had not arranged the box party before he leftI am sure he is a fortune hunter andit was with that conviction in my mindthai I told him of the condition in MrI Van Courtlands will He looked perfectly bewildered when I mentioned itand made me give him all the particuTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY TUESDAY FEBRUARY 21 1899lars He said nothing all the rest ofthe evening it was here at a receptionone nightHendricks eyes flashed involuntarilyand then his face became again unreadableHow long ago was that he askedcarelesslyMrs Winfret reflectedAbout two weeks she repliedMiss Huntington had been leaningforward eagerly drinking in what w assaid but watching her closely Lampkin saw her gradually take on the droopof utter despondency She rose witha certain cold majestyYou must really excuse me shesaid I must go up to my room Ohaunt I feel so tired The gentlemenwill excuse usThe men sprang upOh pardon us said the doctorThis is too much for your nervesBest is all I need answered theyoung lady courteously apologeticYou must get something soothing todrink and try to sleep advised Lampkin and he backed from the roomfollowed by the detectiveOutside Hendricks seemed absorbedin thoughtWell inquired the doctor as theystruck out down the avenueWe must sift Gielow to the bottomsighed HendricksBut I thought ydn saidI know I did and I meant it at themoment but Miss Huntinjrton knowssomething to offset my theories in hisfavor She is absolutely convinced thatGielow is in for it and it must be powerful evidence to make a woman believe her lover guilty of murder Ahdoctor if it had been in my power tolave comforted her Id never have lether go to her room looking as she didCHAPTER VMrs Winfret solicitously accompanied her niece to her chamber Shedismissed the drowsy maid and herselfundressed the girl and sat beside herbed for some moments Her ownnervousness seemed to have taken alittle flight into the realm of gratifiedvanity over having aided a famous detective in a most important investigation When Dorothy seemed quietershe rose and went softly to her ownromDorothy found herself alone Therewas an awful solemnity about the artistic chamber with its high ceiling decorated with figures that seemed to risefrom their somber background andpeer at her through the subdued lightThe passage of vehicles on the streetbelow was now markedly infrequentTHE PERSON WHO WROTE THIS iS ACCUSTOMED TO SPEAK THE FOREIGNLANGUAGESThe girl judged that it was about threeoclock The moonlight chill andghostlike fell in through a windowIt is no use cried the girl I cansee no hope for him Oh God helpmetShe rose and drawing on a wrapperand thrusting her feet into slippersshe went to her writing desk in a cornerand sat down For a moment sheleaned her head on her folded arms andher lips moved mutely Then sheopened the desk and from a secretdrawer took out a package of lettersand began to peruse them She wassearching for evidence with which tosubdue the horrible fear that was taking root in her consciousness As shelaid each note aside a voiceless conviction cried out in her heart One of theletters she held before her long andsteadily while her beautiful eyes distended and her breath almost ceasedIt contained some passages which hadsuddenly risen before her minds eyeduring the talk in the drawing roomThey ran as followsThen there are time darlirg when rationality seems to desert me leaving melittle more than a man with the furious instincts of a goaded animal It is almostmore than I can bear to think feel knowthat your whole soul is mine and yet thatwe must part because it would beggar youto link your fate with mine In the fare ofall this when I meet the man the humanbarrier to our happiness -I become a veritable savageThe other night at Harleys stag dinner a man rose and drank to you and himand offered congratulations Carutherswas manly enough to admit that there wasno positive engagement but he said It wastacitly the same thing Then a fellowspoke up and said Of eourse its settledCaruthers The woman never has beenborn who could refuse to marry a man at asacrifice of ten millions in hard cashThe whole party excepting myselfdrank drank to you and him While theywore getting up I left the room I thoughtI was mirnoticed but he had his maliciouseye on me and grinned knowingly As Ilooked bak and saw his taunting face ahorrible nlra crept into my brain Knowingthat you despise him and that they willeventually bend your spirit to the ordealof marriage to him it flashed into myhead that if he were to fall dead where hestood you would oe free we would be liberated Later another thought came thatif he were to fall by my hand and even ifI had to give tp my life in consequence youwould secure jouj inheritance and in theend would find happiness Pardon me darling but I an besde myself to day Barvtinni hates him a cordially as I do I candetect that In his constant allusions to thewill And I am sorry for Bantinni because he is suffering also I have neverliked him before but I love to hear him depounce my rival It is sweet music to myear and the count sees the Injustice to mein it allThe girv did not finish the letter Shewas convinced now of her lovers guiltAgain her headdrooped downward tillit rested oa hef cold aftas She toldherself that indirectly she was to blamefor it all She had really intended tcthrow the inheritance to the windsrather than crucify the purest yearning of her soul and drag the man shradored down into the dregs of despairand she bitterly reproached herself foinot at once acquainting him with thatsecret resolve She had refrained onlynt the earnest request of her solicitorswho begged for time to investigate thelegal status of the matter before sheacted and she had allowed them andher aunt to overpersuade her andnowShe tried to sob out the awful agonypent up within her but her eyes remained dry her torture became moreand more severe She rose and withher hands clasped behind her neck andher head drawn downward she beganto pace to and fro Near the door shewalked into the arms of Mrs WinfretOh darling cried that lady Ithought you were

passages thatHeeds only to be recognized to be removed The causes of the trouble arcnlmost infinite in their variety andsometimes are so trivial in their nature that they are discovered only aftera most painstaking examinationMany volatile substances taken intothe system in the form of food anddrink or as medicine are excreted bythe i ungs and impart an odor to thebreath As familiar

the diseaseupon entering the sickroom before hehas examined the patient Of morepractical interest however are thecauses of a more or less permanent hadbreath in people who are apparently infair health

accomplisheduntil he takes his stand next the riverand looking out over the WallabouJ recalls something of the sad history connected with this little bay and the miseries suffered by our patriot soldiersduring Washingtons battles for a nations freedomHere in October 177u was moored aBritish prison ship the Whitby crowded with American patriot prisonerstermed rebels by the English Sixmonths later two other floating jaiKjoined the Whitby and within a yearboth were burned one in October 177Tthe other in February 1778Although no trustworthy record ofthe facts in the case were kept hundreds of feeble and dying men are believed to have perished in these firesCertain it is that the one in Februaryoccurred in the night when the weather was intensely cold so that if effortswere made to save the prisoners nomore than partial success was possibleIn April 1778 the Falmouth theHope and the infamously famous oldJersey were anchored in the Wallabout and filled with captives from theAmerican armies The severity of theirconfinement was such that more than11000 are believed to have died of coldstarvation and malignant diseasesThe adjacent hillsides now gradeddown and included in the city of Brooklyn became a vast cemetery wherethese brave patriots were hastily piledinto shallow graves and slightly covered with earth In 1808 a tomb wasbuilt to their memory and a greatquantity of their bleached bones werecollected and interred within it withsolemn ceremonies in the presence ofvast throngs of people Over the doorto this structure was inscribedPortal to the Tomb of Patriot Prisoners who died in prison ships duringthe RevolutionIt is not surprising that among sucha host of liberty loving prisoners thereshould have been some who made boldattempts at escape Not many weresuccessful yet by fearful risks andhardships a few eluded their keepersreached home and friends and aftera short rest again joined the patriotforces in the field Of these escapes oneof the boldest was led by a young Connecticut captain Abel Beman a cousinof NathanBeman of Vermont the boywho guided Col Ethan Allen into FortTiconderoga when he captured it fromthe BritishAlthough Abel Beman was a vervsmall man he seemed to condense in hklittle frame the well known strengthand endurance of his almost gigantickinsman which combined with indomitable courage and will was no doubthe reason for his seltction as captainin the colonial army But the qualitiesD f the man were not on the surfacefor at 23 he was as beardless and boyishas a lad of 16 and among his friendswas often called Boy BemanBy some misforutneof war he and hncompany were captured and imprisoned on the Whitby in the Wallabout IHere he bideu his time and lor manymonths watched for an opportunityto escapeMeanwhile he played before theguards the role of a harmless dullwitted fellow and his large hazel ejessmooth face and simple manners gainedfor him many favors sternly refused toother prisoners He was f reel allowedIn every part of the ship and often assisted the guard s in various ways andven handled their guns and accoutrements with innocent familiarityThus ingratiating himself into theironfidence he became converant with the details f his prison andhe methods of the officers and shrewdly studied the temper and efficiency ofach with a view to discovering a wayto freedomA score of plans suggested themselves but thehim were desperate and forbiddingThcve oWiera with loaded nsnslretststood at each end of the ship and a row jvi mem imea tne rail on either sideAround the shores of the bay stretcheda cordon of pickets while several frigates were moor d in he river and bristled with shotted cannon ready to bellow away at any moment But for thevast magnitude of these difficulties hewould have liberated all the prisoneron the Whitby over a thousand in number Indeed one magnificent attempwas made but failedOn a dark night the guards wereovercome and confined below deckwithout a shot or an outcry then theanchors w re lifted and the ship was allowed to drift in the hope that shewould run ashore somewhere and atford an opportunity for the Americansto escape But the rattling of a chaiain raising the anchors reached the earsof the night officer on one of the frigates and before the Whitby had fairlybegun to move a yawl filled with marines came alongside and the undertaking was frustratedBut so enfeebled by rigid confinement and low diet were most of theprisoners that probably many of themwould have perished even had they escaped They had not endurance tomarch across the country to theirfriends Thus it was plain that anyattempt at a general escape would def at itselfFinally Beman decided to include afew only of his harbor comrades andhoped by quietness and swiftness toget off without awaking much opposition To this end he selected theseven of his companions best fitted forthe attempt and rehearsing his plansto them obtained their hearty supportHe had observed that every eveningjust before the change of guards a galley came over from British headquarters in New York bringing a lieutenantwith orders for the night and sometimesletters or wines and delicacies for theofficers of the ship This galley wasmanntd by only two oarsmen who generally while waiting for the lieutenant came on deck to chat with theguards and prisoners and left theircars in the small boatSwung above mens heads over thedeck of -he Whitby and designed forthe bottom of the galley Beman stoodin the stern as steersman todirecttheicourseWith the utmost force and order theypulled away with the tide northwardinto the dense fog Just as they werevanishing from sight cne of the guardson deck discovered them and with acry of Halt there Halt dischargedhis musket at them The next mementseveral guards fired but with such uncertain t on account of the fog that thtfugitives were untouched althoughshots pierced their clothingNow they were concealed in the mistand all was uproar behind them Everyguard was bawling Bebels escapedRebels escaped The officers wererushing about shouting hoarse commands to fire to let down the Whitbysboats and pursue and to do any number of other absurd things The twomen in the water were calling loudlyfor help with nobody to heed themThe prisoners were cheering with mightand main And as soon as word reachedthe nearest frigate her guns began tothunder as she swept with grapehotthe surface of river and shore in thedirection in which the fugitives hadfledBut the Americans were too shrewdto continue their flight in the track ofth se deadly missiles They knew wellthat they would be not on y fired uponbut pursued as soon as the Britishcould man their boats So when thefugitives were fully out of sight in thefog Beman steered the galley directlyacross East river to its western shoreand as it was night by this time theyturned their course in the opposite direction from what their pursuers wouldtake and silently skirting Manhattanisland southward rowed completelyaround the little city of New YorkThis was an extremely hazardousthing to do for the course carried themclose along the front of the Batteryan J under the verv guns of several bifrigates Now and then they werehailed by sentinels from land or shipbut Beman having prepared himself toanswer by questioning guards and officers on the Whitby repied in such away as to avert all suspicionWithin an hour or so the galley struckf aiililiflf lllilit i iWuiiUUinfiuuTuilirijiirr -THEY FLUNG HIM I XTO THE RIVERspecial emergencies were other galleys each of which as our plotting captive had discovered while clamberinginnocently about the place containedoars these might come into play Andhere it should be added that the eightAmericans engaged in the plot were allfamiliar with boats and rowingAll things having been carefullyconsidered Beman awaited a favorableoccasion to undertake the perilous adventureThe chance did not come until onerainy and dismal day late in OctoberFog rendered objects a few rods distantquite invisible The boat from headquarters delayed by the fog and an unusually strong tide was late In reachrinjr the Whitbv and arrived just as theguards were changing The circumstances were favorable a fact forwhich Abel Beman had been inwardlypraying all dayWhen the boat touched the ship theofficer sprang up the side bearing written orders in his hand Shouting backto an oarsman to follow him with abasket brought from the city he hurried to the cabinJust then the day guard was beingcalled away and the night guard toldoir in their places To add to the hasteand confusiionof the scene theoners were purposely restless andnoisy surging about the deck as if tokeep warm and shouting in the mostboisterous mannerWhispering to one of his seven companions a very tall man to reach upand get a pair of oars from a galleyoverhead Beman with a boyish goodnatured smile and a remark to the remaining oarsman sprang over the sideinto the beat Reeling as if about tofall he exclaimed childishly Herecatch hold of my handThe boatman evidently pitying himsprang forward seized his hand andently drew him toward a seat in thestern But this was a fatal

GIFTHe Presents ills Church with mtlsmal Tank That He HadPurloinedMr Smith is an eastern man whoowns some property in and near Chicago His name is not Smith by theway but it is best it should be givenas that as this is a true story a ndthe publication of real names mightkad to a riot Among Smiths holdings is a house on the extreme Southside away out beyond the waterworksdistrict For a couple of years afterSmith got possession of it the housestood empty and the agent Informedthe owner he coud not rent it until itwas modernized with a water supplyThen Mr Smith spent several hundreddollars in piping the building andsupplying it with a large oaken tankor reservoir on the roof This donea tenant was readily obtained and foisome time the house was occupied b3Mr Brown another iictitious namewho paid his rent promptly and contributed liberally to the support of thelocal Baptist churchThere came a time when Brownmoved out and the agent was surprisedone day when Smith the owner walkedin upon him South was In an indignant mood He had been down to inspect his property and the tank wasgoneThats queer said the agent Idont see how such a big tank couldhave been taken off the roof of thehouse without attracting attention andI cant see how it could be put to anyuse that would pay a person to steal itWith the city water service being extended out there no house owner wouldcare to buy it and it certainly wouldve too expensive for tire wood if thethief counted his time worth anythingTne next day being Sunday MrSmith who is also a good Baptist wentinto the local church near his old homeand heard the preacher announce to thecongregation that through the generosity of Mr Brown who had just sailedfor Europe1 the church had been supplied with a capacious baptismal tankRespecting Mr Browns wishescaid the preacher I have kept theaatter quiet and bad the tank put inplace It will be used this morning forthe first time in the baptism ofWhen the baptismal ceremony tookplace Mr Smith went forward with others to the tdgo of the tank The subsequent proceeding had little interestfor him The tank was the missingwater reservoir from the roof of hishouse which had been donated to thechurch by BrownWhat bothers me said Smith in relating the incident is whether baptism is effective when performed in astolen tank If it is I dont wish 1o disturb the church in its possession Ifits not then Ive got a disagreeableduty to perform But what do youthink of Brown anyway ChicagoInter OceanARTISTIC LUNCHESThe Rest Effects Are Produced by theSelection of Some ColorSchemeThe success of a luncheon dependsin great part upon the coloring or prevailing tints employed in the decorations and in such of the eatables as maybe colored to harmonize therewithThe color pastes made by reliable extract makers are perfectly harmlessbeing highly concentrated extracts ofpure fruits and only a little practicewill render one perfectly familiar withtheir use In planning a dinner orluncheon the best effects can be produced by selecting some color schemewhich should be carried out so far aspossible not only in flowers and chinabut in the dishes served When selecting a color the time of year must beconsidered It is not only essential thatthe flowers selected should be in season but that the sreneral color schemeshould be in keeping with the weatheras for example red needs crisp colddays to make the color effective andpleasing and is therefore out of placein late spring or summer Yellowlights up brilliantly combines wellwith other things and is easily carriedout at any time of the year as is pinkThis color decorates especially well andmakes an attractive table The combination of green and white is perhapsthe most appropriate table decorationfor warm weather and the possibilitiesfor change and effect are almost without number The best effects are produced by the most simple effects anddelicate shading In selecting themenu materials must be chosen thatwill conform

Brave Men WhoeWork Counts fur Much ina CampaignOre of the most striking features ofthe whoJe campaign was the pack trainThe packers of the army are very likethe stokers on board a worship Theyare seldom heard of out their work isthe most important of any that is doneThey supply the fundamental requisites and should their work stop thewhole force would suffer They are theheart of the military system and yettheir praises are never sung by poetsand they are seldom mentioned in dispatches They are never seer in parades and reviews and yet to these belong a great portion of the gloryThe packers of the army are evenmore entitled to the praise than are thestokers of the navy for not only is thework of the former the very hardest butthey are compelled to go right up in thefiring line when the battle is at itsheight and where the danger is greatest and unpack ammunition It isreally a remarkable sight to see thesemen and their total indifferree to alldanger at the front during an engagement and very often one or more oftheir mules are shotThe packers are all western men andin a measure used to dangers as thefrontier is the only part of the countrywhere the pack trains are used regularly Consequently there is that picturesque western air about the menThe army mule is the most essentialfeature of campaigning but there areseveral varieties and the pack mule iswithout doubt the most unique and intelligent There are about GO animalsin a full train and these are led by thepatient bellmare a steady wellbroken horse that leads the way andaround whose neck a bell is suspendedThe sound of this bell is the guide themules follow no matter where it leadsThey follow blindly without any otherguide except the constant urging fromthe packers who ride other mules alongin the train The animals wear nobridle except perhaps a halter and yetthey trot along and never stray fromthe trail As long as they are with thetrain they show remarkable intelligence but once take them away fromthe rest ard they are hopelessly lostHorses were very scarce during heSantiago campaign and so a few of thepack animals were impressed intoservice under the saddle 1 was fortunateenough to have one and he waa not theleast of my troubles lie was brandedwith a huge 1V and in every one ofhis adventures he upheld the traditionof that time honored symbol of badluck It was most amusing to see himon the road as he always imaginedthat the pack train was just ahrad andat every bend he would crane his neckto see if the rest of the mules wereahead If he ever bean a bell thatsounded like the one lie had been following he would make for it and nopower could stop him When ridingnear the front I lived in deaelly fear lestsome one in the enemys Hue shouldsound a bell If I ever heard a packtrain coming in he opposite directioni had to climb down and anchor him toa tree or lit- would join itThe packers of this campaign workeddnv and night and no one ever hearuof them getting sick when the feverwas laying
