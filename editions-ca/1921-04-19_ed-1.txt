Sherman Porter, chief prohibition inspector for Kentucky, who hasunder his direction the work 'ofchecking whisky prescriptions. Thatnumber of doctors, who last year had ,permits to prescribe whisky, havedeclined to take out permits thisyear, while several score who tookout 1921 permits and received prescription pads have been turning intheir prescriptions and permits anddeclare that they will not prescribeany more whisky.Activity of the inspector's officein tracing down prescriptions givenfor "coryza," alias a bad cold andother trivial ailments for which it isaseerted there are other and betterremedies, is reported to he the causeof many refusing to take out permits,while others who have never hadtheir prescriptions questioned assertthat it is too rmrch trouble to botherwith. T.he State Board of Health,according to a recent statement byDr. A. T. McCormick, has taken thestand that whisky 'is not necessaryto ihe practice of medicine.Druggists, it was stated, also have"been tiring of the trouble of handling the prohibited liquid and are excluding it from their stocks. Druggists are required to keep almost as"close" books on their whisky supplyas is required in the handling ofmorphine and similar narcotics.. o- :SAYS BLOSSOM TIME NOT ENTIRELY OVERCHILDREN CONTRIBUTE PENNIESTO RELIEF FUND"MY OLD KENTUCKY-HOME"Every Kentuckian at home orabroad is-to have an opportunity tocontribute to the ' popular' fund topurchase "My Old Kentucky Home"at Federal Hill where Stephen C.Foster wrate the greatest state songin the world.
