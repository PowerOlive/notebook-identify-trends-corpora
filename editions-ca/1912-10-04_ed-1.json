is now building a dam on this reserva

Ireland has been prominent as a
Kentucky turfman for many years.

STOCK, CIOP AND FAKM NOTES.
J. E. Boardman, of near Little!
Rock, shipped two cars of export cat
tle to Philadeplhia that averaged 1,400
pounds.
Suckling mules are selling almost
daily everwyhere at prices ranging
from $70 to $110 per head, with some
extra ones4at $125.
Edsell Clarke, of near North Mid
dletown, 'delivered this week to J. E.
Boardman, of Little Rock, a drove of
fancv export cattle, for which he re
ceied $7.50 per hundred pounds. .
A new diease is reported to be
prevalent among the cattle of Hardin
countv. It affects the feet and mouth"
of the cattle. Several people have
contracted the disease from exposure
to the cattle.
The Blue Grass has produced the
best corn in a'decade, as it has all oth
er crops, except that of wheat. The
Blue Grass seed crop was enormous,
oats was fine and heavy, hay was
above the average, potatoes were so
big the soil was lifted to make room
for the growing tubers, orchard pro
ducts were the best in years, while a
big crop of poultry, including turkeys,
are in sight.
Because" scarcity of .fat cattle com
pelled St. Joseph, Mo., to abandon its
annua stock show this year, a record
price of cattle, $11, was established at
Chicago last week. The car load of
cattle for which this price was paid,
was fed with the intention of captur
ing the sweepstakes prize at the St.
Joseph stock show, and when that
event was declared off, the cattle were
brought to Chicago for sale.
Beef cattle, veal, calves, hugs,
sheep, Iambs, milch cows and horses
brought substantially higher prices to
the producers on September 15, last,
than a year before, though hogs and
sheep brought less than two years ago.
This showing, indicative of the rela
tion of agriculture to the high-cost of
living, as made in a report of the De
partment of Agriculture on the aver
age prices of agricultural products.
Fruit brought a slightly decreased
price, and vegetables' average prices
fluctuated.
The meeting called by he tobacco
growers of Owen county fr.r Uctober 1,
in Lexington to consider the proposi
tion of cutting out the tobacco crop
next year, did not materialize. Editor
M. H Bourne, of the Owenton News
Herald, who has been promoting the
movement, accompanied by one or
two growers from Owen county, were
in Xexington but the growers from
otfer sections apparently did not re
spond, and the meeting, like that call
ed by Bath county growers several
weeks ago, did not result in any ac
tion. A 1,000 acre orchard on Muldraugh
Hill in Hardin county, the best fruit
grwoing section in Kentucky, is as
suming the form of aV reality. State
Commissioner of Agriculture J. W.
Newman, of Frankfort, is behind the
movement and will consider the sub
ject as soon as he can draft articles of
a fruit-growing association. The orch
ard will be under the supervision of
the State Agricultural Department.
The farmers of the Muldraugh Hill
section will pledge the land in tracts
ranging from one acre to 100 or more,
while the Argicultural Department
will lurnish free ot cost the trees and
an expert horticulturist to plant, trm
and spray the orchard until it becomes
productive.

Case of Ingratitude.
When Lord B died a person met
an old an wl&jivas one of hismpst

fused, awe-stricken. v$Bvery one was
trying to console him, but in vain.
"His loss," he exclaimed, "does not af

Sad Sequel to Wedding.
A landau in which a newly-married
couple, the chief bridesmaid, and the
"best man" were driving from church
was knocked over by an electric tram
car in Lille, near Paris, the other
morning. "The coachman had his legs
broken, the bride, a girl of twenty-one,
broke her right arm and was badly
hurt in the head, her husband escaped
without a scratch, and the bridesmaid
and "best man" received internal in
juries. Think Human Tears of Value.
In Persia the .past and present are
linked by the belief that human tears
are a remedy for certain diseases. At
every funeral, each mourner is given
a sponge with which to mop off the
eyes and cheeks. After the burial the
wet sponges are given to a priest, who
squeezes the tears into bottles, which
he keeps for curative purposes. This
is one of the most ancient of eastern
customs. See Fifty-sixth Psalm, verse
eight, where David says: "Put thou
my tears into thy bottle." This cus
toi is still followed in Persia. From
Bomb,aughs "Facts and Fancies."

DomMtfc Animals Prottcttd.
The mayor of a little commune in"
the Pyrenees has just issued the fol
lowing decree: "Whereas the young
people of the commune are wont to
meet and dance every Sunday after
mass and the noise they make fright
ens the cocks, hens and other ani
mals of the village and whereas the
result ia prejudicial to agriculture, we
hereby prohibit dancing within the
bounds of the commune during the
hours In which the domestic animals
take their repose."
Children Taught Cobbling.
Cobbling is recognized as a trade In
the vocational schools of Buffalo. Sev
eral schools are set aside for teach
ing trades to young boys and glrl3,
and the latest addition to the course
is one in cobbling. A competent In
structor has been engaged to teach
the young men how to repair shoes.
There are a number taking up the
course, and it is certain that the trade
will not become extinct with the young
generation studying the principles of
rejuvenating old shoes.
i
Depend Wholly on Coffee.
Coffee is the great staple produced
by the civilized Inhabitants of Li
beria, and most of the planters are
totally dependent on it. When the
market price of coffee is so low that
the yield will not pay the cost of
labor and marketing and leave a mar
gin sufficient for the needs of the
planter, the plantations are neglected
and, as 'there is no other crop to fall
back on, a period of economic depres
sion ensues.
