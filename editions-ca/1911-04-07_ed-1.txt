PEMBERTON SLADECopyright by American Pres3 Association,' 1911.Wur special new feature in this planter is that we not only get an accurate number of kernels in each hill, but we get the number of kernels m each hill which thefertility of the soil is able to bring to perfect maturity.No field was ever known to contain exact uniformity in strength of soil. It isiust as unreasonable to expect the same results from thin, weak soil in comparisonwith deep, rich soil, as it is to expect a child to do a man's work. This is a reasonable proposition, particularly to the scientific corn grower.More money is being spent and greater efforts along educational lines are beingmade to-day than ever before in the world's history to increase the yield of corn peracre. We contributed a very large effort to accomplish these results ; with our -BlackHawk single kernel edge drop, and we now add to our combination the No 15 Variable Drop, with which the drop can be changed Jo 2, 3 or 4 kernels m a hill withoutstopping the team; or can drill 7 1-2, 10 or 15 inches, 9, 12 or 17 1-2 inches, or 11, 14or 22 inches apart, without stopping, the team.Hand Drop Attachment with lteach Planter, has Foot Drop also.

He leaned over stillfurther in the most engaging way, anisaid so kindly: 'Would you. mindasking the lady in front of us to remove her hat!' 1 obliged him. T wasgrateful to him fornot asking me' forr 1" ?Mildred and I were about the sameage. We were twenty. I was verymuch in love with her, but I hadn't acent in the world, nor had she. A girlat that age is far more developed thana man of the same years. She seemsto advance quicker but not so far asthe man. I know there are womennowadays -who will not admit this, but1 am not going to stop in my story toargue the point. At all events, whenMildred and I were twenty 1 was stilla boy buildiug castles in the air, whileshe was looking at her and my pres-1 ent and future status in a rationalisticI way.I was going out to China to engagein business anil to live there indefinitely. I was to take a clerkship atthe bottom of the ladder, and I hadnot heard that promotion was veryrapid. I was unreasonable enough tourge Mildred to engage herself to me.Of course she declined, but not forany reason except that she consideredthat an engagement between us underthe circumstances would be unjust toboth."Verv well" 1 said. "Do not consider yourself bound to me. nor will 1consider myself bound to you. but sosure as rbe world turns on its axis 1will return, and if you are free andwilling. I will marry you."So we parted. I went to China determined to attend strictly to the workof advancing myself so that I mightreturn for my love. I wrote her occasionally and received replies to myletters. I was bent on keeping mypromise and strained every nerve toachieve the wherewithal to enable meto do it Cut tiie luck was against me.I had been with a firm five years whenthey failed and went out of business.I found a position with another concern, with which I spent another liveyears. I was just about to' be admitted to the firm as a Junior partnerwhen the head of the house died. Hiswidow insisted on the business beiugwound up that she might get her capital out of It and go home to America.This threw me out again. By thistime 1 had acquired a little capital, jand. putting it with that of anotherman. we went into Wsiness together.Within a year we lost all the capitalof both by speculation. I started inagain with borrowed money and in tenyears found myself with a fortune.I was now forty-two years ,old, andMildred was the same age. For thelast ten years I had heard very littlefrom her. but knew that she had notbeen married. I suppose it was prideor obstinacy, or both, that induced meto go back to America for her. Ofcourse an absence of twenty-two yearsfrom a woman one loves or has lovedmust make quite a difference in hisfeelings for her. It occurred to me,however, that wheu we came togetherwe would -go on from where we left'off. I wrote reminding her that I had ,told her when I separated from herthat 1 would surely some day comeback to marry her and I was nowabout to do so.I received a reply to my letter theday I sailed. Mildred confessed thatshe had been waiting for me all theseyears, since she had believed I wasjust the man to do what I had said Iwould do. "Fortunately," she said,"all my friends tell me that I look tenor a dozen years younger than womenof my age, and there is hope that mypersonal appearance won't shock you."I confess I was greatly agitatedwhen I called on Mildred, sent up myc.ird and waited for her to receive me."When she came in she was naturallyembarrassed. As for me, I was surprised, for she did not look more thantwenty-eight. While she might wellhave changed so much that I wouldnot know her, I saw her just as I remembered her, though a few yearsoiler, and yet not old enough to takeher beyond the pale of young ladyhood. After a separation of more than twode:ades beginning just where we leftoff was impossible. I found that Imust win my love again not that 1 1felt any anxiety as to how my court-,ship would result, but that we were 'both changed. I knew very well thatMildred would not have known mehad she not expected me. Andas forhei, though she was not so changed inappearance as I, there was in herthose other changes that come over usso imperceptibly that one's friends donot notice them unless they are separated from us for long periods. Onechange in her was more marked thanany other. I had left her an extremely matter of fact woman. Increasedyeais seemed to liave developed a" certain ideality that I had not noticedwhen she was younger. But I am inclined to think that every trait thereis in us is developed as we growolder.In a month we were married, sinceI must get back to my business. Theceremony was over when my wife introduced a lady as her older sister. 1was much disconcerted."I remember your younger sisterFlorie, about six years old when I leftAmerica. I never heard of an olderone.""I am Mildred," said the older."And I am Florie." said the younger.I stood mute, looking from the one tothe other. I can't say that any onedefined feeling prevailed.
