A Man-of-war of 1814
The la pregnable of 1814 was of 2278
ions a 93 gun ship by the official rat
ing though her ten carronades brought
iter total battery up to 108 guns She
was therefore by no means one of the
largest ships indeed we had ten of
greater size and force at sea or in re
serve Her heaviest gun was the old 32
pounder smooth bore mounted on the
rudest truck carriage without sights or
elevating screw Her broadside was
1018 pounds Her total crew was
when she was fully manned 743 offi
cers men and boys The men were
raised by impressment or recruited vol
untarily for the ships commission We
hud not as yet adopted our present ad
mirable system of manning the fleet
The discipline was arbitrary and cruel
there were merciless floggings with the
cat for the smallest offenses and the
number of lashes inflicted varied from
-a dozen or half dozen to 500 and even
1000
Beading the court martials of those
days one alternately wonders how the
officers held down the gangs of ruffians
they commanded and how the men en
sured the manifold brutalities of their
officers Brave to a superlative degree
-as these men were with that fiery cour
tage which welcomes battle and death
they cannot compare in quality with
the officers and men who now take our
ships to sea Everywhere except in the
highest ranks where our captains and
admirals are too old the change has
been one wholly for the good Yet it
lias not kept pace with the times and
today our Eailors are poorly paid and
3iot too well fed Nineteenth Century
Edible Coffins
At a very early period the orientals
were familiar with a kind of pastry a
mixture of flour oil and honey and
for centuries pastry making went no
further even among the nations in the
south of Europe But in the beginning
-of the middle ages a change began to
take place in the method of mixing the
ingredients and some other substances
were brought into use Butter eggs
and salt found their way into pastry
making and the result was a manifest
improvement Pasta next came to be
used as an inclosure for meat seasoned
with spices etc Afterward it went a
top further the next use being for the
inclosure of creams fruit preserves
etc and later still it began to take the
many fanciful shapes in which it has
since been commonly found In the
early stages of English cookery the
pastry cases were called coffins or
coffynes and were made in various
sizes from grefc coffynes with lowe
liddesfor the tartes of fflesche to
the smalle coffynes for tartolettes
of fische or fflesche mixed with
stuf of boylled iigges ground and good
powduro and spices
Petruchio in The Taming of the
Shrew it may here be noted calls a
little cap a custard coffin These
coffins correspond with the
vent of today Gentlemans Maga

The Cultus of the Adjective
Everybody nowadays in prose or
poetry claps on an adjective to every
noun It degrades the adjective and en
ervates the noun Then too there is a
host of vulgar overdressed people intro
duced into our company whom we
the old fashioned adjectives hardly
recognize strenuous intense
weird fiery sympathetic
splendid secure naive Im
pressive poignant mostly at
tached too to the wrong nouns There
are too many adjectives and they carry
too much sail like dalilia bedecked
ornate and gay I noticed as an in
stance the other way a criticism in a
French isview the other day of tho
academician sea captain who calls him
self Pierre Loti whose style is so def
ecated I believe that is the term invent
ed by the Postlethwayte school you re
member Postlethwayte that he seldom
or never uses an adjective more star
tling than good bad green
red dark light and soon
and yet so orders his sentence that the
adjective shines out like a rose on a
brier bush Longmans Magazine
Mervousness
This term was first used by a minis
ter of state who affected to ridicule the
warnings of those who were constantly
drawing the attention of the two house3
of parliament to Russias steady ad
vance toward India The term was a
iiappy one in its way but time ere long
proved that the alarmists were correct
nd the said minister so far as I re
member deprecated its being constant
ly brought up against him
This word was coined by the Duke of
Argyll who in a speech in the house
of lords was deriding the well founded
-apprehensions of those who feared that
the Russians would make themselves
masters of Merv in Turkistan They
iook it in 1883 4 Notes and Queries
