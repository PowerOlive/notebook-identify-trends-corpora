Two of the runswere the result of an error and a pass,only one.of tne Hustlers' tallies beingcf the clean cut fashion.McKernan played a star game in thefield for Paris, pulling off two sensational catches, each of which luokedgood for a safe drive. Mayer, Barnett,Maxwell and Chapman hit the ballhard and at the most opportune times.The Hustlers started out, by scoringone run in the first when" Walsh hitsafely, took second on Reed's sacrificeand went to third on Olson's out, scoring when Harrell let Coleman's groun'der get past him.

C. Mayo rich. Of course,everybody but the subsidized andforeign owned Herald knows that Mr.Mayo made his fortjne in EasternKentucky long before the Court ofAppeals and the Supreme Court of theUnited States passed upon the landtitles in Eastern Kentucky.But Mr. Mayo is not a candidate forGovernor or for any other office, buthe reserves the right as a Democrat tosupport the Democratic ticket, and heis doing so in his usual earnest andvigorous fashion.The Herald would like the voters ofEastren Kentucky to believe that thisi decision was rendered "solely by JudgeI O'Rear, but it happened that therewere six other judges on the bench,all of them Democrats, and. that all '.ofI them took the same view of thisduesjion that Judge Q'Reardid, and itjsrajisth unanimous, opinion r of thisCourt, Jaade! up,of six! vDemocr its.' .andone repbuilcan, which was approvedby the United States Supreme Court.! If Mr. Mayo benefited by that decision, then all other land owners v inEastern Kentucky were also , benefited, ijut it cannot bs truthfully .saidthat.

It is likeseeing "home folks"to see Joe Coburnand his men coming up the street forthe yearly concert and the renewal ofold acquaintances.The Macon Telegraph says: "It isalways pleasant to have Joe Coburncome to town. There is no man at thehead of a minstrel company who canboast of more friends than he, and anyman whu tries as hard as he to give aclean, clever minstrel entertainment,deserves it." This paper cordially endorses the Telegraph's statement"always a clean, clever performance,"each season growing bigger and better. Get your seats today at Mitchell& Blakemore's."THE MAN ON THE BOX."The Columbus, Ohio, papers say theabove play pleased their citizens betterthan "The Wolf" and as Manager Porter, of the Grand, has both shows, ourpeople will know what to expect from"The Man On the Box."
