The Ebenezer Presbytery of the
Southern Presbyterian church opened
at the First Presbyterian church Tues
day evening at 7 :30 Several of the
mininsters and elders arrived on the
various trains of Tuesday, though
many did not get in until Wednesday.
The absence of the venerable Dr. H. M.
Scudder, of Carlisle, who died within
the past year, was conspicuous. He
wasfor many years clerk of the Pres
bytery and a familiar figure on the
.floor every time this body met for the
past half century. A fairly good audi
ence was present atthe opening meet
ing. A musical urogram with Miss Lu
cille Dailey presiding at the organ was
good. The sermon was preached by
the Kev. H. M. Moore, pastor of the
Madison street church, at Covington.
Mr. Moore is a new minister in the
Presbtyery, havng been recently in
stalled. His sermon was logical, in
structive and entertaining, taking as a
"basis of his thought "Lite is a Privi
lege," which was ably handled.
At the close of the sermon Mr. Mar
shall McKnight, of Washington, Ky.,
took the chair as Moderator. The roll
call showed quite a nomber of minis
ters and delegates absent, who, how
ever, arrived Wednesday moming.
The selection of Moderator was then
in order. Dr. Cowan, of Auguata,
placed in nomination Dv. Moore, of
Covington. There being no other nom
ination Mr. Moore's nomination was
made unanimous. He accepted the
charge in an appropriate brief address.
The order of program was then briefly
discussed. The Presbytery then took
a recess until 9 p. m., Thursday, as
Wednesday was to be devoted to lay
men's work. The ladies' missionary
meeting of the Ebenezer Presbytery,
which is'being held in conjunction with
the Presbytery, opened Wednesday at
10:30 a. m., a fair audience being
present. The devotional exercises op
ened on time, presided over by Dr. H.
M. Moore, of Covington. Rev. R. S.
Sanders, of the local church, then in
troduced Mr. M. P. Collier, an officer
of his church, who delivered the ad
dress of welcome to the conference.
His address occupied about ten min
utes, and was enjoyed by all who heard
it. He caught the audience in the be
ginning by a few timely illustrations.
Among other things he said he was
glad to welcome this body of Presby
terians. In this age of Presbyterians
that some of the greatest men in all
walks of life were Presbyterians. The
Governor of Kentucky is a Presbyter
ian, as is some of its greatest orators.
After this address the conference
was then organized. Mr. J. B. Noyes,
of Mavsyille, was elected chairman,
and Mr. Horace Taylor of Carlisle,
secretary. Then followed the enroll
ment of delegates after which Dr. H.
H. Sweets, of Louisville, preached the
conference sermon, taking as the sub
ject of his thought "Andrew the
Brother of Simon Peter," picturing
how Andrew had found Jesus, and how
as a quiet man he had gone in and out
of the presence of the Saviour. The
Presbyterian church, he said, had al
ways advocated higher education, as
some of the best school and academies
of the country were in the Presbyter
ian church ; and the Presbyterian
preachers had to be educated men.
He said there was no reason when a
church was without a pastor why an
elder should not go to the altar, read a
chapter, pray, and read a sermon if he
did not have anything in person to say,
and go from the multitude in that
humble way as Andrew had done. A
trend of his thought was the making
of much of the so-called little things in
life.
At 12:15 noon the conference took a
recess until 2:30 p. m, The musical
program in the morning was good,
with Miss Lucille Dailey presiding at
the organ, assisted by a well trained
choir.
The following is a partial list of the
ministers and delegates present: Chief

tions were read by the clerk, most ot

ing foi minor changes in the confes
sion of faith. A communication was
read from Rev. J. B. Tadlock, who
was compelled to retire from the min
istery in the Presbytery on account of
bad health and is now in Virginia.
Dr. Cowan, of Augusta, asked that
the relationship bbetween he and the
Augusta church be desolved. The
matter was laid over until the after
noon session. At 10:30 the Presbytery
took a recess until 11 o'clock, at which
time Dr. Coman, of Augusta, preached
an able sermon, at the close of which

board. The last response was by Rev.

er business was transacted. Another
meeting will be held in October. It is
said there will be something interes
ting to the clubs and fans. According
to i President Neal the Blue Grans
League will come back to its own next
season.
gThe past season-was a bad one for
base ball all over the country snd Jthe
Bluegrass suffered along with the oth
ers. The Paris club is in debt, but
with a good team to begin with next
year, the fans will accord it a hearty
support and there should be no reason
for it not paying out and lay a neat
sum away.

Plan for Perry Centennial.
Tentative plans for Louisville's share
in the Perry victory centennial cele
bration next year and initial steps to
ward the oragnization oflthe Kentucky
Perry Celebration Association, to have
charge of Kentucky's observance 'of
the centennial, were made last. week.
Indications are that the celebration
will be carried out on a more gigantic
scale than anything ever undertaken
in Louisville. Due'credit is being ac
corded Kentucky by the Perry Centen
nial Commiassioners for her part in
the war of 1812. and that they looked
especially to this state to take a large
part in the$big celebration. The Per
ry centennial, rather than being a rec
ognition of a great victory, was to be
a peace celebration, in which all the
English speaking countries Lwould par
ticipate.
The whole week will be a -round of
industrial, educational and historical
pageants. Newport, Lexington, Har
rodsburg. Frankfort, Paris, Danville
and other Kentucky cities will have a
part in these parades and the Kentucky
Historical Society and similar organi
zations will be invited to have a mu
seum in the city during the week. The
museumfas planned will be open to the
public. The battle of Lake Erie will
be reproduced.

farm, which imght mean hundreds of
dollars to ambitious boys all over the
State. Conceiving the idea that pea
nuts might prove a lucrative product,
Silas Jenkins 13 years old, took his
little Shetland pony and harrowed and
plowed a half acre of ground on the

just a bushel of the nuts as seed, and
the result is eighteen bushels of "the
great circus .fru5t."
As far as the weather will permit
the growers of Bourbon county are
rushing their tobacco into the houses
this week for fear of frost. The cold
weather, together with light showers
is causing all ot the producers who
have not housed their "tobacco, much
apprehension. Much of the weed is
too green to cut and full one third of
the total crop of Bourbon Jis standing
in the fields. The rains have started
it to growing again and unless the
next week affords seasonable weather
for cutting and housing the remainder
of the crop there is likely to be consid
erable loss from frost.
Corn cutting in this county is in
progress and manv fields have been

ring the summer a number of silos

with corn which provides an excellent
feed for stock in winter, easily acces
aable doing away with much labor on
the farm during the cold winter and
upon which stock thrives wonderfully
The silo is becoming very popular
among the farmers of Bourbon county
and the number was more than dou
bled the past summer

riculture of the State University.plans

tabished in each county and the farm
ers be taught modern methods with
out leaving their homes.
It is sought to put the system of ag
ricultural instruction practically on
the basis of the present public school
system, and each county can have a ag
ricultural instructor who will devote
his attention exclusively to that coun
ty, and each group of twelve counties
will have a superisor to whom the in
structors report and the supervisors
will in turn report through one of the
three main divisions into which the
work has been divided to the director
of agricultural extension at the College
of Agriculture at State University.
