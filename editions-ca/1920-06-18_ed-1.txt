What is to be done?XParis Chautauqua Week July 6th to 13thDAMAGED "BY RECENT STORMSThe recent heavy rains that fellthroughou the county, accompaniedby tnunder and electrical storms,have done a large amount of damage, according to farmers who werein the city Saturday. In manyplaces the rains washed the tobaccofields that had just been set out,necessitating replanting and aheavy expense, owing to the scarcity of labor and the high wages being paid for that class of farm work.During one of the storms a largetobacco barn under construction onthe farm of Chas. N. Peddicord, onthe Clintonville .pike, near Paris,was totally demolished. Creekswere out of their banks, makingthe eighth "high stasre of watersince last November. All over thecounty fields were badly washed,and fencing along the banks ofstreams were washed away. 'oe!ealth board notice.tHot weather is now here. Keepmanure heaps removed each eightdays.

S. Millikin inleminiscences of the Maysville-Lex-ingtonpike. "One of Edmond Martin's grandsons married the daughter of Rev. C. F. Oney. When inMillersburg on a visit, I took dinner with him. He resided in hisfather's old home, a large brickdwelling on a farm about a milenorth of Millersburg. It was thereThat Gen. Santa Anna spent thenight. He was the Mexican general who fought against GeneralTaylor in the battle of Buena Vista,Mexico, where so many Kentucklins were slain."1 remember James G. Blaine,who taught a military school at theBlue Lick Springs. I enjoyed seeing him drill his pupils. He had inthis school the drummer who beatthe drum at the battle of BuenaVista."I loved to see the great loads offreight that were hauled on broadtread wigons, drawn by six andsometimes eight horses. Boy like, Ienjoyed seeing the stage come rolling into the Lick, drawn by fourhorses going in a lope! This stagewas usually full of passengers withsome on top. That was beforethere was any railroad built toParis.
