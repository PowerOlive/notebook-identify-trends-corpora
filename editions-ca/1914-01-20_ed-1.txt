TheGeneral Assembly starts on the thirdweek of the session fully organizedin both branches and ready for theserious business before it. Already198 bills have been introduced in theHouse and 104 hate been offered inthe Senate, all of them having beenreferred to committees, so that withthe consideration of these measuresalone and the other hearings, investigations and "probes" already authorized the coming legislative weekought to be a busy one and furnishplenty of interest to the people of theState.The "extra help" proposition is still"up in the air" with' the outcomeproblematical. The resolution is nowbefore Gov. McCreary, and there is apresistent rumor afloat that he willnot approve it, but allow it to becomeeffective without his signature. Eventhen there is the usual talk that theState Auditor will decline to issuewarrants for the py of the "extrahelp," or that if he does it will be Jstopped by mandamus proceedings.WOULD HANDICAP BUSINESSLeaders in both branches of theGeneral Assembly declare that if the"extra help" is not provided it wilfseriously retard the work of the Legislature This week will witness an increaseof one in the Democratic membership of the House, to-morrow havingbeen set for the special order, the report of the committee in the contestof N. C. Tilford, Democrat, againstYaman Watkins, Republican, involving the seat from Grayson County.The committee has reported unanimously in favor unseating Watkins,and awarding the seat to Col. Tilford.Everything has been set for theusual junketing trips this week of thelegislative committees to visit thecharitable and penal institutions, but-the Houbo having "set its foot," do.ru ton this has "balled up" the prqgfam..Most cl the 302 bills already introduced in the Senate and House areexpected to be printed and on thedesks of the members before theweek is well under way, and thencommitte meetings will be in order.i Several important measures navebeen introduced and the hearings onthese promise to bu. spirited and interesting. The mosr important "dry"measure so far offered is the ForestSenate bill providing that 25 per cent,of voters of the entire county maycall a loral option election under thepresent founty unit law instead of 25per cent, of the voters of each precinct in the county, as the presentlaw prescribes.There is also a movement amongsome of the leaders xo put the "softpedal" on some of the numerous investigations and "probes" on theground that the proper distinction isnot being drawn between an inspection of the various departmets, bureaus and institutions to learn of theiractual needs and requirements onwhich to base the i-mount of appropriations they are entitled to, and an"investigation or probe," which theysay naturally carries the inference ofirregulai ities and wrongdoing.SALE;if.Now Going On ;.Everything in OurReduced.Store- -4 jt:iMitchell & Blakemore,The Store for Men's StylesParis, KentuckymmsmmanBiiiiiiiiniiuiruztimiiutitinjninniriiiiiiiiiTninxmmmtKiuMMmm&HnmwjMWHHjmVFRANK &, COThe Store Where Reliability Rdgas.-y i.JANUARY"Thought wave" marriages may befollowed by "second wave" divorcesin New York's high society circles.CLEARANCE SALEANDMAT COHEN'S 3IL1.

Potter, Associate Fore, J. S. Forest Service, made an adess before the National Woodgrows' Association, at Salt Lake CitjI said that the question of mein1- invoked in the methods ograzing on the National forests. He.d,uj the statement that, oveazed ranges can be improvecker through Use than they couLif thev were left idle.He points out that the forage rerceo on the National forebts reprf. a valuable asset upon which nomly the welfare of the stockmen deads, but that of a large proportionthe people. The task of the Govnment has been to work out a plar.'hich would develop this resourceid promote its use to the fullest exnt without harming tree growth.During the first three years of adlinistration, from 1905-7, the problemf the service was to take care o.reas which had been badly overgrazd, and a material reductionhad toe stopped. From the very beginnng, the forest service invited thecooperation of the stockmen and conulted with them regarding the pracicability of the plans which were toje adopted. This co-operation was;secured through ,the various stock-"growers associations and it was sosuccessful that similar associationsiave grown up among other users of-he National forests.Before range control was put intoeffect, thu feed belonged to the manwho got his stock on the land first,though there was.no way by which hecould hold it except by physical force.Under such a system might maderight, and the only thought was toget what feed there was while itlasted This condition led to seriouscontroversy and out of it grew therange wars which often resulted inloss of life and property. Under thepresent control, right prevails, and,jhad nothing elsebeen accomplished,Mr. Potter says, the removal of this"'no, evil alone Would have made theMe.v.... '- 'vnd stateswork worm r.But he goes still fiirtnv,that the systematic-use "'ortu,has stopped loss of forage and tnatitt-the feed formerly wasted has beenputting the stock in better condition,with the result that, in many cases,the Stockmen have been able to sellbeef and mutton, direct from theranges where they were before producing only animals which had to befed and conditioned before they couldbe put on the market.He called attention to the experiments of the Government in artificially re-srcling the grazing areas tocultivated grasses, and showed thatin some cases the forage crop hasbeen increased as much as 400 percent. He maintained, however, thatthis method is both slow and expensive and said that the great part ofthe range lands must be improved byprotection and natural re-seeding, forthe next 20 years at least. He says,too, that investigations have established beyond a doubt that naturalreseeding can be accomplished bestby a rotation system of grazing based upon the simple principle thatgrazing aids in scattering and planting the seed after the seed has beengiven an opportunity to mature. Reports show that areas protected until after seed maturity and then graz-J ed, as compared with areas absolutelyprotected for the whole year againstgrazing, are approximately ou percent, better, and probably 200 percent, better than range which has notibeen protected at all. This meansj that ranges can be improved faster int use than they can be in idleness andI the principle w feeing adopted onmany of the forests.He also spoke of the new open, sysI tern of handling sheep, which is sim-t nlTt nnlafm ViorrUnc rliii-inc fh ilnvand bedding the sheep where nightovertakes them. He contrasts thiswith the old plan of herding sheepclose by the use of dogs and returning them each night to a fixed bedground. The old plan, of course, rendered certain areas absolutely bareand the going from and returning toj the bed grounds trampled a great deallof forage, He estimates that an in-crease1 of 10 to 20 per cent, hag beenadded to the carrying capacity of thej ranges and that 5 pounds weight hasoeen aaaeu per iarao because theyhave not been b&r&Ssed by herding orforced to trail Kmg distances to andfrom hed gre&lids. On 5,000,000 lambsthis mea&S 25.000.000 nonnrtff flriftariHo the sheepmen's salable product,an& tb the country's meat supply,i . H'6 gave an amusing instance of a1 'Government experiment in whinh itl Was attempted to ''try out the oldalongside of the new system, but itwas tound impossible to secure a- sheep owner who would return to theoia metnod, except through a bonus.The change in handling has been inlarge part responsible for the building up of the Madison forest, whichthere enabled an increase in the number of sheep grazed from 90,000 to107,000, with promises of further increases of several thousand.One objection to the new method ofhandling sheep brought up by manyowners nas been that the herders whowere used to the close system wouldnot adopt the new one. The associate forester,, says that herders naturally take a pride in having theirsheep look well and that since theyare coming to realize that open herding means better sheep, they voluntarily adopt it.In conclusion, Mr. Potter mentionedother studies and experiments whichthe forest service is undertaking tohelp stock growers secure a betterutilization of the forest resources andsaid that the success secured in thework has been dire largely to thehearty co-operation of the stockmen.When you find an oysterIn an oyster stew,You can bet your hottom dollarIt wasn't meant for you.All was quiet in the oyster house.Anly occasionally came the plaintiveeep of. a restless clam or the- snarll a turned over fishcake.But suddenly all was uproar andonfusion, as a man at one of the-ar tables had leaped to his feet and,vith horror writ large on his features,fas racing about and yelling withfear."What? What is .?"But he could make no answer, butnerely pointed with a shaking handit his half-finished oyster stew. -"Bring ..that there stew here!" thenanager ordered one of the, waiters.'But the waiter backed fearfullyiway."Excuse me," he said. "I don'tknow what's in it.""Volunteers!" exclaimed the manager. "Who will bring that stew tome?"Not a soul stirred. The tall mankept yelling with fear and pointing."What was in it? What? What?What was in it?" they insisted.Somebody forced a tumblerful ofbrandy flown Tiis throat, and he stopped celling and told them."An' oyster!" he exclaimed.KENTUCKY JAILERS HOLD 'THEIR ANNUAL MEETINGThe Kentucky Jailers' Associationheld its seventh annual session inFrankfort, Thursday, and elected officers as follows: J.

Thewater is poured carefully into thesand until it reaches the point of overflowing. The volume of water removed from the second vessel represents approximately the proportion ofclay needed.The proper propor'on of sand andclay can best be determined, however, as the work progresses, as someclay will contain more sand than others. In fact, clays are very frequently found which already contain aboutthe right proportion of sandIf the road to be treated is sandy,the surface is first leveled off andcrowned with a road machine, thecrown being about one-half inch tothe foot from the center to the sides.The clay is then dumped on the surface and carefully spread, so that itwill be from 6 to 8 inches in depthat the center, and gradually decreasing in depth towards the sides A.layer of clean sand is then usuallyadded, which is thoroughly mixedwith the clay, either by traffic or bymeans of plows and disk or tooth harrows. The best results have been obtained by thoroubhly mixing or puddlingthe materials when wet. For this reason, it is desirable teiat the mixing bedone in wet weather. Themixing canbe left to the traffic after the materials have been properly placed, butthis involves a wnole winter andspring of bad road, and even then themixing is not always satisfactory. Inall cases, it is advisable to dress theroad with a road machine or splitlog drag after the materials have beenthoroughly mixed, n.nd to give It acrown of not more than I inch or lessthan' inch to the foot from the center to tho sides. A light coating ofsand may be added. The use of theroad machine or drag should be continued at frequent intervals until the1 surface is smooth and firm.If the road to be treated is com-J I posed of clay, it should first bej brought to a rough grade with a road,machine. The surface should then2 be plowed and thoroughly pulverizedby harrowing to a depth of about 4inches afler which it is given aZ crown or slope of about one-half inch Ji to the foot from the center of the2 . sides. It is then covered with 6 to 8inches of clean, sharp sand, which isspread tliicker in the center than atthe sidc3. The materials shouldcountry of origin to be free fromdangerous diseases and insect pestscovered hy the quarantine, and musthave been grown in a district free'rom the wart disease and the powdery scab. The new regulations de5ne the exact conditions under whichsuch disease-free potatoes will be adniitted. The regulations, in general, besides-describing the exact forms of notifying the Government of shipments,provide for the admission, under the'nspection systeiri, of potatoes from11 countries not under quarantine.Such countries must, however, maintain effective quarantines of theirown against infected countries; i. e.,countries remaining under quarantineby the United States.The regulations also provide for thelifting of the quarintine as to anycountries covered by the quarintineupon the presentation of satisfactoryevidence to the Secretary of Agriculture that such country ,, or well-defineddistricts thereof, is free from injurious potato disease and insect pests,and, after the quarantine has beenthus lifted, potatoes will be admittedfrom such country or district in accordance with the regulations governing entry of potatoes from countrienot now under quarantine. Thecountries now thus quarantined areNewfoundland, the islands of St.Pierre and Mlquelon, Great Britain,deluding England, Scotland andWales,, Ireland Continental Europeand the Dominion of Canada. It isexpected that from iome of these, atleast, it will be possible in the nearfuture to lift the quarantine and permit the entry of potatoes therefromunder the conditions prescribed inthe regulations.CALENDARS FOR 1i15.We have made arrangements withthe Hayes Lithographing Co., of Buffalo, N.

It is well acted bySeigmann as "The Ivlan" and IreneHunt as "The Woman."The woman is a society girl, andthe man is a stoker on a steamer.They are washed ashore on a smallisland in the Pacific when their vessel is wrecked, and are the only human beings there. The girl at firstfears the man, because she realizesthat she is absolutely in his power,but gradually she 'changes her attitude. Freed of the trammeling conventions of human society she fallsin love with the man. When theyare resqued after several months theman tells the girl tnathewill go backto the stoke hole and she will behailed as a heroine. It turns out ashe says, and the picture closes withthe woman in her palatial home,thinking wistfully of the happy dayson the tropic island, and hoping thatthe man will make good as he promised and some day come to her."The Occult," (American) Featuring Sydney Ayer.
