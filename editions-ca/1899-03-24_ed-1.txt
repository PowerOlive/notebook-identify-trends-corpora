his dignity to show theslightest courtesy to any of the guests ofthe house Mr Coup as all who knew himwill confirm was a polished man of theworld totally careless of money never complaining but accustomed to punctiliousservice He bumped against the majesticruler of the register several times and endured his affronts in silence At last he toldme quietly to secure quarters at anotherhotel which I was only too glad to do Ireported that arrangements had been madeand he went down to settle our accountWhat is our bill Mr King he askedsuavely My names not King snapped theclerk and proceeded

DYEDMatural Btaok byAHWHAT OLD AGE EANSChange in the Body ThatVroiij lit by the Pbkiny YearsArcIn the study of living forms fromthe protozoa to the mammal andfrom the protophytesi to the seedplants we find certain changes anaeonditions characteristic of old ageIn the human subject the principalchanges which we note are atrophicand U generative in their nature Themuscles and glands are the parts moreespecially involved in senile atrephyalthough other soft parts are afft etecto some extent T1k re is a dimunitionin size of the cellular elements thoughwithout involving any essential changein their structure The muscularfibers become small and are said totake on more uniformity of size whilethe spleen and lymphatic glauds undergo a remarkable dimunition inweight and size which increases as ageadvances There is also some shrinking in volume of the glandular structures of the digestive tract Wl ereverfat has accumulated it graduallywastes away It is amid that atrophybegins to take place before degeneration commences Pigmentary andfatty infiltrations of the element arecommon as are also calcaeercus incrustations As an instance of the location of his fattv defenerationmuscular fibers both voluntary andinvoluntary might be mentioned Itis also four in blood vessels especially the terminal arteries of the brainand to some extent in the nerve cellsand in the parenchyma of glandularorgans Pigmentary infiltration it isclaimed is not so frequently met withas is fatty infiltration In the pinealgland in ligaments cartilages tendons and the walls of arteries calcareous deposits are common In thebrain and spinal cord the neuralgia increases until it frequently predominates over the nervous element andthere is a tendency to the depositionof amylaceous bodies in these partsThe fatty elements of the brain arediminished while the water and phosphorus are ncreasied in quantityThe height and weight of the bodyon account of these changes are diminished the bfidv as a whole short-er and lighter while its individualparts are also lessened in size with theexception o the heart and kidneysThe heart 5s a rule is hypertrophiedwhile the kidneys are at least the sizethey were in middle life Changes takeplace in the skin rendering it dry andwrinkled the hair becomes thin andwhite the eeth drop out the bodybendsThese changes induce a general decrease in vigor the power of the muscles is lessened the combustion goingn in the body is diminished as isshown by a decrease in the amount ofcarbonic acid gas exhaled The vitalcapacity of the lungs is decreased although there is a quickening of therespiratory rhythm The pulse raterses the secretions are diminishedand the quantity of urine is less Suchbriefly stilted are some of the characteristics cf old age This period oflife is more liable to certain diseasesas those due tfl arteiio sclerosi to certain forms o rheumatism and goutand so onWhat prodvees these changes in thebody which drag us dowti to thegrave Is th re no way to retard orprevent them If we could obviatethem even ir a measure how greatwould be the benefit and with what rejoicing would the earths inhabitantshail the discovery especially thoseamong them nho have begun to enterthe shadows which gather about lifesevening In the cycle through whicha portion of the material world revolvesfrom the organic to the inorganic from the living to the dead andback agaip to the living it would appear that as old age approaches thej material of the animal bodv takes enmore and more the nature of the inorganic and becomes more and moreakin to the mineral world When aiindividual tart in life he appears tobe endowed with a certain power orability to maintain his status in thehighly organized animal world and toresist largely the tendency of his tissues to become in their chemical nature more nearly akin to the mineralkingdomWhat this ppaPei O atata in I do notknow but it seems to be greatly impaired by age Now if by introducing into the bojy certain agents whichmight render the excess of accumulating mineral matter more soluble sothat it could be more easily eliminatedfrom the body we might get rid of oneelement that contributesj largely tothe deterioration and degenerationthat come witti old ace Ajrain allanimal and vegetable tissues -whenyoung possess n a large measure thisresistance toward the changes thattake plaee in senility Then whvwould it not be a feasible and rationidea for thow who are approachingthe period of life when senile changebegin to make their appearance totake as nourishment only the tissuesof young animals and vegetables andthereby supplement their waning pouer of resistance with that of those organisms which contain it in abundance And also as we now have aprocess of treating certain diseasedconditions of different organs of thebody with the products of the corresponding organs of animal bodies andI believe with some success whycould benefit not be derived by admin-istering the quintessence of the organsof young and healthy animals to thosewhose bodies are beginning to showthe effects of age and in that way furnish them artificially with the powerto resist the encroachments of timeTwo or three times a year for instance we might adrninisterthis treatment for a week or two at a time andvho can say that we might not retardin this way the capture of lifes citadelI by the king of the gJja and
