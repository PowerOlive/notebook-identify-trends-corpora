precisely what the manner of agentleman should be under such circumstance deferential and wfholly unpresuming That she should ever meethim again she was altogether too practical to imagine but the picture ofhim which had remained with her forthe very vagueness of its outlines hadalways had strong hold upon her fancyIn the extravagance of youths delightin adventure she had liked to magnifythe romance of the episode by endowingthe hero with every grace until unconsciously to herself he had developed toan ideal altogether transcending thecommon run of menLnd jiow in a moment the fair godwas

the first impulse sheturned to go back up the hill but witha second thought she stopxed againperplexedly studying the situationOne small cabin somewhat apart fromthe other buildings of the mine she instinctively settled upon as Neils private quarters and she was half disposedto ride up to the door forthwith andboldly tender him this bit of his equipment of which she so keenly longed tobe rid but with reflection appeared adozen reasons why she should not dothat not fhe least of which was hernervous dread of again encounteringNeil himself She must return thehandkerchief by some messenger

her mother she hadbeen taken to live in the old familyhome at Brooklyn her father had beento her as a- fairy prince whose occasional visits had meant lavish gifts andunlimited indulgence She had beenfond of him in frank childish selfishness for what he did rather than whathe was to her after the canny methodof children who see so much of thatto which they are supposed to be blindhalf guessing at the incompatibilitywhich led her parents to dwell so muchapart and instinctively divining somewhat of the jealous regard of each forBier by means of which she might asit were pit one against the other toattain her own small ends As shegrew older the colonel always handsome and debonair gradually assumeda good humored elder brother attitudewhich perhaps the girl appreciated themore for the peevish fretfulness whichhad grown upon the invalid motherwith passing years Her father al-though as she well knew naturally ofcholeric temper was to her generallyamiable and always carelessly indulgent He sometimes ventured upon ad-vice or criticism occasionally even car-rvinc interference so far as to tease herto the verge of tears by his rather merciless gift of satire but he never seemedto dream of demanding any actualobedience to his wishes He appearedto regard her indeed as a somewhatinteresting young woman whose acquaintance on the whole he quite enjoyed but whose conduct he consideredrather outside the limit of his legitimate jurisdictionThis easy going -attitude the girl hadfound very pleasant in the time theyhad been together since her mothersdeath He made it clear that he likedto have her with him but he was alsoat pains f o have her understand that herown wishes were to have full weight indetermining all her movements Whentheir plan of going abroad in the earlysummer had been broken up the colonelhad been at some trouble to mitigateher disapointement by proposing thepleasantest possible alternatives Shemight have gone to any of the fashionable resorts of the east under thechaperonage of a convenient relativebut she knew that he was pleased whenshe elected to go with him to Coloradoinstead and even more pleased to hearher speak of it as going home Underhis cool nonchalant reserve she knewthat he was really fond of her reallyanxious to make her happy but thoughin turn she was intensely loyal in herdevotion to him she could not disguise Lfrom herself the fact that in a way theystill were almost strangersHe looked up and saw her after a moment but beyond a brief nod conveying some surprise as well as a certainshade of disapproval he gave her nofurther attention for the time goingou with his talk with McCready thesuperintendeni who also looked outto greet the girl with a smiling familiarity which she secretly resented Hewas a tall muscular fellow of some 30years his face presenting a certain typeof coarse bucolic good looks of whichhe seemed consciouscarrying himself with an air of complacent egotism which to Dorothy madehim almost insufferableWell you make a paying trip of itthis afternoon sure he was sayingwhen presently he accompanied thecolonel down the steps If youve gotBrigham solid its about all we wantWell I guess weve got him thecolonel rejoined stopping on the laststep to button his gloves He was afine looking man of the sandy hairedruddy blond type carrying his thinwiry form with an alert militarygrace which cheated time of no less thanten good years in the visible record ofhis age There was conscious strengthin the glance of his cold gray eyesstubborn will power in the thin lippedmonth half covered by a

with frank irritationYes I had to come she nonchalantly returned in no whit disturbed by hispassing jeevishness I hope I did notkeep you waitingAs it never entered my mind thatydu would be here at all in view of therain I can assure you that you certainlydid not he answered his tone stillcaustic but his face softening somewhat as he looked up at her youthfulloveliness glowing from her ride Heturned away to get his horse which wasfastened to a post at one side while thesuperintendent came on to speak toMiss MeredithYoure your fathers own daughterMiss Meredith he observed bold admiration in his small shifty eyes Ittakes moren a cloudburst to stop youwhen you set out to do a thing Andthe colonel Id like to see the cyclonethat would feaze himThe girl smiled vaguely in recognition of the intended compliment hereyes following her fathers movementsIt was quite a storm she remarkedfeeling that the pause demanded speechof some sortYou bet it was a corker Mr McCready cordially agreed whereat thegirl smiled in a way that made himdully conscious of the coarseness of hisclothes of the redness of his largehands of such awkwardness in hiswhole make up as filled him with hotunreasoning

heightby three feet in width and bears thefollowing inscription in rudely carvedcharacters1773DAVID EVERHARTWas Born in OctoberMurdered Sept 22 1810There is -a tragic story connectedwith the death of Everhart that waswell known to The generation that hasall but passed away and in this mannerhas been handed down to the presenttimeEverhart came to Kentucky fromNorth Carolina with a party of adventurers and for a time they dwelt inBockcastle county whither they hadbeen attracted by the fabulous storiesof Swifts silver mine said to have beenlocated in that section of the stateTradition speaks of Everhart as a wilddissipated man who was wholly without fear and as a gambler who wouldstake his life upon the turn of a cardEverhart and his companions erectednear where the railroad water tank nowstands at Broadhead a rude log shantyremnants of which are yet to be seenFrom there they would daily sally forthto prospect for silver One of theparty a man by the name of Wise hadwith him his daugter Mary who is saidto have been a girl of rare beautyEverhart and Cyrus Thomas weresuitors for the girls favors but herfickleness kept each of them in uncertainty and in this way a fierce enmitywas engendered between these twomen Finally they agreed to play agame of cards for tthe possession of thegirl the loser not only to renounce anyclaim he might have upon her but wasto take his departure from the countryalsoThis arrangement was agreed to byall parties and the momentous gamewas played in the log shanty after thedays work was done the girl herselfbeing a witness to it An exciting gameit was too both men keeping well together until the final deal when Everhart turned a winning trump whichgave him the game and the girlThis angered Thomas and he sprangupon Everhart stabbing him with aglittering knife At this juncture thelights were extinguished and no one ofcourse knows exactly what happenedbut passers by the shanty next morning discovered Everharts body coveredwith wounds lying upon the thresholdHis companions had disappeared andwere never heard of againThe dead man was buried in the lonely spot spoken of above and some yearsaf terward his relatives in North Carolina caused the rude stone to be erected which marks the grave to day Oneremarkable feature in connection withthe last resting place of the unfortunate man is that the grave has neversunk a foot in all the years since it wasfirst filled This is no surprise to thesuperstitious mountaineers howeverwho aver that a murdered mans gravenever sinks -The vicinity of the lone grave is saidto be

JNoone has ever had the courage to approach the spot- near enough to solvethe mystery It is also told that ashadowy man bearing a coffin uponhis shoulders emerges once a year fromthe old orchard and

TO JAILFool Legislation in North CarolinaWill Result in This If Enforced1 Norlth Carolina is not the only statethat has trouble in the collection of itstaxes from people against whom theyaic assessed but the commonwealthhas a legislature that undertook to furnish a remedy and has done it in a waythat may involve both the state and itsdelinquent taxpayers in some troubleThe new law directs the sheriffs of thecounties by whom the taxes are collected to report to the criminal courtthe names of all persons who havefailed to pay their taxes within a specifiedtime when they are to be adjudgedguilty of a misdemeanor and liable toa fine of 500 or to imprisonment in thecounty jail for a term not exceedingsix monthsThe new law was to go into effect onSeptember 1 a date before the farmershad marketed their cotton and thererfore a- vast majority of them wxraldf beunable to meet the demands of thesheriff There is quite a commotion inthe state and the attorney general hasbeen called upon for an opinion as tothe constitutionality of the law in response to which he has given two legal opinions one of which declares thelaw to be valid as to all taxes and theother that it can apply only to licensesThe result is that this lucid attempt tostraddle the question has involved it instill greater uncertaintyFrom present appearances it is evident that the law will fail because thereis not jail room enough in the jails tohold one tenth of those who may badelinquents on the first of the monthwhile neither the judges of the crinvinal courts will dare to impose ithe pecuniary punishment provided by lawnor would the sheriffs be able to collectthe- fines if the courts decreed themThe experience North Carolina is having with hasty and ill considered legislation is not peculiar to that state andmany of the laws on thestatute booksof many of the states known as dead xletter laws are of this variety of legislation The laws are too dead and toogenerally unobserved to be worth thetrouble of repealing them ChicagoNews-England as DcayBy an unfortunate juxtaposition ofwords and emblems England is unintentionally depicted in the new con-gressional library as a

indreaming- it when I wore my hair solong and my dress so intentionally neglige that the street boys greeted me asShikespeare when I was poor anda socialist and a sentimentalist and hadplenty of time to fritter away I usedto be a regular attendant at the Monday- iiopular concerts I was too poor totake a reserved seat and too enthusiastic to be content with a bad one Inever failed therefore to be at the sidedoor of St James hall so early that Ihad little difficulty week by week insecuring my favorite place in the frontrow of the orchestra Truly after thescramble in getting in it seemed atfirst but a sorry tedious business tosit waiting for an hour until the conceit-began The evening paper wassoon read and the ceaseless vchattersind restlessness that prevailed on everyjhand did not allow of any pleasure inmore solid reading but I soon found5n the fellow creatures who surroundedme ample amusement and food for reflectionThere were others who worshippedas devotedly as I at the shrine of musicwho came as early to St James halland got their seats almost as regularlys I got mine every Monday evening-during the season There were twogirls in particular whom I soon came1c look for quite eagerly They usually sat immediately behind me and Ibecame a silent party to all the gossipthey retailed to all the confidencesthey exchanged I knew the prices oftheir hats how much a yard they gavefor their winter gowns and for howlong they wore the same pair of glovesMoreover I learnt that sequins hadgone out of fashion that an eveningIbodice is more becoming cut square-than cut round and that crinklyJhair pins stop in much better thanistraight ones It was a revelation tome a youth destitute of sisters tohear what girls talk about and how theyseem to look at the affairs of this complex life through a medium of millinery These two addresed one another as Grace and Muriel variedby dear and I gathered that theywere bosom friends whose sole opportunity of meeting during the week was-afforded by theMonday Pops Oneof them it transpired was a studentat the Itoyal College of Music a violinist the other I took to be a schoolmistress But after all it was not theyso much as a third personof whom they constantly talked that-excited in me the profound est curiosityI remember well the first time I heardof Helen Ambrose It was one eveningwhen Grace was rather late in arriving at the hall and Muriel had hadto go through a good deal of maneuvering in order to keep a seat for herfriend a circumstance which had notimproved her temper nor mine eitherfor in her shuffling endeavors to occupytwo seats at once Miss Muriel had unintentionally dealt me several nastykicks in the back However in thosedays I was more accustomed to kicksthan to the proverbial alternativehapence When at length the latecomer appeared it was evident that shewas in a state of intense excitementScarcely had she clambered to her placebefore she burst forth breathlesslyMuriel what do you think Youllnever guess Who do you think is intownFm sure I dont know Put your hatstraight WhoHelenNo exclaimed Muriel with anamazement that must have satisfiedher informants appetite for creating asensation Why has she come Isshe going -to make her debut at lastHow on earth did she manage it Haveyou seen her or heard from herOne question at a time please Ihavent either seen or heard from herAs you know she has dropped me Shehas come I imagine in pursuit of JackHow she managed it is a more difficultproblem to solve But did you everjenow Helm set her heart on a thingand not get it Penniless as she nowis she seems to have retainedculiaritvCome in pursuit of your brotherJack came from Muriel in a dazedinterrogative I didnt know sheknew him Lou always said you meantto keep him at a safe distance and thatso far they had never metVO bother 1 didnt mean to tell youthat but as Ive told you so much younit3as well know the rest It wasntmy fault -their meeting I did my bestto prevent it It was fate It all happened in the strangest way Last summer Jack set his heart on having amonth in Scotland Finances didntadmit of his taking a holiday pure andsimple so he advertised for a locumtenens in a bcottisk country townspecifying certain The-conditions result was an offer of old Dr Slaterspractice in Peatburn of all places inthe world which he accepted Thenwithout word from me he reinembered thai I had friends in that part ofthe world and one day shortly beforebe went to take possession he said tonne 7 say- Grace isnt that place inSep ti and where you used to sfay somewhere near Peatburn If your friendsare worth knowing you might give meintroduction I knew what the result would be if I did And much as Iadmired Helen as a friend I alwaysthought her too clever by half for asister-in-law so I got out of the difficulty by telling him what after allwas perfectly true that there was onlymother and daughter now that thefather had died lately leaving them miserably poor and that they were not byway of entertaining just then Hemerely said 0 all right It doesntmatter Im not particularly keen onother peoples friends On the wholeI prefer to make my own And I heardno more on the subjectBut I suppose your precautions wereuselessYes as soon as Helen found thatthere was a young doctor to be had instead of an old one she sprained herankle or got her mother to fall ill Iforget which Perhaps though its ashame to say that for shes not whatyou would call a vulgar schemer Shedoes everything so gracefully that Inever know whether she is genuine ornot but somehow she has workedhavoc with so many hearts that I canthelp feeling it must be her fault as wellas their misfortune I didnt tell youabout it before because I know you dislike Helen and I have a lingering fondness for her in spite of the way she hastreated me And I didnt want to giveyou fresh cause for abusing herI should certainly be sorry to have abrother of mine entangled with HelenAmbrose What does Jack think ofO infatuated of course like everyman who sets eyes on that wonderfulface He came home very badly underthe spellI am surprised at that You know Inever could see anything so very remarkable in Helen Besides if anyonecould take care of himself in such circumstances I should have said thatperson was your brother JackI cant altogether agree with youI admit that Jack is not susceptible butthere isnt a doubt that Helen is desperately fascinating As Jack saysthere is a certain subtlety about herthat sets her apart from the ordinaryrun of frank English girls He complains that we are all so pitiably obvious She is exactly the girl to attract him Is that your new jacketYes how do you like itf Good fitisnt it said Muriel with complaisance and added caustically returningto the subject of Helen Its my opinion shes so subtle that she deceivesherself as well as everybody elsePerhaps Well the idea is that MrsAmbrose has some mysterious complaint and has come up to town to seea specialist Jack is utilized to selecthim and to give advice about privatehospitals nurses and so forthAnd who is to pay the doctors billAh thats the point It will be ratherawkwardi for Jack if they do anythingshady They seem to be living prettyextravagantly too Theyve taken aflat in Ashley Gardens which is oddi inpeople supposed to be reduced to ah income of 150 a yearThere was a moments pause ThnGrace began again impressivelyyou know Muriel I never had any actual reason for distrusting Helen butits a most curious fact that whenJack came back from Scotland- full ofher I found that she had never eventold him she knew me nor mentionedthat she had been at the collegeAnd havent you told himNo I thought I would wait and seewhat turn things were going to takeMuriel sighed Before the conversation could be resumed a thunder ofapplause broke out Lady Halle appeared upon the platform followed bythe rest of the quartette and the concert beganPoor Jack exclaimed Grace oneevening a few weeks after the foregoing conversation had taken placeHe is looking perfectly wretchedHave you toldi him yet that Helenis the friend you used to stay with nearPeatburn asked MurielNo and she has never disclosed ourfriendship though of course she mustknow that Jack is my brotherShe is extraordinaryWhen she ceased writing to me Iwondered whether she meant to dropme entirely as I found she had droppedall her other student friends one byone And now it is pretty clear thatthat is her intention She seens to havegiven up all idea of the profession tooin spite of needing money so desperately as they must with all this expenseFancy Jack has never heard her singalthough he is continually at their flatdidnt even know she had a voiceReally What does it all meanIt makes me simply boil with indignation to think of that girl who threeyears ago was the rising star amongsingers envied by every girl at thecollege and idolized by every manin the place calmly chucking thewhole thing With such a career before her Just think not only that marvelous voice but such brilliance too inother ways and that irresistible magnetic personalityWell you know I never could feelthatSo you say But you never came directly under her influenceIm glad to say I didnt BiitT wasthe only girl in the Students home ofwhom that can be said I preferred notto sell my soul to a witch Im gladyou see through her at last You and Jshould never have become such friendsif Helen Ambrose had not retired f ronithe scene I couldnt stand you whenyou were always raving about herMe rave That was nothing You-should hear Jack -I hope he does it in less faulty English thn you doOh pray dear spare me thegogue Its years since I left schoolHere comes the quartette Its Schuberts Death and theMaiden Ifyoihave a shred of soul left in your school-uouc uuuy you n iorget tnat ypireer gave a grammar lesson in yourflife-The following week Grace told herfriend in audible undertones that jackTRE BOUEBON NEWS PAY SEPTEMBER 17 1897had asked Helen to be his wife and hadmet with refusal but no adequate ex iplanation had accompanied it Theyoung man had admitted to his slsterthat he had urged his suit more thanonce for in spite of her rejection of it Jhe dared to believe that Helen caredforhim She merely said that it was impossible for her to marry him and thatshe would rather not give a reason Bydint of much persuasion however hegot her to say that she must for thepresent devote her life to nursing andsupporting her invalid motherI rather fancy that kind of extremepenury that is compatible with an expensive journey to London from thewilds of Scotland consultations withtwo of the most celebrated doctors inthe world and a sumptuous flat off Victoria street was Graces sarcastic comment If it is necessary for her tosupport her mother why doesnt shelet herself be heard at a few concertsThey would soon have plenty of moneythen to pay for all the luxuries theyseem to indulge inHow is she supposed to be earning aliving asked MurielI havent a notion Jack says thathe thinks she gives lessons of some sortbut that he doesnt pry He offered tolee the mother come and live with themif Helen would consent to marry himbut she only shook her head Yesterday he asked me if I would go and callon her Of course I was obliged to refuse And then I told him what friendsHelen and I used to be and asked if hecould imagine why she had concealedthe fact from him all the timeDidnt that open his eyesHe turned very pale but he onlysaid No doubt Helen has some goodreason I will ask her to come and seeyou if you wont go and see herAnd did he do soYesWellShe answered that she went nowherenowShe does though I saw herthe other night at the theater it was Borneoand Juliet at the Lyceum She was sitting in the front row of the dress

the name ofMiss Helen Ambrose appearing on thebills as a vocalist bef pre many weeksshould pass But the concert seasonwas virtually over besides the girlwould no doubt devote a period tomourning for her mother and mustneed rest from the labors of nursingI was not surprised- therefore thatthis new star did not shine out in themusical firmament During the nextfew months I scanned the marriage column in my daily paper with more thanusual care but no announcement thatI found there gave tidings of a unionbetween Jack and HelenAbout a year later I rashly acceptedan invitation to an evening party givenby some musical friends at HempsteadI went rather late naturally expectingto be bored When I arrived a violinsolo was going on and I had to wait tillit came to an end before my name

is counted asone of the four things doing the greatest injury to the vineyards of California The bulletin gives an interestingaccount of the life history of this injurious insect and goes on to suggestremedies some of which may toe of interest to our readers It is stated thatsome growers believe that the hoppermay be kept in subjection by sheepdng the vineyard Sheep are turnedinto the vineyards after the fruit ispicked and permitted to eat down theDEVICE FOR JABBING INSECTSleaves This method is considered ineffective as are also the methods ofburying- the leaves and spraying in winiterSummer spraying is said to be aneffectual process but is costly and difficult The insect is very active and dnorder to kill it a very strong and penetrating wash like kerosene emulsionmust be used Jarring is consideredone of the best remedies when tried dnthe spring- and under certain conditions Fig 1 shows certain contrivances that are used in jarring Thescoop or shovel is held up against thevine to hold the hoppers which aredriven down by striking with a stickAnother way to fight the pest consistsIn using a plain palm leaf fan dipped inA NET FOR INSECTSa sticky mixture like thick molassesand water The fan is held under thevine with one hand while with thethe operator strikes the leaves so asto knock the hoppers down upon thefan An insect net shown at Fig 2 isalso used With this the vine is jarredand as the insects fly a few skillfulstrokes with the net will catch mostof them and they may be crushed oremptied into keroseneTxof PToodworth says that the netand the fan methods are the only oneswhich are at all practical for summeruse He observed that nearly 90 percent of the hoppers were killed by thenet method while working with a ganglarge enough to cover about five acresa day About half of the gang of menwere green hands part white and partChinese and at the rate of wages thecost per acre would be between 15 and20 cents Thisis an illustration of -thevalue of scientific agricultural workSuch pests are sure to come The average farmer cannot afford time andstudy needed to understand how tofight such insects or diseases Thereinust be scientific men

be saving ofhis cows as a cow well cared for will bea useful and profitable animal for several years longer than one ill fed illhoused and ill treatedEven in summer cows should not boleft exposed to violent rainstorms butshould be sheltered where there is lessdanger of their being struck by lightning as when huddled together undertrees or being chilled by a prolongeddrenching The latter especially isdamaging- to the milk yield for I havenoticed that cows always shrink inmilk after exposure to a storm Wiseeconomy calls for measures that willobviate this namely a dry warm shelterBe saving also of your feed For instance in giving- milch stock corn fodder when they trample it under theirhoofs and waste as much as they eat itis the dairyman who is wasteful notthe animals I find that the mosteconomical way of feeding corn fodderis to spread it before the cattle when instanchions and only give them whatthey will -eat tip cleanTo be -saving of the feed in the pastures dont put more stock into thefield thandt will support On a farm notlong ago I heard them talking- aboutthe cow pasture horse pasture sheeppasture and calf lot I knew the ownerwas on the right track as it impliedthat he kept his stock separated Milchcows never do as well when compelledto pasture dn common with other cattleThen again do not waste the milkEven a drop of milk which may represent the growth of one grass root cannot afford to be wasted In the firstplace secure all of the milk from thecows udder by patient stripping Therichest comes last and you cannot afford to lose even a dropIt is not a stingy course to see that themilk pails pans cans etc are wellcleaned and that your hired hands areso land to the cows that the animals donot frequently kick over the milk pailsand spill the fluid Perhaps the mosteffcient way to save milk is to preserveits quality so well that none is wastedby souring or tainting-Be saving of the butter you makeIn figuring on a good yield of butterfrom the cream do not make the mistake of mixing some of the casein ofmilk in with the butter fat This isdone by skimming loppered milk underthe supposition that it is economywhen it really is the grossest extravagance for you can never make firstclass butter that wayRemember that milk cream and butter saved is money earned so exercisewise economy in all branches of dairying George E Newell in

in her lower limbs She was going toschool and had to walk about three quarters of a mile each day going through allkinds of weather She was thirteen yearsold and doing so well in her studies that Idisliked to take her from school but we hadto do itFor several months she was confined tothe house and she grew pale and dwindleddown to almost nothing Her legs and armswere drawn up and her appearance wasEitiful Several doctors had attended herut it seemed that none of them did herany good They advised us to take her tothe springs but times were so hard we couldnot afford it although we finally managedto get her to the Martinsville baths Hereshe grew suddenly weaker and it seemedthat she could not stand it but she becamebetter and it seemed that she was beingbenefited but she suddenly grew worse andwe had to bring her homeShe lingered along and last winter became worse again and was afflicted with anervous trouble almost like the St Vitusdance For some time we thought she woulddie and the physicians gave her up Whenshe was at her worst a neighbor came inwith a box of Dr Williams Pink Pills forPale People and wanted us to try them asthey were advertised to be good for suchcases and her daughter had used them fornervousness with such good results that shethought they micht help MabelWe tried them The first box helpedher some and after she had taken threeboxes she

human and of course areliable to make mistakes but their mistakes are too fatal to be indulged inpromiscuously and as so many lives aresacrificed in this manner it is but naturalfor the public to believe that half theoperations are unnecessary besides being a fearful risk to human life even ifsuccessfulIt is a positive fact however that alloperations are not necessary and that amajority of them are absolutely undertaken without the slightest chance ofsuccess The doctors have never beenable to enre a blood disease and a surgical operation -is their only method oftreating deep seated cases such as cancer and scrofulous affections Asidefrom the great danger an operationnever did and never will cure cancer asthe disease never fails to return Cancer is in the blood and common senseleaches anyone that no disease can becut from the bloodHere is a case where the pain inflictedon a sis-year-old boy was especiallycruel and after undergoing the torturesproduced by the surgeons knife he rapidly grew worse Mr J N Murdochthe father of the boy residing at 279Snodgrass street Dallas Texas writesWhen my son Will was six yearsold a small sore appeared on his lipwhich did not yield to the usual treatment but before long began to grow Itgave him a great deal of pain and continued to spread He was treated byseveral good doctors who said he hadcancer and advised that an operationwas necessaryAfter much reluctance we consentedand they cut down to the jaw bonewhich they scraped The operation wasa severe one but I thought it was theonly hope for my boy Before a greatwhile the cancer returned and began togrow rapidly We gave him many remedies without relief and finally upon theadvice of a friend decided to try SSSSwifts Specific and with the secondbottle he began to improve After twentybottles had been taken the cancer disappeared entirely and he was curedThe cure was a permanent one for he isnow seventeen years old and has neverhad a sign of the

woman I ever saw vwhotalked frankly about that subjectSo long as they dont ignoremeshe said I dont care what they writeLet them say anything so long aslheysay it but it would be horrible to beleft aloneThat was a very truthful statementof her own opinions and almostnparalleled in its frankness Everybodyknows that Mrs Potter has never fhadvery much to thank the newspapers forthat was really pleasant but shoshadplenty to be grateful for as long as shewas willing they should print anythingif it kept her in the public eyeAlmost as genuine was a youngAmerican singer who came back hereafter she had made a debut and somelittle reputation in Europe Sbewjas apretty woman and she had a good voicebut she was unfortunate Once sheiiada sore throat and another time shewasout of condition for some other reasonAt all events she was never in condition to do herself justice So therewasnothing pleasant that even with thekindest intentions the newspapers couldsay about the young woman One nighttoward the close of the season shewasin a grand tier bos at the opera houseDuring one of the entractes she waswalking about the foyer with a friendand halted in front of the greenroomWhat is that room her friend askedPlanting herself deliberately mfront of the partly opened curtains shesaid in a voice audible to every man inthe room Oh that is the place theygo to write in the most disagreeableway they can the most disagreeablethings they can think of about youThe younger singer was unjust but shehad no false vanity She was willing tohave it known that she read what thenewspapers said about her Her moreillustrious colleagues are not always sowilling to admit thatI have heard Mile Calve protestthat she never saw any newspaper butthe Paris Figaro and declare that shereally had not the slightest ideawhatNew York papers wrote about herShesaid this one day while waiting outsideof Maurice Grans office at theMetropolitan and then turning suddenly toa reporter standing near her asked if hewas the man that wrote she had signeda contract to give some concerts at2000 a night when she was really toreceive 2200 The man did not understand French so Mile Calves companion translated the question intoEnglish The man replied that he represented another newspaper and whenshe turned this into French for MileCalve she mentioned the name qi thenewspaper from which she had hadtranslated the dreadfully erroneousparagraph which had led the public tobelieve that Mile Calve had consentedto take 200 less than she was to getMine Eames has an indicated indifference for what the newspapers saywhich is sometimes a little bit difficultto reconcile with her intimate knowledge of what they publish about herMme Melba is also familiar withthem and she is a little less averse tohaving that fact known than MmeEames is It is well known that MmeNordica takes her press clippings withher coffee and she makes no bones ofit Jean de Reszke is a regular readerof what the newspapers have tb sayabout him and whatever he may thinkabout it in reality he never butdn oneinstance took any notice of it Planconenjoys reading the agreeable thingsthat are written about him and doesntcare who knows it Only the womenprofess to bo wholly ignorant of whatthe newspapers writeWith the actresses the case is verymuch the same The celebrated foreigners according to their own accountsare quite unacquainted with anythingthat the American press may writeabout them Agnes Sorma said that shedid not intend to read any of the criticisms of her work until she startedhome on the steamer It didnt take aconversation of more than three minutes to show that she had a fairly accurate knowledge of everything thathad been printed about her It musthave been some superior sort of clairvoyance that is possible only to the artistic temperament for hadnt she saidthat none of them would be read untilshe had got on the steamer to go to Europe Sarah Bernhardt has them alltranslated to her and accompanies theperformance with more or less emphaticreflections on the intelligence of thewriters who do hot agree with hex ownideas of what she does It is said thatthe atmosphere of the Hoffruaii Housewas heavily charged with brimstone forseveral days after Mme Sarah had theNew York accounts of ker performanceof Magda read aloud to her Jin English When the American actors
