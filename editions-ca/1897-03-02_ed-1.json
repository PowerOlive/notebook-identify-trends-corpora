THE BOURBON NEWST TUESDAY MARCH 2 1897
THE MALAYS SNAKE
One hot- morning in June weanchored
off Belize From the masthead rwatched
the fish in the drifting gulf weed not no
ticing a tar bucket hanging near me till a
swell struck the ship and my head struck
the bucket and dashed the tar all over my
white duck suit
The slop ohest a cask containing
clothing which the seamen are allowed to
purchase at any time being empty I
could hope for no assistance from that
quarter and so there was no alternative
left me except that of wearing my tar
daubed suit until I could wash rinse
and dry a labor at which to tell the
truth I was never very expert the clothes
in the washtub
As many of my shipmates would have
done under similar circumstances in race
after the manner of mankind at large I
bestowed a number of wrathful blows and
a number of forcible expletives upon the
poor bucket as if that was to blame and
should be punished for the accident which
was the result of my own carelessness
When I was relieved from the masthead
I descended to the deck in no very pleasant
frame of mind and rolling up my shirt
sleeves made my way directly to the tub
in which I had left my clothes
A Malay a man of 30 with a long face
and nose and small twinkling black
eyes sat upon the windlass bit watching
me in such a peculiar manner that I stop
ped thinking he wished to say something
to me
He turned aside his head however as
our glances met and looked to leeward
He and I were not on very good terms
as I had interfered on the previous day to
prevent him from pounding our libtle cabin
boys head with a crowbar He had sworn
eternal enmity to me from that moment
and I doubted not that he would seek to
injure mo before we quitted the ship
The cabin boy entertained the same opin
ion
Look out for him he had said
Check is a viper and may try to poison
you with some of those curious liquids
locked up in his ohest
Never fear I had answered I shall
keep a sharp lookout
I could not help shudderinghowever
as I thought of the singular andhorrible
curiosities in my enemys chest
He had been a juggler in his native coun
try and the trunk contained among other
things several bleached skulls a number
of poisoned arrows and a large bottle in
whioh were three or four small spotted ser
pents
Aye aye hes a singular fellow this
Check I now muttered as I moved on
toward the tub What could have been
the meaning of that curious look he gave
me There was a treacherous malicious
sparkle in that eye of hiswhioh I did not
fancy
So saying I stooped over the tub and
was about to thrust my arms in it when I
was prevented by the voice of the captain
So it was you was it thats been a
wasting all that ere water he cried
Glad I caught you Jest take Check and
another and the yawl and reckonoyster the
shore for some fresh water and dont be all
day about it
There was no use of my attempting to
explain that it was salt water that I had
used for my ablutions The tanks were
empty and the skipper had evidently been
waiting to set upon somebody
And I was the unhappy fellow picked
out to row along shore in the hot sun to
sniff out a spring
I bad some work to get a chum to go
with me but the lanky Malay jumped at
the offer
We searched along shore for a good
while and yet had spied no fresh water
pouring into the bay The season was
against us
At last we came near getting aground
thanks to the swell that was rising when
as 1 had the boat hook in hand and my
mate his oar the Malay sitting on the
thwart doing nothing the latter began
whistling between his teeth
Now it is all very well for a man to take
his ease when he can but when he wont
be satisfied with that but whistles over it
tauntingly it provokes a man
So I turned round going to talk to
him like a father when whish some
thing long and horrible darted by the side
of my head and my mate tumbled back
astern
That action of mine had saved my good
for nothing life for the Malay had whis
tled the snake out of the covert and I
stood in its line of motion
As it was my messmates stumbling aft
caused him to lose his balance and fall
backward into the boat
Never shall I forget the wild horrible
cry that burst from his lips as he quickly
lifted his head from the bilge iniwhich it
had been submerged
He tossed his arms wildly about started
to his feet and a moment after5 fell writh
ing in strong convulsions
Why confound you what is the matter
with you exclaimed my mate but drew
back a cry of terror bursting from his lips
There lay the unfortunate Malay with
protruding tongue bursting eyeballs and
livid countenance rolling over and over
and vainly striving to disengage from his
neck a deadly snake which had coiled
about it and was now darting with forked
tongue its venomous poison into his flesh
The struggles of the unfortunate man
were of brief duration and while land my
companion hacked and pounded the serpent
to pieces the death rattle sounded in the
victims throat and with one farewell gasp
he rolled over on his back and expired
i My mate Tom Squid now threw his
t hands around my neck
You have had a very narrow escape
said he and I will praise the high ad
I miral all my life for saving you as he has
j done
So ought I Tom said I It certain
ly was lucky that my turning Tound to
jaw the beggar was the means of sparing
me from the doom he lured on himself
The big snake was brought aboard and
every one had his stare at it when it was
U d over the side after which the re
i us of the Malay were consigned to the
i in tne usual manner New xorK
