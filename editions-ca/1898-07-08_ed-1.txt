of all was not made publicTip to 1 oclock It is at great lengthcovering five or six typewritten sheetsof telegraph paper Briefly and semiofficially its contents were summed upas followsGent Shafter made a demand for thesurrender of Santiago This was atfirst refused by the Spanish comxnahderi but the demand was apparent-ly taken under consideration GenShafters notice was that lie would beg-inthe bombarding- of the city Tuesday unless the surrender was madeFearing1 the awful results of bombardment the representatives of foreigncountries at Santiago assembledand asked that another day be givenfor the women children and non-combatantsto be taken out of the city Itis thought under the circumstancesthat Gen Shafter would give a reasonable time for the removal of the women and children At all events a periodof inaction followed with the expectation that the surrender will be madeTuesday or else that the bombardmentwill beginThe news from Dewey was equallystirring in character His official dispatch bore the Hong Kong- date ofJuly 4 although it came from CaviteJuly 1 It told not only of the arrivalof the first expedition but of the capture of Guan Ladrone islands with itsand

GenPando Outers the City WithOver 6000 SpaniardsWashington July G There was nobombardment of Santiago Tuesday andpossibly will not be during the presentweek This is the opinion of membersof the cabinet as expressed on leavingthe White House after the cabinet meeting Secretary Alger and SecretaryLong- have been in almost constantcommunication with Gen Shafter andAdmiral Sampson upon the situationand the conclusion has been reachedthat it would not be advisableto attempt to carry the city of Santiago by storm with our present forcesGen Shafter in a dispatch receivedMonday night confirmed the reportthat Gen Pando with 0000 Spaniardshad arrived in the city andwere already distributed amongthe fortifications This reinforcement makes the Spanish forces defending the city from 10000 to 1S000The very great advantage of being intrenched adds materially to theirstrength and in the opinion of military men makes their effective fighting force from a third to ahalf greater than our own GenShafter in his dispatches statesthat the excessive heat and rainsof the last two weeks have contributed nearly as much as the Spanish bullets to the ineffectiveness of ourarmy Under these circumstances itis his opinion that it would be unwiseto attempt to carry the city by assaultThis view is shared by the officialshere and also it is understood by AdmSampson in command of the fleetAt the cabinet meeting thepresident directed that telegrams be sent to Gen Shafterand Adm Sampson suggesting- thatthev confer as to the situation andparticularly as to the advisability olthe admirals attempt to force a passage into Santiago bay and so he in aposition to render effective aid in theassault upon the city It is known tobe Gen Shafters desire to havethe fleet enter the harbor Orderswere also given looking to theimmediate dispatch of troop shipsfrom Tampa with reinforcements forShafter and others now off Santiagowill be brought here at the earliestpossible moment to aid in the transportation of reinforcements It isprobable tbab at least 15000 will besent forward as rapidly as transportation can be provided Thus augmented there seems to be nodoubt the forces under GenShafter will be able to stormand take the city without delayThese are the views entertained bymembers of the cabinet who talkedfreely Tuesday on the subject Nevertheless the orders under which boththe army and navy are now operatinggive the commanders wide discretionand it is not doubted that shouldchanged circumstances seem to warrant it an aggressive movement willbe begunA senator who talked with the milita officials said there was no doubtof the outcome if the American fleetcould get inside the harbor and thusplace the city between the land and senbombardmentsThe arrival at Santiago of GenPando with reinforcements for Linares occasioned some comment on thecourse of Gen Garcia and his Cubantroops in not holding Pando back particularly in view of the fact that GenLawtons brigade was co operatingwith Garcia but it is believed the latter left Lawton in an embarrassed position At the same time the disposition of the authorities was mainly omeet the situation now presentedrather than to question how it cameabout In meeting it the most activesteps toward getting large reinforcements to Gen Shafter were in progressGen Garretsons Command Off for

Shape But IJeautiful inColor A Specimen 3Yow at theXcw Yorlc AqunrlumAmong- a number of fish lately received at the aquarium is a lump fishfrom Gravesend bay The lump fish isungainly in shape and clumsy in actionbut its coloring- makes it beautifulLooked at broadside on its outline issomething like lhat of a flat fish butin the cross section the lump fish issomething like a tall triangle runningup to a point at the top and oeingthickest near the lower part of thebody while almost flat across the bellyOn the under part of the body just backof the head the lump fish has a suckingdisk by means of which it attaches itself to rocks or anjr other object Sometimes it lies on the bottom It has asmall head and mouth and little eyesThe lump fish is sometimes screenand sometimes brown in color The onenow at the aquarium which is abouthalf grown and six or seven inches inlength is a green fish On some partsof the body the green shades into graybut green is the fishs distinguishingcolor shading- from a coppery greeninto a paler tint and so into the grayThe colors are not dull but they are-without lusterThe aquarium has had at differenttimes two or three lump fish before thisone but none of them lived long It isa fish difficult to keep in captivity andnone of those here before could be persuaded to eat This one however iseating with a pretty fair appetite Itlives at present on shrimps which arepartly stunned before placing them inthe water which makes it easier for thelump fish to get them It eats shrimpsin nature when it gets a chance closing up on them gradually when theylie motionless on a stone or spile andfinally with a sudden motion nabbingthem It would do it here if it had achance As it is Ihe shrimp are fed to itThe lump fish is perhaps attached byits disk to the side of the tank near thebottom A deadened shrimp is droppedinto the water at the top The lumpfish appears to know instantly of itsrpresence it inches up a little on theside of the tank still however keeping its hold But the shrimp continuesto drop down straight through the water and the lump fish waits for it Theshrimp comes so close that thefish can get it by bending its headto one side without letting go ButOther shrimps may have a little morelife and drop through the water beyondreach and the lump fish lets go andswims off to get them most likely coming back to attach itself to the wallagain but up nearer the topThe lump fish is slow in movementand not quick in its eating The shrimpis naturally very quick in its movements as is shown here in a curiousway A shrimp that had been pariallystunned and had been taken in by thelump fish recovered its stiength in thefishs mouth and before it had beenswallowed and before the languid fishcould close its mouth the shrimp had-flashed

attempthas been made to counteract the destructive forces by stouter protectionsin forts and by a system of tactics thatreplaces the old solid formations withsomething like the skirmish order offormer

said Silver when we werealone if I saved your life you savedmine and Ill not forget it I seen thedoctor waving you to run for it withthe tail of my eye I did and I seen yousay no -as plain as hearing Jim thatsone to you This -is the first glint ofhope I had since the attack failed andI owe it you And now Jim wereto go in for this here treasure huntingwith scaled orders too and I dont likeit and you and me must stick closeback to back like and well save ournecks in spite o fate and fortuneJust then a man hailed us from thefire that breakfast was ready -and wewere soon seated here and there aboutthe sand over biscuit and fried junkThey had lighted a fire fit to roast anox and it was now grown so hot thatthey could only approach it from thewindward and even there not withoutprecaution In the same wasteful spirit they had cooked I suppose threetimes more than we could eat and oneof them witli an empty laugh threwwhat was left into the fire which blazedand roared again over this unusual fuelI never in my life saw men tso carelessof the morrow hand to mouth is theonly word that can describe their wajof doing and iwhat with wasted foodand sleeping sentries though they werebold enough for a brush and be donewith it I could see their entire unfitnessfor anything like a prolonged campaignEven Silver eating away with CaptFlint upon his shoulder had not a wordof blame for their recklessness Andthis the more surprised me for Ithought he had never shown himselfso cunning as he did thenAy mates said he its lucky youhave Barbecue to think for youwiththis here head I got what I wanted Idid Sure enough they have the shipWhere they have it I dont know yetbut once we hit the treasure well haveto jump about and find out And thenmates us that has the boats I reckonhas the upper handThus he kept running on with hismouth full of the hot bacon thus herestored their hopeand confidence andI more than suspect repaired his ownat the same timeAs for hostage he continuedthats his last talk I guess with themhe loves so dear Ive got my piece onews and thanky to him for that butits over and done Ill takehim in aline when we go treasure himtirig forwell keep him like so much gold incase of accidents you mark and in thftmeantime once got the ship andtreasureboth and off to sea like jollycompanions why then well talk MrHawkins over we will and well givehim his share to be sure for all hiskindnessIt was no wonder the men were in agood humor now For my part I wTashorribly cast down Should the schemehe had now sketched prove feasible Silver already doubly a traitor would nothesitate to adopt it He had still a footin either camp and there was no doubthe would prefer -wealth and freedomwith the pirates to a bare escape fromhanging which was the best he had tohope on our sideXay and even if things so fell putthat he was1 forced to keep his faithwith Dr Livesey even then what danger lay before us What a moment thatwould be when thesuspieions of his followers turned to certainty and he andI should have to fightr for dear lifehe a cripple and I a boy against fivestrong tmd active seamenAdd to this double apprehension themystery that still hung over the behavior of my friends their unexplaineddesertion of the stockade their inexplicable cession of the chart or harderstill to understand the doctors lastwarning to Silver Look out forsqualls when you find it and ytfu

shovels for that had been the very firstnecessary they brought ashore fromthe Hispaniola others laden withpork bread and brandy for the middaymeal All the stores I observed camefrom our stock and I could see thetruth of Silvers words the night beforeHad he not struck a bargain with thedoctor he and his mutineers desertedby the ship must have been driven tosubsist on clea water and the proceedsof their hunt tig Water would havebeen little to their taste a sailor is notusually a good shot and besides allthat when they were so short of eatables it was not likely they would bevery flush of powder sWell thus equipped we all set out-even the fellow with the broken headwho should certainly have kept in shafujiXTmow and straggled one after anotherto the beach where the two gigs awaited us Even these bore trace of thedrunken folly of the pirates one in abroken thwart and both in their muddled unbailed condition Both were tobe carried along with us for the sake ofsafety and so with our numbers divided between them we set forth uponthe bosom of the anchoraereAs we pulled over there was somediscussion on the chart The red crosswas of course far too large to be aguide and the tsrms of

of the Iowa agricuhural college has been making aspecial study of the methods for harnessing a horse so as to get the best results It is an old and popular idea hesays that a loaded wagon will draweasier when the greater part of the loadis placed over the front wheels As arule the horse will do his work moreeasily if he is placed near it there being less lost motion The driver alsowill be able to keep his operations morecompletely under his control In thecase just cited the opposite of the general supposition is true This is due toa difference in the size of the fore andhind wheels The surface over whicha load is drawn being more or less thicky set with obstacles over which thewheels nnist pass it stands to reasonthat a wheel with a diameter of five feetwill be much more easily raised over agiven obstacle than will one of fourfeet the leverage being so much greater in the first case If we suppose theload brought to a curbstone six inchesin height over which it must be raisedthe lead en the five foot wheels will bebrought over one third easier than anequal load on the four foot wheels because the leverage in the first case isone third greater It must not be supposed however that the present tendency toward low wheeled wagons is amove altogether in the wrong directionfor the greater width of tire preventingthe wheel from sinking so deeply intcsoft ground lessening the height tcwhich the load must be lifted helps tcounterbalance the evil tendencyJournal of AgricultureDOCTORS EXPERIENCEIllinois Physician Has an AdventureThat Should Teach CountryPeople a LessonThe

did not think much ofthemI finally was induced to try the pills andcommenced using them After taking a fewdoses I found much relief I do not remember how many boxes of the pills I used butI used them
