spects one of the most pleasant and
satisfactory sessions of the present
administration. The boarding depart
ment was filled to its capaciy and a
number turned away last fall, and the
attendance during the entire session
has been more than any year since I
have had charge of the college. Dur
ing the whole scholistic year we have
been almost absolutely free from sick
ness of every kind and the ouLlook for
next year is most encouraging.

Flagged Train With Shirt.
Tearing his shirt from his back an
Ohio man flagged a train and saved ifc
rrom a wreck, but H. T. Alston, Ral
eigh, jST. C, once prevented a wreck
with Electrict Bitters. "I was in a
terrible plight when I began to use
them," he writes, "my stomach,
head, back and kidneys were all bad
ly atfected and my liver was in bad
condition, but four bottles of Electric
Bitteis made me fell like anew man."
A trial will convince you of their
matchless merit for any stomach,

N. H.. Rankin, ofJNicholas, haa pur
chased from W. J. Fuller, a Nicholas
county farmer, a mule colt, which was
born on his farm near Carlisle, which
is a real curiosity.. The colt is now
twelve days old, is prefect in every

Health a Factor in Success.
The largest factor contributing to a
man's success is undoubtedly health.
It has been observed that a man is
seldom sick when his bowles are re
gularhe is never well when they are
constipated. For constipation you
will find nothing quite so good as
Chamberlain's Tablets. Teey not
only move the bowles but ipmrove
the appetite and strengthen the diges
tion. They are sold by all dealers.
A girl isn't anjr more afraid of a
mouse than a man. But she knows
that if she dosen't act as thought she
was scared a man wouldn't think
much of her.

Luke McLuke Says
It takes a man's presents to make a
girl forget his past.
Nevrr count your chickens when
your wife can hear you.
Every women likes to have a man
coax her to do something she wants
to do.
Why is it that the man with the
biggest heart usually has the smallest
bank roll?
A girl can marry a one-legged man
and people admire her good heart.
But if a man marries a one-legged
girl everybody wants to indignate.
Good Material, You Bet!
Editor Jim Allen, of the Cynthiana
Democrat says : "Paris knows where
to come when she needs croon men. ;
I Cynthiana has lots ot good material
yet on hand, and some that is slightly j
damaged, but good enough for Paris.1'
Editor Allen is about right. Al-'
though Paris has acquired a numberof
the best citizens of Harrison's capita,
they continue to come with and with
out solicitation. Our population has
been increased considerably at Cynthi
ana's expense, and her former citizens
readily sa the advantages offered bv
this good old town.

Georgetown May Gt Natural'Gas.
Georgetown will have natural gas
provided the city council of that city
grants a franchise. Mr. Victor Brad

Natural Gas Co., presented to the
couinnf of that city at its lastjmeeting a
franchise drafted from the one recent

The ordinance fixes the minimum rate
for gas at 50 cents. It looks us if the
natural gas company is planning to
connect all Central Kentucky towns
with gas and will extend the line to
Frankfort. Other neighboring towns
wll benefit by the pipe line.

Facts Worth Knowing.
There are three entirely different
kinds of ingredients used in making
the three different varieties of bak
ing powders on the market, viz : 1.
Mineral-Acid or Alum ; 2 Bone-Acid,
or Phosphate, and 3 Cream of Tartar,
derived from granes. It is imDortant!
from the standpoint of health., to know
something about these ingredients,
and which kind is used in your baking
powder.
1 Mineral-Acid, or Alum, is made
from a kind of clay. This clay is
mixed with diluted oil of vitriol and
from this solution a product is ob
tained which is alum. Alum is cheap,
costs about two cents a pound, and
baking nowder made with this Mineral
acid sells from 10 to 25 cents a pound.
2 Bone-Acid, or Phosphate, is the
basis of nhospbate baking powders
and the process is fully described in
the patents issued to a large manu
facturer of phosDhate nowder. The
U. S. Patent Office Report give a full
and exact description but the follow
ing extract is enough :
"Burned bones after being ground,
are put into fresh diluded oil of vitriol
and with continual stirring and in the
following proportion," etc.
From the Bone-Acid Phosphate bak
ing powaers are made; such powders
sell from 20 to 30 cents a pound.
3 Cream of Tartar exists in all ripe
grapes, and flows with the juice when
the grapes are pressed. The tartar is
.subsequently gathered from the cask,
boiled with water, and refined, when
crystals ofCream of Tarter, white and
very pure, separate and are produced.
It differs in no respect from the form
in which it orginally existed in the
grape. Cream of Tartar, wthen, whjle
the moat expensive, "is the'onlv ingre
dient that shduld be used in a bakine
nowder to act upon ;the soda, as its
wholesomenesa is bevond question.
Cream of larter baking powders
at about 40 to 50 cents a pound.
sell
Such are the facts and everv one,
careful of the health ot the tamily,
should remembre this rule: Baking
powders selling from 10 to 25 cents a
pound are made of Mineral Acid;
and those from 40 to 50 cents of
Cream of Tartar derived from grapes.
Machine Company Sued.
The commonwealth of Kentucky,
