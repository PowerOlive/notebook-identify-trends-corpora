was an easy matter for a manproficient with a pen to add a cipherand change a five to fifty and it wasdone Then seeing that the provisionsof the will required no bond what easierthan to insert the name HerbertLa thro pand the handling of John Loyds fortune was in his handsThe fortune may have suffered muchbut I trust not He was so anxious tocall your sister wife that he has hardljdissipated much of it and then doubtless he was held in check by a knowledge that vour father and Clarencewould have an eye on himI congratulate you most ferventlyyoung man on the escape of your sisterIt has

thatwhile we live this human life and develop this natural body it is net alone thenatural body we are creating but theseed of the spiritual body which is tocome afterThis is not a mystical doctrine Allthose who in this life have attainedsome knowledge of their spiritual natures will testify to its truth Thechange from a natural to a spiritual living is like the growing of a plant whoseseed we have sown The right plantsurely grows in a man who has sown theright seedAs the spiritual nature of a man begins to develop the purer higher elements in him grow stronger and oneby one the baser sort die Hate diesand revenge and anger Cruelty diesand all unkindness Narrowness ofmind dies and contempt for the frailties of othersThe part that lives and grows stronger is love Purity and truth and courage are but parts of love and as Itgrows greater by and by comes thesureness of knowledge and faith itself is swallowed up in fruitionThis is the dailv burial of the oldman who was earthy and the

often continued roaring noisemade from steam entering the waterinsideSome objections have been raised tousing live steam in milk for heating itpreparatory for the separator espe2ially in extreme cold weather claiming that the excessive expansion causesthe butter globules to become so suddenly heated as to produce a foreigntaste in the churned butterSometimes the water used in boilermay not be good and harm may comefrom that source but the same steam1 f01nr bJ Tl ftJFINE SULK HEATERS Separator P Pump O Overflow S PSteam Pipe F Faucets H Heater MPMilk Pipeused about the creamery for cleansingpurposes wouJd do harm also hence itis important that nothing but pure water be used about either boiler or thebuilding In case the weather is coldand to avoid putting too much steamdirect into the milk it is importantthen to heat the water under the receiver vats to at least half the necessarytemxerature for separatingI know quite a number of creameriesthat have put this simple device in during the past summer and iind that itnot only lessens labor but that by itsuse a better and more even temperaturecan be obtained than by the use of thetempering vat and the cleaning of itdoes not require one fifth of the timethat the usual vats require The cleansing is done by pumping- warm waterthrough the pipes and then steaming them thoroughly for about threeminutesThe illustration is simple and almostexplains itself M P represents themilk pipe or hose extending from themilk vat to P pump whieh raises themilk into the pipe joined onto thepump The milk naturally flows downto -the point 31 where a half inch pipeS P is inserted into a T large enough totake an inch galvanized -iron pipe theend being plugged up tight and a number of small holes drilled in on side forthe escape of steam in small jets Thehalf inch pipe joins on the three-quarter-inchby a reducer just below a globevalve which regulates the volume ofsteamThe pipes O 0 are to allow overflowwhen the stopcock at IT is partialiyclosed up with the point O over milkvat The valve at base of pump also regulates the flow of milk into separatorS In case the flow vat is at an elevation above sepaiator it is only necessary to extend the pipe from lioint Hdirectly into vat and the only thingnecessary would be a globe valve nexttc vat with the steam jet and FfaucetNot long since while at Sanduskyinstitute and discussing the creamerysubject I mentioned this labor savingdevice and a young man from Huron0 made special inquiry about it Inless than a week he had one in theircreamery and writes that it is simplyout of sight in every respect andwishes to thank me for putting himonto the idea I know of five creameriesthat are usinc the device and thev aremaking butter that grades first classeverywhere

PaperA writer in the Prohibitionist has anew highway scheme namely to nationalize all the public roads of the UnitedStates Let the people initiate theproject by requesting the United Statescongress to enact a law authorizing the interior department to cooperate with the respective statesin establishing and constructing aboundary line road or boulevard of liberal width limited grade in straightcourses and as may be possible following the existing boundary line ofthe respective states These roadswhen completed to form the exactboundary lines of the states theUnited States authorities to have theright of way in locating and constructing paying a fair price for labor andland all expenses to be jjaid withlaborexchange money issued by the UnitedStates which is to be exchangeable forall other rioney issued by the government and receivable for all debtsEach state is to bear a proportionateshare of the expense for the maintenance of these roads The same systemto be followed

itbuilds up the farm There is manurefor building up the poor spots and thelartd can be improved every yearTHE BOURBON NEWS FMD AY APRIL 16 I89TTHE FARM GARDENJHow to Keep the Grouaid Occupiedfrom Spring to FrillThe garden is the most productiveacre of the farm If it is not it shouldbe made so It is the most indispensable part of farm life Half of our living-should come from our garden insummer Not one half the country people make an effort to have a gardenThere are some that start out well inthe spring sow an abundance of seedand never look at the garden again until they think it is time they shouldhave results They take a look and cannot find any for the weeds have coveredthe little plants Then they come to tneconclusion that the seed did not growThey say all sorts of things about theseedsmen and mow off the weeds andwait until another spring when they gothrough the same process Now thisis all wrong To keep the garden cleanavi1 should begin earlv and continue thecultivation until fall It is impossibleto destroy all the weeds while we arecultivating the earljT vegetables Little patches of weeds around the gardenwill produce seed- enough 10 seed thewhole garden next year We should tryto plan so as to keep all the ground occupied in the garden It will requirebut little more labor to cultivate a cabbage or turnip in a vacant place thansimply to cultivate to keep down theweeds You can sow lettuce in Juiyand ifwillbe nice in the fall Cabbageaud turnip can be transplanted into theground where the early peas and potatoes have grown or you can set celeryand beets for winter use Keep all theground occupied If clean cultivation isgiven as should be done the weeds willbe killed out aud at the same time agood crop secured Thinning out plantsis an important matter in gardeningbeets and carrots will not grow to anysize if left too thick No vegetable butthe onion will stand crowding If thesoil is rich enough onions will grow toa good size when five or six stand together they will crowd each other outof the ground all but the roots and willbottom nicely The onion maggot destroys onions badly a good remedy isto take the soil away from the bulbs nomatter if the little onions tip over solong as the roots are in the ground theyare all right By doing this the fly hasno chance to put its eggs on the stalksand then there are no raagg ots in thebulbs Mrs J W Ferres in Farm andHomeCULTURE OF MELONSTlieir Successful Growtls RequiresLots of Plant PoodWatermelons are excessive feedersand many fail in attempting to growthem because they do not furnish sufficient plant food to supply the necessary strength for vigorous vine and finefruit Not infrequently watermelonvines turn yellow and die when theyshould be just in their prime simplyfrom plant starvationI prepare the ground as for corn Layoff in rows 12 feet apart each way I diga hole about iys feet deep and perhapsthree feet in diameter In the bottomof this I put a peck or more of goodstable manure tramping it lightlyNext put in a layer of soil and followwith a layer made up of equal parts ofsoil and fine rich manure thoroughlymixed and lastly- where the seeds areto be placed another layer of pure soilSow seeds thickly and cover about oneinch When the second or third leafshows thin out two or three plants inthe hill If exceptionally large melonsregular prize takers are desiredthin to but one plant in the hill I cultivate about as 1 do corn hoeing eachhill after an entire patch is plowed Ifvery dry cultivate often particularlyabout the hills It is some trouble 10thus
