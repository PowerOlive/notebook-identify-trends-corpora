That the Armistice MightEnd in Renewed HostilitiesWashington Aug 15 With peaceproclaimed all the energies of the military and naval establishments Saturday were directed into peaceful channels The sudden change from war topeace was manifest at the war andnavy departments There was no further expectancy of dramatic developments of battles or of new camxaignsThe orders given Friday night forimmediate cessation of hostilitiesbrought all military and naval movements to a halt and it now remainsto bring affairs back to a peace basisIn this however the authoritieswere acting on the theory that theprotocol of Friday was but the firststep towards peace and that not until a final and lasting peace was secured could there be an entire returnto a peace basisThis was particularly true as to themavy deparcment In that branch itwas accepted that permanent peaceundoubtedly would be made but yetinstead of stripping our war ships redistributing them into squadrons on apeace basis and returning them totheir old channels the naval authorities acted on the principle that thepresent armistice might end in a resumption of hostilities For that reason the four battle ships and two armored cruisers ordered north fromWest Indian waters are to undergo acomplete overhauling with a view toputting them in the pink of conditionFor many months they have been intropical waters their bottoms are fouland their engines and machinery needcareful overhauling As soon as theyreach New York all work at the navyyard will be subordinated to pushingthe complete overhauling of the battleships and cruisers Meanwhile thesmaller warships in West Indian watershave been ordered to safe harbors asthe West Indian hurricane season isnear at hand while sufficient ships forpolice patrol are left along the Cubanand Porto Rico coasts The bigmonitors will remain in Portollico and most of the blockading fleetwill center at Key West under Commodore Watson The peace protocol willgive a breathing spell and time forbringing every ship back to the highest state of perfection The completereturn to a peace basis the establishment of peace squadrons etc is amatter for the futureItJs expected that the American occupation of Manila will occurmmediately after the receipt by Adm Deweyand Gen Merritt of the orders sentthem Friday night This may not bedeferred by the lack of cable facilitiesas the American occupation of Manilaprobably will result in the openingof direct cable communicationbetween that city and the outside world The only difficulty thusfar has been that the cable companywould not recognize American controlof the cable so long as our forces werenot in possession of the city The orders sent Adm Dewey are much morespecific than those sent other navalcommanders as the occupation ofManila and the holding of the bay andharbor involved more important con-sideration than the mere cessation ofhostilities During the early hours ofSaturdaj the war and navy departments received no acknowledgmentsfrom the various naval and militaxycommanders but it was presumedthat the orders suspending hostilitieswere being carried out in all directionsItaly

situation for the bestmeans of allaying the excitement andpropagating the idea that Spains surrender is not so complete as indicatedby the bold terms of the protocol Asthe first step in this direction a semiofficial note has been issuedIt is as followsThe government is of opinion thatthe most critical period of the peacenegotiations has now arrived as it depends upon the arrangement of details as to whether the peace will bemore or less advantageous Spainwishes to preserve her sovereignty overthe whole of the Philippines to whichshe proposes to accord all political andadministrative reforms consistentwith the maintenance of her sovereign tlIn regard to the evacuation ofCuba and Porto Rico it will be asked-is be i-Theved here that SiiL owill be military governor of Cuba rthat the army be

will lead to considerable discussion and the matter will be submittedto a commission of diplomatists underthe presidency of Senor CastilloThe Liberal thinks the only brightfeature of the peace is the

clerksabout the departments but scarcely aSunday passes in peace times that thisdoes not happen The busy war likeattitude has entirely disappeared andWashington has settled down to apeace basisThe president believes that the mostserious problem which the peace commission will be called upon to dealwith is the Philippines Before thecommission assembles it is hoDed theaffairs of Cuba and Porto Rico will befound in such process of adjustmentas to leave little for the commission toconsider under that head THe absolute relinquiskment by Spainof all sovereignty over the islandsIn the West Indies will allow onlythe property questions to be settledbetween the governments that is whatSpain shall take away and what shallremain as captures of war and theprotection of Spanish subjects andtheir property in the islands Thegreater questions growing out of thewar as relating to Cuba and Porto Rico will have to be dealt with by theUnited States alone The fact that thePhilinnines will present thedifficult problem in the peacenegotiations has caused theadministration to give it a great dealof careful attention Several suggestions have been made as to what shallbe done one being the retention of theBay City and harbor of Manila justwhat the protocol gives temporarilyAnother is that Subig bay and a sufficient amount of territory for a navaland coaling station be secured and thebuilding up of an American cityat that place begun Still anotheridea which is being consideredis the retention of the Island of Luzonthe advocates of that plan believingthat there would be trouble betweenthe governments which occupied a portion of the island with a line of- demareation sucxl as would exist incase Manila and the bay only wasretained The Island of Luzon isthe largest of the group andcontains about 3000000 people whichare said to be the better class in thePhilippines It is believed howeverthat the administration and the commission will be greatly influenced bythe reports which Adm Dewey andGen Merritt will make on the subjectTheir reports are expected before thecommission meetsThe final determination as to thegovernment of Porto Rico and the settlement of the government of Cuba areproblems for settlement but the impression prevails that these islands willbecome quite rapidly Americanizedand everv encouragement for themto do so will be given Porto Rico willbe under military control for the present Cuba also will be sirniliarly governed but it is probable that American reforms in the matter of government will be such that the peopleof Cuba will see the advantage ofbecoming annexed to the UnitedStates It is thought the sanitary improvement of Havana and other citiesthe management of the municipalitiesand offered the country people will be of such a character as soonto convince the people that the changedconditions are fof their goodThere has been little doubt aboutsoon settling the transfer of PortoRico and the reception which theAmerican troops have received in thatisland is a justification for the beliefPorto Rico will be treated at oneeas an American possession Thefirst movement in this direction willbe the sending of a delegation ofofficials from the post office department to investigate and report uponthe mail facilities there now and tomake such recommendations as theydetermine upon Mail routes methodsof transportation and the conditions of post offices generallyin the island will be examined Military post offices will beestablished at once wherever troopsare stationed and at such other pointsas may be demanded by the

when hecomes home and prepared for his comfort he too often accepts it as his iue as a matter ofcourse and never thinks of the worrying detail which has occupied so muchtime in it about He neverthinks how inexpressibly tired hiswife is of it all though she may be toomuch of a woman to shirk it or whatdespair seizes her soul when after having eaten and drank all he is capableof satisfied snores from the cornerof the sofa announce the usual programme until bedtime or lackingthis a total silence and absence ofmind which is just as discouraging asto results Sunday too then at leastwhen there is or

the world that it had failed in theperson of its eldest son Therefore hisbrothers sagacious responsible menand conscientious for the most part inthe use of their name had never questioned but it was their right to use itfor Fred to repair his mistakes andcover up his failures and procure himanother chance and for years withconstant devotion to the private beforethe public obligation to sentiment before principle they had saddled thefamily problem in the person of theirunremunerative brother upon onehopeful young enterprise after anotherof the broad and charitable westHis little daughters letters followedhim from this remote mining camp orcattle station to the next one inclosedin long fluent circumstantial epistlesfrom her aunts explaining and apologizing concerning matters relating tothe child to which he had never ivena thought or had forgotten all aboutThese he glanced over and smiled atand often did not trouble himself toread After a time his brothers wereinformed in dignified phrases that hehad resigned from the disappointingaffairs of the new scheme which hehad last had in charge and he presentI3 returned and was on their handsonce more a little older and fattera little harder in the expression andlooser in the structure of the face anda trifle less sure of himself in the company to which he was bred and hissisters winced and blushed at his freecomments upon themselves the life ofthe home and of the east as it appearedto him after an interval of absenceand his mother wistfully took note ofher boys gray hairs and his old tiredunspiritual appearance but would notdiscuss him or hear him criticised andhis brothers pointedly requested himto pay a visit to their tailor and theysometimes forgot to mention to mutualdinner giving friends that Fred was intown Yet they thought he might bepresentable enough according to western standards He had at his best agood manner a trifle out of date to besure he had the indurate remains ofan expensive education he drank toomuch undoubtedly though that wasnot an exceptional failing with the menof their set They did not conceive themanner ot his dnruking when he wasat his lonelv nosts of nrtwntnhprllias never married acainl and thpvjthem that they must dofor that pretty creaturehis daughter and perhaps were a triflerelieved on casting up her 3 ears toremember that she could not be morethan a schoolgirl and there was plentyof time And her aunts were such verysensible women no doubt they werebringing her up to a fit sense of whather fathers daughter might have tolook forward to which they were notdoing at all but were petting her andmaking as much ado over the child as ifall thegoodfairieshad met at her christening Thc3 were not even attemptingto revise her innocent impressions of aparent known to her chiefly throughhis munificence in gifts and pocketmoney Her aunts never told her of thecarelessness that went with the munificence of the lapses when there wereno remittances even for shoes andschool bills nor how often their ownprivate means had bee n drawn upon tospare the little inheritance that theyheKl in trust from their sister to herchild This money they were resolvedshould not be touched neither principal nor interest while the3 were itscustodians and in this way alone theyshowed their prudence For why shouldshe need to know poor rhild what theworld said of her father They themselves did not pretend to know or tojudge him but always for the sake oftheir sistcrwho hadknown him and hadbeen silent to the last they too weresilent What the childs own motherwould never have told herlieved that they who stoodmothers place had nohering unpleasant I hoperightthey bein theto tellWhen at last they were startled bytheir brother-in-laws unexpected demand that his daughter should followhim into the far west they knew notwhat to say They had no objectionsthat they could dare to offer now tfthey had no rights in the child herselfthat they could set against the right ofa father and Faith as any girl wouldbe was wild to go They watched andprayed feeling as if some unhallowedbargain transacted long ago in whichan unconscious life was the innocentforfeit had been fatally foreclosed Andthey had made no effort to prepare thegirl for whatever surprises or shocksor ordeals this foreclosure involved-They could not have said just what itwas that they feared simply they didnot trust the man her father and theygreatly feared the life to which he wastaking her But they never questionedthat she must goThose gentle unassertive maidenmothers who with more than maternalunselfishness had fulfilled every dutyand made every sacrifice for their sisters child yielded her up to the naturaltie and every one said that it was welldone A few outspoken old gentlemenwho had no daughters of their ownand one or two defrauded young onesdeclared it was a shame but the wivesand mothers generally said that it wasthe right place for Faith all the more ifas was hinted her father was not in allrespects just what he should be Sowith no more preparation for the experience before her than girls have whogo to the altar with men they are expected to reform Faith had journeyedblithely westward to cast in her lifein the somber solitude of the BigIIornwith that of the dull hard carelesscoarse old man on whom her instincthad conferred every grace and

inferiors lest the3 should think himproud and with his subordinates ofcourse because at an isolated mine themanagers boys arc his sole companions and sometimes better bred menthan himself nor the

importance of heirthought that a second rate man mightdo well enough for such places as theysought for Fred It could not be expected that first class men would be1willing to exile themselves to holes

such a demand for stockers as during the lastyear While American buyers haveTaken large numbers to consume theirenormous corn crops Canadian farmers as they are learning the art ofproducing cheap feed in the form ofensilage and the like are more thanformerly anxious to secure thriftyconsumers of the same In the lastyear or two many have bought stockers for the first time and some at7east have learned lessons upon selection of feeders that while expensiveat first may prove profitable in theend The great increase in dairyinghas led to the more general use ofdairy bred bulls and from theseA GOOD HEAD AND FRONTPrecis of steers have been raised andpoorly raised at that These in theirsecond third or fourth year when allowed a good grass run may be easilytaken by the novice as fairly good andprofitable animals to buy especiallyif secured at from 2 to 3 cents perpound Now if such cattle are frombeefy darns says Farmers Advocateand have been well reared they mightreturn a profit for labor and cheapfood consumed but in most cases the-dairy cows that are bred are not ofthat sort and Ihe result is to disgustthe inexperienced steer feeder withtrying to make money out of beef orelse to show him the more glaring lesfcon that to try to do it with the wrongtype of animal was the mistake Practical and experienced feeders whobreed or purchase steers for fatteningobserve striking differences in theaptittide of animals of varying typesand make up to lay on flesh readilyand in such form and quality as tocommand the highest price on themarketProf Curtiss says in a recently issued bulletin on Essentials in BeefProduction It requires a welltrained eye to detect in all cases thepossible variation of results in thestore or stock steer but there aresome distinctions that are easily detected There are certain types ofcuttle for instance that never feedpiofitably under any conditions andit is quite as important to discrimina teagainst these in the feed lot as to beable to recognize the excellence inother types The accompanying illustration Fig 1 represents a yearlingsteer that combines practically all thequalities that go to make up a goodfeeding steer While the actual feeding qualities of a steer in thin condition are more difficult to detect thanojie in a better condition still the better sort to quote Prof Curtiss presents a blocky frame and stoutness ofbuild accompanied by short straightUgs wide back and loin well sprungribs fullness back of shoulders and inBank prominent brisket wide chestand well rounded barrel togetherwith a good soft mellow handlingskin and tine silky hair giving what istermed the thick mos3r coat withoutcoarseness and withal a good strongvigorous head clear full eye andijuiet temperament Soft mellowwill the thrifty steer of beef formcoarseness in head horn or any otherpart are desirable characteristicsCheap meat a greater percentage ofoffal as well as a tendency to unthriftIness usually accompany coarsenessand a hard handling skin Xot onlywill the thrifty steer of beet formmake greater gains for the food consumed but he will sell for a much better price per hundredweight when fatThis is readily understood when it isremembered that loin and rib roasts ofprime quality retail for from 1Gto 18 cents per pound while flank andplate cuts sell for from two to fouruents and internal tallow for fourcents per pound It is not a matterof prejudice against this or that breedor type when an expert buyer offers314 cents per pound for one mans cattle and 4 cents for another lot ofno greater weight as he values themstrictly on their merits The controlling factor is the utility and inherentvalue of the animal for the practicaltest of the butcher So that if someof us have perchance remodeled ourstables with the idea of feeding steersand after a winters feeding are almostready to proclaim that there is nomoney in beef let us look into thecause an 3 see Avhether or not we havegiven the matter a fair trial in thecharacter of animals fed and beforeging up if it is necessary to purchase slockers may we select onlythose which have been well rearedfrom thrifty beef form parentageand in themselves possess

consists in operating particular needles of the machine at the right1 time and allowing others to remain idletor which purpose a set of chain bars isused so arranged as to render it possible to command the different needlesaccording to the needs of the processA chain is made Tip of bars links andballs like those used on the loom forweaving cloth and there is a lever attached to the shoulder of each needleand extending from the part where thegoods circle the needles down to thefirst bar of the chain the latter restingin bearings On the turning of a crankconnecting beveled gears motion is imparted through the agency of an uprightshaft to the chain cylinder and everytime the yarn is delivered to the needlesa revolution is made the chain bar cylinder presenting a new bar to the leversof the needles and whenever a ball onthe bar contacts on the lever the needleto which it belongs is pushed forwardand a mechanical device causes theneedle to operate and form loops thusknitting There are however blankson some of the bars and when theseblanks connect with the levers of theneedles no movement is made UpholstererPlant PropagationSome very curious processes for propagation are practiced at the public gardens One consists in cutting with aknife a ring around a branch of a plantOne might imagine that the intentionwas to kill the branch but such is byno means the object in view The cuthaving been made a piece of wet mossis wrapped and tied around the branch atthat point Beneath this protection thesap exudes from the wound and littlerootlets are developed After a few daysthe branch is cut away from the parentstem being then itself a complete plantwith roots all ready to put in a potThis plan is adopted with plants of slowgrowth because one plant may thus besplit up into half a dozen or more ofgood size instead of waiting for aseedling or little slip to develop Washington StarInsultedAn American traveler relates thatalighting at a hotel in Granada a manat the door put
