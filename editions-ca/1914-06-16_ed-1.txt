Yes,everybody is getting in the Thomasband wagon and the same sort of political conditions obtained just overthe line in Scott County, the homeof Congressman Cantrill."I would not be surprised if thedoughty Congressman loses his owncounty, so strongly has1 sentimentcrystalized in favor of Thomas as aresult of Cantrill's well known political tactics and the overwhelmingsentiment that prevails in favor ofNational legislation to control theshipment of liquor into dry territory."If other counties in the districtawaken to the real issue of the campaign as my section of Fayette County and Scott County have done Mr.Thomas will carry practically everycounty but two in the district andwill win by a good majority."I never thought before that Cantrill could be beaten, but they havecertainly 'got his goat' this time,mark it as coming from me."That the friends of Mr. Cantrillrealize the situation has become serious is shown by the fact that theyar prganizing-in eyerycounty to givetheir man as much support as" theycan rally to the primary August 1.NOT THAT KIND."The Danville Messenger is unqualifiedly for Mr. Camden for Governor,but should he allow himself to bepushed into Beckham's way, such another howl as will go up was neverheard in Kentucky.

Its estimated value in 1913was $56,867,000, more than twice thatof the State's tobacco crop.The vear 1913 was not a good corn(year and the average yield for thisState was only 20 bushels an acre.Some of the best of the corn growingStates did not do so well, but the average yield for the country at largewas 24 bushels. In acreage Kentuckyranks 11th among the States, but in1913 thirty-four States, reported ahigher yield. 'In 1910 and 1912, better crop years, the State's averagewas approximately 30 bushels, but theaverage in more than half the Statesof the Union was higher.The figures show conclusively thatthe corn growers of the State are notgetting the results they ought to getfrom' their efforts. Kentucky had 3,650,000 acres in corn in 1913. Siloimprovement, more care in seedcorn selected and better methods ofcultivation would double the production of the more than tree millionacres of land that Kentucky is planting every year in corn. Indeed, it issafe to say that with only moderateimprovement in these particulars onthe nart of the rank and file of thefarmers, there would be a material increase of production and that without any increase in acreage.The averaee yield of corn in someof our counties is as low as 15 bushels. That this is due solely to poormethods has been demonstrated bythe boys' corn clubs which, in everysection of the State, from the mountains to the Mississippi River, havemade records of 100 bushels and moreto the acre.CULTIVATION AND YIELD.In some sections it is a commonpractice to plant the corn a littlethicker when raised for silage thanfor grain. Weeds should be kept out,or they will be cut-with the corn andmay impair the quality of the silage.The amount of silage that can be obtained from an acre of corn Avill varyfrom 4 to 20 tons or more. A 50bushel per acre of corn will yieldabout 8 to 12 tons of silage per acre,depending upon the amount of foliageand stalk that accompanies the ear.Southern varieties of cprn as a rulecarry a larger proportion of the plantin the form of stalk and leaves thando the northern-grown variesties.Corn should be harvested for the siloat about the same time it is harvestedfor fodder.Sorghums.Sorghums, both saccharine and nonsacharine, are readily made into silage. On account of their superiorityto corn as drought resisting cropsthey are nore commonly grown inthose regions of the West where thearinfall is too light or irregular for agood growth of corn. It is importantthat the soghums be harvested at theproper stage of maturity if the bestresults are to be secured. A mixtureof corn and sorghum has proved satisfactory in some localities where therainfall was so variable as to makethe corn crop uncertain.Clover.Clover can be used successfully asa silage crop yielding a palatable product high in protein, but preferableto make it into hay, or the silagemade from clover, as from other1 legumes, has an objectionable odor,i necessitating particular care in feeding to avoid tainting the milk. It doesnot pack so well as corn.GET RID OF YOUR RHEUMATISM.Now is the time to get rid of yourrheumatism. You can do it if youapply Chamberlain's Liniment. W.A. Lockhard, Homer City, N.

Thomas, candidatefor Congress from tne Seventh Congressional District, on his attitude insupport of the amendment for National Prohibition now pending in theUnited States Congress, and we dohereby pledge to him our most heartysupport.We believe, with him, that "the people are ,and of right should be, thefinal tribunal by which all matters ofgovernment policy are determined,"and that such an amendment as theHobson-Sheppard bill, which submitsthis important question to the peopleof the United States, is a most democratic measure.It is widely known that Mr. Hobsonin the House and Senator Sheppardin the Senate, are desirous of the billremaining on the calendar, and that itshall not be referred to the rules committee, represented by Hon. J. C. Cantrill, of Kentucky, in order that thebill, which empowers Congress withthe right to enforce the law, may beamended giving both the State andthe general Assembly this power.We believe that the bill would passby the necessary majority if left untilnext December, and we regret thatMr. Cantrill has allied himself withthe liquor interests of the country inthus hastening the vote on this question. We trust that all true temperancemen will cast their vote this fall onlyfor men who are committed to thisprohibition bill, regardless of partylines. Kentucky has shown in herlocal option elections that a large majority of her people are for the prohibition of the liquor traffic, and we believe that this question, in order to besettled, and to be settled right, shouldbe allowed to come up to the peoplefor a vote.(Signed)FRANCES E.

P. IlINK,(29may-tf) Chief of Police.One of the few child survivors ofthe t. Lawrence steamship disaster,a little girl, attributes her rescue toher ability to swim. "I learned howto swim at school," she said, "andwhen I found myself in the water 1just struck out for a board I sawfloating and pretty soon I was pickedup by a lifeboat." Several of thesurvivors who have told their storiesowe their lives to the fact that theywere able to swim at least a fewstrokes and keep their heads abovewater until help arrived, and doubtless there were others whose rescuemay be attributed to the same circumstance. There was never a time whensuch facilities for learning to swim,for both old and young, were offeredas at present. Pittsburg, in commonwith most cities, has provided manyplaces for acquiring the art that areavailable to children and adults, withcompetent instructors in charge.There is no better way to keep inhealth during the summer than to patronize these pools, but the recordsof attendance for previous seasons indicate a lack of appreciation on thepart of the public.It is difficult to find a good excusefor failure to le"arn to swim by thosewho are well and strong. Modern inventive genius has even provided anapparatus by which timid folk maybecome proficient without enduringthe ducking that used to be the invariable introduction to the countryboy's first lesson. The importance ofthe accomplishment should be urgedespecially upon the girls. It is safeto say that the parents of the littlesurvivor who has told the story of herrescue are giving thank that theschool which she attended madeswimming as important a part ot thecurriculum as French grammar orancient history.m.!.!,.!..!..! nit,!..

It considers the expressionvulear and productive jot an irresponsible spirit that unnts "many youngpeople for any dependable service."For the past decade many magazines and newspapers have insistedthat worry should be the chief occupation of the American- people. Thediagnosed our .case until we becameconvinced that we had all the diseasesin the calendar and a few that couldnot be classified. "We could not takeall the nostrum recommended, andthererfore we gave up hope of reliefat the hands of the innumerable volunteer doctors. The mind renouncedthe body and decided to let the imaginary ailments take their course. "Ishould worry" summed up the newfreedom from the gruesome symptomssuggested.The expression may be vulgar inthat it has a popular tang, but it is ahealthy reaction from the nationalneurasthenia which afflicted us. Letus have more of this"Don't Worry"spirit and we shall have morestrength for the real work to be done.There has been too much fightingof forms conjured up by hectic brains.A school of medicine, which wouldhave its patients ill for the fees involved, naturally objects to any expression that indicates an ability toget along without its services.CURES STUBBORN,ITCHY SKIN TROUBLES."I could scratch myself to pieces"is often heard from sufferers of Eczema, Tetter, Itch and similar SkinEruptions.
