Walter Payne,the following timely warning regarding the use of insecure envelopes, is given:"Postmasters should caution patrons as to the desirability .of avoiding the use of certain types of insecure commercial envelopes as covers for valuable first-class mail.The envelopes referred to are usually equipped with short side flapsand there is not sufficient adhesivematter at every necessary point onthe sealing flaps to permit of the se'cure sealing of the envelope. As aresult it is found that the envelopecan easily be opened by withdrawingthe ends of the flaps, or otherwiserifled with little difficulty. It istherefore to the interest of both thepublic and the department that substantial envelopes which can be securely sealed are used as covers forletter registered mail."The moral for local patrons of theoffice is: Talk with the BOURBONNEWS in regard to getting a supplyof "secure" envelopes for the purposes set forth in the above circular.

We saw theother day a pair of twin beds advertised for sale at half-price.The women of to-day do not fooltheir time away like a-Delilah, waiting for some man to go to sleep tocut his hair and cause his downfall. They just bob their own hairand 'all the men fall for it.A Paris man made the remark !that he would marry if he couldfind a woman in Paris below him inintellect. Knowing the man as wedOj we believe it would be an impossibility and that he will die abachelor.What do we care for your old irules of grammar when we hear apretty Paris girl with lips youwould walk through fire to kiss andwith a langorous drawl soundinglike liquid gold running over diamonds, say: "Why haven't you allbeen around to see us?"There is a pet idea of mine,And I'll desert it neverThe truth may comeAnd the truth may go,But .the "bull" goes on forever.v The Main street philosopher says:"One of these advertised opportunities in oil stocks remind me a goodbit of a honey-bee it takes considerable -experience to grasp itwithout being stung." Rememberthe days of wild excitement in Parisin "getting in on the ground floor"in "promising" oil companies?If "signs" are to be relied upon,this will be an open winter. Theold superstition holds that a scarcity of nuts denotes an open winter.The walnut and hickory nut crop issaid to be the shortest for manyyears. But who knows anythingabout it? It's the most uncertainthing in tlie world, predictingweather except trying to guesswhat a woman will do.The most popular of flowers, therose, is to be found in almost everycountry north of the equator.S HIGHEST PRICESr iiiiw l fh 1 I u I u 11 1 KMimtM.I.UJii i rJ LiIn Business In CincinnatiSince 1886FOR YOURPOULTRYOur 36 years in business has builta clientele of customers who depend onus for their daily supplies the year around.

These little olivecolored tablets are th result of Dr.Edwards' determination not to treatliver and bowel complaints with calomel.The pleasant little tablets do thegood that calomel does, but have nobad after effects. They don't injure theteeth like strong liquids or calomel.They take hold of the trouble andquickly correct it. Why cure the liverat the expense of the teeth? Calomelsometimes plays havoc with the gums.So do strong liquids. It is best not totake calomel.
