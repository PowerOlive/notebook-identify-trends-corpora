Danville, like Paris and other Cen
tral Kentucky towns, is waging a press
campaign for the suppression of un
necessary noises, especially the pesky
motorcycle, chief of all noise-makers.
The Danville Messenger in a recent
issue, says:
"The Bourbon News wants someone
to invent a Maud submarine' to torpe
do the pesky motorcycles that disturb
the slumber of Paris on Sunday morn
ings. The morning racket is bad, of
course, but what we want to see is
an invention that will send to the bot
tom (or in that direction) the machine
turned loose on a suffering public on
Sunday afternoon. Many men who
have to work all week get their only
extra rest on Sunday afternoon, and
to be disturbed by some gimlet-headed
rider of a motorcycle is enough to
put murder into the heart of any man.
The machines are not a necessity, but
are used for joy-riding and general
Sabbath-beaking. Any necessary noise
never disturbs a man who works, but
when some damphool begins useless
ndise it grinds upon "the nerves, inter
feres with his work and is a general
nuisance. A law has to some extent
stopped the automobile nuisance, but
the motorcycle idiot seems to have
come to stay."

TO OUR CONTRIBUTORS
THE NEWS would ask, as a special
favor that friends, who have contri
butions for its columns, please have
them in this office before the day of

the office, from the "devil" to the
editor-in-chief, becomes peeved, and
justly so, when as the forms are about
ready to go to press, some one comes
in with a long communication which

in earlier, in the day.
Not only contributors to our news
columns are offenders in this respect,
but even our advertisers are .guilty,
as s:(me of them will delay bringing
