Motor trips couldbe made to all the precincts in thecounty, where investigations couldbe conducted as to why the peopleof those particular precincts prefeito deal in Winchester, Lexington orCvnthiana. in preference to theirown home town. Of course it wouldbe out of the question to extend thitour to the mail order houses inChicago, which take thousands oi'dollars away from Paris and Bourbon county each year, but we mightpersuade our own people to dealwith us pei haps. Is it worthwhile to try? Many merchants inParis can tell of some of their cuftomers who have charge accountswith them, yet go to Lexington andmake purchases of goods for whichthey pay the spot cash. And themean part of it is that they get nobetter class of goods than theirhome merchant could furnish them.I SUMIOUSTAGED EDUCATOR REVISITS OLDHOME HERE.KEEP YOUR HOME SANITARY.

A. Vogle & Son, formany years."Why, I actually gained eightpounds in weight in two weeks timewhen I began taking it and the benefits I have received from it are little short of marvelous. For the pasttwo years I had suffered severelyfrom stomach trouble. After everymeal what I ate began to sour and Iwould taste it for hours, and therewas a heavy, indigestible feeling inmy stomach. I often had terriblodizzy spells, when I would becomevery weak, and at times I had tograb hold i something to keepfrom falling. Also about a year ago1 began to suffer with rheumatismin my arms and legs, which painedme all the time, and often my muscles seemed to just draw into knotsand it was an effort for me to getaround. Then,, too, I was bothereda great deal from constipation, forwhich I had to always be takingsome sort of laxative."1 tried many different treatments and medicines without getting any relief, and had becomevery much discouraged, but when Isaw where Tanlac had benefited somany others who described theircondition as being similar to mineI decided to give it a trial. Well,sir, it just seemed to fit my case exactly, and went right after mytroubles at once, and soon I wasfeeling a different man. I nowhaven't a trace of stomach trouble,can eat anything I want and everything agrees with me perfectly.My appetite is great and I enjoywhat I eat more than I haye in.years The rheumatism left me almost as soon as I began taking Tanlac, I never have a pain of anykind and can get about as good asI ever could. In fact, I feel betterin every respect than I have inyeais, and as I owe it all to TanlacI am only too glad to recommend itto everybody."Tanlac is sold in Paris at thePeople's Pharmacy.(adv)SWIFT & CO'S WEEKLY PRODUCE MARKET REVIEWThere is an active demand forfresh poultry and although the supply is larger, prices show littlechange.The supply of eggs during theweek has been sufficient for currentand storage requirements and pricesare ruling lower than a week ago.There has been a seasonable increase in the amount of cream delivered to our creameries this week,but a larger supply than necessaryfor current requirements and butter has not generally been of satisfactory quality for storage.

Cox, ofOhio, for the Presidency, the Utica,(N. Y.), Observer endorses Kentucky's endorsement of the popularOhio man, as follows:"The decision of Kentucky togive its delegates to the Democraticconvention to. Governor James M.Cox, of Ohio, and the certainty thatseveral othei States will soon follow a similar course brings thename of this possible candidateprominently before the country."He is a natural orator and debater. His eudiences soon comeintG pympathy with him, for hepossesses the boldness of and aggressiveness of Roosevelt, combined withthe adroitness and skill of Wilson.His speeches are marvels of terse,snappy, homely, straight-forwardtruths, and he has the facultv ofseeing a point and taking advantage of it on the instant."Should he be nominated by theDemocrats, James B. Cox will provea most aggressive candidate, and hewill be a hard man against whom tomake a canvass, as there is no blemish in his career."AN EXAMPLE OF REPUBLICANPARTISANSHIPIt is doubtful if the history ofour National Government gives aninstance of more shameless partisanship than that exhibited by themajority on the House Ways andMeans Committee, which recentlyexcluded the Democratic membeisfrom all part in its conferences.When the Soldier Bonus Bill wasdrafted, no Democrat on the Committee was permitted to know whatwas in the bill until after it was reported out, when, notwithstandingit ought to have been dealt with asa broad, patriotic measure, it wasordered puf through the House as astrictly Republicanenterprise. This,of course, is oligarchy of the worstsort. When the minority is not allowed to be present at the draftingof an appiopriation bill, to saynothing of having a voice in itspreparation, and the whole peoplemust contribute to the revenues, itis taxation without representation,which is the first rudiment of tyranny. Democratic and Republicansoldiers fought side by side in thewar and fell tide by side on thebattlefield, and their representatives should sit side by side andspeak jointly in providing the honoiarium for the men who bore theburden and heat of the day.oCUT THIS OUT AND TAKEWITH YOUITA man often forgets the exactname of the article he wishes topurchase, and as a last resort takessomething else instead.
