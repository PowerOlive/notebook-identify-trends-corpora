The matter will bebroached in the encampment thisweek but the outcome is uncertainThe question of discontinuing thereunions has come up more seriouslyperhaps among the western department which must travel so fur to theencampments and yet do not care tomiss one so long as they are heldThe argument advanced is that theorder was organized to teach loyaltyand devotion to the nation and thework has been done The SpanishAmerican war has wiped out all sectionalism from the county and thepatriotism and loyalty shown the pastfew months have illustrated to the oldsoldiers that the younger generationhas stepped into their shoes in a degree that makes it time for the GrandArmy to give up the work it has sonobly carried onIt is not the intention to give upthe order but to give up the

is locatedabout four miles from Hogansburgabove the St Regis Indian reservation The bridge that gave way wasbeing built across the St Lawrenceriver at the foot of Long Saulte rapidsnear Reinhardts island The water atthis point is known to be as swift asin any part of the river The immediate cause of the disaster and the giving way of the span of the bridgeseems to have been from the washing away of one of the largepiers The pier in question wasbegun last fall and work was continued all winter and finished this summer The contract work was in chargeof Messrs Sooy Smith Co who arewell known as extensive and carefulcontractors in their line and known tohave had instructions from the railroad company to build for permanency The pier had been acceptedas perfectly reliable and safeIt would seem from this that theswiftness of the current was underestimatedLate reports from Cornwall hospitalsays 88 men have been taken out ofthe river and transferred to the hospital Eighteen of them

were being crushed in the wreck weredrowned by the rushing watersThen he saw bodies coming tothe surface and the work of rescue began This was helplessly inadequatethere being only a few boats in

waters beforethe eyes of helpless onlookersMangled bodies came to the surfacefor a moment and then passed out ofsight It was a terrible and heartrending scene Even those who weregot to land alive were in such condition that many died on the way tothe hospital Some had their backsbroken others both iejrs while otherswere crushed by the heavy ironsAmong those who are missing areCyril Campbell William

disaster occurred in this cityShortly before 8 oclock a trolley carof the Troy City Bailroad Co wasstruck by the night boat special of theDelaware Hudson railroad at acrossing at the west end of the Hudsonriver bridge which connects this citywith Lansingburg and its load of human freight was hurled into the airEighteen of the 35 passengers are deadand at least ten of the remainder willdieThe cars entering the city fromLansingburg were crowded with passengers returning from a Labor daypicnic at ILensslaer park a pleasureresort near Trov Car No 192 of thethe Troy City railroad was the victimof the disaster It came over thebridge about 735 oclock laden with amerry party of people fresh from theenjoyment of the dayFour tracks of the Delaware andHudson road which runs north andsouth at this point cross the twotracks of the trolley roadThe tracks of the street line run ata grade from the bridge to the pointwhere the disaster took placeIn consequence of this fact and ofthe frequent passage of trains it hasbeen the rule for each motor car conductor to stop his car and go forwardto observe the railroad tracks and sigaal his car to proceed if no trainswere in sight It can not be ascertained whether that rule was compliedwith- on this occasion for all eventsprior to the crash are forgotten bythose who were involvedThe motor car was struck directly inthe center by the engine of the trainwhich was going at a high rate ofspeed The accident came withoutthe slightest warning The car wasupon the tracks before the trainloomed in sight aud no power onearth could have saved it The motorman evidently saw the train approaching as he reached thetrack and opened his controllerbut in vain With a crash thatwas heard for blocks the enginestruck into the lighter vehicle Theeffect was horrible The motor carparted in two both sections beinghurled into the air in splinters Themass of human for the car wascrowded to overflowing was torn andmangled Those in the front of thecar met with the worst fate Theforce of the collision was there experienced to the greatest degree and everyhuman being in that section of the carwas killedThe scene was horrible Bodies hadbeen hurled into the air and theirheadless and limbless trunks werefound in some cases 50 feet from thecrossing v vThe pilot of the engine was smashedand amid its wreckage were tho maimed corpses of two womenThe passengers of the train Sufferedno injury in addition to a violentshockThe majoritj of the passengexs otthe trolley car were young peopleThey included many womenWithin ten minutes after the collision fully one half of the populationof the city were surging about thevicinity in an endeavor to ascertain ifrelatives were among the unfortunatesThe injured weve taken to the cityhospital and to the Continental knitting oiill the former not having sufficient ambulance service to caft forthem allThe corpses were placed in boxesand taken to a neighboring mill shedMany of them were unrecognizableThe crash was

crushed and distorted features bodies crushed and flattenedthese sights constituted a spectaclemost horrible t beholdThe train of the Delaware and Hudson road after the accident proceeded to Troy The engineer stated that he did not see thecar until he was upon it He tried toprevent his train from striking thecar but his efforts were fruitless Histrain was going at a very high rate ofspeed at the timeHe was some minutes late and wastrying to make up lost time In consequence of the caution taken by thetrolley road to ascertain if the trackswere clear at this crossing the engineers of trains have always felt safein running by at a high rate of speedThe engineer says that the first heknew that the car was comingwas when it hove in sight atthe corner of the street at which thecrossing is situated He was but ashort distance from the car at thetime It was utterly impossible forhim to brine his train to a standstillNo Yellow Fever ac MobileMobile Ala Sept 0 There is noyellow fever in

special advantages beinggranted to military men -who marrythe daughters of the country Threecenturies of intermarriage betweenEuropean men and native women andalso between the latter and the numerous Chinese immigrants have consequently added to the original population a large proportion of halfbreeds representing every degree ofadmixtxire The Chinese Mestizosalone are said to constitute one sixthof the domesticated native populationand the Spanish Mestizos togetherwith the Creoles or Sons of theCountry Hijos del Pais as they termthemselves form an influential bodythe majority of whom are establishedas traders in Manila and the provinces Owing to their European descent more or less distant these Spanish half breeds are endowed withquicker perceptions greater businesscapacity and wider intellectual faculties than the pure Tagals Many ofthem are well educated but few display much natural talentA certain number of Mestizos bothSpanish and Chinese have amassedlarge fortunes as middlemen betweenthe native growers and the Europeanmerchants Although in the Philippines no distinct line of demarcationis drawn between races andclasses the social position of thesehalf breeds and Creoles is somewhatequivocal though vastly superior tothat of the Eurasians of British IndiaAs a class they are continually struggling to obtain the position and consideration accorded to the PeninsularSpaniards who refuse to give themtheir daughters in marriage whiletheir dusky hued connections form aperpetual reminder of their originVainly endeavoring to disown kinshipwith the latter and assert an equalitywith the Castilas they bear a grudgeagainst these for possessing so unmistakably European a birthright Themoral result of this is that they aregenerally speaking morose in

CenturyMOULTING OF A TARANTULAAn Interesting Siyrltt to NaturalistsHow the liarxre Spider Perforins the OperationAn event of mor than ordinary interest occurred1 in my office the otherday A large female tarantula shedits skin for the second time since it hasbeen in captivity hose familiar withinsects spiders and related creaturesive aware that they are encased by abard unyieldingintegument Increaseof size is permissible only when the oldikin is shed and one that has beennewly formed beneath expands to therequisite degree This is a processconstantly occurring in nature andever excites interest in the beholderWhen a large spider three inches longthrows off the old integument it is athrilling sightIn the present case the tarantulahad evidently been feeling ill for somedays a condition frequently precedingthis process among insects and theother day she was found lying on herback and apparently dead but moveda little upon being disturbed She lajthus until a quarter past twelve whenthe rustling her movements male excited attention The old skin had thenruptured around the thorax in such amanner that the top could be removedentire and through this opening thegiant spider wis literally working outof her old skin dm was accomplishedby the aid of eight legs and the twoleglike palpi At the end of an hourthe chauge had been effected Thespider lay upon her back beside theperfect skin resting from the severeexertionThis tarantula was unusually largeliefore she moulted and is now of stillgreater size She came north in a-bunch of bananas about two and ahalf years ago and until last Januarywas the pet of Dr T M Bigelow Whileunder his care cue skin was shed and isnow in my possession An idea of theincrease in size attendant upon moulting may be gained by comparing thedimensions of xhe dorsal piece of theskin shed about the latter part of 1806when under the eare of Dr Bigelowand the one just shed The first measures one inch and the second measuresone and one fourth inches Therefore-the present dorsal piece will probablybe proportionately larger when fullyexpanded E P Pelt in Country GentlemanHypnotised by the WnNliThe British steamer Ilowiclc Hall

twelfth day of -July there weregathered at the Mission some 60 or70 non union miners prisoners fromthe surrounding mines awaiting transportation across the lake and out ofthe Coeur dAlene The fast littlelike boat Georgia Oakes was unaccountably many hours behind herIsual time and there were no officialsat the landing in her service who couldbe interviewed on the subject of thisilolay Rumors passed from mouth tomouth and it was whispered She isheld back under military orders shewill bring the troops But so manycontradictory telegrams had been flying across the wires which were nowcontrolled by the union that the hopewas barety breathed so many werethe counter doubts and f carsThe old Mission is one of the mostdream like spots ever chosen by travelar ilis trysting place of a steamboat anda railroad The Northern Pacific lakesteamer and the narrow guage railroada noisy adventurer from the mountaincamps and roaring caious of theCoeur dAlene here transact their dailymeetings with the most publicity yetto land upon the wharf boat and toip aboard the train is to stroll byflisnsi up a steel pathway between thefields of sleep lxide the waters offorgetfulness The charming placein its deep sweet sunshiny seclusionseems to have been half reluctantlvyiclded by nature long ago to the temporary occupation of man and thenfondly reclaimed into her own wildtendance The Mission meadows are asrich as those upland pastures wherethe milk white hulder maidens of theilorthern legends fed their fairy herdsThe wild flowers in their beauty unitethe influence of the west and the northwith the breath of the soft chinook toatone for the neighborhood of snowelides The river slips in silence pastbowers of blossoming shrubs and leaning birches and somber pines lift theirdark spires out of the tender mass ofdeciduous greenIn it all there is an effect of abidingpeace strangely in contrast with someof the scenes which the historic Missionlias been called to witness Needlessto say it is the ideal resort of the summer excursionist whether he came forfishing or flirtation or to search thepoetic past or merely from the common gregarious instinct of a peoplethat loves to do everjthing in crowdsBut it was no holiday coinpanv gathered this day at the Mission The greater number were men who carried theirworldly goods in their hands theywore their best clothes and their latestearned wages were in their pocketsbut the thought was not wanting thatsafety and life itself had been riskedfor these few dollars which they weretaking with them and that they werepassing out of the country under ashameful ban There was no travelerfrom Altruria to ask Who are thesedecent poor men Why have theycome here and why do they go by acommon sad impulse as if throughfear and force And if so who compels them And what is their offensethat they should be looked at askanceand herded apart like tainted cattleA deeper question this would be thanmost of us are prepared to answerEven the facts can hardly be trusted toanswer for facts are cruel and theyfrequently lie in the larger sense oftruth nencc it is with extreme reluctance that one approaches the storyof what was done at the Mission onthe night of July 12 during the labortrouble of 1S02 The inferences mustspeak for themselves no one woulddare to be responsible for the logic ofthese cruel facts which seem to acase generally yet really accuse only afew the blind guides and faithlessshppherds who were condemned in thecommunities where I hey were bestlenowji and were brought to an inadequate punishment but were afterwardvet free through a technicality of theTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 9 1898law which in effect pronounced themguiltless These are not laboringmen but they are clothed and fed bylaboring men who in turn are betrayedby their injurious counselsThe rank and file of the non unionprisoners were of the ordinary class ofwestern miners who pack theirblankets from

underthe special protection and guaranteeof the union leaders but the signsof recent trouble in her tear flushedface aroused Mrs Cassons sympathies and that neighborly woman soon discovered that the managers daughter notwithstanding herfashionable dress prosperous connections and look of delicate pride wasvery much alone and very warmly disposed toward the ostracized portion ofthe laboring community to which MrsCasson and her man belonged Hencea sudden and on Faiths part ratherhysterical intimacy The voice of thekind woman speaking with the richsympathetic Irish intonation touchedthe chord that vibrates in sobs orSometimes Faiths eyes filledsometimes she laughed at Mrs Cassonsdelicious hearty talk The train rumbled on between the river and themountains thundering over its bridgesand the green fair vista of the Missionopened The outbound passengers disembarked and gathered in groups orscattered till the moment of departureAt the Mission Mrs Cassons childrenhad to be fed Faith was not enticedbj the sort of meal chat the Missionset forth that day to its seventy visitors anything at all at a good roundprice was right for the scabs the Mission did what it could to retain a littleof that apostate money in the land ofthe faithful But Nature offered themher own refreshment flowers anddeep soft grass to lie upon and shedthe light of her jocund sunshine upontheir recent troubles and tipon theanxious future before them and thehabit of making the best of a bad outlook was the habit of them allFaith had idly extended her acquaintance to a chatty little lad one of therising hopes of the Mission who having his time much at his own disposalwas pleased to bestow- it largely uponher He was a wise child in the happiest sort of knowledge that of thefootpath way He took her acrossthe meadows where the blue camassflower was just falling from overbloom They crept under the boughsalong the river and loaded themselveswith wild roses pale and red and everyshade of pink between He told her thenames of the new flowers as he knewthem and she likened them to otherflowers at home She noted the strangecharacter of v the river which here atthe Mission is not like a mountainstream but cuts into the rich bottomlaud deep and still like a southernbayou and has no beaches but onlybanks which drop off suddenly intothirty feet of water or put forth a toeof tree roots

in the days of intrepid zeal wherein the deep forest wilderness want ofskill or want of tools was no detriment and men wrought with faith andtheir bare hands in the sincerity ofwood and imperishable stone Thepriests house adjoining the churchand a shabby modern foil to its ancientdignity was closed and Faith wasforced to abandon her desire to enterthe church of the fathers but theysat upon the steps the oddyoungpairand talked 6f the past The little boywas not much of a historian Faithdid not put implicit confidence in histales of Father de Smet who was deadthat at least was true and of FatherJosette who was still of the livingShe knew perhaps quite as much aboutthe history of the old church as hedid born in its shadow But therewere other subjects of contemporaneous and imperative interest on whichhe could offer her a few surprises Hehad gathered that he was talking withno less a personage than the younglady of the Big Horn ami for reasons which we know- the name of herfathers mine inspired this wise childof the union with the fullest faith inher as a partisan notwithstanding thathe had seen her consorting with scabsSo he poured forth his tale withouthesitation to behold her stare at himin incredulous horrorWhat was this he was saying shedemanded but the child drew backunu wouiu not repeat hisworcls IJehad made a very great mistake henow became confused distrustful andunhappy they were no longer company for each otherFaith sought an opportunity laterwhen they were out of hearing of theother prisoners to repeat the childsastounding confidence to Mr Casson -Do you think such a thing -couldpossibly be true she cried excitedlyWhy you may say after what weveseen that anything is possible MrCasson began guardedly Theres badmen everywhere aria in a time ljke

other end of the ropewas not fastened to anything Atlength I grasped my man the rope became taut and I began to ascend Theships corporal helped us both outFifteen years afterwards Lord Charleswas speaking at a political meeting insupport of Lord Folkestones candidature The hall was packed andthere was a scuffle at the backChuck him out cried someone butLord Charles invited the ma a to comeup

PlowmanADVANTAGES OF CLOVEROne advantage with clover is that itfurnishes two crops in one season Thefirst crop is nearly always cut for haywhile the second growth can be usedfor pasturage plowed under as agreen manure cut for hay or allowedto mature seed The clover plantmakes a quick growth and if the firstcrop is cut in good season will startup and soon shade the ground and willfurnish considerable feed during thesummer when it is so -often the casethat the pastures failWhen cut for hay or plowed underit should be allowed to make a fullgrowth and be cut when in full bloomProperly cured it makes one of thevery best foods for the dairy cow during the winter as well as for growingstock of all kinds Even hogs will bebenefited if given a good feed ofclover hay two ov three times a weekWhen in full bloom it contains thelargest per cent not only of animalfood but ofplantfood also hence so faras other conditions will admit the bestresults are obtained by plowing under when a full growth has been madeUsually the growing of cloverseedproves profitable Occasionally whenthere is a full crop the price will fallbelow that of profitable productionA small yield running from three to-seven bushels per acre and costingfrom 70 cents to 1 a bushel to thrashis an expensive crop to grow and unless fair prices are realized will not beprofitableIn harvesting the heads should allbe left to turn brown before cuttingA self rake is rather the best machineto cut clover for seed as it leaves itin bunches that can be gathered upreadily with a fork It is quite an itemto handle the clover as little as possible as it shatters readilyIf the threshing can be done in goodseason the clover can be left as cut until dried out sufficiently to thresh Butunless you are certain that this canbe done it is best to gather up andstack the clover as soon as it is sufficiently cured The hulm or strawmakes good feed equal in value tovrheat or oat straw while it can hardly be excelled for beddingIn growing wheat the turning underfif a good growth of clover will bebeneficial as it supplies the elementsof plant food needed by this cropFor corn or potatoes it is usuallybest to allow the

the enemys ship orat any rate the class to which she belongs is kncivn Then if the captaincould turn to his notebook and find aprearranged plan of attack suited toher construction he could at once tellthe guns crews what their target wasto beIt may be that duels between shipswill be of rare occurrence and thatsuch actions as that of the Yalu will bethe most frequent where fleets willpass each other rapidly and wheresuch rules as I propose for discriminating attack could not be put In practice But is there not still the chancethat individual ships may be pittedagainst each other when it
