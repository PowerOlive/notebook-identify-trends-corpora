Pedestrians viedwith automobiles for right of way,and in spite of the drizzling rainand sleet, all afternoon there wasa noticeable lack of bad humor.The holiday business officially began on Saturday, the merchants say,and from now on walking space inthe stores and streets . will be at a'premium. The Christmas spirit isnoticeable in the decorations of thestores.Managers of the Paris stores,"battling with Paris a"nd Bourboncounty people for the past fourweeks to "Do Your Christmas Shopping Early." have prepared as usualfor the deluge. The stores thisyear, setting a record, put up theirChristmas decorations and placedall their Christmas stocks out practically two weeks before the accustomed time.The effect produced, according toone department store manager, wasthat the people just won't comedown town and do their shoppingearly. They hate to get out early inthe morning, and as 3 result thestores have done the larger part oftheir business in the afternoonrush. "But things will changefrom now on," he said. "Theywill have to buy this week,as it's too close to the actual date."Most of the stores will be openevery day until six o'clock from nowon, and many others will begin tokeep open until nine o'clock atnight, in order to give the workingpeople a chance to do their shopping. lGOOD THINGS TO EAT FORCHEISTMAS SHOPPEESWe will have everything goodto eat in the way of short orders,lunches, steaks, chops, etc., duringthe holidays for the busy merchant,country folks and Christmas shoppers.(1)DALE'S RESTAURANT.THE BOimDON N1WS,CHRISTMAS ATMOSPHERE INPARIS STORESParis stores have taken ona de-'cidedly Christmas air. and areoffering a varied line of the most,appealing things for Christmas, forthe young and old, for man, womenand children.
