The audience "at the evening service filledthe church to overflowing, using allthe balcony seats and about onehundred and fifty extra chairs. Rev.Kellums delivered two powerful sermons, his audiences following withthe closest interest.There were twenty-eight additionsat the two services, and, as has beenpredicted, this is evidence that thismeeting will be the greatest revivalsesn in Paris in years.

You will have to come earlyto get the best seats. The subjectfor to-night will be "The lonconv6rslon of Felix," Wednesday,"Hell' Thursday, "Is There LifeAfter Death?"Mr. Richards, the ong leader, isfine. So far, he has -not done muchsinging himself, but, as he says, heis not here- to do the singing, but tosee that the congregation does it, anahe certainly is seeing that all sing.Sunday morning he sang a solo, andit was very pleasing and sijmple. Itit hoped .he will do considerable solowork during the meeting. If you loveold-time congregational singing, comeall the time, and sing to your heart'scontent.The special Sunday evening was asong by the male quartet, .uastnight the Children's Sunbeam Chorussave the special, and this was doneafter only one rehearsal. It was remarkably good and speaks wonderfully well of Mr. Richard's ability asa director of such choruses. Youwill enjoy them immensely.

To he from the old Commonwealth is to he envied in all landsand in all ranks of society everywhere. But to "what extent are theex-patriates, there are no ex-patriotsfrom Kentucky, appreciative of thehoapr conferred upon thein by thaccident of birth?The test lies in the way in which'the appeal for funds to purchasefederal Hill ar& met by those whothrill when "My Old KentuckyHome," is played beyond the borderline and over the seas. The Governor of Kentucky said much when hesaid that the melody which hadtugged at th heart strings is nowtugging at the purse-strings. Ifemotions can be transmuted into goldthe $50,000 needed to complete thepurchase of the old Kentucky homewherein Stephen C. Foster composedthe, immortal song will be oversubscribed many times.So much for the ex-patriates.What of the Kentuckians who haveso loved their State that no pull hasBeen powerful enough to break theties which bound them to old Kentucky? If love and pride mean anything practical; Federal Hill is asgood as bought, unless professionsof fealty and' claims of superiorityhave been as sounding brass.'The appeal for subscriptions tomemorialize "My Old KentuckyHome" is really a call for a showdown, even at? a call to the colorsig the test of patriotism not to beevaded by those who can respond.The free ride is" ended. Deeds, notphrases, will be the measure of theKentuckians' right to call himself aKentuckian and expand his. chestin the calling.-OURRESPONSIBILITYCHILDRENTO THEA prophet of old sang about thecattle on a. thousand hills helongingto the Xord. The thousands of children thAt are the hope of the futurealso belong to the Lord. Sometimesin theireffort to express normal instincts we let them get into thehands of the devil and his angels.They are allowed to go out in the alleys and streets to become a targetfor automobiles and other vehicles.There is often nothing for them to dothat helps them to grow into the pnenand women that we want them to become. Their energies are either wasted or used ,in activities which sooneror later will become a menace tothem and the community.The children of Paris are entitledto the best that Paris can give them'in the way of opportunities to express themselve in wholesome ways.The prosperity and happiness of the-"-community depends more upon the'men and women of to-morrow than it' does upon any other, one thing. Herbert Hoover, in speaking of our responsibility to the childhood of theland, said: "The welfare of the children of the nation is our joint responsibility. I believe that the attitude of a notion toward child welfarewill soon become the test of civilization."

They are wrap-'ped jand tied up in the usual way,and offered at the postoffice window.They weigh fifty-two ounces, andUncle Sam requires twenty-six centsfor delivering them. But we are informed that! by using a piece of boardor tin, or some other kind of junk,as part of the package, so as tomake it weigh thirteen ounces more,it will be carried for seven cents.The same kind of figuring is applied to other printed matter, so thatin the course of a year, the printerpays a good many extra dollars, unless he does make .his package weighfour pounds.We have been instructed , by patrons to wrap an old brickbat or astone in the package. We have neverobeyed such, instructions, but weclaim it is worse than foolish it isalmost criminal to subject the poorprinter to such, a temptation.O ;Odd Japanese Custom.From time away back it was mecustom in Japan to remove one'sshoes before entering a building ofany sort, but the old-style, shoes ofJapan have been discarded for thoseof the occidental, and it is not so easyto remove them.
