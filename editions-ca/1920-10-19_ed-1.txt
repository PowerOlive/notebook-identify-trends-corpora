Wherever the Republicans criticize the operation ofone of the war agencies it is usuallyfound That a Republican was incharge of that agency. This has silenced the captiou cavilling at thewinning of the war which feature theRepublican campaign handbook.A few of the Republicans appointed to conspicuous war jobs areas follows:Gen. J. Pershing, commander-in-chiefof the A. E. F.; Gen. Peyton C.March, Chief of Staff of the Army;Gen. Geo. W.. Goethals, assistantchief of staff; Gen. Enoch H. Crowder, provost marshal general of thearmy; Benedict Crowell, Dr. E. F.Koppel and Emmett J. Scolt, assistant secretaries of war; Admiral William C.

Taft, formerRepublican President, chairman ofthe National War Labor Board;Henry P. Davidson, Red Cross Di-rectoi: Cornelius N. Bliss, forpierjTreasurer of Republican NationalCommittee, members of the RedCross War Council.Four of the members of the Advisory Commission, which preparedfor the war before it came, are Republicans. Grosvenor B. Clarkson,Director of the Council of NationalDefense was a Republican, and theCouncil was composed largely of Republicans. oG. 0. P. DESERT PARTY RANKS.Evidence of defection of "votersfrom Republ'can and Progressiveranks into the Democratic column,are being received daily at the Kentucky Democratic Headquarters. Thelatest of these was contained in aletter from Chas. W. Faber, of Dayton, Ohio.Mr. Faber calls himself a Cox Republican. He is so inteiested in theLeague of Nations that he hay offered to distribute one hundred thousand copies of Prof. Irvine Fisher'sarticle on "Reasons Why You ShouldVote For Cox and Roosevelt." Thesiarticles are to be distributed to thecampaign committees in Kentucky,Indiana and West Virginia. Theyare written by a Republican with aspecial appeal to Republicans, Independents and Progressive voters. Mr.Faber writes that though a Republican he is heart and soul for theLeague of Nations, and is going thelimit by giving away free of chargethis campaign literature.Another evidence of strayingaway from Republican ranks is thecase of Mrs. Evelyn Snead Barnett,wife of Ira S. Barnett, of Louisville,Ivy. Mr. Barnett' is a Republicanelection officer. His wife has declared for the League of Nations, and ismaking speeches in the interesr ofthe Democratic ticket. She assertsthat the Republicans stand on theLeague question proves it is morally bankrupt.QSAY "DIAMOND DYES"Don! streak or ruin your material ina poor dye.

The speaking had notbeen publicly advertised and therewere veiy few white persons in therorn. ,The speaker urged the negroes ofRichmond and Madison county tovote for the Republican ticket andagainst tne League of Nations, whichshe declared violated the MagnaCharta, Declaration of Independenceand the Constitution.In urging the negro women to go1o the polls she declared that coloredservants are on the same footing aswhite girls who clerk in stores, operate in telephone exchanges, orotherwise work for a living a-nd theyshould avail themselves of their privilege the same as the white women.Her speech contained many of thestandards arguments which the Republicans are using in their effortsto win votes.WH DEMOCRATS SHOULD CON JTRIBUTE(By George White, Chairman Democratic National Committee)Do you believe in Democracy?

Yes; and weappreciate your moral support andthe vote you are going to cast forthe ticket. While that is of firstimportance, it is not enough.If you believe in the principlesfor which this fight is being made,vou want those principles, to prevail.This is a tremendously big country. It is estimated that no fewerthan 30,000,000 people will vote inthe November election. They all arcnot in touch with the sources of infoiimation that are open to you.

Ifa few thousand people apnong themillions who will support our causewith their vote would contribute toour campaign funds until they felt;they had denied themselves this,spiiit of sacrifice would show in certain victory.

And pork is still ourprincipal supply of meat. No otheranimal can compare with the hogjn this respect, chiefly because of itsearly maturity. For instance, a hogis at its best as a meat source before It is one year old, while a beefanimal is killed at a loss before itis two or three years old.PEGGY coughed for an hourafter bedtime until M otherthought of Kemp's Balsam. Ahalf teaspoonful quickly relieved the irritation, after whichshe soon went to sleep.KEMP'S BALSAMWill Step That CoughAnd corn is the greatest hog fattening food, as farmers around Parishave long ago found out. A corncountry is always a hog country andfarmers in the corn belt figure withconfidence that feeding IS bushelsof corn to a 'hog will under ordinarycircumstances produce 100 poundsof live bog. Anyhow, the prices ofcorn and hogs go up and down together. If the young hogs in thecountry, are in sufficient numbers to(consume the coming corn crop tneprice of pork should come down within hailing distance of pre-war figures. Corn prices have been fallingfor some Jmonths and that, too, at atime when the price usually risesIf all goes well with the maturingcrop for the next few weeks, coraiprices will be lower than 1915, porkand pork products will be lower, andthe general public will be in position to see, for the first time sincethe armistice was signed, a tendencyof commodities to get back to morereasonable figures, though of coursenot so low as we were used to beforethe world became upset.CHRISTIAN CHURCH CONVENTION IN ST.
