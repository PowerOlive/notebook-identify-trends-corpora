burial.

TALBOTT
A beautiful life closed Friday af
ternoon at 2:15 o'clock, when death
removed from earthly scenes Mrs.
Salie Warford Talbott, aged seventy
j four at her home on Main street.
I Mrs. Talbott had been in declining
i health for some months, and her
J death was probably hastened by ex
haustion due to her constant atten
tion to and attendance upon her sis
ter, Mrs. Cordelia Parker, who died
at the Talbott home some weeks ago.
Between the sisters there existed a
strong bond of love that was rudely
sundered when death took Mrs. Par
ker after a long illness. Mrs. Talbort
was constantly at her bedside minis
tering to her needs. In this mission
of love her frail frame was greatly
overtaxed, but she would not give up,
and remained the devoted nurse to
the end. To this was added the
strain of ' a physical ailment that
would not yield to treatment. Dur
" ing the last days of her life her
'strength gradually ebbed away
. away and death came peacefully, as
j befits those who lived within tho
j meaning of religious well-doing.
" Mrs. Talbott was the daughter of
the late William and Margaret Kelly
. Ford, pioneer citizens of this city,
and had been a resident of Paris all
her life. In her'girlhood she was
'married to Mr. W. T. Talbott, to
' whom she was ever a loving counsel
lor, a devoted wife and a helpmate
In every sense of the word. She wj:s
a devoted member of St. Peter's Epis
copal church, of this city, and was
prominent in all the good works of
that denomination. She was a woman
woman of kindly impulses, gentie
and affectionate, devoted to her
friends, her home and her church,
and her friends were legion. She
played well -her part in life and her
going away has left a void in home
and church circle that will be hard
to fill.
The funeral was held at St. Peter's
Episcopal church, at four o'clock Sun
day afternoon, with services conduct
ed by Rev. Walter S. Cain, the rec
tor, assisted by Rev. Geo. H. Harris,
21
ose personal friend of the family.
The burial followed on the family
lot in the Paris Cemetery. The pall
bearers were: John Yerkes, Wm. G.
Talbott, Hugh I. Brent, Jo Vardeii,
White Varden, Blair Varden.

A CARD OF THANKS
The election is over and we are
all just as good Democrats as we
were before. We have nothing ta
be grumpy for. I'm thankful for
one thing, the earnest support and
good wishes of my friends, especial
ly the good people of Millersburg
and vicinity. I thank them, and I
thank everyone who gave me their
vote and influence. I have no com
plaint to make, for I'm a good Dem
ocrat. While I'm sorry I will not
serve the people of Bourbon as
Jailer, I'm glad another good man
won. Again, I thank one and all
for anything they did for me in my
race and at the polls.
(It) JOHN T. MAHER.

"This woman's equal rights stuff is
all bosh," says the crusty old Paris
bachelor. "She gets into the bail
games for half-price, pays no poll tax,
and her vote counts as much as a
man's. The most of the men are will
ing for the women to do all the
church-going and building the fires
in winter, but some object seriously
to social equality on election day.
