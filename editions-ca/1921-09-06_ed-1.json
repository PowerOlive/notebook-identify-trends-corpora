,A PARAMOUNT PICTURE
The man had worshipped a beautful woman. Had laid all-his love and hopes at her feet. Only to find her a cold and kill
ing mockery. The girl had worshipped her father. Thought him a saintly benefactor of men. Only to find him a murderous
rogue. So here life had tumbled them broken, hopeless, abandoned a little more clay in a mire of an underworld dive. But
the clay was warm with youth, and in it a glimmer of old, fine dreams. A screen romance like nothing ever shown before.
Athrob with stirring events. Alluring in its beauty. Warm with the beat of hungry human heart.
