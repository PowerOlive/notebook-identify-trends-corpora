By Saturdaynight she should shine like SpotlessTown. Not a guilty tin can mustescape. Dirt, rubbish and tire accumulated riffraff of backyard andalley are doomed to extinction, ifevery citizen does his duty.Paris people need littliB urging tfoperform this duty. The reputationof being the cleanest city of its si?ein the country is a distinction jealously guarded by Paris. Indeed, except for the marshalling of forces'for a concentrated drive, the Cleanup and Paint-Up campaign is hardlynecessary here. The average homeowner in this city is intensely interested in making his property attractive and the acknowledged beauty of the residential districts is atribute to his unremitting toil andcare.We like to believe that Paris people keep their houses and lawns inorder from an inherent love of thebeautiful and not merely becausethey wish to impress the tourist.However, it is a fact that visitors tot&e city are greatly smitten with itscleanliness and carry away withthem lasting thoughts of ciViccomeliness. Such neatness reflectsthe personal characteristics of theinhabitants. For this reason ourClean-Up and Paint-Up campaiemeach yeai' serves the double purpose of satisfying our own aestheticsensibilities and preparing for thecritical scrutiny of the stranger enjoying our hospitality. Paris welcomes the inspection, nomatter howsearching. , .The success of the Clean-Up andPaint-Up campaign, in its entirety,lies in the wholehearted manner inwhich the community itself adoptsitsy various provisions. The application of paint and varnish hereand there, the delving into forgottencorners with spade and hoe, the liberal use of rake and broom certainly produce- wonderful results.Sloveliness is to be tolerated nomore in civic appearance than inpersonal dress. , The rundown, unkempt, unsightly town must alwayslag in the march of progress. Pridein one's city is deeply implanted inthe human breast and humiliatedindeed is the man who has to apologize for the place in which, he lives.While the household, howeverr-isbusily engaged' in""tfie individualand neighborhood assault upon allthat is unclean and unsightly, letthe city authorities continue the cooperation shown by granting waterrent free for thrift gardens. Letthem also enforce the ordinance regarding weeds on vacant lots and endeavor to compel absentee owners toluiLigans me aanaeiion nuisance,which often overwhelms a whole,block from one uncared-for piece ofproperty.The Clean-Up and Paint-Up campaign is a challenger to civic pride,a challenge that Pris has never yetevaded.JPEBTILIZEBHAVE JUST BECEIVED CABLOAD SWIFT'S HIGH GBADE BEDSTEEB BBAND FEBTILIZEB FOBTOBACCO.'

According to history Boone stayedhere until he was 17 years of "age,when he went tp Kentucky. Tradition has it that it was nearby thathe killed his first bear when he was14 years old, and he was scr proudof his achievement that he carved:an inscription on a tree with hishunting m knife, reading: "D. Boonekilled a bear near here."The house has four rooms on thefirst floor, six on the second and anattic. The original Boone dwellinghad two rooms on the first floor andthree on the second, but an additionsimilar to the original in every re-snect was made after the familymigrated.One of the original rooms contains a large fireplace made of stonesand still in ' good condition.
