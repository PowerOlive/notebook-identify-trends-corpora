Rye as a Cover Crop.
Cover crops should he grown in
Kentucy much more than they are.
No matter in what section of the
State one may travel, he may see dur
ing the winter, many corn and tobacco
fields liyng bare, lhe writer has seen
many such fields in the most fertile
sections of the State as well as in the
poorest. To leave cultivated fields in
this condition mean9 great loss. The
fields wash, some very badly, all of
them some unless they are aosolutely
level. The cultivation of the previous
seasun has developed available plant
food that the crop did not use. Much
of this may be lost by leaching. A
cover crop will bind the soil and pre
vent washing. It will use up the avail
able plant food left by the preceding
crop. This will be returned to the soil
whether the over crop is turned under
or pastured. The roots of the cover
crop greatly improve the physicial
condition of the soil, especially i3 thib
true of rye. Fields of poor tilth art
sometimes jmt in good condition oj
one rye cover crop.
Rye is the best non-leguminous crop
in Kentucy. The seed is cheap, li
will grow on,-a wide variety of soils.
It may be sown as early as Septembei
1 or as late as November . It will
make a better growth on winter soil.
Orders Inquiry into
Selling.
Vote
In his charge to the Franklin county
grand juiy at the beginning of the
September term of the Circuit Court
Monday Juge Robert L. Stout dwelt at
some length on vote selling.and direct
ed an investigation to ascertain if tre
practice is indulged to any extent in
that community. He referred to the
uiauuBuub ama severaj months since
'n Adams county, O., and said that
wriie he had no information of sucn
violation of law in Franklin county,
yet it would be well for every com
munity to look into its affairs, that
the bad custum of trafficking in votes
would not become general.

it is a most excellent pasture for pigs,
while in its later ?tai?es it is a wnlpr-

nants may oe turned under in time to
prepare th ground for the next crop.
The Experimental Station makes a
practice of sowing rye in the corn
ground. This is pastured and the
ground then prepared for cowpeas i r
soy beans, which are planted about
June first. This crop comes on in time
to give the ground good preparation ,

two bushels of rye per acre, and put it

The cover crop not only prevents
washing, saves fertility, and provides
pasture, out it adds humus to the soil.
Try rye as a cover crop if you have
not done so,

A Beautiful Affair.
The Winchester Demcorat says:
"The reception at the Methodist
church last Friday evening to welcome
Preisdent J. L. Clark and Professor
Goodtich White of the Kentucky Wes-1-syaa.
College and to bid farewell to
Rev. O. J. Chandler and wife was a
delightful affair. Early Autumn bloss-,
oms combined with ferns were used in
the decorations for the church and an
ice coursewas served. On every side'
were expresisons of deepest regret
over the deprature of Mr. Chandler
and his wife, who have endeared them-'
selves to all denominations of this J
city. The welcome of the new mem
bers of the K. W. C. was cordial and
suggestive of the good things in store
for them during their stay in Winchester."
