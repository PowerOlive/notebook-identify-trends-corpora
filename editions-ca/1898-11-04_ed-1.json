A TOUCHY OLD COMMODORE
Insisteil on Running His Own Man-of-war
Even on Sundays
A story is told of an old commodore
at the Boston yard whose method of
measuring religious affairs was with
the same inexorable rule used for tem
poral things One Sunday morning he
was aroused from his nap by something
out of the usual routine being announc
ed from the pulpit and he sternly ad
dressed the chaplain with Whats
that Whats that The chaplain de
murely repeated the notice that by or
der of th bishop of the dicese divine
service will be performed in this chapel
on Thursday evening next etc
By whose order
By order of the bishop of the dio
cese sir
Well thundered the commodore
Ill let you know that I am bishop of
this diocese and when I want service
in this chapel Ill let you know Pipe
down and he cleared the chapel
On one occasion he heard a different
voice in the pulpit from usual and
looking up he asked Who is that up
there Is that you Billy McMastets
Yes sir
Billy was a religious foremanin the
yard who sometimes helped the chap
lain along
Come down out of tbat thundered
the commodore When I want a relief
for the chaplain Ill appoint one Dont
you ever let me catch you up there
again and he cleared the chapel
again On a Man-of-War

elty in the story
On the voyage the mother-in-law fell
ill and died Of course she had to be
buried at sea and so the usual canvas
sack was made but instead of an iron
weight to sink the body they used a
bag of coal
In commenting on the arrangements
afterward the beieaved son-in-law who
stuttered badly said
I I always knew where
was g goiug but

or Government Money
At close of our Civil War in 1865
there appeared in the London Times
the following
If that mischievous financial pol
icy which had its origin in the North
American Republic during the late
Civil War in that country should be
come indurated down to a fixture
then that government will furnish its
money without cost It will have all
the money that is necessary to carry
on its trade and commerce It will
become prosperous beyond precedent
in the history of civilized nations of
the world The brain and wealth of
all countries will go to North America
THAT GOVERNMENT MUST BE
DESTROYED OR IT WILL DE
STROY EVERY MONARCHY ON
THIS GLOBE
The famous Hazzard circular to
capitalists in iew iorK ana ine xsueiii
Bankcircular toUnited States Bank
ers Dotn emanating irom London ana
the fabulous corruption fund raised in
England and Germany estimated at
1500000 were the agents that se
cured the closing of our mints against
silver
The walk into my parlor policy
of England during and since the
Spanish War is the latest evidence
of English Diplomacy in shaping the
destiny of the United States Govern
ment
Notwithstanding the famine price
of wheat the Spanish War and fabu
lous expenditures of money by our
government during the past year gold
has increased in value eleven per cent
and all other values decreased in the
same proportion
For a thorough understanding of
the money question or silver issue
the Cincinnati Enquirer has uniformly
given evidence of its ability to teach
explain and produce all facts and
truth It is a paper that ought and
can be read by all classes with pleas
ure and profit
