Earlywine May be Nominated.
There is a movement on loot among
the leading memberslof the new Pro
gressive party in the Seventh Congres
sional District favoring the'nomination
of J. L. Earlywine, formerJPostmaster
of Paris, to oppose Hon. CamDbelLCan
trill, of Georgetown, who is the Demo
cratic nominee to succeed himself.
Since it became known that Hon
Henry T. Duncan, of Lexington, would
decline the nomination recently ten
dered him, the District Committee has
been discussing a probable successor
and it is eaid they strongly favor Mr.
Earlywine for the place.
The committee will hold a meeting
soon at which it is said Mr. Earlv
wine will be named. Earlywine is one
of the turemost progressives in the dis
trict nnd has taken an active Dart in
its affairs, since the organization of
the new party. He was Senator Brad
ley's private secretary during the four
years he was chief executive of the
State.
Takes L. Ns $59,496.
State Auditor Bosworth has accep
ted 59,496 from the Louisville and
Nashville railroad as part payment of
the franchise tax assessed against that
road this ysar.
This amount is the same that the L.
& N. paid to the State last year in
franchise taxes. It is" stated that it
was necessary for this amount to be
tendered or paid by the L. & N. in or
der that it might file a suit enjoining
and restraining the Auditor from en
forcing the collection of the balance of
the franchise tax assessed this vear
amounting to 167,644.37.
The total amount of taxes due from
the L. & N.'under the recent assess
ment is $227,140.37, and the suit filed
b efore Judge Cochran is to enjoin the
collection amounting of franchise tax
; paid last year or 59,496.
Wreck Nttr Kittrton. N
- Nearly ji gcore' of : peridhi were in
jured, none of them leriouslywhen
southbound passenger train No. 37 ran
through an open switch about one
quarter of a- mile north' of Kiaerton
Friday morning, and struck a cut of
cars standing on a siding, derailing the
engine and imperiling the lives of the
large number of passengers.
That no fatalities resulted from the
wreck is regarded as miraculous. The
passengers were thrown from their
seat by the force of the impact and
hurled to the end of the coaches,
safe in the express car saved the
of express messenger Elmer Harp,
was sitting behind it and when
A
life
He
the
fast moving train struck the obstruc
tion, it plowed its wav through the
heavy express packages to the end of
the car, making a path for the protec
tion of the messenger, who. however,
was buried beneath a .number of pieces
of'smaller freight.
The train was running rapidly when
it reached a section which is being
double tracked. Here a switch had
been left open, by whom has not yet
been determined. The tram struck
the cut of construction cars on the sid
ing. The engine of the passenger was
thrown from the track on which it was
running across the opposite track,
completely wrecking the locomotive.
The train bad only a few moments
before left a section of the track over
which it had slow orders, and had it
been running at its usual rate of speed
to make the steep grade near the
point of the wreck nothing could have
prevented a serious lose of life. Fire
man Joe Faulkner, who saw that a
collision was imminent jumped from
the rapidly moving locomotive and was
badly injured. Engineer Edward
Price remained at his post, and suc
ceeded in reversing his engine and
applying the emergency brakes. He
escaped injury other than a slight
shaking up. '
Two of the construction cars in the
path'of the locomotive were reduced
to splinters and twisted masses of iron
by the force of the impact. When the
report of the wreck reached this city
itw as greatly exaggeraed, and it was
said a number had been killed. A spe
cial relief train.was made up and rjsh
ed to the scene, carrying several phy
sicians arid surgical supplies. Every
thing for the comfort of the passen
gers was done by the railroad officials.

Jimmy Poole Hurls for Colonels.
Friends of Jimmy Poole, ex-Bourbon-ite.
will be pleased to learn that he is
still in the rank of pitching stars, al
though lor the past, two seasons all
rtrack of him has been practically lost.
Thursday Poole bobbed up in Louis
ville and helped the Colonels in the
game on that day against Indianap
olis. His oponents won, however, but
faulty support was the cause. The
Courier-Jaurnal had the following to
say of his work on the mound :
"Manager Hayden sprang a surprise
on President Grayson and the fans yes
terday when he sent Poole, a Blue
Grass League product, to the mound.
Poole pitched good ball in the Ken
tucky class 'D' league and during the
present season was with Norfolk. He
came through Lniusvill and Manaeei
Hayden took him to help out in the
final series.. The youngster pitched
good ball all the way and if he had
had any kind of support nehind him
might have won. As it was, he held
the Indians back until the Colonels
caught up and then he was yanked
and Richter substituted."
Poole was a member of the 1910 pen
naut winning aggregation representing
Paris in the Blue Grass League and
was here the latter part of the 1909
season. Last year he was Tsold (to
Norfolk and has been with that club
for the past two season's.

STfCE. CMf AHrFAW NOTES.
Tobacco growers in Madion coun
ty report the best crep in quality in
many years and they are very jubilant
over the prospect forhigher prices.
Land in Nicholas countv is bring
ing record prices. The 100 acre farm
of William Dinsmore. deceased, near
this city, was sold to George Fishback
for 138.50 per acre. K
There is some complaint of tobac
co burning in the field in some sections
of Bath county, and some slight dam
age has been done by the intense heat
to tobacco cut before it could be hous
ed but taken all together growers
claim that they have saved the best
crop ever raised in the county.
Over $300,000 was paid out in
Montgomery county the past wepk for
stock,cattle and yearlings over 10,000
head changing nands. The run of cat
tie was.the largest years, and quali
ty was good. Buyers were present
from all over Kentuckv, Ohio and Illi
nois. The prices paid were very high
1,000 pound feeder selling for 6 1-2
cents per pound.
The farm of the late Thomas H.
Grubbs. in Montgomery county, wa3
soldhy heirs to Henry R. Prewitt, for
mer Democratic chairman and lnsur.
ance Commissioner. The farm cer
tains 150 acres and is one of the best
in the county. The price was $200 ?n
acre. This is the largest price ever
paid for farm lands in Montogmerv
county. Mr. Prewtt will remodel the
place and make hi3 home there.
Five cent eggs are now predicted.
The authority for the statement of
what may be expected next wintei u
Prof. F. S. Jacoby, of Ohio State Uni
versity, head of the poultry depart
ment. His investigations have dis
closed that'storage eggs are now neing
used in cities when usually they are
held in reserve at this season of the
year. Laying hens are scarce, he says,
owing to a variety of causes, and hen
fruit is likely to soar unusually high
this winter.
The three days trotting meeting,
which was to have been held in Mt
Sterling Ociober 3, 4 and 5, has been
declared off, the reasons being the
lack of intreest taken by the horse
men in Kentucky and the failure to
secure more than a dozen entries for
the entire meeting. Horsemen
throughout the State wanted the meet
ing postponed until after the Lexing
ton trots, but as this was getting very
late it was deemed advisable to call
the meeting off altogether.
The third annual sale of registered
Jersey cattle by James E. Middleton
at MapleG rove stock afrm near Shel
byville realized S6.150 for the v51 head
offered, composed principally of young
heifers, and calves. Thelargest price3
paid were $350 for Dierotte's Fairy,
an imported cow, and $300 for a daugh
ter of Lady Marv. Both were sold to
E. W. Crickert, Martinsville, Ind. G.
F. Northcott, Meridian, Miss., bought
a young calf from Lady Mary for $170.
Mr. Middleton regards thi3 as the best
sale he has ever made. Col. D. L.
Berry, of Columbus, Ind., was the
auctioneer. Buyers from several
states were present.
The man, whether he lives in the
city, in the village, or in the country,
who has fresh eggs and tender poultry
need never worry as to whether there
will be a market for his products. No
matter what othpr things may be sub
ject to fluctuation, there is always an
immediate market for fresh eggs.
They can be tur ned into money with
in a very short Jtime after they are
produced, and this fact of itself 13
enough to put a solid foundation under
the poultry business You can begin
the business in a small way and build
uo, turning your produce from day to
day into money without any trouble at
all. The bigger your business grow3,
the more you become interested. Start
right, and don't overreach yourself
and you are bound to make a success.
Others are doing it every day, and
what others can do you can do.
