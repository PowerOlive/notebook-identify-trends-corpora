shows that there are votes to be had,
not for the asking alone, but by sim
ply sending in your name. As soon as
yourname appears in the column of
contestants votes will come in for you
from all over your district, not alone
fiom friends, but from strangers as
well, who axe interested and desire to
help someone in their district to win.
So enter yor name at once so as to be
on the list at the earliest possible date
it may mean a number of votes for
you.
Persons living away from Paris need
not hesitate to send in subscriptions
secured by them, as we will issue re
ceipts for the money sent and mail the
votes to the contestants for whom they
are intended, or else to the subscrib
er, whichever mav be desired. Those
living at a distance will receive the
same attention, and their interests will
be as carefully luoked after as those
living within a atony's throw of The
News office. The contest is for Paris
and vicinity and not for any one sec
tion, and candidates in the districts
furthest from the office may rest as
sured that they will be treated as fair
ly as those living close by.
VOTES NOT TRANSFERABLE.
A number who have withdrawn from
the contest in the past have requested
that their votes be transferred to one
of their friends in the contest. This,
of course, ha not been done. 'AJ1 votes
issued on subscriptions MUST bear
the names of the contestant for whom
they are to be voted before they leave
this office. No blank votes are issued
and votes once issued to a contestant
cannot be transferred undei any cir
cumstances, to another. If votes were
issued and given out on subscriptions
without the name of the person for
whom they were to be voted written
thereon, they could be transferred
without any alteration or sold, and
thereby give some contestant an undue
advantage. Therefore votes issued on
subscriptions will always bear the
name of the contestant for whom they
are to be voted before they leave the
office, and under no circumstances will
votes of any kind be transferred to an
other than the contestant for whom
they have been issued.
SHE WAS WILLING.
If you're going to be a candidate, be
one. Don't be ashamed of it. Don't
go on record as being in the "recep
tive" class. Strong characters, the
successful men and women of this age,
are not tucking themselves away in
some dark corner awaiting the arrival
of some Columbus to discover their
talents. Active, aggressive, concen
trated energy is the fabric of which
success is woven in this hustling, tur
bulent old world.
"Oh, to be sure, I'd take one of the
prizes and be awfully glad," gurgled
a vivacious little candidate to the
Campaign Manager this week. "You
may just leave my name in the list and
if my friends care to vots for me I will
certainly be most happy, but, why, I
just simply couldn't ask any one to
support me."
GET BUSY NOW.
Now what do you think of that as a
manifestation of the old axiom of
"Spirit willing but flesh is weak"
Willing to take a magnificent prize on
a silver platter and garnished with the
water cress of sweet friendship, but
unwilling or unable to turn a hand to
iurther the cause which would bring
honor and Drofit to her. Again, and
in glaring" capitals. "DON'T BE A
RECEPTIVE CANDIDATE."
Regret for the mistake of yesterday
is vain and is the recourse of the weak
ling: "I'll do it tomorrow" is a lauda
ble sDirit. but "Do it now' is much
better and is the verv essence of wis
dom. So get busy RIGHT NOW.
