CAMPBELL CANTRlLL,of Scott county.Perkins' Wealth.'George W. Perkins in thechair."to Mr.t xiiia ijuuiaiiuii uuco ijul icici1 Perkins in the chair at the Ghicago, Muosefelt Convention. On the conj trary, it is taken from the minutes ofa meeting of the finance committee ofj the steel trust, held April 5, 1904, ath- hifc decided that subsidiaryi comcanies of the steel trust manufac-turing half finished articles shouldnot sell same to the competitors of tnetrust.This is only one of the revelationscontained in the report of the StanleySteel Trust investigating committee,one of the most able and remarkabledocuments ofjthe decade. .The Stanleyreport, in addition to the indicting former President Roose"eIt for premitting the steel trust to obtain absolutedomination of the steel industry, reveals beyond successful contradictionhow Geroge W. Perkins came into possession of the collossal fortune that heis now spending to finance the Roosevelt third ternwnovement.Here is the story of the Perkinswealth: To start with, Mr. Perkinsmade some of his millionsjby caditalizing thin blue air into millions of dollars of real money. He made meremillions by getting a monopoly ofwirenail manufacturing plants and forcingthe American farmers'to pay So. 50 perkeg toenails for which they formerlyhad paid for from $1.25 to $1.50 perkeg. Then he made more by forcingthe thousands of workers in the blastfurnaces ot his steel mills to work 12hours a day, seven days a week, and365 days a year.As a postscript to the above information, the folio wine nis.tory of Mr.Perkins may be of interest to many atthis.time: Mr. Perkins was the chiefaid and co-schemer of J. Pierpontrtat railroads, banks and trust companies, express, telephone and telegraph companies, steamboat lines, insurance companies, and all the greatindustrial trusts, to the end that Mor-J gan now has a strangle hold on a corporate wealth of over 35,000,000.000,an amount equal to one third of thewealth of the nation.j Per Capita Wealth,j Sixty years ago the' per capita'wealth in the United Slates was 307;tjday it is about $1,300, an i'lcrense oi! about 300 ptr 'ent. While thepei capita weaith has greatly increased, thedistribution of it has been most'"unequal.

Stanley, of Kentucky, chairman of the committee ofthe House of Representatives whichinvestigated the Steel Trust, deservesgreat credit for the systematic andhighly capable way in which he conducted the inquiry.The cost of the entire investigationwas but $39,000. This amount is instriking contrast to the cost of someof the investigations under the Republicans, notable tnat oi tne immigration question at an expense to the people of more than $600,000.Mr. Stanley saw to it that there wasno personal excursions or juncketswith the money, appropriated for theprohe of the steel corporation. Hewas willing to spend money for allnecessary expenses, hut was carefulthat not a dollar was squandered.It will be recalled that the investigators of th immigration questionspent their appropriations like water,touring Europe in the most luxuriousstyle, visiting, "at the governments expense, all the prominent places of interest, even journeying to the pryarnids in Egypt.Mr. Stanley's name will go down inhistory along with the masterful report of his committee, and he and themembers of the committee who co-operatedwith him, deserve well in theestimation of the American people forthe work well done."White Fungus" Destroying theChinch Bug.Among the numerous plans suggested for getting rid of destructive farmpests, that of cutltivating. scatteringand thus setting at work their naturalenemies, has perhaps appealed to thepopular imagination more stronglythan anv other. Since germs multiplynaturally and spontaneously under favorable conditions so aa to slay theirthousands and tens cf thousands, why,it is asked, cannot these small parasites be propagated artificially andthen be sown broadcast to do theiri deadly work whenever we desire.The woik thus far done along thelineat the Kentuckyjsnd ether Experiment Stations shows that 'it is easyenough to grow some of these para-Clfoo in lovrn nnnniifioo liit h lr Vi.-difficulty arises in getting them tospreadwhpn nnnn?prl hv nnfavn,...' aweather, it must be remembered that 'Hip nnnriitinn mnt fovnrahio i in.1cpf.f-q uun thp phinph-hnrye L.,nhasdrought, are least favorab'e to their- . . -- - ... -. ...... w?-, WUWIJfungus narasites.Yet it is remained that the chinchbug becomes troublesome and remainsso without regard for weather conditions, whenever its enemies are not athand, a fact showing that it is affectedbv the weather only indirectly; that,in other words, the weather controlsit by controlling the numbers of itsparasites. If the parasites are notpresent in a locality tlie chinch-bugsimply luxuriates until they appear,and i ia with this thought in mindthat the Entomologist and Botanist ofjthe Kentucky station has made preparations to furnish Kentucky farmersWith cultures of the white funcus foruse against chinch-bugs.Ir the.bugs are present in corn fieldseven in small numbers it may be wellto establish the fungus there asr a precaution against further increase intheir numbers, though n will De joundeasier to set it at work where a largesupply of bugs can be secured at onetime. Judging by recent complaintsof injury to corn, Grant, Gallatin, andHenry counties offer an excellent fieldin 'which to test the white fungus.Directions for using the fungUH willaccompany each package sent out fromthe Station.

Attacked by a mysterious creature, variously described asa "monstrous amphibious animal" anda "furious freak fish," Daniel Miller, ashad fisherman, was rescued fromharm by his companion, Harry Taylor,in the Delaware river off Gloucester,N. J.For five minutes after the creaturehad been hauled into their boat itgave battle. Until Miller became exhausted he fought the attacks with hisfists. Taylor, who was operating the"boat, was afraid to leave his positionwhile the battle waged, for fear theboat would capsize.Miller, who is one of the oldest fishermen in Gloucester, accompanied byTaylor, set out with nets for shadearly this morning. Shortly beforenoon, when they were preparing to return home with their supply of fish,they pulled in the net.As they brought it to the surface theweight became v noticeably heavy.There was a constant jerking at theropes. At last they were unable topull the net any higher and lashed itto the side of the boata. When Milleropened the net the creature sprangfrom the water at him. The forcesent Miller sprawling into the middleof the boat. The creature, which hadtwo rows of long teeth, snapped nthim viciously.When the fishermen finally landedtheir "catch" on land, hundreds of persons flocked to see the creature. Itwas taken to Miller's boathouse. Fishermen who have seen and caughtmany kinds of fish shook their headsTTIKT BROS.PARIS, KENTUCKY.KWrWIMiM flKWH W 'I i IM M "UHir rH!

The tail alone measures 3 feet.The head resembles the head of alarge "snapper" and is not unlike thatof an alligator. It has twenty teeth,some short and ragged, while those inthe front are shaped like a dog's,long and pointed.On its broad dgray back are scalesfrom one to two inches in length,which overlap one another. The creature has four feet, like those of an alligator. . When standing it would beabout a foot from the ground. Thetail, shaped like a huge cone, resembles the tail of an alligator.A number of the oldest fishermenbelieved at first that the creature wasa lizard more than two centuries old,while others declared that the thinganswers to the description of the "Jersey devil,' which several years agogave the entire eastern states a fright.The thing will be kept by Mr. Millerat his bath house and placed on exhibition for a few days. In the meantime the scientific authorities atWashington have been asked to examine the creature and pass judgment asto what it may be.Blamed a Good Worker.

Detwiler. pastorof the West End Methodist, churchChicago, said in a recent sermon thathe had never found cause for complaint against the telephone girl. Dr.Detwiler delivered aa sermon upon"Courtesy," and severely criticizedsome people on their conduct. He referred" to a church member who hadsDoken in suchmanner to a street carconducter that he was compelled tomake an apology to the company. Heshowed now it pays to be courteouson trains, in hotels and other places.On several occasions he showed howby standing aside quietly when therewas a scramble and confusion he hadsecured the best room in a hotel tand alower berth in a Pullman car, whileothers in a scramble ahead ot him lostout.Dr. Detwiler showed how courtesy isa big factor in practical religion. Headm tted'.that there are provocationsand sometimes things don't work exactly right. In using the telephonewhenihis occurs he thinks of how theoperator has been at her post since 7o'clock in the morning and has beenpersecuted by many others, and he iswilling to hold his peace.
