SPECIAL ATTRACTIONS AT THE
ALAMO AND GRAND
Dorothy Dalton got all the exer
cise ''she wanted in "The Crimson
Challenge," her new Paramount
picture, which will be seen at the
Alamo and Paris Grand this after
noon and night. Besides doing a lot
of horseback riding and a number of
chase scenes in which she ran down
the villian, mounted on a fast horse,
sne rouna that merely to carry
around two large six-shooters in a
heavy cartridge belt with holsters
I was no easy task.
"They felt as if they wieghed a
ton," said the star. In the litle role
of Tharon, the has a vigorous West
ern part a girl who can shoot with
either .hand, ride a puncher and
fight with the roughest of them.
Gloria Swanson, Paramount star,
can't swim a stroke!
That didn't deter her, however,
when it became necessary for scenes
in "Behind the Rocks," her latest
starring vehicle, showing at the
Alamo and Grand tcv-morrow after
noon and night, from plunging into
the. ocean near Catalina Island, out
of her own boat and then keeping
up to the best of her ability until
rescued by Rodolph Valentino, who
plays the leading man's role.
"Women Men Love," the big
special six-reel picture, which will
be seen at The Alamo Thursday af
ternoon, brings William Desmond
back to us in a role such as made
him front rank favorite in the old
Triangle days. "Women Men Love"
is the story of a, "man who loved his
weak and beautiful wife so well
that he went down to and finally
brought her back to the Throne.

that extended aver a period of
several weeks. For several days
previous to her death Mrs. Rice had
been confined to her bed, and was
in an unconscious condition several'
daysprior to her death. t Her condi
tion had been recognized as very.
critical for some time by her ( f am-,
ily and relaaives had been notified.
Mrs. Rice was a native of Bour-'
bon county, born at North' Middle

one child who died in infancy. A
cousin, Miss Lillie Williams, of Kan
sas City, who has been living with
Mrs. Rice, from childhood, has given
her life, as it were, in service and
devotion to Mrs. Rice, and adminis
tering affection and attention to
her at all times without thought of
herself, extending the tender love
and affection that a living daugh
ter would have given.
Mrs. Rice was a faithful and de
voted member of the North Middle
town Christian church, with which
she united when a young girl, and
her love for these life-long friends,
together with memories of hallowed
associations, prompted her to retain
her membership in that church,
attending services regularly when
her health would permit, in her
adopted home city. Hers was a
gentle, lovable nature, happiest
when giving pleasure to others, and
her home was an abiding place for
a multitude of friends.
Mrs. Rice is survived by one
brother, James1 Carroll Bryan, Sr.,
another brother, W. S. Bryan, pre
ceding her to the grave two years
ago. She is also survived by her
cousin, Miss Lillie Williams; five
nieces and nephews, Mrs. F. Skinner
Kerr, of Winchester, and Mr. Logan
Bryan, of North Middletown, chil
dren of Mr. C. Bryan, Sr., Mrs.
Charles A. Snyder, of Louisville, Mr.
William T. Bryan, of Paris, and Mr.
James Carroll Bryan, Jr., of North
Middletown, children of the late
late W. S. Bryan. ""Mrs. Hiram S.
Redmon, of Paris, is also a first
cousin.
The funeral was held at the home
on Pleasant street, at 2:30 o'clock,
Sunday afternoon, with services con
ducted by Rev. W. F. Ellis, pastor of
