foreignrelations committee unexpectedly preciptatedi discussion on the Cuban question It linallyJed to a passage at arms between Mr ChandlerN H and Mr Frye in which the former madesome sarcastic references to the conduct of theforeign relations committee and to the attitudeof the president Upon the conclusion of theCuban discussion the sundry civil appropriation was taken up and 35 pages of it were disjxsed of before adjournmentHouse For three hours Thursday the packed galleries and excited members of the houselistened to a passionate outburst of oratory onthe Cuban question during which the intensityof feeling was alternately manifested by cheersjeers and hisses Time and again the excitedthrongs in the galleries were admonished to besilent and once at least it seemed asif a motion would be made to clear themWashington April 2 Senate In theopen session Friday Mr Chandler N Hcalled up the resolution he introduced Thursday requesting the president to send theCuban consular correspondence to the senateand at his suggestion it was referred to thecommittee on foreign relations Immediately afterward however he introduced another resolution which went over calling uponthe secretary of state for the same information Bills passed To authorize the secretaryof the interior to issue a permit to the American Invalid society of Boston to occupy 10acres of land on the abandoned Fort Stantonmilitary reservation in New Mexico for anational sanitarium for the treatment olpulmonary diseases to extend the rightof commutation to certain homesteadsettlers on lands in

torpedo boat destroyersto 24 the bill as reported providing foibut 12 The amendment of Mr Cannonchairman of the appropriations committee tcreduce the number of battle ships to one wasburied under an overwhelming majority Theprovision relating to armor plate which inordinary times would have precipitated a debate of several days was disposedof in ten minutes a proposition to decrease the price agreed to in thebill from i400 to 300 per ton being drowned ina perfect chorus of noes Mr Cmnon duringthe course of the day announced the belief ofa majority of the members that war would beupon us within a week and Mr Dearmond Momade a notable speech declaring that if hostilities were to come it was our duty to strikethe lirst blowWashington April 5 Senate It wasfrankly and openly charged in the senate Monday by Mr Perkins Cal in a set speechthat Spain was responsible for the Maine disaster as it had been brought about by Spanishmachinations and Spanish treachery Thisspeech of Mr Perkins was only one of four jprepared addresses upon the Cuban jtion delivered in the Senate Monday jMr Turner Wash introduced a resolution which he asked should go overuntil Tuesday if in the meantime nothinghas been done in the matter The resolutiondirects the committee on foreign relations toreport at the earliest moment without waiting for the concurrence or advic j of any department of the government what action ifany in view of the Maine disaster and of thedeplorable condition of Cuban affairs shouldbo taken to preserve the honor and dignity ofthis countryHouse While there was no attempt to forceconsideration for a resolution regarding theCuban situation in the house Monday therewas a brief outbreak in the course of whichthe war like temper of the crowded galleries was so manifest that Speaker Reedthreatened to clear them if it was repeatedThe outbreak occurred over a bill which wasfinally passed to authorize the presidentto erect temporary fortifications in case ofemergency upon land when the written consentowners was obtained without awaitingtneaiong -process or legal condemnation MrSrout rep Vt introduced the followingJoint resolution recognizing the independenceof the republic of Cuba and for other purposesWashington April C Senate In executive session of the senate Tuesday a resolutionwas offered that the entire Cuban question beconsidered behind closed doors on account ofthe probability of utterance which would afford information to the enemy The proposition was debated but without reaching a conclusion While the senate was in executivea formidable clement in thentc was considering what should be done incase resolutions should be reported providingfor recognition of independence The resolution offered by Mr Turner Wash declaringwar against Spain was laid before the senateand its author took the iloor in advocacy of itMr Kenncy Del followed with a strong appeal for the independence of the CubansThere is not said he

MitchellCN Y A general statement of the purposesof the committee was printed some days agoand but few changes have since been made inthe details of the billWashington April 7 Senate When thecnate convened Wednesday intense expectancy amounting to excitement prevailed bothon the floor and in the galleries The presidents message had been positively promisedand its coming was awaited with genuineanxiety Ten minutes after the senate convened consideration of the sundry civil billwas resumed and with the exception of eightniuutes consumed by executive session inwhich Senator Davis announced that no message would be sent in almost the entire session was consumed by the appropriation billtt w s practically completed when laid asideTor the dayHouse After waiting patiently in the galleries and corridors of the house for hoursmany of them from 8 oclock Wednesday morning until shortly before 3 oclock in the afternoon the thousands Avho had come to hear thepresidents Cuban message turned away wearytnd disgusted at the delay Never was thereuch disappointment at the capitol The members felt it even more keenly than the spectators and for two hours afterward they stoodabout lobbies discussing this latest phaseof the situation The news of the proposed armistice which came on theheels of the announcement that Gen Lee hadcabled for delay received quite as much attention as the recall of Lee The debate in progress in the house over the army reorganizationaill attracted little or no attention Considerable opposition to the bill developed on theground that its provision for an extension ofthe regular army in time of war to 10 1000 mentvouldbe inimical to the national guard andthevolunteer forces upon which the countryhad heretofore relied in time of stress

Before Monday in Order to Allow Americans to GetOut of HavanaWashington April 7 Swift as acannons flash changed the Cuban situation Wednesdaj The galleries ofcongress were crowded senators andrepresentatives were anxious and agitated even the diplomatic corps wasin a ferment awaiting a message fromthe president of the United States tothe congress of the American peoplethat might mean war when withexcitement at the highest like an electric flash the word passed that therewould be no message Wednesday Itssuddenness stunned the public whichheard the news in distorted formsand amazed veteran members ofcongress Ultimately it becameknown that not only would there beno message Wednesday but no message this week and that it was at leasta possibility the message written andapproved might never go to congressat all The first reason for the delaywas that the administration receivedadvices from Gen Lee at Havana indicating that ail Americans could notbe gotten off the island Wednesdayand would be in grave peril if the message preceded their departure Thesecond reason and perhaps theequally potent with the otherslowly drifted into public comprehension late in the day chieflythrough the medium of published dispatches from Madrid for extreme reticence was maintained on the subjectby the few in Washington who knewthe facts and even cabinet officerswere unadvised on the subject Thisimportant news was that the Spanishgovernment after what plainly hadbeen most exciting time in inner Spanish circles at Madrid had decided toreopen the case closed so far as thisgovernment was concerned by the refusal of Spain to make satisfactory response to the representations made bythe United States last week and inorder to avert impending war had decided to make concessions heretoforerefused What will be the final outcome it is too early to say but the aspect of affairs certainly is considerablymore pacific and sufficient to renewthe hope of the president in a solutionof the Cuban question satisfactoryto the American people and achievedwithout bloodshed The detailsremain to be worked out but it isexpected that between now andMonday a clearer light will be thrownon the future by action at Madrid ofwhich one important feature at leastis the declaration of an armistice bythe queen regent of Spain This armistice it is expected will lead to ultimate independence of Cuba from Spanish rule but by what intermediatesteps perhaps even the governingpowers do not at this time knowMuch it is supposed will depend uponthe Cuban insurgents and the peopleof the two countries the United Statesand SpainThe powers of Europe material andmoral it is known brought to bear alltheir influence on the government ofSpain and still are actively at workseeking by the wisest and most politecourse necessar3r in view of the circumstances and sentiments of the wogreat nations involved to bringpeace out of the gathering warclouds All the capitals of Europehave been in communication tothis end a fact evidenced by theassemblage at the British embassyin this city Tuesday of the representative of the six great powers of Europewho then and there were made mutually acquainted with what had beendone abroad and with the desire ofthose who accredited them to Washington that they should work in accord here this concert however in theUnited States not to go to beyonda mild tender of good officesto sectire peace and delaya definite declaration of war if hostilities finally became inevitable Someof the representatives assembled atSir Julian Pauncefotes may have wished to offer mediation but if so werewarned against it by others in the conference who understood more clearlythat such a procedure would be resented and work to hostile and not topeaceful endsThe improved condition of affairswas reflected throughout all publicquarters late in the day It was manifested at the white house among cabinet officers and at the embassies andlegations including the Spanish legation At the latter establishment Senor Polo said that whilehe could not disclose any of theinformation reaching him in anofficial character yet he feltthat the strain of a few hours ago wasmaterially relieved and that the prospects for peace looked much brighterHe in no way confirmed nor would heeven discuss views entertained inother high official quarters that Spainwas slowly but surely yielding andconfined his utterances to the generalstatement that conditions- were improvingA generally quieter feeling was evident at the war and navy departmentswhere in contrast to the feverish excitement of the past week the tone wasalmost a pathetic While there wasthe usual amount of routine attendantupon the recent work of preparationthings Wednesday settled down almostto the normal No more contractsfor new vessels were closed by the wardepartment and no changes in thestations of ships announced Wednesday was also noticeable for the absence of the conferences of high

SpainLondon April 7 The Vienna correspondent of the Times explains a planof settlement which offers an acceptable compromise if not too late andwhich has already come under thenotice of one of the parties concernedHe saysThe scheme involves giving Cubaautonomy but placing the island in arelation towards Spain similar to thatwhich Eg3rpt sustains toward TurkeyUnder this plan Cuba would pay an annual tribute to Spain while Americawould be entrusted with the control ofthe Cuban finances and have the samestanding there as England has inEgypt The United States wouldguarantee the Spanish loan

daughter of six short yearsOne whole year since she had beenalone and Ilelena had been singingwith the angelsShe snid that she was not rebelliousthat she did noanoui n as those without hope but- yet that life never couldagain wear the joyous aspect that thepast had wornEven when she endowed a ward in theChildrens hospital and had given to itthat precious name The Helena shecould not adopt her pastors wise suggestion and present her dear onesplaythings to the invalid waifs whowere to occupy it She furnished theward tastefully and bought new toysforitbuther heart rebclliously clung tothe sad pleasure of keeping the nurseryjust as it had been left when Godcalled its guest homeShe said she was getting resignedand she busied herself woricing amongthe poor and giving in Helenas nameand passed her leisure amid the surroundings that kept her thoughts toomuch on the earthly part of her sorrowHyre she daily sighed over the whitecanopied short length bed and tenderly touched the toy tea table and thearmchair to match it in which Helenaalways sat when she played at fiveoclock tea She lingered tearfullyover the china tea set that would neverhold again the play suppers and sorrowfully looked

could be spared andthat was not much The doctor cameand asked me to investigate the caseand sec if I could interest some of theladies I knew I found no food nomoney scarcely a hit of fuel and thehalf crazed djing man scolding because he was cold and finding fault thatthe chicken broth he longed for had notbeen brought to him Poor man he istoo far gone to know the reason whyand blames his wife says she is tired ofwaiting upon him I went to a kindmarket man and he has sent up a basket full of provisions so that thej willhave supper and breakfast at least Butthey need fuel clothes

shewas nearly exhausted with overworkwatching and weepingThe tale brief as it was had to be toldwith frequent pauses as the invalid inthe next room coughed or tinkled a bellfor her to come to change

a washing done formc before in my life except when thebabies came Here she lowered hervoice though the door was partlyclosed And so I thought we could getalong without any more washing tillit was all

enduring deprivationThey sat in silence as if abashed bythe presence of coming death and thepoverty about them as well as by thepresence of a beautiful stranger Hadshe not been in black they would havethought her a fairy but they had neverread o fairies clothed in mourningThey were doing nothing as the verypoor often arc found because hadnothing to do withMrs Crandall was as neat as her poverty would permit her to be Therewere neither rags nor unkempt heads ofhair but patches were plainly in evidence and the lack of comforts everywhereMr Crandall had been failing formany months and now the doctor hadsaid that it was but a question of dayswhen he would be out of his miseryTheir few savings for they had been athrifty family had soon melted awayfor his medicines and their daily foodThe doctor expected no pay for his timeand advice but the druggist had demanded cash for each prescriptionfilled Mrs Crandall pitifully told howshe had managed at first- by the helpof the two older girls about the housebefore and after school daily to findodd moments to sew by daylight buther needlewoiic had been chiefly doneat night when her husbands naps werelongest Yet she had only delayed thehour which was now to be met whenthere was nothinjr forgrocerdruggistorCustomers naturally had carried theirwork elsewhere as so often her workwas not finished at the time promisedthe husband requiring

with her for she wouldnot sa3 she was willing Then I wentand oifered the doll to the woman ifshe would take all my things overthere and do them for me and she saidshe would and the neighbors are talking about a poor woman she must lieand hire her washing done And heresMinnie has told everybody that hascome into the house that I have givenher doll away and I told her not to doit again and now I will have to whipherNo no Promise me Mrs Crandallthat you will not punish that merebaby It was all my fault2so it was my doll and it was all Ihad an now I aint got nothin oh ohch and she sobbed

times whichshowed he was en rapport with theaffairs of the war Finally Gen Dukestared at the visitor and then recognizing him all of a sudden said Whyits Tom Major But what are vou doing in clerical dress He could notrealize the fact that the dashing cavalryman had beccme a servant of theLord and his astonishment at the recognition was ludicrous Father Major isnow one of the most popular clergymanin the State and wherever he goes he isas warmly welcomed by the Protestantsas by those of his own faith He is agenial lovable man and there wassomething touching and most loyal inhis prayer

FILLER lEdit0rS aPENSION EXAMINATIONWirtc Variation in Awards TJiafAVere Obtained ly Out Man ina Single DayOriginal and increase applications foipensions all come to be considered ata certain stage before allowance or rejection by local boards of medical examiners These examiners ought to becompetent physicians qualified by skilland experience to judge between pretense and fact when upon their decision depends the pajing or withholding of money taken from the people tomeet the increasing pension ajpropriationsBut these boards are not always skillful and competent to judge Sometimesthey are prevented by fear of organized resentment from finding that anapplicant has no disability sufficient tcgive him a pensionable rating It isknowledge of all the facts that leads thepension commissioner no doubt to advocate the abolition of local examiningboards and to recommend that all examinatidns shall be made by medicalofficers under the control and in the exclusive employment of the governmentTake a recent instance of the work oflocal boards Complaint was made thata man on the pension rolls was therewitlfout pensionable cause He was receiving 1G a month He was taken before a boaid of examiners and was soonpronounced to be pensionable at therate of eight dollars a month On thesame day in the same city a secondboard decided that he showed no pensionable disability whatever A thirdboard on the same day found the pensioner disabled to an extent that calledfor a pension of 22 A fourth boardvisited on the same day reported theman to be entitled to a pension at 17a monthHere were five examinations to whichthis pensioner had been subjected andaveraging the awards of the five itseems that he should have about 12a month But the public may properlybe distrustful of the sort of examination for which this shows that they arepaying How could it bo possible forone board of three physicians to finda man so sound as to be unfit to receivea pension and another board of threeother physicians an hour later findthe same subject entitled by reason ofhis disability to receive out of the22 monthly Which was rightOr -was either right We cannot tellbut we know who will payDo not these facts suggest the probability that medical examinations aresuperficial and unconvincing and thatthey need reformation at the earliestpossible moment X Y Timesijt oTTmTynvrn tmxv

will come down Wilson called backto us As the passage was not morethan three and a half or four feet inheight it was rather difficult to followhis adviceDo you suppose Jackson did all thiswork himself I heard Mr Perry askUndoubtedly Sonntag repliedYou sec he used to come to Nelsonville quite frequently For the pastsix weeks he had not been seen abouthere But then that is no sign thathe was not here Probably duringthose six weeks he was at work Herewe are he said as he crawled out intothe roomMr Perry followed quickly and Iheard him exclaim in tones of horrorWhat in heavens name is thathis eye caught mine there was somuch pity and sympathy in it that Icould not help feeling some wonderTo think of it all happening on mygrandfathers place whose characterwas as far removed from anythingerimfhal as heaven is high aboveearth I finally managed to murmurunwilling to state the real cause of mycraotionIs he quite dead Mr Perry askedagain turning to Wilson For answer the detective pulled back his coatand vest and pointed to the shirt bosom which was dyed with the lifestreamYou see he answered quietlyquite dead Shot through the heart41id Jackson do it the presidentasked turning- to me I nodded myhead-Why should he What was MrMorlevFortimatelj Skinner who had arisenafter his whispered conversation withWilson and gone poking about in thecorners and behind the empty barrelsand boxes here uttered a shout whichcaused us all to glance in his directionHe was tugging at some object insideof a barrel and soon brought out alarge valise which from its apparentweight and plethoric appearance wasstuffed fullAh that looks promising ejaculated Mr Perry starting eagerly forwardThe valise was deposited on the floorand the president went down on hisknees in great excitement to fumblewith the catchLet me get at it said WilsonWhile the two were eifdeavoring toopen the bag Skinner came to where Iwas standing and gazing down on thedead man said in soft tones Thiswill go hard with the young ladyin it that I voluntarily turned and extended my handI hope youll forgive me I saidYou bet he replied grasping myhand You did pretty near choke thedaylight out of me though What agrip youve got he added with abright smile But then thats allright Im thanlcful you didnt shootI was going to tell you who I was asthere was nc use for further concealment from you but you didnt give meany chanceWhy was the whole affair Icept frommc so carefully I askedThe question for some reason embarrassed Mr SkinnerI guess AYilson thought you were alittle hot headed and might give thething away by too much zeal he finally replied hesitatinglyI regarded him closely for somehow I felt sure his answer was not atrue one but he was gazing at the bodyat his feet in seeming sorrowThen he shook his head and againmurmured I tell you this will cutthe young woman up terriblyIt will indeed And who is to tellher I exclaimed in anguishThat is your duty Mr Conway Shewouldnt take it the same from anyoneelse as she would from you Thenhe continued earnestly Yes yourethe one to tell her and the only onewho can give her any comfort if thereis any to be had Poor lady I hopeyou wont think me too forward in saying that she thought a good deal ofyou she was so anxious to get youcleared and kept imploring me all thetime to hurry up and find the real robbersBless my dear loves kind and trueheart

horror were on his face ashe glanced from one to the other of usSylvester Morley he finallygasped Impossible Then he leanedover the body again It looks verymuch like him very much like himhe whispered glancing down at Wilson who gravely nodded his headWhat You mean it is Morley thisbody Mqrleys Great God in HeavenWe stood silently around the body forsome time none of us willing to uttera word But the realization of whatthe fathers death and in such a violent way would mean to Florence hadbeen grov Ing stronger and stronger inmy mind and I finally broke down under it covered my face with my handsand groaned aloudSoon I felt a tench on my arm Glancing up I saw Mr Perry standing beside mcIt is a most terrible affair Nelsonbut never mind my boy he said softh in an attempt at comfort His nextwords told mc however that he didnot know the real cause for my griefI know how you must feel to have ahorrible event like this happen on yourplace But you are cleared at any rateIt will soon be known that you are innocent of the crime the suspicion ofwhich you have borne so long and sopatientlyI made an effort at control and whenI again addressed Mr Perry noticedWilson and Skinner holding a whispered conversation The youngermans face was toward me and asTheintocash anyhow they arc goneSo it did pay you for responding soquickly to my telegram I remarkedYour telegram he repeated insurprise I received noneThen I explained to him and when Ihad finished he said Why you seethe reason I did not receive it was thatI was already at Twineburgh Wilson telegraphed me this morning andI came up on the noon trainMr Perry came into the office halfan hour after you left replied MrWilson I sent the dispatch after Ileft hereHow did you know Jackson wouldcome to the cellar to night I askedcuriouslyMr Wilson glanced around before answering Then he sunk his voice downlow as though afraid he might beheard by the othersHave you forgotten the voices inyour bedroom and up in the atticThe conversation was the most fortunate chance that ever befell me in mywhole professional careerOh then you think Jackson wasone of the parties holding the conversation I askedAssuredly Has not the resultproved that he repliedBut then who who could havebeen the otherV I asked with greatfear and dreadWilson drooped his head and seemedto be considering his replyImpossible to answer that question he finally said reluctantlyAnd I dont know as there is anycause for cither you or me ever to refer to that conversation You see adetective feels sensitive at not beingable to discover everything concerningan important case And although wehave been wonderfully successful whoHorace Jacksons assistant or masterfor he undoubtedly had one was willprobably remain forever a mysteryAt least I shall not attempt anythingmore in the case My dutv is completedMy heart gave a bound Mr Morley sconnection with the robbery was notsuspected even by one of the mostastute detectives in America Mypromise then might be fulfilled andFlorence at least spared the knowledge that her father was a great criminalI noticed Wilsons sharp eyes wereon my face and I strove to cloak mysatisfaction Then the detective heldout his hand and gave mine a heartySrripThe bodies had better be removedupstairs Wilson then said resuminghis matter-of-fact mannerIn due time the two bodies vcrei ffiniiiappsffping side by side on the floor of mybedroomThe man whose life before the worldhad been blameless and honorable asynonym for business virtue and integrity but who was in reality thegreatest rogue imaginable who fromhis capacity for engineering large endeavors I knew must have been theprime factor in the robbery lay therebeside his tool who had become as accomplished a rogue as his masterHypocrisy and pretense have7 alwaysinspired the greatest repugnance inme But as I gazed down on the faceof him whose daughter was my promised wife and remembered the brightspot in all the blackness of his realcharacter the love and affection for hisoffspring my heart was heavy withsorrow for himThat love so deep so fond that hegave up his life rather than yield to athought which might cause her unhappiness surely such a love was atonement enough for the evil he hadThere was nothing particularly wroughtstriking in his words but the tone of j Mr Perry was standing beside me ashis voice had so much genuine feeling j these thoughts flew through my mindI cannot understand how or wirySylvester Morley should become mixedup in this affair and so meet his deaththe president said in grave tonesSurely but then that is too wild athought to utter But there is something I cannot understand about itOh Mr Perry I exclaimed it ismy fault I should have explained before but the affair has sent my witswool gathering I handed him thebond I had p ed up giving a brief account of the finding Then I went onAfter I found the bond I immediatelyinformed Mr Morley as he was an interested party being one of the trustees of the bank and I wished someolder heads advice I explained everything to him in answer to the numerous questions he asked meMr Perry was listening intently aswere also Wilson and Skinner and theperspiration broke from my foreheadas I went on with the gigantic lieIt seems he could not resist attempting an investigation himself and andso came here I was in the cellar whenhe came down but it was as dark aspitch and I thought it was one of therobbers and that I was trapped I didnot discover the truth until too lateAh that explains it all Mr Perrysaid when I had finished That wasMorley truly He was always thatkind of a man and would never depend upon another to accomplishthings when he could do it himselfI could not help glancing furtivelyat the two detectives and receivedfrom each a nod of approvalIn

of experience I amconvinced there is no other grain cropgrown by the average farmer that -willproduce so much good nutritious foodfrom a given amount of seed and landas corn The yield per acre can begreatly increased and more acres beleft in clover and grass To do its bestcorn requires a rich soil either naturally or artificially underdrained Theideal preparation is to plow under aclover sod and treat thin spots to acoat of stable or barnyard manure soas to secure an even growth all overthe field Xext to a clover sod I prefera timothy sod next Avheat stubble andiast of all corn stubble Ground wellplowed is half harrowed Use a goodplow supplied with wheel and jointerThe wheel makes the plow run steadierand regulates the depth The jointerthrows all the rubbish and sod into thebottom of the furrow where it will notbother in cultivation and more readilydecay By not mqking furrows toowide and turning them at an angle of30 or 40 degrees we shall have an idealplace for the seed Plow as soon as thesoil is dry enough to crumble nicelyJrom the mold boardBefore planting the ground must beworked down into- a fine mellow seedbed The spring tooth harrow is aBplendid implement to cut the groundup with and if it happens to be cloddyI prefer a plank drag to a roller Justbefore planting use a fine tooth smoothing harrow which will leave the surfacefine and level In planting I use thewire check rower and plant in hillsthree and one half feet each waj It iseasier to cultivate the ground can bekept more level it is much easier to harvest and I get just as large yields whenit is planted in hills as in drills AsFoon as corn is planted begin cultivating by using a light fine toothed harrow and again in three or four days usethe same implement and go crosswiseof the previous harrowing As soon aswe can see the corn along the row replant missing hills and start the twonorse cultivator I use a cultivatorwith three small shovels on a side thefirst plowing I plow very close to thecorn and after this plowing if theground is inclined to be dry use theroller and follow this again with thecultivator After this cultivate eachweek each time crosswise of the preceding time shallower and fartherfrom the corn Continue this cultivating until grain and hay harvest beginsAfter this I do nothing more to it except go through with a hoe in July andAugust and remote stray weeds NrC Thomas to

Fortify the system and it will do its own fighting and promptly eject any intrudingdisease The success of Dr Ayers Sarsaparilla in curing indigestion and dyspepsia is due to just this quality which
