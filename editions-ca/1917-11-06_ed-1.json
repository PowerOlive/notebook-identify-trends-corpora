THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT

The members of the Mission Cir
cle of the Christian church will hold
a meeting in the church parlors this
(Tuesday) afternoon at three o'clock.
Mrs. Harry Collins will be the hostess
on this occasion.
Rev. J. J. Dickey, the new pastor
of the East Second Street Methodist
church, and his sister, Mrs. C. M.
Humphrey, gave a largely-attended
reception to the members of the con
gregation and their friends at the
parsonage in Maysville, Friday even

The Christian Endeavor Society
of the Presbyterian church had an,
interesting meeting Sunday -evening.
Misses Fannie Heller and Virginia
Dundon, who attended the District
Convention at Cynthianfc, gave full
reports of the meetings there.
This being the time for the elec

sons were elected:
President Eleanur Lytle.
First Vice-President Mrs. Wilcox.
Second Vice-President Lucile

Secretary John Dundon.
Treasurer Thomas- McClintock.
The Men's Bible Class of the
Presbyterian church, of Paris, most
heartily endorses the efforts of the
Y. M. C. A. to raise $35,000,000
to provide recreation and moral
training for the soldiers, not only on
the firing line in Europe, but also
in the training camps at home. No
feature of the Y. M. C. A. work so
quickly reaches so many men, nor
fills so great a void in the lives of the
men reached as this work among the
soldiers. No phase of the work is so
important. It contributes to the
greatest asset of successful soldiers,
"a sound mind in a sound body,"
and as such merits the support and
encouragement of all who are anxious
or ale willing to do their bit to help
