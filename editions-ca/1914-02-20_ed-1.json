On Friday night, Feb. 27, the Paul
J. Rainey Pictures, which are said to
be the most wonderful moving pic
tures ever made, and which are ac
knowledged by many to be greater
and more interesting than Lyman J.
Howe's pictures, will be shown at the
Grand Opera House, in this city, for
one night only. These pictures were
taken right in the jungles of Africa by
Paul Rainey, chief photographer, and
here you will see the most savage "and
ferocious of beasts, the lion, the tiger,
the leopard, the hyena, and all other
kinds of animals at the water hole.
This view is said to be the most haz
ardous risk ever attempted by the
moving picture man in order to take
this particular scene. The fact that
one of the Paul J. Rainey party will
lecture with these pictures, explaining
each scene and every detail, will
make it worth wliile for every man,
woman and child who can attend this
performance to view these pictures
Friday night. Mr. fcainey's party car
ry their own machine and curtain, as
rwell -as the lecturer, who traveled
with the Rainey party in Africa wliile
taking these pictures. Come early
and get a good seat, as these pctures
are the most wonderful in the world.
One performance, at 8:15.

How to Detect the
Alum Baking Powder
"Z "Which are the alum baking powders ;
how can I avoid them unless they are named?'
asks a housekeeper.
Here is one way: take the can of a low
priced powder in your hand and read the
ingredient clause upon the back label The
law requires that if the powder contains alum
that fact must be there stated. If you find
one of the ingredients named alum, or sul
phate of aluminum, you have found an alum
baking pander.
There is another and a better way. You
don't have to know the names of the alum
powders. Use Royal Baking Powder only;
that assures you a cream of tartar powder,
and the purest and most healthful baking
powder beyond question.
