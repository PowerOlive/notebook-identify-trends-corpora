"3LAC POPE" DEAD.
LONDON, Aug. 21 A dispatch to
the Exchange Telegraph Company
trom Rome says that Father' Francis
Xavier Wernz died in Rome Thurs
day morning almost simultaneously
with Pope Pius.
The fatal illness of Father Francis
Xavier Wernz, known as the Black
Pope, was diabetes, superintended by
his anxiety over the war He had
constantly prayed tnat victory should
rest on the Austro-German armies,
but he was equally anxious as to the
fate of the Jesuits in France, Ger
many and Austria.
Father Wernz was general of the
Society of Jesus, and it is consider
ed doubtful .whether a conclave for
the election of his successor can be
held during the war, as the provinci
als tf the different countries must
come to Rome for that purpose.
This would be exceedingly difficult,
as they do not enjoy the same priv
ileges as the Cardinals.

CHANCE FOR A ROMANCE
A few days ago, in the course ot
preparation for the noonday meal, the
editor of the News was sent to pur
chase a pound of butter. Upon re
moving the wrapper, the following
message was discovered written on
the underside, in pencil, in a neat
feminine" hand:
"Anita Phillips, aged 18 years;
weight 125 lbs.; height, 5 ft. 4 in.;
dark hair; dark eyes; light complex
ion, always ready for a good time,
answer this and receive a good let
ter. Address 2201 Ohestnut St., Tren
ton, Mo."
The editor, having passed the ro
mantic stage of life, promptly turned
the missive over to the city editor,
who, though still young and very im
pressionable, remained ' bomb-proof
and passes it over to the tender con
sideration of some "Johnnie" who
wants to put himself on record with
this tender young Missouri bud, who
is doubtless anxiously awaiting a re
ply. The original is on file in this office.

STOCK if H NOTE
A live stock favm. at Millersburg
is reported to have bought and ship-
' ped 6,000 lambs during the present
year. The prices paid for the lambs
ranged from six to eight cents a
pound, which was not bad for the
farmers who had lambs to sell. It
may be -remembered incidently that
Kentucky could produce easily twice
the number of sheep that now are
being raised and detibtless would do
so but for the fact that the State is
overrun with o;. There is no
money in raising dogs of the ordinary
sort. The owners of such dogs would
be better off without them, and the
whole State would be better off if
there were more sheep and and fewer
dogs. Frankfort State Jonural.
