PorterTo the Democratic Voters : I hereby announce myself as a candidate forthe Democratic nomination for theoffice of Police Judge of Paris, subject tc the actionj the Democraticprimary to be held on August 2, 1913.t There are one hundred reasons 1could give as an excuse for askingyour support, but the principal andall absorbing one is that I want therevenue which occupancy of the officej brings, and 1 do not think it worthwnue to mention c ne otner ninetynine. After all that is the principalreason which a large roajoritv of officeseekers have for seekinc office, and Iam no exception to the rule.I have been told by numerous enthusiastic, but perhaps oveizealousfriends, that they considered me' competent to assume the responsibilities of the office. IE I am elected; through their confidence in me I promise to enforce the laws to the vetybest of my abilities. Angels cculddo no more. Being employed sixdays in the week, it will be impossible for me to see in person each voter,hence this card. Your support willbe appreciated and if elected J hope tomerit it.Very Resoectfully,R.

It was practically assuredthat the Blue Grass League will existduring the summer, but from the present outlook there is a grave possibilitythat there will be no more than ifourclubs.President Russell stated that therehad been numerous obstacles to overcome thjs season,such as the objectionof Garry Herrman to placing clubs inCovington andjNewport, and reportsfrom several towns that fans had lostinterest in the game, but expressedthe opinion at the meeting that theleague members would open the seasonwith good teams.It was decided to push the suitaginst the National Commission toobtain a temporary miunction, and allthe members present expressed a belief that they would certainly win thefight if the matter was brought to thecourts.President Russell stated that he hadreturned to Secretary Farrell the entrance fee of the league, wnich thelatter had enclosed him in his communication recently. The letter was asfollows:Maysville, Ky., March 15, 1913.Mr. J. H. Farrell,Secretary, Auburn, N. Y.Dear Sir Your communication enclosing chenk representing our 1913protection fee in fheNational Association received and I return the checkherewith. You have evidently beenmisinformed as to the nature of ourcontention, which is not a disagreement with any of the base ball laws,but a difference in opinion with Mr.August Herrman, the'Chairman of theNational Commission, over the interpretation of the rive-mile limit clausein the National agreement. We mustprotest against snap judgment on yourpart or that of the National Board.We still claim our membership in theNational Association, and our effortsare really directed toward preventingharm to same, rather than hurt it.Verv truly,THOMAS M. RUSSELL,President Blue Grass League.All the members expressed themselves as being highly in sjmpathywith the President's action, and thegeneral feeling of the meeting wasthat Farrell had acted hastily. and thatit was the intention of Herrman andFarrell to force them out of the National Association.President Russell announced the selection of advisory committtee for theleaue ds follows: John Leonard, MavsSville; William Shire, Paris; M.C. Kellogg, Richmond; J. H. Stewart, Frankfort, and J. G. Juett, Lexington.The Spalding National League Ballwas adopted as the official base ballfor the league, to be used in all gamen.Those who attended the meetingwere: Hogan Yancey and ThomasSheets, Lexington; A. B. Coleman andJ. H. Stewart, Frankfort; Thomas M.Russell, James Summers and J. R.Leonard.'Maysville, and R. C. Stockton, Richmond.Paris was not represented at themeeting, neither President Bacon norSecretary William Shire being able toattend on account of pressing business.Law Abiding County.The Robertson Circuit Court closeda brief term at Mt. Olivet Wednesday, having convened Monday. Thegrand jury was impaneled Mondayand adojurned Tuesday. The petitjury was convened Tuesday and wasadjourned. There was practicallynothing, for the grand jury to do.r"WE KNOW HOW""4tS 'M,wwvVEven WE Admitthat there are more importantthings in the world than havingthe right clothes.

BThe "Unsinkable Ship.",The big tiansatlantic steamerOlympic, sistership of the ill fatedTitanic, has been undergoing a process of reconstructionand improvement. It is now announced that thefaults that were so hideously in evidence at the -time of the great oceantragedy of a year ago have been remedied, that a sufficient number of lifeboats to carry the entire ship's company have been installed and that numerous other changes jin constructionand equipment have been made, looking to greater safety.All this is reassuring. But "the reassurance is not strengthened in anyway by the company's assertion thatthe Olympic ftas been fmade Fn "unsinkabe ship." The Titanic 'was alsocalled an "unsinkable ship" 'and wasbelieved to be such until the greatestof ocean tragedies proved how idlewns the boast. The world is quitewilling to believe that such a fate aslbefell the Titanic can not visit thereconstructed ; Olympic. But theperils of the sea are many, and it isnot impossible that they include somethat today are no more conceivablethan the peril which met and overwhelmed, thegiantess of the Atlanticseemed to bebefore the event.Puny man has no Tmore justificationnow for the boast that ho has succeeded in absolutely controlling andtaming the elements than he had ayear ago. An Junsinkable ship is aphase that should not be given tooready employment. Under all the circumstances its use is more likely toarouse than to disarm suspicion.Fares Worse at Second TrialAfter securing a new trial upon appeal from the Pendleton Circuit Court,in which he had been convicted of voluntary manslaghter, L.

J 4 -What State Paperst Are Saying AnentThe Louisville Post prints the following by Torn Cromwell, in the Cincinnati Enquirer:"Governor James Bennett McTJreary returned .to Frankfort fromWashington laatSunday. He told theofficial family at the State capitalwhat a fine time he had had at the national capital; what enjoyment he exoerienced in meeting some ef his oldcolleagues kand frienas of the dayswhen he wasa Senator; what greatpleasure be had in witnes.ing the inauguration uf another DemocraticPresident, and how gratified he was athaving the. honor of -inviting President Wilson to attend the Perry celebration atLouisville, but he ;has volunteered no information as to whetherhe will or will not be a candidate forthe Democratic nominatinn'las UnitedStates Senator."Last week scores of Democratswho attended .the presidential inaugoration returned to Kentucky feelingcertain that GovernorJVlcCreary wouldannounce ;his decision fcvery shortlyafter his arrival at Frankfort. Thisexnectation was based on what theysaw and heard in Washington, withreference to the Governor's talks withCongressman Owsley "Stanley, National.Committeeman John C. C.MayoChairman R. H. Vansant, of the StateCentral and Executive Committee;Messrs. Johnson JN. Camden and AllieW. Young, both managers of pastcampaigns in Kentucky, and 'otherswhowill have a hand in the shaping ofparty affairs for the forthcomine campaign. The majority of these Democrat were entertaining the notionthat the Governor's answer would bein the affirmative, and they thoughtthey had good grounds in their belier."This week, however, lindE theseDemocrats in a somewhat vexatiousstate of perplexity over the Governor'sapparent. indecision. They are freelyadmitting a misconception of the situation and at the same time they aredeclaring their belief that the Governor does not know where he is at,so to speak."It is related this week that certain interests opposed to the candidacyof former Governor J. C. W. Beckhamand preferring Governor McCreary toCongressman Stanley made overturesto friends of the Representative ofthe Second district, who is to succeedSenator James on the House Ways andMeans Committee, to urge him out ofthe race, but they failed in ,the effortGov. McCreary thereupon paid Congressman Stanlev a personal visit andtalked to him lor two hours. At fctheend of the interview, it is fesaid, Stanley's, determination to stay in therace had increased, and he is reportedto have told the Governor most jositively that he means to run it out regardless of who may enter."Stanley, accoraing to politicianswho lingered in Washington and returned lo Kentucky this week, isboasting strength enough to win overHeckham, evn should it become a twoman race.i He figures that McCreary,if it should be a three maniace, woulddraw more from Beckham than hewould draw from Stanley. In short,Stanley cannot see anything otherthan victory, they say, however muchmany ot them disagree with him andit would seem next to impossible toget a man in such a frame of mind,out of anybody's way."Meanwhile there appears to be noalternative in the matter of the Governor's decision than to await the Governor's further pleasure."The Stanford Interior Journal says :"J. K. Baugham, the Zwell known'West End farmer, has just returnedfrom a trip to Barren and Metcalfecounties, where he went to purchase aPercheron horse. He says that' hetalked to a number of leading Democrats of those two counties and theytold him that the sentiment among theDemocratic voters there js overwhelmingly in favor of ex-Governor Beckham for U.

ButleV& Co.WRITTEN BY ONE WHO KNOWSMale and Female Humorists at Work,and Also In Their Less HarmfulMoments of Leisure.4 Humorists are people who cut, fitand finish jokes, jests and light verseand do plain and fancy writing whichis not serious.Male humorists do this by lightinga pipe or a cigar, sticking a sheet ofpaper into a typewriter and wishingthey had adopted a mercantile career.Female humorists accomplish thefeat by twisting their back hair intoa knot, nibbling chocolate creams orchewing some gum, and manipulatingthe typewriter in the customary manner. As a general thing, nowadays,humorists are very human. Thereare more of them than there used tobe. The women dress like their sisters, and the men are perfectly conventional in their attire.Occasionally you come across anold-school humorist, or a modern onewhq clings to the old-school traditions. He imagines that he has towear a most solemn face, never smiles,and looks pained when you "laugh atwhat he says. This variety goes greaton the rural lyceum circuit.Humorists are always introduced assuch. Plumbers, housebreakers, hankers, dry goods men and wholesale grocers are never classified when introduced, but humorists are always specified. Immediately the persons towhom they are introduced wait expectantly for them to say something wildly witty. Immediately, also, they aredisappointed, unless they are of theclass who shriek with joy when thehumorist politely says: "It is a niceday."Humorists always have to explainwhy they are humorists instead of following some more laborious occupation. Also they are expected to deliver afterdinner speeches for nothing,because being funny is second natureto them, and they are not supposed tohave any remunerative way of spending their odd moments.The difference between a humoristand a comedian is that a comedianuses the humorist's humor. If thehumorist used the comedian's humorhe would starve to death. Another difference is that the comedian makesfrom three hundred to five hundreddollars a week. Life.Ways of the Working Class.The psychology of the workingclass is different from that of theother classes. The prevailing tone isapathy. There is no discontent orenvy of the well-to-do. but neither isthere that restless eagerness to bettertheir position, and confidence in theirultimate prosperity, which the American spirit is supposed to instil intoa 'man. Men in the trades seem tohave this spirit, but.it is noticeablyabsent from the factory class. Eventhe immigrants seem quickly to losethat flush of hope and ambition, withwhich they arrive in this country. Thefactory routine seems to get into theirvery souls, so that their whole lifesettles down to a monotonouos drudgery without a look forward or backward. They are chiefly concerned inholding their jobs, and escaping thehorrors of unemployment in makingboth ends meet. Beyond this there islittle horizon for day-dreaming andambition. Life to them is a constantfacing of naked realities, and an actual"economy," or management, of resources, not an effort to impressthemselves on their neighbors, and toconform to the ways of those aboutthem. This deep-seated divergence instandards and interests from the restof American life may or may not beimportant, for the factory class isthus far politically negligible; but itis interesting, .and well calculated tosuggest many unpleasant things toAmerican mtnds. Randolph S. Bourne,in the Atlantic.Good Nature and Humorous Tongue.In a village of about five thousandinhabitants in Tioga county, NewYork, a modest fortune has beenamassed by a man who at the age offorty-five left the navy without evena trade to fall back upon and no assets except a humorous turn to histongue.Having done some cobbling when ayoung man, he 'entered a shoe storefor a time and later set up a littleshop of his own for repairing shoes.That was ten years ago. His good nature and industry won him the tradeof the town; a newiy acquired habitof thrift promted him to 'buy on theinstallment plan the little shop andhouse in which he lived. 'Today a fine brick building is replacing the wooden one and the cobbler himself may give up his last ifhe wishes. But that he has no dislike for it is evidenced by his recipefor success, whicb is:"Just keep pegging away."Farmer Had Business Instinct.At the tail end of the summer afarmer near Springfield, Mass., foundhe had 50,000 ripening melons on hishands and it looked as though theywould be a dead loss for lack of timeto ship them. But he posted noticesthroughout the county, advertised inthe newspapers and sold 40,000 melons within a week. He had a line of27 automobiles standing in front ofhis house at one time on a single afternoon.
