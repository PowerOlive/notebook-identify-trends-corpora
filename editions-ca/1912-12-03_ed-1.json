DEATHS.
Aged Colored Man Dead.
William Steuban. aged 89 years, one
of the best known and most highly re
spected colored men in Bourbon county,
died at his home in this city Sunday
morning at 3 o'clock from infirmities
due to his advanced age. Steuban was
born in Lexington and in his youth he
lived in New Orleans, but the most of
his life was spent in this city, where
he conductecTa barber shop lor a num
ber of years, giving up the business
because he was too old to follow it suc
cessfully. For many years he was a familiar
figure on the race courses of Kentucky
and in other states, and when open
betting was practiced at the courses
his bets were taken readily. He was
a recognized authority on racers and
his judgment in many cases were back
ed by the best known sportsmen
throughout the countrv.
Though bom a slave he obtained his
freedom long before the emancipation
proclamation was issued. He was a
man of strong common sense and intel
ligence and was perhaps as well edu
cated as any other man of his race in
this section of the country. During
his early lite in the South he learned
the French language, which he could
speak fluently and although during
his late years his vision was some
what imoaired he kept posted on cur
rent events and was able to discuss
the most important happenings of the
day.
At one time he had considerable
property but owned at his death only
the home where he lived at the foot
of Mam street, which he has occupied
for almost half a century.
RENICK.
Mr. Wm. Howard Renick, pcion of
one of Bourbon county's pioneer fami
lies, and one of the most prominent

a few days of heart trouble.
Mr. Renick was born near Clinton-
ville, this county in 383b and was seventy-six
years of age. He was a son
of the late Mr. and Mrs. James Ren
ick, the former being a large land
owner in this county. His father was
a veteran of the war of 1812. He was
an extensive farmer and stock raiser.
After death of his father Mr. Ren
ick continued to reside in the old Ren
ick homestead. He met with much
success as a farmer an attained a na
tional reputation ss a stock raiser,
being a producer of high class short
horn cattle.
Mr. Renick was interested in the
Paris Milling Co., in East Paris. To
gether with his sons; B. M. Renic,
Scott Renick and Abram Renick, he
purchased the stock in the company
and the plant was placed under the
management.of B. M. Renick. It has
been converted into one of the most
prosperous milling concerns in Ken
tucky. Ihe excellent business ability of Mr.
Renick was recognized throughout the
state and he was interested in other
business ventures, among them being
the Agricultural Bank of Paris, of
which he was a director.
Prior to moving to town Mr. Renick
owned seven hundred acres cf blue
grass land. Tnis he sold and purchas
ed the palatial residence of the late J.
W. Ferguson on High street.
Mr. Renick is survived by his wid
ow, who was formeily Mis Mattie
Morris, of Scott county, and six chil
dren two daughters, Mrs. Duncan
Bell, of Paris, and Mrs. Curtis P.
Smith, of Dallas.Texas. and four sons,
Messrs. B. M. Renick, of Paris; Mor

Rain Relieves Drought.
The rain of Sunday night served to
relieve the drought that has prevailed
in this Fection for the past two months.
Owing to the fact that no rain ;has
fallen intthat length of time there
was a scarcity of water, many of the
streams of the county being almost
dry and ponds in various sect'ons
which turnish stock water being
without any water to speak of.
In a number of instances farmers
have been known to drive their cattle
for some distance to water them. The
etxremely dry weather has had the
effect of retarding the growers of
tobacco in preparing their crops foi
the market.
Not all of the tobacco in the county
has-been stripped and that which is
now ready for the market could not be
handled owing to the need of a rain to
bring it in case. Unless there is a
considerable drop in the temperature
and with a continuation of damp,
moist atmosphere, tobacco will be
ready for the market in the next tew
days.
Tobacco Market Opens Saturday
The opening of the tobacco ware
house of the Bourbon Tobacco Ware
house Co., 'in this city, which it was
announced would take place today has
been postponed until "Saturday ' when
the sales will begin. The great need
of a tobacco season has been the cause
ofpostponing the sales in a number of
cities, and such conditions existing
here has made it necessary to post
pone the opening.
The large tobacco warehouse in
Barns addition, which for the past
three or four months has been under
construction, has been completed,
practically all the work being finished
with the exceptionjof hanging a few
doors and clearing the premises ot all
tbe waste material.
Manager Kenney Nichols with a
large force of men will begin receiv
ing tobacco Wednesday in prepaiation
for the sales Saturday, and with the
proper season a good supply should be
on hand for the opening dav.
Several weeks ago Mr. Nichols re
ceived the assurance that there would
be a large 'number of buyers repre
senting the various tobacco firms
throughout the country on hand at the
opening of the sales. The firms of R.
J. Reynolds & Co., G. T. Patterson,
W. L. Petty & Co.. J. P. Taylor &
Co., and Silas Shelbourne & Co., will
be represented.

Resolutions.
RESOLUTIONS IN RESPECT TO THE MEM
ORY OF JOHN A LARUE ADOPTED BY
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
FIRST NATIONAL BANK, NOVEMBER
27TH, 1912.
John A. LaRui passed from
this life at his residence in Bourbon
County, Tuesday evening at fi ve o'clock.
He was a charter member, anj, from
its beginning, a Director in Ihia lcetitu
tion. Hie death creates the first va
cancy in this Board of Directois a va
cancy, so far as we are now able to fore
see, impossible to fill. His standing in
this community as a Christian, his un
erring judgment in the s iutijn of
bupiness problems, and bis faithful, un
deviating ad'prnc- to these principles
of life thai churacLeiiZd hu ideal man
hood, we treasured and relied upon as
part of the beginning and development
of this institution, to which he so
abundantly and willingly gave his
energy and time.
John A. LaRue was one of the up
builders of Bourbon County. No citizen
ever resided within her borders who
more willingly subscribed to and be
came a part of any undertaking having
in view the public good. He was an abso
lutely honest man. There was .no de
ceit, nor indirection, in the make up
of his character. He lived a blameless
life, and at its close, after this long and
intimate association, we recall no single
act but that was characteristic of the
noblest and best of manhood.
Therefore, Be it resolved by tha
Boaid of Directors of the First National
Bank of Paris, Kentucky
That by his death this institution is
deprived cf one whose advice, an.i ear
nest and sincere interest, during all it3
existeuce, have been invaluable;
this Board of directors of an honorable
and loyal friend and associate; our stock,
holders of one who placed their welfare
first and above all m every situation
that has confronted the Bank, and this
communicy one whose life in every re
lationship, measured by any standard,
was an example and an inspiration.
Resolved, further, That these resolu
tions be spread upon the minute book,
aad that a copy thereof, under tbe seal
of the Bank, be forwarded to the family
of our deceased friend and associate.

Is This a New Cure ior Rheuma
ti'sm.
Whether it is a mental influence of
the presence of the strip of silken rib
bon of the Emerald hue, encircling his
waist, Mike Murphy, the prompt col
lecting transfer man, is free from
rheumatic pains that have made his
life a misery for the past few months,
and folks in whom he has confided his
secret are wondering if the wily Irish
man has succeeded in unearthing a
, cure for the most dreaded disease.
According to Mr. Murphv the reme
dy was given him by an old friend, a
druggist of this city, whose abnormal
abdominal proportions prevented him
from using it for some time, owing to
the fact that a strip of ribbon of suffi
2ient lengm couia not oe secured in
this city and an order was placed with I
the factory : in the meantime he was
compelled to go to Martinsville.
Mr. Murphy avers that he suffered
with rheumatism to such an extent
that he was driven to deaperationjand j
when the secret of the remedy was '
given him he procured a piece of green I
ribbon which he placed -around his
waist. Since that day. he says, his
rheumatic pains have not made their
appearance. 'Why," he said, "I'd
just as soon think of leaving off my
trousers in the morning when Lget ud
as leaving off the ribbon."
A month ago another friend of Mr.
Murphy, a Louisville and Nashville
employe, who also sports a huge sec
tion of the silken material, had the
misfortune to burst his ribbon, and
while awaiting the arrival of the order
placed with the factory suffered the
most excrcuiating pains, and was also
compelled to make atriD to Martins
ville to secure temporary relief.
Having sold mv farm on the Mays
ville and Lexington pike five and one
half miles from Paris and two and
one-half miles from Millersburg and
