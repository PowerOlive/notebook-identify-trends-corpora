WO ACRES OP HEW WHEAT ARE
HARVESTED IN STATE -
More than 500 acres of Ashland
wheat, the new pedigreed strain, de
veloped by the Kentucky Agricultural
Experiment Station have just been
"harvested in Kentucky, according to
estimates made by soils and crop spec-
, ialists of the station. The acreage was i
divided among 32 farms in 13
counties and is expected to produce
from 8,000 to 10,000 bushels of grain
which will be available for seed this
fall.
The new strain of wheat which has
been the highest yielder at the Expe
riment Station farm for- the last six
years was, developed from one head
out of about 500 heads selected in
1313. In 1915 enough wheat was se
cured to plant three one-tenth-acre
plots and the strain gredually devel
oped from that time. The first distri
bution of seed from the station was
made in the fall of 1910 when 50
bushels were sent out. In the fall of
1920, 300 bushels were distributed,
which resulted in the crop for this
year.
The Ashland is similar to all
strains of Fultz in appearance. How
ever, the straw of Ashland is some
what stiffer than that of Fultz and
slightly lighter in color. It has prov
ed to be a consistent yielder in Cen
tral Kentucky and gives excellent re
sults wherever Fultz wheat has been,
popular.
During the years from 1915 to 1920
inclusive the average yield an acre bf
Ashland at the Experiment Station
has exceeded those of the three lead
ing varieties ol wheat in the State,
including Jersey Fultz, Fulcaster and
Gurrell's Prolific. Ashland yielded an
average of 33.6 bushels, Jersey
Fultz 31.1 bushels, Fulcaster 30.2,
and' Currell's Prolific 28.5 bushels.
