KENTUCKY GIANT IS A VERY
HAPPY MAN.
One of the proudest and happiest
men in Kentucky is W. T. Pruitt,
of Rockcastle county, aged sixty, who
also believes he is the heaviest man
in the State, as he weighs 512
pounds. It is not that he is so proud
of his unusual weight, because, al
though it gives him somewhat of an
advantage over his fellowmen in
some ways, it is perhaps something
of a. handicap otherwise; but he re
joices in two children, a son and a
daughter, and sixteen, grandchildren,
all of whom are residents of Rock
castle county. H. T. 'Prewitt, the
son, has several boys and one girl,
and the daughter, Mrs. Mary Wig
gins, has seven girls and one son.

Is that weed patch yours? Cut
them down. The city is just as re

should not overlook an opportunity
to set an example for others to fol
low. Some vegetable matter may be
pretty and pleasing to the eye, and
yet be a menace to the health of the
community.
The Board of Health will enforce
the ordinance regarding the cutting
of weeds in the city. They must be
cut within five days from date of this
notice.

PRESIDENT TO MAKE FIRST
SPEECH IN CINCINNATI
Harvesting a two hundred million
bushel wheat crop is a serious prob
lem which Kansas faces to be ac
complished within a few weeks.
Wheat cutting cannot be put off.
State Farm Labor Director Frizell,
of Larned, calls for 220,000 men to
harvest the crop, more than half this
immense army of workers . to be
brought in from other States. There
are still in the army, unavailable for
harvest hands, more than twice as
many men as a year ago, and Kan
sas is therefore shorthanded to an ex
tent that it has never been before.
With high wages in other occupa
tions it is not easy to induce men to
come into the wheat harvest. The
pay is good enough, but the job does
not attract men who have perma
nent employment. For harvest hands
Kansas must rely largely on former
men in the S. A. T. C.
"If the wheat isn't harvested as
soon as it is ripe, it is lost," Mr.
Frizell told Kansas City last week.
"We can put off our corn, our hay
and our alfalfa, but we can't put off
wheat. The crop this year is going
to be worth $475,000,000."
It is worth a supreme effort to save
the whole of it.

BUYS BLUEGRASS HORSE.
Dr. Lee T. Cooper, formerly of
Paris, and now residing in Dayton,
Ohio, where he is one of the propri
etors of the "Tanlac" remedy, re
cently purchased of Giles Bros., of
Scott county, a good bay gelding by
Dandy Jim, out of a daughter of
Star McDonald. The horse was ed
ucated by Kenney McAllister, of
Georgetown, who made the sale.
CHURCHES TO OBSERVE "THRIFT
SUNDAY, JUNE 22.
Thrift Sunday is to be observed
throughout the country on June 22.
On this date every minister in Ken
tucky will be asked to deliver their
Sunday sermon on "Thrift" and to
read the message of Secretary of the
Treasury Carter Glass to their people
on War Savings and Thrift.
The project has been launched by
the Savings Division, War Loan Or
ganization of the Treasury Depart
ment, which has started a nation
wide movement to conserve the war
taught habits of thrift, which has
met with the hearty approval from
many interests and organizations.
Every man, woman and child in
the United States will be asked to
consider and discuss on Thrift Sun
day the present necessity for econ
omy and its permanent value to per
sonal community and national pros
perity. "Thrift and savings are the high
ways to freedom," says State Director
James B. Brown. "That safe and
profitable investment may be within
reach of everyone the Treasury De
partment is continuing the sale of
Thrift and War Savings Stamps. The
latter costing a little over four per
cent, compounded quarterly is one, of
the very, best rates for savings," de
clares Mr. Brown,
"War Savings Stamps are made
easy to acquire. Thrift Stamps cost
but a quarter each and sixteen of
these plus a few cents additional may
be exchanged for an interest bearing
War Savings Stamp."
The slogan of the Savings Divis
ion is "Save First, Spend After
wards." "We hope to have every
minister in Kentucky preach on
thrift on June 22, on the meaning
and value of intelligent thrift to his
congregation and suggest plans for
community and individual thrift in
addition to encouraging church or
ganizations to enroll as government
savings societies," said the State Director.
MAYSVILLE DOCKS ARE REMOV
ED TO CONCORD.
The C. & 0. coal docks, which cost
the company about $50,000 several
years ago, situated just at the east
ern outskirts of Maysville, have been
transferred to Concord, fifteen miles
above.
Several months ago the docks were
burned, and the company decided to
rebuild at a more convenient place.
The change causes a loss of more
than $2,000 per month in salaries to
Maysville.
CUTWORMS DESTROY 24 ACRES
OF GRAIN IN 2 HOURS.
Twenty acres of rye and four acres
of corn on the Bernig Phillips farm
just across the Ohio State line, near
Richmond, Ind., were destroyed by
army worms in less than two hours.
Persons from all over Ohio and
Eastern Indiana were coming to the
place to see the destruction.
Trenches were dug around the fields
immediately and when the worms
started to leave the fields they en
countered the trenches and seemed
content to lie in the bottom of these.
The worms were about an inch
long and of a gray-green hue. They
resemble the caterpillar in some re
spects. o
The river is again open for bargain
sails.

President Wilson will deliver his

support of the League of Nations.
It was learned definitely that Cin

press dispatches. From Cincinnati
the President will go to Indianapolis,
where he will speak on the day fol

The itinerary, of course, is subject
