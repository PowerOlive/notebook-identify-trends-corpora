The many friends of Miss Jennie
Marie Pepper will doubtless learn
with surprize that she will leave
about August 1 for New York, where
she will prepare to go on the stage.
Miss Pepper, until within the, last
year was for several years one of our
home girls. She now resides at
Huntington, W. Va. She is a gradu
ate of the M. F. C. and also of the de
partment of expression. Later she
spent a year in the Chester School of
Expression, at Cincinnati, and became
quite an accomplished reader. Dur
ing the past years since residing at
Huntington she has given a number of
readings.
Mr. and Mrs. M. Peale Coll
ier moved Wednesday to. their new
home at Paris. It is with many re

ble people up. They have always re
sided in this community, and when
they grew up from childhood each of
them marrying practically neighbors.
Some months ago Mr. Collier pur

posing of his interest here in the Mil
lersburg Coal & Lumber Co., to his
partners, Messrs. W. A. Butler and A.
S. Miller. Since then he has operat

They both have always been interest

here are staunch and true. There is
is but one pleasure in their departure
and that is they have not gone far
from us, and we hope to have them
with us often. Our loss is the gain of
Paris, and we take he greatest of
pleasure in reccmmending them to

STROKE OF PARALYSIS.
Major Otis S. Tenney, of Lexington,
aged 93, perhaps the oldest living ex
Confederate in Kentucky, suffered a
stroke of paralysis in his left side
early Wednesday morning and was
later taken to the Good Samaritan
Hospital, where his condition was re

On account of hU advanced age
much anxiety is felt for the veteran
attorney, who is one of the most
widely-known men in Central Kentucky.
LAST ARGUMENT GONE.
"The last argument if it may be
called an argument of the opponents
of Gov. Beckham, that he would not
be as strong as some other candidate
in the final election, 'disappeared
when both the Republicans and Pro
gressives signified their intention of
making nominations. This insures
Mr. Beckham's election in November
by fully one hundred thousand major
ity. But even if this were not true,
Republicans and Independent voters
by the hundreds are daily announcing
their desire to vote for him, which
makes him the most available man to
lead us to victory, in any event."

WINCHESTER CHURCH HOLDS
OPEN AIR SERVICES.
OPPOSE LIQUOR TAX BILL.
A decided innovation was put into
effect last Sunday at Winchester
when .the bvQnfnff services of the
Christian Endeavor Society of the
Christian Church were held in the
open air on 'the lawn in front of the
church. The subject for the evening
was "Chief Seats and How to Reach
Them." The choir and orchestra oc
cupied seats on the front landing. A
large audience was present and every
one seemed delighted with the inova
tion of this outdoor service. On the
velvety grass, with the refreshing
night air and beneath the starry can
opy of Heaven, the hearts were made
more receptive for the sermon, on
prayer so splendidly delivered by the
pastor. The selectons by the choir
and orchestra sounded sweeter in the
open air, and altogether it was a beau
tiful service attended by a large
crowd.
Representatives of distilling inter
ests in Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana and
other States are preparing to protest
against the bill introduced last Satur
day by Representative Rainey, of Illin
ois, which provides for an increase in
the tax on distilled spirits.
NOTICE TO STOCKMEN.
List your stock in M. J. Murphy's
