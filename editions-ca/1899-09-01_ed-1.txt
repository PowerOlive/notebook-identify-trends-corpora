of the islands totake the place of the present militaryregime and submits for adoptiona code of laws These laws itrecommends should be placed inoperation by executive decree arguing that a

Invasion FormerStruggles for LibertySpecial CorrespondenceFor the sixth time since their country has been invaded by the Caucasian race the Yaqui Indians of Mexicoara now battling for their landsand their homes and national independence No nation or tribe ofaborigines on the American continent has showed so sublime a loveDf lioerty greater bravery or as muchwisdom and to one familiar with thehistory of Indian revolts it is not surprising to hear that the Mexican government is prepared to dispatch 10000troops to the north to subdue the rebellious YaquisThe present war must terminateeither In annihilation or in virtual independence Military authorities familiar with the strength and fightingcapabilities of both sides aiv confidentthat the Mexicans will win but notwithout terrible sacrifices and thateven after their defeat the Indianswill keej up a guerrilla warfare foryears to come The struggle will probably claim many more victims thanthe late Spanish American war and willalso be more important from a stragfticpoint of view to say nothing of itshistoric interest as being the last determined stand of the American nativeigainst tlie immigrant from EuropeThe Yaqui Indians are the dominantace in numbers in the state of Sonoran extreme northwestern Mexico tothe north of their habitations beingthe territories of Arizona and NewMexico Much of their country is altogether unknown to the civilizedrThat they have learned to use thewhite mans weapons is proven by thefact that since the beginning of thepresent revolt or within two monthsover a hundred miners and as manysoldiers have been shot by the rebellious Indians Gen Miles has expressed the opinion that this war willnot be over for months and may driftinto yearsAt ordinary times the Yaquis are reserved and exclusive rather than hostile They sometimes desert their villages at the approach of strangersleaving behind them nothing that cangive aid or comfort to the invadersWhen attempts are made to penetratetheir mountain retreats they occasional resort to resistance but even insuch cases they rarely do more thanblock the paths by which strangersmust advance Great rocks and treesare thrown across the narrow trailsstopping all progress of curiosity seekers and mining prospectorsThe Yaquis are industrious and lawabiding but a Mexican regulation requiring all men to wear trousers hasalways been particularly obnoxious tothem When the visit a so called civilized village to sell their potterywoven mats and baskets they do notput on their trou crs unlil they areabout to enter the corporate limits andon the homeward journey they takeoffthe hated garments as soon as theyareclear of the town and carry them iiHlittle bundles on top of their headsThe only strangers with whom theyar on friendly terms are the Apachesof Arizona and scores of these murderous savages outlaws from UnitedStates territory have found a safe refuge in the Yaqui countryDr W J Magee of the bureau ofethnology at Washington 1 whohas made researches in Sonora and isfamiliar with the Yaquis descrithem as a pastoral people somewhatskilled in the arts in a rude way Theyare ruled by their own laws followtheir own customs and are deeplyrooted in their ancestral pagan faithThey have towns which are often aI rt JT iM ---- I I - I fc -rr w jr -ST - Sr--- ViVawftggzzfevirRD frJr HCv -YAQUI GRASS HOUSE SHOWING UTENSILScans and has never been surveyed by i lums A refugee having sought safetythe ETOvernment engineers There aretraditions of vast mineral wealth inthis unexplored region and one beliefcurrent in Mexico is that the Yaquiholds the ruins of an ancientand splendid capital This city according to tradition occupies a mountain height not to be approached saveby trails which the Yaquis jealouslyguard against intrusionAs early as15J0 Roman Catholic missionaries entered the valley of theYaqui 1000 miles northwest from theCity of Mexico which had been captured by Cortez in 1521 The missionsprotected by the army prospered andin the course of time the Yaquitory was added to the Spanish domainJ farmers and mirfers and do their workin America In 1735 however the Indians revolted against Spain The invaders were defeated in battle butmade up for their failure in arms byartful duplicity The Yaquis revoltedYAQUIVUir I rt liMWV jLSMAIDEN WITH PAINTEDFACEagain in 1825 and again in 1832 againstMexico when armed with bows battleaxes and spears and led by their celebrated chieftain llanderas they putup a noble fight although finally overcome They made another revolutionary attempt in 1841 and defended theirmountain fastnesses with rare valorand for years held the Mexican troopsat bay Order was finally restored bya compromise The present conflictWill be still more sanguinary becauseto day the Indians are well armed Thebows and battle axes have been supplanted by Winchester repeating riflesand field gunsGen Nelson A Miles who is an authorityto Indianthority on everything pertainingdian and border warfare states thatwhen a few years ago a company begansouth from Bensonto build a railroadAriz to Nogales and Hermosillo thecapital of the state of Sonora andstill further south to Guaymas on theGulf of Mexico the Yaquis flocked tothe region along the line of the roadand offered their labor which of coursewas well paid for With the moneythus obtained they purchased rifles ofthe latest patterns and vast stores ofammunition Many of them continuedto work along the road and thus keptup the supply of funds for the purchaseof munitions of waramong them will never be surrenderedDr Magee found them faithfully attached to their native forms of worshipand br no means entirely submissiveto the priests Among themselves theyhave their ancestral ceremonial rightsof birth marriage and sepulture aswell as feasts and festivals They havea government of their own and craveindependence They are also a hospitable race The men are kind totheir women and children and thewomen wield great influence Abouttheir bravery there is no question Thewomen do some fine weaving in cottonand the fiber of the agavaThe men are employed as herderswell They know the value of a dollarquite as well as white traders and candrive a shrewd bargain Their housesare thatched huts with earthen floorsusually standing in the midst of smallbean patches There is no doubt thatthe Yaquis of to day are the remnantsof a brave and partially civilized people whom tbe Spaniards found in Mexieo They have never been conqueredand have never forgiven their Spanishenemies nor their descendants Theirmilitary organization is almost perfectconsisting as it does of companies regiments and divisionsA gentleman who recently returnedfrom a trip through Sonora told thewriter that he could not find a moreappropriate designation for the Yaquisthan that of the Irish of AmericaTheir love of country he says is as pureas that of the Irish peasant Theirbravery as unquestioned as that of thenoblest Irish patriot 13y force of numbers and power of military equipmentthey have been robbed of the tribularsovereignty over their native soil butin sentiment they are Yaquis and noamount of legislation will make themMexicans They have been persecutedby alien priests and slaughtered byhireling troops but still remain faithful to the religion of their fathers Apeople like that he thinks deserve encouragement rather than annihilationAs to the number of Yaquis there isa great diversity of opinion Some estimate the strength of the nation inSonora at 25000 others at 10000 Fifteen thousand is probably the Tightfigure In 1820 the Yaqcus numbered30000 but thousands were killed intheir wars with Mexico and thousandsof others were degraded into peonsOn the other hand the government ofMexico has sacrificed 35000 sold ieis andmany millions of dollars in fruitlessendeavors to subdue the Indians andrestore a permanent peace How manyof the 15000 remaining Yaquis are nowcapable of bearing arms cannot be toldwith any degree of accuracy but 0udmight be taken as a conservative estimate And 3000 mountain men lighting in a mountainous country for homeandlibrrty is a mighty host Thatevery soldier

engineer T wonder if they haveproperly allowed for the wind pressureI know a little something about thatmyself and I tell you its a pretty serious matter A wind that blows 40 milespn hour is a good stiff breeze and theweather bureau calls 60 miles a galeSo if you run a boat 40 miles an hourthrough a stationary atmosphere youare bound to stir up quite a breeze foryourself and if you should be run linginto a 30 knot wind you would have thestiffest kind of a gale blowing aboutyour decks In other words half thetime a man couldnt work unprotectedon the deck Unless he is behind awind shield he would be whisked awaylike a thistle down and even if he couldstick to the ship he couldnt breatheThe company had me studyingsteam at one time and I got to knowconsiderable about wind pressures Ihad a little machine that I attached tothe cylinder and it kept track of thesteam all the way through 1 used tosit and watch it by the hour and in thatway 1 could tell bv calculating justwhat the engine was doing and what results we were yetting Of course I hadto be protected from the wind and 1had a sort of a little box along side thecylinder in which I sat In winter oneside of me would be nearly burning andthe other nearly freezing On one tripI did actually burn my clothing on theengine side and freeze two toes on theoutside footWell to get back to the wind pressure Of course I got all kinds according to circumstances The wors1I ever gol was one day when we pusheda rasi engine tor an sue was wormright into a good stiif wind The windwas blowing about 30 miles 1 shouldthink and the indicator showed thaithe engine was running almost exactlyat the rate of 78 miles That made meface a wind of all of a hundred miles anhour 1 was all right behind my boxfor I was hidden to my eyes and thefront of it was curved enough to throwthe wind over my head Then 1 thoughtId stand up and see what it was likefacing a wind current of 100 miles anhour Well I stood up and I had allI wanted in less time than it takes totell First my tight fitting cap wentand then mv linen collar and mv necktie I thought my hair was going Ihad a horrible feeling that the wholefront of my head was as flat as a pancake 1 couldnt breathe In anotherinstant I should have been pulled bodilyout of my box in spite of the grip I hadwith both handsBy a desperate effort I succeeded inpulling myself down by the strength ofmy arms and getting behind my windshield I was a thoroughly scared andshaken man It was hours before I gotover the horror of that instant when 1stood face to face with death Chvcago Inter OceanARMY OFFICERS CALLED MRNone of Them Get Their Official TitlesIn til They Reaeh the Rankof CaptainPeople who are not versed in mattersof army usage often ask why certainarmy officers are addressed as Misterand not by their titles To the menwho enter the service from West Pointthe custom is well understood becausethy know that no matter how muchauthority they may have of how gaytheir uniform may be they are simply misters until they w ear two barson their shoulder straps A recent occurrence in the Army building illustrated the matter A man who hadbeen a field officer in the volunteer service in the war with Spain had been appointed to a lieutenancy in the newvolunteer army and called at one ofthe offices of the headquarters on amatter of business There the officerin charge presented him to a UnitedStates army officerMaj Blank allow me to present MrSmith Mr Smith Maj Blank1The volunteer officer hinted in a modest way when the major had withdrawn that it might have been wellto let the fact be known that he alsowas an army officer Oh thats allright said the officer who had actedas host everybody is mister until he iscaptainEven in service the first and secondlieutenants are addressed as misterby officers of higher rank The custom is so general that it is not unusualfor lieutenants in the regular serviceto have their visiting cards engravedwith the Mr prefixed thusMR JOHN

Gets the TimidMinnow and When the Minnow Gets the CrabThe blue crab is a pretty fair hand atcatching fish It will lie in shallowwater motionless with its pincer clawsextended and pincers open waiting foia chance to nip a minnow If one coming swimming along through the watexshould happen to pass between thoseopen jaws suddenly the jaws close amthat is the last of the minnow Butthe blue crab can do better than thissometimes it will hold motionless inone daw a shred of something on whickit has been feeding as a bait for minnows holding at the same time its other big claw with the pincer open waiting The minnows come up chargingfor the food held in the closed clawbut there are likelj to be enough ofthem to spread and they may comefrom various directions so that morethan likely one will come within thewaiting pincers of the opposite clawand when one does the proceedings areclosed for the time beingBut sometimes the minnows get theblue crab as they may do when thecrab is shedding The crab knows whenthat time is coming and then it makesfor a place where it can shed its shelland stay in safety until its new shellis sufficiently hard to protect it Thecrab comes in with the tide and makesfor some place on the bottom in shallow water perhaps along the edge ofthe eel grass or under some protectingpatch of ulva and then proceeds tolig a hole in which it can stay after ithas shed its shell until it is strongenough to go about It digs the sandor mud up around from under itselfand as likely as not leaves its discarded shell in a most lifelike form up onthe sand on the edge of the hole infront of it This shell would frightenaway some small fishes that wouldnot dare to tackle a crab in its ordinary condition The discarded shell isa help to fishermen who are huntingcrabs because it shows where a crabmay be found and weakfish whichcome inshore in shallow water to feedhunt up soft crabs by searching theneighborhood of the spot where theyfind a shell just as a fishermanwould doWhen the crab first sheds its shell itis perfectly helpless Its new shell isas yet so soft that it is no protectionto it and no support the crab cannoteven stand up The shell hardens rapidly and it may be that by the timeof the next full tide the crab will beable to move about and defend itselfbut for a time after it sheds it is helplessThat is when the minnow gets thecrab The crab may have been letby the receding tide above the edgeof the water When the incoming tidehas again covered the crab and surrounded it with water to the depth ofan inch or two the minnows may discover it and they come swimmingalong through the shallow water toattack it Sometimes a fisherman discovers a soft crab by the splashing thatthe minnows kick up around it If undisturbed the minnows swarmingaround the helpless crab will kill andeat it But sometimes another bluecrab will appear and break up the minnows feast This is a blue crab thathas not shed its shell but has its armoron It comes stalking in among theminnows perhaps nipping one of themin one of its pincer claws as it comesup and dispersing the restThe blue crab is a cannibal it willeat its own kind If when this crabcomes up there is any of the soft crableft the newcomer will very likely eatthat first with one daw holding meanwhile in its other the wriggling minnow which it had seized at the outset keeping that to top off with N

cupidity of the hated money lender wasthe subject of pawns and pledgesmentioned Moreover the history ofpawnbrokinc is so interwoven withthat of usury and banking- that itscomplete separation from these subjects is for a time at least an impossibility From earliest times and withall peoples the system of pledging effects as security for advances in moneyhas existed in some form In this earlyperiod all those who accepted pledgesas security for loans were not pawnbrokers in the sense that we to day usethe term Of the antiquity of pawnbroking we are assured but are without a clew as to what might have beenits process of metamorphosis from thetime of the Jewish laNv to that of theRoman Its analogy to banking thefact that the pawnbrokers later became bankers would lead to the conclusion that private pawnbrokers existed long before the state took cognizance of the business It seems probable that the constant taking of artides in pledge which of necessity demanded their safekeeping to securethe repayment of the loan suggestedthe like deposit of money and valuables In this case the progenitor of thepresent banking system was originally a pawnshop instead of a bankwhich later took up the pawn businessBulletin of the Department of LaborA Cautions ChildA downtown resident who hc abright little daughter told an anecdotewhich he thought showed great cautionand

givenway to silent despair The dog lav asleepin a corner I meant to have proffered thegold I had with me as a loan to Corte butI did not dare to address him in his griefSo placing the coins quietly on the table insuch a manner that when he raised his headhe must see them I withdrew as noiselesslyas I came and reached my room without attracting any attention It was not until thesmall hours of the morning that I sought mycouch for my mind kept working on thethoughts which agitated me after witnessinethe death of Cortes daughter At the sametime I was able to see that this consideration of the suffering of others was of thegreatest benefit to me It took me out ofmyself It showed me that my own werenot the only sorrows in the world and thatthere might yet be others who had reacheda deep ot misery as far below that of Corteas his was below mine This led me on toconsider my own position and I began tothink there was some mysterious powerthat was preventing me carrying out myplan of reprisal against DEntrangues Ihad come to Florence red hot on his trackAt our very first meeting he had won thehazard and the long illness that followedgave bim chance to put a distance betweenus then my resources diminished whilst yetnothing was done then came the doubtsas to whether I was justified in my actionand finally and not least there was in me ahaunting desire to see Angiola as I calledher to myself once again I was pulled bydifferent strings There was what 1 calledconscience urging me to give up my schemesof revenge there was the wild animal in metelling me to go on there was a feeling towards a woman which I had honestly neverexperienced before which despite my struggles against its apparently hopeless follywas entirely overmastering me until I didnot know which way to turn and to escapefrom it all decided to leave Florence atonce and then altered my mind again when1 thought of the plot I wished to thwartand determined to make a last effort to dothis and if possible to see Angiola oncea man killed not ten feet from me He rose more before I left At last 1 went to sleepto bis elbow as the fiends approached and waking very late in the morning o soundwas my slumber that when i awoue rthought at first that the events of the nightwere nothing more than a dream but theysoon forced themselves on me in their reality and the fact was emphasized by the sightof the odd pauls which were now my aillying on the table I gathered these up andproceeded in search of Ceci to ask if he hadmade any arrangements for the burial buthe was nowhere to be found and as I couldnot bring myself to see Corte then I resolved to breakfast on fresh air a diet whichhowever wholesome was I found certainlynot satisfying 1 went to theOricellari Gardens which were at that time the

finer andeven the unfortunate who wishes to gainleace of mind in sylvan shades should havea full belt This fact obtruded itself moreand more strongly on me and I could obtainlittle relief by the expedient of tighteningmy sword belt by a hole or so Therefore indespair I left the beauties of nature to be sogood as to look after themselves and disbursed a half paul in something to eat afterwhich I felt able to face the prospect of future starvation with a more serene mindI passed the day quietly and in the afternoon Ceci came to tell me all was ready forthe burial He gave me to understand thatCarte had listened to reason in the matterof a priest although 1 never knew what arguments he had used to effect this Thefuneral was much as other pauper burialsand when it was over we walked back together On our return a man accosted Ceciwho he said was his nephew and theywent off together on some business Had Ionly known what I was to be indebted tothis gentleman for shortly I should haveobserved him with greater attention As ithappened I gave him but a passing glancecatching a glimpse of a paleface with strongclear cut features and keen bright eyesCorte and I were now alone and respectinghis grief I said no word nor did he speakas we threaded our way back Near StMarks Corte suddenly seized my handraised it to his lips and then turning fleddown a sde street and was lost to view Iattempted to follow fearing that sorrowhad totally unhinged his mind already alittle off its balance and that he wouldcome to injury My attempt however waswithout avail and I returned home to disprove the proverb which falsely says thathe who Bleeps dinesThe next day I was again favored with avisit from Ceci and after some allusion tothe funeral he once more broached the subject on which he had sounded me before andasked for a definite reply I gave it to himwithout hesitationMesser Ceci I said whatever my condition may be you are in error if you think1 am a bravo In short your proposal is aninsult and you owe it to my considerationfor your years that I do not liing you oftt of Jtin room I have promised you secrecy andtherefore cannot do as I would and that islay the matter

employment to no avail and inthe intervals of my fruitless search for workhaunted the streets and gardens with thehope of obtaining another glimpse of Angiola but without success Inch by inchmy resources diminished until they bebecame so small that a blind beggar wouldhave hardly thanked me for the gift ofthem I lived in constant dread of Ceci reappearing to demand the sum I owed formy rent but he did not come He was evidently giving me time starving me out tosurrender to his terms I used to see him as Iwent in and out sitting in his office like aspider yet he never even lifted his head asI passed I hated almost feared going bythat door Bitterly did I regret not havingleft Florence when I was able It was nowimpossible to do so unless as a defaulter andthe weight of my paltry debt oppressed meas if a cannon ball were slung around myneck I could not leave until I paid it andof doing this there seemed no prospect 1had parted with my cloak for money to buyfood but the last copper of that was goneand I wis now penniless For two days 1had not eaten anything but a morsel ofbread and on the morning of the third day1 rose desperate with hunger and preparedto go to any lengths to satisfy it 1 ate myself esteem and made another attempt tosee La Palisse but was denied admittanceand when I came back I actually hesitatedbefore the door of Cet s office and almostI made up my mind to yield and say I woulddo his business tor him It required an effort so low had I sunk to rouse mv pride-At last it flared up and with a check hotat my weakness I sought my chamber andthere passed the day The pigeons thatlived under the eaves opposite my windowand to whose soft cooing I so often listenedwith pleasure before now aroused otherthoughts within me If 1 could only lureone within reach But it was impossibleand I glared at them w they fluttered andflirted with each other with the hungryeyes of a cat balked of her prey At last Igave it up and with a curse flung myself onmy bed Fool that 1 was Five-and-thirtyyears should have brought me wisdom I hadstayed on in Florence allowed my chances ofrevenge to get more distant in fact reacheda stage of mind when I was doubtful if Icould rightly exact vengeance drifted intoabject poverty and worse than that wascontinually thinking of a woman who whenI had rendered her a service treated me withcontempt who had no doubt forgotten meby this time amidst her duties if she hadany and her pleasures of which I doubt notshe had store So the evening came amidstmy reflections and self reproaches and itbeing dusk I decided to goforth again andsnatch a purse if necessary to obtain foodAs I rose an impulse i could not controlmade me unfasten my money belt andsearch if by chance there was a coin withinit Of course there was not a brown copperbut my fingers in running up the belttouched something hard and I pulled forthattached to its tag of red ribbon my crossof St Lazare which it will be remembered 1 had placed therein for safety thenight I was imprisoned in the Villa AccoltiI had clean forgot it in my troubles and nowit lay in my open palm with the diamonds init winking in my face Iy whole frametrembled with excitement Here was themeans of freeing myself from debt at onceand of obtaining funds to quit Florence nayEurope At the lowest computation itsWOrth could not have been less than fortycrown- and this at present was wealth tome What with the effects of the want offood and the sudden discovery of the crossI began to feel weak all over and flingingthe badge on the table sank down into achair before it to compose myself Theloom was almost dark and I sat staring atthe jewels and at the diamonds on it whichsparkled through the gloom That littletrinket was linked with the one great eventof my life All the past came vividlv beforemy excited brain I was again in that desperate retreat oi Charles of France uptievalley of the Taro with the army of theLeague in full cry behind us The old boarTrevulzio

gonethrough life contemptuous of buttonholesand I was a little taken aback about thattime when I ran against him at a cornerwith a Marechal Niel at his breast Hewhipped it hurriedly into his pocket andbeing a kindly old gentleman I pretended not to noticeBut my faith in him Wttl profoundlyshaken Soon I learned that he was conveying tastef ll little buttonholes into tbshouse up his coat sleeve and he blushedwhen he wad asked about a tumbler inhis bedroom Then his mother foundsix button glove size 5 in his pocketwhich none of us could identifyFor some days he had only one glovehimself which he carried spread out inhis hand to look like two We could notthink that this was its long lost companionPending investigations the glove wasreplaced in Alberts pocket in the nicelittle piece of tissue paper which protected it Then we watched Albert Hitherto he had a habit of leaving the roomwhen the conversation took a feminineturn But now a change came over himHe sat on when his mother talked withhis aunt over the relative merits of stylesof gowns and though he pretended to bereading his book he was really drinkingin the conversationOn nnp nccjision he came out of hisshell in a remarkable manner The twoladies were asking each other what wasthe other name for the waterfall backand Albert carried away by his interestin the discussion murmured RedingoteHis mother and his aunt looked at himin amazement which made Albert turnboth white and red Not long afterwardit leaked out that he knew what sailorcollars were and liked pale pink onesAlbert even began to take an interestin his sisters dressesOnce he was discovered trying to ascertain for himself how much Gertrude whois 14 measured round the waist Not being accustomed to these attentions Gertrude liked them at first but it was soonborne in upon her though she was only14 that her brother was experimentingon her for private reasons of his ownAlbert was also curious to know whatsize in boots Gertrude required and smiled to himself when told Gertrude whohas known since she was 4 that she haslarge feet did not like thisIt must I think have been a week after the discovery of the glove in Albertspocket that he asked his mother with anartificial yawn whether 5Vfc was not asmall size in gloves for a lady Then hismother asked me to go delicately to workand find out what was Alberts conditionand who she wasI thought I would leave it to Albert totell me who she was but I experimentedon him to discover his condition Nothing I feel could have been more delicatethan the way I set about it He carriedthe glove in an inside jfeket over thespot where Albert thought his heart wasTaking advantage of a favorable momentI got at the coat and changed the gloveto another pocketThe next time I had an opportunity forit it was hack in the old place againThis happened several times Albert whois a simple youth for all his cunning evidently thinking that he had put the gloveinto the wrong pocket himself Then Ihazarded a bolder step Again takingpossession of the glove I dropped it in acorner of the drawing roomThat evening Albert came back fromthe olfice in a perturbed state of mind Iwatched him on his knees in the halllooking for something and when he sawme he pretended to be unlacing his shoeslie wandered from room to room and wassubsequently heard flinging his thingsabout in his bedroom He said not aword about hit loss however to any oneNext morning 1 was surprised to seehim bright and cheerful I went intothe drawing room and behold the glovewas gone From the way the unsuspecting Albert was incessantly puttinghis hand Into that inside pocket I sawthat there was once a 5Mi glove in it 1had feared that Albert would treasure itsomewhere else now but no he evidentlythought that he had dropped it in thedrawing room accidentally perhaps after passionately gazing on it in secretBut the awakening came when 1 concealed the little glove in a vase on thesmoking room mantelpiece Albert ranit to earth in a day and a half withoutsaying a word on the subject to anybody unless possibly the housemaidWhen next I felt for it in his pocket itwas not there From that time Albertand I were playing at hide and seekWhen 1 was not looking for the glove hewas 1 found it inside tne case or niscricket bat and dropped it behind theniano Albert searched it out and soonafterward I got it under a corner of thecarpet in his bedroom Then I hid itamong some music knowing that Albertwould look there last All this time 1did not know if he suspected who it wasthat waB playing with him I do notknow now for we have never opened ourminds on the subjectAlbert did not find the glovo amongthe music When two days had passedI put it in an easier place for Albert wasbearing his disappointment bravely Stillhe did not find it Next I flung it on thefloor of his bedroom and Albert did notseem to see it 1 laid It on his mantelpiece and he let it remain there At lastit struck me to look in Alberts pocketagain There was another glove in itsize 6 eight bs IconsThen I weit to Alberts mother andtold her hi- us cured New York NewsA Slap at LatlaWay is Latin taught in the schoolsBecause some foolish
