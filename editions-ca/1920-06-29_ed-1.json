A mass meeting of Millersburg
asrtizens was held at the Farmers
3Bank, Thursday evening for th
purpose of protesting the action ot
County Supt. Caywood and the
County School Board, in refusing to
aeconsider the school situation here.
The citizens voted unanimous to
ffite an injunction against the Board,
as we believe, through the , advice
of tneir attorney that the prelimi
nary steps taken by Mr. Caywood
asd the Board were not legal. We
regTet this step exceedingly, as it

VALUE OP BLACK WALNUT.
Not many years ago the settlers
of the Middle West were girdling
black walnut trees, in order to kill
'hem. They were too lazy to cut
them down, and took this method to
destroy the life of the trees, so that
they might plant corn and grain
among the dead trees. In some lo
calities mills were sawing the wal
nut logs into lumber for all pur
poses, even lor floors and clap
boaids, inside finish and everything:
that could be made from 11, and
many a good board has been split
for kindling. Walnut was then
cheap and plentiful, and no one
thought that it would become ex
hausted, but to-day it is hard to
find and the price is very high, as i?
illustrated by the fact that a Mary
land farmer recently sold four old
walnut stumps for $1,000; just such
stumps as the farmers were working
hard to pull up and bum a few
yeais ago. Walnut is not alone in
its scarcity and the time is not far
distant when the owners of timber
land will be the men the people will
take heir hats off to, and even get
down upon their knees to; for tim
ber is yet to be the king.

Corrective osteopathic adjustment
and gymnasium work arc being in
stituted in some of the public
schools of Kentucky by Dr. Martha
Petree, of Paris, who showed mov
ing pictures of the class work at tHe
International Convention of the
American Osteopathic Association" in
Hip Hotel Sherman, Chicago.
Dr. Petree reported that fifty per
cent, of the public school children
have drooping right shoulders with
jpinal curvature convexed to the
left, and about the same number
have flattened upper spines and
backward slumping of the small of
the back. These two groups over
lap, thirty per cent having both.
Another group included drooping
shoulders, narrow chest and droop
ing head.
"In trying to find the cause of the
right drooping shoulder," said Dr.
Petree, "I watched them at their
desks, but found no clue. One dav
1 drove up and down the street
watching the childien on their way
io school. I found them carrying
their books under their left arms
and pulling up their shoulder girdle
1o help in the work of carrying. If
a book sack was carried, it hung on
the left side from the right shoul
der, thus drooping the right
shoulder. Another year I hope to 4
get a knapsack on the local market.
which will eliminate the badeffect
of the present method of carrying
books." ,
