Goosumption
Catarrh invariably leads to consump
tion Orowing worse and worse each
winler those who rely upon the usual
treatment of sprays washes and inhal
ing raiiKtures find that it is impossible
ta cJieck the disea e with these local
applications which only reach the sur
face The offensive discharge increases
all the while and gets deeper until it is
only a question of z sort time when
the lungs are affected
The importance of the proper treat
ment caa therefore fc readily appreciated-
But no good whatever can be
expected from local applications as
such treatment never did cure Catarrh
and never will Being a blood disease
of the most obstinate nature Swifts
Specific SSS is the only remedy
which can have the slightest effect upon
Catarrh It is the only blood remedy
that goes down to the bottom of all stub
born diseases which other remedies
cannot reach
Mrs Josephine Polhill of Due West
S C writes
I had such a severe case of
Catarrh that I lost my hearing in one
ear and part of the bone in my nose
sloughed off I was constantly treated
with sprays and
washes but each
winter the disease
seemed to have a
firmer hold on me
I had finally been
declared incurable
when I decided to
try S S S It
seemed to get right
at the seat of the
disease and cured me permanently
for I have had no touch of Catarrh
for seven years
The experience of Mr Chas A Parr
of Athens ia was like that of all
others who vainly seek a cure in local
treatment He says
For years I suffered from a severe
case of Catarrh the many offensive
symptoms Deiug ac
companied by severe
pains in the head I
took several kinds of
medicines recom
mended for Catarrh
and used various local
applications but they
had no effect
er
I was induced to
take SSS Swifts
0L
Specific and after four months I was
perfectly well and have never felt any
effects of the disease since
Those who have had the first
touchof Catarrh will save endless suf
fering by taking the right remedy at the
outset Others who have for years
gong lit relief and found only disappoint
ment in local treatment will find it wise
to waste no further time on sprays
-washes inhaling mixtures etc which
are only temporary and cannot save
them from dreaded Consumption
They should take a remedy which will
cure them because it can reach their
trouble SSS is the only blood reme
dy wich can reach Catarrh it promptly
gets at the very bottom of the disease
and cures it permanently
SSS Swifts Specific is a real Mood
rtiiicdy and cures the most obstinate
casei of Catarrh Rheumatism Conta
gions Blood Poison Cancer Scrofula
and Eczema which other so called blood
remedies have no effect upon whatever
SSS is the only blood remedy

the human anatomy is put together in
order to give grace and freedom of ac

extent wanting in the lower animals
The marked superiority of the hand
over the fore paw of any oreature is
dwelt upon The brain comes in for spe
cial study It is said that the brains of
boys weigh more at thek birth than
those of girls and that men of great in-
men would employ in doing a tithe of
the work It would be interesting if the
British association would give us the ex

Pullmans Giant Passenger
There was one story of his career
that Mr Pujlman used to tell with
manifest delight
One night going out of Chicago a
long lean ugly man with a wart on
his eheek came into the depot He paid
George M Pullman 50 cents and half
a berth was assigned him Then he
kicked off his boots which were of sur
prising length turned into the berth
and having an easy conscience was
sleeping like a healthy baby before the
car left the depot Along came another
passenger and paid his 50 cents In two
minutes he was back at George Pull
man
Theres a man in that berth of
mine said he hotly and hes about
ten feet high How am I going to sleep
there Id like to know Go and lock at
him
In went Pullman mad too The
tall lank mans knees were under his
chin his arms were stretched across
the bed and his feet were stored com
fortably for him Pullman shook him
until he awoke and then told him if
he wanted the whole berth he would
have to pay 1
My dear sir said the tall man a
contract is a contract 1 have paid you
50 cents for haH this berth and qb
you see I am occupying it Theres the
other half pointing to a strip about
six inches wide Sell that and dont
disturb me again And so saying
the man with a wart on his face went
to sleep again He was Abraham Lin

Bostons Clerical Romany
I have it on the authority of Wil
liam Dean Howells and other eminent
of Massachusetts a certain elerevman
of widespread fame who unknown to
the world at large is a Romany Every
summer this reverend gentleman cannot
resist joining some gypsy band and
roaming from place frg place as his Lu
dred have done sincg within them em ory
of raaa Kittle do tho gd mans con
gregation dream thati Whie they pic
ture -him asseflately jomatieying abroad
he ifc sitting beside gypsy campfires and
chattering the wild Romany tongue to
all intents and purposes a vagrant But
as Mr Howells pointed out none ever
heard it said that this preacher preached
any the worse for his wild free life over
road and prairie Indeed the increased
vigor and eloquence of his sermons im
mediately af ter each successive annual
vacation have long been matters of
comment in Boston Washington

In a Few Bare Cases Only
Apart from is well known use
said a doctor chloroform has been dis
covered to possess a virtue which was
hardly expected of it
It has been observed in a few rare
cases that after an operation under chlo
roform on a child of weak intellect there
has been a general sharpening up of its
wits and signs of increased intelligence
which was not merely transient
Insensibility of the brain is of
course induced by the anaesthetic and
with the return of consciousness parts
of the brain which have hitherto been
dormant or not sufficiently active share
in the general awakening having re
ceived from the reaction some stimulus
which was theerm of greater and per
manent activity Strand Magazine

Too Smart
General Hancock was sorely tried in I
looj uy me extreme iresmiess or some
of the officers f his command One day
the major of a western regiment rodo
up to Hancocks headquarters and with
out dismounting asked that General
Hancock step out of his tent as he de
sired to speak with him When the
superb came forth the pompous ma
jor said to the general that he had come
over for the purpose of getting orders as
to what his regiment should do that aft
ernoon and without waiting for Han
cock to give directi6ns he went on to
state that in his opinion as the com
mander of tho regiment in the absence
of the colonel and lieutenant colonel
his regiment should devote most of the
afternoon to battalion drill Hancock
quietly gave directions that his regi
ment remain in camp and fix up its
quarters as nicely as possible When
the major rode away Hancock squared
himself folded his hands and looked
after him Without addressing any par
ticular person he said Tho major is

It Brings Ravishing Dreams of Bliss
In southern Arizona the jail and
prison officials have their hands full in
trying to prevent the smuggling into
their institutions of the seductivema
riguana This is a kind of loco weed
more powerful than opium It is a dan
gerous thing for the uninitiated to han
dle but those who know its uses say it
produces more ravishing dreams than
opium The Mexicans mix it with to
bacco and smoke it with cigarettes in
haling the smoke When used in this
way it produces a hilarious spirit in
the smoker that cannot be equaled by
any other form of dissipation When
smuggled inside the prison walls the
Mexicans readily pay 4 an ounco for
it but free men buy it on theoutsid
