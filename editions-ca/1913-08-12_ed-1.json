A raid upon two blind tigers was
made in, Millersburg Sunday night by
Sheriff A. S. Thompson and two depu
ties resulting in the arrest of one man
charged with selling liquor without a
license and in local option territory.
Joe Taylor, a negro, is in jail here
charged with the offense and is await
ing his examining trial.
Sunday, the officials here received a
communication to the effect that
liquor was being sold in Millersburg.
A colored camp meeting had been in
progress for several days and the town
was thronged with negroes. Consid
erable drunkenness was noticed and
an investigation revealed two houses
occupied by negroes which were fre
quently visited and in wliich it was
believed liquor was being sold.
After receiving the message Sheriff
Thompson left immediately in an auto
mobile accompanied by Deputy Sheriff
W. F. Talbott and Patrolman James
Moreland. Arriving in Millersburg the
officers went to the home of Walter
Turney which they surrounded. The
negro attempted to escape from the
building but at each door was con
fronted by an officer. Seeing escape
was impossible through the doorways
he made his exit by one of the win
dows taking the sash with him and
made good his escape.
They next went to the home of Tay
lor and an officer was placed at each
doorway. He submitted to arrest with
out making any attempt to escape.
He was brought to Paris where he ws
lodged in jail.
At the home of Turney the officers
confiscated a one gallon jug of whisky,
four quart bottles that had not been
opened besides several pints and half
pints In his flight the negro left $11 in
cash. Two or three gallons of whisky
were found at tlU3 home of Taylor be
sides a number of empty beer .bottles.
They will be used as evidence against
him at his examining trial.

Where Theft Is Unknown.
Finland is a realm whose inhabi
tants are remarkable for their invio
late integrity. There are no banks
and no safe deposits, for no such
security is essential. You may leave
your luggage anywhere for any length
of time, and be quite sure of finding
it untouched on your return, and your
purse full of money would be just as
secure under similar circumstances.
Was It a Hint?
They had been talking as they
walked. She had remarked pathet
ically: "Oh, it must be terrible to a
man to be rejected by a woman!"
"Indeed it must," was his response.
Then, after a while, with sympathetic
ingenuousness, she exclaimed: "It
doesn't seem that I could ever have
the heart to do it." And there came
a silence between them as he thought
it over.
It is one thing to make soda
crackers that are occasionally
good.
It is quite another thing to
make them so that they are
always better than all other
soda crackers, always of un
varying goodness. e
The name "Unee da" stamped jm
every biscuit means that if a million
packages of Uneeda Biscuit were
placed before you, you could choose
any one of them, confident that every
soda cracker in "that package would
be as good as the best Uneeda Biscuit
ever baked. Five cents.

Light on the Spot.
An attachment has been made to the
revolver by a French inventor by
which the weapon in the hands of a
greenhorn is as deadly as in those of
a dead-sure shot. A small and power
ful electric lamp is mounted on the
weapon in such a manner that a cir
cle of light is projected upon the tar
get and the bullet will strike the cen
ter of the ring. This particular loca
tion is marked by a dark spot, and
this spot being placed over the heart
of an adversary and the trigger pull
ed the bullet cannot fail in its deadly
work.
Critics, Take Notice.
Great writers cantingly criticised by
small writers of whom Dr. Parr might
be happy to say, that they have pro
fundity without obscurity perspicu

out glare terseness without barren

comprehensiveness without digression
and a great number of other things
without a great number of other
things. Sydney Smith.

Arnold a Lenient Examiner.
When Matthew Arnold was a school
examiner a fellow inspector of a class
of girl pupil-teachers asked Arnold to
examine for him. Arnold gave each,
of the young women the "excellent"
mark. "But," said the other inspec
tor, "surely they are not all as good
as they can be; some must be better
than others." "Perhaps that is so," re
plied Arnold; "but then, you see, they;
are all such very nice girls."
