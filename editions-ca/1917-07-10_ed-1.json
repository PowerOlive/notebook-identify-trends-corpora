years of her life, and where she was
married to Mr. McDonald. She was

past three or four years Mr. Neal
had become an expert electrician and
before his illness had been connected
with the Westinghouse Electrical
Co., and with the Thompson-Houston
Electrical Co., in their big plants
in Chicago.
Mr. Neal was a young man pos
sessed of many admirable traits of
character, not the least of which was
loyalty to friends and devotion to his
mother and sister. He was well
liked by all who knew him and hie
passing away is a source of genuine
regret to a large circle of friends.
Mr. Neal is survived by his moth

Miss Mayme Neal, both of Parte

AUTO AND BUGGY COME IN COL
LISION. t
Saturday afternoon, while the
crowd on the streets was the thickest
and traffic almost congested, threy
autos coming from different direc
tions, and a horse and buggy met at
the corner of Main and Eighth
streets. The buggy was crushed by
the collision, but the occupants, a
man, woman and child, whose names
were not ascertained, escaped injury
One of the machines had the fend
ers badly bent and a headlight bro
ken. The other two escaped injury.
The three machines came to a point
at exactly the same moment in try
ing to avoid striking the horse and
buggy, whose driver seemed dazed,
but one of them struck the vehicle:
smashing the front and hina wheels
on one side.
The accident occurred at a time
when street traffic was very heavy, j
Travel was delayed until the wrecked
buggy and the autos were entangled
and taken away.

During the Civil War the "Squir

out to see that they don't operate
