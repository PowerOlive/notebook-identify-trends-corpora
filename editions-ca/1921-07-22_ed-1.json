This is a picture written by the gifted C. Gardner Sullivan and of
the 'abundance of stories which he has sponsered "Sex" may be said to
outclass them all in its dramatic elements and the strength of its
moral. The author has looked at life and painted it truthfully.
He has used the eternal triangle in a new way, bringing out in
the telling not only an absorbing drama but a sound moral. Undoubt
edly the offering is the best thing that the star has ever had and she
rises to the occasion by giving a portrayal marked for its emotional
depth.
