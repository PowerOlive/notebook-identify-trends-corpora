liaHT DISPATCHER
Its about 11 years now since I handled
trains by wiro and I would not go back to
it for 100 a day You have really no idea
of how it wears on a man Some stand it
better than others but it wrecks every
ones nerves sooner or later
When I was appointed night dispatcher
on this road I thought I was the biggest
man in Missouri I took to smoking 15
cent cigars and wcayng 8 hats I had a
well developed case of swelled head and
showed it all over me A few months ex
ierienco with faithless operators tricky
trainmen and arrogant superiors however
took the conceit out of me and I began to
realize just how big a job it was to handle
a heavy train wire and give satisfaction
The fact is the man who can please all
hands has yet to be born There are times
when some train must be delayed and its
often a case of Hobsons choice The train
men who wait curse the dispatcher into
themiddle of purgatory and back again
and those who get advantage brag about
the run they made
One night the road was fairly hot with
trains when I came on duty I wondered
how in thunder I should ever get the pas
senger train through without delay There
seemed to be a train on every side track
over the whole length of the road and more
between stations I worked like a beaver
It was in the old days of what are known
as single orders when each train received
a separate order which must be sent to
each one concerned singly You will easily
see how in the rush of business a single
order might be incorrectly transmitted and
trains leave stations under conflicting or
ders which would certainly bring them
together unless corrected Nowadays the
most progressive roads all use orders so
wordd that two trains or more receive
them at the same time and thus the risk
of error is lessened That system was
hardly known in my time and we worked
on the perilous single order plan
A double header left the foot of the
mountain auout midnight holding an
orcLr giving it the right to Summit About
35 minutes ahead of it was a fast freight
The latter had an engine numbered 427
and the double train had engines 342 and
327 You must remember I was working
every minute trying to keep the freights
out of the way of the night passenger
trains
Along toward morning a train was
ready to go down the mountain and 1
gave it an order to run wild and wait for
engine 427 at Summit In some way or
other the double train following slipped
my memory completely I have thought
since I must have got mixed on the two
numbers 427 and 327 At any rate when
the operator at Summit reported the two
trains leaving it came over me with the
suddenness and pain of a galvanic shock
uhat I had given what we call a lap order
The horrible feeling that seized me of
ten makes me shudder when I think of it
now My nana ten rrom tne Key limp
and nerveless Something seemed to cast
a blur before my eyes so I could not read
the orders before me The blood rushed to
my head and my temples beat like trip
hammers But only for a second Like a
flash I seized the key and asked the opera
tor to stop the down train It was too
late it had1 gone Then I tried to reach
the double train but it too had passed
the last telegraph office and I knew that
no earthly power could prevent those trains
from striking and striking hard for the
grade is nearly 20 feet to the mile up there
I sent for the chief dispatcher immedi
ately and told him the situation He was
an old hand at the business and an affair
of this kind fretted his nerves almost to
the point of insanity He added nearlyOO
per cent to my agony of mind He would
git down and look the train sheet over and
seem to devour the fatal orders with his
eyes then jump up with a gesture of de
spair and say By gosh thats too bad I
Then he would pace up and down the floor
repeating to himself Thats too bad too
bad theyll strike as sure as the world
returning always to pore over the train
sheet and order book I could have screamed
with the awful strain of nervous suspense
I confidently believe that nothing but lacl
of courage and the curious fascination kept
me from rushing out and jumping off the
bridge into the river 75 feet below
I felt absolutelycertain that some of
those men would be killed Had both trains
been single the drivers might possibly see
each others headlights in time to jump
but I was sure ihe men on the second en
gine of the double header would go into
the wreck all over and die as sure as fate
It has become fashionable nowadays to dis
believe in a physical hereafter I dont
know anything about that but I do know
that if mental torture be the let cf those
who sin in this life after err accounts are
audited I should prefer to take my chances
with the old fashioned style of punishment
Suddenly both relays opened with a
snap The chief looked at me with a per
fectly indesoribable expression and went to
the switchboard without a word We both
knew without telling what it meant The
trains had struck and the piled up wreck
age had broken the wires down We tested
for the break and soon located it half way
up the mountain I gave up the last par
ticle of hope at this and only waited in a
kind of dull wonder to learn the extent of
the casualty
The 35 or 40 minutes that elapsed after
the wire failed until we got he official re
port of the accident seem to me now as
misty as a dream I worked away2at the
wire imechanically guided only by the
force of habit using the circuits as they
were made up by the chief He kept fuss
lfg at the switchboard in a perfect misery
3f nervousness
At length the Summit operator called
and my heart beat almost audibly as I an
swered him for I knew from his tremu
lous sending that he had received the re
port I think he must have understood
my feelings for the first words he tele
graphed almost crazed me with gratitude
Before sending a line of the formal report
he told me Theres nobody hurt I gave
up right then and there and said Mr H
youll have to take the rest of this report
I cant and got up and went home
It seems the engineer saw the head
lights and jumped and the men on the
first engine of the double header after
sounding a sharp whistle for brakes
Bhrieked to the following crew to jump and
kept on shrieking after they struck the
ground and until the engine passed them
The warning was heard in time and all
hands got off with nothing worse than a
few bruises but that finished my train
dispatching Exchange
Origin of Sales
I suppose remarked a merchant
that removal sales and fire sales are of
comparatively recent introduction into the
commercial world
I dont know about that replied an
other but a gentleman named Koah en
gineered the first flood sail of which there
is any record Pittsburg
