It is known that bad feelinghas existed between the two men ;forsome time, which is attributed as thecause os the attack and the woundingoi Whaley.From the nature of the wounds it isevident that the shooting was done atclose quarters, and the wounds onWhaley's arm bore evidence of "powderburns, and that in the struggle whichinsued in the effort to secure a hold onthe weapon Whaley had used the armas a protecton for his body, whichprobably saved his life.At the sound of the fourth shot anumher of people on the street rushedm that direction and the first mantoreach Whaley was Will Freeman a colored barber, who with the assistanceof others, removed the injured man tohi3-barber shop, where medical attention was summoned, Drs.

Nowthese same roads, through indirectionand by piecemeahare trying to accomplish tne verv thing'the commission toldthem they could not do. As part ottheir strategy, the roads have hiedwith the commission a new classification of freights that is, the.v havesubmitted a plan whereby certainarticles of one class.on which a certainrate is allowed, have been "jumped"into a rlass above, carrying a higherrate. All told, more than 1,400 articleshave been thus reclassified, and if thecommission permits this arrangementto go into effect the people will simply Ihave to pay more to have these articleshauled, because when ever a freightrate is increased the retailei must addthe amount of the reincrea3e to the retail price of the article. The proposedincrease range from ten to three hundred tier cent.The roads were careful to reduce therates on a ceratin number oi articles.nnnarsntlv for the Dumose of detracting attention from the many increases.The state railroad commission ofeighteen states have united in the protest againft the new classifications,pointing cut that the proposed increaseare more than 60 per cent in excess ofthe reductions, and charging that therecldssificaiton plan is simply a subterfuge to get through a big increase ofrates.The public has no objection to therailroads paying increased wages to itsworkmen, but welcomts such increases. The public has no objectiont railroads making a good generous rate of interest on money investedin railroad properties. The public doesnot wish to see the railroads hamperedin any way, because they are thearteries of commerce of the nation.But the public does object to the railroads requiring the public Ito payenormous dividens in addition to creating a huge annual surplus on moneythat is not invested, and on capitalization that represents nothing morethan blue air.Senator LaFoilette, has shown thatthe corporations of this country arecapitalized at $31,672,000,000, and that70 per cent of this capitalization iswater. More andmore water is beingconstantly injected into the capitalization of the railroads, which makes itnecessary for the roads to be constantly boosting freight rates and 'increasing the cost of living to every man,woman and child in the nation.Under the Roosevelt and Taftadministration, Congress refused topass a bill providing for a physicalvaluation of the railroad properties,which appears to be the only solutionof the evil which permits the gougingof the common peoDle inorder that afew railroad magnates may be stillfurther enriched. Bpfore this sessioncloses, however, the Democratic Housewill enact such legislation, the billhaving already been favorably reported from the committee on interstate"and foreign commerce.p B TT I C K jI Model No. 40 Price $900 1Comyletely EquippedIWill stand more hard use and abuse than Iany light roadster ever built.

Garbage cans.and manure are necessary evils, andthese may be mitigated by proper care,but there is no excuse for other formsof filth around a house.Keep the fly from breeding by a 'generous use of lime or kerosene oil; but ifthey come in spite of precautions, thencatch them with fly payer or fly traps,or kill them with fly poison.

Although Paris hasbeen in the leatrue three seasons in thepast this is the first season that theopening game in the championshipseries has been scheduled for the localgrounds, and the season will have avery auspacious opening if the weatherman will permit.It is the plan of the local Tmanagement to celebrate the occasion with agrand parade, which wH be headed bythe High School band and march to theball park. In the past it ihas beenthe established rule to close all of thestores between two o'clock in theafternoon until five to allow the clerksand business men to attend the game,and it is the opinion that the rule willbe followed' this season, especially soas the Paris team plays its first gameat home.Mayor J. T. Hinton will in all probability throw the first ball, and delivera short speech. In all the occasion atthis date bids fair to be very successfulfrom every point of view, apd the Parismanagement will exert itself with thisobject in view.The local team which has been atpractice for the past three weeks, ismaking much progress and'imnrovingdaily. The men should be in grandshape to Dattle with the Hustlers inthe opener, as the practice games inwhich they have played have helpedthem wonderfully, and from the factthey have not lost a single one, lookpretty good on the face.Tomorrow afternoon the locals willmeet the strong Heidleburg team fromCincinnati and also Sunday afternoon,at White Park.
