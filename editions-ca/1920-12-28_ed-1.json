"The Deep Purple"
From the play by Paul Armstrong and
Wilson Mizner.,
The glare and the Jazz and the rau
cous unreality of the "joy" that- fills the
glittering cabaret; the easy, care-free
manners of the fashionably tailored high
ciass wolves who prey upon society: the
subtle plots and schemes of the money
mad crooks who operate in the ever throb
bing White Light district, are features of
"The Deep Purple," a picture with a
hundred thrills.

BROOKS & SNAPP
The American newspaperman is
the best detective there is. He daily
proves U, and he sometimes admits
it. Now there's Michael Collins, the-strong-arm
man of Sinn Fein,
"Mick." as every Irish Republican
calls hinv For more than two year.i
agents of the BrUish government
have been looking for this acknowl
edged ieader of the ' Irish army,
which, though not definitely mobi
lized, is burning police barracks and
shooting British
hedges. Every policemaan and offi
cer in Ireland cariies Collins' photo
graph and description and has orders
to arrest hi(m at sight on the charge
of directing! assassinations. They
can't get near him. Yet over to Dub
lin goes Carl Akerman, correspond
ent of an enterprising Philadelphia
newspaper, and secures a two-hour
interview with this very genuine
celebrity It sounds like an authori
tative interview, too; one containing
statements of pocy which Lloyd
George's governmen might like to
get hold of. Ackerman, of course,
started with some advantages which
the agents of Scotland Yard aon't
have. He was personally known "to
some of "Mick's" friends as a chap
who could be trusted. That's always
ihe newspaperman's greatest asset
when he's on a difficult and danger
ous job. Lowell (Mass.) Courier-.
