DO THE RICH HAVE CON
TEMPT FOR THE POOR.
In the January "Woman's Home Com
panion Katherine Norris, writing a
serial story entitled "Uneducating
Mary," presents as her principal char
acter a young married woman, named
Mary Constable, who when, she was j
mob maiiiuu to iiu au.u. xxv o:iu j.o
poor. In the following extract she
tells how she used to look at poverty
when she was rich and how she looks
at it now that she is poor herself:
"Poverty but hadn't there always
seemed to be something wrong with
people who were always poor? Some
thing to criticize, something at which
to wonder, sopie quality to which one
felt superior? Mary's cheeks burned
sometimes when she remembered her
crisp criticisms of men "who allowed
their wives to go on year in and year
out without a servant.
"And she thought with a new un
derstanding and pity of those women
of her own old world, 'society women,'
who had struggled year out in year in
to maintain the pretense of financial
ease Women, thought Mary, who had
attempted sogallantly to replace with
witty conversation and daring innova
tion the luxuries to which their guests
were accustonied. And the guests, too
often, saw through, the pitiful little
prefetise and laughed at it, despised
it."
