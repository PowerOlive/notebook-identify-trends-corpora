FRITZ HELDTO GRAND JURYBOND ITXED AT $1,000 BY LOUISVTT.TYFi COURT REFERRED TOBY ATTORNEY AS 'TATRIOTICNUT WHO MADE MISTAKE."In Louisville, Tuesday afternoon,Dr. John Fritz, of Covington, whowas arrested last week by UnitedStates Marshal Workman, on affidavits charging him with unlawfullyrepresenting himself to be a United.States recruiting officer, and therebyobtaining money in various sums unlawfully, was, after trial beforeUnited States Commissioner John P.Haswell, held over in $750 bonds tothe October session of the FederalGrand Jury. Dr. Fritz was unableto secure a bondsman, and was remanded to the Jefferson County jail.The charge against Dr. Fritz wasbased on allegations that he has represented himself as an officer in theMedical Reserve Corps of the UnitedStates Army, and has collected sumsof money in various places in Kentucky while on a personally conducted recruiting tour. fLhe case for theGovernment was prosecuted by United States District .Attorney Millerand his assistant, S. Merrell RussellDr. Fritz was represented by Mr.Huggins and Robert Hagan.Eight witnesses were introducedfor the Government, and Dr. Fritztook the stand in his own behalf after Mr. Haswell had overruled a motion for dismissal on the part of Attorney Hagan, the Government rested upon the presentation of its case.United States District AttorneyThomas D. Slattery made affidavit onwhich a warrant was issued for Dr.John Fritz, charging him with impersonating an officer of the Medical Reserve Corps of the United Statesarmy. It is alleged that he procured$5 from Percy Reid, of Richmond,formerly of Paris, in that manner.Dr. Fritz's bond had been placedat ?1,000. When Attorney Hugginswas convinced that Mr. Haswellwould hold over his defendant on thetestimon3' introduced, he made an effort to have the bond reduced to apoint where Dr. Fritz could be released from jail instead of being heldin custody throughout the summer.It was in that connection that Mr.Huggins first made reference to hisclient as a "patriotic nut.""This great Government," he said"could do better than to hound apatriotic nut who Las, in zeal andenthusiasm, gone too far and madesome mistakes. The strong arm ofthe law, with its departments, secretservice and money, could be used toa better purpose to search out thosewho oppose the Government, ratherthan seek to stop this man who wasdoing a good work, although it is admitted he did go too far."Dr. Fritz testified that he is 32years old, and is a public speaker, afoot specialist, a former aeronaut,and occasionally a cabaret singer.He said he left Covington long ago,and "don't know where he hasn'ttouched since that time."Before coming to Kentucky, Dr.Fritz was active along similar linesin Texas and Oklahoma, and showedletters from many army, navy andmarine corps recruiting officerspraising his work.Dr. Fritz stated to the court thatof he was able to give bond he wouldcontinue his recruiting work."I realize I have made a mistake,though," he said, "and I will proceed differently the next time."tsa to toFARMERS SUPPLY COMPANY INNEW HOME.The Farmers Supply Company, forseveral years located in the cornerstoreroom in the Robneel Building,at Main and Eighth streets, has moved to their new home in the Anderson Building, adjoining the GrandOpera House.The new location is an ideal one,the building baving been just completed, and every detail being arranged for the special needs of theoccupants.

These young reprobates hadto be severely called down a fewdays ago by Chief of Police Link, andthreatened with being deprived ofthe bathing privileges altogether.They gather there and fill the airwith the vilest language theirtongues can give voice to. Some ofthem instead of having the requiredbathing suits, come there with an oldundershirt, which barely suffices toconceal their nakedness. They doeverything to show their innate devilishness. We cold name a dozendifferent offenses that would placethem, despite their youth, in jail,should they be caught in the act. Assoon as Chief Link left the scene thother day these boys resumed theiracts, even going to the extent of yelling the vilest insults to girls hastening across the East Paris bridge.It is true that we can find plentyof places to fish in besides the millpond, but common decency shouldprohibit these boys from showingtheir lack of good breeding by suchacts as those we complain of.A FISHERMAN.pQ F& pH -TO HLL OUT UNEXPIRED TEEM.At the meeting of the Board ofCouncil held in the Council Chamber,in the City Hall last night, Mr. Geo.Doyle, of the Peoples-Deposit Bank,was elected to fill out the unexpiredterm of the late Mr. Jack Woods, asCouncilman from the Third Wjard.Mr. Doyle is representative youngbuisness man, and will fill the offic-3with credit to himself and to thebusiness interests of his constituents.BELLS AND WHISTLESArouse Paris Residents ThnrsdaTNight Report Circulated ThatGerman Zeppelins WereSailing Over.j whistles told of the completion of thework of raising Bourbon's Red Croaaallotment.The renort trained -wide cJrr.nTatfrvnthroughout the city that GermZepplins were sailing over Paris.Others stated that there was an immense fire in progress in the sectionclose to the South Paris yards of theLouisville & Nashville.

Mothers never send usbills for their loving, unselfishnessfaithful services. Why?It's an easy answer. No man living has ever become wealthy enoughto repay the knidness and lovingcare bestowed upon him by his mother. He couldn't pay his mother's bill,if she presented it, with anything buthis undying devotion to her all herlife. He 'might possess millions andhe might even give her his last cent,but opposite it would have to be written: "Part payment on account."We can never hope to pay to paymother's bill. The best we can doeach day is to be credited with a bigshare of the love and sacrifices wecan make for her. Admiration forher, thoughtfulness for her welfareand comfort, and living the kind of alife her love would have us pursue,would go a little bit toward payingmothers' bills. But even all of thiscannot settle the score.Those Sidewalk Signs.Every now and then some fellowwith a shoe shining stand or a shooting gallery, or something of about asmuch importance gets hold of a bucket of gaudy paint or a pail of whitewash, and in the still hours of thenight, when "graveyards yawn andhell itself breathes forth contagionupon the world," proceeds to daubthe sidewalks of the city of Paris,Ky., with unattractive attempts atsign-painting.Naturally, -there isn't much in theway of scenery on the cold concretesidewalks of Paris, (Ky.) But smearing a lot of signs over them doesn'timprove their appearance any, nordo such signs serve to elevate thebuisness which the man who placedthem there seeks to advertise. Notown is so small these days but theyresent, to a great degree, such painful efforts as are produced by thesidewalk artists.The pavements of a city belongsto the city, and the individual whoattempts to use them to further hisown individual business should havehis attention called to the fact. Acircus would not think of smearingits hills all over the pavements ofthis city, on the city buildings, or onany public building yet it wouldhave just as much right to do so asanyone lias to use other city property, the sidewalks for instance, topromote an advertising campaign.When the greatest advertising medium the world has ever knownthe newspaper fails to draw business, use handbills or window lithographs. When they lose their pulling power try the billboards. If thatfails to secure results try as a lastresort a house-to-house circularizing.It none of them have the desired effect, then quit advertising, for thebusiness that has to be advertised inany other way isn't worth advertising.Anywhere you may be on this sideof the great big globe called theearth, it will be an honor to let people know you are from Paris, Bourbon county, Kentucky, but you canmake it still stronger by letting themknow we raised the limit on that$15,000 Red Cross fund and went it$1,500 better, and then some.fca fsSCIENCE REDUCES DEATH RATEOF TUBERCULOSIS.A reduction of more than 25 percent, in the death rate from tuberculosis in the ten years that the scientic treatment has been followed,whose value has been prove'd by experience, indicates that in time man'smost insatiable enemy may be destroyed or rendered practically harmless.The treatment provides for very little medicine and that must be takenonly on the prescription of a physician pure air, plenty of sunlight, nodissipation, nourishing food, cleanliness, and rest.

The artificial milkis made from peanuts, soy beans,sugar, water and mineral ' salt3.About 400 grains of potassium phos-lphate is dissolved in 200 pints of wa-ter at 176 degrees Fahernheit.Enough sugar is added to give 4.5per cent, to the finished product.Forty pounds of meal prepared fromthe nuts and beans is stirred in.The solution is boiled in a steam-jacketed pan; then it is subjected tothe operation of a vacuum pan, andlastly it ds treated with the cultureof lactic bacteria until the requiredacidity is obtained. After it is pasteurized and cooled a small percentage of citric acid is. added.The milk thus produced., may Tie-.condensed and. sold, in, cans, or .driedand powdered, ;or sold as a liquid in.bottles.

The struggle againsttuberculosis and trachoma, and thefight to lower a high infant motalityrate are the greatest problems confronting the Indian office. Supplementing work of regular agency doctors, special physicians at intervalsvisit the reservations, performing eyeoperations, caring for defective teethand spreading information.Already trachoma has been v.erylargely subdued In the schools. Theunhealthy manner of living thatmarks the period of transition between the old life and the new is fastpassing. Personal cleanliness andcommunity sanitation are taught, anda demand for regular living, cleanclothes, fresh air and pure water isencouraged. Building of sanitaryhomes is urged, and the value ofclean food and cooking utensils emphasized. As a result there has beena Very noticeable falling off in tuberculosis. The younger generation now knowsthat a sturdy child grows into asturdy man, and great care is takenof the young mother in childbirth.Before the present administrationassumed control, thTee-flfths of thelittle Indians died before they werefive years old. Introduction and enforcement of modern methods has reduced this appalling percentage, andthe health of the Indian is now, as awhole, far better than at any othertime since he came under the influence of the white man.There are moments when we feelquite sure that a lot of people nowworrying about the burden of taxation will b the rery last to feel It;Report of the Condition ofThe Farmers and Traders Bankdoing business at the town of Paris,County of Bourbon, State of Kentucky, at the close of business on 20day of June, 1917.RESOURCES.Loans and Discounts . . .$193,508.80Overdrafts, secured andunsecured 1,784.56Stocks, Bonds andother Securities 11,570.00Due from Banks 24,070.18Cash on hand 9,784.40Checks and othercash items 1,048.65Banking House, Furniture and Fixtures. . . . 2,400.00Other Assets not includedunder any of aboveheads 2,315.93$246,482.58LIABILITIESCapital Stock paid in,in cash $ 60,000.00Surplus Fund 2,500.00Undivided Profits, lessexpenses and taxespaid 7,087.64Depositssubjectto check $144,393.90DemandCertificatesof Deposit 1,000.00TimeDeposits . 30,116.49 175,510.39Due Banks and TrustCompanies 1,384.55?246,482.5SSTATE OF KENTUCKY,County of Bourbon Set.We, Frank P.

The play of the needleshas heen accompanied by the hum ofconversation, but neither interferedwith the other, and the garments onwhich the ladies were working grewin shape and form until finished.The rooms were given their initialuse Monday when the members ofJemima Johnson Chapter, Daughtersof the Revolution, spent a busy daysewing for the Red Cross work. Asa result of the swift plying of needlesa large supply of useful garmentswere checked up to their credit whenthe day had ended. On Tuesday theladies of the Baptist church tookpossession of the rooms and the samescene was enacted.Thirteen suits of pajamas andeighteen hospital gowns were fashioned by the nimble fingers of theworkers at the rooms Wednesday,that being the day allotted to the women of the Pastors Aid Society of thePresbyterian church. Yesterday thewomen of the Christian church occupied the room, and the same programwas observed. The ladies were busyall the day, and finished a largeamount of work for the Red Crosssupplies department. To-day therooms will be occupied by the ladlesof the Catholic church.The rooms are well equipped forthe purpose, being fitted up with machines, chairs, sewing tables andother accessories which tend to makethe work easier. Electric fans andice water contribute to the comfortof the workers. Coffee is served atnoon, but the workers provide theirown lunch.The little folks are not being deprived of an opportunity of showingthat they, as well as their elders,are patriotic, and willing to do theirlittle bit. A new department of theRed Cross work, comprising girls under fourteen years of age, has beenorganized, under the direction of Mrs.Frederick A. Wallis. They held theirfirst meeting at the home of Mr. andMrs. Thomas Henry Clay, Sr., Saturday; and took up the work of cuttingscraps of cloth Into small bits forthe purpose of filling fracture pillowsand drainage pads for the Red Crosswork. They were given the name of"The Snippers," suggestive of thecharacter of the work they have undertaken. The little ones enteredinto the spirit of the work just asenthusiastically as have their oldersisters in the Red Cross, and theyintend to keep it up.

FRANK.Directors.MUTTON AND WOOL.(New York Commercial.)Mutton, once the cheapest, has become the dearest meat in the market. The explanation is simple. Thewool on a sheep's back this spring isworth more than a similar sheepcould be sold for years ago.Sheep could be bought on theRocky Monutain range for $3.50 to$4 a head a few years ago. The average weight of a Western fleece "inthe grease" is seven pounds, andsuch wool now sells for 50 to 65 centsa pound, as compared with 18 to 25cents a pound in past years whenthe scoured price in Boston was nomore than the raw price at Westernpoints to-day.Counting the wool and the increase of the flocks, a band of sheepon the range represents an investment yielding 100 per cent, a yearcompound interest. A "band" ofsheep of 2,000 head worth $10,000before the war on the open range, ifproperly handled, would have increased to 10,000 head or more inthree years and the wool would havepaid all expenses and 10 to 20 percent, on the investment, barring accidents. It is not strange that sheepraisers do not press sheep and lambson the market when they "grow intomoney" so fast.m I 11B-4 FIREInsure withW.O.HINTON &SON,Agts1 mi 1HRE AT WINCHESTER.Fire which originated in the storeof the French Hardware CompanyTuesday night caused several hundred dollars damage.

It remains to be seen whether the publicis more more appreciative than thePostofiice officials.Heretofore the representatives ofthe people in Congress have rejectedthe proposition of the Postofiice Department to make it unprofitable forthe newspaper to use -the PostofiiceDepartment at all. If they succeedin this, there will be less businessimposed on the men now prostratedunder the burden of an eight-hourday, one month holiday, numeroussick leaves with substitutes, and alife tenure of office.The press is entitled to the thanksof the Navy Department and the WarDepartment in connection with therecruiting of the army and navy during the past sixty days. The presshas received no thanks of any kindfrom these two departments; but itwill continue the work of expoundingthe principles upon which these twoarms of the service are organized; ofexplaining the honor that comes tomen who enlist voluntarily in thesebranches of the public service; ofprotecting these recruits from imposition from any quarter, and of honoring them at all times for theirachievements.These are but a few of the many'services rendered by the press as adirect representative of the people tothe government created by the people, paid by the people, directed bythe people and existing only by theconsent of the people.It was Jefferson who said: "Wereit left to me to decide whether weshould have a government withoutnewspapers, or newspapers without"a government, I should not hesitatea moment to prefer the latter." Today it is the press that expounds tothe taxpayers the new tax laws andthe principles which the framers ofthe laws have ignored or violated.It is the press that reconciles the taxpayers to the burdens that warmakes necessary; reconciles them tothe taxes essential to the conduct ofgovernment. It is the press thatwithout compensation, informs thetaxpayer when his taxes are due,when his returns are due, how hecan make his returns with the leastannoyance to himself or the agents ofthe government.

The numbers will be forwardedto Washington and the drawing willbe entirely by number. The identityof the numbered men will be unknown to those in charge of thedraft machinery and can be established only by comparing a numberwith a printed list in the man'shome district.As the numbers are drawn, theywill be telegraphed to the home districts where the registered men willlearn if they have been drafted.Then the question of exemptionswill come up, and this will go beforethe local Boards. If a man is exempted the man bearing the numberwhich was drawn next in order willtake his place and so on.In this way all those available forservice out of the ten million whoregistered will be made ready for thecountry's call, and from them thefirst increment of 625,000 will be assembled.

Pa pa paWATER FUEL FOR AUTOS.Recently an inventor attractedconsiderable attention by claimingto have isolated a certain greenchemical the addition of which towater would make a substitute forgasoline in internal combustian engines. Now comes another inventorwith a process for utilizing wateras an automobile fuel, and his process has the merit that he is willingto explain it, and that his theory atleast is apparently well grounded.He points to the well-known fastthat water is decomposed into its elements, hydrogen and oxygen, whena current of electricity passes throughit. Hydrogen mixed with air ismore explosive than gasoline vapor.In his patented device the inventorwould convert part of the powergenerated by the automobile engineinto electrical energy, which h?,would use to decompose water. Thehydrogen of the decomposed waterhe proposes to use to run teh engine,securing enough surplus power in thecycle to drive the car.Es Pa paTHINGS TO WORRY ABOUT.Maybe some of the experts who areworking on war inventions could bepersuaded to turn their attention toward perfecting a device that will prevent weeds growing four times as fastas garden truck.

G.Allen's past life we failed to mentionthat at the time he was made cashier.of the Millersburg Deposit Bank, after the death of his predecessor, Dr.A. G. Stitt, the business was operated in a small building on the northeast corner of Sixth and Mainstreets, which was originally built byDr. Stitt as an office. The, same lotis now occupied by the handsome!home of Dr. J. D. Calhoun. Dr. Stittconducted the Depoalt Bank here formore than twenty years. When Mr.Allen was made, cashier he went outfor business, and in a short time thislittle unsightly building was inadaquate for the new l.usiness he hadcreated.The bank was then moved to theproperty of the I. O. 0. F. Lodge, nowoccupied by the Hurst Home Insurance office. This building was remodeled and fitted up with neat furniture for the purpose and wasthought adequate for the needs of the"bank. After the Deposit Bank wentout of business and the FarmersBank created, of which Mr. Allenwas president, about 1909, the bankdesired to own a building of theirown. They purchased the propertyrom the heirs of the late Mrs. AddieSmiih, which at the time was partlyoccupied by the postoffice. The building was practically rebuilt, the postoffice was moved from the cornerrooms to rooms south of it, and thecorner room with convenient directors' room, was remodeled with handsome finishing, which made the bankone of the nicest, most convenientbank buildings in Central Kentucky.The bank remodeled the entire building, which is their property. TheBourbon Home Telephone Companyoccupies the entire second floor.All of these changes were due tothe untiring efforts of Mr. J. G.Allen, who did everything well. Heentered into every enterprise withhis whole soul and never undertookanything in which he failed in hisaccomplishment. He has been thebenefactor in many ways of morepeople than perhaps any one man inCentral Kentucky. One of the joysof his life was to serve others, and todo what he could for their good. Thishe practiced from the time he entered public life to his death. His placewill be hard to fill.igt Rs ISMATRIMONIAL.PHILLIPS COPE.Clara H. Phillips, of Lex-Mrsington, and Mr. W. N.

Epstein, of New York, readbefore the section on the practice ofmedicine of the American MedicalAssociation at the Hotel Biltmorerecently. Dr. Epstein's rather revolutionary methods of treating thedisease were received with deep interest. Dr. Epstein voiced the beliefthat Bright's disease was not primarily an affection of the kidneys, but,from his experience with 193 cases,he believed that the disease represented a general constitutional disturbance due to changes in theblood.He reversed many of the old treatments for Bright's disease. Insteadof limiting the amount of proteinconsumed by the patient he administered a high portein diet with beneficial results, the object being primarily to overcome the bad conditionof the blood. He said that no evidence is possessed by physiciansshowing that portein food is deleterious to the kidneys. He then told ofusing blood transfusion to improvethe condition of the blood of thepatient.12X la feSTORAGE PLANTS FULL.A statement saying every available cold storage place in New Yorkis full to capacity, and chargingthat retailers are maintaining highprices in spite of abundance of food,has been issued by Joseph Hartigan,Commissioner of Weights and Measures.
