Genealogy Of The Bedford Family
The News to day reprints in part the
genealogy of the Bedford family of
Bourbon county This history was
carefully gathered and verified by Mrs
Mary Rogers Clay the famous gene
alogist who Ijas achieved wide renown
by her great work in editing the
Genealogical Department published
every Sunday in the Louiaville Courier
Journal The preparation of this ex
tended history the balance of which
will appear in The News of Feb 4th
involved a vast amount of painstaking
research made by Mrs Clay who de
serves substantial reward at the hands
of the numerous connection who are
justly proud of their noble lineage thus
established beyond contradiction -
Stephen Bedford of Southam parish
Cumberland county Va made his will
March 25 1758 The witnesses were
Robert M Laurrin Richard Ligou
foseph Harris and Charles Clarke
Execuors My loving wife Elizabeth
probably daughter of Benjamin Mos
by and sister of Littleberry Mosby Sr
my friend Col George Carrington my

his children
I Sarah Mosby to whom he leaves
negroes and personal property
II Mandlin Mosby to whom he
leaves negroes and personal property
III Thomas Bedford to whom he
leaves negroes and lands in Lunenburgh
county
IV Stephen Bedford negroes and
lands on Twittys creek Lunenburgh
county
V Benjamin Bedford negroes and
lands in Cumberland county on Little
Deep creek
This will was probared August 20
1758 Stephen Bedford was justice of
GoDchland in 1741
The will of Thomas Bedford Char
lotte county was made February 3
1785 and probated March 7 1785 Exec
utors my dear wife Drucilla my
sons Thomas and Stephen arid my son-in-law
James Hamlett Securities
Andrew Hannah James Buuldin
Joseph Fuqua Jr Edward Almond
and Robert Bedford His heirs were
his faithful and beloved wife Drucilla
to whom he leaves his mansion house
and dwelling plantation and seven
slaves and a third of his personalty and
half the toll of his grist mill her chair
and a good jarriage horse etc The

of James Hamlett iv Martha wife ol
Charles Crenshaw v Thomas Bedford
vi Susanna wife of Anthony Walker
vii Benjamin Bedford viii John Bed
ford ix Anne Bedford x Littleberry
xi Archibald Bedford xii Jenny T
Bedford xiii Peggy Bedford xiv
Charles Wesley Bedford He left a
large estate of lands and slaves and
like his father gave much the largei
part of it to his sons After her father
death Anne Bedford married Archi
bald Mosely probably son of Hillarj
Mosely The courts of Lunenburgh
can confirm much tradition Left
seventy negroes and a large landed
estate He left his lands in the back
country Kentucky to his sons Ben
jamin and John and directs that hu
son Thomas shall pay to each of them
but of his own legacy 75 current
money as an assistance to them in mov
ing and settling in the back countrj
Kentucky Left all his lands to hiVl
sons and to each an equal division ol
his slaves Thomas Bedford as a
member of the Committee of Safetj
for Charlotte county Va aDpointed
January 13 1775 hence is a Revolu
tionary ancestor See Va Mag Oc
tober 1896
His three sons Benjamin Littleber
ry and Archibald married Tabitha
Mattie and Letty Clay three daugh
ters of Dr Henry Clay who settled in
what is now the Clintonville precinct of
Bourbon county in 1787 Their broth
er Thomas Bedford married Annie
Anne Robertson and moved to the vi
cinity of Nashville Tenn He was a
soldier probably a captain of the Rev
olution
Thos Bedford Sr was ill of some
disease raging in his family and among
his negroes and feared several others
besides himself would die of it when
he made his will Tradition says he
was twice married There is n6t an
item in his will to confirm the fact
The records of Lunenburg Bedford
Cumberland and Charlotte counties
might give the descendants much in
formation I give the names of the
children in the order in which they are
named in his will It is claimed that
Jane Margaret and Charles are the
children of the wife who was a Miss
Spencer If so then his last wife was
Drucilla Spencer for these are his
youngesc children aud unmarried at
the time of their fathers death If
this be true then the first eleven chil
dren were by the first wife who was
Mary Coleman The name Coleman
descends in the Kentucky branch I
find in the record of Revolutionary
service of Thomas Bedford Jr who in
November 25 1795 prays the Assem
bly to instruct the Auditor to issue him
a duplicate of a military certificate for
the sum of fifty eight pounds eight
shillings and five pence which he hath
accidentally lost A Thomas BecLord
