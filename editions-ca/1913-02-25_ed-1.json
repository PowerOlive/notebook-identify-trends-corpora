BUYING A CAR
IS AFINE ART
But Public is Learning Steadily
to Fit Purchase to Per
sonal Needs.
DUCHESSE AN EXAMPLE.
Former Anna Gould Buys a Ligh'f
Studebaker For Own Use.
Even in'NewYork, where, accord
inj5 to poDular belief, life cotre3 near'
being a money spending maratnon, au
tomobile buyers are 'learning that
size and class are not intercnangeable
terms. Light cars of popular price
and moderate appetite can be just as
graceful in outline, just as carefully
built, and just as comfortable, jas the
infinitely larger and heavier annihila
tors ot SDace, gasoline and .tires.
In cases where smartness of hand
ling and limited turning space are at
a premium, the Jight" cars enjoy a
great advantage. In the hands of a
skilled pilot it darts in and out of
traffic as a torpedo boat maneuvers
througn a fleet of battleshins.
More highly standardized than its
corpulent brother and with fewer
necessary adjustments the light car
is less prone to .become crippled and
easier to repair when accident han
pens. Women find it easier to drive
light cars. A woman at the wheel of
a road locomotive is an unusual sights
driving a light car the woman pilot is
so often met as to aiouse no especial
comment.
Suiting the car to the buyer's per
sonal need is an art which permits a
hia'a degree of discrimination.
The Duciiesse de Talleyrand, better
known to the American nublic as the
one time Anna Gould, present in Amer
ica in attendance on the wedding of
her sister, Helen Gould, to Finlev J.
Shepard. went shopping for an auto
mohiie for her personal use. The
Duchesse is an accomplished motorist
and had a definite idea of the qualities
she wanted in a car. She spent
nearly an hour in the salesroom of the
New York Studebaker branch and
thoroughly inspected the mechanism
of a Studebaker "25" enclosed road
ster, which she finally nurchased, and
is now driving.
The Duchesse was especially struck
with the cozy protection afforded by
the side curuins. which, in this type
of car, swing with the doors, giving
the weathei proof advantages of a
coupe with the option of changing the
car, at any time," into an open roadster
of conventional lines. That such a
combination should be exclusively the
property of an American builder of
light, popular priced cars appealed to
the Duchesse as novel and entertain
ing. She has laken the car back to her
home .' in France, with the idea of
using it in her personaL trina through
her great estate.
THEATRICAL.
"SMART SET."
It is said Jovers of good music should
not fail to see "The Smart Set" Com
pany in "The Darktown Politician,"
which is to be at the Pans grand for
one night, Mcndav, March 3. Twenty
five song hits will be introduced and a
dozen exclusive novelties by a clever
chorus. Salem Tutt Whitney appears
in the title role, and the sunporimg
past includes Homer Tutt andBlanche
Thompson, besides almost two score of
performers tlat are difficult to excel.
The production in its entirety is most
pretentious and is said to aDneal esDe
cially to those who desire "all that is
best and up to date in musical comedy.
Transferrred to Georgetown.
Mr. A. H. Wheeler, in charge ot the
construction department at the local
office of the Cumberland Telephone
and Telegraph Co., has been trans
ferred to Georgetown, and moved to,
that city Thursday. Mrs. Wheeler,
who is at present" in the ;Good Samar
itan Hospital in Lexington recovering
from an operation, will be able to join
her husband in about two weeks.
Purchase Small Land Tracts.
W. H. Whaley andLeslie Wheeler
purchased Saturaav f William Talbott 7
two tracts of lanflbn the Ruddles Mills
road, containing seventy-five acres.
The price paid was 580 per acre.
Mr. Farmer, Read.
Don't,, whatever you do, miss having a
look at our complete line of harness
before ou buy. If you do you will be
sorry,, for you will not only lose money
but will miss 'getting the very best
harness that money will buy. Come '
in and look is all we ask.
25 4t LAVIN & CONNELL.
Heirs Drop Contest Suit.

Nicholas Circuit Court, by agreement
of the parties, whereby the will of

churches of Carlisle and Millersburg,
