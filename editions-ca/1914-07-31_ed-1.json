He explained at length why 3the

He"' referred to the fact that .while

He answered to the satisfaction of
the entire audience every charge Mr.

Conservative citizens are quick to
admit that no political speech ever
made in Paris was more elegantly de-
"livered, more , compact and to the

speech was absolutely devoid of abuse

Governor Beckham was given a
most-cordial reception by the Demo
crats of Bourbon County. It has been
a long time since "a real political
speech has" been heard in Paris, and
the Democrats availed themselves of
this opportunity to the very fullest.
A large unmber of ladies heard the
speech and were, deligh'ted to hear a
public -map.' deliver a political speech
sb choice and elegant in language and
so free from the abuse and objecion
able language heard sometimes at
such gatherings. "",
Gov. Beckham was greatly pleased
with Jiis. reception and with his audi
ence in Paris. He was shown every
courtesy and appreciates the univer
sal kindness and consideration shown
him. His speech made himmany new
friends,1 and it is now the concensus
of opinion .that he will carry Bourbon

A press dispatch from Fort Smith,

stars to guide them twenty-three
companions carried Johnston Young,
27, of Mt. Sterling, Ky., member of a
force of G6vernment engineers sur
veying Indian lands in McCurtain
county, Oklahoma, on a stretcher -over
twenty-five miles of wild mountainous
country in a race against death.
The party arrived at Hatfield, Ark.,
the nearest railroad station, three
minutes before the arrival of a train
that brought 'Young, suffering with
tvDhoid fever, to a local hospital.
From peak to peak the party hurried
a,lpng the route: fording three rushing
mountain streams before Hatfield was
reached. Young, ill for thirty-one
days, had a fever of 104 when the
trip began at 5:30 o'clock Monday
night;, when he reached Hatfield after
passing through a stage of- delirium
and unconsciousness his fever drop
ped to 100. He regained conscious
ness toward the end of the rough
mountain journey, which he negotiat
ed in relays, -and physicians say he
will recover. The party passed,
through the Kiamichi and Mountain
Fork Mountains, the wildest parts of
Oklahoma and Arkansas, and for half
a mils the trail led along a precipice
on which a mistep would have plung
ed the party to a horrible death."
Mr. . Young is well-known here,
where 'he has frequently attended the
social functions given by the various
dancing clubs at the Elks' Hall.

Judge Ben Lindsey, of Denver, has
just returned from his first visit to
Newport, 1. I. Aslced for his impres
sions, he said: "Will you say that
any one of the young society girls in
Newport is one iota better than the
poor shopgirl who was convicted the
other day for stealing $15? That girl
had a whole familyto support on $6 a
week. What' does the Newport girl.
do? There is nothing she needs.
There is' no temptation she must
meet. There is this difference. The
shon erirl is in jail: she is a thief.
But remember one thing: Nobody is
bad; nobody is good. It is the pow-ersthe-tcircumstances
behind us that
are good or bad. I am told in New
port that one man there spends on
champagne alone $40,000 a year. If
that money were spent on reforming
juveniles, it would keep half a thous
and boys or girls out of jail. "Oh,
yes, J knowthey give there a great
many affairs for the benefit of char
ity," acknowledged Judge Lindsay,
"but this isdone just to palliate their
extravagance."
