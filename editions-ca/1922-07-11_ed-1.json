While visiting her sister at Co
lumbus, Georgia, the bride and her
future husband had their first meet
ing, Capt. Galloway then being sta
tioned in infantry service at Camp
Benning. . It was a case of love at
first sight, and the courtship pro
gressed until Miss Sugg, who was
one of the society buds of Hunts
ville, became Mrs. Galloway.
Capt. Galloway is a son of Mr.
and Mrs. Grant Galloway, and a
brother of Finnell Galloway, of the
buyers. The crop this season is re
ported as not up to the standard of
former years, and according to the
opinion of well-posted farmers the
yield will not average much more
than ten bushels to the acre.
Most of the corn will probably be
"laid by" in the next few days, and
a great deal of the crop has already
been given its last plowing. The
corn is in excellent condition and
making substantial progress. The
drought has had some effect on the
yield, however.
