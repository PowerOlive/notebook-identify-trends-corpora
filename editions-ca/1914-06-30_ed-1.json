HOT SIZZLERS FROM
BILLY SUNDAY'S BAT.
Billy Sunday in his sermons is
especially severe on the society wo
men who does not serve some useful
purpose. Pink teas immediately be
come unfashionable during one of
his revivals and bridge parties are
for the time forgotten. A feature of
his revivals is at least one sermon
during the series to women only.
Here are a few of the sizzlers that
Louisville women will hear when he
preaches to them in that city:
If you lay aside your prejudice,
you little frizzle-headed sissies, it
will help you so you won't make the
mistake your ma made.
There are married women who
shrink from maternity because they
love ease, fine garments and ability
ttq flit like a butterfly at some social
function.
There are too many girls who mar
ry for other causes than love.
Some girls marry a young buck to
reform, him, and they are the biggest
fools in the bunch, because hevould
not marry you to reform you.
"""You can not work ior six dollars a
week and wear fine duds and be on
the square without having the people
suspicious.
I believe the time will come when
sexual hygiene will form a part of
the high shcool curriculum.
I believe a good woman is the best
thing this side of heaven and a bad
woman the worst this side of hell.
The average girl of to-day is turning
her home into a gambling shop and
a social beer and champagne drink
ing joint, and her society is made up
of poker-players, champagne, wine
and beer drinkers, grass widowers
and jilted jades and scandal-mongers.
The divorce laws ar damnable. I
am a Roman Catholic on divorce.
Don't let your actions advertise,
"Man Wanted Quick." That's the
surest way not to get a man. You
might get a thing with breeches on,
but he is no man.
For God's sake, on't transfer the
love that God gave you or bestow it
upon some brindle-nose pup or spitz.
The virtue of womanhood is the
rampeart wall of American civiliza
tion. Society that makes a distinction
between the man who does wrong
and the girl when she does wrong, is
beneath my notice. I would not spit
upon it.

When held up by five highwaymen,

improved by the removal of
the present wearing surface thereon
and by the construction of bitulithic
paving, or of creosoted wooden block
paving upon the present concrete foun
dation, the material to be used in the
improvement of said street to be de
termined and selected by the Council
upon receipt of bids. Said improve
ment shall be made in accordance
with the specifications for the materi
al to be selected as'hereinafter provid
ed, and the present concrete founda
tion shall be repaired or replaced
wherever necessary to place same in
proper condition for reception of the
paving.
Section 2. The said improvement
shall be done at the exclusive cost of
the City of Paris, and shall be paid for
in cash upon completion and accept
ance of the work.
Section 3. The specifications for bi
tulithic paving herein above referred
to are as follows:
SPECIFICATIONS FOR BITULITHIC
PAVING-.
The present wearing surface shall
be removed from the present con
crete foundation, and all material so
removed shall be deposited by the
contractor at the city quarry or at any
other points which may be selected
by the Mayor, such points, however,
to be no further distance from the
point of removal than the city quarry.
Upon the present concrete founda
tion shall then be laid the following
wearing surface:
Such wearing surface shall be com
posed of hard crushed stone, sand and
bituminous cement, and shall have
the thickness, when compressed, of
two inches.
In preparing the mineral aggregate
for the above wearing surface the fol
lowing method and apparatus shall be
used:
The several grades and sizes of
mineral aggregate shall be accurately
measured in proportions previously
determined by labaratory tests to
give the best results, that is, the most
dense mixture of mineral aggregate
and one having inherent stability,
heated in a rotary mechanical heater,
so designated as to keep each batch
by itself until heated and then pass
into a rotary mixer; or the varying

half inch. The difference in the width
of openings in successive sections
shall not exceed one-fourth inch in
sections having openings smaller than
one-half inch, and shall .not exceed
one half inch in sections having open
ings greater than one-half inch. The
several sizes of stone thus separated
by the screen sections shall pass into
a Dm containing sections or compart-
ments corresponding to the screen
sections. From these comDartments
the stone shall be drawn into a weigh
box resting on a multi-beam scale The
several sizes of mineral aggregate, af
ter being separately weighed and
measured as above, hall be dropped
into a twin pug or other approved
form or mixer. In the mixec bitu-
ent quantity to coat all particles and
fill such voids as remain unfilled by
the proportionment of the mineral ag
gregate. The aggregate shall be so
proportioned as to secure in the ag
gregate inherent stability, density
freedom from voids and resistance to
displacement, and a mixture which
when combined with the bitulithic ce
ment and compacted together will
form a bituminous street pavement
structure containing mixed mineral in
gredients of such grades as will give
the structure inherent stability, and
one in which the largest and smallest
piece are associated with each other
indiscriminately throughout the
structure, and in which the plastic bi
tuminous compositon permeates the
entire mass, uniting the various sized
particles thereof; filling the voids and
forming the wearing surface. If the
crushed stone does not contain
finely divided particles to fill the
small voids in the aggregate, the de
ficiency of these finely divided parti
cles shall be made up by the addition
of sand or other suitable fine mineral
matter.
The mineral aggregate shall be
heated and mixed with a bitulithic
cement at a temperature consistent
with good workmanship. The whole
mixture shall be hot enough when
reaching the street to be capable of
being spread and raked without dif
ficulty, and not so hot as to injure the
bitulithic cement. J
There shall be spread over the bi
tulithic surface mixture a seal coat,
using per square yard of bitulfthic
pavement approximately one-fourth
gallon of bitulithic cement, into which
shall be incorporated approxinately
twenty-five pounds of mineral aggre
gate not larger than one-quarter inch
diameter. After spreading the seal
coat, it shall be thoroughly rolled in
to the bitulithic surface mixture.
Each layer of the work shall be
kept as free as possible from dirt, so
that it will unite with the succeeding
layer.
The bituminous composition or ce
ment shall in each case be free from
water, and shall be especially refin
ed to remove volatile and other mat
ter susceptible to atmospheric influ
ences. Section 4. The specifications for

served or creosoted as hereinafter
specified, and each block shall contain
at least 20 pounds of creosote oil per
cubic foot of wood, or when a block
contains much natural pitch it shall
receive as much creosote as can be
be forced into it by the same process
and pressure as is used in the treat
ment of the blocks of the same kind
of wood which will receive 20 pounds
of creosote oil per cubic foot.
8. The creosote oil shall be a dead
oil of pure coal tar or wholly a pure
coal tar product. It shall not contain
more than three per cent, of water,
and if it does contain this amount of
water a corresponding correction
must be more than three per cent, of
of waer, and if it does contain
this amount of water corresponding
correction must be made so that an
equivalent additional amount of creo
sote is forced into the blocks. It shall
contain only traces of Acetic and
acetates. Its specific 'gravity at one
one hundred degrees (100 degrees) P.
(38 degrees Cent.) shall be at
least 1.05 and not more than
1.10 so as to assure it
thoroughly penetrating the wood
blocks. The residue insoluble
distillafiltration with benzol and chlo
roform must not exceed 3 per cent, of
the weight of the creosote oil. Frac
tional distillation of 100 grams of the
creosote oil shall produce of dry oil
by weight within the following limits:
Up to 150 degrees C. (302 degrees
F.), not to exceed 2 per cent.
Between 150 degrees C. (302 de
grees F. and 170 degrees C.) (338 de
grees F.), not to exceed 1.5 per cent
Between 170 degrees C. (338 degrees
F.) and 235 degrees C. (455 degrees
F.), not to exceed 35 per cent.
Between 235 degrees C. (455 degrees
F.) and 300 degrees C. (572 degrees
F.), not toexceed 35 per cent.
The -residue remaining shall be
soft and adhesive. The creosote oil
shall contain about 25 per cent, of
crytallirable napthalene and at least
15 per cent, anthracene oils. At least
95 per cent, of the creosote oil shall
be soluble in carbonbisulphide and
equally in absolute alcohol. The man
ner and metho'ds of testing creosote
oil shall be subject to the approval of
the City Engineer.
9. The wood blocks, after being cut
and ready for treatment, shall be
placed in a suiable iron receptacle or
cylinder and there sterilized with dry
steam undsr a pressure of at leas 30
pounds and not to exceed 50 pounds
per square inch during at least three
hours and as much longer, not to ex
ceed 7 hours, as the conditions of the
wood and the season of the year re
quires. The temperature within he
cylinder during he process the con
densed steam, sap and other liquid
matter shall be drawn from the recep
tacle by means of valves. At the
completion of the steaming process
all condensed steam and other fluid
matter shall be blown from the cylin
der through an opening in its bottom,
and the stream shall be caused to pass
out through an opening in the top.
10. The draining and exhaust
valves of the cylinder shall then be
closed and a vacuum pump shall im
mediately produce, as quickly as pos
sible, a vacuum of at least 24 inches
and as much more as may be neces
sary, and maintained in the cylinder
until moisture and gases cease to
come from the cylinder. During this
process the wood blocks within the
cylinder shall be kept hot by means
of steam coils within it.
11. Immediately thereafter and
while the vacuum exists, the creosote
oil at a temperature between 180 de
grees F. and 200 degrees F. shall be
run ino the cylinder and forced and
maintained under such pressure that
the wood blocks shall absorb and be
impregnated with creosote oil to the
amount required by Section 23 above.
The excess of creosote oil in the cyl
inder shall then be withdrawn, the
blocks drained and prepared for ship
ment. 12. The blocks ready for use must
meet the indentation test pressure
made as follows: The blocks to be
tested are first dried at 100 degrees F.
during 12 hours. Then a polished
steel die 1 inch square on its lower
face, square edges, corners and per
pendicular sides, is placed on a dried
block firmly supported in a compres
sion testing machine. A pressure of
8,000 pounds is applied quickly and
maintained exactly one minute. The
die must not descend and indent the
block more than one-eighth of an inch.
The measurements are to be taken
from when the die is lightly pressed
against the block to the instant the
8,000 pounds pressure has been ap
plied one minute. The die is placed
anywhere within one-half (Y2) inch of
the edges of the block and so as to
compress lengthwise the wood fibres.
13. The wood blocks shall be in
spected by the City Engineer at the
place of manufacture or on arrival in
the .city where they are to be used or
when piled adjacent to the street to be
paved. All blocks not in conformity
with the requirements of these speci
fications will be rejected and must be
removed from the locality of the pave
ment to be laid. .
14. The wood blocks are to be laid
upon the mortar bed immediately aft
er the bed is ready to receive them.
The blocks are to be laid wih close
joints and at flght angles to the curbs
except otherwise directed by the City
Engineer, and in uniform course, and
so that all longitudinal joints shall
be covered by a lap of at least three
(3) inches. No closure or end blocks
shall be used which are less than
three (3) inches long. The paving
blocks shall be jointed up to the car
tracks and rails as directed by the
City Engineer.
15. The blocks shall be laid in
slight contact, and shall be properly
rolled or rammed to a firm bearing
and uniform surface.
16. No rolling or ramming shall
be" done within ten feet of the surface
where blocks are being laid. All
blocks which are broken, split, or
otherwise damaged or defective or
displaced shall be removed immedi
ately after rolling or ramming and re
placed with sound blocks.
16. After the blocks have been
inirl and nronerlv rammed, their.
joints for a space of three feet wide
ariinp.ent. to and narallel with each !
curb shall be filled completely full of
hot bituminous cement filler as here-
Hinafter specified. All other joints be
tween the blocks shall first be filled
half full of said hot bituminous filler
Said filler shall be of a temperature to
flow quite freely and it shall be thor
oughly swept and rubbed into -said
joints with approved hand squeegees
until all the bituminous filler is clean
ed from the surface of the pavement"
The entire surface of the pevement
shall thereon be dressed bff and all
joints shall be completely filled -rui
fclenn, coarse perfectly dry sand and so
as to leave a unitorm layer thereof
one-half inch () inch thickness all
over the entire surface of the pave
ment. 17. Expansion joints shall be con
structed between the curbs and the
wood paving blocks to provide for the
possible expansion and contraction of
the blocks by heat or cold or other
wise. These expansion joints shall
be constructed from three-quarter
() inches wide, according to the
width of the street as directed by the
City Engineer, and shall extend the
whole depth ofthe blocks, and shall
be filled with aT suitable bituminous
paving- joint cement acceptable to the
City Engineer. Expansion joints of
any required width shall be construct
ed at such other locations as the City
Engineer may direct Expansion
joints must be completely filled with
suitable strips of wood previous to
filling the joints with the paving
joint cement The filler for the ex
pansion and all other joints shall be
regular Coal Tar Pitch or other ap
proved bituminous cement that the
City Engineer considers equally as
good. In absence of instructions to
the contrary, the pitch filler shall be
of straight coal tar run to a melting
point of 125 degrees 140 degrees F.,
carrying not less than 25 per cent, nor
more than 35 per cent of free carbon.
Brittle point to be 15 degress F.
