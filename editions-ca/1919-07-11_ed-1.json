"The Woman Thou Gavest Me"
A Paramount-Artcraf t Special
She loathed her husband! She loathed him because he was bad
"because his "double standard" of morality made his marriage vow a
farce.
Yet she was his "wife" sold to him by a vengeful father bound
to him by law until death should end her woes.
Then love, forbidden, come to her wedded her in her heart to an
lionest man, her mate. And the world a-nd the law cried "wanton!" and
oovered her with shame.
Based on Hall Caine's famous novel, directed by Hugh Ford, and
played by an all-star cast, including Katherine MacDonald, Thoedore

ORDINANCES BEING VIOLATED
Among numerous other ordinances
on the city's books is one prescribing
a certain penalty for tacking cards
or advertising matter on the tele
graph, telephone and fire alarm
poles in the city. Yet this is being
done every day. The poles are at
present being used for the purposes
to which billboards and deadwalls
are usually devoted. But, as between
friends, there seems to be no way to
stoy the practice. Perhaps if the
city and- companies would have the
poles neatly painted it would 2iave a
tendency to make the violators of the
ordinance ashamed to deface the
poles in the way that is being done
) now.
JOHN FOX, JR. AN ARPRECIA
TION. (Louisville Times.)
"Kentucky has lost the man who
might have been her chief historian.
So far, at least, he had been the lead
er of that school of novelists Who
sought to interpret the beauties and
the mysteries of the Blue Ridge sec
tion of the Commonwealth abound
ing in material for the story-teller,
as it abounds in potentialities of ma
terial wealth and resources of hu
man value. John Fox loved his
mountains and their quaint people;
and the mountains rewarded him
with the richness of a life that he
loved, w-hile the mountain people-bestowed
upon him in their turn that
confidence and trust that a primeval
people alone can feel and are so slow
to express.
"But though John Fox is gone
from among us, his work, like all
other good work, lives after him; and
what he taught the world of the
Kentucky mountains never can be
forgotten. His work has grown to
a great fruition to the advantage of
the simple ones he loved; and it is
now known that the mountains can
furnish more than feuds and assas
sinations, hatreds and prejudice.
Not alone the world of letters mourns
this man's death lie was far more
than a oovelist'; he was a great hu-mantarian."
