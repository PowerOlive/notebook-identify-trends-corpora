Andmost extraordinary, he is very happyover it.His gentle captor is a universitygirl. In April she is coming over, andthey will make their home in Paris,Ky. Already she boasts of being anAmerican citizen, although still in theeducational service of her nativecountry.The bride was Miss Elsie ElizabethSchwartzer. Since graduation fromthe University of Bonn, she has beena teacher. Her home is at Metternich. Coblenz. Sergeant Cook wasstationed at Coblenz for quite a period. It became imperative that helearn more German than he had atcommand, and he became a pupil ofMiss Schwartzer.The new vocabulary he learned evidently wasn't restricted to army affairs. He got interested way over inthe book, figuratively. No one butMrs. Cook knows the speeches he dugout in his quarters, but they wereeloquent enough to make an American of a daughter of Germany.Over there business and many professions follow the military principleof enlistment. She was enlisted asa teacher and must serve her "hitchjust like a soldier. Therefore, shecouldn't come back with- him. But,she's coming with the cherry blossomsand wars and armies are going to beforgotten in a new springtime. English is among several languages whichshe speakes fluently, and she willnot have the difficulties which besetsome who come.Mr. Cook talks most interestinglyof France and Germany as they appear after the war.' His corps followed the fighting lines closely during the conflict, and afterwards hehad occasion to make numerous tripsover the battletorn regions. Hesays that a transformation alreadyhas taken place in the restoration oftowns and the cultivation of landwhich was bared. In a general viewtoday, among the scars of war thepiles of stone and mortar which markwhere towns wholly were obliteratedand the shattered trunks of treesstand out.During a residence of two years inGermany, Mr. Cook says that he wasat all times courteously treated andobserved many evidences of amity.Among observations which will beof peculiar interest in Bourbonwhere no Bourbon remainswas that all 67 varities of Kentucky whisky are to be seen in showwindow ricks, and the price range inGermany cities is 75 cents to $1.50just like it was when he left Kentucky and joined the army nine eventful years ago. Mr. Cook is visitinghis father, Thomas H.

Coincident with the death of"Devil Anse" Hatfield, leader of theHatfield-McCoy feud, comes the report that the "Hangman's Tree," amonument to the old days, has succumbed to the ravages of tijme. The"Hangsman's Tree" is on the DixiHighwaj-. It has stood for centuries.Its one large and straight limb,well foliage d in the pioneer days,sheltered Boone ana his band of adventuiers. In the days immediatelyfollowing the Civil War the grewsome suggestiveness of tbis monarchof the forest came to be identifierwith scenes and happenings rearvin keeping with its name. Certainclans had this place as their rendezvous; new members while thepale (moon trickled through the foliage laid their hands on the standard and solemnly swore allegiance.And U is held that in the darknessof the night shrieks and groans andpleadings for mercy often wereheard to mingle themselves with thesoughing of the pines and rockingof the vast oaks.But years have gone by since lawand order were established by meansof force in these Kentucky hills andvalleys.

He has spent tenyears collecting conceret facts on thepyramiding of American wealth. .Mr. Klein's attention was called tothe recent statement of George P.Hampton, managing director of theFarmers' National Council, that thirty-threeindividuals own 2 per centof the entire American nationalwealth. He estimated this 2 per centat about $4,837,000,000. Mr. Hampton gave no names, but the followinglist of individuals and estates and thevast holdings, checked up to a recentdate, was given by Mr. Klein:J. D. and William Rockefeller, 3 to5 billions; Pratt family, $400,000,000; Harkness, $400,000,000; Carnegie, $300,000,000; Weyerhauser estate, $300,000,000; Vanderbilts,$300,000,000; Astors, $300,000,000;Payne Whitney family, $200,000,000;Frick estate, $150,000,000; Goelets,$100,000,000; J.

C. James family, $60.000,000; Cleveland Dodge, $60,000.000,000; Pullman estate, $50,000,000. Concentration In Last Stage.There are many families, Mr. Kleinmentioned, in the $40,000,000 classand this includes Mrs. William Leeds,now Princess Christopher, of Greeceand Alexander Smith Cochrane, untilrecently America's "richest bachelor," and now the husband of MmeGanna Walska, opera singer.Mr. Klein's list, which is severalpages long, does not go below the$10,000,000 class.He has compiled these figures anddata on those "who own America" topoint out the danger of the concentration of wealth in the United Statesthe evils of tax-exempt securitiecwhich are heavily held by the bi?estates, and in advocacy of a constitutional amendment for the limitationof private fortunes. Mr. Klein pointedout that most of the Rockefeller institutions are supported by wealth invested in tax-exempt securties, "and''he added, "they haven't spent whatthey have saved in taxation.""The concentration of wealth irthe United States," the deputy commissioner declared, "has reached thelast stage. It will be very dangeroucto permit it to go further. The economic structure is top heavy and it carnot be cured by any wild-eyedtheories of Socialism or BolshevismThe top must be sliced off; it mustbe made to stand the burden of governmental expense.Expects Industrial Serfdom."Colonel House at the peace conference proposed a capital tax onwealth throughout the world to payfor the war, but his suggestion neverreceived much publicity. I talkedwith him about the matter. Something along this line must be done tobring the "world situation back tonormal. Under the present systemEurope can not pay her debts. Theonly remedy I see is for the governments, with the United States pointing the way, to limit the amount ofprivate fortunes, taking the excess,thus regulating monopolies and fixing the prices on all commodities. Alltaxes will be reduced. Private "initiative will not be crushed by such aprogram, because no one man will beable to become richer than any other."My figures, which I will publishwithin this year, will show the varieddanger of undestricted wealth accumulation. Private monopoly fromwhich these riches take their originis no longer tolerable or excusable inthis country. It has run its coursejust like other economic systems. Theonly alternative to private monopolyis public monopoly, and the only safeway to obtain that is to limit what theindividual can have and transfer thesurplus back to the nation. Otherwise, with this wealth accumulationproceeding and it is getting worseeach year we will have industrialand political serfdom."Taking Mr. Rockefeller income,for inttance, has not reduced hiPounds"At the time I began taking Tanlac I only weighed eighty-tourpounds, but now I weigh a hundredand seventeen," said Mrs. J. E.Donovan, of 813 Temple street, Hinton, W. Va."For more than a year before Ibegan taking Tanlac I suffered untold Dgoines from indigestion afterevery meal. I went for days at alime without eating anything, buthad constant pains In my stomachwhether I ate or not. I fell off to al-jmost a living skeleton, and for fourmonths lived on nothing but breadand milk and had to spend almcstall that time in bed.. -'I sought relief 4n every direction,but it was all in vain until I gotTanlac.

He first entered PolandIn 1915, a few months after .the German occupation. His report of starvation, disease and suffering that existed at that time is one of the mostharrowing documents In the recordsof American relief work overseas.Dr. Kellogg made the followingstatement regarding the work after thearmistice :"With Warsaw as our headquarters,we began operations in Poland in January, 1919, and within a few weeksthere was established a steady importation of food into that country. Tonsand tons of it came from overseasthrough the Port of Danzig."It was impossible to do all thatthe administration wanted to do, because the need of Poland was too great,but it was agreed that enough foodshould be sent to Poland to care forthe four million people until the greatagricultural districts could again provide for them."But in addition to these four million people who so pressingly neededrelief, there was another call for relieffrom a source that could not be resisted : the children ofthe land. Manyof these were orphans, hungry, emaciated, destitute and diseased. So theAmerican Relief Administration addedto its work by instituting a system offeeding these children. In a fewmonths a million and a quarter Polishchildren were getting a free meal every day of special food prepared tocounteract the effects of their previousundernourishment."To finsh the job eight great organizations have united under the nameof the European Relief Council to raisethe funds necessary to care for thefood needs and the medical needs ofthe 3,500,000 children of Eastern andCentral Europe. These organizationsare the American Relief Adminlstration, the American Red Cross, theAmerican Friends Service Committee(Quakers), the Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, the Federal Council ofthe Churches of Christ In Am prim, thaKnights of Columbus, the Y.

They have beenserving under the American Relief administration and have conducted foodkitchens and distributing stations inall parts of Poland outside Warsaw.In all the relief work being done InEurope, that of the Polish Grays, hasbeen unique because all the girls,though sent from America, were eitherborn in Poland or are of Polish parentage. When the need for social service in their country became acutemany girls of Polish descent answeredthe call of the Young Women's Christian Association for overseas serviceand enlisted in the preliminary training course that was given in severalcities of the United States. From thisgroup thirty girls were chosen and sentto Poland where, since 1918, they havebeen caring for the children of thecountry. The distribution of clothinghas taken them into, all parts ofPoland.They are now spending their entiretime In arranging for the feeding ofchildren this winter. Groups of themtravel to strategic centers In outlyingdistricts where they set up distributingstations, receive supplies, preparemeals, arrange for impartial distribution and train helpers to continue thework when they are sent on to the nexttown.COLUMBUS KNIGHTSAID CHILD APPEALJames A.

The Scientific American gives the following instructionsas to how to avoid this difficulty:Keep the mount flat and with asmall wad of cotton wetted In cleanwater, slightly dampen the approximate area to be covered by the printCover the back of the print with pastepreferably arabol smooth and thin.Apply the print to the mount, andwith aid of a paper blotter and asmall roller smooth the print from itscenter outward. No paste will appearoutside the limits of the print; anydampness exceeding these limits willevaporate. Any paper shreds left bythe blotter, etc., may be wiped cleanfrom the print's surface with the same Adamp wad of cotton.Testing Strength of Concrete.As the strength of a concrete mixture is much affected by the amountof water contained, the novel apparatus of the United States bureau ofstandards is designed to give an accurate test of the fluidity of flow. Acircular table-top mounted on a plunger is raised and dropped half an inchby a cam on the shaft of a handcrank. A sample of the mixture, molded into a truncated cone 6 inches tall,and 8 to 12 inches In diameter, Isplaced in the center of the table, andthe crank Is given 15 revolutions. Theaverage diameter to which the sample is spread out Is divided by theoriginal diameter and multiplied by100. The result is the flowability number -150 indicating a strong materialfor bricks, and 225 one suitable forreinforced concrete.Matter of Taste.Overheard at "The Mikado."He I don't think much of this show.It isn't as good as "Listen, Lester."SheBut it's not the same kind ofshow.He I know it But it hasn't anycatchy tunes.Adversity Sweetened.When a fat woman meets anotherwoman who is fatter than she is shebegins to notice the sun is shiningand that it is a pretty day.
