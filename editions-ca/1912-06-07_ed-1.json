vited and were to keep it a .secret un
til they arrived at the home. Mr. Cray
returned fromPavis on the noon train,
but the two ladies who were working
the surprise, through the help of
friends, managed to keep him on the
street the greater part of the after
noon, thereby keeping down any
suspicion as to the pleasure in store
for him. However Mr. Cray's suspi
cions at one time in the afternoon
were slightly aroused but he only
thought thot Mrs. Cray meant to have
the immediate members of the family
present. These suspicions however
were soon delayed when she told him
she was only putting up strawberries.
So unconcious was he of what wa
actually taking place, that many of
the guests had arrived before he came
home, and his surprise was complete
when . he returned. It was a jolly!
evening and a jolly crowd. A delight
ful menu was served at six o'clock,
consisting of cold ham, beef loaf cro
quets, stewed potatoes, green peas,
fruit salad, dressed eggs, cottage
cheese, coffee, hot biscuits, light corn
bread, followed by strawberx-ies, ice
cream rand cake. After supper cigarS
were enjoyed. The occasion was Mr.
Cray's fifty-fourth birthday. The
time was passed pleasantly until 8:30

lowing g"ests were present, Elder
Thomas Smith, Drs. H C. Burroughs

Best Act In Vaudeville Tonigh't.
Dainty June Roberts & Co., resent
ing "The Doll Maker's Dream." and
Otis Mitchell, the wizard of the banjo,
will be the special attraction at the
Paris Grand to-night and Saturday.
Those who remember "The Doll
Maker's Dream" from last season are
aware of the fact that it was by far
the beat act ever seen at the Grand in
vaudevlle. Dainty June Roberts is
one of the most graceful and winsome
little dancers on the stage to-day As
sweet as a baby violet, as 'bright as a
sunbeam and as light on her feet as
the thistle down dranerie3 that list to
the strains that the fairies play on
their cobweb harps, she dances her
way into the hearts of her audience
and after they have left the theatre
the memory of this little lady comes
back to them sweet and bright and
cheerful.
Baby Dorothy sings "The Yama
Yama Man" so sweetly that she en
raptures you, and when she says "I
love my dolly, but oh, you Teddy
Bear, "you are in doubt whether to
laugh or cry. Mrs. Roberts, as
Katrina, the woman who never, says
anything, and "Daddy" Roberts, with
his solos on the flute give a complete
ness to the act which makes it the
mota delightful sketch of present day
vaudeville.
By special request Manager Porter i
ha3 decided to give a snecial matinee-T
Saturday afternoon at 2:30.

Stout May Have To Hold Old Job.
When the June term of the Bour
bon Circuit Court convenes in this city
next Monday, it will be presided over
by Judge Robert L. Stout, if a decis
ion of the Court of Appeals made yes
terday in a similar case has the same
effect in this instance, It has been
the opinion here that with the June
term a new Judge would be appointed
to serve, as Judge Stout would hold
court in the new district of Franklin
count", created by. the last Legisla
ture. A dispatch from Fraukfort
says :
"In reversing the case of McCreary,
Governor vs. Ira Fields, Common
weath's Attorney, the Court of Ap
peals today holds that the Legislature
has the power to specify who shall
serve as judges and attorneys in the
new circuit court districts.
"Fields, who lives in Letcher county
was Commonwealth's Attorney for
that district. The last legislature
made a new district, the thirty-fifth,
out of Pike and Letcher counties and
specified that the Govenor should ap
point a judge and attorney for the
new district.
"Fields contended he had the right
to serve as attorney for the new dis
trict but the court says he has not
and must move into some county in
his old district it he wants to continue
as Commonwealth's Attorney.
"Thisx decision is construed to also
settle the question of Judge Stout's
right to serve as judge in the new
district composed of Franklin county
and he will haye to remain in his old
district composed of Bourbon, Scott
and Woodford counties."
