an 17 The Hawaiianannexation treaty will this week againoccupy the major portion of the timeof the senate It appears improbablehowever that the treaty will be takenup on Monday There is a unanimousagreement to vote upon the immigration bill during that day and it is altogether probable that this vote willbe preceded by some discussion of themerits of the bill The friends of themeasure are confident of its passagebut they are not very hopeful of getting-it through without further debateSenator Wolcott has given notice ofbis intention to address the senate onMonday when he will make a reportof the transactions of the recent international bimetallic commission MrWolcott has never given extended publicutterance concerning the commissionwork and there is very general interest manifested as to the course he maypursue in his speech on MondayWhen the senate resumes consideration of the Hawaiian treaty SenatorMorgan will take the floor and it is understood will consume at least anotherday in the presentation of his views infavor of annexation lie will be followed by Senators Pettigrew andWhite in opposition to the treaty andby other senators for and against itThere is no hope that the discussionwill be concluded during the week Agreat many senators wish to speakand as long as the result of the vote isas uncertain as it is at presentneither side will be disposed to allowthe vote to be takenThe senate has agreed to work on theconfirmation of Attorney General McKenna as associate justice of the supreme conrt on next Friday and theprobabilities are that this vote will bepreceded by some discussion as to MrMcKennas meritsThe urgent deficiency appropriationbill will in all probability be reportedon Monday and there may be an effortto secure its consideration during theweekThe house is likely to become thearena for a general discussion of ourforeign relations in connection withthe consideration of the diplomatic andconsular appropriation bill during thepresent week The Cuban situationthe annexation of Hawaii and the designs of the European powers towardChina will of course be the principaltopics to attract attention The housemanagers do not want an extendeddebate on Cuba precipitated atthis time but the minority isdetermined to press the questionduring the consideration of this billThey believe the time is particularlyopportune owing to the anti autonomyriots in Havana Monday is DistrictofColumbia day and on Tuesday theconsideration of the army- appropriation bill will be resumed This is likelv to be finished Tuesday after whichthe

said to be aserions hindrance to cabbage growingin several states No way is known ofcuring the disease or of entirely ridding a locality of it when once it iswell established The whole subjectof

PresszSyQiprHORACE MrOlEYCopyright 1896 by J B Lippincott CoCHAPTER Vin ContinuedI had formulated in my own mind aiplan which I dared not share with MarkGerard Left to himself I foresaw thathe would sacrifice justice to his love forthe hoy that the Greek would go scotiree to enjoy his guins Andsuch a thought was exasperating-Taking advantage therefore of mypatrons long strides I dropped to theTear and submitted my scheme to theworthy Jap He was good enough toapprove it mightily and eagerlyproffered his assistanceIf we dont corral the cuss Mr Livingston I swear Ill Ill never be ableter kiss Danish Mary again and enjyitI told him to be of good cheer and tocarry out my instructions to the letteriperaxd urged us continually to mendLiuabe He carried a rifle a catapultirwdula have served him as well andmuttered to himself as he stumbledthrough the darkness Jap and I werewell armed to the teeth as the dimenovels have it and Jap carried hislanternBefore Ave crossed the low sand duneswhich lay between the marshes and theisea Jap extinguished the lantern andwe held a brief council of war It wasdecided to treat with the enemy underfriendly cover of the fog the whitestand largest of flags of truceIt -would be wise said I to advancetin open order The hut is provided witha large bore duck gun and a charge ofswan shot might excite a panicIll take the center said Gerardand do the talking-Ill take the left said Jap an dothe cussinAnd Ill take the rig ht said I andkeep my mouth shutThe fog was now so thick that an object a dozen yards away could not beiseen at allThe first thing to determine iswhether the Greek is here observedGerard Are you ready Thenmarch1 Our commander-in-chief halted at theidentical spot where I had stood a fewihours before and I heard him sighheavily as he realized that the boat -wason the wrong side of the channel TheGreek had returnedi Demetrius he yelled shrillycome outI am here was the instant replyI waited for no more but tran noiselessly for some fifty yards to the righttit was bitterly cold but I stripped offcoat waistcoat and boots Then hold-ing my gun in my left hand I pushedthrough the tules and entered the icywater The channel was deep and atthe place I had selected broad A swimwas inevitableWhen I reached the island I removedmy dripping- underclothes and stole forward naked as an Indian I fearedthat the swish of wet cloth might beta-aymy approach and besides theclinging garments might impede thefree use of my limbs Demetrius mustbe taken if possible alive- and I decided to leave the gun within reach andto trust to my muscles and a knifewhich I thrust between my teethWhat passed between master -and manwhile I was executing these maneuversI learned subsequently Demetrius aswe had expected submitted a cut-and-driedproposition worthy I must admit of his subtle brainHe denied nothing and concedednothing but his conditions implied admission of guilt Briefly they were asfollows Gerard and his party were toreturn to the house and stay there Heand Mark would take the morning trainto city There in San Franciscohe would leave the boy at some hotelhe naturally did not specify the hoteland go his way If he laid great emphasis upon -the conjunction if anytreachery were attempted by telegraphic communication with the police or otherwise he swore solemnly toilf th boy instantly He would usehis own judgment as to when and wherehe would part company with Mark andhe demanded in addition a solemnpledge from Gerard that he Demetriusshould be given plenary absolution forhis misdeeds up to dateGerard knowing the nature of theman and trembling with apprehensionfor the safety of his darling was aboutto accede to these impudent demands asI crawled within earshotLet me have the boy now hepleadedDemetrius laughed The scoundrelcould twist the famous financier aroundhis little finger as a man twists a ringand the occupation amused himMr Gerard he was never morestudiously polite Mr Gerard I amnot a fool You know that sirWhere is Mark panted the fatherAsleep Shall I awake himPut him in the boat and you can gowhere you -willYou speak for yourself Mr Gerardbut there are others who are er interested in me There is that verylucky young man Mr Hugo LivingstonWhere is he by the byeHere you damned scoundrel saidI hereI had him by the throat as I spokeand a second later caught the stianglehold on him the hold which madeEvan Lewis famous as a wrestler Hewrithed and tvTisted but the hold cannever be broken between men of equalstrength Before a minute had passedhe was as a rag doll I gave his windpipe a last squeeze and flung him senseless to the ground The fig lit was overMeantime Jap and Geraird the lattercould not swim had plunged into theslough and the water reaching only totheir necks had landed safely upon theislandGerard rushed to the hut but Japremaiped with me The Greek lay aninert mass at my feetYouve had all the fun said Jap reproachfully But Id like sir to tiehim up good an fastWe have no ropes I replied Thequestion of securing Demetrius had already perplexed meThere are ropes in the hut said JapIll get emBring a light I called after himand be quick about itI could hear the voices of father andson the breathless explanations andboyish ejaculations of surprise Markjunior had the warmest affection forthe Greek who as I have said beforehad acquired a dominating- influenceover the lad Obviously Demetrius hadcounted upon capturing the gosling- aswell as the ganderJap soon rejoined me with lanternand a coil of bale ropeCan you truss him properlyCan I You leave the cuss to mesirFinally tied hand and foot and stillunconscious we carried Demetrius toThe Greelr met me a bloody knife In his handthe hut and propped him up on the bedThen Geraird satisfied that his enemywas powerless drew Jap and me asideIve told Mark as little as possiblehe murmured I did not wish tofrighten him unnecessarily Whatshallwe do with DemetriusThe question demanded

you leaveThe coachman grinned and shiveredRun along said Gerard and bringdry clothing for Mr Livingston andmeThe man untied the boat and pushedoff I had found a pair of overalls in thehut and an overcoat belonging to Demetrius In these I felt fairly comfortable and my teeth stopped chattering None the less it was bitterlycold and I felt that my patrons protestations of gratitude mig ht be deferred Gerard however was feverishly loquacious and could not be silencedCold he exclaimed By heavensI never was so pleasantly warm in mylife If you want to feel cold Hugoget your heart frozen My body is asmall affairMy body isnt I returned Wecan discuss these matters later sir unless 3ou propose to thaw out your heartwith a burning dose of pneumoniaWe had stood for fully ten minutesexposed to the raw fog and I cut shorthis chatter by moving towards the hutI thought too that I heard the voice ofthe GreekGad said I Demetrius has cometoGerard started at these words rannimbly ahead and entered the hut Iheard an oath followed by a screamfrom the boy and then a horrid thudAs I burst through the door the Greekmet me a bloody knife in hie hand anda glare in his eyes the like of whichI pray that I may ne er see again Onearm was still tied and both legs buthe Junged viciously at my heart as 1sprang at him I turned the thrustwith my naked left arm I shall carrythe scar to the grave and counteredhim full on the point of the jaw Hefell like a stricken bullock anding the knife from his clenched handI hastened past him and bent over Gerard He was lying on the floor mortally wounded I could guess but consciousSecure lum irst ha gaspedThe boy was crying bitterly I hadto shake him vigorously before he answered my questionHow did this happen -I untied him he sobbed I untiedhim Oh father father I didntmean to do any harmNever mind my boy said Gerardfaintly Im ready to die now anywayCHAPTER IXThe details 1 learned laterDemetrius it seemed had asked the4boy to loosen the rope which Jap withhearty good will had knotted so tightly as to cut the flesh Mark in absolute ignorance of the true nature ofthe beast and moved to pity at thesight of his swollen and bleeding wristshad consented to slacken one end Apowerful wrench had freed the Greeksright arm as Gerard entered the hutand Demetrius faithful to his oathhad grasped a knife and turned uponthe boy With both feet tied

sumcarefully invested to the archimandrite of his native town and he facedthe hangman with a smile upon his pallid lipsGerard lingered several weeks thehappiest so he assured me of his lifeThe tangled

ward A screen across thetable hid her lamp while the rest of theward was but dimly lit From the bedscame the sound of sleepers breathingregularly broken now and then by afeverish muttering from some restlesspatient or by the scarce repressedgroaning of the man who had that daybeen operated on for cancer Nightafter night week after week formonths had she kept her silent vigilthere and she was weary of it Sometimes the grim scene surrounding herstrained her nerves until the desire formore active work possessed her to adegree well nigh beyond endurance Insuch mood she often penciled letterswithout restraint or consideration tono one in particular the offspring ofher brain tired fancy whose destinywas to be thrust impatiently into thefire when dawn crept grayly throughthe window beside herjjinirseItuth was an impulsive womanthough her great pathetic eyes misledyou into thinking differently A woman of contradictions as was witnessedby her flippancy of speech and hersweet grave manner She did her dutybravely enough to her patients andthey loved her The younger studentsalso had ofttinies cause to be gratefulto her for some well timed hint thatscreened their glaring mistakes frombeing discovered She was tired of hertvork of her life that night and impatient with herself began to walkelowly round the ward The man of thecancer operation looked pitifully at heras she passed and coming back shestopped to give him some milk whileshe afterwards took his temperatureere she returned to her table Presently she rang the house surgeons bellund stood waiting with the thermometer in her hand until he came Shepassed it to him silentlyWhere on earth did you get thistemperature nurse he whisperedNot fromShe nodded A look of concern appeared in his eyes and keeping herthermometer he went quickly to thebed The man who was at last drowsysighed when the doctor unbuttoned hisshirt and laid a finger on hie pulseThe doctor looked puzzled He countedthe beats carefully and listened to thebreathing Taking his thermometerfrom under the mans arm he wentback to Nurse Ruths table He compared the two there His registered1012 degrees hers 109 degrees Watching him her face crimsonedI held it over the lamp sir shesaid and though she laughed her eyeswere full of tearsAh yes I understand nurseHe sat down for a few moments thetwo thermometers still on the tablebefore him When he got up he saiddreamilyPerhaps joud better go on day dutyagain Good night nursePor an hour after he had gone shelay across the table with her head onher arms and made no sound Timewent by and as the city clocks markedit she heard every stroke Finally shejsat up and while listening for the solemn tolls she wrote an application tothe house surgeon to ask for a certificate -of qualification as a nurse Heafterwards gave her the certificate in aformal letter but at the same time hewrote another that was not official Herreply gives tlm gist of itWhat can you mean sirN by speaking ofa letter that I wrote as So much cheek Ido not understand it I thought it businesslike By your manner this afternoon In theward you seemed appalled that I should-write to you What and who are you thatI should hesitate to address you I cannot -but rejoice that you hive given sogood a testimony of my capabilities It isgratifying to my feelings too that youave not parjured yourself in giving itWhat is the strong point in my characterthat some pecple might like Do you likeifc Why not add it to the testimonial Ilike any light to be hid under aX helNurse called the house surgeon theaxteruoon after he had received it and-again Nurce Suth he called afterier in the corrifr outside the door ofthe ward he was about to enter ShestoppedNurse did you write this letter tome drawing one from his pocket ashe spokeYes sir I did she replied glancingat him swif tryWhyI dont know -Has it ever struck you that you area most outrageously cheeky woman towrite like this to meA deeper tide of red rushed over herface Well she considered perhapsHe laughed glanced quickly up anddown the empty corridor seized herhands in one of his with the other heheld the handle of the door before whichthey stood and bending kissed herJust as quickly he turned awaypushed open the door and went intothe ward The sister in charge advancedto me t him They went round the bedstogether and as he listened gravelyshe told him the history of each casesince he had seen it lastNurse Ruth was going ofE duty forthe afternoon when the house surgeoncalled her While she put on her blackbonnet and the long cloak that almosthid her gown of lilac sprigged printshe looked at herself and stopped tyingher bonnet to think After frowningat her reflection for a moment shelaughed Then her changing moodgrew critical of herself She sighed andthought really seriouslyWhat an idiot I am to care two pinsabout him When he talks as he didto me to day I hate him 0 why is heso nice What a little fool Ive been towrite to him I wonder he speaks tome I must have been mad when I didit Ill go away I will 0 but shesighed I love himShe went out in a chastened moodand made her way quickly through thecrowded streets towards the riverwhere the steps lead to the steamboatpier by London bridge As she wentdown them a man coming just behindher stumbled heavily forward andwould have rolled to the bottom hadnot her hand outstretched in an instantcaught and steadied him till he regainedhis balance He laughed while hethanked her saying You were in theright place then nurse She passedon down to the boat and found a lonelyseat in the bows The tide was outhelpless boats keeled over in the slopesof black mud on the side andthe laden barges in mid stream weredeserted The sultry air hung heavityand for the moment she wrould havegiven anything to escape the monotonyof her life to secure some pleasure andfine clothes She let the boat at Charing Cross and went into the gardens fora little time though even here the surroundings gained upon her A bandthat went smartly through some popular airs the brillliancy of the scarletgeraniums that the gardeners were bedding out some children that playednear her seat irritated her strangelyShe got up therefore and went towardsthe old -water gate on the chance of being able to get into the Strand that waySome one had told her the meaning ofthe motto above the gate The Cross isthe touchstone of FaithNothing but faith nothing butcrosses for me she murmured perversely O howl wish I wishShe passed up Buckingham streetand climbed on to the top of an omnibus in the Strand As she sat therenothing in the busy life they passed1 A 114-IsSHXMllwIfiiO 1HE KISSED HERcame into her thoughts she was onlyconscious of restlessness and stir Presently her eyes caught sight of a whitebutterfly that flew above a barrow offlowers which was being slowly pushedalong the pavements edge with gaycarelessness strange enough in thatcrotvded place Once this white bit oflife fluttered upward high and higheras though to reach the gray filaments ofcloud that streaked the blue between the roof tops then in somevague sad way she associated herselfwith it for she knew it must soon becrushed beneath thousands of hurryingfeet and she longed to take it out ofPleet street and to give it freedom insome fresh mown country fieldFive months had passed since NurseRuth had left the hospital The housesurgeon had become the house physician and his term for holding that office had almost run out The world behind the hospital walls is one of sickness of sorrow and of pain with another world of mental activity laborand strength to minister to it It is agreat machine of life that is set to succor life while those who form it soonforget those others who have leftStill one morning a letter lay on thehouse physicians table one he openedand read first It was written with herusual recklessnessOh Im getting like the Irishman whowas all blue molded for want of a batingIm all blue molded for want of a flirtation Oh write to me do write to me Ivebeen shut up dll this time with a smallpoxcase Everybody has been saying I shouldbe dead before no but 1 live to be athorn a the flesh of some one yet

said musingly Shes got lots of pluck in her Illwrite and tell her shed better get marriedLife and death went in and out of thehospital and the workers came andwent The house physician left it in histurn and 12 months after he was stationed at Aden where perhaps he hadless work than he desired One afternoon the English mail brought hima letter from Ruth The writing on theenvelope set him thinking sadly maybe df the old busy life in London andof the possibilities in her character forwhich at this distance of time andspace he imagined he must have lovedher He laughed at himself presentlyand opened the letterYou said once I was always fond of doing something sensational then you advised me to study Mrs Beeton I havestudied it for I have often done what youtold me But I dont think I shall live longto dispense the good things I may learnfrom that world famed cookery book Youknow there is an old proverb Tou joursperdrix Well it is this with me Toujours parson He has driven me to takemore of your seriously and I amgoing to be marrlod Sometimes I thing Imust be mad to contemplate domestic blisswith religion I would gladly give anythingthree years of my life to reallyenjoy

mechanically doing my dutyPoor little Ruth Jolly little Ruthhe murmured as he settled once morecomfortably into his lounging chairHe rolled up and lit another cigaretteand pondered for a few moments overhis attraction 1 this woman Therehad been others Well it is usuallywith this kind of excuse that men-remembertheir flirtations and oicourse hold themselves blameless Perhaps there may have been a vague regret in the doctors mind Aden is nota place where old flirtations or platonicfriendships can be buried without regret It is a place where the memoryof either grows tender and

become hateful to himWith this thought on his mind he endedhis reverie and went on opening hjsmail letters There chanced to be someGhristmas cards among them full oigood wishes and sentiment Oneoithese had a pathetic little versethatsuited his humor so presently he putit in an envelope and sent it off to Ruthwith the outgoing mail This was noifair for he knew that at the time shereceived it she would be married andthis so far as he wras concerned closedthe correspondenceOnce more she wrote a little more soberly perhapsThank you so much for that card yougent After all I am only Nurse Ruth inyour thoughts and you are in mine wellit is hard to say what you are I have madeup my mind never to write again becauseit does me no good to be thinking of youThis is the beginning of the new

prices of staple productsthey left the old and ventured into newfields of live stock production croppingand methods of farming These experiments have not been satisfactoryto the vast majority for no sooner didthey get into a new field than it wasoverrun with their competitors Butthe experience has been valuable Theresult is a general tendencj to returnto the production of the staples in asystem of mixed farming as being themost satisfactory in the long run Mostof the so called specialties whichwere to do so much for the averagefarmer have failed to enrich him Mostof the new crops which were so loudlypraised in the beginning have beenfound no improvement over the old Butin methods of farming which involvedicheaper production and a better product there has been considerable advance For

to Georgia Aboutthe SeasonsYou see Georgie said Mr Wingleby whose youthful son had askedhim how we came to have differentkinds of weather the weather is putup in tin cans a days weather to acan and usually they put up about ayears supply ahead enough to lastthrough a spring summer autumn andwinter In filling the cans they sort itall out as well as possible Sometimeswhen they get a can full there mayjfae alittle left over and whatever remainsin this way they throw into one lotWhen theyve got pretty nearly all ihecans full and the regular stocker has run out they fill up from thatlot of odds and ends The cans so filledcontain what is called variable weatherbecause its mixed but most of theweather they get pretty well sorted outaccording to the seasonWhen theyve got all the cans filledthey stack em up where theyll behandy to get at and theres a man thatdoes nothing but open them Every dayhe cuts a can and pours out the weatherfor that day and of course a great dealdepends upon him Sometimes this mangets careless and pulls down a lot of thewrong cans getting them say from theJuly shelf in the month of April andlikely as not getting dwn a weekssupply at once so as to have them handyoh the opening table Of course he discovers his mistake the first can he opensbut he is too lazy to put the rest backand so he keeps on then he hasopened them all and thats how itcomes about as it sometimes does thatwe get a hot spell at a season when weought to have nothing but cool weatherBut of course those April cans arenot lost They must be around somewhere and we get em later Maybethe man will sprinkle them along witlthe hope that we wont notice themmuch but as likely as not he opensthem one after another together maybeafter some terribly hot spell in July orAugust when they are sure to be ablessed relief and if he does this we arepretty apt to forgive him his mistake inApril Louisville Courier JournalClever ManIt is said of a contributor to some ofthe comic papers of the day
