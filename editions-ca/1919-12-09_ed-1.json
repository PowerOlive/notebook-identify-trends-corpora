"I believe I would have died bad it
not been for Trutona, but now I
feel good all over just like a boy
again and I wouldn't take $500 for
my relief," W. B. Mattingly, a well
known and highly respected busi
ness man of Jeffersontown, near
here, said recently.
"For the past twenty-three years,"
Mr. Mattingly continued, "I have
suffered from kidney trouble, nerv
ousness and catarrh of the stomach.
I often suffered severely from pains
in my back, chest and stomach.
The little food I ate didn't agree
with me and I was usually consti
pated.
"I can't discern the least sign of
my former nervousness, since I've
taken Trutona. My. bowels are act
ing regularly now, too. It seems
that everything I eat agrees with
me. The pains in my back, chest
and stomach have vanished and I'm
not annoyed at night by my kidneys
as before. Trutona is a real medi
cine and I'm glad to recommend
and commend it to the public."
Trutona is especially beneficial
for stomach, bowel and liver troub
les, catarrhal complaints, nervous
ness, loss of appetite and the like
and has proven a splendid recon
structive agency, system purifier
and body invigorant.
Trutona, the perfect tonic, is now
being introduced and explained in
Paris at the Drug Store of G. S. Var
den & Son.
