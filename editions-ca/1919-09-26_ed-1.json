GOES EVERYWHERE; HELPS EV

The work of the Salvation Army
includes every activity that can miti
gate in any way the need of human
ity. . .
Of course, these activities are di
rected in certain channels, which are
very carefully organized and admin
. istered with economy that is amazing
to those who do not know how fru
- gaily these devoted workers maintain
- -themselves and achieve" their object
ives. The Salvation Army recognizes no
extreme of need no situation no
distress with which it cannot proper
ly undertake to cope. This fact makes
its work of an exceedingly varied
character. It deals instantly with
' the predominate condition. This is
instanced at the present time by the
tremendous amount of war emergen
cy relief, which the Salvation Army
is daily adpinistering in all princi
pal cities. The disbanding of, the
soldiers and sailors, threw a great
responsibility directly into the hands
of the Salvation Army. These boys
liad learned -to love the Salvation
Army first in France. They came to
the Salvation Army first in this coun
try when fliey were in need of an--thing
whatsoever, from a suit of
clothes to a few words of encourage
ment, because they had learned in
the trenches that the hand of the Sal
vation Army worker, was always out
stretched to them and that the sym
pathetic help which they were in
need of would be extended to them
vregardless of the conditions which
had brought adversity upon them.

LONG SHOTS DEFEAT FAVORITES
AT LATONIA OPENING.
Under ideal weather conditions the
thirty-eighth fall meeting at Latonia
opened Wednesday. A crowd which
almost equaled the opening day
gathering at the spring meeting was
on hand.
Favorite winners were few and far
between. Not in a single race did
the public choice come down in front.
Even in the Latonia Handicap, the
feature event of the day, War God,
the winner, was coupled in .the
field with Harvest King, and paid
nearly 14 to 1.
While long shots won, the favor
ites gave them a battle, and in every
race the finish was close and inter
esting. In some of the races the big
crowd had to wait until the officitl
placing went up before it -could tell
who was the winner.
The opening was easily the best
ever given at Latonia, and bears out
the prediction that this is going to
be some "hoss" gathering at the old
course.
The winners of the opening day's
events were: First race, Apple Jack
II; second race, Angon; third race,
John O.; fourth race, High Cost;
fifth race, War God; sixth race, Vir
go; seventh race, Piedra. Viva
America, owned by S. Kenney Nich
ols, of Paris, made a brave effort to
win the Latonia Handicap, the fifth
Tace. - She possessed her usual early
speed, but could not keep it together.
Viva America and Blackie Daw rac
ed head and head for more than half
a mile, when War God moved up and
took the-lead.

SPENCER MERCHANT.
Their youth was the only thing
that stood in the way of Miss Helen
Kathryn Spencer and Mr. Charles
Merchant, of Lexington,, from wed
ding in the formal way, but they
laughed at difficulties, and simply
eloped.
Miss Spencer entered the Millers
burg College as a student this fall.
Returning from a visit to the home
of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. E. M.

been a student at the Millersburg
Military Institute. He and Miss
Spencer were sweethearts. It was
learned that he too, was (missing
from school. Information afterward
came to hand that the couple had
gone away in an automobile, coming
through Paris, where they stopped
off long enough to perfect their plans
and then drove on to Vevay, Indiana,
where they were married.
Mr. and Mrs. Merchant were both
very popular in Millersburg. They
were given a hearty welcome home
on their return to Lexington, Wed
nesday, by their respective parents,
whose only objection to their union
was the youth s)i the couple.

est to the many friends and relatives

ATJTHOE'S lEEMORY A. WON33ER.
Theophile Gautier was a master of
literary style. Here is the account of
how he wrote his 'Travels in Italy,"
given by his friend, Maxijme du
Camp:
" 'This book, which one would
supppose to have been thought out in
retirement, in a library of works of
reference, was actually written in a
printing iiouse, amidst the clatter of
compositors, the noise of " printing
presses, the hum of machinery, slam
ming of doors, and hubbub of a busy
workship. Not a note, book, or doc
ument did the author make use of.
His mepnory surpassed belief, and he
could draw on it at will without fear
101 oemg iea astray. ie composed
without erasing or correcting. When
he liad finished ten lines, the over
seer would clip them from the' MS.
and hand them to the compositor, re
peating the process until the article
or chapter was complete. Then, when
the proofs were set before him, Gnu-,
tier would Indicate errors by making
them with his nail, and would would
go on his way, breathing deeply, like
a miner released from his subterra
nean-gallery at-the end of ,. day's
work.' "
