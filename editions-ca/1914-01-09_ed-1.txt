Thefight against the "extra help," whichhas come up at every session of theLegislature since the occupation ofthe new Capitol is up again, and withthe probabilities that it will end likeall the others in the authorization ofthe additional employes in both legislative branches despite the constitutional barrier so much invoked.The Tesolution providing for extraemployes has already passed theHouse, though by the scant margin-of 51 to 47, and the fight is expectedto come up in the 6enate when itmeets Monday.The "extra help measure wasmade a caucus measure in the Senate and those favoring it confidentlyrely on the Democratic strength toput it over. It is pointed out that itwould be impossible to conduct thebusiness of the Legislature in thenew quarters with me meager forcelimited by the Constitution.In order to obviate in the futurethe fight at coming sessions of theLegislature over the employment of-additional employes, a bill, it is said,-will be offered at the present session providing for "extra help" andat Tthe same time evading the constitutional inhibition against additional-employes in the Senate and House.The proposed bill will also fix the-compensation of such additional employes. Naturally much interest is beingmanifested in the outcome of the "extra help" agitation by those who expect to get the jobs. Some of themhave already gone to work in anticipation of appointment.In the selection and appointmentof the standing -committees, of bothbranches of the Legislature President Edward J. McDermott, of theState. Senate, and Speaker Claude B.Terrell, t)f the House of Representatives, have a task for the next threedays that is calculated to keep themextremely busy, to say nothing of the"cussin' " they may get after their appointments are announced. As Gov.McDermott explained, the appointment of the Senate committeesMaloneinvolves over 9,000 combinations ofnames, and, with the membership ofthe House nearly three times as large,Speaker Terrall's work is correspondingly increased.The first joint session of the General Assembly was held Wednesdayfor the purpose of hearing Prof. CarlC. Plehn, the eminent California tax-expert, on needed changes in the taxsystem of Kentucky. The Legislature adjourned Wednesday until nextMonday at noon to give the presidingofficers of both branches time to appoint the standing committees. Thelong adjournment was opposed bysome of the members, but it pre"v ailed by a decisive majority.A feature of the Senate session wasthe tabling of the resolution offeredby Senator R. H. Scott making ineligible to any committe any Senatorinterested in any way in the subjectrelegated to such committee.NEW FISCAL COURT HOLDSFIRST BUSINESS SESSION.r TiiP TYiPmhora rF fio Wcnol rnm4elected at the November election metin their first session yesterday.

The petition was signed by number of property owners in that vicinity it beingcontended that the erection of such abuilding in a residence neighborhoodwould caused a decrease in the valueof that class of property.Mr. Charles N. Fithian acted as thespokesman for the objecting parties,and addressed the Council to somelength setting forth the objections tothe granting of the permit, while Mr.Edward Prichard of the firm of PricharJ Ball urged the council to grantthe permit upon the ground that theimprovement would in no wise provedetrimental to any of the adjacentresidence property, and would be aconsiderable improvement over theI building which now occupies the siteof the proposed structure..

Dr. Robert Broom, anoted authority on South Africanpalaeontology, and who has spent 16years or more in exploration and research in Africa, has brought his fani.us collection of South African Permian reptiles to the American museumof natural history for purposes ofcomparative study. There are threegreat colections of South African reptiles in the world that of the Britishmuseum, that in the Cape Town museum and Doctor Broom's. Until afew years ago it was supposed thatAmerican reptiles were different fromthose in any other part of the world."Four years ago, however, whilelooking at specimens here," said Doctor Broom, "I found them moderatelyclosely allied to South African forms.Among th6 South African types wehave a continuous record of land reptiles from the middle Permian periodto the upper Triassic period. Whenthe South African deposits are completely investigated we will have ahistory of the world for a period ofthree million years. That period wouldprove the most interesting in theworld's history. These mammals ofthat period were the first evolved."Doctor Broom's collection of fossilreptiles contains the almost completeskeleton of the endothiodon, a reptilewhich has limbs and toes like a modern warm blooded animal. It is thbelief of Doctor Broom, after spending years of investigation and research in African wilds, that the faunaof that region and the North American.Permian originate from a common,source.Thoughtful consumers of FUEL will resolve to obtain the highest efficiency for theirmoney during the year to come.

What is the gre estdiameter of the earth? T'e form ofthe earth is that of a flattened spheroid, greater in diameter at the tquator than at the poles, but this is modified by the accidents of its surface.So that the diameter varies accordingto the point at which it is measured.It might be expected that the diameter would be greatest if measuredfrom the top of the highest mountainwhich is Mount St. Everest, in theHimalayas, but, unfortunately, thepoint at which the dimeter wouldemerge on the other side of the worldis the Pacific ocean, where this is.more than seven thousand feet deep.Prof. L. Henkel of Schulpferda, saysthe greatest diameter of the earth isthat taken from the summit of MountChimborazo, in Ecuador, 20,136 feetabove the sea level. This, he says,emerges at the antipodes on a highpoint on the north coast of Sumatra.This diameter is 7,929.3 miles.As Chimborazo is almost on theequator, its summit is that point onthe earth's surface which is most distant from the center. There weightis feeblest and centrifugal force greatest The earth's smallest radius is thatfrom the center to the north pole, butit is not certain that the line throughthe poles is the smallest diameter, because the south pole is on a highplateau. It might be found that aline a little distant from the poles,which would emerge at sea level ateach end, would be even shorter thanthe polar diameter. Such a line wouldbe found at a point in the Arcticocean between Spitzbergen and Greenland to a point just off the coast ofthe Antarctic continent in the big bay&1298We alt kar a full line of Schloss Bros.9 guaranteed-tailored Suits, for $15 to $25.

The present i writeris inclined to believe that the diameter takn from the summit of MountChiles, In Columbia, 15,900 feet abovethe sea, might be greater than thatfrom the summit of Chimborazo, for. acareful study of the maps indicatesthat at its antipodes it would emergeat a higher point in Sumatra than theChimlporazo line. The latter wouldemerge in V N. lat, 101 B. long.,which, .point is in the marshes on theplateau near Serentang. The line fromMt. Chiles would emerge at 1 S. lat.,102 E. long., which is on the northeastern slope of the Barison Mountains at an elevation of about 4,000feet. Which of these lines is thelonger depends upon the elevation oftheir respective antipodes. Chim-i borazo is more than 4,000 feet higherthan Chiles, so the Chiles line wouldhave to emerge at least that muchabove sea level.lanKrxitr mmr,:Pans Odorless Cleaning Co. ?Let us Make that Last Winter's Suit or OvercoatLook Like New.Yop will be surprised when we send your clothes home,and will wonder why you have not tried us before.AH Work Guaranteed Satisfactoryt -Men'sand Ladies' Panama and Straw Hats Cleaned andReblockecLto your satisfaction.We Call For and Deliver Work.Call up E.

Manytimes it is even practical to cut thefirst crop a few days earlier, especially if a large acreage is to be harvested. Time is one of the controlling factors in taking care of the hay,so it is necessary for the grower toexercise judicious planning to utilizehis time to the best advantage.It is a good plan to start themower as soon as the dew is off inthe morning and the prospects seemgood for two or three days of continued good weather. This hayshould be tedded in the swath in theafternoon, so that it will dry out underneath. The side delivery rake fsgood, in fact, the ideal machine toturn the hay. Beginning on the outside of the field, the hay is carriedfurther out, leaving an open Bpacewhich will be heated by the sun before the next round is made. Onturning the next swath the dry, hotstubble and soil will quickly drawthe moiBture from it, therefore thehay is curing from below as well asfrom above. The following morningthe same rake is used as soon as thehay is sufficiently dry, and twoswaths put in one, and in the afternoon it is ready to be stacked orhauled into the mow.The following method is practiced,and lends itself admirably to takingcare of a hay crop if it is not tooheavy: The mower would be run latein the afternoon, when not much wilting will take place and when theundergrowth is perfectly dry. Theadvantage of this over the early morning is that the soil is warm and dry,and that less surface is exposed tobecome wet by dew than when alfalfais standing. The hay is turned in thefollowing morning just before noon,and will be ready to rake and stackin the middle of the afternoon. Another plan is to rake in the afternoonand put it up in small cocks, turningthese over the following day, replacing these two into one, and lettingthem cure for a few days beforestacking. It is of the greatest importance that the hay be absolutelydry from dew before putting it intothe barn or stack. Alfalfa is moredifficult to cure properly than thegrasses, because the leaves fall off soI readily, and when we consider thatthese make up 48 per cent of the cropby weight, their true value i verysignificant.-riNow Well"Thedford's Black-Draughtis the best all-round medicinelever used," writes J.

Oct 3 tf 'WHY I BREED-THI-AMERICAN SADDLE HORSE(By W. B. Stilwell.)I was born to love a horse, and atho ge of five years I owned fifteens ick horses. One was a fine showhorse, with an arched grapevine neck bern 1 rought -n" ... leatherwood tail. When nine ( appearance oiTear5 old I was employed by Dr. W. schools, but moreSmith of Leesville, Ind., to takeo and from the B. & O. S.W.r Irai1 station. He always rode a' i He horse, and it was thenhat my heart and mind became fondf h equine." h ' possess great beauty; theytlie finest horse living, with aI m. bony, well-tapered head; his"eck an arch of pride and grace; ailash of spirit in his face; a tailike that of a sqnirrel, that is a won-"er of the world, and when in ac-ion it is pleasing to the eye, and theo'ind of gaits is music to the ear,md his wonderful greatness fills theoul with a lifting power. There is-io -nnchine that can fill the plait; ofn intelligent horse; they are a com-oanion to us."Iraveler" was a companion toGeneral Lee and his soldiers. Hisjreat courage and faithful duties,where others failed in the hardshipsof war, won the hearts of the soldiersand when he came into the camp oron the field of battle he brought sunshine to the hearts of the brave men,and they cheered him, as they did hiskind master, General Lee.A BUSINESS HORSE.They far excel as a business horse.They are at ease under the saddle;while not so swift in harness as therotter they make up in beauty andonformation. As a farm horsehey are active and qnick to learnWhile they lack in weight they makeip in step and endurance. It is upon'he gentle saddle horse that pur?reat horsemen and women takeheir lesons.THE GREATEST SHOW HORSEThe saddle horse has forged to thefront as America's greatest showhorse. They can win more -moneyand show in more rings than anyother horse; such as the five-gaitedring, walk, trot and canter, combinedmodel, fine harness ring, heavy harness, roadster, breeders' class, chargers, cavalry, jumpers, championhorse any breed. These classes havebeen won by saddle horses, withstrong competition by other breeds.Saddle horse day in Kentucky atthe fair is the banner day. Whenthe Blue Grass Fair at Lexingtonhung up $1,000 for the best saddlestallion, mare or gelding, it proveda great day. The trains and trolleysgroaned with their loads of humanity, and the public roads were linedwith vehicles of every description.It was a great day in saddle horsehistory. And again last year at theBlue Grass Fair, in the Colt Futurity,when fifty-one colts battled for the?1,800 stake, it showed that interestfcwas grpjying, and; that, its originatorMr. Jtd. j. Krum, is a leader in saddleand show horse interests. When thebig $6,000 saddle stake fills we willsee peaches and cream champions.Hurrah for Kentucky!

This is not true. The feescharged by some of the poorest colleges are larger than those n several of the best schools. Some highgrade State University medicalschools have fees as low as $50 to$60, whereas, some of the poorestschools charge fees of from $100 to$200. Tables and reports publishedrecently in the Journal of the Ameriican Medical Society show that underexisting laws twenty-seven State licensing boards have power to refuserecognition to low-grade- schools,while in seventeen States this poweris limited and in five States it islacking. In twenty-one of the Statesin which' the board has the power, itis exercising it by refusing to recognize the graduates of the low-gradeschools, which are not so equippedor conducted as to be able to give sat'sfactory instruction In medicine.These boards should have the support of the public, as all efforts tosecure better educated physiciansare for the protection of the publichealth and the prevention and injuryto the people.FALLING HAIR MEANSDANDRUFF ISACTIVESave Your Hair!.

S. Fish, Brooklyn, Mich. For sale by all dealers.(Jan) (adv)HONESTY IS NECCESSARYIN NEWSPAPERS."Suppression of news is more of awrong than the printing of a pieceof news that might possibly betternot have been written. By impropersuppression, a newspaper sells itssoul and betrays its readers. Suppression of news, to my mind, is thehigh treason of journalism."So said James Keeley, editor andgeneral managei of the Chicago Tribune in an" address before the students in the Course of Journalism atthe Univrsity of Wisconsin."No paper that permits its advertisers of the personal , socia 1 andfinancial friends of its editor to control or taint its news and editorialcolumns, ever has become a bignewspaper that is respected by thepeople. The man in the street instinctively senses this sort of treason and he punishes," continued Mr.Keeley."The sneering belief expressed byso many that the advertisers have amortgage on the editorial columns ofall newspapers is not true. There arefree men and there are slaves in ourbusiness as mere are in an lines oiwork. The newspaper field is not inhabited solely by saints, neither hasany other profession a monopoly ofthe pure at heart. The average ofhonesty in the newspaper business,however, will compare favorably withthat in any other trade or profession."The man who thinks he can betrayhis readers, the man who thinks thathe can let dollars supercede duty, theman who thinks that he can let private interests dictate his policy anddoing these things secretly imaginesthat he can pose as a -leader of public opinion, an exponent of right andhonesty-'-is fooling himslf, not thepublic. The day of invisible government in the newspaper world, as inthe political world, is vanishing."Honesty of purpose, and the deter-mination to carry that purposeeflect, is the backbone of a newmtospa-per's reputation. An honest manmakes mistakes and a newspaper isoperated and produced by finite:minds. The decent newspaper wantsto print the truth. A lie is a businessboomerang. A newspaper's reputationfor reliability is its stock in trade.Inaccuracy is the cardinal sin. Doubtless some papers are in need of absolution." .t. M.-2,MH fcj"Hr.

The Congress gave so much consideration to the banking and currencymeasure; it took such pains and careto perfect that law; it was so conservative that is may well be depended upon to pursue the same prudentmethods in preparing the necessarylegislation for the rural credit system. The farmers of the United Statesneed such monetary facilities, andthey should have them.Many of the agriculturists in allsections are hindered in development of their lands by reason of thel&ck of facilities to obtain fundswhen needed, but those of the Westand South, stand in tne greatest needof relief in thiB respect.Every man who owns land is subject to taxation for local and Statepurposes, and, whether the tract heowns is large or small, he is a contributor to the 'country's developmentthrough the tax he pays, as well asthrough the work and money he expends upon his lands.The agriculturists are the greatfoundation of the country's prosperity, and each one of them is a 'factorin that prosperity.These are the men who should beaccorded a monetary system that willenable them to obtain the greatestpossible results in production throughthe use of funds which they may needin their work of cultivation andwhich they can give proper securityfor. ?-They should be freed from excessive ., interest rates and extortionatecommissions through means affordedthem to deal directly with financialinstitutions that will loan them fundsat fair and reasonable rates and uponperiods of time that will "not involvehonest and industrious persons inconfiscatory foreclosures.If such a system can be establishedin the United States it will result inunexampled prosperity.The agriculturists of such Statesas Kentucky, Tennessee, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina,Ohio and Indiana would experiencean immense relief and would be stimulated to a development of theirlands that would add millions of tonsto the freight of the railways andthe steamboats.It would cause, a great expansion ofthe business of every merchant within the territory of the States namedand inure to the benefit of the manufacturers of the Republic.The entire country would, he benefitted by the increased production of . States will enter an era of the greatthe farms, and also by the greater est prosperity.iMen, do you want the best in shoes? Our; line oShoes cannot be duplicated anywhere under $5.00and $6.00.

The reliability of the firm is unsurpassed andthe fact has gone forth to manyStates, resulting in stockmen cominghere and purchasing mules in largenumbers for the markets of the South.Since last Saturday the firm hassold to Southern buyers sixty-sevenhead of mules for a total of $13,400.The prices ranged from $190 to $200per head. The sales were as follows:To Mr. Jordan, of JiawKinsvine,Ga.; Saturday, 25 mules at $200 perhead.To Mr. Thomas Harmon, of SouthCarolina, Monday, 22 head of mulesat $190 each.To Mr. Roberts, of South Carolina,Monday, 20 head of mules at $200per head.Caywood and McClintock bought 15head of mules -from Mr. McClanahan,of Harrison county, . this week, at$145 per head. They also bought 4head of mules from Smith & Turney,of Cynthiana, at $177.50 per head, andtwo- horses from the same firm at$125 each.ANINSTANCE OFNEWSPAPER LOYALTY,"Haven't read of any earthquakesin the neighborhood of San Franciscolately, have you?" asks the Iola Register.
