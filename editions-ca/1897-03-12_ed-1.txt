Slier Submits His Imterpretatiomof the Queensberry Rules Which WillGovern the Great Glove Contest vCarson City Nev March 11 Themost delicate subject in connectionwith the big fight was broached Wednesday when Referee George Silersubmitted to Corbett and Fitzsimmonshis interpretation of the Queensberryrules Silers communication whichwas in the nature of a formal letterwas not received with manifestationsof joy at either campVRule 1 To be a fair stand up boxing match in a 24 foot ring or as nearthat as practicableRule 2 No wrestling or hugging allowedRule 3 The rounds to be of threeminutes- duration and one minute timebetween roundsRule 4 If either man fall throughweakness or otherwise he must get upunassisted ten seconds to be allowedhim to do so the other man meanwhile to return to his corner andwKen the fallen man is on his legs theround to be -resumed and continueduntilthe three minutes have expiredIf one man f ails to come to the scratchin the ten seconds allowed it

or any otherperson to be allowed in the ring during the rounds - -Rule H Should the contest be stopped by way unavoidable interferencethe referee to name time and place assoon as possible for finishing the contest so that the match must be won orlost unless the backers of both menagree to draw the stakesRule S The gloves to be fair sizedboxing gloves of the best quality andnewRule 9 Should a glove burst orcome off it must be replaced to thereferees satisfactionRule 10 A man on one knee isconsidered down and if struck is entitled to the stakesRule 11 No shoes or boots withsprings allowedRule 12 The contest in all otherrespects to be governed by the revisedrules of the London prize ringThe first three rules need l no comment as they are plain simple andunderstood by almost everybodyRule 4 however requires someanalysis as some of the points areoften misconstruedThe rule says I either man fallthrough weakness or otherwise hemust get up unassisted three secondsto be allowed him to do so the otherman meanwhile to return to his cornerThis of course was intended to prevent a man from standing over hisfallen opponent It probably neveroccurred to the framer of the rulesthat at times a man either falls or isknocked down in his opponents corner If then the man on his feet retires to his corner as the rules directhe will be standing over his fallen opponent and doing just what the rulesmean he shall not doTo avoid all disputes on this scoreI will simply instruct you in case of aknock down to retire at least ten feetfrom your fallen opponent to givehim an opportunity to riseRule 12 which says The contestin all other respects to be governed bythe revised rules of the London prizering is I consider one of the most important of the 12 rules and appearsto be the bone of contention in almostevery contest It has been the customof referees myself among them to inquire of the principals whether theychoose to hit in clinches with one armfree and also on breakaways Invariably the principals agree not to hit inclinches or on breakaways but theygenerally forget all about their agreement and frequently violate itNeither of you I am sure desire towin the coming contest on a technicalfoul and to avoid any such contingency through hitting in clinches witha free arm and in breakaways I willruleThat you be permitted to hit inclinches with one arm free and also onbreakaways With this interpretationof this rule announced a week beforethe contest you will both have ampletime to practice these important pointsand will have no cause for complaintshould either of you be caught off yourguardPivot blows missing with eitherhand and whipping back With theelbow meeting an opponent with ordeliberately striking him with theelbow or knees are barred and willbe considered foul Should anv of theabove blows have any material effecton the result of the contest I shall usemy judgement accordingly Shouldany of the seconds of either principalenter the ring during a round torender any assistance to the fightersor prevent them from committing afoul or to throw water on them itshall be deemed a foulTrivial fouls may be unintentionally committed by either of you whichunless they have a direct bearing onthe result will be overlooked at mydiscretionThis I believe covers all the important points Both of you are thoroughly acquainted with the marquis

placed all the papersback in the box as he had found themthen returned it to the vault put onhis hat and coat and unlocked the bankHe opened the door passed out closedand locked it and started up Marketstreet but stopped in a saloon anddowned a bumper of brandy thenlighted a cigar and meandered on asthough he were going to quiet slumbersMeanwhile Angus Bruce had reachedthe dock The knowledge that he wasloved by Clara Hill had almost madehim happy notwithstanding the factthat she expected to change her nameto Loyd within 24 hours He knewJohn- Loyd well in fact Loyd was hisbanker and he had fully determinedto talk to bim plainly and at once believing that if he knew that Clara wedhim only at her fathers bequest antTrMte another -held possession of herIt4He rushed backItov tiv-heart that he himself would decline theunionHe argued that Clara not loving thebanker he would thus save her from alife of unhappiness and perhaps thebanker also and in time perhaps evenhe the pilots son might call Clara HillwifeWith these thoughts in his brain hehastened ashore and in the direction ofthe Loyd mansion Just as he turnedthe corner within one block of the househe encountered Herbert LathropWhat Captain Bruce it gives mepleasure to see you you are going tomy unclesI was Mr Lathrop but it is ratherlate for calls I am the bearer of a letter from Miss Hill to the bankers daughter perhaps it is best that you deliverit though I promised to do so in person and besides there is a business matter on which I wish to see Mr LoydBy all means come do not be recreant to your duty for you can seethem both and if you do not see themto night you will probably never seeMiss Loyd again as she will to-morrownight become Mrs Clarence Hillwhile my uncle at the same time willbe wedded to Miss Clara and after thatI do not think you will see him soonThey will probabty be absent for sixmonths on a wedding tripSo Angus accompanied Herbert tothe house he unlocked the front doorand they

England in numbers while in efficiency and fighting qualities the Frenchships are fully equal to their Englishrivals In f act in naval architecture theFrench early took the lead and manyof the English types of ships were modeled after the French designs says TheCbautauquan One of the chief differences between the English and theFrench armored ships today is in thedisposition of the armor and the consequent design of the hull English designers have striven to protect the menworking the guns and to do this theyhave reduced the length of the shipsarmor French and naval architects onthe other hand have given little attention to the protection of men and a greatdeal to the protection of the water lineTherefore they have reduced the breadthof the ships armorIt is worthy of note that France isthe only great power which levies a taxon such of her citizens as either donot enlist in the standing army or whenlist for a shorter term than threeyears Only those who are officially declared impecunious are exempt fromsuch a tax It is payable annually aslong as the liability to service lasts andthe revenue from this source amounts toabout 30000000 francs or 6000000annuallyThe officers of the French army receive a very thorough education at thedifferent military schools At the headof these although not exclusively military stands the Polytechnic school illParis which admits 150 pupils annuallyafter a competitive examination Thecourse occupies nine months in the yearfor two yearsAs it is impossible to keep under armsfor three years the entire annual contingent of recruits the law

termed puritanicalsaid a New Yorker who has been inLondon a good deal but English people who consider themselves very proper do things sometimes which wouldshock people of a similar sort in thiscountry For instance even clergymenoften play cards for money and womendo so as a matter of course I neverplayed a game at an English house atwhich there was not a stakeThe stake was small if women wereamong the players and possibly only afew shillings changed hands but itnever seemed to occur to any Englishpeople I ever met to play for fun Thepeople were of the middle class whichis anything but fastFancy an American clergyman playing cards for money I He would be considered a bad lot by many if he playedcards even for fun And certainly ayoung woman who arose from a cardtable with a dollar more or less of amans money in her possession wouldbe considered fast to say the leastNew York SunBurned ThemHe is a Bath Me clergyman andof course somewhat unacquainted withnew fangled

born behind bars but it knew it had-wings-And it felt God had meant it for happierthingsAnd it sang of the joys that it never hadknownOf fetterless flights over fields flowerstrewnOf the green of the forest and gold of thewheatOf the thrill in the tree bough touched byits feetOf the feel of a lily leaf brushed by itsbreastAnd the splash of a raindrop caught on itscrestIt sang of the beauty the rapture of flyingThe palpitant air to its heartbeats replyingNaught over naught under save limitlessblueAnd the music of wing strokes rhythmicand trueIt sang and men said that its song wasgoodBut not one understoodThen they brought in a wildbird entrapped- in a snareAnd -a day -and a night held it prisonerthereAd a night and a day unbelieving distraughtV ith impossible fate for its freedom itjr - foughthough it bled at the breast blindly beating the barsAs if strength of cresire should force wayto the starsAnd men pitied and said It was free itslife longWho could bid it endure but a day of such- wrongAnd they flung wide the doors and thebird flashing throughSwept away like a leaf in a gale from theirviewThen the other behind the closed bars ofits fateOnce again sang its heart out its need cocreateOf the broad and the boundless In pas-sionate songEt besought men to right for one day itslifes wrongTo bestow for a day or for one only hourThe leave to make proof of its God givenpowerfor one hour only to float on free wingsIn the world where its soul lived the worldof best thingsOf commensurate effort and gain of desireUnlinked from despair mounting higherand higherTill lost in attainment the world of clearvisionsTrue measures high alms andmeled decisionsThe world God had made it for So itssong roseEcstatic tumultuous thrilled with wildwoesAnd delicious complainings

CROCKERWhen Miss Penelope Owens made upher mind to do a thing it was as goodas done Few things were surer of be-done and well done than those towhich she applied her resolution andso it happened that because she was sitting on the front porch of her prettyrose covered cottage one hot summerday leisurely rocking and reading fromtime to time bits from a current magazine and because so sitting she lookedup the street and saw advancing towardher a great solid band of sheep a plancame into her head which proved an important factor in her lifee mass of woolly bleating thingsca sweeping onward past the prettycollage sending clouds of California3 ust over the cypress hedge upon thebefs of scarlet verbenas and into Missie dopes very face but Miss Penelopenever moved Her soft eyes full of compassion gazed out upon that patientplodding throng of creatures and alook of pain swept across her face asthe poor things tried eagerly to cateha mouthful of the fresh green grasswhich formed Miss Penelopes well keptborder just outside the path Thehorseback rider urged them on and onthey huiuied huddling their fleecydust brownbackstogether till it seemedas though one might walk across thatliving flood Behind the great flockcame the usual accompaniment thewagon in which the lame and exhaustedsheep were carried by the herdersand as Miss Penelope looked one faltered and fell rose feebly and waspicked up and placed in the wagon withthe othersWhen the last cloud of dust had settled Miss Penelope smiled to herselfan odd little smile Its a queer thingto do maybe but its no ones businessbut my own and if I choose to do missionary work in front of my own houseinstead of away off in heathen landsIm going to do itMiss Penelope took the live oclockcar into the city and visited a certainplace of business on a bustling streetheld a half hours conference with theproprietor looked over numerous catalogues talked prices and then took herdeparture Not for home however Toan uptown office in a great block shenext made her way then as the summer twilight was gathering sought hercorner and waited for her carMiss Penelopes life was lonely Something seemed always lacking to make itquite complete She would not admitit even to herself tor the owner of thatresolute mouth and chin and that firmindependent way could never confessthat auglit was lacking to make hercomfort complete She was not richonly comfortably fixed as theneighbors said Her father dying afew years before had left her the neatlittle cottage and the fruit orchard behind it which supplied not only her butmany of the neighbors with choice fruitFor Miss Penelope was nothing if notneighborly although there was alwaysa certain dignity and reserve about herthat forbade the approach of the toofamiliar People wondered why thisiresh faced woman of 40 was still anld maid She must have had a disappointment they said though Miss Pen-v-loneoold least likely of Svomen toliavehadset inftr1iV8tOne morning a great dray drawn byfour horses toiled along the dusty roadand pulled up at the little white gateunder Miss Penelopes cypress archNeighbors began to wonder and conjecture and to neglect the cooking of theirnoonday meals when Miss Penelopesblue sunbonnet having duly peered overinto the wagon and inspected its contents withdrew into the house and themen who had come with the dray beganto lift and tug at the queer long stonesomething in the wagonOld Mrs Green peered through theblinds of the next house and called outexcitedly Mariar come here thisminute I do believe Miss Penelopeswent and had her own coffin made or asarcophagus or somethinVBut Maria leaning interestedly overthe old ladys shoulder said Pshawmother taint no such thing Looksa heap more like a watering trough tomejiVnd so in course of time it proved tobe Just like one of her queer notions said one But itll be a blessinto poor dumb brutes just the samesaid another and a third neighbor declared that nothing on earth couldtempt her to have a public wateringtrough put up in front of her houseThe men within a mile aroundthought it was just the thing and began to wonder why they hadnt takenup a collection and got one themselveslong agoBut when in a few days a handsomeiron drinking fountain was brought outfrom the city and set up at one end ofthe long stone trough and a brighttincup was chained i hereto people saidWell Miss Penelope does beat all fordoin deeds of mercyAnd the lady in question sitting onher vine wreathed porch said to herself as she watched the thirst- schoolchildren stopping on their way homefrom school in the hot summer afternoons I really couldnt spare thatl50 very well but I can do without thenew matting I was going to get andIm going to make over my best dressand pinch along awhile to make up forit and the dollar a month extra watertax wont be very much Anyhow Imgoing to enjoy itAnd she did enjoy it What a pleasureit was the next time a band of sheepcame through to see the thirsting creatures crowd and push around the lowstone trough full to the brim with clearcold water and how eagerly the jadedhorses drooped their heads forward tothe welcome draught And no less satisfied was she to see the dusty shepherdslift awkwardly their wide sombrerosas they dismounted and caught aglimpse of her before they drank cupful after cupful from the iron fountainAll this filled Miss Penelopes queersoul with intense satisfaction Whoso giveth a cup of cold water shethought to herself maybe its just asmuch a deed of mercy as to send moneyto the heathenOne morning Miss Penelope as washer custom worked among her flowersdigging around the rose tree with hersharp little hoe turning up the earthwith her trowel and tying up a saggingvine here and there Suddenly shelieard down the road the unmistakable herald of an approaching herd of cattle the confused lowing of a hundredplunging and plodding cows mingled with the whistles and peculiarcries and calls of the attendant cowboyswho in wide felt sombreros and picturesque attire rode at each side of themoving mass of tossing horns andrough coated bodiesMiss TPenelope dropped her gardentools and went up the steps of the porchIt was the way she paid herself forthe expense and trouble of setting upthe drinking place this quiet enjoyment of hers in the eagerness and satisfaction of the poor creatures wearywith the travel of many miles over dustyroadsAs she sat thus looking out acrossthe cypress hedge upon the surgingcrowd of cattle a panic stricken childpushed open the gate and ran up thewalk Oh Miss Penelope she criedout shrilly let me come where youare Im afraid of the cowsMiss Fenelope rose and went downthe steps How womanly and tendershe looked as she reached a hand downto the little girl and smiled reassuringly The cattle were crowding aroundthe long stone trough and a dark eyedweather bronzed cowboy leaned fromhis mustang and helped himself to adrink from the fountain As he did sohe heard the childs frightened cry andsaw the pretty womanly little pictureAs he drank he studied the womansface furtively from the shadow of hiswide sombrero and n sudden look ofwonder seemed to come into his deepeyes But he assisted the others inkeeping the struggling herd under control and finally after all were satisfiedhelped to start them moving again ina wide dark stream of hoofs and hornsbroad red backs and switching tailsdown the dusty road Then with aword to the cowboy nearest him heturned his horse and rode back to thefountainAs Miss Penelope standing at thegate with Hie child glanced up at himhe lifted his sombrero and sprang fromhis saddle Beg pardon madam hebegan courteous- but I wan t to thankyou for the great privilege we have enjoyed Its a rare thing in California tofind a watering place along the roadYoure entirely welcome Im sureresponded Miss Penelope cordiallyTliiv was nothing new Dozens ofgrateful passers by InuTpaused to thankher for providing such refreshment forman and beast and it was onty a simpleact of courtesy in this particular cowboy to do the same So she wondered alittle why he did not take his departure now that his errand was donePerhaps he enjoyed the shade of themighty fig tree which spread its greatlimbs and dense foliage far out over thefountain and into the streetWhy should he look at her so Whydidnt he go Oh whom didbe looklike end who was he T --- At -that moment her startled - eyesTHE LIFE OF A CLAMCurious Scmiparasltlc ExistenceQMcaught sight of a long red scar acrosathe mans forehead for his head wasbared and in another instant she

Markham is it youor am I dreamingYou are not dreaming Nellie theman replied as quietly it is HoraceMarkham and this is Nellie Owens cometogether at last in this strange wayMiss Penelope suddenly lost her holdupon herself and began to cry a softnervous sobbing cry and murmuredsomething brokenly which the strangeraccepted as an invitation to come in Sohe tied the tared mustang to the ringin the fig trees trunk and followedMiss Penelope into the house while theopen mouthed child went on her wayschoolward stopping often to walkbackward a few steps and wonder atwhat she had seenBut old Mrs Green

clams body is completely enshrouded in the mantle except for twoopenings through one of which thefoot can be pushed out The otheris for the siphon or what is commonlyknown as the neck of the clam Insome respects the clam may be betteroff than we are for he has a little brainin his foot and also a gland for secreting strong fibers With this he spinsa byssus by which he can attach himself to whatever he likes He does notseem to have to search for food butwaits for it to come to him He makesa burrow in the mud or sand attaching himself to the bottom by the byssus Then he thrusts his siphon uptrough the mud and water until itreaches the surface The siphon ismade up of two tubes the water flowing in through one and out through theCitherWhen the inflowing current ladenwith minute plants and animals reachesthe gill chamber some of these are sifted out and retained for food while thewater and waste matter flow outthrough the other tubeThe clams eggs are carried by themother on her gills When there arefish in the water with them the motherclam discharges the eggs which soonhatch but if there are no fish theycarry the eggs until they decay Thereason of this strange behavior is thisWhen the eggs are set free in the water they soon hatch and the little onesswim about until they find some fish towhich to attach themselves They livefor a time on the mucus of the fishand then

early lambs for market is tomature a fine animal of good size andcondition as early as possible Earliness and good weight are the two principal items to be secured and careshould be taken to secure these asrapidly and as economical as possibleOne important item is to give thelambs an early start The first few daysis the most important time and if byneglect it is stunted at this time noafter treatment will entirely overcomethe effects It should be kept warm anddry and the dam should be fed andcared for in a way that will best enableLer to supply plenty otgood milkWhen the ewes are fed liberally withground feed and the troughs are of suficient length to admit of the Jambs eating by the side of their dams the lambswill learn to eat when very youngWhenever they have learned to eatfairly well a separate place should beprovided for them where they can befed by themselves This place shouldbe arranged so that the lambs can runin and out at will They should be fedin this pen at least twice a day Wheatbran chopped feed oil meal combinedwith corn meal makes a good combinationWhile it is an item to feed liberallyit can hardly be said to be a good planto keep feed before them all the timeThe quicker they can be taught toeat and the better they are fed the better growth it will be possible to secureand the less drain it will be upon theewesBy feeding the ewes liberally so thatthey can supply plenty of milk andfeeding the lambs liberally a quickgrowth can be readily maintained andusuaJly the earlier they are ready formarket and the better their conditionthe higher price

becarefully handled to make a good income yet many farmers are learningthat there is more on 0 acres than formerly on a quarter section The 20acre farm is destined to be the futurehome of independent Men who attempt more than this will be speculators with the chances for or againstsuccess according to the market fluctuations The day of speculations in farming has passed and the man who seeksa comfortable home must produce someof everything possible on the verysmallest areaA 20 acre farm might be divided intoseven very convenient lots The houseand lawn should occupy one acre andbe inclosed bj a neat picket -or wirefence One acre should be fenced separate and kept for a garden The barnyard and corral need occupy but oneacre An orchard of five acres with asmall corner cut out for a poultryhouse would be sufficient Three acressown to grass to be cut each season forhay would yield an abundance A similar tract of three acres fenced

and root cropsThe products of six acres under cultivation in the west where irrigation ispracticed may safely be estimated asfollows Two acres of wheat 100 bushels one acre of corn 50 bushels oneacre of oats 70 bushels one half acreof potatoes 150 bushels one quarteracre of beans 15 bushels one quarteracre of onions 100 bushels one quarteracre of barley GO bushels one acre carrots turnips and rutabagas 1000 bushels These figures are not an average inUtah where small farming is practicedThe yields are reported almost doublethe figures given in some instancesOf this six acre yield there would be asurplus of each product to sellThree acres in alfalfa will yield twocrops of hay and cne of seed The haywill average two tons an acre each cutting making 12 tons of hay A threeacre alfalfa pasture will keep two cowstwo horses 20 sheep 20 hogs with several calves The iasture and hay fieldshould be rotated each year After afew years a part of the cultivated areashould be planted to alfalfa and one ofthe grass plots plowed Fences could bemade of woven wire and be easily removed from one tract to anotherThe five acre orchard should have oneacre devoted to strawberries raspberries blackberries gooseberries and currants A half acre should be planted toabout four varieties of grapes The balance of the orchard area should containchoice trees of various fruits with theouter rows composed of nut bearingtrees These serve as a protectionagainst wind and storm and are as valuable as the fruit trees The yield uponthese several tracts cannot be estimated as so much depends upon properculture and the marketExperienced farmers in Utah whopractice intensive cultivation give thefollowing figures on yields to the acreStrawberries G00 to 1000 smallfruits 300 to S00 apples 400 to 600bushels The stone fruits produce inproportion to other varieties One manwith three acres of grapes reports anaverage yield of 650 an acre every yearThe grapes are sold green made intowine and
