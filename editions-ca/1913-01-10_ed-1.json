Mega Nets Destroyed
In his instructions to the Franklin
County Grand Jury Monday Judge
Stout stated that J. Q. Ward, execu
tive agent lor the Fish and Game
Commission of this state, and his sub
ordinates had destroyed 1,000 illegal
fish devices and traps and had saved
the state over $40,000 b.v the destruc
tion of these fish nets.
He added that during the last year
100,000 quail had been shipped out of
the state and that they brought to the
sellers 20.000. This report wa3 made
to the grand .iury to show the import
ance of preserving the fish and game
in Kentucky, as provided'by the stat
utes. Judge Stout reported also that
36,119 licenses had been issued to
hunters, bringing in more than $31,000.
He added that the law should be pre
served and enforced, which was of
greater importance than the fish and
quail, because grand juries should not
make their estimates of the law . on
the dollar basis. The pollution of the
streams by big business institutions
was condemned by Judge Stout, who
said that all business should be encour
aged, but thatjt must be done within'
the law.
Victor Bradley, appointed Common
wealth's Attorney, to fill the vacancy
created by the resignation of Rober t
Franklin, was sworn in.
