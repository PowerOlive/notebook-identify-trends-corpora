BEST
A message received by frienis
in this city from Harry S. Roche,
Jr.. in Philadelphia, announced the
death of Col. C. M. Best, at Lang
horne, Pa.. The message gave no
particulars, other than Col. Bes:'s
death was very sudden, as he had
apparently been in the best ..of
health.
Col. Best was one of the best
known educators in the South. He
was sixty-two years old. He and
Mrs. Best, who was formerly Miss
Maggie Botts, of Pennsylvania,
moved to Millersburg from Win
chester, Pa., in 1S93, and purchased
the old Kentucky Wesleyan College,
which they remodeled and opened
as the Millersburg Military Insti
tute. The institution was an im
mediate success, and in the inter
vening years it graduated hun
dreds of young men who have since
become prominent in the business
and piofessional world.
Two years ago, due to ill-health.
Col. Best disposed of the property,
and with his wife and nephew,
Harry S. Roche, Jr., went to Lang
horne, Pa., where they purchased a
farm.
Col. Best is survived by his wid
ow, two sisters, Mrs. Yates, of
Washington, D. C, and Mrs. Hazel-
mic, ul Aiugion. va., and one
brother living in Oklahoma. Col.
Best was a graduate of the Vir
ginia Military Insitute at Lexing
ton, Va., and of Johns-Hopkins In
stitute, at Baltimore, Maryland.
CRIME BAX1ED UT JAPANESE
..NEWSPAPERS
Japan's police, in investigating
crime, believes that the publica
tion of facts may assist the crimi
nal to escape. Several cases have
occurred recently where the news
papers have published the facts
about murders only to to be told
after it had all been in print that
no further reference should be made
to the crime. Newspapers which
in such circumstances are closely
watched, have come out with blank
columns, the police having at the
last moment ordered news of the
event to be suppressed.
A lot of folks think that harmony
is easy. All they want is all the
other folks to agree with them.
At, any rate, you can't deny the
fact that the telephone girl tries
to have good connections.

At the grave Rev. Eberhardt de-
llivered a short but feeling eulogy
m memory of the; woman whose
earthly tenement had been consie-n-
'ed to its last resting place, and
sang a beautiful solo. Touching se
lections were rendered by a ouar-
'tette composed of Mrs. Edward F.

Miss Holladay was a consistent
member v of the Paris Baptist
church, a .beautiful Christian char
acter, whose kindly -influence was
reflected in her everyday life. Of a
friendly and amiable disposition,
she found pleasure in radiating hap
piness and good cheer and found" a
cordial welcome wherever she went.
Her life was gentle, but , like the
still waters, was deep. In ber
beart of hearts she carried those
she loved, and her hand was never
weary, her step never failed in
ministering ninto, caring for, wait
ing upon those who were in any
way brought within reach of her
help.
Job was a patient man but he
never ran a nail in a front tire just
as he was backing out of the gar-
