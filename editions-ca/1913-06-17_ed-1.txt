None of the members of thehousehold were disturbed by the intruders. The burglary was rsported to thepolice department Friday morningand Patrolman Fred Link went tothe home of Mr. Redmon, where hemade a survey in an attempt to get aclue that would lead to the apprehension of the guilty party. PatrolmanLink, in company with" William Smithwent to the Paris cemetery where theformer found the pocketbook lying inthe grass.An examination revealed the notesintact and one twenty dollar bill,which. had been overlooked.

At that time it was almost impossible to get hands and teams sufficient to harvest the immense crop,but this year there is an abundance ofboth. It is estimated that the shrinkage in the cured products will amountclose to 50 per cent, as against anaverage waste of 25 to 40 per cent.This increase in shrinkage is due tothe undergrowth weeds and whiteclover.Green seed is selling at about 45ftB1Summer GoodsOur Stock of Wash Materials for Summer Suits, Dresses,Skirts and Coats comprise all the new weaves and coloringsRatines Linens PiquesCordalines Crepe VoilesWith trimming suitable for same.Ready-to-Wear GarmentsGingham and White Dresses for Misses and Children.White ''and Colored Washable Suits, Dresses and Skirts. for Ladies and Misses,. : For Your Summer Trip " ;V; Tryone of our Trunks or lSuit CasesWOOLEN SUITSWe have on hand about twenty five Suits all thisSpring's styles, mostly small sizes.

The report also speaks ofthe catarrhal fever, which is prevalentand fatal among horses in all sectionsof the State.Lack of rain in the extreme westernpart and the excessive moisture inthe central and eastern portions arethe only drawbacks to crop conditions.The report follows:"The May crop report is issued onan entirely different basis from anyprevious report. During the last winter based on the 1910 census, theState had been divided into nine cropreporting districts and each districtgiven a percentage weight in proportion to the. yield of that crop in thatdistrict when compared with the totalyield of the State. This is the nlangoverning crop reporting for the Federal uovernmenE. There are now theseparate sets of reporters reporting inthis same way to three separate heads.We believe this wil give us a more accurate summary of crop conditionsthan the State has ever yet gotten out."The splendid prospects for a goodcrop May 1, have been generally maintained to Junel. A irreat deal of complaint come from Western Kentucky ofiacK or moisture. Central and EasternKentucky suffered from the samecause during the first of the month,and have suffered from an excessiveamount of moisture during the latterpart of May. However, most of thecrops are in good condition relatively speaking. Wheat shows conditionof 85.7 per cent, and is filling well.The corn crop is not all planted, butther is an indicated crop of 94.5 percent. The condition of planted cornis 90.8 per cent. The oats crop 89.4per cent, and condition 79.4 per cent.The condition of rye is 56.4 per cent.It will be noted that an early drouthaffected the rye nd oats crop considerably. The same is true of timothy.Thee ondition of potatoes is given as93.1 per cent., indicating a splendidcrop."About 52.8 per cent, of an averagecrop of dark tobacco has been transplanted, which shows condition of 81.7per cent.; 57.5 per cent of the Burley crop was transplanted by 'June 1,with condition of 81 per cent. The tobacco plant in the dark district are reported small and scarce, indicating ashortage in the crop, while in the Burley district they are reported in splendid condition and plentiful. Excessiverains have 'occurred throughout theState since the first of June, and everyprospect is for an average planting ofBurley and a fairly large crop of dark.Many complain of cut worms both fortobacco and corn. The blue grass oc3 1crop will be a short one. The condition of grasses is given as: Bluegrass, 88.6 per cent; clover 81 percent.; alfalfa, 80 per cen., and orchardgrasses, 84 per cent. The drouth hasaffected pastures in Western Kentucky, but in Central and. EasternKentucky the pastures are good."Cattle are reported in good condition ;, hog cholera is not so bad as inthe winter months, and the conditionof sheep and lambs is unusually eoorl.! Young poultry has done well and thereis a splendid crop of young chickens.ens urkeys and other fowls."The condition of apples is 85 percent; peaches, 78.5 per cent.; pears,61 per cent.; plums, 67 per cent; cherries, 64.5 per cent.: srraDes. 89 tiercent. The strawberrv nron 1ms hour,fairly good. Raspberries will be amedium crop. There is every promise for one of the alrgest blackberrycrops the State has ever had."There is a disease known as catarrhal fever or "pink eye" amonghorses of several counties. The disease is proving: fatal in manv instnnppsand farmers are warned against takinganimais into towns where the diseaseis known to exist and against workingthem if the animals once become infected. This department has on handdirections for handling this malady,a bulletin prepared by the State Veterinarian, Dr. Robert Graham, and directions for disinfecting infected'istables. These will be sent free upon Iapplication to the department.mere has been a large corn cropplanted, the stand is almost perfect,and farmers are urged to try shallowand frequent cultivation for the coming season. The old idea that three or ,iuui piuwmgs were sumcient to makea corn crop should be abandoned, and,if possible, plow five or six or seventimes, but plow shallow. The farmer can very nearly coun on getting anextra barrel of corn forN every extraplowing he gives his corn. If it isonly a bushe lit will nearly pay itscost."DECISION REVERSED.The Supreme Court has reversed adecision of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, v.iicn neia that a railroad is Iwholly i:ai)le for accidents when en-1pjoyos sre workins overtime TimHigher four? held that &uch cases slan-1only on :neir merits ir civil actions.PRIMARYELECTIONVANCED.CASE AD-Thpprimary election law cases appealt'd from the Jefferpon Circuit Courtwhich up'ieM the pnyusion requiring acandidate to state that he supportedat the last election the party whosecandidate he is seeking to become,were advanced for argument in theCourt of Appeals and set for today.DANVILLE BABY KILLED BY RATSThe four-months-old baby of Mrs.Lena Pope, of Danville, was killed byrats Tuesday night.

Thefly travels only 1,500 feet anddelights in a liquid diet. Whenhe finds something that he likesbetter than his latest meal hedisgorges.One pair of flies beginning inMay will breed 143,675 bushels bySeptember. The time will comewhen it will be considered moredisgraceful to have flies in ourhomes than it is now to havebedbugs.If flies were as large as cowswe would not have one in theland. Unfortunately our indifference to their disease breedingactivities is as large as the peststhemselves are small.The extermination of the flywill follow the observing of theold rule that CLEANLINESSIS NEXT TO GODLINESS.&$&i4&$$&&$&-dFACTS ABOUT FLIES.Flies innUe milk impure.Flies do nothing but harm.Flies ate wholesale murderers.Flies bring summer complaintFlies cause epidemics of disease.Flies do not belong in this town.Flies find nothing too filthy to eat.Flies spread the hookworm disease.Flies kill 100,000 people in this conn-I try every year.Flies carry death about on their hairylegs and. wings.Flies cost the United States $300,- J000,000 annually.Flies are responsible for the majorityof deaths among children.&&b&&b&$&&i$THE CLEANUP CURE.VERYsinglefly in anouse is adanger to thehealth andeven to theA lives of theo c c u pants.People do notrealize this.For a fly todrop into ajug of milkand to crawl"cooked or uncooked, is such a commonplaceand simple thing that we do notrealize the danger of it.But if we could follow up thelife of a fly for a single day weshould be appalfed at the filthiness of its habits and the pestilential character of its peregrinations. Flies love the vilest filth, andthey are attracted alike to thesweetest and daintiest of foodstuffs. Just as in the house nofly can be kept away from thefood, so outdoors no garbage orfilth or decaying matter is everseen in the summer without itsattendant flies. It can be takenfor granted that, every fly in ahouse has but recently comefrom reveling in the vilest filthto be found in the neighborhood.It is well known that flies multiply in exact proportion o theamount of garbage and filth in alocality. In a locality ttyat iskept tidy and clean and sweetthere are very few flies, butwherever filth exists there fliesmultiply by myriads.

T. Hinton was inducted into office a little more than three years.The reduction in the tax rate comesafter careful and considerate calculations made upon the report of theBoard of Tax Supervisors, who filedtheir report several days ago andwhich were in the hands of MayorHinton and Councilman W. O. Hinton.The tax-payers of the city can becongratulated upon having an administration so conservative and painstaking in the affairs of the city finances,and which as financiers of markedability, can readily observe the bestinterests of the tax-payers.When Mayor Hinton went into officethe tax rate of the city was $1.45 oneach $100 worth of taxable -propertyin the city and since that time therelias been an annual reduction of fivecents until the present rate has beenreached. Mayor Hinton has materially increased each year the allowancefor school purposes and in the faceof the reduction o the present levy often cents made for this purpose besides an additional levy of five centsfor the Massie Memorial Hospital.During bis term of office MayorHinto has insisted upon the city bearing the cost of the construction of newstreets and additional sewer service,Ihtsead of compeling the property owners to bear the extra expense. Thislas all been done without interferingIn the least with the financial conditionof the city and demonstrates that bywise and economical methods a citythe size of Paris can be conducted ata less expense than the tax-payershave been heretofore compelled to"bear.Councilman W. O. Hinton, at thelast meeting of Council reported theTax Supervisors had made their report and recommended that a levy of31.25 be made upon each $100 worthcf taxable property in the city, whichlie said would be sufficient to meetthe demands made upon the city'streasury, in view of the fact tliatthe licenses for the ensuing year had"been paid and with the cash in handa little of the tax-payers' burden couldbe lifted.During the past three years of MayorBinton's administration, numerous-streets have been constructed, thebeauty of the city otherwise improved and conveniences for the inhabitants added. This has all been donewithout 'extra expense to the tax-payersand the present reduction in thelevy is most commendable.The rate as fixed by the council is asfollows: General purposes, 55c; cityschools, 35 cents; public library, 5-cents; Massie Hospital, 5 cents;sinking fund, 25 cents. Total, $1.25.L NOTESBUCKLEY SCHLUND.The marriage of Mr. Clyde Buckley, of Williamstown, Ky., and MissBmma Schlund, of Los Angeles, Cal.,vill he solemnized at the home ofthe bride's parents in Los Angeles, onWednesday, June 18.Mr. Buckley is a son of Mr. B.

Eventhe bonanza farmers of the once-virginprairies now begin to share inthese discussions. Unquestionablyfarmers who are organized can profitby purchasing the separate ingredients and mixing them at home. Socan they profit by pooling their purchase of mixed goods, if intelligentdiscrimination is used by the buyer.The greatest gain coming to farmers by practising home mixing for aseason or two, at least, is their becoming familiar with different gradesof fertilizer and getting a clear comprehension of the sources of themost important kinds of plant-food.The farmer who has never studiedout the matter of home, mixing as arule feels satisfied with brands ofready-mixed fertilizer analyzing toolow to give the fullest value from itsuse. Uranus snowing :.z nave a,very different meaning from a 3:7:10'brand, after a farmer has mixed hisown fertilizer a few times. Homemixing is to be recommended as aneducational influence, if for no otherreason. After a farmer becomes com-'petent to mix his own fertilizer, he isready to purchase ready-mixed goodsdiscriminatingly, if it seems desirable !to do so.Graduating Gifts.We have a beautiful selection ofgraduating gifts, such as books, fancypicture frames, etc. Come in and lookthem over.6tf ' PARIS BOOK STORE.PLAYING TRICKSON THE MONARCH.On the first consignment of seidlitzpowders in the capital of Delhi themonarch became deeply interested inthe accounts of the refreshingdraught.

It was then explainedthat in the combination of the twopowders lay the luxury, and thetwelve white powders were quicklydissolved and as eagerly swallowedby His Majesty.With a wild shriek that will be remembered while Delhi is numberedamong the kingdoms, the monarchrose, staggered, exploded, and in hisfull agonies, screamed, "Hold medown!" then, rushing from the throne,fell prostrate on the floor.There he lay during the long-continuedaffervescence of the compound,spurting like 10,000 pennyworth ofImperial pop, and believing himself in'the agonies of death a melancholy( and humiliating proof that kings arei mortal.Anybody CanII.

Flourspar, another Kentuckyproduct, has been kept dutiable at$1.50 a ton, one half of the prevailingrate of $3, assessed in the Payne bill.The House draft of the Tariff Billput a duty of ?lf.20 a ton on hemp, areduction from the Payne Jaw, whichtaxed it at $22.50. But. the Senate subcbmmittee has free-listed it, along withother products of the farm.A decade ag o this change wouldhave been a material one for Kentucky. Then, hemp-growing was aflourishing industry, but of late yearstobacco has almost entirely superseded it, and only one or two plantations bear important hemp crops.Nevertheless Kentucky produces 55per cent, of the hemp crop of theUnited States, and therefore the chiefeffect of free listing the fiber will' befelt in Kentucky, mainly the Bluegrasssection.When the House committee was holding hearings on the Underwood bill,Hon. C. M. Thomas, of this city, fileda brief in behalf of Kentucky hempproducers, asking that the rate of$22.50 in the Payne law be maintained. This rate the committee reducedto $11.20, however, although Chairman Underwood personally considered $22.50 a reasonable duty, in view ofthe competitive conditions abroad.When the Senate committee came toconsider hemp, they put it in a groupalong with the other farm productsand declared there was nol egitimatoreason for exempting hemp, whenwheat, oats, flour and meats weregoing on the free list.As for flourspur, the cutting in halfof its present duty of $3 a ton wasdone over the protests of producers inWestern Kentucky, who say that theywill have great difficulty now in competing with the English spar, which ismined without effort from great pilesof waste lying beside the old tin mines.The Kentucky spar, on the contrary,must be mined with great effort, andthe freight rate on it to the steel- producing center is as large and largerthan the rate on English spar acrossthe ocean.w 'SMHHKBttGflBHEHK&ra9I Mm i sweep!CK ID FARM illIOF CARPETS, RUGS, MATTINGS jAND LINOLEUMS.Now For Your Spring Qesmnfxl2 Wiltana Seamless Velvet Bug$35.G0,now $25.00jx12 Axminster Rugs, $32.00now v- -j 22.509 xl2 Seamless Brussels Rug, S20.GQ,now A lA.TSxlO Crcx Rugs, 12.00,now 9.00- The largest single purchase ol Icattle ever made by an Evansville,Iud., buyer, was put through Tuesday jwhen the Union Stock Yards at thatplace got 000 head of distillery mash-,fed cattle from Kentucky owners.

Mr. G. H. Harris, rector of St.Peter's Episcopal Church, of Paris,has been in attendance upon the Annual Council of the Episcopal Churchin the Diocese of Lexington, whichwas held in St. John's Church, Versailles, on Tuesday, Wednesday andThursday. Several members of theParis congregation also attended,among them Mrs. Laura Wiggins andi Mrs. Nellie Highland, who took partin the meetings of the Woman Auxiliary. There was a very large attendance of delegates and visitors.The Council sermon was preachedTuesday night by the Very Rev. R.K. Massie, D. D., Dean of ChristChurch Cathedral, Lexington, his subject being, "The Distinctive Contribution of Our Church lo the ReligiousLife of the Day." The WoodfordSun thus comments on the sermonand the preacher: "The fine spirit ofthis sermon, its breadth and clearness, commended it no less to thoseof other folds than to Episcopalians.It was an able sermon by an ableMmail.weanesaay mgnt Margaret uonegeentertained the clergyrlay delegates,visitors and members of St. John'sparish at a delightful dinner, at theconclusion of which excellent shortaddreses were made by Rev. J. M.Maxon, Hon. J. N. Camden, Mr. A.D. Cole, of Maysville, and Rev. J.M. Magruder, of Trinity Church, Covington. Bishop Burton was the toastmaster. The practical issue of thisdinner and the speeches was the formation of an organization .under theenthusiastic leadership of Mr. J. N.Camden, which all feel will result ina, much wider and stronger supportof the College:Wednesday morning was largely devoted to the elections. The followingwere chosen deputies to the GeneralConvention, which is to meet in NewYork next October: Rev. J. M. Maxonand Mr. J. N. Camden, of Versailles;Rev. J. M. Magruder and Mr. W D.Spalding, of Covington; Very Rev. R.K. Massie and Mr. John T. Shelby, ofLexington; Rev. G. H. Harris, of, Paris; and Mr. A. D. Cole, of Maysvilje. Among the things done by theCouncil perhaps that which is of themost general interest and significanceis the action which it took in thecause" of eugenics. Dean Massieoffered a resolution which was unanimously adopted and which bringsthe Episcopal Church in the Dioceseof Lexington into line with the forward movement which this Churchhas led in Chicago and in other partsof the land in respect of this matter.The resolution is as follows:"Resolved, that it is the sense ofthe Council of the Diocese of Lexington that the clergy of this diocese willbe justified in their action, if beforethey perform any marriage servicehereafter, they require of the man desiring to be married that he secure! from the family physician of the proposed bride, or from some other rep-utable physician, designated by suchsaid family physician, a certificate toj the effect that the man has no comI municable disease of immoral origin."i The deliberations of the CouncilI were presided over by the Rt. 'Rev.TO PREVENT FLIESFROM BREEDINGKeep the manure, while it is In the Istable, in a closed bin or pitScreen stables if possible.Remove the manure at least twice aweek.Every time the stalls are cleaned andthe manure placed in the pit or binsprinkle it with dry plaster ipowderedgypsum) or slaked lime.Be sure that you sprinkle the cracksand crevices of the bin or pit as wellas the cracks between the planking ofthe stall floors.If flies begin to breed in stored manure they may be killed by thoroughlyspraying it with kerosene or parisgreen and then pouring on enough water to wash the oil or poison well in.The objection to the use of keroseneis that it ruins the manure for fertilizIng purposes. A solution- of iron sulphate (one pound to a gallon), appliedat the rate of one gallon a day in astable where one horse is kept, willkill all the maggots. It costs about $1per 100 pounds, so that the cost ofkeeping flies from breeding in a onehorse stable is about 1 cent a day.It is well to abolish old fashionedouthouses where possible. Where thiscannot be done a liberal amount oflime should be used, applied in smallamounts daily. Chloride of lime isbetter than slaked lime, but slakedlime is better than none at all.Garbage cans should be thoroughlycleaned after emptying, and the contents should be sprinkled with crudeoil, lime or kerosene oil.Union Meat Marketf .
