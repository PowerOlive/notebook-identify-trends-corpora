Dr. W. G. Dailey was in Cin
cinnati, Monday, and returned in a
handsome new car.
Mr. J. W. Boulden, of Mays
ville, arrived Tuesday as the guest
of his niece, Mrs. A. S. Best.
Rev. J. D. Redd and family, of
Harrodsburg, were guests of friends
here Tuesday and Wednesday.
Mrs. Robert Bissett and little
son have returned to their home at
Maysville, after a week's visit to
relatives here.
Mr. W. D. Mclntyre left Mon
day for Anderson, Ga., for a two
weeks' visit. Mrs. Mclntyre has
"been visiting relatives there for sev
eral weeks, and will return with
him.
The heavy rains on Tuesday
brought Hinkston out of its banks
again, and "Wednesday traffic was
cut off on the Maysville pike south
of town. However, the water suffici
ently receded to resume traffic
Thursday morning. Many of the
homes along1 the creek were endan
gered, but no serious damage was
done.
The store of Mrs. J. H. How
ard, in Judyville, was entered by
burglars Monday night, and quite a
number of shoes, sweaters, tobacco
and other articles were stolen. One
of the front windows was taken
out, and set against the fence on the
opposite side of the pike. Thus far
there is no clue. Mr. Howard's loss
will amount to several hundred dol
lars. The protracted meeting, which
has been in progress at the Chris
tian church, for the past two weeks,
will probably close to-night. It has
been a good meeting and enjoyed by
all who attend. Elder Crouch is a
forcible and logical speaker, is well
informed on Biblical subjects, and
has a ready flow of language at his
command. There were several ad
ditions to the church.
The banks, postoffice and most
of the business houses were closed
Thanksgiving day, as were the
schools. The Thanksgiving services
were conducted at Christian church.
The sermon was preached by Rev.
W. P. Crouch, pastor of the Carlisle
Christian church, who is conduct
ing a protracted meeting here at
this time. The sermon was good,
full of patriotism and in keeping
with the occasion. A good musical
program was also rendered.
The Means-Anderson Company,
of the Redpath Lyceum Bureau,
opened a Lyceum course here at the
M. C. Auditorium, Tuesday at 8:15
p. m. The course heing under the
auspices of the four churches.
Notwithstanding the inclement
weather a large and appreciative au
dience was in attendance! The com
pany -was good, the reader and im
personator is well up in her work,
as is also the violinist and vocalist.
Each was the recipient of numerous
encores, and the company was lib
eral in its response. The audience
would have been much larger had it
not been for the weather. The
churches have already realized
about $300, although they have not
yet enough to cover the. expenses of
the course. However, this will be
done. -The next number-will be Fri
day evening, Dec. 5. See next issue
for further exulanation.

HELEN STANLEY IN CONCERT
AT LEXINGTON OPERA HOUSE
Hardly has an operatic star of
long experience in a wide range of
twenty-three first roles in leading
opera companies in this country and
abroad deliberately put aside for
the time an operatic position of une
quivocal success for the sole pur
pose of developing exclusively the
intellectual side of art, as did Madam
Helen Stanley, who will come to
the Lexington Opera House for the
second concert of the Artist Con
cert Series, December 3.
Madam Stanley has demonstrated
amazing versatility and has quickly
achieved a position second to none in
this higher form of vocal art. The
Chicago Herald said of Madam
Stanley: "Her yoice is of shimmer
ing gold, yet as smooth as velvet,
and in her interpretation she dis
closes Hiat she is Teaching greater
heights than ever before."
It is said that not since the time
of Madam Nordica's greatest tri
umphs has a New York audience re
vealed such intense love for an
American singer, -as was the case
at the two recent recitals of Madam
Stanley, given at the Hippodrome,
and ten days later at Carnegie Hall,
both to -capacity houses. The cloak
of that great queen of song fits well
on the shoulders of this distinguish
ed artist.
Madam Stanley will appear on the
program jointly with Ellam Zoller.
one of the leading soloists and ac
companists on the concert stage.
Seats for the Stanley-Zoller con
cert will go on sale at the Ben-Ali
Theatre, November 28. (adv)

SMITH'S aUICK ACTION
. .
Farmington, Mo., the county
seat of St. Francois county, jumped
into the spot light of the Thrift
Campaign inaugurated by the
Treasury Department of the United
States one day last week, when

Savings Certificates.
The week before State Director
of the Sales Organization of Mis
souri Dempsey, directed Field Worlr
er P. W. Buehler to visit 'Farming
ton. Buehler called on Postmaster
Smith, and the postmaster immedi
ately got busy. He sold the Certifi
cates to Arleigh G. H. Dale, Carrie
and Charles C. Hupj, all of Doe
Run, a few miles south of Farming
ton. f
Postmaster Smith's letter was as
laconic as the communication sent

ous occasion. Smith said: "Your
