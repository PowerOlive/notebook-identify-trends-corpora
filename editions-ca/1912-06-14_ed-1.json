Paris Looses by Big Score to
Colts.
Paris was defeated yesterday bv
Lexington by a Bcore of 12 to 1. The
game was a comedy of errors from the
very start and the old story of the
inability of the locals to connect with
theball. Given in detail the story of
the struggle would require a column.
The locals were at the mercy of
Camnitz from the start, and Harold,
who esseyed to pitch for Paris was
driven from the mound somewhere
about the seventh inning. Hits were
numerous and errors in such raDid suc
cess, that in the absence -of a rapid
calculator, it is doubtful if it were in
the power of the official scorer to keep
them conect, and the same also aD
plies to the error column, in which
Paris is credited with seven, while the
Colts drew nearly half that number.
It is said the Paris managemnt is
making an effort to strengthen and
that Ollie Chapman has been signed
and will be here to-day. There is a
sincere hope that this is true and that
strengthening will be in progress in
other departments before lone, par
ticularly the pitching staff.
The excellent pitching of Hauser,
coupled, with the heavy hiting of his
teammal s, won for Paris against the
Richmond aggreagtion, Tuesday after?
noon, in the latter city. The Bburbon
ites counted the victory by a score of
9 to 5. Paris was leading by three
runs when'Richmond tied the score ir
the seventh, but in the eighth and
ninth Paris got to. Myers, a former
Bourbonite, and scored four runs.
After the seventh Hauser tightened
up, and would not allow the Pioneers
another score. The local boys secured
a total of seventeen hits off of JVlyers,
each member of the team rapping him
at least once. Goodman excelled with
the stick, getting four out of five trips
to the plate, getting two two-base hits,
a single and a thee-bagger. Volz play
ed his first game with the locals," and
celebrated the occasion with one cork
ing three-hacrger and a single. Harrel
also secured a two-bagger,while Locke
cracKea out a tnree-oase drive and a
single, and scored three runs.
In revenge for the defeat of Tuesday
the Pioneers came back Wednesday
and administered a severe'drubbing to
the Bourbonites.. winning b.v a score cf
12 to 3. Errors wete frequent on the
part of the Paris men, and Blanken
ship was hit all over the lot. Two and
three-base hits came in profusion, and
in each instance with men on bases.
ThePioneers scored all their runs in
the fourth, fifth and sixth innings. In
the first four innings Black, who pitch
ed for Richmond, retired the side in
order, the first twelve men facing him
going down. Goodman led at the bat
for the locals, getting three hit3 out
of four times at bat.
