B .HUTCHCRAFT & CO.d&-tf)i itjl!!flin ir y mm m u inCOMMERCIAL CLUB ACTIVITIESSpeaking on "The Functions of aPublic School System," Prof. LeeKirkpatrick, superintendent of theParis schools, addressed the Commercial Club noon luncheon, held atthe M. E. church Tuesday. Prof.Kirkpatrick emphasized the objectives of a school, the costs of operating a school system, and the moralsupport the school deserves from thecommunity. He urged the people tovisit the school frequently and keepin .touch with the efforts of theParis teachers to give the childrenof the city the right kind of training. The luncheon was opened withcommunity singing, led by A. L.Boatright. R. F. Clendenin, .president jof the City School Board, was toastmaster at the luncheon. FollowingProf. Kirkpatrick's talk, M. P. CoUlier, a member of the playgroundscommittee of the Commercial Club,announced that Mr. Clendenin desired to donate the use of severallots in the Bourbon College property for playgrounds purposes. Theannouncement was followed by enthusiastic applause.. Prof. Kirkpatrick said in part:"The first function of the schoolis to furnish to the children the information that -will enable them tointerpret the world above them.Every-child needs their help, for themost favored child, with every advantage of inheritance and environment, starts exactly where the childof the stone age started. Just ashelpless, just as ignorant and just aspliable. But when he becomes aman, there will be required of him,if he is to take his place in the worldof his day, a variety and scope of in-,formation of skill, one of trained ability of which the cave man couldhave no conception. It is everychild's privilege to have an opportunity to function at his best in thisworld, and to pass on his social inheritance fuller and richer than hereceived it."The second function of the schoolis to make every child socially serviceable and to give him a certaindegree of economic independence.The Paris City Schools are enjoyinga splendid period of growth. Manynew courses arc being offered and itwas shown that a school must offera large variety of courses it.all-jthchildren are to be retained btfe1scnooi. .raris to-aay is holding 75,or an tne children enrolled in her.schools until they complete the eightgrades and iave a high record forHigh School attendance. This is dueto a right course of study and highlytrained teachers. Eighty-five percent, of Paris school teachers werein Summer School last summer."The school tax rate for operatingthe Paris City School this year is 75cents on tha $100.00 and will be thesame next year. With this tax ratOjthe school will pay all this year's expenses and retire $5,000.00 of theschool debt. The cost per pupil thisyear for maintaining the City Schoolwill be $38.00."The Paris school has a verystrong department of science. Three ihundred and ninety-seven studentsare taking one or more science or industrial courses. Next year it isplanned to introduce two more industrial courses. Three teachersgive practically all their time toscience. Miss Frances Butler, M. A.,Miss Edith Stivers, B. A., Miss StellaRierson, B, S. Four laboratories arenow used. The Mechancial Drawingcourse is under the directions of theState University, and is taught by ateacher who comes over from theUniversity."A number "of soliciting, advertising and stock selling schemes havebeen referred to the CommercialClub recently, and, by thorough investigation of these propositions,the people of the city have been saved a considerable amount of money.Among the most numerous class ofsolicitors are those claiming to represent charitable and religious organizations outside of the city. Although all of these are not to be condemned, some of them are out-and-outfrauds, while some are of adoubtful complexion. Recently solicitors for the Volurfteers of America,who claim to be doing religious andcharitable " work in Louisville, wereinvestigated by the Commercial Club.The Louisville Board of Trade hasmade a thorough probe of theirwork in Louisville, and, althoughtheir report has not been completed,it appears doubtful if the Board ofTrade will give them an endorsement. The Associated Charities ofLouisville have investigated this organization also, and state that, "Wohave never found them doing any social work that was really worthwhile. They raise their money bysolicitation, and pay their solicitorsfifty jper cent of what they take in,which seems to us to be a very vicious system."Solicitors for organizations suchas this are in the city almost daily,and all persons are advised by theCommercial Club to require these solicitors to get an endorsement beforemaking any donations. Such endorsements, of course, are not necessarySTATE D. A. R. CONFERENCEMiss Elizabth Grimes, Mrs. C. M.Clay, Mrs. Charlton Alexander, andMrs. Wade H. Whitley, representedJemima Johnson Chapter, D.

R. school committee, at whichthe members voted unanimously toendorse the report which was prepared for presentation to rthe Congress. Mrs. Chenault gave her report,mentioning the offers of land, moneyand support which had been receivedfrom many mountain counties, andTecommending that the school beknown as the "Kentucky D. A. R.Mountain School" and established asa memorial to the women of theRevolution.Mrs. Arnold, the Regent, called attention to the fact that her recommendation at the last State Conference was that the school be a memorial to pnen . and women who losttheir lives in. the World War.Mrs. Chenault, Mrs. Stoughton A.Fletcher and others opposed the regent's plan, saying that the WarMothers and other organizationsgrowing out of the war were planning memorials, some being inclinedto resent such action on the part ofthe D. A. R., and that a school established by the Daughters of the American Revolution should 'be a memorial to those who achieved Americanindependence.Among the counties discussed asprobable locations for the school wereLee, Floyd, Magffin, Elliott and Leslie. Mrs. Chenault read a communication from the, assistant attorneygeneral of the State, saying that thescliool could obtain the State and'county school money if the appointment and control of teachers remained in the hands of the county schoolsuperintendent and board.WOOL WANTEDwi Are nr rafeMARKET forWOOL .AND WE ARE PAYING TETHIGHES MARKET PRICEVv ."vIT WILL PAY YOU TO CALL ONUS BEFORE MAKING OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.

"Mrs MaryLister, 608 Frank Street, Adrian, Mich.v It is said that middle age is the most trying period in a woman's life, andowing to modern methods of living not one woman in a thousand passes throughthis perfectly natural change without experiencing very annoying symptoms.Those smothering spells, the dreadful hot flashes that send the blood 'rushingto the head until it seems as though it would burst, and the faint feeling thatfollows, as if the heart were going to stop, those sinking or dizzy spells are allsymptoms of a nervous condition, and indicate the need for a special medicine.Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound is a root and herb medicine especially adapted to act upon the feminine system. It acts in such a mannerasto build up the weakened nervous system and enables a woman to passthis trying period with the least possible annoying symptoms.Women everywhere should remember that most of the commoner ailmentsof women are not the surgical ones they are not caused by serious displacements or growths, although the symptoms may be the same, and that is whyso many apparently serious ailments readily yield to Lydia E. Pinkham'sVegetable Compound, as it acts as a natural restorative and often preventseerious troubles.LP liydia E.

A morbid, unjpzl, whimsical and melancholy condition of the mind, aside from thei.erousness and physical suffering, isthe usual condition of the average Idyspeptic.Dyspepsia, or indigestion, as thecase may be, is usually caused by theeat.ng of too much or unsuitable foodand the moucous membrane of thestcmach becomes irritated, and thereis set up an acute or sub-acute gastric catarrhal condition which prevents the proper digestion of thofood. This food is apt to fermentand decompose, and as a result thefamiliar distressing' symptoms ofdvsnensia may arise. In mild casesthere is nothing more than an uncomfortable feeling in the stomach,with a certain amount of depression,1headache, loss of appetite, perhapsbelching of gas and occasional vomiting. There may be also accompanying intestinal symptoms, such asconstipation, pains in the back, colic,etc. There may be only the familiarheartburn due to the inflammation ofthe stomach from excessive gases offermentation, or putrefaction. In themost severe cases those that lastover a day or two the symptoms enumerated may be much more intense.The distress may be marked and thegeneral constitutional symptomsmore evident. When this stage isTeached the loss of appetite, themental depression, and the generali uncomfortable feeling in the stomach are. much more pronounced.This is particularly true in acutegastritis.It frequently occurs from continued errors in diet, that this conditionbecomes chronic, and the symptomspersist for an. indefinite period. Theappetite is very apt to be varied,but at times very good. Heartburnis frequent, if not constant. Thestomach is painful on pressure, thetongue is coated, there is a bad tastein the mouth, and there are changesin the amount of salivary secretion.Constipation is also usually present,although diarrhoea may alternate.Most cases of dyspepsia can becured if the diet is properly lookedafter and with the proper treatment.Proper eating, the proper amount offood and hygienic living are themost important features of the treatment.
