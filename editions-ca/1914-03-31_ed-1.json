Paris, Ky March 30, 1914.
There has been -recently organized
in this city a Health League composed
of the ladies of the city. It is a most
worthy and laudable enterprise and
must necessarily require some of the
time of its members, and for the will
ingness and readiness of these public
spirited women to assume additional
burdens we should be entirely gratel
ful.
Things cleanly and beautiful appeal
to any man or woman, and they are
the embodiment of latter day thought
in dealing with municipal affairs.
They are the immediate forerunners
of the healthfulness of the community
and therefore of inestimable value.
Acting for the City Board of Health
as its secretary I desire to extend to
those engaged in this noble work an
assurance of its hearty co-operation.
We do not for an instant believe it
incumbent upon any member of the
League to make a house to house
or yard to yard inspection of proper
ties in the city. There are officers
delegated for this special work. The
City Healah Officer has a large share
in this work, and under his' direction
it is usually done.
Just at this time- the condition of
the ordinary back yards are not pre
sentable, especially, because of the
winter's accumulations. It is not the
desire of the Health Board to entail
upon the owners and occupants any
unnecessary expense, yet it its duty to
enforce the law in those cases where
there is flagrant violation.
At any time the League desires the
assistance of the Board they have
the right of request and it will be
cheerfully given. '
A. H. KELLER,
City Health Officer.

Mr. Saanley devoted practically his
entire address to abuse of the former
Governor, whom he charged with be
ing a hypocritical tool of the trusts
and a foe of the .common people of
the State, claiming thaa he (Beck
ham), according to his own views,
was the only candidate for the United
States Senatorship that was capable
and qualified.
The speaker was very biater and
sarcastic in his denunciation of Mr.
jtJecham, but denied the charge that
he was making personal attacks on
Beckham, claiming that he did not
indulge in th takind of campaigning.

"Really does" put bad stomachs in
order "really does" overcome indi
gestion, dyspepsia, gas, heartburn and
sourness in five minutes that just
that makes Pape's Diapepsin the
the world. If what you eat ferments
into stubborn lumps, you belch gas
and eructate sour, undigested food
and acid; head is dizzy and aches;
breath foul; tongue coated; your in
sides filled with bile and indigestible
waste, remember the moment Pape's
Diapepsin comes in contact with the
stomach all such distress vanishes.
It's truly astonishing almost mar
velous, and the joy is its harmless
ness. A large fifty-cent case of Pape's Di
apepsin will give you a hundred dol
lar's worth of satisfaction or your
druggist hands your money back.
It's worth its weight in gold to men
and women who can't get their stom
achs regulated. It belongs in your
home should always be kept handy
in case of a sick, sour, upst stomach
dnring the day or at night. It's the
quickest, surest and most harmless
stomach doctor in the world.
