SWIFT & CO.'S WEEKLY PRODUCE
MARKET REVIEW
Cream has been marketed in in
creased quantities the past week.
Pastures are inNgood condition, and
indications are that first production
is close at hand.
Poultry is mojfring from the farms
quite freelv, indicating that the hens
"have about "laid themselves out.
As a consequence markets are on
a lower level. .
Egg receipts have shown further
decrease, due .to the warm weather
and to the fact that the end of the
laying season is in sight. Too much
care cannot he given to the market
ing of eggs frequently during the
warm weather.
