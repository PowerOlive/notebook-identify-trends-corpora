Miss Anna Chandler Goff, managerof the Artist Concert Series, received a telegram from Harry Askin,manager of the band, saying thatphysicians have decided that theMarch King cannot resume his tourfor thirty days. Miss Goff has wired Mr. Askin to ask for the earliestavailable date for Lexington.The most remarkable tour everlaunched by Sousa and his band wasinterrupted and delayed by the accident in which the leader was thrownfrom his horse at Philadelphia. Onthe advice of his physicians Sousahad agreed to "lay off" until Oct.15, when the band was expected toresume its tour with a concert inCleveland. The "enforced" vacationwill give the big organization ofnearly one hundred musicians a holiday during which they will drawfull pay, as Mr. Sousa feels that themembers of his band should sufferno loss through an accident forwhich they are in no way to blame.BOUBBON'S GASOLINE TAXIn the report recently submittedto the Auditor's office at Frankfort,showing the amounts of gasolinetaxes collected from Kentuckycounties, Bourbon county is creditedwith a total of $8,072.39 from June15, 1920 to July 1, 1921.

Whenthey go to the polls to cast theirvotes for other officials, if there is aschool board ticket in connectionwith the general ticket, they eitherpurposely ignore it or pass it up onthe ground that it doesn't amount tomuch to any save heads of houseswho have children in school. But itis a matter that everyone shouldconsider carefully. The followingletter to THE NEWS from State Superintendent of Schools George Colvin is both timely and explanatory:"As provided by school law enacted at the 1920 session of the StateLegislature, there is to be an entirecity board of education elected atgeneral election in November of thisyear in every city of the fourth classwhere an entire board was not elected in November of last year. Thisboard is to consist of six members.Nomination is non-partisan, and bypetition of not fewer than fifty legalvoters. These nominating petitionsmust be filed in the County Clerk'soffice not less than fifteen days before the day of election; and thenames of persons so nominated willappear on the "school ticket," whichwill be separate and distinct fromthe political ticket. Both nomination and election are by the city district at large, without regard toward or precinct lines. Each votercan vote for as many candidates asthere are members to be electedsix this year."To this board will be entrustedthe administration of the publicschools the most important- Institution of a self-governing people. Itis important that the men and women and women chosen for membership should be the most capable,public-spirited and liberal-mindedcitizens of your city, and sufficientlypatriotic to sacrifice a portion oftheir time to this important publicservice."Nominating petitions cannot befiled later than October 24."VERIFY ITThe Proof Is In Paris, Almost atYour DoorThe public statement of a Pariscitizen is in itself strong proof forParis people, but confirmationstrengthens the evidence.Here is a Paris citizen who testified years ago that Doan's KidneyPills relieved weak kidneys and nowstates the result was permanent.Can any sufferer from kidney illsask better proof? You can investigate. The case is right at home.Mrs. A. L. Burley, 329 Eighthstreet, Paris, says: "I have usedDoan's Kidney Pills a few times andfrom the benefit obtained I can saythey are a good and reliable remedy. Whenever my kidneys haveacted irregularly or my back hadbeen weak and lame I have alwaysfound a box or so of Doan's KidneyPills which I got at Ardery's DrugStore to relieve the complaint veryquickly."The above statement was givenNovember 10, 1916, and on November 12, 1920, Mrs. Burley said: "Ihaven't changed my opinion ofDoan's Kidney Pills and recommendthem just as highly to-day as whenI gave my statement in 1916. Thecure Doan's Kidney Pills made forme at that time has been permanent." Price 60c, at all dealers. Don'tsimply ask for a kidney remedyget Doan's Kidney Pills the samethat Mrs. Burley had.
