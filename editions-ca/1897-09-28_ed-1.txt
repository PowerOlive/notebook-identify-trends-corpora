MADRIDThe Programme of the United StatesGuvernment Does Not ContemplateA Declaration of War if Spain Rejects Mediation The Ministers Conference Withthe Oukeor Tetuan the Foreign Minister Was Most SatisfactoryMadrid Sept -27 The arrival ofUnited States Minister Woodford fromSan Sebastian has made a sensationThe programme of the Duited Stateshas been ascertainedThis does not contemplate a declaration of war if Spain rejects mediationbut according to report an ostentatious proclamation to the world of disapproval of the Cuban regime by suspending diplomatic relations withSpain and withdrawing the UnitedStates MinisterGen Woodford has declined to be interviewed on the subject further thanto say that his conference with theduke of Tetuan the foreign ministerwas of a most satisfactory characterThe unexpected bitterness of the pressand of public opinion has painfully impressed him but he hopes this will soonbe allayed as he believes his mission favorable to Spanish interestsand can notcomprehend that Spain could rejectmediation designed to end an itupoveiishingwar He has not named a timeat which the war must be terminatedbut he hopes as the results of his tenders that it will be ended quickly Hebelieves the war is inflicting incalculable loss upon the United States andthat it is impossible to prevent the organization of filibustering expeditionsUnusual measures were taken to protect Minister Woodford on his journeyfrom San Sebastian to this city butthe trip was quite uneventful A partyof gendarmes commanded by a sublieutenant guarded the southern express on which he was a passengerSecret police were posted at the station and the prefect of police was inwaiting to escort him to his hotel Thedrive through the streets was markedby no special incident though severalpeople saluted him receiving a bow inreturnSome comment has been caused bythe fact that Minister Woodfords family has not accompanied him but remains behind the French frontierMinister Woodford exxriains that hisparty is a large one requiring a commodious home and prefers spending apleasant October at Biarritz until asuitable residence can be secured hereThe legation can not be used as a residence Gen Woodford has already engaged a box at the Royal opera houseand has purchased horsesTHE GRAND JURYAt Versailles lud Makes a Final Adjournment Without

afraid it would take more than myeloquence to induce your father to seethe matter from my standpointBut can you not see how very easilyhe might be deceived she anxiouslyurged He has not had the management of the mine himself and if anywrong has been doneYou do not know how glad it makesme that you aire even willing to admitthe possibility of wrong having beendone he said as she hesitated tohave you of your own accord giving imethe benefit of a doubt Miss MeredithYou cannot guess how sweet it is tometo feel that you are a little bit myfriend in the case Whether I lose orwin I shall always like to remember itBut you will not listen to ajay talkof compromise she tentatively rejoined with a disappointed airPardon me I shall only be too gladto listen if your father will consent tosuch a conference You must furtherpardon me however if I say that I amnot very sanguine as to the resultsthough Heaven knows how gladly 1would tie to any hope that well thatwould make us friendsShe did not answer anything to thisand after a moment he went to fetchback his horse that had wandered toofar feeding by the roadside Hechanged the subject as he came backxVnd how is your wrist Miss Meredith he asked It has been on mymind for several minutes that I shouldlike to knowAlmost perfectly well thanks Andtnatfremmas mc r iyiu y uwanted to apologizeAnd I told you that I could not possibly imagine why smiling broadly atthe ideaAbout your handkerchief you know1 ought to have returned it to you before this but the fact is I did not quiteknow how to manage it looking up athim with a little embarrassed laughher glance shyly falling to her flowersas she went on You see I did not explain to papa about meeting you theother day I I think it is a greatnuisance explaining thingsSo it is he cordially agreed AndIm awfully glad you did not botherBut 1 have been so worried aboutthat handkerchief she laughingly declared If I ventured to put it in thepost office I knew that the postmasterwould be discussing with everybodyhow it might happen that I Col Merediths daughter should be sending aparcel to you while if I sent the boywho does chores at the hotel to take itto you well you know the landladyspeculiarities perhaps She would bebound to ferret out the mystery or diein the attempt If only I could havehad a premonition that I was to meetyou to day so that I might have broughtit with meCould you not have a premonitionthat you would meet me some otherday to morrow perhaps he daringly suggestedI had thought that I might send itto you by mail from Denver but thatwould involve some delay she returned looking up at him uncertainlyBut would it not be much less troublesimply to give it to me here he urgedingenuouslyYou would have the trouble of coining after it she protested doubtfullyHe regarded her inquiringly for aninstant breaking into a laugh as he sawthat she was quite in earnest You arso considerate he exclaimed but Ishould not mind coming in the leastand in fact I shall be going over toTomtown to morrow anyway If youcould be walking Jiere at about halfpast nine in the morning would thatbe too early for youShe rose with a slight accession ofdignity an embarrassed flush rising toher face Excuse me I did not sajthat I would come here to meet you atall I could not dont you see Itwould look well it would look oddto say the leastAre you referring to the impressionit might have upon me may I askCertainly not you would understand the circumstances butotherpeopleAnd has Mrs Grundy perchance acounfay seat in this neck of woods Ishould never have supposed it hisglance ranging the rugged heights withmasculine contempt for such argument However it must be just asjoi say Miss Meredith And perhapsI should ask if you mind my leadingmyhorse along beside you here Theyhad been loitering down the road withthe last wordsOh no only her glance strayingwhich the first cabins of the camp wouldbe in evidenceOnly so far I may go but no fartherAh well I am generally philosophicalenough to believe in the half loaftheory even if 1 am sometimes audacious enough to ask for more If weare not to meet again I am sorry butat least I appreciate my good luck today you need not think me ungratefulfor that As to the handkerchiefplease dont give it another thought itis not of the slightest consequenceBut I want you to have it back shenervously protested and do you knowit has occurred to me I want to rideover to the little hut where we were inthe storm the other day I left my whipthere Why can I not deposit the handkerchief there for you You wouldhave to go after it to be sure but perhapsThat would not matter he eagerlyrejoined intently regarding her Wasshe possibly relenting in respect tomeeting him again for some reason preferring that other rendezvous Whenwill you goTo morrow morning perhapsAt what timeAt just about the time when youwill be going to Tomtown if I go sherejoined pointedly plainly guessinghis thought I will leave the handkerchief in one of the boxes I fancy itwill be perfectly safeVery well though Im sorry totrouble you he responded stifflyThey went on a few steps in silenceuntil of a sudden she stopped with asuggestive glance ahead They werejust at the turn of the road I thinkwe would better say good by here shedeprecatingly observed Will you go onahead or shall II think I would rather you did if youdont mind I shall see you a momentlonger that way he answered smilingruefully And if we are never to meetagainOh I dont know why you shouldsay never she hurriedly protestedlooking awayUnless you say it of course there isnot the slightest reason he rejoinedquickly his face brightening Butyou tell me I must not come to meetyouAnd what would you think of me ifI should tell you that you could shecavalierly demandedShall I tell you honestly Miss MeredithIt does not in the least matter whatyou would think she captiously declared I have told you that I couldnot think of such a thingAnd of course that settles itBut we may meet by chance theusual way who knows she murmuredlaughing shyly hardly conscious of theimport of the words in the nervous embarrassment that was growing uponher But I cannot stand here prophesying I must goMust you he reluctantly returnedhis eyes smiling down into hers Wellthen until we meet byMiss Meredith and thank yous6imuchfor the prophecyCHAPTER VHITheyearsthathehad passed in Colorado had been so given to unremitting toilthat Harvey Neil believed he had hadno time to think of women In realitythere had been no particular woman forhim to think about The rough lifeof ranches the social stratum to whichhis work in the smelter had broughthim and the isolation of the mine hadalike been barren to such type ofwomanhood as alone could appeal to ataste fastidious by nature and furtherrefined by all the training and tradition of his home life Like any normally minded man to love and be lovedwas a paramount need of his being aneed fully realized in his heart but tomwrm mii i Ill wgive himself blindly to any passion forhim would have been impossible Hemust look up and not down in his loveAnd so he had waited on heart freebeyond his 30th birthday so philosphical under loves tarrying that to himself he had come to profess a whimsicalbelief that fate had willed he should diea bachelor scarce conscious with whatgrowing force the burden of his lonelylife weighed upon his spirit how insistently his heart hungered for thesolace and sweet companionship of thenot impossible she who had vaguelyfigured in his dreamsBut since his encounter with Dorothy Meredith in the rain he had founda great deal of time to think of womenand of the one whom his reason toldhim he would far better forget hisenemys pretty daughter The episodeat the worlds fair had made a deepimpression upon him Tor many dayshe had recalled her looks her waysher voice and smile tantalized by longing to meet her again but then manlike giving up all idea that the wishcould ever be realized and his mindfurther occupied by the troubles between the mjnes which had come uponhim not long after he had almost forgotten the fancy altogether until witha shock he recognized her as shepassed in at the door of the WindyGulch hotel one day and realized thatshe was Col Merediths daughter Thediscovery seemed effectually to dispelall the lingering glamour of the worldsfair meeting he had no smallest vishto recall himself to her memorj Almost he could fancy so keen was hisdislike of Col Meredith that he couldread somewhat of her fathers character in her face while certain he wasthat she was by no means so pretty ashe had supposed her that other timewhen he had seen her in the twilightAnd then as though in mockery of hisself delusion fate had brought aboutthe encounter in the rain when in herappealing helplessness and the frankdelight with which she had recognizedhim she had seemed ten times morewinsome than she had been beforewhile the after meeting in the Tomtown road when prepared for cold rebuff she had surprised him with sweetgentleness had effectually completedhis conquestThatherlnkl imet hw butTHE BOUEBON NEWS TUAY SEPTEMBER 28 1897He was over ears inlovethree times all told that she was tohim scarce more than an ideality counted for nothing in the mad infatuationto which he had surrendered himselfWith the fatuous reasoning of a loverhe felt that to him had been given asit were a charmed eyesight to comprehend her nature It was as though hehad known her and loved her all hislifeAs may be understood from this briefsketch of his career Harvey Neil wasnot lacking in force of character ortenacity of purpose and no sooner hadhe fairl3r diagnosed the sweet bewitchery that possessed him than ithad become unalterably fixed in hismind that Dorothy must be his Atfirst thought the difficulties to be encountered in carrying out this purposeseemed but to inflame his eagernessHe exalted in the thought of combating the opposition which was to beexpected from Col Meredith of getting the better of that gentleman inwinning away his pretty daughterfrom under his very nose it was onlywhen his thoughts dwelt upon Dorothyherself that Jie grew anxious andtroubled Marriage rather more thanany other bargain demands the consenting attitude of no less than two andpredisposed against him through loyalty fb her fathers cause as he assumedthat she was he could not but foreseegrave obstacles in the way of his wooing developed from her sense of dutyGiven opportunity he had all a loversconfidence that he could so storm herheart so compass her about with sweetobservances that he scarce could failin winning love for love but when itcame to practical consideration of waysand means he -was forced to own himself nonplussed To retreat passionsaid was now impossible but to advance at the impetuous pace his fancywould choose he had to acknowledge-was almost equally out of the questionBut he did not forget that he had onechance of seeing her again To besure she had expressly refused to meethim but that should not prevent himfrom seeing her if it were possibleFar rather would he face her displeasure trusting to clever pleading to winhim pardon than miss any smallest opportunity to further his suitBut there was no anger and only thelamest assumption of surprise whenhe met her up the Old Silver trail nextmorning and his heart grew light withthe guess that sihe had half expectedhimYou did not go to Tomtown shefaltered recklessly reining her horseWe may meet toy chance she murmuredout into the quaking asps as though toride

the best of it is sheis never weary of well doing She isalways sending me moreIndeed a hint of cold surprise inthe tone The truth was that with impulsive argument quite feminine in itstenor it had become settled in Dorothysmind that the exquisite stitchery onthat handkerchief betrayed a sweethearts gift She would not like to confess even to herself how often she hadsmoothed out the crumpled silk uponher lap studying the interlaced letterswith dreamy questioning in her eyesWho was she this other woman whosefingers had wrought so patiently andwell Surely she must have loved himand he had

and gazed over ather in a helpless sort of wayIt entirely escaped my memory hecontinued contritely feeling carefullythrough his various pockets and finally producing a crumpled and ratheruntidy note which he had fished upfrom the profound depths of one ofthemHere is something that ClarenceStewart asked me to hand you the otherday and I quite forgot it until this mo-nent He and two or three of the girlsBlanche May and Lida I think hesaid however the note will tell you-are coming out to spend a day with usThat will be delightful acknowledged Mrs Pettibone serenely Ishall be ever so glad to see them andthey have been promising me this visitfor quite awhile I am truly glad theyhave been thoughtful enough to sendme word and not take me unawaresfor I wish ample time for preparationMy reputation as housekeeper is atstake and I am especially anxious thateverything shall be as near perfectionas possible When do they speak ofcomingI suppose the note states my loveanswered Mr Pettibone with someshow of nervousness and with a guiltylook overspreading his countenanceYou know I have carried it around inmy pocket for a day or two and andI believe to day is the one they haveappointedMrs

of extenuating circumstancesAnd you have been carrying thisnote around in your pocket ever sinceit was given you continued Mrs Pet-tibone like an avenging NemesisYes acknowledged Mr Pettibonehumbly

-around frequently through the dayland these in addition to our apolofymight render our guests sufficientlycoolI thought perhaps we might have icecream and strawberries I noticed theberries are ripening nicely only thismorning answered Mr Pettibone unheedf ul of his wif es sarcasmThey might do very well for dessert said Mrs Pettibone thoughtfully but these would scarcely make adinner for five or six hungry peopleNo Mr Pettibone she continuedyou have gotten me into this dilemmaand now you will have to get me out ofit In the first place you had betterhitch the horse to the buggy and startout at once to hunt some help and remember she added impressively itmust be obtained if there is any thisside the Chinese empire The baby doesnot require Hettys attention at present and while you are gone she and Iwill do all that we can There is no timetc lose I assure youWith these words Mrs Pettibonearose and buckled on her armor so tospeakA tour of investigation revealed thefact that there was in the pantry astack cake which might do in casethere was no time to prepare -a betterwhile the cream which had been setaside for churning was still sweet andcould be utilizedSo far things wore rather a cheerfuloutlook and as time sped on all thatMrs Pettibones active hands could effect and a good deal that her activebrain suggested was happily accomplished until the preliminaries had assumed such shape that with an experienced hand to complete what had beenso well begun an excellent dinnermight shortly be forthcomingWhen an hour had slipped rapidly byhowever and another was on the waneMrs Pettibone grew restless and uneasy at the protracted stay of her husband and consumed a good deal of hervaluable time in running to the cornerof the house to see if help was near athandWhen two hours had passed MrsPettibones restlessness increased witheach succeeding five minutes as if theminute hand on the clock was the needlethat registered her feelings and shefound it a difficult task to bestow theproper attention on the making of hertransparent piesAs train time approached and yet nosign of her absent lord she had reachedalmost a fever of excitement and whilethe pies were being removed from theoven and placed upon a shelf to cool thewhistle blew and the train came speeding through the spring clad countrypausing for a brief space at the stationonly half a mile from the pretty cottageof the Pettibones and just out of viewbehind a green hillockWhen the pastry had been hastilyplaced on the shelf Mrs Pettibone rancut to take another look and this timewas rewarded by seeing her guests dulyappear over the hill and stroll leisurelyalong the pleasant country laneA sigh escaped her at the sight forshe had faintly hoped that some kindinterposition of Providence short of arailway accident would delay the visitors until a more propitious timeWhat will they think at finding noone at the station to welcome tihemAnd what can have detained Mr Pettibone so long thought his wife as sheturned her steps toward the houseBefore she reached it there was analarming clatter in the kitchen and alittle shriek that Hetty evidently voicedHastening on a scene met the eyesof the mistress that was calculated tomake considering the attendant circumstances a stouter heart than hersgrow faintThe stovepipe had abruptly severedall connection between chimney andstove and had descended to the common level of the floor and not contentto play this prank alone had coercedthe shelf of pashy into joining in thespree whereupon the vicinity of thestove presented a chaotic mingling ofdisjointed pipe and transparent pieswith a liberal sprinkling of soot overeverything even Hettys horrifiedcountenance as she stood near by rooted to the spot in absolute dismayMrs Pettibone took in the unhappysituation at a glance and then sankdown on the nearest seat also sootyand burst into tearsIn the mlorst of her weeping theguests arrived their laughter and merriment jarring unpleasantly upon theovertaxed nerves of the miserable hostess who hastily dried her tears andbade Hetty show the company into theparlor where she would join them presenttyHetty presented herself at the doorafter first rubbing her hands over herface once or twice with the pleasing result of distributing the spot a littlemore evenly over her light brown countenanceIs your mistress well askedBlanche Desmond as she paused in thehall while the others entered the parlor for she felt confident that something was amiss by the tone of thingsin general coupled with the sooty decorations on Hettys faceShe aint feelin very well- rightnow answered the truthful handmaiden who had not been cautioned topreserve a discreet silenceWhat is the matter questionedBlanche Avhose curiosity was by nomeans satisfied by Hettys answerWhy the stovepipe fell down awhileago and just mashedan Tuined all thenice pies Mis Laura had made anscattered soot over all the other things ancooks gone away an Mr Pettibone isout now tryin to find somebody to helpget dinnerj Good gracious exclaimed Blanchj aghast at this formidable array of misI fortunes Is that alllesm I think it is respondedHetty thoughtfully not quite sure thatshe had enumerated the entire catalogue 4Poor dear woman Where is sheBlanche exclaimed impulsively andfollowed her guide straightway to thej kitchen where she discovered herTHE BtinflKW NRWS TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 28 1897friend bravely trying to restore ordsronce again her face and hands moresooty than Hettys even and her eyered with weeping and the escaping1smoke that had filled the room in thefirst stage of the accidentYou precious dirty creature exclaimed Blanche warmly as she gaveher astonished hostess a hearty hug andkissed one sootless spot in the neighborhood of the right earWhat a lot of trouble we have unintentionally caused youIt is all Mr Pettibones forgetfulness so do not reproach yourself at alldear but oh what a time I have hadfor the last three hoursIndeed it must have tried yournerves sorely replied Blanche soothingly But cheer up we shall get onfamously never fear Perhaps you areignorant of the fact that May Lida andI have become proficient members of acooking club and can get up a breakfast dinner or tea in capital style andon short notice Just furnish us a bigapron apiece and we will prove ourcapabilities m a very short whileThat would be a novel idea indeedresponded Mrs Pettibone with a littleincredulous laughI am really in earnest said BlancheOnly get us the aprons and I will provethe truth of my wordsWhat Have my visitors come to thekitchen and cook their own dinnersNever emphatically cried the hostessWhat Have a party of healthyvounsr people come to spend the daywith a friend and find her minus a cookand literally with soot to her eyes andyet lend no helping hand Never retorted the guest quite as emphaticallySo go at once and wash your face andhands they really need it dear whileI bring out Clarence Stewart to assistyour small maid in putting up the stovepipeDont look sty shocked Laura he issufficiently able bodied to undertakethe job I assure you and besides lama little curious to know how much ability of this kind he possesses she addedThen bustling the hostess away toremove the sooty insignia of her newrole and also to hunt up enough largeaprons for the trio and giving Hettysome useful hints about talcing up thesoot carefully Blanche joined herfriends in the parlor and depicted thesituation in such a humorous way thatthe company were almost convulsedwith laughterThe quartette had come out for a holiday were dressed in washable goodsmostly and were eager for anythingsavoring of novelty so that when alittle later Mr Pettibone returned withmany misgivings and a very verdantgirl but little older than Hetty he wasconsiderably astonished at the sight offour pretty cooks in long aprons andas busy as bees in the kitehen whilehandsome Clarence Stewart sat at thedoor in his shirt sleeves shelling peasand casting especially admiring glancesat one of the aforementioned cooksWhen troubles come they come notsingly but in battalions quoted Steyart after the host had given a pathetically ludicrous account of his searchafter the unattainable as he facetiously expressed it and an hour spentat the blacksmith shop while a wheelwas being mendedIn a brief time both host and hostessentered heartily into the humor of thesituation and a merrier set had neverbefore convened under the PettiboneroofThere were no idle handsVegetables were gathered and prepared strawberries picked salad compounded a new sort of cake successfully baked chicken temptingly fried amber coffee made flaky biscuit fashioneddelightful cream frozen until from absolute misfortune matters took a highly satisfactory turnBlanche directed and assisted hercorps of willing auxiliaries as if shehad been to the kettles born whileClarence Stewart appeared to relish thebondage under which he served thoughit was far from being an easy one forthe freezer had to be kept in constantmotion until the perspiration bedewedthe flushed faces of both himself andMr Pettibone as they took turns at thecongealing processVerily you two shall have your reward said Blanche encouragingly forwhen the ices come to be served I shallrecall to the mind of our hostess the industry you have displayed and yoursshall be the lions shareIndeed I was seriously thinking ofnot giving Mr Pettibone any dinner atall as a punishment for not deliveringyour note at the proper time said hiswife shaking her finger reproachfullyat himAs this is the first case on record oia man carrying around in his pocketsletters he should have delivered I thinkhe ought to be pardoned interposedStewart gravely and everyone laughedFinally dinner was announced andwith faces a good deal rosier and appetites certainly heartier the party satdown to tableNot to the Mother of Invention whichnecessity created but to her charmingdaughters was the toast Stewart offered which was drunk in the11 mostdelicious of fresh cool buttermilkNot to the lords of creation but tothe humble and willing slaves of thekitchen Blanche offered in tunCandthis was received with even heartierplauseBlanche you are a jewel of a girla pearl of great price said Mrs- Pettibone affectionately as they stood aloneon the front porch while the others hadstarted slowly down the road in the direction of the station You will makeone of the best of wivesSo Clarence tried to make me believe to day when he was helping in thekitchen answered Blanche demurelyIt is a secret as yet she added witha glad smile while her friend pressed ahearty kiss of congratulation onberrosy lips --Time has proven that both MrsPetrtibone and Clarence Stwwart fg ctaright N Y Ledger vr iRIPE KClGSInformation Jerry- Rusk Obtainedfrom a Western FarmerGov Husk happened to drive over thestate line once into Wisconsin lookingat the farms He was particularlystruck with one farm on which hefound everything in first class orderand riding up to the house inquired thename of the owner when a tall Germancame out and gave his name as Theodore LouisWhat do you regard as the greatestwealth producing agency in agriculture the governor asked himThe hog was the sententious re-t Upon what do you base this statementHe lifts more mortgages than anything elseThe conversation which ensued developed the fact that Louis had oncebeen what is called an all wheat farmerand kept constantly sinking into debtHe decided that something had to bedone quickly or there would be verylittle left for Louis so he decided to trythe hog The first year he made a little money the second year he mademore and then he became thoroughlyInterested The result was that hebecame recognized as a great authorityon hogs His neighbors took up hisexample and mortgages began to belifted until finally there was not oneon record against that communityHow long would you keep a hog 7as Gov Husk tI would not keep him I would killhimWhenWhen he is ripeWhen is he ripeWhen he is fatWouldnt it pay to keep the hog fortwo or three yearsI tried that once said Louis Itook a hog in the fall and weighed himand I took my corn and weighed itWhen spring came the corn was allgone and the hog weighed about whathe did in the fall That made me saynext year that I would kill my hogs inthe fall and save my cornHow much does it cost to keep ahog through the winterThree dollarsHow many hogs winter in MinnesotaOne million I have just looked atthe auditors reportDo you mean to say that we lose3000000 a year in wintering ourhogsYes

a Mints WorkA British army officer just returnedfrom India told me the other day a curious story which should be edifyingto all currency reformers He had accumulated during his service there aconsiderable quantity of old silverwhich possessed only an ordinary barvalue He did not want to encounterthe bother and expense of bringing themetal to England and so as he expressed it he sent it to a native to becoined into rupeesBut the Indian mints have beenshut down for years I interrupted insome surpriseOh yes he assented with a peculiar look but you know the rupee iscorned just as freely in India to dayas it was before the government closedthe mintsSeeing that I was puzzled he gaveme without the slightest emfoarrassment this extraordinary explanationEven when the mints were openmore rupees were coined by privatecoiners than by the government Thesavings of the natives are made in silver bracelets rings and other ornaments When it became necessary forthem to turn a part of their -resourcesinto money they did it by employing anative coiner to turn ihe metal intorupees It is a country of vast distances and the natives could not sendtheir ornaments to a government mintperhaps 1000 miles away The nativecoiner traveled from place to place andhut to hut just like a country tinkerHe was glad to work all day turning silver bangles into rupees weight forweight for perhaps one rupee as hisreward And very good rupees theyturned out too They are currenteverywhere and nobody questionsthem Of course the practice is illegitimate and when the mints werefirst closed the government tried tonot with much successput a stop to it butcess Now it is winked at by the authorities for the situation in India today is too threatening for any interference which is

Which the Average WommWill Find Usefal and TimelyUnless a figure is largely out of proportion there is no real necessity in thislay of having corsets made to orderBut it is quite necessary that a corsetshould be fit to the figure as carefullyas a glove or a boot is fitted One makeDf corset may fit you perfectly in thebust but the waist may be too shortor too lonjg or thie hips too snug orloose Pitting is done at all first classhouses free of charge and it is timewell spent in having your corset properly fittedFewwomenhaving secured the rightkind of corset know how to lace itThere should be two lacing stringssilk being better than any other onereaching from the top to the waisttine and one from the waist line to thebottom edge of the oorset The corset can then be laced comfortably atthe waist as closely or as tightly as onewishes without compressing the bustand forcing the flesh at the back overthe top of the corset Then too thecorset can be adjusted about the hipsand over the abdomen without discomfort and ungainly lines as is the casewhen only one lacing is usedA woman who dresses a great dealand always up to the occasion reallyneeds a variety of corsets A decolletegown calls for a- low cut corset thatconforms to the shape o the bodicewhile a tailor made costume requires acorset high above the bust and long onthe abdomen The negligee robe dechambre has a corset that is merelya bust support The bicycle corset isusually a ventilated affair made quiteshort from the waist down and hasfewer bones thou any other The corset for the empire gown is little morethan a belt showing little or no bustcurve And so it goes making thewearing of corsets a thing of comfortif properly fittedThe tendency among women to takeup physical culture and athletics hasnot driven out corsets but has donemuch toward improving them Moderntimes have seen the anatomy of the human figure so carefully studied thatthie corset has become an element ofcomfort and some physicians say ofgood healthTo be laced in the general acceptance of the term is now considered theheight of vulgarity It is quite natural the waist should be smaller than thebust or hips but it need not be fairlystrangled into an hour glass shapeWhat is wanted in a corset is plenty ofroom at the bust and on the hips withno pressure on the ribs to interferewith breathing Pew of us are constructed on the lines of the ideal figureso that much of the beauty of our formdepends upon a good fitting corsetWomans Home CompanionHONESTY IS THE BEST POLICYIf You Are Dead Broke Own Up likea Little ManDead broke is not an

Campbells pass60 miles to the west of Fort WingateTvhad riddeni ahead in this pass withrtwo troopers to make some topographical examinations and was about fivemiles in the advance of the main partyrtvhenan exclamation from one of thepoldders caused me to rein in my horseland to ask the cause of the alarmI saw an Injun sir up there in therwoodsV said the soldier indicating the idirection with his carbineIn -an instant we were dismountedand watching with our bridles overouxarms and our carbines readyAfter waiting some minutes I beganto think the man was mistaken andjwas about to give the order to remountwhen a horse plunged down the teepmountain side and a glance told -methat the remarkable looking person onthe creatures back was neither Apachemor Navajoe but a white man like ourselvesThis riders long hair and laeardlooked to be as white as the snow onthe distant mountain peaks and hiscostume was a fantastic though decidedly picturesque cross between thedress of a Mexican and that of a -northwesthunterThe pommel of his saddle the buttons on his leggings the stock of hislong rifle and the hilts of his -pistolsand lenif e fairly flashed with silver Hewas well mounted and rode in a -waygthat showed- that the years jthatlhadirosted his hair had not lessened hiswonderful skill as a horsemanHe came fearlessly toward us andshook hands saying as he did -so withthe manner of an educated man Myname is Levi Bronson did you everhear of me beforeI told Mr Bronson I never had heardof him before but to save his pride forthe confession seemed to give him painI added I am a civil engineer andhave not been long in this regionA civil engineer he repeated-What do you want in thesetains and he waved his hands abouthim and looked as if he thought meanintruder I told him that if he rodeback toward our party with me Iwouldexplain our object at the same time T-expressed my surprise that any manshould venture into such a dangerousterritory- aloneI know the Indians and the Indians know me said this remarkable- man I am to them the Silver Chief agreat medicine man who lived withthenx iand nursed them back to healthwhen they- sickened before the men ofmy race came to slay and starve themAh I sometimes blush for the whiteblood in my veinsThere was a strange gleam in hise3es as he spoke and I concluded thatthe stranger was not well balanced Itold hinr the object of our survey whichhad the Pacific ocean for its objectivepoint and a railroad for its conclusionbut the information did not please himIt is folly to build a railroad througha wilderness he said What is theretto support a railroad here and againhe waved liis long arms at the forestMcovered hillsI told him that railroads had becomeithe pioneers of civilization and thatjalong their tracks farms and villagestfiiid cities sprang upThat may be an other places heaBftid but it iis impossible that a railroad should exist so close to MadredOroMadre dOxoi repeatedYes Madre dOro means the motherof gold Did you never hear of itI confessed that I aiever had and expressed a desire to ihetenlightenedThe eld man eyed one for a few seconds in silence as if judging whether Ivas worthy or not then he shook hishead and saidIt ismjr secret and lido inot know youenough to confidentI bowed and we rode back to wherethe engineer corps had formed a campLeyi Bronson remained with us nearly a week and during that time he refused very tempting offers to act asguide ov us as far as the ColoradoriverHe proved himself to be a famoushunter and he rentured off alone witha perfect cQntemjt for what would havebtjen positive danger to any other manHe was voted crazy by all thepartybut in me the man Xited the liveliestinterest and by inny confidences Itried to draw from hlin the story ofhis Ufe which I felt sure was jnnde upoi incidents of no urdjnary kindThe night before he left he dreme to one de and sitting down withhis back to a tree and the flames of aneighboring fire lighting up his picturesque face he said And so youdlike to know something about MadredOroI told him that I should if he thoughtme worthy of his confidenceIt is a secret he said in a half whisper but then what does it matter ifthe world knew so long as only oneman can find the placeWhat placeThe place where all the gold in theserocks and streams comes from LMadre dOro the Mother of Gold Ahthousands have died trying to find theplace anditmaybethatnowthat Iknowwhere it is I may not be permitted toenter it for you know the Aztecs believe that the wonderful valley is enchantedIndeedYes and I am inclined to that beliefmyself but then I have spent so manylong dreary years searching that itwould not do to lose heart now that untold wealth is within my reachI agreed with him and by carefulquestioning I drew out of him his storyof the valley of gold which I subsequently found to be an established belief among the miners of the northernMexican states and to them it camewithout doubt from the Aztecs whowere once the masters of all this landUsing my own language this wasthe account in which he firmly believedWithin a hundred miles of the placewhere we -were then encamped was thewonderful valley of rgold and Levi Bronson was confident that he knew the exact locationThe valley was an the heart of theSierra Madre mountains walled in bytowering rocks and accessible only bya secret passage through which floweda -stream that excepting on one dayamevery year filled up the passage andmade ingress impossibleThis valley is -small hi extent andperfectly circular Through it the riverflows cool and clear and filled with fish-whose scales aregolden Thebanksaremasses of variegated flowers and treesever in blossom made delightful shadesand fairy like arbors Birds of thesweetest song and most exquisite plumage of varieties unknown to theouter world make vocal this wonderful valley and flash through its darkgreen foliage like animated blossomsRunning across this wonderful valley there is a belt 40 feet in width onwhich no vegetation grows for the beltis the top of a wall- of gold that flasheswith indescribable brilliancy when thesun balances in midheaven and lookslovingly down on Madre dOroThe old Aztec priests know well thisvalley and so they still cherish the belief that Montezuma will again appealin the flesh to lead them against theSpanish conquerors whom they havenever ceased to hate They think thewealth necessary to regain their liberties will come from this vallejBut one white man everthat was a Spaniard named Jose Alvarrez who entered through the subterranean passage and being discoveredby the guardian priests was sacrificedto the sun on- the golden ledgeAnd you know where this wonderfulvalley is I asked Levi Bronson whenhe had finished his descriptionYes he replied I am sure I couldlead you within ono mile of the placeAre you going there1 amAnd you are not afraid of the guardian priestsXo for I am a doctor and I havepracticed my profession for years amongHA- i Z

to base definite statements as to the best methods of planting or the age at which the trees maybe cut with greatest profit for the production of gum A recent English consular report from Japan states thatalthough hitherto the youngest woodfrom which camphor was extracted wasabout 70 to SO years old it is expectedthat under the present scientific management the trees will give equallygood results after 25 or 30 years Camphor of good quality has been producedin Florida from the leaves and twigs oftrees less than 20 years old one poundof crude gum being obtained from 77pounds of leaves and twigsThe trees will endure severe pruningwith little apparent injury One thirdof the leaves and young shoots may beremoved at one time without materially checking the growth of the tree Thelargest proportion of camphor is contained in the older larger roots thetrunk limbs twigs and leaves containing successively a decreasing proportion When the camphor tree is killednearty to the ground by frost it sendsup vigorous shoots from the base Itmay be expected to do the same whencut especially if cut lae in the fall Experiments are needed to determinewhether this growth may be dependedupon or

sections that poultry can getalong- and even thrive if their food ispresented to them in the simplest manner This is a mistake Where soft foodis given it is generally trampled upon-by aU -the birds before it is fully atenand in consequence they are compelled5VViCONVENIENT FEED BOXto devour jo more or less amount of diitwhich is usually of such a nature as tobe no good to them In order to avoidthis I would suggest that a feedbox bemade having a door of slats made oflaths as shown herewith also on theside opposite from the door I shouldhave slats as seen from the inside of thebox Place the food in this shut thedoor and the fowls can reach the foodfrom each side readily between theslats but cannot soil it Furthermorea dish of water can be set within it andthe fowls can reach through and drinkbut they cannot pollute it as they otherwise would By this device stray catsand dogs have no chance of getting atthe food should it happen to be of anature palatable to them and stealingit

Thomas Meehan in the Ladies Home Journal Byearly is meant as soon as the wood isripe and the winter buds fully formedThis is usually a month before the regular fall of the leaf The leaves arestripped by hand After the wood isripe it makes no difference whetherthe leaves are taken off by Jack Frostthe wind or the human liand In theeastern part of Pennsylvania this wouldbe usually about the 1st of September and the work of planting can bekept up during October and often toNovemfber or December But late fallplanting in cold climates is as risky aalate spring planting The moisture iadried out by cold winds or hot suns bepleuish the great evaporation Jumilder climates planting may be a success all winterMechanical Effect of DrainageThe mechanical effects of drainageare to deepen the soil and promote itsmore thorough pulverization Its firsteffect is to dry its surface soil by drawing out of it all the surplus moisture scthat in early spring or late autumn itinay be worked with the plow as advantageously as at midsummer A welsoil can never be projerly pulverizedand the plowing or working a clay soiLor even a heavy loam wheuwet tendsonly to puddle it and render it lesspervious to water
