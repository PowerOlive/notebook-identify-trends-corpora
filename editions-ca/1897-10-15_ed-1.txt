recently escapedfrom a Spanish prison in Cuba was apassenger on the Ward line steamerSeneca which arrived Wednesdayfrom Havana At quarantine MissCisneros asked to be excused fromsaying anything about her imprisonment and escape as she has notyet recovered from sea sickness fromwhich she had suffered during her entire passage and which kept herin her stateroom during the whole voyage On the passenger list she wasregistered as Miss Juana Sola Shewas traveling under the care ofa gentleman who accompaniedher from Havana When theSeneca reached quarantine thetowboatJ Fred Lohmanx with several newspaper representatives and four womenwent alongside the steamer and afterthe health officers inspection was overthey went on board and accompaniedMiss Cisneros to this cityEVANGELINA COSSIO CISNEFOSMiss Cisneros escape and safe arrivalon the Seneca was one of the most daring feats ever attempted and successfully carried outWhile she was still in prison herfriends secured a passport for one JuanSola and stateroom No 3 on the Senecawas held in the same name This wasthree days before the boat sailed On theSaturday when the Seneca was toleave Havana detectives watched hergangways with extra caution All daylong they remained at their post examing the passports which all passengers have to show before leaving Havana Their vigilance would probablyhave prevented the departure of MissCisneros from Cuba had it notbeen for a little refreshment whichwas served on them by friends of MissCisneros who were aboard the SenecaThe refreshment included wine Thechief of police of Havava came aboardwhile the refreshment part of the plotwas in progress and it is alleged thathe too fell a victim to the wiles ofthe Cisneros factionA few minutes before the Seneca wasready to pull out from her dock a slimyoung fellow came running across thewharf He had no baggage and wasfashionably dressed He walked quickly up the gang plank The detectivesstopped him My name is JuanSola he said and he showed his passport Everything was satisfactoryso the senor was allowed to go aboardIt is said that if it had not been for thewine the strange and rather curiousfigure of Senor Sola might have excited the suspicions of the Spanish detectives But the scheme worked successfully Miss Cisneros friends whenthey saw that everything was satisfactory disembarked and watched theship pull slowly out under the frowning Spanish gun carrying the fugitive to safety under the stars andstripesMiss Cisneros did not court dangerany more than was necessary and atonce went to her cabin The next dayhowever when Morro Castle was leftfar behind she appeared on decktransformed into Senorita Juana Solaalias Cossio Y Cisneros and dressed ina becoming red gownCapt Stevens said that to the best ofhis knowledge the only persons whowent aboard at Havana were the Lastiefamily the Del Beal family eightChinamen and a man whose name appeared upon the advance passenger listas Juan Sola and who must have hada passport otherwise he could not havegone aboard When it was discoveredthat Juan Sola was a girl the Juanwas changed to Juana and Miss Cisneros came in under that nameMiss Cisneros was given some articlesDf

absented yourself from court of your ownaccord which I do not for a momentbelieve you would owe me more thanan apology at the very least I feel thatI am entitled to an explanationAnd I have sworn that I will neverexplain the matter to any human being and I wont if it costs me everyfriend and every dollar I have on earthretorted Neil doggedly But see hereBartels you are not g oing back on meorthis Cant you give me the benefitof a doubt Cant you see that there issomething I cant explain that I canthelp myself Good beavens man youmust stand by meThey had halted at the foot of thestairs leading up to Bartels office andthe lawyer stood keenly regarding hisclient for a moment a whimsical expression gradually chasing the ill humor from his face I wonder if theresa woman in the case he observed thetone of raillery offset by a glint of earnestness in his eyes If thats the caseheaven knows youll need all yourfriends Neil Come up and well talk itoverCHAPTER XIIt was late when Col Meredith reachedWindy Gulch that night but he foundDorothy waiting for him in his roomher face marvelously like his own in itsexpression of cold set severity Shegave him no smile no conventionalwords of greeting as he entered Didyou win the fase she abruptly demandedWell rather he dryly returnedsmiling- good humoredly at her tense-eagerness as he supposed on his account It was a foregone conclusionThey had not a shred of evidence toofferOwing to the fact that Mr Neil anahis principal witness were kept awayThe colonel stared slightty struck bya certain oddity in the tone That cutno figure at all he shortly declaredThey had no case It was a bunco gameIrom first to last as I have told you before But now that your curiosity issatisfied perhaps you will spare me further discusion of the matter to nightDorothy You ought to have been inbed an hour ago and for longer thanthat I have been wishing- that I wereemphasizing the statement by a wearyyawn Good nightJust one minuute she stonily stipulated locking her hands more tightlytogether as she stood before him Iwant those men to be unjustlyblamed I want to tell you that I diditDid what in heavens name ejaculated her father impatiently looking ather as though half suspecting that shehad taken leave of her sensesI went up -to the mine this afternoonand told the men that you had sentword that Mr Neil was to be releasedYou did On t he instant the sleepiness had vanished from the colonelsface anil the interjection was sharp asthe crack of a whip but his tone wasIcily calm as after a moments pause hecereisoniously added Sit downplease Slid perhaps you will be goodenough to explain yourselfI did not know about it until I wascoming up from dinner she said in adull narrative tone I had been writing-letters in my room all the morningnd of course I heard nothing but the-minute they told me I recalled the conversation in this room yesterdajr andI understood But I should not have-meddled I should have lived throughthe disgraceful knowledge that youvrerc accessory to such a crimen I couldihtve borne it somehow if I had not happened to remember what you told meabout the pumps that first day I wasup at the mine when you were showing me about and I was asking so manyquestions You said if the pumpsstopped the mine would fill with waterin 24 hours I could not sit here howcouid I thinking that through themachinations of that wicked McCreadyyou might even at that moment be indirectly conniving at a murder I almost went mad with the thought of ituntil I could stand it no loncrer andthen I ordered cry horse and rode upthereAnd made a precious fool of yourself ejaculated the colonel savagelyThere was not the slightest dangerof the fellows drowning and if yourhead were not so full of dime novelsensationalism you would have knownbetter than to suppose that I wouldtake chances of anything like that 1thoughtlessly exaggerated when I saidthat 24 hours would fill the mine thelower levels did fill for a fact but hewould have been safe in the 100 footlevel for at least 36 hours longer Hehad blankets and plenty to eat Itmay be that he found the situationnot altogether to his mind but if soit only served him right He camesneaking around trying to bribe mymen to go back on me hoping to getme in some sort of a hole and insteadslipped into one himself a case of biterbit As for your posing as his deliverer he stopped short as thoughfairly choked with anger at the thoughtNobody could regret the pose morethan I but it seemed to be forced uponme returned the girl quietly as sherose Now that I have explained thematter however I need not keep youout of bed any longerWait exclaimed her father sharply as she started toward the door Ishould like to know how your preciousprotege took his deliverance Did heappreciate the situation and did hethank you prettily the last wordsreplete with biting sarcasmFor the first time Dorothys calmseemed shaken She glanced towardthe door as though half disposed togo away without answering and whenshe spoke it was with obvious effortI was not there when he came outof the shaft at first it seemed asthough I could not face him as thoughI must sink to the earth in shame if 1but felt his eyes upon me but afterward I waited for him outside I feltI had to and told him that it was alla mistake that you had nothing todo with it her voice which had beenfaltering- ceased entirely until herfather gave vent to an impatient exclamation when she broke into a littlenervous mirthless laugh It is so easyto fall into the habit of lying youknow she ironically observedWhether he believed me or not I donot know but at least he was gentlemanly enough to assume that he didand kind enough to promise when Ibegged him thait he would never bringthe charge against you in any waythat he would be absolutely dumb inregard to the whole affairHe promised that anger givingway to sudden alert interestYes he promised He Avas moregenerous than I when I exacted such apromise of him she bitterly declaredWell upon my word the tone halfamused half incredulous I mustgive you credit for having some methodin your madness but he hesitatedwith a note of sardonic laughter hissteely eyes surveying the girls glowingbeauty with a look of keen comprehension all the same I should have to bpmuch harder pushed than ever I havebeen yet before I could willingly secmy daughter go out into the highwaysmaking mashes on impressionableyoung men in my behalf He waited amoment narrowly watchingher face tobesuretbatshcfelt the coarse thrust before he added the tone telling more thanthe words of the cold tense rage whichpossessed him I supposed thatyou had been brought up to knowwhat conduct was befitting a ladythat you had some tact as well as discretion but this event goes to provethat I have overrated both your intelligence and your breeding And if it hasreached a point when I must tell you inplain English that my business is notto be meddled withPerhaps it would be as well that Ishould place m3Tself beyond the reachof such temptation interrupted thegirl coldlyAunt Marion hasurging me lately to go east andbeenstavwith her I have been thinking thatthat would be the best thing for me todoAs you like returned the colonelindifferently but Dorothy fancied thathe looked a little startled Whenshould you like to goBight away I thinkI shall have to stay here a couple ofdays longer the words coming hesitantly as though he hardly knew whatto say to ths proposition but I cantake you down to Denver then and youcan make your arrangements to go an3Ttime after that unless you change yourmindVery well And in such few wordsthe rift which had come between themwas tacitly recognized and acceptedBut force of habit and regard for appearances combine tohide many a family skeleton and when they met nextmorning it was to all outwaid seemingas though nothing had happened lo marthe harmony of their relations Dorothy fancied that her father lookedsomewhat shamefaced and sorry asthough could he have so far unbenthis stubborn pride he might have retracted some of the bitter words whichrankled in her heatrt and with the perception of his feeling her own moodgrew more tender but it did not changeher purpose of leavingJiim It was better that henceforth they should dwellapartOn the morning of the second dajthoir last in Windy Gulch according tohis plan the colonel so far showed hisdesire to let bygones remain bygonesthat he invited his daughter to ridewith him I shall have to go up to themine he rather diffidently explainedas though he fancied that the mentionof the place might be fraught withsome embarrassment for her but youcan ride on to Gem lake if you like andI can overtake you there when I amthrough with McCreadyBut when they came to the pointwhere the old trail left the highwayDorothy decided that she would preferto go on to the mine with him Thecolonel looked faintly surprised but hemade no objection merely explainingthat he should have to go below theyhad got -the water out of the lower levels and he wanted to take a look aroundbefore leaving but he would not detain her more than a few minutesWill you wait in the shafthouse oroutside he asked with more ofcourtesy in the tone than he was in thehabit of according herI think I will go up in the shade ofthe pine trees she indifferently returned but with a little flush upon heiface which if the colonel noticed howas far from understanding He helpedher from her horse and she strolleciaway up the hill stopping in purposevless fashion to pluck a flower here andthere until he was out of sight whenshe suddenly quickened her pace making for a cliff above Prom that heightshe could look down upon the Mascotbuildings herself unseen It is forthe last time she murmured with alittle catch in her breath her face growing more warmly red and he will neverknowBut it happened that he had startedfor camp that morning bent upon seeing her and thus talcing a short cutover the hill he saw her as she rode upwith her father and hid himself in ssmall srrowth of quaking asps wherehe watched her as she dismountedsorely fretting in the gyves which heldhim back from boldly hurrying afterher But he had no difficulty in guessing her goal as he saw her making upthe hill with that sudden influx of energy in her walk On the instant he wasgoing at a swinging stride toward adraw on the other side of tbe cliff wherethe ascent was easier than at the pointshe had chosen and when a little late-flushed and breathless she stood uponthe height it was to see him comingtoward her with outstretched handssuch radiant happiness upon his facethat she shrank back no less in shyconsternation than for the surprise ofthe encounterHow did you know I was here shefaltered

like dogs writes misanthropicallythat great friend of animals M Toussenel Perhaps it is because the inhabitants of the Celestial empire donot know men sufficiently that theystill regard the dog as an edible animal and as one of the most savory ofmorsels But it is to be hoped that inthe progress of civilization a day willcome when these brave animals candidates for humanity according toMichelets picturesque expressionwill no longer figure on the menus 6fstate dinners at the court of PekingDarwin relates somewhere that whenthe inhabitants of Terra del Fuego arepressed by famine they kill and eattheir old women rather than their dogsand that in Australia fathers will sacrifice their children in order that themothers may be able to nourish thisuseful servant of man The Chinesehowever tend and fatten their dogscarefully to eat They also considerthe cat a choice dish Abbe Le Noir inTravels in the Far East relates thatin the markets of many cities are tobe seen dogs and cats hanging sideby side by the head or tail and thaton most farms these animals are keptin little coops like hencoops Theyremain thus from two to three weekscondemned to almost complete immobility and are fed on nothing but amixture of rice and farina We do notknow the edible dog or the edible catin France but probably since the siegethey have been but little served openly at least on the tables of Paris restaurants At Peking and throughoutChina however there is no dainty repast without its fillet or leg of dogthe cat is rather a dish of the poorerclassesThese same customs that are so repulsive to us as to seem like a kind ofsemi cannibalism existed neverthelessamong the people of classic antiquityHistory tells us that in early timesthe dog was always regarded as anedible animal The inhabitants ofcertain nomes of Egypt piously embalmed their dead dogs but others considered that it was more in conformityto the doctrines of a wise economy tokill and eat them Plutarch tells usthat the dwellers in Cynopolis wheredogs were honored as divine made waron the Oxyrinchis who had committedthe sacrilege of eating dogs In hisbook on Diet Hippocrates speakingof common articles of food is of theopinion that the flesh of the dog givesheat and strength but is difficult ofdigestion Our fathers says Plinyregarded small dogs as so pure a foodthat they used them for expiatory victims Even to day young dogs flesh isserved at feasts held in honor of thegods And further on This meatwas used in the installation feasts ofthe pontiffs According to Apiciuswho has left us a curious treatise OnCookery the Jtomans ate also adultdogsThe savages of North America forlack of provisions often sacrifice theircompanions of the chase We are toldthat before the introduction of cattlethe Spaniards in Mexico used the native dogs so freely as food that the species has now completely disappearedAccording to Capt Cook the natives ofNew Zealand ate their dogs and clothedthemselves in she skins Forster addsThey love the flesh passionately andprefer it to that of the pig TheGreenlanders and the Kamchatkansalso sometimes eat their dogs but onlywhen reduced to this cruel extremityby famine In Africa dogs form thefood of certain negro tribes in theAshantee country the flesh is eatenboth fresh and dried And it appearsthat in the lower Congo region amongthe Batekes there is a custom that mustmake every friend

TownsIt is really remarkable what a partthe hog pen plays in the well beingand prosperity of the country Thereare in the United States 30000 or 40000villages of different sizes and the mostof them have hog pens and typhoidfever The connection is uniform anddirect The hog pen supplies the causeand the fever or some disease closelyallied to it is- the effectIt has taken a long while to convinceeven the most intelligent settlementsof the value of scientific sanitation andin the large cities it is a constant fightto abate nuisances and compel peopleto observe ordinary laws of cleanlinessBut in the villages it is much worseThe populations cannot see the necessity of the new fangled notions as theycall them and any interference of aboard of health is an outrage and animpertinence We know of villageswhere the doctors have been laboringin vain for years to eliminate the hogpen Their efforts are ridiculed andthe hog pens and the fevers whichwould never exist but for the uncleanliness remainAfter awhile the people of these smallplaces will see the importance of a different policy When they realize thatthe existence of hog pens in a community will keep away all settlerswhose presence would be desirable andwhen they see their property depreciating in value because no one wants tolive in villages where no attempt ismade to prevent disease but everythingis done

century agoand came to Mexico with Gen Taylor tofight against the people of this countryprobably did not think that should theyfall in battle their bones would be leftto orunible to dust in an unmarkedspot in this distant land But to day thedead heroes of the Buena Vista battlefield lie under but a few feet of earthin a neglected place just outside thiscity At the time of their hasty burialtheir devoted comrades evidently sough tTto xuake the spot somewhat sacred byconstructing an adobe wall around itThis wall is fast succumbing to the ravages of time and in places it is convpletely gone I visited the burial groundof the dead heroes recently A tram-car took me as far as the pretty SanFrancisco plaza and from there I walkedthrough a dirty narrow street until 1came to an arroyo on the other side ofwhich the faint marks indicating thecemetery may be seen Had I not received careful directions I would havepassed the place unnoticed On the sidetoward the city the wall is entirely gonefor the most part and a much traveledwagon road passes through the placeand over the sacred dead The placewhich had once been inclosed by theadobe Avail embraces probably twoacres but investigation shows thatmany were buried west of the wall andup close to the arroyoSome time ago the report was published in the press of the United Statesthat the bones of the buried soldiersvere protruding from the ground andthat the place presented a sickeningspectacle This report was not strictlytrue but it is undoubtedly a fact thatparts of many of the skeletons havecome to the surface The ground isstrewn with fragments of bones and iti evident that they come from the menwho were buried there None of thesebones is large as the heavy trafficthrough the place has broken them upinto small pieces If any skulls came tothe surface they were no doubt quicklytakenby the Mexican children who wereabout and made innocent playthingsof Had they ever appeared they certainly would not have remained intacton the surface long In the arroyothrough which floods of water pass attimes and wash one side of the burialground there are also many pieces ofbones among the rocks and amongthem I saw an unbroken rib bone whichlooked like that of a humanThere is not a spear of grass nor asign of vegetable life within the inclosure It is perfectly barren The placeshould certainh receive attention at thehands of the United States congresseven if nothing more is done than totake such steps as will stay the ravagesof time and weather on the treacheroussoil and permit the bodies lying thereto rest undisturbed It could easily bemade an attractive and even beautifulplace by laying- it out in walks andplanting trees and plants The ravagesof the floods in the arroyo on the soil ofthe cemeter3 could be checked by thebuilding of a substantial wall along thatside In addition to the several hundred who were killed in battle all of thesoldiers who died in the hospital hereWere also buried there St

indebted to my good friendJFelix Depaille professor of musicin our town for the following- storywhich happened in those bad old dayswhen scoundrels who were expert withweapons terrorized over a whole citybecause the insane code of honor compelled an inoffensive citizen to go outto meet certain death at the hands ofa ruffian who had wantonly insultedhimAh those days mon ami said Depaille so different from my life nowYou love not the duello in Englandyou laugh at us and beat a man withyour brutal arms and fists when he insults you That recalls to mind theEnglishman who came to Dijon 50 60years ago and fought a duel Ah buthe was a drole that EnglishmanIt is a good story I can see I saidglancing at Depailles deep set eyessparklingYou will love it inon ami but inthose days I was furious against yourbrutal ways I have learnt better sinceThisEnglishmanseeyou came to DijonHe was great and rich and he wasnamed Sir Evelyn Booth Baronet but inthose days we did not understand yourEnglish titles and we called him MiloriSir Lord Booth He was young and veryrich and he roamed about France withIhis attendant who was his secretarytoe3iiaps remaining a day in one placep month in another He was a greattall man with powerful limbs but hewas lazy oh so lazy when he seatedhimself it was to sprawl on three chairsle looked upon us as an inferior raceand was very insolent and arrogantbut spent lavishly Also he disdainedto speak our language which he calledlingo and M Pointon his secretary interpreted for him Milor I assure youWas well known in the city where hestayed three weeksNow at that time Pollinet one of themost infamous duelists was residingin Dijon where he had made himselffeared but when Milor Booth came toDijon Pollinet to the relief of goodcitizens was away in Paris and therewere many who hoped he might meeta better man than himself in the capital and never return But they weredisappointed Pollinet returned moreinsolent than everYou must understand that Pollinetprofessed to have the greatest hatredfor the English whom he declared wereall brutal ignorant and clumsy unfitfor association with a refined race andto kill whom was a duty and a serviceto humanity At that time you werejiot popular amongst us it is often sojny friend and these sentiments werelooked upon as highly patriotic andwere applauded by his friends Whatmore natural than that on his return toDijon he was told of the rich EnglishMilor who was what you call swaggering about the city in his insolent wayAh said Pollinet one of that accursed race in this city Well we shallsee we shall see If it be possible toforce him to fight there shall be oneless of those insolent fools Bah but Idoubt it They are cowards and willlick the dust rather than fight Whereis he to be foundHe is staying at the Hotel Lisbonbut he is often in the cafes said Braconnier a big bellied loud voiced fellow who looked up to Pollinet as hismaster- To night then said Pollinet witha meaning smile This Pollinet I musttell you was a great fellow of nearlysix feet broad and plump and a verygood liver He must have the best andplenty of it and he daily increased inembonpoint though he lost little of hisactivity With rapiar or pistol he wassupreme and it was said that he hadalready gilled his 21st He had servedin the army as a colonel so he declaredthough there were some who could takean oath that he began life as a bakersapprentice and was afterwards valetto Col de la TourniesThat evening Pollinet sent three ofhis friends out into the city to obtainnews of the Englishman and presently Braconnier returned breathless tosay that Milor had just entered theCafe Grande Monarque in Rue PelissierCome then my friends said Pollinet with a laugh let us call on thisterrible Englishman You shall havegood sport on the word of Pollinetunless he is a coward And even inthat case I shall terrify himLaughing gleefully Pollinet and sixof his friends set out for the cafe Theywere in luck Milor was there sprawling as usual He was seated with abottle of wine at one of the tables nearthe door with a chair for each footand he disdained to raise his head whenthe party entered M Pointon in appearance a gentleman was sipping winewith him and they only spoke in monosyllables at long intervalsPollinet smiled significantly at hiscompanions and they took the nearesttable to vhe Englishman but still Milordid not deign to raise his headPollinet called for wine for theparty and then remarked loudly Pahsurely 1 can smell an EnglishmanThere must be one of those island pigsnear me The rest laughed loudlyaud all turned their eyes to Milor buthe did not even raise his eyes though-the secretary east one searching glancein Pollinets directionAh resumed Pollinet there areEnglish yonder and the smell nauseates me Look at that mans bulkandhis boorish pose Those barbarousislandersAgain the party laughed and Pointon whispered something to his master who yawned and made some curtreply4The attack was not succeeding sowell as Pollinet had expected and itwas like throwing stones at a woodenfigure and he became angry and senta waiter for Blanc the proprietorWhat do you mean Blanc saidPollinet raising his voice so that hecould be heard all over the room byallowing pigs of Englishmen to defile your establishment which we honorby our custom Turn them out instantlySh sh monsieur said the unhappy Blanc in a whisper I beg pardon but it is an English milor and hisattendantAs I know and I tell you to turnthem out unless you want to lose ourcustomPoor Blanc afraid of offendingeither party was white and perspiringat every pore But monsieur he stammered forgive me but he he payswell Likewise he is terrible and II dare notObey instantly insolent said Pollinet arrogantly unless you seek ruinWhere is your patriotismBefore he could reply there came aprovidential intervention for the cowardly proprietor At that momentPointon approached the party with aninsolent smile on his f ace A thousandpardons messieurs he said sweetlybut monsieur my master is annoyedby your loud tones especially yoursmonsieur indicating- Pollinet with abow He begs of you either to moderate your voice keep silence or leavethe room and he bowed to themagainPollinets friends could not helpsmiling at this courteous but effectivecounter thrust and the bravo sprangup livid and dumb with f ury The secretary had not waited for his replybut returned to his seat and Pollinetfollowed close on his heels and plantedhimself before Milor who did notchange his posture but looked on thepassion inflamed face of the bravo withlazy contempt as one might look on asnarling mongrelYou island pig said Pollinet hisvoice thick with passion You dareorder me to be silent insolent scumbarbarian Go back to your filthy island go before I whip you and hetook Milors hat from his head andflung it towards the door Follow yourFLOORED THE FRENCHMANhat said he dancing round the talblein his rageThe Englishman yawned slowlyraised himself and looked at Pollinetwith unmoved countenance Ask himhe said to his secretary in English ifhe is a clown or if he means it for aninsultAn insult screamed Pollinet Yesyes he shall go back to his barbarousisland a corpseVery well then We have choice ofweapons I believe said Pointon for hismasterYes yes swords or pistols as youchoose at any time I will kill youcried PollinetIt shall be now said the secretarycoolly and called for the proprietorwho came as obsequious and craven asever Yes if messieurs needed it hehad a large room very retired Butmessieurs would recollect that he was apoor manAt a sign from Milor Pointon cuthim short Lead the way he saidMessieurs to Pollinet and his friendsfollow pleaseBlanc led him to a deserted room atthe back of the house got water andsponges at Pointons orders and thenthe door was closed upon him Thebaronet locked it and stood with hisback against it looking intensely boredMonsieur said Pointon addressing Pollinet and speaking very coldlymy principal has choice of weaponsand he ordains that the duel shall befought in this room and immediatelyPlease to nominate your secondMy friend M Georges will act forme said Pollinet drawing himself uparrogantly Allow me to remark youbetray ignorance of etiquette monsieur in calling us all herePerhaps so but I had a purpose Iwished you to hear my

before him What he screamedis this an insult Fists OutrageousHave you no notions of honor you English Name your weapons I sayI have already done so said Pointon with a grim smileAnd we refuse cried GeorgesYour suggestion is an insultMy principal has been insultedsaid Pointon coolly he demands satisfaction and has chosen his weaponsne Jj renchmen were instantly a jabbering jesticulating group It wasmonstrous Outrageous An unheard-THE BOUEBON JTEWS PBIDAY OCTOBER 15 1897of insult Pollinet would of course revfuse so insulting a business and so onMilor at this juncture made some re-I mark to his secretary who raising hisvoice above the hubbub saidMy principal has been insulted hdemands satisfaction and if monsieuris not ready in five minutes he willthrash himAgain there was a confusion oftongues They would not stay to be insulted any longer they would leave tharoom and publish the Englishmansbaseness to the world But Milor stoodwith his back against the door with agrim smile on his lips and there was notone of them who cared to ask him tomovePresently Milor glanced at his watchand then began to divest himself of hiscoat and vest Is your principal going to defend himself like a man or bewhipped as a coward asked Pointonof GeorgesAgain there was a torrent of speechespecially from Georges and Pollinetmade no preparation Very welltime said the secretary and Milorsquared up to his opponent who waslivid and touched him lightly on thecheekI warn you said Pointon politelyto Georges that monsieur will find itdifficult to fight in his coat Once moreare you readyA moment said Georges and therewas a hurried consultation among thesix who were thoroughly cowed afterwhich Georges spoke We protestagainst this he said but M Pollinetwill fight But we shall demand satisfaction for the outrageYou shall have it said Pointongayly In silence Pollinet was divestedof his coat and vest and faced the Englishman with far less confidence thanone would expect from such a herof Time called Pointon again and theencounter began Milors ennui hadgone he was no longer a drawling blasearistocrat but an athlete He began bydealing a light blow on his opponentsnose which drew blood and broughtsuch a comical look of surprise on hisface that Pointon could not restrain hismerriment But the next moment thebravo broke into a fury and rushed onMilor his hands going like windmillsThe baronet played with him contenting himself with warding off the blowsapd only occasionally dealt one himselftill at last he floored the FrenchmanAvith a left hander on the jawHis friends crowded round Pollinethelplessly gesticulating and chatteringand Pointon had to sponge his face andfan himBrutal Brutal exclaimed Georgesin a state of fiery indignationTime said Pointon looking at hiswatch and unwillingly the bravo wasmade to rise and face his antagonistThe duellists attack was more feeblethis time and Milor punished him alittle more severely finally sending himto the ground again moaning andgroaning Again hands and voices wereraised in horrorGeorges bent over him and thenturned to Pointon Monsieur he saidxgetting his words out with difficultyhonor is satisfied my principal acknowledges defeatNo no said Milor condescendingto speak French for the first time thisis a duel to the death you must remember Monsieur who has sent so manymen to death will not appreciate an encounter in which neither his antagonistnor himself is killedA groan of utterest indignation wentthrough the group The brutality of theEnglishman Was it not incredibleThey would publish the affair all overthe city all over FranceAs you like said the baronet witha grim delight that made their heartssink I did not begin the business remember and what I call brutality is toinsult an inoffensive man and then assassinate him Come pig addressingthe prostrate bravo get upThere was more protest but the baronet was inflexible and again Pollinethad to face him And the Englishmanfought to punish this time He delivered his blows with strength andscience till the bravo made no attemptto retaliate but with his hands beforehis face and groaning at every blowsought to escape his antagonist Butit was useless Milor meant to teach astern lesson and with his antagonistscreaming for mercy he finished with aterrific blow between the eyes that sentPollinet crashing to the floor where helay senselessThe baronet stood over him Asthis is a coward he said in tones of thegreatest contempt spurning the bodywith his foot as this is a coward I refuse to soil my hands any longer on hiscowardly carcass But I give you to understand that if I meet him again inthis city or elsewhere I shall claim tofinish our duel Pointon assist me todressIn dead silence the baronet put onhis coat and with a polite Bon soirthey left the room and returned to thepublic room to finish their wine as ifnothing had occurredThe next day The Duel of the MadMilor was in the papers and on everybod3s tongue and though wonder wasexpressed at the barbarian eccentricities of Messieurs les Anglais there wasrejoicing at the punishment meted outto the bravo who had long been a terrorto the city Pollinet was

Feet Below the SurroundTerritoryA hole in the ground has been transformed into a veritable paradise Ahole in the ground is what most peoplecalled the place before Perrine beganhis work of transformation Some withwider flow of language called it theDevils Corrall It is on Snake riverin southern Idaho 20 miles south of thelittle town of Shoshone and five milesdown theriver below the great Shoshonefalls The hole is about 700 feet deepand embraces COO or 700 acres of bottomsurfaceFor ages and ages this Devils Corral has just been staying here silentjhastly unknown The prehistoric people and I fancy the Indians of laterdate passed around it when fishingalong the Snake river The more daringwhite man looked at it gave it a nameand made money out of other white menby bringing them along to see it Oneadventurous personage about a halfwhite man decided that down in thedepths of this great basin beside theriver there ought to be gold Accompanied by an Indian wife or two andhalf a dozen children he clambereddown located amine and began to workit His progress is not worth recordinsrBurt Perrine a young man from Indiana seeking his fortune in the westcame out to see the Great Shoshonefalls and to see this satanic corral Heclambered down the cliff to where theminer was He was not impressed bythe mine but he was impressed by thesituation and general appearance of thisrock walled basin His first thoughtwas The north wind can never findits way down here This place ought toDe transformed into a ranch or a truckgarden or a fruit farmUpon closer examination he foundthat if the rocks were rolled out of theway and the miscellaneous bushesaround were grubbed up and burnedthere would be several hundred acres ofvery choice soil In the highest part othis big basin he discovered connectectogether two glorious cold water lakesThey were 40 to 50 feet deep and thetwo covered about an acres of spaceThey were as clear as crystal as blueas the sky above them with white sandglistening in the bottom and very livelytrout of the mountain sort dartingthrough them From these lakes theentire basin could be easily irrigatedAgain the undertaking was the almost incalculable amount of worknecessary to clear and level and irrigate the land the uncertainty as towhat the winters that brought snow sixfeet deep over all the plains abovemight do down here and the possiblepower of the north wind to find its waydown after aH As an additional menRce to the undertaking there stoodgiant lava Avails towering above from500 to 800 feet and sloping from an angleDf 70 degrees to a straight perpendicular These lava walls burnt rent tornand twisted into confusing shaplessnessby the fires of former ages seemed nowas enduring as timeHe went away and advised with hisfriends about it They told him he wascrazy Without exception they laughedat the idea of putting this great holein the ground to any useful purposeThey said that even the solitary minerwas half witted or he wouldnt try toget gold dust out of there But he decided to put his opinions to the test andbought out the claim of the miner soas to have the hole all to himself Hesurveyed the place and found that itcontained 420 acres that could be workedor reclaimed Hehomesteadedapartofthe land and made a desert entry on thebalanceThen he began the work of transformation He managed to blaze out alongthe rocky descent a trail down whichpack animals could travel and it maybe well to remark just here that the little mules and the little burros used inthis country can almost climb a tree orwalk into a well To do the work necessary down in this corral Mr Perrinehad to have wagons scrapers harrowsplows powder and dynamite and allsorts of things to work with that evenpack animals couldnt carry These hadto be let down with ropes over a perpendicular lava wall of GOO feet Theywere so let down Think for a momentof the care and work that this requiredBut to get a road up that 700 feet ofmiscellaneous precipice was the realpuzzle Perrine had done some surveying and a little railroad engineeringback in Indiana and he thought hecould build a road here By the use ofmuch dynamite more powder all thearts of removing rock that wouldnt beremoved and a paradoxical amount ofpersistent work the road was gradedand built It dbes much winding in andout up and down back and forth asideand across and at a general glance ithas more the appearance of a stairwaythan of a road Yet two horse and fourhorse teams easily travel it and thetraffic that goes up it and down it is amarvel to the beholderGoing down this road excites a verypleasing feeling One cannot see morethan 20 steps ahead Now the horsesseem approaching a rocky wall now ayawning precipice Suddenly withoutany warning whatever the wagon haltsalmost

MerinosPROHIBITIONISTS NEAT TRICKHow a Mississippi Schoolmaster Defeated the Enemies of ReformSuperintendent Greenwood of thefity schools tells a good story on afriend of his Prof Morrison in Mississippi whom he visited last winterDown in that state there are many negroes and the colored vote is a materialfactor in politics It is a constant struggle between the different political parties to control this vote and many peculiar means are resorted to Thestory related by Mr Greenwood ij a fairexample of the way the negro is workedon election day by his white friendsdown in DixieIn the little town where Prof Morrison lives and where he is superintendent of the city schools said ProfGreenwood the people were calledupon to vote on the question of localoption a short time ago Mr Morrisonoccupying the position that he did andbeing a man of gentle habits and agood church member naturally waschosen to lead the prohibition factionand during the campaign he waged abitter fight against the saloons Everything seemed favorable for a grand prohibition victory until a day or two before the election when the negroescame in from the plantations and begantanking up on the free whisky supplied them by the enemies of reformMorrison realized that the power toturn the election lay in the colored voteand he at once set to work to head offhis opponents and the facts show thatthe shrewd little schoolmaster wasequal to the emergencyThe night before the election afterthe saloon men had exhausted their efforts and had gone to their homes withthe confidence that victory would betheirs on the morrow the professorwent to work among the darkies Hetold them that he had a piece of newground he wanted cleared up and thathe would give each of them 2 a dayand board as long as the work wouldlast the time it would take to do thework depending altogether on thenumber of men that he could getEvery negro in town promised tobring an ax and be at the appointedplace at daylight The next morning adozen wagons were in waiting to transport the men down in the river bottomswhere the timber was to be cut Twotrips were made before all of them weregotten out of town but when the saloon men came down the next mornincrthere were not a dozen negroes to beseen They were mystified and did notlearn of the trick that had been playedon them until it was too late and prohibition carried the dayA big dinner was prepared for thedarkies out in the woods when the noonhour came and they were made happyat sundown by being given two brightsilver dollars each and told that thejob was finished This was considered ashrewd piece of work on the part of MrMorrison and Ae has since become aconsiderable power in Mississippi politics Kansas City JournalHOUSEHOLD HINTSSome Little Things 3Vhich the

Ovange Judd FarmerHOW TO KLEEP ONIONSTlicy Must Be Handled Quite as carefully as ApplesHalf the secret of keeping onionswell is in housing them in aperfectlydry sound condition If to be sold before cold weather keep in any dry placewith plenty of air a loose floor whereair can pass up through them is bestFor winter use keep at a low temperature if kept from actual freezingthere is no danger of the temperaturebeing too low They must be kept drybut if they become frozen they shouldnot be handled merely covered andkept in the dark until the frost gradually leaves them It is not the freezing which does the mischief but moving them whep frozen and repeatedthawing and withdrawing of frostWherever the essential conditions prevail of uniformly low dry temperatureabsence of light and not too severefrost they may be safely stored forwinter Moisture and heating in bulkshould be guarded against To avoidgathering moisture and heating thebulbs should not be over two feet deepbetter less If too

them Always handlethem as carefully as apples as evenslight bruises cause them to mold orrot M FarmerThin Cream from CowIt does not pay to let cows get -verythin in flesh for if they do both theamount and quality of their milk willbe impaired for the ensuing year Anold farmer once said that when grainand especially corn was plenty andcheap he could always look for a profitable butter yield from his dairy Thereis such a thing as feeding too heavilywith corn thus fattening the cow anddeeceasing her milk yield No goodfarmer is likely to make this mistakeThese are very few herds of cows whichcannot profitably be fed much moregrain than they now receive It is forthis reason that we urge all farmers togrow corn for home feeding It wilihe fed much more freely if grown onthe farm than if it has to be purchasedAmerican CultivatorParis Green a Good RemedyParis green and water used at therate of about one pound to 150 gallonsof water is perhaps the simplest andbest remedy for all insects that eat

BeMfor a Long- TimeA notalble feature in connection witkthe leading live stock markets is thestrong demand for calves that has prevailed for several months past says theNebraska Farmer Prices of courserule high under these circumstancesand considering the character of suchmeager supply as is offered for salefarmers who are looking for stock totake the place of older cattle shippedout should bear in mind Franklinsmaxim that one can easily pay too dearfor his whistle Speaking generally thecalves that come from the dairy districtwill not make very profitable beef animals and in considering the questienwhether to invest in them or not thequality of the young stuff and its probable outcome in view of the fact thatthey are dairy calves must be borne inmind Of course when one cannotdo as well as he would like he must doas well as he can but high prices forcalves that areinf erior from the breeders standpoint present a conditionthat makes one hesitate about whatconstitutes doing as well as one canWhatever may be the conclusion as tothe most expedient course for the immediate present the remoter teaching isnot faT to seek Farmers in the beeigrowing regions should learn from itthe unwisdom so long as they are suchheavy growers of graii and forage thatmustbe fed out on the farm of reiyingupon others for animals to which to feedLhem When the beef section of thecountry is fairly well supplied and haspretty nearly enough it can probablyrely on other sections for enough to fillout the balance of its needs since in thatcase prices of young cattle would notbe likely to go skyward under the influence of strong demand but it cannotpermit its home grown supply to fall solow as to compel it to rely largely uponpurchases When this is done and goodfield crops are raised the farmer

NEWSMICE IN BTGDEMXNDA New Toy That Has Caused TheirPrice t Rise to Ten Ceaits ApieceNot a little attention has been attracted recently by the advertisementof a Westfield Mass firm offering fivecents each for live mice in any quantityBo badly are the mice wanted by theconcern that the offer was soon afterward raised to ten centsfor each andEvery live mouse deliveredSome weeks ago a shoe dealer arranged in his window an exhibition oflive mice and a teeter board A mouserunning up the little board would incline it in the opposite direction andas the livety little creatures scamperedback and forth over the board it wouldbe almost continuously teeteringThe show attracted much attentionand other inventive minds saw its possibilities as an advertising scheme andimproved on it by replacing the teeterboard by an inclined disk which rotated rapidly when theanice ran over itssurface From the disk vwas evolved ahat or umbrella teetotum This is themost advanced stageA toy company quickty saw its possibilities and arranged to put the thingon the market An agent with thepie case of the attractions was sentto the large cities of the central andmiddle states and he had but to sliowit to make a sale on the spotThe company now has orders far beyond its powers to fill the chief causoof delay being the scarcity of miceThat is why the priqe of the rodentsis quoted at ten cents in Westfield

department from thoUnited States consul at Barmen He Jsays that while there was a decrease inthe exports from that consular districtto the United States during the firstthree quarters of the last fiscal yearthere was a- marked increase in the lastquarter Shipments were so large thatsteamship tariffs were raised The obvious intention was to supply the demands -of the United States market before the Dingley tariff took effect The manufactories of cutlery were working day and nightbut by the end of August allwere idle thousands of workmen hadlost their employment and it will boquite awhile

MACHINERYEastero Cotton Mills Cannot CompeteTvith Tlione in tlie SouthA gentleman in Yorkville S C interested in cotton goods manufacture saida few days ago reports the CharlestonS C News and Courier that the inability of the New England cottonmillsto compete with the southern mills isnot due so much to short days highpriced labor and freights as it is to thefact that many of the southern millsare comparatively new and have thelatest improved machines He saidthat a friend who had recentlyexamined a number of the NewEngland mills had informed himthat most of them were using antiquated machines and that only four orfive were up to date and one of thesewas engaged in the manufacture of machinery and used its product in its ownmillWater Tanks for ClrurclieMr J C Merryiweather a manufacturer of

prescribed-treatment of the physicians often at the-expense of hundreds of dollars to findliimselfj no better as time goesby still a cure will result from the rightremedy SSS no matter what othertreatment has failedThe reason that SSS Swifts Specific has so successfully cured even theworst cases after other treatment hadbeen tried in vain is that it is the onlyremedy which forces the poison fromthe llood and permanently eliminatesat from the system which is the onlycorrect principle of curing the diseaseMercurial remedies bottle up the poisonand tear down the system while SSSforces out the poison and builds up andadds strength and vigor to the entiresystem It is natures remedy and contains no harmful ingredientMr Charles Glenn of 1563 Dudley StCincinnati is one of the

deepseatedand one by one they failed The largered blotches increased in size and number and soon covered my entire bodyMy parents had me treated by a number of physicians but the disease wastoo much

Plain Facts -Grave errors injustice wrongs ofgreater or less degree arise from lackof knowledge of the truth and morefrequently from deceptionThe most infamous case on recordof deception and injustice is the attempt to demonetize silver as a moneyof final redemption in the UnitedStatesThere is no learned judge skilledlawyer or court of justice that iscapable of reconciling the effort withthe constitutional laws that governthe issue of money in this countryThe people have been deceivedofficials in power chosen to administer justice under the laws haveignored their sworn duty and givenaid to the scheme that has paralyzedindustry reduced -property valuesone half and beggared millionsThere isno authority of law eitherspecific or by inference by whichgold alone is made the only moneywith

SpectatorBUTTERWORTHS THEORYHis Iienlent Way of Treating For Reformation Embryo CriminalsCommissioner of Patents Butterworthis one of the men who believe that aprosecuting attorney is better engagedin side tracking embryo criminals onthe road to perdition and getting themon the road to righteousness than incorralling them for shipment to thepenitentiary where they are throwninto association with professional crooksSeveral years ago Major Butterworthwas prosecuting attorney in southernOhio and he had the opportunity to testhis theory regarding the discriminationthat should be used in dealing withmen newly launched into crime Ayoung farmer was arrested for passingcounterfeit shinplasters as the 50 centnote was known and the case was putin the hands of Major ButterworthThe young man told his story He hadsaved several hundred dollars had lefthis wife and little children and Ladtaken a boat down the Mississippi riverpurposing to settle on a new farm hewas to buy with his hard earned savings On the boat he met an extremelypleasant and well dressed stranger wholearned of his mission and proceeded tomake himself agreeable In a momentof extreme confidence the stranger foldthe young man of a large quantity ofmoney he had which was made fromplates that had formerly belonged to thegovernment and which the governmenthad long since sought to recover etcThe young man was struck by that remarkable method of acquiring wealthwhen he had toiled and saved for yearsto get his few hundred In a burst ofgenerosity the stranger offered to exchange some of his money for greenbacks belonging to his new foundfriend so that the latter should havetwo dollars for every one he possessedThe bait was tempting and the fish bitAt the next landing the well dressedman disappeared from the boat and thedupe became alarmed He became suspicious of his new money and wasafraid to offer it in payment of his passage He too left the boat determinedto go back home He started to walkand became footsore He began shovingthe money to buy something to eat tliecounterfeit was discovered and tile arrest was made Major Butterworthjookin the situation fI told that young man he said inrelating the story that if God hadmade him a dishonest man he had failedto put a sign on his face I told him togo home to his wife and children as anhonest man He could scarcely realizethat he had escaped the penitentiaryHe went home and a more honest orbetter citizen I do not know todayThat man had not the heart of a criminal but if he had been sent to the -penitentiaryhis children would have beendisgraced for life and probably he wouldhave belonged to the criminal class forlife St Louis RepublicAnts Witli Pluck and Brains1To the intellectuality of ants yrhichmen like Sir John Lubbock have alwaysdelighted to point out a new proof hasbeen added by the observations of awell known scientist Professorwho has communicated it to theVenetian institute He noticed tnat theants used as a bridge the twig of a treewhich touched a house they were desirous of reaching He accordingly cut offthe end of the twig so that it was impossible for them to get across and thenwatchedAfter the lapse of half an hour however he found that the processionwhich he had stopped had reformeditself He proceeded to investigate thematter and he found that the little antshad discovered that there was anothertwig which when it was blown by thebreeze touched the wall now and thenThe army of ants had formed up inline to this twig and whenever thebreeze blew it against the wall the foremost members of the band took advantage of the opportunity to get acrossMan with all his boasted geniuscould da nothing more for not only didthe operation require clever timing butabsolute confidence in making whatunder the
