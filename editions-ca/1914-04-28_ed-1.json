Two models which show how the
government sells its timber have just'
been prepared in Washington, for 'dis
play at the forest products exposi
tion, to be held in Chicago, April 30
to May 9, and in New York, May 20
to 30. These models represent an
acre of yellow pine land in a National
forest of the Southwest before and af
ter logging.
In the model showing the stand be
fore the lumberman goes into it,- the
trees range from those only a few
years old to large, overmature, stag
headed individuals more than ready
for the ax. In the second model the
mature trees and all others larger
than a certain diameter, have been
cut down and made into logs and
cordwood. In this, as in all govern
ment sales, the stumps are cut low
to avoid unnecessary waste, logs in
to evoid unnecessary waste, logs
are taken1 to a small diameter well
up in the tree, and such material as
is not fit for lumber i& converted into
cordwood.. Together,, the models
