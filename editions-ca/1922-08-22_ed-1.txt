" v V xh i' R HK B. jH feTHE BUUKbUN MEWSTHE STEIKE SITUATIONThere is no danger of the "bigfour" railroad transportation brotherhoods being drawn into a sympathetic strike, even should negotiations to end the strike of the shopcrafts "workers fail.This was the declaration made byWarren S. Stone, president of thehrotherhood of locomotive engineers,and D. B. Robertson, president ofthe brotherhood of locomative firemen and engineers, on their returnto their homes in Cleveland, Ohio,from New York and Washington,where for ten days they have attempted to mediate the shopmen'scontroversies. vNeither would comment on theprogress of the negotiations. "Ican't make any comment on the progress of the negotiations," Mr. Stonesaid. "Too much has been said already." "We were acting as mediatorsand mediators only prejudice theirusefulness by talking," Mr. Robertson said. "I would rather not bsasked to say anything until the conferences are over. I can't make anypredictions now."Asked what position the brotherhood will be in if the negotiationsfail, Mr. Stone said they "will be inthe same position they were in before. The strike 'will simply go on."Mr. Stone also refused to comment on President Harding's address placing the strike situationbefore Congress, which he said President Harding had discussed withthe brotherhood chiefs.PROTEST HIGH STREET BEINGMADE SPEEDWAYResidents of High street are making a vigorous protest againts thestreet being used a speedway foraspiring motorists and recklessspeedsters. A Paris business manwho resides on South High streetcalled THE NEWS yesterday afternoon and asked to call attention ofthe authorities of the city to theutter disregard of life and limb andthe anti-speed ordinances, shown bythese drivers, especially on Sundayafternoon and night. He stated thatat times it was almost impossible toSet across the street, except at therisk of being run over by the speeddemons. Cutouts wide open, lightless headlights, machines left standing with engine running, in fact, almost every conceivable kind of vio" lation of the speed laws that are especially prohibited by ordinance,were noted by him, forming the basis for his complaint.&"THE PRIDEMr. Albert Perling is now in NewYork and together with our resident buyer is purchasing , NewFall Materials and Furnishings.Every effort is being made tosecure the greatest possible valuesfor our customers.

Sterling . . . . 9Winchester .There were three shutout gamesin the Blue Grass League Thursday,batting averages being devasted everywhere except in the Maysvillelineup. But strange as it may seem,each of these games was played intwo hours and ten minutes. Thereisn't much speed, especially forpitchers' battles. In the threegames only seven runs were scored.It took eleven innings of heartbreaking baseball for the Mammothsto down their jinx opponents, theLexington Studebakers, at LeaguePark Saturday. The game seesawedback and forth, gooseggs being plentiful, Paris finally putting across awinning run in the eleventh inning.The score was tied ' several times,then somebody would pull off someplay that relieved the tension. Thesum and substance of the story isthat Paris won the game by a scoreof 6 to 5. For the first five inningsit seemed to the spectators that theParis team was doing all they couldto give the game to their opponents,or the old Lexington hoodoo wasstill working. But by hard hittingand fast fielding after they had become thoroughly awake, Paris overcame the Studies and landed a vie-'tory. Brockman hurt his finger sobadly in the ninth inning that hewas forced to retire from the game,Hurst taking his place behind thebat. Parsons, who took the moundafter he had gone in to run forBlakefield in the ninth, pitched winning ball, and gets credit for thegame. Cicona's running catch inthe fourth inning robbed CharlieEllis of a ' three-bagger. Parsonsdid not allow a hit in the two innings he pitched. The batterieswere: For Paris Parsons, Blakefield, Brockman and Hurst; for Lexington Walton and Monk. Time ofgame, two hours and forty minutes.Eilers umpired.Lexington came right back atParis in the game played at LeaguePark, Sunday afternoon, and, in thepresence of what was undoubtedlythe largest crowd of the season, defeated the victors of the day beforeby the score of 8 to 4. Paris usedall their pitchers in an effort todown the Studies, but the odds wereagainst them. The game was a batting rampage, with Lexington hammering the ball to all parts of thelot, and Paris chasing. Dean,twirling for Lexington, held Parissafe. Bush Meadows, Lexingtonoutfielder, hit the ball for a homerover the center field fence in theseventh inning, and some cynical observer asserted that it was passingCynthiana when last heard from.The drive brought in Monahan andEllis, who had singled ahead of him.This same homer sent Parsons tothe bench, Blakefield and Hurst finished the game. The absence ofBrockman, whose finger was hurt ina previous game, caused a considerable change in the Paris line-up.Hurst has played every position onthe Paris infield, plus pitcher andcatcher. Nippert covered himselfwith glory by pulling down a longhit by Ellis that seemed good forthree bases, taking the ball almostoff the top of the fence. The batteries were: For Paris, Wills, Parsons,Blakefield, Hurst and Macke. Timeof game, two hours and twenty-fiveminutes. Eilers umpired.Rush Meadows, who performedso spectacularly for the Lexingtonteam in Sunday's game, will be inthe right field garden for the Paristeam in the game with Lexington atLeague Park, Thurjjday. Valentine,the best in the 'business, will be onthe twirling mound, which is ampleguarantee of increased gate receiptsand a big attendance. Billy Kuhlman, old Blue Grass League star,will play third base in this game.Kuhlman will be remembered as oneof the best third sackers who everheld a mitt in the old Blue GrassLeague.Rmors to the effect that Paris hadiven releases to several members ofthe pitching" staff , which were current on the streets yesterday, . weredeclared to be without foundation,t according-f tp ' good " authority.

Goodman, of Paris, in arecent article, in .The Democrat, asfollows:"What is a mystery to Cynthianafans is why Umpire Goodman is notassigned to more games in whichour team plays? Goodman is without doubt the best umpire in theleague and always gives each teamwhat is coming to it. But insteadof Goodman, Cynthiana has to putup with Bob Spade at home andsuch as Webb on the road. Spade isa good umpire when the moon andother signs are right, but theyhaven't been right for Bob' for sometime. Webb is no umpire at all.It is said that Business ManagerJess Morton, of the Lexington club,refused to allow Webb to umpire ina game in that city recently andthat he had Goodman sent there.Goodman had been assigned to theWinchester-Cynthiana gme and byMorton's request the change wasmade. Cynthiana should try to havethat stunt pulled on Spade andWebb". Goodman was at the parkand umpired bases.

Will Go to Australia toMake Astronomical, ObservationsWhen Sun Goes Into TotalEclipse.Papeete, Tahiti. Preliminary observations were made ,here in Apriland May by Dr. 'Robert Trumpler, assistant director of the "Lick observatory on Mount Hamilton, California,in preparation for final astronomicalobservations in northern Australia toprove or disprove the. part of Einstein's theory of relativity which hasto do with the composition and characteristics of lightVarious astronomical expeditionswill gather on the northern coast ofAustralia September 21 to take theirobservations when the sun goes intototal eclipse that day. Doctor Trumplef's work here has been to photograph, on a large scale, the stars inthat part of the heavens where thesun will be on September 21. On theday of the eclipse, when the sun istotally obscured and the stars are vis-, lble, similar photographs will be takenon the same scale.Einstein's contention is that light isnot, as scientists Hitherto have held,the very rapid vibrations of the allpervading ether, but is made up ofelectrons and therefore Is a form ofmatter. If light is matter in anyform, it will be subject to the law ofgravitation, and it is to establish ordisprove this point that the observations are being made here and inAustralia.If Einstein's theory of light is wellfounded, according to Doctor Trumpler, the rays of light from a star Inthat (Juarter of the heavens passingby so large a mass as the sun willbe deflected by the force of the sun'sgravitation and the star in questionwill appear on the photographic plateat a place slightly removed from itstrue position in a direction away fromthe sun's disk.gow, Barren county, Kentucky, August 28, 29 and 30, 1922.The Commander of the Post atGlasgow, Ky., has secured a list,from every State in the UnitedStates and its possessions, of thosewho made the supreme sacrifice inthe World War and these names willbe placed inside a receptacle thatwill rest within the Memorial forall time.

With the OhioRiver fronting the northern boundary, the Mississippi on the westand the Big Sandy on the east, fewStales have better natural rivertransportation facilities than Kentucky, and if water traffic again isresumed on an extensive scale, theState would be the beneficiary in development and progress.Besides the boundary streamsother navigable waterways that runthrough the State are the Cumberland, Tennessee, Kentucky, Greenand Barren rivers. Upon the mostof these rivers the Federal Government has expended vast sums fortheir improvement in the interest ofsafe and uninterrupted navigation.The railroad strike and the predicted fuel schortage have directedmore attention to the possibilities ofriver transportation in Kentuckyand may hasten the time when itshrivers will teem with traffic incidentto the increased development of thenatural resources adjacent to thewaterways.With the speedy completion of theimprovement of the upper Cumberland under Federal auspices makingit navigable the year round as faras Burnside.

This situation is stressed by recent instances of blanket pardons issued by theGovernor to persons indicted fornon-payment, relieving them fromthe fines and costs imposed on condition that -they pay the dog tax.Pardons .were granted to approximately 500 persons in two countieswho tried to evade the dog tax andthis is regarded as reflecting a similar condition in practically everyother county where payment of thedog tax is looked upon in the natureof a voluntary offering. Only recently the published financial statement of an otherwise progressivecounty showed that of over 1,400dogs listed the tax had been paid ononly 107.Sometime ago over 1,600 indictments were returned in a singlecounty against delinquent dog taxowners, but the prosecutions weredismissed conditions on the paymentof the tax. In most counties theevasion of the dog taxes seems to beoverlooked, with, the result that onlya comparatively few of the dog owners show any inclination to settlewith the tax gatherer. -The dog owner may have no otherproperty but he has a vote and usually strong prejudices against theimpost. This in a political way mayaccount for the apparent disinclination of officials to resort to harshmeasures in forcing the collection ofwhat to many is an odious tax thatjustifies any means of "getting bywithout paying for the privilege ofkeeping "Tige" or "Old Ring."It remained for the yearlingsfrom Edward P.

Where are thetramps of yesterday? those aptlydubbed "knights of the road," who, inhalcyon days, were a common sightalong stretches of railroad right-of-ways,throughout th country. Shiftless, happy-go-lucky fellows they werereadily identified as "wanderingWillies," or members of the rovingmendicant fraternity, by their makeshift hats, unkempt and usually unwashed stubble beards, ill-fittingpatched trousers, nondescript coats,battered and tattered oversizedshoes, but, best of all, by the toolsof their "trade," a tin can and bandana handkerchief bundle which theycarried on the end of a short stickover the shoulders."Alas, poor Dusty Rhodes! I knewhim well, Horatio!" moaned DenverDutchy, a more or less retired veteranof the road, as he gently closed agrimy paper-bound edition of Emerson's Essays, which he had been reading for diversion while "beating it adivision," several weeks ago in a boxcar from Pueblo to Denver, Colo., overthe Colorado & Southern railroad. Histraveling companion and confidanteof the last three days, the reporter, amere novice, whose experience as ahobo consisted of a trifling 23,000miles covered at intervals during a period of four years, had asked for reminiscences of the old days when "boxcars were uox cars, ana men weremen," stirred by fond memories of thepast, was visibly affected.Bemoans Dear Old Days."Ah, will those dear days ever comeagain," he said almost sadly, shiftinghis weight as the train took a sharpcurve and rumbled into a long, darktunnel in the mountain side. Whendaylight again showed through theopen door Dutchy continued: "I thinknot. The old thoroughbred tramp haspassed, and the profession has peteredout. Only in the comics do you seethe tried and true tramp of yesterday."Tramp life Is a different life nowfrom what it was ten years ago. Andwhat makes it different is this: Theold-time tramp was on the road to doas little work as possible. When heneeded a stake to hold him over thewinter in the North there were plentyof Jobs in almost any town where hecould put in a few days' work andcome clear with enough money to livefor a few weeks. On the road -hecould always tackle a woodpile forsome 'kind lady' and get fed. Then,again,vthe jungles in every town werealways full of 'bos' who had plenty of'food they had bummed or had bought."Getting was easy in those days,"Dutchy went on. "But now! Thereare several million men on the roadtramps and bums all but they're noton the road because they want to be.Unemployment has put them there.Homeless, penniless and sometimesfriendless, they are beating it fromone town to another looking for work.Few Realize Hardships."People in the city with jobs don'tknow what a hobo is up against. Forthat matter few of them know what ahobo, in the true sense of the word, Is.They don't know that a real hobo is atraveling workman who does some ofthe hardest and poorest paid labor inthe United States. Who harvests thegreat grain crops of the Middle Westeach year? Hobos who drift in frpmall oer the country harvest it. Theyalso build the railroads, irrigationprojects and other construction jobs;cut the timber in the often-lousy logging camps, harvest the ice crops,work in mines and oil fields, and perform other work that, lasts for onlya short time and which only the drifters will tackle. A hobo will only bumwhen he is down and out and can'twork out a meal.Denver Dutchy said many otherthings. Subsequent investigation findsthat he is correct. The hobo Is aworker.Conditions on the road are pitiful.In parts of the country where the unemployment situation is not criticalthe life is not so hard, but in portionswhere it is, as in the entire Southwest,many hobos are leading a life that isreally worse than that of a hunted'animal. Railroad detectives and special agents chase them off trains andout of railroad yards and -the localpolice order them out, of town orarrest them for vagrancy.Drastic Laws Against Them.Many states, especially Texas7 havedrastic laws under which a man mustservo from one to eleven months onroad chain gangs If found guilty ofvagrancy. This punishment has made-many men bitter against the policeand citizens of many cities, and agitators and agents of several radical organizations are using this fact as anaigument toward enlisting hobos totheir various causes.

"Here's a land of plenty," they say.'"You, a human being must wanderthrough It starving, cold and tiredwith no place to lay your head. Analley cat or stray dog Is better offthan you are."Few people realize what segregation of these two or three million idlemen would mean. If there were notthese hobos swarming in hordes overthe railroads in every section of theUnion, the unemployed permanent residents of most of the cities and townswould have less chance of getting positions. The city man should be thankful that there are hobos in times whenwork is plentiful.Outlook Bad for 1922.The outlook for 1922 is unfavorable,especially for the winter. With somany mines and mills shut down, andwith the harvest season and construction jobs nearly over, it will notbe long before several hundred thousand hobos will again have to "hit theroad." Most old-timers predict a winter that will be worse than last year,one that brought much suffering.Jails will have to be thrown openand winter quarters provided as wellas bread lines formed.Hobos everywhere advise youngstersnot to try to beat thgjr way "anywhereat present, especially riding "blindbaggage" on passenger trains. Mailguards have shot and killed so manysuspects that it Is unsafe.Besides these hardships, there aremore severe ones that tax a man's endurance to the utmost. In some townsthroughout the nation the restaurantsand homes have been pestered somuch by hungry men seeking workthat several men have actuallystarved to death in them.

With theseimplements and a good stock of corncobs Mr. Hurt is able to turn outenough pipes to yield him a nice income, but not anything like able tosupply the ever-Increasing demandfor his pipes.This pipe was probably broughtinto national prominence by the famous Garrard county fox hunters;these gentlemen, the Walker brothers in particular, would use nothingbut the original "Sam Hurt Pipe,"and they always smoked one whenattending their national reunions,and almost every fox hunterthroughout the country is now Mr.Hurt's customer.Mr. Hurt's pipe sells for an average of 50 cents each, ranging fromthat price to as high as $5 each.These pipes may seem high, butevery pipe is hand-made, and willoutlast an ordinary briar, and isconsidered by smokers to be thesweetest, best smoking pipe obtainable.

The woman herself isadmissable, having lived for sometime at Chicago with her husbandbefore she returned to Europe.But the child cannot be admitteduntil another month's quota rollsaround.Two: The husband, alreadycrushed by the ruin of war in Belgium and struggling for a new startin America, is forced to bear the expense of the extra 6,000-mile tripto postpone the reunion with wifeand child on which his heart wasset.Three: Official Washington isaroused. Whatever their attitudeon the merits of the "quota" immigration laws may be, legislators arepreparing to demand that their enforcement be tempered by reasonand kindness and that more empliasis be laid on the spirit of the regulations than on .their letter.USEES OF ADDING MACHINESFor your convenience we are nowcarrying a stock of the best addingmachine rolls and can supply youwith one or a dozen at a time.

R. Campbell's Discoveries and Scientific Work WithBats Interests NaturalistsAll Over World.Los Angeles. Malaria, the diseasethat competes with tuberculosis andcancer in its heavy toll of life, hasfound its Nemesis since science protects and shelters the bat as the natural enemy of the malarial mosquito.The result of Dr. Charles A. R.Campbell's discoveries and scientificwork with bats and mosquitoes has interested naturalists all over the world.The first bat roost was built in SanAntonio for the purpose of riddingthe city of the pestilential malarialmosquito.For years Dr. Campbell experimented on bats to discover why they wereimmune from the disease that wroughtsuch havoc with human beings.Bats Abhor Jazz.It took a great many years for Dr.Campbell to be sure of the cause forthe difference In the susceptibility ofthe bat and that of other mammals.W. D. Hornaday writes in the Los Angeles Times. The great difference Inthe anatomy of the bat was found tobe In its relatively much larger spleen.It Is to this organ that Dr. Campbellattributes the ability of the bat tothrive on the mosquito and consumelarge numbers uf them without beingaffected.In his experiments with bats Dr.Campbell has come across several peculiar characteristics of the animal.For instance, bats abhor jazz. Aphonograph, a jazz record and a smallboy stationed on the top of a huntinglodge infested with bats so startledthe animals in the early morning hoursas they returned to roost that theyflew some two miles away, entered another lodge and never returned to theone in which they had been living fortwo years. The explanation of this isthat the ear of the bat is so delicatethat discordant or strident noises areto them the most irritating of all sensations. The remarkable value of bate as ahealth service was demonstrated inSan Antonio when the malaria infectedswamp region around Lake Mitchellwhere there was abundant grazing forcattle was experimented on. It hasbeen said that formerly it was impossible to build fences around thisland bordering the lake strong enoughto hold the cattle.The myriads of mosquitoes were notonly dangerous on account of theirgerm-carrying propensities, but theirbite was too painful even for beastshaving shoe-leather hides to endure.Dr. Campbell erected a bat roost ona rise In the neighborhood of the lakeand in a year the place was cleared ofmosquitoes and thousands of bats hadtaken their places. The grazing landis now covered with fine, healthy cattle and the farm land Is irrigated fromthe waters of the lake. Malaria is almost unknown among the people dwelling in that locality.It requires ten to fourteen days forthe malaria parasite to develop Inthe blood of the mosquito after theInsect has been Infected. With a myriad of bats flying about each night insearch of mosquitoes as food there Islittle chance of a "mosquito living tendays after it is old enough to flyabroad at nightMany Bat Roosts in San Antonio.After the success of this campaignagainst malaria bat roosts were established In the southwest outskirts ofSan Antonio. This was so successfulin ridding that portion of the city ofmosquitoes that the state erected another at the Southwestern Insaneasylum in San Antonio. Another waserected at the West Texas Militaryacademy in Alamo Heights. Summerhomes and farms are now taking upthe idea.Some of the bat roosts erectedunder Dr. Campbell's supervision areof mammoth size. Often they rise to aheight of thirty to fifty feet and arefifteen to twenty feet square. Thelargest of them accommodate from5,000,000 to 8,000,000 bats, it is estimated. In the early evening as theytake their departure for the mosquitohunting grounds they have the appearance of a dark cloud. Bats do notrange over a wide territory in theirforaging expeditions, it is asserted.Ordinarily they cannot be counted onto cover a radius of more than threemiles and often they confine theirflights to a mile or less fromroosting place.their"Wolves" Get $750,000,000.New York.

Animal fossils throwing a new light on the little-knownanimal life of America in the Plioceneage, have been added to the collectionof the Smithsonian Institution by thet field explorations conducted in Arizonain the past year, and described in areport by the institution. Among themost interesting specimens discovered,tne report said, are a new species ofmastodon, a large and small speciesof camel and two or three species ofhorses. J. W. Gidley, member of theSmithsonian staff, who conducted theexplorations, says the collection of fossils "represents practically a new faunaof the Pliocene age, containing aboutGO vertebrate species."Dealing with the astrophysical fieldwork of the institution, the report saidthe observations of the sun now beingmade at its station on Mount Montezuma, Chile, are being telegraphed daily to Buenos Aires and "employed regularly by the Argentine weather bureau for weather forecasting purposes.""While the Smithsonian institution,"the report said, "is not yet in a position to champion the use of statisticsof solar variation for weather forecasts, the great Interest which itsstudies of solar variability havraroused here and abroad seems clearlyto warrant the continued maintenanceof its two stations until a satisfactorybasis for a test of the solar variabilityas a weather forecasting element hasbeen laid."KERENSKY TO TELL SECRETSMemoirs Say He Sought to Save theCzar, but Was Frustrated byGreat Britain.London, England. Startling revelations respecting the dethronement anddeath of former Emperor Nicholas arepromised by Alexander Kerensky, onetime head of the Bussian republic,who has been quietly writing hismemoirs in a London flat. Kerensky'splan was to spirit the emperor out ofBussia to a neutral European countryor to the United States, but this, hecontends, was frustrated by GreatBritain.The book of the former Russian dictator will begin with the inception 'ofthe war and cover the final collapsef the empire. It will explain riotonly the cause of '.the JBmanov overthrow, but the failure of Kerensky'sown government.- The writer declares that If the allies had been willing to let Russia remain passive for a period they couldhave kept her as a yaluable ally. Thebook will , point out 'that the ententeinsisted on Russia's displaying energyon the front while in the throes of arevolution at home.His own overthrow Kerensky v attributes to simultaneous pressure fromthe two extreme parties, the royalistson the right and the Bolsheviki onthe left, in addition to the hostilityof the army.iBATTLE IN RUMANIAN TRAINSCrowds, Jamming Coaches, OftenCome to Blows; SeriousAccidents Frequent.Galatz, Rumania. Some railroadtrains in Rumania are so jammed thatconductors are powerless to collectfares.

The Germans and Austrians confiscated mostof the rolling stock. Passengers todayare forced to ride on the roofs, bumpers, running boards, and even on theundertrucks of the coaches.

H. Moore, it was decidedto fix the date for the examiningtrial Tuesday, when the commonwealth and the defense will have asecond conference. G. F. Wycoff,who, with Colonel J. S. Winn is defending Fox, stated that the trialwould be held shortly after the conference Tuesday. County Judge R.S. Scobee will probably be the examining officer.Fox was brought from his "bridalsuite" in the jail to the office ofColonel Winn, his attorneys, Saturday afternoon, where he and hislawyers conferred the greater partof the afternoon. Fox still sticks tohis story of not guilty.Officials denied published reportsto the effect that the body of LeonRenaker was disinterred Friday forthe purpose of determining whethera piece of lead pipe, reported to havebeen found, would fit into thewounds on Renaker's head.They asserted that no weapon hadbeen found, although it was presumed the blunt instrument used bythe slayer was a piece of lead pipe.A reward of $50 has been offeredfor the finding of the weapon.From the Greatest Story by Myrtle ReedSentiment, Humor, Action, Heart Appeal, Suspense, all are embodied in this gloriously beautiful production.

The demagogue that would try to "pull someof the stuff" that made for votes inother days would be laughed toscorn and regarded as a fit subjectto be borecl for the simples.A dozen years ago a candidate foroffice hardly would have dared toventure forth in quest of votes riding in an automobile. Now even thecandidate for constable rides in amachine on his electioneering trips.It used to be the vote getting wayfor a candidate when he started tocanvass a rural district, to go unshaven and shabbily dressed ostensibly to curry favor with the ruralvoters, but now such a makeupwould make him ridiculous with thesame voters.Then he kissed the babies and di-lated on how they took after their'mother and how she baked better! biscuits than anyone else and so on.'He knows better than to try thatnow. About the only thing that theold-time candidate did that some ofthe dear "peepul" might stand for atthis day, would be a nip of the"campaign" whisky he usually carried with him.The erstwhile candidate had ahabit of running on the demerits ofhis opponents instead of runningupon his own merits and usually hegot away with it. Now it is different and the least he has to sayabout the shortcomings of the otherfellow the better. This is due tomore of a spirit of fair play andsympathy for the underdog amongthose who now do the voting. Thereare tricks in all trades, but many otthe old ones no longer work in Kentucky politics.An optimist is a fellow who loan3a guy $10 when said guy alreadyowes him $20.oYale University has established acourse in citizenship for women voters of Connecticut.i oMaybe the reason the ocean isblue is because it has so manythings thrown up to it.rt-1fft,itSJIINSURANCELetusattend to Yours.What a dismal feeling it must be to - see your property destroyed by fire if it is not insured.TOBACCO INSURANCEGome in and let us insure you.
