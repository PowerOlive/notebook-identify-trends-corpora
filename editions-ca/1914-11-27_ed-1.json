DIES FROM INJURIES.
After lingering in great agony for
two weeks at the Good Samaritan
Hospital, in Lexington, Delia Cun
ningham, colored, who was badly burn
ed by her clothing catching fire from
an open grate, died as the result of
her injuries. She was hurried to the
hospital in an ambulance, where her i
injuries were given immediate atten
tion, but she was so horribly burned
that medical science could not save
her. The remains were brought here
and interred at her old home near
Little Rock.

The train is crowded. Alan, with

MLLE. ANNA PAVLOWA.
Dancing is considered the finest
form of exercise extant by Mile. Anna
Pavlowa, the great Russian artist who
will appear at the Een Ali, Theatre,
J Lexington, matinee and night, on Wed
nesday, uecemoer v. raviowa says
dancing combines pleasure and work
in such a way that the hardships are
forgotten.
"Dancing is exceiient for women
and men no matter what age," said
Mile. Pavlowa recently in an inter
view. "When you dance you combine
amusement and exercise. In a word,
you exercise to rythmic motion and
obviate all of the 'tired feeling' which
most people complain of when they
exercise."

MULES FROM KENTUCKY.
Newton Rankin, a Nicholas county
stockman, stated Wednesday that he
had just completed the shipment of
1,284 mules sucklings, yearlings and
two-year-old to Pennsylvania and
Maryland, for which he paid the far
mers of Kentucky more than $80,000.
"Business is on the mend in the
East, and the country in a very short
time will enter into an era of unpre
cedented prosperity," he said. "The
situation in the South, however, is
distressing. The cotton farmers are
selling their mules for export to
Europe for war purposes at prices
representing less tlntn-half their value
in order to get money to tide them
over."
