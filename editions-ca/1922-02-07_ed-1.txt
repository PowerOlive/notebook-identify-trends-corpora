Professor Clark especially condemned unchaperoned dancing inhotels and he does not look with favor on tea dances in private homes.THE GREATEST FACTS AND THEGREATEST PROBLEMSINGROWN TOE NAIL- TURNS OUT ITSELFA noted authority says that a fewdrops of "Outgrow" upon the skinr surrounding the ingrowing nail reduces Inflammation and pain and sotoughens the tender, sensitive skinunderneath the toe nail, that it cannot penetrate the flesh, and the nailturns naturally outward almost overnight."Outgrow" is a harmless, antiseptic manufactured for chiropodists.However, anyone can buy from thedrug stor a tiny bottle- containingdirection . (T-tf)A minister friend the other daystated an old truth in a new way.He said: "The greatest fact thatwe know anything about is God.The next greatest fact is Man. Godand Man are facts; they cannot bedenied. And the relation of Godto Man is the greatest problem thatfaces the human race to-day."This is a very simple creed and yeta very big one. It is so simple thatall of us Jews and Gentiles, Catholics and Protestants alike mayunite upon it. And it is so big thatit will require the best efforts of anyof us to comprehend."We have different viewpoints; wedo not all see things alike. Thethings which may seem important toanother to one may seem trival toanother. But all of us realize certain fundamentals facts and knowcertain fundamental truths.The man who believes in Godand the man who says he does notbelieve in God tells an untruthmust settle his account with his Godin his own way. No one else cansettle it for him.And the man who is honestly trying to square that account willhave a great-deal of love and sympathy for other men who are tryingto do the "same thing, even if theirmethods differ somewhat from Miisown.GET READY FORSPRINGFoy's Paints and VarnishesPrices at Old Time Levels.GET FIGURES ON PAINTINGNOW!
