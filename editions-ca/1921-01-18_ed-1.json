WORK OF THE RED CROSS IN
KENTUCKY
The Red Cross Public Health
Nurse is helping to teach American
mothers how to safeguard their
children's health; how to care for
babies; how to prepare the most nu
tritious meals; how to promote sani
tary conditions in the homes and
how to combat sickness and disease.
One of the most important phases
of its peace program is the co-operation
the American Red Cross is giv
ing the United States Public Health
Service, the Kentucky State Board of
Health and the Mountain Fund (for
needy eye sufferers) in the fight to
stamp out trachoma in Kentucky.
Trachoma is gradually and surely
yielding to treatment in Kentucky,
according to Dr. .A. T. McCormick.
Secretary of the Board of Health of
this State. Physicians and occu
lists of the State and trachomi hos
pitals and clinics maintained by the
United States Public Health Service
are carrying on a work that will
comprise one of the brightest pages
in American medical annals.
According to figures given out by
Dr. McCormick, 3 0,713 cases of
trachoma from all sections of Ken
tucky were treated at hospitals and
clinics from tne time of their estab
lishment in 191 i until June 30,
1920. Of this number 9,200 were
discharged as cured, 1,000 as im
proved and free from infection and
513 untracked or the result un
known. United States Public Health hospi
tals in Kentucky are located at
Greenville, Pikeville and Jackson.
They are under the direction of Dr.
John McMullen, of the United States
Public Health Service.
Dr. McCormick gives to Dr. J. A.
Stuckey, president of the Kentucky
State Medical Association, and Miss
Linda Neville, a pioneer in the fight
against trachoma, who is now a
member of the field staff of Lake Di
vision. American Red Cross, credit
for much of the work of starting
the campaign against the disease in
1912.

munities in the mountains of Ken
tucky is a picture that is most fa

County Health Boards is urged upon
Fiscal Courts by the State Boara of
Health, according to Dr. J. N. Mc
Cormick, Secretary of the Bureau.
Appointment of women to the board, j
Dr. McCormack said, is due them
because of their untiring efforts ,v.
health work, especially in ihe last
decade and also in "view of their now
having equal suffrage rights.
At present there are four membeis
on each county health board, three
physicians being appointed toy the
State Board, while ihe fourth gener
ally is' the county judge, or another
county official. The FiscjI Courfr,
under the law would appoint the
fifth member, who the State health
organization hopes will be a woman.
Dr. McConmack explained that .the
woman as well as the men members
of each board, should be well-known
in -the county and have the confi
dence of the people in their respec
tive sections.
