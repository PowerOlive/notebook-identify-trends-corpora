CAMPBELL CANTRlLL,of Scott county.Taft Against Farmers.As Governor Wilson says, the farmerjfeeds the country, while Congresshas been feeding the trusts. He isforced to sell in the cheapest marketand buy in the greatest monopolymarket in the world Wnen Mr. Taftvetoed the bills passed by Congress torelieve the farmer of some ot his burden, he struck a blow at the foundation of wealth at the country andshowed how firmly he is held in thegrasp of the interests. Thejnatchlessleader on the flour of the House, Hon.Oscar Underwood, says that had thebills passed, been permitted to becomelaws without the interference of thePresident, the people of this countrywould have saved $650,000,000. TheHouse passed some of the bills overMr. Taft's veto but the senate waslike Taft. bound to his idols. Mr.Taft admitted that his party had notkept faith with the people in some ofthe schedules of the tariff, but whengiven the opportunity to correct themhe failed to do so, giving the flimsiestof pretexts. Such a course could onlyresult in thafailure of his administration. The people have lost confidencein him and he will.soon into meritedretirement. A glorious day is dawning for Democracy and next March,please God, a man who believes thatplatforms are to stand on, and not used solely to get in on, will use everyendeavor to restore to thejpeople theircontrol of the government.Wilson a Leader.Mr. Taft "may have more girth thanGovernor Wilson, but the Democraticcandidate has the most backbone. Unlike Mr. Taft he will do what hethinks right regardless cf consequences. Mr. Taft's record on the tariffquestion shows that party considerations count more with fchim than rightand justice. Governor Wilson has lessegotism but betterjjudgment than Colonel Roosevelt. In fact, he is safe,sane, conservative and reliable andthe.best intellectually equipped candidate for the presidency in fifty years.Not all of us got our choice when hewas'nominated at Baltimore, but all ofj us agree now that the nomination ofWilson was little less than inspiration."S If you "have young children youhave perhaps noticed that disorders ofthe stomach are their most commonailment.

For sale by all dealers.Winchester News Out for Wilson.The Winchester Daily News has announced its allegiance to the Democratic party, and the policy of thepaper has been changed from Independent to Democratic. The changeof the policy is the result of the recentpurchase of the interest of Mr. LucienBeckner by Mr. Carl C. . Robbing, whohas always been a staunch supporterOf the Democratic party. Mr. Robbins, who is formerly of this county isa son of Mrs. D. L. Robbins, of LittleRock.Here is a woman who sneaks fromnersonal knowledge and long experience, viz., Mrs. P. H. Brogan, .of Wilson, Pa., who says, "I know from experience that Chamberlain's CoughRemedy is far superior to any other.For croup there is nothing that excelsit." For sale by all qpalers.iHilles' Hallucination.Chairman Hilles of the'National Republican Committee has issued an address in whic hhe declares that it is apersonality and not a principle whichis opposing Mr. Taft in his own partyin this campaign, ana it is doomedtounmistakable censure. EThe race, heasserts, is between the President andMr. Wilson, and every vote cast forRoosevelt is "a vote for Wilson, whichmeans danger. A vote forTaft is avote for safety. " Then he rings inthe old adage "It is better to be safethan sorry." all of which is apparently intended for the marines. It ishardly to be expected that the oldsailors will accept a feed of such muddy rations. They know that the prosperity which the country is enjoying isbecause the earth and the mines havevied in producing unriaraielled wealthand that it is in sDite of the Republican orinciple of a high protective tariff which would have plunged the country into most irrevocable disaster butfor the national conditions vouchsafedby a kind providence. The prosperityof which the document prates couldnot come Irom taxing the people todeath on food and othe1 necessities andthe man who really believes that theycan should be confined in the institution for the simples.The high protective tariff for whichMr. Taft and Mr. Roosevelt stand hasgot to go. People are in earnest onthat question and know that in orderto secure their demands they mustvote for Wilson and the Democraticnominees for Congress. Let everyDemocrat do so and send the calamityhowlers to grass.Americans Drinking MoreLiquor.The American people are drinkingmore whisky and beer and smokingmore cigars and cigarettes than everbefore in history according to the report of Koyal W. Cabell, Commissioner of Internal Revenue at Washington.From Julymore than1 to October 1, 1912,3,800,000.000 cigarettesan increase of one bil-were smoked.lion over the correspondingthe previous year, whichperiod ofbroke allrecords.The nation consumed 33,150.000 gallons of whisky during July, Augustand September, an increase of450,000gallons aB compared with that quarterof 1911, while nearly 1,950.000,000cigars were smoked during that time.The cigar consumption promises to establish a new record. S",A total of 19,800,000 barrels of beerwere consumed during the threemonths, which was 320,000 barrelsmore than in the same period of 1911.Ihis somewhat surprised revenueomcials, as beer rdinking fell out considerably during the fiscal year endingJune 30 last. That decrease was partly accounted for by Commissioner Cabell by the increased popularity of buttermilk as a summer drink.The growing consumption of thesearticles has greatly augmented thegovernment's revenue. The internalrevenue receipts for October, alreadymore than $2,000,000 greater than October 1911, will eclipse all records forany October in the judgment of Mr.Cabell.Puts End to Bad Habit.Things'never look bright to one witnthe blues.

Have you that asset or doyou like confidence in your own abilityto win. Some candidates who start ina race of this kind get "cold feet"before they ask a single perron for asubscription and it surely is no wonderthat they cannot win for they lack selfconfidence. Be aggressive in yourcampaign. The stronger you go afterthe votes, the more people will admireyou and support you, tor everyone likesto see an energetic person.SYSTEMATIZE YOUR WORKPlan your campaign in a systematicway. Before you start, rnake out alist of ueople who you are going togee, whom you are going to telephoneand to whom you are xoing to send theprinted letters. Then when you securethe subscription, cross crt thc'r nameor if they tell you that they will helDyou later on, find out as near as possible the exact date they will help you,put that down opposite their names,and then call or write them later andremind them of their promise. Whenyou get a subscription from some oneak that person if they cannot introduce you or refer you to some one elsewho might be willing to take the paper and give you the votes. Don't bediscouraged if any person does turnyou down. That same person maychange his mind and give you a subscription later on in the contest whenit gets a little warmer. Even if he,does not remember there'are thousandsof other persons in this section of thestate from whom you may get a subscription.. Possibly he is just tryingto test you out'and see if you have selfconfidence to make a winning candidate or whether you are just makinga half hearted race. He, like mosteveryone else, may want his votes togo to some candidate who will makean active race and be a winner at thefinish. You can't exnect a person tohelp you unless you show them ycu really want to win.LIST OP OLD SUBSCRIBERS.Every candidate may have a list ofthe old subscribers who are in arrears,if they will call at the office or writeor telephone the campaign manager.This list gives the name and addressof the subscriber and the date towhich he is now paid.Under Uncle Sam's new ruling,newspapers must make their subscribers pay up their subscriptions or otherwise the newspaper will lose the second class mail privilege. The News,as well as the other papers in theUnited States, must obey this rulingand it has issued a warning to itssubscribers telling them to pay uptheir subscriptions. After the contestis over, all subscribers who are in arrears will be dropped from the list.Contestants are authorized to telltheir friends of this ruling and askthem to help us live up to Uncle Sam'sorders by paying up their subscriptions. GET THE PRINTED LETTERS.The campaign manager has printedletters on hand which he will give thecandidates to send out to their friendswnom they cannot reach otherwise.You may have as many of these letters as you wish upon request and youwill find them of great assistance insecuring votes and subscriptions. Agreat many candidates work nearlytheir whole campaign through theseprinted letters. Send out two or threehundred of them to friends, relativesand acquaintances in this and othercounties around and also to Iriends inother states as well. Not only to people you know but to everyone whomyou can think of. Get a list of peoplefrom the telephone book or from anyother paper or mailing list that you' can get hold of. It is a fact that thecampaign manager has never had acontestant in any contest who sent outtwo or thiee hundred of these letterswho did not win a prize. Just thinkthis over; its a point you should takeadvantage of. While he tells everycandidate to send out a great many ofthese letters, there is only about onein fifteen who will send out more'thanthree or four. They do not seem torealize what a great help they will beto them.ASK THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER.If there is anything about the contest that you do not understand or ifyou wish assistance in planning andmanaging your campaign, don't beafraid to ask the campaign managerfor he will gladly assist you in everyway he possibly can. That's what heis here for. If you want him to gowith you to call on your tnends andsolicit their subscriptions or if youwish him to help you send out theprinted letters, don't hesitate to askhim. He is here in the interest of thecontest and for the benefit of the contestants and a3 he has had severalyears' experience in this work, he isin position to know how to direct yourefforts so that they will brin about thebest possible results. Again we saydon't hesitate to ask him if he can beof service to you in any way.Either Miss Warren, the campaignsteDocrrapher, or Mr. Potts, the campaign manager, may be found at theNews office opposite the court house,each day and evening up to 8 p. m.and will be glad to meet the contestants and their friends. Or you canreach them by either telephone at thi3office.Until further notice no contestantwill be allowed to poll more than asufficient number of votes to placetheir standing 10,000 votes in advanceof the leader of the preceding issue.For intsance, if A. had 10,975 votes intoday's issue, you would be allowedenough to place your standing 20.965votes in the next issue. As many subscriptions as you wish may be turnedin and vote ballots will be issued andreturned to you.DOTX'S STUDIO, OFFICIAL PHOTOGRAPHERS.

Col.L. G. Archer, deputy under Mr. Winsett and who has been in Paris thepast few weeks, arranged the affair,which was happily carried out, andwhich wil eventually prove a big boostto the lodge that will begin its existence next Wednesday night.The Winchester lodge, instituted al:ttle more than a week ago, imbuedwith true Moose enthusiasm, sent adelegation of sixty-five from the sister city, included in the number Deingthe members of the Moose band of sixteen pieces. The visitors demonstrated their interest in the welfare of theprospective Moose lodge in this city,and took an active part in the program of the evening. At the conclusion of the session a rising vote ofthanks was extended the visitors.Col. Archer opened the meeting bycomplimenting th Winchester delegation on their fine appearance and theirenthusiasm, and introduced Dr. A. H.Keller, who presided. After statingthe purpose of the meeting Dr. Keller introduced Mr. Winsett, who spukeat length on the past, present and future of the Moose Order, which extends throughout the world, and theprogress of the cities which boasted oforganizations, and the prominent partthe members ot the order had playedin the development of their respectivetowns, and the advantages it wouldafford Paris in a commercial sense.Mr. Winsett, who is a life memberof the Chamber of Commerce of Oklahoma City, spoke enthusiastically ofCharles b Cclcord, an ex-Bourbonite,and his son, Ray Colcord, who wereforemost in the business affairs of thatcity. He said that with the same progressive spirit that existed in this former resident of Bouibon county instilled in this community through the medium of a Moose Order, nothing couldhinder the progress of Paris and makeher the city she should oe, rankingamong the most progressive in theState.Short talks upon the subect of theMoose lodge were made bv Judge Harmon Stitt and Attorney P. A. Thompson, and Dr. Keller closed the sessionwith an address along the same lines,after which the visitors, members ofthe local lodge and a number of invited guests repaired to the dining roomot the Fordham Hotel, where a sumptuous lepast was enjoyed.The local lodge of Moose will be instituted next Wednesday night by Col.Archer, and it is the hope of thosemost interested in the organization tohave one hundred members to assumethe obligation on the night of its institution.
