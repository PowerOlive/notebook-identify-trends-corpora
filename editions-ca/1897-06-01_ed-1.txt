making1 the tax on all distilled spirits 70 cents a gallon It provides that the tax shall he levied onspirits in bond at the time the lawgoes into effect or may be then oithereafter produced in the UnitedStatesSenator Jones of jNevada chairmanof the committee on contingent expenses of the senate has not yet calleda meeting of his committee for thepurpose of considering the Tillmanresolution making sensational chargesin relation to thp sugar schedule ofthe tariff bill It is believed to beprobable that the resolution willbe reported back to the senateand that the senate will orderan investigation There may besome delay on the part of the committee in acting on the resolution but thepresumption is that if a report is notsoon forthcoming a motion will bemade to discharge the committee andbring the resolution before the senateThat would mean a direct vote and itis believed probable that on such aproposition the senate would vote toconsider the resolution and order theinvestigation An effort to discourage an inquiry is being madeand it is quite apparent that manysenators do not want any but if thereis an insistance upon an investigationit scarcely can be avoided Thedeclaration of Senator Aldrich that themembers or the sub committee on finance courted the fullest investigationis regarded by some senators as a challenge which must be met and whichcan be met only with an investigationThe senate Friday confirmed the following nominations James EdmundBoyd North Carolina assistant attorney ganeral Francois S Jones ofLouisiana to be secretary of thelegation

Hawaiian Question Will ProbablyCome to the Front in an AmendmentProviding Continuance of Reciprocity Treaty With the IslandsWashington May 31 The impression was general about the senate atthe close of the first weeks discussionof the tariff bill Saturday that thesugar schedule would be reached towards the close of the present weekThe progress so far made while itwas much less marked Saturday thanon previous days is generally regarded as little less than phenomenal asmodern tariff debates go SenatorVest declaresi that the present bill isas far advanced now as was the Wilsonbill after five weeks discussion whileSenator Qones of Arkansas assertsthat as much of the bill was passedover the first day of consideration aswas disposed of in the Wilson bill inthree weeks The republicans generally concede that good progress hasbeen made but they are not inclinedto felicitate themselves too much untilthey see what policy is to be pursuedwhen questions of more general interest are reached than have yet beenbroachedThe sugar schedule in all probability will excite more prolonged and animated debate than any other in thebill The democrats are making veryextensive preparation for the discussion of this schedule and several setspeeches will be made upon itThe indications are that various other questions of generalinterest will be considered in connection with the sugar duty SenatorPettigrew is contemplating presentinghis amendment against trusts in thisconnection and it is certain that theHawaiian question will come to thefront in an amendment providing foithe continuance of the reciprocity treaty with the Hawaiianislands With reference to the Hawaiian treaty there is no longermuch Toom for doubt that provisionwill be made to continue the presenttreaty in effect It is probable thatthis will be done by a direct declaration that nothing in the bill shall beconstrued as abrogating the treatyThe republican members of the committee are contemplating this changeIf Senator Pettigrew insists upon offering the trust amendment to thisschedule he will precipitate one of themost interesting debates of the sessionThe republicans are not yet decidedwhether they will caucus on the sugarschedule but there is more or less talkto this effect-There are two schedules to be considered after the conclusion of thatunder present discussion before thesugar schedule can be reached Theseare the metal and wood schedulesThe metal schedule is not especiallyobjectionable to the democrats containing as it does many of the Wilsonlaw rates but it is more or less complicated and will necessarily consumetime The wood schedule will developno little antagonism onaccount of theduty on lumber There will be a quitedetermined effort to restore white pinelumber to the free listThe Tillman resolution for a sugarinvestigation probably will be reported to the senate Tuesday It will bepassed without difficulty when takenup according to the present outlookbut Senator

CAPTAIN CHARLES KINGLCopyright 1894 by J B Lippincott CoYI ContinuedAgain the sound of the cheap anddespised tin Lambert recalled it as anecessary concomitant of the streetboy and straw rides about the Christmas holidays and its summons hethought was never to prayer it calledfor many a lively maledictionSend Sergt Watts if you think itadvisable said he briefly Im goingup on the road a momentAgain the blast of the born shortstaccato imperaitiveand then an- impatient querulous voice at the northend of the porch a voice calling YouElinor you wirbbless black gadaboutwh ah youAnd as Lambert scrambled up thesteep path and reached the road another voice low tremulous eager closeat hand whispered Oh I thoughtyoudnever come Hyuh quick Leavethe money shuah and the pailtmajwow nightAnd then with a rustle of femininegarments bending law a slender girlish form shot across the beam of lamplight falling from an east windowAnother form also feminine scurriedaway from the hedgerow and something came rolling out into the roadway clinking against the stones Therewas sound of voluble reprimand andflustered explanation at the north endof the building a quick kitten like patter of little feet up the rickety old stepsin front and in an instant the girlishform seemed perched on the windowsill There a second or two it hoveredmotionless until a door slammedaround at the north side of the houseThen in popped the slender figure outwent the light and but for the sigh andcomplaint of the night wind in the rustling branches of the old trees about tiheveranda all was silence at Walton hallvnIt was after ten when Capt Close returned and barely 11 when he againset forth This time a sergeant andten picked men went with him nobodybut Close knew whither I may begone two days lieutenant said he inthe laborious use of the title whiehamong regulars to the manor borahad long been replaced by Mr andhad not Lambert asked for instructionsnone probably would have been givenOf his adventures during the day hesaid not a word He brought back themule and that was enough The firstthing Lamberi and Burns knew of hisreturn was the sound of his voice atthe wagon informing the guard thathe wanted coffee and something toeat Then paying only vague attention to Lamberts congratulations onbis safe return he told Burns to get adetachment ready at once then disappeared within the dark interior ofhis tent leaving Lambert standing insome embarrassment and chagrin outside Looking to see if bis strong boxis all safe whispered the first sergeant as he came up Its under theboards under bis cot and he neverlets anybody come in not even the mar-shalIt was full five minutes before thecaptain reappeared He struck no lightmeantime but could be heard fumblinguround in the darkness When he cameforth he had some papers in his handsWell go to your tent sergeant hesaid Your desk is handier Howveyou got along lieutenantTwo men are out sir Kiggs andifurphyDam blackguards both of emspecially Biggs almost the oldest soldier in the company too said Closewrathf ully seating himself at the deskand beginning to arrange the papersfor signatureI had been told I should find somesplendid old oaks among the rank andfile hazarded Lambert after a pauseand thinking his commander shouldgive some directions in the caseOld oaks Old soaks most likewas the disdainful answer specially Biggs He come from the cavalryWhy Ive had them two fellows tiedup by the thumbs three times sincelast March and it haint hurt em nomoren if they were cast iron Hetterkeep a guard over the mules whileIm away sergeant or rather lieutenant you see I aint nse to bavinanybody but the sergeant Oh Nowbout them mileage papers o yournYou said not to send em Why notYouve made out a charge of somesixty five dollars for

Ill warrant Well 3foupaid him out of your pocket everytime you changed cars or boatThat may be sir but I cant signany such claim as sixty dollars fortransportation of servant when I paidno such sumThen howre you to get your moneyback the dimes and dollars youvegiven to porters and waiters on theway Every officer I know wouldsignthat certificate without question andevery quartermaster would pay itCapt Warren came with you to headquarters at least What dyou bet hehasnt drawn servants transportationYou think it over lieutenant Theresno sense in you robbin yourself thisway Write down to barracks f youlike and see what they say at headquarters Theyll tell you just whatI doIll sign the accounts without thatand get the mileage for myself saidLambert I need the money Thenif its allowable and proper I can collect for servant latervNot much you cant Theres whereyou show your ignorance Then thegovernment would make you fight tenyears for it even if youd brought aservant with you The way is to getit first and let them stop it if its wrongBut here I cant fool away time argudn simple thing like that Ive gotto be miles away before midnight andno matter who comes and inquiresyou dont know where weve gone Nowyou wont need any commissary fundsor anything while Im away Justpay cash and take receipts if you buyvegetables for the companyYou forget sir thatmy moneysgoneSure you hadnt anything but whatwas in that pocketbook Then sergeant you do it and keep accountBut excuse me captain said Lambert flushing I myself will needmoney I must find some place toboard Keep those mileage accountsas security if you like but let me havetwenty dollarsBut you haint signed them theyreno goodIll settle that said Lambert sharply and taking a pen he drew a linethrough the item for transportation forservant and altered the figures of thetotal accordingly then still standingand bending over the desk slashed hissignature with a sputtering pen uponthe paper Close carefully scrutinizedthe sheet compared it with its duplicate when that too was similarly finished and stowed both away in a longenvelope Sure youve got to havetwenty he asked as a soldier stuckhis head inside the tent door retiredprecipitately at sight of the junior lieutenant and then from without announced that the captain was servedWell I guess I can get it for youbefore I go Slowly he finished slowlysigned after close study of their contents the papers placed before himthen slowly left the tent without another word Not until he had buckledon his pistol belt he carried no swordand was about to start with his silentand yawning squad did he seem to wakefrom his fit of abstraction and thenonly when Lambert appealed to himfor ordersOh yes Well just have an eye onthem mules will you lieutenantEverything else almost is under lockand key The quartermaster sergeantis pretty solidBut in case of disturbance or demands for more detachments or menwanting to go awayThere wont be nuthin now fur aweek Dos you like about givin themen a little liber tjr Theyve had agood deal Everything around here willbe quiet enough and youll hear whatIm after well when Ive got itThat night though worn and wearyand downhearted Lambert could hardly sleep At 11 the little detachmenthad trudged away into the blacknessof the night and the tramp of theirinarch was swallowed up in the rustleof the crisp brown foliage and the creakof overhanging branches The men remaining in camp crawled back to theirblankets the cook fire smoldered awayonly occasionally whirling forth a reluctant flight of sparks in response tosome vigorous puff of the restless windthe sentry yawned and dawdled aboutthe wagon and the store tent even themules seemed so sympathetic with theirrecovered associate that no whisper ofa bray came from their pen on the bankof the stream Lambert had receivedthe assurance of his sergeant that themissing men would surely turn up before breakfast on the morrow and hadgiven permission to that harassed andevidently disgusted official to go to bedThen after a turn around his sleepingcamp the young fellow went to hislonely roost to think things overIn the first place as he lighted hiscandle there was the tin pail which hadrolled out from the Walton hedge rowand which on inspection he had foundto contain about two pounds of freshbutter very neatly packed in lettuceleaves That proved that the Waltonsstill had something of their old gardenleft Lettuce could surely be raisedonly under glass at this inclement season He had hitherto had no time fcrclose inspection of the contents Nowas he turned over the leaves he found alittle slip of paper on which in a girlishand somewhat scratchy hand werepenned the words Please send smallcurrency Its hard to get change Youcan have buttermilk to morrow night ifyoull bring a pitcher Due 510 Youmust payit this time I must have itNow who on earth is this youngladys customer thought LambertSurely not Close He never spends acent on butter Nobody else lives nearerthan Parmelees to the north or townto the south Can it be that some of thesergeants have been buying suppliesfrom this quarter and running up a butter bill Burns had spoken of troublebetween the captain and the old ladyand of all hands beinir forbidden toV-tiusrrV fv r-AWiruenter the Walton grounds on any pretext whatever That of course did notprohibit the men from buying what theWalton servants offered for sale outsidethe fence and if they were so straitenedin circumstances they might be glad tofind a market for their sujplus produceeven among the Yankee invaders provided Mme Walton were kept in ignorance of the traffic She was uncompromising No intercourse with norecognition of the barbarians was herrule to kith and kin and the few negroeswho still hung about the crumbling oldplace repeated her words with the fearblorn of long continued discipline underher roof and rod in the days of their enforced and unquestioning servitudeThese and other items of informationas to his surroundings the young lieutenant had obtained from Sergt Burnsin the course of their evening watch together He had no other means ofstudying the situation and was but oneof many new and comparatively inexperienced officers thrown upon theirown resources at isolated posts amongthe states lately in rebellion Not yet24 hours on duty with his company hehad been ordered to- proceed with onarmed force to the succor of officers ofiaw supposably besieged by a rebelliousmob and now at midnight in the heartof a strange country and far from theheart ofits people he was commandingofficer of his company and camp without definite instructions of any kindand only his native common sense toguide himLambert has since told two womenhis wife and his mother how histhoughts wandered back to the peaceful old homestead in the far northlandand to the teachings of his boyhooddays He made a sturdy fight againstthe feelingof loneliness that oppressedhim He wished the wind did not blowso sulkily in such spiteful viciouspuffs It seemed as though nature hadcombined with old Lady Walton to givehim ungracious welcome to this particularly shady side of the sunny southThe wind itself was whispering sarcastic and withering remarks to him likethose the sergeant repeated as comingfrom Madam Walton to the defenselesscaptain and even Burns sense of subordination could not down his impulseto chuckle over some of them Whatwould Lambert do or say if the primand starchy dame were to call uponhim as she occasionally had on his superior driving him at last to the refugeof the nethermost depths of his tentwhence as Burns declared the captain couldnt be induced to come outtill the old lady was back inside herown doorThe last time he tied up Biggsa punishment much resorted to in thewlmrr mWas torn from the groundtrough war days and those that closelyfollowed them especially by those officers who were themselves graduatedfrom the ranks of the volunteers itwas for trespass on the Walton placeThe fellow had climbed the fence andwas pilfering among the old fruit treeswhen caught by Madam Walton Thatwas bad enough but he had been impudent to her which was worse Themen themselves would probably haveducked him in the stream the oldself respecting soldiers that is had thecaptain not ordered his summary punishment Lambert was wonderingwhat steps he should take in the interests of discipline when hp finally blewout his candle determined if a possiblething to get to sleep It was just aquarter past 12 when he wound hiswatch and stowed it under his rudepillow His revolver the days purchase lay with some matches close athand He had even placed his swordand belt at the foot of his cot Thelast thing he thought of before closinghis eyes was that he would have to geta lantern on the morrow even if hebought it of Cohen but it was also thelast thing he thought of when the morrow cameWas it the wind again whisperingugly things or the ghost of Lady Walton with her acidulated tongue thatroused him he knew1 not how manyminutes or hours later 1Something was whispering surely Thewind had been doinga good deal of thatsort of thing all the night long amongthe leaves a good deal of snarling andgrowling at times and there was muttered snarling going on around himnow That might be the wind but thewind would not trip up over a tentrope and say such blasphemous thingsabout it even if it did nearly pull theflimsy structure down In an instantLambert was wide awakeWhos there he challengedsternlyNo answer not in words at leasthut there was sound as of stealthy yethurried movement more straining atthe ropes on the side nearest the captains tent and heavy startled breathingWhos there he repeated reachingfor the revolver Answer or 1 fire-heavy fall followed by instantble and a rush of footfalls around therear of camp Lambert was out of bedand into his boots in half a minutebut in his haste he upset the chair onwhich lay the matches and the boxwent rolling to the floor Pistol inhand he darted out in the night andfound it black as Erebus Quickly heran to the first sergeants tent butBurns was hard to waken after thelong days work Once roused however he was soon out lantern imhandwhile Lambert hastily dressed andthen together they scouted camp Aglance at their tent showed that Biggsand Murphy were still absent A peepat the watch showed that it was almosttwo oclock a search around Lambertstent revealed nothing beyond the facthat the corner peg to which the tentfly was guyed was torn from theground and the soft sandy soil showedtthat heavy boot heels had made theirimprint Then Burns still lanternbearing went crouching low aroundthe back of Closes tent while Lambertwith straining ears stood stock still aninstant in front then of a sudden

terrors for himWith a disposition as kindly and manners as gentle as those of PlorencNightingale or Clara Barton he can become a roaring lion if anyone attemptto interfere withjrim in the perfonmance

therainy season begins and the summeiheat comes yellow fever will break ouiagain and Dr Burgess stands betweenthose epidemics and the people of theUnited StatesThe harbor of Havana is a cesspoolwhich for years has received the drainage of the city and is virtually awith no means of being scoured bytides or fresh water streams Thedocks of the cityside of the bay are no-torious as foci of infection

boss lineman turned to his assistant with a frownWhat did you tell himfonAt the same moment he dropped apparently by accident the spool of finewire which he was about to use Helield the free end of the wire which wasthus unwound as the spool fell to thegrouiidSay kid throw me up that spooland Ill tell you he answered to theb03s second inquiryInstantly the lad sprang to obey andpicking u the spool of wire he steppedback to throw it looking where hewaswalking instead of at the man upon thewagon towerWith a malicious wink at his companion the lineman brought the wirein his hand in contact with the trolley-wire upon which he was workingThe boy on the ground gave a crywhich was a half groan half screamJijs arms jerked violently back his bodytwisted his teeth snapped together andhis black eyes seemed ready to jumpIrom his headIt was only for an instant that thelineman held the fine wire in contactwith the live one but for 1 hat instantit seemed to the boy as if a thousandneedles were running through all partsof his bodyAs soon as he could release his holdupon the spool he threw it under thewagon and not wishing to expose thetears which he could not Iceep from hiseyes he started down the street rubbing his wrist where it felt as if theshock had been the most severeThe lineman who considered hiscruel trick a great joke was convulsedwith laughterIll bet he knows how many

entirely true Jaont think it has ever been in printYou know that every dollar that GenGrant had was swept away by the failure and he was left almost pennilessAccording to his son he had only about80 in his pocket when he learned thathe was a bankruptMillionaires brokers railroad magnates and money makers of every kindrushed to him with offers of assistance Some of them wanted him to goin business with them and pictured aglorious future for him He receivedthem all courteously but declined everyoffer His experience with the rascally Ward opened his eyes for the firsttime to the dangers of lending hispowerful name for the promotion oibusiness enterprises and he regardedall propositions with grave suspicionTelegrams and letters proffering aidpoured in on him from every part oithe country for days after the collapseTo all these he replied in tke samespirit He thanked the authorsSomebody go for a doctor was allteously for their kind offers but firmly declined to accept assistance of anysort He had made up his mind to coinhis autobiography into cash for the safety of his family He knew he had notlong to live and was ready to die as soonas his book was finishedAbout a week after the failure hereceived a letter from a farmer up theHudson river written in a poor handbut containing words and sentimentsthat touched the old heros heart deeply The farmer set forth in his crudeway the gratitude he felt for Grant andhow the writer though only a privatesoldier had suffered theJiardships anddangers of war to help the generasave the union for the benefit of generations yet unborn Then the farmer told Grant that since the war hehad been able to buy a farm and layaside 1000 He did not know anyoneto whom he would rather loan half hissavings than- to the man he had neverseen but for whom he had named hisonly son If Grant needed 500 the letter went on to say he would please signify it by making out his promissorynote for that amount and forwardingit to the writer with the assurance thatthat the money would be forwarded tohim bjr the return mailI know you are honest and wTillpay some time declared the farmerand I would rather jtou would get themoney from me than from somebodywho cares for you only as he can nsfyou The npshot of the business wasthat Gen Grant accepted the farmersoffer without a moments hesitationwhile declining the aid of millionaireswho insisted

quality of the milk and butter from a good cow An extra yield ofbutter will naturally follow the useof a richer ration but this is not always the case with a common cow Sothere is something in the breed as wellas in the feed -The dairyman who is seeking the bestresults at the 16west cost should satisfy himself as to what are the best kindsof feed considering the cost that willproduce the most and the best milksGenerally a combination of feedingmaterials will give the best results ascertain elements wanting in some foodwill be supplied by others Succulentfood increases the flow of milk but doesnot materially increase the proportionof water in it Still feed often doesmake a change in the dry substance offthe milkA ration rich in albuminoids willmake a richer milk and the relativeproportions of fat and casein arechanged to a very considerable extentby a change in the ration Anotherpoint that is well settled is that certain kinds of f oodnvill produce changesin the composition of milk not indicated by chemical analysis Succulentfood is productive of the largest quantity of fat in the milk and also hasthe effect of causing the cream to separate more readily from the milk andthe butter globules from the creamleaving less fat in the buttermilkFor a dryfeefr a combination of fouiparts of wheat bran two of cornmealand one of linseed oil makes one oithe best especially during the winterIf any change is made in summer itwould be from corn to ground oatsThis with good pasture makes a complete rationrf or a milch cow during thesummer When the pasturage cannolbe supplied some good soiling cropthat can be cut off and fed green maytake its placeLiberal feeding is always necessarywith the dairy cow as it is only thsurplus over and above what is necessary to sustain life and thrift that isused for milk If the cow is kept up toher full capacity she must have all theappetizing -milk-producing food shewill consume It is only this kind oifeeding

creaming in the private dairyloses more fat than most farmersdream of If ice is used at once aftermilking to reduce the water round thecans to about 40 degrees Fahrenheitthe fat will rise leaving not more thanone fifth of one per cent and if thewater is at 60 degrees or above one percent or more will be left in the skimmilk This one or more per cent is athird or a half of all the fat in themilk This suggests the putting up ofice by the private dairyman Tbe climate of iiansas provides for this andit is a greater boon than many imaginePjof James Wilsonr-MIPHYSICIANS BAFFLED- IProf R S Bowman
