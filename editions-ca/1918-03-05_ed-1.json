mission work of the denomination.
The women's organizations of the
churches will meet for special ser
vices during the week, and th3
churches have been asked to hold ap
propriate services for the observance.
The International Sunday School
Association, with headquarters in
Chicago, has begun a continent-wide
compaign for the observance of
Children's week, May 5 to 12 of this!

have celebrations similar to those of
the recent Father and Son move

tion. The main subject to be
'stressed during the celebrations is
"The Religous Education of the
Children."

ham will be selected soon. Rev.

in preparation for the campaign have .
been under way for several months, J
and by the enlistment of approxi-1
