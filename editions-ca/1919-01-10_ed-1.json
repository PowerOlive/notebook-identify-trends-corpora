FOR
THE FATHERLESS
DEEN OF PRANCE
din-
Are you taking care of a father
less child in France?
Could there be a worthier cause
or a more perfect charity than this?
Compare our happiness and pros
perity to-day with the condition of
France!
As a thank offering to God for our
world peace could there be any thing
more appropriate than to care for
one of these poor little unfortunates
for a year?
Wherever a boy is coming home
safe and sound fropn the great trial
to which he went so bravely, the
hearts of his own parents 'go outto
the home where the husband, father
or son will never come again. l
Now will you not, as a thank
offering, take care of a child whose
father fought so bravely before he
fell, and who may have struck down
the foe who otherwise might have
lived to kill your boy?
The cries of these little children
have gone straight to the heart of
America. To-day over 200,000 of
these orphans are being cared for by
the people of this nation, but there
are many more of these helpless,
suffering, pitiable, little children
over there in France.
Think what 10 cents a day, $360
a year, 'means to them, as well as the
joy it brings to the heart-broken
mothers.
The letters received from them
testify to the good such a spall sum
of money can do.
Nearly 300 children have been
adopted through the Bourbon County
Committee. Some of our people have
taken as many as six orphans for the
year, and others two, three and
four.
Below is the list of adoptions sent
in for the month of December:
Mrs. A. B. Hancock, Chairman
Fatherless Children of France, will
be glad to answer any questions.

A GOOD WX)K WELL DONE
Among the most earnest and" faith
ful workers for the interest of the
new Presbyterian church in this city
was Mrs. M. H. Dailey, to whose un
tiring efforts and successful manage
ment is due the major portion of the
credit for securing the (magnificent
pipe organ, which was recently in
stalled and dedicated to the memory
of the late Dr. Frank Fithlan.
Mrs. Dailey took the work in
charge at the outset of the movement
to honor the memory of one of the
most popular physicians of Paris, and
was made Chairman of the committee
which collected the funds for the
purpose. Her work was unceasing,
and day and night she superintended
the work, which came to a successful
conclusion with the purchase of the
instrument, one of the best of its
kind in the State.
