Ferguson, swell-known electrician, living at 903Lagrange street, Toledo, Ohio, in aninterview, lecently."A month ago," continued Mr.Ferguson, "it would have been impossible for me to do the work I amdoing to-day. Five ' years ago Icommenced to have rheumatism inmy left shoulder and arm and acrossmy back under the shoulder blade.I kept getting worse until I had tobe carried to a hospital, where I layhelpless I could not raise my handcould not move without help. During the past four years I have lostat least eighteen months from workon -account of this rheumatism.Most of the time I could not evenlay back in a barber's chair to getshaved, and my left arm was sohelplfess I could not raise my handto wash my face. Since leaving thehospital a year ago those awfulpains started up in my arm and thefear of getting down helpless againalmost drove me mad. At the time'I got Tanlac I was also sufferingfrom stomach trouble and had beenfor ten years. I distinctly rememberabout a year before the rheumatismcame on me, of being troubled sowith indigestion, spots coming befoie my eyes, and dizziness that 1got alarmed. I could hardly bearto think of eating, as the simplestkind of food would sour on myFtomach and cause a sickening sensation and intense, pains. Aftereven a very light meal my heartwould palpitate and act so peculiarthat I was afraid I had hearttrouble."I tried all kinds of medicines,had the best treatment, and spenthundreds of dollars in my efforts toget rid of stomach trouble, to saynothing of what I have paid outsince the rheumatism struck me,nut never got more than a littlepassing relief. I could see no wayout of my troubles until I read astatement for Tanlac a few weeksago from a man who had sufferedwith the same kind of troubles." Thefirst bottle gave me a good appetiteand as soon as I got so I could eatpnd digest my food I noticed thepains in my arms and shoulderrgetting less. I can use my left armand hand better now than in threeyears. The other day I tried layingback in the barber's chair and wasoverjoyed to find that my shoulderdid not pain me the least bit. I ameating three good, hearty meals aday and can just feel myself gettingstronger all the time. I think anyone who finds relief after sufferingas I did ought to be willing, for thesake of others, to Tell what did it."Tanlac is sold in Paris at thePeople's Pharmacy.

The manufacture ofbutter in this country is at presenta little less than a year ago, andconsumption is heavy, so that themarket as a consequence has remained firm. If present weathercontinue? it should bring a largerproduction of butter each weekfrom now on.Receipts of live poultry havecontinued extremely light, and onaccount of the heavy demand forfowl I for the Jewish, holidays, livepoultry has sold at record prices.The movement of live fowl from thefarmers in Southern States is "beginning to increase and prospectsare for slightly lower prices.Production and receipts of eggshave continued to show material increases, but, on account of the heavj'demand from consumers and the factThat at this time of the year eggs,an account of quality, are beingput into storage, markets have continued on a high level.oIEISCONVINCED BYRECENT TRIALPerson Test Proved Perfect TonicTo Be The "Very -Best of AH"Declares NurseLOUISVILLE, KY.,' April 15."Several people had told me thatTrutona .was the very best tonic Icould find and I think the same ofThe medicine myself now, becauseit's simply wonderful the wuy Trutona has brought me out of mytroubles."In the foregoing words is to beseen the leason why Mrs. MamiaBruce, a well-known Louisvillenurse who lives at 1018 South Seventh street, so highly praises thePerfect Tonic.
