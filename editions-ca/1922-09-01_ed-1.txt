The object of thedinner was stated by the toastmaster, Judge Emmett M. Dickson, toget the Presbyterian officers of Paristogether and tell them what thismovement meant to Paris and theentire State of Kentucky. JudgeDickson stated that "this movement is a permanent investment tobe made by the united churches andis one of the greatest opportunitiesever offered Presbyterians of Paristo do their part in the great causefor Christian education."Dr. John C. Acheson, President ofthe Kentucky College for Women,was one of the speakers of the evening. Dr. Acheson is known throughout Kentucky and the Presbyterianchurch as an authority on Christianeducation. Dr. Atcheson stressedthe crying need of Christian education in Kentucky to-day. He said,in the course of his remarks, that"there are three problems that faceAmerica to-day educationally. Thepresnce of illiteracy, the need of intellectual leadership and a growingdemand for character that is buttressed by all the chiristian virtues."He further stated that "the chiefend of education is not culture, butcharacter. The Christian college ispresided over by strong and virileChristian men and women, andonly in such an atmosphere canChristian character be developed, forafter 'all, character is propagated,not evolved. Education, as Dr. Butler puts it, includes sympathy withand penetration into science, art,literature, our political institutionsand our religious life. Religioustraining, therefore, stands on a parwith every other element that enters into education, nay, more itstands superior to every other for ithas to do with not only this life, butthat which is to come. Because ofthe secularizing tendencies of today, it is imperative that the Presbyterian churches support and maintain their schools and colleges on ahigh standard."Rev. John M. Vander Meulen, D.D.f President of the PresbyterianTheological Seminary of Louisville,and recognized as one of the foremost educators in Kentucky, stressed the necessity for building up ourjjistitutions and pointed out theunited effort on the part of bothbranches of the Presbyterian churchto better conditions throughout theState. He said, in part, "we aremet as Presbyterians, and we havemany things of which we may beproud as Presbyterians. But that ofwhich we may justly be proud isthat we own an institution (CentreCollege) which has probably produced more distinguished men thanany other denominational college inthe country twice its size, or anyState institution many times aslarge. And we are met as Christians to do the thing which Christmost wants us to do, and which Hiscause most needs to further institutions like the college and seminary which shall train men to . beChristians. Paris is the first one ofthe thirteen cities in Kentucky tobe appealed to. Paris holds theproud position of leadership. WillParis meet the challenge to ' thegreatest opportunity that will everbe given the Presbyterians of thisgeneration to do a big thing forChrist? I feel that this is a causethat appeals tp the heart and prideof every Presbyterian in Kentucky."As a climax of the interesting program came a telegram from theRev. T. S. Smylie, who is recoveringhis health in the mountains ofNorth Carloina. The message read:"Tell the people the pastor is counting on them to do their best in agreat cause. Second Corinthians,seven, sixteen."Mr. Peale Collier accepted thechairmanship of the Executive Committee upon being assured of thebacking and support of the Presbyterians of, Paris. The announcement of Mr. Collier's decision wasreceived amid applause and manyexpressions of loyalty.Features of the dinner were thedecorations and elaborate menu under the direction of Mrs. CharlesDuncan, assisted by the ladies of thechurch. Delightful music was furnished by an orchestra in charge ofMiss Elizabeth Crutcher.oCOURT NEWSIn the County " Court Judge Geo.Batterton dismissed a writ of habeascorpus issued by Opal Harneyagainst his wife, Mary Brown Harney, through the plaintiff's attorney, Judge , Denis Dundon.

Theact showed premeditation and deliberation in its manner of execution. Redmon had been drinking hardfor some time, but had been persuaded by members of the familyand others to stay at home in thecountry. He had been heard to re-j mark that he was tired of going onin the manner he had been, and thatit was a bad thing to be sick all thetime. Yesterday morning he hadbeen talking to his sister, Mrs. Castle Redmon, with whom he resided,and stated that he was feeling verysick. Mrs. Redmon tried to cheerhim up, but the despondent manseemed to see no relief. Mr. Redmon and son were at work in a barnsome distance from the house.When Mrs. Redmon left to go tosome other part of the house, Redmon went into j;he house and secured a shotgun, went out into theyard. Placing the gun to his breasthe fired the contents of one barrel,which took effect in his left breast,piercing the heart and causing instant death. Hearing the shot Mrs.Redmon, her husband and son ranto the yard and found Mr. Redmondead.Coroner Rudolph Davis was summoned, and after conducting an investigation, decided an inquest unnecessary, the facts of self-destructionbeing too evident.Redmon was a son of the lateWashington and Rebecca AshurstRedmon, who resided at the oldhome place near Paris. He inheritedthe place, which he sold some timeago, and went to live with his sister. He was a man with a largecircle of friends who regret his untimely end.The funeral will be held from theresidence of Castle Redmon. Services will be conducted at the gravein the Paris Cemetery at 3:30o'clock this (Friday) afternoon, conducted by Rev. Arthur Fox, pastorof the Paris Baptist church. Thepall-bearers will be Jos.

It is a symptom. It indicatesthat within a comparatively shorttime women will be, as candidates,quite as strong, numerically, as menand- that local civic will sometimebe in the hands of the sex frequently referred to as gentle, andnot infrequently referred to asdeadly.'"One of the surprises of women'senfranchisement has been the readiness with which she takes to politics, although it must be confessedshe has not shown a great deal ofinitiative. She adopts no new methods. She is not in any sense a reform influence to date. Politics maybe purified by her in time, but nowshe is mainly concerned in obtaining a foothold."Another one of the surprises isthe failure of efforts to organize thewoman vote and profit by it.

Nelu-4:20.REFERENCE MATERIAL Neh. 2:9-20;I Cor. 3:9-lT.PRIMARY TOPIC How God helped Nehemiah Build a Wall.JUNIOR TOPIC How a City "Wall WasRebuilt.INTERMEDIATE AND SENIOR TOPICPraying, Watching Working. "YOUNG PEOPLE AND ADULT TOPICSuccess Through Leadership and Cooperation. Having secured a leave of absencefrom the Persian court, and credentials from the king, Nehemiah journeyed to Jerusalem. After restingthree days without disclosing his purpose to any one, he made a surveyof the walls by night. Having thus obtained first-hand information he calledthe representatives of the Jews together and said, "Let us build thewalls of Jerusalem." He then madeknown the hand of providence inbringing him to Jerusalem with theauthority to rebuild its walls. He thusshowed great wisdom in finding outfor himself the real conditions andwhat work would be j-equired to restore the walls. The one who is qualified to lead in a great undertakingis the one who has mastered the situation and is thus able to remove objections and show how the work canbe done.. Preparation for the Building(ch. 3).The division of labor in this projectshows Nehemiah's administrative ability. A wise distribution of labor makesdillicult tasks easy.Note some outstanding features ofthis great work.1. Stress Laid Upon Indifference(3:5) In. administrative tasks it isjust that unfaithfulness should bepointed out. Such action will be awarning to some and an encouragement to others by showing the integrity of the directorT2. nelp Rendered by the Women(3:12). Perhaps Shallum had no sonsto aid him. It is a fine thing for'women to be able to take hold evenin building a wall when there are nomen to do it. God's word carefullynotes such extraordinary acts.3. Stress Laid Upon Earnestness ofSome (3:20). If one knows that hisfaithfulness will be recognized he willearnestly pursue his tasks.4. Every One Built Over AgainstHis Own House (3:10, 23, 23). Man'schief concern is for his family. No incentive to exertion is quite so strongas that which concerns his own family. 5. Certain Guilds of Men UndertookCertain Work (ch. 3:8, 31, 32). Wiseadministration sometimes calls forsucli alignment of efforts. Men of thesame class and craft will usually workbetter together.II. Hindrances Encountered (4:1-6:14).1. Scoffing of Sanballot and Tobiah(4:1-6; cf. 2:19-20). The opposers ofGod's servants usually begin by hurling at them shafts of ridicule. Theycalled the Jews but a feeble folk andasserted that the tread of a prowlingfox would break down their stone wall.2. Conspiracy of a Sudden Attack(4:7-9). When the enemy saw thatthe work was actually succeeding theychanged from ridicule to an attemptto throw the workmen into a panicand thus hinder the work. When theenemy cannot succeed by scoffing thenhe resorts to intimidation.3. Conspiracy With the Jews (4:10-23). They sought by means of theJews from the outside to .discouragetheir brethren by showing that thetask was hopeless and that at anytime they were subject to a suddenand secret attack.4. Greed and Oppression of theRulers (5:1-13). The Jews of thatday, like the profiteers in the recentWorld war, took advantage of thepoor and oppressed them so that theymortgaged their land and sold theirdaughters into slavery. Nehemiahboldly rebuked them for their crimesand ordered a restoration to be made,exacting an oath of them that theywould fulfil their promises.5. Scheme to Take Nehemiah's Life(6:1-14). When Sanballat and Tobiahfailed in every other way they soughtby craft to get Nehemiah away thatthey might kill him.III. The Wall Completed (6:15-7:4).So energetically did they pursuetheir tasks that In fifty-two days thewall was completed. When the enemies heard that In spite of all theirschemes the work was actually completed, they were cast down, for theyperceived that the work was of God.Find the Rock Beneath.The steps of faith fall on the seeming void, but find the rock beneath.Wbittier.Empty.Four things are grievously empty:A head without brains, a wit withoutjudgment, a heart without honesty,and a purse without money.

Alverson, formerly of Paris,;who some time ago purchased theplant and business of the HarlanEnterprise, with the intention ofconducting the paper as an independent in politics, announced inthe last issue of the Enterprise that it would hereafter be a Republican organ. Thenews caused much surprise and speculation among Mr. Alvrson'sfriends, in view of the fact that heis a born and bred Democrat, andnas been repeatedly honored by hisparty. In making his announcement Mr. Alverson said, in part:"Upon the present ownership assuming charge of The Enterprise, itwas announced at the outset that'"A NEW MOVEMENT IN THEDEMOCRATIC PARTYAt a meeting of Democrats, ladiesand gentlemen, who were associatedwith Col. P. H. Callahan two yearsago on the administration committee, appointed by the Central andExecutive Committees of the Democratic party after the defeat ofGovernor James D. Black, the futureof the party, its policies and its candidates were discussed informallyand while no program was outlined,as the election was considered tooremote, although the press and moVeactive politicians have been keenlyinterested for sometime, the following statement was issued to thepress:"It was the concensus of opinionthat the very first legislation shouldbe a system of proper accounting,to include the publishing at statedperiods of balance sheets showingthe condition of the State's financesjust as it required of the banks, sothat the public as well as the lawmakers will know where the Statestands financially and where themoney is coming from, as the firststep before considering additionalexpenditures and appropriations."The thought was also expressedand emphasized that the Commonwealth should have a Governor whohas been in close touch with suchcapacity and native pride that itwill be made the monumental effortof his life to co-ordinate and solidify all the resources and elementsof strength within our State, backedby a people with full and unswerving confidence in their executive toa program that will elevate Kentucky to the position her people deserve and her resources justify."While candidates were all discussed as to their past records andwhat might logically be expectedthe policy of the paper- thereafter from them in the future and howwouiu ue an independent paperHaving been on the ground and incharge of the paper for severalmonths, and becoming acquaintedwith the people of the community,with the "-circulation of the paper,and with the local conditions generally prevailing here, we are convinced that the policy of our excellent predecessor in conducting a Republican newspaper was the correctone, and we have decided to conductThe Harlan Enterprise henceforthas a Republican newspaper. However, this does not mean that thepaper will interfere in any local ofState faction fights in the Republican party, but its columns will always be open to the proper use of allcandidates fpr office, and anyone aspiring to a political office can restassured that he will be treated fairly and squarely by this paper. Anewspaper is and should be a community builder, and this it what wepropose to make of The Harlan Enterpise. It is our purpose to espouse the cause of and encourageany and all laudible enterpriseswhich look to the development andadvancement of the community andHarlan county. To do this we hopeto have the hearty co-operation ofthe people of this community andcounty, and we want them to feelthat this is their paper, and thatwith such co-operation from the people, we hope to make The Enterprisea paper which the people can pointto with pardonable bride In fact wewant to see Harlan, with its greatindustrial interests, grow and prosper like a gceen bay tree; with better churches, better roads and betterschools, and to that end The Enterprise hopes to bend its ever energyunder the present management."HAVE WE FOOD DRUNKARDS?each of them might or might notbe actuated by the agencies corruptand otherwise who have in the pastinfluenced and even controlled legislation, conventions and selectedcandidates, it was agreed that thepeople alone at a primary shouldmake the selection after being fullyadvised as to the candidates, towhich task all present would givetheir moral and financial support,and to be really helpful to the movement, under the circumstances,would positively decline to be candidates themselves."In the forthcoming election itshould be made clear early in thecampaign that Prohibition and theVolstead act are now Nationalissues, if they are to be taken up atall, and as this question in the pasthas retarded much necessary andurgent legislation, we should approach our new program of industrial and agricultural development,more and better education, cheapertransportation and distribution,more thorough and equitable taxation, with modern elemosynary institutions and management."The man for Governor shouldstick to the job and after puttinghis hand-to-the-plow, his furrowsshould restrict without bendinghere and there, and with no objectof having his friends succeed him tooffice, or more especially neglect theaffairs of the State in the absorbingambition for Senatorial honors.""The meeting was held at the homeof Col. Callahan in Cherokee Park,adjournment to meet again soon after the fall elections with a representative from each Congressionaldistrict.oBOURBON 'BOY WINNINGThe Enquirer tells of the successof Henry Thomas, a Bourbon countyboy, who is in the trotting horsegame in the West, as follows:"Henry Thomas continues on hiswinning way over the "Westerntracks.

They will bringold friends together easily andquickly and lessen almost to thevanishing point the chance of anyvisitor in Louisville to the StateFair being lonesome or alone.All of the last six State administrations are to be represented inthe reunions with the highest ranking officials of - the executive andlegislative branches as chairman.For the administrations prior tothose of the late United States Senator W. 0. Bradley, A. J. Carroll isto be chairman. 'While the political group reunions are expected to bring hundreds together, the .military, fraternal and educational gatherings willhave the widest appeal. Veterans offour wars, including the Mexican,will have their individual boothsas meeting places in the reunionscheme as will graduates and former students in every educationalinstitution of note in Kentucky. Sothat absolutely no visitor can be leftwithout a meeting place, the largestbooths of all willbe those for reunions or present ana iormer residents of the various sections of Kentucky. Days will designated for the manygatherings. In selecting them theidea has been to choose one onwhich the greatest number fromthe reunion scheduled are certain tobe present.

To-day it is on the toplayer of American newspapers, oneof the very few that has a direct influence through its readers upon theoutcome of elections and publicmovements.For much of this Delevan Smithwas responsible. He was not only asound business man, but he had realnewspaper ideals and understanding. " The one incident of the concealed Fairbanks ownership of TheNews has been waived in view of thelong and honorable life of the publisher and the newspaper.The staff of a newspaper has theburden of realizing on the ability ofthe director, and Delavan Smith always appreciated this fact. Consequently The News staff is able, loyaland free. Anyone who doubts thatshould have heard what Henry Palmen, then city editor, said to Mr.Smith when the publisher sought togossip at his elbow while Mr. Palmer was trying to write a runningstory of the Taft convention of 1912.Cordially, yet necessarily, cussed outby his subordinate for interferingwith a working man, Mr. Smith settled back with a look of alarm onhis face very strongly intermingledwith pride and pleasure.Recent poultry culling demon-trations neld x on Bourbon countyfarms by the extension division ofthe College of Agriculture at Lexington and interested peusons showed that farmers and -poultry raisersin this section of the State arekeenly interested in the improvement of their flocks, according toan announcement from the collegepoultry section. ,The demonstrations held in this section were apart of the drive being conductedover the State by the college poultrymen, county agricultural agentsand other interested persons to ridfarm flocks of the large number oflow producing and boarder hensthat stop laying at this .time ofthe year and loaf until spring.Six demonstrations were held inthis county with an attendance ofapproximately 96 interested persons.
