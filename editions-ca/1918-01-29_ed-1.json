Eldridge, of Lexington.
Out in Phoenix, Ariz., a movement
has been inaugurated for the forma
tion of "Two Bits a Day" clubs
the members of which are to buy a
quarter's worth of Thirft Stamps
every day. Three ,men each took a
hundred Thirft cards, pasted one
stamp in each card, and sold the en
tire lot before two blocks had been
covered.
"Two bits" is the old term, dat
ing back to the early days of thu i
country, for a quarter of a dollar,
and is still used in the South and
West Every patriotic American
now wants "to do his bit;" the
of these clubs are carry
ing out this idea finely in doing
their "two bits" every day. It is to
be hoped that "Two Bits a Day"

I More Money From the Same Feed
That's the experience of every farmer who uses Avalon
Farms Hog-Tone. "Tone" a hog and he thrives better.
He assimilates a bigger percentage of his food. He is' not
held back in his growth by the dozens df parasites and
disorders that are an ever present menace to his growth.
Read this letter about getting more value from the same
feed.

In answer to your inquiry of my succes in feeding Hog
Tone, will say-that it has been with good success. I would
say that it is a great appetizer, and will Iso say that it is
benefieial to any hog that is not feeding out good. A man
will get more feeding values from his feed if he will keep
his hogs in good condition and I haye found no better con
ditioner than Avalon Farms Hog-Tone.
