RECKLESS JOY-RIDERS.
The "joy-rider" must be suppressed
in the interest of human life and the
community generally, but unless the
efforts to do so are strong and contin
uous', and the penalties of speeding
impartial and drastic the speeder will
continue to be a Juggernaut with at
tendant human sacrifice.
Another thought, by the way.
The law says plainly that every
automobile must have its number in
plain view on .. the rear of the ma
chine, and with a light reflecting up
on it at night so that it may be seen.
A blind man can satisfy himself that
this law is broken into splinters any
night upon the streets of Paris, and
more than likely it is supposedly done
by "joy-riders" from adjoining towns
who think they are "here to-day
and gone to-day" so the very pur
pose for which the requirements were
fixed the identity of the offenders
can be defeated.
A few days ago, as he says, a man
came very near being run over at the
corner of Eighth and Main by a reck
less auto Jehu driving a big machine
in which was party of "joy-riders" un
known to him, and in turning to see
the number of the machine got for
his pains a smile from the chaufleur
as he speeded away again in the di
rection of Lexington. He was smil
ing (the chauffeur, of course) because
there was no identification license
tag, not even a rear signal light on
the back of the machine.
There are many, many such guilty
ones.
