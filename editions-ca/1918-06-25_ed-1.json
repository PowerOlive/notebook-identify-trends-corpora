BRECKINRIDGE
Miss Curry Desha Breckinridge,
one of the best-known women in Cen
tral Kentucky, died at the Presby
terian Hospital, in Chicago, at one
o'clock, Sunday morning, after an
illness of three months.
In May, 1915, Miss Breckinridge
went to Europe with a Red Cross
unit. For six months she was in a
base hospital near the firing line in
France, and was afterward in the
hospitals in Paris, and at Neuilly, in
France. Last fall she came home for
the purpose of aiding in the organi
zation of the Dr. Barrow Base Hos
pital Unit. In March she suffered
an attack of grippe, which affected
her heart. Early in April her sister,
Miss Sophro-nisba Breckinridge,
brought her to the Presbyterian Hos
pital, where she had taken her train
ing as a nurse and where she died.
Miss Breckinridge was in this city
last spring and delivered an address
at a Red Cross mass meeting held at
the court house.
Funeral services were held at the
Christ Church Cathedral, in Lexing
ton, at 4:30 o'clock yesterday after
noon, conducted by Bishop Louis Bur
ton. The body was interred on the

THOUSANDS OF GERMANS SACRI
FICED IN VAIN EEFORT
TARIS, June 24. Eighty thousand
Germans were killed, wounded or
r made prisoner during the offensive
between Montdidier ancf Noyon, Cap-
. tain Andrew Tardieu, who accom-
panied Premier Clemenceau to the
.front on Sunday, told Marcei Hutin,
editor of the Echo de Paris, upon
liis return to Paris.
"This is a figure which should make
- even Ludendorff reflect," he said.
"One cannot insist enough upon the
exceptional importance of the re-
. salts obtained by the counter-attacks
r of divisions under General Mangin
S gainst the right flank of General von
mtiers armies," he continued. "This
t magnificent operation has nailed the
enemy to the spot and completely
-cheeked the advance toward Com
piefrne. German officers who were
made prisoner do not attempt to hide
their chagrin at their inability to
reach Cosipiegne, which they admit
was their objective."
Premier Clemenceau contented
kimsolfjby remarking: "I am eom
pletely satisfied." - .

Every few years someone, who be
lieves he has the power of prophecy,
announces that the horse is doomed.
When the railroads first began to
!send their slender steel rails across
the country, supplanting the lazy,
lumbering stage coaches, these same
prophets announced that the breeding
of horses was a thing of the past.
Still the number of horses in the
country increased from year to year.
Many years passed and the bicycle
appeared. Men and boys gave up
their saddle horses and began to
touehen theselves for long bicycle
rides on country roads. Again the
prophets came out to tell the people
that the "horse was a, back number.
But horses increased throughout the
length and breadths of the country as
they had for years.
Later the electric cars in the cities
turned many horses out of a living.
This gave the croakers another op
portunity to prophesy some more and
they did. Quite recently the automo
bile, the motorcycle, the auto truck
and the tractor have come to take
the place of the horse. Yet his num
bers have grown and are growing
psteadily. In fact, statistics prove
that the increase year after year is
aknost the same in spite of all the
inventions which have come to sup
plant him.
A man will grant his wife any
right more cheerfully than the right
to be sick when he feels bad himself.
He who can suppress a moment's
anger.may prevent a day of sorrow.

TOBACCO AS A RATION
WASHINGTON, June 24. Two
events of possible far-reaching im
portance happened at the War De
partment within a few minutes of
each other last Tuesday when
Count Macchi di Cellere, the
Italian Ambassador, went into con
ference with Secretary of War Baker
the result of the conference may
be evident in the near future and
shortly thereafter Mr. Baker, in re
sponse to inquiry, explained to the
newspaper men that he would not op
pose any action by Congress looking
to extend the draft age limit.
There is no connection with the two
incidents, but each may have distinct
importance. The news that Mr.
Baker has modified his position some
what with respect to the draft age
limit is highly important because of
its possible future effect on so many
thousands if not hundreds of thous
ands of able-bodied American fight
ing men over 31.
Secretary Baker's position now re
futes the theory of that famous
Frenchman, De la Rechtoucalt, who
remarked that one is always ready to
distrust ones memory but never one s
judgment. Mr. Baker's judgment has
been that it would be better to stay
with the prescribed age limit of 21
to 31, but if the judgment of Con
gress is otherwise he is ready to con
sider yielding the point.
It appears that after Secretary
Baker's statement to the newspaper
correspondent lastweek that the ques
tion of extending the age limit had not
been considered by him at all Pro
vost Marshal General Crowder came
to him to say that he had been asked
to appear before the Senate Military
Affairs Committee on the matter of
the draft age limit. General Crowd
er views were not in harmony with
those of Mr. Baker, and the former
told the Secretary he had no desire
to embarrass the War Department's
policy and feared perhaps that his
testimony might tend to do so. Gen
eral Crowder is known to favor in
principle an extension of the draft
age limit after Class 1 is exhausted,
but he has not stated that he favors
extending it from 18 to 45. Probably
19 to 36 would be more in line with
General Crowder's judgment.
This means that after Class 1 is
exhausted General Crowder favors
getting men nhvsicallv fit and without
dependents over 31 before taking men
wztn dependents, etc., irom Classes
2, 3 and 4. General Crowder ex
pects that all the 2,420,000 of Class 1
will be exhausted by the end of the
present year. So far 1,347,000 have
already been called into service.

PLANS AERCRAPT MOVEMENTS
ACROSS THE ATLANTIC.
General Brancker, of the British
army; has disclosed the fact that the
British air council had definitely de
cided upon trans-Atlantic aircraft
flights in order to find a route for
movement of American-made aircraft
to the front. His mission in this
country has to do with arrangements
for the pioneer flight in which it is
hoped the United States government
will co-operate.
It is expected the Initial flight will
be jinade this autumn in a machine of
British make, probably a seaboat
starting from Newfoundland touch
ing at the Azores and Portugal, be
fore arriving in Ireland. It has been
estimated the trip can be made in
forty hours of flying. Plans under
consideration call for crews of four
men, composed of an engineer, a re
lief of pilots, and a navigation officer.

As to the order of the War De
partment making tobacco an army
ration, the wonder will be that it was
not issued long ago. 'Thus far the
chief sources of supply have been
private agencies, which, admirably
conducted as they are, can hardly
have met the situation adequately.
By including tobacco among the
regular rations, even with a small al
lowance, the department does more
than relieve the expeditionary forces
of what in some cases was an ex
pense. It guarantees the delivery of
the goods in places beyond the reach
of any other instrumentality, benev
olent or commercial.
There are many well-meaning peo
ple who regard the tobacco habit as
a deadly vice, and it is possible that
we shall hear from them. We are
to remember, however, that with the
first arrival of American troops in
France, Gen. Pershing authorized the
use by them of light wines, as is the
custom of the country. If our severe
Prohibitionists have not found it nec
essary to upset the entire war pro
gram on this account, perhaps the
hardly less abstemious anti-tobacco
propaganda will wink at the solace
which fighting men may be able to
derive daily from two-fifths of an
ounce of plug-cut or four soul-destroying
cigarettes.
Let a child feel you are displeased
not at him, bu at the sin he com
mits. Can tin angry parent do this?
