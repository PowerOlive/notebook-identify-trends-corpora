Invitations have be. n iEeued as folIncal firrns who have contracted fort-lows: "standing seed will place their sirippeis "Mr. and Mrs. J"ss?. S NaDierin tne neiu ana wun a large lorce oM recmests ne honor of v iir nrpwnpp atmen will push the harvest with allhaste before the seed, which is ripensing rapidly, begins to fall off.From estimates that have beenfurnished bv the local dealers therewill be a bumper crop of seed thisseason, exceeding by many thousandbushels, the heaviest crop in recentyears. The seed is unusually heavyand has beaded out well. Good weather prevailing the harvest will be completed in two or three weeks.Hundreds of strippers will be placedin the fields Thursday morning. K. B.Hutchcraft, of this city, wwho hasabout 1,500 acres of seed to harvest,will operate 20 strippers. Spears &Sons will probably have the largestnumber in operation, and exnect to begin work with severity in their effortto get in the crop from 6,000 acres asearly as possible. Thomason, Collins& Redmon, of North Middletown, whohave contracted Jfor 6,000 acrr3 ofstanding seed, will put" forty-sevenmachines in the field,C. S. Brent & Bro., of Paris, whohave purchased the seed from upwardof 5,000 acres, will start Thursdaymorning with fifty strippers, andStuart & O'Brien will operate aboutsixteen. Several parties in the NorthMiddletown precinct, who have beforethem large contracts for seed, willoperate stripers, and a number of individuals will have outmachine3 for theharvest, among them being John andThomas Maher, of Paris, who willplace fifteen machines in the' field.The blue grass seed market is themost interesting topic of conversationat the present time. This year's cropis undoubtedly the largest on record,being estimated from nine hundredthousand to one million two hundredand fifty thousand bushels.A prominent blue grass seed dealerhas furnished the News with the following table of crops and prices coveringthe last twelve years :Yr. Est. bu. in crop. Pr. cured Aug.1900 500,000 42-45c1901- 400,000 50c1202-275,000 72c1903 340,000 65c1904 550,000 40-42C1905 275.00H 70-75C1906 350,000 80-85c1907 425,000 90c-$1.151908 600,000 60-62C1909 500,000 90c-$1.001910 200,000 $1.40-81. 551911 35J.000 1.50-5.75The above figures are all based onstripped seed aftei it is curd.This dealer staled that never duringthese twelve years has the entire cropot blue grass seed been consumed.Even after the crop of 1910 wasmarketed, there remained about fivecar loads unsold, and the 1910 crop isthe shortest on record, the seed havingbeen killed by a late freeze thatspring.The bulk of the Hue grass seed cropis used for making lawns, and is mixed with various other seeds, whichhave some qualities that are superiorto Kentucky Blue grass seed in certainlocalities. The most prominent seedused in this ccnnecticu are red lop,white clover, rye grass, and CanadianBlue Grass. When any of theses seedsbecomes exclusively high in price because of short crop or for other feasors, the proportion of that seed used inthe lawn grass mixture is reduced. Itis for thi 3 reason that the consumptionof Kentucky Blue Grass Seed is reduced hen the piice of it is higherthan that of the other seeds used inthe mixture.The price of blue grass seed for the1911 crop was tht hiehesl ever known,and those dealers who bought largelyclaim that they were unable to marketit, for the reasons above given, andthat thev are still carrying largestocks of it by reason of which theywill be forced to -take heavy losses onlast year's transactions.Another factor in the situation aboutwhich most Kentucky farmers aremore or less ignorant is the size of theWestern crop. In 1911 this Westerncrop amounted to about sixty thousandbushels. Advices from there this yearindicate a crop of one hundred andfifty tu two hundred thousand. ThisWestern seed is sought after by dealers who sel.l to the retail trnda becausethe Western farmer does, not strip ituntil it has thoroughly ripened, and.as a consequence, it germinates verymuch better than the average lot ofseed that is strinped in Kentucky. Asan indication of the condition in whichthe average tanner strips his blue eras? !seed in Kentucky, this dealer statedthat in curing blue grass seed there isa shrinkage of about forty per cent, :whereas, if the seed was stripued ripe,it would not shrink more than twentyper cent. In claening blue grass seedthere is a further shrinkage of thirtyfive to fortyfive per cent, the formerbeing for lots free from straw andweeds.ihe Kentucky farmer could unaouotediy create a larger demand forhis blue grass seed if he would furnishtne consumer with an article thatwould grow better,- and at the sametime lie could realize a better price.xne iventuc'jv dea er is nnwpr prs fnremedy this condition, fie is morpthan willing to co-operate with thelarmer, but the latter must take thenrst step.onurthe marriage nf their daughterNora CeceliatoMr. Rhudolph Joseph GuttWednesday mornim?.
