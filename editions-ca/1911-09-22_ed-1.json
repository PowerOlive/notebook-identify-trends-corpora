Christmas Seal Has Besn Given
Approval.
The sale uf Red Cross Christmas
seals this year will be carried on along
broader lines and will be larger and
more comprehensive than ever before," j
is tne inrcrniation given out by the
National Anti-Tuberculosis Associa
tion. This bulletin of the National
Association states further that the or
der of Postmaster General prohibiting
certain stamps and seals doe3 noc ap
ply at all in case of the Christmas seal.
The seal this year has been definitely
approved by Postmaster General
Hitchcock.
The new seal will depict a very pret
ty winter scene. In the upper left
hand corner will appear a small red
cross. The entire design is inclosed
with a heavy red circle. The year is
expressed in Roman numerals and the
only other words are "American Red
Cross, Merry Christmas, Happy New
Year." The corners of the aeal are in
white, thus giving the effect of a cir
cular seal when affixed to letters and
packages.
The only prohibition in the use of
the Red Cross seal this year is that
theymust not be used on the face of
letters or packages, but must be plac
ed eisewnere man on tne tace, in any
iuuiuiiics.

Note In the Ceylon Independent:
"Dear Sir Mudalizar Harry Jayawar
dana has evidently forgotten that he
handed me his hat at the cremation
of the late high priest. I am sorry I
failed to inform him before that, car
ried away by the"- sentiment of the
moment, I flung it to the burning pyre,
hoping for future merit May the merit
be his, as he was the owner of the
hat!"
Test That Failed.
Jean is a very matter-of-fact tot of
three summers. Her mother one day
while holding in her arms the wee
baby sister, who was very delicate re
marked: "Dear me, she looks so frail
a breath would blow her away." Jean,
taking a long breath, puffed it sudden
ly into the face of the little sister,
and, stepping back, waited a moment
In silence. Then In a disappointed
tone she said: "Well, why don't
you go?"

"I wonder," mused the contempla

in meeting and confess that he had
just enough religion to make him miserable?"
Municipal Reform in Georgia.
For several years there has been a
law forbidding the running of bulls
loose on the streets. This law has
not been enofrced for several years,
but it does seem that it should now
be enforced, as there are several such
animals now at large. Blackshear
