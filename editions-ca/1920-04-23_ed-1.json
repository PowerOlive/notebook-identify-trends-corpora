is a man of four score years, well
preserved and keenly alive to every
interest in Masonry. He will deliver
a Masonic lecture in the lodge room
this evening at 7:30 o'clock, after
which he will confer the Palm and
Shell degree on all who may desire
it, giving it as he received it in the
Orient. Rev. Coleman has spent
many thousand dollars in his study
of Masonry, and was a co-worker
wiUi (he famous Rob Morris, whose
name is 'familiar with Masonry.
Supt. Colvin, State Superintendent-
of Public Instruction, de
livered an address at the M. M. I.
Hall, Monday evening, in i!he inter
est, of the new Graded School, which
will open at the M. M. I. next Sep-'
(ember, the county having purchas
ed the property. Notwithstanding
the inclement weather there was a
good audience present. Rev. W. W.
Morton, pastor of the Presbyterian
church, presided over the meeting.
The meeting opened with, a prayer
by Dr. Fisher, president of the M.
C., followed-by an address by Mr. O.
E. Hurst. Mr. Hurst reviewed
briefly the work of Col. and Mrs.
Best in Millersburg, calling atten
tion to (he 'conditions of the prop
erty at the time they took charge
of it, when purchased by them from
the K. W. C. Board. HoW through
their efforts, the property had been
built up and made what it is now.
How the school' started as the M. T.
S., calling attention to the ever
memorable barbecue, given in the
woods of the late Mis. C. C. Clarke,
after which time the M. M. I. was
started, closing his most appropriate
address, with a beautiful tribute to
Col. and Mrs. Best. Supt. Colvin
delivered the address of the evening,
which was indeed good, calling at
tention to the changed condition of
the times, the necessity of free
school education, the necessity of
bringing all classes together into one
common body, in order that in the
future they might be the bone and
sinew of this great commonwealth,
explaining the new State laws on ed
ucation passed by the last Legisla
ture. Many of our people, in fact,
most of us, were under the impres
sion that the property was purchas
ed with the view that the county
High School would be conducted
here. Mr. Colvin led us to believe
that, it would be for this district and
didn't speak of it as a County High
School, and that perhaps the Paris
High School would be in advance of
this district, and that we might
serve to that extent as a feeder to
that school. However, it was good,
and the opposition to tfie purchase
of the-property by the county, which
was manifested here immediately
' after the sale, is rapidly passing
away. By the time the new school
opens the most of our citizens will
be' ready to give it a hearty wel
come. o

Twice he was elected to Congress by

He has been a winner in business,

' There is nothing in his record that
hould alienate a single Democratic
yote.
1 There is much in his record that will
command thousands of Independent
and Republican voles.
His popularity was a big factor in
putting the pivotal State of Ohio in
tne Democratic column in 1016.
' Ohio's electoral votes are -needed
this year;she can swing them.
' "What other Democratic candidate

The Cox Movement in Kentucky is
Sacked, by citizens who see in the nom
