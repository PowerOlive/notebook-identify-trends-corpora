Business men are positivethat all past records have beeneclipsed and that the volume of business transacted here in the pastfew days has been larger than forany corresponding Christmas in recent years.Although they have been seriously handicapped by the fuel restrictions put in force the first part ofthe month, merchants say that thetrade they have had since the banwas lifted more than makes up forthe loss. With hundreds of dollarsreleased into business channelsthrough the medium of the tobaccosales held in Paris, a large part ofwhich is spent with the Paris merchants, not to mention the Christmas savings that will come into playfrom the Savings Clubs, money willbe found one of the handiest andmost plentiful commodities on theParis market.Stocks in the stores of the localmerchants being full, -despite thehigh prices and lowered production,a larger share than usual of thetrade of this section has fallen tothe lot of the Paris merchants.Hundreds of their customers whohave been going to Lexington andother places have returned to thefold, and the smiles on the faces ofParis dealers speaks ample testimonyof the efficacy of advertising, especially those who have patronized thecolumns of THE NEWS.THE PLACE TO BUYThe House of Oualtty forJewelrvx ' SHIRE &FITHIAN.CHRISTMAS FRUITS, NUTS, ETC.Buy your fruits, candies and nutsfrom Mrs. Ellis' Cash Grocery, opposite court house.

WINTERS CO.sDANGERS OF FIREsrWith the ftearness of Christmascomes the season dreaded by firemen and insurance people. Fireworks, Christmas tree decorations'and. other causes tend to make theholiday season figure conspicuously,in the .day's news in reports ofproperty loss and loss of life fromfire. State Fire Marshal Thos. Parnell has issued the following warning, requesting the papers to give itpublicity:"Every year there are many children burned to death and manyhhomes destroyed by fire from theChristmas candles."Do not decorate your Christmastree with paper, cotton, or any inflammable material. Use metallictinsel, or other non-inflammable decorations only, and fasten the Christmas tree securely, so that childrenin reaching for things on the treecannot tip it' over."Do not use cotton to representsnow. If you must have snow, useasbestos fibre."Do not permit children to light,or re-light the candles while the parents or older persons are not present. They frequently set fiie to theirclothing."Do not have matches lying aroundwithin easy reach of the children.Candles are meant to be lighted, andif the children get matches, they willexperiment with them. Children imitate their elders. Use only safetymatches."Do not allow Christmas trees toremain in the building after theholidays. The tree ignites leadilywhen the needles have become dry.A large number of fires occur fromChristmas trees being lighted in thehome after the holidays. 'Thinkthis over.'"How are you going to arrangeand fix your Christinas tree in yourhome? What are you going to doi.bout the wax candle and thematch? What about the boxes, excelsior straw, paper, etc.? Unknownto you, the loss of a child, or theloss of your home may, hinge and' depend upon your actions and answer.Remember that the use of all fireworks, such as Roman candles, firecrackers, toy balloons and otherpyrotechnic display is prohibited."Fire prevention leaves no attermath of regret. Remember the oldand true saying, An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'"Fires in winter impose unusuallysevere hardships upon -the firemen.Frozen ears, feet and hands is hislot, and are common when fightingfires in the winter. Pneumoniaand sickness follow exposure to thefiremen, and those driven by fire outinto" the snow, ice and wintryweather. Remember the fireman isa soldier in a- war that never ends.When he leaves his fire station hedoes not know whether he will everreturn. Think this over, and practice 'Fire Prevention.'"Don't forget the family garage.Never allow open flame lights in agarage. Run 'the automobile outsidewhen filling the tank, so that gasoline vapors will dissipate. Neverheat a garage with an open flame.A metal waste can should be locatedoutside of the garage, for oily wasteand rags. Keep an approved fire extinguisher and a pail of sand in thegarage. Water thrown on gasolinemerely serves to spread it. Remember gasoline vapors stay close to theground, and will explode when theycome in contact with a flame. Firesare easier to prevent than to extinguish. "Have the telephone number ofthe Fre Department on a specialcard at your telephoneInstruct,!the family how to -operate the firealarm box, and locate the one nearest your home. After sending in afire alarm from a fire alarm box,stay near the box to direct the firemen to the location of the fire. Every, minute is important. Don't failto notify The Chief of the Fire Department of anything you may seethat is dangerous or liable to causefire."O IBUY APPLES BY THE BOX;CHEAPER THAN BARREL'GOODS.Fancy apples in boxes for Christmas trade.

The success of the piece inboth cities is a matter of theatricnlhistory- It was one of the fewplays that survived the witheringNew York heat and ran well intothe summer.

The lackof cavalry at St. Mihiel, at ChateauThierry, in the Argonne and at Sedanmade American officers steeped in thetraditions of Forrest and Stuart, ofPleasanton and Sheridan fairly cry.There were some so called cavalry regiments in the A.

At no time was a singleAmerican cavalry regiment mounted.Victory Would Have Been Great.Even the cavalry of the British andFrench Armies, which hadbeen fairlywell horsed at the beginning of the1 warand more carefully conserved thanhad been the cavalry of the other members of the anti-German alliance, wasfound wholly insufficient to push homevictory and convert mere defeats ofthe German armies into routs in comparison with which the French disasters of Sedan and Metz in 1870 wouldhae been considered by the militarywriters of the future as orderly military operations.The entente allips and the Unitedbtntes had about three and a half million soldiers in the field on the western front in October, 1918. when they.hejran to pre the previously successful Germans back toward the Rhine indeadly earnest.
