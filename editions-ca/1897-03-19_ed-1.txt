Champion AfterGood Fight Was Knocked Out byLanky Bob in the Fourteenth Corbett is Still a Warm FaroriteCabson Nev March 18 After twoyears of doubt and vexatious postponements the heavyweight championshipof the world was decided beyond cavilwhen Robert Fitzsimmons sent JamesJ Corbett helpless to his knees with aleft hand blow under the heart after1 minute and 45 seconds in the fourteenth round of their battle in thearena in Carson Wednesday afternoonThe great contest was won in thesimplest manner and the knockout wasthe result of one unwary move on thepart of Corbett After the first minute of the fourteenth round had beenspent in a few harmless clinches andcounters Fitz made a fake lead withhis right for the jaw Io wasa simple ruse but it caughtit4y - - M the Californian naDTJino In-stead of keeping his body inclined forward and throwing back his head justa trifle allowing the blow which wasof the very lightest kind to slip byCorbett contemptously bent his headand chest backward and thus protruded his abdomen Fitzsimmons1small eyes flashed and like lightninghe saw and availed himself ofhis advantage Drawing backhis left he brought it upwith terrible force the forearmrigid and at right angles to the upperarm With the full strength of hiswonderful driving power brought intoplay the Australian fairly ripped theblow up the pit of Corbetts stomachat a point just under the heart Corbett was lifted clean off his feet andas he pitched forward Fitzsimmonsshot his right up and around catching Jim on the jaw and accelerating his downfall Corbettsank on his left knee and with hisoutstretched right grasped the ropesfor support His left arm worked convulsively up and down while his facewas twitching with an expression ofthe greatest agony Referee Silerthrew up his hands on the call often and left the ring- There weresome cries of foul whenreferee declared Corbettbut they were unheededanvbodv as the battle wasrStheoutbywonfairly and squarely The defeat nearlydrove Corbett wild When he wasable to feel his feet and his secondshadhelped him to his corner he brokeaway from them and rushed at Fitzsimmons who had not left the ringA scene of dreadful confusion ensuedThe ring was crowded with an excitedmob but Corbett burst through thatand struck at Fitz Thetralian kept his arms by hissides and with a great dealof generosity made allowance for Corbetts half demented condition Bobmerely ducked under the blow andwhen Corbett clinched with him andstruck him a feeble blow on the earIjj the champion only smiled It wasjjj t Wyf sj with great difficulty that Billy BradyyJilfe1r aTifithevseconds succeeded in quieting-f FrT Corbett down and getting him back tothe dressing roomThe fight was clean and speedy It-- demonstrated two facts that Corbettis the cleverest boxer of his weight inthe world and that Fitzsimmons isable to hit himThe battle as predicted was foughton purely scientific and almost newprinciples Neither of the men tookany advantage of the privileges allowed them under the London prizering rules and there was very littlehitting in clinchesCorbett made no attempt to bringaround his right on the breakingaway probably because Fitzsimmonsheld up his elbows too high Jimsonly effort in the way of a partingshot was a full right uppercut whichhe brought around very clumsily andi ai ed to land by at least a foot everytime he tried lie did get in onejTOod uppercut in the fourthround splitting Bobs upper lipand starting the blood in a thickstream Several times the menclinched and parted with both handsup Frequently Bob worked Jim intoa corner and reached for him rightand left with blows that would winany championship battle if they hadlanded Fitzsimmons himself admitsthat Corbett hustled and sidesteppedhis way to safety in a manner whichsimply dazed the Australian1 never saw such a clever man inmy life said Fitz Wednesday evening He got away from me time andagain when I thought I had him deadto rights I knew I could wear himout so 1 kept coming right along untilmy opportunity arrived ne was weakin the last round and all his cleverness could not keep him out of thatleft punch tinder the heart The onlyblow that really worried me was theone which split my lip The others Inever felt He fought fair and hereafter he may have my respect if hecontinues to merit itCorbetts version of his own Waterloo did not vary greatly from FitzsimmonsI made a mistake in not keepingaway was the way the ex championput it Fitz I knew to be a terrificpuncher but I never calculated on hisbeing able to reach me If the sixthraund had lasted ten seconds longer Iwould have landed him to a certaintyHis nose was clogged with blood and hislegs were wobbling The gong sounded just as I was about to himwith my right and end the battle Herecuperated wonderfully and I stayedawaj from him until I thought he wasabout ripe for another drubbing atshort range My neglect in not standing off when he tapped me on thecheek in the fourteenth roundlost me the championship Thatheart punch simply choked meup I could not breathe or move for15 seconds and it was several minutesbefore I realized that I had committeda breach of etiquette in trying to follow up my opponent after he put medu I meant it when 1 said I wouldtbe his friend hereafter He whippedme fair and square but I dont thinkhe is the best man yet and-

third of June the remains ofJohn Loyd were consigned to the graveSquire Hill and his wife and son Clarence were present at the funeral theyhad been with Fannie since the eveningof the 1st having returned on the Sunshine the evening of that dayClara Hill had been too much overcome to attend the funeral as much asshe may have desired to be with FannieMany said that the dead mans betrothed was so much overcome by themurder and the sad death of the manto whom she was so soon to have beenunited that she was completely prostratedShe was completely prostratedheart broken would have been the wordand knew that should she beholdthe face of the dead she wouid not beable to control her emotion not becauseof his death not because of the factthat he had been murdered but becauseof the knowledge that Angus Bruce wasa fugitive from justice for having committed the deed or rather for havingbeen accused of the crime For ClaraHill in her inmost heart did not believeAngus guilty And yet she asked herself how can it be otherwise If Herbert and Fannie caught him in the vervactIf she closed her eyes at night in imagination the dead man lay before heron a snow white couch the sheath knifedriven to its hilt in his breast and theform of Angus bending over him andas he seized the shaft and drew it forththe life blood of the banker followed itdveing all red red with blood Shesaw the look of horror on the featuresof Angus as he turned from the bedside with the reeking weapon clutchedin his hand and with a shriek of blendedhorror and despair she woidd leap toher feet like a frightened deerWhat wonder that she was not presentat the funeral and that her brother Tomremained at Orton to attend her MrsHill desired to remain but Clara insistedon her going knowing that novone elsecould comfort Fannie as could hermotherAnd mother she said bring thepoor stricken dear home to Orton wemust take the place of all that she haslostThe third day after the funeral thefamily were gathered in the spaciousparlor of the residence of the latebanker to listen to the reading of hiswillThere were few comments made bythose present tt AbnorHUl was muchsurprised at the goodly fortune leftHerbert Lathrop and more so at hisbeing designated as administrator ofthe will without bondThis he thought does not comport with what from John Loydswords I should have judged would havebeen his actions however as the willwas drawn two yeaisago he doubtless -since that tilne changed his estimate of Herbert and had drawn no newwill deferring it from time to timeuntil his deathOn the 5th of October Faamie wouldbe 18 years of age and the squire de-termined to keerj an eye on HerbertLathrop until that time then he mustplace her in possession of her inheritance but the bank the bankersmoneys were to be withdrawn fromthat institution and invested iii realtybonds and stocks decidedly Herbert Lathrop must be watched and yetas he had been remembered to the tuneof 50000 perhaps he would deal honestly by FannieIf my friend Loyd had lived another24 hours thought the squire myClara would have been left at least halfof this fortune and I know Loyd wouldhave pref erred to have enriched lier toanyone else Well so it all goes to Fannie and Clarence and Herbert LathropWho knows perhaps Clara may wedhim I cant understand her infatuation for Angus Bruce why yes I canhe saved her life and that fact madehim a hero in her sight I actually believe that she grieved more at thethought of his being a murderer thanbecause o the death of her betrothedWell now that he is a murderer shewill soon get over that infatuationAt the time the will was being readthere was standing just without theopen parlor door a negress She stooda little back from the door facing butwas eagerty bent forward her ears taking in every word of the instrumentread by the lawyer and when the clausewas read leaving Herbert Lathrop 50-000 she clasped her hands together andmuttered to herselfThats why you killed old marsterHerbert Lathrop You feared thatafter he was married he would make anew willAnd further on when the clause wasread making Herbert the administratorof the estate she saidI know enough A nigger cant testify but a nigger can watch and waitand pray Herbert Lathrop I can doall of that and I may do moreThe day after the will was read Fannie returned with the squire and MrsHill to Orton Of course her marriagewith Clarence would now be deferredOne night ten days after Fanniesdeparture Herbert Lathrop was seatedin the late bankers library at a deskexamining his private papers and making plans for the futureFvervthing works smoothlv hesaid as he brought his hand down onhis knee Fifty thousand dollars inWe have warrants for theBrucearrest of Angusnr own -right and the handling of anestate of

Expenditures of ths GovernmentAre Greater Than the ReceiptsCongress is Asked to Promptly Correctthe Existing Condition Ample Revenue Must Be Supplied to Meet Ordinary ExpensesWashington March 16 The presidentMonday sent the following message to congressTo the Congress of the United States Regretting the necessity which has required meto call you together I feel that your assembling in extraordinary session is indispensable because of the condition in which weAnd the revenues of the government 3t isconceded that its current expenditures aregreater than its receipts and thatsuch a condition has existed now forthree years With unlimited meansat our command we are presenting the remarkable spectacle of increasing our publicdebt by borrowing money to meet the ordinary outlays incident upon even an economicaland prudent administration of the government An examination of the subject discloses this fact in every detail and leads inevitably to the conclusion that the condition ofthe revenue which allows it is unjustifiableand should be correctedWe find by the reports of the secretary ofthe treasury that the revenues for the fiscalyear ending June 30 1892 from all sourceswas S42586326022 and the expenditures forall purposes were 41595380656 leaving anexcess of receipts over expenditures of 991445a 6 During the fiscal year S40 570467 93were paid up3n the public debt which hadbeen reduced since March 1 18S9 S2590768S0and the annual interest charge decreased51168457660 The receipts of the government from all sources duringthe fiscal year ending June 30 1893amounted to 46171656194 and its expenditures of 32341674 9 Since that tinje the receipts of no fiscal year and with but few exceptions of no month of any fiscal year haveexceeded the expsnditures The receipts ofthe government from all sources during th6fiscal year ending June 2D 1894 were49329 and its expenditures 44260575887leaving a deficit the first since the resumption of specie payments of 56980326058Notwithstanding there was a decrease of1676912878 in the ordinary expenses of thegovernment as compared with the previousfiscal year it income was still not sufficientto provide for its daily necessities and thegold reserve in the treasury for the redemption of greenbacks was drawn upon to meettbem But this did not suffice andthe government then resorted to loans to replenish thereserveIn February 1894 350003ODO in bonds wereissued and in November following a secondissue of 50000000 was deemed necessaryThe sum of 8117171795 was realized by thesale of these bonds but the reserve wassteadily decreased until on February 8 1835a third sale of 562315400 in bonds for 65115-244 was announced to CongressThe receipts of the government for the fiscal year ending June 83 1895 were 390373-20330 and the expenditures 13347842648showing a deficit of 24280522a ia A furtherloan of 5100000000 was negotiated by the government in February 1896 the sale netting111166246 and swelling the aggregate ofbonds issued within three years to 262315400 For the fiscal year ending Juue 30 1896the revenues of the government from allsources amounted to 540947540878expenditures were 434678654

expenditures Norhas this condition since improved For thefirst half of the present fiscal year the receipts of the government exclusive of postalrevenues were 15750760176 and its expenditures exclusive of postal service 519341000022or an excess of expenditures over rec eipts of3790239646In January of this year the receipts exclusive of postal revenues were 2431699405 andthe expenditures exclusive of postal service3026928929 a deficit of 595230324 for themonth In February of this year the receiptsexclusive of postal revenue were 2443099738and the expenditures exclusive of postal service 2879605666 a deficit of439505928 or a total deficiencyof 18606158044 for the three yearsand eight months ending March 1 1897Not only are we without a surplus in thetreasury but with an increase in the publicdebt there has been a corresponding increasein the annual interest charge from 22S9388120 in 1892 the lowest of any year since 1862to 33438729760 in 1S96 or an increase of 1149341440It may be urged thateven if the revenues ofthe government had been sufficient to meetall its ordinary expenses during the pastthree years the gold reserve would stilihave been insufficient to meet the demands upon it and that bonds wouldnecessarily have been issued for its repletionBe this as it may it is clearly manifest without denying or affirming the correctness ofsuch a conclusion that tho debt would havobeen decreased in at least the amount of thodeficiency and business confidence immeasurably strengthened throughout the countryCongress should promptly correct the existing condition Ample revenue must be supplied not only for the ordinary expenses otthe government but for the prompt paymentof liberal pensions and the liquidation ofthe principal and interest of the public debtIn raising revenues dutiesshould be so leviedupon foreign proaucts as to preserve thehome market so far as possible to our ownproducers to revive end increase manufactures to relieve and encourajre agricultureto increase our foreign and domestic commerce to aid and develop mining and buildingand to render to labor in every field of usefuloccupation the liberal wares and adequate rewards to which skill and industry are justlyentitled The necessity of the passage of atariff law which shall provide ample revenueneed not be further urged The Imperative demand of tho hour is theprompt enactment of such a measureand to this object I earnestlyrecommend that congress snail make everyendeavor Before other business is transacted let us first provide sufficient reverue

IN COUETSHIRThere was a report circulated amongthe gossips of the settlement that Hezeitih Burnet was courting- Maria TillyIn fact the report had grown to he almost a leg end since many of the gossips had passed to the further side andothers had turned gray in the 20 yearsthat had elapsed since Hezekiah andMaria had first begun keeping company and the news of it started tocirculate around the neighborhoodIn those days Hezekiah had been alean lank loose jointed bare leggedireckle faccd lad driving his fatherslog wagon and Maria had been a slimslip of a girl milking her mothers cowsand helping her brother with the cottondropping in the spring choppingin the summer and picking in thefallYes jig doubt Hczekiahs liking f orMaria had begun at that period of hiscallow youth and in the soft springdays of early dropping time Perhaps the fact that the way from thedeep wine woods to his fathers ricketylumber mill lay past the little Tillyfarm had something to do with thiscrude awakening of the tender passionin Hezekialrs tender heart in just thatparticular direction At all events ittranspired that during that seasonHezekiah managed to make mere tripsin a day than ever before and that somehow or other the heavy ruts of his bigwagon wheels ran suspiciously close tothe straggling tumble down TillyfenceIt was one early morning as Hezekiah was making his first trip for theday that he had seen Maria with a bluesun bonnet on her head and a narrowfchort skirted blue and white checkedfrock treading slowly up and down thecrumbly brown rows dropping cottonseed So sliding down from his precarious seat on the long wagon poleHezekiah had cracked his long whip atthe lazy oxen to urge them up the lanealone leaned his lank elbows in theirJblue striped sleeves on the top of therickety rail fence for a moment andsaid as the girl came up close to himBetter lemme drap a row fur youTaaDont keer ef I do Kiah she hadanswered flipping one gray iinty seedfrom her handful up into his grinningfreckled faceThen Mviah had put his two bigfreckled hands on the top rail of thefence and swung himself clear of thetangle of vines and weeds in the corner down beside the girl as she stoodankle deep in the mellow earth andside by side they had marched to theend of the rows in silenceLook like them oxens goin powerful fas aint they Ria he had saidwhen they reached the other side of the- Dont know but what they is Iviahthe girl had answered peering throughthe fence cracks at the receding wagonas the oxen swung slowly on up thehillShe was still peering when Kiah overtook the team by and by but when hecracked his whip and turned back tolook down the lane Kiah ducked herhead among the weeds and waited tillthe Apgon was out of sightBy the time the cotton was up and hadbegun to show its little thick roundfleshy leaves in green straggly linesalong tlie crest of the brown rows Uiahad grown to look for Kiahs wagon asit crept slowly up the lane in the earlymorning and to count upon his liftwith her chopping and hoeing timebrought him still with increasing regularityBut after awhile when the long- summer days stretched and hardened thetender green plant into the hardy stalkand the cotton was laid by to waitthe blossom time and the swelling andthe bursting of the balls Kiah lookedin vain for Ilias blue sun bonnetedhead among the tangle of dewy morning glories in the field The first weekdragged away heavily and his fathersscolding- at the mill over the scant pileof logs that told his task made it seemall the heavier But Sunday afternooncame at length and found Kiah attired in a freshly washed shirt muchtoo large and blue cottonade trousersmuch too short sitting on the steps ofthe Tillys rickety back gallery eatingpeaches with the boys Ilias brothersIke3r and Mose and Pete As for Kiasself she sat beside her mother on a little narrow sagging bench under thewater shelf feeling shv without her sunbonnet and her hoe Between frequentdippings and frequent spittings thatyit the summer air with keen resonancein her effort to steer clear of the littlechicken trough that sprawled in asoggy pool in the yard below Mrs Tillykept conversation going asking Kiahhow his ma was if she had put off manychickens anddid the minks and hawkspester much up his way Once duringthe afternoon Mviah ventured to peel apeach that seemed bigger and betterthan the rest and handed it drippingand juicy on the broad blade of hisknife to Bini Dont you want this here one Biahe asked blushing all over his broadfreckled faceDont keer ef I do Kiah the girlhad said and she ate the peach tentatively looking- away oft across the fieldsto the blue smirch of distant pine treesbeyondWell the next Sunday and the nextfound Kiah eating peaches with thehoys on the Tillys back gallery and soim for every Sunday thereafter till thefields were white and cotton picking-commenced Then though he saw Biaevery day and helped along mightilySyith hisbigr hands in Tilling the longicotton sack that trailed behind hertQbstrapped to her frail shoulders by thattime had gotten used to going to see theboys on Sunday and during the falland winter would sit with them aroundthe fire peeling sugar cane for Bia orshelling great handfuls of goobersthat browned and parched amid theashes on the wide hearth Mrs Tillystill manipulated the conversation between dips having much ado to spitclear of the andirons into the bank ofashes that climbed up in the chimneycornerThus had passed the first year ofKiahs courtship and in all the 20 ofthem that followed the gossips had beenable to detect no difference The onlychange had been perhaps that Kiahhimself had grown bigger and broaderand more shambling in his gait thefreckles on his face were hidden by thesandy beard that straggled over it likeweeds in a neglected fence corner afterthe fall frosts but nothing could hidethe blush that mounted to his cheekthe same now as it had done that firstSunday afternoon when he peeled thefirst peach for Bia Asf or the girl herself she had grown a little taller and alittlemore slender perhaps there was ashade more wistf ulness in her blue eyeswhen she looked across the fields to thesmirch of pine hills beyond perharjssometimes there was a touch of asperity in her voice when she saidDont keer ef I do Tviah but that wasabout allMrs Tilly still dipped and talked andspat clear of the chicken trough or thedog irons as of yore But of t1e boysIkev onlv was left Mose and Pete hadmarried and lived with their wivespeople down the creek and this ofcourse had left more work for Bia todo helping her mother indoors andlkey out Perhaps this last had something to do with Kiahs increased energy in log hauling for though theyears went by he was still at the sameold bovs businessThe gossijis who always knew morethan other people said it was a downright shame that old man Burnet hadnever given Kiah a chance to do something for himselfThe ol man mought a give Kiah astrip er Ian an a mule an a cow anyhow an sorter let the boy a felt hehad some chanst to start with a littlescrap er sump nother to call his ownHits dog mean er ol Burnet to keep thebov under like he done This is whatone of the most highly respected gossiis had been heard to remark whereupon another of the same ilk thoughnext in rank had saidLeastwise the ol man mought aup an died at a decent age fur he mustbe turned er 70 an lef Kiah his ownman Jfo all the pith o youth is sappedouten them big lcose jintcd bones erhisnSometimes I gits out er all patiencewith Kiah a not standin up fur hisown sef mo then I reckon taint beholden er me to judge him when themas ought to aint never gin him no encouragementThatso we all know Kiahs a goodboy nain better in the settlement andmaybe so if Bia had a been a little modemandin of him Kiah hed a beena little more respondm JT any ratehit would have pestered me fourth Sunday after fourth Sunday these 20 yearswhen church raeetin was over an Kiahwould come up an ax Biah ef so be ashe mought glong home with her tohear the gal say in that same onexpectintone o hern Dont keer ef you doKiahYesm thats so but maybe Bia aintlost nothin by not bein forward an tooexpect in Hits wuth sumpn to a galnowadays to keep her dig nity an Biacertnly is proud Pity some er the other vounger ones wasnt er little less forwarder than what Kiah and Bia isThas so an they do say that Kiahhad the strenk to stan agin his fatherone timeYou dont savYesm Seems sef the ol man had amin to hire a boy to drive the log wagonan meant Kiah to stay round the millan run one er the rip saws But thenan thar Kiah made th stan Git whoyou please to hep at the mill pa he-says but as fur me I drives the logwagonYou dont sayYes but in course Kiah kep to the logwagon case the road lay by the Tillyplace an he could contrivate to see Biaan hip her out with the fieP workIt is true that the gossips further related that old man Burnet himself hadsaid Kiah had refused to accept theelevation from log hauler to rip sawyerbecause the boy was too dog gone lazyto drive ducks to water but as it requires no effort even for a lazy man todrive ducks to water and there is nosimilarity between that occupation andrunnig a rip saw in the sole mill of a-I pretty good sized settlement it is possible that the gossips were right intheir assumxitiou of Kiahs reason forrefusing the elevation If he had nothing better to offer Bia than he dailyhelp of his two big hands at least thatcounted for something in the meagersum of her years toilWell in all the 20 years of its lagging process there had been in theneighborhood nothing more excitingfor the gossips to talk over than Kiahscourtship But suddenly a faint edhofrom the world outside became vibrantin the slack atmosphere of the littlesettlement One little1 linger as it wereot life and civilization seemed pointingtoward the neighborhood tilling its inhabitants full of vague apprehensivelongings that by and by the whole landwould reach out and drag them and thelittle settlement out into the greatworld itselfKarly one morning some one had seensurveyors with instruments and chaintaking mysterious bearings of the settlement from the hilltops that surrounded it That Mas the first ominouspointing of the finger and by apd bycame men on horseback who wanted toknow about the pine lands on the hillsides and the cypress lands in theswamps and before the sleepy littlesettlement had fully awakened to whattTHE BOUKBOtf NJiWSKlDAY MARCH 19 1897-- V - -was happening the gossips heard thaia railroad was coming jTo be sure it was not to be much ofroad only a little tap to the line 20miles above to haul away from ibhelend gone villages of the east whosefather had long ago been adventurousenough to set out in search of Californiagold and who had got on his journeyas far west as the pine hills of Louisiana where he had had the forethoughtto preempt a section of land and -thelack of thought to go back cast immediately thereafter Perhaps the coming of the little railroad through hisland meant a great deal to the poor sonof the poor man who had entered ityears ago and perhaps it meant moreto the land agent who had the handlingof it for its ownerBy the right of assumption tliis sameland agent had come to be a power inthe neighborhood and when he laid offa town site upon the eastern mans landso that the little settlement was leftas a sort of straggling suburb theretothe people felt as if the great world hadcome and sat down beside them insteadof dragging them out to itselfIn the new town there was to be astation and a hotel and a post officeThere even came to be vague whisperings that at the next term of court thesettlement would go down to Sparta ina body and cast its vote for the courthouse to be moved to the new townrather than to Gibbs or Arcadia Thispatriotic sentiment grew as the newtown grew There was something inspiring about the sound of saw and hammer and the blow of red paint on thelittle squat station The women didlittle else but gab and gossip and themen either laid off work in a body ortook turn about in watching the progress of the building over at New Townreporting to the rest of the settlementafter nightfallAll of this stir and excitement hadits effect upon Kiah and Bia along withthe rest With all the lumber neededBurnets mill was kept busy from daylight until dark and Kiah found notime to slip down from his wagon andgive Bia a lift with the late cotton picking Perhaps that is why he stayedlonger than usual one Sunday afternoon when he went to see Bia and talkto lkey and Mrs Tilly He stayed solong in fact that Mrs Tilly having exhausted her usual flow of conversationsuccumbed under the soporific influenceof her steady dipping and fell asleepin the chimney corner He stayed solong that lkey who had slipped out theback door saddled his mule and riddenaway came back at dusk to find himstill sitting and shelling peanutsBeen over to New Town said Ikefvin a hoarse whisper lest he should

againstforcing- at all and this prejudice is notwithout foundation as the prematuredeath of some cows that have beenforced Tip to the limit testifies It isargued that this high feeding weakensthe

weredescended from the samecow the question arises What makesthe difference Breed is answeredBut breed is after all only generationsof feed and care so we find that it isby this same forcing- in feeding that thecow has been brought up from a yieldof three pounds of butter to a yield of15 In other words the 15 pound cowhas had her organs developed so thatshe will turn a larger quantity of feedinto butter than will the cow whose ancestors have not received this extracare This forcing not only makes thecow receiving this treatment give moremilk btit by reason of her developmenther calves are able to give more milkNow the question arises How farmay Ave go with the forcing processWe force one cow and by reason of theforcing her calf can stand more forcing-than she could or the calf has greater capacity for turning- feed into butter than had her mother and if she isforced her calf in turn has a still greater capacityIt is not hard to remember when ahorse was fast that could go at a240 gait but now we are gettingmighty close to a 200 gait andwe cannot say that the limit has beenyet reached So it seems reasonable tosuppose that the limit of milk production in a cow has not yet been reachedand if occasionally a cow that has nota good constitution is somewhat hurtby overfeeding yet it is by forcingthat we can hope to increase the milkproducing cajacity of the cow to itsfullest extent National StockmanCARE OF DAIRY HERDPalatalility of Feed Has Mticli to DoAvitJx the MiJlc Flow -The feed must be sound We cannot feed musty moldy hay or decayedfeed and keep the cows sjstem in orderand produce perfect milk I have hadtrouble from feeding moldy hay fromtop of stack and bottom of mowsfrom feeding moldy ground feed andalso from feeding decayed silage saysMr Gurler Many dairymen exposetoo jnuch surface at one time in theirsilos so much that they cannot keepahead of decay In constructing a siloplan to have no more than eigiit surface feet per cow to be fed exposed atonce Make the compartments of suchsize that this object will be securedOne point we must be always lookingafter is palatability We cannot expectu cow to do profitable work with foodthat she does not like or relish Wecan by neglecting this matter secureno profit from cows that would withproper treatment produce 300 poundsof butter per annum There does notj year iiass that I do not have thispoint impressed upon my mind by myown experience and also bj the experience of many of my patrons Theaverage dairyman does not commencecutting his hay as early as he oughtneither does he cut his corn as earljas he should to secure the best resultsWe should not blame the cow for ourmistakes neither for our ignoranceIf we do not know how to feed andcare for her intelligently let us learnIf Ave know how and do not do it wedeserve to be kicked by the cow untilwe promise tc do as well as we knowWestern PlowmanGOOD BUTTER CARRIERJust the Thinp for Dairymen WhoHave Private CustomersMany dairymen either put up theirpound prints in the form of brickswrapped in parchment paper or in abroader flatter rectangular form withquarter pound divisions marked off init These are difficult to lift out of abox when once packed snugly in it Ahandy plan is shown in the sketch ThelilllJfti mHANDY- BUTTER CARRIERbox opens at the side and has shelvesto slide in and out Each shelf has arectangular opening in the center sothat when the row of bricks is laidabout the opening the edge of eachbrick will project a little over the opening One can thus lift out a pound ofbutter easily because he can get hisfingers beneath it A shelf can thus beremoved from the box and carried toxhe customers door and the customerallowed to pick up the number ofpounds desired It is best for theseller not to handle the butter at all inthe presence of the customer eventhough it be paper covered OrangeJudd FarmerSome of the Japanese plums arenoted for their purplish foliage in thefall besides that they appear to be

be-utilized for both pleasure and profit inthe winter Such utilization moreoverwould entail no great expense outsideof the small amount of home carpentering that would be required There aretwo or three points to be consideredwhen making a piaut room of a piazzaFirst as to -floors The ordinary piazza has no tigiit underpinning to keepout the cold Usually it has only lattice work while the floor also is usually more or less open It would be nogreat trouble to lay a new matchedfloor over the few feet of space to beoccupied by the plant room Thenjj 33331SBWnriTfnrniA PIAZZA GREENHOUSEcover the lattice work around the baseof the -piazza with heavy resin sized ortarred building paper tacking it tightly and bank with evergreen brushNow as to the outer walls The greaternart must of course be of glass but itis not advisable to have the sash extend to the iloor Prom the piazza raildown let the wall be of matched boarding Along the front this should bescrewed to the inside of the rail Sashto fit any opening can now be boughtvery cheap It is desirable that communication with this plant room befrom a living room rather than by ahall door so it may be found desirableto cut down a window and make a doorof it This will obviate the necessityof having a door in the outside temporary petitionsThe heating of such a plant room canbe done in a number of ways but thesimplest and most satisfactory for theaverage farmhouse will probably be bythe use of an oil stove These little sitting-roomoil heaters have been sogreatly improved and made so reasonable in price that they will be foundwonderfully convenient for just suchuse as this Care should be takenhowever to get a make in which theflame wiil not crawl up and smokeif left by itself The accompanying illustration gives a suggestion as to themaking of a plant room upon a piazzaOf course piazzas differ in shape butthe same principle of treatment willapply to nearly all cases Make all astight as possible then an oil stove wiilgive sufficient heat to keep the plants inhealthJudd ParmerSMALL FRUIT CULTUREHow to Secure an Ample Supply olTiee Berries for Home UseM A Thayer of Sparta Wiswrites the Western Plowman as follows Mature

RAILROADOriginated in a Coal Mine and Wasa Crmle AffairThe primitive railway appears to havebeen the product of the coal mines inGreat Britain History records that inthe early part of the sixteenth centuryrails of timber were laid at the collieriesnear over whichby means of bulky carts provided withrollers one horse could draw four orfive tons Por fully 200 years the useof these rude railroads was confined tothe collieries Improvements developedslowly The first change was in securing the wooden rails by means ofpegs to cross ties w sleepers placedtwo or three feet apart The rails weresix inches high and six inches broadOn top of each rail a strip of hard woodwas fastened which could be renewedwhenever occasion warranted withoutdisturbing the remainder of the structurePlat iron bars were first substitutedfor this temporary strip of wood in173S and about 30 years later cast ironbars were forged for that purposeThese cast iron bars were each five feetlong four inches wide and one andthree quarter inches thick with holesfor spikes to secure them to the wroodToward the close of the eighteenth century the practice was adopted of casting the rails with a perpendicular ledgeon the outer edge to prevent the wheelsfrom leaving the track Subsequentlythe ledge was transferred to the innerside of the railIt was not until 1789 that the presenttype of rail and car wheel appearedPlanged rails and flat wheels were discarded and the flange transferred tothe tire of the wheels Mr Jesup introduced at that period rails cast inlengths of 15 feet with the top 1inches wide They were of the fishbelly pattern deeper in the middle thanat the ends After various experimentsit was found advisable to set the endsof the rails in cast iron chairs whichwere bolted to the wooden or stoneties and into which secured by a keyor wedges Cast iron however provedto be too brittle for the passage ofheavy loads at high rates of speed andabout the year 1820 malleable iron wassubstituted and the length of the railswas increasedThe idea of using steam as a motivepower on the tramways in the Englishcollieries was first broached by JamesWatt in 1784 when he applied for apatent for a steam carriage In 1804Richard Trevethick built a locomotiveengine which was tried upon the Merthyr Tydvil railway in Wales andwhich drew wagons containing ten tonsof coal each at a rate of five miles anhour W Hassell WTilson in his Bailway History says that in 1S12 Blenkinsops engines began running betweenMiddleton collieries and Leeds a distance of 3 miles and continued inuse for several years being- the first instance of the regular employment- ofsteam locomotives for commercial purposes It was in 1S14 that George Stephensons first steam engine was placedon the Killing worth railway It drew30 tons at the -rate of four miles an hourmpon an incline of one foot in 450 Improvements in locomotives followedgradually When -the Stockton Darlington railway was opened for publicuse in 1S25 one of Stephensons locomotives drew a train composed of 22wagons filled with passengers and 12wagons loaded with coal making a total weight of about 90 tons includingthe engine and tender at an averagespeed of about five miles an hour butattaining a maximum rate of Vi milesX Y TimesDRIFTS FOR SIX YEARSIteiuarlcalile Voyage of a Derelict ohtlie AtlanticAfter a career unparalleled in
