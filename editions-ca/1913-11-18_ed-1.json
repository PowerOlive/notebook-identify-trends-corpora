places where the band could play on
that date -which they have open, 'Mr.
Martin feels' that the very evident
appreciation shown when the band
played here earlier in the season, de
serves recognition, and the people of
Paris and viciijity are to have first
choice of the date. Rudolph Davisi
was so pleased with the band when
they were here before that he has
agreed to assist R. E. Shea & Co. to
circulate a subscription list for tickets
in order to assure Mr. Ellery that it
will be worth while to stop here. Tke
