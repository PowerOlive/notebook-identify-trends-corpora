The use of the surgeons knife is becoming-
so general resulting fatally
in such a large number of cases as to
occasion general alarm
r William Walpole of Walshtown
South Dakota writes About
three years ago there came under
my left eye a little blotch about the
size ox a smdu jjcu
It grew rapidlyand
shooting pains ran
in every direction
I became alarmed
and consulted a
good doctor who
pronounced it can
cer and said that it
must be cut out
This I would not
consent to having
little faith in the
indiscriminate useof the knife Read
ing of the many cures made by S S
S I determined to give that medicine
a trial and after I had taken it a few
days the cancer became irritated and
began to discharge This after awhile
ceased leaving a small scab -which
finally dropped off and only a healthy
little scar remained to mark the place
-where the destroyer had held full sway
