IMPORTANCE OF HEALTHY
KIDNEYS.
Paris Readers Should Learn to Keep
the Kidneys WeK,
The kidneys have a big work to do.,- iy
All the blood in the body is coursing ,
through the kidneys constantly to be- v
freed of poisonous matter. It is a
heavy enough task when the kidneys
are Well, but cold, chill, fever or
some thoughtless exposure is likely
to irritate, inflame and congest the
kidneys and .interrupt the purifying -'
work.
Then the aching .frequently begins
and is often accompanied by some ir
regularity of th j urine too frequent
passages, sediment or retention. .
Thousands testify to the wonderful
merit of Doan's Kidney Pills, a rem-
edy for the kidneys only, that has ,
been used in kidney troubles 50 years.
You will make no mistake in follow
ing this Paris citizen's advice. ,
Mrs. Ida Huffman, 115 Man street,
Paris, Ky., says: "We think Doan's w
Kidney Pills are just fine. We will- , t
ingly confirm the statement we gave i
some years ago recommending them.
I suffered from pains across the small
of my back. Seeing Doan's Kidney
Pills advertised, I got a supply at
Wilson's Drug Store and gave them
a trial. I was very much pleased
with the results."
