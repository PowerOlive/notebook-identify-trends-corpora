Leading domestic science expertshave endorsed it. Thousands of women are using it and recommending it to their friends.. If you are not familiar with the RED STAR and its "gas range" principle, go to your dealer and have him demonstrate it toyou.x See how it positively ends failures in cooking and how it enables you to enjoy all the advantages of a city gas range.Mr. Depeel and his cook will be here to-day, Friday, April 22, to give us something good to eat. - .A.

The speaker said, however, that he was of theopinion that the educational outlookin Kentucky is improving.. oHogs will not be permitted to runabout the streets of any incorporatedtown or city in Kentucky this summer and they may be kept in townsonly where the space and cleanlinessconstantly maintained are sufficientto prevent offensive odors or otherconditions dangerous to health, Dr.A.
