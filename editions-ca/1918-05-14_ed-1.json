Keep These Hands
of Mercy, at WoA
DID you ever lay in No Man's Land wih a shattered thigh
and a throat that burned withv thirst? If you had you'd
give to Red Cross "till it hurts.' 'j
Did you ever see a little French child of the war sitting by
the roadside, sobbing quietly because she is too' weak to cry very
loud? If you had you would have -sold your watch to buy her
food and clothes. "
But you are not there. You are here where these sights
and sounds are not brought home to you. But your Red Cross is
there-and you can help it. $100,000,000 must be raised in one week.
"Keep these hands of mercy at work!" The money you give
to Red Cross now will give you-the right to say "There are
happy children, joyous mothers and strong men alive today because
my money went across." Millions of loyal Americans will pledge
a part of their earnings during June, July, August and September.
