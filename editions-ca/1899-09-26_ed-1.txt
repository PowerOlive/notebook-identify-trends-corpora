tothe same control inspection supervision and regulation as the domesticcorporation of that state and subjectto be revocable if the conditions thereof are violated4 The enactment of state legislation declaring that a corporation created in one state to do business exclusively in other states than where created shall be prohibited from admission into any stateThis proposition is supported bydecisions of the supreme courts of several states but we believe it shouldbecome legislative enactment uniformthroughout the states5 That no comoration should be1formed in whole or in part by any corrjorationa6 That no corporation shall ownor hold any stock in another corporation ensraged in a similar orive business and that no officer or theowner of stock of another corporationengaged in a similar or eompetive business the object or result of which isto create a trust or monopoly7 Recognizing that trusts are usually composed of corporations and thatjcorporations are but creatures of thelaw and can only exist in the place oftheir creation and can not migrate toanother sovereignty without the consent of that sovereignt and that thisconsent may be withheld when desired we recommend as the sense of thisconference that each stat pass lawsproviding that no corporation which isa m ember of any pool or trust in thatstate or elsewhere can do business inthat stateResolved That it is the sense ofthis conference that all the capitalstock of private corporations shouldbe fully paid either first in lawfulmoney or second in property of theactual cash value of the amount of thecapital

be commanded bymajor generals The Philippinesheretofore havethe departmentIt is expectedment of thebeen known asof the Pacificthat one depart-proposed newdivision will consist of Gen MacArthurs command north of Manila another will be Gen Lawtons commandsouth of Manila and a third will be anew command to operate from Lingayen or Dagupen A fourth department probably will consist of troops inthe islands south of Manila which include the commands now at IloiloCebu and other pointsThe scheme has not yet taken suchdefinite form as to determine the commands of the division and departments There is no doubt however thatLawton and MacArthur will remainwhere they now are and probably thecommand in the islands south will beunder a brigadier general Anotherofficer will have to be selected for thedepartment in the far northern part ofthe island at the terminus of the Dagupen railroadThe plan is to give each departmentcommander all the troops that can besuccessfully operated and also

for it Secrecy was to be observed Mr Livingston refused to offermore than 30000000 francs and asserted that he had no power to treat for thocession of the entire provinceIt was supposed at that time that instructions were irsued to our ministersthat the treaty of cession by Spain toFrance included the entire province ofLouisiana and the Floridas but it wasfound shortly afterward that it cededLouisiana only If France declined tosell our ministers were to open negotiations with Great Britain so as toprevent France from taking possessionof the province M Barbe Morboismarquis of Barbe

personallyknown to Mr MonroeMr Monroe arrived April 12 1803 MMorbois the next day asked immediate action After consultation thtwo ministers on behalf of the UnitedStates offered France 50000000 francswith an offset in the shape of suckclaims in favor of citizens of the UnitedStates against France as should be established estimated at from 20000000to 25000000 francs This was declinedThe

30 1803 whenFrance in three separate treaties cededto tliis republic the territory of Louisiana and that event has become knownin history as The Louisiana PurchaseThe story of this historic occurrenceforms one of the most important andinteresting chapters in our national historyIt is very exhaustively treated of inthat remarkable book The Public Domain published under the authorityf the United States and compiled byThomas Donaldson a man of marvelousresearch Pie devotes many pages toan exhaustive history of the buvinerfrom France of the vast province ofLouisiana He epitomizes the eventsprogressively leading to the colonization of that part of the province whichis now the city of New Orleans as followsIn 1541 De Soto reached the Mississippi riverIn 1673 Father Marquette descendedthe Mississippi to its mouthIn 1G80 La Salle descended the Mississippi river and took possession of thecountry adjacent to it in the name ofLouis XIV of France and called itLouisianaIn 1699 Lemoine dTberville foundedthe first colony at Biloxi but dying soonafter Henilie took commandIn 1706 thes colonists made a new location on the site of what is now theity of New OrleansIn 1712

December 151602 notified the congress of the cession of Louisiana to France and of thesction of the Spanish authorities atNew Orleans Excitement ensued inthe congress but finally President Jefferson

Paris to treatwith France for the cession of New OrieET and the island of New Orleans andFloridaMr Livingston held to the opinion atthat time that the United States wouldnever be able to acquire New Orleansby treaty or purchase and that it oughtto be taken at once by force Mr Monroe upon arrival in France foundBonaparte meditating on and in dangerof a rupture with Great Britain Justbefore his arrival M Talleyrand hadrequested Mr Livingston to make an offer cm behalf of the United States forthe province of Louisiana entire Thisw an authority he did not possessTie intention of the United

citizens of thUnited States if they should amountto so muchIt is said that when Bonaparte gaveinstructions to M Marbois in regaidto the cession he stated that from thenature of the new combination formingagainst him in Europe he was forcedto sell the entire province or hold itat a great sacrifice of men and moneyand probably be compelled to see itcaptured He preferred to transfer itto the United States adding that whatever nation held the valley of the Mississippi would eventually be the mostpowerful on earth and that consequently he preferred a friendly nation shouldpossess it rather than an enemy oiFranceThe cession was made in three separate treaties on April 30 1803 Firsta treaty of cession next a conventionstipulating method manner and timeof payment of the purchase moneyand last a convention providing thatclaims of citizens of the United Statesagainst France were to be paid at theUnited States treasury o the amountof 3750000 on orders from the minister of the United States to Francewhich were to be given on the jointjudgment or conclusion of the Frenchbureau to which these claims were referred and a board of three commissioners on behalf of the United Statesfinal

join me andafter supper we diced together for an hourof so for very small points He was aninfant at the game and 1 taught him A gooddeal so much bo that after a little practice for he was very quick with his wristhe mastered my favorite throw and oneevening after returning from the Vaticanhe knocked me up in my rooms and flungon the table a bag of gold piecesThree hundred of them cavalierc heaid 1 won them from Pabrudo Colonnawho is looking green with rage If yourpurse is running short they are at yourservice Ha I see a flask of Orvieto may1 and he poured himself out a gobfctat which lie began to sip in apparent defiance of his vvThe devil I exclaimed but jou areflying at high stakes chevalier Youriicard estates must be broad Thanks allthe same for your olier but my purse is asfull as I want it at presentlie leaned back in his chair with a pinkflush on his delicate features1 meant no offense cavalierc but whath the use of money unless one can shareit with a friendThere was no offense taicen St Armande I replied and if you will takenone I would like to have my say at youHe looped one finger in his golden mustache and showed his even teeth in hissmile as he saidSpeak onThen chevalier it seems to me a thousand pities that a joung man like youwould waste your tiara here as you appearto be doing I understood you to say youhad jieer seen a eword drawn in earliestas yet and your mustache is grown Takemy advice Play 10 more for gold piecesvith Colonna or anyone else Mount yourhorse and join Tremouille at onceAh that is goo 1 he said and whydoes the grave and reverend CavaliercDonati waste his time here hanging at theheels of a churchman and moping o nigiitslike an owl on a ruined wall instead of stirring the tunes himself with the point of hishwordWith any other I would have been annoyed with the youth before me I wav jmf0m Li J -He was an Infant at the gameslightly amused and at the same time atrifle surprised Hitherto he had appearedso shy aud reserved and now of a sudden he had thrown this off and had puton an air which 1 had not noticed beforebut whih became him vastly I set itdown to the fact that perhaps he wasslightly warmed with wine having apparonlb absolved himself from his vow although ol course 1 did not appear to noticethis East as he was in a manner my guest1 therefor made replyiv reasons for my action chevalier aregcxl and when the time comes I promiseToil r shall not be found sleepingThe gentle reproof in my words seemedto bring him back to his old self for by thelight of the candles i observed him flush scarlet and that curious look which recalledst ram resemblance to some one 1 knewbut could not remember came over his features 1 began to relent as 1 saw his confusionI had spoken andfusion almost as soon asadded 1 may say that the time is not fardistant- that it is a matter of days onlyTake me with youHe Scd this almost in a tone of enkreatv keeping his eyes wajr from mehowever and nervously tsting at

and he raised his glass to hislipsAfter that he retired it being late 1 sawhim across the courtyard as far as his apartments and then returning to my roomsunconsciously took the chair St Armandehad vacated The goblet of wine he hadhiled was before me and I idly lifted it inmy hand It was barely touched In facthe could but have tasted a few drops onlyLike lightning a suspicion of treacherycame on me The man had been pretendingto drink ith what object I could notmake out as th offer of the money ablind Perhaps so and if then I hadbeen a fool to agree to his joining me withthat sour looking abbe of his Yes I hadbeen a fool but it was lucky I discoveredmy own folly in time 1 should keep myeyes on this silken diplomat and if necessary pick a quarrel with him and run himthrough Somehow 1 did not like the ideaol this however but determined to getrid of him in one way or the other 1 wouidallow nothing to stand between me and theroad back to honor So musing I sat fora half hour or so and was startled by Jacopos sudden entry so lost was 1 in thoughtHe came and stood bolt upright next tomy chair without saying a word I knewfrom this that he had some request tomake some favor to ask as otherwise hewould not have hesitated to make play withhis tongue at onceWhat is it JacopoHe shifted uneasily from one foot to theother and then repliedYour excellency I want leaveLeave What fc r You are not goingto be married are youHeaven aud the saints forbid excellency Xo no it is not that it is onlyleave for 1 he day I want and also for ourmenThe devil What are you going to doOnly a little dinner excellency which Iam givingAnd wasting those crowns you got theother day Well that is your affair notmine Yis you can have the leaveA hundred thanks excellencyMind you there must be no brawlingno troubleExcellencyWell good night and remember whatI say Here you may remove this winecup as you goTood night signore and Jacopo liftingthe goblet went out The night being airlya arm I kept my door open and as he passedinto the portico I saw him drain tiie contents of the goblet with a gulp and heardhiri draw his lips t ether with a smackof approval and march off to his quarterschuckling at something or otherThe following afternoon I rode out withBayard end half a dozen others It wasa hawking party and there was a long gallop to our point of operation which was tobegin a little way beyond Poute Moile Ina short tune we started a noble heron andiJayard dinging his peregrine into the airwe rode alter the birds It was a gloriousride and Castor and Pollux far outstrippedthe others so much so that when we drewrein beside the stricken heron and Bayardslipped tiie hood onto his hawk oar companions were not in sight This howevertroubled us little and turning rein we madebackwards On our way back I seized theopportunity to mention to Bayard that StArmande had volunteered to aid me in mytask and that I had accepted his offerIt will do him good he said he seemsa noble youth who has been tied too loneto apronstringsDo you think so I said he strikesme as being effeminate to a degree and yetI cannot help liking himlie has a wonderful pure mind saidLayard the boy for he is no less is asinnocent as a childThe Vatican will not improve him thenespecially if he plays for gold crowns withColonnaPlays for gold crowns exclaimed Bayard you are surely mistaken cavalicreDid he not do so last night my lord 1understood he won three hundred off FabriioImpossible said Bayard I was at theVatican last night and the party in whichColonna was playing consisted of StrigqniaMgr Florido our lord the pope and Colonna himself no more St Armande wasstanding hard at hand for some little timebut never took a wager In fact he passedmost of the evening with Giulia Bellathrumming on a lute much to the annoyance of his holiness I should say it wouldbe well for him to quit RomeThen i aft wrong I said yes I fancyit would be well for him to quit RomeBy this time the others came up and wesaid no more As we went back to Rome1 dropped a little behind reflecting onwhat Bayard had told me I was certainthat St Armande had bed to me and Ibegan to feel sure he had done this not formy good In short it seemed to me thatthis innocent looking boy with his shy retiring manners and apparent want ofknowledge of the world was nothing morenor less than an accomplished actor Thenagain he was a Frenchman and how camehe obviously fresh from France to becomean agent of the Medici plotters for so Iput him down to be There were the letters from Mine de la Tremouille hia introductions were unimpeachable the cardinalbelieved in him the whole thing was contradictor-Above all there was my strongpersonal liking for St Armande In hisPesence 1 never felt that secret warningvhich all men feel when they are with anenemy I have never known it fail withme and with St Armande there was nosuch warning no such silent signal whichgoes straight from sou to soul On thecontrary 1 felt he was almost more thanfriendly towards me and I felt in my turntowards him despite our short acquaintancevery nearly the same protective feeling thatone has towards a defenseless child Asmay be imagined I was in no very comfortable frame of mind about this and rodehack silently revolving the point Whenwe reached the palace almost the first person 1 met was St Armande and as I dismounted he came up to me with a cordialgreeting and askedWell cavalicre goodsport t trustVery I replied shortly and thenlooked him straight in the face as 1 addedDo you intend to give the Colonna his revenge to nightSomething in my tone caught him he metmy eyes for a moment then dropped hisgaze tod looked towards the ground Westood thus before each other for a littletime before he replied and his voice wasalmost inaudiblePerhaps 1 am not sure he addedwith an effortI was standing holding Castors reinsbut as he spoke I handed the horse overto a groom and linking my arm in St Armandes said loudly and with a tone ofaffected gayetyYou missed a great ride chevalier cometake a turn with me in the gardenHe yielded passively and in a few stepswe had crossed the courtyard and were ina secluded portion of the palace gardensthat was called the Lemon walk This Imay add was subsequently improved out ofexistence by the architect in the course ofcompletion of the palace and groundsWhen we reached this point I unslippedmy arm and turning round faced St Armande having resolved to end my suspiciousSee here chevalier I said I am playing for heavy stakes I am walking on dangerous ground and must know where I putmy feet will you answer a plain questionAre you friend or foeHe looked round in a helpless sort of wayhis color coming and going but said nothing Was it possible the man was a cowardIf you do not reply I said I will takethe risk and treat you as an enemy doyou heai You lied to me when you saidlast night you had played at the Vaticanwith Colonna now draw 1 pulled outmy weapon and stood before him expecting every instant to see his rapier in hishands but he stood absolutely still hishead hanging downMan I said have you not heard AmI to think you a coward as well as a liarHow dare you say that he burst outYou you of all men Ok what am I say-Seizing Jacopo by tiie neck ejected himing Yea I did not play with Colonnabut I thought you were hard pressed formoney ami and invented the fiction thinking that perhapsThat perhaps I would accept your winnings over the gambling table rather thanthe offer of a friend You do me muchhonor chevalierYou wrong me Savelli nay start notI know your name and story and beforeheaven say 1 am your friendYou know meYes 1 am working for you come putby your sword Look at me Do I looklike an enemyli had recovered himself and met mygaze lcnlessly Where could I have seenthat face before 1 drew my hand over myforehead as if to sweep the cobwebs frommy memory but with no availWell he went on with a smile doI look like an enemy If I do your swordis ready Strike now it will be quick riddance come1 put back my sword with a snapI do not understand but I accept yourexplanationHe held out his hand franklyThat is right and you will still let mebe your comrade iI took
