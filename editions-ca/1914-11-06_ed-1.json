to be the face of a skeleton. An old
lady living on Depot street, who is
somewhat of a seeress, says that the
10 marked on the egg means that the
European war will lastforten years and
that the skeleton is the representa

track that has shown sensationally, in
the brown colt by Transvaal out of
Margaret Roche, the dam of Colonel
Heck. He negotiated a quarter re
cently inn :23 3-5 with 125 pounds up,
the performance being a highly im

owned by the veteran breeder, Martin
Doyle. Transvaal was lepresented by
a number of high-class performers the
past season, including Burwood, Bal

Cherry is the wood used as a back

illustrations are printed in magazines
and periodicals. It is chosen above
all others because it holds its shape,
does not warp or twist, works smooth

Two governors, those of Oregon and
Massachusetts, have suspended the
hunting season this year because of
increased danger of forest fires when
the woods were exceptionally dry.
The position of city forester is now

FOUND MUftDERtD IN WEEDS
The body of C. T. Royce, well-known
Nicholas county farmer, who had ben
missing for the past twelve day3 W2
found Tuesday morning near his 'barn
hidden under weeds, which were cov'
ered by rails. There is no doubt that
he had been murdered. When found
the right arm was missing, his left
hand was off and his head wa3 sev
ered from the body.
The body was discovered by Sheriff
W. T. Parker and Ed. Lawrence, wh
went to the farm Tuesday to continue
the search in hopes of finding some
clue that they might trace down.
The first excitement came when
Mr. Dalzell, a neighoor of Mr. Royce
telephoned the officials that Mr. Royco
had not been seen for several days
that his barn had been locked and one
of his horses had died and the others
were almost dead. Search was insti
tuted immediately. Clues were run
down. Malcolm Royve, of Winchester,
was called over the long distance
phone and he came to assist in the
search. The place where Mr. Royce's
remains were found indicated that
there was a struggle. A binder, whici
stands close by the barn was covered
with blood, which had been smeared
with dirt. Several rQcks covered with
blood were found. A neighbor, Mrs.
Wilson, said that about ten days ago
she heard two shots in the neighbor
hood of the Royce place and heard
some one yell, "0, Lord" twice.
Coroner Hutchings held an inquest
Tuesday afternoon and examined sev
eral witnesses. Bud Thomas was
placed under arrest. Annon Marks
was taken into custody but was re
leased upon examination.
Mr. Royce is survived by two son,
Walter Royce, of Kansas and MaT
colm Royce, of Winchester.
