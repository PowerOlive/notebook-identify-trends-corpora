k DANGEROUS DUTY
OUR NAVAL VESSELS
It Is Cxtremely Haiardom and Try
lug Work and Many Precautions
Are Xecesaary to Prevent Loss of
Life Daring the Operation
There is one phase of the ship life of
the American naval officer that is
scarcely known to the layman and that
can hardly be understood by him as he
looks upon the modern ship in all her
attractive cleanliness and meets her
neatly uniformed officers upon the spot
less upper deck Not only are the parts
of the ship in sight kept clean and free
from rust and decay but also those far
down contracted spaces that never see
the light of day These include the cel
lular oompartments between the inner
and outer skins of the ship known tech
nically as the double bottom and
other places that separate the magazines
and various built up structures within
the ship from the outer skin
These narrow compartments are espe
cially susceptible to dampness and rust
and in order that those who have the
care of them may do their duty well
and so prevent the decay of the ship a
system of inspection has been devised
and the inspectors most be under the
naval regulations commissioned offi
cers A permanent board of inspection
is formed upon each ship which must
consist of one engineer and two line of
ficers The duty of this board is period
ically to make personal inspections of
all the parts of the ship examine every
thing critically suggest remedies for
any evils that may be found to exist
and to report to the commanding offi
cer for transmission to the navy de
partment the condition of the vessel in
detail
Uniforms are discarded while mak
ing these inspections and clad in sea
mens ordinary working suits these offi
cers crawl upon all fours throughout the
length of the bottom of the ship wrig
gle snakelike through narrow openings
and examine with their own eyes every
inch of the surface of the thin steel
plates The paint of these compart
ments softened by dampness in some
places and by heat and the steam laden
air of the boiler rooms in others rubs
off upon the working suits and an
hours crawling transforms the neat
officer into a very sorry spectacle In
some modern navies this duty is per
formed by the enlisted men the officers
being excused from it but in our navy
the feeling exists that an enlisted man
should not be asked to go where an offi
cer is not willing to lead The result is
that things always work with the
Americans and the efficiency of the fleet
is assured
Numerous precautions must be taken
to avoid the risk of losing life whiie
performing this duty for it is attended
with no little danger The atmosphere
of confined spaces entirely or partly
closed for a considerable length of time
becomes robbed of its oxygen in the
formation of rust and is soon made unfit
to sustain life If possible such com
partments are blown out with pure air
led through a hose from a blower duct
and all manhole plates removed before
being entered A lighted candle is al
ways carried by the inspecting officer
upon his crawling tour If the candle
burns dimly or seems upon the point of
being extinguished there is a deficiency
of oxygen and he will immediately
seek the nearest opening leading from
the compartment and leave it at once
Men are stationed at places as near as
possible to him so that theymay hear
his voice and render immediate assist
ance in case of need No one is allowed
to enter any confined space on board
ship without an uncovered light al
though in addition a portable electrio
light is carried frequently to render the
inspection more thorough
It not infrequently happens that offi
cers and men become so wedged between
bulkheads and beams while performing
this duty as to make it extremely diffi
cult to remove them and more than uue
officer of the navy is upon the retired
list today because of permanent injury
to his health contracted while perform
ing this arduous labor Because of the
care exercised it is rare that a life is
lost in this service but in one case at
least the rashness of a man proved fatal
to him One of the main boilers of the
cruiser Newark while flagship of the
south Atlantic station having been
tightly doted for a month while empty
in order to preserve it from deteriora
tion the coppersmith of that vessel an
energetic faithful man thought its in
terior should be examined and al
though warned repeatedly never to en
ter such a boiler without an open light
removed an upper manhole plate and
crawled in upon the braces with an
electrio light He told no one that he
was going into the boiler and no one
was stationed to assist him in case of
need His dead body was found half out
and half in the boiler manhole with the
electrio light still burning brightly
within the boiler He had evidently
crawled in upon the braces felt a faint
ness creeping over him and had en
deavored to regain the open air but lost
consciousness just as life lay within
his reach and so died of asphyxiation
The air in the boiler had been entire
ly robbed of its oxygen by the iron of
the shell in the formation of rust and
the residuum was unfit to breathe A
lighted candle was snuffed out immedi
ately upon oiug thrust into the boiler
and this condition prevailed until a
lower manhole plate was removed when
the heavy gas rah out as water might
and ti o air within soon came to be
quite pure No more vivid illustration
of the dangers to be encountered in the
care of ships afloat and the precautions
necesrv to be taken in this duty eould
be given than this incident whicta
shows that shot and shell and bursting
steam pipes are not the only dangers
that oouiruut the officers and men ol

TURNED THE TABLES
NSPECTING DOUBLE BOTTOMS IN A STORY OF ARTEMUS WARD AND
HENRY J BYRON
The Famous Wit Started In to Have
Some Fan With the Dramatist bnt
Fonnd In the End That He Had Met
His Hatch at C huliiuK
What follows relates to the first
meeting of the late Henry J Byron
and Artemus Ward It was at the Sav
age club after one of the Saturday din
ners and Tom Robertson suggested to
Artemus to have a tilt with Byron and
if possible draw him out The genial
showman bad only been in England a
iew days but he knew Byrons me
tier and went for him in this fashion
I fancy I have seen a face like yours
before Did you ever have a brother
Alonzo Robertson was behind Arte
mus and winked at Byron
Alas I had replied the drama
tist instantly catching the situation
He was a mariner engaged on the
deep
Thats so
You havent heard of him for five
years
Byron affected to be lost in reflection
and deliberately replied Its five
years ago this very day How curious
you should mention it sir
Well sir replied Artemus taking
out his handkerchief and pretending to
wipe away a tear I sailed the Bait sea
with your brother We were wrecked
together in the gulf of Mexico and be
fore help came I killed and ate him 1
The moment I saw you I reoognized the
likeness He was a good fellow full of
tender feeling
I am glad you found him tender
interrupted Byron also pulling out his
handkerchief
But sir I am awfully sorry I ate
him said Artemus in the most imper
turbable fashion Had I known 1
should ever meet his brother I am sure
Id have gone without food some weeks
longer But I was driven to it and you
will forgive me wont you I liked
Alonzo and he offered his hand to
Byron which the latter shook with cor
dality
Excuse my emotion wont you
gasped Byron in his handkerchief He
never wrote and told me what had be
come of him I hope he agreed with
yon
A slight indigestion afterward He
was a little tough replied Artemus
but well not speak of that We both
suffered He suffered most But remem
ber sir the law cant touch me now
It was stern necessity and necessity as
you may have heard knows no law
But I am willing to pay you damages
for the loss About what would you
think a fair compensation
Dont mention it said Byron who
now thought it time to turn the tables
I think your name is Ward said be
Yes
Artemus Ward
Quite so
You had a father
I had
He was a Yankee peddler in his own
country was he not Sold bug pizan
and tine tooth combs
Youve hit the comb I mean the
nail on the head
He died in the black country of
England did he not
He did
Well I killed him I knew you
were his sou the moment I laid eyes on
you He was a nice old gentleman and
I made his acquaintance in Stafford
shire He wished to go down a deep
coal mine so did I and we went down
together had a good time explored
lunched with the miners drank ieee
than was good for as and proceeded to
return to Mother Earth s surface After
you have been down a mine yoa an
fond of your mother I assure you The
prodigal felt nothing to what I expe
rienced We entered the huge basket
and were being slowly drawn toward
the mouth of the pit when I saw the
old rope was about to snap under the
strain It was a perilous a horrible a
critical moment The weight of two
men was too great and your father was
a broad bulky man Self preservation
is the first law of natura An instant
more and we were both lost We seemed
to be about 50 feet from the top
I hastily called your fathers atten
tion to something implored him in
fact to look down the mine He did so
and as I gently tippra him over he went
whirling and crashing to the bottom
It was rough on him but I saved my
self I ciphered it out on the instant
like this He is an old man nearly
bald deaf in one ear two teeth gone in
front with only a few years to live I
am half his age strong and healthy
the father of a young family with a
career before me a comedy to finish for I
the Haymarket and a burlesque accept
ed at the Strand Now I ask you un
der the circumstances did I not behave
nobly
You did you did sobbed i
mus I would have acted that way
myself i
I am glad to find you so intelligent J
You ate my brother and found him
tough and I am the assassin of your
dear old father continued Byron
keeping up the farce of pretended emo
tion We are both avenged Let us
draw a veil over the past and never
allude to these heartrending incidents
again
Agreed We cry quits Shake
roared Artemus extending both hands
and dramatically dashing a flood of im
aginary tears from his eyes Then he
summoned a waiter glasses round were
speedily ordered and everybody was full
of congratulations upon the ready man
ncr a which the two wits had conduct
ed their impromptu chaff Exchange
