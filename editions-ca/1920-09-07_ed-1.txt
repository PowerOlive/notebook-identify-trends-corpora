The newCounty High School at Millersburg,for reasons that were satisfactory tothe school authorities, will not openuntil Monday, September 13.Special attention of parents andguardians has been called by theschool officials to the new school attendance laws which are now onera-tive and which will be strictly andimpartially enforced. All childrenbetween the ages of seven and sixteen are required to attend schoolfive days m each week. The penaltyfor non-observance of the law is afine of $5 each day's absence, andfor continued violation of the lav,?100 fine and fifty .days in jail.The Paris- schools are in fine trimfor a prosperous season, the facultyof the High School having been especially busy this summer, absorbing new ideas of school work, andattending the summer course at various universities ane" colleges. Under the personal supervision of Prof.Lee Kfrkpatrick, who has abundantly proven his fitness for theplace, the schools will go forward trenewed activity, prograss and success in the school term of 1920-21.The North Middletown "HighSchool opened yesterday for the fallterm with a good attendance. Thefollowing compose thefaculty: Prof.R. H. Ellett, principal; teachers,Prof. E. M. Costello, Misses LouiseBenthall, Daisy Detwiller, . DeliaTinder, Mary Ellet, Helen Leigh,and Florence Dick, the latter havingcharge of the kindergarten class.It makes a big difference in thework of the Paris schools if the fallterm starts with all the pupils present. When people are busy anddriven with work, it is a temptation to keep children out of school,regardless xof its effect on theschool. Such absences make a slowstart on the year's work. The pupils who are present are held backwhile the absent ones catch up.Promptness and punctuality areone of the lessons that schools aresupposed to teach. If children amkept out of school needlessly theparents may need the lessons quiteas much as the pupils.Mrs. Robert Bell, of the Bethlehem "pike, has been appointedCounty School Attendance Officerby the County Board of Education.It will be hei duty to enforce tneprovisions of the new State educational lawr, which went into effectyesterday. Children must attendschool daily. No excuse expet -sickness,death or ijmpassable roads willbe accepted. Parents are urged tocomply with the provisions of theattendance law, and avoid disagreeable consequences.The Paris City Schools are starting off with a record v attendance.First four grades enrolled Monday.The next four will enroll to-day.Wednesday and Thursday the HighSchool will be enrolled. Prospectsare good for the greatest year inthe history of the City Schools.All grammar grades of the CitySchool began work yesterday. 'TheCatholic parochial school, at thecorner of Main and Twlefth streets,will open to-day for the fall andwinter term. Mrs. Sutherland'sprivate school will open tomorrow. A nujmber of privateclasses in voice, piano and expression will open at varying intervalsthrough the week.WEEKLY BANK CLEARINf&SBusiness picked up with Parismerchants during the past week, andthe general tone of the financialmarket was considerably stronger.The farmers are all busy and withlabor fully employed at the highestwages, the business prospect is avery good one.

S. -Porter' in Lexington Leader)The visit to Paris recently ofFritzie Scheff, the actress, divorcedwife of the late John Fox, Jr.,who died several months ago andand was buried in the family lot inthe Paris Cemetery, whose missionwas to visit the grave of her formerhusband and place thereon a floralwreath, recalls to older residents ofthis county the hard struggles of thepopular author and dramatist whenhe was a young man and before hehad acquired fame and' fortune1.John Fox, Jr., was the son of Mr.and Mrs. John Fox, who resided onthe Winchester pike, near Paris.Following the burning: of their homo'the family removed to Paris, wheretor pnany years the elder Fox conducted a school on Main street onsite now occupied by the BourbonCounty Y. M. C. A. building.Like many other young authorsthe early experiences of young Foxwere discouraging, and many timeshe felt like giving up the struggleand returning to the humdrum lifeof the farmer. But he persevered,and at the time of his death was recognized as one of America's foremost young writers.Will A. Hill, city editoi of THEBOURBON NEWS, recalls an incident in the life of the author whichillustrates his fight against strongodds and his appreciation of thosewho stood by him in his struggles.One day, Fox, came to Mr.Hill, who was at that timeParis correspondent of the daily papers, and handed hi,m a bundle ofmanuscript, saying he wanted to askof hipn the favor of typewriting it,punctuating, paragraphing and correcting all errArs, as accomplishmentof which he did not feel himself entirely competent. "He stated at the time that he wasfinancially embarrassed, and wouldnot be able to pay Mr. Hill verymuch for the work. Mr. Hill accepted the task and, becoming interested in 4he story, he finished it atone sitting.It proved to be the first novel accepted by the publishers and placedMr. Fox on the road to success. Thetitle was "A Mountain Europa," andwas first published in serial form inScribner's Magazine. Under thescreen title of "A CumberlandRomance," the story was shown ata Paris picture house last week.A few years later, and after Mr.Hill had entirely forgotten the incident, Mr. Fox entered THE NEWJfoffice and remarking, "I believe I anlindobted to you for a great favor,"placed in his hands a, checkfor a neat sum, and a few days laterMr. Hill leceived a copy of each ofhis most successful works, bearingthe author's 'autograph and a neatsentiment of the author's appreciation and -good wishes.During her visit here Miss Scheffspoke in the highest terms of herlate husband. "John Fox. was aprince among men," she said, "buthis temperament and mine rah indifferent grooves, "and we concludedthe easiest way was the best way. Ihave always had the highest regadfor him, and shall ever cherish hi3mqmory."HOME TELEPHONE NOTES.'Mr. and Mrs. E. C.

Experiments which the dedartment of agronomy has been conducting for. three yeais indicVethat from 500 to 1,000 pounds o'fgrourd limestone to the acre willvery greatly increase the growth o"clover on soils, needing lime. It issuggested that county agents put outa number of v demonstrations as, follows: Mix 250 pounds of acidphosphate with 750 pounds of finelyground limestone and apply 1,000pounds of the (mixture to the acre.Do the mixing immediately beforeusing. If possible to apply theabove amount or close to it throughthe fertilizer attachment of a graindrill, it may be drilled in with wheator rye. In any event, it is avdvisedto seed the treated land to wheat orrye, and then seed to red or sweetclover on a 'honey-comb' freezenext February. It is confidently believed that this treatment willbringan excellent crop of clover,although, of course, larger applications will make the lime treatmentlast longer. Burnt lime pnay beused at one-half the kbove rates ofapplication.
