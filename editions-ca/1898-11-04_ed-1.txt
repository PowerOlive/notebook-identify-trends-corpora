MoreMoisture Thau NeededBy means of a large number of observations Mr J W Tutt is able toconfirm what has been stated by otherobservers that certain butterflies andmoths are very much addicted to drinkIu a paper published in the proceedings of the South London Entomological and Natural History society MrTutt says there can be no doubt thatbutterflies drink more than is requiredby theii tissues under any possible conditions He has known Polyommatusdainon to sit for more than an hour motionless except for the slight movementof sucking up and discharging themoisture almost continuouslyWhat this internal bath may reallymean cannot be surmised Another important factor as to this drinking habitis a strange one the tnirsty soulsas far as his observation goes being almost entirely males Possibly if exactobservations could be made it might befound that females in small numbersalso visit puddles pools and streamsfor drinking purposes but as far as MrTutt has been able to discover it is themales alone who indulge in these copious libations while the females areaway laying eggs Moths and butterflies of both sexes visit sugar overripefruit and similar dainties bat they doso for food The males alone seem to beattracted by pure water and Mr Tuttsuggests that their extra activity having originally given them greater needin this direction a habit which was atfirst a necessity hs become so pleasurable that excessive drinking has literally become a viceMUSIC FROM HEAVENCharming German Method of SummoningChurch WorshipersWhile religious music will doubtlesslive as long as

Dollar Expended by the United StatesIf After Balancing Our Accounts it UFound Any Compensation is Due theDons it Will lie raid to Themin a Lump SumWashington Nov 2 The cabinetTuesday devoted most of its attentionto consideration of questions connectedwith the administration of affairs inCuba and Porto Ilico The administrative feature of the Philippine question also received some attentionNothing- has been heard from the commission at Paris as to Mondays proceedings and it is realized that nothingis to be expected in the way of developments tmtil Fridays sessionWhile the cabinet gave little attention Tuesday to the peace negotiationsat Paris there is no longer any doubtas to the general purposes of this government to retain the entire Philippine archipelago If after iinal balancing of the account viz the costof the war to the United States on oneside and our acquisitions on the other it is found that any compensation is due the Spaniards it willbe made in a lump sum It is pointed out that at the time the protocol was signed the United States didnot have and has not since acquiredany part of the Philippine islands outside of Manila city and harbor andthat the United States has never entertained a purpose to acquire any ter3 itory by the power of conquest Whatthe United States will insist upon isthat she must be fully reimbursed forevery dollar expended by her on accountof the war and in the statement willbe included an amount sufficient tocover all payments present andprospective on account of the pensionsincident to the war Xo Spanish bondsof any character or amount other thanlocal or municipal bonds will be paidor assumed by this government Thequestion of the status of municipalobligations under circumstances likethe present is fixlly settled by interuational law They must berecognized as valid and bindingby the conquering- power and henceit is assumed that the United Stateswill not raise any question on thispoint but promptly consent to guarantee their final payment What sum oimoney this government will consent topay to Spain can not even be estimated but when the final account is rendmvd it is believed that the balanceflue Spain will be small probably notexceeding S2u000000 or S30000000 -The belief still prevails among themajority of the cabinet that the Spaniards will accept the terms laid downby the United States and whatever ofdelay occurs before that result isreached will be chargeable only to thepurpose of the Spaniards to secure thebest possible terms to extort the lastpossible million dollars before acceding to our demandsThe possibility of disagreement ofthM commissioners and the failure ofthe conference however is now contemplated with greater equanimitythan at an earlier stage of the negotiations The administration has satisfied itself that Spain is neither able norwilling to resume hostilities on anyscale that -would make her a dangerousopponent to the United States Therefore supposing the Paris conference tofail all that would be iir ed uponour government as an iminiatc dutywould be to take immediate completemilitary possession of the PhilippinesThis it is believed could be accomplished without loss of life The lastvestige of Spanish military power inthe islands is that under Col Rioscommander-in-chief of the Viscayasislands and by deputized authorityin charge of all Spanish territory notdirectly within the control of theUnited States in the Philippine islands Kis force is insignificant froma military point of view and it isdoubtful if he could have held his ownagainst the insurgents had the Tagalsbeen allowed by Adm Dewey to makeManila the base of an expedition directed gainst the Spanish commanderSo far as Cuba is concerned the difficulty might be more serious but evenin Cuba the Spanish military forcesare not in condition to offer a prolongedresistance to the American conquestof the island and with the Spanish-navy at the bottom of the sea theycould not be reinforced with troopsfrom Spain Therefore about theworst that could happen would betbe necessity imposed upon us of- struggling along without the signatureof a treaty of peace butin full possession of all the territory we desire and that such conditions can exist without damage tcmaterial interests is shown by the history of the Spanish American republicwhich revolted from Spains ruleYellow Fever in

CannesConsiderable Loss to Growerand ShippersA well dressed fowl will of coursecommand a higher price than a poorly-dressedone and it is evident theremust be quite a loss to the growers andshippers of poultry on this accountand it might not come amiss to give afew hints on dressing fowls properlyas there does not seem to be any needof dressing them poorly First of allcrops of all fowls to be killed for market should be entirely empty A mistake is generally made by not hanging the fowl up while stripping offthe feathers but holding it with onehand and picking it with the otherOne can work rapidly when the birdis hanging as both hands are then atliberty the cuticle a transparent outside covering of the fowl is very easilyinjured particularly of a scalded birdand when the bird is held while picking it this membrane is often rubbedoff in spots and although this injurydoes not seem to show much at firstafterwards these spots turn dark giving the bird an unsightly appearanceOverscalding also loosens the cuticletherefore we should exercise greatcare not to keep the birds in hot waterfor too long a time when scaldingthem nave the water at the boilingpoint yet not actually boiling Takethe bird by the head and feet and immerse it lifting up and down in thewater three or four times then hangup by the feet The head should neverbe immersed as it turns the comb paleand gives the eyes a shrunken appearance Now remove all the feathersletting the small ones drop into thebarrel beneath and keeping wing andtail feathers by themselves The smallfeathers may afterward be spread outand dried if deemed of value The feetof all fowls should be scrupulouslyclean wash or still better brushthem Western PlowmanPOULTRY DISEASESThey Are More Easily IMermiiiatcdThan the Discaists

universally there is no doubtthat some if not all of our contagiousdiseases among poultry must soon dieout Where a flock has a certain disease the fowls could be allowed to didoi be killed and the

otherboarders at a seaside hotel stood onthe piazza just after daybreak of amorning following a fearful night andsaw there houses in turn break loosefrom the last props and lashings thatheld them and float out to sea fallingto pieces when they got fairly in thebreakers like so many flimsy gluedboxes They were not mere shantiesior indifferently built houses eitherThev had stout timbers were two stories with many rooms and long piazzasand each one anchored it was supposed firmly to the piles deep drivenas is the custom with wooden housesThey had been owned and lived in bythe same families summer after summer for years They were just so manychips mere nothings in the clutch ofthe storm No There was nobody inthem The tenants had realized theirdanger and got out hours before andhad saved some of their things butthe sight of those houses floating offand going to pieces with the windblowing 1 forget how many miles anhour and the lightships distress gunsbooming out every so many secondsmade an impression likely to be remembered That storm however wasnot a record breaker They have had-worse ones off the Carolina and Georgiacoast before and since but the wholeexperience was uew

noontide gloryIn the moonlights peaceful glowPeasant and lord togetherAs the seasons come and goTwo cities upon the bordersOf a river dark and wideOne where the people trembleTo cross the swelling tideAnd enter the icy watersWith prayers and bated breathThis is the land of the livingThe river the men call DeathOne step and the other cityWith its shafts of marble whiteMarking the narrow

thereservation which way they had goneNine at least were in the party and thehoof tracks led away southwestwardacross the flat until they struck the lineof the railway two miles west of theJunction Here there seemed to havebeen a brief halt discussion possibly adivide and a split Two horses hadcrossed the track and gone south theothers veering westward had lit outfor the Santa Clara and Randy Merriam a trifle hungry now was wishingwith all his heart he had gone first toFlorence and left the inspection of thestables until afterwards It was somewhere about two oclock when theystarted The men were booted andspurred but Merriam was in ordinarytrousers and the troop horse he rodewas quick to find the spur was goneand slow to mind the heel TheMcClellan saddle too with its upright pommeland cantle worried him after the easeof his own Whitman When dawn camehe was well nigh ready to give up thechase after fording the Santa Clara andfinding the trail had turned northwestward when a sharp eyed trooper sworehe could see the quarry making for thefoothills and not two miles ahead soMerriam borrowed a single spur andpushed vehemently vigorously onThen broad daylight came and therecould be no doubt they were gainingThe chase was hot Thepursued weretossing off saddle bags riatas and other detachable horse furniture to lightentheir weight but they stuck to theirguns and ammunition Merriams menwere considerably strung out not morethan six being well up within supporting distance when the fact that theywere in range of the greasers was demonstrated by the zip and sing of a bullet close alongsideThats business muttered thetrooper who rode close on his left rearShall 1 trv a shot sirMerriam shook his head The situation had few points in its favorObedient to his orders to pursue andcapture the gang Randy had riddenj hard yet over many a mile had he asked5 himself the question Suppose tihey resist arrest whats to be done He hadno warrant He was not even a deputysheriff not even the humblest contj stituent of a posse comiatus If he orhi airijTur thvr fire and shotsome of these unnatural naturalizedvoters and citizens like as not an indictment for murder -would be hangingover his head if not hanging him in thecourse of a fortnight True there wasno sheriff within 70 miles and long before the civil authorities could bebrought into play the murderers ofBrad -would be scattered all over theface of the earth All the same underthe strict interpretation of the civillaw Lieut Merriam knew that he andhis people had no more business tryingto arrest these renegades than they hadto vote at a territorial election Inpoint of fact like many another officerand man soldier of Uncle Sam on thebroad frontier he was aware of the factthat even a horse thief had more civilrigihts than the trooper His expeditiontherefore in the eye of the law wasnothing more nor less than a lawlessdash winding up in a possible freefig ht and all against the peace and dignity of the people of New Mexico Perhaps Buxton knew this too but the orders he gave were peremptory and Merriam never stopped to reply reason whyor expostulate But now when therenegades began to shoot the reasoningwhy had to be done His men were hotfor battle so was he but the nationexpects of its officers that no matterwhat the temptation provocation or exasperation they keep cool heads andtempers only snoot when the law permits but then shoot to kill No claimof self defense could be allowed Theywere the pursuing and therefore theattackingpartyand though these Mexicans were followed red handed

Better die fightingsaid the leader and fight it wasThej were close to the entrance of alittle ravine that set in among the barren slopes from the open ground to theeast All the way from the Santa Clarathe ascent had been gradual but distinctly marked and just as the loremost rider spurred around the shoulderof the hillside his panting bronchostumbled went down rolled helplesslyover and lay there dead to kicks cursesor blows Three of the gang lashed onward leaving their countryman to hisfate but two of them better nervedreined up alighted and throwingthemselvesfiatupon the ground

the target for the sharp fire ofthree magazine rifles famous for theiraccuracy at no greater distance thanthe 400 yards that now separated themAlmost before he could realize it Randyfelt a sharp sting just at the outer edgeof his bridle arm and knew that theblood gushed from the wound Thenall of a sudden his poor troop horsebearing his rider helplessly with himTwo minutes more as some of themen dismounted and with rapid andeffective fire scattered the Mexicans toshelterwithin the ravine Corporal Buttsand a trooper succeeded in pulling Merriamfreefrom the madly lashing- struggling stricken brute and then it wasfound that their pallir1 speechless leader had received some serious injuryAll the breath was knocked out of hisbody and the bridle arm was brokenmidway between the wrist and elbowThat ended the chase Four or fivemen it is true took advantage of thefact that the lieutenant was knockedout to dash ahead and have a personalaffair with the greasers and later inthe day when after a long long rideTrooper Mullen reached a friendlyIanchman on the Santa Clara and hadhim send out his spring wagon for thewounded officer these enthusiasts camedrifting back there was reason for belief that their ammunition had notbeen entirely spent in vain But it wasa worn out used up detachment escorting a two wheeled improvised ambulance that recrossed the Santa Claralate that afternoon and was met thereby the assistant surgeonI hope you saw Mrs Merriam beforeyou started was Randys faint greeting She wasnt much worried wasshe I tried to scrawl a line or twoand we made the messenger

doctor reappearedand mountingrode alongside was Goslowslow as you can Then to thehospital attendant who had ridden outwith him he muttered Now ride aheadParks and see if theres any newsCHAPTER XIIWhen Florence regained strengthenough to move she crept slowly backto her little parlor where the beaconlights that were to summon her husband were still faithfully fraitlesslyburning She looked in at the diningroom and its preparation for cheer andwelcome and turned away with ashiver of disgust and then with a moanof pathetic misery threw herself intoan armchair and tried to think Whatshould she do What could she do Herlove for Randy was so fond so glowingthat she had gifted him with the qualities of a god leaning upon him in everything trusting him in everything relying upon his word as though it were apledge on high and yet within thesefew hours he had all unasked givenher his promise not to see or speak withthat woman ajgain except he came firstto her his wif e and told her the needthen had gone secretly almost directlyto meet- his old love in the shadows ofthe night long after the hour that usually saw the last light extinguished alongofficers rowIf her old friend from baby days thecolonel had come to her and said thatRandy was false if her idol her beloved father had added his confirmation of the colonels views she wouldhave laughed them down so long asRandy her hero Randy swore thathe was true Many a woman will standby her lover against a world in evidenceyet turn to stone against him when shesees one apparent sign of interest inanother Poor girl lie was her firsther only love He was hers and onlyhers and should be only hers for whenthat other creature had scorned anddenied him had he not been broughtsore stricken to her doors Had shenot won him back to life through thewealth and glory of her own unsuspected love From the day of their wedding until this woman came never hadshe known a wish that was not his Dayand night she dreamed planned andthought for him sought only to makeherself worthier his love deai er to hiseyes sweeter to his caress Who wasthere to compare with him in manliness in courtesy in knightly bearingWhat officer was the peer of Randywhat officer even in the dear oldRiflers with whom had been her homeWLCarrying her rider helplessly with hesvfrom baby days They chided hersome of the girls in what they calledher defection You used to say therecould be no regiment like the RiflersFloy You used to vow youd nevermarry out of the old regiment Ayebut that was before Randy came washer simple answer and then they toldher Randy was her world and proudlyanswered Ibelieveplunged heavily f orward and groaningwaraed heMome o the oldeanu struggling weni aown in a neapThevanawiser matrons and God knows theyhad much on which to base their viewsit was never safe to love any man toomuch even Randy to which she answered with sunshine in her eyesHow could one love Randy too muchMind you she never volunteered theseoverflowings of her heart but thesewomen had been her friends from herearliest days She -was still shy evenwith him but such well meant warnings always seemed to put her on the defensive as it were and poor child shebelieved it her duty to her husband thatshe should never allow him to go undefended even though the attack wereintangible as a womans sneer Andthey looked so well together and he wasso proud of her so devoted to her soconscious of her as some one saidNowhere in that garrison was thereman or woman who was able to say thatRandy had not borne himself as an almost ideal lover and husband ever sincethat sun kissed wedding day Manycould even feel a sense of what is calledagreeable disappointment which always strikes me as a phraseologicalparallel for that other remarkableeuphemism of so many of our countrywomen shes enjoying poor healthYet withal Florence had the sympathythe genuine affection of all Fort Sedgwick even in or rather notwithstandinir her enthusiastic estimate of Randys qualities as husband and as manand her own extreme beatitude aswife Then Mrs Buxton ventured tofire a shot as she stood watching themstrolling homeward after parade oneevening absorbed in one another andto observe to her own supremely indifferent lord There now Buxtheres another pfrl making a fool ofherself over a man only shes the sweetest fool I ever knew in my born daysBux himself roared it out for Floysbenefit not Jong after and did itso thathalf Fort Sedgwick heard it for the onevaluable quality Bux possessed as acavalry officer was his voice The volume of sound he could produce whenbellowing instructions to a regimentalskirmish line was something prodigiousbut of so rasping and exasperating atfmbre that his old time derider Blakelikened it in force to a fog horn and instaying power to boiled cabbage nota neat comparison but one expresslyfittingAnd now strangely enough this maddest of nights poor Florence could notget those words and that tone out ofher head She had flushed and turnedspeechless away at the time hurt to hersoul and indignant too but the training of her youth was strong Thesewere people her father and mother hadtaught her to respect and though angry indignant remonstrance was inher heart she stifled the words thatstrove to spring to her lipsI expect Ive put my foot in it againto day reported Bux to his better halfwhen he got homeWell Im sure Im never surprisedwas the ladys prompt replyI fear Ive been rude to Col BuxtonRandy faltered Floy when that gentleman came in from troop drill an hourlaterYou couldnt be rude even to Buxmy darling was his answer as hefolded her in his armsAnd these are not types of the firstyear wedded and the quarter century mated love as seen in the army Ihave known many and many a couplewho have risen together through everygrade in the line loved loving and lovers to the endAt one oclock Florence had set herlights in the parlor window At twowith that booming gong like sound reverberating in her ears that incessantrepetition of Buxtons coarse wordsshe had sprung from the chair in whichshe had been brooding writhing shuddering for half an hour and then tearing down the shade close looping thecurtains she hurried to the hall andlocked and bolted the door Anothergirl making a fool of herself for a mananother girl God how the wordsrang resounded through her brainbuzzed and whirred like angry waspsin her ears hissed and rattled ayestung like the venomous reptiles shehad learned to shun from early childhood Making a fool of herself fur aman who would leave her so soon forthat painted

into my possession1 did it partly to accommodate Amesand partly a a speculation That wasfive years ago For some time Ameshas been getting behind on his interest and 1 did not look after him as Iought so I was rather surprised andnot a little disgusted when I found lastweek that I was the owner of theplace and that Ames had moved away2 havent been out here for a numberof yesrs and I did not-

much inducement togo outdoors My boarding place isonly five minutes from the law officewhere I work and when one is tiredhe doesnt feel like walking or evenriding the bicycle just for the exerciseSo

MrsMy name is Littlefield said the oldlady as she gave him her fat hand toshakeWhen a few evenings later he cameto arrange his household effects MrsLittlefielo came over and helped himto make his srnll house look homelike Then she insisted- on his takingtea over at her house and he consented saying that when he got settledshe must return the callBTe stayed late into the evening andwhen he went to his own house hefelt a little homesick but that didnot Is st long as he soon fell asleepWhen he went by his neighbors to takethe car the next morning he wavedhis hund gayly to Mrs Littlefield whostood at he windowThat roon 11 r went to his old boarding place where he was to continuetf take his dinners He had lived withMr and Mrs Anstir for a number ofyears nnc Mr Austin felt a motherlysolicitude for him She looked at himanxiously as he came In and almostoverwhelmed Jiim with questions as1to whether he slept well and if hehad breakfast enough and if he wasntvery tirca and didnt he think he hadbetter stay in town that night andwTas the house properly aired beforehe went into itFor the first -week Arnold himselfwas a little doubtful about his experiment and Mrs Austins fears andquestions rather annoyed him butat the end of that time he began tcget used to his new life and he becamemore cheerful than he had been formonthsBy the tim the grass began to tuingreen he could not have beenedto return to his old waj of living Hishouse seemed more attractive as timewent on He tidied the yard trimmedthe rose bushes and grape vines andby the middle of April he began withgreat enthusiasm to spade up a garden patch lie had lived on a faimonce otherwise it might not haeseemed so good to get into the countryagainMrs Austin sighed and shook herhead and continued to fearthat Arnold would break down until Junecame Then as she saw no prospectof getting him back and as she waslonesomt evenings she took a schoolteacher to board She was a erypretty girl Grace Howard by nameand as bhe was quite talkative MrbAustins diinner table was a very pleasant meeting placeArnold was not used- to girls but itseemed to him that Grace Howardmust be iifferent from most girls hefelt so friendty toward her and sheseemed such a congenial spirit Tietold her all about his house his gardenand of he long rambles he took onSundays They talked of books andagreed remarkably well on ThoreaxiBurroughs and Torrey She listenedwith interest to all he told her of bisrural experiencesThe summer went by andi Arnold became more and more enamored ofhis country home The Littlefieldswere a constant source of pleasure tohim and the two households were veryneighborlyFall came and still the fascinationof his bachelors hall held himThen one night just on the1 edge ofwinter a new idea came to him Bowmuch plcasanter it would be if Gracewere hee he thought ns he sat ina reverie for a long time After thathe kept thinking of her being thereand of Zow well she would become thehouse Especially did he think of itwhen he sat opposite to her at dinnerIn March he began housecleaningHe tore the paper from the wallsbought paint and brushes and beganenergetically to apply the formerwith the latter to the inside woodwork Then he got large books ofwallpaper samples and asked MrsAustins and Graces advice about thechoice of the designs When he ordered the paper it was in every instance in- kind Grace had liked Ittook him a good while to do the painting and he began to be impatient sohe hired a man to hang the paperAll this time he was getting deeperin love with his house and with Gracebut he told himself he would wait tilleverything looked at its best beforehe brought Grace to see it After thathe would ask her an important questionTt was in May that one Sunday afterchurch Mrs Austin and Grace tookthe electric ears and went to seeArnolds house He met them at thecornpr of hisstreet and the three wentalong together chatting gaylyMr5 Austin admired everythingalong the way and when she came tosee the interior of the house she wasloud ir her praises Grace agreed tocver3thing but did not say muchThey had lunch together and atlength Arnold went and saw them ontheir car then stood watching till itwas lost to view He was very happyand as he went back home he apostrophized his house as it had come to behis habit to doI think you made a good impression he said And I hope the timeis coming when you wont be left allalone daytimesThe next night as he was getting onhis wheel to go home he saw Gracewalking along the opposite sidewalkHe crossed over and trundling his bicjele he walked beside herHow did you like my home askedArnold as the paused at the AustinsgateIt is very pretty she said judicially But it mift be horribly lonesomeJ should die I know if I had to live insuch a place Still she added smiling if you like it that is all that isnecessary Be gustibus 11011 est disputandum you know Good nightArnold looked after her as she wentup the steps Then as the door

beforeeverything came right so tnat Arnoldcould put his question to G aceAfter that when they were makingplans for the future Arnold askedWhat shall we do about a houseGrace opened hor eyes wide
