The greatest Southern Drama ever screened. All the romance all the action all the charm that is spelled out by the
letters K-E-N-T-U-C-K-Y will be found is this fascinating story of the South-land. There's a girl in it who is going to win
your heart; there's a gallant old colonel with a glorious code of honor; there's a scheming plotter and an adventuress, and a host
of other characters, each one drawn with all of Opie Read's splendid skill, and each one delineated by a sterling player.
