The odor strongly resemyles that caused by waterlogged woodor dead leaves. A NEWS man askedCity Health Officer A. H. Keller yesterday regarding the matter, and foran explanation Dr. Keller says:"The odor about which so muchcomplaint has been made is nothingmore or less than that caused by asolution of chlorine, which is nspri hvthe Water Company in purifying the !water wnion comes through thepipes. It has no bad qualities, anddoes not affect the quality of the water. Owing to the low stage of water in Stoner creek at the presenttime I advised Mr. Mitchell to increase the per cent, of chlorine usedin this process, which tends to killall the possible harmful animalculaein the water, ordinarily invisible tothe human eye. There is positivelynothing harmful in this solution,and' our people need not be afraid ofusing it. Of course, as a precaution,I have advised boiling water used fordrinking or domestic purposes.

C. Hanna. This is a decrease of 843,000 bushels for theJune 1st estimate of the Kentuckywheat crop, due chiefly to poor filling of heads in many sections, eventhough the acreage was nearly 10per cent, more than in 1920.This month's preliminary estimateof the acreage of corn indicates hcrop of about 92,791,000 bushels,compared to 100,650,000 bushels last"year, -while oats are estimated atonly 6,565,000 bushels, compared to8,225,000 bushels last year. Manyfields of oats in various parts of theState -were so short they had .to bocut with a mower or be "pastured.'Hye is estimated at 420,000 bushelscompared to 480,000 bushels lastyear; barley 10.6,000 bushels, compared to 112,000 bushels last year;Irish potatoes 4,458,000 bushels,compared to 6,435,000 bushels lastyear, and sweet potatoes 1,797,000"bushels, compared to 1,890,000"bushels last year.All these 1921 estimates are subject to revision downward or upward as the season progresses, depending on favorable or unfavorableweather and other conditions hereafter. These tobacco and corn estimates are the first of this season,and as planting of both crops wascontinued very late this year suchestimates may be subject to considerable change either upward or downward before the end of this season.Hay has been a short crop (inyield per acre) in most counties,though some places it is good. Muchof it is very weedy, especially with,white-top, the average condition ofall hay being only 68 per cent.Pastures generally are only fair..Fruit is irregular, but generally avery short crop. Apples are onlyabout 18 per cent, of a full crop, butin the Henderson commercial district they are half a crop or better.Peaches and pears are only 8 percent, of a full crop. Melons gener-;ally are in fair condition, though Ilate. .Blue sxass seed and hemp areshort crops in Kentucky this year,though some hemp was planted inplace of tobacco. The State's bluegrass seed crop is estimated at only187,500 bushels in chaff, comparedto 450,000 bushels last yearv Hempis estimated at about 3,000" acres.MILLER OBLIGEDTOQUIT BUSINESSLouisville Man Pinally Gives UpAfter Suffering: For EightYears"My ill health forced me out ofbusiness, but since taking Tanlac Ifeel so fine I will get back in harness again," said Robert Miller, 419West Market street, Louisville, Ky.,who was in the hardware businessin Detroit, Michigan, ten years."Stomach trouble "and rheumatismgot the best of me and for eightyears I lived in misery.

In some counties the yieldwill not be much over a fourth andin others a fifth of the yield of1920. The success of the burleygrowers in organizing under the.Sapiro plan and the cutting out ofso much of the yield by the weather,in addition to the reduction inacreage which almost every tobaccogrower made at the beginning of theseason, would indicate to the averageobserver that prices for burley tobacco this year would be considerably above those of last year.It has been a hard year for thefarmer generally. With high-pricedland producing low-priced products,many have felt the sting of financialloss, but if the rains come soon andare general, and if improved demandabroad ends, as it is bound to, in arevival in business, the farmer willyet come into his own.The Kentucky corn crop will oelarge. While there will be no fruit,the yield of other crops will belarger, always providing there israin, and the farmer may comforthimself with the thought that "itmight have been worse." With hisforces organized, he can at least demand and obtain a fair price Iqx histobacco and there seems no littledoubt that he will do so.FOR TAX COMMISSIONERWe are authorized to announceBEN WOODFORD, JR., of Bourboncounty, as a candidate for the officeof Tax Commissioner of BourbonCounty, with MRS.

When finesalone are to be feared the class owning the most powerful and the mostdangerous cars may drive at speeddangerous to traffic, without fear ofconsequences.It is conceded that if there is ameans of putting down reckless driving -it is by rigid enforcement ofspeed laws carrying jail sentences.It is within the power of the nextLegislature to amend the present lawso that speeders may be sent to jail,and such amendment should beadopted.oLIVELY LONDON LAUGHSniHtfc' F MEAL"The new sugar coated SSIr Mchewing twhich everybody ZmW PusfT'likes-you will. ggWYA &g frfi&.rk.m iv k i va m ? x,jrWJATZk.

A sound-minded, wellnourisbed, sensible-clothed personwill not suffer much from the heat,the specialists state. On the otherhand persons wbo eat heartily ofwinter foods, who get less thaneight hours of sleep out of every 24and who wear badly-fitting shoes forinstance are liable to heat prostration. "The housewife should take advantage of the opportunity whichpresents itself during the summermonths of training her family inhealth and food habits. It is notrouble to get children or adults totake cold baths during the summerand once started this good habit isapt to be continued. Fruits and vegetables are never so well received asduring their own season while teaand coffee can be replaced daily bythe more refreshing cool fruit drinks."It is unnecessary for any -housewifewho is willing to plan out herwork to spend long hours in a hotkitchen. Except in the houses wherethere are a number of men doingmanual labor, and requiring heavyfood, the cooking for the day canbe done in the early morning. Insummer the protein requirements ofthe diet should be filled by eggs,milk, fish, fowl and cheese, insteadof by heavier meats. Vegetables,particularly the succulent ones, manyof which can be eaten raw, should beused in abundance. Fruits and berries should appear as such, not combined with rich pastries. In canning by the cold pack process muchof the heat and worry of canning iseliminated."The dining room should lose allof its unnecessary draperies andbric-a-brac, in order that dustingmay be reduced to a minimum. Veryattractive stencilled oil cloth doiliesand paper napkins not only willmake the table look and feel muchcooler, but also will save heavywashing and ironing. All heavy rugsshould be removed in the summer.Heavy upholstered furniture shouldbe covered with cool-colored chintz.It is well to close the windows abouteight o'clock .and pull down theshades so as to keep out the sun andhot wind. When the windows areopened at five o'clock or thereaboutsthe house is cool and comfortablefor the evening.."Clothing worn in the summershould be light colored and loosefitting. Shoes should be given particular attantion. They should havea broad, low heel, a straight innerline and should be of kid, ratherthan canvas or heavier leather."During the summer a great manypeople make the mistake of eatingtoo many frozen foods and too manyiced drinks. These iced foods iftaken into the body to any extentretard the work of the digestivejuices, thereby slowing down 'all ofthe digestive processes, and ultimately making the person feel hotter,rather than cooler."oREAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONSThe Paris Realty Co. sold Fridayfor Lawrence Mitchell his two-storyresidence, located on Pleasant street,to the Methodist church, at a pricenot reported for publication.
