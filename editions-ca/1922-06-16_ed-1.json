DEATHS

That All Must Pay
WILMOTH
As peaceful as a child falls
into slumber, so death came at three
o'clock Wednesday morning, to Mrs.
Lamira Wilmoth, aged eighty-two,
at the Windsor Hotel, where she
had been making her home for
some time with her daughter, Mrs.
Robert Goggin. Mrs. Wilmoth had
been ill for several days, but her
condition had slightly improved un
til Wednesday morning, when Mrs.
Goggin, going to her mother's bed
side, found she had passed away.
Mrs. Wilmoth was a daughter of
the late Wm. P. and Hannah Daugh
ters, of Harrison county, and was
the widow of Samuel Wilmoth, for
many years a prominent business man
of Paris, the family residing in East
Paris. She was a woman of fine
Christian character, a woman whom
it was a 'pleasure to know. She was
a faithful and devoted member of
her church, not only faithful to her
church, but just as faithful in believing-
that it was her duty as a
Christian to do the4 will of the Mas
ter at all times. Hers was a loving
nature. She was always ready to
lend a helping hand in time of need
both in acts of kindness and in
kind words. Her devotion to her
family knew ho bounds, and there
was no limit to her affection. Her
retiring nature led her to hide her
best qualities from public g&zer but
they were revealed tothose who en
joyed her acquainanc,, yet it was in
ner Home that her true worth was
most conaniciousx She was nafiAnf

formerly of the Centre- College fac-
ulty, at Danville. Her father spent ,
his boyhood days in Paris. She
was lovely in a gown, of white crepe
de chine and her bouquet was of
white roses and sweet peas.
The ceremony took place before an
altar of flowers and ferns- in the
large living room, which was dec
orated with delphinium and pink
roses. Dr. R. L. Telford was the offi
ciating "minister, and the bride was
given in marriage by her father.
Only the members of the family
were present.
After the ceremony Mr. and Mrs.
Oldham left for a short bridal trip,
in their automobile, keeping their
destination a secret. On their re
turn they will be at home in Rich
mond. Among the out-of-town guests
present for the ceremony were Mr.
and Mrs. Emmett M. "Dickson and
Mrs. Benjamin Forsythe Buckner, of
Paris, relatives of the bride.
