izens' Bank, of Sharpsburg, qualified
as administrator of the estate of
-Nelson McLoney, who died from in
juries sustained in an automobile ac
cident six miles from Paris, two

automobile in which Mr. McLoney
was riding at the time of the accident
he refused to qualify, but later con
sentedlo act.
The law requires an administrator

.at the hands of another, and vhat
sum he will seek to recover for the

though the suit must be brought. If
tfie administrator fail to bring the suit
Jie or his sureties are liable for dam
ages when the infant heir becomes of

REPRESENTATIVE HERE.
A. representative of the American
Xia France Fire Engine Co., of Elmira,
N. Y., was in the city Tuesday in an
.effort to interest Mayor Hinton and
the members of the Fire Committee
of theCity Council in the product of
his company. He explained in detail
'the merits of a number of the best au
tomobile fie apparatus manufactured
by his company, and requested a
committee to go to Frankfort to in
spect the machine now in operation
in that city, and which was sold to
-that city by his company. Mayor
Hinton will head a committee that
."will 50 to Frankfort next week for
that purpose.
SEX HYGEINE OPPOSED.
The Eugenics Society of London
lias passed a resolution asking the
Minister of Education to consider
srays of presenting the idea of racial
responsibility in the schools. It was
stated at the meeting by delegates of
the National Union of the Teachers
and the London Teachers' Association
that any attempt to make sex hygiene
a subject in the elementary schools
-would be strenuously opposed by the
teachers. This shows that the teach
ers have studied young people and
forsee the harm that would be done
by any such teaching. None of those
who spoke for the Eugenics Society
had ever had experience in teaching
young people.
CASE SUBMITTED TO COURT.
The right of womem to vote for
county school superintendents is be
fore the Court of Appeals, having
been submitted Tuesday in the case
of Theo. Lewis, County Clerk of Fay
ette county, against Nannette McDow- J
ell Bullock, on appeal from the Fay
ette Circuit Court, which granted a
writ of mandamus to compel the clerk
to put the name of Nannette McDow
ell Bullock on a special primary ballot
for county school superintendent. The
clerk had refused, because thirty-six of
the thirty-seven names signed to her
.petition were the names of Avomen.

COURT OF APPEALS
DECIDES LIQUOR CASE.
The Court of Appeals Tuesday
morning reversed the Whitley Circuit
Court, which fined the Adams Express
Company for carrying liquor from
Tennessee into Willianburg. The
prosecution was instituted under the
Webb-Kenyon law. This is the first
case in Kentucky under the Federal
act prohibiting the interstate ship
ment of liquor into dry territory.
The court did not pass upon the con
stitutionality of the Webb-Kenyon act
because "we have reached the conclu
sion that the prosecution against the
Adams Express Company must fail
because this legislation is not appli
cable under the agreed facts."
The court said that it would treat
the Federa 1 statute as valid. The
agreed state of facts recited that the
liquor consigned to Jim Prewitt was
for his "personal use,"which under a
previous decision of the court is not a
violation of the Kentucky statute
against carrying liquor into a dry ter
ritory. Whether or not the carrier is
guilty of violating the law depends,
the court said, upon whether the use
to wrhich the liquor is to be put is
lawful or not.
May Ask For Quarantine.
Dr. Robert Graham, State Vetenari-1
an, has been sent to the Live Stock
Sanitary Board, East St. Louis and
Evansville, to investigate the charge
of shipping horses suffering from ca
tarrhal fever into Kentucky. Unless
the shipping of diseased horses to this
State is discontinued, the Live Stock
Sanitary Board will ask for Federal
quarantine. """

LIVED LIFE OF SOLITUDE.
"Mr. Ben Hollar, aged 82 years, a
farmer living near Barterville, Nicho
las county, died suddenly last v week,
death supposed to have been caused
from a stroke of apoplexy.
Mr. Hollar was born at the place
where he died, and lived the whole 82
years of his life on the farm. He had
never journeyed from home further
than seven miles, and on that occa
sion went to Headquarters to votj.
He never was in Carlisle, the county
seat of the county; he never saw a
railroad train; never put his foot in
side of a buggy; and it is said that he
never shaved or had his hair cut.
His life therefore, was one of solitude.
THROWN FROM HORSE.
Thrown by a horse he was riding,
the ten-year-old son of Geo. Gaunce, a
prominent Nicholas county farmer,
died almost instantly of injuries re
ceived. The accident took place near
the home of the young man's father,
near Salt Well, Nicholas county.
Discovery of a "zone of silence" in
the Alps is said to have been made by
workmen employed in the construction
of the highest section of the Jungfrau
railway. Heavy charges of bynamite
were set off with surprising results.
The detonations were heard within a
radius of thirty miles, then within a
zone of the next 41 miles there
was silence, but farther up to a con
centric circle of fifty miles"the noise
was again heard clearlv.
