TiF 2fir ?NrJC -.-sCouncil Again Orders FranchiseSold.By a vote f five to one the CityCouncil at its "meeting last nightpassed and ordered published an ordinance for the sale of a natural gasfranchise after the matter had .beenthe board at two previous meetings,the last time the order heing set asideby reason of a technical error. Thevote stood: Aye Baldwin. Hinton,Kenney, Parrish and Speakes, NayWalker. The matter ot passing this ordinancewas taken up towards the close of themeeting, Councilman Hinton presenting the franchise which was read andduly adopted, but not until two substitutes had been offered by Councilman Walker, both of which were lostthrough the absence of a secend.Mr. Hinton before offering the ordinance stated that he hadbeen in conference with Capt. John tonkin, manager of the Central 'Kentuckkv Natural Gas Co., who washi Paris yesterday for a short timearid that he hadthe franchise that jwould be acceptableto the company.lwhich, in substancewas the same as that uresented at theprevious meetings.Mr. Hinton stated that he was satisfied the company was in good faith andthe only objection made by Capt. Tonkin was against that part of the franchise which would not give the company the privilege to lay the mains inthe city until the pipe line were within a certain distance of the corporatelimits. According to his statementand in event the company acquires thefranchise it will begin the constructionat both ends of the line.When Mr. Hinton made the motionto order the sale of the franchise, Mr.Walker offered a substitute which provided that the number of heat units tobe in each cubic foot of gas be embodied in the franchise and this failinga second he offered another providingfor the erection of a retainer by thecompany purchasing the franchise, tohold enough gas to supDly the city'sdemand for a period of at least seventy-twohours, which he said, wouldeliminate the possibility of a shortageduring cold weather. This, too, lackeda second, and the original motion before the beard passed.Councilman Walker was on the aggressive during the entire session andregistered another strong objection tothe payment of the city hand3 weeklywithout the claims beinc allowed bythe Council in regular Bession andcited that it was a violation of the lawcontrary to the established rule thathas been in effect for several years,and under an ordinance ot resolutionpassed by the board to pay the cityhands each week. The minutes of ihelast meeting were adopted after a fewminor changes which were made att,he instance of Mr. Walker.Councilman Parrish, of the improvement committee, reported the boiler ofthe engine at the city quarry to be ina very had condition and asked thatmore time be granted that committeeto investigate and determine the costof repairing the machine before taking steps to install electric power orpurchase anothe engine.The report of Police Judge E. B.January for , the month of Februarywas presented to the Council as follows: Amount of fines assessed,?172; replevined, 10; collected , S52;suspended $64.50 ; worked out, $4.Stephen Moore was 'refused a permit to erect a stable on his property.The Council ordered the fire engineput in proper condition at a cost whichwill be in the neighborhood of $200.Building premits were granted asfollows: Mrs. Matie B. Hibler, twoone story rrame dwellings (JJiitonstreet, S.l, 000 each: J, W. Muir. twoframe dwellings between Walker Avenue an Eighth, $1,800 each ; O.

The vigorous manner in which theState fish and game laws have -beenenforced during, the last year cannotfail to have a salutary effect on thelawless element which has run rampant so long. Seining and dynamitingare much less common and such fish asare left in our rivers and small streamsare being given at last a chance, or ahalt chance for life.The violation of the law in this regard lias been so flagrant, so open andso long unrestrained that it will require time and vigilance to suppressthe seiners and dynamiters and the lawdefying fishermen of every character.It can be one, however, an the properway to do it is to keep up the crusadeagainst violations as energetically asithas been maintained since the creajtion of the State Fish and Game De-possible to proceedoffenders andto deal adequately with offenses.The'masses of the people are lawabiding and will indorse the work ofthe wardens in endeavoring to put anend to the ruthless slaughter of fish bythose who'are influenced by the desireor gain or the thirst for destruction.Twenty years ago many Kentuckystreams abounded with numerous varieties of fish, and many of these samestreams today are practically barrenof fish. This represents a distinctshrinkage in the public supply and agreat decline in the once popular pastime of fishing. A deplorable situation, it is true, but due altogether tothe neglect of one of our Valuable resources. .The way to remedy it is todo whatever can be done to makeamends for past neg'igence.--m m i. i i I J . imt Is9 llie -StOHfiaeii Z I IP' J&& IIS 14 Ny Ir.rAim to make that strong zA digestion good and youu-M keep well" !

Longfellow.Practical Ventilating Hint.The house should be ventilated Inwinter as well as in summer if thefamily is to be kept in good health.Bedrooms, especially, should be provided with a free circulation of freshair. One way to get fresh air in abedroom without having a draft is totack strips of cheesecloth across thetop and the bottom of the window sothat when it is opened in both placesthe fresh air will enter the room andyet, should there be a strong wind,its force will be broken by the cloth.Life, Accident, Health,Liability, Fire, Wind,Lightning :::::::::You judge a man not by what hepromises to do, but by what he hasdone.

If the theory that"like begets like" be true, he willproduce horses of this type whenmabsd with good mares. Through hisreins flow the biood of the greatesttrotting families.

Bless my soul!"scolded the peppery little old doctoras he stormed up and down the disordered breakfast room.His white locks grew more and morebelligerently erect as he excitedly ranhis fingers through his usually orderlyhair; his cheeks were flushed by hiswrath and his piercing blue-gray eyesflew storm signals of anger."Never heard the beat of it in mylife! never! the young cub!" hegrowled. "Here I've worked and slaved, and slaved and worked to give hima chance .and a good time, and thisis my thanks. Not even a by-your-leave!Bless me, It's it's maddening!" and the old doctor blew his nosewith a loud and valiant sound, whichyet somehow or other ended with acurious pathetic little squeak thatsuggested a very great anger mergedinto a very decided hurt."Of course, Maria, you quite agreewith him, I know," he trumpetedharshly in a vain endeavor to subduethe tremor in his voice, "but I mustsay I had a better opinion of yourjudement than to call that mannishElliott creature with her cigarette puffings, 'a sweet little thing and," herethe gruff voice took on an even harsher tone, "that Eric should dare to sayhe was bringing you a new daughterto help fill Nelsie's place our little,white, golden haired Nelsie!""But, my dear, I am sure you aremistaken. Indeed, I know you arejudging her wrongly ""Wrong nothing," snapped the doctor testily. "I hope I have enoughsolid horse sense to put two and twotogether when I see them. I've neverseen the creature myself and I hopeto goodness I never do, but Duncanwas telling me only yesterday that shecan bet and tipple and smoke to equalany of those young fools who hangaround her. Ugly tempered, too, saysshe leads her cousin who lives withthem a dog's life.""Now, father, I just knew you werejumping at conclusions," spoke up thegentle little Dresden lady in such aspirited and reproachful voice tharthedoctor's mouth opened in sheer amazement. "Oh, of course I know nothing, absolutely nothing; but this I do know,even if I am in my dotage, that thatmannish creature with her loud voiceand her sports isn't quite the idealdaughter of my dreams." The old manturned abruptly and left the room.Late that afternoon he made his wayslowly and wearily towards the sunbaked, tenement-choked district calledin town parlance "the poor's acre," andfor almost the first time in his sixtyhale years he felt the weariness of lifeand its utter and abject misery as itis vouchsafed to some. For years thispeppery little doctor, whose bark wasso much worse than his bite, hadworked among these poor of a greatcity. ,For a time he had sought help in hisself-assumed task from his little Dresden lady wife, but she had grieved soin her gentle way over their, to her,sordid and awful sufferings, that hehad comforted her as he might havedone a child, and had left, her in peaceat home.From that day he had never mentioned his poor in her presence, and asif to make up for her deficiencies, hehad thrown himself into his work withredoubled energy. But somehow oflate years he had felt more and morekeenly the need of a woman's love andguidance among them, and many atime a half unconscious sighing wishhad crept through his troubled mind."If only Nelsie had lived to be a comrade and a help."With stooped shoulders and laggingsteps he mounted the dark stairs ofthe first tenement house, and a shrinking dread of his visit and of what hemust see filled him. He could picturethe scene quite, vividly, he assuredhimself, and he sighed impatiently athis own Impotence."The baby will be crying, Tommyand Sue will be a little bit dirtier thanusual, and a good deal crosser, whileTimmy, poor wee lad, will be a tiny bitquieter and just as thoughtful as ever.If only their mother could have someone to take care of her, figurativelyand literally, she'd stand a chance ofgetting better, and if she doesn't mayGod help them all! If only Nelsie hadlived," sighed Nelsie's father as he reluctantly opened the door, and thensuddenly his sharp gray eyes filmed,for the sun's rays showed him a Nel-sie-likegolden head bent over a sleeping baby by the uncurtained window,while around and about peace and order reigned."Well, bless my soul!" quoth thedoctor in a husky whisper, and he laidhis hand very tenderly upon littlecrippled Timmy's head, whose usuallypale face was crimson with the suppressed excitement of his present wonderful happiness. "It's Miss Delight,doc," he whispered shrilly, "and she'sgoin' to take keer on us till mammy'sbetter, cos she said so, n' she brung usa chicken pie for dinner."The doctor tiptoed across the creaking even floor, and all the tirednessand the fiery petulance died out underthe warmth of his kind, grave-smile."Miss Delight?" he queried."Elliott," cmiled the girl with theNelsie-like golden hair. "You will notbe cross because I wanted to help inNelsie's place, as Eric has told me,"she begged."Eric!" said the doctor slowly. "Elliott, are you Eric's but, but shesmokes," stammered the doctor in confusion, "and she ""Adriane Elliott is my cousin," answered the girl, quietly.Then the old doctor laughed alonein shamefaced but utter happiness.JIMSIE'S STEPMOTHERBy JOHN TROU.An hour or two after he had sentAnne Mayfield enough roses to fillher little studio, Don Rogers decidedto drop in for a cup of tea, not thathe cared for .the tea, but under coverof the talk of the dozen or more hewas sure to find there, he couldwatch Anne and revel in her beautyand charnuAnne was going to marry the Hononable Richard Bachman, a widowerwith a boy eight or nine years old.Laird Robbins had told him confidentially that he was in the jeweler'swhen the elderly lover ordered "ToAnne" inscribed in a circle of diamonds. Anne met him at the door, ond overher head Dan saw Bachman by thewindow, pinching off a rosebud, out ofhis own late purchase, to put in thelapel of his frock coat."If you're engaged, Anne," he saidpointedly, "I'd better not go in today." "Come right in this minute," urgedAnne cordially. "You can go to market with me in a little while, and thenstay to dinner if you will."Bachman had his hat in his handready to leave."You think It is pretty, then, MissAnne?" Don heard him ask at thedoor."It's lovely," said Anne with enthusiasm. "You've shown splendidtaste."Anne shut the door quietly andfaced Don, laughter wrinkling up thecorners of her eyes."Isn't this place a bower of beautyand fragrance? Your roses have madeit summer here even if it is winter inthe rest of the world. They're lovely,Don. What's the matter? Your faceis so long and solemn.""Blue devils, I guess," he answeredshortly. "Mind if I smoke?""Never did, did I? Puff away, butI'll have you know that if there areany blue devils in this box of anapartment, you brought them ,in yourpockets. I ran them all out thismorning and watched them freeze todeath on the window sill.""You're mighty gay) this afternoon,aren't you?""Yes, sir, for I have a contractwith a big new magazine to furnish apage of my cuties in every issue forthe next six months."What a clever girl you are, Anne!That pencil of yours has made thoselittle figures of people famous overthe country."The door opened unceremoniouslyand Jimsie Bachman, the son andheir to the vast estates of the Honorable Richard, appeared."Hello, Miss Anne! Got any cakes?""I certainly, have. Come in andI'll get you seme. You know Mr.Rogers, don't you?""So you have a sweet tooth', Jimmy," said Rogers affably."My name's not Jimmy, it's Jimsie.I saw it in the Bible. I'm all the timehaving 'to tell my right name tofolks."While Anne went foraging forcakes, Jimsie turned his back to thefire, hands clasped behind him, inthe most approved man fashion."Miss Anne's helping dad get married," he asserted with the importance of one giving vital news."Really.V responded the man icily."Yes, she's helped him a lot 'bouts'lecting the ring and all," went onthe loquacious youngster. "The lady'sa friend of Miss Anne's. That's whyshe's so inter'sted."" "Who whom is your father goingto marry?" demanded' Rogers, suddenly. "I promised not to tell anythingabout it to anybody," returned Jimsie, loftily."I'll give you a dollar to tell methe truth.""Gee! I'd a told for fifty cents,"said Jimsie quickly forgetting hisconscience. "It's Miss Anne Bradner,she lives in another town. Where'sthe money?""Here you are, Jimsie," said Anne,coming in just then. "I brought youa box full of cakes to take on thetrain tonight when you and your father go visiting.""What have you done with yourblue devils?" she demanded, turningback from closing the door on herdiminutive guest and facing a manwith a very different expression fromthe one he had worn half an hour before. "Did you give them to Jimsie?He's very accommodating.""Very," he answered, and then ashe watched her adjust a fur toque onher dark hair. "Are we going to market now to buy a fat pig?""No, not that," corrected Anne. "Ineed a few extras and I've been toobusy to go out today."She fastened a great crimson rosein her furs. "I have to take onewith me," she said."'To you it is a rose, to me, it ismy heart,' " he quoted."That's pretty sentiment, isn't it,vDon? You know so many beautifulthings to say to women. I wonderwhat you will say to the one womanwhen she comes into your life!""What every other man has saidbefore me, just that I love her andwant her. Won't that be enough?""Yes," answered Anne on guardagainst his apparent indifference, "ifshe loves you.""Anne," he called, and at thehusky note in his voice, she lifted hereyes to his, "Anne, I love you and Iwant you. Is it enough?""f-thlnk," Anne's answer came fromsomewhere in the region of his "coatcollar, "that I have waited ten thousand years to hear you sajf that"gtu&WonderfulSuits at$25.00We try each season to seevalue we can put in suits to$25,00mrrmwszuIt's a price many women like, to pay, and they are entitled to the best that money can buy. 29i Thislseason we have succeeded in producing somewonderful suits7at $25.00.

Herquick glance rested immediately uponMeyers and the boy. And in thatmoment some instinct prompted JockMcChesney to shake his head, everso slightly, and assume a blanknessof expression. And Emma McChesney, with that shrewdness which hasmade her one of the best salesmen onthe road, saw, and miraculously understood. "How do, Mrs. McChesney," grinned Fat Ed Meyers. "You see, I beatyou to it.""So I see," smiled Emma, cheerfully. 'I was delayed. Just sold a nicelittle bit to "Watkins down the street."She seated herself across the way,and kept her eyes on that closed door."Say, kid," Meyers began, in thehusky whisper of the fat man, "I'mgoing to put you wise to something,seeing you're new to this game. Seethat lady over there?" He nodded discreetly in Emma McChesney's direction. "Pretty, isn't she?" said Jock, appreciatively. "Know who she is?""Well I she does look familiar,but ""Oh, come now, quit your bluffing.If you'd ever met that dame you'dremember it. Her name's McChesneyEmma McChesney, and she sells T.A.

And atj that she's straight, too."If Ed Meyers had not been gazingi so Intently into his hat, trying at theI same time to look cherubically benigni he might have seen a quick and painful scarlet sweep the face of the boy,coupled with a certain tense look ofthe muscles around the jaw."Well, now, look here," he went on,still in a whisper. "We're both skirtmen, you and me. Everything's fairin this game. Maybe you don't knowit, but when there's a bunch of theboys waiting around to see the headof the store like this, and there happens to be a lady traveler in thecrowd, why, it's considered kind of aprofessional courtesy to let the ladyhave, the first lookin. See?""I get you," answered Jock."I say, this is business, and goodmanners be hanged.

SEATBILL'S OLD X-RAY MULEBY C. g; GRANT."I'm just in from Plumville," saidthe traveling man. "I heard a mulestory while I was in that tovn."The city marshal one day lastsummer said to Big Bill McCune infront of Hickey's grocery: 'Bill, if youdon't keep that 6V mule o' your'n offth' streets of this hyar corporation I'llhave th' law on ye.'"Big Bill bit off a whacking bigchew of tobacco before he drawledout: 'Well, if you do, I'll git churegoat.'"That evening Jerry, Big Bill's mule,did not return to the barn. He passedthe night in the village pound, a pasture largely infested with weeds andhemmed round wi-h a hedge of tallburdocks."The. next morning Big Bill startedout exploring and soon found Jerryrolling round contentedly in the weeds.They tickled his ribs, which had attained undue prominence while rambling the streets of Plumville in searchof juicy grass."When Big Bill saw Jerry so contented he said to himself: 'Guess I'llleave the old fellow there for the restof the week. I'll be out to Hen Cal-lister's, anyway, diggin' that well.'"That afternoon Aunt Betty Brownhappened to pass the lot where oldJerry was nibbling. The sight of theforlorn creature with his sharp horizon outlines touched her heart and shewaddled home for something to hidethe mule's X-rays. Soon his bone pilewas concealed beneath a couple ofgunny sacks."Every night the city marshal tallied up another day's board againstold Jerry. 'At 25 cents a day, that willmake pretty nigh five dollars ag'in th'end of th month,' he said."By the middle of the next monththe marshal announced that he wouldauction off old Jerry to pay for hisfeed. There was a bill against himfor $7.25 and it was growing largerevery day. The auction was set fortwo o'clock Saturday afternoon."Colonel Wilson was auctioneer." 'Crowd up around here, gentle-,men!' he shouted. 'Now, how mucham I offered to start this mule? He'sguaranteed not to scare at automobiles or thrashin' machines. He's afamily animal through and through.Now, what do I hear to start him?""There came a deep silence, whileseveral of the farmers tried to lift thegunny sack that concealed Jerry'sstriking points." 'Gentlemen,' said the colonel, 'wesell Jerry just as he" stands, fly netsand all. How much am I bid to starthim?'" 'Twenty-five cents,' said old JackPembl"The colonel fiddled around for tenminutes trying to get another bid, butthey were not game sports. 'Twentyfive once, twenty-five twice, twentyfive three times! Are you all. done?Sold to Jack Pemble for 25 cents!'"If you happen to be motoring alongthe road five miles from Plumville andsee an old mule standing patientlynear a corn crib while half a dozenchildren pull themselves up by hisears and slide down over his sidesyou'll know it's Jack Pemble's place."Sweet Thing."This piece of lace on my dress ismore than fifty years old." "It's beautiful.

Presidentelect Wilson is not one of those whohold the figure in awe. On the contrary, he says it is a sign of fortunefor him, and so it would seem, in thathe takes the highest office in the year1913. There are some who go to ex-,tremes in avoiding conflict with anything containing the ominous numeral.A movement has been started in London for the suppression of the number. It has even been suggested thatthe London county council be petitioned to authorize some change out ofdeference to the uncourageous. Manypeople are writing to the London papers suggesting means of escape. Onewho has been exploring historywrites: "I have searched for recordsof the years 13 B. C, 13 A. D., 1300and 1313, and find them to have beenhopelessly commonplace years, duringwhich the world apparently slumberedtranquilly. The notable event of 1413was the crowning of Henry V., but hecan not be called a disaster. Theyear 1813 saw the beginning of Napoleon's collapse, but this was a disaster which was confined to Napoleon,and rather a good thing for everybody else. All things considered, Ithink we may look forward withoutanxiety to 1913, which opens with thehappiest auguries a boom in tradeand the probable collapse, of the present government."Dally Thought.Misery disposes us to hatred andhappiness to love. rMacaulay. - -2 Seasons in New York.6 months in Chicago.I Year in Berlin andVienna.iJiuiLm.iMLi.mwmie-9k. .. - h a U-J fc mar iiyGrand, Tuesday, March 1 SthfE?
