Murderer of Two Girls Bigs on thaScaffold Justice at Last Overtakes thaCriminal of the CenturySan Quentin Prison Cal Jan 8When W H T Durant awoke at 620Friday morning he was apparentlygreatly refreshed by his nights sleepwhich had been sound and peacefulthroughout the night His last nightupon earth had been one of excitement as he had been visited by his parents a minister and newspapermenfor some hours and did not retire until midnight half an hour after hismother had left himAt 930 a m Warden Hale visitedthe death chamber for the purpose ofreading the death warrant to the condemned man who listened to the wellknown contents of that document withrespectful attention no outward signof fearWhen it was finally decided thatDurrant should accept the Catholicfaith his parents met Father Laganin the wardens office and accompaniedhim to the death chamber where theprisoner was given extreme unctionand the Catholic service performedDurrant evinced the most lively interest in the service He then conversedwith his parents for a few minutesand shortly after 10oclock bade themfarewell for the last time and preparedfor his march to the scaffoldThere was no scene at the gallowsMrs Durrant did not witness the execution She remained in a room inthe lower part of the prison and showed unmistakable signs of grief tempered with a dogged desire to create theimpression that she was too proud toweepAt 1034 oclock the frail door thatguards the threshold of the gallowsroom swung open and the little partyconducting Durrant to the gallows entered Father Lagan led draped incassock and surplice and chanting theprayers for the dying Durrant hisfather a friend Warden Hale and theguards followed The father and hisfriend left the party and walkedaround the galiows to the frontwhile the condemned man andhis escort climbed the 13 stepsthat led to the platform andthe waiting trap At last TheodoreDurrant stood upon the gallows Hegave no signs of weakening Hisslight figure was as erect as though ithad been his marriage morning Thebroad leather strap that bound hisarms to his sides allowed his wristssome play and his fingers wrestedlightly on the strap Five minuteslater when his body was swinginglike a pendulum beneath the trap thefingers now all blue and chilled looking still rested where he had placedthem as he left the cell Instantly upon arriving upon the gallows therope was knotted about his neck Themurderer held his chin high in the airto make room for the stiff new lineknotted in the peculiar fashion of thehangman By an unusual privilegethe condemned man was permitted towear a low collar opening in frontand a white satin tie His face waspale but it was not the ashy paleness of terror It was the face-of a man who knowing that hehas a momentous thing to

Its jollyCelia disappeared into tihe roamWhat said Martin stopping in thegravel path below where he was smoking in solitude Do you want meI dont want you particular IsaidOh I thought you said you did saidMartinDid you speak George said Celiaemerging again upon the balconyXo yes I said It is so difficult totell the whole truth in a single wordI thought jou said you didnt wantme said CeliaOf course 1 want you I said Comealpng its delightfully quiet and pleasantWhy tihe blazes cant you say whatyou mean if you mean anything atall said Martin from belowI hate explanations and as it was obviously impossible to continue the conversation under existing conditions 1determined to wait until tfee conditionsaltered themselves The more especially as I found mj lounge chair exceedingly comfortable after a day in thebicycle saddle my cigar did not belieits brand and a waiter appeared on thesteps with coffee for three Doctors willoccasionally tell you not of coursevour own doctor that if you leave yoursymptoms alone lie on your back anadont worry they will always fight to afinish one way or the other So situations will always explain themselves- if you wait long enough and dont fidgetthecnThe moon brushed aside a cloud andset to work to illuminate the sea in realearnest behind me Avas the subduedshatter of the hotel guests who werefiltering out of the dining room from-the distance came the cheerful click ofbilliard balls and from below soundeditihe soft ripple of waves upon shingileIt was delightfulWhat are you driviling about saidMartin as he came up the steps of theverandaGeorge do you want me or dontyou asked Celia appearing throughfife ball doorway I cant make outwhat you meanHere is tihe coffee I said I amvery glad you have both come I foundmyself involved in a dialogue with twopeopleO George And you such a pedant saicf Celia Shouldnt it be atriologue or somethingNo it shouldnt I said I find my-self involved in a dialogue with twopeople who are cut of hearing of oneanother and the scheme doesnt workYou cant carry on a rational conversation that way As soon as you get intoiouch with one you find out that thebther By Jove that seems to illustrate something or other I wonderIt only illustrates your incapacityto grapple in a practical manner withtlje simplest difficulty said MartinNow if you had said loudly and distinctly I am sitting in the verandaanswering two people my wife andMartin Howard let them both comehither why themThen said I glancing at the menwho were loafing in tihe doorway theywould have sent for the manager and Ishould have been put under proper controlIf you hadnt had the inspirationsaid Martim to manry a wife with morethan ordinary common sense youSugar said Celia who was pouring out the coffeeThats night I said We wontqiuarxel This is really the best partof the day Thats what I like aboutcycling Its so jolly when its overand jou have dinner and smoke andplay billiards aind Martin we mighthave a hundred up presently Theresa very gC od table hereSeems a good sort of hotel allround said Martin Im glad youtli ought of asking me down Excellentsmoking room too conisidering the sizeof the placeCelia nose and leaned over the railing of the veranda Below a coupleof girls were walking up and downThsey had shawls over their heads andwere talking in whispers The menhad scattered from the doorwaj and Icould see two or three ladies of middleage sitting in the hall and readingI knew the books I hadiieen them on the shelves of the locallibraryWhats the meaning of that- sighMrs Matthews said MartinCelia turned and leaning with herback against tihe balustrade wrinkledher browsWh ein they invented hotels saidCelia 1 tih ink thej forgot that women4would sometimes stay in themMartin placed his head at theangleBut Shis hotel I objected is advertised as specially adapted for ladiesand childrenI ai not an invalid said Celia and1 dont want to go to bed and if Idontgo to rd now what am I to doXhc hotel I continued containsaSWr ialifts electric lights electric bells bathrooms all the latest sanitaryPcmf said Celia I suppose yjusuggest that I should go up and downin the lift by way of amusement andring the electric bell for a chambermaid to talk to me by way of conversation while you and Mr Howard areplaying billiards or drinking whiskyand soda in the smoking roomI think I see your point said Martin There is clearly a deficiencysomewhere What about a ladiessmoking room and a ladies billiardroomWell why not said Celia after amoments reflection Two women outof every three smoke amd theres nothing absolutely immoral about billiardsis there You see women want rational enjoyment as well as men wthereasNaturally said MartinBut why a ladies smoking roomsaid Celia Why not have the samesmoking room for Celia contemplated the point of her shoe I caughtMartins eyejNo I suppose not said Celia ButthinTheres the drawing room I saidA noble apartmentIve just come from there saidCelia It contains three dowdy oldyladies and that poor girl who is so satupon by her mother For ten min-ites no one spoke And then I had to icome away or scream What wouldyou have done if I had screamedGeorgeNow thats very curious I said Ishould have thought you would havedone much as we do in the smokingroom told one another stories and stoodone a nother coffee and so onBut I had never spoken to them Ididnt even know their names saidCeliaAll the more reasonGeorge you dont understand women one little bitIt seems clear said Martin thathotels were not- built for women Ihadnt thought of it in that light before but now tliat you point it outMrs MatthewsI should really like said Celia tobr lid a hotel on my own lines and manage it so that women had an equalchance of enjoying it with men Yousee hotels are built by men for menand the consequence is that women areexpected to content themselves with adrawing room where there is no one tospeak to and a back number of theQueemI seem to remember I said a placethat is run by women for women andit didnt appear to be uncommonly livel3r or sociableWhere asked CeliaYou took me thereI repliedO the club said Celia lookingthoughtfulThere is no billiard room I continued and you cant get anything decentto eat or drink you never drop in onfMPOTJF SAID CELIAwinter afternoon for a game of whistin fact no one ever seems to go thereexcept on xVt Home days when thereare men to talk to No I dont thinkyour hotel would be very popularCeliaPerhaps said Martin there arefaults oh both sides If hotels are notbuilt for women perhaps women arenot built for hotelsWhat do you mean asked CeliaI mean said Martin that perhapswomen in a hotel are a little well outof placeThank you said CeliaOr rather out of their element Yousee if I want a game of billiards I justgo into the billiard room and ask thefirst likely man I find if he wTill have agame And then the winner stands theloser a drink It doesnt matter in theleast to me if he has well run awayfrom his wifeI dont see wliat that has to do withit said CeliaIts the very kernel of the whole matter I said The essential conditionof hotel life is that people should takeeach other at their face value Nowwomen are always fidgeting lest theother women should be forgeries Lookhere Celia supposing there were aladies billiard room here do you thinkit would be more cheerful tlhan thedrawing roomOf course it would said Celiathere would be something to doBut would anyone do it I askedWould you Celia walk up to the firstcasual stranger you found and inviteher to a gameCelia looked thoughtfully at the bookin her hand opening it and shutting italternately and said nothingThen it wont be any good alteringhotels I said unless wc alter womenat the same timeFor my own part said Martir Ifind them both very pleasant as theyareCelia gave a little laugh Well shesaid I suppose I had better go andread in bed It seems the only thing todo Dont be too late George Blackand WhiteyvJM iSliSiJjHjfcMlA

conditions 1determined io wait until Une conditionsaltered themselves The more especially as I found my lounge chair exceedingly comfortable after a day in thebicycle saddle my cigar did not belieits brand and a waiter appeared on thesteps with coffee for three Doctors willoccasionally tell you not of coursevour own doctor that if you leave yoursymptoms alone lie on your back anadont worry they will always fight to afinish one way or the other So situations will always explain themselvesif you wait long enough and dont fidgetthemThe moon brushed aside a cloud andset to work to illuminate the sea in realearnest behind me was the subduedchatter of the hotel guests who werefiltering out of tihe dining room from-the distance came the cheerful click ofbilliard balls and from below soundedtihe soft ripple of waves upon shingileIt was delightful -What are you driviling about saidMartin as he came up the steps of theverandaGeorge do you warot me or dbntyou asked Celia appearing throughthe hall doorway I cant make outwhat you meanHere is tihe coffee I said I amvery glad you have both come I foundmyself involved in a dialogue with twopeople0 George And you such a pedant said Celia Shouldnt it be atriologue or somethingNo it shouldnt I said I find my-self involved in a dialogue with twopeople who are cut of hearing of oneanother and the scheme doesnt workYou cant carry on a rational conversation that way As soon as you get intotouch with one you find out that thether By Jove that seems to illustrate something or other I wonderVlt only illustrates your incapacityto grapple in a practical manner withtJje simplest difficulty said MartinNow if you had said loudly and distinctly I am sitting in the verandaanswering two people my wife andMartin Howard let them both comehither why theinThen said I glancing at the menwho were loafing in tlhe doorway theywould have sent for the manager and Ishould have been put under proper controlIf you hadnt had the inspirationsaid Martiin to manry a wife with morethan ordinary common sense youSugar said Celia who was pouring out the coffeeThats night I said We wontquarrel This is really the best pairtof the day Thats what I like aboutcycling Its so jolly when its overand you have dinner and smoke andplay billiards and Martin we mighthave a hundred up presently Theresa very good table hereSeems a good sort of hotel allround said Martin Im glad youtb ought of asking me down Excellentsmoking room too considering the sizeof the placeCelia rose and leaned over the railing of the veranda Below a coupleof girls were walking up and downThey had shawls- over their heads andwere talking in whispers The menhad scattered from tihe doorway and Icould see two or three ladies of middlea e sitting in the hall and reading spasmodically I knew the books I hadiieen them on the shelves of the locallibraryWhats the meaning of that sighMrs Matthews said MartinCelia turned and leaning with herback against tihe balustrade wrinkledher browsWheu they invented hotels saidCelia I tih ink they forgot that womenwould sometimes stay in themMartin placed his head at the critical angle-But fTliis hotel I objected is advertised as specially adapted for ladiesand childrenI an not an invalid said Celia and1 dont want to go to bed and if I dontro to Jd now what am I to doaXhe hotel I continued coicontainsBTTlifts electric lights electric bells bathrooms all the latest sanitaryPcnif said Celia I suppose yqnsuggest that I should go up and downin the lift by way of amusement andring the electric bell for a chambermaid to talk to me by way of conversartion while you and Mr Howard areplaying billiards or drinking whiskyand soda in the smoking roomI think I see your point said Martin There is clearly a deficiencysomewhere What about a ladiessmoking room and a ladies billiardroomWell why not said Celia after amoments reflection Two women outof every three smoke amd theres nothing absolutely immoral about billiardsis there You see women waut rational enjoyment as well as men whereasNaturally said MartinBut why a ladies smoking roomsaid Celia Why not have the samesmoking room for Celia contemplated the point of her shoe I caughtMartins eyeNo I suppose not said Celia ButthenTheres the drawing room I saidA noble apartmentIve just come from there saidCelia It contains three dowdy oldladies and that poor girl who is so satupon by her mother For ten irunites no one spoke And then I had tocome away or scream What wouldyou have done if I had screamedGeorgeNow thats very curious I said Ishould have thought you would havedone much as we do in the smokingroom told one another stories and stoodone another coffee and- so onBut I had never spoken to them Ididnt even know their names saidCeliaAll the more reasonGeorge you dont understand women one little bitIt seems clear said Martin thathotels were not built for women Ihadnt thought of it in that light before but now tliat you point it outMrs MatthewsI should really like said Celia tobrild a hotel on my own lines and manage it so that women had an equalchance of enjoying it with men Yousee hotels are built by men for menand the consequence is that women areexpected to content themselves with adrawing room where there is no one tospeak to and a back number of theQueemI seem to remember I said a placethat is run by women for women andit didnt appear to be uncommonly lively or sociableWhere asked CeliaYou took me thereI replied0 the club said Celia lookingthoughtfulThere is no billiard room I continued and you cant get anything decentto eat or drink you never drop in onSftPOUF SAID CELIAwinter afternoon for a game of whistin fact no one ever seems to go thereexcept on At Home days when thereai e men to talk to NTo I dont thinkvour hotel would be very popularCeliaPerhaps said Martin there arefaults oh both sides If hotels are notbuilt for women perhaps women arenot built for hotelsWhat do you mean asked CeliaI mean said Martin that perhapswomen in a hotel are a little well outof placeThank you said CeliaOr rather out of their element Yousee if I want a game of billiards I justgo into the billiard room and ask thefirst likely man I find if he will have agame And then the winner stands theloser a drink It doesnt matter in theleast to me if he has well run awayfrom his wifeI dont see wliat that has to do withit said CeliaIts the very kernel of the whole matter I said The essential conditionof hotel life is that people should takeeach other at their face value Nowwomen are always fidgeting lest theother women should be forgeries Lookhere Celia supposing there were aladies billiard room here do you thinkit would be more cheerful tlhan thedrawing roomOf course it would said Celiathere would be something to doBut would anyone do it I arkedWould you Celia walk up to the firstcasual stranger you found and inviteher to a gameCelia looked thoughtfully at the bookin her hand opening it and shutting italternately and said nothingThen it wont be am good alteringhotels I said unless we alter womenat the same timeFor my own part said Martir Ifind them both verj pleasant as tbeyareCelia gave a little laugh Well shesaid I suppose I had better go andread in bed It seems the only thing todo Dont be too late George BJackand White-THE BOTJIIBON NEWS TUESDAY JANUARY 11 1898A TALE THEY TELL IN

beenmade in Rhode Island where a courseor construction in practical road-buildinghas been instituted in the Agricultural college at Kingston and the papers announce with justifiable exultation that this state leads the worldin such an undertaldngThe course of instruction is to extendoer two years and has been laid outafter consultation with Gen Stone Inthe class room theoretical instructionwill be provided and the road makingplant of the college will furnish ampleopportunity for the acquirement orpractical knowledge Students whowish to enter the course must be wellgrounded in the common branches including algebra and geometry Duringthe first year the course will includehigher geometry trigonometry surveying and other English studies Inthe second year physics electricityphysiogrophy geology mineralogy andsteam engineering will be taken Thepractical work will run side by sidewith the theoretical during the courseIt will include actual work on theroads handling the shovel drivinghorses running the stone crusher traction engine and road roller and allmachinery operated by the departmentThe student will thus actually performall the varied operations connectedwith road building as well as receivecompetent instruction in all that pertains to the art In this way not onlywill a large number of young men receive most valuable training but a demand will probably quickly arise forspecial instruction for older men whonow are superintendents of streetscommissioners of highways and engineersThere is here a field which is notyet crowded or even full As the Providence Journal remarks of late yearsthere has been a demand for competent road builders all through thestates that have been constructingmacadam highways In most instanceseither theoretical engineers or highwaysuperintendents have risen to fill theplaces And to the sorrow and costs ofthe big cities and the disappointmentof the counties in many instances thelatter have been compelled to pay for2SHEKANDOAH PIKEOne of the Famous Old Roads of Americathe lack of practical knowledge of thecivil engineers and the lack of theoretical knowledge of the highway supervisorsBut even with this school of menwho have been educated to build theroads there have not been enough togo around in all the localities wheregood roads aire needed and where thereis money to build them A man whothoroughly understands road construction to day may easilj get a positionWhat is needed is the educated manwho not only knows how to build a costly ideal road but one who can economical construct an eight foot countryroad a man who knows both the theoretical and practical end of road construction This is the style of graduate which the Rhode Island institution aims to turn out At theend of the course they will have graduated a man who can plan the highwaydraw the contracts and who is ableto run the machinery to build the roada man who knows the business fromthe hoe handle to ifae tripod from shoveling

with the machinery men whoknow all about operating it As a milethe men they send out are shop handsand beyond the rule-of-thumb experience with these identical machinesthey know but little The builders eaythere is a constant demand for roadbuilders with these plants and thatthey consider that this is -a good fieldfor young menBut the largest field lor men educated as road builders will probablybe found as highway superintendentsamong the various counties and townsThere are few first class men in this lineand with the spread of the good roadjmovement the demand for such expertsis

that the treesare not frozen And in a majority ofcases it is better to prune at this timethan later But with the peach as arule the better plan is to wait untilthe danger of severe freezing is pastin the spring The principal reason forthis is that the new growth of woodof the peach is easily injured by freezing and in pruning it is always bestfirst to remove all dead or injured woodand then a sufficient amount of otheiwood to secure an open spreadinghead The peach requires rather moresevere pruning than any other varietyof fruit Unless properly pruned thetrees will have few long stragglingbranches with leaves and fruit on thends of the limbs and little or none onthe rest of the tree The reason of thisis that the new shoots come outstrongest from the terminal buds thelargest shoots of the previous year becoming the largest the succeedingyear so that in a short time the fruitis out of reach as it is the habit of thepeach to bear fruit on the previousseasons growth of woodPrune in the spring cutting outfirst all dead or diseased wood and thncutting back the new growth until thedesired form is obtained Usually fromone third to one half of the newgrowth can be cut back with benefitand more and better fruit be securedthan if the tree is allowed to grow usit pleases N J Shepherd in OhioFarmerAMERICAN BEET SUGARIn a Fevr Years Its Production WillBe a Great IndustryIn America about one fourth of allthe sugar produced throughout theworld is consumed four fifths of thisamount is imported at an annual costof 135000000 In 1880 two thirds ofthe sugar used came from sugar caneand one third from beet roots in 1897the proportions are exactly reversedyet while France Germany and Austriahave been developing their beet sugarindustries until they practically controlthe trade all over the world the UnitedStates having far richer beet sugarlands boasts an annual output of onlyabout 40000 tonsWithin the past few years the department of agriculture has carried on anexhaustive series of experiments overdifferent parts of the country suitablefor the growth of the sugar beet Theseexperiments have conclusively demonstrated that this important staple canbe grown in profitable quantities andof the highest grade over a considerablearea of the United States There is infact nothing to prevent this countryfrom becoming the largest beet-sugar-producingland in the world With thesame encouragement France has givento the industry America might have700 factories instead of seven which isnow her limitIt has been estimated that it wouldrequire from 1000000 to 1250000 acresdevoted to beet culture to produce thesugar necessary for home consumptionThis would mean an addition to theagricultural income of the country of50000000 or

a vast difference between thetwo organic heart disease is often incurable apparent heart disease is curable ifgood digestion be restoredA case in point is quoted from the NewEra of Greensburg Ind Mrs Ellen Colfiom Newpoint Ind a woman forty threeyears old had suffered for four years withdistressing stomach trouble The gases generated by the indigestion pressed on theheart and caused an irregularity of its actionShe had much pain in her stomach and heartand was subject to frequent and severe choking spells which were most severe at nightDoctors were tried in vain the patient became worse despondent and feared impending deathA CASE OF HEART FAILUREShe was much frightened but noticed thatin intervals in which her stomach did notannoy her her hearts action became normalReasoning correctly that her digestion wasalone at fault she procured the proper medicine to treat that trouble and with immediate good results Her appetite came backthe choking spells became less frequent andfinally ceased Her weight which had beengreatly reduced was restored and she nowweighs more than for years Her blood soonbecame pure and her cheeks rosyThe case is of general interest because
