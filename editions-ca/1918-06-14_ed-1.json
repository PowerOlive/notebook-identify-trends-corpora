Expert clerical work has a more
important place in the Government's
war organization than most people
realize. We all know that the war
can not be won in the trenches alone;
that an effective establishment at
home is vital to the success of the
biggest job ever undertaken by any
I nation; but the full extent to which
the specialized clerk is needed is
perhaps not generally understood.
And it is in this class of work that
women have the best opportunity to
be of real service to the Government
at this time.
In the national capital alone the
civilian force increased from 30,000
to nearly 80,000 during the first
year of our participation in the war.
Nine-tenths of the new employes are
clerks of one kind or another and
typists are at work constantly in Gov
ernment offices at Washington on the
tons Of correspondence and records
made necessary by war preparations
on a scale such as the world has
never before known.
General clerks, that is, those with
out a specialty, are not difficult to
obtain even under present conditions,
but the United States Civil Service
Commission, charged with the duty
of recruiting the civil service to meet
war needs, is experiencing difficulty
in obtaining a sufficient number of
applications for many clerical posi
tions which require special training
or experience. There is an urgent
call for applicants foj the positionc
of stenographer, typewriter, bookkeeper-typewriter,
. clerk-bookkeeper,
cost accountant, accounting and sta
tistical clerk, statistician, clerk
qualified in accounting, clerk qualifi
ed in business administration, index
and catalogue clerk, schedule clerk,
passenger-rate clerk, blue-print file
clerk, and assistant to business man
ager. All of these positions are open
to both men and women. Represen
tatives of the Civil Service Commis
sion at the post offices in all cities
are prepared to furnish definite in
formation and application blanks.
MORRIS STUART.
The Indianapolis, Ind., Daily
News, of Monday has the following
notice of the wedding in that city
Sunday night of Corporal John M.
Stuart, of Paris, to Miss Bobbie Mor
ris, formerly of Paris:
"A military wedding at the Metro
pole hotel barracks added interest to
the festivities that marked the close
of the first vocational school for se
lective service men Sunday night,
when Corporal John M. Stuart, of
Faris, Ky., and Miss Bobbie Morris,
807 East Fourteenth - street, were
married. The ceremony was per
formed by the Rev. Frederick E.
Webb, pastor of the College Avenue
Baptist church, in the presence of a
number of the 437 men who are, at
tending the training school, officers
of the barracks and relatives of the
bride and bridegroom. The wedding
march was played by Mrs. Clifford A.
Gross, wife of the present command
ing officer of the barracks, and the
bride was presented by both her fa
ther and Lieutenant Miles, who was
officer of the day. Corporal Stuart's
parents, Mr. and Mrs. George W.
Stuart, of Paris, were present. Cor
poral Stuart is a nephew of Mrs, Al
bert S. Miller, of Crawfordsville.
He will leave to-night with a de
tachment for Camp Hancock, Georgia."
DEATHS.
SNAPP.
Sarah E. Snapp, aged one year,
died of pneumonia, at 1:30 o'clock
Wednesday afternoon, at the home of
her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Leslie
Snapp, on Lilleston avenue. The
funeral was held yesterday after
noon at four o'clock, with services
conducted at the grave in the Paris
Cemetery by Rev. W. E. Ellis, of the
Paris Christian church.
There are now 5,000 prisoners of
war in England -working in agricul

INSKO.
Frank M. Insko, aged sixty-four,
a former resident of Bourbon county,
died at his home in Spencer county,
recently of a complication of dis
eases. The body was taken to Rob
ertson county for interment. Funeral
services were held in the old Foster
Chapel, followed by burial in the
Chapel graveyard near by.
Mr. Insko resided for many years
near Millersburg, being engaged in
farming. He is survived by his .wid
ow and seven children.
TURNER.
The funeral of Mr. Edward
Payne Turner, whose death was re
corded in Tuesday's issue, was held
at the family home, on the Clinton
ville pike, near Paris, Wednesday
afternoon at four o'clock. Services
were conducted by Rev. W. E. Ellis,
of "the Paris Christian church. The
interment followed on the family lot
in the Paris Cemetery.
The pall-bearers were Lee Stephen
son, James B. Woodford, Luther K.
Rice, Charlton Alexander, Buckner
Wfoodford, J. Quincy Ward, George
K. Jones and Albert S. Thompson.
The passing of Mr. Turner occa
sioned sincere regret on all sides. He
was a man among men, one whom it'
was a pleasure to know. His home
was the center of good cheer and hos
pitality, and he was always at his
best when there was a group of
friends at his table. He was a genu
ine lover of sports, and as such kept
open house for sportsmen in the
chase or when fishing. He was all
that the term gentleman implies.
Bourbon county loses a valuable cit
izen, and his- family a counsellor,
guide and true friend.

FOOD ADMINISTRATION ASKS
PEOPLE TO CONSERVE POOD.
To meet the needs of America and
Allied armies and the civilian popu
lation of France, Great Britain and
Italy the American people were ask
ed by the Food Administration yester
day to place themselves on a limited
beef allowance from now until next
September 15.
Householders were requested not
"under any circumstances," to buy
more than one and one quarter
pounds of lean beef weekly, or one
a.nd one half pounds, including the
bone, for each person in the house
hold. Hotels and restaurants were asked
to serve boiled beef not more than
two meals weekly, beef steak not
more than one meal weekly and roast
beef not more than one meal weekly.
"The demand for beef for our ar
mies, the armies of the Allies and
their civilian populations for this
summer" said the food administra
tion's announcement, "are beyond
our present surplus. On the other
hand we have enough increased sup
ply of pork this summer to permit
economical expansion in its use. It,
therefore, will be a direct service to
our armies and the Allies if our peo
ple will in some degree substitute
fresh pork, bacon, ham and sausage
for beef products.
"The public will realize that the
changing conditions of production
irom season to season, the changing
situation in shipping, and, therefore,
of the market available to the Allies
and the increasing demand for our
growing armies, with the fluctuating
supply of local beef in France, all
make it impossible to determine pol
icies for a long period in advance.
We have recently asked for economy
in all meat consumption; we wish
now to emphasize further reduction
of beef, by the substitution of pork.
It is anticipated that this program
will hold good until September 15
and the co-operation of the public is
most earnestly requested."
TO ELIMINATE STUDY OP GER
MAN IflJjCHOOLS.
At a meeting of the City Board of
Education held yesterday afternoon
action was taken on the- proposition
of eliminating the study of German

Board by a practically unanimous
vote decided to abandon the Teutonic
language as a study and substitute
Franch or some other language study,
t obe decided upon later on.
ICE CREAM SUPPER.
An ice cream supper will be given
at the Bethlehem church to-night. A
small admission fee will be charged,
the proceeds to be devoted to church
