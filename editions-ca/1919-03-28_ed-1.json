kept busy all the time. With two
such hustling young men as Messrs.
Hudnall & Hill, both expert mechan
ics, the public is assured they will
get nothing but first class work,
with a guarantee of satisfaction in
every respect. Hudnall & Hill stated
to THE NEWS representative yester
day that if their business continued
to increase they would be compelled
to build an addition to their present
quarters. They will keep on hand at
all times a complete stock of Ford
accessories, oils and gasoline.

BAD ROADS COST MOEE MONEY
THAN GOOD ROADS '
The ahove assertion sounds' rather
foolish, but if every man in Kentucky
will figure what bad roads are cost
ing him, the question will be" solved
4 immediately, and there will he plenty
of money forthcoming for roadlwork.
Ask the owner of any automible
how much more it costs him to run
his machine over bad roads than over
good ones. How many tires are worn
away, springs broken, extra gasoline
and oil used. On good smooth roads
a set of tires will easily last for
10,000 miles, but over bad roads,
it is seldom that we get more than
four or Ave thousand miles out of a
set of tires.
Take the man living in a rural dis
trict where everything has, o be
hauled in over the highways, ttfe mer
chant has to pay anywhere fr6m 50c
j to $1.00 for hauling his goods. On
every barrel of flour that 4s brought
there is a bad road tax of perhaps
lone or two dollars. On every barrel
of sugar there is a bad road tax of
from $1.50 to $3.00 Every pair of
overalls, every pair of shoes, in' fact
everything that is bought carries
with it a oaa roaa tax. uesiaes ne
cannot market his goods so he can
really compete with men living on
good roads. It would cost anywhere
,f rom ten to twenty dollars to lia'ul 'to
the market a load of timothy hay,
2,000 pounds of tobacco and the bad
road tax on one ton of such material
would pay the man's taxes for good
roads for a year.
In addition to all these 'things,
good roads would allow him to visit
liis neighbors, go to church, allow his
children to attend school, .and so
many things that are desirable . that
it seems unnecessary to try. to enu
merate them in this enlightened age.
Let every man figure for himself
what good roads mean to him and he
will vote the 20c Road Tax every
time he gets a chance.

CAPTURING A GERMAN COLONEL
As the troopships have come into
the Port of New York in , recent
months, I could not help but remem
ber, whilo watching the soldiers on
board make game of the pompous
.municipal officials and other formal
greeters on the Patrol, the words of
a solemn English army officer as he
described these same American boys
in the thick of war. - ,
'"Straordinary!" drawled the Eng
lishman. "I mean to say, your Amer
ican soldiers do not take even: war
and death seriously. Now, when one
of our Tommies arrives back of the
lines with prisoners he may have a
bit of a grin on his face. The poilu
is a very solemn looking chap as he
escorts his German prisoners rear
