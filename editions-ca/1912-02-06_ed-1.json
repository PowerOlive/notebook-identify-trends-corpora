TestNew HemplSreakingMachine
Preliminary tests of the hemp break
ing machine, invented by Mr. Frank
O'Neil,, Jr., of this city, were made
last week, and although the conditions
at this time are anything but favor
able for hemp breaking the machine
demonstrated beyond a doubt that
when hemp is in prime condition for
the break, the invention will do all
that is claimed by the inventor.
The machine, which Mr. O'Neil has
had under construction for several
months in Philadelphia, arrived last
Thursday and was taken to the farm
of. Col. E. F. Clay on the Cynthiana
pike, to be given a test, but hemp at
this time is not sufficiently rotted and
only a short run was made.
According to Mr. O'Neil, the engines
with which the machine is equipped
worked tojperfection, which is one of
the main features of the machine of
recent construction. Only a small
amount of hemp was used in the pre
liminary test, but it separated the
fibre, tow and herds in a -very .satis
factory manner.
Owing to the weather conditions no
more tests will be made for some time,
or at least not until the weather opens
and the hemp is in the proper condi
tion for breaking then it will be tested
to its full capacity and the most satis
factory results are expected.
Mr. O'Neil has spent the greater
part of eight years on the invention,
the idea of which he conceived while a
student in the engineering department
of State University. It was here that
he castings and all principal parts of
the first machine were made. Since
that time he has constructed seven
other machines, each time improving
uponthe.one previous -until the latest
model, which is now here, is about to
the point of perfection.

Too Good for the Blue Grass
Baseball men frequently meet with
funny experiences, but the one which
happened to President Wm Neal, of
the Blue Gra33 League, recently just
about tops them all, says the Louis
ville Post. Mr. Neal is at present
snowed in under moie than 100 letters
from would-be umpires, and while go
ing through these he ran across a let
ter that nearly made him throw a lit.
In telling of the missive, Mr. Neal re
fused to give the applicant's name,
but he declared that his letter ran
something like this:
"Dear Mr. Neal: I want a job in
your league as player or umpire. Would
rather play than umpire, but if I can't
land a job on a team will umpire for
you, I haven't played in any league
yet, but with the teau I was with last
year I batted 1,200 and fielded better
than that. I am sure that I will be a
star no matter what team yuu put me
on."
"What did you do with that man?"
Mr. Neal. was asked.
"Oh," was-the reply, "I immedi
ately wrote him saying that although
I greatly regretted it, I would be un
able to give him a place, as he wa3 to
good for the Blue Grass League."
