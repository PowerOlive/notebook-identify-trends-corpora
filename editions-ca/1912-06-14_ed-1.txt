The large dining room,which during the life of Mr. White,one of the wealthiest men of theco-mty, was handsomley finishedand elaborate in its appointmentswill be divided into two rooms, andover the veranda which runs the fulllength of the building a sleeping roomwill be constructed. At present thebuilding contains twenty-three roomsand the proposed improvements willadd many more.

The opinionwas delivered by Chief JusticeHobson, Judges Winn and Lassingdissented from the' ruling.The question of the legality of theact was raised by Attorney, James A.Scott, of Franklin county, and byCircuit Judge RQbert.L. Stout whohad moved from Woodford county toFrankfort and claimed to be judge ofthe new pistnct.The court says the constitution laiddown the rules under which jrdicialdistricts may be created, and theymust be followed; that when the legislature acts under Section 138 of theConstitution it should not create adistrict of a single contv unless itevidence that the population is sufficient to fill the constitutional requirement, but though it may have the evidence, still, if the fact does not existthe court will inquire Into the factsand will not sustain the act if inviolation of the Constitution.The .court says that while greatweicrht will be give tne lesislate finding where the facts are doubtful,where the facts are clear the courtmnst do its duty and maintain thesupremacy of the Constitution.Notice to the Public.It is well to anticipate the possibil-jty of typhoid fever.

Made boldby its victory, after a nine years' delay in the courts, in the famous "trust"busting suif'started against it byformer PresidentRoosvelt, this trusthag boosted meat prices to the highestfigure evr known in this country, noteven excepting war-times. The trustgives "a shortage in the live stocksupply" as its reason! of increasingprices.That this excuse is only a subterfugeis shown by the late report of" thegovernment bureau of statistics, whichshows that instead cf a shortage in thelive stock supply, there has been asteady increase."The supply ofjcatile at the sevenprincipal Western markets in Aprilwas greater than in any April in the.last decade," this report says. "Thenumber of cattle shiDped to thesemarkets lastS month was greater thanfor the same month a year ago by thirteen per cent, and greater than thesame period for 1910 by forty per cent.Tnere wa a proportionate increase inthe supply of hogs and sheep, also, andthat the weight of these animals wasup to the standard of former years isindicated by the fact that the supplyof dressed meat now on hand in thepackers' warehouse is greatly in excess of the amount held there lastyear."This report shows that the beef truthas made up its mind to force the consumer to pay the cost of the nineyears' suit it has just won. All tnebig fees paid out to lawyers for keeping the trust magnates out of thepenitentiary Lwill be taken from thepurses of the "consumers. Nothingmust interfere with the trust's dividends !A sub-committee of the JudiciaryCommittee of the Democratic House ofRepresentatives has just started an investigation of the beef trust, and itsrenort will be an answer to the question as to whether the beef barnns aremore powerful than the United Statesgovernment.A sorainerJ ankle may as a rule becured in from three to four days by aDplying Chamberlain's Liniment andobserving the directions with eachbjttle.

Hitchcock, ot Nebraska. AndSenator Hitchcock is not given to making wild or extravagant statements."I believe it is within reason tosay," said Senator Hitchcock, at theconclusion of a speech he made on thesubject "that a careful examination of'the profits from all classes of privilegJed wealth m this country would revealjthat the protected industries exactfrom the people approximately a( thousand millions a year, over andJ above a fair profit. Tne fact thatI those industries have a monopolyI enable them to do this."j Senator Hitchcock's speech fairlyi bristled with figures, taken from Lthemost reliable and authentic sources, toback up'each of his facts.The steel trust alone gets $300,000.-; 000 annually in excess of a fair profit,i This monopoly does an annual busi' ness of fthree thousand millions of dolj lars a year, and it is estimated that' without the tariff, the steel trustj would have to sell its products for ten,per cent, lessjjthan it now sells them,I and ten per cent, of three thousandmillion is three hundred thousand.Every man, woman and child of the'92,000,000 in this country then, pays4an annual tribute of $3.50 each to thetrust, over and above what the.v. wouldhave to pay if ' the tariff were takenIrom steel.What is the effect of this extortion?One effect has been to create a hordeof mushroom millionaires. Anothereffect has been a gradual centralization of the nation's wealth into a fewhands, with a consequent intensifyingof the struggle for existence amongthe masses. Still another effect isseen in the vast number of strikes.Within the last twenty-five years36,756 strikes have been declared inthis country, most of them for higherwages. These strikes have involved atotal of 6,000,000 workrs, who, withtheir families, were driven to hungerand suffering.While a the steel trust enjoys a complete monopoly, due to the tariff, itfinds time to compete with othernations for steel trade outside of theUnited States. Last year the steelmakers of this country sold $230,000,000worth of steel abroad, in direct competition with the steel makers ofEurope, thus proving 'conclusivly thata tariff on steel is not needed to "protect American workmen", sinceAmerican workmen, do not get anymore than their fellows abroad. Thetariff is simply a barrier put up toenable the steel trust to gouce millions out of the home consumer.And in the meantime, the Democratic bill to lower the tariff on steel,having passed the House; lies in theKepublican Senate, still unacted upon.It is now well known that not morethan one case of rheumatism requiresany internal treatment whatever.

O. Hinton, Chairmanof the Finance Committee, reporetd asum got $6,OQ0Am the fund for generalexpenses left over fromjastlyear. The' only increase made in the levy was forschool purpoesse and to which 5 centson each $100 was added to make up adeficit which exists at the presenttime. Last year the public school received a sum of $11,000 and the sumwhich will go into that fund this yearwill be obout $15,000. The deficit wascaused by the installation of a filtering plant at the school and other expenses, whch brought the amount toabout $1,100. The addition of the 5cents added to the tax for school purposes is estimated to realize a sufficient fund to meet the demand madeuponthe -treasury.

The increaseamounts to as much as 40 cents a tonon coke and 20 cent on coal.Z lhe Louisville & Nashville contendsit costs more to operate from the pointsEast of Middleboro, Ky., than fromMiddleboro.

Quincy Ward, of this city, wason Wednesday appointed by GovernorMcCreary as executive agent for theState Fish and Game Commission.The appointment of Mr. Ward i3 apopular one, from the fact that hehas been a hard worker for a numberof years to get the game and fishlaws of the state in shape to be ofbenefit to the sportsmen and his efforts were rewarded by the Legislature enacting the measure at itslast session.The other members of the commission are J. G. Sachs, of Louisville;A. R. Patterson, of Pineville ; J. E.Grider, Fredonis, and Robert Burmanof Richmond, the last two named bethe Republican members of the Commission, which is soon to meet to perfect an organization.The selection of Mr. Ward is quitea compliment to him and will nodoubt prove quite satisfactory. Noman in the state is better knownamong true sportsmen who desire tosee the fish and game laws preserved.While the last Legislature did notenact any new laws for the protectionof game it created the Fish and GrmeCommission as a means of enforcingthe laws now on the "statute books.The salary paid the executive agentis fixed at 2 500 per year and the general expenses of the Department ofFish and Game preservation are to bemet by the licenses to be paid annually by bird hunters and from finesoccuring from the conviction of lawviolators.Notice,Fred J.

T. Hinton7IJ-V'3rrt -ly J. E. Waggoner, of the I H C Service BuretsA "great deal has been said in a jocular way about the razor-back hog- andhis sun-splitting- abilities, but it is avery encouraging- fact that he is rapidly becoming extinct. His happyhunting grounds consist now of onlya small part of the total hog producing area. He has been succeeded bythe more domesticated and morehighly developed t'pe of hog, whichsomeone has property dubbed "themortgage raiser." Many farmers caneasily attribute the possession ofhomes, wealth and all that goes therewith, to the domesticated hog. His placein the scheme of industrial progresshas been won not by any unusual trait,but is largely due to the fact that hisprofitableness is a result of instinctiveeconomical habits. By nature heseems to fit into the whole scheme offarming as a utilizer, to the best possible advantage, of many of the farmproducts that would otherwise be atotal loss.We can. draw a very valuable lessonfroiUs this all but artistic animal,whose only language is his squeal ofdisapproval and his sturdy grunt ofsatisfaction. He saves where otherswaste, and makes his living by rootingaround sometimes in places wherewanted, sometimes not. If there isanything within reach that he likeshe usually finds it and proceeds tomake good, use of the opportunitywithout any manifest concern or excitement. He seems to make it hisbusiness to look after small things,even the holes in the fence if the out0 side looks more inviting.Profitable farming is becoming moreand more a business proposition inwhich it is necessary to look afterthe small things and to use to the bestadvantage every opportunity to produce more economically. The bestand most profitable 'farmers haveadopted systems of farm accounting,or, in other words, they have becomeixokkeepers, have kept such complete records as to enable them to determine which fields were profitableand which were not. To begin with,it is not absolutely necessary to followup all little details, but it is a goodplan to do so as completely as possible.If we were to go into a manufacturing plant, one of the first things toimpress us would be the sstem ofdoing things and the strict principlesof economy that are followed. Allproducts that can be used for otherpurposes are saved, properly stored,and used when the time comes. Atthe end of each month, and possiblyeach day, the manager knows theexact status of affairs the amount ofstock on hand, and the quantity ofhisned product ready for them arket,jUvery part of a great machine' isjfSfimbered and each, must be accountedI for. - - ir"j the same unsystematic methodswere practiced in factories as are usedon some farms, they would soon losetheir identity with the world's progress, and become nothing but idlemonuments to some man's failure.On careful consideration it is plain tosee that with farming it is as import'ant, if not more so, to keep definiteand strict records of all expendituresof time, money and labor.The space alloted to this articlewill not permit a detailed explanation(of all the possibilities of an accounting system on the farm and what it(will accomplish, but carefully keptrecords will be an index finger to point. - i Z.

The next best system ofifarming is stock raising for meiJ? proeduction, and the best of all s3Tstemsdor maintaining the productivity offohe land, and at the same time reapprofits therefrom, is dairying notfelling the whole milk but sellingputter only.J Only by following some system offarm accounting can we know thesetilings and be able to weieh in the.lance the returns from each field'from each kind of stock and fromvery farm operation.HELPING THE WOMENThe cream separator is one of thefew things which specifically alleviate the drudgery of the woman whoselot has been cast on the fa.rm. Nobetter argument can be advanced forthe increased sale and 'extended useof these machines. The man whoplaces a separator on a farm has donesomething for humanity. In the city,when a housewife has cooked themeajs, washed the dishes, and otherwise cared for a little fiat with running water, steam heat, and electriclights, her whole duty toward man isdone. Tv.hereas, in the country awoman's work is never finished. Givethe average farmer's wife only thehousework to do and she would thinkshe was on a vacation. It is this inequalit of labor which starts countiygirls cityward. It is a lamentablecommentary on the lack of chivalry inmen but, in every rural community inwhich the writer has visited, theaverage head of the house always hasmoney to buy labor-saving machinesfor himself and sons. He is thoroughly up-to-date in that, but whenthe patent washer, the tireless cooker,the carpet sweeper, the water sTstem,and the lighting plant are advocatedby the junior partner, funds are alwayslow. This condition is not so bad asit used to be prosperity has openedthe purse strings but there are stillopportunities for betterment. Thecream separator is one of them. Itfills a need felt by every woman fromLeah down to the 19H Ames co-ed,and even if it did not increase thefarmer's dairy profit one iota, it isworth its weight in gold for the laborit saves the mothers, wives, and sisters on the farm.ROTATION OF CROPSReply to 1 Michigan Correspondent"I am growing sugar beets and myland seems to be decreasing in production. What rotation can I use?"In some localities it lias been foundthat beets do best following alfalfa,corn and small grains. A very goodrotation is as follows: Pirst, wheat;second year, beets; then clover for twoyears, last crop being plowed under:then potatoes, and the rotation repeated. If alfalfa can be grown inyour locality it is a good plan to include this in the rotation.In Montana the best rotation forbeet raising is as follows: Wheat,clover, oats, sugar beets, barley andpeas. In Utah the following rotationgives good satisfaction: First year,sugar beets; second year, peas and oatsfor forage; third year, sugar beets;fourth year, oafs, seeded to alfalfa;fifth year, alfalfaP When your child has whooDiug coughbe careful to keep the cough loose andexpectoration easy by giviag Chamberlain's Cough Remedy as may be required.

Irregluarhours, hastily eaten food, the wearand tear and rush of city life, arelargely responsible for the immenseamount of dull, listless, half sick people of the present generation. Debility or a run down condition, as it iscalled, is everywhere. Half thepeoDle I' see in street cars.Teataurants,theatres, or on the street, are unmistakably in a debilitated condition,with their nerves in such a state, thatthey either wish to lie down and restor rush after some excitement."Any one who has met a constantstream of nervou, debilitated peopleas I have since I began my uresentwork, can tell a man or woman in thiscondition at a glance. I wish toemphatically state that the numberof debilitated people in the largerAmerican cities is appalling." 'Tona Vita.' the medicine I amhelping to introduce, is to combat thiscondition. I believe it to be the bestprepaiation ever before sold to thepublic, in that it is immediately effective in cases of debility and othertroubles that go hand in hand with thisdisease."You cannot hope to enjoy life ormeet with much "success "if you aretired all the time, have little ambition,and feel continual -y depressed in mindand body. Every half sick, worn outman or,woman owes it to themselvesand their family, to try "Tona Vita."If the tonic does not make life moreworth living, and brings back thehealthy, energetic spirit, that is nowlacking the price is refunded.

The Bburbonites counted the victory by a score of9 to 5. Paris was leading by threeruns when'Richmond tied the score irthe seventh, but in the eighth andninth Paris got to. Myers, a formerBourbonite, and scored four runs.After the seventh Hauser tightenedup, and would not allow the Pioneersanother score. The local boys secureda total of seventeen hits off of JVlyers,each member of the team rapping himat least once. Goodman excelled withthe stick, getting four out of five tripsto the plate, getting two two-base hits,a single and a thee-bagger.

Errors wete frequent on thepart of the Paris men, and Blankenship was hit all over the lot. Two andthree-base hits came in profusion, andin each instance with men on bases.ThePioneers scored all their runs inthe fourth, fifth and sixth innings. Inthe first four innings Black, who pitched for Richmond, retired the side inorder, the first twelve men facing himgoing down.
