Parnell Bybreaking them was the prompt replyof the Irish leader who as is wellknown spoke from experience on thepoint But few members would care toadopt that heroic method of obtainingthe desired knowledge and their taskin mastering the rules is rendered allthe more difficult by the curious factthat many of these regulations are unwrittenSome will be found in the standingorders or permanent rules but thosethat deal with etiquette and decorumhave not been officially recorded anywhere save in a few quaint and obsolete regulations to be found in the oldissues of the journals of the house or inthe minutes of proceedings taken bythe clerk and published daily duringthe sessionFor instance a strange rule for theguidance of the speaker is set down under the loth of February 1620 Thespeaker not to rAove his hat until thethird congee Propriety of carriage inleading the chamber is thns enforcedThose who go out of the house in aconfused manner before the speaker toforfeit 10 shillings Thisrule is datedthe 12th of November 1640 Again wefind that on the 23d of March 1693it was ordered No member to taketobacco into the gallery or to the tablesitting at committees

bedMy baby lies with folded handsSweet rings of gold about her faceI know full well that house nor landsNor pleasures keen all life could giveThrough softly gliding plenteous yearsCould ease my heart of one sharp pangAt the memry of those baby tearsAnd bowing low beside her hereOn anguished knees of penitenceI ask my soul in stern reproofIf the dear God should take her henceWhat then were all your work and careYour strife for things beneath the sunIf no fair head that pillow prestTo glad your heart when day was doneAnd from my lips there goes aeryUp to the wisdom all divineOh for a broader

sworn that the thing should notbe Therefore there should be bloodshed that night at the Mission not ascab should be left for the niggersto bring back For scabs to be forcedupon them by niggers was an aggravation of injury by insult which thepride of these valiant Irish leaders couldnot brookThis was the story of the confidinglittle bo3r at the Mission told in thesimple faith of one who believes thathis friends can do no wrong all thebad men were on the other side Not ashadow or a stain of its cruel meaningseemed to have touched his childish apprehensionFaith was unhappy and fearful in hermind yet she tried to comfort hersellf the thing was as Mr Casson hadsaid too monstrous too suicidal a disgrace for the union leaders to permitto touch their organization still less toinvite as a

soundsshe yearned to hear announced herfriends but no new sounds broke thequiet stir of the leaves and the softlymoving water She grew sick with suspense They would not come in time toget her warning

flung his hand out toward her upon the grass Yet somethingin his manner she missed somethingthat she had looked to see on their meeting again missed it and drew backfrom her instinctive first

down infront were grimed and scratched andearth stained as though Beaver canjonhad been literally wiped up with himwhen he spoke his voice was a rapidmuttering devoid of expression Therewas no hope that they could come to anyunderstanding now on those delicatepoints that remained to be settled between them This was a piteous complication that at this last hour beforethe boat came in the hour that mustdecide how they should leave the boatand meet on the other side of the lakewhen the one word must be said and healone could say it he should be outof his senses calling her Miss Faithand babbling flat courtesies sayingnothing but with his eyes She couldnot give him even the love he dumbly cravedNo it was strangely cruel Theywere meant for each other this shebelieved as a new inexplicable fact not tobe reasoned about yet she was powerless to act upon it Could any girl follow a sick and crazy youth a conspicuously adorable young man whom anystranger would be good to once

to the point ofpenny wise and pound foolish It iswhat helps to plant the most giganticstones in the pyramid of any industryHow many farmers have sunk fortunes in machinery of every description simply

RainstormWhen ThirstyGeese are peculiar said an oldpoultry salesman in Manhattan market Put them out in a rainstormwhen they have a good thirst on andthey are liable to die About ten yearsago I was engaged by a firm to go outthrough the west and buy live geeseand chickens I bought ten car loadsXut them in crates and started eastThe geese were in the crates nearestthe floor of the open car thats theregular way to ship them and on topof them were piled the chicken cratesWe got about ten miles from St Joseph Mo when the load on one of thecars saggea ana tne wnoie pne oicrates was spilled on the side of thetrack In piling the crates on againthe geese were placed on top I knewI was taking chances because a rainstorm meant death to the geese butthere didnt seem to be any storm insight and I thought we could makeSt Joseph and shift the load thereThe train had only gone a short distance when a storm came up so suddenly that the rain was falling almostas soon as the clouds were noticedThe geese had been without water forsome hours and the moment they feltthe rain they were stretching theirnecks through the openings betweenthe slats and holding their bills opento catch the drops Well I got an oldcoat and laid it over as many of thecrates as it would cover so as to saveas many as possible Then I got aswitchand tried to force the others tokeep their heads inside the craterThey didnt mind the switch verymuch and I had to give eifch one fouror five good hits before it would pull inits head and when I started on a newhead the old one would pop up againWhen we got into St Joseph it wasstill raining and every goose in thetop crates with the exception of thoseunder the coat was dead Whetherthey died from drinking too much orfrom drinking while their necks werei3 an unnatural positon I do notknow but every man who has handledlive geese knows that a thirsty goosein a rainstorm in a crate is as good asdead Ive never told of thispeculiarity about geese withoutbeing doubtedbut you just ask any poultryman if itisnt true X Y SunCARE OF LATE BROODSHow to Make Them Profitable andPush Them Rapidly to Healthful MaturityLast year I raised 300 chicks butnone of them matured and grew so rapidly as the late hatched Septemberbrood and I think it partly chie to theirgenerous feeds of cracked corn Finding that these September chicks werecrowded from the feed boards whenever the older flocks were fed I placedCOOP FOR FEEDING CHICKENSin their yard one of the coop runs atriangular frame of laths used earlierin the season to confine mother hensnear their coop I have a dozen ofthese runs They are the length of alath and allow little chicks free ingressand egress while the mother can butput her head through the slots Theopen end of the run I placed againstthe yard fence and a dish of crackedcorn was constantly kept inside whichthe larger chickens could not reachThe little fellows quickly learned whenhungry to dart between the slats ofthis run and eat their fill safe from thegreed of the grown flockAfter the snow came the run wasplaced in the henhouse the space between laths increased to allow free passage of this half grown brood and thedish of cracked corn constantly kept replenished It has proved just the rightfood for this late hatched brood but Idoubt if it would be a healthy diet forchicks coming from the shell in hotweather American

members of thecorps at Byron 111 is Mrs James Houseweart but illness once put a ctop to heractive work A year or so ago when shewas nearing fifty years of age the timewhen women must be most careful of theirstrength Mrs Houseweart was taken seriously ill The family physician told herthat she had reached a critical period of herlife and must be very careful His prescriptions and treatment did not benefit herand other treatment proved unavailingAt last Dr Williams Pink Pills for PalePeople were brought to her notice with indisputable evidence that they were helpfulin cases such as hers and with renewed hopeshe tried the remedy Last March she tookthe first box of the pills which gave muchrelief She was determined to be curedand kept on with the medicine until noweight boxes have been consumed and shefeelpjlike a new womanMrs Houseweart said I have takeneight boxes and have been improving sinceI took the first dose I do not believe 1 couldhave lived without the pills They have doneme more

squeaky voice which youcould hear a block away Tricky Yesthats just what you would call it Iused to watch him sometimes whenhe was waiting on customers and itwas positively amusing to see the apparent ease with which he would makea two pound steak weigh apparentlythree or more poundsHe would take a couple of poundsof meat and throw it on the scales sothat the pointer would show four poundsand then take it off before the scalescould register the true weight Theresjust four pounds exactly he would sayto the customer in that squeaky voiceof his and then continue with the statement quickly made Four times 12 is58 Call it 60 and unless tho customerwas watching him closely he would always get even changeHe was in the meat business only afew years and amassed a competencyThen he left it What worries me ishow he is going to get along now I understand he is in the real estate businessand I wonder how he works it when hesells a piece of land The scales wonthelp him much there
