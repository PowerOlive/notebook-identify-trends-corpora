Could Folly Go Further?
A very small dog created a great
stir in the streets of Paris a few days
ago. A bijou pet dog was seen in the
Champs Elysees with a lady. It was
wearing indiarubber boots laced high
up the leg, ear protectors, goggles to
shield his eyes from cold or mud, and
a raglan overcoat lined with thick
flannel and provided with a pocket
from which projected a tiny handker
chief with a monogram.
