Harrpw Handle Pierced" Hear!.
Death'came to Homer G. Evans, of
Harrison county, in a peculiar manner
Sunday morning about 10 :30 o'clock:
Evans with a brother, had taken
shelter from the rain in the' barn of J.
H. Webb, near Ruddles Mills.
Climbing up to look at some tobacco
and losing his balance fell a distance
of about nine feet. In his descent he
struck the handle of a harrow, break
ing it, the sharp point breaking
through the tenth rib and piercing his
heart, death resulting almost instant
ly.' -
Evans, who was about 25 ypars of
age, was married and is survived by
his wife and a little daughter about
three years old. They lived about six
miles West of Cynthiana on the Cyn
thiana and Republican pike, and had
come Saturday afternoon for a visit to
the family of John H. Webb, in this
county.
Coroner" Rudolph Davis was sum
moned and held an inqust over the
body. -

several weeks has been conducting a
sale of pianos for the Jas. J. McCourt
Co., in this city, will take his leave of
Paris next J hursday, and depart for
BlueHelds, W. Va.
Quring his stay in Paris "Happy"
has made a very favorable impression
and a host of friends who regret very
much to see him go. Beside being
an excellent piano salesman and gener
al all-round good fellow he is a base
ball fan from the old school and says
his everlasting regret will be that he
did not see Paris trounce the Colts in
Lexington Sunday. He was a regular
attendant at the games here and his
presence will be greatly missed by the
local fan?.
