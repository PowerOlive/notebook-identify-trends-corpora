ALMOST A STOBY
It is easy to write a- story -
It is easier to write a summer story in
winter or a winter story in summer than
it is to write either in its proper season
Because in the dead of winter you can
recall -the pleasures of summer and leave
out the disagreeable accompaniment of
flies and snakes and wood ticks and wilted
collars In summer time you can think
of the joys of winter and not cpme in con
tact with blue noses shivering blasts and
frosted feet So to write a story in zero
weather you should begin in the summer
Let me explain
Who thdt was 10 years old at the time
does not remember the hurricane that
swept over the entire states of Kentucky
Illinois Indiana and Ohio in 18G0vleaving
death and destruction in its wake That
was a long time ago but we will take it
or a starter
Just as the storm any otner storm
would serve the same purpose was about to
break in its fury upon a quiet rural com
munity in Clermont county O two town
children a boy and a girl aged respec
tively 10 and 7 were passing along the
highway near a farmhouse on the Glisson
place unmindful of the terrors of the ap
proaching storm The good lady of the
house sent one of her sons to warn them
of their danger and to bring them into
shelter
The storm spent its fury and the dark
ness of night hung like a mantle over the
desolate soene of destruction As soon as
it was safe to venture out a courier was
dispatched on horseback to notify the dis
tressed parents at New Richmond that the
children were safe He was met by a
searching party from home seeking the
precious ones who were supposed to have
perished in the awful cyclone
Right here the boy who is not the girls
brother may be dropped out of the story
and the one gallus jay be introduced as
the hoy hero
In the meantime the bright little girl
was rapidly winning the hearts of the
houscLold in which she had found shelter
by her sweet smiles bright sayings won
derful dancing and genial disposition cou
pled with a fairylike beauty of form and
face
This girl was the petted daughter of a
noted steamboat captain who died but a
few years ago and who spent a months
vacation in that country town during that
particular summer K
The child remained until morning and
was entranced by the freedom of the coun
try She went away never to return but
her name was mentioned for years after
ward in that household and she was long
remembered as a bright ray of sunshine in
the midst of a terrible storm
None ever knew how sad was the heart
of one boy on that farm when he realized
that in a few short hours he had met and
parted from one whose image would ever
remain in his heart And he wondered if
he would ever again look upon the bright
vision
Twenty one years later a stranger that
same country boy was standing on the
levee at Cairo Ills when a New Orleans
and Cincinnati packet rounded the bend
below He was in conversation with a
river correspondent of a Cincinnati paper
Thats the Old South Captain Lew
bound for Cincinnati He knew the
whistle At the sound of the name of
Captain Lew the stranger started for
some of the dinip misty past struggled in
his brain
Yes it is the same Captain Lew His
daughter was married some years ago and
her husband who ran as mate with Cap
tain Lew was killed in an explosion of
their boat a year ago on the Mississippi
She is a widow now and went to New Or
leans with her father this trip She may
be on the boat now Lets go aboard and
I will introduce you to the captain So
said the correspondent after he had heard
a brief sketch of the incidents of childhood
days The boat had tied up to the wharf
by this time
Now dont you see how easy it is to write
a story
Now go up into the cabin and see the
hearty greeting of the grizzly old captain
j who does not fail to remember the incident
oi tne supposea lost child and is profuse in
his thanks to the young man even at this
late day and winds up his cordial greeting
with Come back into the cabin and
meet Zulema She will be glad to see
you for she has often spoken of the Inci
dent She seems never to tire of reciting
the pleasures of that happy evening
Before the words were hardly out of his
mouth the captain opened a stateroom
door and there stepped out into the blaz
ing light a veritable vision ot loveliness
the same childish face only saddened and
beautified not to say sanctified by sorrow
The young nmns heart seemed to cease its
pulsations Was he only dreaming
But it took only a little while after in
troductions and explanations had been
made to convince him that she too had
remembered the first meeting for she took
his hand trustingly and held it while re
peating the experiences of that stormy
night 300 miles and 21 years away
The bell rang goodby was said the mate
cussed the gangplanks were drawn in
the great wheels turned the boat glided
out in the flickering waves and was lost in
the darkness The woman was on the
boat while the man stood on tbeevee
watohing the lights and listening -to the
wheels upon the water until they dimmed
and died away in the distance even as
hope died out in his heart
Another 15 years have been ticked off by
the watch Thats about all of the web of
the story But you can see how easy it
would be to make a story out of it by giv
ing the imagination full play 1 may
write it some day Exchange
Contagion and Infection
Let me here try to correct what I believe
to be a mistake and give rise to confusion
The terms contagion and infection are too
often used promiscuously though they are
by no means synonymous The dissemi
nation of mycotic diseases takes place in dif
ferent ways There are those which can
not be communicated from person to per
son but spread only by the microbic cause
invading the individual To this class be
long malarial fevers produced by spas
modia Malaria is not contagious just
so in all probability cerebro spinal men
ingitis There are secondly those which
are not communicable from person to per
son but through external carriers only
sueh as soil water food air clothing and
utensils Tothat class belong yellow fever
and Asiatic cholera They are infectious
There are finally those which may be
transmitted directly from a person or in
directly through carriers To this class
belong scarlet fever measles diphtheria
variola influenza erysipelas and varicella
perhaps also whooping cough They are
contagious and infectious Dietetic and
