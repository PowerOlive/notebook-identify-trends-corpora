Bourbon County Crop Conditions
Crop conditions have somewhat im
proved in Bourbon county, as a result
of copious showers of the past two
weeks and while a great quantity of
water is yet needed to replenish the
streams and pools, and to thoroughly
drench the soil, the situation shows
much improvement and more corn and
tobacco will be brought forth at
harvest time than was at first antici
pated. B With pastures greening up, the pros
pect for fall grazing is encouraging
and farmers are taking a more rosy
view of the situation. &&Hte&'i&,
Bourbon cattle producers havebeen
hard hit and the 1911 season of drouth
and scarcity of feed will long be
membered. "&M
re-
Fall plowing is in progress and the
soil, where it has bpen benefitted by
rains, is turning up loose and mellow
and will make a good seed bed when
rye and wheat is cast over the ground
by hand and drill.
Many fields of tobacco are growine
out better than it was thought
possible, owing to a lack of moisture,
and some farmers will have excellent
yield. The great bulk of the crop,
however, is short and the total pro
duction of the county it is believed
will be only about half of an average
crop atjd owing to the light yield corn
cutters will not make the good prices
paid one year ago for cutting cum.

The finest home grown peaches ycu
