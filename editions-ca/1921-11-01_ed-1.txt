Fee, of Paris,says he has the milk problem solved.In a letter to his father he tells howit can be done, and he is confidenthis method will be used universallysoon."How would you like," he says,"to have three quarts of the purestrichest, creamiest milk ever drank:for seven cents a day? Get a goat.There is no "kidding about this."Mr. Fee is one of about a dozen,men in Kansas City who have gomeinto the goat milk business and aremaking a big success of it. Theyhave formed a "goat club" amdthere are new additions to its membership every day. They predictthat the end of the cow dairy isnear at hand, and soon every familywill have its own private dairy.Soon no home will be complete without its milk goat, giving from threeto five quarts of the purest milk aday for feed and upkeep. Anymember of the Goat Club can give ahundred reasons why goat milk issuperior to cow milk.Mr. Fee is so enthusiastic over thesuccess of his enterprise that he haswritten a lengthy article bringimpout the basic facts to support his argument. "There is a general lack of knowl-edge in relation to the goat," Mr.Fee says. "It is one of the cleanestanimals, healthy to the limit anddoes not breed either flies or germs.I have but four goats at present amdcannot begin to supply the demamdof physicians for the milk."According to Mr. Fee, Egyptian.goats are among the best from which,to select a herd.
