However, it is generally agreed that in the event the smallpox situation becomes more tense orany more of the members become infected that it will be impossible tohold the rest in Frankfort and an adjournment of at least twenty daysforced.

Demg a uennquent, ana wno, itwas stated in a Cincinnati paper, lastFriday morning, gave out a statementin which it was alleged that a numberof prorninene men had contributed toher delinquency. Amdng the numbermentioned were Brent Arnold, General Freight Agent of the Louisville &Nasville railroad,' whose home is inCincinnati, and George Alexander,president of the Alexander BankingCo., and a wealthy citizen of this city.Probation officers in Cincinnatihave been conducting a thorough investigation into the story of the girl, Iwho, it is said, made visits to the establishment conducted by Lillian Boreas, a manicurist, in Cincinnati,where she was introduced to men, thenames of whom were withheld by order of Judge Caldwell, presiding atthe sessions of the Juvenile Court, buta Cincinnati newspaper secured thenames alleged to have been impartedto the Court, which resulted in theirpublication.The fact that a number of prominent men were involved caused quitea stir in the Queen City, and at thetrial, held Friday afternoon beforeJudge Caldwell, the Crane girl wasadjudged a delinquent and was heldpending the prosecution of the Boreaswoman. It was upon the testimonyof George Richter, a chauffeur, withwhom she -had relations in Januarythat the girl was helG by the Court asa delinquent.Mr. Alexander wa3 ill at Iris homeon Pleasant street, where he has beenconfined for the past three weeks,when he received theinformation thathis name had been linked with the proceedings in the Juvenile Court at Cincinnati. When seen Friday evening,he was able to sit up and gave ont astatement in which he stoutly maintained his innocence of the allegedcharges placed against him in theCincinnati newspapers, and declaredthat the matter was ridiculous andabsurd."It is very unfortunate that I' should have been drawn into this, affair," said Mr. Alexander, "but I amas innocent as a baby of the chargesmade by the girl, and the first intimation I had of being involved was whenI was apprised of t:ie newspaper article, and of my name being linkedwith the affair.""Did you know Mildred Crane?"was asked."I never saw the girl in my life," hereplied, "neither do I know the woman to whose home it is said she wastaken. The accusation is infamous,slanderous, and absolutely withoutfoundation. My last visit to Cincinnati was on New Years' Day. Whilethere I was the guest of Brent Arnold.Since that time I have given my attention to my business, until threeweeks ago, when I became ill. Themotive, I think, is purely one for gain,otherwise it would have been impossible for them to have identified mewith the disgraceful proceedings.""I have been informed," said he,"that Mildred Crane. is said to haveletters and telegrams bearing my sig-sIf ydn hav'nt takenof our Redaction Sale, da noting a Suit orOvere oat from us whilelaybuyXyon ean saire money..VVvrPilifcche S; BiTine Store for Meat's Stylesakemore,Paris, Kentucky..iAA:vjaxftfwniiiiJirThe Store Where Reliability Reigns.-SsMCUMBRB, CHIHUAHUA, Feb. 9.Charred bones and several metalbuttons and buckles from clothingwere the onlv traces discovered yesterday of the bodies z the 50 or more nature.

The disease, repeatedly stamped out in many counties, hasbeen reintroduced in the eastern section of the State through continueddisregard and violation of the law andof the rules of the Board, requiringthat no unvaccinated person be employed, on the part of railroad construction companies and other largeemployers of unskilled labor. Theprompt prosecution of such violationsby County Attorneys will cause theenforcement of this rule, and willsave the counties of the State thousands of dollors."More than 25,000 cases and 335deaths have been caused from smallpox in Kentucky since 1898. Thecure and prevention of this' diseasehas cost our counties and cities$325,650 and the business loss is esproperly done with reliable virus andrepeated every seven years, is required by law and no person who hascomplied with this law has had smallpox in Kentucky. It costs the average man one dollar to be vaccinated,and $140 and six to fourteen weeksisolation to have the small pox. Reliable fresh vaccine points will befurnished by this Board for the use ofhealth authorities for $6.50 per hundred and are available at any time."Most of our cses of small pox aremild, but at best it is a loathsome disease. It is easy to prevent" and it Isunlawful not to be vaccinated. In thepresence of its present widespread existence in the State intelligent peopleshould not wait for the law to forcethem to an eviden duty. Law abidingpeople have already or will now bevicclnated. Others -should be required to do so by tne proper authorities. "By order of the Board:JOHN G. SOUTH, M. D.President,A. T, McCORMACK, M.

L.EUTZ.)Safetv. eccnomv and ntilitv ,im thprime considerations- in silo buildingand on all of these points farmers arefinding themselves gainers from theuse of concrete. Concrete structuresare much safer and in the long runare more economical. The originalcost is about the same as for silos ofolher materials if the farmer is ablet0 do the work with bis regular force.When the durabnity and lessened riskare considered it is seen that the concrete construction is economical inalmost all circumstances. Theconcrete silo is sanitary and preservesthe fodder in a satisfactory way. Thisfact has been demonstrated by government tests.Farmers who have not studied thesubject of concrete construction willdo well to take it up. In most casesthe material will be cheaper andhandier than lumber. It is of highvalue for walks, dairy floors, milkhouses, watering troughs and steps,as well as for general architecturalwork.Where the farmer is able to supplythe sand and gravel without' muchexpense and has time to perform thelabor of construction, cr at least toConcrete Trough for Stock.......f... . v ..nnn nnw nbupeiVHD il, tuts uuiiaj lwx auj (jircupiece of work will probably be lessthan it would be if lumber were used.The proportion of cement required ianot a large item of expense.The farmer also gains in the matterof insurance as he goes forward withhis experiments in concrete construction. This is an important consideration, and he adds both comfort andsafety, besides saving money.HOW MUCH WILL SILO HOLD?Amount Can Be Closely CalculatedProvided Number and Kind ofAnimals Are Known.(By A. D.. WILSON.)The amount of silagq required andthe size of silo needed to hold it canbe quite closely calculated providedthe number and kind of animals to befed from it are known before build-J.inBAn average cow -or eef animal maybe fed about thirty-five pounds of sil-age per day and the usual periodJ I 1.1-1. .1.A 1.. ,.A n l,Cf IUUilUg WillVU JJllAfiO lO UBCU UX bixialatitude will be about 210 days. Largeanimals or those that are being fattened may consume considerablymore than thirty-five pounds per day.but this has been found a fair aver-r n nnr Aaniu ,average weight of the silage ia about ,iorxy pounas per cudic ioou jear tao jtop of the silo, however, where thopresure is not great, it will weighonly twenty-five pounds per cubic footwhile at the bottom of a thirty-fivefoot silo It may weigh sixty pounds-Taking these averages, if a cow eats jthirty-five pounds of ensilage In aday, she will, eat thirty-five fortieths,or seven-eighths, of a cubic foot perday, and with this as a basis it is easyto determine the number of cubic feet' 0f ensilage required to feeda cow ori any numoer of cows tnrougnout tneany namber of cows throuseason. The diameter of the silomust be such that the stock on handcan use one or two inches of sila&eoff the top each day "during the 'winter and at least three inches per daywhen summer feeding of silage is tobe practiced. This is necessary tokeep the silage from spoiling.A silo' ten feet in diameter is adapted to feeding tea mature cattle. Onetwelve feet in diameter will feed fifteen head, and one fourteen feet indiameter will meet the needs of twenty head; but if there are thirty ormore cows to feed, a sixteen-foot siloEhould be erected. Thece silos shouldbe thirty or forty feet, or even morein heightSOME GOOD POULTRY D0NTSParticular Attention 8hould Bo Paidto Drinking Fountains andCharacter of Fead.Don't let the drinking fountain sitin tho sun, for if you do your poultrywill surely get diseased.Don't feed sour and unwholesomefood, because if you do the fowls willhave indigestion and liver trouble.Don't forget to provide shade forthe poultry, the scorching hot mmwill be sure to make the hens side.Don't keep the males in the sameyards with the females. If yon hareno separate pen, sell them to thebutcher.Don't forget to supply grit and oyster shells.

The stndy ofwater resources is therefore one of -"hemost important governmental investigations. The United StatesGeological Survey has been making asystematic study of the rivers andother water supplies in the UnitedStates and during me last 18 yearshas published nearly 350- reports presenting the results of this work. Perhaps the most useful phase of thework is the measurement of the Howof streams. Records of stream floware absolutely essential to any intelligent river development, whether itbo in the interest or navigation, offlood preventon, or irrigation, of lanidranage, or of power development.In a report just issued by the Surveydealing with the surface supply otthe Ohio River basin Water-SupplyPaper 303 attention is called to thoimportance of long-time records ofstream flow, inasmuch as all rivervary greatly from year to year. Experience has shown th"afr such recordsshould cover all stages from absolute maximum to absolute minimumand should embrace periods of 5, 10of for some streams even 20 years.At first glance these may seem excessive lengths of time for the sim-Pie determination of a rivers caoacitrbut when the vast interests involvedin river development are consderefit will be recognized that great caxbshould be taken to obtain trustworthv( information.. In developing inland navigation theFederal Government alone has ex-ipended in the neighborhoodof $300.-uuu.uuu, and prospective expenditureswill apnroximate or exceed this sum.It is obivious that the determination,of stream flow is necessary to the intellgent direction of these large disbursements. A thorough knowledgeof stream flow, both in the contributing areas and along the great lovrlpnd rivers, is the first necessity.The flow doinage in the United Statesis estimated to be in excess of $100,000.000 annuallv.-the Ohio River basinbeing particularlv subject to flood3, asin the spring of last year.Wser-Snnnly Paper No. 303, covering the Ohio River basin, contains,a large number of records of the flor5 -F M..wnn..n XJ1 A - -L , .' ,0',", A 'wr b withoutcost on ammcation to the Director ofthe Geological Survey at WashingtoM.D. C.The reason a girl buys a waist thatbuttons up to the neck is because shewants to leave it unbuttoned as fardown as she pleases when she wearait.You can't sell a woman a dog without producing his pedigree.
