RELIGIOUS
"LITTLE WOMEN."
Close acquaintance with the lovable
characters of Louisa M. Alcott's never-to-be-forgotten
story, "Little Wo
men", will be the privilege of Paris
people at the Paris Grand, on Wed
nesday night, October 8. The play
will be presented by William A. Brady
exactly as it ran all last year at the
Playhouse, in New York.
Sweet, simple, quaint and refresh
ing is this story of half a century ago,
and the play is as charming as the
book,bringing very close to those who
know and love the story, the old
friends from out the covers of the
book into that larger, more intiniate
life of the stage.
How strange and yet wholly de
lightful it will seem to the thous
ands of "Little Women" readers to
see the awkwrd Jo, the beautiful Meg,
the rollicking Amy and the lovable
Beth of Miss Alcott's story actually
brought to life before the footlights;
to hear them speak, rehearse Jo's
plays, settle their little family quar
rels, and to watch them through the
"lovering stage," when the romance
of Amy and Laurie, of Meg and John
Brooks, are lived before an audience.
Mr. Brady has assembled a repre
sentative New York company of
twelve players, and promises a scenic
production accurate and realistic,
showing the March home at Concord
and the orchard at Plumfield. The
play is in four acts and two scenes,
and mauy of the costumes used have
been secpred from the Alcott family,
including Jo's boots, which she got
"from a lady who had a friend who
knew an actor." (adv)
WILL PROLONG STAY.
Mr. A. R. Johns, the expert photo
graper, who came here early in the
summer for a few weeks' stay at Nor
man's studio, will on account of the
immens amount of work on hand,
be compelled to prolong his stay until
after Christmas. Those who desire
work done should have their sittinge
made at once, as the work will be
finished in the order they are filed.

IS SEEKING APPOINTMENT
Mr. Frederick A. Waliis, of this
city and New York, who for several
terms has been president of the Ken
tucky Society of New York, will prob
ably be appointed Commissioner of
Immigration by President Wilson,

ment of the most influential members
of Mr. Wilson's cabinet, and it is

Clay, at their home on Pleasant
street. She is president of the Ken

I successful in securing the appoint
ment to this most important position.
"A SNAKE STORY BUT
TRUE ONE, NEVERTHELESS
The appearance of a large snake at
the home of Mr,. Sim Levy, on Pleas
ant street, about two weeks ago has
been the source of great consterna
tion among the members of the family
ever since. Mrs. Levy discovered the
snake, and, becoming frightened,
called for some one to assist her in
dispatching the reptile.
Mr. J. W. Brown, who was passing,
went to her assistance, but his snake
ship had made his escape. Mrs. Levy
described the reptile as being about
five or six feet long, and since that
time constant fear of another inva
sion has kept the family in a state
of uproar.
A few nights ago Mr. Levy went
down town to a picture show, and, re
turning, discovered the snake(?) coil
ed to an immense heiglit on the front
porch. Calling to his wife not to be
frightened at any unusual noise, he
enlisted the aid of several boys, and
the party gathered all the stones pos
sible to carry, and cautiously ven
tured on the porch for fear of disturb
ing the slumbers of the reptile.
As a means of putting an end to it
in short order Sim secured a stone
that weighed in the neighborhood of
fifteen pounds, and when within a
few feet of the object let go at it
with all his strength, while at the
same time the enlisted force shower
ed the object with small stones. The
noise of the onslaught aroused the
whole neighborhood, and when the
smoke of the batti-; cleared away,
much to the chagrin of the belliger
ents, instead of a mutilated, bleeding
reptile they found a large mass of
cotton, fur and excelsior. It was his
little boy's Teddy Bear that had been
so valiantly slain C?).
PARIS WATER SUPPLY
ALMOST AT AN END.
The question of a water supply is be
coming a serious problem in this city
at the present time and unless a heavy
rain falls within the next week Paris
will be practically without enough wa
ter for domestic purposes and there
will only be a limited amount for fire
protection.
No rain of any consequence having
fallen in the past two months and ow
ing to the extreme drouth, Stoner
Creek, from which the water for the
city is secured is at the lowest stage
since 18S1, when the bottom of the
stream was visible for miles above the
dam. The small pools of water stand
ing in the stream bed, have been
trenched in efforts to get all that can
be secured within the reach of the
pumps of the Paris Water Co. and the
Louisville and Nashville railroad.
The latter company began Monday
to lay a temporary pipe line from the
mouth of the Doyle spring and empty
in above the dam. The line was com
pleted Tuesday morning and a pump is
now engaged in lifting the supply of
water above the dam.
Superintendent Newt. Mitchell, of
the Paris Water Co.,-has notified all
consumers to refrain from the unnec
essary use of water, and has ordered
that the sprinkling of the streets be
stopped under penalty of having the
entire supply of the city cut off for a
time at least.
At the present time there is a suffici
ent amount to affoiG fire protection,
which is being preserved for an emer
gency. Mayor J. T. Hinton yesterday
notified Superintendent Mitchell that
the city would refuse to honor any
claims of the water company until
they came up to the requirements of
their contract. Mr. Mitchell, however,
is doing everything in his power to
meet the demand made upon the reser
voir and has a large force of men
above the pumping station trenching
the bed of the stream. He has had all
of the springs flowing into the streams
dynamited, with the hope of securing
a stronger flow of water, but with lit
tle result.
In less than a mils lin-strpam thA
j creek can be crossed on the rocks in
as many as a dozen places. The con
dition has now assumed a critical
stage and unless rain falls shortly in
sufficient quantities to flood the bed of
the stream, Paris wil be face to face
with the most distressing water fam
ine in thirty-two years.
FOR PRESERVING.
The best pears for preserving that
were ever brought to Paris. Phone in
your order while you can get them.
The price is right.

3URLEY SOCIETY TAX SUITS
WILL 3E COMPROMISED
State Auditor H. M. Bosworth said
Tuesday that the back tax suit
brought in over a score of counties
by former Auditor's Agent John How
ard, of Middlesboro, against the Bur
ley qool will be compromised. A
special agent will be appointed to
make the settlement, but Mr. Bos
worth has not yet liamed the agent.
The suits aggregate many thous
andsof dollars. Representatives of
(the pool made overtures for a com-
' promise some time ago, but Auditor
Bosworth said, under a rule in his de-
! partment, the suits were at the dispos
al of the agents who brought them.
Since the resignation of Mr. Howard
the Auditor has taken over the direc
tion of the negotiations.
Suits which will aggregate approx
imately 30,000 were brought in Bour
bon county against the Burley Tobac
co Society, and a hearing was given
the case in Judge Dundon's court se
eral days ago, resulting in it beins
passed until October 6, on account of
the absence of important witnesses.
