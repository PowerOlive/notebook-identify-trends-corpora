understood to be theMerrimac Only the extremities ofher funnel and two masts are visibleabove the waterThe Santiago advices to Cape Haytien in referring to the sunken vesselas auxiliary cruiser probably mistakeher character The Merrimac is a collier and always has been a collierIt will be noted that there is an important discrepancy as to the time atwhich the bombardment is said to havebegun Friday morning between theand during the engagement ran theMerrimac into the narrow entrance ofthe harbor and opened her sea valvesallowing her to sink Just inside theentrance the channel is so narrow thata vessel as large as the Merrimacsunk there would make it impossible for Adm Cerveras ships to passon either side of her It is hoped thatthe report that one of her officers andsome of her crew were captured by theSpanish is incorrect yet it is realizedthat it was a dangerous task whichthey had to perform and though AdmSampson doubtless took every precaution possible to enable them to escapethey may have been unable to get offthe sinking vessel and get safely pastthe Spanish batteries at the entranceto the harbor in a small boat to wherethey could be picked up by one of thevessels

byMilitary Action Cerveras Fleet WillBe Scuttled or CapturedLondon June 6 All the papers refer in terms of the highest praise toNaval Constructor Hobsons daring exploit at Santiago de Cuba but somedoubts are thrown upon the statementthat the Merrimac so completely blocksthe channel as the American reportsassertThe Times in an article reviewingthe operations of the week saysIt is most probable that Adm Cervera has a deliberate intention to stayat Santiago therefore to open thechannel would be of very little use tohim It seems clear that his squadronwas not prepared for war or fit for seawhen it left the Cape Verde islandsand there is good reason to doubtwhether the Cristobal Colon even shipped her big guns at allHobsons exploit is one of whichthe American navy may well be proudThe idea that the wreck can be removed by the use of a little dynamiteis opposed to all experience Madriddescribes the affair as a brilliant Spanish victory but from dreams of suchvictories there is an unpleasant awakeningAdm Cerveras period of evasion isnow ended and beyond creating anunreasoning panic in America he hasaccomplished nothing The navalgame in the West Indies seems playedout and little can be said of it exceptthat events have conformed strictly tolaw and that no new and expected developments can be traced Santiagonow invites capture by military action and Adm Cerveras ships unlessscuttled can not avoid captureThe Times commenting editoriallyon the exploit sa3sThe perilous operation was executed with splendid gallantry by a littleband of volunteers who almostmiraculously escaped The destruction and fall of Santiago are now onlya question of time with the disappearance of all the hopes founded upon the Spanish fleetsSpains sympathizers recognize thatJier case is hopeless and America willnot distress herself much about suchwarnings as that of the St Petersburg Novosti Saturday until the combination assumes a more tangibleform than there is any prospect of

quoThe Daily Chronicle remarks Addd to the other dangers was the dangerof sharks The incident gives freshluster to the renown of the AmericannavyThe Daily News saysAll English sailors will join withthe Americans in admiration of thisexploit under the point blank fire ofthe Spanish batteries Whether theMerrimac was intended to be sunk orto clear a fair way through the minescan not attect the praise duemen who heroically volunteeredto face almost certain death inthe service of their country If theUnited States can count on self-sacrificeof that kind in great emergenciesthe Santiago forts will be powerless toprevent Adm Sampson reaching theSpanish squadron should that measure seem good to himThe article proceeds to argue thatit is premature however to supposethat the channel is absolutely closedor that it would be impossible to destroy the hulk It saysEnglish torpedo officers could devise many methods of floating outdynamite charges unless the hulk liesfar outside Morro

quite different frominy of the others In the first place thelittle gallipot of a boat that we were inwas gravely overloaded Five grownmen and three of them TrelawneyRedruth and the captain over six feethigh was already more than she wasmeant to carry Add to that the pow3er pork and the bread bags Thegunwale was lipping astern Severaltimes we shipped a little water and mybreeches and the tails of my coat wereall soaking wet before we had gone 100yardsThe captain made us trim the boatand we got her to lie a little more evenly All the same we were afraid tobreatheIn the second place the ebb was nowmaking a strong rippling current running westward through the basin andthen southward and seaward down thestraits by which we had entered in themorning Even the ripples were a danger to our overloaded craft but theworst of it was that we were swept outof our true course and away from ourproper landing place behind the pointIf we let the current have its way weshould come ashore beside the gigswhere the pirates might appear at anymomentI cannot keep her head for thestockade sir said I to the captain Iwas steering while he and Redruthtwo fresh men were at the oars Thetide keeps washing her down Couldyou pull a little strongerNot without swamping the boatsaid he You must bear up sir if youplease bear up until you see youregainingI tried and found by experiment thatthe tide kept sweeping us westward until I had laid her head due east or justabout right angles to the way we oughtto goWell never get ashore at this ratesaid IIf its the only course that we canlie sir we must even lie it returnedthe captain We must keep upstreamYou see sir he went on if once wedropped to leeward of the landingplace its hard to say where we shouldget ashore besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs whereas theway we go the current must slackenand then we can dodge back along theshoreThe currents less aready sir saidthe man Gray who was sitting in thefore sheets you can ease her off a bitThank you my man said 1 quite asif nothing had happened for we hadall quietly made up our minds to treatbian like one of ourselvesSuddenly the captain spoke up againand I thought his voice was a littlechangedThe gun said heI have thought of that said I for Imade sure he was thinking of a bombardment of the fort They couldnever get the gun ashore and if theydid they could never haul it throughthe woodsLook astern doctor replied thecaptainWe had entirely forgotten the longnine and there to our horror were thefive rogues busy about her getting offher jacket as the3r called the stoutTarpaulin cover under which shesailed Not only that but it flashed into-my mind at the same moment that theround shot and the powder for the gunhad fieen left behind and a stroke withan ax would put it all into the posses-sion of the evil ones aboardIsrael was Flints gunner saidGray hoarselyAt any risk we put the boats headdirect for the landing place By thistime we had got so far out of the runof the current that we kept steerageway even at our necessarily gentle rateof -rowing and I could keep her steadyfor the goal- But the worst of it wasthat with the course I now held weturned our broadside instead of ourstern to the Hispaniola and offered atarget like a barn doorI could hear as well as see thatDrandy faced rascal Israel Handsplumping down a round shot on thedeckWhos the best -shot asked thecaptain- Mr Treianrney out and awayj saidB pHw tfi yi fn fitt mwrgMr Trelawney will you please pickme off one of those men sir Handsit possible said the captainTrelawney was as cold as steel Helooked to the priming of his gunNow cried the captain easy withthat gun sir or youll swamp the boatAll hands stand by to trim her when heaimsThe squire raised his gun the rowingceased and we leaned over to the otherside to keep the balance and all was sonicely contrived that we did not shipa dropThey had the gun by this timeslewed round upon the swivel andHands who was at the muzzle with therammer was in consequence the mostexposed However we had no luckfor just as Trelawney fired down hestooped the ball whistling over himand it was one of the other four whofellThe cry he gave was echoed not onlyby his companions on board but by agreat number of voices from the shoreand looking in that direction I saw theother pirates trooping out fromamong the trees and tumbling intotheir places in the boatsHere come the gigs sir said IGive way then said the captainWe mustnt mind if we swamp hernow If we cant get ashore alls upOnly one of the gigs is beingmanned sir I added the crew of theother most likely going round byshore to cut us offTheyll have a hot run sir returned the captain Jack ashore youknow Its not them I mind its theround shot Carpet bowls My ladysmaid couldnt miss Tell us squirewhen you see the match and well holdwaterIn the meanwhile Ave had been making headway at a good pace for a boatso overloaded and we had shipped butlittle water in the process We werenow close in 30 or 40 strokes and weshould beach her for the ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sandbelow the clustering trees The gigwas no longer to be feared the littlepoint had already concealed it from oureyes The ebb tide which had socruelly delayed us was now makingreparation and delaying our assailants The one source of danger wasthe gunIf I durst said the captain Idstop and pick off another manBut it was plain that they meantnothing should dela their shot TheyfmmAs Trelawney fired the ball whistled over ourheadshad never so much as looked at theirfallen comrade though he was notdead and I could see him trying tocrawl awayHeady cried the squireHold cried the captain quick asan echoAnd he and Redruth backed with agreat heave that sent her stern bodilyunder water The report fell in at thesame instant of time This was thefirst that Jim heard the sound of thesquires shot not having reached himWhen the ball passed not one of usprecisely knew but I fancy it musthave been over our heads and that thewind of it may have contributed to ourdisasterAt any rate the boat sunk by thestern quite gently in three feet of water leaving the captain and inyselffacing each other on our feet Theother three took complete headers andcame up again drenched and bubblingSo far there was no great harm Nolives were lost and we could wadeashore in safety But there were allour stores in the bottom and to makethings worse only two guns out offive remained in a state for serviceMine I had snatched from my knees andheld over my head by a sort of instinctAs for the captain he had carried hisover his shoulder by a bandoleer andlike a wise man lock uppermost Thethree had gone down with the boatTo add to our concern we heard voicesalready drawing near us in the woodsalong shore and we had not only thedanger of being cut off from the stockade in our half crippled state but thefear before us whether if Hunter andJoyce were attacked- b half a dozenthey would have the sense and conducto stand firm Hunter was steadythat we knew Joyce was a doubtfulcase a pleasant polite man for a valetand to brush ones clothes but not entirely fitted for a man-of-warWith all this in our minds we wadedashore as fast as we could leaving behind the poor jolly boat and a goodhalf of our powder and provisionsCHAPTER XVIIINARRATIVE CONTINUED BY THEDOCTOR END OF THEFIRST DAYSFIGHTINGWc made our best speed across thestrip of wood that now divided us fromthe stockade and at every step wetook the voices of the buccaneersrang nearer Soon we could hear theirfootsteps as they ran and the cracking of the branches as they breastedacross a bit of thicket1 began to see we should have a brushat p sffMyT wv 5stfor it in earnest and looked to my primingCaptain said I Trelawney is thedead shot Give him your gun hisown is uselessThey exchanged guns and Trelawney silent and cool as he had been sincethe beginning of the bustle hung a moment on his heel to see that all wasfit for service At the same time observing Gray to be unarmed I handedhim my cutlass It did all our heartsgood to see him spit on his hand knithis brows and make the blade singthrough the air It was plain fromevery line of his body that our newhand was Avorth his saltForty paces further we came to theedge of the wood and saw the stockadein front of us We struck the inclosure about the middle of the south sideand almost at the same time seven mutineers Job Anderson the boatswainat their head appeared in full cry atthe southwestern cornerThey paused as if taken aback andbefore they could recover not only thesquire and I but Hunter and Joycefrom the block house had time to fireThe four shots came in rather a scattering volley but they did the business one of the enemy actually felland the rest without hesitation turnedand plunged into the treesAfter reloading we walked down theoutside of the palisade to see the fallenenemy He was stone dead shotthrough the heartWe began to rejoice over our goodsuccess when just at that moment apistol cracked in the bush a ball whistled close pastnry earandpoorTomRedruth stumbled and fell his full length onthe ground Both the squire and I returned the shot but as we had nothingto aim at it is probable we onlywasted powder Then we reloaded andturned our attention to poor TomThe captain and Gray were alreadyexamining him and I saw with half aneye that all was overI believe the readiness of our returnvolley had scattered the mutineers oncemore for we were suffered withoutfurther molestation to get the poor oldgamekeeper hoisted over the stockadeand carried groaning and bleedinginto the log housePoor old fellow he had not utteredone word of surprise complaint fearor even acquiescence from the verybeginning of our troubles till nowwhen we had laid him down in the loghouse to die He had laid like a Trojanbehind his mattress in the gallery hehad followed order silentjy doggedlv and well he was the oldest ofour party by a score of years and nowsullen old serviceable servant it washe that was to dieThe squire dropped down beside himon his knees and kissed his hand crving like a childBe I going doctor he askedTom my man said I youre going homeI wish I had a lick at them with thegun first he repliedTom said the squire say you forgive me wont youWould that be respectful like fromme to you squire was the answerHowsoever so be it amenAfter a little while of silence he saidhe thought somebody might read aprayer Its the custom sir he added apologetically And not long afterwithout another word he passed awayIn the meantime the captain whomI had observed to be wonderfullyswollen about the chest and pocketshad turned out a great many variousstores the British colors a Bible acoil of stoutish rope pen ink the logbook and pounds of tobacco He hadfound a longish fir tree lying felled andcleared in the inclosure and with thehelp of Hunter he Lad set it up at thecorner of the log house where thetrunks crossed and made an angleThen climbing pn the roof he hadwith his jwr band bent and run upthe colorsThis seemed mightily to relieve himHe reentered the log house and setabout counting the stores as if nothing else existed But he had an eyeon Toms passage for all that and assoon as ail was over came forward withanother flag and reverently spread iton the bodyDont you take on sir he saidshaking the squires hand Alls wellwith him no fear for a hand thatsbeen shot down in his duty to captainand owner It niajnt be good divinitybut its a factThen he pulled me asideDr Livesey he said in how manyweeks do you and squire expect theconsortI told him it was a question aot ofweeks but of months that if we werenot back by the end of August Blandlywas to send to find us but neithersooner nor later You can calculatefor yourself I saidWhy yes returned the captainscratching his head and making alarge allowance sir for all the gifts ofProvidence I should say we were pretty close hauledHow do you mean I askedIts a pity sir we lost the secondload what I mean repliedthe captain As for powder and shotwell do But the rations are shortvery short so short Dr Livesey thatwere perhaps as well without that extra mouthAnd he pointed to the dead body under the flagJust then with a roar and a whistlea round shot passed high above therocf of the log house and plumped farbeyond us in the woodOho said the captain Blazeaway Youve little enough powderalready my ladsAt the second trial the aim was better and the ball descended inside thestockade scattering a cloud of sandbut doing no further damageCaptain said the squire thehouse is

all M S B in Black WhiteDOSING SICK CHILDRENSome SiiKTSrcHtions as to How to Administer Medicine Force ShouldBe Lust ResortThat much harm results from the excessive use of medicine is a fact whichnobody will dispute and it is a rulewith the best physicians to give littleor none when it can be avoided Tothis is due much of the success ofhomeopathy for in many cases naturerequires only careful nursing in orderto eilect a cure Nevertheless there arecases in which the administration of adose of medicine is a matter of life anddeath the sole hope of recoveryThen it is if the patient be a child thatthe mother l eaps her reward if she hastaught the child to obey since the doseis taken without trouble or resistanceIt is worse than foil to deceive a childwith the pretense that nauseous medicine is palatable the deception mayavail once but the little one loses allfaith in the assurance and it counts fornaught Far wiser to tell him nonestlythat it tastes badly but it is to do himgood and that as soon as it is taken heshall have something to take the tasteout of his mouth something H possible which he especially likes The pellets in which so many of the modernmedicines are given are far easier totake than were the huge pills of the lastgeneration and it is not often that abitter dose is absolutely necessaryWhen the little patient must be forcedto take the dose do so quietly and firmly hold the hands and nose while thespoon presses down the tongue In theeffort to breathe the medicine whichshould be in liquid form w II be swallowed A medicine glass much better than a spoon and less apt to spillthe contents It ma also be used as ameans of compulsion by turning it upso as to stop the supply of air at thefirst gasp for breath the medicine willbe taken and theglass mar be removedOften a struggle with the patient willdo more harm than good moreovermedicine thus given is apt to be rejected by the stomach In such case thephysician must be appealed to It iseasier to coax a child than to drive itand patient gentle reasoning is seldomwithout effect Force should be usedonly as a last resort Chicago Times-HeraldMarriage Law iH GreeceIn ancient Greece a lw provided thatif a

the moslunsatisfactory things about it remarked an ordnance officer in discussing the war question and though snumber of experiments have been madsIn connection therewith there is no absolute certainty as to the results Ageneral rule has been arrived at whichs thought to be on the safe side of thematter and that is that the modernsteel gun should not be fired more than100 times After that it matters notwhat the emergency may be it is safetto dismantle the gun and send it backto the shop than to risk firing it foithe explosion of a gun is a decidedly andextensively dangerous occurrence to allin its immediate locality The firingof a gun causes the steel to crystallizeand thereby becomes brittle as a fileSo far as has yet been discovered thereis no remedy for it It is not exactly atotal loss after a gun has become deadfor the steel can be used for thousandsof things in the way of bolts braces andthe like for new work and for repairsA modern gun is an expensive affairrunning from 75000 way up It isequally expensive to keep it in operation the cost for each cartridge seatfrom it being over 1000 which doesnot include the putting of the gun onits emplacement or taking it down northe thousands of dollars necessarily expended in paying salaries and subsistence of the officers and men who operateit This crystallization of the metal isone of the mysteries of the science ofordnance The gun could be revivifiedto some extent by heating it to a whiteheat and allowing it to cool off slowlybut the treatment is not exactly satisfactory or even approximately certainas to the results It has been said of uas of other nations that if we keptevery gun we ow n in actual firing operation for even 24 hours the powder andshell bill would bankrupt us and thereis some truth in it This crystallizationof the metal is not confined to gunshowever The same thing occurs in thejournals or axels used on the railroadoars It is for that reason that carefulrailroads put on new axles every fiveor six years In Europe there arc lawsupon the subject though it is customwith us In Germany it is unlawful touse an axle on passenger cars mere thanfour years though the limitation onfreight cars is not so rigid As with theoft fired gun the steel in the journalbecomes so brittle by the crystallizationin consequence ot its use that it is liableto snap in a dozen pieces any time afterits

by thename of Jack although his Christianname was John and in the cattle country they was few men named afterChrists chief disciple who was notknown as Jack We always called himJohn Rooney The last I ever heerd ofhim he were living up in Nebraska notfar from Onallala on the south fork ofthe Platte just after the stream leavesthe Colorado lineThus discoursed a former cattlemanwho is now pursuing a peaceful andcommonplace life in Kansas City theother evening He was talking of lifeon the big cattle range in the days whenthe fame of Dodge City Abilene HayesCity and Ellis was on the wane as toughtowns of Kansas and their upbuilding aslaw abiding communities had begunIn them days he continued ouropenings for fun was less frequent thannational holidays are at present It wasmostly hard riding and lots of it Itgives us all a sorter yearning to bustloose the cinches and raise hell at thefirst opportunity and sometimes theway we did it was as unique as theywas startling The time I speak of inthis pertickler yarn we was grazing abig bunch of cattle mostly long horns inthe Cherokee strip along the northfork of the Canadian river within adays riding of old Fort Supply TheOsages and some other tribes used tocome in there for their green corn andharvest dances and have highfallootinole times in general We all remarksthis and speaks of it sorter scornful because we did not like Injuns much nohow When I say this I dont meanthat Rooney was the one to put thequirt to the Injuns He was overquieton the subject He generally was peacefullike and cam He was a thinkerRooney was and with some schoolingand a little politics would have been agreat man in the city I lowAbout this time the camp begins toget short on grub and some four or fiveof the boys was sent to Medicine Lodgeacross the Kansas line with wagons tobring back a supply of necessaries Kansas was not a prohibition state thenand you could get most any kind ofstimulant in Medioine Lodge that isto say they had rye and Bourbon whisky and I suppose they also had beerIn them days I never could see the virtues of beerAs I was saying you could getabout any kind of liquor you wanted inMedicine Lodge and so we kept prettywell wet Rooney here displayed hissagacity While we all had forgottenall about them pesky Injuns he comesin one day we was to leave and puts into the wagon about 20 of them big roman candles that shoot ten times youknow each shot a big ball of yellowred or bluish flameWhat you going to do with themFourth of July fixings now we all asksseeing as how it was getting closer toThanksgiving1 Never you mind that said Johnkinder winking his eye southeastSo we all was mighty curious duringthe trip back to the Canadian but saysnothing A few days after wegets backthem Injuns begins gathering for a annual feast of some kind and then onenight they prepares fqr one of themdances Of course all of the boys whatcould be spared wanted off to see themonkey business of them redskinsThen John Rooney he called a councilof war and unfolded the secret of themroman candles what be bought at Medicine Lodge He tells all the boys somemD in number to stay with him an3Pleads the way to the timber where the-ghost dance was going on We all takesone of them roman candles and no one- speaks a word or coughs or makes any-loud signsWhen them 800 braves was a tearingup the ground and yelling at the heightof the dance we gets the word fromRooney and lights up them candlessimultaneous and they begin shootingfire and brimstone into them Injunssure enough The boys wasnt used toshooting off them things and was aboutalf scared theirselves at the devilishhissing and the sparks but them Injunswell I cant say what they thoughtbut it was plain how they acted Someof em took to

LesalFoundationNowhere else in the world is thereany position at once so powerful and soanomalous So long as he remainsprime minister the premier of the United Kingdom is possessed of more realpower than any single individual unless it be the czar or the president ofthe United StatesYet great as is the power of primeminister the office has no foundation onlaw The prime minister is quite as unknown to the law as is the cabinet Ifa legal pedant blind to all facts not inthe statutes or the toxtbooks of thecommon law were asked to define theoffice of prime minister and to describethe cabinet he would be utterly at alossIn theory the prime minister is onlya privy councilor at the head of a department of state who is specially inthe sovereigns confidence and who usually presides at an informal gatheringof certain of the privy councilors whohappen to told offices of state a gathering which is called the cabinet Thatis the furthest which the legal pedant ofour thought would dare to go Yet ofcourse the prime minister is in factfar more than the mere chairman of thecabinetThe cabinet no doubt has a greatdeal of power but even if it were trueonce it is certainly not true now thatEngland is governed by a committee of15 or 16 personsThe prime minister as a rule makeshis cabinet He is commissioned by thequeen to form a cabinet because he isthe man whom she considers to possessthe confidence of a majority of the houseof commons He forms his cabinet byasking certain members of the twohouses to hold the great offices of stateHe might do this in one day and without consulting any oneAs a matter of fact what usuallyhappens is this As soon as the commission to form a government has been received the prime miuihter takes intohis confidence the two or three who willhold the chief offices and they talktogether over the other names When aman is decided upon he as a rulejoins the conclave and helps to consultas to men and places and so the cabinetgradually evolves itself No doubt asgenerally happens in this world theprime ministers chcice is never reallyfreeCertain men must be in the cabinetwhatever happens and hence they maybe said not to be chosen by the premierbut to be ministers in their own rightIn spite however of this the fact thatthey are asked to serve by the premiermnfepR thpm fppl hiH snTwrinritv TX7hpruthe cabinet is made the theory of theunwritten constitution is that the cabinet governs In reality it seldom doesanything of the kindEach cabinet minister bas very greatpower in his own department but thecabinet as a cabinet can do little Sincehowever it knows everything that isgofng on it can exercise a great deal ofindirect power The previous knowledge that the majority of the cabinetwould like or dislike a particular poliuy has a great influence but still thecabinet does not rule The prime minister summons presides over and largelyconcrols the cabinet meetings If a vacancy occurs he fills it up and so canpromote- from the lower to the higherofficesThen be can and does confer with hiscolleagues in regard to the business oftheir departments and so has a holdupon thawhole machine of governmentSir Robert Peel saw every member ofhis cabinetrseparately every day Againif there be a difference between twoother members of the government thepremier decides If there be an irreconcilable difference between himself- anda minister it is the minister and notthe premier who resignsLastly the prime minister can fcyreeigning himself dissolve the whole ministry These things small in themselves taken together make the primeministers position what it is Homakes and can unmake a cabinet Hepresides aver it and he has the rightto advise in regard to every departmentthough this right is of course seldomexercised and he has secured to himbeforehand the support of the rank andfile or of any cabinet if it comes to astruggle between him and a colleaguebecause the rank and file know that ifthe premier is beaten he has it in hispower to upset thawhole machine ofgovernmentHence the voices of those who wantto keep in office are always found onthe side of the premier PearsonsWeeklyA Russian MiracleAn iconoclast at a

PREMIERWHAT IT MEANS TO BE THE BRITISHPRIME MINISTER -Nowhere Else In the World Is There AnyPosition at Once So Towerfnl and SoAnomalous The Office 13 Without LegalFoundationNowhere else in the world is thereany position at once so powerful and soanomalous So long as he remainsprime minister the premier of the United Kingdom is possessed of more realpower than any single individual unless it be the ozar or the president ofthe United StatesYet great as is the power of primeminister the office has no foundation onlaw The prime minister is quite as unknown to the law as is the cabinet Ifa legal pedant blind to all facts not inthe statutes or the textbooks of thecommon law were asked to define theoffice of prime minister and to describethe cabinet he would be utterly at alossIn theory the prime minister is onlya privy councilor at the head of a department of state who is specially inthe sovereigns confidence and who usually presides at an informal gatheringof certain of the privy councilors whohappen to told offices of state a gathering which is called the cabinet Thatis the furthest which the legal pedant ofour thought would dare to go Yet ofcourse the prime minister is in factfar more than the mere chairman of thecabinetThe cabinet no doubt has a greatdeal of power but even if it were trueonce it is certainly not true now thatEngland is governed by a committee of15 or 16 personsThe prime minister as a rule makes Ihis cabinet He is commissioned by thequeen to form a cabinet because he isthe man whom she considers to possessthe confidence of a majority of the houseof commons He forms his cabinet byasking certain members of the twohouses to hold the great offices of stateHe might do this in one day and without consulting any oneAs a matter of fact what usuallyhappens is this As soon as the commission to form a government has been received the prime miuihter takes intohis confidence the two or three who willhold the chief offices and they talktogether over the other names When aman is decided upon he as a rulejoins the conclave and helps to consultas to men and places and so the cabinetgradually evolves itself No doubt asgenerally happens in this world theprime ministers chcice is never reallyfreeCertain men must be in the cabinetwhatever happens and hence they maybe said not to be chosen by the premierbut to be ministers in their own rightIn spite however of this the fact thathey are asked to serve by the premierTrmbpa thom fool h in snnarinritv Whomthe cabinet is made the theory of the Punwritten constitution is that the cabinet governs In reality it seldom doesanything of the kindEach cabinet minister has very greatpower in bis own department but thecabinet as a cabinet can do little Sincehowever it knows everything that isgofmg on it can exercise a great deal ofindirect power The previous knowledge that the majority of the cabinetwould like or dislike a particular policy kas a great influence butr still thecabinet does not rule The prime minister summons presides over and largelycontrols the cabinet meetings If a vacancy occurs he fills it up and so canpromote- from the lower to the higherofficesThen be can and does confer with hiscolleagues in regard to the business oftheir departments and so has a holdupon tbawhole machine of governmentSir Robert Peel saw every member- ofhis cabinetrseparately every day Againif there be a difference between twoother members of the government thepremier decides If there be an irreconcilable difference between himself anda minister it is the minister and notthe premier who resignsLastly the prime minister can fcyreeigning himself dissolve the whole ministry These things small in themselves taken together make the primeministers position what it is Homakes and can unmake a cabinet Hepresides ever it and he has the rightto advise in regard to every departmentthough this right is of course seldomexercised and he has secured to himbeforehand the support of the rank andfile or of any cabinet if it comes to astruggle between him and a colleaguebecause the rank and file know that ifthe premier is beaten he has it in bispower to upset the whole machine ofgovernmentHence the voices of those who wantto keep in office are always found onthe side of the premier PearsonsWeeklyA Russian MiracleAn iconoelast at a Russian conventhas
