DONKEY DOG AND GOAT
ter the Taber Opera House in Denver
The dog was called Bill and he was
part of the outfit of a cigar store in the
opera house building Ho was a black
spaniel He was rigged up in Zouave
trousers and jacket trimmed with gold
braid had a tasseled fez on his head
and spectacles on his nose The oddest
thing about him was that he sat on his
haunches with his paws in the airr
actually smoking a cigarette like a con
firmed cigarette fiend I found thathe
had been traiued to smoke the cigarljtftes
while the audience was going intpfche
theater as an advertisement of his own
ers business That was the first time
I had ever seen a dog smoking
I made the acquaintance of the goat
in a tobacco factory in Key West There
were 200 Cubau girls there nearly all
of them pretty and all of them smokers
or chewers of tobacco The goat was
their particular pet He was the biggest
goat I ever saw aimost as large as a
Shetland pony with big branching
horns and perfectly tame He playfully
butted tho girls or pranced arouzad
among them His best trick however
was the larceny of their dinner baskets
He used to go nosing around until he
found a particularly choice 3uncheon
He would knock over the basket seise
the lunch and dash outdoors with it
No amount of chastisement had ever
broken him of the triok Of course I
saw wonderful scenery in the iourney
but the donkey and the dog and the
goat were by long odds the most inter
esting living things that I encountered

A Clever lawyer
An old lawyer in Paris had instruct
ed a very young client of his to weep
every time he struck the desk with his
baud Unfortunately the barrister for
got and struck the desk at the wrong
moment The client fell to sobbing and
crying
What is the matter with yoa2
asked the presiding judge
Well he told me to cry as often as
he struck the table
Here was a nice predicament but
the astute lawyer was equal to the oc
casion Addressing the jury he said
Well gentlemen let me ask you
how you can reconcile the idea of crime
in conjunction with such candor and
simplicity I await your verdict with
the most perfect confidence Ex
