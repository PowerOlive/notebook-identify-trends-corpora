We frankly admit we were agreeably surprised todiscover that a Kiwanian was W agoggle-eyed inhabitant of Mars, or, afreak of some kind. A more thorough representative, branny, handsome set of men never visited Paris,and their visit will be rememberedfor a many a day.The Windsor Hotel furnished thesetting for the visit of the Club,which held their regular weeklymeeting here. The purpose of theirvisit was to explain the aims and objects of the organization, and to laythe groundwork for a similar organization in this city. One of the mainobjects of the Kiwanis Club is to cultivate a closer bond of union andgood fellowship among the businessmen of a town, and great stress waslaid on this feature, in the addressesmade at the luncheon.A delicious luncheon was served inthe dining rooms of the Hotel Windsor, during which addresses weremade a number of Lexington Kiwanians and Paris business men. Mr. C.M. Marshall, president of the Club,presided, and after a brief talk, introduced John Skain, who tookcharge of the meeting. Music wasfurnished by the Kiwanis Club Quartette, who sang Club songs, such as"Mary Jane," "Old Kentucky Home,"etc. John Milward told a group ofhumorous stories, and Prof. EdwardSaxton, of the University of Kentucky, well-known in Paris, read extracts from his 'play, "The Spirit ofKiwanis." Short and interestingtalks were delivered by Dr. J. A.Stucky, J. W. Morrison and Judge Q-.Allison' Holland, of Lexington, response being made by Emmett M.Dickson, of Paris. Good cheer and aspirit of camaradrie prevailedthroughout the meeting, which wa3,in all its essentials, a feast of reasonand flow of soul, literally speaking.The Kiwanis Club members left theimpression of being high-toned, intelligent, up-to-date business men,and their visit was much appreciated.

The farmerhas been following the advice of thedepartment for 20 years, and haskept careful records of his yield. Forthe last 10 years the increase averages more than 10 bushels an acreover previous years. Beyond the extra cost of harvesting, the labor andexpense is no greater than previouslyso the 8.Q00 bushels is regarded asclear gain."Open air housing" of machinerycosts Kentucky farmers approximately $3,080,366 a year, according toestimates made by J. B. Kelley, headof the farm engineering section ofthe College of Agriculture. Thisamount which was estimated fromcensus reports and experiments conducted to determine the respectivelife-time of properly and improperlyhoused farming implements is a fairrepresentation of the annual losssuffered by farmers of the State byleaving machinery in the fields andunder trees. According to the 1920census there is more than $48,354,857 worth of machinery on Kentuckyfarms, the average life of each pieceof which is 15 to 20 years underproper housing conditions. Whenleft exposed to the weather farmtools last only one-half as long, according to the results of experimentswhich show that a properly housedform tool lasts 15 years, while anunproperly housed one lasts but a little more than seven and one-halfyears, un tnis Dasis iaiiure iu uousetheir machinery causes farmers of theState a loss of $6,304,022 a year,whereas the depreciation on machinery which is protected from theweather while idle is only $2,223,'657. Despite the heavy losses causedby leaving machinery exposed toweather conditions many farmers stillfail to give it the proper protectionafter the season's work has been finished, Mr. Kelley said. Many farmimplements are left in the fence cornel s, under trees or in the fieldswhere they were last used with theresult that rust and the action ofthe different weather conditions contribute toward heavy damage.

Some may goto school part of the time and workpart of the time. Those who put infull time on their studies will beable to complete their education jus-tthat much sooner. The same rulewill apply to colleges and universities. There is no reason why our schooland college buildings should standidle for three months or more during a year. This is an economicwaste.And it is a mistake to employteachers for nine months or less ina year.
