serviceZTheir meeting occurs under felicitous conditions justifying sincere congratulationand calling for our grateful acknowledgment to a beneficent Providence which hasso signally blessed and prospered us as aillation Peace and good will with all thenations of the earth continue unbrokenThe extra session of this congress whichclosed during July last enacted Importantlegislation and while its full effect has notjyet been realized what it has already accomplished assures us of its timeliness andwisdom To test its permanent value further time will be required and the peoplesatisfied with its operation and results thusifar are in no mind to withhold from it aiair trialCURRENCY LEGISLATIONCongrross Should Not Hesitate to Enter Upon RevisionTariff legislation having been settled bythe extra session of congress the questionnext pressing for consideration is that ofthe currency The work of putting ourfinances upon a sound basis difficult as itmay seem will appear easier when we recall the financial operations of the government since 1866 On the 30th day of Juneof that year we had outstanding demandliabilities in the sum of 72886844741 Ontthe 1st of January 1S79 these liabilities hadbeen reduced to 443SS94958S Of ourobligations the figures areven more striking On July 1 1866 theprincipal of the interest bearing debt ofthe government was 2332331208 On thefirst day of July 1S93 this sum had beenreduced to 5S5037100 or an aggregate reduction of 1747294108 The interest-bearingdebt of the United States on the firstay of December 1897 was 847365620 Thegovernment money now outstanding December 1 consists of 3466S1016 of UnitedStates notes 107793280 of treasury notesissued by authority of Jthe law of JUS90 384-863503 of silver certificates and 61280761of standard silver dollarsWith the great resources of the government and with the honorable example ofthe past before us we ought not to heslftate to enter upon a currency revisionwhich will make our demand obligationsless onerous to the government and relievelour financial laws from ambiguity anddoubtNo Ground for DistrustThe brief review of what was accomplished from the close of the war to 1893makes unreasonable and groundless anydistrust either of our financial ability orsoundness while the situation from 1893to 1897 must admonish congress of the immediate necessity of so legislating as tomake the return of the conditions thenprevailing impossible There are manyplans proposed as a remedy for the evilBefore we can find the true remedy wemust appreciate the real evil It is notthat our currency of every kind is not goodtuur every uuiiai uj u is guuu goou oecauseithe governments pledge is out to keep Itso and that pledge will not be brokenHowever the guaranty of our purpose tokeep the pledge will be best shown byadvancing toward its fulfillmentEvil of the Present SystemThe evil of the present system is found inthe great cost to the government or maintaining the parity of our different forms ofimonu that is keeping all of them at parwith gold We surely cannot be longer- heedless of the burden this imposes upont people even unuer iainy prosperouscuuuiuuus wuuu te pusi iuur years navethat It is not only an expensive cnarge upon tne government butla dangerous menace to the national creditMust Provide Against Bond issuesIt is manifest that we must devise somerplan to protect the government againstibond issues for repeated redemptions Wemust either curtail the opportunity forSpeculation made easy by tne multipliedredemptions of our demand obligations ordncrease the gold reserve for their redemption We have 900000000 of currencywhich the government by solemn enactment has undertaken to keep at par withgold Nobody is obliged to redeem in goldiinit the government The banks are notrequired to redeem in gold The government Is obliged to keep equal with gold allits outstanding currency and coin obligations while its receipts are not requiredto be paid in gold ney are paid in everyKind of money but gold and the only meansoy which the government can with certaihty get gold is by borrowing It can getit in no other way when it most needs itThe government without any fixed goldrevenue is pledged to maintain gold redemption which it has steadily and faithfully done and which under the authority now given it will continue to doThe law which requires the governmentafter having redeemed its United Statesnotes to pay them out again as currentfunds demands a constant replenishmentof -the gold reserve This is especially soin times of business panic and when therevenues are insufficient to meet tne expenses of the government At such timesxhe government has no other way to supply its deficit and maintain redemption butthrough the increase of its bonded debt asduring the administration of my predecessor when 262315400 of 4j per cent bondswere issued and sold and tlie proceeds usedto pay the expenses of the government inexcess of the revenues and sustain thegold reserve While it is true that thegreater part of the proceeds of these bonuswas used to supply deficient retnues uconsiderable portion was required to maintain the gold reserveWith our revenues equal to our expenses-there would be no deficit requiring ine issuance of bonds But if the gold reservefalls below 100000000 how will it be replenished except by selling more bonusIs there any other way practicable underexisting law The serious question then isShall we continue the policy that has beenpursued in the past that is when the goldreserve reaches the point of danger issueanore bonds and supply the needed gold orshall we provide other means to preventthese recurring drains upon the gold reserve If no lurther legislation is Had andthe policy of selling bonds is to be continued then congress should give the secretary of the treasury authority to sell bondsat long or short periods bearing a less rateof interest than is now authorized by lawAn Obvious Duty1 earnestly recommend us soon as thereceipts of the government are quite sutlicient to pay all the expenses or the government that when any ot the UnitedStates notes are presented tor redemptionin gold and are redeemed in gold sucli notesshall be Kept and set apart and only paidout m exchange for gold This is an obviousjrduty If the holder of the UnitedStates note prefers the gold and gets itfrom the government he should not receivehack from the government a United Statesnote without paying gold in exchange torit The reason lor this is made all themore apparent when the government issuesan Interest bearing debt to provide goIJfor the redemption of United States notesa nonlnterest bearing debt Surely itshould not pay them out again except ondemand and for gold If they are put outin any other way they may return again tobe followed by another bond issue to redeem them another Interest bearing debtto redeem a noninterest bearing debtIndorses Secretary Gages PlanThe secretary of the treasury has outlined a plan In great detail for tne purposeof removing the threatened recurrence ora depleted gold reserve and saving us fromfuture embarrassment on that account Tothis Dlan X invite JUUJ tmciuition 1 concur with the secretary of thetreasury in his recommendation that paHnna1 banks be allowed to issue notes tothe face value of the bonds which theyhave deposited for circulation and

that national banks be required to redeem theirnotes in goldTHE CUBAN QUESTIONTlie Time Not Ripe for Interventionon Our PartThe most important problem with whichthis government is now called upon to dealpertaining to its foreign relations concernsIts duty toward Spain and the Cuban insurrection Problems and conditions more orless In common with those now existinghave confronted this government at various times in the past The story of Cubafor many Kui s has been one of unrestgrowing discontent an effort toward alarger enjoyment of liberty and self-controlof organized resistance to the mothercountry of depression after distress andwarfare and of ineffectual settlement to befollowed by renewed revolt For no enduring period since the enfranchisement of thecontinental possessions of Spain in thewestern continent has the condition ofCuba or the policy of Spain toward Cubanot caused concern to the United StatesThe prospect from time to time that theweakness of Spains hold upon the islandand the political vicissitudes and embarrassments of the home erovernment mightlead to the transfer of Cuba to a continental power called forth btwoin lfe2 rH1860 various emphatic declarations of thepolicy of the United States to permit no disturbance of Cubas connection with Spainunless In the direction of independence oracquisition by us through purchase norhas there been any change of this declaredpolicy since upon the part of the governmentNot Civilized WarfareThe cruel policy of concentration wasInitiated February 16 1896 The productivedistricts controlled by the Spanish armieswere depopulated The agricultural inhabitants were herded in and about tne garrison towns their lands laid waste andtheir dwellings destroyed This policy thelate cabinet of Spain justified as a necessary measure of war and as a means of cutting off suplies from the insurgents It hasutterly failed as a war measure It wasnot civilized warfare It was exterminationProtests EnteredAgainst this abuse of the rights of warI have felt constrained on repeated occasions to enter the firm and earnest protest of this government There was muchof public condemnation of the treatment ofAmerican citizens by alleged illegal arrestsand long imprisonment awaiting trial orpending protracted judicial proceedings Ifelt it my first duty to make instant demand for the release or speedy trial of allAmerican citizens under arrest Before thechange of the Spanish cabinet in Octoberlast 22 prisoners citizens of the UnitedStates had been eriven their freedom Forthe relief of our own citizens suffering because of the conflict the aid of congress wassought in a special message and underthe appropriation of April 4 1S97 effectiveaid has been given to American citizens InCuba many of them at their own requesthaving been returned to the United StatesThe Present InsurrectionThe present insurrection broke out InFebruary 1895 It Is not my purpose at thistime to recall Its remarkable increase orto characterize its tenacious resistanceagainst the enormous forces massedagainst It by Spain The revolt and theefforts to subdue it carried destruction toevery quarter of the island developingwide proportions and defying the effortsof Spain for its suppression The civilizedcode of war has been disregarded no lessso by the Spaniards than by the CubansThe existing conditions cannot but fillthis government and the American peoplewith the gravest apprehension There isno desire on the part of our people toDrofit bv the misfortunes of Spain Wehave only the desire to see the Cubansprosperous and contented enjoying thatmeasure of self control which is the inalienable right of man protected in theirright to reap the benefit of the exhaustlesstreasures of their countryThe offer made by my predecessor inApril 1896 tendering the friendly officesof this government failed Any mediationon our part was not accepted In brief theanswer read There is no effectual wayto pacify Cuba unless It begins with theactual submission of the rebels to themother country Then only could Lpainact in the premised direction of her ownmotion and after her own plansMinister Woodfords InstructionsThe instructions given to our new minister to Spain before his departure for hispost directed him to impress upon that government the sincere wish of the UnitedStates to lend Its aid toward the endingof the war In Cuba by reaching a peace-ful and lasting- result just and honorablealike to Spain and to the Cuban peopleThose instructions recited the characterand duration of the contest the widespreadlosses it entails the burdens and restraintsit imposes upon us with constant disturbance of national interests and the injury resulting from an indefinite continuance ot this state of things It was statedthat at this juncture our government wasconstrained to seriously inquire if the timewas not ripe when Spain of her own volition moved by her own interests and everysentiment of humanity should put a stopto this destructive war and make proposals of settlement honorable to herselfand just to her Cuban colony It was urgedthat as a neighboring nation with large Interests In Cuba we could oe required towait only a reasonable time for the mothercountry to establish its autnonty and restore order within the borders of the islandthat we could not contemplate an indefinite period for the aceornpifMmijui oiresultNo Humiliation SuggestedNo solution was proposed to which theslightest idea of humiliation to Spaincould attach and indeed precise proposalswere withheld to avoid embarrassment tothat government All that was askedor expected was that some safe way mightbe speedily provided and permanent peacerestored It so chanced that the consideration of this offer addressed to the sameSpanish administration which had declinedthe tenders of my predecessor and whichfor more than two years had poured menand treasure into Cuba in the fruitless effort to suprpess the revolt fell to othersSnaiii Promises 31uuhThe reply to our note was received on the23d day of October It is in the direction ofa better understanding it appreciates thelriendly purposes of this government Itadmits that our country is deeply alfectedby the war in Cuba and that its desiresfor peace are just It declares that thepresent Spanish government is bound byevery consideration to a change of policythat should satisfy the United States anupacify Cuba within a reasonable timeTo this end bpuiu has ueeiueu to put intoeffect the political retorms heretoiore advocated by the present premier withouthalting for any consideration in the pathwhich m its judgment leads to peace Themilitary opeiatiuixs it is said will continueput will be humane and conducted with allregard for private rights being accompanied bi political action leading to theaiitoiiom of Cuba while guaiding Spanishsovereignty This it is claimed will resultin investing Cuna with a distinct personality the island to be governed by an executive and by a local eouncil or chamberreserving to Spain the control of the foreign relations the army and navy and thejudicial administration To accomplishthis the present government proposes tomodity existing legislation by decree leaving the Spanish cortes with the aid ofCuban senators and deputies to solve theeconomic problem and properly distributethe existing debt In the absence of adeclaration of the measure that this overnment proposes to take in carryinoutits proffer pt good offices it suggests thatSpain be lett free to conduct militaryoperations and grant political reformswhile the United States for its part shallenforce its neutral obligations and cut olfthe assistance which it is asserted the insurgents receive from this country Thesupposition of an indefinite prolongation ofthe war is denied It is asserted that thewestern piovinces are already well nigh reclaimed that the planting of cane and tooacco therein has been resumed and thatby force of arms and new and ample relorrns very early and complete pacificationis hoped forHave Not Failed in Our DutyThe immediate amelioration of existingconditions under the new administrationof Cuban affairs is predicted and therewithall the disturbance and all occasion forany change of attitude on the part of theUnited States Discussion of the questionof the international duties and resnnnHnities of the United States as Spain understands them is presented with an apparent disposition to charge us with failure Inthis regard This charge Is without anybasis In fact It could not have been madeif Spain had been cognizant of the constant efforts this government has made atthe cost of millions end by the employmentof the administrative machinery of the nation That it has successfully preveiurthe departure of a single military expedition or aimed vessel from our shores inviolation oi our laws would seem to be asufficient answer But of this aspect ofthe Spanish note it is not necessary toapeak further now Firm In the convictionlomaticcourseThe Untried MeasuresOf the untried measures there remainoiuy Recognition ir the insurgent asbelligerents recognition of the independence of Cuba neutral intervention to endthe war by imposing a rational compromisebetween the contestants and interventionin favor of one or the other party I speaknot of forcible annexation for that cannot be thought of That by our code ofmorality would be criminal aggressionRecognition of InsurgentsRecognition of the belligerency of theCuban insurgents has often been canvassed as a possible If not inevitable stepboth in regard to the previous ten yearsstruggle and during the present war lamnot unmindful that the two houses of congress in the spring of 1896 expressed theopinion by concurrent resolution that acondition of public war existed requiringor justifying the recognition of the state ofbelligerency in Cuba and during the extra session the senate voted a joint resolution of like import which however wasnot brought to a vote in the house of representatives In the presence of these significant expressions of the sentiment of thelegislative branch It behooves the executive to sooeriy consiaer tne conditions under which so important a measure mustneeds rest for justification It Is to beseriously considered whether the Cubaninsurrection possesses beyond dispute theattributes of statehood which alone demand the recognition of belligerency in It3favor Possession in short of the essential qualifications of sovereignty by theinsurgents and the conduct of the war bythem according to the received code otwar are no less Important factors towardthe determination of the problem of belligerency than are the influences and consequences of the struggle upon the Internalpolicy of the recognizing stateQuotes President GrantThe utterances of President Urant in hismemorable message of December 7 1S75are signally relevant to present situation in Cuba and It may be wholesome nowto recall them -At that time a ruinousconflict had for seven years wasted theneighboring island During all those jearsan utter disregard of the laws of civilizedwarfare and of the just demands of humanity which called forth expressions ofcondemnation from the nations of Christendom continued unabated Desolationenormously affecting the commerce of allcommercial nations but that of the UnitedStates more than any other by reason ofproximity and larger trade and intercourseAt that Juncture Grant uttered thesewords which now as then sum up the elements of the problem A recognition ofthe independence of Cuba being in myopinion Impracticable and indefensible thequestion which next presents itself Isthat of the recognition of belligerent rightsIn the parties to the contest In a formermessage to congress I had occasion to consider this question and reached the conclusion that the conflict In Cuba dreadfuland devastating as were its incidents didnot rise to the fearful dignity of warIt is possible that the acts of foreignpowers and even acts of Spain herself ofthis very nature might be pointed to In defense of such recognition But now as inits past history the United States shouldcarefully avoid the false lights which mightlead It Into the mazes df doubtful law andof questionable propriety and adhere rigidly and sternly to the rule which has beenIts guide of doing only that wnicn isright and honest and of good report Thequestion of according or of withholdingrights of belligerency must be judged inevery case in view of the particular attending facts Unless justified by necessityIt is always and justly regarded as an unfriendly act and a gratuitous demonstration of moral support to the rebellion Itis necessary and it is required when theInterests and rights of another governmentor or its people are so iar aitecteu Dy apending civil conflict as to require adefinition of its relations to the partiesthereto But this conflict must be onewhich is recognized in the sense of international law as warRecognition Not JustifiedBelligerence too is a fact The mereexistence of contending armed bodies andtheir occasional conflicts do not constitutewar in the sense referred to Applying tothe existing condition of affairs in Cubathe tests recognized by publicists and writers on international law and which havebeen observed by nations of dignity honesty and power

materialsuch occupation of territory as to take thecontest out of the category of a mere rebellious insurrection or occasional skirmishes and place it on the terrible footing of war to which a recognition of belligerency would aim to elevate itThe contest moreover Is solely onland the insurrection has not possessedItself of a single seaport whence it maysend forth its flag nor has it any rneans ofcommunication with foreign powers except through the military lines of Its adversaries No apprehension of any ofthose sudden and difficult complicationswhich war upon the ocean is apt to precipitate upon the vessels both commercialand national and upon consular officers ofother powers calls for the definition oftheir relations to the parties to the contestConsidered as a question of expediency Iregard the accordance of belligerent rightsstill to be as unwise and premature as I regard it to be at present indefensible as ameasure of rightSuch recognition entails upon the country

between all of them and thestates on the Pacific passes through thewaters which wash the shoivs of CubaThe exercise of this supervision couldscarce tail to lead if not to abuses certainly to collisions perilous to the peacefulrelations of the two states There can belittle doubt as to what result such supervision would Deiore long uraw mis nationIt would be unworthy of the United Statesto inaugurate the possibilities of such result by measures of questionable right orexpediency or by any indirectionWhat Ieeofiiitioii Would MeanTurning to the practical aspects of a recognition of belligerency and reviewing itsinconveniences and positive dangers stilllurther pertinent considerations appearIn the code of nations there is no such thingas a naked recognition of belligerency unaccompanied by the assumption of international neutrality Such recognition willnot confer upon either party to a domesticconflict a status not heretofore actualpossessed or effect the relation of eitherparty to other states The act of recognition usually takes the form of a solemnproclamation of neutrality which recitesthe de facto condition ot belligerency asits motive It announces a domestic lawof neutrality in declaring state 1 1 assumesthe international obligations of a neutralin the presence of a public state of war Itwarns ail citizens and others within thejurisliction of the proclaimant that thevviolate those righteous obligations at theirown peril and cannot expect to be shieldedfrom the consequences The right of visitand search on the seas and seizure of vessels and cargoes and contraband of warand gqpd prize under admiralty law mustunder international law be admitted as nlegitimate consequence of a proclamationof belligerency hile according the equalbelligerent rights defined by public law toeach party in our ports disfavors would beimposed on both which whili nominallyequal would weigh heavily in behalf ofSpain herself Possessing a navy and controlling the ports of Cuba her maritimerights could be asserted not only for themilitary investment of the island but up tothe margin of our own territorial watersand a condition of things would exist forwhich the Cubans within their own domaincould not hope to create a parallel whileits creation through aid or sympathy fromwithin our domain would be even more impossible than how with the additional obligations of international neutrality wewould perforce assumeItcKrarded at Present as UnwiseThe enforcement Of this enlarged and onerous code of neutrality would only beInfluential within our own jurisdiction byenforcethe conduct of the strife withinthe paramount authority of Spain according to the international code of war Forthese reasons I regard the recognition ofthe belligerency of the Cuban insurgentsas now unwise and therefore inadmissableShould that step hereafter be deemed wiseas a measure of right and duty the executive will take itInterventionIntervention upon humanitarian groundshas beenjfrequently suggested and has notfailed to receive my most anxious andearnest consideration But should such astep be now taken when It Is apparentthat a hopeful change has supervened inthe policy of Spain toward Cuba A newgovernment has taken office in the mothercountryVlt is pledged in advance to thedeclaration that all the efforts of the worldcannot suffice to maintain peace in Cubaby the bayonet that vague promises of reform after subjugation afford no solutionof the Insular problem that with a substitution of commanders must come achange of the past system of warfare forone in harmony with a new policy whichshall no longer aim to drive the Cubans tothe horrible alternative of taking to thethicket or succumbing In misery that reforms must be instituted in accordancewith the needs and circumstances of thetime and that these reforms while designed to give full autonomy to the colonyand to create a virtual entity and self-controlledadministration shall yet conserveand affirm the sovereignty of Spain by aJust distribution of powers and burdensupon a basis of mutual interest untaintedby methods of selfish expediencyLies In Honorable PathsThe first acts of the new government HeIn these honorable paths The policy ofcruel rapine and extermination that solong shocked the universal sentiment ofhumanity has been reversed Under thenew military commander a broad clemencyis proffered Measures have already beenset on Toot to relieve the horrors of starvation The power of the Spanish armies itis asserted is to be used not to spread ruinand desolation but to protect the resumption of peaceful agricultural pursuits andproductive industries That past methodsare f mile to force a peace by subjugation Isfreely admitted and that ruin without conciliation must inevitably fall to win forSpain the fidelity of a contented dependency Decrees in application of the foreshadowed reforms have already been promulgatedShould Give Spain a ChanceThat the government of Sagasta has entered upon a course from which recessionwith honor 13 impossible can hardly bequestioned that in the few weeks it hasexisted -it has made earnest of the sincerityof its professions Is undeniable I shall notimpugn Its sincerity nor should Impatiencebe suffered to embarrass It in the task Ithas undertaken It Is honestly due Spainand to our friendly relations with Spainthat she should be given a reasonablechance to realize her expectations and toprove the asserted efficacy of the new order or tnings to which she stands irrevocably committed She has recalled thecommander whose brutal orders Inflamedthe rAmeTican mind and shocked the civilized world She has modified the horribleorder of concentration and has undertakento care for the helpless and permit thosewho desire to resume the cultivation oftheir fields to do so and assures them dfthe protection of the Spanish governmentin their lawful occupations She has lustreleased the Competitor prisoners heretofore sentenced to death and who havebeen the subject of repeated diplomaticcorrespondence during both this and thepreceding administrationWill Not Hesitate to ActNot a single American citizen is

Require Continuation of the TreatyBy a special message dated the 16th daVof June last I laid before the senate atreaty signed that day by the plenlpotarles of the United States and of the republic of Hawaii having for its purpose theincorporation of the Hawaiian Islands asan integral part of the United States andunder its sovereignty The senate havingremoved the Injunction ot secrecy althoughthe treaty is still pending before that bodythe subject may be properly referred to inthis message because the necessary actionof the congress is required to determine bylegislation many details of the eventualunion should the fact of annexation be accomplished as 1 believe it shqud beWhile consistently disavowing from avery early period any aggressive policy ofabsorption In regard to the Hawaiiangroup a long series of declarations throughthree quarters of a century has proclaimedthe vital interest of the United States in theindependent life of the islands and theirintimate commercial dependence upon thiscountry At the same time it has been repeatedly asserted that in no event could theentity of Hawaiian statehood cease by thepassage of the islands under the domination or influence of another power than theUnited States Under these circumstancesthe logic of events required that annexation heretofore offered but declined snouldin the ripeness of time come about as thenatural result of the strengthening tiesthat bind us to those islands and be realized by the free will of the Hawiian stateThat treaty was unanimously ratifiedwithout amendment by the senate and president of the republic of Hawaii on the 10thof September last and only awaits the favorable action of the American senate toeffect the complete absorption of theislands into the domain of the United StatesWhat the conditions of such a union shallbe the political relation thereol to theUnited States the character of the localadministration the quality and degree otthe elective franchise of the inhabitantsthe

treatyhas wisely relegated to the congressShould lie ConfirmedIf the treaty is confirmed as every consideration of dignity and honor requiresthe wisdom of congress will see to it thatavoiding abrupt

NecessaryThe territory of Alaska requires theprompt and early attention of congressThe conditions now existing demand mate-rial changes in the laws relating to theterritory The great influx of populationduring the past summer and fall and theprospect of a still larger immigration inthe spring win not permit us to longerneglect the extension of civil authoritywithin the territory or postpone the establishment of a more thorough government A general system of public surveys has not been extended to Alaska andall entries thus far made in that district areupon special surveys The act of congressextending to Alaska the mining laws ofthe United States contained the reservation that it shouldnot be construed to put inforce the general land laws of the countryBy act approved March 3 1891 authoritywas given for entry of lands for townsite purposes and also for the purchase ofnot exceeding 160 acres then or thereafteroccupied for purposes of trade and manufacture j he purpose of congress as thusfar expressed has been that only suchrights should apply to that territory asshould be specuicallly namedAs It Is to the interest of the government to encourage the settlement of thecountry and Its duty to follow up Its citizens with the benefit of legal machinery1 earnestly urge upon congress the establishment of a system of government withsuch flexibility as will enable It to adjustitself to the future areas of greatest populationRelief Is NeededThe startling though possibly exaggerated reports from the Yukon river country of the probable shortage of food forthe large number of people who are wintering there without the means of leavingthe country are confirmed in such measureas to justify bringing the matter to theattention of congress Access to thatcountry in winter can be had only by thepasses from Dyea and vicinity which isa most difficult and perhaps an impossibletask However should these reports of thesuffering of our fellow citizens be furtherverified every effort at any cost should bemade to carry them reliefTHE INDIANSNeeds of White Residents in the Territory Must He ConsideredFor a number of years past it has beenapparent that the conditions under whichthe five civilized tribes were establishedIn the Indian territory under treaty provisions with the United States with theright of self government and the exclusion of all white persons from withintheir borders have undergone so completea change as to render the continuance ofthe system thus inaugurated practicallyImpossible The total number of the livecivilized tribes as shown by the last censusis 45491 and this number has not materially Increased while the white population isestimated at from 200000 to 250000 whichbv permission of the Indian governmenthas settled In the territory The presentarea of the Indian territory contains 25694564 acres much of which is very fertile land The United States citizens residing in the territory most cf whom havegone there by invitation or with the consent of the tribal authorities have madepermanent homes for themselves Numerous towns have been built in which from500 to 5000 white people now reside Valuable residences and business houses havebeen erected in many of them Large business enterprises are carried on inwhich vast sums of money are employed and yet these people whohave Invested their capital in the development of the productive resources of thecountry are without title to the land theyoccupy and have no voice whatever in thegovernment eitner oi tne nations or inoeaThousands of their children who were bornin the territory are of school age but thedoors oMhe schools of the nations are shutagainst them and what education they getis by private contribution No provisionfor the protection of the life or propertyof these white citizens is made by thetribal governments and courtsAn Indian AristocracyThe secretary of the interior reports thatleading Indians have absorbed great tractsof land to the exclusion of the common people and government Ty an Indian aristocracy has been practically established tothe detriment of the people It has beenfound impossible for the United States tokeep its citizens out of the territory andthe executory conditions contained intreaties with these nations have for themost part become impossible of executionNor has It been possible for the tribal governhnents to secure to each individualIndian his full enjoyment in common withother Indians of the common property ofthe nations Friends of the Indians havelong believed that the best interests of theIndians of the five civilized tribes wouldbe found In American citizenship with allthe rights and privileges which belong tothat conditionThe Dawes CommissionBy section 16 of the act of March 3 1893the president was authorized to appointthree commissioners to enter into negotiations with the Cherokee Choctaw Chickasaw Muskogee or Creek and Seminole nations commonly known as the Five Civilized Tribes in the Indian territory Briefly the purposes of the negotiations wereto be The extinguishment of tribal titlesto any lands within that territory nowheld by any and all such nations ortribes either by cession of the same orsome part thereof to the United States orby allotment and division of the same inseveralty among1 the Indians of such nations or tribes respectively as may be entitled to the same or by such other methodas may be agreed upon between the sevoral nations and tribes aforesaid or eachof them with the United States with hview to such an adjustment upon tho basisof lusticc and equity as may with the consent of the said nations of Indians o faras may be necessary be requisite and suitable to enable the ultimate creation oa state or states of the union which shallembrace the lands within said Indian territoryThe commission met much oppositionfrom the beginning The Indian wereverv slow to actand thoe in control manifested a decided disinclination to meetwith favor the propositions submitted tothem A little more than three year afterthis organization the commission effectedan agreement with the Choctaw nationalone The Chickasaws however refusedto acrree to Us terms and as they havea common interest with tho Choctaws inthp lands of said nations the agreementwith thf latter nation could have no effect without tbp consent of the formerOn April 21 1S97 the commission effpetedan

plenipotentiary to undertake the requisite negotiations with foreign countries desiring toavail themselves of these provisions Thenegotiations are now proceeding with several governments both European

the first class 16torpedo boats and one submarine boat Noprovision has yet been made for the armorof three of the five battle ships asit hasbeen impossible to obtain it at thd pricefixed by congress It is of great importancethat congress provide this armor as untilthen the ships are of no fighting valueThe present naval force especially In viewof its increase by the ships now under construction while not as large as that of afew other powers is a formidable forceits vessels are the very best of each typeand with the increase that should be madeto it from time to time in the future andcareful attention to keeping it in a highstate of efficiency and repair it is welladapted to the necessities of the countryThe great increase of the navy which hastaken place in recent years was justified bythe requirements for national defense andhas received public approbation The timehas now arrived however when this Increase to which the country is committedshould for a time take the form of increased facilities commensurate with theincrease of our naval vessels It is an unfortunate fact that there is only one dockon the Pacific coast capable of docking ourlRrcest shins and only one on the Atlanticcoast and that the latter has for the lastsix or seven months been under repair andtherefore incapable of use Immediatesteps should be taken to provide three orfour docks of this capacity on the Atlanticcoast at least one on the Pacific coast anda floating dock on the gulf This is therecommendation of a very competentboard appointed to investigate the subject There should also be ample provisionmade for powder and projectiles and othermunitions of war and for an increasednumber of officers and enlisted men Someauditions are also necessary to our navyyards for the repair and care of our largeruumber of vessels As there are now onthe stocks five battleships of the largestclass which can not be completed for ayear or two I concur with the recommendation of the secretary of the navy for anappropriation authorizing the constructionof one battleship for the Pacific coastwhere at present there is only one in commission and one under construction while6n the Atlantic coast there are three incommission and four under constructionand also that several torpedo boats beauthorized In connection with our general system of coast defenseOUIC MERCHANT MAKIXEIt Inferiority a Humiliation to

should do ourfull share of the carrying trade of theworld We do not do it now We shouldbe the lagger no longer The inferiority ofour merchant marine is justly humiliating to the national pride The

thafarm and the factoryTHE PACIFIC RAILWAYSShould Government Become a Oidderfor the Kansas PacliicfThe Union Pacific railway main linewas sold under the decree of the UnitedStates court for the district of Nebraskaon the 1st and 2d of November of this yearThe amount due the government consistedof the principal of the subsidy bonds 27236512 and the accrued interest thereon3121171175 making the total Indebtedness5844822375 The bid at the sale coveredthe first mortgage Hen and the entire mortgage claim of the government principaland interestThe sale of the subsidized portion of theKansas Pacific line upon which the government holds a second mortgage lienhas been postponed at the instance of thegovernment to December 16 1S97 The debtof this division of the Union Pacific railwayto the government on November 1 1897was the principal of the subsidy bonds6303000 and the unpaid and accrued interest thereon 662669033 making a totalof 1292969033 The sale of this road wasoriginally advertised for November 4 butfor the purpose of securing the utmostpublic notice of the event it was postponeduntfL December 16 and a second advertisement of the sale was made By thedecree of the court the upset price on thesale of the Kansas Pacific will yield tothe government the sum of 2500000 overnil nrior liens costs and charires Tf nnOthen or better bid is made this sum isT3Jan tnat tne government win receive onitsclaim of nearly 13000000 The governmenthas no information as to whether therewill be other bidders or a better bid thanthe minimum amount herein stated Thequestion presented therefore is whethertne government shall under the authoritygiven it by the act of March 3 1887 purchaseor redeem the road in the event that abid is not made by private parties coveringthe entire government claimTo qualify the government to bid at thesales will require a deposit of 900000 asfollows In the government cause 500000and In each of the first mortgage causes200000 and in the latter the deposit mustbe in cash Payment at the sale Is asfollows Upon the acceptance of tne bida sum which with the amount alreadydeposited shall equal 15 per cent of thebid the balance in installments of 25 percent 30 40 and 50 days after the confirmation of the sale The Hen on the KansasPacific prior to that of the governmenton the 30th of July 1S97 principal and interest amounted to 7281 04S11 Thetherefore should it become the highest bidder will have to pay the amount ofthe first mortgage lien I believe that underthe act of 1887 It has the authority to dothis and in absence of any action by congress I shall direct the secretary of thetreasury to make the necessary deposit asrequired by the courts decree to qualifyas a bidder and to bid at the sale a sumwhich will at least equal the principal ofthe debt due the government but suggestin order to remove all controversy that anamendment of the law be immediatelyprfssed explicitly giving such powers andappropriating in general terms whateversum is sufficient thereforIn so important a matter as the government becoming the possible owner ofrailroad property which It perforce mustconduct and operate I feel constrained tolay before congress those facts for itsconsideration and action before the consummation of the sale It is clear to mymind that the government should not permit the property to beiNold at a price whichwill yield less than one half of the principal of its debt and less than one fifth ofits entire debt principal and interestBut whether the government rather thanaccept less than its claim should become abidder and thereby the owner of the property I submit to the congress for actionCIVIL SERVICEDistinct Advance Made in Operationof tlie LawThe important branch ot our governmentknown as the

political reasons have beencarefully guarded against the examinations for admittance to the service enlarged and at the same time rendered lesstechnical and more practical and a distinct advance has been made by giving ahearing before dismissal upon all caseswhere incompetency is charged or demandmade for the removal of officials In any ofthe uepartments This order has been madeto give to the

cross my- trusty blade with gallant young Sir HughThough yonder travler saith the plaguehath laid the city bareNo fear will daunt mine enemy the stripling will be thereThen forth in glittering mail he rode tokeep his solemn plightFor be the issue what it may tis honorrules a knightBeneath the August sun he fared hishelmet white with dustAnd laughed at them who fled the plagueYe fly as cowards mustAt noon he saw the town arise from outthe yellow mistIn which St Hildas spires stood dark ascut in amethystWide open stood the gates the sun waswhitening the squareThe still air stirred with song nor sighwith laugh nor moan nor prayerNo fountain leapt no lattice swung acrossthe empty sillLike an enchanted town It slept in silencedeep and chillThe traveler spake truth Sir Rupertmuttered neath his breathThe city hath been swept full bare bythe black wings of deathBeyond the farther wall a plain made freeand open spaceAnd thither Rupert spurred in haste toreach the meeting placeLo without armor squire or steed SirHugh stood there aloneHis dauntless eyes were strangely brighthis cheeks with fever shoneDefend thee quick he cried Theplague would steal this joust from meBut Ill not yield to death till I have aimedone blow at theeIy vassals fled my gates my kinsmen leftme there to dieHere have I crawled to keep our tryst Thyprowess I defyHe leaned upon his good broad blade thatbent beneath his weightHis voice was feeble but his words withknightly scorn were greatDown rang Sir Ruperts armor thengreaves helmet shield and allHe flung his baldric set with gems againstthe city wallAnd low upon his knee he bent I will nottilt he said41 jield my sword Now an thou wiltstrike thou a coward deadHughs sudden flush of scorn thrilled tohis very finger tipsBut ere he spoke the plagues gray handwas on his quivring lipsA ruddy mist rolled round and up andblotted out the skiesAnd showrs of fiery whirling sparks beaton his darkened eyesHis stout heart trembled and stood stillbeset with vague alarmsSir Rupert caught him as he fell in strongand tender armsIn shepherds cot of sun dried turf uponthe breezy hillHis stricken foe he gently laid and nursedwith care and skillHeld water to the blackened lips the burning forehead lavedTioved him that kept his plighted tryst anddeath and Rupert bravedWhile he who tossed through fevered daysa guerdon gained of loveFor

woman untied her girdleand unbound her hair and a slave undidher sandals and her naked feet andslightly veiled bosom shrank from thekeen cold of all the winds blowingthrough the pierced pillars and theclinging chill of the wet white floorbingThoubride ofart no more my sister butthe moon and sister ofthe moon cried her brotherHe held her hand fast in cruel kindnessand led her up the dripping

greatwrong They were equal partners inseveral tsmall mining ventures in Colorado 20 years ago and seemed to getalong pretty well together but it happened that just at the time they weretrying to get possession of a certaintract of silver mining land which mybrother was confident would enrichthem both Tom was compelled to return to New York on important business of his own Now my brotherThomas Farleigh was known to be anexceptionally good judge of mineral indications and it often happened thatwhen he showed interest in propertythe owners would refuse to sell at anyreasonable price So in this case MrStrong proposed to him that he be notknown in the transfer at all but thathe leave in his handsUiis part of the purchase money and let the property bemade over to him while Tom was inNew York My brother thought it agood idea and consented leaving all hissavings something over 5000 withStrong simply on the assurance that onhis return he should have a deed to ahalf interest in the propertyStrong no doubt meant to be honestand I believe only an accident to mybrother prevented him from being soOntToms way to New York he fell fromatrain at Cincinnati struck his headagainst a stone and was taken insensible to a hospital The doctors said hisskull was fractured and he became insane-From the hospital I had himtaken to a private asylum where I remained with him as long as I couldAfter I left Cincinnati Mr Strong heardof the accident and went to see himMy brother did not recognize him andbelieving that Tom would never be restored to his right mind Mr Strongsaid nothing to anyone about the moneyput into his hands by my brother Hewent ahead and organized a big company of eastern capitalists to operatethe mine They struck a rich vein andStrong became wealthy at onceAbout five years afterwards a skillful surgeon trepanned my brothersskull relieved the pressure on the brainand restored his reason Tom of courseremembered the last transaction withhis old partner and hearing of Strongsgreat success at once set about tryingto recover an interest in his fortuneMr Strong was not I believe a very badman and he would have been willingto undo what he had done but to dividehis profits with my brother would havebeen an open admission of guilt so hedisputed the claimTom told me often that Strong privately offered him at one time 25000as a settlement of all claims againsthim but that he had indignantly refused it Another time Strong offeredhim 50000 They were alone in mybrothers room in a hotel in DenverTom answered the proposal by striking Strong in the mouth and shootingat him as he ran downstairsfitroncr escaped unhurt but mybrother was arrested and tried for attempting manslaughter At the trialTom made a statement of his wrongsbut Mr Strong brought proof that theclaimant had been in an insane asylumand testified that he had oiever beenwholly restored He even pleaded forToms release on that score and waspraised in the papers for so doing Mybrother was let off with a small fine butthe wrong rankled in his mind and forthe past 15 years he has thought ofnothing but getting even with the manwho had wronged himHe has had no regular employmentbut has lived in asort of hand-to-mouthway in several cities in the east andwest Most people thought his mindimpaired but I believe he is as sensibleas he ever was I have a small incomeind

the man whohad wronged him and it became a sortof joke at the gatherings but it was nojoke with Tom and that is why I hopedhe would not meet his old partner againNot long ago he heard somehow thatStrong was to be married to a prettyyoung lady and it infuriated him beyond description PerhapsThe woman paused and looked atHendricks suspiciously She loweredher head and began nervously to strokethe hair of the child Then she saidabruptlySomehow I trust you sir I haveheard so much of your kindness towomen that I feel down in my heart thatyou are sorry for me in spite of theduty you have

ENLARGED BARNspeaking but their value will be inestimable for with them the dairymancan keep just as many extra cows as hewishesConcerning the interior arrangementof such a barn I suggest that a feedcar with a track be arranged for thefeed Hoar and the feeding alley in frontof the cows as represented by thedotted lines in the diagram It alsomight not be out of place at all to havea double
