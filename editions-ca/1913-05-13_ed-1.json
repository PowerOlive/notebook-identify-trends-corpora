Alverson of Lawrenceburg. The color
scheme was pink and was nicely car
ried out. Brick cream and cake were
served. There were a number of
handsome costumes at both enter
tainments. The reception was of an
informal nature, all the guests being
invited at the same hour. The vari
ous rooms of the home and veranda
were untilized. The two occasions
will long be remembered by all pres
ent. Mr. J. II. Linville, who died sud
denly at his home Thursday night,
was one of the most prominent citi
zens of Millersburg, an officer of the
Christian Church, teacher of the Bible
Class, chaplin of Amity Lodge No. 40
F. & A. M., a devoted husband, a kind
loving father, and a strong personal
friend. He stood high in all walks of
society.
An effort was made Friday morning
after his death to notify the three
sons, who were in three different
states, of the death of their father.
Messrs. Homer Linville, of Columbus,
Ohio, and Malcolm Linville, of Peru,
Ind., arrived Saturday. Mr. Roscoe
Linville, who has a position in Yel
low Stone National ParK, was fortun
ate enough to be in Missouri and was
reached by telegram before leaving
for Colorado.
The funeral arrangements were
made for Saturday afternoon. How
ever, the family received, a telegram
for Mr. Roscoe Linville a few minutes
before time for the funeral procession
to leave the home, saying that he was
in Cincinnati and would reach Mil
lersburg Saturday night.
As the relatives were at the home,
and the Christian Church had already
began toll, it was decided to go on
with the funeral .services at the
church, then place the body in the
vault' at the cemetery and bury it
with the Masonic Honors Sunday af
ternoon. The services at the church were
conducted by his pastor, Elder O. C.
Cossaboom. The remarks were very
feeling, due largely to the fact that
Mr. Linville was a "member of the
official board and a teacher in the Sun
day school. The floral tributes attest
ed, the high esteem In which the de
ceased was 'held by his family friends,
church and lodge.
At the close of the services the body
was placed in the vault in the Mil
lersburg cemetery until 2.30 o'clock
Sunday afternoon, at which time it
was taken to the grave and deposited
in its last resting place with Masonic
Honors. W. A. Butler presided in an

Small Print Bad for Children.
Small print leads the young scholar
to look too closely at his bo6ks. He
is not yet familiar with the forms of
the words, and his eyesight has not
yet reached its full acuteness. For
easy vision he must have retinal im
ages larger than those which satisfy
the trained reader. To obtain these
larger images he brings thebook too
near to his eyes, or his eyes too near
the book, and this is apt to be in-
jurlous.

A camel with an average load will

Belief In Luck Harmful.
Belief in luck retards progress, dulls
the intellect, deadens the wits, de
bases the body and keeps its votaries
ever behind in the race of life. The
man who believes that his luck is
against him good luck has cast over
himself an insidious spell and soon
will feel that it is useless to knock at
the treasure-room of fame and for
tune, that a deaf ear will be turned to
him because he comes to believe that
door to be open only to its favored
children.

First Use of Stage Money.
Stage money, that is, money of. no
value off the stage, is first said to
have been used by David Garrick in
the eighteenth century. The money
is said to have been made by the
wealthy actor-manager so as to loolc
actually like real money. There was
little money, even of this counterfeit
kind, used in the days of Shakespeare,
because of the scarcity of any kind of
money, particularly among actors.
