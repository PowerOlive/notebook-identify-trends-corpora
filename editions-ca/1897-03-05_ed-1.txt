peculiar little animals abounding in Arizona The hawk ireys upon the tarantula nence his name He is built forhunting them and he does it to perfection You can see the hawks crawlingalong the ground in

deadly weapon of the enemyis implanted in his body The hawksimply deposits a poison insidethe bodyof the tarantula which paralyzes himIn connection with the poison he deposits an egg which proceeds to hatchout and a caterpillar is the result Theyoung caterpillar feeds on the body ofthe tarantula until he is ready to undertake housekeeping on his own account There are two species of tarantula hawks

Statesilliterate persons designated in thesection anddeclares that the pfovis fion presents a radical departure fromour- national policy relating toimmigration Heretofore he sayswe have welcomed all whocame to us from other landsexcept whose moral or physicalcondition or history threatenedT dangerto our national welfare and safetyRelying upon the jealous watchfulnessof our people to prevent

blessings of Americancitizenship A centurys stupendousgrowth largely due to the assimilationand thrift of millions of sturdy andpatriotic adopted citzens attest thesuccess of this generous and free-handedpolicy which while guarding thepeoples interests exacts from our immigrants only physical and moralsoundness and a willingness and ability to workA contemplation of the grand results of this policy he writes cannot fail to arouse a sentiment in its-Referring to the claims that thequality of recent immigrants is undesirable President Cleveland says thetime is quite within recent memorywhen the same thing was said oftmigrants who with their descendantsare now numbered among our bestcitizensIt is said that too many immigrantssettle in our cities thus dangerouslyincreasing their idle and vicious population This is certainly a disadvantage it can not be shown howeverthat it affects all our cities nor that itis permanent nor does it appear thatthis condition where it exists demandsas its remedy the reversal of our present immigration policyThe claim is also made that the influx of foreign laborers deprives of theopportunity to work those who are better entitled than they to the privilege ofearning their livelihood by daily toiLAn unfortunate condition is certainlypresented when any who are willingto labor are unemployed But so faras this condition now exists amongour people it must be conceded tobe a result of phenomenal business depression and the stagnation ofall enterprises in which labor is a factor With the advent of settled andwholesome financial and economicgovernmental policies and a consequent encouragement to the activity ofcapital the misfortunespf unemployedlabor should to aS1 essoin y4ileast be remedied If it continues itsnatural consequences must be to checkthe further immigration to our citiesof foreign laborers and to deplete theranks of those already there In themeantime those most willing and bestentitled ought to be able to secure theadvantages of such work as there isto doThe educationaltest contained in thebill receives close attention on thisparticular point Mr Cleveland saysin his opinion it is infinitelymore safe to admit a hundredthousand immigrants who thoughunable to read and write seekamong us only a home and opportunity to work than to admitof one of those unruly agitators andenemies of governmental control whocan not only read and write but delightsin arousing by inflammatory speech theilliterate and peacefully inclined todiscontent and tumult Violence anddisorder do not originate withilliterate laborers They are ratherthe victims of the educatedagitator The ability to readand write as required in this in andof itself affords in my opinion a misleading test of contented industry andsupplies unsatisfactory evidence of desirable citizenship or a proper appreciation of the benefits of our institutionThe prohibition against the employment of aliens upon any public worksof the United States is in line withother legislation of a like characterIt is quite a different thing howeverto declare it crime for an alien to comeregularly and habitually into theUnited States for the purpose of obtaining work from -private parties ifsuch alien returns from time to timeto a foreign country and to constituteany employment of such alien a criminal offenseWashington March 3 The specialtrain

StatesThe government should not be permuted torun behind or inorease its debt in times likethe present Suitably to provide against thispresent mandate of duty the certain and easyremedy for uiost of our financial difficultiesA deficiency is inevitable so long as the expenditures of the government exceedits receipts It can only be met byloans or an increased revenue While a largeannual surplus of revenue may invite wasteand extravagance inadequate revenue createsdistrust and undermines public and privatecredit Neither should be encouraged Between more loans and more revenue thereought to be but one opinionWe should have more revenue andthat without delay hindrance orpostponement A surplus in the treasurycreated by loans is not a permanent or safereliance It will suffice while il 1 asts but itcan not last long while the outlays of the government are greater than its receipts as hasbeen the case during the past two years Normust be forgotten however much such loansmay temporarily relieve the situationthe government is still indebted for theamount of the surplus accrued which it mustultimately pay while its ability to pay is notstrengthened but weakened by a continueddeficit Loans are imperative in great emergencies to preserve the government or itscredit but a failure to supply needed revenuein timerofpeace forthc maintenance of eitherhas nojustllicationThe best -way for the government to maintain its credit is to pay as it goes not by resorting to loans but by keeping out of debtthrough an adequate income secured by asystem of taxation external or internal orboth It is fho settled policy of the government pursued from the beginning and practiced by all parties and administrationsto raise the bulk of our revenue fromtaxes upon foreign productions enteringthe United States for sale and consumption and avoiding for the most part everyform of direct taxation except in time ofwar The country is clearly opposed to anyneedless additions to the subjects of internaltaxation and is committed by its latest popular utterance to the system of tarifl taxation There can be no misunderstandingeither about the principle upon whichthis tarifl taxation shall be leviedNothing has over been made plainerat a general election than that the controllingf principle in the raisingof revenue from dutieson imports is zealous care for American interests and American labor Tne people havedeclared that such legislation should be hadass will give ample protection andment to thelndustries and the derelopnaeaiful national life has ever arisen that hasbeen met with wisdom and courage byVnottheAmerican people with fidelity to the best interests and highest duty and to the honor ofthe American name These years ofglorious history have exalted mankind and advanced the causeof freedom throughout the world and immcasureably strengthened the precious free institutions which we enjoy The peoole love andwill sustain these institutions The great essential to our happiness and prosperity isthat we adhere to the principles on which thegovernment was established and insist upontheir faithful observance Equality of rightsmust prevail and our laws be always andeverywhere res pected and obeyed We mayhave failed in the discharge of our full duty ascitizens of the greit republic but It Is consoling and encouraging to realize that freespeecn a free press free schools the free andunmolested right of religious liberty and worship and free and fair elections are dearerand more- universally enjoyed to day thanever beforeThese guarantees must be sacredly preservedand wisely strengthened The constituted authorities must be upheld Lynchingsmust not be tolerated in a great and civilizedcountry like the United States courts notmobs must execute the penalties of the lawThe presefvatien of public order the right ofdiscussion the integrity of courts and the orderly administration of justice must continueforever the rock of safety upon which ourgovernment securely restsOne of the lessons taught by the late election which all can rejoice in is thit the citizens of the United States are both lawrespecting and law abiding people not easilyswerved from the path vof patriotism andhonor This is in entire accord with thegenius of our institutions and but emphasizesthe advantages of inculcating even a greaterlove for law and order in the future Immunity should be granted to none who violatethe laws whether individuals corporationsor communities and as the constitutionimposes upon the president the duty ofboth its own execution and of the statutesenacted in pursuance of its provisions Ishall endeavor carefully to carry them intoeffect The declaration of the party now restored to power has been in the past of opposition to all combinations of capital organized in trusts or otherwise to control arbitrarily the condition of trade among our citizensand it has supported such legislation aswill prevent the execution of all schemesto oppress the people by undue charges ontheir supplies or by unjust rates transportation of their products to market This purpose will be steadily pursued both by tlpenforcement of the laws

asperationsof a great peopleIt has been the policy of the United Statessince the foundation of the govennment tocultivate relations or peace and amity withall the nations of the wqrld and this accordswith my conception of our duty now Wehave cherished the policy of non interferencewith the affairs of foreign governments wisely inaugurated by Washington keeping ourselves free from entanglement either as alliesor foes content to leave undisturbed withthem the settlement of their own domesticconcerns If will be our aim to pursue a firmand dignified foreign policy which shall bejust impartial ever watchful of our nationalhonor and always insisting upon the enforcement of the lawful rights of Americans everywhere We want no wars of conquest wemust avoid the temptation of territorialaggression A war should never beentered upon until every agency ofpeace has failed peace is preferableto war in almost every contingency Arbitration is the true method of settlement of internati onal as well as local or Individual differences Jt was recognized as the best meansof adjustment of differences between employers and employes by the Forty ninthcongress in 188G and its application was extended to our diplomatic relations by the unanimous concurrence of the senate and house of the Fiftyfirst congress in 1890 The latter resolutionwas accepted as the basis of negotiation withus by the British house of commons in 1893and upon our invitation a treaty of arbitrationbetween the United States and Great Britainwas signed at Washington and transmitted to the senate for its ratification inJanuary last Since this treaty is clearly theresult of our own initiative since it has beenrecognized as the leading feature of our foreign policy throughout our entire nationalhistory the adjustment of difficulties by judicial rather than by force of arms and sinceit presents to the world the glorious exampleof reason and peace not passion and warcontrolling the relations between twoof the greatest nations- of the worldan example certain to be followed brothers I respectfully urge the early action ofthe senate thereon not merely as a matter ofpolicy but as a duty to mankind The importance and moral influence of the ratification of such a treaty can hardly be over-estimatedIn the cause of advancing civilizationIt may well engage the best thought forstatesmen and people of every country and Ican not but consider it fortunate that it wasreserved to the United States to have theleadership in so grand aworkIt has been the uniform practice to avoidas far as possible the conveningof the congress in extraordinarysession It is an ex imple which under ordinary circumstances and in the absence of apublic necessity is to be commended But afailure to convene the representatives of thepeople in congress in extra session when itinvolves neglect of a public duty places theresponsibility upon the executive himselfThe conditi on or the public treasury as hasbeen indicated demands the immediate consideration of congress It alone hasthe power to provide revenues forthe congress not to convene It under suchcircumstances I can view in no other sensethan the neglect of a plain duty I do notsympathize whh the sentiment that congressin session is dangerous to our great businessinterests Its members are the agents of thepeople and their presence at the seat ofgovernment at the execution ofthe sovereign will should not operateas an injury but as a benefit Therecould be no better time to put the governmentupon a sound financial and economic basisthan now The people have only recentlyvoted that this should be nothing is morebinding upon the agents of their will than theobligation of immediate action It has always seemed to me that the postponement of ths meeting of congress until morethan a year after it has been chosen deprived congress too often of the inspiration of the popular will and the country ofthe corresponding

covered anentire cheese making season of -sixmonths from May to October It isshown that in general the cheese yieldis somewhat greater for a pound of fatin poor milk than in rich milk For example comparing Itwo milks containing respectively three and fourper centof fat fhVfrmer makes 285 pounds ofcheese for each pound of milkfaVwhilethe -latter makes 02fr pound less -or 260pounds of cheese for one poundof fatIt is shown thatthis difference in favorof cheese yield for fat in poor milk isonly an apparent one because this difference of 025 pound is made -up ofcafeein and water which is really not asvaluable as separator cheesepnd which has a market value not toexceed two cents per pound The constituents in 100 pounds of cheese madefrom thcricher milk are worthmore inthe -market than are the constituentsfrom 100 pounds of cheese made frompoorer milk Milk rich in fat can bemade to yield cheese of the same composition as milk poorer in fat in one oftwo ways 1 by adding skimmilkto or 2 removing fat from the rich-er milk then the cheese yield for apound of fat becomes the same Thedifference in the cheese yield of milkfat in the case of poor milk over richermilk is a skimmilk difference and theextra yield of cheese for fat is the poorest kind of skimmilk cheese It isshown that paying for milk accordingto weight of -milk furnished is exceedingly unfair to the producer of richermilk It is shown that the cheese yieldby itself does not constititute a fairbasis for payment because it gives poormilk an undue advantage A criticalcomparison of all methods of paying formilk suggested or in use leads mostemphaticaly to the conclusion that milkfat nffords the fairest practical basis touse in paying for milk for cheese making In conclusion it is pointed outthat where the milk fat basis is usedthere is no tendency to adulterate anddefraud while there is every encouragement to produce milk of betterqualityCISTERN AND TANKA W nterinjc Arrangement That HasWorked Well for

Parmer Tellsf His Experience with ItLast spring I bought five cents worthof chicory seed and planted it in mygarden This fall I dug four bushels ofTehicory roots As I had never senany of the stuff before I did not knowtry an experiment I washed the rootscarefully slicing them into thm stripstook them to a heading mill and putthem into a bQx used for drying heading timber In three days they were asdry as powder t ran them througha little hand bone mill which tookme about 15 minutes and found 1 hadover a bushel of chicory meal Thismeal my wife roasts or browns in thestove the same as -green coffee butit takes -a much shorter timeIt is not a complete substitute forcoffee but if used with it cannot be detected from the pure article We usetwo thirds chicory and visitors declarethey cannot tell it from pure cofteeI think it should be largely used ascoffee is not healthful if medicaJauthority is to be believed but -chicorynever was known to have any bad effect unless used in -excessive quantitywhen it sometimes results in dysenteryAgain coffee is expensive while chicorycosts but very little What I -raisedfrom five cents worth of seed will lasta large family five years Let some ofour wide awake farmers in each community try it and it will not be longuntil a large coffee bill will -be cut offfrom almost every family The onlytrouble will be the drying of th2roots which must be done
