Sr?i? a. m., with the field day exer

5 the threatening weather a large
eeowtf was present, and the oecd
soc was a rather sad one. as it is
3Brfl5ably the last exercises of the
fctatf held on these grounds. It was
iiiss -one topic of conversation dur
S5 the entire time. People talked
skk Thought more about that than
c&ev- did the exercises they were
-aoraessing.
The cadets had been . well-trained
atsd it vas Lard for the judges to
srexder a decision. The medal in the
3HX2saai-at-" rms was won . by Cadet

yrm the honors of being the best
&27Ied company. As it was the
3&5S field day exercises there was no
iresentationxOf flag to the winning
Km2pany as has alwcvs been the
ervstom, nor the announcement of
vs&icers for the coming ear. With
&a announcement of the judges the
i&xnr.ses closed, and nearly every
9e left the grounds with heavy
Ifeszcrs. At 2:30 p. m., the second
"fcxs? ball team of Transylvania and
3. IT. L crossed bats on the M. M. I.
gKHids. Another large audience

uZted in a score of 3 to0 in favor
ml 51. M. I. From 8 to 12 p. m. the
aoiete gave a dance in the Drill
Hall. A large number of out-of-town
visitors were present. The
occasion was one that will always
be remembered by all present, as it
was -supposed to mark the close of
M. M. I. dances.
Friday at 10:30 a. m. a large au
dience assembled at M. M. I. Audi
torium to witness the last M. M. I.
commencement exercises. The
weather was in harmony with the
ff-elings of the Millersbnrg public.
At the appointed time the class of

with Col. Best and Dr. Benj. F.
Bush, who was to deliver the ad
dress of the morning. After a short
musical prelude Col. Best introduc
ed Dr. Bush, pastor of the Firs't
Presbyterian Church, of Lexington,
to the audience. Dr. Bush is a forc
ible speaker and in his winning in
troduction soon caught the audience
and held it to the end. He dealt
largely with heroism and patriot
ism of the agev He talked forcibly
on the necessity of education, the,
danger of the times, which was
largely due to an imperfect educa
tion. His address was not long
and was indeed a treat to all who
heard it. After a vocal solo by ex
Cadet Clay Sutheland, of Paris, Col.
Best in a short and appropiiate ad
dress, awarded the diplomas and
read the Honor Roll. The medal
for the gieatest proficiency during
the entire year, was presented by
Dr. Bush in a short address. After
more music came the announce
ments. Col. Best at this time mad? the
best and most appropriate talk that
the people of Millersburg have ever
heard him make. He began by say
ing tnat two hours ago he thought
he had a definite program to offer
them, since then he had been vis
ited by many of the influential
citizens and capitalists of this vi
cinitj, and in short, had decided to
make an effort to regain M. M. I.
He would meet the County Board
of Education at 2:00 p. m. in his
office, at which time he would make
them an offer. Col.- Best announced
a mass meeting to be held ot 2:30
p. m. on same afternoon; and M.
M. I. closed whether to open again
Are did not know.
At 2.30 p. m. Friday a mass meet
ing was held at M. M. I Auditorium.

thusiastic one. It was called for
