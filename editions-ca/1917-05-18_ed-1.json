I O. O. F which closed its sessions
z.z. Frankfort, Wednesday, decided to
cfb its bit in the entertainment of the
Sovereign Grand Lodge of Odd Fel
Jows, which convenes in Louisville in
.September, and will give the represen
tatives a trip to Mammoth Cave.
The Encampment voted not to
change the meeting time to October,
and chose. Maysville as the meeting
place for the session of May, 1G, 1918.
The officers elected at the session
Wednesday were as follows: James
Ghilds, Maysville, Grand Patriarch;
"Perry J. McCord, Paris, Grand High
Priest; George Goebbke, Newport.
Grand Senior Warden; Richard G. Elli
ott, Lexington, Grand Scribe; B. J.
Durham, Danville, Grand Treasurer;
Grand Rpoeresentatives, M. M. Logan,

right-of-way in the raising, wherever
practicable, of foodstuffs.
The Traction Company has made
the announcement that it will use all
the available space along its right-of-way
on all lines within its territory
for the planting of potatoes. This
will mean that the food stuff produc
ing capacity of the counties through
which these lines pass will be vastly
increased by utilizing this ground
wherever it is possible to do so.
The Company has already begun
plowing along its line between Lexing
ton and Frankfort, and the activities
will be extended to the other lines in
Central Kentucky as fast as possible.
The co-operation of people living along
the lines of the interurban service will
be of some help in this endeavor, and
it is to be hoped that they will use
every jneans in their power to further
the objects the Traction Company has
in view.
It is not known just when the work
will begin in this section, but it is like
ly to be soon. The persistent agita'
ton of the necessity of raising more
foodstuffs has brought the matter
close to home at last. There is
plenty of spare ground along the lines
of the Traction Company in this
countj', as well as along the lines of
the Louisville & Nashville that could
be devoted to this purpose.
The penalty for failing to comply
with this law, is a fine in any sum not
to exceed $5,000, or to be confined iu
the county jail not to exceed six
months, or both.

pointed as agent in Bourbon county

The National Association for the
Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis,
in session last week in Cincinnati, went
on record of condemnation of all alleg
ed consumptive cures as possibly harm"
ful and often (productive of serious re
sults. The advice is to take no medi
cine, but that prescribed by a reputa
ble physician, observe the utmost
cleanliness and sanitary requirements,
breathe plenty of fresh air, eat well
cooked, noursihing food, avoid all dis
sipation and use of alcoholic liquors,
maintain cheerfulness and rest. This
will be found to work wonders for im
provement and often permanent cure.
The Tuberculosis Commission with
headquarters at Frankfort, is prose
cuting a vigorous campaign for the
prevention andcure of tuberculosis,
and Dr. W. L. Heizer, Executive Sec
raUry, .will vgladly fmrnish any Jnfor
matlori when requested. -
