At dinnerhe pigged at a table by himself him andtwo other Hindoos the captain kindDf jeered at him about it and he gotvery excited He turned round andtalked into my ear He would not buythe birds he Avould have his diamondlie demanded his rights as a British subject nisdiajnond must be found Hewas firm upon that He would appealto the house of lords The man incharge of the birds was one of thosewooden headed chaps you cant get anew idea into anyway lie red used anyproposal to interfere with the birdsby way of medicine His instructionswere to feed them so-and-so and treatthem so-and-so and it was as muchis his place was worth not to feed themso-and-so and treat them so-and-soPadishah had wanted a stomach pumpthough you cant do that to a birdyou know This Padishah was full ofiad law like most of those blessed Bengalis and talked of having a lien on thejirds and so forth But an old boyvho said his son was a London barristerirgued that what a bird swallowed became ipso facto part of the bird andthat Padishahs only remedy lay intn action for damages and even thent might be possible to show contributory negligence lie hadnt any rightaf way about an ostrich that didntbelong to

abird But one of them lie said hmeant to keep for luckYou must understand this diamondwas a valuable one a little Jew chapa diamond merchant who was with ushad put it at three or four thousandwhen Padishah had shown it to himand this idea of an ostrich gamblecaught on Xow it happened that Idbeen having a few talks on generalsubjects with the man who looked af teithese ostriches and quite incidentallyhed said one of the birds was ailingand he fancied it had indigestion 11had one feather in its tail almost allwhite by which I knew it and so whennext day the auction started with itI capped Padishahs S5 by 90 I fancywas a bit too sure and eager with mybid and some of the others spotted thefact that I was in the know And Part ish ah went for that particul ar bird 1 ikean irresponsible lunatic At last theJew diamond merchant got it foi175 and Padishah said 180 justafter the hammer came down so Potter declared At any rate the Jew merchant secured it and there and thenhe got a guni and shot it Potter madea hades of a fuss because he said itwould injure the sale of the other threeand Padishah of course behaved likean idiot but all of us were very muchexcited I can tell you I was preciousglad when that dissection was overand no diamond had turned up precious glad Id gone to one forty on thatXarlicular bird myselfThe little Jew was like most Jewshe didnt make any great fuss over badluckbut Potter declined to go on withthe auction until it was understoodthat the goods could not be delivereduntil the sale was over The little Jewwanted to argue that the case was exceptional and as the discussion ranpretty even the thing was postponeduntil the next morning We had a lively dinner table that evening I can tellyou but in the end Potter got his waysince it would stand to reason he wouldbe safer if he stuck to all the birds andthat we owed him some considerationfor his sportsman like behavior Andthe old gentleman whose son was a lawyer said hed been thinking the thingover and that it was very doubtful ifwhen a bird had been opened and thediamond recovered it ought not to behanded back to the proper owner Iremember I suggested it came under thelaws of the treasure trove which wasreally the truth of the matter Therewas a hot argument and we settled itwas certainly foolish to kill the bird onboard the ship Then the old gentleman going at large through his legaltalk tried to make out the sale was alottery and illegal and appealed to thebirds as ostriches He didnt want tasell any diamonds he said and didntoffer that as an inducement The threebirds he put up to the best of hisknowledge and belief did not containa diamond It was in the one he kepto he hopedPrices ruled high next day all thesame The fact that now there werefour chances instead of five of coursecaused a rise The blessed birdsaveraged two hundred and twentyseven and oddly enough this Padishadidnt secure one of em not one Hemade too much shindy and when heought to have been hiding he was talking about liens and besides Potter wasa bit down on him One fell to a quietlittle officer chap another to the litthJew and the third was syndicated bythe engineers And then Potter seemedsuddenly sorry for having sold themand said hed flung away a clear 1000and that very likely hed draw a blankand that he always had been a fool butwhen I went and had a bit of a talk tohim with

many a quiet glenAnd there by many a shaded wayAre homes of quiet menAnd there are many eyes alwayThat turn with longing night and dayBack to the town of HayWithin that good old town of HayThere was no pride of birthAnd no man there pursued his wayA stranger in the earthAnd none were high and none were lowOf golden hair or grayAnd each would grieve at others woeDown in the town of HayAim many a tired soul to dayMid crowded thousands far awayfVeeps for the town of HayA road leads from the town of HayForth to a world of dinAnd winds and wanders far awayAnd many walked thereinFor in the crowds of toil and stressTheir restless footsteps strayTheir souls bave lost the quietnessOf that old town of HayBut in some respite of the frayIn transient dreams they float awayBack to the town of HayOld men are in that town of HayAmid its quiet treesWho dream of strong sons far awayUpon the stormy seasOld mothers when the twilight dewThe woodbine leaves have pearledDream of their boys who wander throughThe wideness of the worldAnd tears fall in the twilight grayAnd prayers go up at close of dayIn that old town of HayA hillside in the town of HayIs slanting toward the sunAnd gathered neath its headstones grayAre sleepers one by oneAnd there are tears in distant landsAnd grief too deep for tearsAnd farewells waved from phantom handsAcross the gulf of yearsAnd when they place that headstonegrayIt crushes hearts so far awayFrom that oldxtown of Hay 4Sam Walter Foss in N T SunA DUST BLIZZARDBY PHILIP V MIGHELSCopyright 1S97As white as marble and as flat rs thetop of a table the great Hound rockdesert stretched away from the edg eof the thick growing sagebrush of Barren valley to the grayish mountainseast and north It was soft as carpetand as dreadful as poison for thewhite was that of alkali and it rosein a dust at the fall of a foot Tenmiles in width and 40 in length thiswretched spot lay naked of even theslightest sign of vegetationA road that curved its narrow waythrough the sagebrush skirted the desert on the west By the side of thisstood a cabin back of which werefenced in closures traversed bv angating dilch that wound its wav out ofa distant mountain ravine At thefront of the cabin stood a wateringtrough but both this and the irrigatingditch were dry and dusty A singularplace for a cabin and a ranch but Mature contrives peculiar conditions inNevada one of which is the close association of deep rich soil with desolatealkaline wastesAs the evening of a certain day inearly winter descended a man cameslowly down the held to the cabinThrowing aside his hal he slowly prepared a meal set the clumsy table fortwo and waited From time to timehe went to the window and searchedthe dimming foothills with anxiouseyesThe darkness came down the hourswent by the dinner grew cold Whennine oclock had come he went withoutto raise a long far reaching call AwayDff sounded an answering whoop Fifteen minutes later appeared a brightfaced lioy built in the mold of an Indian as spry of foot as a panther andas stout as a sapling oak The lightas it fell on his face whn the man hadDpened the door revealed a marked resemblance between tli two as indeedthere should have been for the pairwere brothersWell Leo lad said the elder Ibegan to think you were out for thenight in the Big Flat timberTo tell the truth I nearly was theboy replied as he drew his chair to thetable 1 didnt know how late it wasind the darkness caught me just as 1left the summitHowd you find your way YouL ouldnt go bv the stars on such a nightas thisNo thats why I came so near tobeing lost for of course I couldnt seeanything when once T got in the treosRut there is always a wind comes upthrough the Dead Bear gorge that onecan smell rather a cold sort of a smellYou didnt walk along the edge of theorge exclaimd his brotherOh no Im not so foolish I just gotmy bearings every time I smelt thatcolder air and further down I couldmell the tamaracks- theres only onemnch of them in the wind from thewest Then I struck the creek and nextur ditch and then I was all rightSmelled your way home hey 1guess youll do remarked the man regarding him with affectionate eyesThen after a silence Well whats thenewsBad Frank said Leo The lawyersays its almost hopeless to fight againsth nian so powerful lie says the company has got an injunction against

of green by the side of thisdesert and our ditch as dry as a boneat the end of the first season ItsmaddeningWithout the water Leo repliedthe place isnt fit to live in The lawyer said wed picked out a piece ofground about as desperate as any onearthSo we have rejoined the brotherWe were never cowards And thewater would have made a ranch of itto be proud of and a station for thetraveling teams that would bring uslots of money just as sure as the desertis flat But lad the jig is upWell were not the fellows whocant strike out again anyway saidLeo consolinglyBight you are shake said Frankand the brothers joined hands A weekhad passefl From a sky that was wildwith scurrying clouds blew a piercinggale that utterly transformed the valley for the gusts swirled down on thedesert and raised a dense and awfuldust as thick as a fog or a blindingsnowstorm and nearly as choking asthe fumes of sulphur Huge masses ofthe floating alkali sv ept over plain andmountain enveloping- all in a shroudthat smarted in the eyes of manparched the throat and defied the sightAs this blizzard of dust was at itsheight a man came madly driving upthe road in a buggy behind which asaddle horse was being led by the bridle Leo and Frank came forth as hestopped before the doorGentlemen gentlemen wildly criedthe man in eident distress I imploreyour aid I beg of you to help a wretched parent my son is lost on the deserthe is ill out of his mind He escapedus at our lunch only for a momentbut that was enough lie is gone wehave searched and called but the dusthas made us blind and nearly dumbit is awful is

sake of a father I beg ofyouWho is with you Frank abruptlyinquiredMy foreman hastily answered theman rubbing his dust reddened eyesHe told me that some one was living inthis horrible place my name is

got to help himsssfcS M fMnLithrough the drifting stilling dust andwas goneNo sooner had he struck the dreadededge of the desert than a gruesoniethought arose in his mind The hungrycojates woukl be sure to find the boywho was lostNow began a terriblp search wellnigh hopeless Getting his bearings bythe direction of the wind Leo firstpushed forward and then to right andleft across the gale listening ever fora sound to give him guidance Hiseyes were closed it would only havemade him suffer to hold them open andhis knowledge of where the wind wascoming from was a safer compassAn hour two hours he wandered toand fro His mouth began to dry hislips to crackle his hair and ears werefilled with the poisonous powder hisclothes were white and heavy with itAt last on the wings of the hurricanehis signal came a blood curdling combination of howling and diabolicallaughter prolonged and weird theoryof the coyote Then came the answerof another followed by a dismal duetthat sounded like the chorus of a dozenWith his hair bristling Leo strode onThe shifting of the wind for a time deceived him but suddenly through arift in the clouds of dust he caughtsight of the creatures There werefour or more gaunt bony hairlessforms with slraight up ears and grinning faces for the Jkali kills theirhair and leaves their parched uncleanlyhides painfully bare and tightlystretched over skeletons ir eagerlyclothed with JieshThey were circling about a prostrateheap on the ground As Leo leaped intheir midst he struck one on the sideof the head with his fist so desperate ablow that it lay stunned Catching itup by the hind legs before it had timeto recover he swung it like a giantclub to beat back the others Hungryand savage but essentially cowardlythey stood their ground only for a moment Leo was master of the fieldBut the worst was to come The lostboy fallen on his face exhausted wasquite unconscious His eyes ran withtears from the biting dust his mouthvas open and was dry and hard Leocaught the frail form in his arms andheaded about in the teeth of the galeHe had scarcely gone 100 yards whena whirlwind swirled about them andleft the stout young fellow dazed anduncertain He thought the wind hadshifted if it had God help themThe fury of the storm had certainlyincreased it drove the choking alkalilike a blast of sand Laden as it wasLeo found it impossible to breathethrough his nose alone hence his mouthwas soon in a terrible state He fearedhe should perish in that awful atmosphere To add to the terror of it ailhis feet now and then broke throughthe dampened crust and he flounderedheavilyFinally darkness began to descendIn this extremity he thought in his- ff rHE SWUNG IT LIKE A GIANT CLUBYes and at the risk of life Frankreplied They looked each in the faceof the other and were glad to find eachother right and human when their enemy came to the door of their cabin foraidIt wouldnt do for both to go Leorejoined in a hurried whisper and Iknow the desert best Good by oldman if we dont happen to to see eachother againOh little Leo lad said Frank asif his brother had been a child againand their hands came together for afervent silent claspLeo stepped swiftly to the buggy unfastened the horse and vaulted astridethe saddle Youd better stay lereMr Hardicut said he or you canwait in the rig at the Sulphur SpringDont go back to the pass again thewind is going to be worse no time tobe lost Then he Avheeled his horseGood by Frank he called andFranks teply went out on the wind likea wailA mad and headlong ride was Leosalong the road by the edge of thedesert Fast the long cape like neck ofland that reached far out into thealkali where bubbled the cold springwhite with sulphur and ill to smellpast everything mile after mile till hereached the pass that was named fromthe trio of pines that made a landmarkthere On the way he evolved a thousand schemes for finding the wanderingboy but all were rejected as uselessWhen at last he halted where the runaway had escaped iiis ideas still werevague and uncertainFinding the pale and nervous foreman he quickly explained that thehorse had better be taken back at onceI shouldnt dare to try to return to thepass he said for fear of wanderingby it and starting down the wholedreary length of the desertBut vhy dont you ride the-horse said the chattering manne would sink to his knees the crustof alkali will bear a

histhroat and his nostrils as best he coii Idturned face to the wind elevated hishead and deliberately sniffed at the flying dust There was no result hisheart sank Then the wind slowlyveered a trifle to the south and hehoarsely shouted for joyThe powerful odor of the sulphurspring was borne on the breeze theywere saved One more hour of mightystruggling and he had reached thecape like projection of fertile land andhad wet their mouth and faces withthe pungent but wholesome water AndHardicut himself who had raced histeam from the cabin to the spring andback again a dozen times came tearing through the brush like a maniacto take them home The fearful ordealwas over at lastThe next morning the sick boy whowas singularly improved though stilla little delirious was carefully muffledand placed again in the buggy to behurried awayThere is no reward too great for yonto ask and receive said the father toLeo as he left the cabin If there isanything in the worldI thank you kindly said the dignified young fellow but the Borrowsboy would rather not accept a rewardfor a xlain dutyThe Borrows boys gasped theman as he drove away from the cabinwhere the sturdy brothers were standingTwo days

under such conditions as will bring a quick germination of the seed and a thrifty start togrow Plants like animals are easilystunted when young and no after treatment will wholly overcome the effectsof stuntingWhile it is best to plant reasonablyearly it is of no advantage to x5antwhen the soil is wet or cold or beforeit has been carefully prepared Betterdelay the planting rather than to plantunder unfavorable conditions Cornis i crop that should germinate in ashort time after the seed is plantedand the plants should make a steadygrowth to maturityPlow deep and thorough If theground has been plowed during thefall or winter go over it with a diskor spading harrow It is an item tohave the soil mellow and fine and stirredreasonably deepTaking one year with another deepplowing or stirring of the soil beforeplanting should be the rule with shallow thorough cultivation afterwardsIt is only occasionally that it will beLost to plow or cultivate deep after theplants are up Generally thorough stirring of the soil keeping down the weedsnd the soil fine and mellow will givebetter results than to plow or cultivate deepRather more and better corn can begrown by planting in drills than inhills but it is nearly always done atan increased cost In nearly all casesit will cost more to give clean cultivation with drill planting than with hillBut where the land is free from weedsso that the cost of cultivating is notincreased too much drill planting willgive the best growth and yieldBut in an average soil it is usuallymore economical to plant in hills farenough apart each -way so that cultivation can be given both ways One advantage in using only good seed andplanting under the most favorable conditions is that just the number of plantswanted in each hill that many kernelsof corn can be droppedWhile it is better to thin out thanto replant both of these may usuallybs avoided by using good seed and taking care in planting When the soilis warm and dry deep covering will bebest If the soil is rather wet or coldit will be best to cover shallow Thefertility of the soil must determine thenumber of stalks in each hill It is better to have one or two strong

themout You know an ounce of preventive is worth a pound of cureMy remedy is to grease the backs ofthe cattle with any kind of soft greasebetween the middle of June and themiddle of August using it upon themtwice a month between those periodsIt might be well to mix some oil of2cdar or oil of pine with the grease Ihave not used either of the oils but intend to this coming season as I havebeen informed that cattle in the cedarand pine regions are never botheredwith warbles Using the grease uponthem keeps the flies from depositingtheir eggs or nits as flies will not lightin grease if they can help it I donot know the exact time that the fliescommence their depredations on thecattle it may be a little later thanJuneLast season I only greased the backsof two of my cattle that was in Julythat I expected to beef so as to get aent more on the pound for the hideswhich I did as there was not a warblein them The other six head were fillof warbles when I butchered whichwas in the middle of January Thatproves that the grease did the work1 expect to grease all of them next season If this remedy proves successfulit will be a great saving- of feed for thecattle also a saving of money in hidesand above all a great relief to the cattle Newell C Whitelock in OhioFarmerTRAP FOR SMALL GAMEIt Is Just i Good as the Most Expensive ContrivuneestThis trap aan be made by any farmers bo3 a it a

buildtheir own foundation is merely wastingthe time of the bees Sometimes itseems like spending a great deal ofmoney that might be saved to buyfoundation but it is really economicalto do so Honey comb is made ofpractically pure wax and this is infact the fat of the bees It is un ler thyscales of the abdomen and may be seenthere if the bee is put under a glass ofvery ordinary magnifying power Thiswax is pulled from its place by the clawsof the bees and worked into comb andthis operation takes time that is lostwhen the colony might be storing nectaif the foundation has been furnishedISo man has been able to make foundation that is as soft and pliable as thecomb the bees make but a pretty fairimitation is made that answers all practical purposesWhen honey comb is first made it isas every one knows sweet and perfectlypalatable but as soon as brood begins tobe grown in it each embryo weaves athin cocoon that is never removed andthe cell becomes smaller and the combdarker with each succeeding broodhatched in it This makes the beenarrow smaller and smaller and suchcomb should be cut out and melted downfor sale before it gets too dark to finda place to keep themWhere sections are used the comb isof course removed often and sold andhere is where the most profitable me offoundation comes in Journal of AgricultureWITH THE BUSY BEESA worker grub can be transformed into a queen
