Change of Venue.
Montgomery county citizens will;
witness a spectacle seldom seen in
the Bkegrass region at the term of
Circuit Court, which began there
yesterday, in that a white woman Iwill
be placed on trial for wilful murder.
The case in qi e tion is that of Anse
and Drucilla Wnite, husband and wife,
charged with the murder of Jase
Deaton in Breathitt county several
months ago. The case was transfer
red irom Breathitt to Montgomery
county by Special Judge W. C. Hal
bert, and is set for trial next Monday.
White and his wife are now out on
bond awaiting trial.
At the time the case was called at
Jackson the Jexcitement was intense
and both sides feared they could not
get a fair trial, and while White was
in jail a special guard was ordered
around the jail to protect him. Feel
ing in the case at Jackson seems very
high.
It will be remembered Deaton was
tried in the Bourbon. Circuit Court for
the murder of John Abner in Breath
itt, and with the two Davidsons and
Hacker Combs was acquitted. Judge
Halberqt, of Lewis county, befjre
wbum Deaton was tried, will sit at the
trial cf his alleged slayers.

Base Ball Up to Now.
The game wa3 called, with; Molasses
at the stick. SmallAPox was catching.
Coal was in the box and had lots of
steam. Horn was playing first base,
and Fcddle second base. Corn was in
the field and Apple was-umpire. When
Axr came to the bat, he chopped, and
Coal let Brick walk and Sawdust filled
the bases. Song made a hit and
Twenty made a score. Every foot of
Ground kicked and said Apple was
rotten- Balloon started to pi-tch but
went op in the air, then Cherry tried
it but &e was a wild one.. When Spider
caught a fly -the crowd cheered. Old.
Ice kept cooling the game until Coal
burnt him with a pitched ball, tnen
you ought to have heard Ice GTrearo.
Cabbage had a good head and kept
quiet. Grass covered lots ofground on
the field- Organ refused to play and
Bread loafed around and put him out.
In the fifth inning Wind began to blow
about what he could do and Hammer
began to knock, then the Trees began
to leave. Knife was put out for cut
ting first base. There was- lots of bet
ting: on the game and Eggs went
broke but Soap cleaned up.. They all
kicked when in the heat of the game
Coal was put out, but not' until he had
roasted Pork good and hard for his
pigheaderiness. Balloon went in the
air again when Pigs began to root.
The score was 1 to 0 when Apple told
Fiddle Ito take the base. Oats was
shocked, not having a grain- of sense.
Song made another hit and Trombone
tried to slide but was put out. Meat
wasr-playing for a big stake act was
put out at the plate after being roast
ed by the upmirp. Door said that if
he had pitched the game be would
have shut them all out.
Stock Show Second to None.
The stock show at Bourbon Fair is
second to none in the- State. New
premiums added this year and many
increased in value. (2)
