and stood beside me thereThe girl I had long desiredI knew that this was another lifeAnd it seemed more old than strangeFor she said like a real and living wifeSay Harry I want some changeShe told me the baby had a rashAnd the cook was drunk all dayShe spoke of her usual need of cashAnd the bills she had to payShe said that Tommy had hurt his kneeAna Bessie had had a fallAnd I might stop to morrow and seeIf the doctor could not callShe owned that Johnny had grown toolargeFor her to correct any moreAnd would I kindly take him in chargeAnd investigate why he sworeShe said there were holes in the kitchensinkAnd the skylight leaked againAnd Bowers the plumber didnt thinkThe boiler would stand much strainShe asked me what was the price of wheatAnd hinted I should have knownEnough to keep away from the StreetAnd let such things aloneIn her calm persistent way she spokeAgain of the butchers billAnd then with a lucky start I wokeA lonely bachelor stillThe PuritanI Copyright 189s by D Appleton
