steamer made a quick passage toHong Kong where the Hong Kong andShanghai banking corporation readilyundertook to handle all the silverboth in coin and ingots giving MrStevens drafts on London to theamount of 450000 The two gentlemen with their wives Mr McPhersonand Don Silvestre Palacios then madea most delightful voyage by way ofSingapore and Suez to England wherethey were successful in disposing ofthe gold at an average price of threepounds six shillings to the doubloonrealizing upwards of 300000 moreAfter giving McPherson 40000and paying Ramirez Co in full forthe Countess Mr Stevens and CaptHalstead finally netted in round numbers 1600000 each They then wentinto partnership as steamship ownersbuilding four triple expansion steamers and refitting the Countess of Devonwith

have a great dislike to Spanish lt mesand every other Spanish thingIn territorial days when he had butrecently been appointed to organizethat circuit he had to listen to a casewhich involved the ownership of nearlya quarter of the territory all the landalong the Arkansas valley from thedivide almost to the eastern boundaryline Day alter day he had to listen toa recital of the positions of the variousfloating and fixed grants included inthe litigated domain It had none ofthe simplicity of the checkerboard system of the United States land officev here Twp B j Denver mend eshblishes a definite and fixed spot ns towhich there can be no arguing Insteadof this the grant line began at SantaMaria and then trailed off to San Juanthen it cut off to San ago and before it was finished it had managed toinclude a fair share of the saints of thecalendar and more than a trifle of eddsand ends of theology As saint succeeded saint in the presentation of thecase Judge Ilallttt grew more andmore irritable till it was impossibleto leave out a single saint for broadacres and many dollars were depending on just this proof of ownershipWhen it was felt that the judge hadreached th snapping point of neivoustension a lucky swing of the boundaryline carried it for a few miles clear bothOf saints and Spanish on this stretchit was established by the banks andchannels of the Picket Wire river Asscon as Judge Ilallett caught the namehe brightened up and seemed to takea new and livelier interest in the caseGentlemen he said it is a reliefto come to a name like this among allthis Spanish

rope is mislaid he pickets his horsewith a bit of wire as the next best thingthe circumstance fixes the place in hismind That is the way American energy names the country every namehas some such little history each hasa landmark to be respectedAfter this burst of enthusiasm thebench appeared puzzled As the delimitation of the boundary continued thejudge was seen to be engaged in semesort of a struggle with the maps Atlast he interrupted the counsel andsaid that he was forced to ask him topoint out the Picket Wire river whichv as not laid down on the map suppliedthe courtCounsel made haste to explain thatthe name of the river was not pronounced as it was spelled and that hehad employed the common pronunciationSo much the better said Judge Ilallett testily How it may be with thisSpanish
