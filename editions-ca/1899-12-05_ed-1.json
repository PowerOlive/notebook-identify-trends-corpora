will do for every woman what it did for the
Minnesota mother who writes the above let
ter Not to use it during pregnancy is a
mistake to be paid for in pain and suffering
Mothers Friend equips the patient with a
strong body and clear intellect which in
tern are imparted to the child It relaxes
the muscles and allows them to expand It
relieves morning sickness and nervousness
It r ts all the organs concerned in perfect
condition for the final hour so that the actual
labor is short and practically painless Dan
ger of rising or hard breasts is altogether
avoided and recovery is merely a matter of
a few days

Those who have Rheumatism find

I Zt three JWDuucanJr and Juo W JES fjVon of l
that there is only one
cure fur that painful dis
ease He say I was a
great sufferer from mus
cular Rheumatism for
two years I could get
no permanent relief
from any medicine pre
scribed by my physician
I took about a dozen bot
tles of your S S S and
now I am as well as I
ever was inmy life lam
lure that your medicine
cured me and I would
recommend it to anv one
If s up in iks k t i
worse all
this is that
the remedies prescribed by the doctors
eon tain mercury and potash which
timately intensify the disease by
ing the joints to swell and stiffen I
Sroducing a severe aching of the bones j
S 8 has been curing Rheumatism
for twenty years even the worst cases
which seemed almost incurable
Capt O E Hughes the popular railroad
conductor of Columbia S C had an expert- I
ence with Rheumatism which convinced him
suffering from any blood disease
Everybody knows that Rheumatism
is a diseased state of the blood and
only a blood remedy is the only proper
treatment but a remedy containing
potash and mercury only aggravates
the trouble
SSSMlood
being Purely Vegetable goes direct to
the very cause of the disease and a per
manent cure always results It is the
only blood remedy guaranteed to con
tain no potash mercury or other dan
gerous minerals

That grievous wrongs have beer

to exist without effort at correction

comments of eminent statesmen an

of business professors and clergyme

Party affiliations have been ignore

the safeguards of our fathers and rush
ing pell mell into the affairs of Europe
The situation is a deplorable opc i
not alarming as is also our domesti
affairs dominated by gigantic Trusts
The evils are not of spontaneous
growth They are the result of ear
of labor and expenditure of million
of dollars Beginning with the dis
placement of American silver fo
English gold the cunning of Eng
lands diplomacy in shaping the des
tiny of our Republic is apparent to
any ordinary observer seeking the
true inwardness of events
The Cincinnati Enquirer has fre
quently called attention to each and
every move as it was transpiring and
during the campaign of 1900 will
present its readers with a truthful
array of facts that will be extremely
interesting and startling
No fair minded American be he
Republican Democrat or of other
political faith can afford at this critical
time to ignore the truth Partisan
prejudice with the Trusts as dictators
is a far more degrading slavery than
that which existed previous to the Civil
War of 61 64
Trusts in the United States alone
have a representative capital greater
than all the gold and silver in the
