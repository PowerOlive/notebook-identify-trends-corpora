HOW TO FIND OUT
Fill a bottle or common glass with urine
and let it stand twenty four hours a sedi
ment or settling indicates an unhealthy con
dition of the kidneys When urine stains
linen it is evidence of kidney trouble Too
frequent desire to urinate or pain iu the
back is also convincing proof that the kid
neys and bladder are out of order
WHAT TO DO
There is comfort in the knowledge so often
expressed that Dr Kilmers Swamp Root
the great kidney remedy fulfills every wish
in relieving pain in the back kidneys liver
bladder and every part of the urinary pas
sages It corrects inability to hold urine and
scalding pain in passing i or bad eflects fol
lowing use of liquor wine or beer and over
comes that unpleasant necessity of being
compelled to get up many times during the
night to urinate The mild aud the extraor
dinary effect of wamp Root is soou realized
It stands the highest for Its wonderful cures
