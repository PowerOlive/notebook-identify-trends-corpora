" Mr. J. F. Miller, aged eighty
two, died Thursday about eleven a.
m., of apoplexy. Mr. Miller's general
health was apparently good a few
days prior to his death. He was in
the kitchen with his housekeeper,
Mrs. DeWitt, only a short time be
fore he was found dead. On leaving
the kitchen he went to his room be
tween eleven and twelve o'clock,
Mrs. DeWitt called him to dinner sev
eral times, but met with no response
Believing him to be asleep she went
to his room and found him sitting in
his easy chair. A newspaper had
dropped from hs hand to his lap, and
his glasses had fallen fijom his eyes,
on the paper. Life was extinct,
death must have been almost momen
tary. Mr. Miller was one of our most
prominent and successful farmers, re
siding on the Maysville pike, about
four miles north of Millersburg, at
Forest Retreat, the old Lon Metcalf
home, which place he had owned for
a long time. Early in life he was

Rev. O. R. Mangum, former pastor
of the Paris Baptist church, now in"
charge of the Henderson1' cSurch, de
livered a scathing rebuke in an ad
dress in his church Sunday" night, to
the obstructionists who have endeav
ored to hinder the work of the pro
motors of the League of Nations. - In
the course of his rdmarks Rev. Man
gum said: "If the Senators refuse to
ratify the League of Nations the
blood of those who fall in the future
wars will be on then heads." Rev.
Mangum brought out the point that
Germany is more than apt to emerge
from the war strtmger than when she
went into it. v
The Henderson Daily Journal, in
its report of the address, has the
following:
"Rev. Mangum brought out the
point that Germany is apt to emerge
from the war stronger than she went
into it. Russia, mighty nation, was
an enemy of Germany, but has been
changed by the war to an ally, her
unlimited resources available to Ger
many. Italy fought with us, but
Italy is the natural ally of Germany.
It was Russia that Italy hated" not
Germany. Austria has broken up and
twenty million of her peopTe with
German sympathies, have gone with
Germany, giving Germany a strength
of eighty millions now as aganst
some sixty millions beforethe war.
The cause of Italy's enmity to Ger
many disappeared when Austria
broke up. Probably in another align
ment Italy would be found with Ger
many. All or tnis would give Ger
many power of which she never
dreamed and she would need but an
other Kaiser to lead . her to world
ambition.
"Rev. Mangum showed that Wood
row Wilson has but taken the next
step following the step forward taken
by George Washington. Washington
fought against States' rights for a
federal government or a rtation.
Wilson fights against national preju
dices for internationalism. Then -it
was State rights against national
rights.
"Rev. Mangum reviwed briefly the
good points of the League, showing
how there will have to be discussion
and delay before starting another
war. There will be time for cooling
down, for arbitration. War will be
the last thing and not the first
as it was In 1914. Had there been a
discussion there would have been no
war. Germany refused absolutely to
discuss the matter.
"Lastly Rev. Mangum showed that
the League of Nations was the ful
fillment of bibblical prophecy. It is
the day for which the world has hop-
!ed and prayed, dreamed and yearned
for. It has come."
