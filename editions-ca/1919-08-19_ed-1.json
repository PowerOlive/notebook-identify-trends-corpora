-at 2:00 p. m., at the Methodist
church, by his pastor, Rev. J. W.

""A large crowd was in attendance, and
- the services in every way were very
appropriate. Mr. Patterson was one
of the popular men of our commu
nity, and a zealous member of the
Methodist church. He lived for his
family and his church. There was"
nothing else in life that affected him
so much. He was a friend of the
preachers, and when a new minister
came to town Mr. Patterson was al
ways one of the fiist to greet him,
and bid him welcome. He has done
3nuch for the Methodist church.
Though quiet and unassuming, he
was alwajrs in his place and always
endeavoring to do something for the J
Xrpbuilding of humanity. He will
certainly be missed, and his place
lard to fill in his Qhurch. The in
terment was in the Millersburg cem
etery. A large concourse of people
followed the remains to its last rest
ing place, where they now repose be
neath a bower of flowers.
- Little Billie Brown, who sus
tained a fall some days ago, and was
confined to his bed for a few days,

HENRY.
Friends and relatives in this
city received news of the death in
Louisville last weekof Capt. Hugh
Henry, a former resident of this city,
and a gallant ex-Confe"defate soldier,
who served through the four years of
the Civil War with distinction. Capt.
Henry was in his seventy-eighth year
at the time of his death, which oc
curred at the Confederate Home at
Pewee Valley.
Capt. Henry was a native of this
county, having been born near Little
Rock, where his parents resided on
a large farm. He received the rudi
ments of his early education in the
county schools of his time, and came
to Paris to reside. When the war
came on he enlisted in the Confeder
ate service as a member of Co. H.,
Fourth Mounted Infantry, Orphan
Brigade. When the captain of the
company was killed in battle Henry
was chosen by a vote of the members
as his successor. This rank he held
until the close of the war, when he
returned to Paris to reside. He was
in business here for a time, and some
time after was made a member of the
Paris police force, serving with the
then Chief of Police James Mer
naugh. In this capacity he made a
faithful and fearless official, never
hesitating to do his duty. He was a
man of geneious impulses and had a
host of friends here who regret to
learn of his passing away. During
the larger part of their residence in
i Paris, Capt. Henry and family occu
pied a cottage at the corner of Pleas
ant and Eighth streets, the site of
which is now occupied by the home
of Mrs. John A. Schwartz.
Capt. Henry's wife preceded him
to the grave many years ago. He is
survived by two sons, Percy Henry
and Frank Henry, both of Louisville.
The funeral was held in the chapel at
the Confederate Home at Pewee Val
ley, Thursday, with services conduct
ed by the chaplain of the Home. The
burial followed in Cave Hill Ceme
tery, in Louisville.
