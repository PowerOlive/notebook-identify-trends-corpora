An Experience That Followed a Call at
Night
Four or five physicians were talking
up town the other evening at the home
of one and the conversation later turned
to shop One of them had recently
moved his office down town and there
was some discussion as to the advisabil
ity of separating house and office
Well said the separatist I cant
see any difference so long as I am at
my office during office hours
Let me tell you a story remarked
the oldest man in the party Thirty
years ago when I began practice I lived
in Virginia and for a year or two I
slept in my office Then I married and
my wife owned a nice house and I went
to it to live It sat back from the street
about 50 feet and we decided that it
would be much nicer if we had my office
out on the street in the far corner of the
lot Only 50 feet away you will ob
serve but still it was enough In order
to see suoh callers as came during the
night I had a night bell and a speaking
tube connecting the front door of the
office with my bedroom You see I did
not want a patient to escape under any
circumstances
Well everything went nicely enough
for three years or so when one night a
ring came to my bell It was then about
2 oclook in the morning and the ring
was a hot one I asked who it was and
the answer came from a friend of mine
to the effect that he was a mighty sick
man and wanted to see me at once I
told him to come around to the house
and I would meet him at the door and
take care of him Then I got up and
putting on my dressing gown and slip
pers I proceeded to the front door But
there was no one there and no one in
sight on the way between the gate and
the house
That was odd and I went back and
called through the tube to know what
was wrong I received no answer and
being quite unable to account for it I
k took my lamp it was a very dark and
still nignt ana started to go ouc anu
investigate Just as I was about to step
off the porch I lowered my lamp to
get a better light on the step and there
at the foot of the porch lay a body I
turned it over at once and as the light
fell on the face I saw it was my friend
who had only a minute before spoken to
me He was quite dead And when an
examination was madeit was discovered
that he had died of heart disease and
so near to me that I could almost have
touched him Possibly I could not have
been of any service to him if I had seen
him when he first rang the bell but the
possibility that I might so affected me
that from that day to this I have had
my office as near my bed as I could get
it Exchange
HE LOST A FORTUNE
Or There Are Moments Wlien One Wants
to Be Alone
A middle sized man with a gray
mustache and a red tie hitched up on
his collar walked through the restau
rant nodding to acquaintances here and
there As he stopped at the cashiers
desk a man who was seated at a table
noticed him and leaning across to his
said Captain S United
States postal inspector and grand official
catcher of green goods men
Yes with interest from the man
across the table
Sure I have always regarded him
with a peculiar affection He came very
near making me a rich man once in
fact almost made a wealthy citizen of
me so well to do that I would never
have had to work again
How was that with a shade of
incredulity
This way About a year ago the
captain superintended a grand haul of
green goods men The firm which he
raided was the largest perhaps in the
country and had unlimited capital
They had packages of good money to
catch suckers with and this money
amounting to over 150000 was cap
tured and placed in a big satchel by the
captain I called on him for details of
the story that afternoon He was alone
in the office There were three of us
the captain myself and the satchel He
opened the satchel and showed me
wealth beyond my wildest dreams I
hated to leave the beautiful vision
And the narrator sighed deeply
Well said his friend I dont see
how that was anything like making you
a rich man
You dont Well let me tell you
this If the captain had turned his back
for just six seconds I would have been
a rich man immediately But he never
turned and I had to go away again as
poor as when I came
And with another bitter heartrending
sigh he watched the inspector stroll out
into the street Chicago News
The Plausible Lio
We resent calumny hypocrisy and
treachery becanse they harm ns not be
cause they are untrue Take the detrac
tion and tho mischief from the untruth
and we are little offended by it Turn
it into praise and we may be pleased
with it And yet it is not calumny and
treachery that do the largest sum of
mischief in the world They are contin
ually crushed and are felt only in being
conquered But it is the glistening and
softly spoken lie the amiable fallacy
the patriotic lie of the historian the
provident lio of the politician the zeal
ous lie of the partisan the merciful lie
of the friend and the careless lie of each
man to himself that cast that black
mystery over humanity through which
we thank any man who pierces as we
would thank one who dug a well in a
desert Happy that the thirst for truth
remains with us even when -we have
willfully left the fountains of it John
Buskin
The Measure of the Man
When a man say i is satisfied with
his lot you may be ure of one of two
things either he if ciy enterprising
and cunning speciu of humanity or
he is a liar Up to i e
