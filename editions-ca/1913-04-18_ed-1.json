Luke McLuke Says
A faded working girl is always an
old maid, but a faded heiress is
always a bachelor gixl.
Any time a fool man marries for
money you can bet that he earns every
cent of it.
The reason a woman marries a
onery, no account man is that her rel
atives come to her fourteen days a
week 'and knock him.
It is ah outrage to claim.rthat girls
use bust forms. I am willing to be
fair and admit it. But bust forms
cost money, and you can get all the
ezcelsior'you can carry away for noth
ing. It; doesn't take a young father long
to Jearn how to dress a babv. But he
never can find the corn starch.
One good feature about the High
Cost of Living is that it has reduced
the number of lumps in the Bookings
you see on the street.
When a woman's physical charms
get a good grip on a man, he can
make a jelly fish look like the rock of
Gibralter.
There are a lot of useless things in
the world, but a goatee will nretty
near head the list.
The difference between little girjs
and big girls is that when a little girl
says she doesn't like me,i to kiss -.her
she means it.
When a girl forgets tcpull down her
shades atfnight a .whole lot of men in
the neighborhood ar3 adicted with in
somnia. The weather is still chilly, but the
girls are exhibiting their Swiss cheese
shirtwaits. x
If a girl really wants a husband a
$15 pair of corsets will do more to
land him than a $1,500 course in
music.
It is hard to appreciate the fact that
a girl has a rosebud mouth when you
discover that she has been eating
onions.
The reason a girl has to carry a
watch on her wrist is that the blarped
thing is always stopped.
A girl never gets so bashful that she
is (ashamed to gundress in front of a
looking glass.

$75,000 has been made" by Congress
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1914
for cooperative tire protection between
the States and the United States For
est Service under Section 2 of the

satisfactory by those who are actively
