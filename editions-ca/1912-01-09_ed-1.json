Almost a Failure.
A turkey pool, formed by a
of women of Bath county this
number
season,
came nepr being a failure. Last year
they went into a combine at Thanks
giving and refuoed to take the market
price for their turkeys, which was
12 cents, and they later received 16
cents for them. This year they thought
they could do the same way, and they
would not take the Thanksgiving price
of 12 cents, but held their turkeys for
more money ; but instad of gteing it
they came near not having a buyer
at all, and they have just sold 250
turkeys in the pool to Alex Doyle, of
Fleming county,, at 11 cents, 1 cent
less than the Thanksgiving price.

Rendered Unconscious by Fall.
Lawrence, the twelve year old son of
Mr. and Mrs. O. L. Soper, of Little
Rock, fell on the ice while skating
with some companions Friday after
noon and was rendered unconscious for
about iwo hours. Two physicians
worked with him until he regained
consciousness and he is now out of
danger.
Wheat Crop May Be Injured.
The zero weather which has prevail
ed throughout this section for the past
few days has been very deleterious to
the young wheat in Bourbon county.
The freezing of the ground which is
saturated with water from the recent
heavy rains, had a tendency to spew
the growing wheat out of the ground,
as it is so tender and has very few
routs. The snow which fell the latter
part of last week ;and last night
furnishes a good blanket and fine pro
tection for the growing crop. The
cold weather Jias been very hard on
unprotected stock causing much
suffering.
Kill More Than Wild Beasts.
The number of people killed yearly
by wild beasts don't approach the
vast number killed by disease germs.
No life is safe from their attacks.
They're in air, water, dust, even food
But gra ad protection is afforded by
Electric Bitters, which destroy and ex
pel these deadly disease germs from
the system. That's why chills, fever
aud ague, all malarial and many blood
diseases yield promptly to thisjwon
derful blood purifier. Try them and
enjoy the glorious health and new
strength they'll give you. Money back

Millers Would Push Kentucky
Wheat.
A special meeting of the Cenrtal
Kentucky Millers' Association was
held at the Phoenix Hotel in Lexing
ton Friday. The meeting was a long
one and did not come to a dose until
late in the afternoon.
The annual meeting of the Associ
ation is held in June, when the officers
are elected and other matters of par
ticular importance are decided. It also
usually holds a meeting in December
or January and, this year, as the meet
ing could not be held in December, it
was thought well to have it during
Farmers' Week, especially as the
principal proposition to be brought up
was an endeavor to have t the Experi
ment Station devote more'attentjon to
getting the wheat growing idea push
ed more vigorously before the farmers
by the experts at the college in their
demonstration trains.
Another matter of interest was the
condition of the insurance business in
regard to the milling trade. A com
mittee composed of President F. C.
Giltner of Eminence, and Secretary B.
M. Renick, of , Paris, was appoionted
to lay the matter before the Experi
ment Station officers.
The information which the millers
are particularly interested in being
gathered by the State is that pertain
ing to the acreage, conidtion, yield,
quality, etc., of the wheat crop in
Kentucky.
Large Number ol Marriage
Licensees.
During the year of 1911- Pearce
Paton, Clerk of the Bourbon County
Court issued a total of 120 marriage
certificates to white persons.
North Middletown Route Aban
doned. With a view cf exterding its lines
into the coal fields of Eastern Ken
tucky the Louisville Nashville rail
road recently surveyed a route frcm
this city to North Middletown and
through Clark county to Thompson
Station, tapping the line of the L. &
E. at Indian Fields, but according to a
rumor that Is in circulation here the
oute to North Middletown has been
abandond and it is stated that the
present line from Paris to Winhester
will be double tracked to meet the
heavy aVmand tf the traffic fr m the
rich coal fields in Eastern Kentucky,
and the extension from the coal fields
will be made from Winchester instead
of Paris.
It is said some important changes
will be made in the line from Paris to
Winchester for the purpos of improv
ing the line and a new grade will be
established at aeveral points. The new
track will be built on the west side of
the present track from Paris to Bed
ford when at this point it will diverge
to the right, passing through the land3
of Dr. Frank Fithian, Joseph Clay
and others, and will strike the old line
at Escondida. A short distance from
Escondida it again diverges from the
old line, passing through the farm of
Mrs. R. C. Talbott and others and re
turning to the old track at Renick.
The greotest divergence from the old
roadbed between Austeriltz and Ren
ick is about eight hundred feet.
The changes in this line is for the
purpose of eliminating several of the
heavy grades which materially hinder
the hauling of heavy frieght trains.
Mr. S. Brooks Clay,of this county will
undertake the task of securing the
necessary right of way between the two
cities for the double track.

itx would appear that his "Mother''

"Way Down East" and "The (Vi

destined to long life is the one that
can make an audience cry at on

hearty laughter. If this be a gec
criterion, "Mother" will still be enter
taining playgoers when the present
generation is no more, for it is inde-i
a difficult task to tell when the aad t
ences who see this piece are laughing
or crying. Some theatregoers lik
only the sentimental plays, wh.!
