"I was never very strong and female trouble kept meso weak I had no interest in my housework. I had such a backache I couldnot cook a meal or sweep a room without raging with pain. Rubbing myback with alcohol sometimes eased the pain for a few hours, but did not stop-it I heard of Lydia E.

Dayin and day out they slave in their homes for their familiesand beside the daily routine of housework, often make clothes for themselves and for their children, or work in their gardens, all the while sufferingfrom those awful bearing-down pains, backache, headaches, nervousness, theblues, and troubles which sap the very foundation of life until there comes atime when nature gives out and an operation seems inevitable.

Pinkham's Vegetable Compound is the natural restorativefor such conditions it may save them years of suffering and unhappiness.)

But what wewant to know is, do they stand thegreatest test of all the test oftime? Here is conclusive evidenceon this point from a Paris man:Phillip M. Heller, proprietor meatmarket, 314 Second street, says:"I have used Doan's Kidney Pillsa few times in the past and havebeen greatly benefited by them.Whenever my back has been weakor lame or my kidneys have actedtoo frequently, causing me to get upduring the night, a box of Doan'sKidney Pills which I get at Varden& Son's Drug Store has always givenfine relief. I crtainly think Doan'sare a splendid remedy and gladlyrecommend them to dnyone."(Statement given November 9,1916.)On November 12, 1920, Mr. Heller said: "I am glad to say the cureDoan's Kidney Pills made for me hasbeen a lasting one. All I said inthe past in favor of them I now confirm for I think just as highly ofDoan's to-day as I ever did."Price 60c, at all dealers.
