fortunesLife and property are secure in Cubaowing largely he said to the salutaryrestraint exercised by American military authority He thinks the timenot ripe yet however for a purely Cuban government Cuba said GenLee is improving The Cubans aretractable and quiet and the revolutionhas given them self respect and selfrelianceTheir impulses are generally in theright direction but of course both inthe theory and practice of self-governmentthey are wholly without experience There is among certain Cubansa deep seated prejudice against somemen who the Cubans think oppressedCubans under - Spanish rule and ifgiven a free rein the Cubans wouldmake short work of themThe United States government ispledged to grant independence to Cubaafter the island has been pacified andI believe that promise should be fulfilled just as swiftly as we can in reason and justice The industrial situation is improving and money is gradually going into Cuba but nothing likeas fast as it would if investors

paused one migh haveheard a pin drop so intense was the silence for fully a minute Then a dozenvoices broke out in exclamations ofamazement and disbelief and in theturmoil nothing intelligible could brdistinguishedThere was one listener however whosaid nothing but after the res hadcalmed down a bit ce secured a copy ofthe paper and hastened to the farmwhere he was employed with a wild impulse surging through his brain In hislittle room under the eaves he eagerlydevoured the article he had heard atthe store and in another column hefound an interview with one of the pioneers of Dawson City giving full details as to the proper outfit and its costIt was midnight when the stalwartyoung farmer sought his couch and forthe first time in his healthy life sleeprefused to come to him for he had madetip his mind to leave the village wherethe greater part of his youth had beenspent and seek his fortune in this distent land where a stout hear andstrong hands seemed able to force Nature to relax hi r icy grip on her goldenstoresTom Scotts life had been an uneventful one lie was the only son of a seacaptain and until the death of hismother they lived on Cape Cod Thenan uncle took him on his farm at Merrivale and his father continued his roving life A few years ago however ObedRider a native of Merrivale who hadsailed with Toms father as mate returned to the village with a story whichmade a great sensation at the time Itwas to the effect that Capt Scott haddeserted his ship at San Francisco andabsconded with a large sum of moneybelonging to the ownersTom was a lad of IS at the time butfew- would ever forget thescene when he hurled the lie at thetvrawny sailor and fought like a youngtiger until overpowered by the brutestrength of his fathers defamer whosenose was disfigured for life in the encounter and who vowed vengeance forhis injuryThis was four years ago but Tomjcott still felt the disgrace cast uponhis name His uncle had now beendead over three years and Tom hadsaved the wages paid him by the farmerfor whom he had worked since thattime until he possessed about 400-which was deposited in the village savings bank This would buy him a miners outfit but how to reach the farnorthwest was the problemHis sleep was troubled that nighttmt with the morning came the determination to start at once for Boston and trust to fortune to join one ofthe numerous expeditions organizingthereHis announcement was received withAmazement but Tom Scott was a mannf prompt action and that afternooneaw him in Boston He had been in thecity several times before and had nodifficulty in finding a respectable hotelwhere the rate was within his meansbut by the time he had eaten his supperfl was growing dark and a thick snowit orin set in He determined howevero lose no time in his search and made1ii way to the water front where hetoad no doubt he could obtain all thecerrfed in formationAtlantic avenue was practically deserted when he reached it and the bigflakes had covered the ground with awhite mantle which made his footstepsinaudible as he walked along not without a slight feeling of uneasiness as hethought of his little capital strappedabout his waist under his clothes in awaterproof belt which had been hisfirst purchaseAs he approached a saloon fromwhich came a confused murmur ofvoices and a sharp clinking of glassestwo men came out directly in front ofhim and turned in the direction inwhich he was walking being only afew feet in advance Coming from thewell lighted saloon as they did into thethick storm they failed to notice Tomand upon this fnet his whole ftiture depended although he was far from suspecting such an improbable thing atthe timeI tell you hes going on that barkto San Francisco said the taller of thetwo men easterly Hes bound for theKlondike and he must have a fat rollwith him 1 heard him say he wouldbuy his outfit out there We can layfor him on the dock when he is goingon boardIts a risky job replied the othernervouslyOh whats the matter with youwas the angry rejoinderNothing but we take great risks 1dont like itTheres no risk at all urged theother All we have to do is just taphim on the head and go through himThe whole thing wont take a minuteand Ave can be at Ihe West end beforehe knows what struck him Im goingto have his stuff and if you want to goback on me IllThe rest of the was indistinguishable The word Klondike hadnaturally attracted Toms attentionand he had involuntarily strained tocatch the mens conversation but hefelt a sudden thrill of horror as herealized the full import of what he hadjust heardWhat could he do That the menwere planning a robbery if not a murder was evident He could not warnthe intended victim for he had nomeans of finding or knowing him andto lose sight of the men to find anofficer was out of the question Thenthe athletic young fellow set his teethand shrugged his broad shoulder swhile under his gloves a pair of hardfists balled up involuntarilyTo some it might have occurred tono attention to the matter buTom Scott was of different caliber Itwas true that he had seen little of thegreat world but he was brave to afault and nature had added a tallwell knit frame to this gift He determined to prevent the villains fromaccomplishing their purpose if it layin his power and had no doubt of hisability to do soFearful that the men might turn andsee him he slackened his- pace and allowed them to gain several yards onhim keeping close to the buildingshimself and hoping each moment tosee an officerBut none4 appeared and soon the twothugs turned into a dark narrow alleyway which led to one of the wharvesand were lost to viewTom was in a quandary To ventureinto the place was to invite attack fromthe villains and he decided to wait ina convenient doorway until the intended victim came along or an oilicer should appear to whom he couldtell his storyA few yards to the right he found asheltered recess in front of a block andtook up his station keeping a sharplookout in the direction of the saloonwhere he naturally supposed the manwas enjoying himself A short distance away a street lamp shone dimlythrough the falling snow and threw abroad band of light on the sidewalkacross which no one could pass withoutbeing seen by himIt was a situation to try the stoutestnerves for Tom was unarmed and theman he was trying to save might beintoxicated while the two robberswould surely be provided with all thetools of their trade A dozen schemesflashed through his mind as hecrouched in the shadow only to be discarded as useless The time draggedslowly enough but his resolution didnot falterSuddenly a dark figure came staggering across the lighted space andToms heart gave a bound Was hishis man Would he have sense enoughto understand his dangerNo the drunken sailor lurched heavilyalong and turned up a side street ashort distance beyond the alleywaywhere the men were hiddenAnother and still another followed atintervals but none paused on their wayand Tom beq an to wonder if his earshad not played him false He was beginning to waver when a slight crunching noise at his left caused him to turnman disappear in the alleyway havingapproached from the opposite directionwhile Tom was looking up the avenueWhat was to be doneHe stood for a moment with his heartbeating tumultuously and every nervetingling Then from the dark openingI came a muffled cry followed by an Ioath and the sound of a struggleTom cast one quick look about himNo one was in sight and the next instant he had pulled off his gloves anddarted up the passageway at full speedThe darkness was intense for a shortdistance but after a few yards heemerged into a small open space in themidst of which the three men werewrithing and twisting in desperatestruggles Tom was unable to distinguish one from another but as hereached the spot one man tore himselffree and shoutedHelp Police Stand back or 111shootThe rest of his threat was drownedby a heavy blow from a blackjackwhich knocked the weapon from hishandStop cried Tom springing toward the assailantHe was too late for a second blowstretched the stranger senseless andbleedingon the snow and with an angrysnarl the robber turned just as Tomsright fist shot out with tremendousforceDown went the man like a strickenox and Tom grappled with the otherwith a shout of triumph His blood wasup and lifting his smaller opponentbodily from the ground he shook himas a mastiff would a terrierHands off panted the helplessman fiercely Curse you what areyou trying to doHe was not long in doubt for Tomhurled him against the side of a stonebuilding with such force that he fell inan inert heap and lay motionlessTom turned to see what had becomeof the taller man but at that instant hefelt a sharp pain in his side and a stronghand seized him by the throat and benthim backwards while a hoarse voicehissed in his earTake that for your pains you meddling foolWith a desperate effort he twistedhimself free from his assailant springing aside barely in time to escape another lunge of the murderous knife hehad just feltAgain the fellow lunged viciously athim but Tom caught his wrist and adesperate struggle ensued Althoughmuch the stronger man Torn found itno easy task to avoid the blade and thetwo swayed back and forth over thesnow the man trying to free his handfor a decisive stroke and Tom bendingall his efforts to prevent it Soon however his iron grip began to tell and hefelt his enemys muscles relax Tuttingall his strength into a supreme efforthe wrenched the knife free exclaimingIve got you now 30U murderer andI dont leave you till 3 ou are behind thebarsBut even in the moment of his victoryhe felt a cold ring of steel pressedagainst his ear and these ominouswords sounded behind himHold up your hands mister oryoure a dead man Quick I say or IllshootIt was a moment of fearful perilThere was murder in the mans tonesand Tom felt it He released his graspslowly and the larger man pushed himsuddenly backward cryingShoot him you IdiotHis action saved Toms life for theother man pressed the trigger at the-dStAvVirXniiirfclv in time to see the form of a 1 a moment ajrojITl j - I I I 1i M 1rfA strcrg hand seized him by the throatsame instant the bullet passing a footin front of the young mans face andflattening against the wall at his sideTom still retained the knife and witha quick slah he struck the hand whichheld the revolver causing the owner todrop it with a yell of pain and dash offtoward the street at fulL speed followedby his companion who had evidently nodesire to face Tom aloneAs the men disappeared he turned tofind the stranger he had rescued groaning with pain and trying to get on hisfeetTake mj arm and see if you cantstand said Tom Are you badlyhurtMy right arm is helpless and myhead goes round like a top was thefaint reply but Im coming round allright I guess I got a nasty clip fromone of them cutthroats I came to justas that chap

by thistime had made good their escapeAs the avenue was reached a herdichappened along and Tom hailed it athis companions suggestionTake us to the police station on Battery street he said to the driver andin a few moments they stood before theofficial in a well lighted room tellingtheir story A physician was in attendance upon a prisoner and he soon madea rapid examination of their woundsA few strips of plaster will fix yourscalp all right said he to the elderman and your arm is only numb fromthe blow Youll be all right to-morrowThen turning to Tom he addedYou have had a very narrow

flutingand Maddah nas dancing The littlelean golden brown girl in her raggedof brown and orange and scarletwas gay as a humming bird Lightlyas one she poised and floated andswayed over the burnt grasses anddanced faster and faster as Beppo witheyes of rapture made wilder musicSuddenly the pipe fell from his lipsand the dancer came to earthBrava bravissima from the lipsof a stringer had sufficed to break thespellThe newcomer was a bearded darkfellow of middle age with a widemouth and a smile of extreme enjoyment that fell on the children with asuffusing friendliness He was extravagPUtly dressed with a profusion ofb colors and a hat hung withribbons The children thought himvery fine and gazed at him openmouthedi am sorry he said making a bowto Maddalena to have

little ons he said my goodwife shall feed and clothe you If PapaAntonio is ever harsh or cruel with youmay the little one he gave to Heavenforget himHe took a hand of each and the children fascinated went away with himAntonio led his two goat herds towhere by the door of the biggest caravan a buxom kind faced woman withlong earrings cooked somethingsavory over a little stoveSee my beloved what I havebrought thee he said These are twolittle orphans rescued from hunger andthe whip to be thine own instead of theangel we have lostThey have no mother she askedalready opening her armsNor father my beautiful They arethe little children of the good God andnow they are oursA little later the white oxen wereonce more put in the yoke The whipscracked the great- caravan lumberedheavily and Beppo and Maddalena satsnugly within Antonios wheeled houselest any should see and recognize themand held eaeli others hands and lookedin each others eyes full of delight andwonder at their adventure and tearingnothing so long as they were togetherAntonio was as good as his word Nofather and mother could have beenmore tender to the little waifs than heand TeresitaThere was no hue and cry upon theirtrack Who cared for them poor littleinvaded the human crickets when the goats cameto dance to while the goatshome alone at evening At first thestick stood ready to the stout peasanthands to punish them when they shouldcome But presently it was realizedthat they would not come and nonegrieved since Beppo was a weaklingand Maddalena passionate aud obstinateThe years passed rerj happily journeying up and down the strange countries with Antonio and Teresita andtheir troupe of mummers Madalenabrought prosperity of a kind to Antonio She was no ordinary dancinggirl no common acrobat The strengthand suppleness which had made Antonio call her Flower of the Air retained her name and evervwhere thehe caravans halted drew crowds to seethis stale of things as thoughher dance on the tight rope and disport herself at giddy heights as secureand graceful as any birdBut as the snows and the stormsdrove the circus into winter quartersso the snows of age in time fell on Antonio They had all earned for the dayand saved nothing and the time camewhen the troupe melted and broke upand Antonio and Teresita were left allbut alone with their childrenit was then that the English impresario saw the perfoivmance of the Flower of the Air and offered her an engagement at a salary that nigh tookher breath awayMaddalena danced with joyNow it is my turn she said andyou will go back to Sicily little father and mother and own a little vineyard and keep a roof for Beppo andme to return to one dayBeppo will go with thee child Vsaid Antonio It is well Are you notbrother and sister And Teresita andI will be happier knowing he is nearthee in the wicked worldAll these years Beppo sickly anddreamy had been little use in theRomano troupe Not that he was everallowed to feel that his Sicilian pipingwas thin as the cicalas song to thosewho liked the blare of brazen instrumentsHe brought love for him when hecame said Teresita to whom theoren stood m place 01 tne oaoy snehad lost and both she and Antoniowere proud of the tall handsome delicate lad who had the look of a signorand not of a son of peasantsWhy father and mother mine saidMaddalena in response to Antoniosspeech we have a much better planthan that a much better planShe blushed and dimpled all over likea brown pool in sunlightWe are to marry Beppo and ISee you we have always loved each other Before vou came to love us wehad only each other and the Madonnaand the angels And it is better thatI should be Signora than Signorina inthe world we go toSo it was settled and the little loversof old became husband and wife andwent away with the English impresario while Antonio and Teresita wentsadly back to Siciljr and became proprietors selling the caravans and turning the white oxen to the plowThey looked long for the children tocome to them but they did not come although the fond and faithful letters andthe money came regularlyA little longer wrote Maddalenaand we will come and will stay and Ishall forget that I

and rat killing contests have become so stringent thesports of Xew York city have been attheir wits end to devise some pastimethat was exciting and at the same timewas not covered by any statute Itremained for a Mexican who came tothis country for thi winter and whomissed his regular Sunday bull fight tcfurnish an innovation in the matter oisportsAt considerable expense he sent tcMexico and obtained about 25 of themost pugnacious crickets that thatcountry is famous for Upon their arrival he at once put them in trainingand after he was fully satisfied as totheir ability to give a good account oithemselves in the arena he invitee unumber of friends to his apartments tcwitness a battle rovalHe first produced a cage filled withpartitions in which he kept his warriors Then came the arena a pasteboard box about two feet square andfour inches deep the bottom of whichcovered with fine sand Openingx slide in the cage he allowed a cricketto leap into the ring Then he touchedthe nose of the insect with a straw onwhich was a drop of amber coloredliquid the name of which he refusedto tell but said it was made principallyof cactus juice and had the effect oigreatly irritating the crickets temper A second cricket was put on thebattlefield and treated precisely in thesame manner Then the hostilities beganThe two warriors glared at each othifor a fewT moments and then made aedp as if to meet in midair In thishey were not successful but on recovering their feet hopped to closequarters Then rising on their hindlegs the began fencing with their forelegs all the time watching for a chanceto grasp the antagonist At length onegot an opening and with a spring threwitself forward far enough to grasp thehind legs of the other between its mandiblesThen the battle was on in all

generally worn by the amateursportsman and the roughest and oldest knockabout suits that have alreadydone good service for several seasonsIn the matter of clothes there is nchard-and-fast rule every one followshis own fancy and many Scottish lairdshave their outdoor garments made bytheir tailor in their nearest local townThere is however one exception tothis rule and that is where fishing isconcerned there for obvious reasonsthe costume must be more or less ofa uniform and must include wadersmade of the best quality gutta perchaas so much of the fishermans and fisherwomans time must be spent actuallyin the water Of late years for shooting-suitsthe Scotch and Irish friesesand homesuns have replaced ccrduroys and velveteens and are of coursevery much more practical from everypoint of
