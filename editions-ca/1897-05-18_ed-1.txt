the Turkswho were almost without artilleryThe Greeks forced the first Turkishline of defense but met with a stubborn resistance at the second In several places the bayonets were so closeto the cannon

engagementAil the Greek efforts are now concentrated upon capturing Nicopolisand Prevesa before advancing to PentepighadiaLondon May 15 The correspondent of the Times at Athens saysThe resumption of offensive operations in Epirus greatly complicates thesituation and tends to hamper the negotiations for peace The erident intention of the Greek commanders is tocapture the Turkish positions there inorder to show that they have not beendefeatedIn an interview Friday M Rallithe premier repeated his statementthat humanitarian motives are responsible for the advance in Epirus but hedid not deny the advantages whichmight be hoped for from the captureof Prevesa and the occupation of theadjoining Turkish territoryWe are still at war51 he said anduntil an armistice is concluded Greeceretains her liberty of action We cannot allow our activity to be confinedto Thessaly where the Turks are preponderant The powers have hinderedus from acting in Crete but Greececan not be barred everywhere norcompelled to restrict her operations toa limited areaWe have done our best to obtain anarmistice and until it is accorded wemust act where and when we can Ifwe have not already prosecuted thewar at various points and among theislands of the Aegean it is only because we have taken into consideration the sufferings to which the Greekpopulation might be subjectedThe government apparently thinksthat a renewal of the war will hasteninstead of retarding the armisticeThis calculation may prove to be correct but it is more likely that Turkeywill seize upon it as an excuse for delaying the armistice and will deal acrushing blow in ThessalyLondon May 15 The Constantinoplecorrespondent of the Daily Telegraphsays The sultan acting upon the advice of Emperor William has declaredto M Camdon the French

Indian 25111The Morgan Cuban Resolutions lately to Pass in the Senate The Pacific Railroad ILand PatentsWashington May 17 The houseleaders have not yet decided upon themethods by which they will maketheir response to the presidents message which will be tsent to congressMonday or Tuesday -asking for relieffor the starving Americans in CubaThat the response will be quick andcomplete however there is no reasonto doubt In the present condition ofaffairs in the house three methodsof procedure are open Ordinarilythe message would go to thecommittee on foreign affairs forconsideration and that committeewould report a bill which wouldcome back to the house foraction through the regular channelsThe speaker could in the present emergency simply appoint this committeeand let the whole subject take theregular course But it is hardly likely that this will be done The subjectis so well understood that it will probably be thought that the memberswith the message and the accompanying documents which the presidentwill transmit before them can act intelligently without a committee report If the committee is not appointedtwo other courses will be open Firstafter the receipt of the message a billmay be formulated bv the leaders anda special order reported by the committee on rules for its considerationThis would bring the whole questionat once before the house for actionBut this method would be disadvantageous perhaps in that both housesstruggling to the same end simultaneously would act on different billsthus entailing delay for adjustment of differences in conference The most likely course is thatthe house will await the action of thesenate if action is had promptly andthen consider to senate bill or jointresolution under a special order Thesentiment in favor of recognition ofthe Cuban insurgents is strong in thehouseand avery radical measure mightbe passed if the house were allowedfree action With a senate measuredealing only with the question of therelief of the suffering Americans before the house under a special orderpossibility of amendment would becut off and the house would be compelled to accept or reject it as passedby the senate The conference reporton the Indian bill probably will comebefore the house this weekThe proceedings in the senate thisweek are by no means settled Allwill depend upon the course the Cuban question may taka Senator Morgans joint resolution occupies the favored place on the calendar and thereis little doubt that it will be taken upat the appointed hour Monday Stillthere is a slight possibiliiy that the expected message of the president maycause a postponement and that thecharacter of his recommendations mayhave a bearing that will influence thetenor of the resolution that ultimatelywill be adopted The Alabama senator will not stand in the way of actionin accordance with such a reepmmendation as the president may make uponthis subject but he will insist that itshall be independent of and that itshall in nowise interfere with his resolution providing for recognition of Cuban belligerencyWith the Cuban question in its present shape and with no other pressingbusiness before the senate the debateon this subject will be of uncertainduration It may continnue practically all the week and it may cometo a very sudden and speed3 termination There is little or no doubt thatthe Morgan resolution will pass whena vote is reached and the indicationsare that the majority for it will be thegreater for the recent delay Therewill continue to be some oppositionand the plea will be made that anymaterial aid given in accordance withexecutive recommendation is all thatcan be reasonably expectedIf Cuba does not occupy the entireattention for the week much of thetime is likely to be given to the general calendar Senator Gear will makean effort to have the Pacific railroadbill considered while Senator Lodgewill if the opportunity offers makethe same effort in behalf of the immigration bill Senator Pettigrewwill call up the resolution forthe investigation of the Pa-cific railroad land patents TheIndian appropriation bill will bebrought in on a conference report Init there remains only the one point ofdifference on the Urfcompahgre landsto be settled The sundry civil conference probably will be postponed until Senator Allisons return to the citySenator Aldrich will make the opening statement in behalf of the tariffbill on the part of the majority of thenuance committee on -Tuesday but itwill rest with individual senatorswhether the debate shall be continuedbeyond this speech at that time Theprobabilities are that the statementwill produce some badinage and thatafter this the senate will adjourn until when the debate will beginin earnest Senator

Lamont at theinstigation of a stranger and in consideration of the payment of 700 forhis bloody work It is with this sensation that the attorneys will strengthen their case at Sacramento Thestory and

1895 or on thefirst day of April He is now servinga term for horse stealing and appearsto be saneAbsolutely no credence is apparently placed by any one unless by theprisoners attorneys upon the

Republic Drawn by President McKinley Its Latest Ruler Many Distinguished Men of the Country Present Address by the PresidentPhiladelphia May 17 Here inthe city which first placed on his browthe laurel crown of achievement thememory of George Washington thesoldier the statesman and the manwas honored Saturday in monumentalbronzeThe cord which relaxed the swaddling flags from the figure of the firstruler of the republic was drawn by itslatest ruler Surrounding- him weremen in whose veins runs the blood ofthose first patriots who battled shoulder to shoulder with Washington andwith him made possible the scene enacted Saturday a scene conceived andplanned by those very comrades inarms executed by their sons in peaceIt was a notable gathering and representative of the country includingthe president the vice president andthe cabinet officers its defenders inthe officers and privates of the armyand navy and its best blood in thedirect descendants of the mouldersand the makers of the nation MajWm Wayne president of the Societyof Cincinnati who formally presentedthe monument to the city traces hisJineage straight to Mad Anthonyand Wm W Porter the orator of heday is a grandson of David Rittenhouse Porter twice governor of Pennsylvania and a great grandson of GenAndrew Porter who was on Washingtons staff in the revolutionThus no historic interest was wanting to stimulate enthusiasm Theactual unveiling ceremony was impressively simple Bishop Whitakeropened with prayer and Maj Waynefollowed with an appropriate addressThen came the unveiling by PresidentMcKinley and the resultant clamoraugmented by the national salute of21 guns by the artillery and by theforeign and American war vessels inthe Delaware This concluded President McKinley spoke briefly as followsPRESIDENT MKINLEXS ADDRESSFellow Citizens There is a peculiar andtender sentiment connected -with this memorial It expresses not only the gratitudeand reverence of the living but is a testimonial of affection and homage from thedeadThe comrades of Washington projected thismonument Their love inspired it Their contributions helped to build it Past and present share in its completion and future generations will profit by its lessonsAs commander-in-chief of the colonial armies from the beginning of the war to theproclamation of peace as president of theconvention which framed the constitution oithe United States and as the first presidentof the United States under that constitutionWashington has a distinction differing fromthat of all other illustrious Americans Ncother name bears or can bear such a relationto the government Not only by his militarygenius his patience his sagacity his courage and his skill was our national independence won but he helped in largest measure todraft the court by which theguided and he wasnation wasthe first chosen of thepeople to put in motion the new governmentHis was not the boldness of martial displayor the charm of captivating oratory but hiscalm and steady judgment won mens support and commanded tSeir confidence by appealing to their best and noblest aspirationsAnd withal Washington was ever so modestthat at no time in his career did his personality seem in the least intrusive He wasabove the temptation of power He spurnedthe suggested crown He would haveno honorwhich the people did not bestow an interesting fact and one which I love to recall isthat the only time Washinton addressed theconventiontion during all its sessions overwhich he presided in this city he appealedfor a larger representation of the people in thenational house of representatives and his appeal was instantly heeded Thus he was everkeenly watchful of the rights of the people inwhoso hands was the destiny of our government then and nowMasterful as were his military campaignshis civil administration commands equal admiration His foresight was marvelous hisconception of the philosophy of governmenthis insistenco upon the necessity of educationmorality and enlightened citizenship to theprogress and permanence of the republic cannot be contemplated even at this periodwithout filling us with astonishment at thebreadth of his comprehension and the sweepof his visionHis was no narrow view of governmentThe immediate present was nothis sole concern but our future good his constant themeof study He blazed the path of liberty Helaid the foundation upon which we havegrown from weak and scattered colonial governments to a united republic whose domainsand power as well as whose liberty and freedom have become the admiratiou of theworld Distance and time have not detractedfrom the fame and force of -his achievementsor diminished the grandeur of his life andwork Great deeds do not stop in their growthand those of Washington will expand in influence in all the centuries to followThe bequest Washington has made to civilization is rich beyond computation The obligations under which he has replaced mankind are sacred and commanding The responsibility he has left for the American people to preserve and perfect what he accomplished is exacting and solemn Let us rejoicein every new evidence that the people realizewhat they enjoy and cherish with affectionthe illustrious heroes of revolutionary storywhose valor and sacrifices made a nationThey live in us and their memory will help uskeep the covenant

while with his right he wasmaking- unsuccessful jabs with someblock thread at the ere thereof So intent was he upon this task that he neverheard Lamberts footfall nor noted hiscoming and the lieutenant while pausing-a moment irresolute took quick observation of the stranger and his surroundings lie was clad in the grayshirt and light blue trousers such aswere worn by the rank and file An ordinary soldiers blouse was thrown overthe back of the camp stool on which hesat and his feet were encased in thecoarse woolen socks and heavy brogansand leathern thongs just exactly suchas the soldier cook was wearing at thehissing- fire a few paces away ITis suspenders were hung- about his waist andin iiis lap seat uppermost and showinga rent three inches in length were apair of uniform trousers with a narrowwelt of dark blue along- the outer seamThey were thin and shiny like bombazine in places and the patch whichseamed destined to cover the rent was-jive shades too dark for the

knew very well In visiting- classmates already on duty with their batteries among- the New York and TsewEngland forts as well as during- hisbrief stay at the barracks he had notedthe scrupulous deference of the veteransergeants when addressing their officers He could understand awkwardness and clumsiness among the recruitsbut the idea of a corporal chuffing- himon the cut of his clothes and the ideaof a two months recruit being a corporal anyhow Never in the tales toldof the JTire zouaves of C3 had he heardof anything- much more free-and-easythan the manners of this camp of regulars Never in his wildest dream hadhe fig ured such a specimen of the commissioned officer as he found in CaptClose In the contemplation of thischaracter the go-as-you-please style ofthe enlisted men sank into insignificance Long years afterwards Lambertused to go over this meeting in his mindand for two years often importunedhe would convulse his brother officersby vivid description of it But therecame a time when they no longerlaughed and he no longer told the storysave to those he loved and trusted utterlyAroused bv some unusual chatteramong- the men the first sergeant ofcompany G smoking a pipe while working over a ration return stuck his headout of his tent and saw a voungin a light colored suit courteously raising a drab derby in his kidgloved hand while he stood erect withsoldierly case before the company commander Sergt Burns also noted thatsome of the men were tittering andall of them looking- onOne glancev as enough The sergeant dropped penand pipe and came out of his den witha single bound buttoning- his blouseand about him as he did soHush your d d gab you he fiercely growled at the nearest group Getinto your coats there lie swore atanother while with

thebedMarked not the way it wentHeavy with Grief their aching tear dimmedeyesSaw but the shadow fall and knew notwhenOr in what fair or unfamiliar guiseIt left the world of menIt broke from sickness that with ironbandsHad bound it fast for many a grievousdayAnd love itself with its restraining handsMight not its course delaySpace could not hold it back with fetteringbarsTime lost its power and

has no fancy of wearing thestained garb of sin until the sun of virtue shall bleacfi it white He would-don immediately the snowy robe andbe made welcome among the electWhich may not be If you mean to reform you must go awayLovat grew sick of the life he hadled for ten years ever since he had beena pretty boy of 18 who should have beenlearning useful things It had uotbeensuch a very bad life but it certainty hadnot been a good one He tried to doright at home and failed Then he-came to tl statesXow the states if you except perhaps Xewr York is a place where thereare neither towns nor temptations Overall its broad prairies where sleek steersbrowse and gentle coursers stray therehangs an atmosphere of soft pastoralvirtue There is also in the human hearta true natural goodness learned fromthe unspoiled savage There is noand a man is what he is notwhat he has been They know this inEngland just as we in the states knowthat there is one fair sized town inAustralia and that all the rest isbushLovat knew it and he also knew thatit was most true of Montana That hewas aware of the existence of Montanashows that his youth was not altogether wasted His family had someland there Of this family it must besaid that nothing in England is betteror older Lovat is a name of such luster that no bearer of it whatever hismisbehaviors could tarnish it It isalso a rich family very rich WiltonLovat was the younger son but he hada decent fortune of his own Thereforehe could do pretty much as he pleasedand when he quarreled with his fatherand his allowance was stopped he didntcare His father argued with him persuasively Why if you want to reform cant you stay here and do it23ecause a chap cant in his owntown4lle can if hes any characterNo he cantI say he can What do you suppose Idid His voice subsided as he contemplated himself in the pleasant lightof an exampleYou didnt reform You only mar-ried- Which happened to be so true thatLovat Sr was unable to reply save inthe not uncommon parental fashion ofanswering the unanswerable known tochildhood as getting even He cut oiithe allowance but graciously permittedhis ungrateful son to dwell upon theMontana landsWilton went at breeding racers as isthe custom of Montana He had a loghouse on the ranch and it was furnished Hvith rough chairs and tables andbunks and with many sorts of stringinstruments and with pictures of hisfamily and of some girls who had likedhim and of professional beauties who-were not nearly so beautiful as his ownMem 4K t-A -Patriarchs as lie understood it hadwives and children He had only

the post club hut theydid not invite him to their houses Hedid not meet their daughters nor theirwives An Englishman has togrowwise before he learns that this is a smallwTorld and that the tight little isle isnot too tight for rumors to escape fromit that the rumors moreover are frequently exaggerated Lovat began togrow wise At first he wondered thenhe understood He asked himself whatafter all is the reward of virtue and hedetermined that it has none There arethose who hold otherwise but the question is not yet settled He was lonelyexpatriated and homesick He was alsoyoung and full of energy and anxious tobe met half way But he could nottravel the wrhole road alone He turnedand went back to where he had startedfrom There at least there was feminine companionship His vice was lessgilded than of jore but that was thefault of the countryHe threw over once and for all everyhope of admission to the society of hisequals in the garrison The service iscritical and jealous of its worn em Buthe was still entertained by the menWhen it was too late to mend forcopybooks to the contrary notwithstanding it frequently is he came torepent more heartily than ever beforeave bittcrlv He met and fell in lovewith Constance Chamberlain as manyanother man has done and still doesthough she is Mrs Brookiield now- Shewas even prettier then than to day forshe was very young just 18Lovat knew her by sight but he hadnever spoken to her or heard her sxeakwhich was a harmonious treat untilhe came upon her one day some fivemiles from the post She had dismounted to tighten her saddle girths and shewas alone How should Lovat haveguessed that she had seen him comingere she had slipped to the ground andthat she wras purposely goading herplacid black steed to be unmanageableHe came to her aid with an Allow meto be of service which she answeredwith a You are very good thank youYou should not be away off herealone Miss Chamberlain he saidI know itIt is not safeI am so tired of being safe Hervoice was sweet low and unemotionalThere was no suggestion in it of unfeminine rebellion And Lovat who hadnot heard the voice of a gentlewomanfor many many months was pleasedwell pleasedI only

indigestion and this with other troubles broughton nervousnessMy physician prescribed for me for sometime and advised me to take a change ofclimate I did as requested and was someimproved Soon after I came here as a professor in physics and chemistry and laterwas financial agent of this college Thechange agreed with me and for awhile myhealth was better but my duties were heavyand again I found my trouble returningThis time it was more severe and in thewinter I became completely prostrated Ihied various medicines and different physicians finally I was able to return to myduties Last spring I was elected presidentof the college Again I had considerablework and the trouble which had not beenentirely cured began to affect me andlast fall I collapsed I had different doctorsbut none did me any
