Hail fell in plentiful quantities near Ruddles Mills, but Ittledamage wes done. Near Black'sCross Roads a bunch of sheep feedingon a rising piece of ground betweentwo small creeks were entirely cutoff by the rising waters, which finally engulfed and drowned them. Nodamage was done in Paris by thestorm, which seemed to have spent itsviolence in the county.Reports from various sections ofthe county yesterday indicated theseverity of the storm to have beenfelt in those vicinities. Parties fromParis returning from Ruddles Mills,where they had been observing Flower Mission Day at the County Infirmary, stated that the hail was veryheavy along the pike between Parisand Ruddles Mills and in some placeswas piled up in little mounds.A storm of rain and hail fell at"Versailles shortly after two o'clockSunday afternoon.

Mr. Fister is yeryoptimistic regarding the prospects ofthe company and reports the progresslot sinking a new well, which hasItCVUUCU a. UGJJlll VJL &,1UU 1COI,The Elizabethtown News has thefollowing interesting oil note: "Reliable information reaches here thatHon. James M. Richardson, of Glasgow, bought the oil leases of 450acres in Allen county for which hepaid $50,000 and the next day soldthe same for $75,000, making a profitof $25,000 in a day."A negro woman claims she ispumping oil out of her water wellat her home in "Poynterville," a col-I ored suburb of Winchester. Her storynas caused considerable excitement,and a well-known colored porter consulted with his white friends on theadvisability of organizing an oilcompany to develop the prospect.Several wells are due in the coming week in the Airedale section ofLee county. The Paris Oil & GasCompany has about completed No.3, Celia Kincaid, while the Frye-Sweetster Company is expecting aa nice producer in its No. 4 on theE. King tract. In the same locality,the Big Sinking Oil Company is drilling No. 2 on the Warden farm.Announcement is made that theCumberland Pipe Line Company hasgreatly extended its operations during the past two years, and is considering further extensions of itsplant so as to keep up with the rapiddevelopment of the field. Its linesare now taking care of approximately20,000 barrels per day, from Unproductive pools of Lee, Estill, Powelland Wolfe counies.Pipe line runs for the week endingMay 30 total 108,686.86 barrels, asreported by the Cumberland PipeLine Company. Of this amount theBig Sinking district of Lee countysupplied 68,819.31 barrels. Two significant features of the report arethe excellent showing made by theHell Creek district, the new pool being developed in Lee county, whichdelivered 1,499.62 barrels, and thefalling off in the production of RossCreek, Estill county, which reportsonly 2,296.50 barrels.J. E. Weton, of Beattyville, will bein Paris on Tuesday to close a contract with the Lane Oil Company forwells on their Hell Creek lease, asas good wells are being reported fromthis district. The Lane Companyexpects to get their share of the bigproducers. The issue of ten-centstock has been rapidly subscribedand when outside points have beenheard from it is belived same isaway oversold. This is going somefor a company organized only a fewdays ago.The Parboken Oil Company, ofParis, brought in its No. 4 well onthe Kinkead lease in Lee county Saturday. This is the best well on thelease, and is considered by the drillers as a 150-barrel well flush. TheNo. 4 well beat the No. 3 well in onaccount of a fishing job on No. 3, butthe latter is expected in this weekand will in all probability be a better well than the No. 4. This company also expects to couple up withthe pipe line its No. 1 well on theJones lease. The Parboken now hassix producing wells and is in its infancy. The property of the Rice Oil Company in Elliott county was sold recently at a master commissioner'ssale in that county to Paris partiesfor a sum said to be $10,000. It isreported that Mr. James H. Moreland, of Paris, one of those whobought this tract, is planning to startdevelopments at once. The propertywas sold to satisfy the demands ofthe creditors of this company.

WVGRATZER. vFirst it was Estill, then later Lee that sent the Kentucky oil boom a sizzling. Now it is Allen. Atleast it is Allen County for the oil 'men of moderate means who wish to lease some property and "dig a hole."For it costs lessto Idrill a well and and operate a lease in Allen County than any of the oil producingcounties of Kentucky. This is not merely a guess, or brought out by careful complication of costs and expenditures that go hand in hand withe oil development, but the cost of operating in Allen County is somuch .cheaper than other counties of Kentucky, that right now it is drawing more new operators than evenin Lee, the end of the Kentucky oil prospector's rainbow. & J: i .'. 1 1 U I I"There are more drills in Allen County right now than any other county in the State," said a Louisville oil man recently after returning from a tour of inspection of Allen County in search of a suitable leasefor his company. There is a reason for this condition. Oil men of experience state without hesitationthat a well can be drilled in Allen County for $1,200, while in other oil producing districts the cost caneasily run to $5000 or more if roads are bad and one of the many oil mishaps sets itself in the path of thedrill. Water is plentiful in Allen County, which is another factor highly favoring the prospector. In theEastern oil section of the State, quite frequently during the hot summer month? operations ceased on someof the biggest. leases because of water shortage. "ti .:.',' !: 'Vi'sr'My-',;,-' ; BABHEII AND WAIOtENj $00 &l'9 7'' .Barren and Warren counties, two of the latest coiners in the Kentucky oil boom, are sharing the popularity of Allen County as, cheap operating districtsk In Barren and Warreif counties there is much excitement at this time, not only because it costs little to operate there, but .because the percentage of drv holes runaround only 10 per cent, which is an exceedingly low average.At the rate new drills are being set up in Allen, Warren and Barren counties, Western Kentucky bidsfair to become the center of oil activity in Kentucky this summer, unless another Lee county springs, up in.the vast possible oil areas that so far have not been scratched by the drill..B . i IS OPEN COUNTRYAllen County terrain is the oil man's delight. It is an open country and promises a long life for oil Iproduction fas it 4s gotten under a limestone formation. In drilling a well in Allen, casing pipe, which is al- Iways a piorn in xnet aruiers suae, Decanse oi so many inings max can nappen w re ana rum tne wen, is armost unnecessary. It .never requires' more than 60 feet of casing- for an Allen county well, and this is mere-ly to keep surface waters out of the well as the drill goes down to the limetsone formation.The- Gainesville pool is the heart of the Allen County field as tested out to date. A drill put down within the. limits of this pool is sure to get oil in paying quantities. Production is spreading f rom, the Gainsville Pool toward Half Way and Allen Springs, several good wells and domes being found in the .vicinity, of the JatteifjpIaJDes, indicating the good .structure of the Gainsville Pool extends farther than is generallybelieve.. Alien is strictly a "dome field," but it is just this feajture, that makes it possible to drill into oilin almost any section of the county. The productive area is not liinite&to certain localities as Tfiueh as itis in Lee. Estill and other, Eastern Kentucky counties.''.,.'. ... LEASES HELD HIGH' The property, owners xf Allen, Barren and Warren counties are wide; awake. They know what theyhave an4io $fctfer "piooi of .this is seeithan the prices they demand for leases. Wild cat territory, whereoil production is only a chance, is selling for $150 an acre. The same land would have sold for $1.00 anacre before oil was found. The leases are much higher in proportion to the .other oil producing counties,but this is as it shouldLbe, for none .other offers the easy development" of Allen County.The o man, ox oU company holding a lease on Allen County property dqes not have to spend a fortunein developing tt or,sina.tetwepvtsascertsa .just what he has bought:' This in itself, is enough tomake it certain ihe buli-M summer development in Kentucky will center in'tne western counties of Allen,WBXTCU wiu,4MUJiwi..' -5::::i.BUY NOWti ...r:1S-?of ... ..A Company Qranize4 to Develop Properties, m tfe.

Day after day they are rackedwith backache and headache; sufferfrom nervousness, dizziness, weakness, languor and depression. Perhaps the kidneys have fallen behindin their work of filtering the bloodand that may be the root of thetrouble. Look to your kidneys, assist them in their work give themthe help they -need.

Every soldier whohas gone back has been a hero untilproved otherwise, and the temptation not to prove themselves otherwise has been too much for some.There is the case of the Air Service machine who went back withheart trouble. His home town newspaper printed his "diary," which recounted several stirring fights overthe German lines, all imaginary.The nearest he had been to the frontwas Issoudun.There is the case of the sergeantwho lectured on the battle of Cantigny for the Fourth Liberty Loan(and sold a lot of bonds, too) untilhe was found to have spent all hisstay in France, barring travelingtime, at Le Mans.And there is the case, just to showhow hard it was not to be a hero, ofthe major who returned and, merelyobeyingvmilitary regulations, refusedto be Interviewed. As far as he hadgot toward gunfire and danger wasa training school at Langers. "Modestly dclining to speak of his part inChateau-Thierry fighting," was thesecond line of the heading over thestory about him in the next morning's paper. The fault was thenewspaper's, not the major's.To date, in. the eyes of the peopleback home, every soldier who hasbeen in Europe has undergone thehorrors of the front. Private JohnnieJones, of the S. O. S., whose greatesthardship in this war was taps at9:30, was pictured in his home journal and captioned, "John Jones, ofThis City, Now Battling For Freedom In the Trenches." It is goingto be hard to convince the home folksthat of the 2,000,000 Americans inFrance, half of them, through nofault of their own, of course, nevergot under fire.But, once the idea is around, andonce we get back with our firsthand knowledge of affairs over here,the bogus hero is going to have apretty thorny trail.

Connelly writes in Everybody's:"Leon Daudet, son of Alphonse Daudet, and one of the editors of L' ActionFrancaise, is the author of a book,'Before the War," which appeared in1913, and in which he outlined thepreparations made by Germany toconquer France. He showed howGermany had made herself master ofthe wheat, of the iron and of theother products of France, and howunder the guise of commerce she hadacquired the most important militarydepots of the latter country buyingup farms along the frontier and making maps of all the country aroundabout. The French people laughed atDaudet's 'nightmare.' They did notsuspect that not only was Daudetright, but that Germany had reachedout and captured the political machinery of France, or a good part ofit, and that its unseen hand guidedthe politcal destinies of the men whowere to control French statecraftduring the war and who wouldhave controlled it, but for the doggedcourage and patriotism of one manClemenceau, the Tiger of France."Joseph Caillaux, the overshadowing figure in this international conspiracy, languishes in a prison on theoutskirts of Paris, awaiting trial.Some of his followers and confederates have paid the high penalty fortreason, among them Bolo and Duval. The others are serving variousterms in jail."oHISTORICAL DRIVE IN KENTUCKY. June is historical month in Kentucky. Every county in the State isnow engaged in making a permanentrecord of the part it played in theworld war.The records of the soldiers are being made on war record sheets. Therecords of the civilia-ns are beingmade in the form of reports of thework done by the County Council ofDefense, Red Cross Chapters, LibertyLoan Campaign Committees, Women's Clubs and other organizationswhich took part in winning the war.When these records are completedthey will be bound in permanentform and placed in the archives ofthe county.The Kentucky Council of Defenseinaugurated this work in September,1918, by appointing State and CountyHistorians. These historians are engaged in the laborious task of compiling complete lists of the men whohave lost their lives, those who havebeen wounded and those who havewon special honors. They are alsomaking a complete roster of all menin the service. A special effort is being made to get a complete list of thevolunteers, and those who have beenfor a long time in the regular army.Every nerson who has a relative inI the service should make it a personalduty to see that a War Record blankis filled for such person and handedto the County Historian.CATARRHAL DEAPNESS CANNOTBE CUREDBy local application, as they cannotreach the diseased portion of the ear.There is only one way to curecatarrhal deafness, and that is by aconstitutional remedy.
