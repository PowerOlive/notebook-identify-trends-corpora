A FEARLESS CONVICT A SCENE OF HORROR
STEADMANS DARING ESCAPE FROM
SAN QUENTIN PRISON
One of the Host Remarkable Cases of
Jail Breaking on Record Accomplished
by a Feat Which Almost Bordered on
the Miraculous
It is one thing to catch a thief and it
is another thing to hold him Daring a
meeting of the chiefs of police of all the
larger cities of the United States and
Canada which occurred at Milwaukee
there were reminiscences of remarkable
captures and of escapes which bordered
closely upon the miraculous
The most remarkable escape from
prison that I can recall said William
A Pinkerton was that of Frank
Steadman from the San Quentin prison
But Ill not tell you about it for here
is John Glass who caught Steadman
and sent him back to San Quentin
Chief Glass pinched the brown im
perial on his under lip reflectively for
a moment before he responded to the
looks of inquiry bent upon him by those
not familiar with the story
The escape to which you refer Pin
kerton was made after I seit Steadman
to San Quentin and not before I was
not the fortunate one to get him after
that last wonderful break And to tell
the truth I have never taken to myself
much credit for taking him the time I
did for it was to a considerable degree
a matter of good fortune You see we
were just at that time keeping our eyes
open for a bank robber by the name of
Barnes who had gone into one of the
banks out there covered the one man
who happened to be alone in the place
at the time locked hiin up in the vault
and then coolly walked out of the bank
and out of sight with all the funds he
could get his hands on
One day a man answering closely
the description we had of Barnes step
ped off the train at Los Angeles We
took him in tow at once but found
we did not have the bird we were after
However we managed to hold him
long enough to find out that he was
Frank Steadman who had become no
torious even at that time as a successful
jail breaker He had four or five escapes
from prison in southern Indiana credit
ed to him had got away from Toliet
and had still seven years to do at the
Illinois prison had also been at San
Quentin and had escaped from there
with five years unfinished
Steadman was a machinist by pro
fession and a burglar by inclination
When he was sent back to San Quentin
lish his time he was put to work
ii other convicts in the engine room
las here that an idea came into his
h that for absolute daring and fear
less was typical of the man He had
2d that every evening at the time
ien working in the engine room
lined up to be marched away the
Inery was stopped at exactly the
Eatue moruenT He had observed as well
that a window leading to an adjacent
roof was not far from the top of the big
driving belt of the engine From that
jof it was possible to reach the outer
li of the prison Beyond the wall
freedom He had escaped so many
les that his mind i everted again and
Fain to the window hjgb up on the
all of the engine uum Apparently it
ras beyond all possibility of being
reached No ladder was to be obtained
Had such a thing been even standing
in place against the wall to break
from the lino and scale it with catlike
dexterity although the work of but a
few seconds he well knew would be
futile possibly fatal Bullets travel
fastei than legs and the guards were
not bad shots But desperate deeds de
mand desperate neans Some minds
may work with an ingenuity born of
despair but Steadmans was of a differ
ent caliber His plans were the out
growth of steadfast optimism
One day there came to him as if by
inspiration the thought that the big belt
mht be the means of carrying him to
liw goal He found that it was impossi
ble to count the revolutions of the driv
ing wheel hut there were lacings in
the broad belt which he was able to
distinguish as a sort of blur as it passed
11 given point For days and days he
lourrWrt and in his cell at night he
pent his time in calculations He dis
covered the exact number cf revolutions
the wheel made per minute He learned
also by eonstant observation just hfiw
many times the belt went round after
tl engine was shut down
One evening when the line had
been formed as usual at the close of the
days work and as the big wheel began
to lose its momentum suddenly a con
vict sprang from the line leaped to the
belt with outstretched arms grappling
both edges of the broad leather He bad
calculated well the strength that would
be required for the terrific wrench did
not loosen his grasp Outward and up
ward he swung until he reached the
topmost point of the circumference The
nicety of his calculation had reaped its
reward The belt stopped He leaped to
his feet sprang through the window
and was gone before convicts or guards
had recovered frcm their astonishment
He caught up a guards coat and hat
dropped from the wall and got away in
the dusk of the evening I am inclined
to believe that as a mathematical propo
sition that was about as perfect a piece
xf work as any man ever accomplished
And did be get away without re-
ture some one asked
LNo I am almost sorry to say be did
answered the Los Angeles chief
r that ought by rights to be the de-
mient of such a story which corn-
so much of daring and cleverness I
m was taken again in a short
work at his old job
er that high window

SLAUGHTERING A CRIMINAL BY THE
GUILLOTINE IN PARIS
A Womans Description of the Shock
ins Spectacle That Always Attracts
tbe Outcasts of the French Capital
After the Faarfal Knife Has FaMen
In theso rushing times wemight take
for our motto Something New Al
ways Something New Consequently
I imagine that the impressions of a
woman at the foot of the guillotine
would not be commonplace I was pres
ent at die performance in the Place de
la Do n tte where M de Paris and his
assistants officiated in the name of so
called justice The horrible spectacle
haunts and racks the mind and tends
rather to re enforce the partisans of the
abolition of capital punishment The
horror of the punishment imposed ren
ders a guilty man almost worthy of
pity The sight of a human being
dragged like a beast to the slaughter
house up even to the sinister seesaw
is terrible
I know many people may be astonish
ed that anybody could be moved to pity
for the ferocious brute Carrara who
transformed his mushroom establish
ment into a crematory and had no mer
cy for the unfortunate young man La
marra whom he threw into the fire
after having murdered him for the pur
pose of robbery I know all that and I
do not dispute the fact that the Italian
was a monster but that is no reason
why we should not be disgusted at the
spectacle which was presented to our
eyes and which I will now endeavor to
describe with the impartiality of a sim
ple spectator without resentment or
prejudice but with a heart that revolts
against a scene that has neither the
grandeur nor the majesty of a punish
ment inflicted but rather exhibits the
cowardice and baseness of a vengeance
which hides itself from the light of day
The execution was fixed for 4 oclock
in the morning but from the hour of
midnight the neighborhood of the
Grande Roquette was swarming with
an undulating and mocking crowd
Jailbirds murderers footpad and wom
en of the streets assembled there to see
as they said the Italian animal short
ened
Journalists were admitted into the
narrow space so often described with
its five sinister stones and its legendary
gas jet which is never lighted except on
the evening before an execution
There in the rain we watched the set
ting up of that horrible machine which
according to the legend Oagliostro
showed in a glass of clear water to the
terrified Marie Antoinette In the yel
low and spectral light of the gas jet
that flickered in the wind these prepa
rations were hideous to witness Al
most on a level with the ground stands
the scaffold with its two arms in the
air brandishing the sparkling knife
And I a woman in the presence of
thTO preparations could not help think
ing of the family of the wretch whose
head was soon to fall into the basket I
thought of his little children who were
at that moment sleeping soundly some
where and of his wife equally guilty
with him and who as it were pushed
her husband into the arms of the execu
tioner as a last resort to save herself
What remorse will be hers when they
tell her abruptly Carrara has suffered
his punishment You are a widow
But the day was dawning and the
lamps were going out At the windows
and even on the roofs numbers of spec
tators were gathered as if to witness
some carnival The sight was heart
rending Mounted gendarmes and sol
diers gradually came out of the dark
ness and one might be inclined to rail
at such a display of force at tho execu
tion of a wretch paralyzed by fear who
in a few moments would appear upon
the scene tied hand and foot
There was some little commotion
among the crowd when people began to
point at a Chin old man who hobbled
about with the gestures of a dancing
jack to see if the knife in the brass run
ners was in good working order This
was Dei bier the executioner a ghost
with a white beard who adjusted the
instrument with the indifference of a
grocer weighing his goods Suddenly
there was profound silence the rain
was over heads were uncovered and
motionless Breathless and almost in
agony the crowd followed with staring
eyes the movement of the doors of the
prison which at last opened wide
A suppressed Ah came from many
contracted chests while with pale faces
all gazed upon the assassin whose
crime the mountebanks of tbe fairs pop
ularized He was simply frightful to
look at bowed down as he was with
terror He did not look like a human
being He looked like a beast His in
telligence was already dead and his
heart had lost all feeling The instinct
of the animal still remained The sight
was dreadfully sad
What followed beggars description
The executioner and his aids seemed no
longer to be men employed to carry out
tbe ends of justice they looked like
butchers They seized the condemned
man some by the ears some by the
legs while others held down the center
of the body and kept holding him up to
the very moment when with a sudden
rumble the knife fell the head re
bounded into the basket and the abomi
nation was at an end
But one should be present and seethe
pavements cohered with blood the gory
knife the blood sparring from the de
capitated trunk the ignominious wash
ing at tbevnearby fountain and the gut
ters rolling to the sewer a purple color
ed mud in order to be able to compre
hend all the horrors of an execution in
