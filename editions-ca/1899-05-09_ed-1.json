p ij demonstrates its suDerioritv over other
blood remedies It matters not how ob
stinate the case nor what other treat
ment or remedies have failed S S R
always promptly reaches and cures any
disease where the blood is in any way involved
EverVOne Who has hurt OTnonanna nrifVi
blood diseases knows that there are no ail
ments or troubles so obstinate and difficult to cure Very few remedies claim
to cure such real deep seated blood
diseases as 8 S S cures and none can
offer such incontrovertible evidence of merit S S S is not merely a tonic it
is a cure It goes down to the very seat of all blood diseases and gets at the
foundation of the very worst cases and routs the poison from the system Itdoes
not like other remedies dry up the poison and hide it from view temporarily
only to break forth again more violently than ever 8 S S forces out every
trace of taint and rids the system of it forever
jurs j w lee Montgomery Ala writes Some years
ago I was inoculated with poison by a nurse who infected
my babe with blood taint I was covered with sores and
ulcers from head to foot and in my great extremity I prayed
to die Several prominent physicians treated me but all
to no purpose The mercury and potash which they
gave me seemed to add fuel to the awful flame which was
devouring me I was advised by friends who had seen
wonderful cures made by it to try Swifts Specific I im
proved from the start as the medicine seemed to go direct
to the cause of the trouble and force the poison out Twenty
ooiues cured me completely Swifts tjpecinc

mercury potash arsenic or any other mineral or chemical It never fails to
