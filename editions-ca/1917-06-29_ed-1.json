orate in the national colors and make

of the parade has not been arranged
yet. See next issues for further par
ticulars. This is a season that calls for
patriotism. It has been proposed
that the citizens of Millersburg build
a stage in the Park for the purpose of
holding patriotic concerts once or
twice a week during the summer
months. We can get together there
and sing patriotic songs. The young
people of the town and community
will organize an orchestra for the
.purpose of rendering partiotic mu
sic, which will keen alive our zeal
and partiotism. This can be done at
a very small expenso, and, under th
circumstances, it will be money well
spent. Let's think about it and get
busy. For further particulars, call

here Sunday. The Chautauqua will
open under the most brilliant circum
stances. William Jennings Bryan
will deliver the lecture in the after
noon, his subject being, "The Full
Rounded Man." The very mention
of the name of Bryan ought to be
enough to insure a large audience.
Let everybody come If you have
heard him before you want to hear
him again. If you have never heard
him, this is your great opportunity.
Take advantage of it. It may never
come your way again. We hope to
put on the best Chautauqua this year
of the number.
In a second review of Mr. J. G.
Allen's past life we failed to mention
that at the time he was made cashier
.of the Millersburg Deposit Bank, af
ter the death of his predecessor, Dr.
A. G. Stitt, the business was operat
ed in a small building on the north
east corner of Sixth and Main
streets, which was originally built by
Dr. Stitt as an office. The, same lot
is now occupied by the handsome!
home of Dr. J. D. Calhoun. Dr. Stitt
conducted the Depoalt Bank here for
more than twenty years. When Mr.
Allen was made, cashier he went out
for business, and in a short time this
little unsightly building was inada
quate for the new l.usiness he had
created.
The bank was then moved to the
property of the I. O. 0. F. Lodge, now
occupied by the Hurst Home Insur
ance office. This building was re
modeled and fitted up with neat fur
niture for the purpose and was
thought adequate for the needs of the
"bank. After the Deposit Bank went
out of business and the Farmers
Bank created, of which Mr. Allen
was president, about 1909, the bank
desired to own a building of their
own. They purchased the property
rom the heirs of the late Mrs. Addie
Smiih, which at the time was partly
occupied by the postoffice. The build
ing was practically rebuilt, the post
office was moved from the corner
rooms to rooms south of it, and the
corner room with convenient direc
tors' room, was remodeled with hand
some finishing, which made the bank
one of the nicest, most convenient
bank buildings in Central Kentucky.
The bank remodeled the entire build
ing, which is their property. The
Bourbon Home Telephone Company
occupies the entire second floor.
All of these changes were due to
the untiring efforts of Mr. J. G.
Allen, who did everything well. He
entered into every enterprise with
his whole soul and never undertook
anything in which he failed in his
accomplishment. He has been the
benefactor in many ways of more
people than perhaps any one man in
Central Kentucky. One of the joys
of his life was to serve others, and to
do what he could for their good. This
he practiced from the time he enter
ed public life to his death. His place
will be hard to fill.

MAY CURE BRIGHT'S DISEASE.
(New York Times.)
A possible cure for Bright's dis
ease, held to be incurable ever since
its discovery 100 years ago, was a
hope expressed in a paper by Dr.
Albert A. Epstein, of New York, read
before the section on the practice of
medicine of the American Medical
Association at the Hotel Biltmore
recently. Dr. Epstein's rather revo
lutionary methods of treating the
disease were received with deep in
terest. Dr. Epstein voiced the belief
that Bright's disease was not primar
ily an affection of the kidneys, but,
from his experience with 193 cases,
he believed that the disease repre
sented a general constitutional dis
turbance due to changes in the
blood.
He reversed many of the old treat
ments for Bright's disease. Instead
of limiting the amount of protein
consumed by the patient he adminis
tered a high portein diet with bene
ficial results, the object being pri
marily to overcome the bad condition
of the blood. He said that no evi
dence is possessed by physicians
showing that portein food is delete
rious to the kidneys. He then told of
using blood transfusion to improve
the condition of the blood of the
patient.

STORAGE PLANTS FULL.
A statement saying every availa
ble cold storage place in New York
is full to capacity, and charging
that retailers are maintaining high
prices in spite of abundance of food,
has been issued by Joseph Hartigan,
Commissioner of Weights and Meas
ures. "Butter, cheese and eggs have come
into New York in such quantities as
to cause a glut in the market," he
added. "It is the first experience of
the kind enjoyed by the wholesale
trade."
DEATHS.
MITCHELL.
The funeral of Mr. William Har
rison Mitchell, aged eighty-one, who
died at the home of his daughter Mrs.
Lawrence Vanhook, on Higgins
avenue, in this city, Monday, was
held at the residence of Mrs. Van
hook at three o'clock, Tuesday after
noon, with services conducted by
Rev. Dr. O. R. Mangum, pastor of the
Paris Baptist church. The burial
followed in the Paris cemetery.
Mr. Mitchell .was born on Febru
ary 10, 1836, and, until a few years
ago, he had been engaged in farm
ing. After the death of his wife,
which was caused by an elevator ac
cident in the big pickling plant of
Heintz Bros., in Buffalo, New York,
and when the feebleness of old age
made him retire from active life, he
came to Paris, and made his home
with his daughter, Mrs. Vanhook:
REMINGTON.
Mr. James A. Remington, aged
seventy-seven, a well-known and
highly respected resident of Cynthi
ana, died at his home in that city at
four o'clock, Tuesday morning. Mr.
Remington had been an invalid for
the past ten years from the effects of
a stroke of paralysis. He was a

Mr. Remington was a son of the

beautiful home of the dead.

NOT A WOMAN.
It was the original intention of Guy
McConnell, author of "Pearl of the
Army" to have a woman play the
role of "The Silent Menace," in
Pathe's military-mystery serial, the
first episode of which opens at the
Alamo Theatre this afternoon. "It
can't be done," said George B. Seitz,
the scenario writer, who is a married
man. The part is being played by a
man.

HSH-SEIN LEATHER.
In a few years we may' be walking
in fish-skin shoes, riding in automo
biles upholstered in fish-skin, and
stropping our razors on fish-skin
strops. The Federal Bureau of Fish
eries is working on the manufacture
of leather from the skins of many
different fish. Several tanners have
reported the development of success
ful processes for tanning the fish
skins. At the Bureau they have
specimens of shark-skin leather that
is almost the exact counterpart of a
leather made from high-grade beef
hide. Other fish whose skins have
been successfully tanned are the cod,
the salmon, the sting-ray and the
porpoise.
