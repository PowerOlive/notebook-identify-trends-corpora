"UNCLE BILL" .SCHOOLER
IN GAME AGAIN.
GETSltf
That it is a hard matter for a news
paper man to -remain entirely away
from, the profession in which he has
spent so many years is again evi
denced by the re-entry into the game
of "Uncle Bill" Schooler, veteran
newspaper man, well-known all over
Kentucky.
This time "Uncle Bill" looms up
in the far West. He had for some
time been connected with the Somer
set News. Leaving there he is now
associated in the management and
editing of the Daily Twin Falls
Times, published at Twin Falls,
Idaho. Mr. Schooler succeeded a for
mer member of the editorial staff,
Mr. Merlin Batley, who has entered
the service of Uncle Saan in the army.'
The Times pays a very handsome
compliment to "Uncle BUI" in writ
ing of his coming to Twin Falls,
stating in part:
" 'Uncle Bill' Schooler, as he has
been universally known- in his for
mer fields of labor, did not come to
Twin Falls to learn the newspaper
game! He came to play it! He has
now been in the business nearly forty
years and in all capacities from
'devil' to publisher and proprietor.
1 "Mr. Schooler is a Kentuckian, a
gentleman and a 'good mixer;' and
the Times confidently expects to re
ceive from the Twin Falls public,
after acquaintance shall have been
developed, more credit for bringing
him here ihn anything else it has
been able to do up to the present
hour."
