CountryWashington July 31 Under the direction of Secretary of AgricultureWilson Chief Moore of the weatherbureau has made public a statementin regard to the climate of AlaskaIn this statement Mr Moore saysThe climates of the coast and the interior of Alaska fcre unlike in manyrespects and the differences are intensified in this as perhaps in few othercountries by exceptional physical conditions The fringe of islands thatseparates the main land from the Pacific ocean from Dixon sound northward and also a strip of themain land for possibly twentymiles back from the sea followingthe sweep of the coast as it curves tothe northwestward to the western extremity of Alaska form a distinctclimatic division which may be termedtemperate Alaska The temperaturerarely falls to zero winter does notset in until December 1 and by thelast of May the snow has disappearedexcept on the mountainsThe mean winter temperature ofSitka is 325 but little less than that ofWashington D CThe rainfall of temperate Alaska isnotorious the world over not only asregards the quantity that falls butalso as to the manner of its fallingviz In long and incessant rains anddrizzles Cloud and fog naturallyabound there being on an average but00 clear days in a yearNorth of the Aleutian islands thecoast climate becomes more rigorousin winter but in summer the difference is much less markedThe climate of the interior includingin that designation practically ail ofthe country except a narrow fringe ofcoastal uiargiu and the territory before referred to as temperate Alaskais one of extreme rigor in winter witha brief but relatively hot summerespecially when the sky is free fromcloud In the Klondyke region in midwinter the sun rises from 930 to 10a mf and sets from 2 to 3 p m thetotal length of daylight being aboutfour hours Remembering that thesun rises but a few degrees above thehorizpn and that it is wholly obscuredon a great many days the characterof the winter months may easily beimaginedWe are indebted to the United Statescoast and geodetic survey for a seriesof six months observations on theYukon not far from the site of thepresent gold discoveries The observations were made with standard instruments and are wholly reliableThe mean temperatures of the mouthsof October 1839 to April 1S90 both inclusive are as followsOctober 33 degrees November 8 degrees December 11 degrees below zeroJanuar 17 below zero February labelow zero March 6abovezero April20 above zeroThe daily mean temperature fell andremained below the freezing point 2degrees from November 4 1SS9 toApril 21 1S90 thus giving 10S days asthe length of the closed season of 18S990 assuming that outdoor operationsarc controlled by temperature onlyThe lowest temperatures registeredduring the winter were Thirty twodegrees below zero in November 47below in December HO below in January 55 below in February 45 below inMarch and 20 below in AprilThe greatest continuous cold occurred in February 1S90 when the dailymean for five consecutive days was 47degrees below zeroGreater cold than that here notedhas been experienced in the UnitedStates for a very short time but neverhas it continued so very cold for solong a time In the interior of Alaskathe winter sets in as early as September when snow storms may be expected in the mountains and passesHeadway during one of these stormsis impossible and the traveler who isovertaken by one of them is indeedfortunate if he escapes with his lifeSnow storms of great severity may occur in any month from September toMay inclusiveThe changes of temperature fromwinter to summer are rrpid owing tothe great increase in the length of theday In May the sun rises at about 3a m and sets about 9 p m In Juneit rises about 130 in the morning andsets at about 1030 p m giving about20 hours of daylight and diffuse twilight the remainder of the timeThe mean summer temperature inthe interior doubtless ranges betweenGO and 70 degrees according to elevation being

making the boundaryline between Alaska and the Britishpossessions along the one hundred andforty first meridiau until the senatepasses upon the boundary treaty nowbefore it There is however no doubtof the location of the line along thismeridian and most people in the localityknow where it is The demarcationwork was superintended by Gen Duffield superintendent of the coast andgeodetic survey on behalf of the UnitedStates Gen Duffield has spent considerable time in Alaska He expressesthe opinion that a railroad can easilybe constructed from Taku inlet to theKlondyke gold fields and believes thatthe enterprise will be worth undertaking because of the richness of theminesThe gold said Gen Dutlield indiscussing the question has beenground out of the quartz by the pressure of the glaciers which lie and movealong the courses of the streams exerting a tremendous pressure Thisforce is present to a more appreciableextent in Alaska than elsewhere andI believe that as a consequence moreplacer gold will be found in thatregion than in any other part of theworldGen Duffield thinks the gold hunters on the American side of the lintshave made the mistake of prospectingthe large streams instead of the smallonesWhen gold is precipitated he saidit sinks It does not float far downthe stream It is therefore to belooked for along the small creeks andabout the headwaters of the

as in typhoid thatthe digestive tract is the seatof abundant baccilli coli but he doesnot associate these with real yellowfever microbe He concludes therefore that the virus of yellow feverdoes not

the stories of Californias golden periodAs far back as I860 a deposit of goldwas found in the basin of the Yukon bysi prospector named George Holt Healso reported the finding of coarsespecimens along the Hootalinqua riverBut it was the discovery of gold nearSitka in 1873 followed by the finds inthe vicinity of Juneau in 1880 that drewattention to the possibilities of thenewly acquired territory of Alaska asa gold producing country The greatabundance of gold was first made knownby Joseph Juneau who prospected inthe region around the city bearing hisname in 1S85 mining prospectors began to scatter themselves along theIRivers Pelly and Hootalinqua and inthe year following much mention wasmade of the Stewart river as a field forthe enterprising gold hunter Richstrikes were made in 1892 by prospectors along Miller creek a tributary ofSixty Mile creek The progress made infinding gold along the Alaskan andBritish Columbian rivers although giving high promise of future discoveriesof gold was not followed by anythingwhich created a widespread adventurous spirit among people who were outBide the mining regionThe Klondyke and its aptly namedgolden tributaries the Bonanza and thelEldorado

father James Duncan tapped at thedoor of his guests room that night justas Thorndyke had begun a letter to hismotherCome in said Philip pushing asidehis writing materialsDuncan entered and after beatingcautiously about among indifferenttopics for a few moments came warilyto th object of his visitElsies been tellin me yere a bit ofa lawyer Mr Thorndyke he said byway of beginningYes I have read law in the schoolsNoo thats varra singular remarked Duncan thoughtfully much asif Philip had asserted that he was ahigh caste Brahmin verra singularbut then it may be no so inopportuneafter a Would ye min tellin me noowhat for ye cam to study the lawChiefly because my father wished itIt was his professionOw aye said Duncan rubbing hischin and relapsing into a silence wrhichseemed to indicate that he had come tothe end of his introductory resourcesPhilip thought to help him along byasking if there were need for legal ada ice in the affairs of the familyNa na its no just that but theresas one may say a frien o the familywha wouldna be the waur for a wee bito that same Im thinkin Elsies beenclaverin aboot it when ye was oweryonShe told me about the troubles ofyour old friend Kilgrow and I offeredto help him if I could Was that whatyou meantAye said Duncan and as he showedno disposition to be more explicitPhilip continuedIf I am to act as attorney for yourfriend it is needful that I should knowall the facts Are you prepared to givethemDuncan was evidently making a conscientious effort toward frankness butwith such meager results that Thorndyke was finally compelled to exact thedesired information piecemeal as froman unwilling witness After getting theoutline of Elsies story verified he proceeded to particularsHow long had Kilgrow owned theland when he took Cates as a tenantIm no verra clear upo that pointbut its a matter o 20 year or more asI ken myselWas his title clearI think theres na doubt aboot thatWhats the name of this countyChilmathnd Allacoochee is the county seatAAyeDoes this farm of Kilgrows lie wholly within the limits of the new town1 canna say as to the preceese leemits Im thinkin itll tak in aboot halfthe townI suppose no one knows anythingabout the exact nature of the transaction between the town company andCatesNaething mair than that Cates gota thousand dollars on the nailWas that a fair price for the land atthe timeNa it wasna mair than half priceThorndyke made a note of thisThats our starting point You knewCates what kind of a man was heWould he be likely to sell anything athalf price of his own accordNa that he wouldna he was a cannychiel an ower fond o the main chanceThen there was probably some pressure brought to bear upon him Nowwhat do you know about the town company people Who made the deal withCatesA lawyer by the name of Sharplessan the agent Master tfenkins FenchOho said Philip recalling his martyrdom on the train That fellow wasin it was he lies a rascal if ever therewas one out of jail If his face doesntbelie him hes equal to anything in theway of fraud How about his partnerThe lawyer Im thinkin hes a dealwaur than totherIt isnt very likely that they boughtthe land without knowing all about theflaw in the title unless theres beenmore crookedness than we know aboutIs Kilgrow sure that he never signedany papers for Cates or anyone elseHes verra will in to tak his oathupo that an its the mair unlikesin he canna read or writertAnd you say Cates got his moneyand then disappearedAyeThat adds a little to the suspiciouslook of the thing but then its freeTHE JBOXJEBOK NEWS TTJJBSDAY AUGUSTScountry I suppose a man may go orstay as he pleases aThorndyke locked his fingers behindhis head and sat back with half -closedeves while he went over the facts againj weighing each point in turn -Duncanmisunderstood his silence ana grew uneasyIm thinkin yell be countin the costo the leetigation Mr Thorndyke Iml no that weel ablerMake yourself easy on that pointMr Duncan interrupted Philip Iwasnt thinking of demanding a retainer Well try to make the other sidedo the paying when the timecomes Inthe meanwhile if I take hold of thecase itll be merely out of friendshipto you and because I need something todo What I was thinking of just nowwas the chance of our being able toprove collusion between the town company and Cates If we cant do that wemay have our labor for our painsAyeYes Cates is well out of the country and anyway I suppose he hasjiothing No weve got to recover from thetown companr and in order to do thatwe must be prepared to prove that itsagent knew of the fraud when hebought the land Then it would be aplain case in equity and no chancellorwould hesitate about issuing a writ ofpossessionWould Keelgrow hae to show himsel in courtNot The evidence inchancery cases is taken by depositionand there is no formal trial as in common law procedures the chancellor examines the evidence and hands down adecree in accordance with the factsThats ane thing in our favor thenKeelgrow is that fearsome o courts anconstables that Im thinkin wed haemuckle trouble persuadin him to testifyThorndyke laughed I suppose hehasnt got over the apple brandy scareThatll never be revived and if it werewe could easily clear himDuncan shook his head doubtfullyI winna be so sure o that Its na mairthan a month sin I got word that therevenue men were speerin round afteraula Johnnie againThorndyke came out of his nonchalance with a boundYou did Who told you thatI had a bit writing frae some mercifu body in the townMr Duncan thats the most important thing youve told me yet Findme that letter if you canPhilip walked the floor excitedly until Duncan came back with the missivein question It was written in typewriting on a blank letterhead and itwas dated at AllacoocheeDear Sir It is known that you arefriendly toward an old mountaineer namedKilgrow who is wanted by the UnitedStates officers for a breach of the revenuelaws It is rumored here that the officershave information of his whereabouts andthat if found he will be arrested andbrought to trial It would seem to one whoknows the circumstances to be merely anact of common humanity to warn the oldman A FRIENDWhat do ye make out o that MrThorndyke asked Duncan afterPhilip had read and examined the letterJust what I expected when you mentioned it Theres only one man or oneset of men who could be benefited bygetting Kilgrow out of the way Whenwe trace this letter to its source wellfind that either Sharpless or Fench dictated it Its the most important bit ofevidence Ive had so far because if Imright it proves that Sharpless and Fenchare not innocent The next thing inorder is for me to have a talk with Kilgrow 3oull have to see him and smooththe way for meDuncan promised and bade his guestgood night after which Thorndykewent to bed to dream of endless lawsuits and interminable weddings inwhich Helen and Kilgrow James Duncan and Elsie were confounded in hopeless confusion And for a grotesquebackground the scenes of his dreamshad for a stage setting the new city ofAllacoochee rising and spreading likeanother flood until the waves of buildings surged up the valley and over themountain to tumble in a cascade ofbricks and mortar into the quiet depthsof the Devils PocketXFOR GOOD OR ILLIn offering to fight the battle for theold mountaineer Thorndyke had reckoned without his host in one very important particular When he awokefrom a troifbled sleep on the morningfollowing the talk with Duncan he wastoo ill to get up and he was still in bedwhen the farmer came to call him tobreakfastI feel as if Id been brayed in a mortar he said in reply to Duncans inquiries 1 suppose it was the longtramp yesterday I ought to have hadmore sense than to try itNa na then said Duncan

sitting room Elsie had been reproaching herself all the morning forher part in the imprudent excursion ofthe day before and when the invalidcame down she installed herself at onceas his nurse and companion Philip wasmade comfortable upon the lounge andwhen he was tucked in with rugs andpropped to the exact angle of restfulease with pillows the girl ransacked theancient bookcase for something

tell you how exactingI can be though I say its chiefly herfault for not letting me shift for myselfElsie held her peace for a momentand then asked Does your motherknow what you told me yesterdayAbout my health NoDont you think it was cruel not totell herNo Why should I add months ofsuspense to a sorrow that will be longenough and bitter enough at the bestShe wont look at it that way andif the sorrow comes it will be all theharder to bear for not having knownAnd thats at least one good reason whyyou shouldnt give up you know yousaid you hadnt any yesterdayDid I Perhaps I should have madean exception but I was thinking ofether things just thenWhereupon the other things summoned by name came back to demand areconsideration Philip resisted interposing the inertia of illness betweenhimself

stepping stones to cany3ou across to where 3ou can feel thesolid ground under 3our feet againThere was a swift undertow of inference in her question that carriedhim quickly out into the sea of impulse

could win some of the betterthings if I should gird myself for thebattleSurely 3 011 could What is therethat you couldnt win with health andstrength and the will to win it nothing that is worth havingThe fervor of her own appeal carriedElsie out of herself and remembering only that a man before her neededhelp she answered out of the depthsof a compassion which was as profoundand comprehensive as it was impersonal She saw as only a woman cansee the besctmonts that were dragging Philip down into the quagmireof despair and the passionate desireto rescue speaking in her voice

unconscious graspedhad never been offered to Helen saveat the moment of parting when Philipsabruptness had forestalled it It wasinevitable therefore with Elsies wordsringing in his ears and with the consciousness that he had been permittedto see the light of that sanctuary whichis closed to all but the suffering anddespairing that Philip should be sweptfar be3rond the bounds 5f his allegianceto Helen and since he was a man itwas equally inevitable that he shouldbe unable to dissociate the offer of helpfrom the personal of the woman whotendered it Raising himself amongthe pillows he answered

would take people -afterbreakfast in Washington and getthem to New York for supper The ideaof covering over 200 miles in this timewas of course preposterous and hewas the butt of many a joke But whenthe rails were finally laid which wasnot so many years ago the passengerssoon began to want more speed andthus it has gone on Americans acceptinventions as marvels for a whole daysometimes and then demand moreSome people have been known to complain of the telephoneBut the locomotive has been a faith- Jful old friend Locomotive Engineer-ing goes so far as to say it was alwa3skept equal to an3 speed requirements v iput upon it and that the only ob-stacles to fast trains a half century agowere the tracks and the lack of signalsand the absence of efficient means ofstopping the trains How human thissounds If we only had the right sortof tracks the proper warnings and thepower to stop how many of us wouldarrive at our destinations in time to supon success and prosper- instead ofgetting sidetracked or wreckedIt is a fact however that the locomotive has kept strictly up wTith thetimes and few of us care to travelfaster than on the limited trains thatallow us to break our fast in Washington and take our luncheon in New Yorka beggarly five hours of smooth motion that could easily be reduced tofour if the railroads wanted to do itBut the faithful old puller var3ingj insize from the shifting if not shiftlessbusybody that puffs around stations tothe marvelous machine of a hundredtons is reading the handwriting alongits tracks The electrical motor dump3and ugly it preparing to

Percy paused impressively Myrasat up straight decidedly interestedIll postpone my nap go rightahead she urgedWell you know we hear a good dealof good advice about entertaining ourvisitors making them feel at homeaind all that Good idea too I believein it but wheres the other side of thequestion I dont believe you realizedthere was another side Me either asJacky boyd say That is I didnt tillCousin Hortensia came and lived it outbefore 1113 very eyes the dear old soulShe taught me a good man- thingsbut to stick to my text How shall weentertain our hostesses when wea visiting you and IMercy I I thoughtones to be entertainedSOwe were thethenclaimed MyraNaturally Thats because you are3 et in the darkness of well well callit ignorance my dear It mightnt bepolite to call it anything so dreadfulhad Cousin Horas egotism If youdtensia for a guest three beautiful weeksyoud be a wiser woman Youd knowthat the guest herself has somethingto do besides being entertained Shehas her hostess to think about and entertain How Why by being easilyentertained herself thats one vay Bybeing thoughtful of her hostess thatsanother By remembering that she ishurried and anxious and troubled aboutdesserts soups and suppers She maybe without help in her work instancemyself and nearty beside herselfEometimes with keeping things running company fashionNow jnst suppose the guest to beone of those languid indigestible yesthats just the word I want personswho toy gracefully with their forks andsay no I thank you to most of theuVintydishesyouve taken so much timeend pains goodness me to get tipfor them The I G indigestible guestyou know nibbles a bite here and abite there and mostly doesnt evennibble Havent you seen just such IGs many the time Havent you hadthe worst kind of internal fidgets tosee your pet pudding slighted and onlya feeble mouthful or two of your beloved cheesed macaroni eaten Andhavent you ached to think of the mealsand meals still to be planned andcookedMrs Percy stopped to take a longbreath Her rocker creaked with honest indignation and her fair cheekswere quite flushedHavent I though cried Myrawarmly Didnt I ache and fidget justso the very last month that ever waswhen well somebody visited me Nonames mentioned But oh dear isntit a tug thoughThen you know that kind of a visitor Then let me introduce Cousin Hortensia Shes the other kind blessingson her Maybe shes an old maid andhomely and maybe her sleeves dontballoon much but shes the model guestfor me And she had a good time herself too I verily do believe as goodas 1 nauWhat did she do Well some of itwas what she didnt do She didntsay now do let me help you with thedishes I can as well as hot and waittill you saui no indeed and then gooff resignedly Of course youd sayno indeed But Cousin Hortensiaquietly possessed herself of the wipersand clattered away over the tumblersand cups as if it was the most ordinarything in the world to do IAt the very first when she saw itembarrassed me she didnt say muchabout helping she just waited till wegot acquainted a bit and then did itwithout any sayingBut best of all to me she seemedto relish my vittles as old Aunt Pamele would sav That was such a comfort Why it took away all the troubleand harship of fussing and stewing andbrewing It was a perfect delight tocook nice things for Cousin HortensiaShe took right holt an eat em up according to Aunt Pamele again She appreciated them and liked them Itwarmed the cockles of my heart to seemy dainty desserts being enjoyedEnough to warm anybodys cocklesmurmured MyraIf all the guests were Cousin Hortensias in that respect continue MrsPercy thoughtfully how it would Ibelpthe hostessAmen murmured Myra igainShe got up slowly and stood beforeMrs making her a little sweeping bowIts been a beautiful speech mydear she said it ought to be in printWell its commonsenseful enoughto be printed anyhow if thats all Andof course you see the moral MyraI should say so Moral Eat whatsset before you now do for consciencesake Mrs Percy laughed a littleThats the gist of it I guess so farBut that was only one of the waysiffILL POSTPONE IMY NAPCousin Hortensia entertained meliked the places we went

wondering what in the worldI could think of next to interest herpictures books whatCousin Hortensia just settled quietly down amongst us as if she were athome and did her own entertainingThere wasnt a minute that she lookedbored or unentertained She found somuch to interest her and seemed sohapp3 all the time that I hadnt a qualmof uneasiness about her I threw caretothewinds and was happy too

Free Press vTHE BOUEBON NEWS TUESDAY AUGUST 3 1897SheLIGHT REFLECTED BY FIREFLIESIts Exast Source and Power the Subject of Recent InvestigationsProf Muraoka of Tokio has givenfurther details concerning his interesting investigation of the luminous radiations emitted by fireflies It haslong been believed by many workers onlight and especially on phosphorescentlight that in the glow worm and thefirefly nature has indicated the truesolution of the problem of producingFight without heat and Prof Muraokasdiscoveries seem to lead to new phasesof the subject His inquiries were suggested to him by the resemblance ofthe light of fireflies to the fluorescentbodies some of which have been shownby H Becquerel to emit radiations possessing properties analagous to thoseof the Roentgen rays The experiments were made by placing a numberof flies varying from 300 to upward of1000 in a small flat box in which theywere confined under a net made of hempThe box also contained a photographicdry plate in contact with which wereplates of various metals copperaluminium zinc and brass all of similar thickness sheets of cardboardboth entire and also with cruciformpatterns cut out of them These weresometimes interposed between the sensitive plate and the metal and sometimes used alone with the sensitiveplate Thin wooden boards were alsoemployed for the same purpose Thesensitive plate and the objects in contact with it were wrapped in severalthicknesses of black paper and left inthe box with the flies for two nightsThe experiments were made in a photographic darkroom sunlight and artificial light being carefully excludedThe sensitive plates though thuswrapped up and additionally protectedby metallic plates and layers of -cardboardgutta percha cloth silk etcwere always more or less blackenedProf Muraokas experiments led to thefollowing conclusions First the lightof the flies in its original state behaveslike ordinary light second the light-contains rays which pass through cardboard metal plates etc and possessproperties analagous to those -of Roentgens rays or BecquereFs fluorescentrays third when the photographicplate is covered with layers of cardboard it presents an appearance whichcalls to mind the permeability of ironto magnetic lines of force fourth the- or xnese nitereaproperties rays appear to be influenced by the materialsthrough which they liave passed perhaps by the thickness of the materialsfifth the properties possessed by theradiations and specified under ISToore apparently nonexistent or at leasttmdiscoverable until after filtrationThe Roentgen rays are similarly undiscovered until after filtrationi e through the glass of theCroolces tubes and filtration mayperhaps afford a means of rendering the X rays homogeneousSixth the filtered firefly rajs undoubtedly admit of reflection Refractioninterference and polarization could notbe demonstrated but Prof Muraokais of the opinion that they took placeSeventh the filtered firefly rays seemto resemble Bucquerels fluorescentrays in possessing- properties intermediate between the ultraviolet raysand the Roentgen rays Atlanta ConstitutionBOERS ARE NOT TEETOTALERSSoutlt Africans Takea XlttleJ

G C Tof the South African Good Templarsof Cape Town to Tennyson Smithfounder of the Temperance Ironsidesmovement in England the attitude assumed by the leading- South Africanchurches toward teetotalism is not particularly sympathetic It appears fromthe letter that the synod of the principalDutch Reformed church in South Africa passed a resolution some time agoto the effect that it is lawful for a Christian to make wine and brandy from theproduce of his vineyard and to employthe profits gained thereby for thechurch Another branch of the DutchReformed church in South Africa goesfurther for in March last its synodpassed the following declarationThe synod decides that members whounite themselves with teetotal societiesbecome unfaithful to their membership in the Gereformeerde kerk andmust be repeatedly and earnestlywarned and if they will not heed aftermany warnings they must be treatedin accordance with article 21 of oursynodical rules that is to be cut
