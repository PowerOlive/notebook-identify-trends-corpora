IOLATION OF GAME

CONSTITUTION
INVALID
Matt S. Cohen, the well-known sad
dle horse trainer and livestock claim
agent for the L. & N. railroad, was
arrested in Lexington, Tuesday, on a
charge of violating the game laws by
sending quail from Kentucky to
Ohio. Mr. Cohen gave himself up to
Sheriff C. Bradley when he heard
Miere was a warrant for his arrest.
About five weeks ago Mr. Cohen sent
some quail from Glasgow, Ky., to Mr.
Brent Arnold, general freight agent
for the L. & N. at Cincinnati, and the
package was inspected en route by
game authorities, and a warrant was
sworn out for Mr. Cohen's arrest.
He was released on his own recognizance.
The tides are- very cleverly made
to do the work of reclaiming land
and building up farms along some of
the rivers in the northeast bf Eng
land. Describing this practice of
"warping" to the Royal Agricultural
Society, J. Stephenson states that ar
tificial channels with sluice gates are
provided, and twice a day, at flood
tide, the waters carry inland a heavy
load of "warp," or mud, to deposit
on the low-lying swales. The land
is made suitable for agriculture in
two or three years, bding raised sev
eral feet, when the flooding is discontinued.
Most of the widows of Paris, are
remarried within eighteen months of
their first bereavement.

The Court of Appeals Wednesday
morning affirmed the Frankiln Coun
ty Circuit Court, holding the Consti
tutional amendments, permitting the
classification of property for the pur
pose of taxation, and the amendment
for working convicts on the public
roads, to be invalid.
The amendments, which were
i voted on at the last election, were at
tacked by George C. Speer on the
ground that they had not been adver-1
tised as provided by the constitution
ninety days before the election,
and his contention was upheld by
Judge jStout.
i This opinion was affirmed by the
Appellate Court Wednesday.
Secretary of State Crecilius, whose
duty it was to advertise the amend
ments ninety days before election,
failed to advertise them until sixty
days before the election. He certified
the amendments to go on the ballot,
however, and they carried 20 to 1.
A friendly suit was brought to test
the law. The AnpeUate Court savs
the constitution fixed the time for ad
vertisement, and left only the manner
of publication to the Legislature.
The Court holds that the provision
of the constitution is mandatory,
and should be carried out to the letter.
"To say that the words of the. con- i
stitution are directory and not man-l
datory is to license a violation of the
instrument every day and every
hour," says the Court.

RAILROAD MEN MAY
LOSE THEIR JOBS
The Winchester Sun says: Rail
road men doing construction -work
in and near this county on the L. &
N. have teen somewhat doubtful ag
to the permanency of their positions,
following the announcement made a
few days ago by President Milton H.
Smith that construction work on the
L. & N. was to be practically stopped
in the near future.
"Although the men loiow they will
be kept on for several months yet,
until the new line to Irvine is com
pleted, the "announcement has caused
quite a lot of talk and apprehension,
among the men directly concerned."
During one year a million asd a
