The drive is to be conducted bythe county chairmen who so successfully put over the signing up of75 per cent of the burley crop of1920, one of the requirements for thesuccess of the cooperative marketingagreement under which members ofthe association have been deliveringtheir 1921 crop of tobacco to warehouses controlled by the associationand receiving cash advances on thiscrop for the past four weeks."Within the- past two weeks,".Colonel Passonneau said, "we havereceived 216 contracts, representingabout 500.000 nounds nf tnhnomany of them voluntarily signed bytobacco growers as soon as theylearned that the opportunity wouldbe given for those who had soldtheir 1921 crop outside the association to join it. We have felt thatthis comparatively large number of,contracts indicated that there are aconsiderable number of growers who,for one reason or another, remainedoutside the organization last fall, butnow want to come in and that theyshould have the opportunity."Therefore, it has been decidedthat the old county chairmen, whoso successfully led the campaignlast fall, shall conduct a drive theweek of March 13, calling uponevery grower outside the organization to sign the contract 'and thuspresent a solid front on the part ofthe growers in the heart of the burley district of the United States, consisting of the hurley-producing counties of Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana."TV-jt&fc4"Hs.hsljIfMil1ft l1,iff ,IWir..(Hi WHi-H1 (?'.!I: t.iInvwu4kH1',ilH(VIt-p mxmt.J.f-PAGE TWOTflE BOURBON NEWS, PARIS, KENTUCKYTUEDAY, FEBRUARY 2S,122.T Clean Leather.Wkite of egg is splendid for reno-1 '-Tfating leather chairs when they begint look shabby.

This would indicate that some people have been!doing some high profiteering in the jipast, but have been forced to comeidown to the earth again in order to(break the buying streak, that hasbeen playing havoc through 'thecountry.We have not heard of many ofthese stupendous drops in prices inthe country stores, and especially inthe stores in Paris, and this for thebest of reasons. The average countrymerchant did not resort to the conscienceless profiteering methods thatwere practiced in some of the largercities. They raised their own pricesas the wholesaler raised theirs andthey were compelled to do this in order to continue in business. Sincethe downward trend commenced theyhave been reducing their prices asrapidly as the wholesale rates declined, and they will continue to doso as long as there is a falling market. When you compare the price reductions in the stores of the countrytown with those in the larger citiesjust consider both sides of the question. You will discover that themerchants of Paris have been fairerto you all along the line than havethe profiteering merchants of Lexington, Louisville, or Cincinnati."Trade At Home" is a good-sloganto follow yet.THE MAN WHOLOOKS VIGOROUSGoodRed Blood Is The OnlyFoundation of PermanentHealth and VigorSureGood color, bright eyes, solidflesh, erect bearing are dependentupon rich red blood.

Foster sang theglories of "My Old KentuckyHome" in 1858 did he write the firstline" the sun shines bright in myold Kentucky home," or did he write"the sun shines bright in the oldKentucky home?"This question is engaging the attention of historical authorities inPittsburg, because a handsomebronze tablet which the city isabout to present to Bardstown, Ky.,where the song was written, designates in the first line that it is "myold Kentucky home."The reference department of Carnegie library insists that while thetitle of the song was "My Old Kentucky Home," the author wrote inthe first line that the sun shonebright in "the old Kentucky Home."Sheet music and phonograph records from reputable publshers andmanufacturers do not agree with theCarnegie library.As the tablet has been cast andis on exhibition there, it is probableit will be sent to Bardstown withoutchange, regardless of historical accuracy.Stephen G.

Thereport continues:"This is peculiarly true at thepresent time; and for the reason thatfor the last five years their revenuerates did not proportionately increase costs of operations."Therefore, in order to maintain ajust, equitable balance, the reportsays, it is necessary to maintainhigher rates longer than would tthe layman seem necessary, judgingby the declne in commodity prices,To follow any other policy wouldhamper that service to which thepublic is so justly entitled, and whichmust be maintained at highest efficiency to insure the return of "private business to the desired goal ofnormalcy." vg7 nh ir--?:- , t . . fPAGE THRUSL'i.

Unsettled conditions throughout the country and the fact that many countryconsumers are bringing their corn tothe small mill to have it groundwere suggested as possible causes.Some bakers have complained recently that their sales were muchunder those of 1920-1921, despitethe fact that flour is one of thecheapest foods on the market at thepresent time and that bakery products have been greatly reduced inprice.Discussion on labor conditions,wage reductions, wheat supplies,condition of the growing crop, thepresent cost of power and freightrates were heard during the afternoon session.
