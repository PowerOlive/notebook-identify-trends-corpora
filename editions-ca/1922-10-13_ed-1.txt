REFERENCE MATERIAL Matt 11:219; Phil. 2:5-lLPRIMARY TOPIC What John SaidAbout, Jesus.JUNIOR TOPIC John Preaching andBaptizing.INTERMEDIATE AND SENIOR TOPICA Fearless Reformer.YOUNG PEOPLE AND ADULT TOPICRepentance: What It Is and What ItDoes. -I. The Degeneracy of the Times(vv. 1, 2).The Jews had sunk to a very lowlevel of civil, moral and religious life.Luke carefully enumerates the civiland religious rulers in order to showthe profligacy of the times, and therefore the need of a messenger to callthe people back to God and virtue.Herod, the son of the Great, was. amurderer. Annas and Caiaphas werecorrupt ecclesiastical rulers.II. The Nature of John's Ministry(w. 3-6).In the wilderness he underwent adiscipline which fitted him for histask. Out of the wilderness he flashedforth preaching the baptism of repentence for the remission of sins (v.3). This ministry is declared to be afulfilment of Isaiah's prophecy. Themessage was described as one callingupon the nation to prepare for thecoming of the Messiah. Th& preparation was presented under the "figure ofa monarch of the East about to makea journey. A servant was sent beforeto prepare the highway. Valleysneeded to be filled, mountains andhills needed to be lowered, crookedplaces needed to be made straight andrough places needed -to be madesmooth. Today before the nations willreceive Christ the valleys need tobe filled with righteous deeds, the exceeding high mountains of sin andiniquity need to be brought low, thecrooked dealings of the business worldmust be straightened out, and therough ways of nations and individualsmust be smoqthed out. Men must repent of their sins before they canreceive Christ.III. The Content of John's Message(vv. 7-18).1. Denunciation of Sin (w. 7, 8).He called them "a generation of vipers." This, shows that he chargedthem with deceitfulness and wickedness. Knowing the subtle hypocrisyof these Jews, ho demanded evidenceof their sincerity the genuineness oftheir repentance was to be demonstrated by their works.2. Announcement of Judgment (v.9). He declared that the axe was laidat the root of the tree and that thetree not bringing forth fruit was to behewn down and cast Into the fire.John made it very plain that for theirsins they should be called into judgment. Paul's preaching of a judgment to come made Felix tremble(Acts 24:25).3. Instructions to the Inquirers(vv. 10-14). (1) The people (vv. 10,11). Each man was to turn from hisbesetting sin and show love and kindness to his fellow men. Clothing andfood wer to be given those who hadneed. They were to turn from a lifeof selfishness and greed and do untoothers as they would be done by. (2)Publicans (vv. 12, 13). These taxgatherers .who were guilty of greedand oppression were not asked to giveup their occupation, but to exact onlythat which, was appointed by law. (3)The soldiers (v. 14). These were likelythe policemen of that day at leastmen on military duty. He told themto extort money from no man, to accuse none falsely, and to be contentWith their wages. To all these classeshe made it clear that they shouldhenceforth perform their duty froma motive of love Instead of selfishness and greed. v4. Testimony to Jesus (vv. 15-18).The people were musing in. theirhearts as to whether John 'was indeedthe Messiah. When John perceivedthis he with fine humility declaredthat his mission was so lowly in comparison with Christ's that he wouldbe unworthy to perform the menial actof a slave in loosing the latchet ofHis shoes. John baptized with water,but Christ, he declared, would baptizewith the Holy Ghost and with fire.IV. John's Imprisonment (vv. 19,20).Because of his reproof of Herod forhis wicked lewdness and other sinsJohn went to the dungeon. The preacher of righteousness must become amartyr. God's faithful prophets areusually despised by the world, evencast into prison, burned, or beheaded.Idleness.Idleness is the gate of all harms.Anadle man is like a house that hathno walls; the devils may enter on every side.
