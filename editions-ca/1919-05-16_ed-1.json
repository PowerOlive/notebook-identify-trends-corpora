Rex . Beach's Tremendous Drama of
Alaska
"THE BRAND"
The biggest, most unusual of ail Rex Beach productions.
Despite the fight scenes, startling climaxes; the frozen trail of Alaska
in the dead of a raging storm-night; a man branded with the white-hot
barrel of his own gun; the Northwestern mounted police in action; the
sensational raid in the City of Gold.
And through' this'story of unleashed passion there runs atender story
of love and romance; a story of two men and one woman and theiin-'
written law of the great northland.' " '

STRANGE VISITATION
SECTS.
OF m-
Main street, between the bounda
ries of Third and Forth streets, was
visited yesterday morning by a cloud
of hundreds of long-winged small
flies, dark-grey in color, which settl
ed on the pavements in swarms, and
half - flew, half - crawled, heedless
alike of wind or weather.
The insects closely resembled the
very small house-fly, but was differ
ent in some respects in appearance.
They were thickest in that part of
the street near THE NEWS office, A.
J. Winter & Co.'s", Lowry & May's
and the Cash-and-Carry Grocery.
The winged visitors were seen by
nearly every passing pedestrian, yet
no one ventured an explanation. One
business man was bold enough to
suggest that they were the advance
guard of a section of the Flying Cir
cus, which has been due in Paris
since May 1, but this was scouted by
many others. Whatever they were
they created a great deal of comment
during their brief stay.

fused $100,000 cash for their prospect.
,fTheie axe several wells going down on all sides of us. The Knox Drilling Company7 is expecting
'one imy "flay, and if this proves to he a gusher $100,000 would not buy our lease.
We will begin (frilling on our Big Sinking lease as soon as the weather will permit us to move the
rig. '
This lease is known as the Poplar Thicket and has two good wells on it now. We will develop
this lease as fast as possible.
We are preparing to off-set some wells on our Hell Creek lease and will soon begin drilling on up
per Buffalo Creek, Owsley county. Our royalty interest in the famous Millie Freeman tract of 400
acres is coming fine. "
Seventeen wells now pumping, twenty-two or more under contract. This" lease is being developed
by two companies, and will double in receipts in less than a year. A word to bur stockholders : Do not
throw your stock on the exchange and let some one fool you out of it. This stock will be selling at
par not many months hence. "
We are offering a limited amount of stock at 40 cents per share. If you are interested, write for
full particulars to the Lee-Kent Oil Company, Paris, Ky., 512-514 Main Street.
When in Paris call on us. We have commodious quarters on first floor and s will welcome you.
fciTestigate us.
Mr. Wyatt Thompson, of Paris, in
forms THE NEWS that he is fully
prepared to dispute with other Bour-
ihon county fishermen the claim to
having made the record catch of a
tbig bass this spring. While fishinc
'in Mr. C. C. Hadden's pond, near
(North Middletown, Mr. Thompson
caught a big-mouth bass which tip
rped the scales atx exactly eight
pounds, no more nor less. The big
'fellow fought so gamely that it re
squired the help of Mr. Hadden to
land him safely on terra firma. Mr.
Thompson proudly says the boys, who
hp.ve been telling about their big
bass will now have to take a back
seat, or come in with a larger fish.
BACK TO OLD HOME.
Returning to the scenes of his boy
hood, upon which he turned his back
over twenty-six years ago, Mr. C. G.
Wilson, known to his intimates as
i "Count," is in Paris on a visit to his
aunt, Mrs. G. W. Allison, and Mr.
Allison.
Over twenty-six years ago Mr.
Willson left Paris, during which time
he has seen many phases of life in
different phases of life in different
different parts of the West. He finally
landed in Michigan, where he cast
anchor after sailing into a business
career.
He became interested in various en
terprises and is now proprietor of
three large retail shoe stores in Port
Huron and Muskegon, all doing a big
business.
Mr. Wilson says he was very
agreeably surprised at the appear
ance of Paris, the changes taking
place since he left here, in the mat
ter of buildings being all for the bet
ter. He complimented the general
appearance of the city, and said
though it had greatly changed from
the Paris of his day, it was yet, and
always will be, good old Paris to him.
