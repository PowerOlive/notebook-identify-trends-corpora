and to generaltherapeutic treatment The bulletinas to the patients condition says he issuffering from an abscess in the rightside of the stomach near and above theliverGen Rivera believes this was due tothe fall he had at the time he waswounded He attaches no importanceto it and in fact for some time didnot notice it at all He expresses himself as satisfied with the medical andsurgical attendance provided as wellas with the nurses All the food supplied him is excellent his meals beingserved from a restaurant nearby at hisrtvn expenseHe told a newspaper correspondentthat the wound had healed and thatthe limb had never shown any symptoms of grangrene Naturally he suffers a good deal of anxiety on accountof the abscess Since he entered thehospital he has improved somewhat inspirits although his general conditionis very serious owing to the absenceof appetite and the lack of nutritionfor the general systemIt is probable that when he recovers a somewhat mpre radical operationwill be

opinion Baileythe leader of the minority said Thursday that he would not oppose a motionto get the bill into conference provide the republicans would agree to areasonable time for debate when thebill

withhorses in a lather of foam rode furiously in from the Waco trailIs it true cried the sergeant as hesaw the unusual gathering at campWe met a feller half way over to Brayos riding like hell warning

Lambert guided by theveteran Indian fighter crawled cautiously up the height in front of themHalf the men dismounted were stahoned with ready rifle or carbine wherethey could command every approachWho could say whether Indians werenot even then lurking in every ravine0A young Texan following the roadpushed on cautiously to the point soas to scout the trail beyond Withdrooping heads and heaving flanks themotley herd were huddled in a littleswale to the right of the road theirholders eagerly watching the youngleader and saying few words WarilyDolan reached and peered over the crestThey could

there wras vestige of hope Lambert eager and impetuous was spurring off to the openprairie that lay beyond a sweepingbend of the stream but Dolan hailedhimNot yet lieutenant not yet Therescome wild

saddlesand stand em off Look yonder sirAnd then just as Dolan pointed threemounted warriors their war bonnetstrailing over their bounding poniesbacks the first hostile Indians Lambert had ever seen burst from theircovert behind the low divide to theright and went scurrying away towardsthe northward hills in wide detour tojoin their comrades The road disappeared round a gentle rise in the prairie

all the voting and officeholdingAs the returns from agriculture arevery meager in the district and thereare large towns not far away the maleinhabitants of the Besjukow neighborhood emigrate to these towns early inspring to find work leaving few butwomen and children at home and notcoming- home to attend to the little matter of votingInasmuch as the women have to doall the farm work as well as the housework in this singular community itdoes not seem strange that they ratherinsist upon holding the offices and notassigning them to such old men as maybe about Furthermore it is said thatthey have for a period of several yearsmanaged all the public affairs of theBesjukow district so well that the menare quite content to abandon the tedious work of government to themSometimes when the head

Its LifeShould Be Spent in SleemMore than two thirds of the life of ahealthy baby should be passed in sleepTherefore a wise mother is exceedingly- careful in selccsting the material ofher babys bed Probably the most un-wholesome bed the wee dainty bit ofIhumanity can have is the little swing-V ui bassinet of down lace and ribbonswhich French milliners prepare underJ - the apparent impression that baby isa sort of toy to be dressed up forplay and laid away when asleep like af French doll-- The best crib for a baby is not aswinging bassinet or any swinging orrocking cradle but a cqb of liberal- tsize which stands firmly on its legsand is large enough for the child untilit is old enough to sleep hi a regularbed The pillow of the babys bedshould be a fiat one of hair not over twoinches thick This is not thetional baby pillow of the shop ThatMssa doll like affair of down coveredwith linen cambricind edged with lacemd is a very dangerous pillow to useor two reasons First the brain of andnfant is very sensitive and liable tocongestion from over excitement in-digestion or some slight cause and theliead should be kept cool and shouldnot be heated by a down pillow secondly ihe down used in the shops unless the work is made to order is always Arctic down This is composedof the soft feathers stripped from thequills of the German goose It is sopenetrating that the fine particles willforce themselves through the seamsand the Interstices in the muslin whichis usually used to cover the pillow oreven through ted ticking These unwholesome particles floating in the airsire then liable to be breathed by thesleeping infant- he best bed coverings for a babyare sheets of cambric or linen inand soft blanket of pure California Wool which are as warm and-light as down and much more wholesorae in winter A silken comfortableof down is allowable if the mother canafford tbat silken like down which theeider duel plucks from her breast toline the nest which she builds for her-own ducklings in the Arctic snowsThis soft dun colored down does notfloat about but clings together kg-that it is safe to use it The coverlet oithe babys bed may be of any daintyhued wash silk

andwithout tears almost without thoughtor memory too for the ordeal had lefther capable of little more than the consciousness that he had left her neverto comebackSuddenly the first red rays of therising sun sliot into the room brightening it perceptibly in spite of their dulling passage through the smoky cityatmosphere Slowly her faculties cameback to her the memory firstSo dim and shadowy were the pictures of her childhood that the detailswere lost There was the death of herfather and later that of the motherThen she was alone in the village wheretheir home had been Her struggleswith life after that were shadowy alsotill she met RobertBut from that point the memory pencil wrought swiftly and vividly Thecourtship the marriage the brief -villagelife the promising chance in thebig city and the removal from thelage and the birth of the baby Thenthe day of the accident when Robertwas brought home in an ambulanceHe was not seriously hurt the surgeonsaid though he would have to be absent from the office awhile But theyhad been thrifty and had money in thebank much more than enough to tidethem over an idleness of a few weeksRobert had long needed a rest and nowhe could have it She would care forhim much better than any trainednurse and they would still be happytogetherBut Roberts idleness lasted monthsinstead of weeks The money in thebank grew less They gave up all buttwo rooms of their pretty flat for economys sake and both to economize andin order that she might be free to giveher whole time to the invalids care thechild now three years old was put incharge of a sisterhood in a homewhere the cost was onlv nominal Theand unhooked the index fingers of histwo clumsy handsBut Mr Shultz said Robertswidow I must earn my living I mustgo out and find some work to do I haveno money left and I cannot afford therent even of these two rooms I mustsell in furniture to get money to keepme till I can earn somethingAch You do not understand whatI say My mother she says you shallcome and live with her and keep herfrom being lonesome She dont wantmoney she wants company You wantcompany and you want money tooWhen you get rested you come in thedrug store every day and take in themoney and help keep the books as mymother has done I will pay you forthat But first my mother says youneed to rest a little whileShe seemed undecided and across hisface there passed a puzzled lookYou let my mother talk to you hesaid after a moment or two and lumbered out closing the door softlyA little later Mrs Schultz came in andsoon the soothing tones of her quaintbroken English had proved far morepersuasive than all her son had saidCome to me child she said crooningly and let me put you to bed andmake you to sleep Then you shall helpthe old woman Do not look at nle thatway It is I who need thee much morethan thou needst me she concluded inlier native tongueIIIAnd so it came that Roberts widowcame to be the housekeeper of thelittlefamilj of three sometimes serving ascashier and helper in the neat littledrugstore on the ground floor Theyears two or three in number thatfollowed moved uueventually alongLittle by little she became used to livingwithout Robert little by little she grewcheerful and almost contentedBetween her and the druggists mother there came to be such a bond as mayexist between two women withpure and simple minds But Robertswidow could not understand the sonri - j t - w rfJI jpyj yMOTHER AND DAUGHTER WERE TOO MUCH ABSORBED IN ONE ANOTHERTO NOTE HIS APPROACHHe seemed to be friendly but if sohis friendship was voiceless for theynever spoke to one another except whenspeech was necessary and he avoidedthe second floor alone with his mother Ther as much as he could To hisjust under the flat where life with Robert had been so happyBut now now she was alone oncemore The happ3r part of her life wasfinished and she must begin all overagain Thank Heaven she was not indebt The money had lasted longenough to pay the doctor and the undertaker but there was hardly enoughleft to buy the bare food necessary tosuppqrt life for one more week Shtook up her flat purse and counted the1 few coins it contained Their smallvalue roused her She could not affordto sit there brooding that was clearInstantly all her faculties were alertIIThere was a heavy step in the halloutside and then a knock It wasShultz and when he came in he satdown awkwardly as far away f romlieras he couldMy mother he began bunglinglyshe sajs you must be lonelyThe first tear since Roberts deathrolled down his widows cheekShe says the landlord druggistwent on that you should not live alonehere She says that she is sometimeslonely too She is getting a little oldand she cannot be in the store as sheused to and sometimes when I am atmy business all day she wishes she hadcompany to drive the lonesomenessaway She says I should speak to youand ask you to be withher every dayand then neither of you will be lone-tomers and acquaintances and to hismother he talked freely in her pres 1ence his tongue was always slow andawkward Once when she raised hereyes suddenly she found- his fixed onher face with a strange expression thatmight mean dislike or quite the reverse At all events it made her flushpainfully and thereafter she avoidedhim as much as he did herThou shouldst not mind him childthe old mother whose keen eyes hadtaken in the situation said one day inGerman He is a good son to me andhe is not unfriendly to thee but he doesnot understand he is bashful beforeany woman but his motherHis attitude toward her and the continued separation from her little onewere the only trials Roberts widow wascalled to bear while her life with thekind old German woman lasted Andas she was allowed to see the little oneevery week and as the child seemedalwaj s well and happy this latter wasnot so much of a trial after allBut there came a time when Shultzcould no longer avoid his mothersfriend nor yet keep silent before herIt was on the day she found the goodold woman sitting peacefully in hereasy chair her knitting in her hands asusual but quite dead with a smile onher face that was not soon forgottenby either of the two that were JeftTo

learnedfortitude from her earlier griefs andlier feeling was not as before that shewas entirely desolateThe dny after the mothers funeralShultz found voice before Robertswidow though he began his talk asawkwardly as of old and in almost thesame words he had used beforeMy mother said to me more thanonce he began hooking and unhooking his index fingers that you wouldbe a good wife for me jShe stopped him with a flash fromher eyesBut your mother is dead she criedand you are not a child to talk of marriage because your mother advised itWhy do you not just once speak foryourself WhyAnd then she checked herself remembering she was Roberts widow Buishe had loosed the mans tongue andspeaking in German as his mother hadalways done when her emotions wereroused he poured forth such a torrentof passionate protest of love of supplication that she was positively fright vened She had not dreanied that thisslow awkward man was capable oiintense feeling he had always seemedto her to think only of his drugs andthe money they sold for She hadthought the entrance of herself a thirdperson into his little home had alwaysbeen distasteful to him Yet here hewas making a most passionate declaration of love But she hesitated Couldshe Roberts widow marry this druggist Suddenly she knew she lovedhim and had loved him for a longtimeAnd so after an interval they weremarried and life was happily begunagain for her who had been Robertswidow Her happiness notwas exactly like the happiness she had feltas Roberts wifeA yet it was real andShultz knew it and rejoicedBut the little girl still remained withthe kind sisters and this was just a little mote in the sunshine for the motherEvery Sunday she visited the child justas before though this was never mentioned in the flat over the drugstoreBut one Sunday when the mother wentaway Shultz looked very serious andwhen he was alone he began walkingup and down the floorf I shall be back soon dear she hadsaid with a smile on her lips on leaving but there had been a tear in hereye and perhaps that was what madehim impatient and caused his indexfingers to hook and unhook themselvesin the old way automatically as ifthey were parts of an unthinking- pieceof machinery After a time he put onhis hat with a determined air and wentheavily down the stairs muttering under his breathYes yes It is better that she shouldmake no more Sunday visits to the Sisters home and I will see to that OhI will see to that Yes yesOn the car which he boarded he continued to talk below his breath to theihstonishment of his fellow passengerselis wne was oiaamg gooanoy to tnelittle one when he entered the visitorsroom of the home and mother anddaughter were too absorbed in one another to note his approach in spite ofhis heavy tread He was thinking

members belong to thatfavored class whose fortunes are denoted by six figures said a senator anda millionaire recently and this givesa wrong impression of the characterof that body To be sure many of thesenators are millionaires and there aresome who while not so fortunate as tobe listed as millionaires are very richmen but I am not stating it broadlywhen I say the majority of the wealthymen in the senate have only themselvesto thank for their riches Many ofthem began life as poor boys andworked and struggled their way toprominence and success and the sameenterprise that made them wealthymakes them successful politicians Itis not always to his money that a manowes his seat in the upper house anda mans self -earned wealth should entitle him to the respect rather than thesneers of his contemporariesThis is quite true The majority ofthe senators began life in humble circumstances and one of the most inteiesting of these self made men is Senator Fairbanks of Indiana successor tothe late Senator Yoorhees SenatorFairbanks is of Yankee origin andthose characteristics common to thedescendants of the Puritans have beenuseful to him in his career His fatherwas born in Vermont but went west asfar as Ohio when he was a young manand settled there He was a wagonmaker by trade and worked at first for37 cents a da3 but his applicationperseverance and faithfulness won himthe regard and esteem of his employerwho finally took him into partnershipand gave him his daughter in marriageBut Mr Fairbanks Sr never- became a rich man The present senatorwas born in a log cabin and by workingat carpentering on Saturdays and during the vacations helped to pay his waythrough the Ohio Wesleyan universityof which college he is an alumnusAfter leaving college Senator Fairbanks first real work was the Associated Press and he maintained himself doing newspaper work while hewas Studying law and until he was admitted to the bar He attributes hissuccess in life to steady application toone purpose that of becoming a successful lawyer From this purpose henever swerved until he was made senator Political preferment did nottempt him and his present office is thefirst p61itical place he has heldBut Senator Fairbanks is not the onlyone among his colleagues who has wonhis way to honor and distinction from amodest beginning Senator Forakerbeing one of 11 children had perhapseven a harder struggle with povertyand to this discipline which he receivedin the army which he entered at 16serving until the close of the war whenhe retired with the rank of first lieutenant and brevet captain his successin life is larg ely due N Y TribuneA HERMIT BECAUSE HE LIKES ITJohn Stnrncs Took to the Woodsing the War and Is There StillThirty five years ago John Starneslived near Blacksburg York countyand only a few miles from the battlefields of Cowpens and Kings mountainwhere the Americans whipped the British The proximity of the battlefieldsdid not inspire a warlike spirit in thebreast of Starnes During the war theconscription officers cast covetous eyeson the mountaineers stalwart frameand Starnes took to the woods Theysearched for him but Starnes was abetter runner than a fighter and hekept out of the w ay out of the war andin the woods He had an old musket anda supply of ammunition and fare inthe woods was better than in thetown Starnes became fond of the lifeand when the war was over and conscription officers had lost their dreaded power Starnes still remained in thewilds of YorkAnd there he is now living His homeis not a romantic cave in the rocks butis a

husband Jean iouvain shebegan eagerly and our meeting wasa strange one indeed I was in searchof a clever forger whom the police believed to be a woman and I had to goto Riviera in search of her I had beenin the Hospital of St Jacques to see aman whom I thought could give me information and it occurred to me suddenly that the dress of a Sister of Mercywould be a good disguise I left Parisin time to reach Marseilles early onelovely morning and going to the houseof a friend I changed my clothes andscarcely recognized nryself as I lookedin the great glass at the railway stationNo hair could be seen and the largecollar and winged cap gave me quite adifferent expression I had bought aamal bag exactly like those the sisterscarry to hold the things I needed andT had my papers sewn inside a dress Iwore I was young then and the casesthat interested me occupied me so en-tirely that I became sleepless and suffered at timer from sudden faintnessPiclxAwouldikbesueeeedeJiy violentairis in my head To

tostupefy youPardon monsieur she returnedmy tale is better than that At Marseilles I got into a compartmentwhence several ieople descended anda man who was its sole occupant triedto prevent my entrance as if unconsciously but I looked sharply at himand got in He then placed his arms onthe doorway and blocked the windowuntil the train left the station then hethrew himself on the seat in the cornerfarthest from me on the opposite sideand flung cf the large cloak he waswearingTo my surprise and horror I sawhe was partly dressed as a woman andlie took from beneath the seat a bag likethose in which workmen carry theirtooLs and quietly continued his toiletNaturally I watched him He was smalland slight and very fair and when hetook off his coat and waistcoat collarand -tie I saw a great scar beneath theleft ear going right under his chinI knew him instantly he was Druette the man whom I believed safely inprison at Toulon who was the most ingenious and cruel of a gang of thievesvho had infested Paris for three yearsand who had been cleverly capturedllrree months before The captor hadreceived 5000 francs and now he wastt large again and here before me in-this narrow compartment He stoppedliis toilet and said to me in the quiet-clear voice which I knew to be one ofliis characteristicsMy sister I am running for my lifeMy life is dear to me and nothing shallstand in the way of my freedom doyou understand NothingAs lie said this he took from his bag-a large sliarp knife such as shoemakersuse and laid it on the seat beside himJidge monsieur how I felt Thoughtis quick and my

as I say you have nothing to dread I shall quit the train atToulon and you must talk to me as if iI were coming home to my - lamnyand you kad made acquaintance withme at LyonsOf course I promised and

word till hewas out of sightAnd I shall watch your trainaway my bister he added --After I had finished dressing himI went back to my seat and then Ilaughed He looked furious and askedme why I was such a fool I said hisface was a fair womans and his haira dark ones and he would be noticeddirectly He scowled at me and saidIdiot but at the same time he broughtfrom his bag a bottle of dye and abrush and began to color his handsThe stuff would not run and he shookthe bottle violently but it came inlumps I want some spirit he saidviciously and he swore oh monsieurso awfullyI trembled really this time for itwas so fearful to be shut up with sucha wretch Then an inspiration camato me and I said See I have no cognac but I take a medtcine sometimeswhich is a spirit and I poured some ofthe ether into his bottle and- shook isIt ran beautifully became a deafbrown liquid he scarcely looked athank 3011 but rapidly painted binhands using his left as cleverly as hiaright then he tried his face andthen I laughed again this -time withjoy for I had regained my courageand I felt I should capture himWhy do you laugh now he said4fiercelyBecause you are making yourcheeks too dark your eyelidsare whiteand you have left a rim around Yourlips I said in as steady a voice as Icould commandGood heavens he exclaimed andthen he said to me Take this bmshand paint me1I took it and pretended to

and pouredhalf the contents on the wadding thathad been around it Happily it was alarge piece and dropping the brush Ipressed it suddenly over his nose andmouth and saturated it with the etherThe

backand his arms fell powerlessly besidehimI had no knowledge of the action ofanaesthetics and now a dread possessedme lest I had killed him I rememberedhavingheardsomewherethat slight people of quick brains were specially susceptible to these influences and Ithought perhaps I should only take adead body into ToulonHe looked so ghastly with the streaksof paint on his livid skin I placed myhand on his heart and felt his wristmost thankful was I to find a pulsationThen I seated nryself on the floor keeping my fingers on his wrist and havingin my lap the bottle of chloroform topour on the pad if I felt his pulsesquicken too muchI have had many trying journeysbut never another to match this I amnot cruel by nature and sitting thereduring the quarter of an hour of thejournej that remained I

to poultry said at arecent farmers meeting held in Bostonif he was confined to one kindiof grainhe would take corn With this he wouldfeed clover fodder cornmeat and other like food Upon being asked if wheatuwti iiul sumuiaie laying jlt uusnmanreplied that he would not think of giving up wheat but wanted to impress hishearers that too much stress is put onfeedingwheataiitltoo much said againstftedhig corn by poultry writersThis agrees with our experience exactly We believe that corn is the bestsingle grain tor poultry and feed itevery day Do not underrate wheatfor it is a good feed to stimulate eggproduction butit is not indispensable tothe poultry keeperThe great trouble with farm poultry is usually that it gets corn everyday and all the time If the hens runat large they have free access to theyard where the hogs are fed and a goodmany times the corn crib is opeujothem at any time Under these circumstances the hens fill themselveswith corn and do not eat enough otherfood to keep them in laying conditionCorn is essentially a fattening grainand when we remember that the yolk ofan egg contains a large proportion ofpure fat we see how necessary a goodsupply of fat forming food is to tieproduction of eggs No single foodprovides this so plentifully as corn doesand the poultry keepr who does not useit will not have the greatest possiblesuccessIf laying hens are given a light feedof corn in the morning they will huntinsects and eat grass enough to satisfytheir appetites and maintaia the balance of the nutritive element in thefood they eatGrass is a perfectly balanctd food forlive stock and poultry and to one whonever gave the matter attention it is asource of astonishment to leara howmuch of it poultry will eat Inthe nornia condition of things a hen will liveon grass but if she is laying she musthave something in addition to furnishthe egg material and this can be supplied by giving her corn more cheaplythan in any other wayLong observation convinces us thatcorn fed to laying hens makes the yolksa richer yellow and gives consistency tothe whites of eggs Eggs laid by a halffed hen have whites that are thin andwatery and the yolks are often pale audthin falling flat when the egg is brokeninstead of standing up in the shape of ahalf globeCorn is the best grain food for layinghens but too much of it checks egg production It is hard to convince peoplesometimes that if a little is good a greatdeal is better but in the case of feedingcorn to laying hens it is almost safe tosay that too much is worse than noneFarmers VoiceHINTS
