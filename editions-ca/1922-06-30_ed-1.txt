WallaceThe Commonwealth either willjoin in the -suit of Paul E. Shippagainst former Sheriffs J. W. Rodesand Thomas C. Bradley, of Fayettecounty, to recover fees, alleged tohave been received by them in excess of $5,000, the constitutionallimit, or institute separate proceedings, Attorney General Charles I.Dawson said.The statement resulted from theCourt of Appeals decision, holdingthat the constitutional limitation onthe salaries of public officers is selfoperative and capable of enforcement. No statute, limiting the numberof deputies a county officer may employ or requiring him to account forexcessive fees, has been enacted, excepting with reference to Jeffersoncounty. The Louisville officers settle with the State Auditor for all 'their fees and are allowed their compensation, expenses and deputy hireby him. The decision, therefore,does not alter the Jefferson countysituation. The law fixes the numberof deputies they may have.Sheriffs in at least twenty counties are supposed to receive- highercompensation for their services thanthe Sheriff of Jefferson.On the basis of their 1921 assessments Sheriffs received the followingcommissions for collecting the 1921State taxes: Bourbon, $5,300; Boyle,$3,300; Campbell, $6,70t); Christian, $4,900; Clark, $4,300; Davies,$6,200; Fayette, $13,000; Franklin,$3,000; Garrard, $2,500; Graves,$4,100; Harlan, $2,500; Harrison,$3,300; Henderson, $4,700; Kenton,$7,900; Logan, $2,400; Madison,$4,200; Mason, $4,100; McCracken,$4,6000; Mercer, $2,700; Nelson,$2,600; Pike, $2,600; Scott, $3,300;Shelby, $4,200; Union, $3,400; War-!ren, $4,100, and Woodford $3,500.No public officer in Kentucky, mu-! Ithe Governor may receive compen-.sation in excess of $5,000 a year.!Sheriffs receive numerous fees forcourt service and commissions for,collecting State and county taxes.The tax assessment has been doubl-''ed since 1917. State taxes have in-jcreased $2,500,000 and county taxes.$S, 500, 000. Consequently Sheriffs' Lcommissions of 10 per cent on the!first $5,000 of both State and county!taxes and 4 per cent on the remain-'der have increased enormously.oTHE RAIDO IN THE COUNTRYOne of the big elements in ruraladvance in Kentucky has been thetelephone. It has banished loneliness from the country home. Nowcomes the development of the radiotelephone which seems likely to fillalmost as big a place. The time willcome when most country homes willbe equipped with receiving sets, thatwill give them- the news of the dayand a splendid variety of entertain-'ment.Then people will no longer complain that they are shut off from the Ibig world. The best music and lee- (tures, the latest market reports and jthe doings of the public bodies, willbe made known to the quiet groupsaround the fireside. It will reconcilemany to country life who are now,restive in quiet villages. jo In jUa W& invito- VYour Account.Earning money and not having a pass book is likebuilding a house and not putting a roof on it.
