Officials close to the President saidthis was in accordance with navalpractice of nations and according toprecedent.Word of Huerta's decision virtually to acceed to all the American demands came to the WITrte House as.the result of an executive session ofthe Mexican Senate to which Huertaoutlined the entire situation."The situation is very encouraging, said Secretary Bryan after hereceived a dispatch from Charge O'Shaughnessy in which Gen. Huerta'sattitude was described as yielding.Mr. Bryan and acting chairmanShively, of the Sente Foreign Relations Committe, both emerging fromthe White House smiling.Unofficially it was stated that if thesalute was fired, some of the American warships now speeding to Mexican waters would be turned back.WASHINGTON, April 16. With amajority of the ships of the Americannavy under orders to proceed at onceto the Atlantic and Pacific coast ofMexico, the United States Government gave Gen. Huerta final warningthat unless a salute was fired lto thestars and stripes within a reasonabletime, to atone for repeated offensesagainst lhe rigntsajidgnityofihUnited StatesionlTeWuaffcwould result.It was learned that Gen. Huerta,when apprised by Charge O'Shaughnessy of the proposed demonstration ofthetlantic fleet, argued that the episode growing out of the arrest of theAmerican bluecoats at Tampico wasa fit subject for arbitration at TheHauge, and that he would appoint a-commission to investigate the incident. President Wilson, in an emphatic reply through Charge O'Shaughnessy, is understood to have told Gen.Huerta that the time for delay andevasion had passed, and that theAmerican Government would temporwas bluffing. Some anti-Americanals hold that insult to the flag andquestions of national honor are notsubjectsfor arbitration..All information, dfficial and otherwise, that reached Washington fromMexico City tended to show that Gen.HTferta ' was unconvinced that theUnited States was in earnest, .andthought' the 'Washington Governmentthe offenses of the de facto Governdemonstrations at Vera Crua and other points were reported.1 Developments of the day here showed clearly that a determined andforcefulpolicy had been adopted bythe President, which would be backedtip by Congress and enforced if necessary by the army and navy.While expressing earnest hope forpeace, the President unequivocallytold members of the Senate and HouseCommittees on Foreign Affairs- thatthe offenses of the de faco Government at :MdxiedTjily"to fneigity"of"PMlio TTniTA1 3-ntcc -wrrtiilrl Vio -Pnllv lilt!-'i Wi u"'.u - "-- " v- -, ."-.tJ J;s!fin(q v.j.

W. Newman, who said hewould not be surprised if the wasteamounts to as much as 5,000,000 annually. This is by way of preface toa plan proposed for presenting theeconomic side of stock raising at theState Fair.Balanced rations will be the crux ofthe demonstration planned under thedirection of the Government farm demonstrator of Jefferson county, whohas instructions to purchase twentyswine at once to be placed on the Fairgrounds. Half of them will be fed oncorn and the other half on balancedrations until the Fair opens; then thefarmers will be shown the differencein the results obtained."Corn alone produces fat. Thehogs should be fed corn mixed withother rations in proportions well demonstrated to be correct, which produce bone and muscle. With thegrowth of bone and muscle more fatand weight can be added," said Commissioner Newman, "and while withcorn alone it costs 6 cents the poundthey can be fattened for 4 cents thepound. We raise 60,000,000 bushelsof corn in Kentucky annually; it issafe to say 20,000,000 are fed to hogs.If by feeding corn alone it costs 2cents to the pound, or one-third, morethan to feed balanced rations for producing weight, one can easily seeinto what immense figures the-annualwaste runs."A purse of $150 will be offered boys'clubs, whose members will fattensteers to be shown and judged at theFair. The prizes will be awarded thewinners, who must explain their method of feeding, and the steers will besold in Louisville. A purse of $100will be offered members of boys' phjHclubs in the same way.FIRE PROTECTION IN WISCONSINThe new Wisconsin code aims to fixbroad standards of fire protection andsanitation not details of design or arrangement. Thus the code is lessthan one-half as long as the New YorkCity code. On the engineering orstructural side little more is giventhan tables of floor loads, bearingvalue of soils, and allowable unitstresses, all of which are made substantially uniform with the new Milwaukee ordinances. A rather unusualprovision is one permitting the specified floor loads to be reduced by twenty pounds in fireproof buildings. Thereason for this discrimination are:A fireproof floor suffers little or no deterioration; a fireproof floor is notweakened by a fire below; the greaterdead load of a fireproof floor meansthat any accidental overload is asmaller proportion of the total deadand live load.The most detailed provisions arethose relating to stairways and fireescapes. In apartment houses a covered outside rear stairway is recommended, which acts as a service stairway and fire escape combined; andwhere this is provided, no fire escapeis required.

Bold-sulphur has occupied a secure position for many yearsin the treatment of cutaneous diseasesbecause of its parasite-destroyingproperties. Nothing has ever beenfound to take its place in treating theirritable and inflammatory skin affections. While not always establishinga permanent cure, it never fails to subdue the itching irritation and , drivethe eczema away, and it is often' yearslater before any eruption again appears on the skin.Those troubled should obtain at anypharmacy an ounce of bold-sulphurcream which is applied to the affected parts in the same manner as an ordinary cold cream. It isn't unpleasant and the prompt relief afforded,,particularly in itching eczema, provesvery welcome.

Althoughthe first wave of excitement caused bythe Spring openings has vanished, ithas left behind a hundred little ripples of interest, each emanating fromsome question of tlie new styles. Ofcourse, everyone was prepared for thefuller skirts; but the collars which almost cover the mouth, coats with noleeves, and dresses of white damaskare still subjects of nine days wonderment. The appearance of pantalettes ofsheer muslin or lace are not to be considered at all seriously in themselves;it is only what they foreshadow which.gives them so much interest. First,they mean shorter skirts, as wereshown by some of the French dressmakers, who made them so short thatof necessity something had to be added, and the very narrow underskirtwas split into the pantalette. Possibly the next thing will be that the pantalettes will be dropped, leaving theankles well exposed.McCaluTaffeta and Plaid Suiting Combine toMake a Smart and Practical Costume for General WearThese pantalettes are not the garment as wo understand them, but aretwo fitted leglets theit follow the lineof the leg from the knee to the ankleBut the really interesting part, of thisquestion is that the idea was not suggested or brought about by a reversion to the clothes of our grandparents, but by that most ultra of modernists, Leon Bakst. It is an evolution of the Persian influence whichhe introduced upon the stage and Poiret exploited so successfully a yearago.Another old-fashioned idea which isforcing itself again to the front is thetight-htting basque, -with darts in thefront and three seams in the back.It is also seen with the semi-fittedfront and a very loosely-fitting back.One novel gown which I saw had theback and sleeves in one, and thefront, giving a basque effect, beganat a yoke-line across the bust; it buttoned down the front, and was slightly lifted below tne waistline with asash, which tied in the back. Theskirt which joined the basque wasdraped and pulled into an old-fashioned"pull-back," giving the appearance of the polonaise of 1880.After each war some new style hasappeared which has resulted from thetypes of costumes in c:ie various countries involved. From these sourceshave come the Russian blouse, Japanese and Balkan effects. It is not tobe wondered at that Mexico shouldprove an inspiration for revolutioneven in dress. The wide trousers ofthe men and the brilliant national colors have already given birth to theidea of a striking costume of khakicolored gabardine, tMth ball trimmingdown either side of the skirt. Beneath the white linen collar on thebodice, which is piped in red and yellow, lies a second collar of whitecrepe. The flaring cuffs and red andyellow striped sash give the chic finish to the costume.The striking development of thefrock which I have used for my firstillustration is both interesting andsmart. The raglan sleeves are of thechecked fabric, and the body of theI waist is of taffeta matching the deep-yF&.A 'I''laa4aKXvoWMwAaViaaariHQA?!5Kl5vrBmimaaaaDl(4STS3FlUi-lflmmlJmmVMjkjL 'K&wflmmmmmmVmm vm3RBlMaHKlmmVflm61f4mmVmmBfmmmmmmm!mmJns4mV V-lmmmflmVmmmlfir -Aer-colored check, and a pleated tunicof this same material is placed over askirt of check. The cleverly-cut beltof checked material, with buttons covered with taffeta, and a flaring organdy collar complete this costume,whose good cut is enhanced by thefascinating combination of materials.An unusually up-to-date combination which will appeal to the womanwhose taste prefers the quieter blending of colors and fabrics is the combination of serge and satin of the sameor contrasting color, such as blue andblack, or black and black.An evening frock of two-toned taffeta pink and purple, giving mauveeffect is the model for my second illustration. The simple bodice is developed in shadow lace with a chiffonover-waist. A pointed bib of the silkextends upward on the waist from thewaistline. The skirt of taffeta has acharmingly ruffled pannier.The accessories of dress are alwaysimportant, and none more so than thechemisettes, collars and " guimpeswhich are worn with all kinds ofgowns this season. The shops showthem in many attractive styles, flaringcollars, low collars and wide collars.The fronts of the chemisettes -or theguimpes, are simply lapped and fastened with tiny crochet buttons.These are often made of organdy,Swiss and the sheerest of batiste,hand-embroidered, hand-tucked andpleated. The same pattern may produce any number of these, which maybe trimmed in such various ways thatthey seem quite different. Some aremade double and others hemstitchedabove the hem. Fagoting is anothersimple way of embellishing these.Edging of embroidery can be usedvery successfully by mitering the corners of the collar and making the embroidery edges meet down the front.Quite as interesting as the new designs are the new materials. Of thesethe changeable two-toned taffetas arefirst in favor. They are brilliant andvery supple, adapting themselvesgracefully to the draperies of the moment. The plaid taffeta must not beforgotten, for it holds an importantplace in a season where combinationsand contrasts are the order of themode. Silk gabardine is being useda great deal. It looks just like itswool prototype, except that it is silk.Damask is another favorite materialfor summer dresses. Tempting newwash materials embrace many kindsMcCau.Two-Toned Taffeta with Chiffon OverShadow Lace are the Componentsof This Interesting EveningDress.of crepe, silk and cotton. It is interesting to note what beautiful copies ofexpensive wool, wool and silk, and sat-!in crepes are successfully reproducedin cotton. Even the heavy white satin Chinois is copied, and the result isa very excellent and durable cottontussar crepe. It is seen in many colors, and is an excellent substitute forthe smoth linen which is used so oftenfor summer tub frocks.Embroidery is being used on all theSummer fabrics, not only on the materials used for lingerie Jresses, but ontaffeta and silk in self-toned and brilliant colorings. It is also much usedfor finishing sash ends and girdles inan attractive way. The girdles of thetailored suits are often of the samematerial as the suit and embroideredstiflly, embroidered and braided, orbraided on a colored material in blackblue, red and yellow. The 'obliquepocket openings on skirts are alsotreated in the same way.LOOK TO YOUR PLUMBING.You know what happens in a housein which the plumbing is in bad condition everybody in the house is liableXp contract typhoid or some other fever.
