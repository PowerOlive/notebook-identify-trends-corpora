The influenza situation here re
mains very much the same. There
have been no deaths, and only a few:
new cases reported. Our citizens -are
using every precaution to prevent
spread of the disease. Not all the
iomes where it has developed have
been placarded, as they should be for
the protection of the public. Post
master Cray has made a vigorous pro
test against the crowding of the post
office lobby at the opening of the
Tbing mail. He desires to keep the
office open for the accommodation of
patrons, but for safety, has issued a
rule that not more than three per
sons will be allowed in the lobby at
one time. Unless this is complied
with the Postoffice Department may
bJ called on to take steps to enforce
it.

CANARD
r. , .
The statement circulated by Dr.
Bruner and others that Governor
Stanley stated in a speech at Cin
cinnati on March 16, 1918, that
"Prohibitionists were worse tyrants
than the Kaiser and bigger fools'
is absolutely false and was imme
diately corrected by the paper
wh.ch published ,t. Congressman
Alfred A. Allen and other distin
guished guests who were present
have also contradicted it. This
false statement is made at the close
of the campaign for the purpose
of prejudicing Governor Stanley in
the eyes of the temperance people
and to secure repudiation of Wood
row Wilson at the polls.
THOMAS S. RHEA,
Campaign Chairman.
PROBLEMS OF RECONSTRUCTION
Senator Weeks, of Massachusetts,
introduced the original "reconstruc
tion" bill in the Senate. It was im
mediately taken up by a Republican
caucus and endorsed.
It provides for
a joint committee of the two branch
es of Congress consisting of six mem
bers from each body, one-half of
whom are to be Democrats and the
other one-half of the committee to be
Republicans. Senator Overman, of
North Carloina, has followed with a
resolution similar to the Weeks meas
ure, except that it provides that the
President shall name the members of
a reconstruction commission, and
that it shall be" independent of Con
gress. The Overman bill is generally
regarded as the "Administration
measure." Other bills have been in
troduced by Senator Owen, of Okla
homa, and another by'Meyer London,
Socialist; and still another by Rep
resentative Madden, of Chicago. The
Weeks resolution enumerates speci
fically the different subjects" to be in
vestigated and reported on. It -specifies
a number of problems affecting
labor, capital and credit, public utili
ties, conditions resulting from the
mobilization of our industrial and
military war resources, problems af
fecting our foreign trade, the contin
uance of existing industries, and the
establishment of new industries;
problems relating to agriculture;
problems affecting the adequate pro
duction and effective distribution of
coal, gasoline and other fuels, prob
lems relating to. shipping, (.including
shipping yards) ; and especially in re
gard to the sale, continuance of own
ership or leasing of -both yards and
ships, housing conditions, and condi
tion of nouse . construction by the
Government during the war, where
legislation is now on the statute
books with reference to- its repeal,
extension or amendment. In addi
tion to these topics, which
are subdivided into many sub
jects, the resolution further provides
that the committee of Congress shall
have power to inquire into making
recommendations with reference to
"all matters necessarily arising dur
ing the change from the activities of
war to the pursuit of peace."
In the Senatp speeches it has been
pointed out that every nation now
engaged in the war, has beSK and is
now getting ready for peace condi
tions. It seems that nearly three
years ago conferences were held by
the Allies, at which certain general
principles were adoptedin regard to
trade conditions after the war, the
relationship of one power to another,
the .relationship of the Allied nations
to friendly countries, and neutral na
tions to the enemy governments. In
tne enemy countries me same son oe
plan has been made to deal with con
-
,-'

i"
ditions after the -war. "We must)
without delay, take such steps as ma
be necessary to provide for the in
numerable new problems we must
face the day peace is made," declared
Senator Weeks, "because we do not
need in the summer is no reason fof
not filling our bins for the coming
winter," he added.

CINCINNATI HEALTH OFFICER
PROTESTS AGAINST LA-
TONIA RACING.
The Cincinnati Board of Health,
Officer, has protested against the fall
race meeting at Latonia, while the
present influenza epidemic situation,
continues.
Doctor Peters telegraphed the Ken
tucky State Board of Health asking
it to order the race meeting postpon
ed until the situation in Cincinnati
clears.
He said opening of the race track
would spread the disease in Cincin
nati and Kentucky. He pointed out
that large crowds would fill cars be
tween Cincinnati and the track.
The Kenton County Council of De
fense is assisting Cincinnati in at
tempting to postpone thex meet. Dr.
Peters said.

A MONUMENTAL WASTE.
(Louisville Times)
In the annals of humanity there
occurs the record of no greater waste
of human resource than that of which
Col. Thodore Roosevelt has been
guilty. Possessed of splendid powers
of mind, magnetism of the strongest,
animal courage in such a degree as to
be at once the admiration and envy
of the crowd, Col. Roosevelt has yield-
ed to the temptations of his clamor
ous ego to the point- that his person
ality is worse than useless it has be
come a drag -upon the fortunes of the
Nation.
While it is unlikely that Col. Roose
velt retains such a following as to
make his actions vitally dangerous to
our aims of war and peace, his con
tinuous and presumptuous offerings
of advice an'd rebuke to the President
and the Government of the United
States of America are a shame upon
the land. He has devoted a large part'
of his time and the whole of his per
sonal strength of late months -to an
effort at muddying the waters; and
his statements of Friday at concert
pitch of envy and thwarted egotism
shows him up not as the patriot he
so clamorously claims to be, but as a
common scold.
Had Col. Roosevelt devoted him
self to the uses of patriotism from the
entry of the United States into the
war until this time, it would be im
possible to calculate the good he
could have accomplished. But he
never has been able to put politics
out of his mind; and instead of in
spiring his followers with a yearning
to he,ot service to ihecountry, .he has
succeeded in tainting thenTwith the
discontent that has utterly spoilediis
usefulness as a citizcn,-'Wehav5ei 'con
served, much during the war, but this
I waste of man-power is irretrievable.

Somebody's Dollars Will Do It
1 Wonder if They'll Be Yours
- By Bruce Barton
WILL tell you what will happen soma
night this winter in. France. Some
night when .its cold and dark. There
I
will be a rustling through the front line
trench, where our boys stand guard. And
a heavy ladened Secretary will make
his way along.
In his hands will be great steaming
pots: in his pocket chocolate and ciga
rettes. From one man to another he will go,
passing a cup full of hot coffee to hands
that tremble with the cold ; bringing the
comfort of a bit of sweet and a smoke.
Men will hail him
him on the back ; and
things will be a little
because he has passed that way.
How much will it cost to make that
trip, do you suppose? Counting the
pittance that the Secretary is paid, and
the cost of the chocolate and the ciga
rettes and all?
- Five dollars? Twenty-five dollars?
I do not know.
But whether it' is five dollars or
twenty-five, Vf like to think that it is
my five or twenty-five wouldn't you?
That some night when it's cold and lone
some, my money and yours might send a
Secretary out along that frontlinetrench.
Let's make up our minds that we are
going to pay for a score of those trips.
A score of the nights this winter shall be
our nights
nights when the boys greet joy
ously the chocolate and cigarettes that
our money provided; and are happier
because our representative has passed.
