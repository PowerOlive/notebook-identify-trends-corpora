The "BetterBabies" movement is a movement toward the improvenment of childrenby means of baby shows where babies are judged according to their qhysical condition rather than accordingto their beauty.. Hundreds of theseshows are being held in the UnitedStates this year, and m case the children are judged precisely as live stockis judged according to a strict scorecard prepared by eminent physicians.Of course the most important part ofthese shows is the opportunity they afford for distributing among motherspractical scientific suggestions for the'care of children. This is being donewith thoroughness and great success.In the report of the August Woman's Home Companion entitled, "Better Babies in Cities," there is an account of two successful contests organized and managed by women ofIowa. Following is an extract fromthe report of the Knoxville show:"The final feature proved trulydramatic. First the physicians hadfound a perfect baby, Sidney JuneChastain, aged twenty-five months, sonof a successful young business manand a mother who springs from fineGeorgia stock, an ideal American boy.When the youngster was pronouncedperfect half a dozen medical men tookhim in charge and put him through asecond and more rigid examination.But there was no shaking that firstverdict. Sidney June Chastain hadscored the maximum possibility on theBetter Babies Score Card, one thousand points, one hundred per cent."It was hard for physicians and committee members to keep the secret, butthe feat was accomplished, and whenthe announcement was made in connection 'with the prize award, applauseshook the building. Sidney and hisproud but astonished parents wereasked to come to the platform so thatthe audience could look the hundredper cent, baby over. The little lad received not only the first cash prize inhis class but two silver mugs, one presented by the Woman's Anti-TuberculosisLeague, the other by the Woman s Home Companion, in recognitionof the fact that Sidney wa sthe firstchild to reach the standards of weightsand measurements set in the BetterBabies Standard Score Card."SPECIAL TRAIN EXCURSIONCINCIIMNATfl AND RETURNSunday, 3$1 .25iwiSTOSml$1 .2.5RoundTripuRoundTripSPECIAL TRAINLeaves GEORGETOWN 7:45amASK TICKET AGENT FOR PARTICULARS.GEO, W.

And this is exactly what was done.The Chairman of the Board lastThursday inquired publicly of theDemocratic Commissioner of Election,this partisan of Dundon and O'Brien,whether he and the RepublicanElection Commisioner had agreed tostand together on the officers of election for the various polls and thisDemocratic Commissioner, a partisanof Dundon and O'Brien, admitted publicly that they had. In fact the listJiad already been made out by thetwo in writing. So, the scheme wascommenced last summer to get in apartisan of Dundon and O'Brien to fillthe office of Democratic Election Commissioner of Bourbon County upon thetheory that he and the RepublicanElection Commissioner, who was hostile to Hinton and McMillan, wouldput their heads together and work together, .has turned out just as we expected and as we predicted. ThisDemocratic Election Commissionernd this hostile Repblican ElectionCommissioner have outvoted the Sheriff and put in the list of officers already agreed upon by them and reduced to writing before the meeting.But will the voters of BourbonCounty permit politicians to thwartthe will of the people even thoughthey commenced so far ahead as inthis? There is no question in themkid of any well informed Democratthat amajority of the Democratsof Bourbon County are in favor of abha&ge in the office of County Judgeand every Democrat should see to itthat the majority shall control thisibm&, and that there is a fair deal givgn. each candidate at the polls. ,iUnited we Standif UD&E ARE YOU) 1 g JAozCO) Um ' VS2-ffizmJf a V fiZ v LInrvx e"-v LA y I A if 1 ytj,1A-ori fj If V t h'ctWj jPOLITICSThe honest and straightforward farmer has little conception of the wilesof politicians. He has little idea howfar ahead politicians look in order toplay a trick. As far back as August,1912,before Mr. Dundon and Tlr.O'Brien publicly announced for office,we find a list of five" names being certified to Frankfort as though done in ameeting of the Democratic CountyCommittee (whereas fourteen of fifteenof the twenty members signed a statement that there was no such meeting),and we find all five of the men whosenames are so certified, for Dundon andO'Brien. From this list the Democratic Election Commissioner of Bourbon county was to be and was select-ed, and of course this resulted in a par -tisan of Dundon and O'Brien gettingthe office.Of course, this scheme would nothave been set on foot long ahead ofthiselection if it had not been a greatadvantage to Dundon and O'Brien tohave this thing done. The object ofall this plot was to get an ElectionCommissioner who wouldhp n Tin.rf.i-san of Dundon and O'Brien, and whowould appoint partisans of Dundonand O'Brien such voting precincts inBourbon county as it might be important to have their partisans to fill thebooths.A few weeks ago it was noisedIt certainly would be an unfortunate FROM AN OLD TURNPIKE MAN.thing for Bourbon county it Judge , , , : . , . .,,- . . , . i n. i ,iA great deal has been said m the pa-Dundon should by any sleight-of-hand ' ers&about the tturnpikes in BourbonJ in politics be re-elected. He wouldI certainly be justified in believing thatJ J'nfliic mflnnpfATtiPTit nf fho fnrnnilroB nfBourbon county. He would be boundto conclude that the condition of- theturnpikes of Bourbon county was satisfactory or that the voters of Bourboncounty do not care a continentalwhether e keeps up the turnpikes ofBourbon county or notand either conclusion would certainly be a calamityto the people of Bourbon county.Do you want Judge Dundon in officefour years more under the impressionthat the people of Bourbon county arecontent with the turnpikes of Bourboncounty, and that he can go along inthe same old way another four years,letting the turnpikes go down, downand down as they have been duringhis eight years' administration?Where a County Judge does notcome to his office before Q or 1 0or 1 1 o'clock in the morning andthen has his private law business toattend to, has he really time to fillthe office of County Judge furtherthan to draw the salary?If you live in town or on some favored pike near Paris you may notknow the condition of the miles andmiles of turnpike in Bourbon countywhich your fellow-citizens have totravel. If you do not travel yourself,call up some of the people in the county precincts and acquaint yourselfwith how Judge Dundon has discharged his duty with reference to theturnpikes of Bourbon county beforeyou undertake next Saturday to givehim your support and the approval ofyour vote.Bigtit Years Bad Roads- Try. J?our Years.Divided we Fall"-about that an effort would be made toexpose this plot before the State Election Commission at FrankDrt, and tohave the appointment set aside,whereupon Dundon and O'Brien tookpassage together in an automobile toFrankfort to prevent any change beingmade. They wanted the advantagewhich this scheme had worked forrheri.At one time, that is, several yearsago, they held themselves out as enemies one to the other, but when lastsummer a chance arose to get something done to help Dundon andO'Brien jointly in their coming election (in the way of sending names of1 five persons for Dundon and O'Brienonly) they eembraced and made - up.Dundon may be trying to look like hedoesn't know O'Brien when he ridesout in the county precincts to electioneer, but don't be deceived by appearances. Watch them here on the streeta night or two if you think they arestrangers to each other. They have.yoked up together or their mutual ben1efit, and yet some one living in thecountry who doesn't know what goesweeks ago if O'Brien and Dundon werefriendly! Great Scott! Walk alonthe street some night and see themwith their heads togeth plotting together for their joint benefit.iCOUnty which have gone without re-pairs of .any kind for years; and whichi working of the pike much study. Dur-ing the past six or eight yeads thepike of which I was once president hashad a lot of work done on it at greatexpense to the county.But those in charge did not ditch itor throw the dirt to the center so asto keep the pike from washing, andthe first big ram or two carried intothe branches and bottoms a greaterpart of the materials, and the moneywas thus largely wasted.A great reform is needed in Bourboncounty. The people of Bourbon county are not getting the good that oughtto be gotten from the expenditure oftaxes for roads. The same money,when the work is done right, will accompilsh so much more, and a pikewhen properly built or repaired willlast so much longer than where thesame amount of work is done, and notdone properly or left to wash. Wecertainly need a radical change in themanagement of our roads.RespectfuHy,OLD PIKE MAN.BIG PREMIUMS OFFERED IN.SADDLE AND HARNESS CLASSES.Attractive premiums calculated tobring into the show ring some of thebest harness and saddle horses in thecountry are offered by the BourbonCounty Agricultural Society on thesecond day of the fair which beginsAugust 19th and will continue for fivedays. The entries will embrace someof finest productions of this section ofKentucky. The awjards in Class A. ofthe Babies Health Exhibit, given underthe auspices of the Babies' HealthLeague, will be made on the secondday of the fair. 29-tfC. A. McMillanTHE TURNPIKES,Several weeks ago the News, upongetting the information that JudgeDundon was dodging' his responsipihtyfor the condition of the turnpikes bytelling the voters throughout thecounty thaMie was not at all responsi- joie, out tnat tne Magistrates alonewere responsible for the condition ofthe turnpikes, we called the attentionof our readers to a decision of theCuort of Appeals of this State holding hat the County Judge is responsible and may be indicted, for the turnpikes being out of order. We offered,in the event that anyone challengedthe correctness of our.statement, toprocure at our own expense a copy ofthe decision of the Court of Appealsand publish it in full, but nobody, noteven Judge Dundon or his friends, hascome forward to question our statement.because they know that it cannotbe questioned. They know that wehave the record on them and can qroduce the record. We accordinglytrust that no voter of Bourbpn county.will any longer be misled by this effortto dodge the responsibility for the condition of the turnpikes in Bourboncounty. The law holds him responsible and the voters of Bourbon countywill hold him responsible for the condition of the turnpikes.o-FIRST DAY OF FAIR WILLBE THE BEST IN HISTORY.The first day of the Bourbon Fair,which will begin August 19th promises to be the best in the history ofthe agricultural organization. Theopening day'will have its usual featurethe exhibition of ponies which hasalways heretofore proved a drawing'card.

In addition to this feature, many other noless attractive will attend the opening.A departure from the usual custom,and an attraction that promises to bequite interesting, will be the cakewalk for colored people on the' afternoon of the opening day. Other features will be the ring for harness andsaddle horses, roadsters and colts. Aspecial-premium of $50 divided intothree monies, will be offered on theopening day for the best stalk ofgreen tobacco grown in Bourboncounty. 29-tfEvery tax-payer in Bourbon countyshould condemn the present administration for its neglect of the turnpikesand its waste of the public moneyand vote for a change in the administration.

Everybody by the nameof "Perry" will be invited to this sue-3) i cial entertainment and those who expect to attend are requested to notifyEdwin Perry at the Louisville headquarters. The Kentucky Association, whichhas in charge the Louisville celebration, has given an order for a quarterof a million ancestry certificates to behandsomely engaved, and which willbe filled in and given away as souvenirs to descendants of Kentucky soldiers and sailors of the War of 1812.Another entertainment in their honor will be a mammoth reception, atwhich refreshments will be served andopportunity provided for public addresses. For the few remaining actualsons and daughters a banquet will begiven. A great ball will be given inthe First Regiment Armory, which hasa capacity of 20,000 for them.Forty per cent of the white malepopulation of Kentucky engaged in theWar of 1812, consequently forty percent of the succeeding generation werereally sons and daughters of that war,and, estimating that one-half of themintermarried with families which didnot participate in the war, sixty percent of the third generation weregrandchildren of the war, and in similar manner at least seventy-five percent and probably as high as ninetyper cent of the fourth and incomingfifth generations are descendants ofKentuckians who fought in that war.It is estimated that in the state ofKentucky alone one million men, women and children, are eligible to participate in the proposed reunion, and itis estimated that another million nowliving outside of Kentucky are eligibleto participate.During the week, of the celebrationin Louisville spectacular free events,including features on a mammothscale not heretofore given with anyAmerican celebration, will be providedevery afternoon and evening. Pilgrimages to notable historic scenes of interest may be made in the mornings.In addition to free attractions therewill be scores "of the highest pricedamusement concessions that can be secured on the American continent.The railroads in a radius of 500miles of Louisville have been askedto make a rate for the celebrationweek and immediately preceding andfollowing that week of one cent a mile.Railroads running out of Louisvilleprobably will give low rates to otheipoints in Kentucky, so that formeiKentuckians who live a great distancecan visit their old homes as well asattend the Louisville celebration.Local committees are preparing an1812 museum, in which they solicit theloan of any souvenir or relic of theWar of 1812, providing the transporttation at their expense, and guaranteeing that articles loaned for theweek will be returned to owners. Thismuseum for the time being will undoubtedly be the most valuable collection in America.Cortis&Overbys.Business Men's Barber Shop,(Next to Bouibon Bank) t- CHAIRS3HotExpert BarbersPolite Attentionand Cold Baths atHoursNo Long Waits.iMlixt4 .1 Per Cent Interestr.aid On 4hbDepositsYour Deposits Are GuaranteedYOU TAKE NO RISKS.If You Are InterestedWrite UsONION STATE BANKMuskogee, OklahomaA Share of the?
