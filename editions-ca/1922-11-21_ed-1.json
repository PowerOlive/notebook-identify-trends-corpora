The tower of Babel is the tower
spoken of in Genesis as being bult by
mankind after they came down from
the ark to the plain from the moun
tain of the east. It was like the later
temple tower of Babylon, except that
It was being constructed so high that
Its top might reach Heaven. The
builders were miraculously prevented
by the confounding of their la'nguage.
Thus the origin of bur many tongues.

Concerning Compensation.
"What Is this Emersonian compensa
tion we hear so much about?" asked
the Inquisitive Person. "That," said
the Cynical Philosopher, "Is the doc
tripe that things are never sp bad as
they seem, because there are always
mitigating circumstances. Compensa
tion Is the principle, active in the
world, whereby you get a ride to the
hospital in the ambulance that
knocked you down."

PLEASANT SOCIAL AFFAIE FOE
STUDENTS
' Twenty-five young men and wo
men, members of the Fidelis Class
'of the Baptist Sunday School, and
'of the Senior 13. Y. P. XL, formed a
merry crowd wfib stormed the
Nurses' Home of the Massie Memo
rial Hospital to spend the hours
from eight to ten with the six
young women who are taking the
nurses' training course at that in
stitution. "
The majority of the student
nurses were strangers in Paris, and
the courtesy extended at this time
was at a most opportune time, be
ing not only an introduction into a
pleasant circle,, but mutual friend
ships" were formed which will even
tually,, result in other happy even
ings. Fruit punch was served 'by
Mrs. Christian., and the young
people had taken with them home
made candies, fruits and nuts. The
success of the evening was due
largely to the efforts of Mrs. Albert
Mitchell, the efficient teacher of the
young ladies' class.

The greenest grass in the world Is
what visitors say of the lawns in Den

velvety appearance is not
-some hokus pokus of gardeners to fool
tourists, but Is due to the"acrion of the
mineral salts in the soil.

WEDNESDAY
MY MORNING WALK TO WORK.
I saw a flock of pigeons,
All blue and mauve and brown,
Sail gleaming in the shining air
Like jewels in a crown.
I saw a charming little child,
With gold all-through her hair,
Win smiles from evn dour old men
Because she was so fair.
The yellow train went sweeping by,
Away o'er dale and hill
I envied it, the rushing trip
Through autumn air, so crisp aad
chill.
And many other pleasant sights
The morning walk did thus be
guile, It seemed an almost cruel- thing
A desk at the end of the mile.
Folks are enjoined to give until
it hurts, but few persons suffer
pain on account of their charity.
