He was at Dayton during the disas

disaster. He and his wife and little
child were marooned in an attic from
early Tuesday morning until Friday af
ternoon, and some of the fires that 'oc
curred were in his i eighborhood. They
were without fire during the entire
time and had butjittle to eat and no
drinking water. He says the descrip
tions given by the newsDapers were
not overdrawn, and it will be impossi
ble to know how many lives were lost
as hundreds of bodies floated away in
the swift current.
Miss Elizabeth Dickson has resigned

deserving of any support that may be
rendered him.

Small Home Sites Now Available in
Bethlehem Place.- Watch fln.
nouncement for Date of
Sale.
-
Higher prices are" being paid for
Bourbon farms than ever before, the
size of the farm seeming to cut but lit
tle figure.
Small farms of from one to three and
a half acres, close to the Paris city
limits have never been on the market,
and people with but sufficient means to
buy small farms have had to look else
where, as no one seemed disposed to
divide their farms into small tracts.
This condition of affairs has at last
been temporarily relieved by Messrs.
McCarney, Miller and Lilleston, of
Tans, who have subdivided 23 acres of
land in the rear of the Bourbon Fair
Grounds into fourteen home sites-, each
containing from three-quarters of an
acre to three and a half acres, to be
known as "Bethlehem Place."
"Bethlehem Place" is located on the
Bethlehem pike, within two blocks of
the Interurban car line, in the five
cent limit of Paris. The rear of the
property is near the Clintonville pike,
and close to the South yards of the L.
& N. Railroad.
This soil is deep, and in a high state
Of Cultivation. Each site is wpII rlrnin-
Jed, and has a liberal frontaze on the
Bethlehem pike, one of the main
thoroughfares of the county.
The owners of "Bethlehem Place"
have srreat confidence in thp future f
Paris, and they believe that the division
of this land into small home sites will
prove extremely popular.
Watch newspapers for announcement
of date of sale.

Civil Service Plan to Favor Dem
ocrats. 'Democratic Jmembers of Ccngreps
who have talked recently with Presi
dent Wilson Zand Postmaster General
Burleson about the appontment ofjposr
masters believe that the new Jadminis
tration will scon announce a plan
which will result in the displacement
of Republicans by Democrats in most
of the postoffices of the country.
It is expected that most offices now
under the civil service will be declared
vacant by President Wilson and that
civiljservice examination will be held
to fill the vacancies.
The three applicants passing the
best examinations will then be certifi
ed as eligible for appointment. From
these three the Congressman frnm th
district in which the office is located
will be Dermitted to make a selection,
linearly every instance.it is believed,
aieast one Democrat will be among
the three eligibles.

Mrs. Fiske at Lexington Tonight
Tonight Mrs. Fiske and the Man
hattan Company will enme to the Lex
ington Opera Houe in "The High
Road," Edward Sheldon's latest play.
Lexington has always a warm welcome
for Mrs. Fiske, and there ia lively in
terest in her new play. It is said for
Mr. Sheldon that'hfl has selected for
hs theme one that is both novel and
opportune. It concerns the nistory of
a woman of most unhappy childhood,
whose heart and soul were of great
natural capacities, but were starved
by early restrictions and cruelties.
She accepts what thelworld holds out
to her, but finds after a : time thai it
does not satisfy and there follows- "a
klchu awaKening wnicn sweerjs her on
to a moral victory over herself and a
career of vast usefulness to others.
The character of Mary Page, around
whom the story revolves, is one emi
nently suited to Mrs. Fiske. and one in
which she has achieved one of the
most striking triumphs of her brilliant
career
