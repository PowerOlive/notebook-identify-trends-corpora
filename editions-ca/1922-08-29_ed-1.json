TUESDAY
It's a Goldwyn Picture
TUESDAY
noon, by the score of 5 to 4. Cyn
thiana secured the first run in the
second inning, and added four in the
jfifth. while Paris scored one in the
'wgSihaand three in the ninth. Bai
ley, pitching for Cynthiana, was ef
fective until the ninth inning, when"
he weakened and allowed three hits
and a base on balls for three runs.
Long replaced him and walked Val
entine. Blakefield batted for Fin
'neran, and with one strike and two
balls Monhollen replaced Long. The
game was not one to excite a great
deal of enthusiasm, but it lasted
long enough to demonstrate the fact
that Paris needs a little more pep.
The batteries were: For Paris
Valentine and Macke; for Cynthi
ana Monhollen, Long, Bailey and
Barker. The game was witnessed
by a large crowd of Paris fans, who
fondly hoped they would get revenge
for the 8 to 2 trimming of the day
previous. Time of game, 2:25.
Triebel umpired.
"Eight to two in favor of Cyn
thiana" was the legend hung up on
the score boards and bulletin boards
as the result of Saturday's game at
League Park, between Paris and
Cynthiana. The game was one of
the poorest played on the local lot
this season, each team making six
errors. Oynthiana's misplays, how
ever, were not so costly as those of
the league leaders. Long was very
effective with men on bases, while
Blakefield was unable to check the
visitors in critical places in the
early innnings. One of the features
'of the game was a sensational run
ning catch of a hard hit fly ball,
by Woods, of the Paris team. Seitz,
Cynthiana second baseman, laced
the ball for a home run. Blakefield
held the visitors to six hits. The
game went two hours and twenty
minutes. Bailey and Finnery um
pired. The batteries were: For
Cynthiana Long and Barker; for
Paris Brakefield and Macke.

Blue Grass League, the Maysville
Bulletin of Saturday, says:
"The Lexington newspapers Thurs
day, heralded the fact that Mr.
Thomas M. Russell had resigned as
president of the Bluegrass League.
Mr. Russell did offer his resignation
at a meeting of the club owners in
Lexington Wednesday night, but the
magnates refused to release Mr. Rus
sell from the duties of his office, so
it was up to Tom to retain his posi
tion or see the Bluegrass circut
continue without a leader. Mr.
Russell said this morning that the
owners declined to even consider his
resignation and that he would
doubtless, under the circumstances,
finish the season as head of the
Bluegrass loop."
ENJOYABLE TIME FOR TELE

Dr. W. C. Ussery, of Paris, is be
ing "prominently mentioned" in
connection with the presidency of
the Blue Grass League, made vacant
by the recent resignation of Thomas
M. Russell, of Maysville. No better
selection could be made. Dr. Ussery
'was president of the old Blue Grass
League, where he demonstrated his
ability and a thorough knowledge of
the game. Lexington and Maysville
"hogged" everything in sight when
the new league was organized. Now
it is time for Paris to get into the
game by putting forth Dr. Ussery
as the logical selection for preident.

Thos. M. Russell as president of the
