the effect that the Spanish flyingsquadron had arrived at Cadiz SpainThe safety of the Oregon from attackis now completely assured and the wayis clear for military operations in Cubawithout running

to do this oursailors must make up their minds togo after the Spaniards a task verymuch more difficult than that of meeting them near our own shores It wassuggested by some of the members ofthe war board that there was just apossibility that the Spanish squadronmight make a quick passage mto thePacific through the Suez canal and attack Dewey at Manila It is said thatcontrary to the common understanding the Suez canal is open to thewar ships of belligerent powers sothat if the Spanish choose to take thiscourse they would have a long start ofany pursuing fleet from our side of

anothersound came from the top of the hillon the side of the hamlet the trampof horses galloping Almost at thesame time a pistol shot flash and report came from the hedge side Andthat was plainly the last signal ofdanger for the buccaneers turned atonce and ran separating in every direction one seaward along the coveone slant across the hill and so on sothat in half a minute not a sign of

then the noise of horses toppedthe rise and four or live riders camein fvight in the moonlight and sweptat full gallop down the slopeAt this Pew saw his error turnedwith a scream and ran straight for

went Pew with a cry thatrang high into the night and the fourhoofs trampled and spurned him andpassed by He fell on his side thengently collapsed upon his face andmoved no moreI leaped to my feet and hailed theriders They were ipulling up at anyrate horrified at the accident and Isoon saw what they were One tailing out behind the rest was a lad thathad gone from the hamlet to Dr Liveseyss the rest were revenue officerswhom he had met b3 the way and withwhoin he had had the intelligence to re-i jturn at once Some news of the lugger inKitt r Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and sent him forth thatnight in our direction and to that circumstance my mother and 1 owe ourpreservation from deathPew was dead stone dead As formy mother when we had carried herup to the hamlet a little cold waterand salts very soon brought her backagain and she was none the worse forhpr trrnr TirmnrTi cVir c ill nnniinnoflto deplore the balance of the moneyIn the meantime the supervisor rodeon as fast as he could to Kitts Holebut his men had to dismount and gropedown the dingle leading and sometimes supporting their horses and incontinual fear of ambushes so it wasno great matter for surprise that whenwe got down to the Hole tne luggerwas already under way though stillclose in He hailed her A voice replied telling him to keep out of themoonlight or he would get some leadin him and at the same time a bulletwhistled close by his arm Soon afterthe lugger doubled the point and disappeared Mr Dance stood there ashe said like a fish out of water andall he could do was to dispatch a manto P to warn the cutter Andthat said he is just about as good asnothing Theyve got off clean andtheres an end Only he added Imglad I trod on Master Pews cornsfor by tkis time he had heard my storyI went back with him to the AdmiralBenbow and you cannot imagine ahouse in such a state of smash thevery clock had been thrown down bythese fellows in their furious hunt aftermy mother and myself and thoughnothing had actually been taken awayexcept the captains money bag and alittle silver from the till I could seeat once that we were ruined Mr Dancecould make nothing of the sceneThey got the money you sayWell then Hawkins1 what in fortunewere they after More money I supposeNo sir not money I think repliedT In fact sir I believe I have thething in my breast pocket and to tellyou the truth I should like to get itput in safetyTo be sure boy quite right saidhe Ill take it if you likeI thought perhaps Dr Livesey IbeganPerfectly right he interruptedvery cheerily perfectly right a gentleman and a magistrate And now Icome to think of it I might as well rideround there myself and report to himor squire Master Pews dead whenalls done not that I regret it but hesdead you see and people will make itout against an officer of his majestysrevenue if make it out they can NowIll tell you Hawkins if you like Illtake you alongI thanked him heartily for the offer and we walked back to the hamletwhere the horses were By the time Ihad told mother of my purpose theywere all in the saddleDogger said Mr Dance you havea good horse take up this lad behindyouAs soon as I was mounted holding onto Doggers belt the supervisor gavethe word and the party struck out ata bouncing trot on the road to DrLivcseys houseCHAPTER VITHE CAPTAINS PAPERSWe rode hard all the way till we drewup before Dr Liveseys door Thehouse was all dark in frontMr Dance told me to jump down andknock and Dogger gave me a stirrupto descend by The door was openedalmost at once by the maidIs Dr Livesey in I askedNo she said he had come home in theafternoon but had gone up to the hallto dine and pass the evening with thesquireSo there we grov bpvs saidJMrDanced rSStlSsmSHkThis time as thedlstahce was shortI did not mount but ran with Doggersstirrup leather to the lodge gates and iup the long leafless moonlit avenue towhere the white line of the Hall buildings looked on either hand on great oldgardens Here Mr Dance dismountedand taking me along with him was admitted at a word into the houseThe servant led us down a mattedpassage and showed us at the end intoa great library all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of themwhere the squire and Dr Livesey satpipe in hand on either side of thebright lireI had never seen the squire so nearat hand ne was a tall man over sixfeet high and broad in proportion andhe had abluff rough-and-ready face allroughened and reddened and lined inhis long travels His eyebrows werevery black and moved readily and thisgave him a look of some temper notbad you would say but quick andhighCome in Mr Dance says he verstately and condescendingGood evening Dance says the doctor with a nod And good evening toyou friend Jim What good windbrings you hereThe supervisor stood up straight andstiff and told his story like a lessonand you should have seen how the twogentlemen leaned forward and lookedat each other and forgot to smoke intheir surprise and interest When theyheard how my mother went back to theinn Dr Livesey fairly slapped histhigh and the squire cried Bravoand broke his long pipe against thegrate Long before it was done MrTrelawney that 3011 will rememberwas the squires name had got upfrom his seat and was striding aboutthe room and the doctor as if to hearthe better had taken off his powderedwig and sat there looking very strangeindeed with his own close croppedblack pollAt last Mr Dance finished the storyMr Dance said thesquire yousire a very noble fellow And as for ridingdown that black atrocious miscreant I regard it as an act of virtuesir -like stamping on a cockroach Thislad Hawkins is a trump I perceiveHawkins will you ring that beil MrDance must have some aleAnd so Jim said the doctor youhave the thing that they were afterhave youHere it is sir saidl and gave himthe oilskin packetThe doctor looked it all over as if hislingers were itching to open it but instead of doing that he put it quietly inthe pocket of his coatSquire said he when Dance hashad his ale he must of course be offon his majestys service but I meanto keep Jim Hawkins heTe to sleep atmy house and with your permission Ipropose we should have up the cold pieand let hini supAs you willLivescysaad the squireHawkins has earned better than coldpieSo a big pigeon pie was brought inand put on a side table and I made ahearty supper

is agreeable well openthe packet and he laid it before himon the tableThe bundle was sewn together andthe doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stifches with hismedical scissors It contained twothings a book and a sealed paperFirst of all well try the book observed the doctorThe squire and I were both peeringover his shoulder as he opened it forDr Ln esev had kindlv motioned me

unintelligible I could not helpwondering who it was that had gotitt and what itt was that he gotA knife in his back as like as notNot much instruction there saidDr Livesey as he passed onThe next ten

church was sweet withthe perfume of flowers for it was childrens Sunday roses S3ringa jonquils from the farmhouse gardensferns and clematis from the woodsThe pulpit covered with a mass ofgreenish white clematis rose from abank of ferns On a little stand at theside some one had placed a huge vasefilled with mountain fringe and thelong delicate stems loaded withbling pink blossoms moved softly

been inthe town less than a week 1 boardedthat summer with the Jehoram EenJiels They were always spoken of inthat way to distinguish them from thefamily of Jehorams brother SilasAfter dinner I went out to sit on thebig front dour step There was a trellis built over this step covered withvoodbine and barring the occasional-descent from this of a harmless greenpider it was quite the pleasantestXlace about the house I had a magazine in my hands but it had been somuch more satisfactory merely to leanback against the trellis and gaze offever the huge valley and the roll of hillsbeyond that I had done nothing butthis when Mrs Jehoram Fennel havingcleared away the dinner and washed thedishes drew a cane seat rocking chairinto the front hall and sat down to joinme Her husband had already retiredto the one bit of daytime rest which hishng hard days work allowed him andhis regular and not-too-loud-for-com-fort breathing from the lounge in tfcsitting room showed how thorpughlyhe was enjoying itMrs Fennel brought with her a palmleaf fan and the last number of a religious paper She had never read anything but religious literature on Sunday and I fancied she looked somewhataskance now at the magazine in myhandsPerhaps it was to prepossess herUgainst mjr evident intention to readthis by showing what good attentionI had paid in church that I hastened tosayWhat in the world made them namethat fourth baby in the row S3ringaMrs Fennel Suck a f unny name for alaby After all though its rather apretty nameJlMrs Fennel gave a little chuckle andsaid Oh thats the Elton

Fennel wasthe proud possessor of four SophieAnn was an only child an she was alwajs brung Up to have her own wayin they say that when it came to namm the baby although Mis Fosdick wasdead set ou callin it Charlotte PameliaSophie Ann jest stuck to it that she wassigoin to name it Syringa May after thelushe mat was in blossom about theirhouse an call it Syringa May she didWhen I decided to return to PebblyCenter the next summer and wrote toMrs Jehoram Fennel to see if she couldJjoard me I was disappointed to findtliat shroutU not The four grand-ehildren were now five and the motherf three of thcm war coming home to Ispend the summer After the crampedchirography of Mrs Fennel had explained this she addedI think you could get boarded at theFosdick place if you want to The baby Isover a year old now and they are all quitesmart there and Mrs Fosdick said something to that effect one day when she wasin here If you would like to have meI will run over and see her about itAs a result of her intercession Ispent my second summer in PebblyCenter in the Fosdick home finding itan exceedingly pleasant place to liveSyringa was now running all aboutthe place She was very pretty with adelicate fairness though she was apparently perfectly strong Her fatherwas a good honest young farmer andif Sophie Ann her mother had alwaysbeen allowed to have her own waj theresult did not seem to have been unfortunate since she was as pleasant andcapable a young woman as could havebeen imaginedThat winter I went abroad and remained four years The first summerafter I came back I thought of my oldfriends at Pebbly Center and decidedthat I would like to go among themonce more I had heard nothing fromthem in all this time however and asI learned that Pebbty Center was nowsomething of a summer town I thoughtbest to go at first directly to the hotelwhich had been built there and thenif I wished to do so change my stopping-placelaterFive years had brought manychanges in the town which I noticedwhen after supper I walked over to theFosdick farmI found Mrs Fosdick just washingup the supppr dishes in the sink in theback kitchen When she heard mystep on the wooden floor she

send you a plan of a rack in whichI feed corn fodder and all and hayto cattle The rack is set in blue grasspasture where cattle are being fed Ido not full feed in winter so in the fallI bring my racks in and line them upen the southeast side of sheds groveetc I then set posts all around themabout two and one half or three feetapart I use fence rails as they areeheap and abundant and answer everypurpose The posts ought not to extendmore than one and one half or two feetabove the top of the trough on the sidewhere feed is put in from sled or lowwheeled wagon My method of feedingcattle is to buy light well bred younganimals in the fall and winter themstrong About May or when the grassis good 1 move these same troughs backtcTthe summer feeding grounds and giveone good feed per day of broken snappedcorn The object of this plan of winterfeeding is to keep the cattle themselvesHrirt1tMUEXCELLENT FEEDING RACKfrom soiling the feed by tramping andespecially to keep the hogs off of itT

usualmeasured there is nothing handierxlian bushel boxes as they are calledbut which arc really crates These maybe made by anyone who is handy withn saw and hammer and cost so littlethat any farmer can afford to supplyhimself with them They are furnishedknocked down by several firms in thecountry but they can be made at homejust as well and at less costThey are usually made of basswoodor elm boards sawed from one half tothree eighths of an inch thick by threeinches wide for the sides and bottomand inch boards are used for the endsTo make them take an inch boardthat is a foot wide and cut it into pieces14 inches long For the sides and bottom cut the strips isys inches longThese when nailed together make abox 1G inches long 14 inches wide and12 inches deep which will hold a bushelof potatoes when level fullWhen digging potatoes or gatheringapples tomatoes turnips or other suchthings the boxes can be hauled to thefield filled set in tiers on the wagonand taken to the house and unloaded invery much less time than it would taketo load and unload without them Whenhauling to market the boxes comehandy and a big load can be put on andunloaded in a very short time and ifthey are properly made and filled theygive the product a nice appearance thatgoes a long way toward making agood sale for themIt will be foundon figuring the contents of the box as above given that itholds more than a half bushel measuretwice full This allows for the customary heaping measure that is required tomake CO pounds the standard weightfor a bushel of potatoes In some statesthere is a standard weight for applesalso about 50 pounds to the bushelOne who begins to use these bushelboxes are rarely willing to dispensewith them Farmers VoiceRuts and Mud HolesThe only difficulty in the way of having good dk t roads all the time is tokeep out the water It is first the narrow-tiredwagons and then water thatmakes ruts and mud holes If broadtired wagons were used and the waternot permitted to run along the roadwayor stand on the surface there will be noruts or mud holes How can these evilsbe prevented By having the road properly drained and graded with a machine permitting only wide tires onheavy wagons then by constant workarc watch every day in the year rainydays most of ail prevent the formingof ruts and the beginning of mud holesSuch means and method will make goodroads most of the time and at minimum cost WorldSPECIAL DAIRY COWSThey Are an Absolute Necessity fotlie Economical and Steady Production of Prime ButterWe must all recognize the fact thatthe cow is the foundation for the dairyShe is the machine with which the dairysaan does his work The machine bywhich he nroduees milk and butterShe takes the raw materials the hayCan corn oats bran etc and converts theminto the finished product Of courseshe is more than a mere machine as shereproduces her kind as well assustains her life But aside from thesefunctions her value is confined to herpower to manufacture milk This being the case the dairyman in selectinga cow is concerned in the selection of ananimal which is most efficient in thisproductive power The manufacturerin selecting machinery for his factorychooses that best adapted for the intended work Economy and efficiencyare the qualities desired that machinewhich will produce the most and bestwork with the least waste of fuel andenergy The farmer or dairyman is astruly a manufacturer as the man making cloth tools or clothing llis farmis his factory and his cows his machinery by which he works the raw material of his farm into milk butter orcheese The same principles governingthe selection of machinery in the factory should govern the selection of hiscows He wants for the economicalproduction of milk the cow that willproduce the greater profit the cowthat will produce the most and bestmilk at the least cost In other wordsthe cow especially adapted to the production of butter 1 he special purposwcow The old fallacy of a double purpose cow is giving way before the demands of more scientific methods offarming although she still has earnestadherents Not but they admit that thespecial beef animal will produce moreand cheaper beef and the special dairycow will produce butter at a less costthan the general purpose cow the claimbeing that there is greater profits fromcombining the two We suppose theadherents to this idea would advocatethe use of the old fashioned combinedreaper and mower for grain and grassThe reaper with the rake or dropperwould not be as efficient in the grainfield as the improved self binders northe mower as economical in time andhorse power as the ball bearing mowerof present date neverthelessone machine could be uj cd for both purposesAny up-to-date farmer would scoff atthe idea of such a machine on his farmyet the same man will cling to the notion that the double purpose cow is themost profitable And why Simply because in the one case the advantage ofthe special machine is easily apparentwhile in the other case he has not takenthe trouble to know through investigation the value of one cow over anotherBut the successful dairyman of the future is going to be driven to a more intimate knowledge of his cows He willbe compelled to exercise the most careful judgment in selecting a cowthatproduce butter at the greatest netprofit Loose and indifferent methodsin all departments of farming must besupplanted by the intelligent application of the most approved tools andmethods Dairying is no exceptionThe dairyman of the future must ofnecessity we predict manufacture hisbutter

including manyhorses driven to hacks and other publiocarriages are ordinarily shod once amonth at a cost of 2 50 so that thework horses shoes are likely to cost30 a year anyway and there may besome additional expense for sharpeningand resettingSharpening costs 150 Whether thisis necessary or not depends of courseprimarily upon the weather It may depend much upon the time of day thehorse is driven There may be seasonsin which sharpening is not necessaryNot all drivers get the shoes of theirhorses sharpened even when the goingis slippery Such going may come aboutsuddenly and unexpectedly and it maybe of brief duration and then there aredrivers who under ordinary circumstances take the risk of the greater costof a broken shaft or an injured animalto save the cost of sharpening Of workhorses in general probably somethingmore than half have their shoes sharpened when the going is slippery Thereare some however whose shoes are almost all kept sharpened at such timesthese being the horses that work atnight and in the early morning beforethe sun has softened the ice or meltedit away These include horses drivento milk wagons bakers horses and soon how often the shoes are sharpeneddepending on the goingUsually when a horse is shod he isshod all around Sometimes there is occasion to put on a single shoe as whena horse throws a shoe The cost of asingle new shoe is one fourth the costof a set in the case of a work horse 63cents The charge for resecting the oldshoe would be 35 cents Besetting ingeneral from one shoe up costs aboutone half or a little more than half asmuch as fitting a horse with new shoesIn putting on a single shoe an old shoewould commonly be used to make itmatch those remaining on If it is nottoo much worn the shoe the horse hascast would be put back if the driverpicked it up It is suitable and it fitsIf it has not been picked up then aslipper is put on from the pile in theshop slipper being the shop name ofthe worn shoe taken off and thrownaside when a horse is reshodHorses have peculiarities in wearingtheir shoes just as men do Some wearthem off more at the toe some more atthe heel and some wear them more onone side than on the other Horsesshoes wear off more quickly on granitepavements than they do on asphalt andthe greatly increased use of asphaltpavement has led to a correspondinglyincreased use of rubber pads in horsesshoes to give the horses a better foothold Rubber pads as well as the shoesare fitted to the horses foot and nailedon with the shoe Shoes with rubberpads of this kind for work horses costput on 4 or 5 a set They are likelyto wear longer than shoes without padsbutset atty for reshoeing the horse at intervalsof about a month is due in a consideraend of a month when thev aro taU pnoff they are likely to be too much wornto go another month and new shoes areput on In the case of rubber pad shoesif they are not too much worn they arereset and this may be done in perhaps40 or 50 per cent of the cases Sometimes the old shoes may be put backwith new pads sometimes the old padswith new shoes It depends a good dealon the manner in which the horse wearsthem So that while the first cost ofrubber pad shoes is considerably greaterthan that of plain shoes the net cost isnot so much greaterThe price oharged for shoeing a private coach or carriage horse is 1 morethan for shoeing a work horse or 3 50and rubber pad shoes such as those described for carriage horses cost 5 or 6a set Such horses are reshod ordinarilylike most horses once a month and asa rule their shoes are also reset in themiddle of the month And the shoes ofprivate carriage horses are more commonly kept sharpened in slippery weather than are those of work horses Women are more likely to be disturbed bythe slipping of a horse than a manwould be and the carriage horses areusually more valuable than workhorses and less risk of injury is takenIn some cases it might be that thecharge fot shoeing a horse either a carriage horse or a work horse would beaccording to the time required ratherthan by the job as for example inthe case of a lame horse in shoeingwhich more than the usual time wouldbe needed Shoes are made and fittedto meet any requirement and the costmight be according to the amount ofwork and time expended from 1 to 5for a single shoe New York SunThe CriticsFlick Call him a musician TVhyhe doesnt know the
