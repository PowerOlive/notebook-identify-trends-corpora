Such is the explanation, andthe only one, as far as I know, thathas been given, of the meaning of theword Kalamazoo, and the author ofthis remained unknown to me until ashort time ago, when I accidentallydiscovered that it was H. R. Schoolcraft. . . . The fact is that thealleged word riegikanamazoo given bySchoolcraft is a deliberate alterationby him of kikalamazo, written by theFrench at a period when some dialectof Ojibwa, to which the word belongs,was still using the letter 1. It is aslight (very slight) alteration of oldOjibwa kikalamozo, meaning "he is inconvenienced by smoke in his lodge."American Anthropologist.How to Become a Neurasthenic.Eat no breakfast. - Indulge in butone meal daily; at any rate not morethan two.

If they really are good cars, they necessarily cost more because comparatively few are built. Somepoor cars, you know, are high priced too, so that the dealercan fool you by cutting the price. What a car is reallyworth, not what it costs, should be your standard.The Studebaker Corporation has the largest and bestautomobile factories in the world. We could build and sellany competing car today for less money than its present,price. In your Studebaker-E-M-F "30" or Flanders "20"'you get full value, because the biggest factories and thebest brains in the industry build these cars.ftPetruehlo's Character.He is a madman in his senses, aTery honest fellow who speaks hardlya word of truth, and succeeds in allhis tricks and impostures.

Mr. Clay represented Boui-bon ctiunty in the U10 and 1912 sessions of the LgislaCureandthe measurewhich was introduced during the firstvear in office, was defeated. At thetast session of the,-Legislature themeasure Iwas again defeated andthrough his efforts and thp efforts ofI'M?. J. Qiucry Ward, of Paris, whowas appointed by Governor McCrearyas the tiead of the commission, its passage was secured, and the bill becamea law., Mr. Ward was in Ppris Sunday andstated he had outlined the work of theGame and Fish Commission and gaveout the following statement: .' "Game protection in the UnitedStates has developed along somewhatbroader lines than in other countnes.Its object is not only to preserve a fewanimals and birds to furnish sport foia limited class, but to protect the increase useful species for the benefit ofthe people in general."The personale of the, new Gameand Fish Commission guarantees afaithful and efficient enforcement otthe laws of the state, which are designed to preserve not onlv the gamenaimals and game birds, but alsobirds of song and plumage and thosewhich are benafttiil as destroyers ofinjurious insects and noxious weeds.While securing the support of thesportsmen, it benefits the la.mer bvincreasing the species which are usefulto him and commands the interest ofthat ever-increasing class of personswho find health or recreationjin observing or-iStudying nature."With Jthe development of legislation for tne protection of fish and gamehas occurred another development intended to afford greater protection tcland owners and tenants. This legislation tootc the form cf penalties incorporated in the game laws for certain"forms of trespass an3 vandalism Theland owner had, and still retains pract:callv complete control ot the gameon his premises, since he can to a certain extent fix the conditions undeiwhich it shall be taken and has absolute right to say Whether or not itshall be hunted at all, but the facilities for enforcing his desire were ofsuch a personal character that he hesitated taking the vigorous action necessary to gee results. Now, however,with the inauguration of the State Department for the protection of gameand fish, with a svstem of wardensthroughout the state, whose swornduty is to enforce the laws, the activities of those wardens in each county,the policy of publicity and educationof the department and the interest ofthe true sportsman and law abidingcitizen who takes out his license; theenforcement of trespass laws become amatter of course, the riuhts ot property owners is established alike in themind ot the careless ci izen, thethoughtless friend and the vicious lawbreaker.
