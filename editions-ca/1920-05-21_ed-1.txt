Kansas CityStar.The records of the selective draftshow that out of more than 23,000,000 men which is called to theservice of their country that 325,260 men were classified as draft delinquents and deserters. A thoroughinvestigation has been made by theGovernment of each of these caseswith the lesult that 151,354 men.have .been classified as non-willfuldeserters, a-nd these will be givenclean slates after certain formalities. This leaves 173,911 names ofthose classified as "willful deserters." The names of all these will bepublished broadly in order that thestigma of shame may be attached toall such men as failed to heed thecall of their country in time of war.Whatever disposition there may bein official circles to let bygones bebygones is out-weighed by the decision of the War Department thatprosecution in each of these cases isnecessary in order to keep the faithwith the loyal young men of thecountry who did not flinch when thehour for personal sacrifice was atband.

Representatives of the Thoroughbred Horse Association, the American RecountAssociation and the Kentucky Jockey Club wre present, as well alepresentative horse breeders "ofother States and newspaper publishers, all joining in protestagainst the bill.A. J. Carroll, of Louisville, counsel for the Kentucky Jockey Club,,was the principal speaker heforethe House Committee on Interstateand Foreign Commerce. He said .thebill was an entering wedge intendedto' eventually destroy racing in suchStates as now lecognize it as a legitimate sport. He declared that itviolated the freedom of the press;that it is contrary to the doctrineof' State rights; that it means theend of horse breeding, as well as racing, and that it is intended to be theforerunner of other forma of sumptuary legislation.A. B. Hancock, of Paris, vfce-pres-identof the American Remount Association and a director of theThoroughbred Horse Association,said the passage of the pending biliwould probably prove a fatal blowto horse breeding. He showed theeffect it would have on the army byaserting that 95 per cent, of thehorses used in the United Statescavalry are thoroughbreds, "and thatbreeding would be destroyed by thepassage of the bill.Maurice Galvin, of the KentuckyJockey Club, declared that poolroomgamblingon horse racing can bebroken up without federal aid bymeans of State legislation, as hasbeen done in Covington.Desha Breckinridge, editor of TheLexington Herald, filed with thecommittee a letter stating that thepassage of the bill "would be, in myjudgment, a blunder so great as tdamount to a crime," that it wouldbe disastrous to the great horsebreeding industry of Kentucky andlhat there is -no more justificationfor its passage than for the passageof a bill nrohibiting the transmission of news of stock exchangetransactions:Kentucky Congressmen who lenttheir presence in opposition to themeasure were Messrs. Ogden, Rouse.Cantrill, Swope a-nd Barclay, thelatter a member of the committeewhich is considering the bill.r-OMR.
