latterYesVery-well Ill go with you Icouldnt stay last night to have a talkwith vou over the meeting- bu whatdid you think of itWell considering- the articles whichappeared in the morning- and considering also the exhibition I made of myself in attempting- to explain the meritsof themine I think things went offrather smoothlySo do I It doesnt strike you thatthey went off too smoothly does itWhat rla vnn -meanr know exactrffI merely1 wanted to get your opinionabout it You see I have attended agreat many gatherings of this sort andit struck me there was a certain cut-and-meetingI cantsay whether it impressed me favorablyor unfavorably but I noticed itI still dont understand what youmeanWell as a general thing in suchmeetings when a man gets up and proposes a certain action there is someopposition or somebody has a suggestion to make or something better topropose or thinks he has and so thereis a good deal of talk Kow when Kinggot up and proposed calmly that Melville should America it axpearedto me rather an extraordinary thingto do unless he had consulted MelvillebeforehandPerhaps he had done soy Yes perhaps What do you thinkof it allKenyon mused for a moment beforehe replied As I said before I thoughtthings went off very smoothly Whomdo you suspect young LongworthI do not know whom I suspect- Iam merely getting anxious about theshortness of the time I think myselfyou ought to go to America There isnothing to be done here You shouldgo see Von Brent and get a renewalof the option Dont you see that whenthey get over there allowing them a fewdays in New York and a day or two toget out to the mine we shall have littlemore than a week after the cable dispatch comes in which to do anjrthingshould they happen to report unfavorablyYes I see that Still it is only aquestion of facts on which they have toreport and youknow as wTell as I dotliat no truthful men can report unfavorably on what e have stated Wehave understated the case in every instanceI know that I am perfectly wellaware of that Everything is all right ifif is dealing honestlywith us If he is not everything is allwrong and I should feel a great dealeasier if we had in our possession another three months option of the nuncWe are now at the fag end of this option and it seems to me as a protectionto ourselves we ought either to writeto Von Brent by the way have youever written to

second place and then suddenlyde sloped an interestJohn knitted His brows andsaid nothingI dont want to worry you about itbut I do want your candid opinionWhat had we better doIt seems to me said John after apause that we can do nothing It isa very perplexing situation I thinkhowever we should turn it over in ourminds for a few days and then I canget to America in plenty of time if necessaryVery well suppose we give themten days to get to the mine and replyIf no reply comes by the eleventh daythen you will still have eighteen ornineteen days before the option expires Put it at twelve days I propose if you hear nothing by then yougo overRight said John we may takethat as settledBy the way you got an invitationdid you not4Yes -Are you goingI do not know I should like tqgo and yet you know I am entirelyunused to fashionable assemblages 1should not know what to say or dowhile I was thereAs I understand it is not to be nfashionable party but merely a littlefriendly gathering which Miss Longworth gives because her cousinis about to sail for CanadaI dont want to flatter youJohn but I imagine Miss Longorth would be rather disappointed ifyou did not put in appearance Besides as we are partners wit h -Long-worthin this and as he is going awayen account of the mine I think it wouldbe a little ungracious of us not to goVery well 1 will go Shall I callfor you or will ybu come for meI will call for you and we will gethere together in a cab Be ready abouteight oclockThe mansion of the Longworths wasbrilliantly lighted that night and John-felt rather faint hearted as he stoodon the steps before going in Thechances are he would not have had thecourage to announce himself if hisfriend Wentworth had not been withhim George however had no suchqualms and was much more usedtothis kind of thing than his comradeSo they went in together and weivwarmly greeted by the young hostessIt is so kind of you to come shesaid on such short notice 1 I wasafraid you might have had some priorengagement and would have found itimpossible to get hereYou must not think that of mesaid Wentworth I was certain tocome but I must confess my friendKenyon here was rather difficult toHe seems to frown onWhy do you not pro to Americaionable assemblages and actually hadthe coolness to propose that we shouldboth have prior engagementsEdith looked reproachfully at Kenyon who flushed to the temples aswas usual with him and saidNow Wentworth that is unfair Youmust not mind what he says Miss Longworth he likes to bring confusion onme and he knows how to do it I certainly said nothing about a prior engagementWell now you are here I hope youwill enjoy yourselves- It is quite aiinformal little gathering with nothing to abash even Mr KenyonThey found young Longworth therein company with Melville who jvas tobe his companion on the voyage Heshook hands but without exhibitingthe pleasure at meeting them which hiscousin had shownMy cousin said the young manseems resolved to make the going ofthe prodigal nephew an occasion forkilling the fatted calf Im sure Idont know why unless that she isglad to be rid of me for a monthEdithlaughedat this and left thmen together Wentworth soon contrived to make himself very agreeableto the young -ladies who were presentbut John it must be admitted feltawkward and out of place He wasnot enjoying himself He caught himself now and then following EdithLongworth with his eyes and when herealized he was doing this he abruptlylooked at the floor In her handsomeevening dress she appeared supremely lovely and this John Kenyon admitted to -himself with isigh for her very loveliness seemedto place her further and furtheraway from him Somebody playedsomething on the piano and this was jin a way a respite for John He felt lthat nobody was looking at him Thena young man gave a recitation whiclrwas very welL received and Kenyon began to forget his uneasiness A German gentleman with long hair saldown at the piano with a good deal ofimportance in his demeanor Therewas much arranging of music andfinally when the leaves were settled tohis satisfaction there was a tremendouscrash of chords the beginning of whawas evidently going to be a troublesometime for the piano In the midst of thishurricane of sound John Kenyon became aware that Edith Longworth hadsat down beside himI have got every one comfortablysettled with every one else se saidin a whisper to him and you seem tobe the only one who is as it were outfjei-in the colv -t-iithe honor toIt is indelife riVt 3ffe6jftS3 s-xC -WV it-yotfsee Ihave done youjome and talk to

pretendedbut you taTve ones light remarks as ifthey- were most weighty sentencesNow you must look as if you were entertaining me charmingly whereas Ihave- sat down beside ybu to have avery few minutes

younever -sent me an invitatidn althoughI told you that I wishedtq help you informing a company but that is the wayyou business men alwajs treat awoman - -Keally - Miss Longworth beganKenyon but she speedily interruptedhimI am not going to let you make anyexplanation 1 have come- over here toenjoy scolding you and Lam not to becheated out of my pleasureI think said John if you knewhow much I have suffered during thislast day or two you would be verylenient with me- Did you read that article upon me in the Financial FieldNo J did not but I read your replyto it this morning and I think it wasexcellentAh that was hardly fair A personshould read both sides of the questionbefore passing judgmentIt is a womans idea of fairnesssaid Edith to read what pertains toher friend and to form her judgmentwithout hearing the other side Butyou must not think 1 am going to forego scolding you because of myl hy ior you Dpnt you remember you rpromises to let me know how yourcompany was getting on from time totime and here I have never heard aword from you now tell me how youhave been getting on1 hardly know but I think we aregetting on very well indeed Youknow of course that your cousin is going to America to report upon themine As I have stated nothing butwhat is perfectly true about the property there can be no question as towhat that report will be so it seems tome everything is going on nicelyWhy do yolu not go to AmericaAh well I am an interested partyand those who are thinking of goingwith us have my report already It isneecessary to corroborate that -Whenit is corroborated I expect we shallhave no trouble in forming a companyAnd was William chosen by thosemen to go to Canadatf He AYasoexactJychdsen lie volunteered Mr Melville Jiere was theone who was chosen -And why -Mr tMeLyilleJ more thanyou for instanceWell s L said I am out of the question because I am an interested partyvMelville is a -man connected with chinaworks and as such in a measure anexpertIs Mr Melville a friend of yoursNo he-is-not I never saw him untilhe came to the meetingDo you know shesaid lowering hervoice and bending toward him thatI do not like Mr Melvilles faceKenyon glanced at Melville who wasat the other side of the room and Edil hwent on You must not look at peoplewhen I mention them in that way oithey will know we are talking aboutthem T do not like his face He is toohandsome a man and I dont like handsome menxDont you really said JohnThen you ought to Edith laughedsoftly a low musical laugh that wasnot heard above the piano din and wasintended for John alone and to blears it was the sweetest music he hadever heardI know what you were going to sayshe said you were going to say thatin that case I ought to like you WellI do that is why I am taking such aninterest in your mine and in yourfriend Mr Wentworth Arid so mycousin volunteered to go to CanadaNow I think you ought to go yourselfWhy said Kenyon startled thatshe should have touched the point thathad been discussed between Wentworthand himself -I can only give you a Womans reason because I do It seems to nityou ought to be there to know whatthey report at the time they do reportPerhaps they wont understand themine without your explanation andthen you see an adverse report migh tcome back in perfect good faith Ithink you ought to go to America MKenyonThat is just what George WentworthsaysDoes he I always thought he waa very sensible young man and now Iam sure of ithere gossipingWell I must not staywith you on businessI see the professor is going to finishand so 1 shall have to look after myother guests If I dont see you againthis evening or have another opportunity of speaking with you think overwhat I have said And then with themost charming hypocrisy the youngyvoinan thanked the professor for themusic to which she had not listened iathe leastWell how did you enjoy yourselfraid Wentworth when they had gotoutside again It was a clear starlight night and they had resolved towalk home togetherI enjoyed myself very well indeed Janswered Iven3 on much better thanI expected It was a little awkward atfirst but I got over thatI noticed you did with helpYes

herextended hand somewhat limply thenhe pulled himself together and saidThis is an unexpected pleasure MissBrewsterJennie blushed very prettily andlaughed a laugh that Wentworththought was like a little ripple of music from a mellow fluteIt may be unexpected she saidbut you dont look a bit like a mansuffering from an overdose of pure joyYou didnt expect to see me did youI did not but now that you arehere may T ask in what waj 1 can serveyouWell in the first place you may askme to take a chair and in the secondplace you may sit down yourself forI have come to have a long talk withyouThe prospect did not seem to be soalluring to Wentworth as one mighthave expected when the announcementwas made by a girl so pretty and dressedin such exquisite taste but the youngman promptly offered her a chair andthen sat down with the table betweenthem She placed her parasol and afew trinkets she had been carrying onthe stable arranging them with somecare then having given him time torecover from his surprise she flashed alook at him that sent a thrill to thefingerdangeraretips of the young man Yet aunderstood is a danger halfovercome and Wentworth unconsciously drawing a deep breath

hourohimed they removed all signs of decoration for Dame Rumor announced that thokings daughter had suddenly becomedumbAnd unhappily this was no empty heareaywThe princess had long recovered fromher

kind foamed with rage He ordered all the frogs in his kingdom to bekilled and set a price of a farthing on thehead of every frog and he threw the gardener into prison Of what use was it allThe princess remained dumbDays weeks and months passed byPhysicians collected there from all cornersof the globe What one ordered tho otheralways condemned but not one of themcould give backto the kings

possessed the remedy which would restore thepower of speech to the princessThe princess had been obliged that samefiay to under to a great deal First she hadbeen pricked with redhot needles by a

Enterprising Schoolboy Who Slept Inthe Coronation ChairIt is a Jong walk from the diningroom of the Westminster school to thecoronation chair which stands behindthe old stone screen just back of thealtar in the abbey but there is an interesting conection between the twoThis chair as is well known is a rudeheavy oak chair much worn by timeIt contains the Stone of Scone andwas made by the order of Edward I in1297 and every English sovereign sincethen has sat in it to be crownedA stout railing in front of the chairrestrains the crowd of visitors fromcoming near but if they were allowedto examine it as closely as I was fortunate enough to do they would findcut boldly into the solid oak seat insuch sprawling letters as the schoolboys knife makes upon his desk PAbbott slept in this chair Jan 4 1801P Abbott it seems was a Westminsterschoolboy and a tradition5 whioh thereis every reason to believe is true tellsthat he made a wager with a sohoolmate that he dare stay in the abbey allnight aloneIn order to win his wager he hid insome corner of the old building untilthe doors were locked for the night andthus was left alone there Fearinghowever that when morning came theboy with
