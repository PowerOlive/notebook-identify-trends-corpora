The Worst Handicap
in the World is Worry
It ties a man hand and foot, takes off the
edge of his talents and cuts down his ability.
Worry as to what will happen to the fami
ly should anything happen to him will do more
than anything else to cut down a man's earning
power.
Life insurance solves the problem the day
you get your policy is the day you cut your
fetters. '

cure for WORRY
