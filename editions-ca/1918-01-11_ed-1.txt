KY. Post, Nov. 30,1917.)The Government lias been conserving water power on public landsso efficiently during the past tenyears that they have practicallystopped the development of it. Forten years that power has gone towaste, and unless there is a changein the temper of the conservationists or some act of Congress overruling the conservationists, thispower will go to waste for the nextten years.The Government should not partt with the control of the water powerabsolutely. It should require reasonable returns from all the usersof this power, whether they aremanufacturers, transportation lines,or public utilities companies.But the conditions under whichthis power can be used ought to besucb as to justify the investmentof capital for its utilization and development. -.If men are to put millions of dollars in mills and factories and electric lines within thereach of these streams, then theprice and the tenure should be suchas to insure the investors againstany arbitrary action of bureau officers, against any arbitrary annulment of the lease, against any coursefor the acquisition of the propertywhich, would be a sacrifice of thecapital and an obstruction to anydevelopment dependent upon capital. :This wate power lies at the baseof productive energies. It should "betreated as we treat primal raw materials. It is the common propertyof the people, but it has no value," except "value in use." The govern--jnentshould seek to develop thisjOM upon reasonable terms and not"upon, impracticable devices andmeasures that will do nothing butprevent any industrial developmentthat can profitably use power nowgoing to waste.Congress should act promptly inthis matter, because this' powercompetes with electric power developed froni coal. Here we have"competition of product with product," and competition is the forcethat is to protect the great body ofthe American people from the oppression of the consolidated moneypower of America.S 1State of Ohio, City of Toledo,Lucas County, ss.Frank J.

President Wilson Tuesday, addressingCongress, delivered a re-statementof war aims in agreement 'with therecent declaration by the Britishpremier, David Lloyd George.The President presented a definiteprogram for world peace, containingfourteen specific considerations.The President presented the following as necessary elements ofworld peace: " x f1 Open covenants of peace without private international understandings. 2 Absolute freedom of the seasin peace or war except as they maybe closed by international action.3 Removal of all economic barriers and establishment of equality of trade conditions, among nations consenting to peace and associating themselves for its maintenance. 4Guarantees for the reductionof national armaments to the lowest point consistent with domesticsafety.5 imperial adjustment of all colonial claims based upon the principle that the peoples concernedhave equal weight with the interestof ihe government.6 Evacuation of all Russian territory and opportunity for Russia'spolitical development.7 Evacuation of Belgium without any attempt to limit her .sovoieignty. g All French territory to befreed and restored and reparationfor the taking of Alsace-Lorraine.9 Readjustment of Italy's frontiers along clearly recognizablelines of nationality.10 Freest opportunity for autonomous devedopment of the peoplesof' Austria-Hungary.11 Evacuation of Rumania, Serbia nnrt "Montenesrro. with access tothe sea for Serbia, and internationalguarantee of economic and politicalindependence and territorial integrity of the Balkan States.12 Secure sovereignty for Turkey's portion of the Ottoman empire but with other nationalitiesunder Turkish rule assured securityof life and opportunity for autonomous development, with the Dardanelles permanently open to all na-tirtTic;""" -i?. Establishment ot an mae-1pendent Polish state, including ter-ritnries inhabited oy muispuuiuxjPolish populations, with free accessto the sea and political and economic independence and territorialintegrity guaranteed by international covenent.14 General association of nations under specific convents formutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to large and small states"For such arrangements and coenants," said the President in conclusion, "we are willing to fightand continue to fight until they areachieved; but only because we wishthe riht to prevail and desire ajust and stable peace."Such a program, he said, removedchief provocations for war."Thn moral climax of this, thenilminatinc: and final war for human liberty has come," said thePresident in ending his address,"and they (people of the UnitedStates) are ready to put their ownstrength, their own highest purpose, their own integrity and devotion to test." .President Wilson's decision to address Congress on the subject wasentirely unknown in Washingtonuntil announced at the WhiteHouse. The President evidently hadnot confided the fact that he wasworking on an address, so far aswas known, to anyone, although hemust have been engaged upon itfor some time, as it had been put intvpe at the government printingoffice to be given out at the Capitolwhen he started speaking.Lloyd George's redefinition of war'aims before the British labor meeting Saturday created the most profound impression in Washington,on,., if ctriirk ai responsive chordheie is evidenced by the fact thatthe President is understood to naveroTit a nrsnna.l telegramto tuyBritish premier congratulating him.Although the impression prevailthat the President would aeai wiuu, c,Hiot nf war aims, it waspointed out by many that the subject of international .relations wasa very broad one ana anuiucu ,almost unlimited field for the President's address.It was recalled that when thePresident went to Congress to askfor the declaration of war on Austria-Hungaryit probably was entirely unknown to anyone but himte rv tvijit occasion he stateahe would leave the subject of dealing with Turkey and Bulgaria untilsome later time. mTya was nothing prior to uiePresident's delivery of his addressto indicate that he would take upthat subject; in fact the generaliTjression was that he would not,but it remained as a possibility.-hP rapidly developing and everchanging situation in Russia, too,vfi, opidered a subject the President might touch upon, particularlythe apparent awakening oi nBolsheviki leaders to the apparentinsincerity of the Austor-Germanpeace terms proposed at the conference at Brest-Litovsk.One factor in the situation whichcommands attention just now is thatRussia again appears to be leaning-toward the Entente cause. Th.President all along has Carefully directed the attitude of the Americangovernment toward the Bolshevikiwith th2 aim of not offending them.JQHH WHITE h GO.LOU!SVILLE, KY.libera; assortmentand full valuo paidHides onCast Skins(7doc-13t-F)New City Officials wildTheirFMAYOR E.Mayor E.
