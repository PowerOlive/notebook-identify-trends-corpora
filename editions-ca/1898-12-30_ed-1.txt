of death wasnneumonia which developed from antSENATOR J S MORRIKLJ attack of grip contracted about aweek ago The venerable senator wasconfined to his home but seven daysNo definite funeral ai

elected to the senate to succeed2IonJLuke P Poland He held his seat in thosenate since that date without interruptionhaving been elected six terms successivelyHis present term to which he was phosen in1890 would not have expired until 1903It was at the beginning of the war that MrMorrills practical business training firstbrought him forward as a man of national reputation He was the author of the Morrilltariff act of 1861 which was the basis of all thetariff legislation of war times In 1864 he became chairman of the committee on ways andmeans the principal committee of the houseand at that critical time of especial importanceAfter entering the senate Mr Morrill continued to give his attention largely to financial and commercial questions and during thogreater part of his term of service he wasidentified as a member of the committee onfinance which committee deals especially withthese subjects He first became chairman ofthis committee in 1877 succeeding SenatorSherman when the latter entered the cabinet ofPresident Hayes and he held this position continuously after that date except during the 46thnrid53d congress when the democratic partycontrolled the senate and during those intervals he continued at the head of the republicanrepresentation on the committee In recentyears he delegated the greater share of the details of the committee work to the youngermembers of the committee but there had beenbut few times when he was not a regular attendant upon the committee meetings and many instances are related of his surprising activity indirecting the affairs of the committee up tothe lastDuring his long career Mr Morrill gave hisattention to many questions and no man inpublic life was more given than he to takinggSp a subject and holding on to it through yearsand years until consummated He was ihoVeal father of the scheme for the constructionof a building for the congressional library andto him and Senator Voorheeswho yearly joinedliim impressing this

on the19th instant when Le m de a speech of half anhours duration in advocacy of the supremecourt building bill Heat the same time prevailed upon the senate to pass the bill in theface of some

morning UnitedStates Consul Pratt at Singapore cabled the state departmentIloilo taken 24th Spanish fledto Borneo This threw theofficials into deeper doubt than beforeThe American expedition which leftManila to go to Iloilo 2000 troops andthe war ships Baltimore and Callaowould scarcely have had time it issaid to have reached Iloilo by the24th So the inference is that the insurgents are in possession Color islent to this belief by the fact reportedin one telegram that the Spaniards hadretreated to a strongly fortified townon the island of Mindanao This doesnot agree with Consul Spratts statement that they fled to Borneo thenorth coast of which is a British possession but it is believed that the consul is in error on this pointJust before noon another dispatchcame from Gen Otis that

the term necessitating- a vacation of two weeks and Director Hathuway bad insisted that tbe teacbermake up the lost time much to tbe disgust of the younger children who hadthus been deprived of their holidayfreedomBut the teacher bad not been in theleast incommoded by this prolongationjof tbe term Herbert Allen had en-joyed his first term in a country schoolFor some reason which be bad neverstopped to anaylze there had been apeculiar fascination about his work although it bad been in a sphere of lifeond amidst environments so differentfrom what be had dreamed of a vear be-fore And yet be bad unwittingly in-rcurred tbe displeasure of tbe schoolboard and bad been recently informedthat bis services would not be neededlongerAnd now on the last afternoon of December tbe term was over Tbe schoolhad closed with exercises and thewhole community bad turned out tobear them Tbe boys had stammeredthrough their pieces the big girls badread their essays and the little oneshad gone througb their songs and motion exercises to their own great satisfaction and the infinite delight of theiradmiring parents Director Hathawayrnd Elder Sloane at the teachers inflation bad talked edifyingly on theadvantages of an eddication and theproper training of tbe young and tbeteacher bad spoken a few words ofmodest farewellAt last all was over the last scbolarhad said good by to tbe teacber andgone The young master seated himself at bis table and sighed deeply as belooked around the now quiet room especially as bis eyes rested upon the seatof Hejen Hathaway the charming5 oung daughter of the directorThe schoolhouse on whose interiorhev was so disconsolately gazing as thesetting sun shone througb its windows and ligbted up tbe familiar objects the charts and pictures on tbewalls the neatly executed maps anddrawings the specimens of busywork done by the children the mottoestana diagrams ana quotations on thelackboards had been indeed a pleasant place to Herbert save for the onedisturbing incident Many a cheerfulmodern schoolroom can be found in tbecountry districts of the middle westernstates and it is easy to see how an enthusiastic refined young man like Herbert Allen could become attached tosuch a pleasant intellectual workshopIt would bare been even easier to understand bis fondness for the sjot ifone could have seen tbe sweet face ofHelen Hathaway and noted the deep interest which she evinced in her algebraandhistoryand the readiness which theyoung teacher displayed to help her inher pursuit of knowledge It wouldhave amused a disinterested observerto see the earnest devotion with whichthe pedagogue nd his most advancedcholar delved into the mysteries ofquadratic equations and how willing-ms 0the young man appeared io show hisinterested and interesting pupilSuch amiability however was not atall pleasing to John Warren another ofthe oldest though by no means brightest scholars in school Before the adrent of the new teacher John had Beenthe recipient of an occasional smilefrom the directors daughter but oflate the young lady had apparently forgotten the young man in her deep absorption in algebra and historyIt was this unfortunate conditionspeaking from John Warrens standpoint that had led to Mr Allens discomfiture Squire Warren was a neighbor of Director Hathaway and the twofarmers were firm friends So when thesquires son began to make disparagingremarks about the teacher and the father whose faith in his only son wasunbounded had become prejudicedagainst the young man he mentionedthe matter to the director and easilypersuaded that worthy official whoseacquaintance with tbe teacher had extended little farther than had been incidental to tbe duty of maldng a contract with him that young Allen wasnot a fit person to conduct our schoolHe is too familiar with the scholars andhasnt enough dignity to fill such a responsible positionDirector Hathaway was a man ofpromptness and decision whose willwas law with the board so when hecalled his colleagues together and delivered tbe opinion that tbe teacber wastoo young and inexperienced to conduct the winter term tbe assessor andthe moderator meekty acquiescedthough they both felt in their heartsthat tbe young man had performedhis duties wellSo it came about during the last weekof the term that Mr Allen had beengiven formal notice that his serviceswould not be needed any longer Hebad been greatly surprised and mortified at this announcement and bis pupils bad shown their disapproval of theboards arbitrary action in a way thatthreatened open revolt all but JohnWarren who could hardly repress hisexultation at the turn affairs had takenOne year before this incident HerbertAllen bod been the favored son of arich merchant in an eastern city Hismother had long been in the grave andHerbert bad spent most of bis boyhooddays in a famous preparatory schoolJust as be was ready to enter collegefinancial disaster came upon his

thestrange storyThere are many strange things inthe Klondike said Mr Barnum hutperhaps the strangest and that aboutwhich nothing has been written o faris the dissipation caused by eating- snowIn the north when the thermometerreaches 30 to 40 degrees below zero amouthful of snow is like molten metalIt brings an inflammation to the palateand tongue and it is impossible to takeenough to quench the thirst There are- men in that country once hearty robust miners now weak creatureswhose fall can bctraced directly to thetime they began munching snowThe matter has been but little investigated but the scientists who haveexamined the subject say that thewaters of the north are rich with mineral deposits which are being constantly washed down from the mountainsA certain per cent of this mineral istaken into the air when vapor rises andthe snow becomes impregnated with itThus it can be seen that a person eating targe quantities of the snow takesinto his system a corresponding amountof mineralsWhile coming down the Copper i Iverlast sxring Mr Barnum came upon aparty of miners where one was dyingfrom the effects of eating snow liehad been a hard drinker but had runshort of whisky His thirst became un-endurable and as water was scarce inmidwinter he had taken to eatingsnowSoon he claimed it relieved his appetite for liquor but his companions noticed that his appetite for the snow increased until he was consuming enormous quantities Gradually his skinwhich Avas a dark bronze grew lighthis rugged stature became bent and1 even his harsh voice changed to thesqueak of an old woman

outpost where scene is laid tells the storyDe Gomeron has been appointed by Gende Rone to examine into a charge madeagainst him Nicholas a sergeant bringsin two prisoners a man and a woman whoare from the kings camp at Le FereDAuriac angered by insulting manner of deGomeron toward the woman strikes himA duel follows and during the commotionthe prisoners escape De Rone happens onthe disorderly scene and dAuriac upongiving his parole not to attempt escapehears this remarkable sentence To-morrowyou must die on the field Win orlose if I catch you at the close of the dayI will hang you as high as HamanChapter II DAuriac next morning takeshis place as usual on de Rones staff Inthe course of his riue over the field he savesthe life of Nicholas the sergeant who avictim of de Gomerons malice is found inimminent danger of almost instant deathChapter III After the battle in whichKing Henry utterly routs de Rones forcesdAuriac lying severely wounded seesthe forms of a man and woman movingunder cover of the night among the deadand wounded They find a golden collaron de Leyvas corpse and Babette stabsMauginot her partner to gain possessionof the prize After this hideous seeneHenry with a

dAuriac leaves for the avowedpurpose of preventing their marriageChapter V DAuriacs hcrse casts ashoe This causes a delay at village ofbEzy where he comes upon Nicholas insold sergeant who says de Gomeron is inthe neighborhood with the kings commission and that he Nicholas has evidenceof treason brewing among de Gomeron andcertain associates against the kingChapter VI Led by Nicholas dAuriacgoes by night to where de Goaneron is stationed Standing beside a broken pane4 they hear something ofithe outline of a plotagainst the king Burning with revengeNicholas fires through the window at deGomeron but misses his markChapter VII The two men fly for theirlives and think themeselves almost beyondpursuit when they come suddenly face toface with Biron one of the traitors to thekins whom dAuriac cuts down and withde Gomeron who makes short work ofNicholas dAuriac escapesChapter VIII He comes to Rouvreswhere Jacques by previous arrangementhad prepared to have liim received fromthere he gees direct to ParisChapter IX DAuriac takes up lodgingsin Paris and lays what he knows of thetreachery in the army and among the nobles before Sully master general of theordnance who advises him to keep himselfas much confined as possibleChapter X Calling on de Belin a friendliving in Paris the chevalier secures fromhim a servant named Ravaillac whom deBelin had won from dAyen at dice totemporarily take the place of Jacques Helearns marriage of dAyen and Madame dela Bidache is to take place In a fortnightDe Belin is- to be dAyens spusCHAPTER X ContinuedI ground my teeth in silent agonyWait a moment de Belin continueda chamberlain of the court knows mostof its secrets and I can tell you that it isnot such plain sailing as you think fordAy n The death of that unhappy Gabrielle has affected the king much Hes but now beginning to recover andBiron who was hurrying to his government of Burgundy has been ordered toremain in close attendance on the kingWhether Biron knew of the kings intentions or not I do not know but hehas strongly urged the suit of one of hisgentlemen for the hand of madame itis that croque mort de Gomeron with 1all bis faults a stout soldier It is saidthat the marshal has even pressed deGomerons suit with madame and thatrather than marry dAyen and clingingto any chance for escape she has agreedto fall in with his views This I heardfrom the vidame and Chevalier de Latingood enough authorityOne alternative is as bad as thetherThere is no satisfying some peopleWhy man dont you see it would be thebest thing in the world for you if it wassettled in favor of our friend from theCamargueThat lowborn scoundrelMon ami we dont know anythingabont that Give the devil his dne he isa better man than dAyen Iknow thereis ill blood between you and wondertlurt some has- not been spilt beforeThere will be before this is ended ITenez Let but the king agree to deGomerons suit and he is hard pressedI tell you for Sully even is on Birbnsside in this matter and after thatWhatHenrys mind will have turned another way There are many who wouldlike to play queen and few like Mesdames dc Guerchville and BidacheBut in any case Belin I lose thegameYou have become very clever in yourretreat my friend You win your gameif de Gomeron is accepted and thenAnd then my wise adviserShe need not marry the CamargueYou can run him through under thelimes in the Tuileries wed madameand grow cabbages at Auriac ever afterPouf The matter is simpleMiserable as I was I fairly laughedout at Belins plot Nevertheless thehopefulness of the man his cheery toneand happy spirit had their effect uponme and if it turned out that the kingwas wavering there was more than astraw of hope floating down stream tome My courage grew also when I puttogether Sullys words with Belinsnews that Biron was detained by theside of the I surely meant thatthis was done to prevent the marshaldoing mischief elsewhere If so I wasnevertheless on the horns of a dilemmafor by telling of the plot I would if mystory were believed make matters hopeless and advance dAyens cause to themisery of the woman I lovedOn the other hand by keeping silentI was in an equally hard case Mypledge to Sully prevented me from taking Belin fully into nry confidence andhardly knowing what I was doing Ipoured myself out another full gobletof the chambertin and drained it at adraftExcellent said Belin there is nothing like Burgundy to steady the mindin another moment you will be yourselfagain and think as I do in this matterCourage man Pick your heart up Afortnight is

of our return to the Hue desDeux Mondes and his going had removed one weight from my mind Iknew full well that unless somethingbeyond his control happened nry business would be faithfully dischargedtho I felt I was losing a tower ofstrength when I needed support mostas I watched him riding along the Malaquais mounted on the sorrel and leading the grayHe went out of sight at last and nowthat the momentary bustle caused byhis departure had ceased I had leisnreto think of what 1 had heard from DeBelin and those who have read the preceding pages and have formed theirjudgment aa to what was my characterat that time can well imagine that Iwas mentally on the rackThe trouble with dAyen was badenough but united to that was Belin Vstatement that she she was preparedno matter what the circumstances wereto give her band tc de Gomeron HadIbeen in her place death would have beenpreferable to me rather than this alternative and then I thought of thetokonTshe had sent back to me

had the marriage license that had been issued toherin one of the eastern states before thatwar But she had not been able to findit She was told then that she must secure affidavits of some people who hadknown her husband and of the fact thatthey had lived together for years andhad brought up a family One of thegrown up sons was with her at thetime and he secured the necessary information But to be sure that everything was all right the lawyer wroteto the clerk of the courts of the countyin which the original license had beenissued That officer replied that thelicense had been issued but that no return of marriage had ever been madeIn a few daj s the old woman came backto see her lawyer about the matter andby that time she had found the timeworn marriage license But that was alishe did have

lluilrtUp a Proiltalile Retail Tradeof Their OwnThe great difficulty with the averagefarm bee keeper is in finding a marketfor his surplus This matter of marketing the products of a farm is onethat should be given more thought byproducers They have so long sold tothe grain bujer or merchants according to what they take to market allowing the buyer to make the price that agood many of them feel that it is rathera small business to try to sell at retailThey look at it in a wrong light Notone consumer in a hundred but wouldprefer to buy butter eggs honey fruitand vegetables directly from the producer if he could do so In sellinghoney go directly to the best familiesand give them a glass full of jTour extracted honey or present themwith aquarter of a pound of nice comD moneyand tell them you have it for sale naming the price A few days later callagain and ask for orders Very oftenmore than half the families will buyand gradually others will come in withtheir orders until you will have a secure market for all you can produceIt is a fact that a family that once getsinto the habit of eating honey will innine cases out of ten miss it so muchwhen they get out of it that they wllwish for more at onceThe great difficulty with bujinghoney at the average country townstore is that merchants rarelj keep itin stock They may buy a few poundsif they can get it in the way jf a tradebut they do iot make a practice orkeeping it and Tisually when they dothey demand a greater profit on it thanon anj other line of goods they keepAlmost any honey producer can getmore than the wholesale city price byselling at home and by doing Ihissavoshimself the cost of freight and commissions and runs no risk from blowinghis goods to get into the hnds of riskycommission merchants FarmersVoiceQUARTERS FOR PIGSThey Should De in the Barn Uascment and Never Where OtherStoelc Is IveiitWhenever a barn has a barn basenfent as all should have in that shouldbe fixed the winter quarters for thehogs As there is a strong Disagreeable smell from the pigpen the basement should not be where other stockis kept nd of course not near thehouse Not only horses and sheepwhich aie dainty in their feeding buteven the cow which is less affected byfoul odors will refuse to eat food thathas been where the stench trom thehogpen could get at it Yet We luueknown farmers to allow hogs to run inthe same stable with cattle and horsesand then wonder why the latter sooften get off their feed and lose fleshThe hog alone will thrive under suchcircumstances though even the hog inits effort to keep warm will crowd closearound the larger animals to gatherheat from their bodies In this way thehog is apt to be stepped upon or kickedso that the practice is not best even forhim The pigs winter quarters shouldbe made warm and also light having awall on the south side with large doublewindows it through which the winter sunlight may stream If all theother sides are walled tight and abunch of chopped straw is put in onecorner the pigs will make their nestin that and sleep at night but in sunnydays they will huddle together wherethe sunlight can fall upon them Thismatter of sunlight has much to do withthe healthfulness of breeding sows andthe successful rearing of their littersespecially those farrowed m earlyspring American CultivatorSMALL WORKBENCHEtoeedinjrly Convenient tor DoingSmall Jobs of

Agreeable tothe Fellow Who Was Catching PishA sherman once took his cornet to thelake with him in hopes that his harmoniousnotes vould have a hypnotic influence inattracting the fish to his hookAs soon as he had set his lines he raisedthe cornet to his lips and soon made thewelkin ring with some of the latest popularairs but without the expected result of gaining bitesTerhaps I dont play loud enough hethought So he blew his cornet louder butstill no nibbleConfound it he exclaimed Whereare all the suckers to dayAt that moment he glanced to the opposite extremity of the lake where he saw another angler pulling in fish hand over handwho seeing he was observed by the cornetist shouted Bravo EncoreI am glad that somebody appreciates mymusic thought the man with the cornetSo again raising

months We had sevendifferent doctors for him but they couldnot cure him They took out one piece ofbone about 3 inches long the shape of ashoe and one smaller piece The hole inhis hip was about 3i inches deep and thesore kept running all the time The doctors ordered us to keep the hole filled withcotton saturated with some kind of medicine This Ave did tind used a probe to insert the cotton We could introduce theprobe about 3 inches and found by moving the probe about that there was a largecavity next to the bone and we could feelthe bone with the probe The child wasvery pale thin and weak and could notsleep and we had no hope of his recoveryThe treatment we gave him under the doctors directions did him no good We finally commenced using Allens Ulcerine Salveand it soundly and permanently cured himin about six months He has been wellabout four years and is strong and quitefleshy but limps a little on account of oneleg being a little shorter than the otherHe is a picture of
