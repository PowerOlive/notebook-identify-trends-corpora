FLAWS IN BIG GUNS
NTERNAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY SUC
CESSIVE DISCHARGES
The Erosive Action of Inflamed
Gases Cnmei the First Serious In
Jnry How the Projectile ilclps to
Kill the Gun
The larger a cannon the more exten
sive are the injuries it receives vvith
each successive discharge All damage
d me to a gun is internal The separate
action of the powder and the projectile
damages the piece every time it is aimed
and CrecL Obviously the amount of the
dana depends upon the material and
workmanship of the gun Men who
make big guns describe the harm done
their pets with many intricate and puz
zling terms of a scientific turn In one
case a gun is damaged because the part
of the bore which contains the powder
is enlarged This happens when the
metal is compressed and it is more dan
gerous and more plainly seen if the
gunners have been using wads between
their explosive and their projectile
Then again cavities are produced by
the melting away of a part of the metal
by tbe heat of combustion of the charge
Cracks come from the tearing asunder
of the particles of the metal at the sur
face of the bore When it is first made
a crak of this particular kind is barely
perceptible but it increases each time
the gun is fired Gradually it extends
completely through the side of the
piece The crack usually begins at the
junction of the chamber with the bore
simply because as guns now are this
part is not so well supported as tbe
others
Edward S Farrow U S A is au
thority on damage to guns although
hike all others who have studied the
question he does not agree with very
many authorities on all the points to
consider in the life of a cannon He con
tends that furrowing or scoring produced
by the erosive action of inflamed gases
is tbe great disease which attacks the
very big guns first This particular in
jury is most apparent where the current
of the gas is most rapid or at the inte
rior orifice of the vent and on tbe sur
face of the bore directly over the seat
of the projectile This scoring begins
very early in the life of a very large
gun but it is conceded that it does not
become very important until the piece
has been discharged considerably Lieu
tenant Farrow describes this scoring as
resembling the bark of an aged elm tree
tbe metal being eaten away into irregu
lar furrows and ridges In extreme
cases however scoring has not killed
the gun although in some cases it has
acted like a wedge and split the bore at
the place attacked
Where the action of the projectile has
ruined the gun the damage has been
done around the projectile and in front
of it The elasticity of the metal and
the crowding up of portions of it in
front ox the shot cause a rebounding
prosess The projectile carried forward
by the force of the charge strikes
against the upper part of the bore then
it is sent against the bottom and again
bounds to the top and so on until it
emerges from the piece The effect of
this bounding motion is to raise and de
press the gun in its trunnion holes The
accuracy of fire is diminished and of
course the gun is unfit for service
Bronze guns are the worst sufferers in
this way Mortars short and dumpy
are not affected
To stop the bounding of the projectile
gunners wrap the shell in cloth or pa
per or else shift the base of the mass
to be hurled This last process is con
sidered the best and is done by reduc
ing the diameter of the cartridge and
adding to its length Projectile injury
is also caused by furrows or scratches
made by rough shells or case shot
Small fragments too break away very
often from the shells and give the bore
a grinding and cutting process produc
tive of great damage
Enlargement of the muzzle is another
serious injury produced by the projec
tile This is caused by a process which
seems unavoidable As the shell leaves
the piece it strikes against one portion
of the bore The resistance at the mouth
being less than at any other point the
metal naturally yields and the muzzle
of the cannon is elongated in a vertical
direction
Some men who ought to know say
tkat 150 shots is the life of a very big
gun a 12 or 13 inch weapon Others
place the number of shots at 400 or 500
Ai a matter of fact it is all guesswork
The great Krupp gun shown at the
Worlds fair and conceded to be perfect
or supposed to be so has been dis
charged less than ten times and it is
how believed t have reached its liraot
On the other hand the big guns of the
American battleships have passed the
time allotted them by wTise men who
know guns and apparently are as good
as when tested How soon they may
yield however is not in the books
Lieutenant Farrow says that a very
large gun should not be expected to
stand more than 400 or 500 shots before
it will be necessary to open a new vent
clesing the old one at its interior orifice
When the gun dies bursts the lines
ef fracture are photographed Speci
mens of the metal are saved Teets are
made and conclusions drawn And Un
cle Sam has figured out so many things
in this same connection that his guns
nowadays are conceded to be better than
those of any other maker They live
longer than the wise ones say they
should Chicago Times Herald

An Arizona rancher has posted the
following notice on a cottonwood tree
near his place My wife Sarrah haa
