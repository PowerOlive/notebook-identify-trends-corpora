miles back fromthe Potomac river near Indian Headwithin the next two or three m nthsWork on the mills has been pushedenergetically and at present about1200 men are employed Adin ONeilchief of bureau

will number 24or 25 with a capacity of 2000 poundsof smokeless powder daily This dailyoutput seems large at first thoughtbut one of the big 13 inch jruns of theIndiana uses 1000 pounds of powder ata single shotThe various buildings of the powderplant cover a wide area about fourmiles back from the river The general purpose has been to keep thebuildings as far apart as the requirements of manufacture would permitin order to avoid the dangers of explosions For that reason there is nolarge central buildings but many smallones each having a distinct branch ofthe powder making They are ararranged also with a vJ3w to the prevailing winds so that the risk of having the fumes of acid borne by thewind is reduced to a minimumOne building is us d exclusively forthe picking process another for themixing another for the acids In thisway each stage of manufacture is detached from all the others not only reducing the chances of accident butalso giving some security against widespread damage in case of explosion in any one stage ofthe process Another precautonarymeasure has been the building of lightpaper walls at the ends of the buildings These readily give to the pressure of an explosion leaving the mainwalls of the structure standing- andmaterially reducing the loss which occurs when an explosion is closely confinedIn order to connect the many buildings and permit the powder process tobe carried on expeditiousl a complete trolley car service is to be in operation This will keep the materialin its various stages moving forwardfrom iuiiding to building until

theDivision of Their LandsPresent Condition of Affairs in tbeCreek Nation Indian TerritoryIs Not ReaBsnringTroableIs ProbableSpecial Chetocah I T LetterThe troubles over the allotment ofands to Indians seems to be increasing The full blooded Indians do notwish the land divided but prefer thatthe title remain in the tribes Therecent law allots to each memberf a family 160 acres As many ofthe Indians have large families theywill get good sized farms On an average the Indian cultivates only 40 or80 acres Under the tribal laws he canlocate as much as he wishes Then heleases it to white men A few jumpersfence a tract of several thousand acresand lease it to a white man for a cattle ranch The Indians live in idlenesson the revenues They naturally oppose the allotment and so do he American holders of leases to these largetracts Another element the fullblooded Indians are also In oppositionbecause they read their fate in thusplacing the lands within he reach ofthe pale face The law also providesthat the present leases shall be reducedto 160 acres per capita under a penalty3f not less than 100 j day Strangelythe law makes no provision for achief of each nation names anotherand each pai ticular town names a thirdWhen the property shall be offered forsale the occupant has the first privilegeto bid the appraised valuation afterthat it is open to all There will nodoubt be a great scramble much litigation and perhaps more serious troubleswill follow during the next severalmonthsThe interest on the Indian funds inthe treasury will hereafter be paid toeach family individually and not tothe nations Flush times are expectedwhen thee cash allotment are madeIn explanation it may be stated thatthe Indian Territory is composed offive nations inhabited by five civilized tribes The Choctaws Chickasaws Cherokees Seminoles and CreeksEach nation has its tribal governmentand chiefsThe United States laws are now supplanting the tribal laws and courts butthe nations retain their chiefs and legislative councils All criminal and civileases originating within the past fewmonths will be tried in the UnitedStates courts and Indian juries andcourts are virtually out of existenceHeretofore capital punishment was inflicted by shooting and the condemnedwas permitted to go home settle hisbusiness and bid his family good byand he returned promptly on the dayof execution to be shot Not a failureis reported in the hitory of the territory and the executions were manyThis paroling of the condemned willnow be stopped under our civilizedlaw It will be remembered that Wonga Tonga who was recently shot wasnn i i 1 11 S - -v i S 1 j SIS lSs i jisifiCIVILIZED INDIAN FAMILY OF THE CREEK NATIONrey and if the work is done by thelessees they will make liberal allowances for themselves There will bemany prosecutions instigated in manyinstances by those who want the landand this may lead to the usual war andvendetta The lessees will send a delegation to congress this winter in theirown interests and the full bloods whoare opposed to the allotment will alsosend a delegation to have a big talkwith the wllite chiefs who make thebad laws against the IndianAs these lands jare perhaps the mostvaluable they will be much soughtafter when the allotment is made Apale face cattle rancher who holds10000 acres under the blanket lease ofa few Indians who have jumped tbeland will be dispossessed of all exceptthe quantity the Indians are entitledto under the allotment which maybeone half or one fourth according tothe number in each family For example one rich Indian in the Creek nation has jumped about 5000 acres andas he has a family of only four persons he will lose nearly all of his landThe United States attornejs have ordered the marshals to cut down thewire fences of these illegal holdingsand this may precipitate the trouble- - UilLghvwPETER MACNACFull Blooded Creek Indian Checotah ITThe Indian is now prohibited from locating more than 160 acres for eachof his family and this wholesale landgrabbing will doubtless be checkedWhite men are behind the Indianjumpers The aim is to give to eachIndian a home where he must residepermanently Under the tribal lawshe moved to any unoccupied land -whenhe wished It belonged to the nationand he was one of the tribe He paidneither rent nor taxes and was happyA disaffected element under Muskratt Whirlwind and Grills will soonemigrate to MexicoThe townsite matter is anotherimpending trouble When tbe palefaces swarmed into the territory theylcised lands from the nation in whichthey located or from an Indian whoheld the right of the squatterThis is the same condition in townsand on farming lands No one has atitle to the land on which he lives Hekos a lease or temporary claim andca only sell his squatters claim andthe improvements On these temporaryoccupations villages and cities have beenbuilt This land is reserved from allotment otherwise the braves would select tracts in which there were severalorner lots This property will be soldnd the money will be paid to the govf rnment as agent for the Indians Theimprovements belong to the present occupants The secretary Df the interioris now appointing appraisers He namesone for each town in the territory thea member of a baseball club andstarred through the country while under sentence of death His was thelast execution to take place under Indian law in this territory When shonthe writ of habeas corpus issued by aUnited State court the Indian sheriffgrunted saying that the Indian judgeright and proceeded with the execution This is an explanation of thersystem and the recent changes Insome of the nations an American courtwill be held for the first time next NovemberIn this Creek nation there are threetickets in the field for chief the election to be held in November ChiefIsparhecher is a candidate for reelection Kolly Mcintosh grandson of thenoted Alabama chief who gave GenJackson a great deal of trouble is onthe ticket for second chief Their platform is in opposition to the treatyrelations with the United States It isknown as the pure blood or straightIndian ticketGen Porter and Hon Motey Tiger arecandidates for first and second chiefrespectively on th e progressiveticket which forces an alliance withthe white mans government L CPennyman a negro Indian and William McCombs head another ticketwhich opposes the others on generalprinciples The Creeks number about15000 polling about 3000 votes Whitemen are not eligible to the franchiseTheyare not citizens ad are classed asintruders Indians vjpte viva voceThey state their name to the clerkwith those of their candidates Theclerk records the vote It is likely thatthe Mexican system of repeating andchanging the record may be introducedby some of the half breeds who havelearned of civilized ways which will nodoubt bring on trouble The candidates are able speakers Motey Tiger isreally eloquent The Indian oratornever speaks from notes he speaksfrom the heart The campaign will bethe most lively one in the history of thenation The chief receives only 1000 ayear but the honor is the greater prizeThe second chief is paid 600 a yearThey bear about the same relative position to their people as the president andvice president do in the pale face government The next chief however w illbe shorn of nearly all of his power hisduties will be limited to local mattersconcerning the tribe all civil and criminal business having been transferredto the United States courts the Indiancourts are abolished and the council isdeprived of the law making powerThe council has two branches thehouse of kings which is similar to oursenate and the house of warriorswhich is similar to our house of representatives in name if nothing else forthey have disturbances which are settled only after a quiet knock down ortwo They receive 3 a day each andare satisfied writh the honorThese officials are paid out of thetribal funds which are held in trust

come so -lose up to us thathe must have heard every word of our conversation This was most annoying and adisaster of which the future consequencesmight be most serious 1 determined however to be rid

relief at thenews Once in France she would be safewith her family and I was honestly gladshe was out of the dangers of the timeWe bad now reached the horse marketand with some search discovered two likely-lookinganimals whose price was withinthe measure of my purse I could not afford to pick and choose to any great extent but for 4U crowns became the ownerafter a little trial which showed theywere as sound as I could see of two nagsone a bay and the other a russet with anof foot white above the pastern an unlucky color and the white marking denoteddeviltry Hut he was a shrewd lookingbeast and I kept him for myself givingthe bay to Jacopo Having paid on thespot for these together with the necessarysaddlery we rode to the shop where 1 hadleft my purchases and collected them Itwas here that the idea struck me that therewas an opportunity to keep my word andreturn her gilt to Madonna Angiola therefore asking messer the shopkeeper for sealing-waxand some parchment which he willingly supplied on a small payment I carefully folded up the tari and sealed up thepacket Taking it in my hand 1 went outto Jacopo who was holding the horses andsaidSee here Jacopo Take this packet tothe house of the secretary Machiavelli Itlies in the ward San Spirito near Santa Felieita and cannot be missed Deliver ifant o the hands of the Lady Angiola Baynothing 1 come away There is no rtply

a bush and that1 might as well dine now whilst 1 had thechance I swung myself into the saddle andproceeded at a smart pcee toward theDouble Florin1 had to cross the piazza oi the SignoryMl my way there and whilst doing so camelace to face with a riding party It wascomposed of several ladies mid gentlemenand amongst them was Machiavelli whoglanced at me with a friendly twinkle in hiseye and gave me an imperceptible nod ofapproval Almost immediately behind himwas old Ives dAlcgres riding with a boltupright seat and making himself agreeablein his bear like manner to Lady Angiolawho rode beside him There was no avoiding them and yielding to a sudden impulseI saluted as they came np A look ofcontempt spread over the features of thegeneral who made no response and Madonna Angiola kept her eyes fixed leforeher as if she had - oen nothing Theypassed by in a ninvnt leaving me speechless with anger for owing to my failureto preserve a dis e I had allowed mybeard to grow acrain and DAlegres withoutdoubt recognized me There was some txeuse perhaps for him but none I couldthink of for her and to add to my chagrin1 thought that Jacopo would probablywaste lumrs in awaiting her return I letmy horse out to a band gallop notwithstanding the pavement and luckily doingno injury to any of the passers by or to himlulled up in a few minutes at the door ofmy ordinary Here although 1 tried to catI was so angry that I could only trifle witlimy food and raging within myself I dranka full measure of wine swallowed such morsels as I could and went to see after myhorse Dy my directions he had a light feedand was being rubbed down As provisionagainst accidents I purchased a bottle ofChianti together with a roast fowl and aloaf of white bread and these I placed inmy saddle bags Then seeing to the saddling of the horse myself I exchanged myvelvet cap for the steel helmet and drawing my sword belt in by a hole sprang intothe saddle and went ou at a leisurely pacetowards the San Frediano gate There wasstill plenty oftime sc I made no hurry andindeed when I reached the gate the gongthere boomed out five oclock leaving ahalf hour still to spare before Jacopo wasdue I pulled up therefore at the side of theroad and dismounting led my horse upand down It was whilst thus engaged that1 noticed a priest mounted on a smart cobtrotting in the direction of the gate andknowing that i misfortune and a friar areseldom apart i observed him narrowly ashe passed He drew his cowl however overhis face so that I could make nothing ofhim but on reaching the gate he stoppedto ask some questions of the sentry thereand the man in raising his hand to saluteslightly startled the horse which threwback it5 head This sudden movement madethe hood the rider wore fall back a littlebut it was enough to enable me to see itwas the library scribe old Cecis nephewand I augured no good from this resolvingnevertheless to be on my guard more thanever The pretended priest received ananswer to his inquiry and giving his benediction in true saeredotal manner rode offat a pace that showed his seat on the librarystool had not interfered with his seat inthe saddle It was now fully the half hoarand yet Jacopo did not come I waited until the gong struck six and was just aboutto ride off leaving a message with the guardwhen I saw him approachingMake haste I cried as I mountedjou are latePardon excellency But the lady wasnot there I had to wait a lull hour before she came back from riding and JendAlcgres was with herDid you give the packet1 did excellency 1 rode up asked wholady Angiola was and presented thepacket saying it was from Cavaliere di Savelli my masterOh glorious fool Did 1 not tell youmy name was Donati Did I not tell youto say nothing but merely give the packetinto the ladys bandsBody o me excellency But there wereso many about my wits almost went awool gatheiing I gave madame the packethowever and she took itSaid anythingNothing excellency never a wordThere was no use crying over spilt milkand cursing Jacopo in my heart for afool we started off On reaching the fentry 1 thought 1 might as welltry and find out what the shun friar waslooking for The man raised his hand insalute as 1 came up apd flinging him a crownI bade him drink to the health of the Signory therewithMarry 1 will with pleasure and yourstoo excellency he said as he pocketed themoney evidently stirred by the amountInstead of mine drink to the health ofmy good friend the monk who has justgone ou Cm you tell me if he inquired foranyone hereI relied on the simplicity of the man andon taking him by surprise with the question and as it happened 1 hit my markIn truth excellency the reverend father inquired about a party of five horse- fmen who took ths xoad to Leghorn aboutfour oclock this afternoon He doubtedmuch if he could overtake them ere nightfall he said and would have to ride hardI poised another crown on my ringers absentry Do you know any of the partywho went aheadNo excellency but their leader was anold man with a long white beard and Ithink I heard him addressed as Ceci Excellency the wine will flow to night a hundred thanksI dropped the crown into his palm moving him to his closing wordsCome on Jacopo It grows late andsetting spurs to our hoises we rode at agallopCHAPTER XIITHE AMBUSCADEIt is good to go through the air with thestrength df a brave horse under one toknow that his strong muscles are stretchingwith an enjoyment as keen as his riderspleasure to hear the air whistle as onecuts through it and to feel the blood fairl dance in the veins After those wearys of illness of inaction and of mental despair I had passed through it wasif new life was poured into me to knowthat I was once more in the saddle with aprospect however faint of regaining all1 had lost As the landscape on each sideof me melted into a green grayt streak itseemed to carry away with it my Bufferinglis the true horse answered willingly to thetouch of my spur I forgot the past and wasonce again Lgo di Savelli with a spirit ashigh is the days before the black sorrowfell upon me To the loft of the road wasa broad stretch of springy turf erosseu bya fairly wide water channel I could notresist giving the Least a burst over thisand followed by Jacopo galloped over itwith a free rein Both the horses took thejump liice bucks and carried away by themoment we held on until we reached thestony and bowlder covered incline which ledto the valley of the Grove Here the turfcame to a sudden end in a line such as theeiie of a calm sea makes in a bay and thenlvjn a steep descent of gravel and loosestones whose many colors of gray ochreand brown were splashed here and thereby masses of short thick shrubs whichgradually increased in denseness until theyspread before us a sea of somber green thatstretched to the clear blue of the CreveHere on the crest of the slope I drewbridle ikingfile horses had enough ofit for the present and that it would be wellto husband their strength Jacopo pulledup alongside of me and stooping to pat theneck of his mount RaidExcellency the horses are in good condition they will carry us well to Leghorn lie spoke the truth for althoughthey might have been m better training asthe few clots of yellowy white foam on thepart of the reins which had touched theirnecks showed still we should have beencontent with less from nv and practicallyuntried purchases such as we had madeand I congratulated myself mentally on ourlack forBarabbas himself would have hadmuch to learn from the horse dealers ofTuscanyiy keeping at this pace excellency saidjpo as we trotted on we shall reachthe Rosa shortly before it gets quite darkand I subjnit that we stop thereto feed thehorses As your honor commanded 1 havebrought a meal for them and there wasspace enough tin the sack for a snack forme which would do at a pinch for twoif your ex ellenoy would but cowdpsoend totaste of itYou say well Jacopo but I also am anold soldier and my saddle bags are full Afasting body makes but a faint heartwhether for man or beast on the otherLank of the Besa then we shall call a haltThere is a little light still enough to increase the paceso onwardsWe broke into a hand gallop keeping onebehind the other and following the windings of a cattle trackviforT had purposelyavoided the road after receiving the information I had extracted from the sentry at the San Frediano gate It was evident that the party of men followed byCecis nephew had left Florence to carryout some desperate design I had beendogged all day by this man and now hehad galloped off in disguise to join the menwho had left Florence before we had andamongst them was his uncle Cecis wordsat our last interview and the persistentmanner in which I was followed left meno room to doubt that I was the objectof their attention and that it would benecessary to keep well on the alert I didnot apprehend daiurer at once but thouorhtthat if an attack were made it would bein the narrow valley between the low hillsto the north of Montespertoli or at Pontea Elsa each of which places was particularly suited for an ambuscade although ofcourse considering their numbers the attempt might be made elsewhere and openly without very much danger So withanother hurried word of warning to Jacopo Jand holding my sword ready I gallopedalong increasing the pace as much as pos Isible whenever we went past a clump oftries and both of us keeping as sharp alookout the light or rather darknesspermitted We avoided the regular fordof the Besa on the McntespertoJi roadcrossing higher up in the direction of Montelupo and here got a good wetting for thewater was deeper than we anticipated HadCeci and his friends only lain in wait forus at this point we should have had noj chance As it happened however we hadi taken a zig zag route which had eitherthrown them off the track entirely or weshould meet them further on either at oneof the two spots mentioned by me or insome other equally convenient locality Atany rate we were safe for the present andthat was something to be thankful for evenif we were in darkness So my thoughtsran on as we scrambled somehow to theopposite bank of the Besa and groped ourway up until we felt soft grass under ourfeet for we had dismounted on fording thestream and led our horses by their bridlesup the steep left bank Here we called ahalt determined to await the moon andJacopo managed somehow to tether zhehoises fastening the halters to the stumpof a tree he discovered by stumbling againstand on which he wasted some of those curseshe was so anxious for me io reserve for mvenemies After giving the horses their feedwhich they nosed out readily enough de-I spite the oarkness he joined me where I saton the grass trying to dry and wrapping Upthe lock of bis arquebus in a wooleh capwhich he produced to keepit from damphe took liis seat beside me at my invitationIt was fall to now to our supper andadding my store to my faithful followerssupply 1 sunk distinctions of rank andwe enjoyed a meal with a hearty contentment that had been a stranger to me formany a day When the last drop ol winein the bottle was finished and we hadpicked our last bone Jacopo arose with asighBefore rapper excellency 1 was readyto eat and then fight my way through anarmy now beshrew me if a sound napof an hour or so is noc much to my taste1 could not forbear smiling but did notrise to the hint and when our horses were- -- AJAXAJijXi XM A tjaddled again and every buckle an2 arfexamined with the minutest care we mounted and set off As although we both wellknew the direct road to Leghorn but werenot acquainted with the district so as tocorrectly pursue our way by moonlight I decided to run the gauntlet of the ambuscadeif there was any and take the risk of coming off with a whole skin to the certainty oflosing our track by chancing short cutswhich might lead to Heaven alone knewwhere Now that we were once more onthe road we trotted along at a fairish pacethrough the silent night The way led forsome distance over an uneven plain covered with a multitude of white stones thatshone in the moonlight like water Theplain gradually narrowed to where it wasintersected by a chain of low hills and itwas in crossing these that we should haveto ride through a narrow gut and possiblymeet our danger As we approached thehills the short stunted foliage that tuftedthe plain changed to a half grown forestin the midst of which the road wound andhere we waited for a second whilst J copcexamined his piece to see that all m arightand gingerly blew at the match thereonto give the fire a little strength This being done we proceeded with the greatestcaution riding one behind the other andgoing slowly as we feared a pitfall of somekind among the trees Luckily there wasnone and at last we eot out of the immediate presence of the forest and into thetut where the precipice rose high on eachside of us All was rock and stone but theroad was fairly even a trap could havebeen seen and going slow a mistake hereso we clapped spurs to the homes and sentthem along and although momentarily expecting to see the- flash of an arquebus weagreeably disappointed and got outof the passage without mishap of any kindAmmo Signore we are out of this andto night will not he bread for the teetb ofthese brigands and Jacopo whose horsehad carried him a little in advance drewivin to let me come up and we rode out ofthe tail of the passI hope so but we are not out of thewood yec and I pointed to where a dip inthe ground showed there was a smallstream and on the opposite bank the roadit led into forest landAnd I was just going to beg your worships leave to troll a catch said Jacopoand as he uttered these words we plashedinto the shall stream before us Almostat this moment my horse neighed shrillyand an answering neigh from the wood before us rang out into the nightrack Crack Two ied tongues of firelicked out from the

perish ofthirst In 1714 Louis XIV was presented with a single coffee plant forhis botanical garden by an Amsterdammagistrate It was nourished tenderlyand in time slips from it were sent toMartinique no doubt sub rosa to theDutch the Dutch having long controlled the cultivation of coffee andguarded it jealously lest it be cultivated on islands not under their controlOn the way to Martinique the botanistin charge the ships supply of watergetting low shared his own daily allowance with the precious plants Responding to his kindness they were60on growing nicely in Martinique Indue time these slips produced theirfragrant white flowers the grow atthe roots of the leaves and thesechanged into berries each withits two grains of coffee From Martinique the coffee journeyed to PortoRico and

BOURBON NEWS PARIS Y TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 12 1899CAUGHT IN THE TEAPTHE GREAT SMALLPOX SWINDLE ANDHOW IT WAS WORDEDA Brazen and Well Planned Schemeby Which Two Sharp ConfidenceMen Bunkoed a Hotel Keeper Oatof 5OOUI dare say you never heard of thegreat smallpox swindle said the hotel manager The facts of that remarkable affair were withheld at thetime for the most urgent reasons ofpolicy and even uow 1 prefer to tellthe story without names or localitiesIt happened in the fall of 1880 when acertain hotel in a large western citywas crowded with tourists One dayat the height of the season two gentiemauly looking strangers put up atthe house and were assigned to whatwe call a double room About a weeklater one of them appeared at the office and requested a private interviewwith the manager I regret to informyou he said after the door was closed that my friend Is down with a severe attack of smallpoxThe proprietor nearly fell out of hischair There was known to be smallpox in the city and the bare suggestion that the disease had appeared inthe hotel was enough to empty it In atwinkling To let the news get outmeant the loss of thousands upon thousands of dollars It meant the ruin ofthe seasons business He must bequietly removed at once said the proprietor trying to control his agitationRemoved exclaimed the otherTaken through the cold air to a lazeretto Why man that would be murder Ill not permit ItThe hotel keeper was thunderstruck Do you mean to say he muststay here he gaspedCertainly said the strangerIt was a ticklish situation The hostel keeper dare not enforce his suggestion while to let the case remain waslike storing gunpowder in a furnaceroom He pleaded protested beggedthreatened and blustered but all invain The man was firm as a rock Ifyou attempt to eject my sick friend hedeclared Ill publish your inhumanityto the entire communityFinally it occurred to the distractedproprietor to see first whether it wasreally a case of smallpox So he sentfor a physician swore him to secrecyand hustled him up to the room Thedoctor took one look at the disfiguredface on the pillow and reported thatthe malady was there In a malignanttype He advised the mans immediateremoval at any cost lf you keep himconcealed he said the disease mayspread and it would ruin you for lifeYou owe something to your guestsgain the proprietor Interviewed thefriend and again the latter refused tobudge from his positionWhere can I take him be demanded You know very well 1 cant getcomfortable quarters for such a purpose and I wont have him butcheredIn a pest house to please any landlordon earth The hotel man felt his hairstand on end but concluded to letthings stand as they wre until morningNext day he sent for the sick mansfriend and asked him whether he hadany suggestions to makeYes he replied I thought up aplan over night which you may adoptr not as you like As I said beforehe continued it Is useless to try torent quarters for such a case Wemight however buy a small cottageand take him there I have figured thething up and the total expense wouldbe about 5000 If you are willing tohand over that amount I will take himaway and assume all further responsibility I make the offer entirely outof sympathy for your guestsThe landlord looked him in the eyeI too have thought the situationover he said and Im convinced itsa confidence game pura and simpleIm convinced theres nothing the matter with your dear friend up stairsbut 1 am also convinced that the slightest breath of the affair weuld greatlydamage the reputation of the houseAs a business proposition 1 consider itworth 5000 to get rid of youThe other man smiled ironicallyCall a cab and get out your moneyhe said and inside an hour the incubushad been spirited through a side doorswathed in blankets and driven awayAs the landlord shrewdly surmisedthe whole thing was a confidence gameand he learned the particulars later onthrough a sport he had once befriended There was nothing the matterwith the rascal up stairs except thathis face had been pricked a little witha quill dipped in eroton oil somethingthat makes horrtMr looking pustulewhich disappears in a few days andleaves no mark 1 always thought thehotel man showed good sense in taking the course he did He was caughtin a trap and took the cheapest wayout The bare rumor of even a suspected case would probably havevolved a loss of 000O or 00000 Itwas far better to pay the 5000 andcharge It to educatiou New OrleansTimes- DemocratBe True to YourselfNobody is more entitled to the gratitude of his country than the man whoIs

war and one of Mr Lincolns most Intimate friends It relates to a Quaker philanthropist fromPhiladelphia who did not have a hairon his head but took a great interestin public affairs and was constantlycalling at the White House in behalfof somebody or other who happenedto be In trouble and took up a greatdeal of Mr Lincolns time The president treated him with great courtesyalthough his patience was frequentlytried One day when the philanthropist was particularly verbose and persistent and refused to depart althoughhe knew that important delegationswere waiting Mr Lincoln suddenlyrose walked over to a wardrobe in thecorner of the cabinet chamber and tooka bottle from a shelf Handing it tohis visitor he remarkedDid you ever use thi stuff on yourheadNo sir I never didVell remarked Mr Lincoln I advise you to try it and if at first youdont succeed keep It up They sayIts a good thing to make the hair growTake this bottle with you and comeback in six months and tell me how ItworksThe astonished philanthropist covered his polished pate with his broadbrimmed hat and left the room whileJudge Carter coming in with the nextdelegation found the preslaent over inthe corner doubled up with laughterat the success of his strategy and before he could proceed to business thestory had to be told Chicago RecordThe Power of the WhaleIf the whale knew its own power itcould easily destroy all the machinerywhich the art of man could devise forcatching him It would only be necessary for him to swim on the surface ina straight line ia order to break thethickest rope
