It requires every hunter tohave a license. It attaches a penaltyof $50 for the transfer of his license.The applicant pays $1 and the licenseauthorizes him to hunt anywhere inthe State, but only with the writtenpermission of the owners of the landon which he hunts.All resident land owners and members of their families jnay hunt upontheir own land without a license.Tenants and "members of their families may hunt upon their leaseholdwithout a license. Anyone huntingwthout a license will be fined not "lessthan S50 nor more than $200, to whichmav be added imprisonment in thecounty jail.The one purpose of this act, theuneexcuse for the restraints it imposes, isthat, as game and fish are valuablefoo.1 products, the production of gameand fish should be encouraged by legislation. One conception of the act is that itis intended to turn the whole Stateinto a large game preserve for laprivileged class. When that is the! case the law will fail. The desiip isto encouragetheincrease of birds of.allkinds and rharcater, and of game andfish of'every kind inTall our lands andstreams.Under the new law a game and fishcommision is established which is toi have charce of the propagation of suchgame birdH, game animals, fish, andsong and insectiveroua birds, and animals as they shall deem to be ofJpublicservice.The purpose of the law is too oftenoverlooked.

H. Taft, in an editorial admitsthe Democratic convention at Baltimore named the most dangerous manto the interests ot Republicanism inthe selection of Woodrow Wilsonas theDemocratic standard bearer. The Sunuses the iollowing language with reference to the manner of his nomination :"No candidate of any party sincepolitics began ever won in conventionhis nomination more fairlv and honorablv than Governor Waodrow Wilson.HeJJis nominated, if ever a candidatefor President was, for the sole reasonthat he is the choice of a majority ofthe Democrats of the United States.Since the convention met there couldnot possibly have been a more correctattitude than that which he has maintained, or a more honorable decorumand manly contest than that which hasbeen conducted in his behalf by r hismanagers and adherents. His successat Baltimore is due neither to chancenor to intrigue. It is free from theslightesttamt of'embarrassing bargainor corrupt procurement. It has beenachieved over every obstacle whichhonest opposition or masked jealousycould nut inthe why. It results, asthe record of the forty-six ballotsshows Jbeyond the Dossibihty of dispute, and as the Sun is glad to say thismorning, simply from the justly earned increment of strength and the'cumulative impulse of obvious expediency."Buv it now.

Iam reliably informed that this is doneto prevent the breeding of mosquitoes.A moment's thought of the seriousdanger will, I am sure, convince youthat it is unwise to put kerosene oilin pails intended solely for use in extinguishing fires. Such oil would helpfeed a blaze and is also dangerous because persons might throw lightedmatches into the pails."HAVE FUN WITH DYNAMITEBoys Try to Eat Explosive and FeedIt to the Family Cat Disillusionment Stopped by Rescuers.Orange, N.

Since its organization in 1906, the Blue Grass Fair hastaken full rank with the largest andthe best of the State Fairs and Expositions of the country. It has veryjustly become known as the greatesthorse show in the world. It is theonly Fair which offers a full quota anda classification for breeding classes ofthe three great breeds of Americanhorses, as well as show classes, simplified and arranged in a mannerwhich makes their distinction clear.Pitched on a larger and more extensive scale than ever before, with thecertainty of increased interest on account of various added features, thisyear's Fair promises to eclipse all previous records.Numerous additions and improvements have been made in matter ofshow rings and amusement featureshave been secured of a kind and toan extent that justify the belief thatthe Fair will prove not only more valuable than ever to the live stock interests of Kentucky, but also more attractive to those who visit it. In addition to the weanling and yearlingdivisions of the great Saddle HorseFuturity, three stakes are offered inthe show classes for Saddle Horses.Attractive Program Each Day.One of the most attractive programsfor the week will be on Wednesdaywhen the classes for standard bredhorses will be shown.In addition to the cash premiums offered seasons to the leading horses inservice are donated by various owners and should attract the attentionof the entire horse world.Besides, such great performers andsires as Kentucky Todd, Walnut Hall,(the sire of the Harvester 2:01) Tregantle, Cochato, Vice Commodore,John A. McKerron, etc. Mr. David M.Look, of New York, donates a seasonto the great horse Bingen (sire of thechampion light harness horse of theworld Uhlan). The Fair will be opened on Monday, August 12th, at 2 p. m.,when an attractive racing program hasbeen arranged, interesting show ringswill be seen, and Innes' great bandwith Miss Beatrice Van Loon, soprano,will be heard. The Greater ParkerShows, the greatest on the road, willhold forth in "Gayety Lane," with thecleanest and best shows ever shownto a Kentucky audience.One Tuesday, the 13th, the big muleshow, always a most interesting feature of the Blue Grass Fair, will beshown, and Heresford cattle will alsobe seen.Various classes for sheep and swinewill be judged in the pens, and thepoultry and pigeons will be judged inthe poultry house. The 1912 divisonof the great Futurity will be shownin the afternoon.

The afternoon program is one ofthe most interesting of -the entireweek, as it includes all the championships in which final contests occur between the winners of the individualclasses during the preceding days ofthe Fair. The rule governing these2lasses require all animals eligible toshow in these rings, or foreit moneywon in the previous shows and thisrule will be strictly adhered to, the'reby assuring large fields and affording the public the opportunity of seeing the winners brought together.The American Saddle Horse Breeders' Association Special, for which amagnificent trophy is offered, fornest stallion or mare three years oldand under, will be contested on thisthe last afternoon.The week promises to be not only agala one in Lexington, but recordbreaking in the history of the BlueGrass Fair.INNES AND HIS BANDOne of the Big Musical Attractions atthe Blue Grass Fair.The newspapers of the country, incommenting on Bandmaster Innes' appointment as Director-in-Chief of Music at the World's Fair held last summer at Seattle, Wash., proclaimed himone of the really great bandmasters ofthe world. That he is indeed so isbest evidenced by the regard in whichhe is held by great musicians throughout the continent and by his ability tovisit a city year after year and be welcomed by ever increasing multitudes.The longer Innes remains in a city,the more he is appreciated. He is resourceful and versatile and ever onthe lookout for some musical novelty.His programs, paradoxical as thestatement may seem, are a delight tothe musical and non-musical alike.Bandmaster Innes.Innes indeed is known as the King ofProgram Makers. If some composition given is above the heads of someof his auditors, a catchy encore iscleverly introduced, which, whilegood music, full of rhythm and melody, directly appeals to everyone without exception. It is in fact this quickness of response to the unspokenthought of his listeners that has entrenched him so firmly in the heartsof his admirers.Innes' coming engagement the weekof August 12 to 17 at the Blue GrassFair, accompanied as he will be by thefull strength of his sixty-two playersand several notable Grand Opera Artists, promises to be an occasion ofmore than local interest.POULTRY SHOWThe Blue Grass Pair has this yearbecome a member of the AmericanPoultry Association, and the exhibit inthis large and important departmentwill be governed by the rules of thatAssociation. This is a guarantee ofequal rights and justice to all.A classification embodying premiums for over 300 classes of poultryand pigeons has been prepared, andthe management expects this year tobe, as usual, a great show.In addition to the cash premiums,the Blue Grass Fair and a number ofmerchants of Lexington have donated20 handsome silver cups, ten for poultry and ten for pigeons. The show isin charge of the same excellent andefficient committee as in pastr twoyears, and Mr. S. B. Lane, of Spiceland, Ind., has been secured to act asjudge. Dr. C. W. Trapp, of Lexington,will judge the classes for pigeons. Anentrance fee of 25 cents for each birdwill be charged and the managementhope that this, together with theAmerican Poultry Association rules togovern, will confine the entries to realowners of birds.The West is rapidly becoming themusical center of America, a-nd it isin recognition of this that the headquarters of Innes and his band haverecently been moved from New Yorkto Chicago. In welcoming the famousbandmaster to Chicago, one of theleading newspapers of that city said:"In response to the invitation ofmany of Chicago's most prominentpatrons of music, Innes and his orchestral band of sixty players haveremoved their general offices and official home from New York to the Cityof Chicago. The series of popularconcerts announced to be given bythe organization will fittingly markthis latest addition to ,the musicalforces of our city." c,amHaaaaaaaaaaaaaaHalaaLVAny Symptoms in Paris?Thatthe hook-worm is one of thegreatest menaces to the health of the,people in Kentucky, and that casesnow exist in 107 of the counties, was astatement made Tuesday in Louisvilleby Dr. Arthur McCormack. a memberof the Slate and County Health Officers' Conference. He said that littlewas knownof the disease with all ofthe investigations that had been rrlirde.frThe'cheif obstacles in the way ofgaining information, he said, is theattitude of doubt assumed by physicians. He admitted that he, ith otherdoctors, in 1910 doubled the existenceof the hookworm in Kentucky and evenquestioned its existence.In the course of their pursuit of thehookworm Dr. McCormack said thathe, as well as his colleagues, wereastounded at the frequencv of intestinal parasites, exclusive of thehookworm. Of 8,000 persons'examinedin all parts of Kentucky, he sraid 45per cent were afflicted by some sort of ;worm of whose presence the ssuffererknew nothing.He stated that infeclion of this kindoften caused indigestion and ki: dredailments. The hookworm does not invade the city, but thrives in the ruralcommunities where sewage is lacking.If you are a housewife you cannotreasonably hope to be healthy or beautiful by washing dishes, sweeping anddoing houswork all day, and "crawlinginto bed dead tired at night.

Tobacco CropThe Cincinnati Enquirer, following its annua custom, has issueda report of the estimated yield of the1912 tobacco croo, as compared withthat of the 1911 crop. The report ismade after a ranvass of the Enquirer,through its correspondents throughoutthe tobacco growing sections cf the'country, The Enquirer'says, in part :"Unless all indications fail and disastrous conditions confront the tobacco crop of the United States duringits growing season the 1912 yield,while establishing no new record, Willbe considerably heavier thn last year."There is an apparent tendency inpractically every section of the country to plant more tobacco than a yearago, except perhaps thoughout thecigar-growing sections of Ohio, wherethe farmers have become discouragedbecause of the )low prices which haveDrevailed for their product the pastfew years."Notwithstanding the uncertainweather conditions which have beenexperienced in many parts of the tobacco-growingregions the crop seemsto have gone into the field for the mostpart under fairly favorable conditions."The talk about the ten-year poolingmovement in Kentucky appears tohave carried'but little weight with thegrowers, and it is doubtful if thishad anv effect on the contemplatedacreage 'whatsoever. The increasedplanting in Kentucky, while not otsignificantly large proportions,! leaveslittle room to doubt that even withpoor growing weather the yield will beheavier than in 1911. Practically allthe large producing states, exceptingOhio, show a wider area planted to tobacco this vear, notably in NorthCarolina, South Carolina, Pnnsylvania,Virginia, West Virginia andjWisconsin."The lateness of tne season throughthe Middla West, including the vasthurley .belt of Kentucky, Ohio andIndiana, appears to have been moretalk than fact, and while the plants inmany sections went into the field fromone to three weeks later than a normalseason the delay seems to have beenbeneficial to the growth of the rlantsin .the beds rathpr than otherwise.Another thing that has helped materially in setting out a larger acreagethis year is the abundance of healthythrifty plants, and the unusual lack ofserious trouble with the plant beds."A careful canvass by Enquirercorrespondents in the varioua countiesof Kentucky. Ohio and Indiana, and inthe various tobacco producingof the country indicates a totalco area for 1912 amounting to972 acres. This is a gain ofacres over the area estimatedbeginning of the planting season in1911, and a clear gain over the harvested acreage of last year, amounting to154,283 acres, or 015 !per cent. Calculations based on the average yield peracre for the past ten years in the various states included in the accompanying statistics indicate a total tobaccoyieldtfor the United States this yearof 911,098,600 pounds. This is an increase over the harvested vield of lastyear of 17,0388,100 pounds" or about 18percent. It is also interesting tojiotein this connection that the 1912 estimate fall short of the bumper cron of1910 by only 19,680,050 pounds."Children's Wash Dresses, 50c, 75 c, $1.Ladies' one-piece Serge Dresses, $4.98.(All Colors)51Mwbt&itsLadies' and Misses' Fine Tailored Suits, $9.95. yWhite Nuback Shoes, $3.5it VS2P'jzzSpecial Values on Millinery, Skirls and Waists. &jmi fn Df" "JJx "jj&mParis, KentuckyiicS5I7i'jAVi,J-V VLLtCb'eltvbJS 'Si JiWZiVf tiY AY Zf.T.f a 'rflW WJ vdS '.Jj.'iliss-a'&MMxiMjamjJXii)un.jLZ2aHZLMU&lxriBmm..JflJWrttffW.- .yifLiHwawmig WkmMJWtij&"iejWhat would it mean to you lo haveheat and dirt banished from your kitchenthis summer to be free from the blazingrange, free from ashes and soot?II I I IT i t Vt'1 .'.MOil Cook-SteveWith the New Perfection Oven, the New PerfectionStove is the most complete cooking deviceon the market.U :. ;,! . muck and handv. too. for washing and ironing.STANDARD OIL COMPANY(Incorporated in Kentucky) lCoriagftM, Ky.: LoukriHe, Ky.; Atlaata, Ga Birminghaca.

London Chronicle.Paris Wins Close Game From theLawmakers.By the masterly pitching of Hauser,his timelv drive in the tinal sessionand the opportune hit of Dunlap whichcounted the iirst run, Paris was ableto snatch an extra inning contest fromthe League leaders at White Park yesterday afternoon.The contest was fast and , snappyand une of the most interestine one onthe local lot this season, rlhe scrappy,mood in wmch Manager Gfroerer, ofthe J-awmal:eis. allowed himself to beplunged into probably added a littlesnap to the exhibition but with all itwas nothing short of disgraceful andto say tl e least did not meet with avery hearty approval.Hauser was at his best throughoutthe ten-inning struggle, and had itnot Deen for a couple of errors in theeighth frame the Lawmakers wouldhave been completely blanked andPan's would have come out at the closeof the final session with the long endof the run column.Another fact is the locals accomplished the defeat ot the mighty Emory, who came with a string of victories almost too long to measure.While the visitors out-hit our boys byone point, the diives sent into sate territory werej)f less consequence and outof lour extra base hits three of thenumber were to the credit of the locals.For the occurence which ook placeyesterday no one is more to blame thanUmpire Kelly, who in his official position could have nut a stop to themanuevers ot Gfroerer, who after a.tacking he Paris pitcher engaged in awar of words with the bleacheritesand the occupants of the stand, threatening to do violence. Not until anofficer threatened him with ejectiondid he become reconciled.The game was a prettv exhibitionso far as ball playing is concerned andwas marked by many brilliant plavson both sides. The first run for Pariscame in the fifth when Harrell singledand Dunlap almost bursted the fencewith a stinging drive for three bases.The score was tied in the eighth whenNicholson singled DastMollenkamp,pilfered second, went to third on .Hicks'wild peg and scored when Lockefumbled Gust's roller.Ilauser won his own game in thetenth frame when Lock1, the secondman up, walked and pilfered second,scoring whengthe former sent a stinging drive to left.The Lawmakers will be the attraction at White Park tomorrow afternoonwhen the double-header scheduledwill be pulled off. Boniosh, the Indianhuiler, will be on the knob the openinggame which will be called at 2 o'clock.Thefact thatt ha Indian did not pitchthe game yesterday was due to his notbeing in proper condition and his workout yesterday afternoon will fit himfor the game this afternoon."
