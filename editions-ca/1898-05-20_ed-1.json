the proper time and a friend who hap
pened in at bis office on the morning of
Feb 23 was surprised at finding him
surrounded by his usual hopeless litter
of letters and papers
How does this happen Mr
he asked
Forgot it shortly answered the
editor
Well youre going to clean things
up today arent you
No sir was the reply That job
goes over under the rules for another
year You dont suppose I am going to
set an example of irregularity to the

And he cleared away a space on his
desk and began writing an editorial on

The Awkward Orderly
A young wag of an officer making a
morning call upon bis superior inthe I
latrCi s tent found him sound asleep
jwrLaps a little the worse for a nights
tarrying over the flowing bowl
The officer was tall and the cot was
short so that his feet stuck out at the
foot of the bed
Instead of waking him the visitor
took the spurs from a pair of boots
standing by the bedside strapped them
to the sleepers ankles and went away
The officer had pretty well lacerated
himself about the shins and ankles be
fore he woko up and instantly yelled to
his orderly
What do you mean by this he
screamed to the latter pointing to his
feet which were scarred and bleeding
The orderly looked at the spurs in
consternation
Ill forgive you this time for you
did it in the dark said the officer
but the nest time you yank my boots
and socks off so quick that it leaves my
spurs on Ill give you ten days in the
guardhouse do you hear New York

Queer Fishes
Amphibious fishes are to be found in
various quarters of the globe Begin
ning in Europe there is the blenny
which when kept in aquariums has
been proved to require at least an hours
pnre air out of water to preserve it in
good health and spirits In the tropics
is found the periophthalmus which is
singularly amphibious and hops over
the muddy flats in search of food nota
bly the crabs and mollusks left stranded
by the retreating tide This fish is so
active on land that it is difficult to
catch and various specimens brought
from Mauritius were secured by means
of a shotgun truly a unique method of
killing fish This fish is also found at
Ceylon and it is noticeable that when
chased they prepare to escape by land
rather than by water they really seem
to appreciate the sport Chicago News

frequent desire to urinate or pain in the

There is comfort in the knowledge so often
expressed that Dr Kilmers Swamp Root
the great kid ey remedy fulfills every wish
in relieving pain in the back kidneys liver
DJaacierana every part or tne urinary pas
lowing use oi liquor wine or oeer ana over
comes that unpleasant necessity of being
compelled to get up many times during the
night to urinate The mild and the extraor
dinary effect of wamp Root is soon realized
It stands the highest for its wonderful cures
