! Important Notice to the Public.
The Board of Health would again
most respectfully impress upon the
citizens of Paris generally, and those
in the Henry Addition and along Vine
street especially, to boil thoroughly,
every drop of water used for drinking
purposes. It is easier to do this than
to suffer the horrors of typhoid fever.
Keep out all flies and preserve all
cleanliness about your premises. When
ill, do as directed by your physician.
Respectfully,
A. H. KELLER, Health Officer.

" The faculty recital at the M. P. C.
Friday evening was one of the most
brilliant in the history of the institu
tion. Miss Blackmon, instructor in
voice.was unable to appear on the pro
gram on account of recent illness
however she is improving nicely and
able to discharge all of her duties.
The program was calssbal and was
appreciated by all present. Misses
Nell and Best, as members of the
faculty, have appeared before Millers
burg audiences before and we felt that
we knew what to expect, but they sur
passed theSmost sanguine expectations.
Miss Nell handles her bow with the
ease and grace of an artist. Her tones
are pure and sweet and expression
divine. She carries her hearers with
her through all the intricate passages
of a difficult work and when all is over
leaves them thirsty for more.
Miss Best is a Millersburg girl of
whom all are- justly proud. In piano
she excells anyone that has ever resid
ed here. She studied in Germany
under some cf the most eminent mas
ters and in her is a combination of the
master mingled with an originality
that is purely her own.
Miss Walker is the one new member
of the faculty whom all desired to
Vioox EVnm tho tirtw flho marip hpr
first appearance before the footlights
she captivated her audience and was tne
recipient of numerous -enchores. Her
tones are passionate, strong and clear
and at the same time appealing,
pathetic and sweet. Her dramatic ac
tion is in keeping with the rest of her
work and to judge from her perfor
mance on that occasion no one can
make a mistake in trusting work in
expression to her care.
At the close of the exercises Dr.
Fisher announced that the boarding
department was practically full and
there were others yet to come. The
water system has been completed and
there is no reason in the future v.h7
there should tver be any shortage. A

domestic training. After these an
nouncements tne entertainment ciosea
and everybody repaired to the library
and parlors on the first floor where an
informal reception was held and all
were given an opportunity to meet the
faculty and young ladies. It was an
evening that will long be remembered.
Millersburg is soon to have electric
lights and work on the plant is being
rushed to completion. Workmen ate
now engaged in digging a well at the
power house, which is to be completel
at the expense of the city. The ma
chinery is now enroute here and just
as soon as it arrives it will be installed
and put in operation. It is hoped this
little city will be out of darkness by
the winter months.
Handsome invitations have been re
ceived here announcing the Conway
Sherad nuptials on Wednesday, Sepr
tember 11 at Los Angeles, Cal., the
home of Miss Conway. Miss Mayme
Conway is the only daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. D, D. Conway and her early
life was spent in Millersburg, remain
ing here until after her graduation at
the M. F. C. After this the family
moved to Cincinnati, O., where they
resided for several years. More than
a year ago they went to Los Angeles
to make their home. Mr. Sherad is a
business man of Douglas, Kansas. The
young people will doubtless reside
there after their honeymoon.

and Sanitation.
There has been much concern about
Asiatic cholera and extraordinary means
have been taken to prevent its spread,
but what about the plague that is al
ways with us.
Typhoid fever is a disease of filth and
is caused by a germ, the "bacillus ty
phosus." This germ usually gains en
trance to the body in the food or drink
ing water, but may be directly commu
nicated by the patient. The house fly,
or. as it is aDtlv termed. thfi "tvnhnW
fly," .soneof the principal agenfs of
infection.
The house fly breeds in filth and noth
ing else, born in human excrement, ani
mal manure, collections of garbage,
mouldy paper and filth of all descrip
tions, the house fly spells sloth, stupidi
ty, and sins against sanitation.
The descendents of a single fly in four
months may total 214,557, 844, 320, 000,
000,000,000. All manure and garbage should be
promptly taken away, all garbage cans
screened and sprinkled with chloride of
lime.
The house and kitchen shoul be screen
ed and great care taken in screening all
food, and especially fruit, milk and food
that are not cooked. Keep the fly from
all filth and it will be a harmless pest.
We have annually in the United
States 300,000 cases of- typhoid, and
25,000 deaths. From 1880 to 1909, the
death rate per million population fell
from 260 to 60 in England and Wales,
while the decrease in the United States
was from 431 to 220, which goes to
show that England and Wales are far
ahead of us in sanitation, and have
beaten us in the race for the destruc
tion of the filth foci of typhoid fever.
All houses and business places should
be connected with the sewer as the or
dinary sewage vault is a disgrace to hu
manity, but can be rendered less ob
jectionable by a very liberal use of dis
infectants. Where sewer connection is not to be
had, a dry earth or sanitary pail closet
is by far the best and should be fre
quently emptied, sprinkled with chlo
ride of lime, and always screened from
flies.
It is estimated that the money loss
from tyDhoid fever in the UnitedStates
is $350,000,000 a year, as it usually at
tacks adults under the age of 40, whose
earning power is large.
Perfect sanitation and the destruc
tion of the house fly minimizes, if not
entirely does away with the dread
scourge of typhoid.
All drinking water should be filtered
through up-to-date filtering plants and
the pipes through which it is conveyed
to your homes should be cleaned out !
from time to time, to prevent dire and
vegetable growth from adhering to
them, and if the least doubt of the
water, boil it before drinking or using
in the preparation of food or cleansing
of vessels in which food is Kept.
Annual death rate from typhoid per
million 1905 to 1908:
Germany 53, Prussia 61, Scotland 74,
England 80, Ireland 91, Belgium 122,
Austria 156. Italy 283, United States
288, Spain 362.
In conclusion I will say, don't joi"
the soreheads and chionic grumblers,
but try and help the Health Board, who
like yourself, have much to learn about
this question of sanitation, but are
working for civic pride and the com
mon good, at some expense and loss of
time- and without any remuneration ex
cept the hope of doing some good for
thoir fellow man.

clear days for their exhibition held
here the first week in September, the

at a meeting of the directors Satur

came out about even on the sixty-fifth

for the unfavorable weather con

, gone down in history as the largest
ever held.

fears of an early frost.
