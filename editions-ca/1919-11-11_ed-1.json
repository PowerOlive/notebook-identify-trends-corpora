' BAKERY CHANGES OWNERS.
Another change in ownership has
taken place in the bakery formerly
conducted by the Wilmoth Grocery
Co., who sold out their business to
Sheehaii & Co., of Georgetown. Mr.
Sheehan has disposed of his interests
and good. will in the concern, to the
firm of Glass & Murphy, of George
town. The new firm has taken
charge, and will continue to conduct
the business at the old stand. Both
are excellent business men, and will
be welcome additions to the business

HOUSING PROBLEM SERIOUS.
Inquiries are made at THE NEWS
office very frequently, "Can you tell
me where I can find one or two
" rooms for 'rent," or "Do you know
of a house for rent." This presents
- the fact that the housing problem
has assumed a serious phase in
.Paris.
It has become almost impossible
to secure a dwelling house of any
description and almost equally im
possible to get living rooms. The
storage warehouses in Paris are fill
ed to the limit with household
goods, placed there because of the
inability of the owners to rent a
home. There is great need of a
large number of small cottages here
.for renters.

"Apple Blossom time in Normandy"
" could not very well be applied to
v "pumpkin-raising time in Bourbon,"
yet apple blossoms are in evidence
on f. Bourbon county tree. A big
tree in an orchard on J. T. Cay
wood's place near North Middletown
has created considerable interest
from the fact that it is bearing a
new covering of .beautiful blossoms,
just like the spring time brings. The
same tree had blossoms on it
this time several years ago. The
tree lias been a remarkably good
producer, yielding yearly a large
crop of luscious apples.
Other localities report instances of
fruit trees being in bloom, an un-
. 'usual occurrence for this time of
year. The Maysville Bulletin has
the following:
"Mr, A. L. Glascock brought to
the Bulletin office a small branch
from one of the pear trees on his
place near this city, which is in full
bloom, a most unusual thing for this
time of the year. The twig that we
have on our desk at this writing has
clusters of well-opened blossoms
and small, tender new leaves just
.putting out. Mr. Glasscock tells us
that, the entire large tree is white
"with bloom."

HUNTERS TAKING OUT HUNTING
LICENSES.
Preparing for the open season on
quail and rabbits, which takes effect
on next Saturday, November 15,
Paris and Bourbon county nimrods
have been busy securing the required
license from the office of County
Clerk Pearce Paton. Up -to yester
day, a large number of these docu
ments had been issued. The number
is about the same as in 1918, when
all previous records were broken,
despite the fact that many local
young men were handling army
rifles instead of shotguns and shoot
ing Huns instead of rabbits.
County Clerk Paton asks that
hunters contemplating roving the
fields this fall apply for license the
early part of tills week. Every fall
there is a rush just before the shoot
ing season opens, which inconven
iences the office force and those ap
plying for the license.
Reports from farmers in various
portions of the county state that the
bird and rabbit crops both seem to
be plentiful this year, there being as
usual many more rabbits than birds.
Pew squirrels have been shot this
year aespite the fact that the sea
son opened July 1. The open sea
son for rabbits and birds ends Jen

SWEARENGEN
Following a long illness; due to
the inroads of tuberculosis. William
G. Swearengen, aged thirty-three,
died at three o'clock Friday after
noon, at the home of his sister, Mrs.
Julian Howe, on Mt. Airy, on Mt.
Airy avenue, in this city.
Mr. Swearengen was the son of
Mr. and Mrs. W. G. Swearengen, for
merly of Paris, who moved to Car
thage, Ohio, some years ago. He re
ceived his education in the schools of
Paris, and graduated with honors in
the Paris Public School. He after
ward attended State College, in Lex
ington. He took a great interest in
athletics, and was a star pitcher of
the old Paris baseball team, and
later was selected captain of the
State College team. He was a young
man of great promise, and was
possessed of a genial nature that
made him a host of friends. Every
body liked "Billy" Swearengen, and
none knew him but to esteem him
highly. In late years Mr Swearen
gen had been engaged in business in
Cnicago, where he occupied a re
sponsible position with a large mer
cantile oncem.,a He remained there
un,til about two years ago when" de
clining health forced him to retire.
The disease which had fastened upon
him made such inroads that his
Playgoers of this city will be given
an opportunity to" pass judgment on
the new Mark Swan farce, "She
Walked In Her Sleep," when it will
be presented at the Lexington Opera
House as the attraction beginning
Friday -and Saturday, November 14
and 15, Saturday matinee.
This pre-eminently successful
farce has already been seen both in
New York and Chicago, and is said
to have highly pleased theatre"pat
10ns in these very large cities.
The story has to do with the
somnambulism of a young and pretty
girl, shielded only by the sheerest
of nightgowns, who enters various
rooms other than her own, thereby
arousing various doubts, suspicions
and jealousies in the minds of wives j
