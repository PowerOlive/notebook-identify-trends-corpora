ECLIPSE OF
APRIL 21.
MOON ON
A total lunar eclipse will be vis
ible throughout the United States
the night of April 21. The moon then
will be north of the center of the
earth's shadow, but nevertheless near
enough to it to become' completely
immersed. At 11:57 o'clock in the
evening the moon first touches thj
penumbra, but it will not be until
well after midnight that the darken
ing becomes conspicuous. Three min
utes after 1 o'clock in the morning
of April '22 the edge of the tru
shadow will be reached and more ahd
more of the moon will be hidden
until at 2:23 o'clock it will be com
pletely obscured except for the faint
reddish light refracted through the
earth's atmosphere.
Totality will last only forty-two
jminutes and the moon will be entire
ly clear of the shadow at 4:26 o'clock
though it does not leave the penum
bra until 5:22 o'clock.
The bright star Spica will be with
in ten degrees of the eclipsed moon
making a very pretty spectacle for
anyone who will be up to see it.
