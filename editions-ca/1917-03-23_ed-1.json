death, but could not obtain leave of ab
sence, having just been transferred
from the U. S. S. Perkins, stationed in
Southern waters, to the U. S. Ship
Panther, now in Boston harbor.
Miss Harris was one of the brightest
students of the Paris High School,
where she was a universal favorite
with, pupils and teachers. She was a
member of the Christian church and,
the Sunday school. Her untimely
death has spread a shadow over the
community, as her short, but happy
life was spent here, and every hear
must surely be touched with deepest
sympathy for the mother, from whose
home the light of the household has
fled, in this, her second and most
crushing bereavement. For fifteen
years, bright, sunny years for the
mother this young girl had not only
been her joy and comfort, but her
sweet, childish presence had brought
a wealth of sunshine and happiness
into the lives of her friends and play
males. None bpt those ivho have sat
in the shadow, of a great bereavement.
-1 such, as the death of this fair young
girl must be, can justly weigh such a
sorrow as death brings.
