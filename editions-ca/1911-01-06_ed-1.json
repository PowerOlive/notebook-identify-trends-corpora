something in the room. On looking up
he saw the plastering falling from the
ceiling. A moment later the blaze
was visihle above. The alarm was
quickly spread but owing to the hour
and sevreity of the weather the im
promptu hre company was delayeu in
getting on the scene with the engine,
on account of the intervening distance
between the Judy home and the engine
house.
, But little was saved from the front
of the building, but a good deal was
taken from the back part The build

of the first purchasers of a lot when

Alabama, who likes poetry, picked up
Lord Byron's works and read "The
Prisoner of Chillon." He was about
to start on his annual tour of the
State prison and the convict camps.
The poem so deeply impressed him
that after visiting the convicts he exer
cised wholesale clemency, paroling one
hundred long-terra prisoners, forty of
them convicted of homicide and twenty
being life convicts.
These are the lines of Byron which
so worked upon the Governor's human
sympathies that he sat down and wrote
out the documents liberating the priso.

My haii' is gray, but not with years,
Nor grew it white
In a single night,
As men's have grown from sudden
fears,
My limbs are bowed, though not with
toil,
But rusted with a vile repose,
For they have been a dungeons spoil.
And mine has been the fate of those
To whom the goodly earth and air
Are banned and barred forbidden
fare.
"I gave the matter careful consider
ation," said the Governor, "and I
could find no good reason for keeping
these men who had served so long and
so disastrously to their own health and
happiness."
These paroles are issued only to
prisoners who have good prison
records, and in practically every cane
members of the Board of Pardon3 were
neartily in accord with them.

Miss Ethtl Warren, a prominent
young woman of Lawrenceburg, was
attacked Monday and brutally beaicn
by a negro brute whose identity has
not been learned and who is being
sought by a posse of determined citi

in a dry goods store, was enroute
home from work when she observed
the negro following her. The negro
overtook her, knocked her down and
choked her. Defending herself
against her assailant she broke an

The young woman is prostrated over

Identification is expected to be easy on
account of wounds indicted on the
negro's hand by the young woman's
