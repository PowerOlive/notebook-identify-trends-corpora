Bran and ships toff 'are are really too
higb to be conaidered.and ready, mixed
patent feeds are still, higher. Many
have learned, from, experience that,
"ready made" feeds dovnot pay. Corn,
cottonseed meal ancLsometimes- a. little
bran or oil meal- are used to mix with
mill dust and weed seeds for filler.
Some are honestly, made but all"read?
made" feeds are made at a- profit of
five to ten:dollarsper ton,, which can
be saved by .mixing at home and even
better results obtained,. Nothing can
be said in favorof. condimental feeds
or conditioners.-
Many mixed f eed3 selling from $30
to $35 per ton have from ten to twenty
per cent protein, " when, cottonseed
meal, containing 36 to 41 per cent pro
tein, can be obtained for lesathan $30
per ton. Dritd.distiller's grains con-ta.ing-about-24-per
cent digestible
protfcin cost about 30 or less, being a
very, much cheaper source of protein
than bran.
Many successful idairymen. are mak
ng up their own. Tationa such as corn
chop cr corn and cob meal, four hun
dred pounds, and cottonseed, meal one
hundred pounds, and dry distiller's,
grains one hundred . and fifty pounds,
makes a good, ration, the mixture
being fed in proportion to milk yield,
as previously described. Good clover
onalfalfa hay, chopped fina and. mixed
with the corn chop, and cottonseed
;meal,will make, the feed light and
, bulky, as is desired lor cows. Since
two thousand two hundred pounds of
alfalfa hay is.equal to a ton of bran,
there is.little need of. expensive con
centrates with alfalfa.
The wiser daryman who makes? the
moat money will grow silags and corn
and hay rich in protein and buy protein
only in tbe shape of cottonseed meal,
oil meal and gluten feed.
A- common fault in feeding, is the use-
too much ciam and leeding all
cows alike, regardless of production.
Different kinds or combinations of
the butterfat con
tent of milk.
Questions regarding dairy cow feed
ing wii be gladly answered.. Mention
the prices of feed you have or can.
