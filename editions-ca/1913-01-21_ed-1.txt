If theyare right in their contention'.that sometariff revision would lessen our exports, one would naturally think thatGreat Britain, with free trade, wouldhave perished long ago.But'Great.Britain is not perishing.For the month of November the totalamount of trade in Great Britain was$620,000,000. The increase in exportsas compared with the "boom" figuresof November, 1911, was $11,760,000.There is now full employment for labor in that "benighted" free tradekingdom. Even the protectionists areforced'lo admit "a cycle of splendidtrade and national well being," andthat there is no protectionist countrythat shows a parallel propserity.Theie is food for reflection in thesefigures. They show there is nothingto the contention that revision downward of the tariff is likely to ruin business. Honest business men of thecountry fully realize this, and have noapprehensions because of a Democraticascendency.Democratic Pledges.5 "We want to get a large amount fofrevenue on luxuries, so that we canput a less tax on the necessities oflife."This is to be-the baeis of the tariffrevision in the- Sixty third Congress,according to Chairman Underwood, ofthe Democratic Ways and Means Committee. The above expression is Mr.Underwood's. He made it directly toone of the big silk manufacturers whowas testifying before his committee.The indications are that a featureof the Democratic policy is likely tobe free dressed and rough lumber,shingles, laths nd fence posts. Themembers of the Ways and Means Committee, while asking questions of witnesses.Jappeared to be in favor of thatpolicy.Free meats, it is rumored, may alsobe a nartof.the tentative tariff plarithe committee will frame to submit tothe extra session.The very air in the corridors outsideof the committee room seems tobreathe a feeling that the Democraticleaders intend to see to it that thepromises made to the people beforeelection are to be religiously carriedout.Hadn't Done So Badly."I might have married a millionaire," declared Everywoman. "One ofmy old schoolmates is now one.""And several of your schoolmates areworking right in this town for $10 aweek," retorted Everyman, "while oneof them is in jail. I guess in marrying a chap getting ?1,500 a year youraverage is fairly good." And thenEverybaby set up a howl and theyhad to stop quarreling to attend tonim. Pittsburg Post.Promise to Humanity."Broken bones repaired and woundshealed while you wait." This, is thepromise that the present year of graceholds out to suffering humanity, according to no less an authority thanDr. Alexia Carrell of the RockefellerInstitute of Medical research and winner oft he Nobel prize of 1932 for themost important discovery in the fieldof medicine and physiology.Nevertheless Dr. Carrel's predictionthat the present year will see the marvel of broken bones knied and in useWihin four days and wounds healed infa singlelay should not be taken too seriously. The new surcerv mav do dothof thes9 amazing things and more,but it will be well for the public .notto bank too heavily UDon the realization of the prediction.Caution in navigating an ice coatedsidewalk will continue to be almost asnecessary as in the days when theconsequences of at fall included amonth's stay in a hospital. Nor twillthe wise man deliberately 'undertaketo stop the progress of a 38 calibrebullet just to Demonstrate that Dr.Carrell. in an excesB of enthusiasm,did not exaggerate.We are willing to admit on thestrength of past performances thatmedical and surgical science will makerapid strides in 1913 very likely themost rapid ever made since the philanthropic wayfarer set out on his missionof relief. But it is always better toaccept rpsults as they come than tocount too much on prognostications.Complimentary.She "Why do you wish to know myage?"

Sow an act andyou reap a habit; sow a habit and youreap a habit; sow a habit and youreap a character; sow a character andyou reap destiny. George D. Board-man.Submits Interesting Facts Regarding Hookworm.In a recent issue of the WinchesterDemocrat, Dr. I. A. Shirley, of theState Board of Health, who attendedthe conference of sanitary workers inthe Southern States at Little Rock Arkansas, recently, gives the followingfacts which are of interest to the people all over Kentucky :First. It is the firm belief of everyone engaged in the work of improvingsanitary conditions in the South so ;asto make it possible to prevent diseaseand make life longer and healthier,from the Administrative Sanitary Secretary in Washington to the field menon the firing line, that no greater work. as ever been undertaken sincethat ofe meeK ana lowiy uauiean.Second. That eradication of thehookworm disease and not amelioration is not only Dossible but that nothing short of this" will suffice the workor the workers.Third. The same story came fromall parts of the Southland of well nighmiraculous cures.3 Fourth. The belief, born of experience, that no other disease holds itsunfortunate victim so long as hookworm disease; that no other diseasemakes the one afflicted with it forsuch a length of time a menace tothose aroundjiim; that no other disease of equal" macnitude is so surelyand speedily curable.Fifth. That no other disease showssuch a variety of symptoms and sometimes no symptoms at all, as hookworm disease.Sixth. That while as a rule it is tobe found where the sanitary conditionsare the worst; that is, here the priviesare not water tight and fly proof,:yetit is found under better surroundings' sufficiently often to make it the imperi ative duty of everyone who leavesideal environments for even a shorttime to seek examination lest themonster disease, like a thief in thenight, steals a march upon him, to bediagnosed when it may be everlastingly too late,.Seventh. Hookworm carriers,persons harboring very few worms andpositively without symtoms, except,occasionally, indigestion, are amongthe most dangerous members of thecommunity as propagators hence theduty that everybody owes to themselves and the community to be absolutely certain that they are free fromthese worms.Eighth. That the examination ofmore than thirty thousand people from118 countiei our own beloved State isfound to be one of the most heavilyinfected, and we earnestly hope forBuch a cooperation of our fighting facilities, county, municipal and individual, that ere long it can be truthfullysaid that Kentucky, the flower of theconstellation of Southern States, is forone, at least, free from this blightingcurse.Ninth. That every citizen who hasnot already done so, should secure acopy of theBulletin of the State Boardof Health from its office in BowlingGreen, telling about this disease andshould submit the necessary specimenso they can.knowwhethr they have itor not.Worthy of Adoption.A Rhode Island Rhodes scholar (noconnection between the Rhodes andRhode), who contributes an entertaining article to Brown Alumni Monthlyon Oxford undergraduate life, saysthat the afternoon at Oxford is givenover to athletic exercise. Hardly ahalf-dozen undergraduates in the college will be found at work betweenthese hours. Games for physical development and the genuine sport ofplaying them here is an English ideathat is worthy of being adopted inAmerican colleges as the system ofexamination by subjects. No matterhow immaculate the status of the athletes, there can be no doubt thatAmerican college athletics have beensadly "professionalized" at the expense of a willingly subservient majority.Early Visitors to Kansas City.The first white men to travel overland from Santa Fe, N. M., to St.Louis were Pedro Vial, Josef VicenteVillanueva and Vicente Espinosa,who left Santa Fe on May 21, 1792,and ended their journey October 7.They passed the present site of Kansas City in September, after havingbeen held prisoners for several daysby the Cances (Kaw) Indians. "Wereached their village," Vial wrote inhis diary, "which is located on theRiver of the Cances. That river flowsinto the river called Misoury. We remained there until the 11th of September, when a Frenchman came with apirogue laden with various sorts ofmerchandise, by permission of thegovernment, to trade with that tribe."Kansas City Star.AUTOMOBILESSupplies of All Kinds, Repairing, Etc.S f"- ?vIf"'V.4 'vySourhon Stararge$f Supply Co.I C.

Besides there are millionsof acres of land that are now Deducing spring and summer crops thatcould be profitably turned into winterpastures."Another distinct advantage ofstock raising in the Southern Statesarises from the fact thatjthe expensiveshelters for the wintering of the stockwhich are required in all of the morenortherly regions are not necessary."Ranks Seventh as Coal State.Washington.

Washington Star.m 'ir-jr jayROMANS HAD MANY SLAVES!In Some Households There WereHundreds of Servants Whose Duties Were Manifold.The Roman deprived himself ofmany private comforts that lie mightmake a rich display before his guests.The wealthy man's dwelling was verylarge: the so-called1 House of the Faunit Pompeii occupies an entire square;that of the Roman noble usually covered a far greater area.The care of a lordly residence required the service of a multitude ofslaves; we hear of a man who in thecountry and city together employedmore than four thousand. They wereorganized somewhat like an army, indivisions and companies under theirseveral overseers. Each servant hadas his special duty some minute partof the household work. Many wereneeded for the ceremonies attendingthe admission of guests, many for thecare of the' baths, bedrooms, kitchenand dining rooms, as well as for thewardrobes, toilet and personal service of the various members of thefamily. On going out the master ormistress was accompanied by athrong of servants, whose number andsplendid livery advertised the rankand wealth of their owner. Othercompanies of slaves spun wool, madeclothes, kept the house in repair, andcared for the sick. There were somewhose task was to enforce order andquiet among the rest. We could hardly believe that so many persons in asingle household could find employment or that the processes of laborcould be so minutely portioned out,did we not take into account the genius of the Romans for organization.On the country estates were plowmen, herdsmen, vine dressers, gardeners, keepers of bees, poultry andfish and many other classes of laborers.

One of the other gentlemen on the program was William A.Chase, the dean of American painters.Mr. Chase occupied a seat upon theplatform somewhat to Mr. Evans' left."And so," said Mr. Evans, "I believethat my conclusions are justified. Iam sure that our dear friend, Mr.Chase, will support me in this. Is notthat so, Mr. Chase?"Mr. Evans turned to gaze benignantly upon Mr. Chase. The feminine audience rustled expectantly and cranedits several rounded necks to beholdMr. Chase.Mr. Chaise, head silghtly upon oneside and eyes closed, slept sweetly on."Ah poo." Mr. Chase breathed softly through his parted lips. BaltimoreSun.Training Children of Wealth.Not all wealthy people are foolish,although many who inherit meansmay do foolish things. No mother,who has to work for a living, hasmore sensible methods of bringing upchildren than Mrs. Edna Reahirt ofToledo, O., whose five-year-old son isto inherit a million when he becomesof age. He is being taught the valueof money by being obliged to earn thepennies he would spend. Then he isbeing taught habits of thrift by a simple bank system of his own. Hismother is not asking the courts for abig allowance annually in order tobring up 'the boy "according to hisstation," as it the possession of amillion made the child different fromordinary children. It is safe to saythat he will not grow up with extravagant, foolish notions, and thatwhen the million is put in his handshe will not know what to do with it"Set."What is the favorite word of theEnglish language?
