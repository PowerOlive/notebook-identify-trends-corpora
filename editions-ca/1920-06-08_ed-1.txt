Vance led an - attack onthis great movement. In the dailypaper fiom which this clipping was;gleaned this was so stated. Inasmuch as Dr. Vance is known allover the United States to have beenHie fostering spirit of this movement it seems only right to coirecrthe impression which this statement will make in the mind of tlvreader who i& not familiar withwhat happened at the Assembly ofthe Southern Church. Dr. -Vancenot being a delegate to the Assembly did not have the privilege tospeak, but by special request of theAssembly he went to the platformto state the origin of the movement,to explain its' purposes and toanswer any questions concerning it.This he did "with the coldness of aniceberg,' to use his own words notthat he was not still in great sympathy with the movement, but because of the limitations put uponhim by the Assembly. In no sensefould it be intimated that the father 'had deseited the child.

A placefor holding the reception will also beselected.The Heads of Houses, it is stated,come as representatives of the Louisjville Board of Trade and of wholesaleand industrial interests that do an anDual business of almost one billion dollars. Says President Joseph Burge, of theBoard of Trade:"Louisville Board of Trade manufacturers and wholesalers are alwaysirery happy to get into the Cumberlandmountain cities. There is no placewhere on previous trips we have beenreceived more graciously and wherewe have had a better time."We like the people, we like thescenery and we like the many evidenced of progress we see on everyside.""No section of the country we trulyfeel has a brighter future than theCumberland mountain section of Kentucky and Virginia. The way you aredeveloping your marvellous resourcesof coal and timber and oil augurs wonderful tilings for the future. Therapid construction of highways and ofother means of transportation is hastening that day."Louisville during recent years hascome more and more to appreciate themarvellous possibilities of the mountain section and our development tourshave probably taken us in recent yearsjust as often there as to any otherpart of the country."And last year when members of theLouisville Board of Trade authorizeda fund of $25,000 and used the moneysubscribed to send State and Government experts in the solution of problems of rural life to conduct Farmers'Community meetings in forty-two sections, the Cumberland mountain section was one of the first remembered."We look forward with unusual enthusiasm to our coming tour of themountains."HOW WOULD YOU I3KE TO BETHE GASMAN?Add to conditions that have become so common that we are apt torefer to them as "natural,", is thefact that the business of producing illuminating gas is in directcompetition with, between, six andseven million American, automobilesthat are engaged in using gasoline,with the result that 13,000,000 barrels were used in 1919 as comparedto 8,500,000 in 1918. And justkeep your eyes peeled for the 1920score sheet.During the last ten years the increase in the demand for pelroleuraproducts has increased 560 per cent,and during the same period the production of crude oil in the UnitedStates, has increased only 95 percent. All phases of the oil refiningindustry have been affected; but, olcourse, the biggest demand hasbeen for morto gasoline.To "both eat your cake and haveyour cake," is as difficult as it is forthe country 1o keep up with the demand for oil and petroleum products. Gas oil is one of the distillates of crude oil, and seventy percent, of the artificial gas producedin the country is made in processeswhich require the annual use ofabout 28,000,000 barrels of gas oil.With the gas industry ti ailing alongas the tail of the gas-eating-automobile-dog,while attempting tofurnish the necessities of life incompetition to pleasure-cars, it willbe seen that the gas n.an is in apretty bad predicament.Illuminating gas must go up inprice, even though the processes offranchises and old-bargains withcily governments are hard ' to disturb for while the public usuallygives in inch-by-inch to its utilities, it will not see them "bust," orput in so bad a hole that they haveto resort to that orher alternativeof "poor gas," with a low heatingvalue. The gas man is having Mbshare of difficulties, and while"pleasure at the helm" will not giveup any considerable part of theroad, neverthless the fairness ofthe American public may be depended upon to meet so serious a problem in a candid manner.oj.UE$Bji-!a?.. ."A. ,MWWMWMMtl'MC' IWornMade YSji!L&iBright eyes, a clear skin and a bodyfoil of youth and health may beyours if you will keep your systemin order by regularly takingGOLD MEDALThe wotld's standard remedy for kidney,liver, bladder and uric acid troubles, theenemies of life and looks.
