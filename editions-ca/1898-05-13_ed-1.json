TEE HOESES SHOES
HOW OFTEN THEY NEED REPLEN
ISHING AND WHAT THEY COST
Resetting Old Slioes Costs About Half as
Much as New Ones Tho Use of Rubber
Pads Carriage Horses Shoes Cost More
Than Those of Work Horses
A work horses shoes cost a good deal
more than ita drivers shoes do Truck
horses delivery wagon horses and the
great number of feorses used for various
working purposes including many
horses driven to hacks and other publio
carriages are ordinarily shod once a
month at a cost of 2 50 so that the
work horses shoes are likely to cost
30 a year anyway and there may be
some additional expense for sharpening
and resetting
Sharpening costs 150 Whether this
is necessary or not depends of course
primarily upon the weather It may de
pend much upon the time of day the
horse is driven There may be seasons
in which sharpening is not necessary
Not all drivers get the shoes of their
horses sharpened even when the going
is slippery Such going may come about
suddenly and unexpectedly and it may
be of brief duration and then there are
drivers who under ordinary circum
stances take the risk of the greater cost
of a broken shaft or an injured animal
to save the cost of sharpening Of work
horses in general probably something
more than half have their shoes sharp
ened when the going is slippery There
are some however whose shoes are al
most all kept sharpened at such times
these being the horses that work at
night and in the early morning before
the sun has softened the ice or melted
it away These include horses driven
to milk wagons bakers horses and so
on how often the shoes are sharpened
depending on the going
Usually when a horse is shod he is
shod all around Sometimes there is oc
casion to put on a single shoe as when
a horse throws a shoe The cost of a
single new shoe is one fourth the cost
of a set in the case of a work horse 63
cents The charge for resecting the old
shoe would be 35 cents Besetting in
general from one shoe up costs about
one half or a little more than half as
much as fitting a horse with new shoes
In putting on a single shoe an old shoe
would commonly be used to make it
match those remaining on If it is not
too much worn the shoe the horse has
cast would be put back if the driver
picked it up It is suitable and it fits
If it has not been picked up then a
slipper is put on from the pile in the
shop slipper being the shop name of
the worn shoe taken off and thrown
aside when a horse is reshod
Horses have peculiarities in wearing
their shoes just as men do Some wear
them off more at the toe some more at
the heel and some wear them more on
one side than on the other Horses
shoes wear off more quickly on granite
pavements than they do on asphalt and
the greatly increased use of asphalt
pavement has led to a correspondingly
increased use of rubber pads in horses
shoes to give the horses a better foot
hold Rubber pads as well as the shoes
are fitted to the horses foot and nailed
on with the shoe Shoes with rubber
pads of this kind for work horses cost
put on 4 or 5 a set They are likely
to wear longer than shoes without pads
but
set at
ty for reshoeing the horse at intervals
of about a month is due in a considera
end of a month when thev aro taU pn
off they are likely to be too much worn
to go another month and new shoes are
put on In the case of rubber pad shoes
if they are not too much worn they are
reset and this may be done in perhaps
40 or 50 per cent of the cases Some
times the old shoes may be put back
with new pads sometimes the old pads
with new shoes It depends a good deal
on the manner in which the horse wears
them So that while the first cost of
rubber pad shoes is considerably greater
than that of plain shoes the net cost is
not so much greater
The price oharged for shoeing a pri
vate coach or carriage horse is 1 more
than for shoeing a work horse or 3 50
and rubber pad shoes such as those de
scribed for carriage horses cost 5 or 6
a set Such horses are reshod ordinarily
like most horses once a month and as
a rule their shoes are also reset in the
middle of the month And the shoes of
private carriage horses are more com
monly kept sharpened in slippery weath
er than are those of work horses Wom
en are more likely to be disturbed by
the slipping of a horse than a man
would be and the carriage horses are
usually more valuable than work
horses and less risk of injury is taken
In some cases it might be that the
charge fot shoeing a horse either a car
riage horse or a work horse would be
according to the time required rather
than by the job as for example in
the case of a lame horse in shoeing
which more than the usual time would
be needed Shoes are made and fitted
to meet any requirement and the cost
might be according to the amount of
work and time expended from 1 to 5
for a single shoe New York Sun
