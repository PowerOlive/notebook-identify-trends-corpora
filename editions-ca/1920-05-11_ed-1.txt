The fuse in your line on the "main frame" mayblow out then your telephone is "dead."Switchboard cords are small flexible cables of manytiny wires; several of the little wires frequently snap fromconstant handling, then your connection "cuts off."The apparatus is sensitive to extremes of heat or cold,dust or moisture.

Ernst, whose candidacyfor the United States Senate has justbeen announced, to the average Kentnckian. His name has appeared throughoutthe state in connection with charitablemovements, war campaigns, churchand missionary work and drives to aidthe schools and school teachers, especially in the mountain districts.His charitable work, aggressivenessand progressiveness in civic movements and personal popularity havemade him one of the most generallyadmired men in Northern Kentucky.Ilis extensive work in the interestsof his state and its people began immediately upon Mr. Ernst's graduationfrom the famous Old Centre College,Danville, where he was valedictorianof liis class.Admitted to Bar.lie was admitted to the bar in Kenton county after examination by Senator John w. Stevenson and JudgeWilliam R. Arthur and since has practiced law in Covington and Cincinnatiwith the s:une atrgre ?ivenu and success that have featured every movement worth while into which he hasdirected his efforts.Glancing otver the long list of hisactivities one can see that he continually has enlisted himself in movements in which he could accomplishbest results for the people.As trustee nd a member of the Executive Committee of Old Centre College, Kentucky State University atLexington, and of Pikeville College,liis excellent advice and assistance inmatters of importance have been extremely beneficial to the students.Wars On Illiteracy.Recently he has taken a deep interest in the campaign teachers are waging for increased salaries and hasLeen taking active steps to secure better pay both for the teachers of theslate and for the professors in our colleges and universities. The mountainschools especially appeal to him andho has been an ardent supporter ofthe movement to wipe out illiteracyand to offer residents of the mountaindistricts better facilities for education.Mr. Ernst's continuous help hasbeen received by the churches of thestate, regardless of denomination. Heis an elder and succeeded" his fatheras superintendent of the Sundayschool, their terms of service covering a period of nearly SO 'years. Hehas been looking after educational andmissionary work in the mountains, asi'hairman of the State Committee ofhis church, and has succeeded in morethan doubling the amount heretoforegiven for this purpose.And his work does not end there.He is president of the Covington Y.M. C. A. and a member of the National War Council. As head of the Y.M. C. A. he has been mainly instrumental in erecting one of the mostcomplete and modern buildings to befound. 'Son in Active Service.He was active in every form of warwork and gave continuously of histime, labor and money, whenevercalled upon. His only son was serving at the front in France, as a captain in the regular army, when (hearmistice was signed. He had entered the army as a private during theMexican trouble and later passed hisexaminations at Washington, winninga second lieutenancy. Mr. Ernst'sson-in-law, John P. Darnall, of Flemingsburg, volunteered as a private andalso was in active service at the front.His wide and extensive business andprofessional experiences, as counsellor and advisor to many large financialand manufacturing concerns, has beenof unlimited value to his state andcommunity, as he has been called uponmany times to give advice when matters of big moment were being considered. Mr. Ernst's record of service in theRepublican party is a long one.Good Republican Record.Beginning as Councilman in Covington, he was kept in office by membersof both parties until he insisted on retiring. For many years he was on theState Central Committee and for fouryears served as its chairman. He hasrepre:ented his district a number oftimes at National Conventions and alsohas been one of the "Big Four'' fromhis state. It was he, who, "while statechairmen, established state headquarters at Louisville, since continuouslymaintained by the party. He also hasbeen a liberal financial supporter of theparty during all three years and oneof its wise counsellors.Mr. Ernst's, father was WilliamErnst, a banker at, Lexington, subsequently Covington. 'His mother wasSarah A. Butler, a Jessainine countygirl.It was through Mr. Ernst's instrumentality that the Covington Industrial Club was developed and throughhis efforts that the campaign to erectn magnificent headquarters for this remarkable civic organization was successful.ENOUGH BILLSIALL SHEISAYSWTotal Results Gained Prom OtherMedicines Before Taking Tm-, tona, Mrs. FranklinAsserts.LOUISVILLE, Ky., May 10, Another striking bit of proof of Trutona's remarkable reconstructivepowers for overcoming1 after-effects'of influenza, pneumonia a-nd thelike is to be &een in the followingstatement made recently by Mrs. A.E. Franklin, Louisville woman of1359 Preston street."After I had sufficiently recovered from the 'flu' to get out of bed,"Mrs. Franklin said, "I fund that Iwas very weak and dizziness in myhead w-benever I would walk rendered me unfit to do any kind ofwork. I had been troubled withconstipation for several years beforeI contracted influenza."Well, of course, I tried severaldiffeient kinds of medicines for mytroubles, but about the only resultsI got from fhem were bills. Itseemed that nothing would do meuny good. Finally I got a bottle ofTrutona and began taking it. Tomake a longr story short, to-day I'mfree from constipation. In additionto tnls I feel strong and find I can domore work than I've been able todo for a long time. That's why Irecommend Trutona."Just as Mrs. Franklin did, thousands of people have found Truto-nato be everything- that is claimed forit as a reconstructive agency, system-purifierand body invigorant aswell as an unsurpassed combatantfor stomach, liver and bowel. troubles, nervob&ness, sleeplessness, lossof appetite and the like.Trutona is sold in Paris at G.
