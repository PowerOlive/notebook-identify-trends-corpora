Thomas, of Paris, and suggests him as a candidate for theDemocratic nominaton for LieutenantGovernor. The Post says :"Among all the suggestions we seemade of possible candidates on theDemocratic State ticket this fall wesee no reference to Senator ClaudeThomas, of Bourbon county, althoughduring the last session of the Kentucky Legislature he did as much asany half a dozen other Democraticmembers to earn public confidence forthe partv to which he belongs."In the State Senate Mr. Thomasfirst came to the front by his protestsagainst the rules, with which it wasoriginally proposed to gag that bodyand which were in the pnd only slightly altered."Next Mr. Thomas figured as theleader of the fight for the county unitbill, to which his party was pledgedand which was defeated by a bi-partisancombination."At the end of the session Mr.Thomas killed the Louisville "ripper"bill and thereby rendered services tothis community that should not be forgotten. "The Evening Post is not informedas to whether Mr. Thomas has anyimmediate political ambitions. We doknow, however, that his service in theState Senate stamped him ?s a manthat can be trusted in any emergency.Mr. Thomas' name on a DemocraticState ticket might anger certain politicians in Louisville and Frankfort,who learned a yea ago that they couldnot control him, but it wuuld be worthmany votes among men who realizethat Kentucky needs just that kind ofmen in public life."The song, "Casey Jones," while onlyvery recently come into popularity,was composed several years ago, andin Western Kentucky and Tennesseehas been the negro's favorite for almost a decade."Casey" was a nickname applied !toJones on account of his home being inCacye, Ky., a few miles east of Hickman, in Fulton county.John Luther Jones was born atCacye, Fulton county, in 1863. andspent his boyhood days on his father'sfarm in that county. At the age ofnineteen he began firing on the Mobileand Ohio railroad, and lat r was similarly employed on the Ilhp 's Central.In 1890 he was promoted to 'Depositionof engineer, which he heiu until hisdeath.He was transferred from the Tennessee division of the Illinois Centralto the Water Valley, Miss., division,and ran a freight engine there until hebecame eligible to the Chicago & NewOrleans limited, a fast pasenger runIt was in this midnight run, March18, 1900, that he lost his life in a rearend collision with a freight train atVaughns, Miss. By his amiahle disposition and smiling face, as well ashis reckless nature when at the throttle, he won hundreds of frends and admirers. When his engine entered atown the children knew the whistlingof "Casey" Jones.The song bearing his name was written and first sung by an old roundhouse negro named Wallace Saunders.The public hat never heard even thesmallpst portion of the song, for, astime Dassed. verse after verse wasadded until, seme claimed, there wasat least fifty or sixty-five verses."Casey" Jones' home was onlyabout ten miles from Hickman. InI the quiet little village of Cayce, thereI now lives the mother of "Casey"Jones.The old darkey who started the merry jingle on its mirth-making journeyaround the world today wield3 a shoveland pipe engine, all unsioncious of hisresponsibility for the greatest musicalhit of the generation in which he lives.It can be further added that Col. S.L. Dodd, financier and planter ofHickman, was a schoolmate of "Casey"Jones and he is also remembered bymany other Hickman folk.I'GEO. W.

Opinions on the forticfiations of thePanama Canal seem as varied as thoseon tariff revision and on reciprocity.Many important arguments have beenadvanced both in fa or of and againstthe proposition.Mr. Edwin D. Mead, an associate ofWilliam Dean Howells, Nicholas Mur-; ray Butler, John Graham Brooks andothers, struck a quite different notewhen he declared, "The thing nowneedau is delay Why this hurryabout so important matter? ThePanama Canal will not be finished tomonrrow nor the next day ; and thequestion of its fortification can be determine! better by some future Congress than by the present one."The view of the case is not in linewith the utterance of Beaver CreekBrown on the desiribility of carrying apistol habitually. "It may be," heobserved judicially, "that a man moutcarry a gun all his hie and never revto use it; but when he does need it, hewants it right away, a.i' dang bad.1'As eoon as the canal is finished,friendship and treaty ties with foreignnations must, it ever, coma to a crucial test. Either neutrality or defences muit be relied on then, andchoice must be made now.

It isjust as unreasonable to expect the same results from thin, weak soil, in comparisonwith deep, rich soil, as it is to expect a child to do a man's work. This is a reasonable proposition, particularly to the scientific corn grower.More money is being spent and greater efforts along educational lines are beingmade to-day than ever before in the world's history to increase the yield of corn peracra. We contributed a very large effort to accomplish these results with our BlackHawk single kernel edge drop, and we now add to our combination the No. 15 Variable Drop, with which the drop can be changed to 2, 3 or 4 kernels in a hill withoutstopping the team; or can drill 7 1-2, 10 or 15 inches, 9, 12 or 17 1-2 inches, or 11, 14or 22 inches apart, without stopping the team.Hand Drop Attachment with each Planter, has Foot Drop also.

More than $350,000 was spentin this work in the fiscal year endingJune 30, 1910. To be exact, the UnitedStates Government furnished $207,000;the General Education Board of NewYork gave $102,000 and about $50,000came from public-spirited men and organizations in the states where thework is being done. Counties, cities, boards of trade and private individuals have come forward with contributions sufficient to pay in part orin full the expense ot maintaining anagent in order to get the services ofone of these farm missionaries in theirimmediate localities and to get himwithout waiting.This principle of local supports isencouraged not only because the demands upon the farm missionary department are greater than the fundsat its command, but also because ofthe fact that men and institutionswhich put money into this enterprisefeel the solid personal interest in thework whichcomes from putting a cashinvestment into it. They get behindit with a morral support and stimuluswhich helps to keep the wheels moving.

WYNKOOPCopyright by American Pres3 Association, 1911.Having been left a fortune verymuch larger than I had any use forI was a young girl then or I wouldhave known that no fortune is quitelarge enough I determined to endowsome institution. A member of theboard of directors of an insane asylum, a lady, persuaded me to give herpet project $100,000.I drove one afternoon to the asylumwith a check for the amount I wasto give. The lady I have mentionedwent with me and had arranged forher attorney to be there with the necessary legal papers.When we arrived we found a telegram from the attorney saying that hewould be delayed. Learning that thepatients were to have a dance thesame evening, we decided, to lemainand have a look at the dancers. Nopatients were received in the institution except those who were consideredhomeless. Indeed, most of them wereunbalanced on but one subject Wewere given tea in the apartments ofthe medical director, and his wifemade us at home till the ball opened,which was very early in the evening,for it must end at 10 o'clock.I and my gift were known, and nothing would do but that I should takepart in the festivities. I danced several times, when a young man of veryprepossessing appearance came up tome and asked if I would be his partner. There are occasions when a girlwill meet a man to whom she is especially drawn. 1 had not been in company with this young fellow long before I felt a pang that he should beinsane. lie charmed ,me at once.Naturally I wished to discover hisweak point. I tried him on severalsubjects, but saw nothing abnormaluntil I struck aviation. Then he beganto talk wild. LTe said that he hadsome views about flying machines hehoped to work out which would bringaeroplanes nearer to the constructionof birds. A bird's wings were not rigid.Why should those of an aeroplane berigid? Lie had in mind a plan bywhich the wings of the machine shouldflap like those of the bird."True," he said, "birds often soarwithout using their pinions, but sincethey flap them at all it indicates thatflapping Is necessary.""Why do you wish to go up in theair?" I asked. "I am quite content onthe earth.""I only know that I would love tosail up in the clouds, to pass over thetops of high mountains. I wouldlove"I shut him off. I was quite satisfiedwith having discovered his weakness.I had no mind to get him to raving.I excused myself and joined some oneelse. But later, shortly before theclose of the entertainment, he joinedme again and asked for a last dance.I declined. Ills personality hadthrown a spell over me which 1 thoughtif yielded to would grow upon me. Inother words, I felt that I had met myfate in one of unsound mind and itwould be dangerous to my comfort toyield to what might soon become aserious infatuation. LTe gave me ahalf reproachful glance a glance suggesting to me that he had been impressed by me as I had been impressedj by him and left me.When the evening's amusement wasended my friend the directress told methat wo would proceed to tbe superintendent's room, where the attorneywas waiting for us to transact ourbusiness, and then go home. I wentwith her, and, on opening the door ofthe office, there, sitting at a table looking over some papers, was the youngman who had gone daft on aviation.I stopped short, paralyzed with astonishment. Lie arose and gave me one ofthose pleasant smiles that had helpedto charm me."Why," I said, "I I didn't expect tofind you here"."It was his turn to look surprised."I supposed you knew who I was," hesaid."I did not. I thought" I stopped.He looked very much amused. "Isee," he said. "You mistook me forone of the patients. I'm not sure butsome of them might change placeswith me to my advantage." Then,turning to the work before him, heread me several legal documents, nowand then stopping to explain something, 1 knowing not half as much ofwhat he was talking as when he wasdiscoursing on aviation. When he hadfinished he gave me a lot of papersand took my check, which I had madepayable to the trustees.The lawyer or lunatic I was soconfused that I was not yet certainIn my mind which he was rode inthe same carriage with us to a railroad station, where we dropped him,he taking a passing train, while wedrove on to my home.I went to bed with my mind in .1good deal of n whirl, but above it allwas a feeling of thankfulness that theman I had met was not a lunatic, forIt was possible his mental conditionmight make a great deal of differenceto me.It was not long before he expressedthrough my friend the directress a desire to continue our acquaintance, andI sent him an invitation to call on me.At his first visit I drew him on toaviation, and I learned that be madeit hishobby, having an inventive taste,but had never been up in an aeroplanein his life.I married the supposed lunatic, and,strange to say, though I can give himall the funds be needs to prosecutehis aerial tastes, be prefers bis uninteresting law cases.MILD, GENTLE LAXATIVEFOR WOMEN GIVEN FREESo many of the ills of women aredue to habitual constipation, probablybecause of their false modesty on thesubject, that their attention cannot betoo strongly called to the importanceof keeping the bowels open.
