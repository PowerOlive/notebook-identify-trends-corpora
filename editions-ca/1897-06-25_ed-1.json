ELEPHANT NOT CLEVER
The Popular Belief Contradicted by n
English Writer
The elephant possesses very charm
ing characteristics and makes a very
pleasant companion For one thing he
is not easily mislaid and he is very
obedient to the slightest hint given by
his mahout
In speed he is scarcely a record break
er but he can get over the ground in
his shuffling way a the rate of 15
miles an hour when he likes
There is one thing that he is not he
is not a really cleverhnimal in spite
of all the tales in the story books to the
contrary otherwise he would not suffer
himself to be so easily captured in the
kheddahs the huge forest inclosures in
to which the hunters drive the herds of
elephants for the purpose of capture
All the actions which are apparently
spontaneous on the part of the working
elephant are really performed at the
bidding of the mahout The driver on
his neck directs every movement by
pressure of the knee and as thelnaus
knees are concealed under the elephants
ears it is very easy to imagine that the
elephant thinks for Limself
When the mahout elects for a change
to sifc on the saddle or pad he drives
with his feet and the dullest eye can
detect how a rub of the heel on the
right shoulder turns the elephant to the
left and vice versa
After his tractability his gentleness is
te elephants most marked characteris
tic The mahout takes cruel advantage
of his disposition sometimes thrashing
him on the toe nail with a billet of
wood or if free from risk of discovery
by his European master pricking his
trunk with a spear till blood flows
An elephant has rarely been known
to retaliate save when it must When
that curious madness comes on him no
one dares approach him in his pickets
If he be taken in must and the fact es
cape notice the consequences are likely
tofce awkward at least v
In a suburb of Eanguu an elephant
belonging to a firm of rice merchants
was one afternoon taken down to the
river for his usual bath after work He
hadthe mahout said been dull all
day and seemed out of sorts He was in
must He signified the fact by seizing
his mahout and tossing the astonished
man irto the water then he ran into
the go down close by andwith one
squeal dismissed some 200 coolies at
work there
The go down was a huge palisade
shed covering over an acre and was full
of loose paddy unhusked rice and
stacks of bags and grain For two nights
and two days that elephant enjoyed
himself among those stacks Spearmen
posted round the palisade wall kept
him in and one might have supposed 40
elephants bent on mischief had been
there instead of one mad one At last
he was made prisoner with the aid of
two big tuskers and chained np until
such time as heshould recover himself
London Sketch
LIFE IN THE POLAR SEAS
Plenty of Bears Birds and Varwhals
Millions of Fiddlers and Fleas
It is evident according to JSTansen
that the waters of the polar seas are far
from being deserted by living creatures
Wherever the sea is open or partially so
seals narwhais and birds abound and
on the heaps of ice near the edge of the
water the bears are numerous Under
the ice marine animals are not wanting
The explorers found in abundance little
crustaceans whose discovery was the
result of an accident
One day the cook sunk a piece of
meat in a hole which he had cut in the
ice with a view of thawing it out That
is a method often resorted to for the
purpose of sparing the fuel Forty eight
hours afterward while taking out the
meat the cook was astonished to find
an immense number of little animals
that dropped upon the surface of the ice
and commenced to jump about like
fleas Nansen who is a professor of
zoology had no trouble in recognizing
those little crustaceans which may be
seen jumping in the sand and which
are called sand fleas He was delighted
at the discovery because the creatures
are good to eat although they contain
but little nourishment
A few months later on when in 78
or 80 degrees north latitude in Octo
ber that is to say at the beginning of
the long winter night he fished up in a
little net with close meshes a quantity
of little crustaceans This proves that
life is by no means suspended under the
ice on the contrary it is very active
In the mud of the bottom where Jhe
water is shallow there are numerous
starfish mollusks worms sponges and
several species of Crustacea Journa
des Debats
The Roman Fisherman
A traveler in Rome tells of a citizen
who was evidently too lazy to sit on
the bank of the Tiber and fish after the
manner of the ordinary fisherman but
instead arranged his apparatus in the
form of automatic nets which are made
to revolve by the aid of weights and
the current of the stream so that it is
not necessary for him to visit the spot
oftener than once a day With the aid
of a pneumatic tube to shoot the fish
from the bank to his house it would
seem to be unnecessary for him to do
even this Nothing would beMacking
then r to complete his happiness but an
