One of the most notable social events
as well as the most enjoyable was the
celebration of the fiftieth anniversary
of the marriage of Mr.an- Mrs. Thomas
McClintock at their beautiful home
here Saturday afternoon from 2:30 to
4 :30.
The beautiful home was in the hands
of the decorators for three days prior
to the event The entertainment in all
of its parts had been nicely arrangsd
and as nicely carried out. The only
thing that was feared might mar the
occasion was the unsettled condition of
the weather at this season tf the ye2r.
This doubt however was dispelled Sat
urday morning when the &un in all her
beauty emerged from a clear sky.
More than four hundred invitations
had been issued to which nearly three
nundred responded. A .-u rebel' were
sent to frkrids ynd relatives in distant
states who could not respond in per
son. The only regret of the occasion
was that Miss Anna James McClin
tock, the second daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. McClintcck. who is one of the in
structors at Lalce forest University,
Lake Forest, Ilk, on account of her
duties, was unable to be present.
Aside from this the occaison was a
decided success.
The guests entered f-om the side en
trarce, the home was darkened and
softly illuminated with yellow wax
tapers, yellow and white being the col
or scheme, which was nicely carried
out. The decorations consisted of yel
low and white chrysanthemums, roses,
ferns, white tarlton, white and yel
low crepe paper. As the guests were
received they were sent upstairs where
their wraps were taken. On returning
to the first tioor they were ushered in
to the presence of the receiving line
by the youngest daughter, Miss Ruth
Shannon McClintock, which was made
up of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas McClin
tock. Mrs. McClintock was handsome
ly gowned in silver gray silk with real
lace.
The three daughters, Mrs. Turner
Perry, Owingsville, in blue silk, Mrs.
C. R. Jnne3 in lavender silk and Miss
Ruth McClintock, in ydlow silk In
the reception room the Saxon & Troat
orchestra of Lexington, rendered
sweet music during the entire time
which gave the whole scene a fairy
like appearance. The beautiful hand
painted register was in charge of Mes
danies C. R. Jones and C. W. Howard.
After registering the guests wended
their way to the dining room. At the
door they received their souvenirs
which were tiny slippers for the
gentlemen and gold 'bells for -the
ladies.
The floor of thn dining room was
entirely covered with rfhite. The
bride's table which occupied the
center of the room, was decorated in
white, with yellow roses, candles and
tiny slippers and seemed to be resting
upon a bower of ferns. The refresh
ments consisted of brick cream and
sake upon which was printed 1862-1912.
There was a continuous flow of guests
from the time the entertainment open
ed until it rlo3ed. The occasion was
one that will live in the memory of all

McClintcck and family, Mr. and Mrs.
G. S. Varden & Son have been sup
plied -with the new remedy for
stomach trouble called DIGBSTIT.
This new medicine has been found to
be a relief for the distressing symp
toms of indigestion and dyspepsia.
It will digest food in remarkably
short time' after coming in contact
with it thereby relieving . the full,
uncomfortable feeling after a hearry
meal. Surely it will be received with
gratitude by the american public, as
ninety per cent of the people in this
country have indigestion. The mak
ers of this remarkable remedy pro
pose to demonstrate its merit beyond
a question of doubt, and have author
ized G. S. Vaiden & Son to sell it
with the distinct understanding that
should tbe customer be displeased
with results, they will refund the
cost. Or if you are not willing to
invest a half dollar on your druggist's
agreement to refund it, you may send
a postal to the Digestit Co., Jackson,
Miss., and receive an order to yeur
drug store for a full size 50c package
without cost. If you are a sufferer
from indigestion you cannot afford to
miss this opportunity to get relief, or
if you are one of the many who enjoy
a hearty meal, but dare not indulge
too freely earing the after effects
that full uncomfortable feeling or sour
stomach you surely will try a pack
age of this wonderful relief. Two or
three tablets immediately after eat
ing gives immediate relief. DIGES
TIT is a harmless remedy, absolute
ly free from any dangerous or habit
forming drugs -it digests food and
tones up the digestive organs to a
healthful condition.

, gaard and his concert company.
"At the conclusion of Pizzicatc
GrazloEO, a piece w.itten by himself,
which was the last of his final group,

to the aisles and returned as one per
son and the violinist was obliged to
give one last number.
"Skovgaard tias made a happy selec
