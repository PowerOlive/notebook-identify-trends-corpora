. Girl Pupil is Hyint4ised.r
Miss Ida Ishamfa teacher "in a Cin
cinnati school, ordered her- class to
play a "sleeping" game and all jier
pupils closed their eyes as if to sleep.
A mo nent later she called the class to
awaken. All the children promptly
obeyed except "Peggy" Gordon. The
child was carried to an ante-room,
where unsuccessful efforts for two
hours were made to awaken her. Final
ly the mother appeared and by crying
"Awake" several times aroused her.
Physicians pronounce it an unusual
case of hypnotism.
Know Little of Corn's Value.
The use of Indian corn as a food
product Is very limited In thf United
Kingdom, and there are reasons for It
other than the absence of taste. Ap
parently the British public Is not
properly enlightened as to the various
ways of preparing tinned corn, corn
meal and hominy. It would seem that
little is known of the vegetable itself,
as recipes In some English cookbooks
make very f meager reference to its
preparation.

It took Skovgaard, the famous
Danish violinist, thirty year to make
this hand. To the oidinary eye it is
not very different from other well de
veloped hands. Yet it has the power
almost automatically to express
through the violin the exquisite besuty
and marvellous tone-pictures which
the player feels and sees as he inter
prets the work of the masters.

the power of untiring work created
this marvellous tcol, now at last, with
out his even thinking of it, obedient
in every slightest movement, strong,
tender, .delicate, passionate, incredioly
swift, to the wonderful dreams cf tht

As an investment it represents a
man's life-work. But it represents,
too, the inborn gift which no money
can buy. Without that no work could
mould u hand illte this hand of a mas

J. Phillip Terry further Honored
The Royal Geographical Society of
London, an institution founded in 1E30
by the great explorer cf that date,
has recently elected Mr. T. Phililp
Terry a Fellow. This is indeed a high
honor. The late Henry M. Stanley
was a member, and among the very
few Americans who can now claim
membersnip is Commander Robert E.
Peary, cf Aictic exploration fame.
Mri leiry, uro is n Lrother of Miss-j
es Beatrice and Maragiet Terry of this,
city lelt his home in fans something
over twentj-five years eko, wntn
mere lad, for the West. He secured a
position in Kansas City with the Wells,
Fargo Express Company, and afUr
serving aome time v. ith them as an
employe in the oliice and then as ex
press messenger, he removed to Mexi
co City, Mexico, where he secured em
ployment with an American firm.
During his leisure hours he applied
himself diligently to the study of the
Spanish language, which he-mastered
so completely that within a few years
he issued an "interpreter" to be used
by visitors to that country, and which
met with such success that it is now
running through the thirteenth edition.
His success in a business way in Mexi-'
co attracted the attention of a great j
syiiuiuatu in rnuw xum, wnu seeureu I
rus services as a commercial mission
ary. His field was the world. He was
not expected to sell any goods, but to
visit foreign countries and work up a
feeling of good .fellowship among the
Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, Russians,
French and all other foreign merchants
for American dealers. He would be
followed in a short time by the sales
man, who would secure large ordprs
for their houses. In this capacity he
made seven complete trips around the
globe, being accompaniedby hi3 wife,
One of his children was born in Yoko
hama, Japan.
Six years ago he resigned his po
sition and gave his attention to a busi
ness which hf had started while living
in Mexico and which had grown so
rapidly that it needed hi3 personal ser
vices. Meanwhile he wrote and gave
to the travelers of the wcrld "Terry's
Mexico," said to be the most complue
guide Look ever published. It is superi
or to the famous Baedeker of Europe,
because it is more complete, and is
written in the charming literary style
that makes it valuable .as a library
book even to those who cannot visit
the ecenes it depicits. This book is
meeting with a phenomenal sale.
It attracted the attention of Presi
dent Porfirio Diaz, who sent for Mr.
Terry and personally thanked him for
his great work. Many of the books
were bought by the Mexican govern
ment to send to its consuls, ambassa
dors, etc , and all of the railroads that
now gridiron the republic on uur, South
supplied their non-resident agents
with them that they might be placed
in the hands of those visiting that
country. Although this book has not
been ouc a great while, it is now in its
second edition and the demand for it
has not diminished in the least.
When on a recent visit to his sisters
in Paris he arranged for the erection
of two dwelling houses in Paris on the
lot at Twelfth and Main streets, where
he spent his boyhood, thinking that he
would spend at least a part of the sum
mer in Paris to see after their con
struction. But on arriving in Boston,
the desire to again visit the East came
over him so on next Thursday he and
his wife will leave for San B'rancisco,
where they will take ship for Japan,
China, Korea and other countries.
