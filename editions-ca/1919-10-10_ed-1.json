Relatives in Paris and the coun
ty have received announcement of
the recent death in Atlanta, Ga., of
Mrs. Robert Milam. Mrs. Milam was
a sister of the late Dr. W. M. Miller,
of Millersburg, and is survived by
her husband, two daughters, Mrs.

SPEARS.
The funeral of Mrs. E. F. Spears,
who died at her home, on High
street, in this city, Monday evening,
after a long illness, was held at the
residence Wednesday afternoon, at
3:30, with services conducted by
Rev. Fraftk W. Eberhardt, of George
town, former pastor of the Paris Bap
tist church. The interment took
place on the family lot in the, Paris
Cemetery. The pall-bearers ' were
John "Woodford, Catesby Woodford,
Jr., E. F. Spears, Charles Spears and
Brutus J. Clay.
In the death of this Christian wo
man the community loses one of its
best citizens, one w&o was always
ready to aid in a substantial way any
worthy cause; the Presbyterian
church loses one of its most devoted
and faithful members, and her fam
ily a wise counsellor and friend.
She had endeared herself to all who
knew her by her gentleness, her
sympathy, her dignity, and her will
ingness to help those in distress. She
was one to whom neither station nor
circumstance mattered in administer
ing of her bounty in cases of need,
) and her name is enshrined in the
? list of those whose right hand never
', let the left know what it was doing.
