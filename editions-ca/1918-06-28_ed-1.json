CITIZENS OF PARIS READ!
CONCERNS YOU!
THIS
Public notice has frequently been
given that you should boil all water
used for domestic or drinking pur
poses, whether it be from hydrant,
well, cistern or spring. There may
be water-borne disease at any time
of the year, more especially, how
ever during the late summer and
autumn months.
This Board has no information to
suspect such disease or diseases pres
ently, yet it realizes such possibili
ty, and the object of this notice is ,to
protect the public against any dan
ger from this source.
Don't be unfair and say you have
never seen nor heard' of this notice.
The quickest means to reach all the
people is through a city's local pa
pers, hence this communication.
Again, WATER-BORNE DISEASES
ARE ABSOLUTELY PREVENTED
BY BOTXING WATER. Will you
heed this admonition or will you wil
fully or negligently pursue the even
tenor of your way and regard this
notice as worthless? It is up to you.
Antiques in furniture may be all
right. In milldams they are danger
ous, and this Board so condemns.
Changes in treatment of the water
supply have been recently suggested
and are now in operation.

FISHER DETERMAN.
A surprise wedding, in which the
daughter of a projninent Paris man,
was one of the principals, took place
in Lexington, Wednesday afternoon,
when Miss Belle Fisher, daughter of
Mr. William P. Fisher, of this city,
became the bride of Mr. Alfred Deter
man, of Covington. It was not until
several hours after the wedding had
taken place that the family of the
bride learned of the event.
Miss Fisher went to Lexington,
Tuesday, presumably for a visit to
Mrs. Leslie Clark. She was met there
Wednesday by the groom, who is a
brother of Mr. George Determan, the
brick contractor, of this city. They
proceeded to the office of Magistrate
W. S. Hunt, after securing license.
To the witnesses who had been sum
moned, and to the magistrate, there
was some doubt as to their being of
legal age, judging from their youth
ful appearance. On being questioned
they both declared they were more
than twenty-one years of age. They
were accordingly married at 4:30
o'clock,, and left immdeiately for the
home of the groom, in Covington.
The bride is a handsome young wo
man, who has a host of friends in
Paris, where she has been a social
favorite. Mr. Determan is a young
business man of Covington, who has
been a frequent visitor at the home
of his brother, in this city.

TWO INCIDENTS SHOWING THE
FRENCH ENTHUSIASM OVER
AMERICA.
The wonderful enthusiasm of the
French people, a nation of fighters
themselves, over the entrance of
America in the war, and over the
presence of the American troops, is
shown in the following news items,
taken from a recent issue of a Paris
(France) daily paper:
"Paris has never been so enthu
siastic about American soldiers as it
showed itself to be wlien lorries filled
with the soldiers from overseas cross
ed the city on their way to the front.
The Americans were pelted with
flowers and cheered as the automo
biles passed down the main boule
vard. "President Poincare has received
from an American farmer a letter
containing $50 and the explanation
that the money, one-tenth of his
worldly possessions, is to pay part of
the debt of the United States ;to Gen.
LaFayette. The incident, has evoked
great enthusiasm in the French
press." , i

REBUILDING THE WAR CRIPPLE.
New and ingenious appliances have
been contrived, some of the best of
J these by the war cripples themselves,
to enable the one-armed man to
handle tools. At the vocational
school at Montpellier, France, a grip
has been designed which holds a tool
in any desired position. A similar
modification of this permits a work
man to hold a tool in the three posi-
1 tions in which the screw-driver, ham
mer and file respectively are held. In
order that a one-armed turner may
drill a hole, there is a socket fitted
with springs by means of. which the
handle of the tool may be firmly
grasped. By the invention of a special
gauntlet for the use of men ' with
muscilo-spinal paralysis, one carpen
ter was 'enabled to go back to his
trade and two men who were study
ing designing could use their instru
ments as handily as uninjured men.
Often, however, an arm-stump can
be so strengthened that the work
man lays his complicated artificial
arm aside, getting along better with
what natural strength and skill re
mains to him Men who have lost
their right arm are , taught to use
their left. In certain German schools

HOW ENGLISH GROWS.
If English speaking people of to
day do not talk more than their an
cestors it is not for lack of a vastly
increased number of words in which
to convert their thoughts. The first
English dictionary, published three
centuries ago, contained 5,050 words;
the most recent more than 450,000.
Samuel Johnson's famous complica
tion, which appeared in 1755, listed
50,000 and was considered a marvel
of erudition, but it was far exceeded
by Noah Webster's American diction
ary, first published in 1828, which
included 160,000 words.
It is estimated that the English
language, which is spoken by more
people than any other European
tongue, is now growing at the rate of
5,000 words a year, for, besides slang
and techincal terms, it borrows from
all tongues. The war' alone will un
doubtedly add many thousands. The
first of the worlds' dictionaries was,
of course, a Chinese work, and was
perfected about 1100 B. C. by Pa-out-she.
