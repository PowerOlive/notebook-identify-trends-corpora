KEEP STOCK OFF RAILROAD
RIGHT-OF-WAY.
Mr. J. A. Morrison, of Paris, Su
perintendent of this Division of the
Louisville & Nashville railroad, has
issued the following ciruclar letter,
in which he points out how thousands
of dollars worth of valuable live
stock can be saved each year:
To Owners of Live Stock, Town
Officers, Newspaper Editors and Em
ployes of This Company:
Do you know that thousands of
horses, mules, cattle, hogs and sheep
are killed annually by railway trains
in this country, and that this eco
nomic waste approximating many
millions of dollars can be reduced?
The thousands of horses and mules
that are killed every year would fill
the artillery requirements of many
regiments, and the thousands of cat
tle, hogs and sheep that are killed
every year would provide meat for
thousands of soldiers.
Anyone who aids in preventing the
loss of even one animal serves his
country patriotically and effectu
ally. r
.This economic waste can be reduc
ed by owners of stock keeping their
animals in fenced enclosures and not
permitting their stock to roam at
large on railroad right-of-way; town
officers passing and enforcing ordi
nances prohibiting the practice of
permitting stock to roam at large;
roadmasters and. section men making
a personal appeal to the owners of
stock to keep their a.iimals in fenced
enclosures; engineers taking every
precaution within their power to
avoid striking stock and never fail
ing to report stock seen .on right-of-way;
section men driving stock off
right-of-way, keeping farm gates
closed, and fences and cattle guards
in good repair; giving preference to
locations where liabilities of stock
getting on right-of-way is greatest;
newspaper editors presenting this im
portant matter to the public through
the press; everyone making a persist
ent, personal effort to bring about
desired results.
The co-operation of all concerned
will be thoroughly appreciated.
