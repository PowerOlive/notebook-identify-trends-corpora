To give you some idea of how'Pigin English' is used, and what itmeans, I will relate the following:"I called on a Chinese firm notlong ago, and, after drinking a fewcups of tea, I asked the manager ifhis business had' been good and ifhe was making money on his investment, and he replied: 'Businessno can walkee more far.' Afterdrinking another cup of tea I realized that he was trying to tell methat business was dull, that he hadlost money, and had decided to closehis shop. In other words, 'His business could walk (go) no further.'"I am getting along fine overhere, but miss the Paris folks. THENEWS comes regularly and is asgood as a letter from home.

The McAplin companysought to attach the salary of MissRowe to enforce the payment of abill incurred by the teacher whenshe purchased a dress from the storein Cincinnati.The suit was first brought in theFayette county court when CountyJudge E. H. Doak recently in passing on the case held that a schoolteacher's salary could not be attached. Circuit Judge Stoll in hisruling sustained the opinion givenby Judge Doak though he cited thelaw more fully.

Others will say that theAmerican people are drinking lessliquor. ,However such causes may factor,the health campaign that has beenpromoted all over the countryshould be bringing results. Thepeople are learning that one half ofthe deaths occur far earlier than isnecessary. Children are brought upin a more sanitary wa'y, and contagious diseases are being reduced.What is' needed now is to pushthis campaign home to every familyin the community. A single unsanitary household is a disease peril, forits children to go out and carry theirdeaded infections to the most careful home. The people have a personal interest in seeing that healtheducation is carried into the mostignorant family.THE DBTJNKI stood on the bridge at midnightAs drunk as a son of a gun,Two moons arose in the heavensWhen there should have been onlyone.I wondered which one belongedthere, 'And which was the moon divineThe moon of 'a happy fancy,The child of the corn and wine?I looked for the lights of the village,But never a light was litI bit off a chew of tobaccoAnd stepped to the rail and spit.I spit into the turbid waterAnd into a bullfrog's eye,And I thought of the long deadmillionsWhen I heard the bullfrog cry.Then I wept for the countlessthousandsOf the long dead sons of men,Who would never be back in Kentucky, And could never get drunk again.Berea, Ky.Alson Baker.TRY PICKING DANDELIONS(Chicago Tribune)We offer herewith amild suggestion to persons who, while enjoying a country outing, are unable todifferentiate between the beauties ofa protected field of wild flowers anddesolation of a field which has beenstripped and left to weeds and grassby the wayside vandals. If theymust pick something which does notbelong to them, let them try pickingdandelions.The flower of that ubiquitousweed, we are told, though we haven'ttried it, forms the base of a potent,pleasing and inspiring beverage.The leaves, we know by experience,can form one of the most wholesomeand apprizing vegetable dishesknown To modern cookery. It is thespinach with a kick.And no one will begrudge theirpassing. Vandals may exercise theirmost destructive inclinations againstthe dandelion. Tear them up, rootand branch. Bedeck the automobileswith them. Throw them into aboiling caldron. Serve them withoil or vinegar. Eat them ailve.Do your worst to the dandelion,oil or vinegar. Eat them alive.oTHE WEIGHT OF FLATTERYParis, Kentucky(Harper's Magazine)A court in Mississippi was oncepresided over by a rural Justice ofthe Peace.
