Season's Record Price for
Weanling.
The season's record price for a
weanling saddle colt was reached when
J. F. Barbee, of Millersburg, sold to
an eastern man the bay colt, Jubilee
King, son of Bourbon King, dam Eric
son Queen, sister to Eric Chief, by
Warrisnn Chief, for S500. The nnlt
was a winner at the Georgetown fair
and is bred to become a champion as
his sire was an unusually high class
colt and his dam a handsome big mare
and sister to the noted stallion Eric
Chief. Mr. Barbee is also owner of
the filly Rosa King for which an offer
of $800 was refused as a suckling.
Bourbon county is far in the lead of
all athers when it comes to producing
high class saddle colts and this fact
was given prominence when the wing
ner of the National Saddle Horse
Futurity and three others inside the
money were bred in this county. Mil
dred King the winner is said to be do
ing nicely and wintering well. An
offer of $500 was recently refused for
her. She also won something like $750
this year in the Futurity and at the
other fairs where she was shown
which is easily the record amount for
a scukling to win in a single season.
Another .Bourbon county colt that
sold well was the weanling chestnut
colt Wah Wah Chief by Red McDonald
Bath Queen by Borubon Chief, that
W. F. Saunders, of Millersburg, sold
to'an Iowa man for $300. The colt
won tenth raoneyin the Futurity.
