Ashland Teachers to Meet.
The Ashland District Teachers' As
sociation, composed of twelve counties
of Kentucky, will hold their annual
meeting ini Georgetown on October 25
and 26 Professor Jesse Crawford
Waller, of Georgetown, is president
of the organization, Mrs. Narfnie G.
Falconer, vice president and Miss Jen
nie Quinn, of Georgetown, secretary
and treasurer.
The association is composed of the
counties of Fayette. Clark, Powell,
Estill,- Scott, Bourbon, Woodford.
Franklin, Owen, Henry, Oldham and
Lee. There will be addresses by rep
resentative speakers of this State and
several adjoining ones on educational
subjects. The meetings will be held
in the chapel of the Georgetown Col
lege. Burley Probe is Not Unikely.
At the adjourned meeting of the to
bacco glowers of 'Franklin county Sat
urday afternoon the committee report
ed in favor of not filing a suit against
the Burley Society for an accounting
unless enough growers would join in
the suit to make the cost to each so
small that it would not amount to much
to each one.
Only a small number attended the
meeting, but some rather fiery
speeches were made in favor of forc
ing the Burley Society to make an ac
counting. Scott Brown, the repre
sentative of the society in that county
said;the society was perfectly willing
to have its books and accounts exam
ined. Itwas the understanding when the
meeting adjourned that if a sufficient
number of growers from Franklin -and
other Burley counties would agree to
sharp the expenses of a suit, one would
be filed against the Burley , Society,
but as no provision was made to have
any one aee the growers for that dui
pose no further steps will be. taken.

A violent electrical stoim. accompa
nied by high winds and hail awept over
a portion of the county doing consider
able damage. In some sections of the
county heavy hail fell doing much dam
age to growing crops, particularly
uncut tobacco, which in several in
stance was stripped of leaves.
The area covered by the hail how
ever was very small, being not more
than half a mile wide and traveling in
a Southern direction. The damage
was comparatively slight to what it
might have been had it not been that
most of the tobacco in the path of 'the
hail had been housed. Large hail
stones are reported to have fallen in
some sections of the county.
During the storm lightning struck a
hay stack on the iarm of Mr. B. B.
Marsh, ear this city, completely de
stroying it. A bolt struck a chimney
on the residenceof Mr. T. J. Flora
on Fifteenth street completely demol
ishing it, and was conducted into the
residence, severely shocking Mrs.
Flora who was in the kilchen. No
serious damagewas done to the resi
dence. Insure your Tobacco with

Kind Words.
Kind words are the music of the
world. They have a power which
seems to be beyond natural causes,
as If they were some angel's song
which had lost its way and come to
earth. It seems as if they could al
most soften the hard and angry hearts
of men. No one was ever corrected
by a Sarcasm; crushed perhaps if the
sarcasm was clever . enough, but
helped never. F. W. Faber.
Nature Is Perfection.
One cannot improve on nature. The
universal is not to he corrected by
the partial.
Consolidation of Schools.
Mason county enjoys the distinction
of being the first county in the State
to establish consolidated schools, which
was accomplished through the efforts,
of Miss Jessie O. Yancey, 'Superintend
ent of County Schools, and the advan
tages for higher education thus placed
before the pupils of rural sen ols have
met with favor in various sections of
the county. The opportunity is given
them for "thorough feins-truction in the
higherjbranches, and the advancement
that has been made (Talong this line is
an assurance that the consolidation of
schools is a precursor of great achieve
ments for the future.
UNCLE SAM'S MARKSMEN:
TheiV Records Provo Them to Be the
Sest In the World.
If thera is one big, distinguishing
trait of the United States regular it is
individuality. In every one of the
great foreign military nations, partic
ularly Germany and Japan, battalion
and company officers and enlisted men
are carefully trained not to think for
themselves. They are used as mere
chess pieces under the guidance, of a
master mind. In this country, where
our melting pot has yielded us an ex
traordinarily self reliant, cool think
ing, intensely initiative product, it is
only natural that our soldiers should
be trained as are our civilians.
The United States army spends an
nually on rifle target practice five
times the sum spent by any other ar
my of an equal number of men. This
applies, too, to our field and coast ar
tillery. As a result, no better marks
men can be found than the American
soldier and his cousin, the national
guardsman, who is trained along the
same lines. -.Every world's fire control
and accuracy record with rifle and big
gun is today held by the American sol
dier. The United States army is small,- in
accordance with the will of the people
not to support a large standing mili
tary establishment, but what we have
is almost 100 per cent efficient the
splendid nucleus of the big army of
regulars, militia and volunteers which
we should place in the field if occasion
required. It is only in equipment
quartermaster, commissary, medical
and particularly ordnance stores that
our army is lacking. Leslie's.
NOTHING IS SOLID.
Science Says Matter Is Just a Mass of
Whirling Electrons.
Science is knocking the materialists
end for end, as the boys say. It is ab
solutely proVen that there is no such
thing as solid, substantive matter. It
is only motion. This stone, this table,
this hammer is only motion. Some
newfangled idiotic idea, eh? "Well, it is
known that matter is composed of at
oms. For a long time the atom was
thought to be the final analysis of
matter.
But such is not the case. A few
years ago radium was discovered, and
that has broken the atom into small
bits 2,000 times smaller than the hydro
gen atom, the smallest of all. These
particles of the atom ,are called elec
trons, and now it has been found that
these electrons are mere points of elec
trical energy. "These electrons," says
a magazine article, "are entirely free
from anything that can be properly
called matter."
Trillions and trillions of these elec
trons make up this piece' of iron, and
they are always in motion, flitting
about at the rate of 50,000 miles a sec
ond. Now you know there is a lie
outl How can a man calculate the
sp"eed of an invisible motion inside of
an invisible atom? Oh, dear reader,
you have no- idea how "big and deep
this world is, or how powerful human
genius is, or how small a space you
occupy in the world. Ohio-State Jour
