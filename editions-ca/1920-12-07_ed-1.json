WILL WE HAVE A NEW PASSEN
GER STATION?
Echo answers: "Will we?" Paris
may hae a new L. & N. passenger
station, in the future, or at least a
remodeled one, if the efforts of Mayor
E. B. January and others who have
'"li Ull 'M'H'li'fr'I'M'i'M'flfrHi been pressing the matter lately
come to a nead. Mayor January was
in Frankfort last week, where he
eppeared before the Statj Railroad
Commission in regard to the petition
of the citizen? of Paris for a new
passenger station. He urged the
Commission to take some definite ac
tion in the matter.
i R. L. Northcutt, attorney for the
Louisville & Nashville, was present,
and said he would place the matter
before the railroad company in as
favorable u light as possible, and
the L. & N. people would at least
put the old Station in better shape,
a consummation deoutly wished
for. For a globing town like Paris
and a railroad center, also, the pres
ent station is utterly inadequate and
not up to thy needs of the cemmu
niiy. o

A SQUARE DEAL
Do you know Mr. Citizen, that
2,01 6 loaves of foreign made bread were used
last week in Paris, while only 2350 loaves of Paris
bread are used here each week?
Just think of it! Are you being fair to your
home bakers? And do you know, Mr. Citizen, that
Your home bakeries give employment to home
people?
Your home bakeries pay an annual license fee
to operate here?
Your home bakeries pay tazes to the city gov
ernment? ' Your home bakeries keep their money t home
banks?
And do you know that if it was not for the bus-
iness these bakeries do outside of Paris they could
not stay in business here?
ARE YOU FAIR TO YOUR OWN TOWN?
If better bread could be made the Paris bakeries would make
it. When you order bread, DEMAND PARIS BREAD. If your
grocer don't handle it, demand that he does handle it.
