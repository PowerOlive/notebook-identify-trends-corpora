Facts About The
City School
The suggestion has been made that by
cutting out the non-resident pupils we might
do with fewer rooms and fewer teachers.
If you will read carefully the following
facts as to the number and distribution of
the non-resident pupils you will see -that we
could not do without a single room or teach
er, even though we should cut out every one
of the non-resident pupils. ,
The High School has seven pupils per
room of non-residents.
The Eighth Grade has none.
The Seventh Grade has four. '
The Sixth Grade has eight.
The Fifth Grade has seven.
The Fourth Grade has six.
The Third Grade has six.
The Second Grade has twelve.
The First Grade has six.
Now, if we were to refuse to admit any
non-residents the largest number removed
from anyone room would be twelve, which
you can readily see would not save us a sin
gle room or teacher. But don't overlook
the fact that the increase derived from non
residents is over $2,000 enough to hire
hree teachers.
