Mr. J: W. Boulden, of Maysville.
arrived Saturday as the guest of his
niece, Mrs. A. S. Best.
Mrs. R. L. Buffingtoh, of Wheel
ing, TV. Va., is the guest of her sis
ter, Mrs. W. M. Miller.
Mr. Venable, of Sherman, Texas,
and Miss Venable, of Lexington, are
guests of Rev. and Mrs. A. S. Vena
ble. Mrs. J. H. Miller returned to her
home at Barksdale, Ark., Monday, af
ter a three-weeks' visit to her par
ents, Dr. and Mrs. W. G. Dailey.
The fourth annual Chautauqua
was continued. Monday afternoon
-with Judge Lee S. Estelle, of
Omaha, Neb., as lecturer, and Miss
Elma B. Smith as reader in child
dialect. Mi Smith read in the af
ternoon and evening. She is gifted
in her line and her simple child di
alect arrested the attention of all
who neard her. Her imitations of a
two-days'-old baby were perfect.
Judge Estelle in his address gave
many of his experiences as Judge of
the Juvenile Court, and pointed out
to friends and patrons wherein lay
the eecret of so many young people
going wrong.
-The meeting was continued at 8
p. m. Monday, and after miscella
neous ding's by Miss Smith, Dr.
Jj. G. Gilbert, of Ohio, was intro
duced. He is indeed a live wire in
every respect. He caught his audi
ence" the moment he stepped on the
plaiform and held them until he had
concluded his last sentence. His
'subject was "The Crisis and the
Call," and he handled it well. He
paid his respects in no uncomprom
ising terms to any and all American
citizens wlib were not loyal to the
government in these hours of crisis.
His address was a masterpiece. On
Tuesday afternoon the Hinshaw
Opera Company gave a forty-five
minutes prelude in attractive songs,
and was followed by Dr. D. D.
Vaughn, of Chicago, in another
equally brilliant address on "Amer-
ican Ideals," giving six cardinal
points, dwelling at considerable
length upon each point. He was
brilliant "through his entire address,
and, like Dr. Herbert, was the re1
ception of numerous applause.
The Chautauqua was continued
Tuesday at 8 p. m.f at which time
the Hinshaw Opera Co. put on the
popular opera "Mikado, which was
especially well rendered. They
were the reception Df many en
chores. Another large audience assem
bled under the big tent at 2 p. m.
Wednesday, when the Franko-Bal-kan
Band gave an interesting pre
lude on stringed instruments of
their native country, playing largely
their native music, which is indeed
full of melody, closing their preluds
with a melody of American airs. The
lecture of the afternoon was deliv
ered by Capt. Vickers, an English
man, who served in the trenches
"during the present European war.
He gave a description of life in the
trenches, and warned us that we
must be careful as to the character
of men we send to France, that we
were contending against well-trained
soldiers, and without discipline or
military training could not do the
-work. His lecture aroused a spirit
of partiotism. At the close of the af
ternoon session of the Chautauqua
the C. W. T. U. and Red Cross or
ganizations gave a parade, which was
in keeping with the time and the oc
cation. This parade was gotten up
on short notice and reflects great
credit on its managers. Everything
in it was certainly appropriate, and
the great spirit of patriotism was
again aroused all along the line of
march. A district conference was in
session at the colored Methodist
church, and as the parade passed the
church the members of the confer
ence lined up on the sidewalk anI
.sjeang "America."

EVANGELISTIC MEETING
The tent meeting which has been
in progress on Cypress street under
the auspices of Evengelists Hobbs and
Herrington, continue to attract
large audiences, despite counter at
tractions. The meeting was to hav?
closed last Sunday night, but on ac
count of the renewed interest it was
decided to continue it through next
Sunday.
Rev. J. J. Dickey, pastor of the
Hutchison Chapel at Hutchison, was
in attendance on the meeting recent
ly and assisted in the services. Evan
gelist Hobbs held his first revival ser
vices for Rev. Dickey while a student
at Asbury College. The evangelists
have been very successful in their ef
forts. Their expenses have been met
by free-will offerings taken each
night, wrhich have always been very
generous.

SAFE AND SANE FOURTH HERE.
It was a perfectly safe and sane
Fourth of July in Paris, all right.
Wednesday. It was as dull as the
proverbial meat-axe that figures in
the sayings of the long ago. Most of
the stores, the postoffice and banks
were closed and the 'employes found
pleasures during the day in various
ways. Some took their vacation on
Stoner Creek, with fishing kits, while
a large number went to the big bath
ing beach at Boonesboro. Many went
to the Bluegrass Park at Lexington,
and others went to Cincinnati.
Except for the occasional explosion
of a bunch of firecrackers and the
rattle and roll of some larger kind,
the day was a very quiet one, and
passed off without incident of any
kind. There was nothing to indicate
the day but the calendar, and that
wasn't working very hard on the job.
Flags and bunting were generously
displayed in many places, and what
little enthusiasm might have been
looking for an outlet, soon settled
down to the quiet zone.

McNAMARA.
Mrs. Margaret McNamara, for
merly of Mt. Sterling, died at her
home in Covington, Sunday, from an
acute attack of kidney trouble. She
was a daughter of the late Mr. John
Corbett, well-known in Paris, and
was one of the most popular women
in her home town. She is survived
by one daughter, Mrs. Clarence Weth
erall, formerly of Paris, now residing
in Detroit, Mich., and one son, Mr.
Daniel McNamara, of Denver, Colo.
The funeral was held at St. Mary's
Cathedral, in Covington, at nine
o'clock, Tuesday morning, followed
by burial in the Catholic Cemetery in
Covington.
AYERS.
' Col. Mott Ayres, former resident
of Kentucky, where he was for many
years prominently identified with
political events, died at his home in
Laurel, Miss., where he had been re
siding for several years past.
During his residence in Kentucky,
Col. Ayers was editor of the Daily
Leader at Fulton, and was recognized
as a brainy man. He was editor of a
daily paper at Laurel, Miss., at the
time of his death, and had recently
been appointed a Colonel on the Gov
ernor's staff.
Col. Ayers married Miss Mary Mil
ler Coleman, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Geo. Coleman,-of Mt. Sterling.
Besides his wife he is survived by
two daughters, one by a former mar
riage. The body was sent to Fulton where
the funeral took place Wednesday.
MORAL DON'T ORDER LKIUORS
BY EXPRESS.
Under a recent ruling of the Adams
Express Company persons receiving
shipments of intoxicating liquors at
local option points in Kentucky must
hereafter make an affidavit before a
Justice of the Peace or Notary Public
that they are of legal age; that the
said liquor is for personal use, and id
not to be used in violation of the
laws of the State of Kentucky, and
further that they do not hold a Fed
eral license for the sale of liquors.
In addition to the affidavit the person
to whom the liquor is consigned must
sign a record book provided and kept
by the express company as required
by lav, which is open to inspection
of city, county and State officers.
The regulation also prohibits the
shipment of booze other than beer in
pint or half pint bottles. The agents
are required to preserve the affida
vits. This ruling should make the en
forcement of the local option laws
some easier, as bootleggers who sign
such an affidavit and are afterward
caught selling liquor may be prose
cuted for perjury, which is a peni
tentiary offense.

PERTINENT PARIS PARAGRAPHS.
"There was never another bargain
equal to that of buying liberty bond

become a financial backer of world
democracy."
Mr. Hoover is to have charge of

who haven't yet decided who shall

We might suggest to Mr. and Mrs.
Moore, of Pleasant street, that they
guard carefully the American beauty
rose bush which bears pink peonies'
for it might aurn out a couple of po
tatoes, and an onion before the sea
son is over.
Lots of men know their possi
bilities, but its a wise one who
knows his limitations.
What Germany doesn't know about
our' war preparations isn't going to

Maybe the reason there is a short
age of tin . cans is they're buying

t Not having heard anything from
her recently we take it for granted
that the Deutschland has slipped an
eccentric.
Another thing to worry about is
that for the past several weeks no
man has been able to tell by his"
corns what kind of weather was com
ing. '
If you feel you can't get into
trouble any other way, why don't
you try telling your wife everything.

June being the month of roses
and June brides, seventeen couples
put themselves on record in the office
of County Clerk Pearce Paton with
applications for marriage licenses.
This number is an increase of seven
over the same month in 1916, when
only ten licenses were issued for
parties seeking double blessedness.
SCOTT SHANKS.
A marriage license was issued
from the office of County Clerk Pearce
Paton, Wednesday, to Mr. Edgar
Shanks and Miss Mattie Scott, both
of the Ruddles Mills vicinity.
Clerk Paton also issued a marriage
license to Mr. Homer E. Carter and
Miss Rhoda Bell, both of Bourbon

THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN
The United States Government
asked a loan of the people of $2,000,
000,000 for war purposes. The peo
ple promptly responded by offering
neary $3,000,000,000 and this tre
mendous sum was subscribed in all
walks of life, from the millionaire
down to the laboring man with noth-
l ing but his weekly pay to draw from.
Even young working girls and little
Boy Scouts dug down when Uncle
Sam sent forth his request for finan
cial aid. It is significant that the
first loan of the war is also the great
est loan in the history of the world,
and fifty per cent overscrubscribed at
that.
The Kaiser and the Germans should
worry!

WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER?
If the present system of number
ing the houses in Paris turns out to
be the proper thing" it will be a great
thing for the citizens and for the
local postoffice force. "Direct your
mail to street and number" will be
the slogan.
A slip has been left in svery busi
ness house and residence in Paris and
suburbs, including all the additions,
showing the number of the house.
The owners or occupants of the busi
ness house or residence should secure
their numbers and have them placed
in position before they lose their
slips. A city ordinance makes num
bering of houses compulsory, subject
to a fine for non-obesrvance.
