THE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY FRIDAY JANUARY 27 1899
A SILLY FOOL
One evening last week I was sitting in
my room at the boarding house smoking
my second best pipe and thinking of noth
ing when the door was banged open and
my chum Bill Morse flung himself into
the room slammed his valise on the floor
threw his hat on the bod and cursing
himself as the greatest fool alive dropped j
into a chair
For two weeks I had been envying that
fellow Engaged to a pretty girl who had j
not made the common mistake of being
born of poor parents he had gone to pass
a whole months vacation in the same i
Connecticut village where his sweetheart
and fcer rr -her were staying
I Waj to 3 surprised to do more than
taroat liil in astonishment He looked
too Jlsgusted with himself for me to offer i
sympathy and I waited patiently for the j
story I know was coming Ill omit the
preliminary blossing on himself and start
with the facts
This morning said
some of her girl friends
he Alice and
started up the
mountain for a hen picnic Mount Riga j
the people in Stilisbury call it I wish it
was a hole in the ground About 10 I de
cided to take a walk and accidentally
meet them I took a roundabout way
because there was sure to be more or less
giggling when I made my appearance no
matter how nicely it was managed
Hero Bill helped himself to my first best
pipe and heaped a few more blessings on
his head
Well said he after a few strong pulls
at the pipe I soon reached a cursed little
hill which sat up against the mountain
like a pimple beside a mammoth wart and
perched on the side of the measly bunch
of dirt was an enormous rock left there
by a glacier I suppose The day it was
dropped there was cold but the day Bill
Morse found it was still colder Climbing
up to the lower 6ide and leaning back
against it I took a look around Just
then some one set off a blast or they began
cannonading off Mole St Nicholas Any
way the jar seemed to shake the hill and
that stone moved I braced myself against
it instinctively the motion stopped and
then came one of thoso Hashes of intelli
gence for which I am famous as you know
old man
You have seen a schoolteacher take
his class into the yard and demonstrate
that one boy can keep a ladder upright by
looking out for the center of gravity etc
and that it takes them all to stop its fall
ing when you let it tip Oh I knew all
about it Bill Morse knew If I let that
stone get started it would crush me tor it
was so broad I covld not spring out of the
way I bored one shoulder into the dou
ble dyed thing and finally twisted round
so as to face it worked my way to the
edge the cold sweat standing out all over
me and jumped clear Things were dark
for a moment but I soon straightened out
and looked to see where the rock had fall
en It hadnt budged
I was going to ask Bill if lie was angry
but he had jumped up and was kicking
his valise around the room and I thought
it unnecessary
Bob he cried between the kicks
words are poor things I agree with the
man who said language was intended to
conceal your real thoughts
After a few more kicks and a fresh pipe
ful Bill resumed I rushed round to the
top of that infernal rock determined to
push it over if it didnt intend to take a
drop itself I moved it about an inch and
to do more than that would require all of
the kings horses Oh but Solomon was a
wise one He said all men were fools
That stone Bob was a rocking stone
When I realized what it was I wondered
why Solomon had not mentioned me par
ticularly I began talking to the stone
and was just beginning to do myself and
that beastly chunk justice when that hen
picnic came screaming down the moun
tain side They had seen the whole circus
Alice gasped out Oh W Will its too
fu funny and then put her hand to her
side and absolutely shrieked with laugh
ter I gave her one look and then told
her a plain truth that I know shell never
forgive Then I rushed back to the hotel
got my things and hero I am Its all
over I m a tool and a wretched one iry
boy
I agreed with him but didnt mention
it Then the light was turned out and we
turned in I slept but I dont think Bill
did Ho moped around the house and ate
precious little The landlady was sure he
ought to see a doctor If I tried to cheer
him up ho only scowled and cursed him
self Connecticut the bi hill the little
hill and everything except the girl a
mighty sensible girl too as you will see
for a few days after as I was entering
the house out rushed Bill as happy a man
as you would want to meet Ho had re
ceived a note from Alice and was on his
way to see h n This is what she said
Dear Will We reached home today
I told mother I simply would not stay
there another hour when I found you were
not coming back Do come and 6ee me
and bring your forgiveness with you I
know I was just what you said a blanked
silly fool for laughing so and if you had
not been angry you would not have been a
Buro enough man and I would not have
cared a bit for ycu As it is I love you
more than ever Yours only
ALICE
P S But it was too awful funny to
see you save your precious lite in that
manner and thou hammer tmit poor help
less old stone
In spite of the P S they are going to
live happy ever after Robert Saunderson

Georgo Augustus Sala was never ap
praised by the public at half his value
His most precious endowment was his
alert and spontaneous humor The or
ganization of the Bentley firm reminds
me of one instance of this Ceorge Bent
ley appointed Sala the first editor of Tem
ple Bar and the new editor selected as a
motto for the title page the sentence
Sir said Dr Johnson let us take a
walk down Fleet street To this day
most people believe this to be a quotation
from Boswell As such it has taken its
place in English literature As a matter
of fact it was an emanation from Salas
own brain a true and delightful bit of
travesty pure essence of Boswell ex

She was a little delicate modest wom
an to whom the world did nothing in
particular until it treated her badly And I
that happened when she had a grown up
daughter and three sons at school and an j
invalid husband who could do nothing to- j
ward earning money that was needed
Then it was that she thought of writing
a book A friend who had dropped in one
evening told a story of an acquaintance
who had written a book in middle age j
and made a great deal of money Then
Mrs Abbey remembered that when she
was a girl before her marriage she had
writter wo little stories and sent them to j
a provincial ptper They had been accept
ed and paid for
She said to her husband I wonder if I j
could write a book
Ho did not answer for he thought she
was not in earnest But Mrs Abbey j
thought of it constantly uiuil ideas began
to crowd her brain She said to herself
I do believe I could write a book There
is no harm in trying
She got a packet of clumsy foolscap pa- j
per and one night when all the house
hold was asleep she lit a lamp and began j
to write And the words came fluently I
very fluently Her daughter Gwendolyn j
awoke and seeing the light came to find i
out what her mother was doing for these
two women shared every hope and care
Mother she cried seeing the pile of
paper what are you doing Oh mother
I do bolieve you are writing a book
At first Mrs Abbey denied it from the
same impulse that had made her put her
hand quickly over the writing when her
daughter came in But after a time she
confessed that it was so and timidly read
aloud the first chapter which she had just
finished
Oh mother it is beautiful cried
Gwendolyn
Shall I go on with it then
Yes yes go on with it Its splendid
Im sure it will sell Do go on with it
So she went on with it And when sev
eral chapters had been written she said
timidly to her husband and sons who
were homo for the holidays I I thought
I might be aljo to write a story I have
put down a few ideas here and Id like to
know if you think it worth going on
with
Ivo read it said Gwen and its so
good
Mr Abbey took the closely written
pages of MS and read them aloud
It is fine It is beautiful they cried
And it was beautiful It was very beauti
ful
She went on writing It was to be a
real book a great book as long as one of
Scotts or Dickens and though her pen
was so fluent the writing took a long
time Besides she had other work to do
household duties to tire her out during
the day and sometimes her head ached
when evening came but as soon as she
took up the pen her cheeks grew flushed
and her mind grew warm with hope She
lost sight of the bare surroundings and
lived in the atmosphere which falls like a
shimmering mist from heaven upon those
who commit their souls to paper and write
with their lifes blood She was network
ing for fame or glory or celebrity She
had no worldly ambition but she worked
for husband and children for bread for
life itself
Every Sunday Mr Abbey read aloud the
chapters that had been written during the
week and they all cried It is beauti
ful The crush had left them smlieient
money to live on for about 18 months
By that timo the book would be finished
and the book must needs be a success bo
cause it was written with all the best of a
womans soul They were shy of men
tioning it to outsiders but Mr Abbey
read part of it to a few intimate friends
and they admired it
I am glad of that said Mr Abbey in
confidence to his daughter because I
rather mistrusted my own judgment
though the book seems to me very beauti
j ful but Mrs Murray admired it Immense
ly And she ought to be a judge
said Gwen because shes a cousin of
I that Mr Johnson the journalist and must
1 know a lot of literary people The book
took nearly IS months to write and by
I that time the money was all used up The
last chapter had been finished and the
end written with a flourish The manu
script was large and bulky and very close
ly written They packed it up in brown
paper and sent it off to a literary agent as
Mrs Murray had advised them to do As
Mrs Abbey handed it over the postoffice
counter she felt as though it was her heart
i that she was sending forth made op Into a
brown paper parcel sealed and registered
and labeled MS only About three
Weeks later the postman brought the letter
for which they had been watching The
literary agent wished to see Mrs Abbey
i the following dav if she would come to
his offices He said nothing about the
book but there was an undefinable fra
granco of kindness about the businesslike
little note or su at least it seemed to them
Next day Mrs Abbey started off with
Gwen both their hearts beating They
went in their best dresses Mr Linley was
awaiting them When he heard them com
ing up the stairs he began to wish him
self 100 miles off He had given the death
blow to many hopes in the course of his
life but ho winced somewhat all the same
Perhaps he had the faculty of reading be
tween the lines
And Gwen and her mother sat quietly
without a word while he broke to Mrs
Abbey as gently as he could the truth
tht her ureat bulky story hid a beautiful
roul in a body hopelessly unlovely It
would be useless to offer it to any publish
er and even it anybody would take it it
would never sell
I an sorry said Mrs Abbey with
dry lips Gwen could not speak or look
up
Mr Linley winced Then he told her
that he could put her in the way of doing
another kind of literary work where her
fluency would be useful and wheie beau
tiful thoughts were not needed Would she
come back to see him this day week
Gwen and her mother walked away They
got into a dingy omnibus to save their
best dresses from being spoiled by the
rain They were quite silent for a long
time
Nevermind Gwennio said the moth
er at last putting one cold hand up to
her mouth I shall do something else
And he seemed a kind man M E
