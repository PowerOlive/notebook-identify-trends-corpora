veget abh-s in the ground. A nev
method of handling this is to take
an ordinary barrel, lay it down on
its sides, leave one end open. This
barrel cn be covered with alternat
ing layers of straw and dirt so ns
to prevent the vegetables from freez
ing. The barrel can then be filled
with vegetables and all the dirt and
straw will be kept away from thepn
throughout the season. Another
point in favor of this barrel system
is that several different kinds of veg
etables can be placed in the same
barrel. After the barrel has been
'filled the head, which should be lc
one piece, is -properly fastened and
, the barrel covered with dirt. When
' it becomes necessary tc open this
