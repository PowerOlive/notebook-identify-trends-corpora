J
Girl Tells How a Blotchy Skin Was
Cleansed By a Simple Wash.
"I was ashamed of my face," writes
Miss Minnie Pickard of Altamahaw,
N. C. "It was all full of pimples and
scars., but after using D. D. D. Pre
scription I can say that now there is
no sign of that Eczema, and that was
three years ago."
D. D. D. has become so famous as
a cure and instant relief in Eczema
'and all other serious skin diseases, .j
that its value is aometimes overlooked
in clearing up rash, pimples, black-
' heads, and all other minor forms of
skin impurities.
The fact is, that while D. D. D. Is
so penetrating that it strikes to the
j,very root of Eczema or any other seri
ous trouble, the soothing Oil of Winter-
green, Thymol and other ingredients
are so 'carefully compounded there is
no wash for the skin made that can
compare with this great household
remedy rfor every kind of skin trouble.
D. D. D. is pleasant to use, perfectly
harmless to the most delicate skin,
and absolutely reliable. A 25-cent
bottle will give you positive proof of
the wonderful effectiveness of tnis
groat remedy.
