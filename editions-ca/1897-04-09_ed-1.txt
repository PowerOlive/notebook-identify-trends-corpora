the home of President Me-Kinley at Canton went democraticThe home of Gov Bushnell at Springfield is strongly republican arid thatcity Monday elected a democraticmayor by over 400 The metropolisand the captital of the state went democratic while the result in the smallerplaces was still more decisiveWhile the result in Cincinnati is duelargely to the opposition to George BCox who had become offensive as aboss the result in the state generallyis attributed to dissatisfaction whichis largely based on the continuation ofthe hard times There are many whoare suffering in business and mammore who are out of work who expected relief the first month under the newadministration and some express theopinion that the free silver sentimentis growing among these peopleThe democratic gains were

recently cometo me from the governors of Arkansas Mississippi and Louisiana and from prominentcitizens of these states and Tennesseocontaining the conclusion that -widespread distress involving the destruction of a largeamount of property and loss of humanlife has resulted from the floods -which havesubmerge this section of the country Theseare stated on reliable authority to be themost destructive floods that have ever devastated the Mississippi valley the water beingmuch higher than the highest stage ithas reached before From Marion Arknorth of Memphis to Greenville Misstance of more than 250 miles by river it is reported there are now at least fifty towns andvillages under water and a territory extending from 100 miles north of Memphis to 200miles south and from 5 to 40 miles wide is submerged Hundreds of thousands of acres ofcultivated soil with growing crops are included In the submerged territory In thissection alone there nro from 50000 to 60000people whose property has been t destroyedand whose business ha3 been suspendedGrowing crops have been ruined thousands ofcattle have been drowned and the inhabitantsof certain areas threatened with starvationAs a great majority of the sufferers are smallfarmers they -have thus been left entirelydestitute and will be unprepared for workeven after the floods have subsidedThe entire Mississippi valley in Arkansas isflooded and communication with many pointscut off In Mississippi a like condition existsThe levees in Louisiana with a single exception have held but the water is rising andthe situation there is reported as being extremely critical Under such circumstancesthe citizens of these states look for the cooperation and suprjort of the national government in relieving the pressingcases of destitution for food clothing and shelter which are beyondthe reach of local efforts The authoritieswho have communicated with the executiverecognize that their first and most energeticduty is to provide as far as possible the meansof caring for their own citizens but nearly ailofhem in the opinion tint after their resources have been exhausted a sum aggregating sit least 150000 and possibly 6OJOJ0will be required for immediate usePrecedents are not wanting that in suchemergencies as this congress has takenprompt generous and intelligent action involving the expenditure of considerable sumsof money

been taken for the great ma-jority of the inhabitants living in the interior whose condition has already been describedUnder these conditions and having exertedthemselves to the fullest extent the local authorities havereluctantly confessed their inability to further cope with this distressingsituation unaided by relief from the governmentIt has therefore seemed to me that the representatives of the people should bepromptly informed of the nature andextent of the suffering and needs of thesestricken people and 1 have communicatedthese facts in the hope and belief that thelegislative branch

a famous gastronomic expert sagely remarked tasteslike a truffle and like nothing else under the sun The late Lord Beaconsfield who strangely enough detestedtruffles is reported to have describedthem as looking like rotten potatoes 1and tasting like bad lucifer matches -The best truffles come from Perigordnear Bordeaux and from a place calledCarpentras which is in the neighborhood of Marseilles To the peasant whoresides in these districts the blackgranulatqd nutlike root is everythingboard lodging fuel and clbthingFrom the end of Xovember when theharvest begins until the middle ofMarch when it ends he hunts for truffles morning noon and night with apraiseworthy diligence which leaves lit-tie to be desired During the remainderof the year he divides his time prettvequally between indulging in

dogspigs arc also used to smell out the hid-ing places of the truffles but experiencehas shown that they are not so reliablebesides being far more difficult totrainEngland takes a considerable proportion of the French crop the price onthe London market varying from sixshillings to two guineas a pound A scries of sevexjp frosts kills the fungus orat- all events prevents it from ripeningand

aceSCopyright 1897Pud was the iirst piece of horseflesh I ever owned and I am sorry tosay the last also My lite since part-r with her has been cast in cityways where only the rich can affordto own horsefleshPud was riven to me when she was- only a yerlinandlwasl3 I thoughtthen as I think now that no more beautiful filly ever stood on four feet I didnot know then as I did later that she-was made my property simply becauseIter owner my uncle thought she wouldnever become much more than a ponyin size and that consequently she couldmever be of much use on the farm but-when I found this out it only increasedany regard ior the pretty little beastBefore she was old enough to be of any- real service she had won as firm apace in my affections as any animalCould possibly hold while her attachment for her young owner I am proudrto say was practically unboundedDuring all her early years she livedthe freest sort of life In the warm-weather she roamed at will over theIcnolly expanse of the 30 acre pasture-on my uncles farm in the wintershe had the run of the straw stackedbarnyard when the weather was nottoo severe and was housedwhen storm or unusual cold came onAs she grew older her beauty in-She was of a dark deepbrown color and her fine coat glistened-in the sunshine even without groomingHer chest Avas full her neck archedUier head small her eyes wide apart-and her ears small and sensitive Jierlegs were trim and clean jointed andher hoofs pointed straight to the frontHer temper as revealed to me was fineund even to old Simeon my unclesyearly hand she seemed the veryrsenee of evil for she could not bear tohave him near her and on the onlvfcasion that he ventured to disregardher evident dislike she placed theprint of two clean and dainty hoofs- rsquarely on his chest After that-one avoided Puds heels and her generalifcputation was badI Rut to me she was all gentleness-Possibly this was partly because I neverJfailed to furnish her with an apple valump of sugar or a nubbin o corn-when I visited her in pasture farm-vard or stable In time she came toVknow my whistle so well that she wouldcome from as fan- away as I could makelier hear the call even if she had tojump a six rail fence to reach me- - Sometimes in the long- summeriiion would pass hours with her inthe 30 aere pasture and then sheAvould follow me about wherever IyVAvent 1 was rather an indolent bbv Im 1iafraid and I liked to spend my timezreading Dickens and Thaekery andliSggleston under the shade by thebrookin the big pasture to the greatdespair of my uncle My readings wereof ten varied by desultory and untrainedattempts to make fvee hand sketches ofmy pet filly and the graceful elms thatt -dotted the feeding ground ol my unclesand when I was reading orsketching there Pud was ahvaVs nearSometimes she would ijeed quietly for aiialf hour and then stretch her musclesand amuse me hugely by kicking up herheels and racing in a circle around meSometimes after a refreshing bit of ex-y ercise lite this she would lie down near5y for a quiet sleep Once when shewas sleeping I slipped silently away toa distant part of the field where 1 hin- behind a tree and whistled for her tof vcbme At the first note almost sheopened her eyes pricked upjier earsv came bounding in my direction-jWt--liftAfter a bit she stopped and whinniedbut the second whistle was enough andshe made an air line to the tree Whenshe had found ine she insisted by nosing about my pockets on another lumpof sugar Fortunately I was able tosupply her with the dainty and shehad no occasion to lose faith in herownerOnce I fell asleep myself in the shadeof an elm and slept longer than Pudliked to have me and then she did nothesitate to waken me exactly as a petdog would have done by licking myface When I awoke she seemed delighted and gave me a fine exhibitionof her running and jumping powersWhen Pud was four and I was 16it was decided that she should bebroken in My uncle was in favor ofputting her in charge of n disciple ofProf Earey whose formula firstfear then love then obedience is sofamiliar to most horsemen xTo thisI would not consent for Ihad seen the Uareyizing of horses andknew that it included much use of thewhip the throwing of the poor bruteafter it had been rendered helpless bya complicated rope harness and so onFinally I got my uncles permission tobreak Pud to the saddle myself I wasto go to an academy or preparatoryschool at the county seat some sixmiles away from home that winter andwas to ride Pud between the farm andthe school I succeeded perfectly intraining her to carry me on her backthough it is hardly correct to say Ibroke her She really needed nobreaking as I knew in advance I hadoften ridden her bareback around thepasture without bridle or even halterand she soon got used to the saddleand girth under iny tuition All thatwinter she carried me faithfully to andfrom school and after the journey hadbeen made two or three times no guiding pressure whatever was needed onthe bit She knew the road as well as Tand she kept it without suggestionf rom meWe lived so far north in one of themiddle states that there was a goodSHE WHINNIED FOR HELPdeal of snow every winter and theroads drifted full in some places Pudproved to be an excellent snow climberwhen there were drifts and when thevgrew too deep to go through and weretoo soft to go over she would jumpany ordinary fence and make a detour round the drifted place throughthe fields Only once did we meet withan accident and then the pretty fillyshowed her affection for her rider inthe most charming fashionIt was in early spring and there wasa bit of ice at a sharp turn in the roadwhich had been covered with mud andso was not apxiarent to the eye Wewere a little late jn getting to schoolthat morning and Pud was runningwith quick joyous leaps and makinggreat time I was sitting easily withmy hand on the pommel of the saddleand the reins hanging loose when herfeet which were not sharp shod foricy roads struck the mud concealingthe little stretch of hard frozen waterQuick as a flash all four feet went fromvnder her and she came down on herside 1 remained in the saddle but myleft leg was caught under the filly Sheslid prostrate some six or eight feetcarrying me with her Fortunately Ihad slipped my feet from the stirrupsas we fell and vvhen she picked herselfup I was disentangled1 though badlybruised and quite unconsciousWhen I came to she was licking myface as sie had once before and thepassing farmer who helped me to rayfeet said she had alternated her caresses with loud whinnying as if tocall for helpit was only a little later that myuncle suddenly sickened and died intihis big farm and all the stock thereonincluding Pud had to be sold in settlement of his business while I had togive up my dream of preparing- for college and set out for the city to seekvome sort of clerical work by which toearn my own livingPoor Pud was sold to a countrybutcher for a mere song and harnessedbetween the

should thedemand at all equal their expectationsthere will be a general desire on thepart of those who have dams suitablefor the purpose to breed to suit the anticipated demand -With no particularleaning for parental government itseems that just here is where a little paternalism would come in to public advantage It is entirely possible in everystate where horse-raisin- can be

oTthe certificate would enable the ownerto offer the services of the horse at areasonable fee inasmuch as he wouldbe in greater demand for his certifiedsoundness at the same time the want cKwarranty

while buying Christmas turkeys in the city market and that is the superiority of themedium sized turkeys over 20 to 24pounders as- sellers People as a ruledo not want enough turkey at one timeto lav a bancuet spread and consequent they pick for something smallor not exceeding- medium in sizeThe hen turkeys always sell firstsimply because they are more suited insize to the wants of the ordinary familyThen the smaller gobblers go and lastlythe pride of the flock thfc biggest tornin the lot and he usually goes at a discount of two or three cents a pound lessthan the lesser weightsA turkey that weighs from ten to fifteen pounds dressed is plenty largeenough The people dont want a turkey as big as a hog but the do want afat turkeyIt seems to us that there is a gooddeal of Toom for improvement in breeding turkeys for the market That abird shorter in legs and neck and veryfull in the breast would be more desirable One that would be meaty andplump and capable of taking on a greatdeal of fatThe heavy weight tall rawbonedtoms that weigh 25 to -10 pounds may besuited to a barbecue feast but they arenot the kind that the man with an ordinary-sizedmarket basket looks forwhen he goes to the city marketThere wouid be more demand andbetter sale for turkeys all the yearthrough if they were grown more witha view to compact bodj meat and fatthan for large size and coarse structureII B

work Defects of Womans Beauty an Anthropometrical and Aesthetic StudyThis dignified title t hardly preparesthe readers for the strongvuiivaVrnishedmanner in which the baron treats bissubject Heagrees with Schopenhauerin his denunciation of those misguidedmillions who find comeliness in the undergrown small shouldered big hippedand short legged sex How muchmore grateful to the clear eye of

concealed their limbs anflowing garments reaching sometimes-to the knee sometimes to tne anKiessometimes to the feet but always farenough to hide the defects in their proportions They now not only

scorning hoorjskirtsbustles and crinolines in order to makethemselves look as little as iossible asnature made themThe ballet girl would seem to confound part of the barons argument buthe does not

a losing fight for he addsplaintivelyBut most of the men of our timeshave ceased to perceive the defects of female beauty Woman has deceived andmisled her admirers so many generations with her smooth
