Harry B. Miller,of Lexington,, explained to theHouse the method of manufacturingtype and printing a newspaper inthe modern plant. He said that theUnited States government had classified newspapers and printing plantsas manufacturing plants.The newspapers, he asserted, domore for the good of the State andcommunity than any other agency.He asserted that 3,000 countrynewspapers failed last year becauseof high expenses and that the billwhich would exempt them from municipal taxation, would help the little country newspaper more than itwould the large city plants.F. V. Vanhoose, of Johnson county,made a point of order that the matter had already been consideredwhen the Minor bill was killed, butwas ruled out order.Leon P. Lewis, of Louisville, called attention to the Thompson taxbill, which he said repealed the exemption of manufacturers. He saidthat the bill would again exemptmanufacturers. He read from thedecision of the Court of Appeals inthe case of The Lexington Leader vs.the city' of Lexington in which thecourt held that newspapers are notmanufacturies."The bill exempting newspapers andprinting plants passed the House bya vote of 52 to 31. It now goes tothe Governor.BOURBON POST TO PRESENTWAR MOVIESOpportunity for education, as wellas entertainment, will be offered tothe citizens of Bourbon county inthe war picture which will be presented here on March 23 and 24, under auspices of Bourbon Post, American Legion.These pictures were taken by soldiers, members or the Signal Corps mt, . . . .

New Yorkers whothronged "Fifth avenue last fall to geta glimpse of tffe Broadway dandy,the deposed Bacchante, the bride'sdollar mark .and ojher curious sculpztures and carvings that adorn statelySt. Thomas' church, missed one ofthe avenue's oldest architectural jests.For more than three decades, it became known today, the figure of a tiredmason has rested and sunned himselfon the roof of the old W. K. Vanderbilt mansion at Fifty-first street, within a stone's throw rof St. Thomas',gazing down at the fashionable equipages and richly clad crowds thatflowed through the famous thoroughfare. The few architecturally Inclined persons who knew of the existence of theVanderbilt mason believed that thefigure was erected as a tribute to amason who was killed during the construction of the house, but RichardHunt, architect, who with his latefather, Richard Hunt, Sr., built thehouse, said .the figure was at oncea joke on and a tribute to the seniorHunt."The Vanderbilt home," said Mr.Hunt, "was built during the transitionperiod, when it was customary to adornthe roof with a sculptured figure ofsome sort. The masons and sculptorswere continually after my father totell them what kind of figure heplanned to use, but he kept puttingthem off, saying there was plenty oftime' to ihpcide after the house wasfinished.

Stone, Commissioner of Confederate Pensions, theHouse of Representatives tabledRaymond Button's bill, providing forthe election of a board of trusteesfor the Confederate Home at PeweeValley from Sons and Daughters ofthe Confederacy. The vote was K4to 25. Mr. Button, who had beensick, arrived at the house just as thevote was in process.The bill was the outcome of adisagreement between the presentcommandant of the home, ColonelDaugherty, and some of the inmates,which resulted in three or four ofthe veterans quitting the place andgoing to their homes, while otrferswere dismissed. Captain Stone's appeal to leave the control of the homein the hands of the veterans whonow 'compose the majority of theboard, however, prevailed over Mr.Crowe's effort to bring younger menand women into, the direction of theinstitution's affairs. -A number of petitions asking forthe change were introduced by Mr.Crowe, but when Capt. Stone ap-pearea on tne scene, waiKing oncrutches, and, for his eighty-oneyears the picture of vigor, and, reciting his four years in the Confederate army, and one in Union prison,his years as speaker of the KentuckyHouse, and his ten years in Congressas representative of the first Kentucky district, it was an irresistible appeal to the House.

I certainly think Doan's area splendid remedy and gladly recommend them to anyone."

The Dalai Lama ofTibet, the religious and secular headof that secluded country, has to workharder than the average British orAmerican business man. He gets upat four o'clock in the morning andlabors until midnight, notwithstandingthe fact that he is unquestionably the"big boss."Sir Charles Bell, a British politicalofficer in India, who has just returnedafter a year's residence in the romantic "forbidden city" of Lhasa, theTibetan capital, says the Dalai Lamais a wonderful personality. Sir CharlesIs one of the few Europeans who havemastered the Tibetan language andthis helped him to become friendlywith the head of all Tibet."He paid me the honor of Invitingme into the forbidden inclosure of hiscountry palace," said Sir Charles.Climate Is Cold."This was a little wonderland offlowers, birds and wild animals a hidden retreat where he gives' deepthought both to his religious and stateaffairs. Hundreds of canaries weresinging here, and there were alsostags, pheasants and a great tigerfrom Bengal.""The climate was intensely coldwhen Sir Charles arrived, and for daysthe- temperature indoors never roseabove freezing point. In the place ofwindow glass Tibetans used a sort ofwax cloth. It lets the wind in, butthey are a hardy race and do not appear to feel the discomfort of the cold."Mutton, yak beef and pork are thestaple diet," Sir Charles went on."Tibetans do not like either chickenor eggs. They do not sleep on beds,but on the floor, on which are placedlarge downy cushions. You lie on topof these and fold them over you. Theyare very comfortable and warm.Heavy Garments Worn."There is an official date for winterto begin and end, and the fur hat andother warm garments ordained for officials are invariably worn without regard to weather conditions betweenthose dates. However comfortable theofficial may be with the fur hat April25 or without It after that date, hewould never dream of departing fromthe sartorial convention In public forfive minutes. The etiquette of the people Is very elaborate and strict."There are, practically speaking, nopolice, no firemen, and no Wheeledtraffic in Lhasa. If a man suffers fromtoothache, he goes with a few friendsonto the flat roof of his house. Hisfriends bring a big stone, around whichthey fasten a string. The string isthen tied to the bad tooth, and thestone dropped over the rooftop. Twoor three friends hold onto the patientto prevent him from going over, too."WOMAN CAPTURES A WILDCATwr-ssr ihnr'.js,-e-r -m- viMM9mffHfBRIS - MMn&' ffEr "fit- fl "atHftlj19r wjuJisDH.YHflBNsVHrrrl.Beast Scratches Her Somewhat, butShe Is Going t9 Raise Itfor a Pet.Lead, S.

As if theirpractice was to fill their papers withlies!The newspapers are as accurateto-day as the great mass of highminded American editors, city andcountry, can possibly make them.Newspapers of the twentieth centuryare far more accurate than they wereunder your first Bennett, under Horace Greely, or even under Dana, andfifty years hence they will have progressed to far greater accuracy thanto-day.Newspapers will be perfect in thisrespect when the time arrives thteditors and reporters will not haveto go to the public to get the news.The facts in news items are dug outof people who are supposed to knowthem. When they appear in the paperand are found to be untrue or misleading, it is practically always thefault of the person or persons towhom the reporter or editor went forhis facts. This is partcularly thecase when you find inaccuracies incountry newspapers.And it isn't to be wondered atwhen it is remembered that, if youare a judge, you cannot get the samestory of an event twice from a halfdozen eye-witnesses all under oath,when not one person out of a dozenwill correctly repeat a remark madein the presence of all of them.Talk accuracy to an editor andyou insult him!
