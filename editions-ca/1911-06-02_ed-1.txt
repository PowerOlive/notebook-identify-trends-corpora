Williams has had more than ahalf dozen robberies traced to himsince his arrest, and the fact that heis behind the bars is a great relief tothese who have been annoyed by hispetty depredations.The last theft committed by thenegro proved his undoing and gave thepolice the clue they have long beenlooking for. Last Saturday he enteredthe home of Henry Hibler on Lillestonavenue, and Mrs Hibler, hearing anoise went to the kitchen where shefound the negro in the act of makingoff with a silver spoon and a bucket oflard. She halted the negro who ueg-ged piteously to be let go. Mrs. Hibler locked him in the kitchen and ivenito the telephone t3 call the police, DUtwhen she returned the negro hadescaped by a rear window. However,she had forced him to tell his name,and Sunday a warrant was issued forhis arrest.Williams for several days eluded arrest but Patrolman Link obtained theinformation Wednesday that he was atthe Bourbon College where hia fatheris employed. The officer went to thecollege where the alleged thief wastaken into custody.The nergo has harassed the residentsin the vicinity of Higgins avenje forseveral weeks and -is believed to be theone who after breaking into the storeof L. Oberdorfer on Main street sometime ago stole several knives. Williams used pome very clever tacticsand in more than one instance whenhe would go to a residence to commithis thefts and if detected always hadin his possessoin a bucket, and wouldask if milk could be purchased. Atseveral places he is said to have returned and made off with chickens,eggs and articles of more value. Hisidentity was not revealed until Mrs.Hibler forced him to divulge his name.rf? fcflHHHiHh HMii"We Know Mow."ml VYftiSUWill Observe Davis' Anniversary.

In the seventhinning after McKernan had protestedagainst one of Shis decisions on balls, and strikes, the Bourbonite manager' was benched by the official, and theincident occasioned a scene which wasdeeply deplored by the coolerheadedspactators.Robbins, who seems to have theBourbonites' "goat," presided on therubber for the visitors and had the locals at his mercy during the hour andforty minutes of the entertainment.He only allowed six hits and provedvery effective with men on bases.The Colts slammed Harold for nine1 safeties and in most instances they! came when men were on bases. Of( the accumulation of runs three of thevisitors' were of the clean cut order,I and were the result of timely hitting.The contest opened with a snap andvigor that bid fair to make it one ofextraordinary interest and in the firsttwo sessions each team succeeded ingetting a man around to the third station, but were unable to count. Aftertwo were down inAthe third Lexingtonput the first run over the rubber on agift, an error and a wild pitch and inthe session following two hits and twostolen bases counted another. In thesixth two doubles added the third tallyand the fourth was annexed in theeighth on a double followed by twosingles.The contest Tuesday afternoon showed a reversal of the affair of themorning and the Bouroonites came outwith the long end of the score. Hauser was on the rubber for the locals andat all stasis had the frisky and aggressive Colts at his mercy. Duringthtj entire sessions they could do nobptter than four hits, two of whichwere scratchy.The locals found Schneider in thesixth inning when McKernan hit thefirst ball pitched him oer the leftfield fence and jogged aruund thebases. Mayer was thumped and sacrificed to second by Maxwell. Barnettgrounded to Kimbro, Mayer going tothird and scoring on Goodman's hitto left. Goodman pilfered second, tookthird on Kuhlmanrs safety and scoreda moment later when Kimbro letSewell's throw to catch Kuhlman atsecond get through him.Another tally was pushed over in theinning following. McKernan was hitand scored on Mayer's drive to leftfield. The Colts scored their lone runi.i the eighth. Badger singled tocenter and took second on a pass ball.Haines fanned andSewell singled scoring badger. Schneider and Vioxgrounded out.Maxweil for the locals and Long forthe Colts played a sensational game inthe outfield each making a very sensational catch. Haoserv finished thegarn stronger than when he beganand his performance stamps him aione of the moat promising youngstersthat has broken into professional ballthis season.

Both Schrauder and Cornell made adisplay of wildnes3, the formei pass1ing five men and the latter four.The locals took the lead in the firstwhen three singles in succession a giftand a sacrifice fly counted two tallies.Another was added in the third whenMcKernan walked, went to second onasacrifice to third on an out and scoredon Konnick's error.A duo of runs in each the sixth andseventh was as far as the locals couldget and in the eighth after McKernanhad doubled to left with one down thenext two hit into uuts.The Senators counted their initialrun in the third after two were down,when wo hits and an error allowedone man to cross the rubber.

In only one inning were theysuccessful in bunching hits, when assisted by two errors, they countedfour runs.In the seven innings Maxwell whiffed six of the Colts.

It was full ofhumor from beginning: to finish anakept the audience convulsed withlaughter from the time the curtainwent up until it went down on the lastact. The characters were all well selected and everyone seemed to be athome in his or her part. It was one ofthe best pieces ever put on by Mrs.Best and all of her work in the pasthas been more than good. This, loo,in view of the fact that the work wasput on with less than two weeks'preparation. The musical programwas also good. Tne piano duet byCapt. Freas and Miss Mary Bingham,the latter a pupil of the CincinnatiConservatory of Music, the vocal soloby Mrs. Hanger, of Richmond, and themandolin solo by Cadet Snow all deserve mention. At the close of theentertainment an informal receptionwas held on the verandas and in thelibrary of the main building1, whichthe vast audience attended.Tuesday morning at 10 :30 the commencement exercises were held. Theaudience was good and at the appointed time the faculty and uclass of 1911consisting of six cadets, wended theirway to the stage. The musical program was good, especially the pianosolo of Miss Mary Bingham and thevocal solo of Capt. Howard Freas.The orations were delivered by CadetJacoby, of Hutchison, second honorman, and Cadet Freas, of Baltimore,Md.. first honor man. These orationswere far above the ordinary and having been coached by Mrs. Best theywere "tripped of much of the schoolboy features which usually attend suchoccasions. Cadet Freas proved himself not only a speaker but an oratorand we see before him a bright future. The baccalaureate addressjwas delivered by Prof. Melcher, of StateUniversity, of Lexington. It wasplain and practical, full of thought andaddresses to the class and cadets.Dealing along the line of man, his possibilities, and his education, he exemplified the remarks by keeping beforethe audience two educators showingthat they had devoted thier whole lifeto them and pointing out great menthat now occupy high places, who began their education under their watchcs?ei, At the close of his address Col.Best in a few appropriate remarks delivered the diplomas to the followingcadets: Freas, Baltimore, Md., firsthonor man, Jacoby.
