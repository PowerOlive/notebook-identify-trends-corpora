Statement to the Amerc in Friends of Circaliritain in llvg rl lo the injectLondon Nov B Lady RandolphCLurcinil made Wednesday the following statement to American friendswith regard to the project of Americanwomen in England fitting out a hospital ship for use in South African waters Tne time for fitting out theMaine is so brief that I am glad icavail myself of the opportunity to setthe project fairly before the Americanpeople The interest manifested byAmericans has already taken such tangible form from 2sew York to SanFrancisco that I am sure an intimation that with the remaining workthere is to do must be done immediately will spur the American publicinto a ready response to our needsThere is but one motive one reasonfor the project of sending a hospitalship to the Cape We have had oratoryand societies for the promotion ofAngle American friendship This isthe golden opportunity to put that expression of good will into tangibleform It is especially the province ofAmerican women to promote thiscause but it is womans function toioster and nourish the sufferingAmerican people are more adept at itwe believe than othersThe Maine is to be essentially anAmerican womens ship We are notto aid only the wounded but are toshow the world that American womencan do that good work better than anyone else can do it I am going to thecape in the Maine not because my sonis there for he will be a thousandmiles away but because I want thegenerous efforts of American contributors to be carried out under the personal supervision of a member of theexecutive committeeI am going because I think I mayprevent aay kind of friction betweenthe American nurses whom Mrs Whitelaw Reid is sending out on Saturdayand the British officials in case suchfriction should arise I contributethat much time and

the pocket of his coat amgrasped a short implement made oftone which the sailors call a fid andwhich he had secured while on board afew moments beforeUnder ordinary circumstances theliquor he had imbibed would have cmifused his brain but now he was onhcon cious of an intense overpoweringdetermination to secure the paperswhich meant so much to the man whocould reach the gold region with themThere had been a smart shower in thiearly part of the evening and thefrom the low eaves- of the hcvsestill continued but had a dragging andrelenting sound A solitary street light50 yards away cast a dismal gleam fora few square yards in either directionwhile an occasional burst of drunkenlaughter from the next street told ofsome party of revelers making theirnoisv wav homeThe mate noticed none of thesethings His eyes were fixed intentlyin the direction from which he expected his victim to come and his squareiaws were set Through his brain ranbut one thoughtThe papersHalf an hour passed and Tom camestriding along under the gaslighthumming a tune end merrily rehearsing the play he haa just witnessedSuddenly the watcher uttered an imprecation under his breath for just ashe was gathering himself for a springhe espied a dark figure stealing noiselessly along behind the young manCloser and closer crept the fatefulshadow and as Tom arrived oppositethe alley where the mate was crouching the latter saw the second figuretake a few rapid noiseless stridesThen an arm was raised over Tomshead and fell with crushing force sending him stunned and senseless to themuddy pavement while his assailantbent over his form to secure the valuables he might have about himWith a shout of rage the mate rushedfrom his place of concealment towardthe stranger who sprang nimbly to hifeet and sped down the street at amazing speed without waiting to disputethe field with the newcomerTo kneel by the prostrate form and jtear open his clothing was the workcf an Instant and when Obed Riderarose to his feet he held the belt containing the precious documents in IdshandsSlipping it quickly into his pocket hegave a hasty glaneeabcut him All wasstill and once more he knelt by Tomtside pantingTs he dead I must be sureIn one hand he grasped his weaponand the other he placed over the youngmans heartAt first he detected no pulsationthen there was a feeble flutter and amoment later Tom groaned faintlyHes aliveThe words were hissod forth in amurderous manner and as he spokeKider raised his weaponBut the blow did not fall for even ashe nerved himself for the stroke themate had a new thought which arrestedhis arm He must have money and hadnj time to lose If he robbed Tom ofboth monev and papers the victimeven if he recovered was powerless topursue his journey further Whowould believe his story of the goldmineAll this flashed through his brain inmuch ess time than it takes to write itand with feverish trembling haste hebegan fumbling about in Toms clothesHe was not long finding the moneywhich Tom carried in an inside pockeof his ves and was rising to his feetwhen a door suddenly opened a fewyards affray and a man came out of thehouseWithout waiting to see in which direction hex

slipped his hand behind himglancing sharply about on every sideApparently satisfied that no one wasnear he knelt by the motionless formand struck a matchIt was a ghastly picture Toms facewas so covered with blood that his features were not recognizable his clothing was disarranged and covered withblack mud and as the newcomer lookeda deep groan came from the prostratemans lipsWith a little exclamation of horrorthe stranger rose to his feet and ranback to the door he had just left liewas gone but an instant returningwith another man who asaisted him incarrying the inanimate form to the

meaningless laughter andfell back upon the bed The blow hadrobbed him of his scattered sennes awlhe faintedWhen the doctor reached his side afew hours later Tom was sufferingfrom brain fever and could not bomoved The second mate had summoned Capt Coffin and now turned tohim sayingWe cant leave him alone and without a cent I was going to try my luckup north in the mines but hang me ifIll leave him

cheeks and growledIm afraid the poor fellow has gothis dischargeCHAPTER VRIDER GETS A SURPRISEObed Rider was far from easy in hismind as the train sped on leaving SanFrancisco behind He had slept onboard the vessel the previous night until the noise of the second mate arousing the captain had awakened himThey did not call him knowing the enmity that had existed between himselfand Tom but he overheard enough totell him that Tom was alive althoughbadly hurt and out cf his head withfeverHe knew Tom was in utter ignoranceof the identity of his assailant but hadhe been aware of the loss of the beltWould the skipper remember the timehe had seen the mate coming out ofToms room and place any new significance on the incidentA guilty conscience made him imagine all sorts of dangers to himself andhe trombleel each time the train stoppedat a station lest an officer should bein wait for himBut nothing of the kind happenedand in due time he reached SeattleHere things seemed more encouragingfor h -vas fortunate enough to tind aman vho had engaged a passage on ait earner for Skagua and Dyea whichsailed the same day The man had received a telegram announcing the dangerous illness of his wife and was eagerto leave Seattle by the next trainThe mate happened to be the firstman he met and the latter soon cametoterms with him and hurried on boardto secure his quarters He kept himself out of sight as much as possibleout when the lines were cast off thefollowing day and the City of Seattlesteamed out of the harbor he drew along breath of relief and said halfaloudWere off at last and Im safe nowHe found that his ticket entitled himto a stateroom and that the trip fromSeattle to Dyea usually occupied aboutfive days All his fellow passengerswere wild with impatience to reach Iheland of gold and now that he felt safefrom pursuit he eagerly listened to thestories of wonderful wealth found bylucky miners foi each one made itmore probable that the papers he hadsecreted- about him were genuine evidence a fact which at times he was inclined to doubtHe had paid the returning miner 3500for his ticket and outfit the latter in-Tbey placed him on the bedeluding three horses and a good supplycf provisions while the former included their transportation to Dyea free ofcost He must however laud themhimself the ccmpany declining all responsibility for this part of the workA short stop was made at Juneau andtwo days later he found himself on thebeach at Dyea with his belongings andfeeling utterly at a loss how to proceedHow to handle this formidable outfitwas a puzzle On board a vessel he wasat home but a horse was an animal ofwhich he knew very little and herewere three of them besides the heapof miscellaneous articles piled on therocky shingleIt was plain that they must be movedbefore the tide came in and with asailors knowledge of knots he soonlashed the burdens on the backs of theraw boned animals and succeeded ingetting them to the town safelyA small tent was among his newlyacquired possessions and he proceeeledto pitch it as best he could piling hisgoods outside He set up his littlesheet iron stove and was going for water when he passed close to one of hisanimals who launched out viciously athim with his hoof sending him to theGround several yardsi away with abroken rib and his left arm badlybruisedWhats the trouble said a

right Capt Scott saidWhat on earth brought you hereHave you been home lately Did yousee my boyThe mate had done considerablethinking during the past few minutesAfter the lirst surprise was over he hadrapidly determined upon his courseand he now shook his head replyingIm afraid I cant give you muchgood news from home capnHis eyes fell as he spoke but theother was too eager to noticeWhat do you

youactThey are murmured Rider stillwith his eyes cast downWithout a word the captain turnedon his heel and disappeared It washalf an hour before he returned andthere was such a change in his ruggedfeatures that even the mate felt compassion for him But he had no alternative Anything to prevent Tomsfather from learning the truth Hehad told hisi story and now he must beprepared with the details Fortunately the absence of his latest victim haelgiven him time to rapidly sketch out aline of procedure which he hopedwould be safeTO BE CONTINUEDGAELIC GREETINGSIn Them the Blessings of God

MACHINES PARTAt last There Has Been a Newture Introduced Into UncleToms CabinThere is a new wrinkle in Uncle TomsCabin theatrical companies One of themwhich is ransacking the state of New Jersey for audiences has hit upon the device ofbuying a refrigerating machine and usingreal blocks of ice in the scene in which Elizapursued by a pack of barking mongrelscrosses the river carrying in her arms astuffed dollThe icemaking machine has proved anenormous success At the Ridgewood operahouse where the ice machine played a fewevenings ago a frantic crowd fought its waythrough the doors At the first performances the ice machine was kept in the bac kground Several cakes were manufacturedbefore the performance and placed on thegreen baize river They were carefully sanded on the surface so that wherr Eliza madeher grand dash for liberty she would notturn undignified somersaults The ice machine however had been so largely advertised that yokels wanted to see it Theysat in their places after the curtain descended upon the solemn death of LittleEva and howled for the ice machine to comeout and show itself The stage managerand a couple of deck hands had to carry itdown to the footlights Then they turnedthe handle and amid uproarous applausethe machine produced a cake of real iceSince then a part has been written in theplay fcr the ice machine When the riverscene opens a couple of southern speculatorsre discovered experimenting with the Jmachine They produce their ice and noihaving any immediate use for it turn it intthe river and it sits upon the river surfacoat proper
