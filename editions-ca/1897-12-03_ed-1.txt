indications of itsJbsving been regummed and reseaJed ItpM almost impossible to put paste on anenvelope as smoothly by hand as it iscone by a machineSo you thought began WhidbyThat when the individual who hadritten my mother under the name ofederick Champney had received theetter coming- on the heels of my telegram his first impulse was to return itjTinopened being afraid the reception ofjit would tend to show his whereaboutsput being- curious to know what I hadjo say he first opened it read it andthen sealed and returned it Not a badidea ehWhidby nodded It failed howeverfto take you inAnd moreover it put me on to a substantial clew See here are the twoenvelopes side by side the one addressed to my mother and the other tojMr Strong Now for points of rejsemblance The handwriting- thoughdisguised is the same the ink under aglass shows the same crystal formations the two letters were sent fromithe same postal station in New York 2And though the color and quality ofeach envelope are different yet underrthe flaps in raised letters are the namesof the same retail dealers in New YorkSee Ramage Co Stationers EastFourteenth street The two envelopeswnere purchased at the same shopBut said Whidby doesnt it strikeyou that it is rather an unnatural thingfor a man guilty of murder to do toopenly write to the mother of a detectiveto get his addressPeople guilty of crime will do themost foolish things in the world Hendricks answered but I have to resortto my own vanity to account for hisShaving done as he did I flatter myselfIfcliat he knew something of my skill inin detecting- crime and once lie foundhimself guilty he regarded me as theman he had the most to fear He discovered-as his note to my mothershows that I was out of town Thatmade him uneasy The thoughttroubled him so much that he simply hadto satisfy his mind on that point Hesupposed his little game with mymother would succeed and that shewould think no more about it after replying-to his noteAh yes exclaimed Miss Delmarand when he got your letter and telegram it must -have frightened him tofind himself in direct correspondencewith the man of ail others he was mostanxious to avoidExactly the detective agreed andshall lose nothing- by what he lias doneSor his letter shows me where to lookjoT him He is in New York and hasbeen there ever since lie committed themurder and scattered those notes abouttown They were desig ned to make usthink the murderer lived hereBut said Miss Delmar surely youhave overlooked the fact that MrEoundtrce has received a warning sincethen and that Mrs Walters has beenshot at by the man himselfHendricks looked a little embarrassedI cant explain that how he saidbut I know whereof I speak He is inNew York I am going there to nightend shall do my best to lift the cloudfrom over your two heads If I fail itwont be my fault I shall not leave astone unturnedWhether you succeed or not we shallnever forget you for all you have doneand are trying to do said Miss DelmarI really dont know what we shall doMy father is threatening to disinheritand disown me and if half the worldcontinues to believe Mr Whidby guiltywc shall be miserable enoughYou arc- indeed in a disagreeablesituation said Hendricks in a kindlytone No one knows better than I Tobo frank though the bare fact maypain you a little I must tell you nowthat it has only been on my earnestassurance that I had hopes of producingthe real criminal that I have kept Welshand -his gang from arresting you MrWhidbyThere was silence for a moment MissTeiinar changed couhtennnccihouglrshe strove hard tokcep -her selfposscstidnTather mentioned something about Ithe probability of an immediate arrestshe said in a wavering tone But Ithought he did it out of spiteNo I presume he must have gotit from something the police have setafloat Hendricks replied and I thinkyou ought to know what to expect Buteven if they should arrest you MrWhidby try to put a brave face on thematter and hope for a clear acquittalat a trial in court I shall hurry upmatters in New York I promise youDr Lampkin has agreed to join me andtogether we are going to track the reptileDo you expect to find anything aboutthe man at that Brooklyn addressasked Whidby gloomilyPerhaps so but it may only be aprivate letter box place and thoseple are very hard to get anything outof As a rule their business is a littleoff color you know and they dread exposure The return of my letter showsthat the murderer is on his guard andhe may steer clear of that addressCHAPTER XVIIn the afternoon two days later Hendricks called at the office of Dr Lampkin in New York He was shown intoan anteroom where half a dozen patients sat in a row against the wall eachawaiting his turn Hendricks sat downat the end of the row crossed his legsand soon became deeply absorbed inthoughtPresently he heard a cough andlooking up saw the doctor beckoningto him from the office door Hendricksrose and went inDr Lampkin was laughing heartilyYou dont know how comical youlooked he said You were sitting beside the worst old morphine reprobatein New York He had a sleepy stare inhis eyes and with yours you were trying to dig an idea out of a spot in thecarpet Why didnt you come right inIf you had only sent up your name youneed not have waited a minuteI didnt want to get in ahead ofanybody replied the detective with agood natured smile I thought Td takemy turn and get you to focus some ofyour magic on meWhat is your complaintStupidity I understand you cancure a great many mental troublesHow does the diseaseaffect youKeeps me from attending to business I am continually chasing fancieswhich lead nowhere But jokes asideI want you for awhile this afternoon ifyou can get offIm at your serviceBut the these patientsOh my assistant can dispose of themeasily Business is very light to dayBesides I am dying to do something inthe Strong case The truth is I want tohelp that young man out I took a greatliking to him the night I saw him lyingthere helpless going through thatbloody role And his girl Miss Delmar did you ever see herYou knojv I know her What aretalldng about -you jf -Thats a fact Pd forgotten She issimply lovely and I admire her pluckPd like to thrash that father of hersBut what do you proposeHave you found out anything abouta hypnotist answering the descriptionI have given you of our manNot a thing so far but I dont despair of doing so soon But what arewe going to do to dayI want you to go over to Brooklynwith me 1 think the only thing now isto find out how the fellow used that addressPerhaps he lives thereHardly likely but we shall seeIn 15 minutes the two men were onthe bridge cars crossing the river toBrooklyn Reaching the other sidethey continued on the elevated road toUnion street where they alightedThen they walked along the pavementlooking at the numbers on the plateglass over the doorsBy Jove there you are directly opposite exclaimed Dr LampkinThats 234 and no mistake about itNow for an interesting climax or adownright failure And he started tocross the streetStop d n it cried Hendriclcslooking straight ahead of him and walking on Come alongWhats the matter asked the doctor in- a low tone as he caught up withhis companionNothing serious no harm done butwe must approach the place moremore casually so to speak than thatSuppose we had crossed there some onein the house might have seen us andbeen aware of our approachYou are right I never thought ofthat Henceforth Im going to hold mytongue and act only as you direct saidDr LampkinWell go to the end of the block andcross over Hendricks returned Hisbrow was wrinkled and the doctor sawthat he was inwardly disappointedabout something They had reachedthe end of the block and crossed overbefore Hendricks spoke again I maybe sadly mistaken but I am afraid weare on a wild goose chase The houselooks like the respectable home of middle-classpeople If it had been a lodging house or a cheap boarding place theoutlook would have been more encouragingnow do you know it isnt one or theother asked the doctorDoor plate for one thing and thenit is too clean was the reply just asthey reached the steps Now well seewhat name is on the plate By Jovehang me if it isnt Champney I dontlike things that look so easyA servant girl answered the ringDoes Frederick Champney livehere asked the detectiveThe girl stared for an instant in surprise then she recovered herself witha start as if she had suddenly recollected somethingOh I suppose youre theHeachershe said He is upstairs Wstudyinhis jHendricks bowed iWell

up the stairs Dr Lampkin natdown watching his companions facecuriously Hendricks remained standing where he could observe the stairsthrough the half open door He benttowards the doctorIll do the talking It is well that shetakes us for some one he is waitingfor It may throw him off his guardunless he suspects Hang it I feel asif I ought to have gone up to his roomHe put his hand into his sack coatpocket and with a cautious look intothe hall drew out a revolver and handedit to Lampkin Hide it but have itready to draw Remember we dontknow what sort of man we are going tomeet nor his humor Let me managehim but if he should happen to get thedrop on me come to my assistanceAll right replied the doctor Youcan depend on meHendricks took another look into thehallI hadnt the slightest idea we shouldrun up on this he said I told you Iwanted treatment ior stupidity Soinething is radically wrong with me ShThere was a sound of footsteps on thefloor overhead a clatter on the stairsand a boy 11 or 12 years of age veryneatly dressed came into the room hurriedly He stopped short and his eyeswidened in astonishmentI I beg your pardon he stammered flushing Sarah told me myteacher had come and and wantedto see meA look of perplexity darted across theface of the detective and for a momentthere was an awkward pause ThenHendricks saidWe wanted to see Frederick Champney on a matter of business Does helive hereThats my name sir said the boytimidlyPerhaps it is your fathers also suggested Hendricks in a reassuring toneMy father is dead replied the boyHis name was Stephen H ChampneyThen you aTe tha only FrederickChampney in the familysir The boy spoke slowlyand then ended with a start His glancewavered under the sharp gaze of the detective -whose face had undergone aremarkable change When Hendricksspoke his voice sounded to Dr Lampkin strangely harsh and firmI received a letter from this streetand number It was signed FrederickChampney Did you write itThe boy suddenly fell to tremblingand his face worked in an effort to con-thought he did it out ef spitetrol himself but he hung his head insilence Hendricks repeated his question but still the boy would not replyHe looked towards the hall as if hewished to escapeSeeing this Hendricks stepped between him and the doorI may as well be plain with you myboy he said I am a detective legally authorized to arrest anyone suspected of law breaking A letter ofvery grave importance has been writtenover your name If you know anythingabout it and wont tell me I shall becompelled to arrest you on suspicionThe boy stared

theboy with all his strength and he rolledon the floor in Hendricks clutch andbeat the legs of his captor with hisfists Just then a white faced middleaged woman ran into the room fromthe rear stairs followed bv the maidwho had admitted them On seeingher and being released by the detectivethe boy ceased his cries ran to hismother and hid his face in her lap Shecould only stare at the two visitors

Frederick Champney I cantthink this little fellow could be guiltyof any misdemeanor you know madambut from his actions it is plain to methat he knows something about thematter He started to run away

madefor Mongolian pheasants The fame ofUregon s gamevt of birds has spreadall over the United States and knowing a good thing when they see it theeastern sportsnen are particularly anxious to secure n number of the choicebirds for breeding It is not likely thatany great number of the Mongolianpheasants will be sent out of OregonThe shipment of these birds beyond theboundaries of the state is prohibited bylaw except under permit There havebeen large numbers thus shipped andthere has also been a goodly number ofthe birds successful y smuggled outThe state of Ohio now maintains apheasantry at Van Wert and is furnishing eggs and birds to private partiesThe pheasants were introduced intoOhio from Oregon but there is no record here of any permits being issuedfor the transportation of such birds tothat state and it is supposed the firstlot was smuggled through The fishcommissioners of California are attempting to introduce the Mongolianpneasant into tnat state and someweeks ago placed an order in the handsof a man living in Eugene for 400 pairs tMr McGuire will take good care thatno such number of birds is sent tofornia or any other state as it wouldbe a clear violation of law to do so Inorder to secure a permit for shipmentof pheasants out of the state the persondoing so must make an affidavit that heis the owner and in possession of thepheasants he wants to ship He mustalso swear that the birds are fully domesticated and kept for propagationand exhibition purposesThe persons who have gone into thebusiness of shipping pheasants for themoney there is in it have in some instances an easy conscience and have noqualms in making the affidavit aftercatching the birds and keeping them inconfinement for two or three days Inorder to circumvent this class of people Protector McGuire has revised theaffidavit to be made so that it will readthat said Mongolian pheasants werebred and raised in confinement andthe name of the breeder will also have tobe given The introduction of the Mongolian pheasant in Virginia is beingtaken up with great enthusiasm by thesportsmen of that state who hope forits success Portland OregonianBROKEN UP BY A SPOOKWrnltli AV111 Cause Abandonment

day andthe Aveek afterward her body was foundin the sound back of the stationdrownedJohnson tifter that became very taciturn and moody and the men seemedto think that he was almost out of hismind although ho suspicion was attached to him A month or so ago stories began to come up here of a ghostwalking at the station and shortlyafter that came the story of how Johnson had killed himself after confessingto the drowning of Mrs SmithCapt Dodd who tells the story saysothers had heard of fhis spirit wandering around and he had seen what hethought was a ghost twice on the beachIt appeared to be the indistinct formof a woman floating through the air afew feet above the earth clasping herhands and weeping I did not tell ofit for several days until I found outthat others had seen it as well as myselfSometimes it came up near the stationand twice I heard wild and uncarthlyscreams at midnight By a singularcoincidence each time Johnson was outdoors He came in then with blanchedface and staring eyes and rushing tohis bunk plunged beneath the clothesand refused to speak to anyone Cincinnati EnquirerNot Used to His EstateThe best joke of the honeymoon seaSon is told by a southern hotel

friendswith little Tupper a connecting link inthe fellowship Marvin the honor manoverlooking his Latin Gregory theiriggest and dullest announced publicly that if any fellow bullied Tupper hedsetter the matter personallyTupper out of breath found hisIfriends in a retired corner of the station turning their pockets inside outEe followed their example and whenthey said Not a nickel he said Nota

wouldntshow it put his hands in his pockets jjand said Weve got to make the best-of it Tt was our own fault and theres nouse whining- Gregory and Tupper did jlikewise and followed down the platform as jauntily as possible to whereffackins engine stood in the sunEverybody called him Jackins without the least disrespect even his wifeall the children around his house andDr Shored itchs boys with whom he-was in special favor If they said MrJackins he looked grave and he wassensitive as to his given name whichsvas GamalielJackins st at the window with agrimy hand at the throttle He wasalmost ready to start Hello hecalledMarvin and Gregory replied withmore vivacity than the occasion demanded Hello Jackins Glad to seeyouTappers eyes grew larger and gravers people hurried to the coaches andporters wheeled trucks of luggage tothe baggage carBeen on a lark I reckon Jackinsdrawled in his slow down south accent If youd come down here fourminutes later youd found the traingone and then what would you havedone Better get yo places Hemoved his hand and the muffled steamseemed to ask indignantly What indeedThey called up such unpleasant prospects that the three strolled fartheraway Tupper who

coalPresently he thrust his head out of thewindow and began to wipe the perspiration from his forehead and sing DixieWhat aint you gone aboard yetYoull be left Wheres yo cronies- Whats that asked TupperThe other twoTheyre aroundOnly two minutes moreTupper went close to the side of theengine and whispered JackinsWell Jackins whispered backLean your head way down willycuJackins leaned far over

anymoneyWhy then they cant go Yo gotto pay on the train He scowled andadded Got toTupper related the story of the emptypockets Jackins was sympathetic Hecounted his money and found 57 centswhich he offered Tupper said -Marvinmust have that Marvin make Jackinsan elegant acknowledgment but he hesitated about leaving the othersWhen the train was about to startJackins called them all young rascals and said next time theyd deserveto be thrashed but hed see what hecould do JTe hurried them into thecaboose and at cveiy station he lectured them on their follyAfter this Jackins never passed thecampus without a peculiar whistle asign that he remembered his friendsso that one afternoon long wail fromthe throttle was something out of tihjeordinaryenough to ask Whats up with JackinsThat night at table the doctor remarked to the head master I hear theNorth West is about to institutethe educational test among its employes All who are found deficient willbe dismissedIt only goes as far as an ability toread and write replied the youngerman Few will lose by itYes One exception perhaps withus thats Jackins But he has beenone of the most faithful and valuedmen in the service for 30 years eversince this branch of the road wasbuilt These reforms are often hard inindividual instancesAfterward Marvin Gregory and Tupper went down to look for Jackinswho lived in a little bit of a house backof the station From the door he couldsee his engine on the trackHis wife made cookies for Dr Shoreditchs boys now she was away andhe sat on the step alone He laid hispipe down on the step and looked dejectedly across the rails at the shiningbrass bell and throttleMarvin had suggested that unlessJackins had mentioned the subject itwould be better not to speak of it butTupper brought it about unconsciously by saying What sort of a signalwas that you gave us to day Was thereanything wrongJackins began his explanation circuitously When I was a body wedidnt have all these schools and colleges and one thing and another tolearn people in my country I livednear where the people was called crackers My mother was a widow womanwith three head o children to look outfor and the first thing I remember isdiggin alongside her in the cornpatchAn by an by she grew weaker anweaker yo see she was sickly anthen there was more diggin for me bymyself cause the children had to havesomething to eat an to wear an it allhad to come out of the groundThey set up a school for threemonths in the winter he proceededThe children went but I didnt haveany time Somebody had to stay aroundhome I picked up some spellin fromthe rest of em an after awhile mother died an we stayed together untilthe youngesiHvent off to the mines ansister got a home of her own I workedaround until I found myself up here Twas a hand in the yard first then fireman then engineer an engineer Ivebeen ever since for well nigh 30 yearI cant think somehow o bein anythingelseHe took up his pipe but laid it downagain

think a heap othat engine as if it was a horse an itwill come strange to see anybody elsecleanin the brasses an dxivin herdown the road I reckon I can getplenty o work elsewheres but whena mans stuck

an set to work But all thesewords is strangers to me Now anthen I see some old acquaintancesHeres an s o ani f I remember them But whats thisThats arbitration You must takeone syllable at a timeMrs Jackins came up Avith a basketof sugar and spices on her arm Shepntered into the subject at onceI tell Jackins not to give up Anyman as can run a engine like him canlearn to read a newspaper in fivemonths Thats all hell have to doJust give a specimen of reading andwriting And as for figgers Id like tosee man woman or child at can keepcount add up and dfrJde like him Imnever bothered about

bought his entrance fora Christmas gift Then we like to savea little to leave behind when weregone Theres Jackins sisters childrenOn their way home the boys saidJackins ought to brush up and stick atit There was nothing like sticking atit If he only had somebody to givehim a liftThe following day Tupper rapped onthe door of the doctors When hecame out he paused on the thresholdlong enough to say And if you pleaseDr Shoreditch dont mention it to thef ellows Theyd laugh if he failedThe next day Marvin in closing avery dignified interview with thetor said Id take it as a great

keeping- a secret which hemust not share and the secret whichwas an open one to the faculty mighthave been common property at anytimeTupper perhaps fared worst Hetried a variety of friendships but hefelt forsaken without the society of histbig friends As for Marvin and Gregorythe head master declared the temporary estrangement added much to theamount of work doneAt Easter the friendship which hadbeen likened to a triangle threatenedto go to pieces Dr Shoreditch thoughtseriously of arranging an explanationJackins who had kept more secrets inthe last four months than in all his lifebefore told Jane every night in theweek that somebody ought to say somethingThe boys came back from the holidays on Tuesday and at night as Jackins sat poring over the paper and MrsJackins was putting- a

did not go intodetail Both told Tupper he was firstclass and then they sat around thetable while Jackins attacked odd paragraphs in the new book in a very loudvoice or wrote sentences with so mucheffort that perspiration stood in beadson his foreheadFor the first time in a long whilethe boys crossed the campus arm inarm They sang one of their mostabsurd songs with Tuppers shrilltreble high

came off inApril Dr Shoreditchs boys had a halfholiday They went up to town andwaited around the rooms in which thetrial was held until Jackins came outpassedThen there were a great many cheersand shouts and caps thrown up in airand struggles for each to obtain hisown and a -rush down to the stationwhere Jackins engine in a little whilewas made gay with bunting and lookedas festive as possible In fear -andtrembling Jackins had burnished allthe brasses in the morning If he succeeded well if not it would be equallywell to have the work properly doneMrs Jackins was on the train veryproud and happy There was more thanthe usual number of passengers DrShoreditch and some of the mastershad gone to hear the result of the trialThej scarcely knew whetherspected Jackins more for his 30 yearsof

theLatin racesCultivating the voice is generallv understood as learning to sing but there15 voice culture which goes very farbeyond anything appertaining to musical instruction When the child begins to speak care should be taken thatit makes the proper sounds instead ofthe unnatural tone which it is very likely to acquire The child is an imitativecreature and follows very closely thesounds that it hears from those aboutit If it constantly listens to any particular sound as a matter of course itwill very soon take it up and adapt itas its own Of even more importancethan the cultivation of the voice is thebuilding of it No one need be told thatthere is a wonderful advantage in working upon any structure that has a carefully-plannedand properly finishedfoundation The majority of singersare given to extreme faultiness in theirenunciation This comes largely froma very slovenly habit of speaking a habit formed in early childhood from association with persons who give very little if any thought to the constructionof their language being perfectty satisfied to all appearance so long as theyare able to make themselves understood The time is well spent that isgiven to teaching the little ones the correct modulation of their voices Weall know children to whom it is a pleasure to listen their intonation in speaking is so agreeable and their words seemso well chosen that one

fellow of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons the hoofrequires attention i it is to be kept ina healthy condition It is before thehoof is shed that the feet are generallyneglected and the animals suffer accordingly because they are young andimmature and the bones and other tissues are soft and could be easily distorted to suit the conditions underwhich they are kept The feet of foalsand growing horses should thereforehave attention given them since neglectat that period often sows the seeds ofcontinuous trouble The hoofs shouldbe kept clean by being picked outas often as possible to prevent any sortof hard substance being buried in thefissures of the feet They should beexamined from time to time say everysix or eight weeks to detect any defects of shape that might be takingplace If the feet are not growing leveland symmetrical they should be madeso by rasping away the horn which isnot naturally worn down If this is neglected the animal will soon have thefetlock joint bending over towardsthe outside On no pretense whatevershould the front of the wall be interfered with for the glazed coating of itssurface protects the horn beneath itit should therefore be left untouchedIt would be as well to disabuse peoples minds of a very popular fallacythat wet soft ground and evenmanure yards are the best places tokeep young horses and some wouldeven have the frogs and soles paredthin to allow the moisture to penetratemore easily No greater mistake ismade than this for the preservation ofthe hoof depends to a great extent uponthe soil the animal was reared on Thebest footed horses are bred on drysoils and that is undoubtedly the kindof ground best adapted to the healthygrowth of horn Young horses require plenty of exercise and unlessthey are allowed it the growth of thehorn etc is sure to be defective Thenthe question arises When ought ahorse to be first shod The answer iswhen the work required of the animalwears the horn away faster than it isformed or grown or in other wordsso long as the horn of the foot canstand the wear required it will notneed protecting shoeing Moreoverif the young horses are not shod soearly they will not be worked so hardand fewer would be ruined in theiryouth as is too often the case at thenresent timeiir iNEAT FEEDING PENHow to Protect the Pig llntionHfrom Greedy FowlsWhere hogs are fed near the housesr barn the fowls are apt

INCREASESIinpoeiafct Report Sent ly ConsurCimadar at Vera CruzWilliam W Canada United Stateconsul at Vera Cruz Mexico has madeazi important report to the secretaryi state on our commerce with Mexicoin which he savs that ithe commerce ofthis country with Vera Gruz is increasing rapidly Imports into Mexicothrough the port of Vera Cruz fromEuropean countries have fallen oil inthe last two years about 14 per centwhile thosefrom the United States havegrown in about the same extentIn 1895 the United States had about15 per cent of the total import tradeof Vera Cruz city and in 1897 it hasrisen to 19 per cent Consul Canadasays that the favor with which European goods are received in Mexico ianot due to the superiority of the product but to the fact that business firmsin Europe pay imore attention to theneeds of the Mexican marketThe consul mentions the ignoranceof some United States shippers in regard to the meaning of the term legalweight which includes not only theweight of the merchandise but theweight of all inner packages and wrapper only the extreme outside case being excluded Fully 40 per cent of thecommodities specified in the Mexicantariff are dutiable on this basis andin some cases on account of the methodof packing 90 per cent of the duty mustbe paid on the ureless woodThe consul speaks of the defectivetranslations of manufacturers catalogues sent from the United States toMexico Hundreds of thousands of dollars he says are actually thrown awayin the United States in having translations made that are incomprehensibleto the people they are supposed to enlightenOFFEREDTHE BED TO THE QUEENStory of an Engrlisliinitn Who BonglilWales Yaclit BritanniaFrom the comments heard in the London clubs it is not likely that Mr JohnLawson Johnstone of Kingwood Kentthe principal director of a well knownand largely advertised company whoturns out to be the purchaser of theprince of Wales famous racing- cutterBritannia will be received with openarms in yachting circles In fact it isrumored that the prince sold the yachton the express condition that the purchaser should not race her and that sheis to be rigged as a cruiserMr Johnstone also told the interviewer how he had recently paid 7503750 for a bed upon which PrinceCharles slept before the battle of Culloden This he offered to present toQueen Victoria who replied that onlyon one or two occasions had she accepted presents from a commoner and shedid not see her way to accept the bedHowever it was a very pleasant letter very pleasant said Mr Johnstone who added that the duke of Argylle had promised to come and sleepin the bed as soon as the matter couldbe arranged The newspapers jeer atthe inappropriateness of the selectionWthe Campbells of which clan thedulceof Argylle is the head
