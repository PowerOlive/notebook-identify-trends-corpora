PAST TEN DAYS.THEBOURBONCharged with misrepresenting himself as an authorized recruiting officer for the United States army, andthereby obtaining money from Msaudiences, Dr. John Fritz, of Covington, who lectured to Paris audiencesrecently, was arrested in Louisville,by United States Deputy MarshalWorkman, on an affidavit sworn to byMaj. J. S. Battle, in charge of theLouisville recruiting station.Patriotic motives inspired him,said Dr. Fritz, who claims Waco,Texas, as his home, to take to thelecture platform to secure recruits.He admitted taking up collections,but said that the mony, with the exception of a small sum to defray hispersonal and necessary expenses, hadbeen turned over to the Red Cross organizations at each place he lectured.He said he had been the means of obtaining more than two hundred recruits for Uncle Sam's army. Hehas in his possession letters of recommendation from the military authorities in Texas and Ohio.The affidavit which caused Fritz'arrest charges specifically that hesecured money from a number of people at Lagrange, Ky., on June 10,during a lecture there and that hehad misrepresented himself to Capt.Thos. F. Lyons, commander of thelocal Marine Corps recruiting officeas a member of the Medical ReserveCorps. It was also ascertained thatlie had secured money in differentsums at Millersburg, Paris, Cynthiana, Falmouth, and a number ofether Central Kentucky towns.Dr. Fritz was unable to furnishbond in the sum of $1,000 and wasremanded to jail. He wired the storyof his arrest to City Manager DanDurbin at Cynthiaua, and told himhe was in jail as the result of a proGerman plot, that he needed a lawyer and $1,000 bond. Mr. Durbinmade no reply. Fritz' examiningtrial was set for two o'clock, nextTuesday afternoon before United,States Commissioner John P. Haswell,in Louisville.Dr. Fritz' appearance in Paris followed a telegram sent by him fromLexington to the Red Cross people ofParis, asking for a speaking datehere. He came to Paris and spoke atthe court house on June 4, and atthe Grand Opera House the samenight. At the latter place a collection amounting to over $100 wastaken up for the Red Cross work,after an eloquent address by Dr.Fritz, but he did not handle a centof the funds, which were promptlyturned over to the Red Cross. Whenthe collection was started Dr. Fritzplaced a five-dollar bill on one of theplates, stating that it was all he hadin the world. This was returned to"him at the close of the meeting.A number of his utterances herecreated suspicion that he was not allon the square. He claimed to be amember of the medical corps of thearmy, and said that he would sail ina few days for the fighting zone, andthat he never expected to returnalive. This statement had a very depressing effect upon a number ofyoung men in the audience, who hadpreviously expressed their intentionof enlisting in the service.Dr. Fritz was well-received wherever he spoke, as he had a very convincing and affable manner. AtMillersburg, and,other places wherehe spoke before and after leavingParis the news of his arrest createdconsternation. From the collectiontaken at Millersburg he is said tohave received $25 for his personalexpenses, and the rest was turnedover to the Millersburg Red CrossSociety.tn Pa laTHE COUNTY COURTS HAVE JURISDICTION. "Country Courts have jurisdictionof the trial of offenses against thefocal option act of 1916, requiring those convicted of selling'liquor to give bond," the Court ofAppeals, said in an opinion, at Frankfort, Friday, by Judge Miller affirming Warren Circuit Court in the caseof the Commonwealth against JohnLay. The latter pleaded notguilty to a charge in theCircuit Court of selling liquorthat he previously has been convicted in the County Court. The Commonwealth contended that the County Court had no jurisdiction, because the penalty included the bondand that judgment was void. Thecase was dismissed on Lay's plea andthe Court of Appeals affirmed it, saying the bond was for future goodhchavior and not the penalty of pastoffenses.Satisfactory progress is reportedby those having in charge the workof raising the $15,000 to be Bourbon's apportionment of the big RedCross National Fund of $100,000,000.The workers report that they havebeen very warmly received in theircampaign, and that all indicationspoint toward a ready response to appeals for funds. All feel in a veryoptimistic mood as to the success ofthe campaign in this county.At a mass meeting held in Millersburg, Wednesday night, the city exceeded its Red Cross fund allotmentwhen subscriptions amounting to$1,500 were taken. The sum of $1,200 had been apportioned to the city.The request for contributions wasmade at the close of an enthusiasticspeaking program, heard by a largeaudience gathered in the auditoriunof the Millersburg College, and theanswer was voiced spontaneously byscores of persons.Speakers at the meeting were Eld.C. O. Cossaboom, Col. C. M. Best,Rev. A. S. Venable, Rev. J. W. Gardner and Rev. J. W. Redd.

A bunch of cattle wasbeing driven down Pleasant street,attended by a couple of small boys.The result was that the young hedgefence at the home of Judge and Mrs.H.

R. met with Mrs. ThomasHenry Clay, Sr., on Wednesday afternoon at her beautiful home onPleasant street.Warm breezes and a smiling skywere promised by the weather man,and right loyally did he keep hisword.Mrs. Clay wras assisted in enter-taining by her daughters, Mrs. Frederick A. Wallis, Mrs. Thos. HenryClay, Jr., Mrs. Geo. Williams Clay,and by her sister, Miss Lou Williams.The flower garden in the rear wasin its summer dress and was a delight to the eye. Stately lillies andiris, Cantebury bells and fox glove,daisies and gallardias, phlox andcoreopsis mingled in sweet profusion.Sunken lily pools, arches coveredwith pink and crimson remblers,stone benches, a pedestal having asundial, and a beautiful pergola added to the picture.Mrs. Clay posses in a marked degree the gracious, cordial bearingthat seems to be the birthright ofKentucky women, and has the happyI faculty of making each one of herguests feel particularly welcome,thus giving her hospitality an added charm.j Mrs. W. G. Talbott, the regent of, the Chapter, called the meeting toorder about 2:45 and the business ofthe occasion was immediately takenup. It was decided that the members should form a Red Cross Circleand should sew on Monday in thestoreroom recently vacated by Mr.Wm. Sauer. About twenty responded to the call and agree to give theentire day. This matter being disposed of, Mrs. Wallis brought up thosore need of clothes for the littlewar babies in France. She had cutand arranged twenty-five nightgowns and twenty-five little cottonsacques to be made and soon eachtiny garment was in the hands of awilling-worker and needles andthimbles were brought out in 1xTwinkling.The ladies took the little clothes totheir homes to finish and promisedto return them to Mrs. Wallis thelast of the week.After two hours' work a beautifulcollation was served, made up of pineapple salad, tomato sandwiches, stuffed peppers, beaten' biscuits, cheeseballs, water ices and candy.As the guests took their leave, alast stroll through the beautiful garden was enjoyed, and a glass offrappe added a finishing touch to anideal entertainment.The picture of war-torn Europepersisted in coming to my mind as Igazed out over this little corner ofperfection in "God's own country"and the line, "when every prospectpleases, and only man is vile," rangin my ears and deep in my heart Iwondered if any of us were bigenough to say of our own enemies asfhe crucified Christ said of His, "Fater, forgive them for they know notwhat they do."P.

Music for thodancers was furnishe'd by the SmithSaxophone Quartette. The hourswere from eight to three-thirty, andthe dancers thoroughly enjoyed everymoment of the time.

The condition of the fieldshas improved very materially in thspast week or ten days. Recent rainshave been very beneficial.Stripping, which is usually far advanced at this time of the year, wasbegun this week, but the farmers arejiow equipped with modern machinery for harvesting the seed, ani itwill not take long to gather the seewhen the weather and other conditions are right.The government is urging the dealers to use their influence to preventfarmers from stripping the seed tooearly next season. The seed shouldripen before being stripped so as toguarantee maximum germination.I The seed in 'most of the fieldsthisyear is low and hard to strip.

Stout, after theyhad presented their first and onlyreport.It will be an unlucky report forsome, as thirteen indictments werereturned, ten for felony cases andthree for misdemeanors. Six of thedefendants under the indictments returned are now In the Paris jail.The regular panel of petitJuror3was excused from further service, asno cases had been assigned for immediate trial. Most of the members.of the jury were farmers, and theirpresence was urgently needed athome to carry on their work.

The banks ofBourbon county are conducted anddirected by patriotic men. They realize, with the President, that theloan should be popularized to an evengreater extent than at present, andxhat this can be done by letting theman in position to invest a smallamount only take a bond or two. Itstimulates interest in the welfare ofthe Nation it makes a man feel as.nothing else can that he is a partner, of Uncle Sam, and that whatever hap--pensto the firm affects him as much- as anyone else in the world.

Our people, webelieve, are going to supply the sum,and with a little urging, it is possible that the offering may exceedthat amount.There has been some question aboutthe obligations of the Red Cross andits particular field of work. If theRed Cross is to be the recognized organization through which this workmust be carried on, it must work inmany fields, in many ways.One great trouble with our peopleto-day is that they do not realize thesituation throughout the countries atwar. They must be made to realizethem, and the obligation upon us isto see that it is done as soon as possible. The Red Cross is doing a noblework. It is an obligation upon everyman, woman and child in this country. We hope that it will be sufficiently realized -that we shall notonly enjoy the satisfaction of contributing our energies and ourmoney, we will also thereby havereceived a very great benefit.All this week the good women ofParis and Bourbon county have beenengaged in a house-to-house canvassin the interest of the Red Crosswork, and if they have met with a refusal in atfy instance they have beentoo charitable to mention it. Thecampaign will come to a close toaorrow night, and it is the earnesthope of THE NEWS that when theroll is called and the contributionstotaled, it will be found that thecounty of Bourbon have not beenlaggard, and that she has upheld herreputation for generosity.The campaign has been progressing very satisfactorily in the county.A number of Paris merchants haveleft their business in the hands ofsubordinates while they toured thecounty precincts urging the importance of men of large means comingto the front with individual contributions of large sums.irP3 53 paPYTHIAN SISTERHOOD.-, The ceremonies of instituting anauxiliary of the Pythian Sisterhood.a branch of the Knights of Pythias,will be conducted at the K. of P.Castle Hall, in the Wilson Buildingat the corner of Third and Mainstreets, at eight o'clock, this (Friday) evening.The installation ceremonies will beconducted by Mrs. Simms and Mrs.Jas.

'. I IPatriotic Americans who have beenhelping the Red Cross have of latebeen making anxious inquiries as towhether the humanity and the neutrality of the Red Cross would constrain itto send food, medicines and hospitalunits to Germany."I want to give to help our boys, andthe stricken people of France and Belgium and Serbia," many a one haswritten in ; "but I don't feel like doinganything if the Germans get part of it"Americans need be under no apprehension. Not a cent of Red Cross contributions Is going to Germany, or hasgone there since the war was declaredby the United States. General Pershing has gone to Europe to convey tothe kaiser Uncle Sam's compliments inthe form of shells and American bayonets, but the Red Cross has no part inthat except to care for such of General Pershing's men as may need care.The matter of sending Red Crosssupplies to Germany was brought upIn the recent Red Cross war council InWashington. Charles D. Norton, oneof the members, answered Inquiriesthus:"The answer is exceedingly simple.We do not purpose to be tried for treason. We do not purpose to lend aidand comfort to our enemies. We meanto attend our own American Red Crossaffairs."Former President Taf t, who Is chairman of the executive committee, supported this view. He said that whenwounded Germans fell Into the handsof the American Red Cross they willget the same treatment as our ownmen; but that it would undoubtedlybe treason to send supplies to Germanyas we did before we were forced Intothe war.So Americans can give freely, knowing that every cent is for our own andour allies' wounded, and not for theenemy.Red Cross Trench Work.Red Cross surgeons and orderliesgive first aid to the wounded In littleunderground dressing stations In thefront line trenches.

It was themost signal honor France ever bestowed upon any man. Before thattime not even a Frenchman ever waspermitted to hold the historic relicsin his hand.

Until Fridaythey Jiad not been touched since thetime of Louis Philippe.General Pershing and his staff wereconducted to the crypt by MarshalJoffre, who followed the precedentlaid down by Napoleon, that only aMarshal of France might remain covered in his presence. The great keywas inserted in the brass door of thecrypt. Marshal Joffre and GeneralNiox, Governor of the Invalides, drewaside while General Pershing forcedthe door alone. He took a deepbreath, stepped suddenly forward andwith a single motion threw his armstraight out and turned the key. Ina tiny alcove at one side of the cryptthe Governor of the Invalides unlocked the case, drew out the sword andraised it to his lips. Then he presented the hilt to General Pershing,who received it, held it at salute fora moment and then kissed the hilt.The same ceremony was followedwith the cross of the cordon of theLegion of Honor, General Pershingholding the cross to his lips beforepassing it back to the Governor.As one of the staff officers saidwhen the ceremony was all over, "Itwas more than a historic moment; itwas epic. General Pershing at thetomb of of Napoleon will live inhistory the same as Washingtonpraying at Valley Forge, and itwould take a Victor Hugo to writeabout it properly."m Pi PiIf some Paris women wore theircorsetsis tighfrsas theirjihoe they'dhave corns on their rib?lif1W HiffiWfREPORT OP THE" RECENT BURLEY MARKET.Supervisors of sales in the variousloose leaf tobacco markets wheresales were held, as well as the Louisville and Cincinnati markets, havefinished compiling statistics from thefigures furnished by the managers ofthe various warehouses.While many of the figures undoubtedly include a large proportionof re-sales, and while perhaps 10per cent, or more of the 1916 cropstill remains unsold, it is quite evident from the statistics at hand thatthe crop last year was considerablyJarger than that of 1915, which wasestimated at 178,648,750 pounds, andlarger also than that of 1914, whichwas estimated at 200,379,200 pounds.In this section Lexington heads thelist in number of pounds sold, witnMaysville second.

New York cityhas promptly pledged Itself to "raiseone-fourth of whatever sum Is needed,"and is now collecting the money. Chicago will be asked for something between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000, thelevy based on population and creditratine.Mr. O. B. Towne has been appointedby Washington as director of the RedCross war fund campaign, for the eentral division, and will open a drivefor the money in nine states as soonas it has been determined just howmuch he needs.The money will be raised by subscription among the various dlapte,and it has been arranged that eachchapter shall have one-fourth of whatever sum it raises. Mr. Towne hopesthat the country will raise enough togive the national organization its full$100,000,000 over and above what thechapters retain.The Red Cross is compelled to raiseIts fund from the people because it hasso small an endowment fund less than$2,000,000 while Japan, for Instance,has more than $13,000,000 in her fund,the Income from which pays all expenses. The money is necessary to keep upthe supplies and equipment of the basehospitals, and for relief work In war.Yankee Ingenuity.In all of the American Red Crosshospitals and American ambulance stations in France are to be found ingenious contrivances to save the livesand limbs of badly maimed soldiers.One such apparatus, apparently a tangle of weights and pulleys and rubberbands, holds up the legs of a patientwhose lower limbs have been brokenin three or four places by shell explosion, and prevents the bones fromgrowing together improperly. Another,which looks like a mass of small rubber drain pipes suspended from a bag,irrigates deep wounds which have become Infected and which must be constantly drained and cleaned with anantiseptic solution if the patient's lifeis to be saved.EVERY MAN ON HIS JOB.Every man's duty is the same.Your job is your duty. My job Ismine. Each of us can do his partmost effectively by redoubling present endeavors at whatever his regular occupation may be.If we are railroading, let us railroad for all we are worth. If weare farmers, put the same speed inour farming. If we are mining, letus mine as never before. Let us dothe same with making shoes, makingclothes, building houses, buildingfactories, warehouses, skyscrapers,roads or whatever it may be .There need be no curtailment inbuilding and road construction. Letboth public and private useful construction proceed. Production andhandling-of building materials andpublic and private construction workare fundamental industries of thecountry. Any tendency to suspendor postpone projects is inconsistentwith maintaining our prosperity.The country is prosperous. Buildinginvestors should not hesitate to goahead with their plans. Railroadsshould spare no effort to supply thebuilding industry with the cars needed to transport materials. Government, State, county and municipalauthorities should encourage the continuance of all kinds of building.Road and street improvements inparticular should go unabated. Badroads and streets are factors of firstimportance in the present high costof foodstuffs. Never before was theimprovement of highways so essential. The lumber, brick, cement, lime,sand, gravel, stone and other building material industries are- basis.Neither Government regulations norrailroad restrictions should be imposed unnecessarily to interfere withthem. If any action is taken whichresults in the prostration of so fundamentally important industries,there is a real danger of a surplus ofunemployed labor, a surplus of railroad cars and a crippling of businessthat will seriously embarrass theGovernment in financing the war.Keep on building!to fe PiNEVER NEGLECT A COLD .A chill after bathing, cooling offsuddenly after 'exercise and drafts,give the cold germs a foot-hold thatmay lead to something worse.
