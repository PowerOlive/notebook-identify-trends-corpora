He lefthome with the consent of both parents, and kept in regular communication with them, writing homeevery day. He was accomplished byEugene Wise, of Carlisle, a studentat Vanderbilt University, at Nashville, Tenn. He wrote home fromParkersburg, W. Va., that he hadnot received all of his salary) andwould go to Pennsboro with theshow to play a fair date. So I,thinking he did not have sufficientmeans of returning home, asked Patrolman Lusk, of Paris, to assist mein getting him to the wire in Pennsboro, as I could not locate him in acity without aid.

Often themountaineer carries his troubles tochurch and generally is the first to"bite the dust.Settling scores with the preacherwhen he is conducting services usually has been iatal to the aggressors,and in this respect such tragediesappear to run true to form. Themountain preacher seems well ableto take care of himself, particularlywhen he is accosted in the line ofhis calling as the spiritual leader -ofhis flock. In nearly every instancein the long list of such tragedies hehas got his man and sometimes several of them who essayed to breakup the meeting and take the preacher to task for some real or fanciedgrievance.Not long ago in a mountain county a preacher who could shoot aswell as propound the gospel dropped three assailants who had takenoffense at something he said and accosted him while he was in the pulpit. Instances are few where themountain preacher under such circumstances has quailed or shown thewhite feather, but, on the contrary,he nearly always has had the nerveto stand his ground fearlessly andmaintain his rights.Seeking vengeance at church longhas been a mountain failing.oBANNING PISTOLSThe American Bar Association atits meeting in San Francisco recommends that the manufacture of pistols and pistol ammunition, exceptfor official use, be prohibited. NThe Committee on Law Enforcement declares that 90 per cent ofthe homicides .in the .United Statesare committed with pistols, and thenumber reported is around eightthousand a year.The average law-abiding, peacable citizen has no use whatever fora "gun" except as a protectionagainst housebreakers who may beequipped with pistols and preparedto shoot on slightest provocation.If the manufacture of a weapon,which is, in reality, a military andpolice arm, could be effectively prevented by law it would be almostdesirable.The pistol, easily concealed, instantly available, and deadly atshort range is the handy tool of theburglar and the highwayman, andwithout it the bandit would be almost as helpless as a street carwithout a trolly.If all the pistols now in circulation could be gathered up, and thefactories placed under strict government supervision, some of theeight thousand victims of homicidalfury who are sacrificed every yearwould no doubt escape a violentdeath.CORNSLift Off with Fingers- ASPIRINInsist pn Bayer Package1 irarUnless you see the name 'Bayer"on nackaee or on tablets you are notfretting the genuine Bayer productprescribed by physicians over twenty-twoyears and proved safo byBillions for" Colds HeadacheToothacheEaracheNeuralgiaAccept onlywhich containsLumbagoRheumatismPain, Pain."Bayer" packageproper directions.Handy boxes of twelve tablets costfew cents.

A. Scroggs, an eminent economist. Mr. Scroggswrites as follows:"The American citizen's day begins when he is aroused by analarm clock, and the new tariff billraises the duty on this article 67per cent. His first act is to throwoff the bed-covering, on which theduty is advanced 133 per cent, anddons a summer bathrobe, with theduty up 60 per cent, and slippers,with the duty increased 33 per cent."He walks over a Brussels carpet (duty up 100 per cent) to closethe window, the duty on the pane ofwhich has been raised 33 per cent,and adjust the shade (duty up 20per cent) and curtains (up 50 percent.) Then he enters the bathroom, stands before a mirror, onwhich the duty has been raised 100per cent, sets out his shaving-stick,subject to an increase in duty of 67per cent, his shaving brush (dutyup 30 per cent) and razor (up 100per cent) and begins his tonsorialoperations. This over, he devoteshis attention to the bathtub, onwhich the duty has been raised 100per cent. Towels (with the dutyup 60 per cent), soap (up 67 percent), tooth brush and hairbrush(up 30 per cent) and comb (up 67per cent) are next in demand."As our consumer dresses, it maybe noted that the new bill increasesthe duty 60 per cent on his underwear, 33 per cent on his hose, 15 percent on his shirt and collar, 20 percent or more on his necktie, and 60per cent on his suit" of clothes."Our consumer 'decides to discardhis waistcoat and transfers fountain pen (up 100 per cent), penknife (up 200 per cent) and leadpencil (up 80 per cent), from waistcoat to coat pockets, picks up a freshlinen handkerchief (up 30 per cent)from the dresser (up 133 per cent),and polishes his eyeglasses (up 15per cent), and after giving hisclothes a touch with a brush (up 57per cent), is ready for 'breakfast."At the breakfast table our consumer spreads a napkin (duty up15 per cent) on his knees, and turnson the current for the electric toaster, on which the duty has been advanced 160 per cent. He drinkswater from a glass on which theduty is 45 per cent higher, and begins his breakfast with an apple(duty up 200 per cent) baked withsugar .(duty up 84 per cent) in analuminum dish (up 150 per cent),on a cast-iron stove (duty up 100per cent.)"The duty is also advanced 27 percent on his chinaware, 20 per centon his silverware, 200 per cent onhis oatmeal, and 225 per cent onhis butter. The cream lor his coffeehas been removed from the free listand subjected to a duty of 22cents a gallon, and his eggs alsohave been taken from the free listand made dutiable at 8 cents perdozen. The salt for his eggs likewise comes off the free list, and sodoes his bacon and the flour thatgoes into his bread. Even the dutyon the salt-shaker gets a boost of 45per cent."The only things on his tablethat have not been subjected to ahigher tariff duty are his coffee anddrinking water."oBURLEY POOL MAKES SALE OPTOBACCOMEXI6AN ONYX FOUND IN HARTCOUNTY- -- 4 .

Richardson, head of the-depart-mentof mineralogy, Syracuse University, Syracuse, JN. Y.The Mexican onyx, in those counties, Dr. Richardson said, is susceptible .to a high polish, is beautifullybanded, delicate in colors, of a finegrain and highly translucent. Mexican onyx is one of the most highlyprized interior decorative marbles.Plans are under way in thosecounties now, the geologist said, forquarrying the onyx and putting iton the market.Dr. Richardson also proved for thefirst time that many of the stalactities and stalamites in MammothCave and other caves in that vicinity are Mexican onyx, as are numerous pillars and columns in the cavAnother discovery made by thescientist on his recent trip to thatsection of the State is that there isevidence in the Mammoth Onyx Cavein Hart county, which was justopened to the public June 30, 1922,that it was discovered before Mammoth Cave. Mammoth Onyx Cave,however, has been little known tothe public until recently.The evidence is the name of Martha A. Woodson and the date 1800,which are carved on a wall of thecave. It has been established thatsuch a person lived near there aboutthat time. The reported discoveryof Mammoth 'Cave was in 1802.The entire cave region in whichMammoth. Cave is located, Dr. Richardson stated, is honeycombed withcaves and h.e said it is reasonable tosuppose that all caves about thelevel of the Green River containdeposits of Mexican onyx.oADDING MACHINE EOLIS CHEAPBrownie Wll V u s s all Dealer IIHI :A dollar's WQtth that IIN is a dollar's worth H1 The "Brownie" a genuine Gillette Ia and 3 fine Gillette blades.I Giving the genuine Gillette shave.

The fact that few reports have been received on damagedone by the fly during the past yearis no indication that the State'swheat crop will be free from the ravages of the insect this year, he jpointed out."The conditions of Kentucky'swheat crop has been improved materially from year to year becausemany farmers have adopted thepractice of sowing their seed afterthe dates on which the flies havedisappeared. However, the insectwill continue to present a seriousproblem to the grain growers of the: State until every farmer adopts theI practice of sowing after the fly-free.dates.
