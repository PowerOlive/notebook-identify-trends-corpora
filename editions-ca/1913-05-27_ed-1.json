TOM THUM WEDDING
Will
Be the Interesting Event of the
Week.
"Tom Thum Wedding"to be given at
the Grand i Opera House on Friday
evening, May 30, promises to be the
most interesting event in the annals
of home talent theatricals in this city.
The performance will be given for the
benefit of the Presbyterian church,
and success is sure to crown the ef
forts of those engaged in rehearsing
the large number that will participate.
Upwards of seventy-five children
will take part in the performance. It
was the original intention to present
the pretty little play in the Presby
terian church but owing to the limited
amount of space and from the fact a
large number of children are required
it was arranged to secure the opera
house for Friday night.
The performance will begin at 8
o'clock and the admission will be 50
cents for adults and 25 cents for
children.
Paris and Maysville to Play.
On Thursday, May 29th, a game will
be played at White Park between
the Western High School boys and the
Maysville High School team. This is
Maysville's first game with our boys
and every effort will be made to de
feat the visitors.
We are anxious that all come out
and encourage the home team, as
they have incured some expense that
they have incurred some expense that
base ball and other athletic sports.
Our boys are scheduled to play
only two more games, including the
Maysville game, on the home grounds.

To Prohibit the Parlor-Match.
The campaign the fire protection in
terests have been making against the
incendiary match now promises to de
velop into the effective stage. A great
deal of public sentiment against the '
parlor match has been worked up, with
the thousand of distressing fatalities
and the'millions of losses for which
its flying heads are responsible. The
big match manufacturers have seen
the rising tide of sentiment and are
now ready to cooperate in enforcing
reasonable restrictions to reduce the
hazards of their product. Bills for
bidding the use of the parlor matches
were introduced in several' states this
year. They were defeated as imprac
ticable in some of their details, but in
their place a new measure has been
introduced which lias been endorsed
by the sponsors of original legislation.
The bill will not be opposed by t"he
match manufacturers in general, al
though it materially increases their
costs, since they recognize the justice
of the charges made against the haz
ardous match.
The new measure positively prohib
its the manufacture, storage,sale and
distribution of white phosphorus sin
gle dipped strike anywhere matches of
the type generally known as the parlor
match. It also prohibits the use of all
types ' of matches which will ignite
when stepped upon or will shoot off
burning particles, the measure pre
scribing the degree of tenacity the
heads must maintain to prevent this
feature which has been responsible
for the bulk of the match fires.
The bill in addition to outlawing the
parlor match, p'revents the marketing
of defectve goods in boxes not plain
ly marked as such, which will put an
end to the. common practice of manu
facturers of selling defective matches
in job lots to the cheap retail tra'de.
The bill also regulates the packing
and storing of matches, together with
the 'number of matches in a box and
the number of boxes in a case, as
well as the size and material of the
packing cases, in these regards com
plying the regulation made by the In
terstate Commerce Commission and
the Bureau for the transportation of
Explosives. The measure also cor
responds with the city ordinance pre
pared by H. C. Henley,of the St. Louis
Fire Prevention Bureau, which regu-
4 lates the sale and storage ofmatches
from the municipal standpoint.
Tobacco Men to Meet.
The 13th annual convention of the
Tobacco Association of the United
States will be held at Richmond, Va.,
June 5, 6 and 7th, at the Jefferson Ho
tel, where special rates for the occa
sion have been secured.
The Richmond Tobacco Trade, with
the city of Richmond and the Cham
ber of Commerce, will be the host, and
the committees have arranged an at
tractive program, the chief features of
which will be asm oker a the Jefferson
Auditorium, and an all day trip down
James River to Jamestown.
Several distinguished speakers will
presentt matters of interest to the
trade.
All tobacco men, including leaf deal
ers, warehousemen, manufacturers and
agents for manufacturers and export
ers, are urged to attend this great
meeting.
Tobacco men will be present from
every section of the United States, as
well as from some of the foreign coun
tries. The President of the Association is
Mr. T. M. Carrington,, of Richmond
Va., and the Secretary and Treasurer
Is G. E. Webb, of Winston-Salem, N.
C, either of whom will give any de
sired information as tothe convention
and the important work of the associa
tion. It is certainly a good investment for
any tobacco man, to send his name to
the Secretary and join the association,
and if possible, go to Richmond.
