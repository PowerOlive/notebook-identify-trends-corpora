of the Cubansand the advantage of their positionIn his report known at Manzanillothough probably it will not be published in Havana he says that hisAColumn was only 1500 men strong and heestimates the Cubans at over 3000The Spanish dead he says were 00and he adds that notwithstandinghewas obliged to retire the losses of theinsurgents were severeThe battle turned against the Spaniards when Gen Vara

Spanish soldier deserted All who did notreach Manzanillo were left killed orwounded on the fieldThe battle was directed by GenCalixto Garcia in person though thegreat success he obtained was in

town butwithout the aid of the fleets they couldmake but a feeble defense against theoverwhelming numbers in the insurgents The greatest activity is beingdisplayed in Athens in making preparations to give battle to theTurks should they cross theGreek frontier The ministry of warpresents a most animated scene Officers in uniform throng the corridorsand orderlies are constantly being dispatched in every direction with ordersto different commanders The telegraph wires are constantly busy withdispatches to officers in distant placesThe most energetic measures are beingtaken for the mobilization of forcesThere is a similar scene of activityin the ministry of marine whereeverything possible is being done toplace the fleet in readiness for anycontingencyThere is no sign any where of theking or government receding from theposition they have taken and it isominous that in the face of the threatof combined Europe the warlikepreparations are being carried on withfeverish activity The most intenseenthusiasm is everywhere displayedand the people evince no fear of theresult of an appeal to arms Theyknow full well that the Greek army byitself is no match for the numericallysuperior Turkish forces but they alsoknow that in the event of war thewhole of southern Europe wouldoe set on fire It is this thatthe powers wish to prevent ifthey attempt to use force to compelGreece to accede to their demandsThere is a very strong probability thatGreece will apply a torch that willstart a conflagration the result ofwhich no one can foretell It is believed here that the powers seeing thechance of their becoming involved in ageneral war will owing to their conflicting interests make haste slowly inattempting to force the Greeks to withdraw their support from the CretanChristiansIt has been decided that there shallbe a general mobilization of Greeksand to this end the two classes of reserves that had not been summonedpreviously have been calledThe reserve forces alone give a totalof 104500 men and behind this is whatis called the territorial army whichnumbers upward of 146000 men notby any means an insignificant forceThe standing army numbers about 25000 men of all armsAmmunition

bottomless but soundings haveshown its greatest depth to be 2000 feet lIt is five miles in diameter nearly circular and occupies the crater of anextinct volcano No fish have ever beenknown to exist in Crater lake Recentlya club of mountain climbers with headquarters at Portland sent to Washington a request that Crater lake bestocked with trout and the government2xperts are going to find out if such ascheme is practicable It is easyenough to put trout into the water buithe question is if there is sufficientfood in the water to nourish them afterthey are there The experts will towsmall gauze nets over the water at aljhours of the day Animalculae willcatch in the gauze and from its abundance or lack it can be ascertained if thewater contains nourishmentAn interesting series of experimentEwill also be undertaken to ascertain thetemperature of the water at variousdepths No such observations have everDeen taken of fresh water so far downriWith this end m view a full equipmentof self

western hemisphereapproaches thisIt is no wonder then that Craterlake was supposed to be bottomlessHowever the truth is that all lakes over150 feet deep possess a similar reputation Any body of water that is deeperthan the length of the longest feelingline is sure to lack a bottom in thepopular belief A first rate example olthis sort of delusion is afforded byLafayette lake in Idaho It wasformerly imagined to be bottomlessand later its depth was officially statedto be 2600 feet Recent investigationproves that its greatest depth is 305 feetThere is no data on which to base aguess as to the

historyof the ranch Two or three times theherders found it necessary to drive thecattle several miles to water but thegrass near the ranch house was largestbecause through the earlier part of

gladof a respite and enjoying the brisk canter to which he spurred his willingponyNor did he lessen his pace on his return llacing swiftly along he approached Paul and the herd carryingthe can of water and thrilled by theexercise of the half mile rideAs he drew near the pony braced itselffor the sudden stopping but beforethe halt came there was an accidentInto one of the numerous gopher holeswhich dot the ircrirtes of the westwent one of his horses forefeetIn an instant Theo was hurled headlpng from the deep seated saddle andwent as did the pony rolling on thesod The wafer can broke as it fell andthe clink of its smashing could be heardfor a long wayPaid heard it and pressing- the spurto his ponys flank hurried toward thevictims of the mishap But that wasnot all Before Theo and his horsehad regained their feet each bruisedand limping every grazing steer hadlifted its branching horned head andwas staring at the unwonted spectacleThen as if moved by a common impulse every animal took a few stepsawav A loud bellow from some of themore powerful ones followed and thewalk of the herd became a trot Thealarm increased as they moved thetrot wras a canter the canter a runand

of what wasbefore blind to any danger to all intents an unreasoning insane mobThe herd was headed toward theranch house and would go near it thenon across the path leading to the schoolIt all passed through Pauls mind in aninstant and mingling with the thoughtof injury to the cattle was that of danger to the school children or theirteacher The ranch house hid his viewof the familiar path at first but as hepushed ahead in a frantic hope of beingable to turn the leaders on whom hewas rapidly gaining it was fully revealedMidwayf between house and schooldirectly in the course of the now infuriated beasts was a group the verysight of which thrilled the hurryingrideir In its midst was a woman carrying a yellow parasol and around herwere some little folks not many butto Pauls alarmed gaze it seemed a multitudeAunt Serena and her tiny party of teaguests had just become aware of whatwas occurring a half mile away Theycould hear and almost feel the thoureands of heavy hoofs beating on the dryprairie The shouting cowboys thebellowing steers the dust it was all afrightful menace Uncefrtain which wayto turn and deeming it impossible toescape from tQie wide sweep on whielithe cattle were

but a littleout of the herds course Theo saw itas he stood helpless beside his lamedpony and wondeired The other herders saw it and yelled frantically to himto return But Paul heeded them notLike a flash into his mind had come thewords of an old cattleman who hadgiven him advice in the art of managing a herdYeh km do more with a bunch of vcattle by their likes than their dislikeshad been a part of his philosophy anI spect theyre a good bit like humansin thatAlready Paul was near the ranchhouse and the anrious watchers sawhim stop his horse with a severitywhich nearly brought the faithful creature to its knees dismount dash inthrough the open door reappear withsomething in his arms leap to the saddle and race pellmell fast as the ponysfeet could carry him toward the headof the herd againThe cattle were running no fasterthan at the start but neither had thecowboys efforts been able to checkthem Moreover the angry eyes ofthe leaders appeared to have been fascinated by the yellow parasol whichshone brightly in the sunlight andwere taking their way followed by thewhole frantic mass directly toward itIn ithe air was an odor of bruised hornsand in the track of the herd was morethan one struggling beast which hadfallen in the race and been trampledunto death by its companionsBut Paul was well in advance of eventhe foremost and a gap of n7y rodsintervened between even hizftefaf andthe school partyGit Prince Git he was sayingas he leaned low on his ponys neck andpressed the spurs harder and harderon the steaming flanksThen suddenly the watchers saw Paulturn sharply and ride directly in frontof the oncoming herd scarce a dozenyards awayBut they saw something more Ashe rode a fine white stream pouredfrom his saddlebow and a flour liketrail was left behind him

conclusion of the sentenceHis quick mind had solved the problemand above the roar the chief caught thesingle word SaltBefore the first of the cattle hadreached the white line Paul was acrossthe herds track and was trimming tocome back further on But it was unnecessary As the first rank reachedthe seemingly slight barrier a familiarand appetizing odor reached the distended nostrils Forgetting their impatience the strong beeves slackenedtheir pace The crowding hundredsbehind pushed them forward but thesetoo caught the scent and in a momentthe whole herd was hooking and striving for a taste of the

J H Merrill in a paper readbefore the Albany institute says thatthe question of good roads in this country is now at about the same stage atwhiehit was in England a century agoAt that lime roads were so had that ageneral investigation was undertakenresulting in the formulation of certainrules for road building whose adoptionled to the construction of the fine highways for which Great Britain has solong been famous The problem wasthen of great commercial importanceas England had no railroadsThe experience of over 2000 years hasshown conclusively that there are twoessential points to be aimed at in theconstruction of a road First a hardsmooth Avaterproof surface second athoroughly dry foundation Theseprinciples were known to the Uomans300 years B CX The surface of a goodxoad may be of sufficient strength toresist -the wear and tear of traffic andtmooth enough to prevent underwear onvehicles In connection with this thesoil beneath must be made dry and keptdry Thereforethe subject of read drainage is as important as that of roadmetaling The best road covering iscomposed of angular fragments of somestone Which will grind on the surfaceinto a dust which when wet will bindor in a measure cement the fragmentstogether so that wrater will not penetrate The angular form is essential tomake the fragments interlock Thesizes should be quite uniform exceptthat the surface layer may consist ofsmaller fragments than the bottomcourse The total thickness of thismetaling must be at least six incheson a natural soil foundation Tlie fragments should not exceed 2 inches indiameter and should be rolled in twoseparate courses with a heavy steamroller until the surface is absolutelyfirmFARM TELEPHONEGood Results Can Be Obtained at anExpense of a Few CentsFor a cheap short distance

PoultryWhen one has a good deal of poultryto dress yearly it will be found of advantage to have a room for that purpose A lean to to the henhouse willnaturally be most convenient If this isfurnished with a skylight all the better It should be light and large enoughto give sufficient room for a stove towarm the room as well as to keep thewater hot for scalding or other purposes floor should be smooth andtight A scantling should be putacross the room at a convenient heightwith a few spikes driven in on which tohang the birds while dressinger scantling or two along the sides tohang up -the dressed poultry to let cooliand to wash heads and mouthsHow to Care for PlantsTo keep plants free from insects oneof the best remedies is tobacco Take ajsmall package of strong tobacco andrpour over it boiling water When coolthe plants should be set into the mixture and washed leaves and all besidesibeing thoroughly soaked with it Another remedy is a strong soapsuds madeof carbolic soap and water Plantson ust be kept clean if they are to behealthy The leaves should be washed-occasionally in order that the dust maylie removed The leaves are the lungscf the plants and of course they cannot perform their work correctly ifpores are obstructed by dust Earmamd HomeA Plaee for tflie CalvesThe best plaee for the calves is a boxstall dn the barn- Have the stanchionsplaced in one side of rbhe

Hutt the experimentingHorticulturist of the institution gavea report on the results of the recentexperiments with strawberries grownon the college grounds He has observed an extra gtowth of plants asa result of the careful removal of theblossoms the first season This onlyconfirms our old experience that in order to secure the heaviest crop the second year which is the main and usually the only fruiting year as strawberries are handled by good growers webave to adopt the practice of preventingall fruit setting the same season thatthe bed is established Then in orderto have a full crop we must have fullmatted rows With varieties that aregood plant makers like Wilson Crescent Haverland Bubach Warfield etcwe have no difficulty in securing the fullstand of plants in an average fair season even if in starting the bed we putthe plants two feet apart This is thedistance which Prof Hutt recommendsfor planting such sorts while IS inchesis as much as poor plant makers shouldbe spread apart in the row at the startJNext for a heavy yield we want theheavy yield er Among them Warfieldwas found to be at the head Afton ismuch like it Warfield has a goodleafand a very firm berry Haverland

uowering sortsthose named all being pistillatesSaunders was found first in productiveness and vigor Hutt prefers togrow the imperfect aiid perfect bloomers in alternate rows in order to insurefull fruit setting and therefore bestyield The question is what varietiesto plant together Haverland was thefirst to show bloom Van Deman aperfect flowering sort is also an earlybloomer and might be used to furnishpollen for the other Lovetts Earlyaud Gandy bloom soon after these andin a pinch might be used for the samepurpose Haverland and Warfield areamong the earliest to give ripe fruitliio stands

remember thefollowing printed February 6 1897 bythe L A W Bulletin official organ ofthe League of American WheelmenWe often hear about porous tires butnever without a feeling that somebody maybe mistaken The fact that air comes throughthe outer surface of a tire in numerous placsis by no means conclusive evidence that thereis more than one leak in theinner tube Although tires are classified as inner tube andhosepipe the idea conveyed to the mind of anovice is erroneous since all tires have innertubes the principle difference being thatin tne hosepipe tire the inner tube is vulcanized fast to the outer part of the tire Inthe case of a tire in which thp inner tube isseparate called the iner tube tire the inneror air tube may be taken out an immersed inwater while it contains just enough air pressure to stretch it slightly above its naturalsize If it contains any holes however smallthe air will rise through the water io smallbubbles and if such a tube is found to beporous while it is yet new it should be returned to the manufacturer This howeverwill be extremely rare as the method usuallyemployed prevents such resultsIf numerous bubbles rise from differentparts of a hosepipe tire at the same time andwe believe it is this form of tire that is mostoften accused of being porous the chancesare thttheairis leaking through one holein the inner tube and that it divides intonumerous channels before it reaches the surfaceThe threads of which all tires are mademay and often do act as minute tubeswhich con vej air from some leak at the inside and let it escape at one or more openningssome times quite a distancefrom theactual punctureGreat care should be taken in plugging ahosepipe tire to prevent any fibre of the canvas from forming a connection between theinside of the air tube and the main part ofcanvas The cut shows in an exaggeratedfashion the manner in which air frequentlyfinds its way to the outside through thethreadsAfter any tire has been used for some timethe outer rubber which comes in direct contact with the road will receive many littlecuts or punctures which extend only fromthe surrace in to the first layer of canvas andit is through these susface punctures that theair escapes even though sometimes it mayfirst follow the canvas for several inchesInstances have been known where theactual leak in the inner tube was on theopposite side of the tire from the point wherethe leak appears to beThere are some American riders whodo not know that the cycling public ofEurope after long experience long agoadopted double -tube tires as the onlysatisfactory ones Any American riderwho knows what a nuisance porous tireare will back up this experience Whilein America the Morgan Wrightdouble tube tire is sold at a very reasonable price and under a liberal guarantee its construction is patented sothat other tire makers have tried toforce into favor single tube tires whichfailed in EuropeYear after year these single tube makers bring out a new idea for successfullystopping leaks and repairing puncturesand year after year they fail and theman who buys generally pays dearly forthe experienceIn the Morgan Wright constructionthe porosity is avoided and when oneof these tires is punctured the repair ispermanent Inside of the inner tubelies a strip of rubber called the quickrepair strip To repair a puncturesimply inject some M W quick-repaircement inside the inner tube pressdown and pump up See that the tireis pumped up however while thecement is being injected so that thecement will get into the inner tubeRiders who use M W tires no follow this simple instruction when thetires puncture will save V emselve anddealers from the trout e8 of porosityand imperfect repairsChange Of Time tThe Queen Crescent changes timeSunday

substance such as a seed being found inthe appendix This will be more fullyrealized when one has in mind that theinterior of the appendix is only bigenough to admit a medium sized darning needle Its great liability to diseaseis due entirely to its low order of vitalresistance that is it is an organ whichappears to have no actual use in thepresent machinery of man but in theearlier stages of mans development itis believed td have been a large pouchthat played an important part in thedigestive operations of the human system By ages of disuse it has graduallyshrunk to its present dimensions and isknown to science as a vestigial organone which is only a remnant of itsformer self and possessing but a vestige jof its original functions- This becomes more clear if some otherparts of the body which now seem tohave no nse are considered Thetonsilsare in this class and also the wisdomteeth and both are peculiarly subject todisease vThe appendix is in one of the mostdelicate and vital parts of the body inthe peritoneal cavity usually to theright of the center of the abdomenBut in rare instances it has been foundon the left side and stilly more- rarelyotherwise displaced This discoverymade very recently has caused the surgeons to be extremely careful to locatethe trdublo before using the knifeBut science never stands stilly - It always pushes its investigations -beyondmere appearances and out of the myteries of nature develops facts which giveit power and might When itrwas onceproved that the poison which prpducedseptic peritonitis came from thebreaking down or decay of the appendixthe very root of one of mans worstphysical foes was laid bare Furtherpractice established beyond a doubt thatin a large majority of cases the appendix could be removed by a simple surgical operation and the patient restoredto vigorous health if the disease vyasdiscovered in time and correctly diagnosedThe surgeons now regard thel operation itself as one of the most simplebut to obtain the best results it shouldtake place within a few hours after thepatient begins to suffer from the diseaseIn fact the sooner the operation is hadthe better are the chances of recoverywhile if the knife is not resorted todeath is sure to ensue very promptly orafter lingering miseries from the deadlypoison perambulating through the system and coming to the surface- in abscesses fThe symptoms are so plain and unmistakable to the surgeon of today thatany sufferer may know them for himselfFirst The attack is alwayssuddenIt comes on when the person is apparently in the best of health and withoutthe slightest warningSecond A sharp pain is felt in thevery center of the abdomen This is always the case whether the appendix bein its correct place on the right side ordisplaced to the leftThird A sore and tender spot verypainful to the touch is looated exactlywhere the incision must be made to findthe appendixThese are the three plain symptomswhich have been found in thousands ofcases with scarcely a variationThus it is that many sudden deathsoccur to persons in robust health Theyare thought to have a colic or a vertigowhen the truth is that miserable anduseless little organ the appendix hasmet with some kind of an accident andclogs the whole machineAppendicitis usually occurs betweenthe ages of 10 and 80 years It is extremely rare above or below thoseagesIt is much more frequent amoncr malesthan females the proportion in allcountries being 20 per cent - females to80 per cent malesThe cause for this difference is ofvery recent discovery and is not evenknown - generally among the medicalprofession Dr Clado a French surgeonRnd irfvestigator sought an explanationof the comparative immunity of tie female sesNom the malady and discovered that the appendix in
