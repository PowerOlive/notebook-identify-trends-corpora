"Sue Munday" wasa member of One-armed Sam Berry'sband of guerrillas, which operated agood deal in that county duringthe Civil War. He was a superbhorseman, and a very handsomeyoung fellow, and wore curls thatdangled to his shoulders, and thiscaused the report to be spreadabroad, which many people believed,that Berry had a woman among hismen. On October 8, 1863, Berry, whowas a native of that county andattended school in Harrodsburg, afterward becoming a well-known schoolteacher, made a raid on the bank inHarrodsburg. He was (accompaniedby "Sue Munday," Henry McGruder,Lieutenant Milton, pick Little andB5g Zay" Poulter. On the way totown they held up the stage at thewatering trough near Shakertown,and there compelled a Union soldier,a brother of the late George W. Robinson, to abcompany them there.They held the town in terror for anhour or more, and then the citizensbegan firing at them, and the bandgalloped their horses out Perryvillestreet, Robinson being still withthem. As they turned out the streea jeweler named Comstock fired atSue Munday and killed his horse.Quick as a flash Clark turned andshot Robinson, the Union soldier, andjumped upon his horse as he fellfrom the saddle. Later the men werecaptured and tried by the Federal authorities. Sam Berry was sentencedto Sing Sing, and died there July 4,1866. Sue Munday and Henry McGruder were hanged in Louisville,a"nd the former's body was takento Simpson County, his home, for interment, where it has lain in the little graveyard all these years untillast Saturday. Big Zay Poulter waskilled in Spencer County near the endof the war, and Dick Little went toMississippi, was elected Sheriff, andwas killed in a riot:iCORN SELLING FOR $5 BARREL.Although the threatened war inEurope has yet had no appreciableeffect on the prices of farm productsin Central Kentucky, corn is $5 a barrel, the highest price known in twenty years.

While in this immediate vicinity and in other sections of theBluegrass regon there have beengood rains .during the past few weeks,these rains be no menas general, andin many sections of this and adjoining counties there has been little orno rain for more than a month, andthe corn arid tobacco crops thereatento be almost a complete failure.HEALTH OFFICERS' REPORTINCREASE IN PELLAGRA CASES.Reports from health officers inwidely scattered sections of the State1 indicate a large increase in the num-oer or cases ot Pellagra.

That he shouldhave the most intense personal griefadded to the mounting cares of Statewhen a world conflagration has justbroken forth struck every one at onceas bitterly tragic.Death at this time wears the visageof unwonted tragedy in the WhiteHouse. The Presidency was a calculated ambition with President Wilson,and in the years of preparation hiswife bore a full share. But she waspermitted to enjoy less than a year ofhealth after realizing with her husband a vision of ambition fulfilledwhich had been, theirs 'fjr years.Mrs. Wilson was the third mistressof the White House to die in the historic mansion. Mrs. Tyler, wife ofPresident John Tyre, who died in1842, was the first. Mrs. BenjaminHarrison, the first wife of formerPresident Benjamin Harrison, died atthe White House in September, 1892,while her husband was running for reelection. She had been ailing for along time. 'Six weeks after her death her father, Rev. John Scott, who had livedat the White House with the Harrisons, died there. He was 93 years oldwhen he died.Mrs. Wilson's death was peaceful.The President held her hand as shepassed away. Her three daughtersMrs. Francis Bowes Sayre, Mrs. Wm.G. McAdoo and Miss Margaret Wilsonknelt at her bedside.She had been unconscious for aboutthree hours before the end, but atabout 2 o'clock arsused herself andsmiled faintly at her dear ones. -Shewas too weak to speak to them.Those at the bedside, besides relatives, were the six consulting physicians and the nurses from the NavalHospital.About the middle of the forenoonMrs. Wilson stirred and called for Dr.Grayson."Doctor," she said faintly, "I amVgoing away. I want you to promiseme to take care of Woodrow."And Dr. Grayson promised herfaithfully that he would.Mrs. Wilson was born in Savannah,Ga., in the strenuous Civil War times,and in that city passed her childhoodand early girlhood.To that city on June 24, 1885, shereturned to be married to WoodrowWilson, then a fledgeling law graduatefrom the University of Virginia, butas whose helpmate she was destinedto attain the position of first lady ofthe world.Like her husband, Mrs. Wilson wasthe child of a Presbyterian minister,and also the ganddaughter of one.Her parents were Rev.

The probabilities arethat the most dreaded of mosquitoes,the yellow fever mosquito; originallybred , in water in holes in trees, but ithas so perfectly adapted itself to thehuman family that it has become atrue domestic insect and is practically dependent for its existence uponthe conditions that surround humanhabitations, saysL. O. Howard. Thisadaptation is undoubtedly of very ancient development. The yellow fevermosquito is essentially a town mosquito, and the larvae are found practically exclusively in artificial receptacles in and about houses.It can be said that its larvae arenever found in swamps, in pools, oreven in temporary puddles, even whenthese are in close proximity to houses.In the tropics the large earthen jarsin which drinking water is kept aTethe most frequent and unfailing habitat of the larvae. Rain water barrelsare abundant breeding places. Rainwater tanks, so universally behind thehouses in Southern cities, - are thesource of most abundant supplies ofthese mosquitoes. The larvae are alsofound In sagging gutters containingrain water, in tin cans, in cess pools,In horse troughs, In water-closettanks, in the drain traps of stationarywash-stands, in urns In cemeteries, inpools accumulating under the watertanks, in water pans in the chickenyards, and In the water receptacles ofgrindstones.The observations of scientists indicate that the yellow-fever mosquitobreeds almost always in clear waterand seldom in foul water. These observers always found it in artificial receptacles, except a few times In treeholes near houses, and in one case In astreet gutter. In the last case it isprobable that this larvae came intothe gutter by the emptying of somehousehold vessel. Discarded bottlesand tins about houses are favoritebreeding places.The larvae, when suspended fromthe surface of the water to take inair, hang almost perpendicularly.They are very easily alarmed andthen go quickly to the bottom, wherethey Temain a considerable time without rising to the surface. Whenwater is poured from a receptacle inhabited by these larvae they quicklyseek the 'bottom and their presencemay not be suspected, although thevessel is in constant use. They clingso closely to the bottom that unlessthe jars are rinsed and tipped up soas to empty them completely, whichis -not usually done, nearly all of thelarvae will remain in the jars. Onx TimoThe rain barrel Is a most excellentbreeding place for mosquitoes. If youmust have one, keep it well coveredwith netting or screen, which admitsair but keeps out the mosquitoes.account of this habit they are noteasily disposed of by pouring out thecontents of a barrel.The larvae occur most frequently inclear water in rain-water barrels orin drinking water receptacles inhouses, the water in such receptaclescontains more or less animal matteras well 'as vegetable refuse, and suchprobably is generally the food of thelarvae. The larvae feed at the bottomwhere they mouth over the organicsediment even when the water is verydeep.A knowledge of the egg-layinghabits of the mosquito will make people more careful about leaving receptacles containing water uncovered andunprotected. Normally it appears tobe the custom to lay eggs on the sidesof any place containing water justabove the surface of the water, so thata slight elevation of the water willeubmerge them. They have beenfound upon a leaf floating upon thewater. The eggs are small and blackin color. As has- been stated, they areordinarily laid above the margin ofthe water and here they may remaindry for long periods, hatching whenreached by the water. They developbetter after having been dry for sometime. In fact, it seems that they willpreserve their vitality for six monthsor even longer. Freezing does not destroy the fertility of the eggs. Theduration pf the egg state, when -theeggs are laid upon the water, is about.two days.

Submarines HavRendered Vessels Useless.Paris.- The Petit Parisien has askeda high officer of the French navy hisopinion of the statements of AdmiralSir Percy Scott to the effect that submarines have rendered useless shipsthat float on the surface and have notthe faculty of submersion.After paying a high tribute to theBritish admiral and saying that SirPercy's opinion had to be taken intoconsideration, the officer declared thatfor the moment and for the immediatefuture he could not share Sir Percy'eviews. The submarines at present inuse had, tie said, insufficient speed ascompared with that of battleships. Itwould-be impossible for submersiblesto join big ships in the open eea. Headmitted that the task of submarineswould be easier in confined waters likethe English channel, but their rolewould be aa unprofitable one in theocean or the Mediterranean.Moreover, there was as yet nomeans of communicating with the submarines when they were under water,nor could messages be received fromthem. The officer said: -"We must tryto increase the speed of submersibles,but we .must take care not to regardour battleships as valueless. On thecontrary, we should go ahead with theconstruction of large units."KISS IN DARK IS ONLY $15Hartford City (Ind.) Man Who WasFined Intimates It Was Fleetingand Not Worth It.Hartford City, Ind. A kiss, givenin the dark, and consequently of uncertain aim, is worth only $15 In thiscity, according to C. H. Croninger,Justice of the peace, who fined William Gause that amount for greetingwith a kiss Mrs. Florence Foreman, aticket seller with a carnival company. Gause chose a moment when theelectric lights all over the city wereout of commission. The woman hadGause arrested for assault and battery. He stood trial and made several strong points to prove his inno-cence.It was pointed out that the kiss wasnecessarily very -fleeting as the lightswere out only a moment; that in hishurry it was probable that he failed toreach the particular spot aimed for,and that in the darkmess the womanhad no means of identifying the kisserunless the kissee had previously sampled his kisses.Gause denied the woman's story inovery particular, but the woman saidthere was no doubt that she had beenkissed by some one.

Australia is said tohave a notion that America has itshand out, palm up. To counteractthis impression for the purpose ofencouraging travel between the Antipodes and England, a San Franciscosteamship company is preparing tomake a campaign of enlightenment.Australians are to be given the following information:"Generally speaking, 'tips' in theUnited States should not be more inthe aggregate than in England, although the number of persons whohave to be 'tipped' is fewer."In restaurants or hotel cafes keepto the 10 per cent. rule. Bell boysshould get five possibly ten centsfor a service. The maid at a hotelshould receive a small gratuity sayabout 50 cents a week."Barbers in fashionable hotels expect a ten-cent 'tip,' " the informationadds, "and head elevator boys shouldbe 'tipped' at the rate of 25 cents aweek. Sleeping car porters shouldbe paid about 25 cents a day, althoughif the traveler feels exceedingly prosperous this might be stretched to 50cents."STOPS FLIRTING BY WHISTLEJersey Town's Counsel Objects to Engineers Sounding Love Notes toWives and Sweethearts.Harrison, N.

The town councilhas instructed Peter Goodman, thetown clerk, to request Lackawannaengineers passing through here to discontinue their whistle signal systemto wives and sweethearts.Some of the engineers employ only aseries of toots.

When the whistles shriekthe feminines concerned dash to windows and wave their replies.This performance in the daytime isannoying to many, since none of thetrains in question stop here, andthere is no excuse for the whistling.Homing Pigeons Make Record.Chicago.

It is truethe dam has been built, but the watersupply hasn't been improved, and is.getting shorter all the time. The people are warned to be economical inthe use of water. Promised reliefhasn't materialized. Street s mainsthat 'have been under ground nearlyeleven years have not been replaced"with clean new pipes, and "deadends" continue to furnish their output of dirty water. It is alleged thatthe water supply, while wholesome,may not be pure. There is no water"behind the big dam at Spears' Mill.The City Council has withheld payment of the Water Company's bill,alleging the city is not being suppliedwith pure wholesome water, as should"be done under the contract with theWater Company, and has instructedthe City Attorney to prepare and filesuit against the Water Company.The people want to know: "Who isto blame?"With a first-class electric lightplant in the city, Paris has been placed at the mercy of Lexington and theelements for its light and power.The service in a general way is good,"but it seems that every time it rainsor there is a bit of muggy feather,something goes wrong at the sub-station,and Paris business houses andresidences are temporarily deprivedof light and power. The two motionpicture houses, both of whom arenow absolutely dependent upon theLexington current for their power,re the principal sufferers with thosewho are using electric motors forpower, finishing a close second.

'MiiMiUUiiSLEDGES ARE SWIFTSouth Pole Vehicles Run 15Miles an Hour.Sir Ernest Shackleton's LieutenantExplains Equipment for AntarcticInvasion to Herbert CoreyCan Do Cooking on Side.London, England. "We will get offto a flying start with our motorsledges," said Sir, Ernest Shackletonat the offices of the Imperial Transantarctic expedition. "We do not knowwhat the surface may be on the Wedde'll sea side. But if it is as decentlysmooth as that on the Ross sea sidefrom which all previous parties haveattacked the south pole I can assureyou offhand 400 miles straight awaywith them."Knowing nothing about polar workor motor sledges I had perhaps showna doubt of his mechanical contraptions, says Herbert Corey in ChicagoNews."Talk to Lees," said Shackleton."He is the man in charge of the motorend of the expedition, and knows moreabout them than I do. Hi! Lees."Capt. Orde Lees, R. N., opened thedoor of the outer office, where he hadbeen at work over his drawings andcorrespondence, and I went out to lookover his plans. To our right as weSir Ernest Shackleton.sat on the table was a huge model ofthe Antarctic, so far as it is known,and drawn to scale. Dotted black linesacross the white surface showed theroutes of former expeditions. A bravelittle union jack told where CaptainScott had died."There are to be five motor sledges,"said Lees. "One will have a 55-norse-powerAnzani motor and another a 40Lorse power motor of the samemake. Each is equipped with a dualdrive system. When there is no headwind they will use air propellers, justas are placed upo"h aeroplanes."In seven days' hard driving in Norway these propellers proved thoroughly efficient. They are especially valuable during low temperatures, whenthe snow becomes loose as dry sand,because of the intense cold. When ahead wind or other condition preventsthe use of these propellers a positivedrive will be used. This is a tootheddrum attached to the rear of thesledge, although no weight rests uponit. A system of spring compensationsallows for inequalities of the surface."These sledges with a 30-horse power engine have towed a sledge weighing 400 pounds, with two men up, inaddition to their own load of six menand supplies, at fifteen to twenty milesan hour. But on bad surface the engine power proved insufficient. Therefore the larger motors are now beinginstalled.'"Two other motor tractors, equippedwith positive drive only, have beenmade ready. These will kick alongthrough the snow, towing one or twosledges at low speeds. They aregeared to about eight miles an hour.All have variable gear and frictiondrive. A fifth sledge will be used, butit is as yet a secret."The air propellers are very large, inorder to get the power required, ratherthan the high speed of an aeroplane.On good surfaces the aero-motorsledges have done 22 miles an hourwith three men up, upon a ten percent up grade."If we do 76 miles to 100 miles a daywe will be quite satisfied with theledges," said Lees. "You see, we willhave continually to be scouting ahead,looking for a safe route."When necessary these sledges willbe abandoned, and the man-hauledsledges resorted to, of course. Butnot until necessary. For the explorerswill feel they are abandoning the comforts of home when they say good-byto the motors."Did the boss tell you of the hot cupboard and the steam cooking plant?"asked Lees, with a smile in his blueeye. "It's a Yankee trick that oughtto tickle you folks in the States. Youalways like clever things."The aerotractors are air cooled. Inorder- to keep the carburetor fromfreezing, a hot cupboard has beenbuilt around the heart of the engine.This cupboard has been made so largethat when the camp is made at nightthe perspiration-soaked underclothingof the explorers may be placed in itand thoroughly dried out. No one buta polar worker can imagine the nnm.' tort of this plan. ,HOWS THIS." We ocer One Hundred Dollars Reward'forany case of Catarrh that cannot be cured by Hall's Catarrh Cure.F. J.

This isproved by the number of sick peoplewho are calling upon their druggists,telling of the improvement in theircondition. -All week long they come,from every part of the county, simplyto express their gratitude and thanksfor the seemingly wonderful results.This is very unusual as it is seldom,indeed, that people will take thetrouble to express thanks for a medicine. The results accomplished byBrown's Native Herbs in LiquidForm seem very wonderful when youdo not understand 'the nature of the! remedy. As a matter of fact, theprinciple thing it does is put thestomach in god working order in avery short time, and stimulate thehealthy action of the bowels, and inconsequence the 'action of every or.gan of the body is improved at once,and perfect health is the result.Brown's Native Herbs in LiquidForm is a wonderful treatment and Iwould advise any person sufferingwith Stomach Trouble, Constipationor disorders of the Liver and Kidneys,to call upon their Druggist and havea talk with him about this most remarkable remedy.
