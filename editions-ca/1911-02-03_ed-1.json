RAISING KSBSIEIT.
Only Means by Which Millers
burg Can Obtain Improve
ments Urged by Hurst.
CITY COUNCIL IN SESSION.
Railroad Granted Permit to Erect
Nev. Depot Opposite Old Site
Millersburg News.
Declaring that the city of Millers
burg could not hope from the present
assessment of the town property to
reap any benefits in the form of public
improvements, Mr. F. P. Hurst,
Chairman of the City Board of Super
visors, addressed the Board at the
regular meeting of the City Council
Wednesday evening, when the report
of the Board was submitted to that
body, and urged an increase in the as
sessment of the taxable property in
the years to come to meet the public
requirements.
In the course of his address before
the Board Mr. Hurst discussed the as
sessment of the city, stating that at
the present time it was entirely too
low, and if the people of the town ex
pected to be able to come into posses
sion of the improvements that mean
so much to a town the assessment
snould be incraesed.
He showed that a greater part of
the taxable property in Milleraburg
was assetsed at one-third of its value
and some even less, while there was
very little which was assessed as much
as fifty per cent of its value. He said
if the town property was put upon the
proper basis the rata of fixation
would not have to be increased 10 in
stall such improvements as a water
works plant, but to require an assess
ment of the property at two-thirds of
itR reasonable value, would according
to his estimate, put a sum in excess of
52,500 extra in the city treausry an
nually, most all of which could be set
aside as a fund with which to install a
water system.
As it is beyond the power of the
town council to make a bonded indebt
edness of more than $6,000, Mr. Hrust
is of the opinion that in connection
with this and the funds realized from a
proper assessment, a sufficient amount
could, within a few years, be accumu
lated with which to install a perfect
system of water-works. Mr. Hurst's
address was well received and much

f ntnusiasm was evidenced as a result
of his remarks. While no action is
expected to be taken along this line at
the present time the matter will be
again taken up before another year
has elapsed.
The books of the Board of Supervis
ors were turned over to the Council.
The report of the Board shows the
total amount of the assessment of the
year of 1910 to be $324,347 an increase
ot $33,917 over the report of the Board
of Supervisors of the year previous.
The present Board raised the assess
ment $19,375, a net increase of $14,542.
The assessment for the year of 1911
amounts in the agrgegate to the sum
of $343,722, $31,4522 of which is levied
upon the property owned by white
residents and $28,300 upon colored
residents.
Considerable routine business was
transacted and a permit was granted
the Louisville & Nashville Railroad
Company to construct a depot on the

about $3,500 and will be a frame struc
ture covered with slate. Mr. A. S.

eight years ago I was afflicted with

lame and if I stooped, sharp twinges,
like the stab of a knife, darted through
my body. The kidney secretions were
also out of order, being at times too
