cording to Rule
Travelers iii South Africa have noted
the fact that where monkeys congregate
in large numbers they also indulge in
cf a certain kind Two of these
games seem to resemble cricket and
iootball
The cricket is of a primitive order
About a dozen monkeys stand in a cir
cle or whatever is akin to the simian
idea of a circle Two of them advance
from different extremities of the circle
and stop about 15 yards apart facing
each other The monkey at the southern
The monkey at the other end dees
not as you might suppose wield a full
cane bat His business is to dodge the
cocoanut which the bowler aims at his
head The deliverv of the ball is tre
was finished when a maiority oi mon
keys lay nursing their wounds under
the friendly shade of a neighboring
palm
The football is of a more advanced
type It is also played with a cocoanut

the street
To carry on the joke Mr Leitch ob
serving a fine ox tongue in the window
made it apparently say Shame on ye
Archie Mains J whereupon the amazed
butcher fled precipitately from the shop
leaving it and all it contained at the
mercy oi his waggish tarmenton Nug

the weather bureau cant give us a

Boston Courier
In a case before a London magistrate
the question was as to the ownership of
some antique ormolu artioles and two
workmen who stoutly claimed the
tides said that they made them To
prove tneir assertion they set to work
in court and showed bow ormolu wai
made antique with pumice powder

LEFT ON TRAINS
Sorts of Articles Are Forgotten
Absentininded Passengers
Recently a Chicago railroad displayed
in its unclaimed parcel room five barrels
of rubber overshoes and a bos full of
false teeth All this property and more
during a period of sis months had been
left on the suburban and through trains
by absent minded passengers The gen
eral baggage agent upon being asked
what was the oddest occurrence of this
kind said that a woman once left on a
train a 6-months-old baby and she did
not miss it until a trainman overtook
her with the little bundle of humanity
to
end of the circle has a cccoanut in his beiore sue got oucsme 01 mo train sued
hand Ho is the bowler i It was not a case of abandonment She
had forgotten take up her own off
spring
Only one half of the articles left on
trains are claimed and returned to own
ers At all the railroad offices in Chi-
mendously fast full pitched and fraught cago there are to be found motley col
with dire results if it touches the lections of about all the articles which
spot When it does happeii to touch man or woman ever owned It would
the spot that is any pait of the be impossible to list them in a whole
keys body that monkey is very much page of a newspaper

Another monkey takes his place until
he too receives his dismissal It was
sivoly among the lost and found of the
big railroads is the urdbrella An offi
cial of the Illinois Central says he re-
presumed by the travelers that the game ceived in the baggage department 15

of the Burlington says his records show
about 600 a year and the other lines
report large collections of this service
able article which are left on trains in
all kinds of weather On a recent fine
The game if anything is undoubtedly J sunshiny day the Burlington railroad
the socker game and is played with
the feet Of course there is no goal nor
any tactics to speak of the object of
each animal being to keep the hall to
himself as much as possible
Still the competition to get the ball
makes it resemble a real game of foot
er and the dexterity exhibited by
these peculiar amateurs is surprising
and wonderful
In an evil moment some ambitious
monkey may elect to play the Eugby
game by snatching up the ball and
making off but the game then develops
into war in which life is sometimes
the prize
No mention is made of a referee but
if there is one about like a wise and
showed on its record a whole page of
abandoned umbrellas
Next come the overshoes which are
daily found singly and in pairs and of-
tentimes odd in size and kind At all
1 the offices they are accumulated to the
extent of barrels and barrels It is a
I common occurrence to find upper low
er and partial sets of false teeth Some
j give evidence of long service others
I have been too new and have been laid
l out to give relief But they come in
all shapes and sizes

is to be found in the lost parcel rooms

Union station fitted out a dummy figure
