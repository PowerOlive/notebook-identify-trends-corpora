The guests were served icacream and cakes, and participated invarious games during the evening.The auxiliaries in all parts of thecounty are actively engaged in making supplies for the Red Cross work,and all day long in many a home canis hoped that Paris, like Lexington gand Winchester, will soon become a,tcenter from which large oil opera- Jtions shall be conducted.

Itis asserted that' one employe securedquite a large sum in this manner.In order to do away with this danger,against wrhich there was apparentlyno remedy, the employes will nowhave to visit the pay-car and havethemselves properly identified before they can receive their checks.The pay-car will visit all pointsregularly twice a month, under theprovisions of the new law regardingsemi-monthly pay days.IS JS ISSHERIFFS MUST MAKE THEIR RETURNS TO COURT ON TIME.COOL CLOTHESFOR HOT WEATHERMil, s,.if&Wbt.wJi JV y'V-f9 Sf?

Wealso know that the women of Parishave shown already that they realizethe vital part they have to play, andwe see in the homes of Paris everyday indications of their efforts to dothat part well. It is evidenced in agreater conservation of foodstuffsthan they have ever shown beforeIt has been evidenced by their willingness to take up their needles fovthe Red Cross work, and in thatwork no denomination hasbackward, no classism shown.manifested daily in the patrioticteachings they have been instillinginto the hearts of their young men.. We know the women are an important factor in the administration oZthe greatest struggle America hasever faced for we can see it in anyhome in Paris, be it ever so humble.Fifteen years ago a Paris womanwould have been highly indignant atthe suggestion that she take up somepart of masculine' work and do something for her country. Nov she realizes it is a duty, a patriotic as wellas a social and economic duty, shaowes the Nation, and those who arenot "doing their bit" in the homeare actually engaged in some workheretofore done by a man, while theman himself is gone or is. the firing line.To-day a registration of the womenof many States is being made. It willbe used to advantage by the Government during the war. It will be val-uable in many ways because it willshow just how far the country maydepend upon them in time of war. Itwill bring them into closer touchwith the institutions they can bestserve, it will be a census of realThe Country Papers.Secretary McAdoo has thanked thenewspapers of the United States formaking: the sale of the Liberty Loan.3possible, and he has called attentionto the fast that especially deservingof thanks are the editors of the weekly and semi-weekly papers, in otherwords, the "small-town papers" ofthis country. Without their aid.thousands of rural homes would never have been reached and it is amatter of fact that a vast amount ofLiberty Loan bonds were purchasedby the farmers.It is a deserving tribute to thecounty newspapers of this country.The little paper from the old homotown is still recognized y by UncleSam as of equal importance to thegreat metropolitan daily when itcomes to talking to all America.While the weekly newspaper and thecity daily are not competitors, inthat the public has placed its stampof approval upon both of them anddecided that it cannot get along without either, it is a recognized factthat in such instances as the recentLiberty Loan campaign and the selective draft registration the government could not have hoped for success without the heartiest co-operationof the country papers.Secretary McAdoo's testimonal tthe loyalty of the county newspapers in this country is most pleasing. But he should not stop there.Now that he knows their value inspreading before the people, millionsof them, who are not reached by dailypapers, the vital message so neces-tsary to our success in the presentwar, he should see that greater consideration is given them in the hall-;of Congress, and that their lifebloodis not sapped by such unfair legislation as is frequently, too frequently,offered. He would do well to remember that this government expects toinaugurate other nation-wide campaigns before peace shall have beendeclared, none of which can hope tobe successful unless the country pa-ipers of the United States are back o?them.MILLERSBURGi1 t 1With haircuts at thirty-five cent?per cut, it will soon be quite properfor Paris people to let wool growand explain to their friends that youonce made a wager that you wouldnever have it cut aerain until WilliamUCCllI T n-ry n i -n rrc TJktoti niiif Tl a ( "h o 11 to 11 n 11 fl. ,15 ' platform and enlisted in the army.IS fe tQBE CANNY.Get that canning impulse.Make your hoe this summer keepyour can opener busy next winter.Get ready for canning season now.Regrets are the only things ever canned in the jars you forgot to order.Can nothing that can be kept without canning.

Northern seas are apt to be coldthe year round and salt spray has achilling fashion of penetrating itsicy atmosphere to the very marrowof one's bones. Our sailor lads, onsevere duty these days, need betterprotection than has been given themheretofore and, on their behalf, theGovernment has issued designs andinstructions for a "sailor's kit," consisting of a sleeveless jacket, amuffler and wristlets.These kits must be uniform, ofcourse, and must be made accordingto instructions both as to color andworkmanship. Tn insure this theyare inspected before being issued tothe sailors. But everybody whoknows anything about knitting caneasily follow the instructions given,and fortuntely this charmingly oldfashioned work is still widely enoughknown to have a devotee in everycommunity who can understand theinstructions and teach the art toothers. fThousands of these kits are needed and consequently the whole country has gone to knitting.

The State Fire Marshal in a public warning says at thistime a fire from any cause will be acalamity. A careless fire, he says,will be a crime.The warning from the departmentof State Fire Marshal T. B. Pannell,is as follows:During the present crisis yourcountry needs every bushel of grainthat goes into your house this season.A fire from any cause will be acalamity, a careless fire will be acrime.Fire in 1916 destroyed 5,180,000bushels of grain in our country. Atpresent prices this grain would beworth $7,500,000.259 elevators went up in flames,entailing a loss of $1,554,000 inbuildings, making a total loss of almost $10,000,000 in elevator fires iaone year.One million people could have beenfed with the grain destroyed in elevator fires.Two-thirds of our country's annualfire loss is preventable. An ounceof prevention is worth many poundsof cure, and doubly so in these day?when the conservation of our foodsupply is so important.Cleanliness, not only in elevatorsbut in every property, will eliminatenine-tenths of the fire hazard.Food, clothing and shelter are produced only by human effort, hencelabor expended in replacing waste iswithdrawn from legitimate production for the satisfaction of humanneeds.Spontaneous combustion may bacaused in rubbish heaps by oily ragsor waste.
