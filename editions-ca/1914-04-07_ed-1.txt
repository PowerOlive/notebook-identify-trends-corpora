Some of her new models had avery bouffant effect at the hips, andthen a tightness below the kneeswhich flared out at either side at thefeet. This was usually caused by setin pleats or ruffles. This same couturiere shows a decided fondness forthe high waistline.(Copyright. 1914. by Panama Pacific International Exposition Company.I The superb Palace of Horticulture at the Panama-Pacific Internationalexposition in San Francisco in 1915 will be surmounted by a vast dome ofiglass, supported with immense steel trusses.

Some skirts are so loose andlarge at the Waistline that the suspenders of the same material are asmuch of a necessity as an .ornament.The Balkan style, which seemes tohave originated on this side of thewater, is taking quite a hold in Paris,and is favored by Poiret. As a result,he madea very hanlsome oysterwhite linen dress with & waist or jerkin falling straight well below thehips and fastening, on each shoulder,with a large jet button. It was beltedloosely with a wide patent-leatherbelt. The skirt waj straight-hangingand rathei wider than those we havebeen accustomed totThe designers this year have takentheir inspiration from all phases oflife from men's peasant blouses to aman's Prince Albert. A man's morning suit of black and white check,bound with black braid on the edges,inspired a tailored suit for women.The front of the jacket of this suitwas cut very short, sloping from theunder-arm seams and fastening withone large black button over the chest.In the back'the jacicet fits smoothly at the shoulders and fall free andloose below. The armholds are- verylarge and bound with black, thesleeves appear to emerge as thqughthey were not fastened in. This wholegarment is bound with black braid;the collar is black srik, and the vestof red satin, closes with a double.rowof black buttons. IShort jackets, either Eton or bolero, are models in which one canhi t bemistaken when choosing this seson.The model which I have used for myfirst illustration is made of black andgreen plaid suiting. The short ucketis lengthened by a graduated cir ular Jrume, very narrow in iront ana lo lgerin the back. The sleeves have a circular cuff. The skirt is made with afitted peplum, having a graduatet circular rufElev attached which curve upward in the front on the same Hi e asthe jacket.

One wasa trouser-skirt, which had the appearance of being made from a piece ofmaterial which passed from the waistin front, between the ankles, and upto the waist in the back. The twoselvages were sewed together oneither side, except at the bottom,where space is left for the feet to gothrough. These are extreme butsmart in their appearance, and verycomfortable, but, in reality, they giveno more width for walking than theskirts which we have been wearing.Another skirt hung straight and fullfrom the waist, with the fulness confined at the bottom by a cuff of thesame. A white bell, running through.slits of the goods were worn. Another skirt was draped up in front bymeans of bne deep pleat across, whichgave a place for pockets. In fact,, almost all of the skirts had pocketssomewhere.For my second illustration I haveused a frock of broche taffeta. Thecut is unusually simple, but so smartin its outline that it. nils the requirements of the approved silhouette. Thebodice is loose and full, blousing overthe waistline. The skirt has lis fulness disposed of in pleats, both frontand back, giving the simple but effective draping at the hips. The cuffs onthe short sleeves are cut circular,curving upward on the top of thesleeves, from under which falls a frillof lace. The collar of the organdychemisette is wirec to flare, picotedged, and fastened v.'ith tiny crochetbuttons.The hat worn with this summerygown is an example of the old-fashionedWatteau hats, which are all therage.

" -TWELVE RESERVE BvNKSLocation Announced of Reserve BankrAuthorized By New Law Ken' tucky in District "No. 4.WASHINGTON, April 3. Afterthree months consideration the Reserve Bank Organization CommitteeThursday night announced it has divided the continental United Statesinto twelve cities where Federal reserve banks are to be located underthe new currency law.This is the' first decisive step toward the establishment of a new system. The banks are to be located atthe following cities: Boston, NewYork, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Va., Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis,Minneapolis.Kansas City Dallas, Tex.,and San Francisco.Cleveland is the center of bankingdistrict number four. The capital ofthe bank there will be $11,621,535,deposited with 724 National and several State banks. The territory includes the State of Ohio, parts ofPennsylvania and West Virginia, andall of Kentucky east of the westboundary of the following counties:Boone, Grant, Scott, Woodford, Jessamine, Garrard, Lincoln, Pulaski andMcCreary.The center of district number eightis at St. Louis, and the bank will havea capital of ?6,219,C23, deposited with434 National banks. Its territory willinclude Arkansas, part of Missouri,Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee, Mississippi, and all of Kentucky, not included in district four.The Organization Committee wasnot authorized to provide for branchbanks of Federal Reserve Banks, butthe act specifically states that suchbanks shall be established. This taskwill be left to the supervision of theFederal Reserve Board yet to be appointed by the President.The committee called attention tothe act that under the requirementsof the act it could not find ground forthe establishment of more than onebank on the Pacific Coast, but hopedin the near future to have Congressauthorize another bank which will belocated in this great section.In a supplemental statement t hecommittee gave out the followingstatistics used in determining the cities and districts:District No. 1 has an area in squaremiles of 183,900 and a population of7,961,022. District No. 8 has an areain square miles of 146,474 and a population of 6,726,611.According to the committee figuresthe total capital and surplus of theapproximately 7,500 banks in the system will be 109,898,902.The last statement shows Nationalbanks in excellent condition to meetthe demands of the new law. Someobservers were surprised by the factthat loans and discounts have increased instead of being curtailed. Loansand discounts on March 4, 1914,amounted to $6,357,535,898, a gainover January 13, 1914, the time of thelast call, of $182,130,936.Subscribing banks must begin payments for their reserve bank stock,thirty days after the announcement ofthe districts and reserve cities, and itwas believed in soma quarters that thelast statement might show a decreasein loans and discounts because of thisimpending announcement. The loanand discount increase, taken togetherwith the fact that individual depositsincreased in the same period by morethan $39,000,000, was said to be thebest indication that the Nationalbanks are in shape to meet the demands of the new system.According to the statement the resources and liabilities of the Nationalbanks were $11,564,497,260; their capital stock $1,056,482,120, and theirindividual deposits $6,111128,457.Their reserves were put at$l,547,592,375, an average of 20.62 percent, and$47,52 9t429 above the amount requiredby law. The cash in banks decreasedsince January, 1914, about $14,000,000,but increased over April 1913 aboutS80.000.000.HOW KENTUCKY IS DIVIDED UP.,ST LOUIS DISTRICT.WASHINGTON, April 3.

For instance, therule in Rome is to turn to the right;in Florence, to the left.

Another test that brings outthe fact more clearly is that the childnow winks his eyelid if a finger ora small object is waved close to 'theeye.The disease from which little Davidhas been a sufferer since he was threeweeks old is known as staphyloma ofthe cornea. Both eyes became affected and the child was practically blind.Sight was partially restored to theright, however, after treatment.The operation was performed abouta week ago, and the cornea of thepig's eye was used because it is saidit more closely resembles the humancornea than that of any other animal.VACANT SITES SHOULD BEMADE MORE ATTRACTIVE.While the citizens of Paris are imbued with the spirit of making Pariscleaner and more healthful city, thereshould be a step taken in the directionof improving the looks of several vacant building sites, especially thosealong Main street, which have beenallowed to go unattended for sometime and have proved an eyesore tothe community, and impair the beauty of the other parts of the city.One of these site-j in particular, isthat at the corner of Main and Sixthstreets, where the old Baptist Churchstood. The owners of the property,it is understood, recently disposed ofthe old building material with the provision that the lot should be clearedby a certain time. The old structurewas torn down and a large portion ofthe debris removed, but enough of itwas left on the premises to present avery ugly and unattrative appearance. Such a condition would be badenough in the suburbs, but in the business section of the city it should notbe tolerated.We have not heard of any one, eventhose most earnestly engaged in thepromotion of the civic welfare of thecity, entering a complaint against thiscondition, but many have condemnedthe unsightly appearance of the sitelocated in the very heart of the business district. If there is to be noteffort on the part of those invested with the duty or clearing thisbuilding site, to comply with the contract, then the city officials shouldtake action and either have the siteplaced in a condition that would bepresentable to the eye of the' public orscreen it from view.GET-RCH-QUfCK SPECULATIONUUI ?

Y.3 TT J J A VA MA I 1 1 ATHE MONTHLY MAGAZINEWhere The Public Eye Looms LargeBy A. Bart HortonCINCINNATI has thefaculty of producingbig men, and she hasexercised that faculty diligently. An occasional President, senators, congressmen, men who have shonein all walks of professionaland business life, and "Gary"Herrmann and Ban Johnson.Probably no two men inthese United States are better known or more deservedly popular. It has beenmy proud pleasure to haveknown both of these men,more or less intimately, foryears, and I have watchedtheir careers with interest.In all the history of Cincinnati no one of her nativesons has done more to bringher before the public eyethan has "Gary" Herrmann.The nickname of "Gary," asbestowed upon him by his intimate friends in the dayswhen he was a poor boy graduating from"printer's devil" to compositor, growing into atitle of affectionate respect as he steadilymounted the ladder of fame, today is the nickname pre-eminent in the United States. Thesmall boy at the country crossroads, the smallboy in the city, and their older brothers, business men, professional men, men of nationalprominence, all know him. His reputation forbeing "square," for being absolutely honest andimpartial in all his dealings, has become sofirmly established that there is no one in thesporting world in general that would hesitate toaccept him as a final arbiter in any dispute andwho would not be perfectly satisfied with hisdecision. In fact, the position that he occupiesas Chairman of the National Commission isalmost startlingly unique. When this commissionwas established it was to consist of three members, the president of the National League andthe president of the American League, and thesetwo members were to meet and choose the third.It can be readily seen how much power lay inthe hands of this third member, and how greatwas to be his influence over the destinies of ournational pastime. The National League and theAmerican League, the two great, powerful contenders in the baseball world, struggling to gainevery possible vantage point over its rival, theone represented through Ban. Johnson and theother through Harry P. Pulliam, decided that thefuture of the national game absolutely requiredpeace. Thus, the famous "peace compact" wasentered into. Thus, a national commission wascreated to adjust all questions of differences andto absolutely control the destinies of baseball.It was an easy matter to decide who shouldrepresent the two major leagues, but to choosethe third member that was, indeed, a difficultproblem. Yet it was satisfactorily solved, andlet us hope, solved for a long time to come."Gary" Herrmann was chosen. This was a tributeto him, indeed. The president of the AmericanLeague and the president of the National Leagueselected a man who was president of one of theNational League clubs, and upon whom was todevolve the duty of deciding questions that mightbe of vital importance to his own club. That hehas fulfilled these duties honestly and in the mostupright manner and with absolute fairness isevidenced by the fact that for ten years he hasbeen re-elected to that position. A few years agoafter a strenuous fight, the National BowlingTournament was held in Cincinnati, and the localassociation, requiring an executive head to manage this most important meeting, placed "Gary"Herrmann in charge. Under his able management the tournament was a success and sogreatly impressed were bowlers from all overthe United States with "Gary" Herrmann's personality that he was chosen as president of thenational body. These, however, were not theonly national honors conferred upon him, forthat powerful order, the Elks, made him theirGrand Exalted Ruler. In his own city he hasheld many positions of trust and was acknowledged by national experts to be one of the bestposted men in the United States in municipalmatters. During the construction of the Cincinnati Water Works he was president of theboard in charge, from the start to the completion, and an impartial government engineer pronounced this undertaking to be one of the bestand mosteconomically constructed water workssystems in the world.Ban Johnson's rise in the baseball world wasnot as meteoric as "Gary" Herrmann's, but noman in the baseball world has accomplished,single-handedly, as much. To his wonderfulexecutive ability and his tireless energy was duenot only the organization, but the wonderfulsuccess of the American League. I have knownhim since early boyhood. His dear old fatherwas principal of the school in Avondale, one ofthe suburbs of Cincinnati, and his memory isheld in respect and affection by many of Cincinnati's most prominentmen, who were his boys.Ban Johnson was a prettygood ball player himself inhis boyhood days and developed into quite a starcollegiate pitcher. He adopted journalisnf as a career andfor many years was sporting editor of the CincinnatiCommercial Gazette. Of hisgreat ability in this line Ican bear witness, for I wasat that time on the staff ofthe same paper. The taskhe undertook in organizingthe American Leagueseemed almost staggering inits hopelessness. The National League, firmly cemented in public favor, having witnessed the downfallof several other contendingleagues which, starting under the most favorable auspices, had proven expensivefailures, seemed, indeed, aGoliath for this young Davidto tackle. Yet, step by step, with tireless energy,aided by a few loyal men, whose confidence andesteem he had won through an intimate knowledge of his great ability, he not only establishedthe American League, but placed it on an equalbasis before the American public with the National League.Ban Johnson's ascendency in the baseballworld was the result of a slow evolution, while"Gary" Herrmann leaped into prominence almostin a day. A number of prominent Cincinnatimen, attending a business meeting in 1903, alllovers of baseball, were bemoaning the fact ofthe alien ownership of the Cincinnati club, forJohn T. Brush, of Indianapolis, was its owner."Why don't some Cincinnati people buy theclub?" asked one."Probably because Mr. Brush wants too muchmoney for it to be a good investment," was theanswer."How much does he want?" This questioncould not be answered.That coterie comprised not only men ofwealth, but men who loved their native city, andit was then and there determined to buy theCincinnati club irregardless of its income-earningvalue, but simply to bring the ownership home.The price paid was a large one for those days,and "Gary" Herrmann became its president.There was a merry war on at that time betweenthe National and American Leagues, a war whichinvolved all the minor leagues, and the evil effectit was having, both financially and otherwise,was only too apparent to him. Some immediatesteps must be taken to avert these evils. Theresult was the National Commission.I quote a few lines from a speech made by"Gary" Herrmann at the recent big baseballgathering in New York:"Professional baseball has passed the periodwhen it can be regarded solely as a sport andhas, as conducted today, become an institutionof our country. Its uplift and expansion beganTHE MONTHLY MAGAZINEwith the adoption of the National Agreement in1903. That pact between leagues not only safeguards the interests of the ball player, but subordinates the business department of the gameto sportsmanship and the American sentiment offair play, assures the player a square deal andoffers an article of ball acceptable to patrons."The agreement has for its cornerstone the'perpetuation of baseball as the nationalpastime of the American by surrounding it withsuch safeguards as will warrant absolute publicconfidence in its integrity and methods, and bymaintaining a high standard of skill and sportsmanship in players.'"Another fundamental principle of the Agreement is "promotion of ball players as a class bydeveloping and perfecting them in their profession and enabling them to secure adequate compensation for expertness.'"For the accomplishment of these purposes,a co-operative form of government was adopted.Recently we have heard and read a great dealabout the so-called reserve clause in NationalAgreement contracts. That a provision of thiskind is absolutely necessary for a continuance ofthe prosperity and popularity the game has attained will not and cannot be seriously questioned by anyone. This is realized by the organization which has recently entered the field forthe 1914 contracts, entered into between playersand clubs of the Federal League, contain a clauseof this character?"The Ball Players' Fraternity cheerfully concedes the right of a club to reserve its playersfrom season to season, its officials and membersrealizing, that without this privilege, the game'srevenue would not warrant high salaries, . andthat in the open competition for players, thestars of the game would become annually congested in teams representing New York andChicago, thereby making the major league pennant races professional, with the result that thesmaller communities of the National and American Leagues would become baseball cemeteries."Some assert that the old reserve clause ina player's contract was illegal. Without enteringinto an elaborate argument on this subject, Ireiterate that such a provision is necessary andthat without it the game cannot flourish. I hold,furthermore, that when entered into in goodfaith both parties are morally bound to respect it."In the new National Agreement contracts,this clause has again been incorporated, althoughthe language has been somewhat changed to makeit absolutely legal and binding on both parties."Thus, sitting side by side in this "High Court"of baseball, in almost absolute control of thegreatest pas'time of the greatest nation on earth,are these two Cincinnatians "Gary" Herrmannand Ban Johnson.A Sweet Singer of Folk-SongA Story of the Ever Beautiful Melodies of Stephen Collins Foster(JJip Rebecca R. LaughlinFEW songs appeal as directly to the heart as"Old Folks at Home." Its pathos bringsto us a vision of home and mother. Thepotency of its appeal has made it that rare thing,a popular song that survives.Stephen Collins Foster wrote and composed"Old Folks at Home" and other songs, in allabout one hundred and sixty. Many of themhave become genuine songs of the people, andthe most popular, "Old Folks at Home," hasbeen translated into nearly all European andseveral Asiatic languages. Even during Foster'slifetime his music was on thousands, perhapsmillions, of lips, and has since been re-echoed inmillions of hearts, but the people who sang hissongs, and especially this beautiful air, which isjustly given such high esteem, passed the manby. It has been said with justice that during thelast years of his life, which were passed in NewYork, the most familiar sounds he heard aroundhim weie strains of his own music, the leastfamiliar sight was a friend's face. Now, afterthe way of the world, and too late for it toprosper him, he is recognized as having possessed positive genius for the invention of simpleyet tender and refined melody which has notbeen without its influence in shaping the development of musical taste in this country. The refinement and tenderness of Foster's melodic invention are important factors, for sometimes apopular air is the starting point of the formationof musical taste.When Foster wrote "Old Folks at Home" hepenned it from the depths of a longing heart, and,while his songs are not remarkable as poetry,yet the words echo and the music re-echoes sentiments that are at once touching and universal,such as love of home, of mother, of wife, ofsweetheart, sentiments that appeal instantly tothe popular heart. All his songs are melodiousand easy flowing. Probably not one person out ofa thousand, if so many, had heard of the "SwaneeRiver" before Foster's "Old Folks at Home" waspublished, and but for that song the stream woulddoubtless be threading its way to the Gulf ofMexico in obscurity. How did the composerhappen to be so fortunate as to hit upon thename that fits so perfectly with the rhythm ofthe verse and with' the sentiment of the music?One day Foster entered his brother Morrison'soffice in Pittsburgh. He told him he had a newsong and wanted the name of a Southern riverwith two syllables to use in it. His brothersuggested several names of Southern rivers withtwo syllables, but none of them appealed toFoster. Morrison then took down an atlas froma shelf and they both looked over a map of theUnited States together. At last Morrison's finger stopped at a little river in Florida. Fosterwas delighted with his brother's discovery andhe hastily jotted down the name on a- piece ofpaper he had in his hand, and read to his brotherthe lines beginning "Way down upon the SwaneeRibber," which produced the melodious, flowingeffect that Foster was seeking. The song hassurrounded with a halo of sentiment the SwaneeRiver, with the result that most people who seeit are disappointed, and the Swanee is best viewedthrough the delicate mist of song.Old Folks at Home.Way down upon the Swanee Ribber,Far, far away,Dere's wha ma heart is turning ebber,Dere's wha de old folks stay.All up and down the whole creationSadly I roam,Still longing for de old plantation,And for de old folks at home.All de world am sad and dreary,Ebery where I roam;Oh, darkies, how my heart grows wearyFar from de old folks at home!All round de little farm I wander'dWhen I was young,Den many happy days I squander'd,Many de song I sung.When I was playing wid my brudderHappy was I;Oh! take me to my kind old mudder,Dere let me live and die.One little hut among de bushes,One dat I love,Still sadly to my mem'ry rushes,No matter where I roam.When will I see de bees a-hummingAll round de comb?When will I hear de banjo tummingDown in my good old home?At about the time this song was written,Christy, the famous negro minstrel, appearingwith his company in New York, requested thatFoster send him a new song with the right tosing it before it was published. Foster consultedhis brother with reference to this request, andthe latter drew up an agreement whereby theminstrel undertook to pay five hundred dollarsfor the privileges he sought, and dispatched it toChristy, who immediately returned it duly signed.This explains why Christy's name appears on thetitle page of the first edition of "Old Folks atHome."This song and the soul of it together make asimple, direct appeal to the most universal sentiments in the human breast, and together with"Home, Sweet Home" are probably the mostwidely known songs in the English languageIt is a singular coincidence that both have a longing for home as their underlying sentiment.Stephen Collins Foster came of good family,,but, notwithstanding the bright prospects inyouth, his life was full of vicissitudes. His father,William Barclay Foster, was a general merchantin Pittsburgh, from where he dispatched goodson flatboats down the Ohio and MississippiRivers to New Orleans. About twice a year hemade the trip himself, sometimes returning overland, sometimes by vessel to New York. Onone of these voyages he was captured by piratesoff the coast of Cuba, but was liberated by aSpanish man-of-war. William Barclay Fosterwas married in Chambersburg, Pa., in 1807, toEliza Clayland Tomlinson. The newly weddedTHE MONTHLY MAGAZINEcouple crossed the mountains to Pittsburgh, adistance of nearly three hundred miles, on horseback. The elder Foster was a substantial business man. He purchased a large tract of land,then outside of Pittsburgh, but now part of thecity, which he named Lawrenceville in honor ofCaptain James Lawrence of "Don't give up theship" fame. During the War of 1812, whenWashington had been burned by the British andNew Orleans was threatened, urgent orders cameto Pittsburgh for supplies for Jackson's band ofdefenders, but no money accompanied the orders.Foster nevertheless shipped the supplies, whichreached Jackson in the nick of time. But theGovernment never settled for them, and thejudgment which Foster recovered still standsunsatisfied on the records of the United StatesCourt at Pittsburgh. His patriotism, however,undiminished, he donated a piece of ground inLawrenceville for a soldiers' burial place. Amonument marks the site.Of William Barclay Foster's children, Morrison Foster died as recently as 1904. He wasa man of means. Another son, William Foster,was the first vice-president of the Pennsylvania.Railroad; a daughter married Rev. EdwardBuchanan, a brother of President Buchanan, andher daughter is the wife of the president of oneof the great railway systems of the United States.Henrietta Crossman, the actress, whose full nameis Henrietta Foster Crossman, is another directdescendant. She is a grandniece of Stephen Collins Foster. These are all interesting facts, asthey show that Foster was of gentle birth, whichexplains the delicacy and refinement which givehis melodies much of their charm. Moreover,there was no reason why he should not havespent a very happy life save that he became aslave to drink, so that he died in want in a NewYork hospital and came near to burial as an unidentified pauper in the potter's field.On July 4, 1826, while the semi-centennial ofAmerican independence was being celebrated onthe Foster grounds at Lawrenceville (now partof Pittsburgh), Stephen Collins Foster was born.It is said that when Foster was but two yearsold he used his sister's guitar as a plaything andthat at the age of eight he taught himself theflute, and later the piano. His first compositionto be publicly performed was a waltz, the"Tioga," which he wr6te for four flutes, andplayed with three of his fellow students at thecommencement of the Athens (Pa.) Academy,where it was received with great applause. Hisfirst published song, written and composed whenhe was sixteen, was "Open Thy Lattice, Love."When he was nineteen he formed a singing clubamong the young men of his acquaintance, whichmet twice a week at his father's house, and heconducted. He soon began composing songsfor this club, the first being "The LouisianaBelle." A week later he wrote one of his bestknown songs, "Uncle Ned," and in which hishappy faculty of expression is very prominent.Together with "Old Folks at Home" and "MyOld Kentucky Home," his most familiar compositions are: "Beautiful Dreamer," "ComeWhere My Love Lies Dreaming," "Don't BetYour Money on the Shanhhai," "Gentle Annie,"" 'Gwine to Run All Night," "Hard Times ComeAgain No More," "I See Her Still in MyDreams," "Jenny June," "Laura Lee," "LouisianaBelle," "Massa's In De Cold Ground," "NellyWas a Lady," "Nelly Bly," "Old Dog Tray,""Oh, Boys, Carry Me 'Long," "Old Black Joe,""Oh, Susanna," "Under the Willow She's Sleeping," "Uncle Ned," "Virginia Belle," "Willie, WeHave Missed You," and "When This DreadfulWar Is Ended." He also wrote and composedfifteen hymns.In running over the list of Stephen CollinsFoster's songs it is found to include many thatare so familiar that the popular mind does notassociate them with any particular composer.They are all characteristic of genuine folk songs,and as simple as they are, they are destined tosurvive. A year after he had composed "UncleNed," and while he was clerking in his brotherDunning's office in Cincinnati, he wrote "Oh,Susanna." Not having as yet taken up musicprofessionally, he made a present -of these twosongs to a friend, who cleared ten thousand dollars from them, and developed what was then asmall music publishing business into one of thelargest houses in its line in the West.Several of Foster's lyrics reverberated hispersonal feelings. "Massa's In de Cold Ground,"although, of course, a darky song, was writtenunder the sorrow and feeling of loneliness causedby his father's death; "Old Dog Tray" in memoryof a beautiful setter he had owned; "My OldKentucky Home" as a musical souvenir of thepicturesque homestead of his relative, Judge andUnited States Senator John Rowan, of Bardstown,Ky. It is said that "My Old Kentucky Home," waswritten by Foster while he and his sister wereon a visit to the Rowan home. One morningwhile the slaves were at work and the darkychildren romping, the two young visitors wereseated on a bench in front of the homestead. Ina tree overhead a mocking bird was warbling.From a bush near by came the song of a thrush.According to the story, this bard wrote and composed the song then and there, and when enoughwas jotted down for his sister to obtain an ideaof the melody and of the first stanza, she took thesheet from his hand and in a sweet, mellow voice,that chimed in with the surroundings, sang:"The sun shines bright in the old Kentucky home,'Tis summer, the darkies are gay;The corntop's ripe and the meadow's in thebloom,While the birds make music all the day.""My Old Kentucky Home" is the twentiethof Stephen Collins Foster's "Plantation Melodies." It was undoubtedly the intrinsic meritand beauty of Foster's songs that lifted theChristy minstrels from the low position usuallyoccupied by such troupes to something like thatof a respectable concert room, both in this country and in England. Foster caught his idea ofwriting his so-called negro melodies from listening to the absurdities then in vogue with theburnt-cork gentry. He walked home from one oftheir concerts in Baltimore with the banjo stringsringing in his ears, and before he slept he hadcomposed the ridiculous words and taking aircalled "Camptown Races," with its chorus of"Du da, du-da, da." He passed from one finertone to another until he reached the perfection ofsimple pathos in "Old Folks at Home" and "MyOld Kentucky Home" and the music is his own.My Old Kentucky Home.The sun shines bright in the Old Kentucky home,'Tis summer, the darkies are gay;The corntop's ripe and the meadow's in thebloom,While the birds make merry all the day.The young folks roll on the little cabin floor,All merry, all happy and bright;By'm by, hard times comes a-knocking at thedoor,Then, my old Kentucky home, good night!-Weep no more, my lady, oh, weep no more today!We will sing one song for the old Kentuckyhome,For the old Kentucky home, far away.They hunt no more for the possum and the coon,On the meadow, the hill and the shore,They sing no more by the glimmer of the moonOn the bench by the old caljin door.The day goes by like a shadow o'er the heart,With sorrow where all was delight;The time has come when the darkies have to part,Then, my old Kentucky home, good night!Weep no more, my lady, oh, weep no more today!We will sing one song for the old Kentuckyhome,For the old Kentucky home, far away.The head must bow and the back will have tobend,Wherever the darky may go;A few more days, and the trouble all will endIn the field where the sugarcanes grow;No matter, 'twill never be light,A few more days till we totter on the road,Then, my old Kentucky home, good night!Weep no more, my lady, oh, weep no more today!We will sing one song for the old Kentuckyhome,For the old Kentucky home, far away.One Sunday afternoon in the home of one ofhis brothers he composed and wrote his mostambitious composition, "Come Where My LoveLies Dreaming," as a solo and as a quartet.Foster is described as a man of comparativelysmall stature, but of great physical courage. Hewas exceedingly sympathetic and tender-hearted,as one would naturally gather from his songs. Heis said to have been a very light sleeper, and inthis connection there is a very humorous anecdote: One night a strange dog, prowling aboutthe place and howling, so disturbed Foster that ,he seized a poker and, dashing out, chased theanimal away. Next day the family made merryof this incident at the expense of the author andcomposer of "Old Dog Tray."In 1850 Foster married Jane Denny McDowell, the daughter of a leading Pittsburghphysician. Shortly afterward he received suchflattering offers from his publishers, Firth, Pond& Co., of New York, that he decided to settle inthat city. But after he had been there a yearhe grew so homesick that one day he announcedthat he was going home, disposed of his furniture before evening, and the next day, late atnight, rang the bell of his parents' home. Heremained home until 1860, when, having separated from his wife, he again went to New York.There his unfortunate habits grew upon him andat times he walked the streets in an old glazedcap and shabby clothing which made him lookmore like a tramp than the composer of songsthat were being sung on all sides. He wouldwrite and compose a song in the morning, sellit in the afternoon, and spend the proceeds indissipation before night. In January, 1864, whilesuffering from fever in a cheap hotel, he roseduring the night for a drink of water, was soweak that he fell when near the washstand, and,in so doing, struck against the broken lip of thepitcher and gashed his neck. He lay on the floorinsensible until discovered in the morning by aservant who was bringing towels to his room.When revived he asked to be taken to BellevueHospital, where he died from fever and loss ofblood on the 13th of January. His identity notbeing known at the hospital, his body was takento the morgue, where it remained until finallyhis friends traced it and prevented the composerof so many sweet and lovely melodies from beingburied as a pauper. Neither the PennsylvaniaRailway Company nor the Adams Express Company would accept anything for conveying hisbody to Pittsburgh, where he was buried besidehis parents, while a volunteer band of the bestmusicians of the city played "Come Where MyLove Lies Dreaming" and "Old Folks at Home."THE MONTHLY MAGAZINEThe Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station and its WorkEdited by Thomson R. Bryant, SupLEDITOR'S NOTE This is the sixth of a series of articles on The Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station and its WorkRestoration of Fertility to Rundown Lands&y H. B. Hendrick,Asst. Agronomist, Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Stationi"The Irvington demonstration field with the run down gullied area and The Webster Stone Company'slimestone plant in the distance.TWO of the photographs shown in this articlewere taken from adjacent fields. The fieldsare owned by different farmers and the linefence is all that separates them. In fact, the placingsof the camera to get the two views were not fifteenrods apart. One of the photographs shows a fieldgrown up to weeds, broom sedge, wild briers andbrushes. The rolling surface of the field is badlywashed and gullied, the erosion from water havingcut ditches fully three feet deep. The other photograph shows a beautiful field of alfalfa, free fromweeds, nearly waist high, capable of producing thefirst cutting fully two tons of cured hay per acre.The two fields were the same kind of soil and represent the same innate fertility. Thirty years agotheir productiveness was the same. The difference,then, is not in the soil but in the farmer. The ownerof the one farm has been for 3'ears a corn andtobacco grower, keeping comparatively little stock,and growing almost no legume crops. Red cloverseed has not been sown upon this farm for twentyyears. The owner of the other farm grows regularrotations of crops, including corn, cowpeas, wheat,clover and alfalfa (no tobacco). This farmer feedsone hundred or more beef cattle every winter andhas sixty acres of alfalfa upon his four-hundred-acrefarm.Here we have represented, side by side, the wayby which lands are run down, and the means bywhich they can be kept up, or consistently restoredto fertility when they have been run down. The running down of fertility, or depletion of soils, is a slowprocess, likewise the consistent building-up process,or restoration of fertility, is slow. In this particularcase the depletion to a condition of low productiveness, on the one farm, has been in process for thirtyor forty years, while on the other farm it has takena like number of years to build up the soil to a highstate of productiveness, which is above the averageof the community and is even above the natural fertility. Striking contrasts in farming like the above areof common occurrence in our State. The lamentable feature is" that the farm lands being depletedare much in excess of those whose fertility is beingmaintained and improved or restored. This condition affects all of our people, and its iniquities maybe visited upon the third and fourth generations.The virgin soil of this state was many hundredyears in formation. It consists of a mixture of theearly rock formations and the decay of vegetableand animal (organic) life which grew thereon. Thefrost, the water and the wind were the chief agenciesin reducing the original rock to the finest particles,which now constitute our various soils. The firstplants were a lower series, such as the fungi, thealgae, the mosses and the ferns. The decay of theselower series of plants with the broken-down rockparticles formed the basis for the growth of thehigher series of plants which now constitute the foodof all animal life.Soil, then, is mineral matter plus organic matter,in the process of decay. The mineral plant-foodelements of any soil are therefore largely dependentupon the original rock formation of the section.The most important of these elements are phosphorus, potassium and calcium. The last two ofthese are very abundant in most Kentucky soils.The decaying organic matter (humus) of the soilperforms most important functions. Some of theseare:1. It furnishes nitrogen, the most important element of plant growth.2. It adds greatly to the moisture-holding capacity of the soil.3. It furnishes materials for bacterial development in the soil.4. It keeps clay soils friable and porous so thatair can circulate freely.5. It prevents plants from heaving out of theground in winter.6. It furnishes mineral plant food elements inbest form for plant growth.There are several potent factors which have depleted our soils. Corn, which is our principal crop,draws heavily upon the plant-food elements of thesoil. A 100-bushel corn crop requires 148 poundsof nitrogen, 23 pounds of phosphorus and 71 poundsof potassium for its growth. The nitrogen is allfurnished from the humus of the soil. Planting cornor tobacco on the same field for several years insuccession without a winter cover crop is very detrimental to the soil. The lands of Kentucky are mostlyrolling clay soils. Such lands are easily eroded.One of the deep gullies in the Irvington demonstration field.THE MONTHLY MAGAZINEThe common practice of leaving corn and tobaccofields bare during the winter months permits muchleaching of plant-food elements and much harmfulwashing.Very poor care is taken of farm manure. Between fifty and sixty million dollars worth of manureis produced annually in Kentucky, and approximatelyone-half its value is wasted by leaching, by heatingand by washing away in streams.There is a seeming effort on the part of farmersto restore fertility to run-down lands by the use ofcommercial fertilizers. In 1903 the farmers of Kentucky bought from 30,000 to 32,000 tons of fertilizersat a cost of $697,500. The tonnage used kept increasing until, in 1911 and 1912, there was purchasedeach year from 60,000 to 65,000 tons at a cost of$1,406,250. During these same ten years, 1903-1912,the yield per acre of the five principal crops, corn,tobacco, hay, wheat and oats, showed no increase.The average yields for Kentucky were :Corn. Tobacco.Average 1903-1912 28.4 bu. 835.7 lbs.Average 1911-1912 28.2 bu. 845.0 lbs.Hay. Wheat.

A run down area is just over thefence in the distance at the right.Under the contract this field must be left covered withred clover or alfalfa at the end of five years.legume crops, such as red clover, cowpeas, soy beans,alfalfa, etc. The legumes have the ability to fixatmospheric nitrogen in the soil, a power not possessed by corn, wheat or tobacco. About one-halfthe nitrogen required for the growth of leguminousplants is taken from the air. On most of the soilsof Kentucky corn should not be grown oftenerthan one year in three or four.2. The crops grown should be fed to stock uponthe farm in so far as the owner can, with carefulstudy, make this a profitable business. The value ofthe manure produced should be entered as a credit instock feeding.3. All stock should be kept bedded with straw orother cheap litter to retain the liquid manure,, whichcontains about one-half of the plant-food value ofthe total excrement. The manure should be spreadas soon after being made as is possible. It shouldnever be permitted to leach by rains or fire-burn.4. Winter cover crops should always follow cultivated crops. They utilize the available plant foodnot used by the regular crop, which otherwisemight be lost from leaching, and also prevent muchwashing.5. Where little stock is kept, or where the farmis run down, a good growth of some legume cropshould be turned under once in three or four years.In some parts of Kentucky the natural productiveness of soils can be much increased by the application of materials which are rich in the element phosphorus. Many soils of the state need lime in someform before red clover or alfalfa can be successfullygrown.The Extension Department has some fields inthe state where it is demonstrating methods of restoring run-down lands to productiveness. One ofthese fields is located at Iryington. This field contains twelve acres, six acres of which were said bythe owner not to be worth one dollar an acre forfarm purposes when taken over by the ExtensionDepartment one year ago. The land was literallyan area of gullies with practically all surface soilwashed away. By the use of ground limestonelegume crops are to be grown, and by turningunder some of the crops grown the land is to berestored to fertility. The Department is under contract to leave a good stand of red clover or alfalfaon this field in five years from the time of takingover the field. A full account of labor and materialsused upon the field is being kept. Information withregard to methods used and progress made will appear in later writings from the Extension Department.MPWorn field, adjacent to alfalfa field, just over the fencefrom a splendid field of alfalfa.

Hooper,College of Agriculture, State University, Lexington, Ky.FROM the thirteenth census of the United Stateswe find there are 8,457,000 chickens in Kentuck', and that these birds are worth $3,857,456. These chickens produced 44,313,377 dozen eggsduring that year (1910), which were worth $7,605,116.In addition to the eggs produced, $6,937,008 worth ofchickens were raised in 1910. In other words, thepoultry crop of this state for 1910 was worth $14,542,124. During that same period the poultry products of Missouri were worth $33,918,187. From thesefigures it will be seen that the production of eggsand chickens in our sister state is more than doublethat of Kentucky. However, in 1899 the poultryproducts in Missouri were worth only $18,000,000;so that Kentucky is today where Missouri was tenyears ago in the poultry industry. This great increase has been due to the fact that a Poultry Experiment Station was established in Missouri eight yearsago which has served to greatly increase interest inup-to-date poultry culture on the part of the Missouri farmer.The Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Stationhas recently established a poultry farm at Lexingtonin conjunction with the rest of the experimentalwork which will prove a boon to Kentucky poultrymen. The work is designed to appeal to the farmerand to lead him to follow better methods in theIM BCVjBhIbI -1 ' m MMMBMMBBBMBBBrBBBA good colony house, but too tall and too expensivefor the average farmer.management of his flock. The poultry houses onthe station farm are very practical and can beadopted by any farmer in the state. The farm islocated in the suburbs of Lexington, and it is anticipated that several hundred farmers will become acquainted with the methods followed at the poultryyards each year. Approximately eight hundred birdsof seven different varieties find a home at this poultry plant.Recently the Experiment Station held a largepoultry show where 382 single birds and 250 birds inpens were exhibited. These chickens came from allover Kentucky, and it was noticeable that thefarmers in this state are now raising efficient chickens while in the past they have not raised these useful types to such a great extent. It might be notedthat not a single game bird was entered in the show,but that the show was made up quite largely of theegg-laying and dual-purpose breeds.In selecting any breed the farmer must adoptthe one that appeals to him or that he likes. Thesmaller, more active chickens such as the Leghorns,are noted for their egg laying, while the larger,THE MONTHLY MAGAZINEA good type of colony house.plumper birds, such as the Rhode Island Reds andPlymouth Rocks, are used for meat and egg production. If pure-bred chickens could be distributed toevery farmer in Kentucky to replace the mongrelflocks found on many farms, the profits from thepoultry industry would be greatly enlarged, and it isone purpose of the station to interest the farmersin improving the breeding of the chickens.Most of the poultry houses used in this state arenot properly constructed. The stoop houses or theones with slatted sides are particularly objectionable.The poultry house should be closed on three sidesand the side toward the east should consist of alarge cloth curtain. There should be at least threesquare feet of floor space for every bird confined inthe house during the winter. At the ExperimentStation farm the birds are bedded with six inchesof clean straw, which is replaced once every month.The mixed grain feed is thrown promiscuously aboutin this litter so that the chickens must scratch andhunt for it. This gives them exercise. The rationused at the farm is made up of two parts of crackedcorn and one part of whole wheat in winter, andtwo parts of wheat and one part of cracked corn inthe summer. It is highly advisable to examine thebirds from time to time to see that they are notbecoming too fat nor too poor.In addition to the grain feed the station uses amixed feed made of finely ground ingredients asfollows :100 pounds200 pounds200 pounds200 pounds200 poundsISO pounds75 pounds25 pounds8 pounds25 poundsof bran,of middlings,of cornmeal,of rolled oats,of dried beef scrap,of alfalfa meal,of gluten meal,of oil meal,of fine table salt,of powdered charcoal.The unfortunate type of house found on manyKentucky farms.This dry powdered feed is thoroughly mixed together and placed in a box or a self-feeding hopperwhere the chickens can eat it at will, and they consume a large quantity during the course of a day.This furnishes material which is needed in egg production. Also the farmer can make use of somesilage, which will furnish a succulent feed andcause the birds to increase in their egg laying duringthe winter. At the station it is a practice to sproutoats in boxes. These oats are placed in the cellar,which is usually at a temperature of 45 degrees F.,and we find they sprout very nicely without additional heat. Some of these green oats are thrownto each pen of birds at noon every day.Because of the improper methods of feeding andthe poorly constructed houses, it is not customaryin Kentucky to get very many eggs during the winter,but if a poultry man will adopt the suggestions madeabove, we believe he will be surprised at the increasein egg production during the winter months.A boxful of dust which has been mixed with licepowder should be placed where the birds will dustthemselves in the winter as well as in the summer.Clean water should be furnished in a sanitary fountain and the roosts should be painted with a carbolicdip every two weeks to prevent lice from crawlingon the birds when they are roosting, and in thespring and fall the house should be whitewashedinside and out.Properly constructed chicken houses will cost nomore than those improperly built, and in many casesthe old houses can be rearranged so that they willserve the purpose.Now that the hatching season is approaching thefollowing remarks in regard to the rearing of youngchicks may be timely.The Rearing of Young Chickens. The death rateamong young chicks in this state is unnecessarilyhigh. A large percentage of this loss is due to poormanagement.The vitality of the young chickens depends uponthe vigor of the flock. The strongest chickens arehatched from eggs that are produced in the springwhen the flock is on range. When the birds areconfined closely in the winter it is a common experience that the fertility and vigor is very low.In comparison with the incubators and brooders,the hen can very satisfactorily hatch the eggs andcare for the young chickens. The nests used forbroody hens should be made out of some fine material such as hay, because coarse straw allows theheat from the body of the hen to escape, while thehay maintains a more even temperature.Nests that have been made on the ground willkeep in a more moist condition, and it is probablethat the young chicks when hatched will be somewhat more thrifty than if the nests had been placedin a box in a position off the ground. The reasonfor this is that the nest that is in contact with theground is kept moist and in turn maintains the moisture in the eggs. During the hatching the moistureinside the egg decreases in quantity.When the chickens are hatched they should bekept in the incubator for twelve hours. Then theyshould be removed and placed under a warm brooder.At this period they should be supplied a sprinklingof fine chick grit and some lukewarm water. Thegrit will prepare the digestive canal for its work.The next day finely cracked chick feed should befed. At this period the best poultrymen often feedrolled oats which has been freed from their hulls.The best kind of rolled oats to use are those thathave been prepared for human food. However, atthis station, splendid results have been securedfrom feeding such young birds on nothing butchick feed. At the end of ten days finely powderedgrow feed is placed within reach of the chicks.This contains a mixture of beef scrap, fish scrap,wheat shorts or some other ingredients. It causesrapid growth and the young chicks are very fondof it. Powdered charcoal is also sprinkled on topA small colony house and a flock of light Brahmas.of the chick feed once a day. Clean water is verynecessary, as young birds drink a large quantityof it. It should be changed several times eachday and an occasional addition of potash will helpto keep the young chicks free from disease. Whenthe chicks are two weeks old green clover ispulled and the stems tightly bound with a string.Then the bunches of clover are hung inside thepen where the chicks are kept. They will quicklyeat all the green leaves. Some green feed isrequired, but too much of it will cause scours.The earthworm serves as a host for the gapeworm. Therefore chicks that are allowed to run inchicken yards where poultry has been maintainedfor several years find worms that are infected. Ineating these earthworms the chicks swallow alsothe gapeworms and soon contract the disease. Atthe Experiment Station, by keeping the youngchicks on fresh ground, our chicks have not hada single case of this disease up to date.It is very necessary that the young birds shouldnot be chilled or they will certainly be stunted intheir growth. Any deformed or weak chicks shouldbe killed during the first twelve hours of theirlives, because they are liable to contract some disease and spread it through the flock.Shade is required. If there are no trees in theyard, shade may be provided by making an awningout of feed sacks or cotton cloth. Sunflowers andhemp have sometimes been used to furnish shade.If the young birds are allowed to run in a cultivatedfield during the summer they will get good exerciseand a number of insects.During the next few days the poultry departmentat the Kentucky Experiment Station will be greatlyenlarged, and it is the intention to make it as usefulto the farmers as possible. Information will besupplied to correspondents at any time free ofcharge.A large colony house with a cloth curtain front,located in an orchard.THE MONTHLY MAGAZINEA Honeymoon Hold-UpA Son of Dixie StoryTHE girl had fallen asleep. The clatteringof hoofs coming up the rocky trail awakened her, and as she raised her prettyface from the trunk of the tree, against whichshe was half reclining, the book which, she hadbeen reading slipped from her lap to the ground.She watched the rider with interest as hisbroncho loped into plain view and passed alongthe trail almost beneath her feet. The bronchostopped at the little stream and the rider dismounted, took a folding cup from his pocket andjoined his steed in drinking, "here's to you, oldboy, in the finest drink ever distilled, and that'ssome water, too!" He took off his Stetson andwiped the perspiration from his face and gazedwith deep admiration at the scene before him.It was one of the fairest spots in a section ofthe country, where natural beauties were few,indeed. Some romantic traveler, years before,has christened it "Waters of Delight." Througha small cleft in the mountain side a little streampoured out its waters over a rock-shelled cliff,some thirty feet high, forming a tiny waterfall.The narrow points of several canyons met here,and in the background the sides of one of themtowered up several hundred feet. There wereclumps of grass, green from the moisture and thewaters of the stream, the only verdure in thatsand-covered country for miles around. To theleft of the waterfall there was a grass-topped hillof dirt, some ten feet high, from which a goodsized tree spread its sheltering shade over thelittle dell. The stream wound around the footof this, and slipped away into one of the canyonsbeyond.The girl, slipping her revolver a little nearerto the front, was watching him intently, butquietly. She saw the look of amazement in hiseyes as he observed her for the first time. Hestepped forward and said to her, "Are you avision or just a girl?""Just a plain, every-day girl," she answered."Why?""Because I have seen the 'Waters of Delight'several times before, and have considered it oneof the most beautiful spots anywhere, but nowI appreciate the fact that there has always beenone thing lacking to complete its delights; then,too, I was startled to see a girl in this out-of-the-wayplace.""This is my favorite retreat," she answered."I ride over from the ranch three or four timesa week and spend a couple of hours here.""Then you live at one of the ranches nearhere?""Yes, my father owns the Double-O ranch,about ten miles from here.""Is David Owens your father?""Yes, he is my Dad." she answered."I worked there several months last year andremember now that he had a daughter who wasaway at school at the time.""Yes, father and aunt insisted on sending meaway for several years, to try to make a finishedyoung lady out of a ranch tomboy, but I fearthose years have been wasted, for I certainly lovethe ranch and ranch life.""Your dear old Aunt Emma used to talk ofher pretty niece away at school. You know shemothered us homeless cowboys, and we were allvery, very fond of her, and I used to spend manyan evening on the porch at the ranch house playing the guitar and singing to her. She was amighty good woman, for she stood for my music.""Oh, then you must be the Jim Bennett I haveheard her talk about She said that you quit togo out on a prospecting trip.""Yes, I have been knocking around the mountains ever since. You see my folks educated meto be a mining engineer, and after I left homeback in the East and came West I had a job fora short time with a mining company up in Montana. After I worked there a few months thecompany broke up and I was minus a job. Sincethen I have been alternately cowboy and miner,without having made much of a success of eitherjob About a week ago, though I believe Istruck something that looks good, and I am now&y Jl. Bart Hortonon my way into Wharton to file my claim."Frances Owens had been scrutinizing JimBennett carefully, and the result of her observations pleased her. Tall,vell built, with clean-cutfeatures and sunny hair, he was more than anordinarily good-looking specimen of manhood,and she determined to become closer acquaintedwith him, and she said to him: "If you are in noparticular hurry to file that claim, you wouldfind it more comfortable sitting up here thanstanding down there, and I would like to haveyou tell me about your strike."Jim accepted the invitation with alacrity.Before he had seen the girl he had been in ahurry to file his claim and to satisfy his cravingsfor a square meal, more acute as he nearedWharton. Girls had occupied a very small partof Jim's thoughts for the last five or six years,but he had occasionally wondered just what thegirl of his dreams would look like, and it nowflashed across his mind that this question wasanswered for the future. As he seated himselfbeside her in the grass and took up the bookthat she had been reading and casually glanced atit, he said : "If you are as fond of the 'Broad Highway' as I am, we certainly have a strong mutualfriend.""Indeed, I am fond of it," she answered."Won't you tell me about your strike?""It certainly looks like a good one; in fact, Iam confident that there is quite a little fortunein it. I had been knocking around for the pasteight months, gradually working my way southward without much success, and a little morethan a week ago I found that my supplies werenearly gone and my exchecquer was runningvery low, so I determined to abandon miningfor a while and make for this section to get ajob on a ranch. Two days later I found myselfat a little stream, and, bending over to get somewater, I saw unmistakable evidences of gold inthe sand. I had no way to pan it except withmy camp skillet, so I stayed over until the nextday, staked my claim, and here I am, practicallybroke, rather hungry, but more than pleasedwith my life and surroundings."What are you going to do if you haven'tsufficient money to .outfit you while you areworking it?" She asked him."Well, that's the question that has been puzzling me," he said. "Of course, if it's only aplacer deposit it will only require a very simpleequipment. The main thing is to secure supplies,so I guess I'll get a job on a ranch for the nextthree months, and then get busy.""Why not come over to our place? I heardfather say yesterday that he could use a couplemore men.""I surely would be glad to go back thereagain, and I will ride over from Wharton tomorrow and ask him for a job."Frances rose and said, "It's time that I wasmaking for the ranch. My pony is hobbled overin that little canyon, and we can ride part wayback together."When Jim left Frances Owens and tookthe trail for Wharton, he had already cometo the conclusion that there were elements inlife sweeter than the "Call of the Wild." Thenext day he rode over to the Owens ranch andwas readily given a job, for, despite his wandering instincts, Jim Bennett was not only a firstclass cowboy in every respect, but everything hedid do he did well. He did not see anything ofFrances, for he was immediately sent to ride oneof the northern boundaries of the ranch. Thishad been a rather severe disappointment to him,for the girl fever was rapidly displacing the goldfever in his mind. While the post he had wasonly seven or eight miles from the ranch, itrequired at that particular time of the year themost constant vigilance, so that he had to literally sleep on the job and could not get into theranch house.Jim Bennett, riding his pony at a walk, withhis hands in the pockets of his "chaps," his Stetson on the back of his head, was laying bare thesecrets of his heart to his broncho, and that apparently disinterested animal, of course, had tolisten. "It's another case of man's inhumanity toman, old fellow," he said, "for here I am withina few miles of the sweetest girl on earth, andI might just as well be in Europe." Just thenhe, in the distance, caught sight of a rider approaching him. There seemed somethingstrangely familiar in both the pony and rider,and his inertness gave away to instant vigilance,as he set his pony at a rapid lope to meet theapproaching figure. Sure enough it was her, andas they drew up alongside, she greeted him andsaid: "Were you surprised to see me, Mr.Benett?""Yes, most happily surprised.""Aunt Emma had one of her bad headaches thismorning and I was lonely over at the ranch andI knew that you were lonely out here, so I concluded to come out and 'ride fence' with youfor a couple of hours."During the next three weeks Frances Owens"rode fence" with Jim a number of times. Thenhe was relieved of his station and given anotherone which brought him into the home ranchevery day.Several of the cowboys possessed good voicesand there were occasional evenings of music upat the ranch house. Jim and Frances were bothdearly in love with each other, but Jim knewthat while Frances' father, David Owens, waskind to the boys, he was gruff and overbearing,and, if Frances showed any decided regard forany one of the boys, he would most certainly besummarily discharged. While no outspoken expression of love had been exchanged by them,they had become "Frances" and "Jim" to eachother. There was a secluded little nook over nearthe well-house that they both agreed about thenicest little spot on earth to meet for an occasional chat, unobserved by any prying eyes, andone evening they came to the mutual conclusionthat future existence without each other wouldbe absolutely impossible. This agreement wassatisfactorily signed and sealed. Jim told herthat he never ought to have spoken of his loveto her because of his precarious financial condition. But Frances told him that she was notfearful of his not succeeding in life and that anyhow she knew of it without his telling, and thatif he had not told her very soon, she would haveseen to it that he did. The very next evening,however, those meetings were brought to anabrupt termination, for, as they were bidding eachother good night, Dave Owens suddenly appearedon the scene and a fearful outburst of parentalwrath ensued. They both attempted to remonstrate, but Dave Owens would not listen. Heturned to Jim and said: "You get your time,young fellow, and hike, out of here in the morning. When the time comes for my daughter tomarry, I want her to marry something besideshealth and good looks. That goes with you forall time."Jim left the next morning without having anopportunity to say good-bye to Frances, but hedetermined to see her again in the near future.He knew that the owner of the adjoining ranchdisliked Dave Owens intensely, so he rode overthere and laid his case before him and wasreadily given a. job, for the rancher welcomedthe opportunity to help anybody do anythingthat Dave Owens did not like, and even went sofar as to have his housekeeper ride over to theOwens' ranch and arrange a meeting betweenJim and Frances, unknown to anyone. Jim hadwritten a letter to Frances in which he statedthat he expected to go up and work his mineand that he hoped for success in a short time,and that if he succeeded he would try to induceher father to change his mind. The letter waswritten with the sole idea that it would be intercepted by Dave Owens as it was so that noespionage would be exercised over Frances andthus prevent their meetings. Nearly a monthfollowed and they had met a number of times,when Jim said to her, "Dear, I've got aboutenough together now to give me a start, and Iam going up to the mine tomorrow."(Continued on page 12.)10THE MONTHLY MAGAZINEt$J t$J t$J $ tJJ t $J;qemC?3 J CJ3 J3 Cg3 IJJ C?3Cooking by Scientific Methods FoodHUMANITY can never be elevated until weteach men and women how to live. Homeswill be made happier by doing away withthe slavery of the stove. We must work on theunit of the family in order to develop this simpleart of nutrition.We may regard food as the power of life uponwhich the power of man to sustain himself whollydepends, and if the measure or the quantity of foodis ncrt rightly adjusted to the conditions of completenutrition, both manual and mental efficiency of manwill be impaired. If the force which is generatedby the assimilation of food is inadequate to the complete support of man, he will become incapable ofproducing the results upon which his earning capacity depends. Therefore, since life is a conversionof force, care must be taken in supplying the bodywith the proper conversion of force.The body must be sustained and nourished byfood. The following are the thirteen elements foundin the body: oxygen, 62l2 per cent; hydrogen, 10per pent; carbon, 2y2 per cent; nitrogen, 3 per cent;calcium, potassium, phosphorus, sulphur, chlorine,sodium, magnesium, iron and flourine, 3 per cent.The food taken into the body must contain theelements found therein in order to sustain it, andmake the child grow, and supply the adult with sufficient energy for his daily work. A chemical changeis brought about in all foods by the digestive systembefore it can be utilized by the body.There are two classification of foods :Inorganic J $" matter'Proteid.Organic -I Carbohydrates.Fats and oils.Protein forms tissue (muscle, tendon, etc., andfat) and serves as fuel; fat forms fatty tissue (notmuscle, etc.) and serves as fuel; carbohydrates aretransformed into fat and serve as fuel, all of whichyield energy in form of heat and muscular strength.Alcphol does not form tissue, but does serve asfuel ; tea and coffee (thein, etc.) do not form tissue,do not serve as fuel ; extractives (meat extract, beeftea) do not form tissue, do not serve as fuel, andthese have various actions upon brain and nerves.Milk, eggs, cheese, meat, fish, cereals, beans, lentils and peas are all tissue builders, albumin beingthe principal constituent of the proteid matter.This important substance is known as albumin inthe egg; casein in the milk and cheese; vegetablecasein in peas, beans and lentils; and in the wheat,glutine ; gelatine in the bones and gristle in the meat.The carbohydrates supply heat and maintain ourenergy; they are found in the starch, sugars, oilsand fats. We get our salts from the mineral matter.Diet.The diet of one in normal condition should beregulated by age, sex, occupation, climate and season.For instance, a child should not have starchy fooduntil the teeth appear, as before this period thereare no ferments developed to digest such food. Lessfood is required by women than by men. Brainworkers should take easily digested foods, such aseggs, fish, etc. The laborer needs quantity, and forthe reason that he is out in the open air foods likecorned beef, cabbage, cornbread, etc., do not overtaxhis digestion. In old age the diet must again become simple.Water.Water (H20) is of the utmost importance andvery necessary, but it should be free from diseasegerms. In the cities this matter is taken care of bythe health officer, and those of the rural communities will profit greatly by keeping clean their cisterns,wells, etc. m Soft water is best for use in the household, as it is free from salts and lime. Water freezesat 32 degrees F. and boils at 212 degrees F., but in a5?gI? ajtitude it boils at a lower temperature. Asdistilled water contains no organic impurities, it isbest for medical purposes. One should drink plentyof water between meals, but not while eating as itprevents the gastric juices of the mouth from performing their proper function in the digesting ofthe starchy foods.Salt.Common salt, or sodium chloride .(NaCl) isfound abundantly in the body; it assists digestion inthe furnishing of hydrochloric acid found in the gastric juices.Starch.The vegetable kingdom is replete with starch(C8Hio06) and it is most abundant in cereals andpotatoes. Starch serves as an important heat andforce producer. It will not sustain life alone, butis most important and must be taken in conjunctionwith foods that repair and build up the tissues.Sugar.Sugar (djHaO,,) is equally as important a factoramong foods as starch and serves the same purposes. However, all starch must be converted intosugar before it can be assimilated. Cane sugar orsucrose is obtained from sugar cane; grape sugar orglucose from honey and sweet fruits; milk sugaror lactose from milk and does not ferment.Fats and Oils.In both the animal and vegetable kingdom we findthe fats and oils; they contain stearin (solid), olein(liquid), palmatin (semi-fluid). Cream and butter,being more easily assimilated, are of the first importance in the animal fats.In the cod liver and yolk of eggs we obtain ouranimal oils; the vegetable oils being found in theolive, cottonseed, poppy and the cocoanut, and fromthe various nuts.Fats may be heated to a high temperature, asconsidered in cookery they have no boiling point.Y5en aPPearinS to bil it is evident water has beenadded, and the temperature lowered to that of water212 degrees F.Milk.Composition. Proteid, 3.4 per cent ; mineral matter, 7 per cent; fat, 4 per cent; water, 87 per cent;lactose, 4.9 per cent.The value of milk as a food is obvious from thefact that we find in it all that is required for thefood of the young during their most rapid growth.There is some danger, however, in overestimatingits value in the dietary of adults, as solid food isessential and liquid taken should act as a stimulantand a solvent rather than as a nrtrient. One getsthe most benefit from it taken at regular intervalsrather than at meals. Hot milk is often given toproduce sleep. Iced milk is not good for the reasonthat the cold reduces the action of the digestive organs by lowering them below the normal. It is notgood to give milk and meat at the same time, butrather combine them with a starchy food. In themilk we find lactose, casein and mineral matter. Thewater varies according to the adulteration. Whenmilk is allowed to stand for a few hours the globulesof fat, which have been held in suspension throughout the liquid, rise to the top in the form of cream ;this is due to the lower specific gravity. The difference m quality of milk depends chiefly on thequantity of fat therein. A germ found in the airattacksa portion of the lactose in the milk, converting it into lactic acid ; this, in turn, acts upon thecasein (proteid) and precipitates it, producing whatis known as curds and whey.In feeding infants with milk, sterilization orpasteurization is sometimes recommended to avoiddanger of infectious germs. By this process milkcan be kept for many days, and transported if necessary. To prevent acidity of the stomach, add fromone to two teaspoonfuls of lime water to each halfpint of milk. Lime water may be bought at anydruggist s or easily prepared at home.Lime Water. Pour two quarts boiling waterover an inch cube of unslacked lime ; stir thoroughlyand stand over night; in the morning pour off theliquid that is clear, and bottle for use. Keep in acool place.Butter.Fat, 93 per cent; mineral matter, 95 per cent:water, 5.34 per cent; Casein, 71 per centiButtr of co!?merce is made from cream of cow'smilk. The quality of butter depends upon the wayin which it is made and the manner or, and care infeeding. Butter should be kept in a cool place andwell covered, otherwise it is liable to become rancid.This is due to the albuminous constituents of theHF'M f J?k 3SSBBBX,ir 3agr;, ai i 3f tfHA Z&m7 ; s"Vmilk, acting as a ferment, setting free the fattyacids. Butter should never be worked enough tospoil the grain of the butter. Fresh butter spoilsquickly ; salt acts as a preservative. Butter which hasbecome rancid by too long keeping may be greatlyimproved by heating, and quickly chilling with icewater. The butter will rise to the top and mav easilvbe removed.Cookery.Cookery is the art of preparing food for thenourishment of the body. Much time has been givenin the last few years to the study of foods, theirnecessary proportions and manner of cooking them.Educators have been shown by scientists that thisknowledge should be disseminated; as a result,Cookery" is found in the curriculum of publicschools of many of our cities and towns.m Food is cooked to develop new flavors, to makeit m more palatable and digestible, and to destrovmicro-organisms. Correct measurements are absolutely necessary to insure the best results. Some,owing to their good judgment and experience, areable to measure by sight, but the majoritv needdefinite guides.Flour, meal, powdered and confectioner's sugarand soda should be sifted before measuring. Mustard and baking powder, from standing in boxes,settle, therefore should be stirred to lighten; saltfrequentlylumps and these lumps should be broken:A cupful is measured level. To measure a cupful,put in .the ingredients by spoonfuls or from a scoop,round slightly, and level with a caseknife, care beingtaken not to shake the cup. A tablespoon is measured level. A teaspoon is measured level.. To measure tea or tablespoonfuls, dip the spoonin the lngredientfill, lift and level with a knife, thesharp edge of lenife being toward tip of spoon. Divide with knife with lengthwise of spoon, for anail spoonful; divide halves crosswise for quartersa" u.SUaJters crosswise for eights.

He toldher of the possible hardships thatshe would have to undergo, but shewould listen to none of his arguments. She told him that she hadconsidered everything and that if hewanted her at all he must take hernow. Of course, that settled thematter, and so it was arranged thatJim should meet her the next morning, and that she should get some ofher clothing from the house thatnight and should secrete themsomewhere where she could getthem the next day without beingobserved.When they met the next morningJim said to her, "Dear, we are starting now on life's journey together,and it shall be my sincere endeavorall through that journey never tolet you regret the step you are taking." And so they rode intoWharton and were married, andafter the ceremony Jim went outto purchase some camp equipmentand a broncho to carry it, whileFrances wrote a farewell letter toher father, which she expected tomail in the morning, for it wastheir idea to stay over night atWharton and get an early start forthe three days' trip to the mine.It happened, however, that these arrangements were to be summarilyupset, for Dave Owens, returningfrom the southern boundary of hisranch, met a cowboy on a neighboring ranch, who had just returnedfrom Wharton, who told him thathe had passed Jim and Frances nearWharton. The old man gathered acouple of his cowboys and wentafter them, vowing summary vengeance on Jim's head, and he clattered into town just at the timewhen Jim and Frances were finishing their wedding supper. The sonof the hotel-keeper saw them asthey were coming into town andwith the greatest haste possiblemade for the hotel and told Jimthat Dave Owens was in town andlooked crazy-mad."We must get a move on us then,Jim," said Frances, "and get out assoon as possible."No, dear," said Jim, "you're mywife now, and neither your fathernor anyone else can separate us.""That's true, Jim, but rememberthat he is my father, and that I lovehim dearly, and that I don't wantyou to come to blows, so if we canget away let's do it."Jim reluctantly consented and,aided by the hotel-keeper, they hastily packed their equipment andstarted for the mine.Meanwhile Dave Owens hadlearned of the marriage and of thepurchase of the camp equipment andof the fact that they were at thehotel, and he reached the hotel halfan hour after they had left. As itwas dark he was unable to find outin which direction they had goneand lie concluded to wait untilmorning.Meanwhile Jim and Frances, bothinured to the saddle, rode until pastmidnight, when they determined torest their horses and start out againin the morning, and so they rode offthe trail and camped for the night.In the morning Dave Owens andhis cowboys endeavored to find inwhich direction the couple hadgone. Both of the cowboys weresecretly in sympathy with Jim andtheir efforts were not very strenuous, so that Dave Owens finallygave up the search as hopeless.The next day Jim and Francesstarted early on their trip to themine. They looked back along thetrail as far as they could see, butsaw no sign of any pursuit. Theystopped to rest their horses for anhour at noon and at three o'clockthey were within a few miles ofBig Canyon, where they expected tocamp for the evening. They hadjust topped a rise in the trail whenJim, looking back, saw two ridersriding fast along the trail. In thedistance the foremost looked likeDave Owens and the horse lookedlike the broncho that he usuallyrode."That looks like your father,Frances. I think that we had betterget into Big Canyon as fast as wecan, for we can lose him there," andso they covered the next ten milesinto Big Canyon with all the speedpossible. When they reached theentrance of Big Canyon, they couldsee nothing of the riders, but Jimdetermined to take no chances, andthey rode up the canyon for nearlya mile to where the canyon widened out into a little rock-strewnplain. From this little plain thesides of the canyon sloped gradually up to the top, broken by occasional little terraces, and Jim determined to make his camp for thenight on one of these terraces. Thehorses were tethered behind a littleclump of trees, where they couldnot be seen from the trail. Jim cutsome boughs from the trees andmade a comfortable bed and then,taking his water bottles, went downto the little stream that woundthrough the canyon to fill them. Hebarely had time to reach the streamwhen Frances, glancing down overthe plain, saw a man with a revolverin hand coming across it. She sawthat it was not her father nor oneof their cowboys, but, fearing that hemight mean some harm to Jim, shedrew her revolver and exclaimed inas manlike tones as she could assume, "Hands up." The answer wasa report from the stranger's gunand she fell forward unconscious onthe sloping side of the terrace.Jim had just finished filling hiswater bottles when he heard theshot and, running around the edgeof the canyon, was met by the command of "Hands up," and saw a manstanding behind a large boulder witha revolver pointing toward him. Hethrew his hands up, but continuedrunning toward the stranger.What's your hurry?" the manasked him.'Who was that shooting?" Jimanswered excitedly."I'm the guilty party, my friend,"he replied. "You see, someone whowas probably your side partnermade an effort to hold me up alittle while ago, and I indulged in alittle rapid fire target practice. Idon't think he'll hold anybody elseup in a hurry."Jim's face grew white as a sheet."For God's sake, man, did you killher?""Her? What do you mean? Ibelieve that I killed someone, forthere he" lies on the terrace overthere.""God, man," answered Jim. "Thatwas my wife.""Your wife?" he shouted runningtoward Jim, whose hands were stillup. He grabbed Jim's gun fromhis belt and said, "She may not bekilled. Let's get over there asquickly as possible."Jim reached Frances' side andsaw that her face was covered withblood and that one arm was bentunder, apparently broken. Her hathad fallen off and Jim knelt by herside and laid his head to herbreast. He felt her heart beat andjumping up said, "She's not dead;straighten out her arm and stopthat flow of blood." Then he dashedoff for some water. When he returned he found that Frances wasjust recovering consciousness. Thestranger had wiped the blood fromher face, and ho said, "My bullethas just creased the top of her headand her arm was apparently brokenfrom the fall, but I don't think thatshe is seriously hurt."Jim knelt down and took Frances'head in his arms, while the strangerbathed the wounds. Frances lookedup at Jim with a tender smile in hersweet eyes, and said to him bravely,"don't worry, Jim, I'll be all rightnow."The stranger, with tremblingvoice, said, "you can't imagine howdeeply I regret this. I was in herelooking for cattle rustlers andthought I saw one. I have somemen and horses down at the mouthof the canyon, and we'll take herover to the Wells' ranch. He is apretty good doctor and his wife isthe finest kind of a nurse."So they bound Frances' arm to herside and carried her toward themouth of the canyon.

Mich.Herbert Anderson.A story that Irvin Cobb likes to tellis that when he left his native townand went East to make his name andfortune and was introduced as "Cobb,of Paducah," a frequent query was:"Paducah is that the name of a drinkor a recently discovered disease?"Most everybody that knows Cobb nowknows that Paducah is the metropolisof West Kentucky, the home of "JudgePriest," and that there Mr. Cobb hasfound the inspiration for many of hisbest stories and humorous sketches.To use a bromide, Cobb put Paducahon the map.There is another man in the countrynear Paducah who will bring addedfame to the town in a few years, aswell as to the state. Ask anyone youmeet what Kentucky is noted for, andthe answer will be: For its prettywomen, fine whiskies and fast horsesand tobacco. In a very short time theknowing ones will reply: Its prettywomen, fine apples at least, chivalrous men will .place the ladies first,and deservedly, too fast horses andtobacco. The days of whiskey seem tobe numbered, since the greater portionof Kentucky is now "dry." The commonwealth will always be famed forits tobacco, but recently it has beendiscovered that the apple is a BIGpossibility and destined to be a leadingcrop in a short time.A good deal of credit for this isdue to one man just out of PaducahHerbert Anderson. Mr. Anderson hasawakened the people of his section andall over the state to the fact that hisimmediate neighborhood raises thefinest winesap apples grown in theUnited States. He has been doing itfor years, but, like the prophet we areoft told of, the folk in his own country did not give him honor. Anderson's apples have been known to theAgriculture Department at Washington, where they have been declaredto be the best of their character ofwhich it has record, and they havereceived equal recognition from theApple King, PaxtonKentucky agricultural authorities atLexington. Writing in the InlandFarmer, Lowell Roudebush, an authority, says: Kentuckians Don'tforget this: For the forty-ninthtime we have said it your state isgreat in fruit possibilities. In1912 the finest winter apples of theirvarieties I saw were in McCrackenCounty, in the Purchase. Just think ofit! Better than I saw in New York.All because there was a man behindthem.""The man behind them" was HerbertAnderson. In the year Mr. Roudebushspeaks of, Anderson gathered nearly12,000 bushels of apples from twelveacres. Any man who knows the valueof a good winesap apple can easilycompute what the return was. In telling the story of how he learned toraise apples, Mr. Anderson said whenhe first started out to farm, as a youngman, he planted three acres in applesfor his table use. "I have always contended that anything you do should receive all of your thought and energy.So I started out with those baby treesto tend them as carefully, as painstakingly as I could, and soon learnedit was quite a task. Each season taughtme more and more. At first I did notsucceed, but in fifteen years now I havenever had a failure. All that is necessary in this community to raise fineapples is knowing how and working. The job can't be delegated tothe hired man. It needs scientificattention. Give the proper culture,fertilizer, pruning and spraying andNature will do all the rest. Thecrop is sure and certain. We,down here, do not have to artificially heat our orchards to protectfrom Spring frosts. We give ourtrees the necesssary vitality, andthe frosts we have do not injurethem at all."Mr. Anderson has a great manytrees on his place producing 25 to30 bushels each, and at $1.50 abushel, it is easy to figure theyield in dollars and cents. He is acrank about his trees receiving theproper attention, and it is doubtfulif the most devoted mother visitsmore attention on a favorite childthan he does on all of his trees. Ofcourse, to this is due in a measureof his success. Like all successfulfruit growers, he has done some experimenting and he has developeda seedling from a Rome Beautywhich he calls "The Paducah" thatapple dealers declare will makePaducah famous. It is a splendidapple in every way and comes justat a time when there are no otherapples on the market in Augustand commands not less than $2.50a bushel at the orchard. It is predicted by those who profess toknow that almost all America willbe eating "The Paducah". beforelong. Then Mr. Cobb can tellthose who are inquisitive aboutPaducah that it is something goodto eat.AisllllllslllllllSslBsllK&viBlKslBBBtlBBBSSBBBBBBfI " vHEvl''HlbjBs9Sav90BVMiNMBHSSBBBBvTwo Baskets of Apples!Both grown in the same orchard, on two treesthat had the same natural advantages.

I'll ride with you over toWells' ranch and we will take turnscarrying her, and take our thirdhorse for a remount. It's twentyfive miles over there, and we wantto get her there just as quickly aspossible."The horses had been hastily saddled and Jim mounted one. Woodhanded Frances up to him and theystarted on their ride to the ranch.Jim's heart ached as he looked downat the precious burden he bore. Thesight of the bandaged head, thebroken arm and the little pale facealmost made him sick, but he saidto her, "I know it's tough, sweetheart, but in a little while you willbe more comfortable."She nodded back to him and heheard her say in low tones, "I'mgame, Jim."And so by turns they carried herfor five hours until they reachedthe ranch, where Mr. and Mrs.Wells immediately took her incharge, and in a short time she wasresting comfortably. The break inher arm was not a serious one andin three weeks she had entirely recovered. In the meantime Jim andWood had become great friendsand Jim told Wood the story of hiselopement and of the incidents leading up to its and of the discoveryof the mine. Wood insisted on Jimaccepting a loan sufficiently largeto purchase a better equipment thanhe had and to provide more comfortably for Frances. He said tohim, "You surely can't refuse to letme do this, old fellow, for I havefelt terribly over this accident, andit will relieve me to know that Ican do something toward makingthe future a little easier for you."And when Jim saw how mucfiWood took it to heart, he finallyconsented to accept the money provided Wood would accept a share intheir venture. He wanted to go upto the mine first and get thingsready for Frances, but she wouldnot listen to it. "I want to be withyou at the start, dear," she said. Itwill only be a few days now."And so they waited until she wascompletely Recovered. Mrs. Wellshad grown to love Francis verydearly and was loath to see her go,and Mr. Wells insisted on sendingone of his cowboys with them tohelp build their little cabin and getthem started.He said to Jim before he started,"if you don't strike it very rich upthere, Jim, I know where a fortunecan be made in Wyoming. I havegotten in on an irrigation deal, andwould like to have you and Francescome up there."It only took a few days to reachthe mine and to build a little logshack, Frances helping the two menwith willing hands. When it wasalmost completed Jim sent the cowboy back to the ranch, and he andFrances finished it."It's rather a poor home to bringa bride to." He said."Why, it's fine, Jim." She answered. "It's a home enough forme with you."Before they had worked manyweeks, they saw that the depositdid not amount to much. What little gold there was in the sand hadto be washed carefully. Thereseemed to be just a little pocket ofplacer deposit, for Jim could findno evidences of gold in the streamabove or below, so that all they hadto show for several weeks' hardwork was about one thousand dollars' worth of gold dust, and thepocket was almost exhausted. Jim'sknowledge of mining taught himthat there must be gold somewherein the neighborhood and he spentseveral weeks vainly endeavoring tolocate it. The weeks, however, hadbeen ones of intense happiness tothe young couple, and both agreedthat they enjoyed their honeymoonthere more than they would haveanywhere else. Mr. Wells had senta messenger up to the mines severaltimes to find out how they wereprogressing, and he brought themsuch supplies as they wanted. Jimhad written down and borrowed ashotgun and fishing outfit from theranch. Even the cowboy messengerdid not know what their purposewas in living in the mountains, forJim did not want any of the outsideworld to know of the possibilities ofgold in there until he had thoroughlyinvestigated it. They had madelittle picnics of their prospectingtrips and sometimes left the cabinfor two or three days at a time andon these trips they would take theirgun and fishing rods with them, forthere were quite a number of littlemountain streams in which troutwere plentiful. Thus, they spentthe first winter of their married lifeand finally came to the conclusionthat in the spring they would acceptMr. Wells' offer to go to Wyoming,and so informed him by the messenger who came up late in thewinter.On one of these jaunts they hadseen from a mountain, some fifteenmiles west of their camp, a beautiful little valley and they had determined to visit it at some futuretime, so Jim proposed that they goover to the valley and put in a fewdays, and then pack up and go downto the Wells' ranch. They foundthe little stream almost alive withfish, and Jim had just hooked apound and a half trout, when heheard Francis, who was fishing alittle down stream, call to him excitedly. He ran to her. She wasstanding by a riffle and pointing excitedly toward the stream, she said,"Whats' that, Jim?""What?" he answered. "Gold, byjove," and examining further foundtraces of it quite a way down thestream. "It looks as though wewill have to change our minds aboutWyoming, for a while anyhow, forI believe there is enough gold tokeep us busy for some time." Sothey determined to build anothercabin over in the valley and movetheir camp there. On their returnto their cabin they found the cowboy messenger with letters fromWood Shelby. He had gone towork on a neighboring ranch, theBar-J, and his letter was not written in his usual cheerful manner, soJim wrote to Wood and urged himto join them, and told him of theirstrike and that they would wait atthe cabin for him. Wood hadgrown very tired of ranch life anddecided that even if they found nogold that a few weeks in the mountains would help him materially, sohe appeared at the camp a weeklater, bringing with him a plentiful supply of provisions. The campwas moved, over to the little valley,where another cabin was built, andfor six months all three worked industriously at placer mining, andthe little stream was thoroughlywashed for several miles, but nofurther traces of gold could befound. They prospected industriously for two more months, butunsuccessfully, and Jim proposedthat, as they had about twenty-fiveor thirty thousand dollars' worth ofgold dust, they break up camp andtry civilization for a while. Jim andFrances went to an Eastern cityand Wood went up to Wyoming tovisit Wells and look into the irrigation scheme. He was so well satisfied with the result of his investigation that he wrote to Jim and theyinvested their joint holdings in several hundred acres of irrigated land,built a comfortable home and thoroughly equipped themselves foragricultural life. Their venture wasexceedingly prosperous, and DaveOwens has completely forgiven theelopement and spends the happiestmoments of his life with Jim andFrances at their Wyoming home.We Can Make That Old Hat Look Mighty GoodHATSSOFTSTIFFSILKCLEANED, DYEDBLOCKEDRETRIMMEDPanamas and Straw HatsBleached and BlockedANY STYLE ANY SIZESend Your Hat to Us or Write Us About itJOHN T.

Detroit"Sik & StiSffSNNote the Streamline Body the Handsomest Car of the YearThis Six Costs Less Than FoursWeighs Less Costs Less to OperateThis year the HUDSON announcesa Six which greatly affects the wholemotor car situation.The price is $1,750, so it much undersells any comparable Four.The weight is 2,980 pounds, so it muchunderweighs Fours of similar capacity.And it costs much less to operate thanFours of equal size and power.It weighs, for instance, 400 poundsless than the four-cylinder HUDSON"37", the best four cylinder-car that everwent from this factory. Yet the wheelbase is 123 inches, and there are twoextra tonneau seats.It consumes one-fourth less fuel thanthe HUDSpN "37", yet it has morepower. This is due to a small-bore,long-stroke motor a European innovation.It shows an equal or a greater savingcompared with any other same-class Four.The Day of SixesAs everyone knows, the trend is toward Sixes. There are now 38 makerswhose best car is a Six, and 1 4 of themnow build Sixes exclusively.Last year, hardly a four-cylinder carwas sold at a price which would buy agood Six.Men changed from two cylinders tofour to get more frequent power strokes.Now, to get continuous power, they arechanging from Fours to Sixes.To get smooth-running Sixes men paida high price, carried heavy weight, paidextra fuel cost.Now this is all changed. In the newHUDSON Six-40, all these things arein favor of the Six. The Four is nowthe extravagant car. The Six, with allits other advantages, is also the moreeconomical.Mr. Coffin. Did ItThis HUDSON Six-40 is the latestachievement of Howard E. Coffin, ourgreat engineer. It was he who built thefirst high-grade Four to sell under $3,000.Then the first to sell under $2,000. Itwas he who built the HUDSON Six-54,the first high-grade Six to sell under$3,000. Last year that car became themost popular Six in the world.Now he builds this Six-40 the firstquality Six to sell under $2,000. Thefirst to under-weigh, and the first to showless operative cost than Fours of equalpower.New Ideals in BeautyThis HUDSON Six-40 has the newstreamline body. No angles at the dash.This accords with European vogue, andEurope always sets the body fashions.The old-type bodies will soon be out-of-date.The gasoline tank is in the dash. Theextra tires come ahead of the front door.All hinges are concealed. There are twodisappearing extra tonneau seats. Allinstruments and gauges are within reachof the driver.There is a "One-Man" top, coveredwith Pantasote, with quick-adjustable sidecurtains. A rain-vision windshield, dimming headlights, left-side drive, Delcopatented system of electric starting andlighting.The design and equipment are almostidentical with the new HUDSON Six54. And that we consider the handsomest car of the year. Up to sixmonths ago, no car at any price offeredso many attractions.Hudson dealers everywherenow have this car on show. Writeus for Howard E. Coffin's 55-pagebook, and we will direct you whereto see the car.
