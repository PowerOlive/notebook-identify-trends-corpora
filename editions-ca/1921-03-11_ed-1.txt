Gresham, who wasthe first American soldier killed inFrance. The statement was made atthe Gresham Memorial Home, which,WFiS presented to her by the patrioticpeople of Indiana as.an evidence oftheir appreciation of the servicesrendered to his country by her son.The shock of her son's death resulted in a serious breakdown inMrs. Dodd's health, but every onewill learn with interest and pleasurethat she is now in splendid healthagain. Mrs. Dodd gives the entirecredit for her recovery to the celebrated medicine, Tanlac.She said: "After my dear boy'sdeath I had a general breakdown inhealth. At first it was just indigestion. My food would upset me andI had to diet myself very carefully.I also had rheumatism with severepains in my shoulders, back and armsand at times I would suffer greatly,and my joints would become swollenand stiff. I was hardly able to dobut very little about the house andat times could not even cook a meal.I became very nervous and restlessand at night would lie awake forhours.A friend of mine advised-me totry Tanlac. I am glad I did, for itproved to be the best medicine Ihave ever taken. It soon gave jme asplendid appetite and relieved me entirely of indigestion. My rheumatismalso disappeared and I am now ableto do my housework with the greatest ease. My nerves are steady andstrong. I sleep well at night and nnrhealth is better than in years. I shallalways be grateful for what Tanlachas done for me."Tanlac is sold in Paris at the Peo-,pie's Pharmacy.

Nelson, chief of the biological survey, in urging the appropriation, told congress there are about200,000 reindeer in Alaska, of whichabout three-fourths belong to the natives and one-fourth to the government and to- white owners who havestarted a commercial industry in growing reindeer for meat These reindeer multiplied from an original importation of 1,280 animals made 28years ago for the benefit of the Eskimos. "People have asked me what thefuture of the industry is likely to be,"said Dr. Nelson. "I have replied byasking them the question: 4If 1,280reindeer' in 28 years produced thepresent 200,000 animals, what is likely to be the increase from 200,000 animals in the next 28 years?' The increase is almost unbelievable. In other words, the industry, properly handled, should have a great future."The Alaskan firm which has startedthe industry exported 1,600 head toSeattle last year. The firm has established four small cold storageplants at points on the Alaskan coastwhere the reindeer can readily bedriven down for slaughter to be refrigerated and loaded for shipment"I believe Alaska contains availablyrange to maintain from four to fivemillion of reindeer. The estimate hasbeen made that it would take careof 10,000,000, but I think that is toohigh."Five million reindeer would givean average output of about 1,250,000reindeer a year. Dressed for ,marketan animal now averages 150 pounds.Taking this weight and the presentvalue of reindeer meat, the fully developed reindeer industry in Alaskashould yield approximately $43,000,000a year. Reindeer have been in Alaska28 years and their increase undercrude methods of handling has beenalmost startling. Under proper scientific supervision and modern methodsthe industry should develop very rapidly. May Use1 Caribou for Breeding."There are big herds of wild caribou"about the Mount McKinley region,some bulls of which dress up to about400 pounds. We plan to capture somebulls of this stock and use them withan experimental herd of reindeer cowsfor the purpose of building up a higher grade of reindeer, having greaterweight and increased hardiness. 1 believe it will be practicable in less thanten years to have the reindeer of Alaska ruiining from 250 to 300 poundsto the carcass, instead of 150 poundsas at present ,"The increased weight would increase the value of the fully developedAlaska reindeer industry enough' tobring the potential output around 60,000,000 at present value. That is morethan the fisheries of Alaska produce."Stefansson, the Arctic explorer,was here recently. He is interestedin the, lease granted by the Canadiangovernment for a great area for reindeer grazing in Baffin's bay region. Heciinformed me that in the Scandinaviancountries of Europe about 200,000 reindeer are killed for meat each year."We are talking about helping tobuild up Alaska, and here is one thingthat is right in sight today, a line,big industry, and I do not know of anyother like it in the immediate future.The future looks so promising thatthe expenditure which we contemplateis trifling compared with what "theoutcome is likely to be."Found, a gold pin, skull and crossbones, blue stone in one eye, andre'd stone in other.

According to Dr. Robert T. Hill, former state geologist, whohas just finished a study of the topographical features of Texas and ismaking a report on the subject for theUnited States geological survey, untilrecently all existing maps give an inaccurate idea as to the geography ofthe state, particularly with referenceto the courses of the Rio 'Grande onthe South and the Red River on thenorth. Mr. Hill says that all currentmaps of Texas locate the Rio Grande,which has always been accepted as theboundary between this country andMexico, inaccurately. The maps include in Texas a strip of territory averaging 25 miles in width and 75 milesIn length (about 1,875 square miles),which does not belong to it. Until theWorld war, when special surveys ofthe border were made by the War department, nothing was known of theRio Grande district. These maps, sincepublished by the department, revealedthe mistake in currejit maps.No Proper State Map.There is no map published showingeven approximately the physical features of the trans-tfecos section, themountainous portion of the state. Manyof the ranges and peaks are entirelyomitted and others are located inaccurately. Doctor Hill has made a special study of these sections" of the stateand will make known many inaccuracies through the maps he is preparing for the government.The Davis mountains, well known toTexas residents, are not included onany map. They form one of the principal range districts in the state. Tothe west of these mountains is a long,narrow strip of desert country, lowlying valley plains about 200 miles inlength, running along the Rio Grandenorthwest into New Mexico. Thesevalleys are not defined on any maDpublished.n The Diablo country consists of undulating plains, with peaks of varioussizes and kinds, extending into theSacramento mountains of New Mexico.The railroad follows a valley scouredout of the vast plain, extending northwest into New Mexico and southwestinto Mexico. The traveler from ElFaso to the New. Mexico line is alwayseither upon or in sight of this plain forabout 250 miles. The surface is sosmooth, except where it is brokenrarely by peaks, that it seems as levelas a floor. The plain is inclosed onall sides by a wall of higher mountainranges. But none of these featureshas been placed on a map.Based on Settlers' Notes.The county and state maps of Texasare inferior to those of other states,Doctor Hill said, because of the different systems of land survey used inTexas. Inj other' states the land hasbeen accurately surveyed and dividedinto townships and sections. The surveying was done and field notes madeunder United States supervision, asmaps of the country were always necessary to acquire land. The Texassystems were inherited from Mexicoand Spain. Scrips or warrants wereissued to individuals, who went out,took some natural object for a corner,measured off a' block of acres calledfor in the shape and direction chosen,and sent the notesto the land office.Current maps were compiled fromthese notes, made by many individuals,and the topographic information supplied was nearly always meager. ',Up to 1860, when the geological survey began in Texas, there was onlyone point in Texas with its exact location on the earth's surface known.This was a monument to David Crockett, near the old land office, on the capltol grounds at Austin. It was locatedby the United States geodetic survey.About 1880 some women were givinga bazaar for patriotic purposes in Austin. They desired some souvenirs tosell at the bazaar, and at their requestthe old monument was broken intopieces and taken to the bazaar. Thusperished the only point in Texas definitely located on the earth's surface.f SflBHsBBvBSStiSRVry 'WinfPPWSSMyjSBSJBjBSSSSSSJBSSS Si SSSkSbc Sfsi asVSBMBsssSv V ''HvGENUINEBULfDURHAMtobacco makes 50flood cigarettes foriucPRIMARY OPEN ONLY TO THOSEWHO REGISTERED.An independent voter, man or woman, is disfranchised "when it comesto voting in the primaries, a surveyof the law reveals. .

It is not pleasure, butsomething evil that may sometimes beassociated with it, that needs weedingout from our lives; and if sociabilityhad no other claim than the simpleand innocent happiness it creates, itJ would still demand a high place in ourregard.VBe sure and visityour favorite storenext week on theirrJU"".-91st Anniversary!..: :VA great array of Sales Specialsevery day to celebrate thisAnniversary, which lasts fromM6nday, March 14th, to Saturday, March 19thn y(Flu? 3Mpt Slttlltb (JltrouMttESeventh, Race and ShilHto Place .CINCINNATI ;. v",THE UNIVERSAL CARCars Sold in FebruaryJV16 Touring Cars, 2 Trucks, 1 Sedan and2 CoupesBusiness is GoodOur January and February business was good.

The university libraries arejust bringing to a close eight yearsof work on the arrangement of a collection regarded as unquestionablythe best of its kind.Through the acquisition of thismaterial and the way in which, it hasbeen made readily usable, . the university librarians believe that Chicago hereafter will be one of thechief centers, if not the first, for thestudy of the history of the openingof- the American West. The collection and the work on it has thus farcost the university more than $50,-UOU.It is to the history of Kentucky,the first State to be organized west ofthe Alleghanies, that the university'streasures chiefly relate. Its thankefor there being such a collection belong to Col. Reuben T. Durrett, aLouisville editor, who gathered everything about Kentucky that hecould lay his hands on.In many another Western orSouthern State such acquisition?might have an interest chiefly local,but the fact that when the Virginiaemigrants crossed the mountainsinto Kentucky they began the opening of the West, gives their diaries,journals and documents peculiarsignificance.Among the chief prizes of the collection are the minutes of the lastfive conventions, at which the Kentucky settlers asked Statehood. Between 1784 and 1788 they held noless than 11 conventions. The records of the hist district convention,at which the first State constitutionin the West) was drawn up, are to befound here So are also the papersof the first Western Governor. IsaacShelby.One of the choice exhibits of thecollection consists of a plea for support of the adoption of the constitution of the United States, addressedby James Madison, later President,to the Kentuckians. At that earlydate Kentucky was a part of Virginia, and Madison wrote Col. GeorgeNicholas, a Virginian going West,urging him - to get the Kentuckycounties to send favorable delegatesto the Virginia convention that wasto consider adoption of the FederalConstitution. Edward A. Henry, incharge of the collection, reports the&eletters have never been published.More than 200 gallons of whiskywere subscribed for the support pfone of Kentucky's early ministers,according to one of the curiosities ofthe collection. This is a subscription list, passed around in 1807, forthe Rev. Joshua Lacy Wilson, aPresbyterian clergyman of Bardstown, Ky. The pledges totalled 3pounds sterling, 268 shillings, 700pounds of flour, 1,420 pounds ofpork, 25 yards of linen, 100 poundsof beef, 68 bushels of wheat and 2 J2gallons of whisky. Whether or notthe Rev. Mr. Wilson considered thesubscription inadequate or not is notrecorded, but he removed the sameyear to Cincinnati, where from 1807to 1946 he was pastor of the FirstPresbyterian church and a pillar of"Western Presbyterianism. The university has his papers.The most complete record of the"Spanish conspiracy," fcwhich sought,to detach a great part of the Westfor Spain, leading to the final disgrace of Aaron Burr, to be found inthis country is here. vThe universityhas also every printed history ofKentucky, as well as many in manuscript and a great number of diariesof early settlers and travelers.o-SWEAR OFFT"No-To-Bac" has helped thousandsin Vki-oav fVio nncstlv.

It is said that the tv-nmessengers met in the hallway, andafter some discussion decided thebest way for each of the principalsto the quarrel to make the amendhonorable without loss of dignity toeither, was for all hands to adjournto the hotel bar, which was done.While quaffing the fragrant and exhilerating drink' each pledged eternal friendship and the jmatter wasfinally and for all timesettled.Mr. Clark visited Paris aboutthirty years ago, and stopped at thesame hotel, where, surrounded hysome of the older acquainances of hisyounger days, he told vmany interesting anecdotes of his early life inthe Bluegrass.oimssn&sumimffig-WXmJUX UJC XXUU U1UXXJO w-"Warren G.
