given out Friday at the navy department was comprised in the oneshort bulletin posted at the close ofthe day stating that the departmenthad information believed to lie authentic that Adm Cecvera with his Spanish flying squadron was at SantiagoDe Cuba This went to confirm tnenewspaper reports and also the Xladrid cablegram published Friday morning the latter a rather unusual circumstance for the Spanish bullptinsliaTe been notably deceptive ever sincethe flying squadron left CadizAccepting this statement as correctat indicates there is little probabilityf of a hostile meeting between Sampsonor Schley and Cervera immediatelyLooking over the charts of Santiagoiharbor the experts soon discoveredthat the place would be a veritable ratxtrap for the Spaniards with its narrow -entrance in which a single American monitor could bottle up the wholeSpanish fleetThe naval strategy board rechristened of late the war board is tolose one of it most active and valuable members in the person of CaptBarker lie leaves Washington Saturday for Hampton Roaclb to takecommand of the fine protected cruiserNewark which has just been extensively repaired at the Norfolk navy yard Itis expected that the Newark will joinSampsons squadron in the West Indies as soon as she can get there Ithas not been determined who will succeed Capt Barker as a member ofthe war board a place requiring thevery highest professional qualifications and involving a kuowledge ofstrategy as taught scientifically whichas not the possession of all naval officers It may be that the vacancy willnot be filled at present though therelias been favorable mention of thename of Adm Karasay retired in thatconnectionAnother loss to the departmentoccured Saturday when Lieut Gibbonleft to serve as one of Captain Barkersofficers on the Newark This young officer has displayed the greatest energyin securing for the services of the-navy the various naval militia organizations of the states and as an incident to that work he wasobliged to put forth his bestefforts to secure the formationOf new organizations wrherc none existed and additional battalions in thestates that already possessed a navalmilitia The great value of this workis shown by the fact that many of thevessels of the auxiliary navy and mostof the old monitors that have beencommissioned for coast defense purposes are manned almost altogether bythe naval militiamenPreparations go on steadily for thePhilippines military expeditionGen Merritt who will commandstopped in Washington Friday morning on his way westward from NewYork and spent most of the day in- consultation with the officials of thedepartment arranging- the details of-the expedition Another transport wassecured Friday and the department isshowing a disposition to treat GenMerritt with the utmost liberality inthe equipment of his force It is expected that the advance guard on onevessel under the command of GenOtis will sail out of the Golden GateSaturda bound for the PhilippinesThe complaints of theshoeless amongthe volunteers just brought into thearmy will soon be silenced as the department just placed orders for 200000pairs of soldiers shoesA beginning was made Friday toward the organization of the independent volunteer forces under authority conferred upon the president byspecial resolution The national guardwill have no part in these organizations which will be made up of eugineers immunes and electriciansThe staff assignments are comingout rapidly in the general orders issued daily by the department the appointments being made generally upon the request of the major generalsand the brigadier geneials yet to beprovided for in this matterThe navj department is about to callfor bids for a steel floating dock capable of floating a ship of 13000 tons tocost SS09000 and to be located at NewOrleans This dock when completed-will be one of the finest structures in-the country Provision for it wasmade in the naval appropriation billis a result of recommendations of the- naval board headed by Adm BunceAlthough located at New Orleans thedock willbe of that floating type similar to the floating dock at Havana-which can be towed to any point desiredAnother project for docks is contained in the deficiencj7 appropriationbill now before congress This provides for the immediate purchase oftwo floating docks As soon as thebill becomes a law the departmentlcnows where it can purchase thesedocks reacry for service They are atNew York and although of woodand comparatively small they will beof inestimable service on being towedto Key

willbe immediatelyput into effect by the formation of sixregiments of nearly 1000 men eachto be recruited in the gulf states Assurances from that section are to theeffect that these men are practicallyready for mustering in and areawaiting equipment Nearly all ofthem have had military training and confidence is expressed thatthey can be made ready for active service within ten days It is

cares to lagAnd they shout in glee at their mightHither and thither they ever roamXiashing themselves to glistening foamOver the black night seaThey long to leap their rocky boundTo seek the height where freedom is foundTo run with joy oer the sandy moundAnd over the world to fleeThen up and up the granite wallThey hurl themselves bub back they fallDown through the dizzying airUp with a shriek of rage and painThey dash from the crest of the foamingmainClimbing so madly But back againThey fall with a roar of despairThe soul of man would sometimes leapThe environments that round it sweepBut

spoke but when he wasspoken to and then sharp and shortand dry and not a word wasted Heowned when driven into a corner thathe seemed to have been wrong aboutthe crew that some of them were asbrisk as he wanted to see and all hadbehaved fairly well As for the ship hehad taken a downright fancy to her-Shell lie a point nearer the wind thana man has a right to expect of his ownmarried wife Kir But he

belief there was never a shipscompany so spoiled since Noah put tosea Double grog was going on theleast excuse there was duff on odddays as for instance if the squireheard it was any mans birthday andalways a barrel of apples standingbroached in the waist for anyone tohelp himself that had a fancyNever knew good to come of it yetthe captain said to Dr Livesey Spoilfoksle hands make devils Thats mybeliefBut good did come of the apple barrel as you shall hear for if it had notbeen for that we should have had nonote of warning and anight all haveperished by the hand of treacheryThis is how it came aboutWe had run up the trades to get thewind of the island we were after I amnot allowed to be more plain and nowwe were running down for it with abright lookout day and night It wasabout the last flay of our outward voyage by the largest computation sometime that night or at latest beforerioon of the morrow we should sightthe Treasure island We were headingS S W and had a steady breezeabeam and a quiet sea The Hispaniola rolled steadily dipping her bowsprit now and then with a whiff ofspray All was drawing alowand aloftevery one was in the bravest spiritsbecause we were now so near an endcf the first -part of our adventureNow just after sundown when allmy work was over and I was on myway to my berth it occurred to methat I should like an apple 1 ran ondeck The watch was all forward lookyxg out for the island The man at thenehn was watching the luff of thesail and whistling away gently to himself and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea against thebows and around the sides of the shipIn I got bodil imto the apple barreland found there was scarce an appleeft but sitting down there in theiark what vith the sound of the waters and the rocking movement of theship I had either fallen asleep or wason the point of doing so when a heavyman sat down with rather a clash doseby The barrel shook as he leaned hisshoulders against it and I was justabout to jump up when the man beganto speak It was Silvers voice andbefore I had heard -a dozen words Iwould not have shown myself for allthe world but lay there trembling andlistening in the extreme of fear andcuriosity for from these dozen wordsI understood that the lives of all tirehonest men aboard depended upon mealoneCHAPTER XIWHAT I HEARD IN THE9 Jw 1APPLEBARRELNo not I said Silver

sold of the daffodil slept in herhairHe dwelt in the mansion that frowned onthe hillHer cot with the wind and the weatherwas grayBut she flung him a rose from the bush bythe sillAnd he caught it and kissed it one morning in MayHis coat was the finest that money couldbuyAnd a monarch might covet the ring onhis handHer gown was a woolen of soberest dyeAnd her busy brown fingers were roughened and tannedBut he paused to look back by the vinecovered stileAnd he lifted his cap in the courtliestwaySo sweet was her face and so sunny hersmileFramed in by the blossoming branches ofMayThe mettlesome mare in the moonlightwas tiedTo a tree by a little gray house in thevaleAnd her master within had forgotten hisprideAs he knelt and repealed loves rapturoustaleIn sunshine or shadow the prints of his feetWith spur3 on the boot heels were pointed that wayFor the wooing was swift and the winningwas sweetIn the shade of the dew laden lilacs ofMaySo the cottage is left in a tangle of leavesThe mice are at play on the carpetlessfloorAnd the sparrows unstartled peer over theeavesOr roll in the dust hollows close to thedoorThe maiden has gone to the palace of stoneWhere lackeys in yellow and

Chicago Wheat Kins GracefullyGratifies Curiosity of TwoCountry Dealers -1Many a mau in Chicago now enviesJoseph Letter and wishes that he hadbad the foresight and capital sufficientto permit him to embark in a vast wheatdeal And it might seem that such menhave good reason to be envious becausethe young wheat Icing appears to be ingood favor with Dame Fortune at thepresent time But with all the advantages of a knowledge of power a generously large bank account and otherthings which Mr Leiter has gainedthere have come certain disadvantagesChief among these are the cranks andcurious individuals without numberwho have apparently come to the conclusion that Joseph Leiter must have gwarm place in his heart for each andevery one of them Men and womenwith every kind of scheme throng hisoffices in the board of trade buildingand beseech him to aid them in enterprises ranging from putting a perpetualmotion machine on the market to establishing a Theosophist mission amongthe Fi jisTo all of these propositions Mr Leiterusually turns a deaf ear but recently hewas the recipient of a request so uniquein its character that he weakened andmade an answer in the affirmative Hewas seated in his office at the lime andas it was just after luncheon he was ina- very amiable frame of mind A wellknown broker came into the private office and said after a brief apology forintrudingJoe I have a proposition that maystrike you as being rather odd but Iam going to put it to you just the sameI have a couple of country grain dealersdown in my office who have asked me ifit could not be arranged so that theycould just come up and take a look atyou as you sit in your office Theywont talk to you and you need not saya word to them Just let them look atyou It will do them a world of goodto be able to go back to their home townand tell their neighbors that they sawyou Will you do itWell that is an odd proposition replied Mr Leiter but I suppose that itfwont hurt me any to be looked atBring them upThe broker with a relieved expression on his face hurried to the elevatorand soon reappeared with two typicalcountry wheat buyers in tow The menwere ushered into Mr Letters outer office and proceeded to gratify theircsit3r concerning the appearance of theleader of the bulls by gazing at himthrough a glass partition In a few seconds they expressed their satisfactionand retired while the object of theircuriosity turned again to his work as ifnothing had happened Chicago ChronicleWHEN THE MISTRESS IS LADYTlie Higher Education of Women tiShowing a Strong Domestic TzrenrlIn All the j fe-vThe college year now nearingtts closehas a significant importance in the factthat during it the higher education ofthe young woman has shown a strongdomestic trend This has been trueof nearly all the important womenscolleges throughout the land Itis truethat the field has only been enteredBut the beginning has been made andthe domestic course has proven inevery instance heard from the mostpopular innovation of recent yearsThere is only one true solution of the servant girl problem and itmust be shared part and part each bythe servant and mistress Before wecan have intelligent service in ourhomes we must have domestic trainingschools just as we have manual training schools Here and there in ourcountry these schools are springing upand they will multiply fast when theirnecessity and results are better understood and seen Well equipped training schools wiii produce well equippedservice and domestic service willthrough their influence become an artand a profession But while-the servant is undergoing her domestictraining it is equally necessary that themistress should become better acquainted with the domestic arts sothat she may intelligently direct wherethe other intelligently works Thesetwo must go together the one withoutthe other is not enough If the girl ofto day expects when she is a wife thather servant shall do her work in a competent manner she as the mistressmust be competent to direct She mustherself understand the work she asksher maid to do Edward W Bok inLadies Home JournalDancers of PoulticesA medical man calls our attention tothe abuse of poultices and says he hasseen many cases where the applicationof a poultice has done irreparable damage He has known several instanceswhere poultices were applied to abrasions

SquandersIlls TVasres Sometime1- ProxyWhat do the jack tars in the navydo with all their money has oftenbeen asked although most people haveanswered the question to their ownsatisfaction beforehand by decidingthat they spent it the first chance ttheygot Many of the younger or newerones do get rid of tiheir cash at the firstopportunity -but then they spend itthemselves and get their moneysworth or what they think or are madeto believe is their moneys worthThose who are really warm in theirfollowing seldom take all their wagesfrom the paymaster They let himkeep it during the cruise and draw fourper cent interest on it until the cruiseis over Then of course some spendit all before they go back to the shipThey have a good time all in a lumpand are satisfied to wait for extravagant days again until anotfher cruiseis over These are the ment wdio haveno orieT except themselves to care forWhile on the man-of-war they need notgo snort of anything and yet not usetheir money Moreover they wall probably attend to their duties better andhave a much finer time when the cruisais at an endThose who have wives or families orelatives to care for usually send theismoney home regularly and

married simply for whattihere was in marriage in a money waywith the additional advantage or convenience of not having a husbandaround much Unluckily for women ofthis class not all jack tars can

these better halves are adventuresses pure and si mple who makeit a business to get acquainted withnaval men make an impression getmarried and then take the money sentto them and do what they pleasemarry some one else at another navyyard belonging to another ship sometimes and keep track of the cruises ofthe vesselsThe older men seem to fall most-easilybefore the adventuress And whenthey discover their mistake and haveobtained divorces and are free againusually get back into the same boatStill many a woman isa sailors wifewho has not seen him for years whois just as good and true and saving aswoman ever was She takes care ofbaby while he is away and almost diesfor joy when she can meet him at theend of a cruise Sailors too in manycases are just as true to their wivesalthough sometimes with them onlytwo months in three years Thenagain others slave simply that a sonor a daughter a brother or a sistermay get an education and will not haveto work as hard as tfrey do or

into it in such a manner that he remained doubled up until his mother whowas in the next room could come to his rescue In tearing his clothing trom him theskin and flesh came off in strips and themothers hands were badly burned Theskin came off his body from above the middleof the back to below the calves of his legsThe burn was deep and the case desperateFor two months he was under the care of ourfamily physician We then took him to StPaul and acting under his alvice called in oneof the leading surgeons of the city who tookthe case in charge Other physicians werecalled in consultation sixty pieces of skinwere grafted at one time yet notwithstanding all the skill of the doctors and the mostunremitting care two months afterwards allhope had been given up For months hehad lain on pillows with his face down andsuffered terribly He had no appetite andcould retain nothing on his stomachThe sores were indolent and for twomonths had lain perfectly dormant Myattention was then called to Allens UlcerineISalve and in desperation ready to try anything that promised help we commenced itsuse Results were apparent at once It at-once aroused the sores to action and stimulated a healthy discharge We kept theboys strength up with a preparation ofbeefs blood and wine and in about twomonths he was well on the road to recoveryand we were able to remove him back to ourhome Thirteen months from the time hewas iniured he was nerfectlv restored It-- has been over four years since the cure waseffected and the boy is perfectly well and-remarkably strong and active I believethat Allens Ulcerine Salve saved his life aswhen we commenced its use all hopes hadbeen given up and blood poisoning was expected to set in any moment It was fourmonths after he was burned

seasons whenthey are running- up the streams Theure generally made of laths in the formof a V with the apex pointed up thestream Wings are fitted inside asshown in the upper part of cut so asto hold the fish which enter as theyhave the habit of following around thesides and in every instance miss theopening by which they entered andare thus imprisoned and easily dippedout with a hand net This method oftaking fish is mostly used to taite eelswhich always come up streams tospawn in the spring and thus thesetraps are commonly called eel trap-Other fish which spawn in the fail arethus taken at that seasonThere is no reason wlij the trapsslioxild not be made of wire netting-which should not be less than one inchWvivWTriVI 1 uTWO SIMPLE FISH TRAPSmesh so as to let the small fish gothrough except that a good many fishwill get caught in the meshes and diebefore they can be taken out This isan objection against making the wingsof wire for many fish would be caughtby the net and be either lost or be takenout with difficulty The ordinary method is to place a row of stones in theform of wings from the lower end ofthe trap across the stream these turnthe fish to the mouth of the trap whichthey enter rather than try to get overthe stones This however is only possible in shallow streams and in theshallowest parts of the bed The trapis generally set in the deepest waterfor the fish naturally choose this passageway The wire netting1 of coursewould be open to the objection that itAvould catch all the floating trash goingdown the stream and be thus very likely to be broken This might be easilyremoved however and it is the onlyobjection except the cost of it that liesagainst itAnother form of trap for fish is alsoshown in the lower part of the cutThis is a box of any convenient size setin a stream with wings placed to directthe fish to the opening It is open atthe front of course and the top aswell and two rows of bars or in thiscase of wire netting are set across asshown The fish go over the bars andbeing stopped by the end of the trapgo down between the bars and likea chicken hunting the hole in the fencethrough which it got into a garden tryeverywhere but at

liveEtock breeders Prof J A Craig of thelovwi Experiment station spoke onGrowing Sheep The American farmer had two problems to face ingrowingsheep One related to the maintenanceof fertility and the other to the profitsthat were to be reaped The time wasvery opportune to urge upon the western farmers the introduction of sheepNew England had 4300 abandonedfarms Farmers east and south are paying 0000000 a year to maintain thefertility of their soils May we bewarned ere it is too late The greatof pasturing oil such crops asrye rape clover and vetches is becoming more and more apparent No othermethod of providing fertility is equalto it One hundred breeding ewes on afarm will move than maintain the fertility of 100 acres of land pro ided nearly all the food raised is consumed on theland and provided clover to the extentof ten acres per year is one of the cropsgrown From such a flock there shouldbe 800 pounds of wool to sell in thespring and 100 fat lambs to sell in thesummer of 73 pounds each live weightIf the lambs are fed one quarter of apound of oil meal per day it would moreIhan return to the soil all the fertilityremoved by the sale of the lambs Inhis judgment good management wouldbring a return of five to ten dollars perhead from each ewe and the farmermay still maintain his flock without anvdeteriorationA Good Word for SnakesThe snake has few friends but theNew Jersey state board of agriculturehas come to its defense That bod declares that in the state there are buttwo poisonous varieties of reptilesthe rattlesnake and the copperheadboth of which are

iathe Mind of the PublicEver j now and tnen a protest goes upagainst dehorning cattle the motiveput forward is that of humanity sajSthe Wisconsin Farmer In the case ofbreeding bulls we are impressed withthe belief that dehorning should not bedone although it is not motives of humanity that creates this belief Merely as a belief without pretense that itis an ascertained fact we think thatbreeding qualities are likely to be impaired by the sacrifice of the horns inthe case of horned breeds Neitherwould we dehorn pure bred cattlegrown as breeding stock but whenhorns are one of the characteristics ofthe breed we would leave them thereWhen it comes to the question of animals that are to go to the feed lot theyshould be dehorned every time A herdcrowded together as in the feed lot willcommit more cruelties and suffer morea dozen times over by reason ofhaving horns than any that may becaused by the few moments of painwhich result from the operation of dehorning Indeed from our observationof the operation and of the behavior ofanimals while undergoing it we are ofthe opinion that the pain attending itis very much exaggerated in the popular mind No evil consequences followit and even the milk function in cowwhich is so easilv disturbed suffers nodisturbance worth mentioning whencows in full milk are operated uponThose who make these occasional protests pay no attention to the fact thatcastration spaying and the docking oflambs are operations at least as painfuland for centuries more common thandehorning Perhaps this is just thSpoint that they are common All cattle should be dehorned before goinginto the feed lot It makes them quieterand more thrifty the stronger tyrannize less over the weak and all the cattle have more room in the same spacewhen the horns have been removed Inorder to avoid the supposed pain attending the dehorning of animals many advocate the use of caustic potash on thecalf as soon as the buttons can be felton the skull This method is undoubtedly effective and causes but lkilepainif the operation is done carefully andthe caustic not allowed to touch theskinCONVENIENT HOG HOUSESo Arranged That It Has No Equal forWinter and Summer

who madea sale was looked upon as a marvel I hadmy office at that time on the second floorof this building On the main floor werethe offices of Keece Pierce Co I was inthe habit of stopping in each morning andgreeting Col Pierce and usually the greeting became a morning visit One dayI was complaining somewhat bitterly of thedullness of the market and the colonel remarked I tell you that you miss it by notgetting down on the ground floor Now weget a great deal of drop in trade so to speakthat never gets to you becauseof the stairsJust as he was closing this remark thedoor opened and in stepped a man with avalise There what did I tell you said thecoonel Heres a man who probablj wantsto buy a lot and who never would climb upto you I was duly impressed with the truthof the statement then and we both becamesilent as the newcomer avanced As hecame up to us he bowed and smiled and thenblandly inquired Cant I sell either of yousome corn salve to dayThe colonel was almost overcome but hemanaged to express a decided negative andthe visitor retreated When he had closedthe door behind him I burst out laughingand exclaimed Colonel if thats the kindof drop in trade you get doAvn here I
