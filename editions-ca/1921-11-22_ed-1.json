Written by- a master of fiction and played by a cast of
prominent screen players, "Heliotrope" is one of the cinema
sensations of the season. .You cannot see it and not feel bet
ter for the experience.

played by Frederick Burton,, for
nearly twenty years a prominent fig
ure on the American stage. Diana
Allen, formerly one of the Ziegfeld
Follies beauties, and Wilfred Lytell,
