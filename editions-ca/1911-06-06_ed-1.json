MONDAY.
The douhle bill scheduled to be pull
ed off at White Park yesterday after
noon was interfered with by the heavy
rain which began to fall at the con
clusion of the second inning of the
last game put a stop to the further
progress of the game. Three hundred
fans braved the threatening elements
to witness the first double header on
the local lot.
The first game was carried away by
the Bourbonites by a score of 8 to 5,
and in which McKernan and his men
further proved their ability to find
even the most sensational hurlers in
the league. "
ParUs, who a few weeks ago officiat
ed in a no hit affair on the Richmond
grounds, was pitted against the lent
thy Shears. The youthful college sen
sation found the Bourbonites easy
picking until the fifth when they laid
the heavy end of the stick against his
benders, and when the bombardment
Qtihcirfori siv runs had been counted.
In the first four -sessions Parks
whiffed five of the locals before they
had a chance to size up his puzzlers.
Shears pitched steadily throughout the
contest but seven of the total of ten
safeties helped the visitors to count.
Richmond counted first in the sceond
when Haley walked and Davis hit
safely. Haley reached third and scor
ed on Shears' wild heave, Davis going
to second and scoring on ireager s nil
to center. . ,
Six hits counted six runs.for the lo
cals in the fifth. Shears and Harrell
singled and on Haines' muff of McKsr
nan's grounder Shears counted. May
er hit the ball over the fence for a
home run scoring Harrell and McKer
nan. Maxwell doubled and counted on
Barnett's single. Th latter was forc
ed at second on Goodman's grounder.
Kuhlman hit safely and Streiker forc
ed Goodman at third. Kuhlman reach
ed third and scored on Walcen's error.
Shears fanned for the third out.
A "walk, a single and double counted
two mora for the locals in- the sixth,
but in the two innings following "they
were unable to get a man-around. The
visitors counted one in the seventh and
two in the last inning. ' The score :
