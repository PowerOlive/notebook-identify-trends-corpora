TRUMPET ISLAND
99
A Vitagraph Super-Feature with an All Star Cast. Adapted by Lillian and George
Randolph Chester from the Story by Goifverneur Morris.
"Tj limpet Island" is a thrilling story of love and adventure, fashioned after the best style of Gouverneur Morris, from one of whose narra
tives this elaborate pictnrization was made by Lillian and George Randolph Chester, themselves writers of vinternational reputation. Several
months were spent onthe adaptation. Tom Terriss, the director, spent thiee months in California directing the filming of this special, the cost of
which passed the quarter of a million mark. There is an all-star cast, the- members of which made nnusnaL sacrifices of comfort and personal
safety to add impressivehess to the special production. Great care was exercised in selecting the cist. -Hmdreds of extra players appear in
mammoth and palatial sets in which wild midnight orgies of millionaires are shown. It is probably as rich tin spectacukr value as any produc
tion ever transferred to film.
Admission:
Adults 27c plus 3c war tax 30c

TURKEY PRICES ADVANCE
There has been a sadden and sen
sational advance in the prices paid
for tin keys xtn the local market, ac
cording to local dealers. Last week
the market opened at thirty cents
in the county, and thirty-one centy
delivered at the pen. Later it ad
vanced from 31c and 34 c per pound
until this week the quotations were
34c and 35c per pound. Our in
formant did not give any reason fcr
the sudden advance, but the short
crop, and the demand for the birds
may be the principal reason. At
any rate, those who have the birds
for sale are making no close investi
gation into the whys and wherefores.
