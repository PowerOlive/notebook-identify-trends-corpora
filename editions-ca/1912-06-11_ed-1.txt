"She's Boundfor here, and she's paid her way here,and she's sick, too, and she tells meJim sent for her. You lend a handhere, like a good fellow, and help meget her out.""Nobody's home but me.""Then you're boss, ain't you? Andwhat you say goes." He grinned up,at her comfortably. Jet's temper wasfamiliar to him. "She's got to restup some place, and it's thirty milesback to Double Forks.""Why didji't she come before?""Ask" her," said Wilkins".' Most begrudgingly Jet did the honors of' her home to the half-unconsciousstranger. She helped" carry herinto the kitchen, and loosened hermany wraps. She made strong coffee,and winced a little from her own bitterness when she saw how young andsick she was. It is not the game tofight an enemy who is already down.After the man from Double Forkshad driven away, she went silentlyabout her work, while the other woman lay on the bed and watched her.Finally Jet spoke."Well, you got here, didn't you?""I came as soon as ever I could.""Yes, you did!""I did. I started the day after baby came."Jet turned around. "What baby?""Why, ours; mine and Jim's."A pause. Jet looked as if somebody had most swiftly and surelyslapped her in her pretty, aggressiveface."You knew I had a baby, didn'tyou? I wrote to Jim. He might havetold you that much. I guess he didn'tcare, anyhow.""No, he didn't tell me." Jet satdown opposite the bed."When did you tell him about theother the baby?" asked Jet slowly."Not right away. He wrote backhe'd try to send for us both, and toname it after him if it was a boy.""Maybe he meant to." Jet walkedto the open cabin door and leanedher back against the casing. A yearand a half she had lived down atDouble Forks, running a miners'boarding h6use. She was thirty, andamply able to look after hersejf. Herpies and cornbread had followed1 goldstrikes in Neyada for years. And shetrod her way heartwhole until JimBarclay showed up."He got hurt last month. They hadto take him up to Trent, where thecompany's doctor is. He works forthe Kay-Allan outfit, foreman. Yourletter came here while he was gone,so I opened and read it. They saidhe might die, and I sent you themoney to Come on quick, to get hereand see him. So long as you was hiswife, you had a right to be in at thefinish."The other woman was- off the bedbefore the words were fairly out ofJet's mouth, swaying slightly, shecaught Jet's willing hand for support. "But he isn't dead, is he?""What do you care?" Jet lookedat her curiously. "You were marriedto him about two months, wasn'tyou? And then he left you. I. always liked Jim, and I hoped all alongsomething might happen so we couldget married, and swing up furthernorth into some of the provinces andstart all fresh again."I want you to know everythingfirst." Jet rose slowly, and - crossedthe floor of the two-room shack.,"He's in yonder. They brought himup here because it's his place.- He'salive, but he'll never get well again.The company's given him a pension,so he won't starve."She took a hat from a nail, puf. iton her head with a yank forward."Go on in and say hello. I'm goingaway now. Where's the baby?""With my mother home. It's aboy.""And named Jim?" she said, carelessly. "There's some money in hisroom there, in a little buckskin ' sackunder the pillow. It's his, so youcan use it. Goodby. I wouldn't tellhim I sent after you. Men don't haveto. know everything, you know."Listen, you mother of Jim's baby!I meant to jump your claim. And Icouldn't. It was all nicely staked outand guarded. He even told me youmade better pies than mine. Yourpicture's in the inside pocket of thatcoat, and a long curl of hair aroundit. Don't you worry. You send forthe baby quick and call this home. Solong."She stopped at a sound from theother room, the sound of some onewaking, stretching tiredly on acreaky bed, sighing, and cursing softly to himself at pain. Then theyheard him call peevishly, longingly:"Anybody out there?" 'Jet shrugged her shoulders, andsmiled, and walked out of the shack,shutting the door after her softly.She could hear Jinrs laugh as shewent down after her "pony ,Thestaked claim was proved up now.' 'Paris Drops Four Straight fumesBy losing tp Richmoad yesterdayafternoon, Paris suffered the fourthdefeat since last Monday. The scoreyesterday was 7 to G in favor of thePioneers.. The game Sunday afternoonwith the Nicholasvillrf club, in whichthe were drubbd in admirable fashion,being let down with three hits, bearsout the statement made by the Newsthat the local boys are not hitcing unto the.standard, and in esse where hitscome as mere giits they knariablythrow the games away on errors.The local management mbUss thestatement that an effort is heii g madeto strengthen tfie ciub that it may bethe equal of any in the league and begthe indulgence of the fans until thisC3ii be accomplished. According tothe statement good players are scarcearticles this season., and ifcjs a difficultmatter to add men to theioster whoare nutting un the-article of ball thelocal fan? demand.There has been a very noticeableincrease in J.he inteiest manifested bythe "bugs" in the nast week, even inthe face of so many defeats and witha continuance of patronag.. ami a littleencouragement, it is hoped to producea better article of ball, and the resultmay be aother flag for Paris.While it is admitted the Paris team,even the old men. have not been playing up to the standard, it is attributedtothe series of knocks that have beengoing the rounds. The Paris manage;ment as well as others, realize thatParis'is deserving of better ball andit is their intention to strengthen eachdepartment on the club where weakness is very noticeable.President Bacon, who'announcedjlastweek that he had signed an Indianpitcher, stated last night that he wasmaking an effort to get in communication with the fellow, and hoped tohave him here before many days. Ahouitielder by the name of Vaiy. srrivedlast night. Valy, who was to reporton the third of June, has been on theroad for several days. He comesfrom the Ohio State League, but themanagement has not decided whetherhe will be retained since he delayedhis coming for several days.The next game on the local groundswillbe played Thursday, when Pariswill meet the Colts.Paris proved easy picking fur theLawmakers in the opening game of theseries in Frankfort. Friday, the finalscore being 12 to 2. Hauser essayedto hurl the game fo Pans, but afterallowing five runs and six hits, he wasyanked off the mound, and Harold wassent in to finish the contest. The latter fared but little better, and as thecontest wore on, the Lawmakers increased their score. A total of eighteen safe drives was chalked uninfavor of the Lawmakers while Cornell,errective at all stages, kept his hUsdown to seven,(one of the number eing a home run by Locke. The lawmakers stole bases frequently and connected with the ball at times whentheir hits were most needed. Parisscored in the. first inning and again inthe eighth, the tallies being clean cut,while only eight of those secured bythe opposing team were earned. Hauser's ineffectiveness in the first inningseemed to put the entire crew in theair,and the slugfest could not be stopped. In the second game of the series theLawmakers had but little trouble inwinning, the contest resulting in ascore of 7 to 2. The local bo.vs werehelpless before Embry, and could notZurich their hits in sufficient number toovercome the lead. Blankenship started the game for Paris, but was drivenfrom the mound in the first inning.Hauser was then substituted and theLawmakers continued to hit in streaks.The Bourbonites put up an errorlessgame in the field, and played in an admirable fashion, but their weaknesswitb'the stick, coupled with the badinnings in the early stages, was responsible for their defeat.Nicholasville celebrated its first appearance on the Paris grounds underthe new management Sunday afternoonby drubbing the Bourbonites in ahandy fashion, and scoring a completishut-out. Compared with the crowdsof the past two weeks, there was agood number out to witness the contest, which indicated a revival of theinterest in the snort. Burden was onthe mound for the visitors and at allstages of the game was practically invincible, allowing the locals but threehits. Two errors in the third inningallowed the Nicholasville team to scoretwo runs and by consecutive hitting inthe inning following they annexedanother, the score at the close of thecontest standing 3 to 0. After thefourth Blankenship pitched a steadygame, and the men behind him fielded igood, bufBurden was so effective thatthe locals never had a look-in.Perpetuate Old Meanings."Ballot" and "suffrage" show howlanguage perpetuates the memory ofprimitive methods.

Houston Post.Primrose Day.Primrose, day (in England), the anniversary of the death of 'BenjaminDisraeli, Lo,rd Beaconsfield,' had itsorigin in the tribute, a modest wreathof primroses, sent by Queen Victoriafor the funeral of Beaconsfield. Thegeneral impression that the primrosewas Beaconsfield's "favorite" flowercame from a misunderstanding of thewords attached to the queen's tribute:"F. Victoria. His favorite flower." Thepublic thought the queen meant thatthe primrose was Beaconsfield's favorite flower, when in truth she meantthat it was the favorite flower of theprince consort.- Windsor Hotel Clost d..Evan iW.

Not until the horse attempted to draw the vehicle into the buggyapartment through the small doorway,did they realize that something serioushad happened, and upon investigationMr. Rice was found seated in thevehicle, but life was extinctAs the distance from the field to thehouse was very short, and the timeconsumd in making the last trip, itwas evidpnt that he had been dead buta short time, and perhans was seizedwith the fatal attack midway betweenthe house and the field.Abolit two years ago, while engagedin some work upon his farm, Mr. Ricesuffered a slieh- stroke of paralysis,from the effects of which he was confined to his home for some time, butduringthe past several months he hadbeen enjoying exceedingly good health,and last Tuesday made a trip to Paris,where he remained all during the day,and was said by those who saw him,to be in a happy mood., Mr. Rice, who was 67 years old, wasan ex-Confederate soldier, and when inParis last week contributed to a fundbeing raised by the Daughters of theConfederacy to purchase flowers withwhich to decorate the graves of theConfederate dead in the Paris cemete y.He enlisted in the army of the Southin 1862 at the age of 17, under Gen.Kirbv Smith, and was a member ofCompany C, Third Kentucky Battallion, the regiment commanded by Col.E.

Morgan, but escapedcapture with the command on thefamous Ohio raid, by being transferredto another division.When Gen. Morgan, with otherofficers, escaped from the State prisonat Columbus," Ohio, Mr. Rice, with afew members of his regiment, joinedhim to continue the struggle, but 'onlya short time afterward the gallantleader met his death.Mr. Rice continued in his strugelefor the South until the surrender ofjGen. Lee and he laid down his armsand returned home. Although a youngman whn the war closed he becameactively engaged in the pursuit ofagriculture, and amassed a considerablefortune.

Thisis the effect of the ruling of the Courtof Appeals when a petition for rehearing in tne case of HoDkins, on relation,against the estateo'f Dennis Long, wasoverruled. The case came up fromLouisville.As a result of the action, the Statewill lose about 500,000 a year in taxes,ccording to a statement filed by Attorney-GeneralGarnett in connection withthe petitionfor a rehearing. Thisamount has been collected on stocks insuch foreign comorat ons, and it wasstated that $500,000 collected by theState last year might have to be refunded. Attorney-General Garnett says thatall a corporation would have to dowould be to deposit $100 or less in abank in Kentucky and pay taxes uponit and this would serve to exempt allits Kentucky stockholders from payingtaxes on their shares of stock.Sancho Panza's Tribute to Sleep.Now, blessings light on him thatfirst invented this same sleep! It covers a man all over, thoughts and all,like a cloak; it is meat for the hungry, drink for the thirsty, heat for thecold and cold for the hot. It is thecurrent coin that purchases all thepleasures of the world cheap and thebalance that sets the king and theshepherd, the fool and the wise man,even. Cervantes.It pays to spray intelligently.Look well now to the brood sows.Buckwheat is an egg producing feed.Half starve your hens, if you wantno eggs.Examine tfoe collars of your workhorses often.Few horses can digest perfectlyclear timothy hay.Hang a cabbage where the hens haveto exercise to get it.Warm milk tastes fine to the calfthese chilly mornings.Charcoal in the feed is good for correcting digestive troubles.Any incubator will do its work, andsome brooders will undo it.The true dairy cow is easily affected by unfavorable conditions.A good horseman never trots a drafthorse even when he has no load.The damand on the foal's digestivesystem' for nourishment is very great.Don't let your hens mope. Givethem plenty of dry earth, ashes, chaff,etc.Sunshine is the only disinfectant absolutely free. Then let us use plentyof it.The real dairy cow turns her foodinto milk and butter-fat instead olmeat.When you mark the date on an egg,have a good honest man handle thestamp.Save eggs from hens two or threeyears old, rather than from pullets, forhatching.The live, ambitious, energetic poultryman makes it a point to hatchearly chicks.If cream is too warm, butter is verylikely to come in soft lumps, "with agreasy texture.Go over the nozzles of the sprayerand see that everything is ready forthe spring work.With proper care and protection,clipping is an aid to the health andcondition of a horse.In a case of twins one is often weaker than the other, and would die ifnot assisted to nourishment.Ducks do not need water for swimming, but they must have plenty oiabsolutely clean drinking water.Now Is The Time To BuyYOUR SUMMER GOODS!While The Prices Are Very Low,sAnd TheTime You Need Them Most.J Are You Going to Buy aRefrigerator This Spring?2Primarily there is only one thing for a Refrigeratorto do and that is to keep food at-such a temperature that itwill not spoil in warm weather.

Horder. .. .1sfrom Paris to"It's funny how we never appreciateour own good luck," said the .littlestenographer as she pinned tissue-paperaround 'her clean, stiff cuffs preparatory to attacking the day's work."Well?" The 'bookkeeper's tonecalled for particulars. Then he asked:"What special luck has befallen you?""Oh, It's just the glory-of being ableto work," she declared. "Think ofearning one's own living! Think ofbeing a business woman, free fromall the cares and tribulations of homelife nothing to do but earn a nicelittle salary that I'm sure of gettingeach week!"I'm much to be envied by my sisters in society, the poor butterflieswho are forced to stay, up late nightafter night, while I'm renewing mybeauty such as it is in sleep. Theworn, ennuied, ambitionless girlswho drag out a wretched existencetrying to have a good time how Ipity them! The ""Here, here!" exclaimed the bookkeeper, excitedly. "Stop before you'reall run down. You're overworkingyourself, child. I'm afraid you're going to be ill."The little stenographer smiled."And he thought I meant it!" she exclaimed, under her breath."No, but listen to me!" she insisted, 'aloud. "Think of it! Here I getup at six o'clock mornings, well restedafter a good, long sleep, having goneto bed at ten no social engagementshaving kept me up and I dress in fiveor ten minutes, having things all myown way, being bothered by no maid,and knowing exactly where my thingsare, having put them in certain placesmyself the night before. I know exactly -what to wear, so I don't haveto worry for an hour to decide whichdress will be most becoming. I justput on my working dress on workdays and my Sunday dress on Sundays, and that's all there is to it. Why,it's beautifully simple. Think of thejoy of having no worry on that score;then think of the trials of societybelles."Then, too, I know exactly whereI'm going every day and just what I'mgoing to do. I don't have to worryand fret over whether I'm insultingor pleasing by accepting or rejectinginvitations. I don't have to attendlong receptions and meet illustriousfolk and feel alarm lest I won't besmart enough to talk with them. Ijust calmly take a nice, convenientstreet car to my daily work. After Iget there I find my day all arrangedfor by the firm ho worry whateveron my part. Shouldn't I appreciate allthat?"I never. have to face emergencies,being never called suddenly to someimportant social affair in New York orSan Francisco or to Europe. Think ofthe popr girls, no older than I, whosuddenly face the dire necessity ofgetting twenty or thirty new frocksand the sundries to attend them!Think of having to let modistes fit youto dress after dress, and having to suffer in silence, so that the fit of eachmay be perfect! For, being in thepublic eye, the society girl can't sticka pin in anywhere to hide a wrinkleand then stand so that side of herwon't be noticed. She must be absolutely perfect all over."Think of her troubles, and thenthink of me! I can devote any noonhour to shopping merely by goingwithout lunch. I can pick up bargainsat any sale. Then in not more thantwo or three weeks, by working evenings and Saturday afternoons, I canhave a new dress made exactly as Iwant it. I don't have to take justwhat some dressmaker tells- me Imust have. I can have a low waisteddress if I want it and that kind iseasier to make when every one iswearing high waists and on one canstop me."Think, too, of the poor societygirl's having to take along a chaperonwherever she goes! Why, I canwork nights until ten or eleven anytime the firm wants me to and thentake my five-mile trip home alone, andHno one says a wrord. I have such perfect freedom! I can go to a theater 'with just another girl, if I want to,and, sitting high up, no opera glasses are turned on me to note withwhom I'm sitting. From my comfortable chair I can see the poor richgirl, in tight clothes and a stiff, uncomfortable position for she can'tslouch down and be comfortable trying to look unconscious of the operaglasses turned on her. I can enjoy theplay, but she must be constantly thinking of herself."Say, honestly," declared, the littlestenographer, looking half seriouslyat the bookkeeper for an instant, "doyou know, after all, I don't know butthat I'm half right in what I say. Ididn't mean it at all when I said it,but I've just about convinced myselfthat it's a pretty good thing to be me."I don't know that I could ever liveup to the requirements of a societyMd," she confessed, "and it's sort ofcomforting to know that I can be nat- Iural once in a while and tell my trou- !bles to a friend who likes me, not 'mymoney.Then she turned to her typewriter,humming a' little tune.
