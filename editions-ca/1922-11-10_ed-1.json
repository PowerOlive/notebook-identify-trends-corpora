In compliance with a request
from the Postoffice Department at
Washington the rural mail carriers
of the State are taking a census of
brood sows and pigs along their
routes, for the use of the Govern-
iment. The Bourbon county carri
ers have been supplied with the nec
essary blanks by Postmaster J. Wal
ter Payne, and are now distribut
ing them to the farmers along their
routes.
These reports will be used by the
Department of Agriculture as" an
aid in estimating the number of
brood sows on farms, the probable
pig production this fall compared
with last fall, and the outlook for
pig production next spring as com
pared to last spring. These indi
vidual reports will be strictly confi
dential, State reports only being
published. The farmer himself will
be benefitted most by the results of
these inquiries, therefore, it will be
to their interests to promptly fur
nish the data indicated on the
blanks furnished by the carriers.

BOURBON CROP CONDITIONS. '
For a while the farmers of the
county were blue, "as the prospects
for their crops seemed to be an
equally blue one, but they now have
cause for self-congratulation, owing
to recent rains, which have some
what freshened things. Fall grains
are needing rain; though they have
not suffered to any great extent.
The weather has been very good for
sowing the winter cover crops and
for shucking and hauling the corn.
A tobacco crop of very fine qual
ity is hanging in the barns and
although much of it is small of leaf
and light of weight, it is expected to
( bring a satisfactory price, thanks
"to the Burley Tobacco Growers As
sociation. A fairly good corn crop
has been harvested. It is not a
first-class crop, but is much better
than was expected when the drouth
was at its height in the summer.
The fruit yield has been one of the
best in many years.
