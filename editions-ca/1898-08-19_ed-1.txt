lossof life on both sidesAt first it was not intended to attack the trenches but quietly to advance after the bombardment hadceasedAt the last moment however theprogramme was changed and orderswere issued for the land battery toopen fire simultaneously with thefleet and for an advance to be made assoon as it was considered practicableto assault the Spanish trenches Thereason for this change of

importedfor foods 2500000 for dead meat and1800000 for dairy produceCattle imported alive in 1S97 numbered 61S000 head and the sheep G12000 These animals represent in theaggregate an addition to the

PARAGUAYSome of tlie Rules VIiicli Govern nSettlement of Australians inSouth AmericaOne of the strangest colonies in theworld is probably that of Cosinefounded in Paraguay by colonists ofEnglish blood from AustraliaThe property of the colonists is allheld in common and all their work isdone in common cultivating building housekeeping but each familymay occupy a house by ifself There isno currency but labor and every colonist has to give the colony 3G hourslabor a week If he works lonirer heestablishes a labor credit which he candraw on at any time Only teetotallersare accepted as colonistsA single man may put in extra laborto provide himself with a house on hismarriage If labor to his credit is notsufficient the colony will allow him anoverdraft to a certain amount liecould have as large a house as liechooses although he would be considered foolish to have a larger possession than he needsHaving paid for his house he candraw upon his surplus labor for anything else he requires or he can use hisleisure for cultivating his garden orany other private purpose Whilethe house has been built b themans labor he cannot however sellit It is only his to occupyCosme does not want single men although single women would be welcome being scarce as in most newcommunities The women are occupied with knitting sewing washingand other womanly occupations butivhen a woman is married the colonymakes no more claim upon her She isdoing all that the community requiresn managing her house and attendingo her children Men are married at21 women at IS There is no religiousservice but the

face of all the earthUpon the land or on the seaAs my sweet home and humble hearthI envy not the rich and greatWho live in ease in palace hallsWhere tables glow with golden plateAnd royal guests repeat their callsNo costly rugs bedeck my floorJo gold glows on my mantel shelfWhen Kates at home I nothing moreDesire save to bo home myselfMy children gathered at my sideWith questions quick and ready laughKindle a fathers honest prideAnd give to life ixs sunny halfId rather sit in my old chairAnd see the coals glow in the grateAnd chat with one I think is fairThan sit upon a throne of stateFor there are thorns in every crownBy monarchs worn they are but dustThe higher up the further downThey fall at last if fall they mustThe hands upon the dial plateGo round and round too fast for meIf I could bribe old Time to waitHow long the golden hours would beThe wailing wind and whitening snowBy contrast make it cheerful hereThe winds make music when they blowThe snow birds bring us

railroad track in thegulch as likely to bring him more company than he wanted The Big Hornmen kep the track hot as Mike expressed itThe risk he was taking he arguedwas quite the ordinary one he withmany another man at that time in theCoeur dAlene was taking it every dayAbout the other risk of not goingthere could be no reasoning nis heartclosed with a pang and stopped histhinking whenever he fancied thatgirl wanting him waiting for him perhaps and he not there It was not heowned a message or a messenger befitting his mountain lily but by thattoken the name was enough and washe to quarrel with happiness because itcame a little sooner or otherwise thanhe had expected or deserved It was atime of general uncertainty and perilWho could tell the needs the fears ofa girl so isolated and in such companyas that outfit at the Big HornKnowing what he knew Darcie thoughtof the mine as a Circes palace of thewildand woolly west with Abby Steersfor the enchantress and his lily as theLady Una beset by brutish types ofhumanity in shapes of unblushingdeformity But he had plenty of imagination and he was living the life of solitude and repression which breeds exaggerated fancies Moreover in histhoughts the charm of the girl like astrong light blackened the adjacentshadowsThe moon which had fitfully lightedtheir way down the trail on the night ofthe storm was too old and belated toassist at this meeting Under thetamaracks the darkness was impenetrable The lone cedar whispered toitself and seemed to pause and listenfor responses from the ranks of standing timber thatmounted the gulch fileabove file with a wedge of night skyopening a way to tne zeniuiThe car that was to carry the dinnerguests back to Wallace stood on thetrack the engine steaming Darcietook his station under the cedar andwaited in silence The alternate whispering and hushing of the forest continued often the sound was that of feetcarefully lifted and cautiously setdown in the rustling underbrush Momently his errand there seemed moraand more preposterous and foolishly unreal he could have laughed aloud hadthe xlace and the hour been merrierWhen he considered that at least halfan hour must have passed and no soundthat he could distinctly interpret washeard he took out his watch and strucka match to look at the time As thespark flamed up a volley of pistol shotspattered about him and pecked at thetree above his head The flashes camefrom the edge of the tamaracks thatdarkly environed the small clearedspace where he stood on every side butthat next the gulch on that side wasthe trailHe jumped behind the cedar andemptied his pistol in the direction ofthe flashes At the same instant threeor four shots in rapid successioncracked from across the trail and witha characteristic yell and bound Mikewas at his side holding forth with hisgun from his own side of the tree Themen could hear each others breathingbut neither spoke till Darcie saidLoad forme Mike my right flipperis hitThe beggars is leavin

WliicliProved of ValueThere are several different ways ofsaying Xo though it- can never havebut one meaning The mother of thelate Mr Allen Thorndike Bice long thewell known editor of the Xorth American Review found occasion for a seriesof vocal lessons on that word in hisearly life for which he was alwaysgratefulWhen a schoolboy he had a weaknessfor making sudden friendships andnaturally some of his hasty intimacieswere unlikely to be of -any moral advantage to him His talented motherdid not trust everything to his generalknowledgeofrightandwrongbutsought by an original and pleasantmethod to strengthen him where he wasweakestShe practiced him with a list of different questions that required no foran answer until she had taught him toinflect the syllable according to thesentimentAll the range of negatives came intothe curious drill from the no of simpledissent to the no of indignant rejectionand he learned all the proper accentsof playful reproof of cautious mistrustof heroic defiance in short he learnedthe science of refusal thoroughly Andhe never forgot itTo decline a shady invitation wasalways easier for him because he knewexactly how to say the resisting wordHis tempters understood him at onceBoth principle and politeness are essential to refined manhood and womanhood The will and the skill to sa nogently but firmly are among the

Richest Kind of Fertilizer for Flower iletls and AllGarden CropsThere is no necessity for throwingthe waste from the kitchen into thedrain from the house and to do so isabsolute waste of valuable fertilizingmaterial Dishwater soapsuds andall waste products make the bestkind of fertilizers for grape vines currant and gooseberry bushes and treesand vegetable parings may be put togood use by being kept separatecooked and mixed with bran as a feedfor pigs and chickensThe richest kind of fertilizer thatcan be made for flowers and gardencrops is to make a fiat pile of sods lawnclippings and other such material onwhich is thrown the soapsuds and dishwater and other liquid waste from thekitchen and house This compost pileshould be turned over once in awhileso as to become thoroughly mixed androtted together and then use where aquick and thrifty growth is desiredAll garden crops require an extraamount of plant iod because theyhave been bred to make a quickgrowth and are ravenous foragers inevery case There is not a single garden crop that is not benefited by fertilizing no matter how fertile the soilmay be Cabbages tomatoes cucumbers and melon vines beets onionslettuce and radishes respond to extrafertilizing very promptly and if thekitchen and house waste is utilized theaverage family makes enough of thiswaste in a year to fertilize the gardenSoapsuds and dishwater are bothrich in potash and the garden cropstake to them very kindly If employedin this way the waste may be put togood use instead of clogging up thedrain and creating an unpleasant anddisease breeding
