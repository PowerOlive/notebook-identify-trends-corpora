From December15 they are under lease to the association and June 15, 1922, the titleto the properties contracted for,will pass outright to the associationsave in cases where the owner desires only to lease his property. Ofthe 106 warehouses now under thecontrol of the association, all savethree are to be taken over, the threebeing leased or sub-leased to the association. Other warehouses, whoseowners and stockholders have askedfor time to consider the proposition,will be purchased or leased and it isnot Improbable that by the time tobacco is received, which will be assoon as financing plans now underconsideration are completed, 125 outof about 130 warehouses in the district will be under the control andin possession of the burley co-operativeassociation of growers.The growers have been anxious tolearn how their tobacco wouid be received and that question was answered when the board of directorsapproved the plan of President Jas.C. Stone to take the tobacco in.baskets, as under the old loose leaf salessystem, so that the growers are .notput to tne expense of nognsheads,the grower receiving an advance ofwhatever amount is agreed uponbetween the association's officialsand the bankers, who already havearranged to finance the 1921 crop.The adoption of the resolution forbidding any officer or employe of theassociation from buying the deliveryreceipts given members with theiradvance is paid them on their crops,it was said, will eliminate speculation in the crops of the growers, forany officer or employe who violatesthis rule jvill be dismissed promptlyfrom the service of the organization.Should any employe or official of theorganization attempt to take advantage of the information he mayobtain in an official capacity tospeculate with the crops of the pooleld growers through their deliveryreceipts his connection with the association promptly will be terminated. vEven if every warehouse in thedistrict that has not been takenover by the association should operate there is not enough tobacco, inthe opinion of warehousemen, tofurnish work, for the warehouseforces for more than three or fourweeks at the most. It is believedthat the non-pooled crop will allbe sold within the next three dr fourweeks at most, as some warehousesthat have been selling, some ofwhich have been hostile to the burley pool, have been reduced to thenecessity of holding but two sales aweek.3' Warehousemen whose services aredesired by the association will continue in charge of the plants takenpver the past week. Tobacco willbe graded on the floors as it is received, but nothing has yet beenmade public as to meothod of sale,save that it will not be by the oldso-called "dumping" method, onwhieh the growers in the past haveblamed all tneir woes.Mr. CharlesC. Clark, President oftlie Independent Tobacco Warehouse Company, and Mr. EdwardBurke, President of the BourbonTobacco Warehouse Company, Friday signed contracts whereby thesix big modern warehouses belonging -toc thenr two campanies. andlocated on South Main street, inParis, passed to the control of thenew Burley Tobacco Co-operativeMarketing Association.
