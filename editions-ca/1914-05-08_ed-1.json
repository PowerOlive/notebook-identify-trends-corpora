of deserting the army of his
country even in an pffort to
''perform a duty, which, if sue-

example. The honor con'er-

was limited to the ability of his par
tents to give him private instruction
as there were neither public or pri
vate schools in the county at that
early period. When he grew large
enough, probably assisted his father
in clearing the forest around the cab
in home. The early county records
fail to show the location of the cabin
home, but it was probably near Wa
terford on the road to Clarks Gap,
near Catoctin Church, and is said to
be still standing.
The records in the War Department
at Washington show John Champe to
have enlisted in 1776, in his 19th
year, as private in Capt. Harry Lee
(Light Horse Harry) Company of
first ight Dragoons Continental Troop
He was first mustered for pay in No
vember, 1777, and was transferred to
Lee's Legion and appointed Corporal
April 7, 1778, and promoted to Ser
geant Major January 1, 1779. The
same records also state he was Order-!
ly Sergeant. His name also appears
on a roll bearing date of August 25,
1783, at Council Chamber Continental I
Congress as door-keeper and sergeant-at-arms.
At that date Continental
Congress appears to have adjourned
from Philadelphia on account of riots
and reconvened at Trenton, N. J.
Sergeant John Champe had been a
scout for Washington's Army and had
made a brilliant record; but perhaps
his greatest daring exploit was his
effort to capture the arch-traitor," Ben
edict Arnold, who, like Judas, sold his
birthright for a mess of pottage, in
the beginning of the Revolutionary
struggle. Arnold had been one of
Washington's best Generals; he was
brave to recklessness, but an unscru
pulous tyrant. He had been severely
wounded on more than one field, for
which Continental Congress had made
him a Major-General; he had been
detected in forgeries on commisary
department, and by a court martial in
December, 1779, was convicted and
was severely reprimanded by Wash
ington. Arnold confessed and bitterly
repented and pleaded poverty as the
cause, but expressed unbounded patri
otism in the American cause and was
given command of the valuable for
tress of West Point on the Hudson.
He had hardly gotten warm in his
new position before he secretly
opened correspondence with Sir Hen
ry Clinton, the British Commander,
and proposed to surrender the Amer
ican fortress at West Point to the
British for 10,000, about $50,000 and
to receive a -general commission in
the British army. By the capture of
Major Andre, a British spy, with pa
pers that revealed the treacherous
plot, the damnable scheme was mis
carried. Andre was convicted and

hung Oct. 2, 1780, and Benedict Ar
nold deserted and fled to the British
camp in New York City where he Avas
placed in command of New York
City, then a city of about 12,000" in
habitants. The British magnified the
importance of Arnold's treachery,
claiming it was the disintegration" of
Washington's Army, that'others would
follow Arnold's example, who were en
joying Washington's confidence, and
stated that Gen. Gates -was planning
desertion also. Gen. Washington re
ceived this information with consid
erable allowance and was endeavor
ing to counteract it by the capture of
the treacherous Arnold, he immediate
ly sent for Col. Lee "(Light Horse Har
ry), and stated to him his desire for
the capture of Benedict Arnold, and
asked Col. ee to make a detail of
one of his most reliable commissioned
officers to report to his headquarters
at once for instructions. Col. Lee
stated his command doubtless con
tained a commissioned officer capable
of such a mission, but if the General
would allow him he would be pleased
to suggest the name of a Sergeant of
dragoons of muscular build, quick ac
tion with a nerve of steel, cool headed
and brave unt6 death, who he believ
ed would fill every requirement of 'the
commander. General Washington
asked the sergeant's name, his weight
and age, the county and State he was
from, with record of service.
Col. Lee replied his name was Ser
geant John Champe, 23 years old, and
a native of Loudoun county, Va.,and
enlisted 1776, and "There, that will
do, Maj. Lee," interrupted Washing
ton. "I know Sergeant Champe; he is
just the person wanted, I am surpris
ed that I did not think of him myself,
order him to report to me at once."
Sergeant Champe responded to orders
when General Washington, Col. Lee
and Sergeant Champe were seated to
gether in the General Headquarters.
General Washington unfolded his
scheme to capture Benedict Arnold,
as follow)
Sergeant Champe feign desertion
from the American army and make
his way to the British Headquarters
in New York City and enlist in Ar
nold's command, and at the first op
portunity capture Benedict Arnold
and bring him to General Washing
ton's Headquarters alive. The details
of which were to be left to the judg
ment of the Sergeant.
Sergeant Champe sat with bowed
head in silence meditation of the
mighty responsibility so suddenly
thrust upon him, but arose and salut
ed the commander with, the remark,
General I would have preferred that
you would had selected someone
else for the hazardous mission, but I
shall endeavor to obey your orders.
Maj. Lee gave Sergeant Champe
three English guineas and bade him
good night, the Sergeant mounted his
hefrse and departed in a drizzling rain
started in the direction of New York.
The American pickets were soon en
countered. The Sergeant put spurs

bushes to the river's brink abandoned'
his stud and spring into the water
and was soon picked up by a British
gallery that was patroling the river.
The Sergeant was put under arrest
in the hold of a vessel until morning
when he was conducted to the Adju
tant General's office, when he was
questioned at great length, a report of
the case was made and a guard called
and conducted the prisonre to the
Headquarters of Sir Henry Clinton,
when the American deserter was
questioned carefully, particularly re
garding the reported defection in
Washington's army. Sir Henry Clin
ton made' a report of the questions
and answers of the American desert
ter and referred the case to Benedict
Arnold when almost a repetition -was
gone through, Sergeant Champe ad
hering "with, great exactness to his
story of desertion. Arnold informed
Sergeant Champe he was recruiting a
Arnold Legion and invited the Ser
geant to enlist giving him the rank of
Sergeant, but Champe deserted be
cause he was tired of a soldier's life
particularly, because he had been
poorly paid and poorly fed, and he
would prefer not to enlist if he could
get other employment. Gen. Arnold
assured the Sergeant that -in case he
did not enlist his sincerity would be
questioned and that he would be lia
ble to be arrested and put in prison
and at hard labor for life. Sergeant
Champe stated he might possibly cun
sent to enlist if his services would be
confined to duty at Headquarters or
in New -York. Arnold assured the
Sergeant he could arrange that and
that he would be pleased t ohave him
at Headquarters. Sergeant Champe
reluctantly consented to enlist and
donned the British red coat and began
to make arrangements to carry out his
orders from General Washington. At
that time there were many persons in
New York who were intensely loyal
to the American cause, and were fully
aware of Arnold's treachery, and qui
etly denounced it in unmeasured
terms. General Washington had giv
en Sergeant Champe the names of
some of those who he could confide in
for co-operation; he soon found their
acquaintance and secured the services
of two stalwart patriots who counted
it a pleasure to risk their lives in the
cause of the liberty loving colonists,
'operate, in any effort to capture the
j,rch traitor Arnold. It was Arnold's
custom, going trom his neaaquariers
to his residence after night to pass
through his garden, and the night
agreed upon, Champe and two confed
erates were to be secreated there and
seize Arnold, gag and tie him and
carry him to the river where a boat
was in waiting to convey them to the
Jersey shore at Hoboken where a de
tachment of Light Horse Harry's
Dragoons were to be in waiting, Ser
geant Champe having previously writ
ten Col. Lee to meet him at a certain
night at 2 a. m.

placed him in charge of the embark
ing of troops to sail South, Arnold's
Legion in which Sergeant Champe
had enlisted, was ordered to be placed
on board a vessel and the next morn
ing sailed for Norfolk, Va., where they
arrived early in January, 1781. Ar
nold's Legion -was ordered to report to
Lord Conwallis, near Pittsburg, Va.
Benedict Arnold was ordered to return
to New York and assigned to another
command, while Arnold's Legion, in
cluding Capt. Cameron's company, in
which Sergeant Champe was tempo
rarily enlisted, was ordered to North
Carolina.
The supreme object of Sergeant
Champe's mission having failed, for
want of opportunity, he lost no time
in extricating himself from a situation
in which he had been placed by the
fickle fortunes of war, and swhile his
company was on the march to North
Carolina he again deserted and re
joined Gen. Green's command of. the
Continental Army, then confrdnting
Lord Cornwallis near the Carolina
border. Gen. Green had previously
been informed of the mission of Ser
geant Champe and of course gave him
hearty welcome and at the same time
obtained some valuable information
concerning the strength and maneu
vers of the British Army of which the
Sergeant had been a special student.
General Green presented the Ser
geant with a fine horse and escort
and ordered him. to report to General
Washington. The Sergeant's escapade
had become now well known in both
the Ameiican and English armies.

to England and received about $31,-
500 in cash for his treachery and was
besides the recipient of public disgust
and ostracism, amounting admost to
nothing. Money could not buy hap
piness. He died in 1796 in London
unhonored and his name unsung.
His extra hazardous service for the
American cause had endeared him to
some special recognition, and at the
recommendation of Gen. Washington,
Sergeant Champe was given the posi
tion of doorkeeper or Sdrgeant-at-Arms
of the Continental Congress
then in session at Trenton, New Jer
sey, but this position was not con
genial to Sergeant Champe, whose
strenuous nature demanded a more
outdoor life, and on the adjournment
of Congress he returned to Loudoun
County and married the lady of his
choice and began farming near Do
ver, about three miles north of Mid-
dleburg, Va., but being of restless na
ture moved to near Leesburg, and
finally removed with his family to
Kentucky, where he is said to have
died in 1797. Like Daniel Boone he
blazed the way of cizilization through
the wilderness for civilization to fol
low. The 4th of March, 1797, John
Adams was inaugurated President of
the United States, his administration
was handicapped from the beginning
by foreign complications, the country
had onlj partially recovered from the
tremendous sacrifices made to secure
our independence from the mother
country.
France was smarting under the dis
appointment of not being able to
draw the United States into the war
between France and England, and had
given the American Embassador, Mr.
Pinckney, his passport from Paris and
would not renew negotiations until
the American Government should pay
France a quarter of a million dollars
as a kind of a bonus to secure peace.
Mr. Pinckney jrew eloquent with in
dignation and disclosed that the Unit
ed States had "millions for defense,
but not one cent for tribute."
American commerce was now as
sailed upon the high seas,, practical
ly a declaration of war and so accept
ed. Gen. Wshington was again placed
in command of the army. Col. Harry
Lee was put in command of the cav
alry. General Washington wrote Col.
Lee to have Sergeant Champe again
called into service and to be placed at
the head of a cavalry command. A
courier was despatched to Loudon
county, who soon returned with the
information there obtained that Ser
geant Champe had emigrated to Ken
tucky and died there in 1797. An
American Navy of 6 frigates and pri
vateers, under command of Commo
dore Truxton, was ordered to sea.
The American flag ship Constellation
attacked the French ship Insurgent on
the high, seas, and a naval battle en
sued that perhaps has never been
equaled for heroic fighting and victo
rious results. The American vessel
carried 310 men with 38 guns, and had
26 killed and 160 wounded, while the
French vessel carried 400 men and 45
guns and lost 40 killed and 110 wound
ed. At 2 o'clock a. m. the French ves
sel began to retreat and two days la
ter was abandoned in a sinking condi
tion, only saving her crew while the
vessel and all her guns were
lost.
The American vessel, though victori -
ous.'was unable to pursue her antag-
onist on acco'unt of having all her
masts and sails shot away and left
drifting almost hopeless on the ocean,
all vessels in those days were driven
by sail, steam had not yet been ap
plied.
The historian, Brayman, gives a
vivid description of fliat midnight
battle. He says side-by side these
two ships sat upon the mighty deep
flinging out their crashing: hail and
rolling out with teriffic violence upon
the heaving ocean. Minute and hours

was irresistible on the seas. This
battle was fought February 9, 1800, a
night during a severe storm and has
dembnstrated to the world the supe
riority of the American Navy for ag
gressive fighting and also resulted in
banishing French pirates from the
high seas. The French never at
tempted to our shores with an array
and of course the war was not carri
ed beyond these engagements at sea.
General Washington soon resigned
and General Hamilton was his succes
sor. Meanwhile Napoleon Bonaparte
the First came to be a power in
France and immediately sought peace
with the united States, that resulted
in the Louisiana parchase
Captain Cameron, in whose com
pany Sergeant Champe had tempo
rarily enlisted in Arnold's Legion, had
located in Virginia after the Revolu
tionary war and while traveling
through Loudoun County put up for
the night at a farm house. The land
proved to be Sergeant Champe's.
The two men recognized each other
with some misgivings, but greatly en
joyed meeting again. Cameron was
hospitably entertained and remained
several days with farmer Champe.
The cabin home of Sergeant Champe
i referred to in the beginning of this
paper near the Catoctin Church, on
Waterford road, was most likely
the home of John Champe's father, a?
Sergeant Champe located near Dover
after the Revolutionary war. By the
rpcord of the War Department he is
shown to have enlisted in 1776. in

This, I believe, is a mistake, as the
War Department has information that
he located in Kentucky. There is
quite a large family of Champes liv
