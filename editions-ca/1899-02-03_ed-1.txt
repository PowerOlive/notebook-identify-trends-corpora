to 125 This was the result ofweek of hard and often picturesquefighting on the floor during the progress of which the oppositiorcompelled those in charge of thfmeasure to give this discretionaryauthority to the president and to makeother modifications among which werea reduction of SSI in the number ofstaff officers In consequence of thesemodifications the republican opposition practically vanished and on thefinal vote but six republicans votedagainst the bill Messrs Barber olMaryland Connolly of Illinois Loudof California Johnson of IndianaMcEwan of New Jersey and Wadsworth

FrencimnParis Feb 2 The most ardent supporters of the theory that Dreyfus wasunjustly condemned now admit thatthere is no longer the least hope thatjustice will be doneA prominent member of the University of Paris who from the first hasbeen a militant champion of a revisionof the trial saysFor ninety nine out of a hundredFrenchmen the guilt or innocence ofDreyfus is a matter of sentimentAll the reasoning in the world wouldnot induce them to change their attitude There are millions of Frenchmen who will insist upon Dreyfusguilt in spite of any proof to thecontrary A terrible feature of thesituation is that the attitude oithis majority is dictated by motives which they believe to be deservingofthe highest respect I admilthat some of the Dreyfusards are mucrto blame for this The best cause majbe ruined by disreputable adherantsand there are men on the Dreyfus sidtof whom every patriotic Frenchmaris the natural enemy While the majority of us have merely demandecthat justice should be done a pestilenminority has made this demand an excuse for virulent onslaughts en institutions we hold in great esteemIn conclusion the member of the university predicted that the result of

shoutsof laughter His majesty and M deVitry arrived scarce a half hour agowhispered More as we approached thedoorWe will not trouble you further replied the compte it is the rule atthese little parties to enter unannounced With these words he puthis hand to the door and went in I following at his heels There were atleast ten or a dozen meu in the roomstanding round a table at which satthe king engaged at play with M deBassompierre Neither the king norBassompierre who seemed absorbedin the game took the least notice of ourentrance nor did they seem in theleast disturbed by the constant laughter and converse that went on Theothers however stopped and thenburst out in joyous greetings of deBelin and very haughty glances at meIn the meantime the king played ontaking no notice of anyone

inhalf an hourIf the marshal were only here saidTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY FRIDAY FEBRUARY 3 1899Sully we could start off at once sireinstead of risking any more I see deBelin has brought our guideYes where is Biron I am sick ofthis And the king who was a badloser rose from his seat impatiently atthe same time forgetting to hand overthe last rouleau of pistoles he had lostto Bassompierre and thrusting themback into his pocket with an absentgestureAs if in answer to his question thedoor opened admitting the slight figure and handsome face of de GieWhere is the marshal Where is Biron asked ten voices in a breathYes M de Gic put in the kingwhere is BironSire the marshal is indisposed Hehas begged me to present his excusesand to sa3 he is too ill to come to nightand as he spoke I saw de

the marshal is too ill tosee anyone even your majesty said deGie desperately and with whiteninglipsI thought I heard de Yitry mutterTraitor under his thick mustachebut the guardsman parried my glancewith an unconcerned look There wasa silence of a half a minute at de Giesspeech and the king reddened to hisforeheadIf it is as you say M le Yicompte Tknow the marshal too well not to feelsure that there are two persons whomhe would see were he dying which Godforbid and one of the two is his kingGrand master we will go but and hisvoice took a tone of sharp commandand his eye rested first on de Gie andthen on the figure of a tall cavalier atwhose throat flashed the jewel of the StEsprit but I must first ask M de Vitry to do his dutyAs for me I was dumb with astonishment and half the faces around mewere filled with amaze Then de Yitrys voice broke the stillnessMy lord of Epernon your sword--andyou too II le YicompteThe duke slipped off his rapier witha sarcastic smile and handed theweapon to the captain of the guardbut we could hear the clicking of thebuckles as de Gies trembling fingerstried in vain to unclasp his belt Soagitated was he that de Yitry had toassist him in his task before it was accomplishedThe king spoke again in the samegrating tonesM de Passompierre and you de Luynes 1 leave the prisoners in yourcharge In the meantime messieurswe will slightly change our

roused himself Comede Yitry my mask and cloak and youtoo sir he said turning on me with aharsh glance He put on his mask drewthe collar of his roquelaurc up to hisears and in a moment I recognized

next to theToison dOrYes sire I made answer butwill be necessary to leave the horseiby St Martins as their presence nearthe Toison dOr might arouse curiosityand suspicionI understand monsieur have thegoodness to lead onAt St Martins we dismounted Therewas a whispered word between the lieutenant and de Yitry and then the kingde Yitry and myself pressed forward onfoot leaving dAubosson and the troopers with the horses It would take toolong if indeed I have the power to describe the tumult in my mind as wewound in and out of the cross streetsand by lanes toward the Toison dOrAt last we came to the jaws of the blindpassage and I whispered to de Yitrythat we were there The king turned tode Vitry and askedAre you sure the signals are understood de YitryYes sireThere was no other word spoken andkeeping on the off side of the road Toavoid passing immediately before thedoor of the Toison dOr where it waspossible a guard might be set we wentonward toward my lodging Favoredby the mist which still bung over thepassage we got through without accident but I perceived that not a lightglimmered from the face of Babetteshouse though I could hear th bolts ofthe entrance door being drawn as ifsome one had entered a moment or sobefore we had come up My own lodging was however different andthrough the glaze of the window wecould see the sickly glare of the lampin the shop where monsieur

park aboundswith all kinds of wild animals and birdsfrom the hated and detested Englishsparrow to the sly and cunning mounain lion but it is unlawful to hunt ormolest them excepting when those delegated with authority capture bearslk deer or swan or other gayly feathred birds for the zoo in the nationsapital The capture of the bears isattended with much excitement Themethods adopted are so peculiar thatthey w ill cause many to stop and thinktwice before they believe what theyreadThe cubs caught are always foundup some comparatively small tree sleeping or resting on tie branches withheir mother When espied by theunters who are unarmed exceptingfor a large ax a couple of leather collars and several pieces of rope thefirst thing done is to get rid of the mother bear who scented the hunters lonbefore thej saw her or her little onesThat is not a difficult nor dangeroustask but a very ludicrous one full offun and excitement As a usual thingone of the hunters climbs a near by treeind armed writh a long pole which wascut by his companions1 while he climbsthe tree proceeds to dislodge the mother This he does by prodding her inthe sides with the pole which i9 cutlong enough to reach from one tree toth other The first punch or two usuallv causes the old bear to hug the limbof the tree upon which she rests all thetighter and during the time she rendsthe air by a peculiar grunt made byprotruding the lower lip several inchesand forcing the air from her lungsthrough the half open mouth The cubsare not long in scenting danger andthey too grunt and growl rolling theirbead like eyes from side to side in terror hunching their soft backs in theirendeavors to cling to the tree all themore securelyA few vigorough punches in the sidessoon causes the mother to shift her position from limb to limb grunting andsnarling at the time at a great rateIt is often the case that she will seekrefuge on the opposite side of the treebeyond the reach of the man with thepole That necessitates his companioncutting a pole for himself and climbinganother tree on the opposite side fromwhich position of vantage he continuesthe jabbing process The bear is between the devil and the high sea andafter climbing from limb to limb onlyto receive vigorous prods in the ribsand back soon gives up the unequalfight and with a grunt evidently a signal to her young to retreat she slidesdown the trunk scraping off the loosebark in the descent until almost tothe bottom when she gives a leap striking the ground with a thud and gruntand goes scampering off in the forestprobably never to return leaving heryoung up the tree which at her departure rend the air with their peculiarand heart appealing criesThen comes the difficult and no lessmusing task of capturing the youngThis takes time often consuming anhour or more but alwavs with the sameresult The men arm themselves withlong ropes with a slipnoose at one endand climb neighboring trees The capture by this time has resolved itselfdown to the ability of the men to throwthe noose over the heads of the cryingcubs After the disappearance of theirmother the little fellows curl themselves up in a ball placing their headsbetween their front paws It is impossible to do anything until the silence0 the forest gives them a feeling ofreassurance and they poke out theirheads to view the situation It is thenthat the

KnewThe prince of Monaco has beenknown since 1885 as an enthusiasticstudent of the sea and its various formsof life He usually spends his summersin the study of oceanographic problem and his cruises have on some occasions been extended almost to thecoasts of America A short time agohe delivered a lecture before the RoyalGeographical society in London inwhich he told this incidentOne afternoon while in the Bay ofhe sank the trap in which hecollected specimens of sea life It wentto the bottom in over 1200 feet owater and as night approached he fastened to the wire attached to it an electrie buoy and then stood off a mile oifo It did not happen to occur to himthat he was right in the track of steamers plying between northern Europeand the Mediterranean but he was reminded of the fact laterAs he and his 14 sailors were watching w ith a good deal of satisfaction theswaying buoy with its brilliant illumination a steamers lightscame into viewIt was soon evidenced that the steamerwas curious to know the meaning otthe illumination for she altered tvrcourse and made for the light Sheknew that no fishing boats came cut sofar from land and so determined tosolve the myster Up she came towithin a quarter of a mile of the buoyslowed up for a minute and then started ahead perhaps a little disgusted atthe incident that had lured her severalmiles out of her courseShe had hardly got away when asecond steamer came into view andshe too bore down upon the lightedbuoy The marines on the princesvessel understood by this time that theillumination was probably believed tobe evidence of a disaster Just as theprinces steamer was moving up to explain matters she was nearly run downby one of the large liners in the oriental trade which had also left her courseto render what assistance she couldThe swell was very heavy and theprinee feared a collision as the threevessels approached the light like mothsaround a candle He therefore veeredoff and the other vessel after standing by for a few minutes went on theirway anel probably never learned thecause of that nights illumination atseaHut the incident gave the prince apointer He carefully refrained thereafter from exhibiting his

which theyinvited the poor victims They recalledthat in Canada the French had greatlyenjoyed the sport of skating and accordingly a large supply of skates wassent with the colonists to tropicalAmerica It was thought also that intheir leisure hours they would requireamusement and so a company of actorswas sent on one of the ships to build arheater in Equatorial France Thosew ho provided these means of diversionhowever forgot to send sufficient foodsupplies and no arrangements weremade for landing and housing the settiers The Chevalier de Turgot whowas appointed leader of the expeditiontook care to remain in FranceThe unhappy victims of this blund rbegan to perish by thousands and theythought that if they could only getaway from the plague spot where theyhad landed thev might have a chanceto

TELEGRAPHIt Is Traced Back Many Yoara to theIndemnity of Three FrenchSchoolboysIn these days of inventions it is Interesting to look back and see whatsmall beginnings have brought aboutgreat results The first telegraph canbe traced to the school days of threeFrench boysA well known French astronomerChappe uHauteroche adopted his threenephews and when he was once setting out on a scientific journey heplaced the youngest one who was destined for the priesthood in the clericalseminary in Angers The two otherswere sent to a school situated directlyopposite the seminaryThe three brothers were much attached to one another and the youngest Claude who was in the seminaryfound it especially hard to do withoutthe others They at least were together but he was all alone and he wasso seldom allowed outside of the institution that he had but few chancesof speaking to them From his winclow he could see theirs and thev decided upon certain hours when theywere to meet in this way and converseby signs But after all that was avery unsatisfactory means of communication and Claude who felt mostthat necessity which is the mother ofInvention could not rest until he hadfound a betterHe experimented in all manner ofways and finally decided in favor ofan apparatus consistingof a long whiteruler turning on an axis in its centerAt each end was another ruler likewiseturning on its axis With these threehe could maic all manner of figuresHe then sent his brothers an alphabetin which every letter was representedby one of the figures taken by the rulers took his post in the window andItegan his operations and great washis joy when his brothers sent himmessenger with the exact translationof his signs There was soon a telegraph in their window also and whilethey were separated throughout theirschool days the brothers talked to oneanother bv means of their sicrn IanguageThis was between 1770 and 1775About 20 years later when the Frencharmy was defending the frontiergainst the armies of the allied troopsthe northern division which was at 3fmiels distance from Paris could withina few minutes send word of its victorvto the national convention then in session in the Tuileries and receive the answer from the convention The northern division has deserved the gratitudeof the countryAnd what had happened thatwere no longer sent by courierA few months before this event AbbeChappe had informed the conventionof his telegraphic invention The plarwas tried and found practical anddecree of Julv 20 1793 commissionedthe abbe to establish a telegraph linfbetween Paris and Lille The line consisted of 12 towers from one and onehalf to two miles distant from eacrother and on each tower was an appantos built on the same principles asthe ruler telegraph of the school daysIt was so arranged that a man eoukwork it from a room in the tower anat the same time watch through fieldglasses the messages sent him and seethat his own were in turn correctlyrepeated It was in this way that tiunorthern division sent the news of thevictory which is said to be the firsltelegraphic dispatchClaude Chappe died young but hibrother Joseph who had shared hiswork of perfecting the telegraph andhad helped him in the supervision oithe many lines gradually being builttook his place as director of the system Harpers Hound TableKIPLING TALKED CHINESElie Excited Wonder by Converslnaw

MERCHANTMANil Ia First Attack Failed The Little PiratoThen Lay Within Short Rangerand WithRifles the Spanish Force Was Reducedand Finally ConqueredA series of sketches by Flank RStockton on The Buccaneers of OuiCoast is one of the features of StNicholas Mr Stockton tells of the adlporter had gone to the Logan residence ventures of Bartholemy Portuguezto interview the general about somematter then before congress The general was in bed and the reporter wasshown to his room In the course of theevening Mrs Logan entered the bedchamber and took part in the conversation In her hand she held a letter thecontents of which her husband knewabout She wanted to give it to the reporter but the general objected Butas the newspaper man started to leavewno witn a small crew in a small vessel captured a huge Spanish merchantman in the Caribbean sea Mr Stocktonsays The little pirate sailed boldly toward the big Spaniard and the lattervessel utterly astonished at the audacity of this attack for the pirates flagwas flying lay to head to the windand waited the gunners standing bytheir cannon When the pirates hadcome near enough to see and understandMrs Logan slipped the envelope into tne size and power of the vessel theyhis hand The next morning nearly naa tnougfit of attacking they did notevery newspaper in the country printed as might have been expected put abouta copy ot it it was a rare ana racydocumentColonel Alexander G Horn of Meridian Miss then the editor of The DailyMercury was its author The letterwas intended as an explanation of aneditorial that had appeared a few weeksbefore in The Mercury Colonel Hornand J J Shannon were associates inthe publication of the aforesaid journalOn the morning following the death ofand sail away at the best of their vessels speed but they kept straight ontheir course as if they were about tofall upon a great unwieldy merchantman manned by common sailorsPerceiving the foolhardiness of thelittle vessel the Spanish commanderdetermined to give it a lesson whichwould teach its captain to understandbetter the relative power of great vessels and little ones so as soon as tbethe hero of Appomattox The Mercury Plates vessel was near enough he or-contained one of the most cruel articles dered a broadside fired upon it Theabout General Grant ever printed by a Spanish ship had a great many peoplepress k dared any true southerner to on board It had a crew of 70 men andgrieve or show signs of sorrow over his besides these there were someftemisfi It called nnon the oeoDle of 8ers and regular marines and know-Dixie land to exult and rejoice at thedeath of the man who had slain theirsons and burned their homes The people of Meridian were astounded Theywent to the editor Colonel Horn andasked him in the name of peace towrite another article withdrawing itHe was obdurate and instead of doingas his neighbors wished dictated another one equally as fierce as the firstAt that moment the name of ColonelShannon wes before the senate awaitingconfirmation as postmaster at MeridianAn enemy of his knowing the love thatGeneral Logan had for General Grantinclosed copies of the paper to him expecting ihat Logan would oppose Shannons nomination Shannon and Hornhad a dispute over the editorial andtheir relations became so strained thata street duel was only averted by theinterference of mutual friends ColonelHorns letter to General Logan was tothe effect that Colonel Shannon was innocent of the article and had knownnothing about it until he saw it in thepaper I cannot quote the letter withliteral exactness but a part of it was asfollowsNo Shannon had nothing to dowith it In the first place he hasntsense enough to conceive such a sentiment as was expressed in the editorialand if he had he would be too cowardlyto write it He is my partner I am sorry to say but by making him postmasteryou will afford me the opportunity ofgetting rid of himAnd why not take him John Thereis a mighty narrow strip between theradical republicanism that you represent and the Cleveland Mugwumperythat Shannon tries to represent He isnot a Democrat never was and neverwill be I predict that you will soonhave him over on your side and Godspeed the dy TVe Democrats downhere dont want himI am growing old but I am still inpossession of my mental faculties andI hope to live many years longer to tellthe truth from day to day about thedespised Yankees and their politics Iam seriously afflicted with hemiplegiaelse I would have mauled h 1 out ofing that the captain had determined tofire upon the approaching vessel everybody had gathered on deck to see thelittle pirate ship go downBut the ten great cannon balls whichwere shot out at Bartholemy s littlecraft all missed their aim and before theguns could be reloaded or the great shipbe got around so as to deliver her otherbroadside the pirate vessel was alongside of her Bartholemy had fired noneof his cannon Such guns were uselessagainst so huge a foe What he was after was a hand to hand combat on thedeck of the Spanish shipThe pirates were all ready for hotwork They had thrown aside theircoats and shirts as if each of them weregoing into a prizefight and with theircutlasses in their hnds and theirtols and knives in their belts tneyscrambled like monkeys up tbe sides ofthe great ship But Spaniards are bravemen and good fighters there were morethan twice as many of them as therewere of tbe pirates and it was notlong before the latter found out thatthey could not capture that vessel byI boarding it So over the side they turn- jbled as fast as they could go leaving jsome of their number dead and woundedbehind them They jumped into theirown vessel and then they put off to ashort distance to take breath and get1 ready for a different kind of fight Thetriumphant Spaniards now prepared toget rid of this boatload of half nakedwild beasts which they could easily doif they took better aim with their cannon than they had done beforeBut to their amazement they soon1 found that they could do nothing withthe guns nor were they able to worki their ship so as to get it into positioni for effectual shots Bartholemy and hismen laid aside their cutlasses and their1 pistols and took up muskets with whichthey were well provided Their vessellay within very short range of tbe Spanish ship and whenever a man could beseen through

out ofthe way cf tbe Spanish guns and itsbest marksmen crouching close to thedeck fired and fired whenever a Spanish head was to be seenFor five long hours this unequal contest was kept up It might have reminded one of a man with a slender rodand a long delicate line who badhooked a big salmon The man couldnot pull in the salmon but on the otherhand the salmon could not hurt theman and in the

Conelnde s Transaction by Raising TheirWhips On Their HeadsThe Chicago stockyards are uniqueamong the great marts of the world Inno other place say those who are mostfamiliar with fit daily routine is solarge an aggregate of business transacted in the language of gestures and witheat the serateh of anennin hnoisy pent of the stockyards A whipis held high in air across a sea of Itering horns the signal is answered by Itthe momentary uplifting of a hand and ibunch Of Cattle worth thmiBDnda ntdollars is soldThere is something splendidly picturesque and even spectacular in thesewordless transactions They ignore theartificialities of tbe complex system upon which modern business relationshipsare almost universally maintainedTrade in the cattle pens gets boldlyback to primitive simplicity It is doneon honor not on paper And tbe undisputed transfer of millions of dollarsworth of the property here dealt inproves that a bargain sealed with thewave of the whip and an assenting gesture of the hand is quite as safe and sacred as if the whole transaction wererecorded in black and whiteThe trader in the wheat pit is armedwith his tally card upon which hepauses to note the names of those withwhom he deals and the amount natureand price of the commodities boughtand sold The broker upon the floor ofthe Stock Exchange places equal reliance upon the quickly penciled memoranda made at the moment when thedetails of each transaction were uponthe lips of those concerned in its fulfillment but the buyer and seller of theyards carry whips not pencils andtheir deals are recorded in memory instead of written upon trading cards Aswell try to picture tbe old knights making laborious written memoranda oftheir challenges as to think of the roughand ready traders of the cattle yardspausing in their saddles to jot downupon paper their purchases and salesSuch a procedure would bid defiance tothe very nature of things and do violence to the magnificent unconventionally of every environmentIs there never any trouble in thiskind of dealing a leading commissionman was aslidIf you mean do the men goback ontheir bargains made by whip and handI can answer never was the tradersanswer as he brought his trim blackhorse to a halt in the cattle alley andleaned forward in his saddle Thereisnt another place in America or thewhole world for that matter where somuch business is done on the basis ofpersonal integrity without a writtenword to show for the transactions asright here he continued and themethod beats all the bonds on earthThe days business in these pens willrun about 1500000 And how is itdone Little talk a considerable waving of whips and hands and no exchangeof written documents betwaen buyersand sellersHere is a bunch of cattle that willfigure up about 10000 Over there inthe other alley is a buyer who thismorning offered me a price of f 5 10 forthem I thought that I could do betterbut the market has been a little off andI have decided to let the bunch go athis offer Up to the present momentwe have exchanged about a dozen wordson this subject Now if be is willing topay the price which he named in themorning Ill 6how you how a 10000bunch of fat steers is sold withoutword of mouth or a scratch of writingat the time the bargain is really madeThe commission man then straightened up in the saddle and waited for thedistant buyer to look in his directionA moment later this representative ofa big packing house wheeled his horseabout and faced in the direction of theseller Instantly the commission manlifted high his rawhide riding whipand held it aloft His attitude was asstriking as that of a cavalry colonel uplifting his saber to concentrate the attention of his regiment before makinga desperate charge The pose howeverwas full of natural grace and freedomand showed that the man was more atease in the saddle than he could havebeen out of itOnly a moment elapsed before thealert eye of the buyer caught sight ofthe upraised whip The next instant heraised his hand a little above his headheld it motionless a moment and thendropped it with a forward movementQuickly the seller repeated the motionof assent with his whip and then turning to his caller saidThats all there is to it To a stranger this kind of a performance lookslike a long range sign talk between deafmutes but we understand each otherperfectly We both know how manycattle there are in the bunch and theprice at which they have been soldHad we been within speaking distanceof each other the transaction would1 probably have been a verbal one justfor the saki of sociability but not because it would have mae the bargainbetter understood or any more bindingChicago PostA Coin In the BottleThere have been patented all kinds ofschemes devised for the purpose of securing a
