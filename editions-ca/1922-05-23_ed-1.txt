Over $700,000 in checks wasdistributed during the day, underthe management of Chairman SamClay, and were cashed at the localbanks. As a result the cash registers and bank accounts of Paris merchants were considerably enlargedby receipts, as the tobacco men spentliberally with the local merchants.Two years ago practically thesame crowd of farmers gathered inthe court house, but under far different circumstances. Following theopening of the tobacco ' markets,when what they considered ruinous prices were being offered by thebuyers for their crops, after wildscenes had been enacted at the saleshouses, the tobacco trampled underfoot, and threats made by some ofthe more excitable growers, a meeting called at the court house was addressed byseveral leading businessmen, bankers, and others. .Bourboncounty entered into the spirit of theundertaking, and was thefirstcounty in the district to go overthe top." Several growers who hadfor reasons best known to themselves, remained out of the pool,joined the association Saturday andpledged their crops, and it is nowsafe to say that the 1922 tobaccocrop o'f-Bourbon will be practicallyone hundred per cent in the poolagreement.The Burley Co-operative Marketing Association has made good itsevery promise, even beyond the expectations of its organizers. Thesecond distribution of payments Saturday marks a signal triumph forthece who attended to its financing.Already the growers will have rereceived within three or four centsof the total per pound received bythose who cold on the independentfloors, and there are still other payments to come. -Much of this remarkable record isdue the organization, of course, butdown in our heart3 we know that tothe f aimer himself should go themaior share. He it wrs who stithe merits cf the proposition, andstuck through thick and thin, despite the moans cf the calamity howlers. He has been waiting for a longwhile to come into his own as amarketing man, and his hour, itseems, has come. It is not too muchto expect that the farmers of Bourbon county, now. that they havedemonstrated the feasibility of selling tobacco in a business-like manner, will carry the same method onwith their other " products. Andwith sensible marketing methodsfarming is going to be the best ofall the world's occupations.MUSIC MEMORY CONTESTThe final concert of the MusicMemory Contest was held last nightin the auditorium of the Paris HighSchool at 7:30 o'clock.

Embossed, on the smaller endis the letter "C." of the same colorand formation as the egg shell, butin elevation several times the thickness of the shell. This thickness, itis said, precludes the possibilitythat the phenomenon could havebeen the result of the vinegar trick.Ohio street generally is guessingabout the egg. Some of a religiousturn advance the suggestion thatthe C stands for Christ and may betaken as a prophesy of his earlysecbnd coming. A wag has suggested that the hen had the hives. Another view is that a strain of mono-gramed-egglayers may spring fromthis hen.

The girl"Was believed, the minister ostracised by the community to such an extent that he shot and killed himself. The girl then confessed heraccusation was baseless and theman innocent, whereupon the community it must be a nice place tolive condemns the girl!If the community would condemnitself for intolerance, scndal-mon-geringand total failure of loyalty,it would be more to the point.Strange that a minister of the gospel, with his years of experience,could not realize that those whocondemned him without evidencewere out of their own mouths condemned; that when people believeevil without proof, it is because,under similar circumstances, theywould themselves have been evil!o-It would only be history repeating itself if some of the recent profiteers should be the tcut philanthropists of the future.IT IS A HARD WORLDRecently in the news columns ofthe press a number of girls whohad left their homes have beeir pilloried by. a merciless publicity.If the Prodigal Son had been adaughter what would have happened? Why is it that the worldkills" and serves tasty veal for remorseful young scamps (who perhaps return more hungry than repentant) while refusing to an erring or unfortunate girl the crumbsfrom its respectable tables?The daughter is the weaker child.Almost anything hurts a womanworse than it could hurt a man inthe social sense. It is true that wandering girls have been welcomedhome, but the warmth and love, themusic and feasting and dancingusually have not been conspicuouslyevident in the celebration of suchhome-comings.The Prodigal Girl is human; herfiesh is soft; her nature is mysterious and complex; she is more tender than a boy; she may have beennot to blame, butT' vorld's attitude in theseCORNS .Lift Off with FingersPeace hath her victories andfrom abroad comes clarion note ofone of them.
