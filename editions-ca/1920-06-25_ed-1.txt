It is going to be the most prosperous wehave ever had..We make these statements in spite of calamity howlers,overall brigades, panic pessimists, and election-year bogeymen.This is a mighty good country in which to live, after all.To be sure, prices seem high and there is a shortage ofproduction. But nothing will happen. That is, nothingwill happen to us individually unless we all get frightenedcollectively.If we all learn to smile and -fight, nothing can stop us.This country isn't going to the bow-wows. It's too big andtoo prosperous and has too much at stake to let everything goto smash. The truth is only those looking for trouble willfind it.The man who minds his business will have a business tomind. The man who is chicken-livered and yellow-heartedmay frighten his business to death, but the man with astraight spine, a clear head and a stout heart is going to bebigger and richer than ever.If you don't like to do business under the present conditions blame Adamand Eve. Don't blame the Democrats or Republicans, or the H. C. of L.,or your wife, or the hired hand. This is the time for sanity not for calamity.The country needs more lions and fewer rabbits.There is nothing wrong with this country.

"My Appetitewas so poor I had to force downevery mouthful I ate and especially jm the mornmge when I seldom atf;any breakfast at all, usually drinking only a small cup of coffee. Theiittle I did manage to eat soured almost at once and gas pressedagainst my heart so at times it wasdifficult for me to breathe. I alsosuffered with severe headachesnearly all the time and at timeswould have dizzy spells when it wasjust about all I could do to keepfrom falling. I was unable to getbut little sleep and always got upin the mornings feeling tired andworn out. Not being able to eatscarcely anything and loss of sleepwith my other troubles was tellingon me and I began to lose strengthvery fast, and finally it was justabout all I could do to do my workat the railroad shops."I had tried several differentmedicines without receiving anybenefit from them, when one of tneboys at the shop who .had beengreatly benefited by Tanlac, advisedme to give it a trial, and as he wasso loud in his praise about it I decided to take his advice. Well, sir,to make a long story short, it proved to be. the very thing I needed,and it was only a short while beforeI had a splendid appetite and now Ican eat just anything: I want without its hurting me a particle. I always get a good night's sleep andget up in the mornings feeling fineand ready for a good day's work,which I can now do with easTanlac has made life worth livingto me, and I will onljr be too glad tolecommend it whenever I h'ave anopportunity."Tanlac is sold in Paris at thePeople's Pharmacy.
