Petticoat LaneLittle rough or rude language is usedby the English They even fight without swearing and get very drunk andnoisy without employing strong language They love to chaff and guy eachother and the crowds and the streetpeople who drive horses and peddlegoods and hang about the corners are agreat deal wittier than most of us givethem credit for being but they seldomresort to bad language I never heardmuch of it until I went to Petticoatlane and I know a woman who haslived here two years and been constantly about town who tells me that in thattime she has only heard one oath froman Englishmans lips The worst wordI heard in Petticoat lane was bloodyThat however is the worst word 1could have heard in English opinionit is the foulest word there is 1 haveonly heard one man use it and he didnot speak it He was very angry andhe spelled itI am telling you this because 1 knowthat at home in America we associateit with the English and put it in Englishmens mouths in our anecdotes asif it were a matter of course that itshould be used to give a local color toan English story Americans come hereand make use of the word for the comicvalue that they attach to it and yet 1assure my readers that if they tried tothink of any really disgusting term theyhad ever heard and made use of insteadthey could not more startle or shockthese English earsEnglish sailors have brought theword bloody to our shores sailorsand prizefighters and stablemen andonly such persons cling to it hereWhat we consider a very much foulerword has a vastly wider circulationbut is not considered as bad asbloody All this is very strange andrequires a native to explain it especially as bloody is merely the contraction of the oath by our Lady whichwas more or less commonly used in theancient days when this was a RomanCatholic countryThe people who try to swear withoutswearing who in our country sayhully chee and by cripes all usethe word blooming over here Icant very bloomin well make you buythis bloomin thing but Ill ave jbloomin try at it is what I heard astreet fakir say to a orowd the otherday There is no harm in that at alland it is much more typically Englishthan the word bloody besides beingdecentIt is funny what mistakes nationsmake about one another Over here thevery smart thing in reporting the speechof us Americans is to make us all andalways call ourselves Amurri cans Itmay be true of us This whole nationbelieves it But I never heard an American so pronounce the name of our country and yet Ive got a quick linguisticear which is a thing the English utterly lack Julian Ralph

payers of the city whichwas at first careleps and without interest in the controversy between theCouncil and the banks has turnedstrongly towards the banks since thefacte of the case have been recentlymade public through the pressThe average man is fair and likes tosee fair play and doesnt believe thatbecause a bank is a bank it has no rightswhich are entitled to protectionThe Paris banks have paid all taxesdue from them for 1893-4-5 and 6 in accordance with a decision of the Kentucky Court of Appeals The effort ofthe Council to force them to pay morefor those years cannot be justified uponany grounds of right or equity and it isto be hoped the Council will see this andmake a settlement of the case out ofCourt as other cities have doneIt certainly is not good business norfor the interest of the city to force anymore of the banks of Paris to reducetheir capital stock Already 45000000of capital has been withdrawn on account of unequal taxation of the banksThe City cannot afford to force thewithdrawal of any more bank capitalWe presume the city intends to go on asa municipality incurring debts andraising Teyenue to pay them after thequestion of bank taxation has been settled A wise administration of theaffairs of the city would consider thefuture as well as the present and instead of getting a few hundred dollarsmore out of the banks now and forcingthem to cut capital so as toleave but little to tax forthe future would be content with lessnow and more for the futureThe News is confident that the business men and tax payers of Paris desirethis matter settled by the Council on ajust and fair basis and as other citieshave settled and that it is not theirwish that Paris alone should hold outfor the last cet and the last drop ofblood which under any pretext of

of othercities and follow a long line of precedences it should compromise with theParis Banks It the Paris CityCouncil thinks that it has no legal rightto compromise it can put itselt onrecord as being willing to do such athing if it had the power and thru ifany one wishes to enjoin it or withes totake the question to the Courts on his orher own behalf the Council will havehad the satisfaction of knowing that itdid what it could to briug about anequalization of taxation It is futile tolook for even a gesture on the part otany individual member of that body inthe direction of an illegal act Each isso straight laced is so exact and like4 John Auricular who walked in waysof the Lord perpendicular wouldnt doanything that was contrary to the letteror spirit of the law Whenthe Council noted to sue the Banks theimmortals who do the writing on atleast one of the Paris papers jubilatedconsiderably and wrote that congratulations were being strewn around inprofligate profusion They seemed toregard the action as a triumph over acombination of corporations that wereseeking to throttle the life out of a prostrate people Amid the clash ofcymbals and the din of drums MrAshbrook like the knightly aud chivalrous gentleman that he is resigned fromthe Council that he might assist theCity Attorneys in pursuing the vanquished enemy into its denNot a single man woman childfish fowl nor devil has arisen in anyothr city and set aside the action oftheir council It should be the aim andattainment of a city council to fosterand encourage all legitimate commercial enterprises and it is

thinks of walking Men andwomen alike ride mules the wealthierfemales using the English side saddlethough some prefer the safer thoughelumsy Spanish saddle Poorer women ride astride without excithrg anycomment among the natives The correspondent continuesI noticed one rider near Juatia Diazwho took my mind back to the old daysof chivalry She was a lovelj girl cfabout 15 or 16 with a face like a madonna and a figure like an artist modelOne little foot crept out benoath hersilk riding skirt and to my surprise itAvas devoid of hosiery The skin waslike polished velvet and was of a pinkish gold of an exquisite tint It wasshod with a slipper of satin or silk embroidered in color and had an archedinstep which made th foot all the morecharming by its settingThe time to see the women at theirbest is on Sunday morning when theyride from their homes to mass in thenearest church or cathedral On Sunday morning while riding leisurelyinto a smali village on my way to thistown I met a crowd of worshipers ontheir way to mass Nearly all the women were on muleback and sat or lolledas ifthey were in an easy chair in theirown homes A few probably wealthierthan the others or else delicate in Jhealth- were accompanied by littedarky boys who held over ihem a paraaol or anounbrellaOn Sunday each woman wears ahuge rosary sometimes so large as tobe uncomfortable 1 saw several thatwere so unwieldy that they went overthe shoulders and formed a huge linelarger indeed than a string of sleighbells These are ornamcital lcsarhsand are not used for prayer The praying rosary is as small and

thePerkins stock and cut off the youngfellows allowance Old man Perkinstherefore had three married daughtersand one son-in-law on his hands andpandemonium reigned within his gatesHe had to order the eldest daughter outof the house and she revenged herselfby eloping with a man who deserted wifeand chiidren to run away with thismagnificently handsome creature athing he mourned in sackcloth andashes

the Comstock and his Sacramento wife who was believed to bedeeply in love with a steamboat engineer proved that she wasnt by journeying to Virginia City with her littleboy and reclaiming her now

the stock market wenthis way and he became a millionairebefore he was 30 Again his prettybut low bred wife followed and againhe honestly tried to make the best ofhis bargain but her mad

back to Virginia City anda furious quarrel followed in which heordered the Perkinses never to darkenhis doors again and lo his wife sidedwith her sister and elected to go withthem McLane would gladly have parted with them all but he had grown tolove his boy When once more a yearlater fortune smiled on him and witha new bank account he came down toSan Francisco the Perkinses had disappeared Two of the sisters were living the lives of adventuresses Old Perkins was dead and huried and no oneknew where the rest had gone a hostof Sacramento tradesmen wished theycould find outThen McLane came east

primitive Germans whose females are represented to have been veryhigh spirited and tohave exercised considerable sway over the other sexWhatever truth there may be in- thisstatement certain it is that a high species of gallantry forms the very spiritof modern chivalry and as a proofof this we have only to refer to theclassification of a knights duty to fearGod and love the ladies to perceive hownecessary female adoration is to thevery existence of this order This principle of female adoration so prominently displayed in every aspect olchivalry extended its influence to thelawrs of the times for we find JamesLT of Arragon ordering in this mannerWe will that every man who shallbe in company with a lady pass safeand unmolested unless he be guilty oimurder And Louis II duke of Bourbon

cars We were standing--ona bridge where many trains passseeing the cars go under trains goingone way and the other txsS enginesbacking down and hooking on to trainscars and locomotive all the time in motion Even in its most commonplaceaspect a fascinating spectacle and Itold the boy that I loved to watch emtoo and so we stood there a long timeand looked at emIt made me think of the time when Iwas young about 714000000 years agothough I feel young still for all thatwhen I used to watch the cars myselfLocomotives burned wood in thosedays1 and the tenders were stacked uphigh with cordwood The engines werenot half so big as they are now andthey had great funnel shaped smokestacks flaring wide at the top butthewere fascinating just the sameIn the town I lived in then the engines waiting to couple on to trains tovtake them along their stretch of the sslroad from that noint on used do baclcdown from the roundhouse andtovaiin a cut a block or two from the railroad station This cut was walled upon the sides and the outside tracks ofthe lines laid in the cut came close tothe wall the top of which was about ona level with -the top of the locomotivetenderSometimes there would be three engines waiting in this cut for trainsAnd that always made an interesting-scene the three engines standing closetogether all breathing in the peculiarway that engines have more like ashort regular cough than it is breathing but I was always the most interested in the one on the track nearest the wall where I wentEvery once in awhile I used to godown there on that wall and stay thererand watch the locomotive right closeby until it went out and sometimesif its train was late that might be halfan hour or more but I never tired of itI used to see the engineer pick up hisoil can with the long spout and swingdown out of the cab to the ground and -walkall around the engine very de-liberately and oil everything everywhere and then hed seem to sort oftake a look all around and then hedclimb up in the cab again and put thecan down and get some cotton wasteout of the box on the tender and rub theoil off his hands All this time the fireman would be doing something shiuing the brass or a last touch maybethey used to have more brass on engines then than they do nowadaysand all this time quiet and still as itwas in the cu all three engines wouldbe breathing in that slow sort of acough like breathing seemed asthough they were breathing just asslow and easy as they could and sortof saving themselves up for the timewhen they have to stretch outPretty aoon the other engines wouldback down one after the other and -thenthe time wouldcome formy engine to go I used to see the engineertouch thr throttle gently starting theengine backing down and then in twoor three minutes Id see him coming

condition was apparentcontinuing during the second andthird months when they were againweighed and it was found that an average increase of 4S pounds per head wasthe result The test lasted during thehot months of July August and September when flatulent colic was veryapparent in the stable yet not onesingle case had occurred among these23 horses Since this trial and whenever a car load of newly purchasedyoung horses arrives it is considereda waste to feed them until their teethave examined and put in proper shapeAs a preventive for lameness tocommence operations on the teethwould appear to some very ludicrousyet common sense and practice wouldconvince them that this would be theproper means of preventing interference one of the chief causes of lameness in voung horsesYoung horses fully developed showsigns of fatigue and weakness after ajourney and interfere Some grab thequarter of the fore foot with the toeof the hind foot or overreachIn such cases the ordinary practitioner would treat locally possibly advise different shoes order tonic ballsor condition powders and a few daysrest the latter would benefit mostlyand give temporary reliefNow supposing there were irregularities of the teeth as is usual withall young- horses the first treatmentshould be to put them in perfect order so as to promote mastication andgood digestion to enable proper assimilation of the nutritive qualities ofthe food and there insure increasedstrength and condition thus remoingthe original cause of the weaknessIt may seem equally absurd to someol our readers to assert that operatingthe teeth will prevent pulling andother vices but that it is not so isproved by the following incidetit Apony that we treated had changedowners for no other cause than thatnone of

most common it is worth whileto remind those who have but one ortwo or even three hogs to kill that itis far cheaper to take these wherea larger number are to be slaughteredand where there are all the conveniences than to kill the hogs at homesajs the Fruit Grower and PracticalFarmer Heating the water and retting ready generally take a good dealof time When this is done the workot killing and

COLONYTHE BOURBON N EWS PARIS EX FRIDAY NOVEMBER 18 1898An Interesting PenrPictnrc of Liifeon the Appomattox Early intlie Seventeenth CenturyAfter many troubles and havingbeen several times on the verge of ruinthe colony of Virginia appeared in thebeginning of March 1622 to have surmounted its difficulties and to be ina fair way toward prosperity In 1G09the number of colonists had been reduced to CO and these were on thepoint of embarking for Newfoundlandwhen Lord Delaware arrived with supplies and more emigrants In 161 1fresh arrivals including a large number of women as well as men raisedthe number to 700 and the colony thenadvanced rapidly in prosperityFriendly relations had been maintained with the Indians this being duechiefly to the marriage of John JUolfeand Pocahontas the daughter of Powhatan the most powerful chief in Virginia The chief died in 1G18 and wassucceeded by his younger brotherThe settlements of the colonists werescattered over a wide extent of country on both sides of the James riverThe largest of these villages consistedof wooden huts raised round a largeand substantial building the abode ofMr Reginald Neville who had beenone of the settlers that had come outin 1 607 lie brought with him in a craftof 60 tons that he chartered for thepurpose 15 farm laborers and theirwives together with implements ofhusbandry and a store of commoditieslikely to be pleasing to the nativesNeville a gentleman of much resolution and energy had emigrated inconsequence of a qtiarrel that had takenplace between himself and one of theScotch noblemen who had come to England with James I In spite of the lackof success that attended the previousexpeditions he believed that there wasa great future for those who were earlyin the field in the colony and the factthat those who had been taken out byGrenville in 1585 had after great hardships been brought back to Englandby Sir Francis Drake that 50 taken outthe following year by Grenville all perished and that of 115 others left therethe following year no trace whatevercould be fotmd in 1590 in no way shookhis belief in the future Consequentlywhen he decided upon leaving Englandhe disposed of all his property andjoined the little party who went out in1607 under the auspices of the LondoncompanyIt was not long before he separatedhimself from the others They werepersons of very different rank and quality quarrels frequently sprung upamong them and all would have perished had not one of their numberJohn Smith a man of great energy assumed the direction of their affairsReginald Neville saw at once that ifsuccess was to be obtained it was onlyto be found by separating himself entirely from these people And accordingly he journeyed with his own partycome 50 miles south of tho James river-or as It was then called the PowIiatan and purchased from the chiefof that name a tract of ground in exchange for the clothes axes and otherarticles he had brought oxit for thatpurposeThe plantation called Cumberlandby its owner in remembrance of hisnative country stood within a mile ortwo of the site now occupied by Cumberland Court House a name familiarto the world from its associations withthe civil Avar The river near which itstood and which served as their highway to Jamestown was the Appomattox Here he had lived undisturbedand unmolested during the varioustroubles between the colonists and theIndiansMr Nevilles life at the little colonythrt he had founded was a quiet andpeaceful one The men he had broughtwith him were all married he hadpicked his men judiciously and noneof them had ever sought to leave himthe troubles and misadventures of themain bodj of colonists plainly showingthem that they were far better off withtheir master than they would be werethey to embark in affairs on their ownaccountThe government of Reginald Nevillewas patriarchal in its character Eachcouple had their own dwelling and aportion of ground that they could tillon their own account having one dayslibertj in each week for the purposeAll were fed from a common store andprovided with all that was necessaryHe had brought with him several pigsand some poultry they had greatly increased In numbers and now providedno small portion of the meat for thegeneral consumption Game was abundant In the forests and could be obtained from the Iiidians for a fewbeads a small mirror or other triflesThe men raised in the fields an abundance of grain for their wants and thesurplus could always be exchangedwith the Indians The principal crophowever after it had been discoveredthat the soil and climate were suitablefor it was tobacco which was sent toEngland as opportunity offered andfetched good prices since in spite ofthe opposition of the king it was rapidly growing in favor thereThe women aided in the lighter fieldwork and in the gathering and curingof the leaves they spun and wove thelinen the flax being grown for the purpose on the plantation All wore softleathern garments
