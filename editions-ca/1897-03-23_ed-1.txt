can he be otherwisethan guilty when both Herbert andFannie caught him in the very actYou forget Tom that Fannie statesthat when she saw him before shefainted he was turning from thebedside with the bloody knife in hishand Brother he may have found thatknife driven to the bankers heart andbut then have pulled it forth remember Fannie says that a look of horrorwas on his features while Herbert testified that it was a fiendish lookWhatever the look Clara might itnot have changed to horror when hefound himself discoveredHe never killed the banker Tom itis impossibleBut why should he have fled

old men who have ceasedto think on serious subjects It is melancholy to notice how quickly such people grow weary of a real play of intellect and fall back upon their memoryto supply them with disjointed scrapsof humorous or witty parleySuch things excite laughter but havebehind them a sense of emptiness andunreality which a good conversationnever has and yet the latter is a rhingwhich unless taken down by shorthandcannot pfossibly be reproduced andthere is no better sign that talk has beenreally good and general than the inability of the contributors to give anyadequate account of it afterward Thechanges which pass over an expressivecountenanee cannot be given by thepainter still less by the most accuratephotograph so it is with the drifts andoddies in a fliowing stream so it is withthe April weather of a good conversation Anecdote may by no means be excluded if it fits perfectly to the argument in hand knowledge may give idepth provided that knowledge is keptperfect in

of the people whouse the thoroughfares for the purposeof getting about from one point to another The people in this case include wheelmen along with othersBut do the commissioners always looktlfter the condition of the streets to thebest of their ability and to the greatestdegree of comfort of all concernedWell hardly They are really not tobe taken seriously The mere fact thatthey are elected or appointed to docertain things is no reason why theyshould do it so thej thinkThe fact of the matter is a public office is a public joke They jolly thepeople while the appropriation forstreet cleaning and repairing goesTell us ye winged winds where ohwhere does much of it goAnd the country road supervisor orcommitteeman is a smaller but morenumerous jokpr No one really expectsliim to look after the

seed While they can hardly be considered a certain crop yetwhen anything like a fair crop is secured they are a profitable crop to youCn account of the work and cost ofkeeping the crop clean it is quite anitem to select a piece of clean land andfor the same reason only well rotted andthoroughly fined manure should beused To get the best results the landmust be rich It is almost a waste ofseed to try to grow onions in anythingbut a rich soilWood ashes poultry manure guanoor thoroughly rotted stable manure canbe used as fertilizers taking pains towork it thoroughly in with the soilThere is little danger of getting the soiltoo richIt is important that the seed besown early Securing the seed andmanuring of the land should be done ingood season so that at the first favorable opportunity in the spring the seedcan be sown Have the soil as fine aspossible when the seed is sown in orderto secure a good germination of theseed and a vigorous start of the plantsto grow Be sure that the seed is ofgood qualit If the seeding is to bedone by hand work out the rows abouteight inches apart and make the drillsabout one inch deep Sow the seeds asearly as possible two or three seeds tothe inch It is quite an item to get theseed distributed evenly in the drillsThe advantage in using the drill is thatthe seed can be sown and covered moreevenly with less workSome growers in order to get theplants started earlier and to some extentat least lessen the work of keeping thecrop clean at the start sow the seedthickly in a bed or frame and afterthey are well up transplant them intorows -where they are to growAs when the seed is sown it is important to have the soil in a good tilthWork out the rows and then lay theplants not over two inches apart It isbetter to use plenty of plants and thincut than to have vacant places in therowsIf the land is not so rich as it shouldbe it will be a good plan to scatter agood dressing of wood ashes or commercial fertilizer over the surface Theonion feeds very near the surface andthe necessary cultivation will work thefertilizer sufficiently into the soilA fine sharp toothed steel rake is oneof the best implements with which tobegin the cultivation Properly used itwill thoroughly fine the surface and destroy the weeds It is important to begin the cultivation as soon as possiblefor in this way the weeds will be easierkept down It will be an exceptionalcase however when hand weeding willnot be necessary But a careful use ofthe rake and cultivator in good seasonwill greatly lessen the work of handweeding With this as with manyother crops it is best to commence in asmall way and increase the acreageafter experience has been acquired StLouis Republic 8Tomato Culture In EuropeNotwithstanding the fact that tomato sauce has been known and

puerile health and vigor In the fallof 1895 however his parents Mr and MrsRichard Howse the former a well knownbusiness man whose office is in the Arcadehad almost despaired of saving his life Thelad became afflicted with inflammatoryrheumatism which affected his entire bodyand accompanying that painful ailmentwere several othef serious disorders Whenshe was requested to describe her sons sickness and his recovery Mrs Howse saidIt was in September 1895 that Fred whowas up to that time in delicate health wasattacked by inflammatory rheumatism Itwas a very acute case for he was confined tohis bed and was unable to move even hisarms or legs without bringing on excruciating painAside from the rheumatism Freds liverwas in serious disorder and he used to vomitfrequently He was also subject to faintingspells and altogether he had a very serioussicknessWe knew of course that though therheumatism was exceedingly painful it wasnot necessarily dangerous the faintingspells and vomiting however alarmed usOften when Fred fainted he would lay likeone dead His face would become ashenpale and it was difficult at such times todetect his heart beats These spells causedMr Howse and myself much uneasinessabout our boys condition We called in adoctor and he prescribed for Fred but thelad did not seem to improve so I purchased abox of Dr Williams Pink Pills for PalePeople in one of the down town storesThen for four months steadily Fred tookthem instead of the medicine prescribed bythe doctor and at the end of that period itwas about New Years then Fred was sufficiently improved to be able to go outThe improvement was slow at first butit was sure I had unbounded faith in thepills as is evidenced by our continued use ofthem It was necessary for us to take Fredout of sehool on account of his illness butnow he has returned and can join in all thesports with his schoolmates and his healthis as good as we could wish He has neverbeen ill since and it is pretty safe to predictthat he will not be sick again for some timeYes I- have recommended Dr WilliamsPink Pills to my friends said Mrs Howsein reply to a question and many of themhave used them since I first read of thepills in the neAVspapersDr Williams Pink Pills for Pale Peopleare now given to the public as an unfailingblood builder and nerve restorer curing allforms of weakness arising from a waterycondition of the blood or shattered nervesThe pills are sold by all dealers or will besent post paid on receipt of price 50 cents abox or six boxes for 250 they are neversold in bulk or by the 100 bv

andnofavor saysMargaretSangster in Demorests Magazine We ask for nothing on the ground of sex We are walling to compete with and work with menon their own ground and desire to bemeasured by the same standards Wedemand nocourtesy further than thatwhich prevails between gentlemen weexpect no deference In business lifemen and women are simply workersand the more the element of ex is intruded the greater the interferencewith the success of womenI know a young woman who wentinto a newspaper office on a purely business errand to sell an article in factand was indignant because the reporters all of whom were busy writing did not jump to their feet and offerher a seat They were absorbed intheir work and most of them wereprobably unconscious of her presence iPerhaps 25 women enter the office of agreat New York daily every day Youcan easily see how it wguM interferewith business if the reporters shouldimmediately stop writing and pay them Ithe little attentions they are jtomed to in the drawing room Thewoman who expects these shows herignorance of business if they are nee-essary to her peace of mind she is out ofplace in tlie business worldShe If you were to find that I had lostah my
