Imbued with theidea of putting as much daylight aspossible between himself and theBourbon county jail he went to Kansas, presumably taking turns about onslow freight trains and oh Shanks' filly. "But a chicken thief can't go anywhere without being disturbed, especially if he happens to have monkeyedwith a Kentucky hen roost. Aboutninety-nine persons out of a hundredwould agree that when 'a trifiin',thievin' nigger' emigrates from Kentucky to Kansas it is a rather lhappysolution of an embarrassing problem ;in other words, a good riddance of badrubbish. Justice, however, nevergoes to sleep on a hen coop and thestrong arm is mighty to swat the baseblackamoor who dares lift a broiler ordisturb the peace and dignity of ashanghai rooster. Wherefore Rastusin Kansas is a subject ot requisition andthe Governor of Kentucky ha3 calledupon the Governor of the SunflowerState to give him up for transmissionback to Bourbon county, the scene ofhis unpardonable transgression."All this in the name and by theauthority of the Commonwealth, withthe great seal affixe d, in order thatthe strong arm may reach across theMississippi river and fetch Rastushome on a free excursion ticket, paidfor by the Commonwealth aforesaid.In lieu err so costly a valentine itwould have been better to have senthim a chromo and an indefinite ticketof leave, but the strong arm of thelaw is particularly strong on chickenthieves and is never bo active as whena big black coon abducts a modest andshrinking hen."Posthumous Growth."If you do good work your workwill grow after you are gone," "That'sa fact. Rubens left only some 2,000pictures, but there are 10,000 of hispictures in circulation now." Louisville Courier-Journal.Chosen Speaker &!

Here are thematches. Do you know, Hiram, Ithink it was the wisest thing we everdid when we concluded to stay intown this summer and not take thecottage at the lake as usual?""You do!" ejaculated Birdsell, pausing with a flaming match in the air. "Ithought you were completely upsetabout it when I said we'd better notgo. You ""Mercy me!" broke in Mrs. Birdsell,lifting her eyebrows prettily and smiling at him protestingly. "If you don'tknow me any better than that afterbeing maried to me ten years, Imust say you are unobservant! Don'tyou suppose I think you know best?What fun would it be for me to havethe cottage, knowing it was againstyour will and your best judgment?Hiram, I'm ashamed of you! Lots ofpeople stay in town, and I've no doubtwe can stand the heat as well as therest of them. It is just a matter ofmaking up your mind to be uncomfortable, and then forgetting it!""For the matter of that," said Birdsell, "I remember some days at thelake when you could have fried eggson the front porch and you would havebeen scalded if you had plunged intothe lake .to swim!""Oh, but the nights were so delightfully cool," said the wife. "Peoplehere were tossing sleepless and gasping, and there we had to sleep underblankets. But I don't suppose therewill be many such intolerable nightsin Chicago. I am sure I can standthem if I have to. And with all ourfriends away I won't have to haveany new clothes to speak of, andthat will, of course, save you a lot ofmoney.""I haven't asked you to economize,"Birdsell reminded her. "Go aheadand get any clothes you want, asusual.""What's the use?" inquired his wife,with a little sigh. "There'll be noone to see them. There won't be anyplaces to go except the summer gardens, and I can just as well wear myold things ""You know I never care to go to thesummer gardens ""Then, I suppose, we'll just sit athome on our own little porch and killtime," agreed Mr. Birdsell, resignedly. "We'll be quite a nice old marriedand settled down couple, won't we?That will be most delightful. TheLimpetts have taken their cottagedid I tell you about it?""You don't like the JLimpetts, sowhat difference does it 'make?""Not the slightest," agreed Mrs.Birdsell. "That woman certainly isthe most irritating creature! WhenI told her that we weren't going asusual she put on such an elaborate expression of pity and said that then, ofcourse, it must be true about yourgetting so badly squeezed in stocksand that she thought it was so verybrave and noble of us to econ ""Well, of all the nerve!" ejaculatedBirdsell, laying down his cigar."Didn't you explain that it was because business was so rushing that 1felt I couldn't get away?""Of course," said his wife. "Andshe just smiled. I hope people won'tthink we're in financial difficultiesmerely because we're staying at home.I don't care a bit about myself, but Ihate to have you misjudged. And youwere so enthusiastic about the placelast season that, of course I hope youwon't break down from overwork andno change before the summer is over.""Thunder!" growled Birdsell. "Youneedn't worry about me! I don'tknow why the populace should get upon its hind legs and roar because wechoose to do something else thanthe thing that we've been doing inpast summers.""Neither do I," agreed Mrs. Birdsell. "You know your own business,and if the Limpett's want to spend thereport up at the lake that we can't afford to come we can just v ignore it.It doesn't make any real differenceif people believe it, does it?""Well, I don't know," said Birdsell."I don't like it. Maybe I could getover a few times ""Now, Hiram," said his wife vigorously, "I just won't let you ever thinkof it! I'm not going to be cool andhappy over there, and leave you hereslaving in town! I won't hear of it!I'm not a bit disappointed, really, andmaybe the hot weather won't affectme so very much.""I think," said Birdsell decisively,"that I'll write the agent tomorrowthat we'll take the cottage. 'I thinkwe'd better go. It'll be pleasanter.""Well, of course, if you insist on it,Hiram," said his wife. "I wouldn't goagainst your wishes. I was quitecheerful about staying in town, and Inever dreamed that we'd really go.""Say," called Birdsell five minuteslater, "after he had been investigatinga package in the hall. "What is this?"Mrs. Birdsell gave a little cry."That?" she said, when cornered.

Only bv building up and byKeeping ud the fertility of the soil canlarge yields be continuously pro uced,but after this has been accomplishedgood farm management must be practiced in order to realize a good netprofit upon one's investment.Every farmer should know, to beginwith, what amounts of the plant foodelements, nitrogen, phosphorus ,andpotassium, are in his soil. All theother essential plane food elements arepresent in Kentucky soils in sufficientquantities for maximum yields ofcrops. These data can be furnished bythe Kentucky Agricultural ExperimentStation. The analyses ot tne tvpicalsoil.areas of Kentucky are now on fileat the Experiment Station, and if relatively accurate data cannot be furnished for any particular farm of thisstate, instructions for the collection oTsoil for analysis'will be furnished uponapplicatiun to Dr. A. M. Peter, headof the Division of Soil Chemistry ofthe Experiment Station, and free reDort will follow. Samples of soil tobe analyzed should always be takenaccording to instructions. Whether ornot lime is needed to correct soil acidity can be very readily determined byexperiment upon a small lot in connection with the sowing of -ed clover.The plowed surface of a soil shouldcontain not less than eight thousandpounds of nitrogen, two thousand fivehundred pounds of phosphorus and sixteen thousand pounds of potassium inorder that, in a favorable season andunder good tillage, it may be made toproduce a maximum crop of corn,wheat or oats. The soils of Kentucky,except in river bottoms and peatswamps, contains an abundance of potassium : steps should be taken to add,economically, these elements to aeontent necessary for large production,and a raw ground limestone should bapplied if experiment with red clovershows that the soil needs limestone.After normal fertility has been secured, it should be maintained, andone good factor in the maintenance isgood crop rotation. Crop rotationsmay vary in grain farming from thoseused in live stock farming, but in either case legume crons such as clover,alfalfa, cow peas, soy beans andsweet clover must be used to maintainthe supply.of nitrogen. In stock farming about every third crop should be alegume crop, and in grain farmingabout every second crop. By establishing crop rotations as above 'indicatedand by turning under sufficient manureand green crops to keep up the nitrogen content, the fertility of the soilcan be kept up, if in addition phosphorus in some form be added from timeto time in quantities corresponding tothose removed from the soil in cerealand forage crops and live stock. Thebasis for such computation will be furnished upon application to the Experiment Station.The location of farm buildings withreference to various parts of the farmand to each other, the laying out offields and fences, the establishing ofdraining systems, the working out ofcrop rotations, forms for farm accounting, etc., are among the problems otfarm management which bear a strongrelation to the success or failure of theowner of a farm.The Division of Extension of theKentucky Agricultural ExperimentStation, at Lexington, has decided tooffer assistance, as far as may be possible, to farmers of the State in solving problems of Foil fertility, in establishing cropping svstems uuon thewhole or a part of farms, in the Jpioduction of legume crops, and in working out farm management problems.This assistance will be offered throughcorrespondence, or when possible Iiyvisitation, without expense to owners.Tombstone Inscriptions.In tombstone inscrip'tions a man isnot upon oath.

James' colleaguein the Senate of the United Stateswould be highly plepsing to Presidentelect Wilson.This fact, which has an importantbearing on the Kentucky Senatorialhituation, has developed during thelast few davs from talks which correspondents have had with close and confidential friends of the President-electwhu know the benefit of fiis mind.Of course, Mr .Wilson has too muchpolitical sense to mix actively in localpolitical situations. Unless those whoknow him best are very much mistakpn, he will not declare for any candidate for United States Senator inKentucky. But at the same time he islooking to the State of Kentuckyto senda colleague to Ollie James who willhelp him put into effect true Jeffersonian principles.Close friends of President-elect Wilson believe that former Gov. Beckhamis the man among all Kentuckiansjto teof greatest aid to the President-electin the role of a Senator. They knowthat Beckham will work in harmonywith Mr. Wilson and thai his intelligent co-operation would be very va'uable to the incoming President.Beckham's idea on public questionsare known by Wilson's advisers to bein exact accord with thGse of the President-elect.Both are procressive and both havetne courage or tneir convictions intheir championship of progressive principles, whether such principles lelateto the elimination of the" graft fromthe tariff or uhat not. The closefriends of Wilson are not slow to recall that the former Gov. Beckhamalone among the Senatorial aspirantswas the original Kentucky. champunof Woodrow Wilsun fcr themesidencv and the fight he made for Wilson at Baltimore is by no means foigotten. While it is not probable that Mr.Wilson himself will give any public indication that he would prefer Beckham, as that would be considered aninvasion of state matters, neverthelessthe prayers of the Wilson leaders willbe that success may come'to Beckham.It might be added that the generalview in Washington ia that Beckhamhas got the fight won already handsdawn.Interest Increases in Hotel.With subscriptions amounting talmost S20.0C0 the enlistment of stocknoit:ers in tne new noiei project is urogressing rapidlv and the nromoters.Messrs.
