The crop in Bourbon will see the knife

racing. One of the best fairs' in the
State took place in July and now a
move is on foot to hold fall trotting

any aid-possible in order to make it a
success.
FACTS IN. ADVERTISING.
Presistency is the most important
factor in advertising keep ham
mering and you will get results.
Persistent advertising in a poor
space position is more effective than
intermittent advertising in a good
position. It is not profitable to let your
firm name disappear from the columns
of your newspaper.
Change of advertising copy is essen
tial; but not too frequently. It is bek
ter to present good idea several times
than to present several poor ideas at
any time.
Large advertisements have propor
tionately greater drawing power than
s,mall ones. Increasing your space in
proportion to the increase jn your bus
iness, is a sound sales policy.
Nothing is more irritating than a
poorly worded advertisement. "Koal
I "Kow," "Kake" and "Mister" belong to
, the barbarous age of advertising.
Advertisements that breed ideas are
more effective than those that at
tempt to force tehir acceptance. No
body likes to be commanded to buy;
but nearly everybody can be easily
induced to do so by proper sugges
tion or advice or by a statement of
facts.
An advertisement that answers a
question exigtingTh the mind of a pros
pect is more effective than one that
attempts to both ask and answer a
question. The use of "why" is apt to
teach people the bad habit of asking
questions in return instead of listen
ing to advice.
Advertisements that present one
idea briefly and forcibly are more
powerful than those embodying sev
eral ideas illogically stated. Brevity
is the soul of an effective advertise
ment. LUKE McLUKE SAYS:
No matter how busy a woman may
be, she can always find time to worry
for fear someone will kidnap the chil
dren. What has becom of the old-fashioned
girl who used to cover plates and
bottles with cigar bands?
Charity begins at home. That's
why the man who owes you 510 passes
you up so he caji give a dollar to the
Heathen.
'-The only hats in thes tore that are
becoming to a woman are the ones
she can't afford.
No man ever grew a flock of chin
whiskers that were a good substitute
for a chin.
A woman can worry over the possi
bility of something happening that
would give her something to worry
about.
When a man has nothing to say, it
usually takes him a long time to say
it.
As long as a man has 2 hairs left
he always wonders if he .will ever
grow bald.
Once in a while a man forgets him
self in public and is actually polite to
his own wife.
There are too many men hunting
for positions and dodging jobs.
In the novels the females who have
been disappointed in love are all sin
gle. In real life they are married.
A man who says he loves his ene
mies should be classified as the Irish
man classified the man who said he
liked olives. Cincinnati Enquirer.

BRITAIN'S SUNLESS VILLAGE
In the valley of the Lyn, near Lyn
mouth, North Devon, there is a quaint
little hamlet called Middlehtfm, where
for three months in the year the sun
is not seen.
The cluster of houses forming that
hamlet is surrounded on all sides by
hills so steep and so high that from
November to February the sun does
not rise high enough to be seen over
their tops.
Thej first appearance of the sun is
eagerly looked for, and as it is first
'seen on February 14 the inhabitants
call it their valentine.
If theHay should be foggy or cloudy
so that it cannot be seen, there is
great disappointment, especially
among the children. '
For the first few days after the 14th
the sun is only seen for a short time,
but as the sun rises higher in the
heavens the time it is in sight in
creases daily until its height is
reached when it gradually begins to
fade from view again, until in Novem
ber it entirely vanishes for another
three months.

In many Chinese cities an expert
shirt maker who does good work can
be hired for 10 cents a day to make
shirts. to measure, at least for native
customers, and he will turnout not less
than ones hirt a day, for an indefinite
period. All of which discourages the
trade of dealers in ready-made gar
ments of even moderate cost. The
materials, of course, are of approxi
mately equal value'in both cases.
Cloudy ice may be from one-third
to two-fifths less efficient in cooling
than transparent ice, stated M. Tab
oury at the Toulouse Congress of Cold.
It appears taht the heat absorbed in
the melting of clear ice is remarka
bly constant, and never varies ,more
than 5 per cent. Cloudy, ice, on the
other hand, is very vanablet some
times absorbing as much heat as clear
ice, though usually much less.
In Knasas City both the men and
the women who work in offices are

sex. A woman writes to the Kansas
City Star to complain because men re
move their coats when at work. A
