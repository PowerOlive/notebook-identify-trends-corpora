Marchand hasbeen heard from His report uponwhich much depends reached CairoThursday and has been forwarded toParis by telegraph in cipher and thework of deciphering began Fridaymorning It is asserted that the report makes no mention of the visit oiGen Kitchener to FashodaIt gives it is said only an accountof the march of the expedition witbmention of the places occupied and anencounter with DervishesIt is believed in some quarters thatCapt Maratier is the bearer of a report which the French are not willing to trust upon British telegraphiinesNot a man was lost by Marchand inhis marchThe Radical says it is informed thatPremier Brisson has no intention ofresigningPreparations for war by France andEngland continue to agitate press andpublic It was thought some days agothat the Fashoda incident was practically settled and a semi official announcement to that effect wasBut a snag- seems to have loomed up somewhere and talk of war andpreparation for such an event occupypublic attentionThe French press is in no mannerharsh in its comment Their underlying tone indicates a belief that thenegotiations will reach an amicableconclusionParis Oct 22 A remarkable changehas come over French opinion on theFashoda question during the last 4Shours The attitude of the public is Jmore inflamed and more defiant Thisis partly due to the tone of the Britishpress but more to the threateningspeech of the British chancellor of theexchequer Sir Michael Hicks Beachwhich the Autorite calls A provocation that is almost a threat of warThe municipal council of Paris isaccused on all sides of exhorting thegovernment to avert war In government circles the disposition seems tobe to resist the British demandsIt is reported that the policy ofFrance as definitely stated to GreatBritain includes the retention of Fashoda Rumors that the foreign minister Count Muravieff has assured MDel Cassee the French foreign minister of Russias support in the controversy tend to stiffen the backs of thehigher officials although these continue to maintain a conciliatory toneand declare that France is prepared tocarry amiability to the utmost limitsconsistent with her rights and dignityWITHOUT

mourned tinesemi deception in which she had indulged in having against his wishesbrought her former friend within hergates But now he looked urjon Harriet as being quiite sufficientljpunislhedand equally willing that Mrs McLancvshould take herself elsewhere Iftherefore Merriam should see her anddo or refuse to do that which she demanded of him Grafton felt that hemight speed his parting guest and relieve not only his own but his fair wifesshoulders of a heavy load He waslate reaching stables a fact burly oldBuxton would be quick to notice and asquick to rebuke He had delayed onlya minute or two after the sounding ofthe call because he wished to have hisinterview over and done with The menof his troop were already leading outas he came in sight of the long row ofyellow washed rookeries that passedfor stables and it annoyed him to behailed on fihe way one after anotherby these two admirers of so much thathe couldnt admire at all Then as luckwould have it the lieutenant colonelwas the next to accost him and to remark that he was five minutes latewhich wasnt so but couldnt be contradicted and Grafton was gritting histeeth when he reached his troop Hewas in no mood to talk diplomaticallywith Merriam just then and knew itand was thankful that the lieutenantwas still another stable beyond whenwho should appear walking rapidlyback from the bank where the horseswere

captainsface as though burning with eagernessto read his full meaningVery well I will come right after retreat Surely five minutes ought to beenough he said at length and thenwent thoughtfully homewardBut retreat parade came within soshort a time after Graftons return tohis quarters that his message to MrsMcLane covered that lady with consternation What Meet Bandy Merriam when she had less

himwas very wan and flittingShe said she would after a little Itold her youd be in right after parade but and the but had a mournful tone to itI had to stop a moment on the waydear A matter I promised to attendto and again he bent and laid his lipsupon her brow then pressed them tohers Time was and only a few daysgone by when she used to meet thatfond caress with a kiss as fond as lingering as his

twitch and the lips to tremble andthen despite every- effort she turnedback to her pillow and burst into a passion of tears great sobs shaking herslender frame from head to footFlorence Florence he cried inutter dismay and trouble What is itsweetheart What is it my pet myprecious Ah dont turn from me likethat You are n ot well my own or youwould not break my heart by shrinkingfrom me What can I have said to sodistress you And now he would takeno denial but had clasped his armsabout her and drawn her to his breastagain and began kissing away her tearsand striving to check her sobbing Itwas uselessOh let me cry let me cry shepleaded its what I needAnd so in pain and bewilderment heyielded to her wish and strove to content himself with murmuring softsoothing words and holding her closeto his heart and at last the storm oftears seemed drifting away and shecould speak in answer to his pleadingand presently she looked one instantinto his eyes and beganDo you think could we go backto the cantonment for just a littlewhileWhy Floy darling weve only justcome from thereI know And yet and yet oh itseems months years since sincethen And now the sobs again became uncontrollable and in dread

there were signs of unusuallife and stir about the infantry barracks Quickly he mounted the stairsand again knelt by the side of his youngwife She was quieter now but evidently weak from the violence of heremotion if from no other cause Smiling sympathetically Mrs Haynearose from her place near the head ofthe sofa that he might come closer andfold Florence in his arms as she feltsure Florence wished to be folded andBandy did come nearer and took theslender hand in his and spoke tenderlyand fondly and bent again and kissedthe pale forehead lingeringly and allthis Florence seemed to accept

minutes after the dispatches began coming in just after retreat andMerriani wouldnt tellThe first dispatch was from department headquarters and bade thecolonel hold his entire regiment readyfor instant duty and a journey by railBux was with him when it came andtogether they had gone to the officeThen was handed in another which thecolonel read but did not pass over tohis second in command On the contrary he thought a bit and sent forMr Merriam and took him to one sideand had a conversation with him offive minutes duration that was inaudible to everybody else Bux did catcha word or two but

Very Important Factor in the Management of a SuccessfulGeneral FarmII appearances are facts seldom indeed is there a farmer who appreciatest hex real worth of a covered barnyardAt any rate those seen by the writer inhis travels over and about the countryhave been exceedingly few and far between A covered barnyard just thesame is a very important factor in farmmanagement it not only being possiblewith it to keep manure from leaching-tiven in the slightest degree but preserves it to a certainty from that hatefulconsumer of the majority of manureheaps fi re fa ngingWith a covered barnyard one shouldtmtiply -wheel out the manure daily andthrow some litter over it Thus dealtwith Hie cattle will run over it andMl 11 1 ICOVERED BARNYARDkeep it so closely packed that too rapid heating is an impossibility A covered barnyard also affords stock achance to exercise and secure fresh airwithout exposure to storms and coluwinds no matter what the period ofthe year may be and for sheep thatlamb in the spring it is just the placein which they can winter the opinion of man 3 being that sheep clothedwith a thick fleece of wool as they arethrive better on an average when thehave a cool situation To justify thishowever it is imperative that the barnyard be enclosed all around exceptthat part facing to the south with feedracks for the animals arranged at thesides Sheep can be wintered in thismanner with but very little troubleHave you a barn something like theupright shown in the accompanyingillustration If so attach on theFunny side of it the addition that is represented which is in the virtual sensetwo wings with a roof spanning boththe roof space to be used as storage forhay grain or other crops it opening directly onto the second floor of the barnThe wings may be best utilized for thehousing of any kind of stock pigs pouli ry waives colts or sheep This simpliiies the work other conditions beingequal Since all the farm stock is gathered into one place and practically under one roof the whole arrangement becomes a labor saving machine so tospeak of the highest order the covered yard thus secured being adjacentto all the stock quarters aiidso t

arrangement furthermore secures constant circulationof air through the yard removing allundesirable fumes arising and1 keepingthe whole pure and sweet and thistinmy judgment is the proper construction for while it makes the yard colder it will be rendered unfit for useonly during a few dajs of the winterand then a temporary obstruction tothe cold may be put up at the openspace between wing and barn

NEWS PARIS KY TUESDAY OCTOBER 251898PREPARING THE SOILUnless It Be Done Carefully tlte IV imter Wheat Crop Will XotBe SatisfactoryA good deal of success or failure inthe production of winter wheat liesin the preparation of the soilIt is ta be regretted that so manyfields are put in in a slipshod mannerFarmers adopting this method willgrowl because they do not make a success of winter wheat and will foreverafter let the other fellow grew wheatwhile they stick to something theyknow will respond to little labor andthoughtThe old time method of summer fallow has about passed out of use but itis modified to a certain degree byplowing the land intended for wheatas early as possible In this way muchof the summer fallow result is securedThe soil needs exposure to the air inorder to promote chemical changesthat result in an increase of availablefood for the plants It needs time forsuch tillage that the particles of soilmay be well mixed and their positionstowards each other changed It requires time to become solid beneaththe surface as a result of fall rainsAn old rule in English agriculture isto the effect that land that is to bearwheat cannot be too old or too solidprovided 1hat it is fertile and freefrom weeds and that there is enoughloose loair at the surface to cover theseed These successful wheat growers hold that firm standing is required for the healthy developmentand proper ripening of wheat In proofof this we have often observed that thfbest wheat is found at the ends wherethere has been the most tramping doneby men and teams The best bed is onethat is prepared early and pulverizedwell and which receives surface workings regularly until the time of seeding comesWe have in mind a very successfulgrower of winter wheat who will notgrow wheat if he cannothave the condition necessary for a good seed bedThe best ground for wheat is a fieldwhich has been to oats the previous3ear As soon as the oats are removedthe ground is plowed comparativelyshallow in fact it is plowed about asshallow as can be done to turn underthe growth of stubble and weeds Assoon as plowed it is disked and harrowed and about once per week untilseeding time the land should be harrowed The harrowing and the tramping of the teams on the field togetherwith the rains if there are any will fitthe ground well for wheat For selection of ground the level lan i is considered best and it may be either valley land or upland The next bestland is a southeast slopePreparing ground for wheat in growing corn or after the corn has been removed is not carried on with that success required by the most practicalwheat growers Good and effectualwork cannot be done in the growingcorn even if the wheat grower has afine hoe or drill for the purpose ofdrilling To get the corn off the fieldmeans a great deal of labor that theaverage western wheat grower doesnot care to undertake and it makes thetime of seeding rather late for bestresults If it is not possible to cut thecorn and haul it off the field it maybewell to make the shock rows far apartand prepare the ground between therows for wheat The best tool for preparing this kind of ground for wheat isfound in the disc harrow followedthoroughly with a smoothing harrowThe limited time will not permit asmuch work as in the stubble groundIowa TTomesteadCORN HUSKING BENCHCan Be Made of Any Size Desired andIs Really a Very

andlook well can be made by anyone whohas the time and patience if they follow these directionsIn some communities one can earnconsiderable money weaving hair Itrequires no tools which any man cannot makeTake a board about four feet longand six inches wide Drive an eightor ten penny nail in one end so thatit will stand upright when the boardis lying downDrive three nails at the other endabout two inches apart Use No 8black cotton Some prefer linen orsilk but they are not as durable ascottonTie the thread to the nail that isstanding alone then carry to one ofthe outside nails at the other endwind two or three times arounddrawing the threadtightWindaround then back to the center oneand wind then back to the single oneand back to the last outside one Windaround and tie firmlyThis is the only tool with the exception of comb and shearsCut hair needs very little preparation Have a dish of water and takeout locks about as large as a twineor a little larger Wet the top of thehair and clip the ends off smoothlyIf the hair is uneven take the topand hold firmly in the left hand Withthe right thumb and forefinger takehold of the bottom ends of the longesthair loosen the left hand just enoughso that the long hair can be pulled outSmooth and trim the top again andlay by itself Keep doing this till allthe longest is saved out b itself Thiswill make the outside of the switchsmooth Tie a thread tightly aroundthe threads about four inches from thesingle nail on the board Take theboard on your lap having the singlenail toward you the other end restingon something Take a lock of the

under the right hand overthecenterandtindertheleft hand backover the left hand under the centerand over the right hand Take thethumb and forefinger of the left handand draw the hair tight up to wherethe thread is tied around With theother draw the hair down tight lengthways Proceed in this manner till thehair is all woven It is better to havesome short hair for the lower end asshort as six inches It will make amuch better formed switch When itis finished hold the hair so it will notslip out cut the threads and tie themfirmly then cut the other end and tiethem For the stems use silk cord alittle larger than wrapping twineDouble the cord and sew it throughabout a half an inch from trie doubledend Without breaking the threadjtake the switch at the end having thelongest hair and fasten it to the cordThe short ends of the hair will be onthe upper side of the board when it iswoven When sewing it on lay thelong hair over back and keep windingand sewing it around the cord keeping the short ends down between thecord and the woven part of the switchIf the switch is short do not wind itver3 close together after it has beensewed about three or four inches Ifit is very short it will need to be leftstraight at the lower edge Sew tothe cord as the rest is only do notwind it around When all sewed turnit down and comb it out It will besnarled so that you who make onemay think it spoiled but brushing andcombing will make It all right Tomake one of combings is more tediousbut they will make a good one if properly saved One should never windcombings around the fingers if theyare saving them for a switch Takethem loosely off the comb and putthem in a box that can be closed tighto as to not have the hair get full ofdust An oilcloth apron and sleevesare very useful as the hair will notstick to them as to cloth If one hasiot these take a paper and spread onthe lap and then take a bit of thecombings and pull apart looselyVhen it is all loosened up take a largehandful and pull it from one hand tothe other a good deal as one pulls taffyWhen it is pulled till a good lot of Itlays straight take it in the center andbold and comb each end then withthumb and finger pull out the longestlocks and put them as even as they canbe Comb out again keep the endsthat weave in wet after ihej arestraightened while working on it Pullout the longest hair for the top thesame as in a cut

Besides MakingShoes ButTwo men were talkingWhat I admire among our artisan classsaid one with the air of a superior personis a little broader knowledge than is defined by the mere walls of his shop NowI have in mind two shoemakers whom 1see occasionally as they are both tenantsof mine Both of them are prompt industrious honest men but one is as ignorantas he can he even about the details of hisown trade Why I asked him the otherday where shoe pegs were made and ofwhat wood and he hasnt the least ideaand I had to tell him On the contrarythe other one not only knew that muchbui was up on the history of shoes andtheir material and manufacture iiJ hinterested me for half an hour by a mostinstructive talk on his occupation Thereis a vast difference I think between twomen situated as those two are and it isgreatly to the credit of one that he acquires knowledge not because it is absolutely necessary but because of his desireto broaden and see something more thanwhat may dangle at a waxend or spreaditself over a side of sole leather Dont youthink as I doUm er hesitated the other man Iknow your two shoemakers and have hadwork done by both of them and I noticeanother difference that you probably overlookedI knew you would responded the firstman rubbing his hands with pleasureYes continued the other the manwho only knows how to make shoes canmake shoes and the other chap
