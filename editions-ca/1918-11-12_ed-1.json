twenty-three, one of the most popular

died at her home in that city last
week after a brief illness of pneumo

could not throw off the dread disease.
She was a leading church , worker

VICTORY BOYS AND GIRLS -TO
HELP U. W. W. CAMPAIGN.
The Victory Girls, an, auxiliary
organization, formed to assist in the
United War Work Campaign, has
been launched in Bourbon County by
a number of the county's patriotic
young women.
The aim of the Victory Girls in
Bourbon County will be to raise
$2,500 towards Bourbon's quota in
the big United War Work Campaign,
and already a number of young
ladies are at work on the task.
Miss Louie Bruer, of Paris,, is
Chairman of Bourbon. County, and
the county has been divided into
twenty sections, the twenty regular
voting precints being the units.
Fropi each of these twenty units a
Captain is named, who in turn is to
assist in securing 510 members from
Bourbon County.
At North Middletown, Miss Marie
Collins has been designated as Cap
tain, and Mrs. C. M. Best has been
appointed Captain at- Millersburg.
The Victory Boys, another organi
zation whose purpose is to also assist
in the United War Work Campaign,
is being perfected in Bourbon
County by Bourbon's patriotic young
men.
THE STUDENTS' ARMY TRAINING
CORPS.
The War Department has issued in
structions defining its policy in re
gard to the change in educational re
quirements for admission to the col
legiate section, Students' Army
Training Corps. An effort is being
made to keep these units up to au
thorized strength. Due to the press
ing need for officers in all branches
of the service, men are continually
being transferred to Officers' Train
ing Camps. A new system of re
cruiting these sections is being work
ed out, and pending its completion,
the War Departpnent directs that in
stitutions where present number of
inducted men is less than its author
ized quota may certify for induction
such students who do not have the
prescribed units, but whom the head
of the institution and the command
ing officer of the unit, jointly, be
lieve to be competent to pursue one
of the programs prescribed. Due con
sideration will he given to such high
school training as applicants are rel
evant "to the making of ah officer.
The purpose of the foregoing ar
rangement is not to abolish educa
tional standards, hut to permit such
relaxation as is necessary to bring
the strength of the crops toitsa total.
Students" ,xArpiy- "Training Corps
should apply by mail immediately
the educational institution of his
choice for detailed information.

CENTRAL KENTUCKY SOLDIERS
IN MEUSE FRONT BATTLE. j
Chief of Staff General March said
that the S8th Division (Kentucky
and. west Virginia), has not been re
ported -since October 23, when it was
m action west of the Meuse.
The 38th Division comprises the
old Louisville Legion, and the Second
and Third Kentucky guard regiments.
Tnousands of Central and Eastern.
Kentucky boys are' with the 28 th Di
vision, reported by General March to
be in action along the Meuse front.
The Thirty-eighth was trained at
Capnp Shelby, Hattfesburg, Miss., af
ter being mobilized at Camp Stanley,
Lexington. Few families in this sec
tion of the State are not represented
ic this division and if hostilities con
tinue news from the Meuse front will
be watched with intense interest.
The Thirty-eighth only recently
embarked for overseas. If fact, it has
been but a few weeks since contin
gents of that division passed through
Central Kentucky enroute to the
Eastern coast.
A USEFUL CITIZEN.
"That man is a valuable man to
his community," said a farmer the
other day, pointing out a rather undistinguished-looking
man. I listen
ed to hear what remarkable thing the
man so spoken of had been doing, and
the farmer went on: "He is a black
smith and a good one, He can fix
anything that gets wrong from an
automobile down."
For a minute I was disappointed.
I had thought from the farmer's
speech to hear of something unusual.
Then I realized that he was exactly
right about it. The skilled back
smith, the skilled carpenter, the skill
ed workman of any kind is a valua
ble asset to the rural community.
Many farming neighborhoods suffer
for lack of such men. The man who
has the jmanual skill to do well any!
kind of needed repair or construc
tion work is a man for the commu
nity to cherish and to be proud of.
The country .needs mqre really com
petent blacksmiths, and wagon mak
ers and stone masons and carpenters
and cabinet makers. The young man
who masters any of these trades has
a useful future before him, and prac
tically all farpi boys need to learn
to do more with their hands.
