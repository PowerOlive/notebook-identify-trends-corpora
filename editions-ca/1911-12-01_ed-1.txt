Robbing immigrantsand emigrants has long been a recognized Industry around the docks ofNew York and proprietors of lodginghouses have been taking money awayfrom these people coming and going.Two laws recently became operativeby which lodging house keepers willbe compelled to give the arriving anddeparting persons of foreign birthsomething like the equivalent formoney received.Foreigners arrive all the yeararound, but those who depart for avisit to the old country generally hegin coming to New York about October 1 and continue coming until theChristmas holidays.

No matter what country the arriving emigrant came from, there was some runner to talk to him in his native language. When the boat had docked the runners led their victims to some lodging house, where they were made welcome as long as they had money. Itoften happened that an immigrantbound for some inland town and provided with a railway ticket would bedetained in New York as long as hehad money and then loaded on a trainto go hungry to his destination. Those,who go back to the "old country" inthe fall on a visit are not so easy.Agents of the lodging houses, however, meet western trains, sometimesriding several hours out from NewYork, in search of customers. Personsthus obtained as patrons for a lodging house were furnished every opportunity to see New York while waiting for the steamer and a good manyof them were out of money whensailing time came.Under the new laws the runners areno longer allowed to board boats orswarm around the docks soliciting patronage and every lodging house keeperhas to furnish a bond for the fairLinton, Ind.

John Stanton of Aurora and his missing sister, Mrs.G. W. Waters of Philadelphia, whomhe has not seen for 20 years, have beenreunited through a moving picture film,and the Aurora man has gone to makehis future home with his relative.Mrs. Waters is an actress who paidher last visit to her brother almosta quarter of a century ago when shewas appearing at the Park theater inBrooklyn. Correspondence finally wasdropped and Mr. Stanton waited yearafter year for some word from thewoman. Recently his attention wascalled to a theater poster in Auroraand the striking resemblance betweenthe woman and his long-lost sistercaused him to buy a ticket for the performance. As the drama was cast on the screenhe recognized the nurse to the youngheroine in the drama as his sister. Hesought out the manager, obtained theaddress of the film company, and ultimately located her in Philadelphia. Herecently returned from a ten weeksvisit and goes back to pass the remainder of his life at her home.Stanton, who is 73 years old, wasborn in New York and served In thenavy during the Civil war at the Brooklyn navy yards. After the war hemoved west and became a farmer. Afew years ago he moved to Aurora.The Stantons have been of a dramatictendency and most of them have beenactors and actresses. Mrs. Waters hasbeen on the stage for 46 years and expects to remain there the rest of herlife. Stanton's nephew, Barry O'Neal,Is stage maanger for a film company,while Mrs. O'Neal writes many of theirpicture dramas.This Is the second time that a moving picture film has been the meansof bringing together separated relatives. Two years ago a moving picture in Goshen, Ind., showed an ostrich farm.

John Hampton, a prosperous auto dealer, recently returnedfrom South Africa, bringing a largeape, which he christened "Dare-DevilSpike." He and Spike found accommodations at Ike Hirschorn's hotelhere, and one day Hampton let Spike"set 'em up" for everyone in the hotel bar. This gave Spike his firstdrink, and gave him the desire for it.Nobody minded much, however, untilthe monkey drifted downstairs fromits master's room shortly before dawnand gave a good Imitation of a Pittsburgh millionaire on a spree.One morning recently before the barroom was opened for the day the apeappeared to have a thirst of the sortwhich only seasoned drinkers are supposed to possess. Spike sneaked outof Hampton's room, slid down the banister and deftly entered the bar roomthrough an open transom. When CallHassenfleck, Hirschorn's lunch-counterman, appeared on the scene shortlyafter 5:00 a. m. he found Spike in thestate of exhilaration peculiar to somecollege students after, winning a football game.Spike greeted Hassenfleck with ashrill cry of welcome, followed by aheavy tumbler, which missed theman's right ear only because Hassenfleck had learned to dodge in hisyouth. Jimmy Samponl, a porter,went to the lunch man's rescue,wjth the result that the two menpassed an unenviable time hiding behind the lunch counter In a storm offalling steins, bottles, plates, knives,forks, and other objects.

Gaby Deslys, yj'ho iscredited by common report ijrijh hav-lag overthrown the kingdom rpt Portugal by infatuating King Manuel andenticing from him what was left inlie royal treasury, is now here to filliprofesslonal engagements. She says- he is to receive $18,000 a week and itIs probable that some- of the 18,000will be real money. She brought a bewildering array of clothes and jewelsv and also her reputation asa monarchy' -destroyer.The wonder is that this talented actress has not come over sooner. Whythis strange delay? A lady with aredolent past and the destroyer of- monarchy, she certainly had a right toexpect sympathy and appreciation inrepublican America from the first.The only reason imaginable for herdelay in coming to the country towhich foreign artists hasten to maketheir money as a rule is that she is soimodest she did not realize the extentiof her exploit. No doubt she said toiherself that Manuel was such a little; .J Gaby Deslys.jldng that his destroying siren wouldJhardly receive credit for having doneanything worth while.And, to tell the truth, Mafiuel was a.very little king even at his best. Toone who knew him as intimately as(Mile. Deslys he probably seemedjeven smaller than he appeared to thelaverage newspaper reader. Comparedeven with a medium king like the late'Leopold of Belgium, he paled into Insignificance. But the people over here are not socarping and critical as to hold thatagainst her. She took the only kingthat was probably in sight at the timand If he didn't happen to be on.whose conduct amounted to very mm.internationally, that was the lady'misfortune and not her fault She dlihtr best with the material at hand. Ofcourse, her reception would naturallybe a little warmer and her receipts alittle larger if she had managed tobring down larger game from the European ropal preserves. Had she donethat, it might not have been necessaryfor her to go to the trouble even ofdancing in order to make the show asuccess.

Bailey's horsesnorted in terror at this unexpectedmove by Mother Bruin, and whirledabout in the road so sharply that thewagon was upset and the mail andmall carrier spilled out in the dust.As Bailey picked himself up hepulled his automatic revolver out ofhis pocket and fired at the bear,which was almost on him. The bulletwent true, and she rolled over in theroad, snarling and clawing. Sheseemed to have enough of battle, forthe next minute she picked herselfup and scampered off into the woodswith the cubs, leaving a trail of bloodbehind her.As soon as the shaken Bailey couldcollect himself, he caught his horses,which had stopped after running ashort distance down the road, and,with the aid of a party of autoiststhat came along soon after he rightedhis wagon and hitched up.KICKS CHILD OFF TRACKEngineer Runs Out on Pilot and SavesLittle One Just inTime.Glenwood, Minn.

Thering of the car bellsand the voices uponthe streets seem totake on a more cheery tone, and thespirit of the time seems to throw aglamour over places and things whichordinarily are devoid of all beauty.As it is with places, so it is withpeople. They, too, not only seem tochange, but the transformation doestake place in millions of hearts to agreater or less degree- The spirit ofChristmas even affects people who forthe rest 'of the year are devoid ofsentiment and of feeling for their fellows. The most interesting storiesof Christmastide are those which' willnever appear in print true stories ofmen and women whose thoughts havebeen only of their own selfish aimsand pleasures, but have been awakened, if only for a day or two, fromtheir usual self-complacency, movedby some force of which they are onlyhalf-conscious to do some act of kindness to make the day happier forsomeone less fortunate than themselves 1n a worldly way.

Harvey J. O'Higgins.It is interestingtrace the originfestival customsthose connected withDruidical superstitionsof classic observances,and It will surprisemany to learn thatpresent-day sports veryclosely resemble the celebrations observed of old In honor of Saturn orBacchus.The Roman Saturnalia, which occurred In the winter solstice, were aseason of great festivity and rejoicing,honored by many privileges and exemptions. The spirit of gaiety hadfree charter, and even quarrels weresuspended, to be resumed after theholidays.As a manifestation of the gratitudefelt at the renewed prospects of thereturning march of the sun, gifts wereexchanged and special hymns weresung. These latter were really theRoman representatives of the moderncarol.At the Saturnalia the Roman feasted, sang and danced, as we do atChristmas. A ruler or king was appointed, who enjoyed certain prerogatives. He presided over the sports ofthe season. Probably he is the ancestor of the lord of misrule, who exercised a similar power in more re.cent times.Merriment was a matter of generalconcern, and the joyous spirit of entire districts is now narrowed to family parties. yIt is the touch that makes thewhole world kin, and it is a pleasantreminder that, after all, history; repeats itself.Administrator's Notice.All persons knowing themselves indebted to the estate of the late Mrs.Mary B.
