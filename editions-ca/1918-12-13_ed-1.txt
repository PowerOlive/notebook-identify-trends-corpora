Hutchcraft, Jr., Makes theSupreme Sacrifice for His Country.One of Bourbon's Favorite Sons is Killed in Actionin the Great World War For Democracy. ,After weeks of anxious inquiries tothe War Department an'd throughother and more private sources, during which time the hearts of friendsand relatives alternated betweenhope and fear, official tidings at lastcame to Paris of the fate of one of itsmost distinguished citizens. A telegram from the War DepartmentTuesday night to Mr. R. B.' Hutchcraft, of Paris, told of the death ofhis son, Capt. Reuben B. Hutchcraft,Jr., as follows:"Washington, D. C, 12-10-191S."Mr. R. B. Hutchcraft,"135 Houston Avenue,"Paris, Ky."Deeply regret to inform you thatCaptain Reuben R. Hutchcraft,Junior, Infantry, is officially reported as killed in action November six."HARRIS, The Adj't Gen'l."For weeks relatives and friends ofthe valiant young Bourbon countysoldier tortured by the silence thatattended their efforts to get news ofhis probable fate, hoped against hope,arid finally became convinced thatbad news lay behind the wall of silence. Although in a way preparedthe copaing of the telegram Tuesdaynight, cast a gloom over the community, as the sad news went with therapidity of lightning from one to another. Capt. Hutchcraft was thirty-twoyears old and had been a resident ofParis all his life. He studied m theschools of Paris and attended Transylvania University and the University of Kentucky, graduating withhigh honors. He made an especiallyfine record in the School of Law atthe University of Kentucky, and after graduation was selected to delivera course of lectures on. law to thenew classes, in which duty he wonadditional honors. He also graduated at Harvard, where he won thehonors due to an earnest student.Returning to Paris he became interested in politics. He was a memberof the Kentucky Legislature, inwhich he served for two terms, declining the nomination for a thirdterm, in order to take care of a profitable legal business. During his termsin the Legislature he -framed andsuccessfully engineered the passageand enactjment into law of theHutchcraft Sunday closing law andother legal measures. He was appointed in 1917 as a member of theState Tax Commission by GovernorStanley. The present State tax lawwas largely the result or his enoris.He had given the subject of taxationmuch thought and the knowledgethus gained was of invaluable service to the Commission in its labors.Personally he was one of the mostpopular young men in the county andhad friends who admired him for hisfei.iiiinnt finalities of mind and heart,and to whom the sad news of hisdeath in far-away France came iiea thunderstroke. He absorbed andassimilated knowledge with a readiness that stood him fn good steadwhen the occasion came to use it. Hewas a fluent and most interestingconversationalist, a learned attorney,and; although only thirty-two yearsold, had won a high position as astatesman and an attorney-at-law.When the call came to the colorsin smmnrt of the country's entranceinto cthe- great striiggler to. rid the,world of autocracy, Reuben Hutqhigraft's patriotism, could not-, .aUc&ttTjmm to remain lcue, ana ne ennsiea inthe officer's training camp at ortBenjamin Harrison, where .his abilitysoon won recognition and his meritijmpelled promotion. He went toFrance as a member of the famousRainbow Division, having won therank of Lieutenant in the infantrybranch. He participated in the buttle of St. Mihiel Sailent, in whichthe Captain of his company was killed. Lieut. Hutchcraft was commissioned to take the dead officer's placeand led the men in the next charge.Commenting on this in a brief noteto his parents, Capt. Hutchcraft stated: "We have just pulled off thebiggest show the Americans havebeen in yet. My boys have coveredthemselves with glory." Never aword as to his own gallant conductin that charge. The company captured two hundred prisoners, twentyseven (machine guns, four cannon;and a large amount of ammunitionand booty, besides taking possessionof four towns.Capt. Hutchcraft is survived by hisparents, Mr. and Mrs. R. B. Hutchcraft, and two sisters, Misses Helenand Mary ithian Hutchcraft, ofParis.In the death of Capt. ReubenHutchcraft, Bourbon county has added another illustrious name to thelist of those who have sacrificed theirlives in the defense of right as opposed to might, for democracy as opposed to autocracy, for freedom asopposed to brutality, for home andfor country's sake. Ever and everthrough the ages his name will be areminder to the young men of thiscity and county of the noble impulsesthat can ipnpel a young man to makesuch a sacrifice, when only a fewweeks intervened between hi,m and apossible release from military dutiesand with a glimpse of home and relatives in a possibly .soon-to-be homecoming. When Governor Stanley heard ofthe death of Captain Hutchcraft hesent the following telegram to Mrs.R. B. Hutchcraft, mother of the deadofficer:"All who knew your brave andgifted boy share your sorrow. Inlife and death alike, he gladly answered duty's every call. His briefpilgrimage was filled with achiere(inents of the highest order, a ripescholar, an accomplished jurist, anable statesman and above all a nobleman and every inch a hero.

There is only one way to curecatarrhal deafness, and that is by aconstitutional remedy. Catarrhaldeafness is caused by an inflamedcondition of the mucous lining of theEustachian Tube. When this tube isinflamed you have a rumbling soundor imperfect hearing, and when it isentirely closed, deafness is the result.Unless the inflammation can be reduced, and this restored to its normalcondition, hearing will be destroyedforever. Many cases of deafness arecaused by catharrh, which is an inflamjmed condition of the mucous surfaces. Hall's Catarrh Medicine actsthrough the blood on the mucous surfaces of the system.We will give One Hundred Dollarsfor any case of Catarrhal Deafnessthat cannot be cured by Hall's Catarrh Medicine.
