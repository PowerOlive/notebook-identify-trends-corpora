A GENTLE TIP TO
TOBACCO GROWERS.
It is claimed by many experienced
tobacco growers that loose leaf to
bacco warehouses will do more tD
control the acreage of tobacco than
any other method of agreement. The
reason is plain. Tobacco is suppos
ed to sell for its actual value on the
loose leaf floor. Good tobacco brings
good prices, and the weed that is
poor in quality is almost certain to
bring the grower a poor price. As
soon as the growers realize that they
can no longer depend on the extra
fine crop of their neighbors to boost
the price of their poor crop, they too,
will pay more attention t oqualityand
less attention to quantity, with the re
sult that an average crop will be
grown, the buyer will be satisfied and
the grower will receive a higher price
than he has ever before received.
A RARE OPPORTUNITY.
Says This Old-Time Eczema Memedy
Is Applied Like Cold Cream.
Any irritation or breaking out on
the face, arms, legs or body when ac
companied by itching, or when the
skin is dry and feverish, can be read
ily overcome by applying a little
bold-sulphur cream, says a noted der
matologist. He. states that bold-sulphur instant
ly allays the angry itching and irrita
tion and soothes and heals the Ecze
ma right up, leaving the skin clear
and smooth. Bold-sulphur has occu
pied a secure position for many years
in the treatment of 'cutaneous diso
ders because of its parasite-destroying
property. Nothing has ever been
found to take its place in treating the
irritable and inflammatory skin affec
tions. While not always establishing
a permanent cure it never fails to
subdue the itching irritation and drive
the Eczema away and it is often years
later before any eruption again ap
pears on the skin.
Those troubled should obtain at any
pharmacy an ounce of bold-sulphur
cream which is applied to the affected
parts in the same manner as an ordi
nary cold cream.
If you are looking for a home don't
overlook the Yerkes property. One
of the best built and centrally located
homes in Paris. The building lots on
11th street are the most desirable
ever offered in years in Paris. You
are invited to call and inspect the
property on Saturday.
