GREGORY
Mrs. Mary Louise Gregory, aged
seventy-six, died recently at the
home of her daughter, Mrs. Arthur
Talbott, in Cynthiana. She had been
in failing health for some time.
Mrs. Gregory was born in Bourbon
county in 1845, and was a daughter
of the late James and Margaret
Steele Pollock, of near Ruddles
Mills. In 1865 she was married to
Mr. Gregory, who died about four
years ago. Most of their life was
spent on their farm in Bourbon
county but some years ago they mov
ed to Harrison county, where they
were numbered among the best cit
izen and held in the highest regard.
Mrs. Gregory is survived by three
daughters, Mrs. Claude Fisher, of
"Rmirhnn countv: Mrs. Arthur Tal
bott, of Cynthiana; Miss Anna Greg
ory of Pineville, arid two brothers.
The funeral was held at the fam
ily home in Cynthiana, with ser
vices conducted by Revs. J. R. Jones
and Clyde Darsie. The inter
ment followed on the family lot in
Battle Grove Cemetery.
Keep a little coin for the Alamo
and Grand box-office. Sihrley Ma
son is due, Tuesday afternoon and
night in a Fox photoplay entitled
"Queenie" an exceedingly inter
esting story, as any one who has
read Wilbur Finley Fauley's book
will agree.
Miss Mason is always a bright and
entertaining actress. With her five
feet (in height, of course), she has
more vivacity than any other screen
artist we recall.
In "Queeney" she portrays the
character of a girl raised as the "all
around" maid and drudge of a young
ladies' seminary. Advance reports
credit the picture with plenty of
snap and go.
