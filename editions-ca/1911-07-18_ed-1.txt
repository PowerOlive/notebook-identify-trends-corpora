Corn- showed nosigns of weakening until Friday, whenthe blades began to curl and droop.The early corn i3 now in the tassel andrain must come soon for the makingof the ears of corn. Late planted cornis very backward and 13 in need ofboth rain and proper cultivation.Threshing is practically over and theyield of wheat has been no better thanthe ten year average. The crop is being produced annually at a loss andfarmers would do well to cut it outaltogether and grow rye and barley.The hay crop is the poorest everproduced in the county, being butlittle short of a complete failure.Oats fared likewise and the farmerswill have but a small amount ofroughage for winter.Already a number of Bourbon farmers have purchased silos which theywill shortly erect ancl fill with corn forwinter islage. It is believed thatwithin a few years every progresisvefarmer in the county will have one ormore silos and that they will be prepared to meet, in both summer andwinter, with a large quantity of silagethe conditions that come as a result ofptotracted droughts or the rigors of anextremely cold winter.The tobacco crop is variable in condition, seme lields showing extrargowtn, while others are bad and indifferent. Grass and stcck water in manyplaces are gettirg scarce and the season of 1911 so, far hasbeen one ofgreat uncertainty and in many instances of great loss to the farmer, asevidenced by the practical failure ofthe oats, meadows and potato crcpsand the consequent shortage in grazing, forcing early sales of live stock.KentuckyDoleful Report forWeed.A dispatch from Washington says:"A doleful report of this year's tobacco crop ivas made today by the Department of Agriculture. The reportshows 893,200 acres of planted tobaccoin the United States this year, whichis only 72.4 per cent, of the 1910 acreage. The condition of the tobaccocrop on July 1 is estimated at 72.0' asagainst 85.3 orv July 1, 1910, and aten-year average of 86. v"Probably the most interesting partof the report is the prediction that theyield per acre, based on present conditions, will be 698.1 pounds as against797.8 in 1910, and an average of 526pounds for the period from 1908 to1910 These figures are lor the country at large."The Kentucky corn crop, on theother hand, is given a great ssnd-offby the report. It is given 2s 9Q percent, on July 1 as compaired with88.85 on July 1 1910, and a ten-yearaverage nf 88. Kentucky wheat israted at 88 a againsat 88 on July 1,1910 and a ten-year average of 81."A Dead One."I thought you wanted stories ofreal life!" sneered the disappointedauthor.

F.Hurt, of Lexington and the figurestotal $57,008.91.The examination also reveals howMyall succeeded in getting awav .withsuch a large amount and wrecking theinstitution.According (o the examiners Myallsecured the money by drawing "fake"rhecks, making changes on an intermediate book, but never posting onthe ledger, and the result was, alldepositors' accounts were correct, except whpre there happened to be aclerical eiror.The books were only examined backto 1897, and all the time he was taUingmoney by the "fake" check route.He never took it in large amounts, outseldom missed a day. During thementh of January last there were 25banking days, and on 24 of them hetook money. From the 24th of February, 1908, to the time of his suicidehe took $29,000, or more than $9,000 ayear.The deposits when the Citizens'Bank assigned to the Bourbon amounted to $155,000. Of this amount$150,000 has been paid by the depositors, and the others have been notifiedthat they can get their money at anytime that they apply. This settlement of, the bank's affairs was certainly done in record breaking time byMr. Fisher and President BucnerWoodford.The stockhclders will be the onlyones to lose by the shortage.The funds cf the Paris CpmeteryCo., which was a large depositor, harebeen found intact and not a dollar willbe lost fiom that fund.The Gaith Fund held about twentyshaies of tre stock, and it will losemost of that, it is slated.Date Changed.The date fev the pale of the BankingHouse and Fixtures of the Citizens'Bank has been changed from July 20,to Thursday.
