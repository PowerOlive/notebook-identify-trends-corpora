and Friday byDRAINING THE EYESIGHTIts Acuteness Gan Be Greatly Improved hy SystematicAttentionIt is the opinion of Brudcnell Carter the eminent English surgeon thaithe average acuteness of human eyesight can be very greatly improved bysystematic training In a paper reaibefore the London Society of Arts onFebruary 23 he urged parents andteachers not to regard sight as a power or faculty -which may be trusted tctke care of itself but to train it systematically by the aid of appropriateobjects and to test its quality fromtime to time as is now done in the caseof Tailway employes In commentingon ihis address the Hospital saysTravelers have told marvelous stories about the sight of many savagetribes and although some of these stories may be received with incredulitywhile others are explicable by thegreater clearness of the atmospherein the countries which they occurredyet there seems no sufficient ground f ordoubting that the visual function likeevery other is capable of being improved by judicious exercise and especially by such exercise as is affordedby the necessitj of reliance upon itsfaintest indications There is noreasonable doubt that the Siberian Tartar -who when looking at Jupiter toldArago that he had seen the big starswallow a little one and spit it outagain had really seen with his unaided eyes an occulation of the thirdsatellite Sir II Truman Wood in discussing at the Society of Arts spokeof an Englishman who could see someof the double stars but it must be remembered that the Englishman couldeasilj know what stars were double andcould perhaps fancy that he saw theirpeculiarity while the Tartar couldhave had no knowledge of the very existence of the satellite if he had notseen itMr Carter maintained that the habitof seeing a much as possible of earnest visual attention to the details ofthe environments would certainly havethe effect of increasing the activity ofthe visual functions and also in allprobability of promoting the growthof finer fibers in the retina by theaid of which smaller images could beappreciated He gave reasons for believing that the Aision of town bredchildren is less acute than that of thecountry bred the former seeing chiefly large objects such as houses and omnibuses under large visual anglesthe latter habitually attending tosmaller or more distant objects andmusing the eyes under smaller visualgles The general moral of thetall school teachershould 7De instructed to test the visionof new pupils and to record the factin a register at the same time calling attention of parents to cases ofmanifest defect and thus enablingthem to obtain timely advice or toregulate the course of education withreference to special requirements ofeach childIt was further suggested that visionshould be trained in schools by the useof difficult test objects set at properdistances it being only work uponnear objects that is ever injurious to theeyes while work upbn distant objects must always be of the kind bywhich the faculty exercised is likelyalso to be improved It was maintained that sight might be permittedto take its place among the physicalqualities that are made the basis ofcompetition and that prizes migtht beawarded for excellence It seems certain that there are positions in lifein which the power to see acutelymight be quite as valuable as or evenmore valuable than the power to runswiftly and there seems no validreasonwhy the recognition which is givendaily to the latter should not be extended also to the former LiteraryDigestInenicM in FranceIt is always pleasant to read of theincomes of others and some may findconsolation in learning what the intellectual proletariat of France as theEclair puts it gains yearly According to the same newspaper there are inFrance from 12000 to lSOOO doctors ofwhom 2500 are found in Paris andibout 10000 in the provinces Of thisnumber only live or six make incomesof from 40000 to 00000 a year fromten to fifteen make from 20000 to 30J00 a year 100 make perhaps 10000 afear 300 make from 3000 to 5000 ayear 800 make from 1500 to 3000while 1200 earn lessthan 1500 a yeardoming to the lawyers of whom thereire 3000 in Paris alone we

sometimes swungabove us At last however we swungalongside and were met and saluted aswe stepped aboard by the mate MrArrow a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint He andthe squire were very thick and friendlybut I soon observed that things werenot the same between Mr Trelawneyand t he captainThe last was a sharp looking manwho seemed angry with everything onboard and was soon to tell us why forwe had hardly got down into the cabinwhen a sailor followed usCapt Smollett sir axing to speakwith you said heI am always at the captains orders Show him in said the squireThe

you determinedto go on this cruiseLike iron answered the squireVery good said the captain Thenan youve heard me very patiently saying things that I could not prove hearme a few words more They are putting the powder and the arms in thefore hold Now you have a good placeunder the cabin why not put themthere firstpoint Then you are bring-ing four of your own people with youand they tell me some

he named thelatitude and longitude exactlyI never told that cried the squireto a soulThe hands know it sir returnedthe captainLivesey that must have been you orHawkins cried the squireIt doesnt much

believe he was really right and thatnobody had told the situation of theislandWell gentlemen continued the captain I dont know who has this mapbut I make it a point it shall be keptsecret even from me

at all if he had ground enough forthat As for Mr Arrow I believe himthoroughly honest some of the menare the same all may be for what Iknow But I am responsible for theships safety and the life of

it is Ihave heard you I will do as you desirebut I think the worse of youThats as you please sir said thecaptain Youll find I do my dutyAnd with that he took his leaveTrelawney said the doctor contrary to all my notions I believe youhave managed to get two honest menon board with you that man and JohnSilverSilver if you like cried the squirebut as for that intolerable humbug Ideclare I think his conduct unmanlyunsailorly and downright un EnglishWell says the doctor we shalljceWhen he came on deck the men hadbegun already to take out the arms andpowder at their work whilethe captain and Mr Arrow stood bysuperintendingThe new arrangement was quite tomy liking The whole schooner hadbeen overhauled six berths had beenmade astern out of what had beer thenfterpart of the main hold and thisset of cabins was only joined to thegalley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side It had beenoriginally meant that the captain MrArrow Hunter Joyce the doctor andthe squire were to occupy these sixberths Now Redruth and I were to gettwo of them and Mr Arrow and thecaptain were to sleep on deck in thecompanion which had been enlargedon each side till you might almost havecalled it a roundhouse Very low -itwas still of course but there wasroom to swing two hammocks and eventhe mate seemed pleased withrangement Even be perhapshadfJUfVbeen doubtful as to the crew but thatis only guess for as you -shall hear wehad not long the benefit of his opinionWe were all hard at work chanr incrthe powder and the berths when thelast man or two and Long John alongwith them came off in a shore boatThe cook came up the side like amonkey for cleverness and as soon ashe saw what was doing So homates said he whats thisWere a changing the powderJack answers oneWhy by the powers cried LongJohn if we do well miss the morningtideMy orders said the captain shortly You may go below my manHands will want supperAy ay sir answered the cookand touching his forelock he disappeared at once in the direction of hisgalleyThats a good mau captain saidthe doctorVery likely sir replied CaptSmollett Easy with that maneasy he ran on to the fellows whowere shifting the powder and thensuddenly observing me examining theswivel we carried amidships a longbrass nine Here you ships boyhe cried out o that Off with you tothe cook and get some workAnd then as I was hurrying off Iheard him sa quite loudly to the doctorIll have no favorites on my shipI assure you I was quite of the squiresway of thinking and hated the captaindeeplyCHAPTER XTHE VOYAGEAll that night we were in a greatbustle getting things stowed in theirplace and boatfuls of the squiresfriends Mr Blandly and the like coming off to wish him a good voyage anda safe return We never had a nightat the Admiral Benbow when I hadhalf the work and I was dog tiredwhen a little before dawn the boatswain sounded his pipe and the crewbegan to man the capstan bars I mighthave been twice as weary yet I wouldnot have left the deck all was so newand interesting to me the brief commands the shrill notes of the whistlethe men bustling to their places in-the glimmer of the ships lanternsXow Barbecue tip us a stavecried one voiceThe old one cried anotherAy ay mates said Long Johnwho was standing by with his crutchi 6ff v j13k it tf - Sx wlC 1iAM if rlSo ho mates said he whats thisTinder his arm and at once broke outin the air and words I knew so wellFifteen men on the dead mans chestAnd then the whole crew bore chorusYo-ho-ho and a bottle of rumAnd at the third ho drove the barsbefore them with a willEven at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old Admiral Benbow in a second and I seemed to hearthe voice of the captain piping in thechorus But soon the anchor was shortup soon it was hanging dripping atthe bows soon the sails began to drawand the land and shipping to flit by oneither side and before I could lie downto snatch an hour of slumber the Hispaniola had begun her voyage to theIsle of TreasureI am not going to relate the V03age in detail It was fairly prosperousThe ship proved to be a good ship thecrew were capable seamen and thecaptain thoroughly understood hisbusiness But before we came thelength of Treasure Island two or threethings had happened which require tobe knownMr Arrow first of all turned outeven worse than the captain had fearedHe had no command among the menand people did what they pleased withhim But that was by no means theworst of it for after a day or two atsea he began to appear on deck withhazy eye red cheeks stuttering tongueand other marks of drunkenness Timeafter time he was ordered below in disgrace Sometimes he fell and cut himself sometimes he lay all day longin his little bunk at one side of thecompanion sometimes for a day ortwo he would be almost sober and attend to his work at least passabljIn the meantime we could nevermake out where he got the drink Thatwas the ships mystery Watch him aswe pleased we could do nothing to solveit and when we asked him to his facehe would only laugh if he were drunkand if he were sober deny solemnlythat he ever tasted an3 thing butwaterHe was not only uselessas an officerand a bad influence amongst the menbut it was plain that at this rate hemust soon kill himself outright sonobody was much surprised nor verysorry when one dark night with ahead sea he disappeared entirely andwas seen no moreOverboard said the captain Wello entlemen that saves the trouble ofputting him in ironsBut there we were without a matcand it was necessary of course toad-vance one of the men The boatswainJob Anderson was the likeliest mnaboard and though he kept his oldtitle he served in a way as mate MrTrelawney had followed the sea andhis knowledge made him very usefulfor he often took a watch himself ineasy weather And the cockswain Israel Hands was a careful wily old experienced seaman who could be trustedat a pinch with almost anythingHe was a great confidant of LongJohn Silver and so the mention of hisname leads me on to speak of our suipscook Barbecue as the men called himAboard ship he carried his crutch bya lanyard round his neck to have bothhands as free as possible It was something to see Mm wedge the foot of thecrutch against a bulkhead and proppedagainst it yielding to every movementof the ship get on with his cooking likesome one safe ashore Still morestrange was it to see him in the heaviesbof weather cross the deck He had aline or two rigged up to help hiim acrossthe widest spaces Long Johns earrings they were called and he wouldhand himself from oneplace to anothernow using the crutch now

EX FRIDAY MAY 20 1898How to Do It So as to Prevent tkKilling or Injuring- of Even aSingle Little BeeIt is a nice little trick to know justhow to hive swarms properly Thereusually is but one queen with theswarm and this one bee is by far themost important factor of the pwarmhence we must ever keep in mind theimportance of handling the bees to endanger her welfare the least It is almost impossible to hive a swarm ofbees without killing or injuring a fewbees and if one of those injured happento be the queen our swarm is worthless as a swarmIn whatever manner we handle theswarm we should do it in a manner toprevent the killing of a single bee ifpossible and to keep all the swarm together and allow no part of it to be leftoutside the hive except the few livingbees that are on the wing at the time ofhiving The queen is liable to be in anypart of the swarm and may be in asmall handful of bees in the vicinitythat may have become entirely separated from the principal cluster Tohive a swarm right is to hive all of themand if the queen is there at all she islikely in the hive with the beesWhen a swarm issues from the hiveor when they are issuing from the hivethey should not be molested in anymanner whatever but allowed to congregate at their leisure and select aplace to suit themselves to cluster onand no interference with them whatever until they all or nearly all settle It is not best to get in a hurry toget them in the hive but allow them afew minutes to get well settled andthen promptly hive them A box justlarge enough to accommodate theswarm filled with holes to give themplenty of air may be held directly overand on the top of the bees and with alittle leafy twig or a little smoke usedto start them in the swarming boxwhen ihey will readily respond and occupy the box They may then be carried to the hive which should be previously arranged for them and a portion of them brushed off at the entrance and as near in the entrance aspossible when those finding the entrance will give the call and the wholearmy move in that direction if dislodged from the swaiming box in thevicinity of the entranceSwarms should not be left any lengthof time after they have issued from thehive and clustered as the next thing inorder for them to do is to get up andleave JTarm Field and FiresideSHADING THE WINDOWSA Little Contrivance That Gives 3IucliComfort to the Hen Familyin
