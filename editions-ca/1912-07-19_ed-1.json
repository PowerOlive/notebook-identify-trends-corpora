GOOD CARE IN HOT WEATHER
Constant Attention Must Be Given
That Hens and Young Chickens
Have Plenty Fresh Water.
During the spring and summer
months constant care must be taken
to see that the hens and young chick
ens have plenty of water and shade,
says a writer in the Iowa Home&tead.
The hens cannot manufacture eggs
without a liberal supply of water, as
a large per cent, of eggs is composed
of water. The growing flock, too, will
not develop properly if half famished
from thirst. This may mean no win
ter eggs from the pullets.
If one would take the best care of
the flock he should give it fresh water
1n the morning and just after noon.
The water that stands in a fountain
very long becomes stale and un
healthy. Water should always be
pure and the vessels clean. It is wise
Fined for Shooting on Highway.
Marion McCov, colored, was fined

charge of discharging a pistol on the
public highway. McCov, it is said,
became involved in a difficult with an
unknown negro, who was talking to
his wife. The trouble occurred near
the corner of Main and Tenth streets
about eight' o'clock. McCoy and his
wife were taken into custody about
nine o'clock by Patrolman Fred Link.
Other cases disposed of in Police Court
were as follows:
John Davs, colored, drunkenness,

Wm. Wilson, colored, drunk, $10.00.

of the house or trees all the day.
This leads to the -important question
of shade. No fowls will do well in
warm weather without - sufficient
shade. I have made it a special point
to notice my hens in the. summer, and
I have discovered that along toward
the middle of the day they will seek
shelter from the sun's hot rays. They
will either retire to the shade of a
tree or the shelter of the poultry
house. They prefer to get away from
the house if they can find suitable
shade elsewhere. If no trees are
growing in the yard and there are no
bushes or shrubbery of any kind
where the flock may find shade it
will be well to construct an artificial
shade by setting posts into the
ground, one at each corner of a par
allelogram plot. Nail crosspieces to
these and place boards on them. Here
the hens may find retreat from the hot
sun.

with five Troy reversible tractors. It
is estimated the engine will cost inthe
neighborhood of $1,850, and the trailers
will cost approximately $350 each. The
