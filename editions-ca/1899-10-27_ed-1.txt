succeed Butwe were too strong and although they inflicted severe loss on us killing Bande Nereamongst ethers they were cut down allbut one who lejd them This man seeing allwas lost and determined not to be takenhimself galloped to the quay and strikingLis spurs home leaped his horse far into theriver and made for th vessel The streamwas running fast and strong but the goodbeast despite his burden struggled bravelyagainst the flood To relieve the horse thecavalier having torn oil his morion slippedfrom the saddle and with his hand on thepommel attempted manfully to swim beside the animal The weight of his cuirasshowever bore him down Twice his headsank below the water twice he rose againand battled with the Hood Those on theship made no effort to save him and we onshore could do nothing He had now fighting every inch of his way drifted astern ofthe vessel and some one flung a rope at himHis hand reached out to clasp it but missedend then the under current caught man andhorse and dragged them down He rose yetonce again his white despairing faceturned towards us and with a supreme effort of hate shook his clenched hand at meand Avas goneSo died Yepin DEntrangues the death ofb brave man unyielding and fighting to thelast The yellow Tiber hissed in white foamover the spot where he sank Perchancethe mad currenti dragged his body down tothe slime of the river bed picked it up againin their swirl tossed it in snort from one toanother and finally flung it to rot on somelonely bank where the gulls screamed aboveit and the foxes or the Maremma gnawedat the rusty armor and snapped andfcnnrlc oyer the white bones in the moonlightEveryone knows the history of the timesand it is not my intention to dilate onbut merely to set down without commentthose matters of state in which Fortune allowed me to play a part When Cesare buttendcred at Ostia the Borgia were brokenfor ever and Valentine is allowed after ashort confinement to escape to Spain wherehe died like a soldier Now that the gamewas in hands the allies began to quarrel amongst themselves the French king todrivel away his opportunities in gayety andthe Venetians to etep in in their Most Serene way and claii 1 a share of the spoiltthe Lion of St Mark Events moved quickly the genius of the Great aptain won victory after victory for Spain the deatlFrancis Piceolonuni paved the way fortheaccession of Rouvere to the papacy as JuliusII and the Holy L was formed bymeans of which the French were finallydriven from Italy Thus in a feu years thework of DAmboise was scattered to thewinds but long before that time 1 hadsheathed my sword and concerned myselfno more with warBut on the day that I surrendered myprisoner to DAmboise and Orsini the former already in t nought sat in St Peterschair and the latter at the very least imagined himself the Lord of the Romagna 1sent forward couriers with the news of mysuccess lo the cardinal and ere we reachedMalafede met with a return messenger fromDAmboise bearing a brief note of congratulation and adding that Colonna hadmade terms to evacuate the portions of thecity he held The mesenger informed methat the Bailly of Caen had already enteredRome by the Porta Pia and that findinghimself between two fires old Fabrizi Colonna had made a virtue of necessity and byyielding now reserved himself for another-day This enabled me to go back by aneasier route than we had come and as werode through the Ostian gate I could nothelp contrasting my present entry to theday when Jacopo and I had reined in ourweary steeds to let the Borgia pass and givehis following the road At the Ponte SAngelo I surrendered my prisoner to Orsiniin person and truls thought he would havebut a few hours more to live forGentil Yirginio had a long score to settle with theBorgia and a longer memory for a wrongThe blood too of Paolo whom Cesarestrangled at Sinigaglia and that of the Cardinal Orsini whom he brutally murdered inRome called aloud for vengeance Cesarehimself seemed to be aware of this forv hereas up to now he had remained in asullen silence he found tongue to imploreme in the most servile manner not to deliver him to Orsini and when I told him Ihad no option he tried to creep out of hislitter and lay his cap at the feet of hisenemy Orsini spoke nothing merely ordering him to be borne to S Angelo butas the Borgia shrank back into his litter hesaid with a grim smile that he trusted theduke would find his entertainment to kisliking How it happened that Cesare a roff with a whole skin I never knew bui tidid as I have mentioned above and it surpasses belief He turned cur at the last andthe low blood showed in him but he wasone of those men who knew how to be thoroughly bad Orsini took back his lancessaying he had need of them so that it waswith my cwn few men that I reached thePalazzo Corneto I must except Bande Nerefrom this number and I was truly sorry forhis death for his was an honest sword Thecardinal received me in the little chamberwhere wc had supped with Machiavelli Hehad thrown aside his clerical habit and wasin mail but wore his barettina on his headHe was more than kind congratulating meheartily on my success going so far as Cosay that by capturing Cesare I had given akingdom to France I then left him withfurther assurances of his good will towardsme and saw him no more for the dayTowardsthe small hours of the next morning I was aroused from a deep 6leep byruim rtto Luiu mat ueiuuic tue pageUcllwaiting to see me I gave orders for his instant admission and on coming in he informed me that his eminence desired my immediate attendance Telling Jacono to haveCastor saddled for I smelt work afoot 1flung myself into my clothes and hastenedto DAmboiseHe had evidently not slept all night andwn pacing the room in agitationDennis he burst out as I entereddo you know what they have done Theking holds a tourney at Arezzo instead ofmarching on at once What is worse he hasgranted an extension of the truce to Spainand Tremouille and the rest of them atto the junket s hey are making a May daywith those ducats you captured By Othey would dan e away a kingdomYour eminence has no doubt sent newsof the capture of CesareThat was only yesterday man hesnapped and De Briconnet is riding forhis life to the king But it is about this Ifor you he went on rapidly dieBriconnet may come to harm Here areother dispatches Take them and followhim overtake him if you can Whenyou startNowGood here are the papers And this isfor Tremouille Adieu and he held outhis hand Monsieur le CompteI started a little at the last words whichhe uttered in French but had not time toask for explanation or make inquiry I hurried to my apartments and found Castorready Bidding Jacopo to follow me toArezzo with my men as soon as possible 1gave Castor the rein and rode out of PomeAt Citta del Pit t e 1 got my first news of DeBriconnet At Cartona he was but twohours ahead of me and when on the afternoon of the second day I reined in the staggering Castor at the gates of the Villa Aecolti where the king was I saw in thecourtyard a dead horse his sides still bleeding from the spur marks and judged that DeBriconnet had barely beaten me by a headfor all his 12 hours start So once again Ihad entered the Villa Accolti And as Isprang to the ground loosed the girths overCastors heaving flanks and resigned thereins to a willing groom who led the poorbeast to rest all the past came back to mewith a vivid force and I looked around almost expecting to meet again the glances ofscorn and contempt to hear once more thehisses the mockery and the foul reproachof that dayThe cardinal was right enough when hesaid that high junkets were to be held Andthe day seemed to be one of merry makingFlags were flying from all parts of the villaand the wide grounds were full of the followers of the court and the townspeopleeither watching or engaged in sports ofwrestling archery and other gamesFor the great ones however the out-of-dooramusement of the day came to an endwith the dinner hour and they were nowdisporting themselves within From theopen windows strains of music floated outinto the sunlight and gay figures passed andrepassed or moved in and out of the balcony overhanging the grand entrance whichseemed from the constant movement andthe brilliant dresses of those who crowdedthereon to be like a bed of flowers stirringin the wind As I came below the balconyI did imt dare to look up but with my swordfu the loop of my arm and my dispatchesclenched in my right hand walked up themarble stepsPost from Rome Post from the LordCardinalThe sonorous voice of the ushers pealedthis out and I found myself at the entranceto the gallery leading to the great hall wherei had been triedNot here sir to the left My way wasbarred by an equerry in violet and goldNot so De Brieune the king receivesthese dispatches in person and Bayard hadlinked his arm in mineBut my lord1 take the blame and Bayard blazing infull mail led me through the gallery whose- were lined with the archers of theottish iuard Archers in name only nowand little as my time was 1 could not forr glancing at these fine troops who although few in number lore an unequaledreputation for service in the held Thedoors at the entrance to the hall which wereguarded by two gigantic men-at-arms wereopened only at fixed intervals to let peoplein and out and by this means an attemptwas made to avoid overcrowding Therewere a considerable number of us and having to go slowly we had time to exchange afew wordsI suppose De Briconnet has passed inI asked he could only have just arrivedfor his horse lies dead at the gatesI doubt it All posts are received by DeVesci whose wrath we are going to braveIf De Briconnet came in here direct he wasprobably stopped and sent to the seneschalsapartmentsIf so as he was the first comer he shouldpresent the dispatches I urged 1 bearbut duplicatesThere is no time to think of that nowreplied Bayard and as he spoke the doorsunfolded and in a crash of music and themurmur of voices above which now andagain trilled a peal of clear feminine laughter we entered the hall At first we wereunobserved for the interest of everyone wasgathered to the center of the room whereto the strains of music a game of chess wasbeing played with living figures The kinghimself took part in it and 1 had good opportunity of observing him Time had notchanged Louis much although his recklesslife had enfeebled his constitution He hadthe features of his house the wide foreheadthe oval face the pointed chin below whichhis short brown beard was neatly trimmedHis gray eyes were set somewhat wideapart and his hair which was naturallystraight he wore carefully curled in alength that all but touched his shouldersHe was dressed in a tight fitting surcoat ofgreen with green trunk hose and stockingsof the same color A short cloak also ofgreen fell from his shoulder and below hisleft knee was bound the ribbon of the English Order of the Garter of which he wasvery proud On his head was a velvet caplapelled in front and on either side and alivewith the light jewels with which it wasstudded lie was playing king in the gameJlme de la Tremouille acting as queen andthe rival king was Tremouille himself whohad for his partner Isabel the Good the wifeof Gonsaga of Mantua a princess distinguished a ike for her beauty and her virtueA little apart from the players and watching the game with a grave interest stoodEtienne de Vesci the seneschal of Beaucaire who was after the cardinal the mostpowerful man in France and indeed wassupposed by many to have more of the kingsear Close by him were a number of ladiesand I ran my eye amongst them and aroundthe hall hoping in vain to catch sight of theone face I longed to see Whilst so engagedDe Vesci observed me and 6eeing the papers in my hand made an imperious gesturebeckoning me towards him This I pretended not to observe and the seneschal bitinghis lips edged bis way towards me It waseasy to see from my traveled and stainedpearance the red on my spurs and thepacket in my hand that I was the bearer ofnewsvoice fct tMuuiu m xieiicpers for the king should be brought to nThese are for the kings halid I answeredIt is enough Give them to me and heheld forth his handI have said my lord that they are forhis majestys own handsBayard who was watching the game nowdrawing to a close turned round at thisand grasping the matter cut inCiel My lord let the cavaliere deliverhia packet It will come to you soonugh Take a holiday for onceDe Vesci frowned and was about to makea hot answer when there Avas a suddenj shout and a clapping of hands and Louiswho had won the game came forward leading Mme de la Tremouille in triumph Thelast move was made but a few feet from usand as the king faced round with his partner he caught sight of our group and calledout as he advancedictory We have won Why thoseblack looks De Vesci Corne and congratulate usW ith an effort the seneschal smoothed hisface Victory always attends jour majesty and with so fair a partner defeat wouldbe impossible and he bowed with a court lygrace but the wrinkles of hi9 frown werestill on his forehead The duchess grew redwith pleasure at the compliment and Louisclapped his hands like a boyExcellent Trust a courtiers lip for asoft Bpeech and then observing me butwhat have we hereFrom Borne your majesty and dropping to my knee I presented my paperswhich the king took irresolutely in his handDiable he exclaimed with an impatientgesture from my lord cardinal no doubtAnd he glanced at meVour majesty and of the most vital import and I roseI must read them I suppose A plagueon the cardinal We were just going to theminuetI will deal with the matter sire The papers should have come to me and De Vescisaying this in his harsh grating voicereached forth his hand Usually a perfectmaster of his temper he had somehow foronce let it get the better of him and hisclosing words and manner were almost thoseof command Louis though a brave manhad a weak nature and a hasty temper Atemper that was often aroused to fits of obstinacy little short of mulish He caughtthe seneschals tone and perhaps also thesuppressed smile that flickered on the facesof his courtiers His forehead darkenedYou mistake my lord these papers comerightly to me and turning his back on theseneschal he tore open the packetDe Vesci stepped back white to the lipsand the court gathered round the king in silence Seeing Tremouille at hand I madebold to step up to him and give him DAmboises note He glanced at it and turningto me said I gave my word and it shallbe kept The honor of Tremouille ispledgedI was at a loss to understand but he hadno time to think for Louis suddenly calledout Tremouille Bayard gentlemenThe Borgia is taken Rome is oursAt once there was a buzz and a murmurof voices in eager congratulation at theMM mmriffr SssJ lTake back your knighthoodglad tidings Standing alone and apartfroufcall I could barely see Louis so closely did the court press around him but itseemed that Tremouille was urging something on him and the duchess too for Icaught the flash of jewels on her lingersas in her eagerness she laid them on thekings arm Then Bayards deep voice cameto me clearly If done twere well donequickly sireI do not exactly know how it happenedbut I found myself kneeling before the kingwho stood above me his drawn sword inhis handM di Savelli he said one king cfFrance owed you his life another all butowes you a kingdom Wear again yourcross It was nobly won Take back yourknighthood He laid the blade gently onmy shoulder for God for your king foryour lady Arise sir knight Hestretched forth his hand to aid me to myfeet and I stood up again with my honorwhite in the very hall almost on the veryspot whence I had been cast out in ignominy and shameI could not speak I was choked my eyeswere wet with tears Seeing my emotionLouis placed his hand kindly on my shoulderRemember Di Savelli he said Franceneeds you yet To the minuet my lordsand ladies to the minuetAnd he turned down the hall not waiting for my thanks But friends sprang upeverywhere The first to give me her gcvlwishes was Duchess de la Tremouille thencame the duke old Ives dAlegre3 andothers I can scarcely name It was whilstin their midst that I saw a face I knewwell and Machiavelli came upLate but not the less warm in my congratulations he said so the good shipis safe in port at last We owe you toomuch for speech and can never thank youenoughVour excellency is most kind Is LadyAngiola wellHe was silent for a moment and laughedto himself as if something stirred himAs well as ever she was he answered atlength and added You must sup withus this evening We lodge in the Borgo diSan Vito and never mind your attire Mywife longs to see you and thank you inpersonOther friends coming up our converse wasbrought to an end and I managed to effectmy escape and take refuge in the pavilionof Bayard who insisted on my being hisguest I would have willingly foregone thesupper at the Borgo di San Vito as I wasweary but having promised borrowed

onentering I found myself alone I had towait some little time and wondering tthe strangeness of my reception I walkedtowards a window overlooking the privategardens of the house As I reached it Iheard the rustle of trailing garments andturning round beheld Angiola before meShe came up with outstretched hands ard1 took them in mine and looked into hereyes Then I found words they come toevery man at the right time and I spokeShe made no answer as I pleaded my causeand fearing the worst X dropped her handswith a bitter reproach against my age andmy scarred face When I had done she remained still with her eyes down and therewas a silence Then she looked up againDi Savelli and her voice was very lowyou say your face is scarred by wounds Doyou know cavaliere I would I were a manthat I too might bear wounds on my faceand looking in my mirror see how they became me And the rest concerns not anyoneWe were married before the end of thetruce and on my wedding day 1 receivedfrom his majesty the king the patents ofthe county of Fresnoy in Guienne a distinction that was extended to me in Italyby his holiness Pope Pius III who onmy purchasing a portion of my ancestralestates back from Amilcar

the wolf in our mountains yet still hunts the stag in the Ciminian forests of our kinsman Amilcar Chigito whom we have been reconciled and whomwe visit yearlyLast winter we spent in France at

and I believe that all cf1 are yet alive tad serving theirKjses in circuses and zees 1 haveseen a herd of 20 wild elephants driveninto an inclcsure and made captive al-t without trouble 1 have trappedfour and live lions and tigers in a weekwith never a man even scratched Asfor wolves and hyenas they can becaught as readily as fish Ifs wh youtackle a rhinoceros that you tackleIness lt worry and work and danger from the moment you set about it1 am talking about the one hornedblack rhinoceros of Africa When nature created him she gave him morestrength according to bulk than anyother animal on earth She gave himan abundance of muscle and but fewnerves He has a hide almost bulletproof a vision like a hawk a sense ofhearing as been as a fox and his courage is really sublime You may add toall this that the rhinoceros is alwaysmad The fiercest of other beasts havetheir good natured hours but this fellow always has a chip on his shoulderNothing is too big or too small for himto charge Hell turn on steam and gocrashing through the bushes after ajackal at one time and an hour laterwill charge into a herd of elephants orscatter a family of lions It is agreedby all men who have studied him thathe is totally without fear If he everruns away from anything it is throughmistake But for two defects in hisphysical makeup hed soon exterminateall other animals in Africa His range ofvision is like that of a whale deadahead and he is so bulky for his sizethat he cant turn except in a considerable circleI captured Barnums first rhinocerosand that animal cost him more than anyfour lions or tigers he ever owned Iwas the first animal hunter sent overto Africa bj an American and I had itall to learn I sent home lions giraffeselephants buffaloes and hyenas without any great trouble but it was awhole year before I got my first rhinoceros I had to make a study of theanimal and take advantage of his characteristics The natives had killed oneoccasionally but such a thing as capturing one alive had never been heardof It seemed to me that the easiestway was to noose him There are welldefined paths all through the forestsof Africa and these are used more orless by all animals especially wherethey lead to water I made a noose ina new two inch rope big enough totake in a rhinoceros and then climbedinto a tret above to manage it 1 spentthe best part of three lays up therebefore a victim came along Heseentedme and was suspicious but nevertheless came on and was neatly noosedI believe that rope would have held aschooner at anchor off Montauk Pointbut that rhinoceros made one phand broke it like a thread I hacntrealized Ids strength up to that timeMy next move was to seek a point on apath several miles from camp and erecta barricade This barricade ran to aV shaped point and was ma tie strongenough to hold an elephant I arhinoceros took thai path he would follow it to the last inch and when he wasin close quart rs we would be on handto tangle him up We had a visitoralmost b fore we were ready Whenthe rhinoceros got along to the barricade he halted lor a minute to sniff theair Then he lowered his head andwent charging down the pathI believed we had him for sure but liestruck the togs and rocks at the pointof the V wih the power of a wild locomotive and battered his way through1 now turned to a pit At a soft spoton a path leading to a water hole weCui2 a pit 20 feet long 10 feet wide and7 feet dee j This we covered withpoles branches anl dirt until no onecould detect he danger lurking beneath but we had our trouble for ourreward The rhinoceros does most ofhis roaming by day and is carelesswhether he follows a path or crashesthrough the bushes The night afterthe pit was ready we caught two hyenasin it The next day we caught a deerthe next night another hyena The oneanimal we wanted did not appear Wetried again at another point and thistime it was a success because I hadthe details more in hand When the pithad been prepared I went up the pathabout half a mile to an opening andhung a red shirt on a bush I knew thatif a rhineceros sighted that shirt hewould charge the bush I climbed atree and waited and in less than anhour I heard an old fellow coining fulltilt He went through the bush likean avalanche and on the path he founda red handkerchief He picked it upon his horn and charged down thepath On the fai side of the pit wasanother red shirt and in his anger thebeast didnt look for a trap He wasdusting along at 20 miles an hour whenthe earth gave way and he landed on hishead at the bottom of the pit We hada time getting him out and into a cageand I dont believe he ever got over being mad X Y Commercial Advertiserelectricity untl Skin ColoringIt has been noted that in the surgicaluses of electricity the color
