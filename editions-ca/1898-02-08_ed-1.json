A NIGHT SONG
Under tho white moon Nita
The lilies lie awake
JLnd red as blood in flower and bud
Aad all for your sweet sake
The eager rose oerleaps the close
And climbs the columned wall
To hide his face in tho drifts of lace
That over your lattice fall
The dead sweet scent of the woodbine
Somo languid breeze hath stirred
And out of tho dark dew haunted park
Floats tho pipe of a restless bird
And far and faint the gurgle and plaint
Of the wood brook sounds alone
As I listen and pine for some answering
sign
Some whisper of thine my ownl
I lie wiih the lilies Nita
Under thy lattice bars
And the infinite night brims over
With the glory of moon and stars
And the wooing woodbines passionate sptoe
Out of the darkness blows
And faints and dies with the mingled sighs
Of perfumed lily and rose
Yet rest thee my beloved since
No prayer of mine may win
The crystal walls of slumber
That shut thee softly In
But oh that the mystic angel
Wuo keepeth the pearly key
Of sleep would open some door of dreams
And lead thee sweet to me
EcMita Alice Brown in New York Ledger
BUFFALO BILLS START
Accident Made the Well
Knows
i Scout a Showman
An old Nebraskan was speaking of
Buffalo Bill recently and incidentally
lie told how he came to engage in the
ghow business
Cody was for years a government
scout on the western plains said the
Nebraska man and it was when he
conduoted the buffalo exterminating ex
pedition for the entertainment of the
Grand Duke Alexis in 18701 think it
Vas that he got his name Cody at
that time distinguished himself by the
number of buffaloes he killed and there
by earned his cognomen which was
given him by the duke While he was
well known as a scout he would prob
ably have never been widely known as
showman except for an accident
It was in 1881 that the people of
North Platte Neb near which town
was Codys ranch decided to celebrate
the Fourth of July and at the sugges
tion of John Kieth who is a wealthy
ranchman at Sutherland and North
Platte and formerly claim adjuster of
the Union Pacific they selected a wild
west show Cody was one of tho men
most prominently interested in the
scheme and to him was left the work
of securing the cowboys and Indians to
help outhe show In North Platte at
the time was an old stagecoach owned
by Jim Stephenson of Omaha who was
the proprietor of the Deadwood Sidney
and other western stage lines At the
suggestion of Cody the Indians were to
attack the coach and be repulsed by the
cowboys and soldiers
That Fourth was the hottest cele
bration ef American independenoeever
seen in Nebraska The Omaha papers
had men to cover it and it attracted a
crowd from all parts of the west The
programme which Cody and Kieth ar
ranged included riding wild horses
er amusements and business proceedings
of a western man
It was a few days after the enter
tainment if such it may be called that
Matt Kieth no relation of John but an
old time western man told Cody that it
was a big thine and ought to be repeat
ed every Fourth of July Cody at once
said that it was something new in
American entertainments and he be
lieved that by taking the aggregation
east he could make money The matter
was discussed in North Platte and
finally Cody said that he would ad
vance the money and start out He did
so and his success is well known
When he first started ke hatlbut a
small show but he has added to it He
got with him Major Burke Sherm Cam
field Bill McCune and last but by no
means least Nate Salisbury There was
a quartet that cannot be beat and with
Cody boomed the business Bill has
made and spent a dozen fortunes and is
today making money like a cranberry
merchant New York Press

During a visit to Massachusetts a
distinguished author was invited by a
friend to a meeting of an agricultural
society then holding its annual session

The invitation was accepted and au

something to say Finally the president
pointing toward the author said
Everybodys given us a talk to

NAPOLEONS LAST WORDS
The Dying Thoughts of the Man Whom
Europe Feared
On his deathbed Napoleon expressed
his conviction that England would end
like the proud republic of Venice
With perfect composure he gave his
last directions I desire that you will
take my heart put it in spirits of wine
and carry it to Parma to my dear Marie
Louise You will tell her that I never
ceased to love her and relate to her ev
ery particular respecting my death up
on this miserable and dreary rock You
will tell my mother and family that the
great Napoleon expired in the most de
plorable state deprived of everything
abandoned to himself and to his glory
and that he bequeathed with hie dying
breath to all the reigning families of
Europe the horror and opprobrium of
his death
The second codicil of his will con
tained the directien which was after
ward complied with It is my wish
that my ashes may repose on the banks
of the Saine in the midst of the Freneh
people whom I love bo weil
On the 5th of May 182 he who had
for years kept all Europe in a state of
feverish excitement terminated his
earthly career
After lying in state two days the
body was deposited in a coffin composed
first of tin lined with white satin
which having been soldered was inclos
ed in another of mahogany a third of
lead and the whole in a fourth of ma
hogany secured with iron screws After
the ceremony an enormous stone Was
lowered over the body resting on a
stone wall so as to eecape the coffin
On the 12th of May Louis Philippo
commanded that the ashes of Napoleon
be conveyed to France In his commu
nication he said Henceforth France
alone will possess all that remains of
Napoleon His tomb like his fame will
belong to none but his country
At 11 oclock Dec 15 the first can
non was heard announcing that the re
mains of the emperor had reached
French ground Amid the vast assem
blage the body was borne by 24 seamen
to its last resting place in the Hotel des
Invalides
So closed the eventful career of the
great Napoleon whose memory can on
ly perish with the records of the world

ATHLETE AND SCULPTOR
A Tale of James E Kellys Powers as Be
lated by a Friend
Although he is not large physically
several good stories are told about the
prowess c James E Kelly the sculp
tor whose bronze statues of Molly
Pitcher General Buford at Gettysburg
The Battle of Harlem Heights and
Sheridans Ride have brought him
fame A friend of his said of him
He has more courage to the square
inch than any man of his size I know
and on several occasions he has been
called upon to show it unexpectedly
One day an expressman six feet
high and strong in proportion invaded
shooting throwing and all the y
rope

sirea ro reier tne matter to tne main
office When the irate expressman en
tered it happened that a tall friend of
the artist was visiting the studio With
an oath the expressman said that he
had come for satisfaction
I intend to smash you to smither
-
eens he ejaculated shaking his fist
and advancing toward the sculptor
Do not wait a moment answered
Kelly
The big man sprang at the artist
and at this critical moment the tall
form of the kvfeterj foiend vanished

that the bellicose intruder hardly knew
how it happened He fell on the side

up and ran away The sculptor return

What have you done with that
Goliath he asked You knew I have
heart trouble and cannot stand scenes
and s I went out to keep calm
Oh there was no scene replied
the sculptor It was an act in three
kicks and a push His heart trouble

HOW TO FIND OUT
Fill a bottle or common glass with urine
and let it stand hours a st di
luent or settling indicates an unhealthy con
dition of the Kidneys When urine stains
linen it is evidence of kidney trouble Too
frequent desire to urinate or pain in the
back is also convincing proof lhat the kid
neys and bladder are out of order
WHAT TO DO
There is comfort in the knowledge so often
expressed that Dr Kilmers Swamp Root
the great kid ey remedy fulfills every wish
in relieving pain iu the back kidneys liver
bladder and every part of the urinary pas
sages It corrects inability to hold urine and
scalding pain in passing i or bad effects fol
lowing use of liquor wine or beer and over
comes that unpleasant necessity of being
compelled to get up many times during the
night to urinate The mild and the extraor
dinary effect of wamp Koot is soon realized
