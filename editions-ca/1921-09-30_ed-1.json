Much has been said about the pow
er of little things. Throw a bucket
of water on a man's head and it
won't hurt him. But let that water
drop on his forehead, drop by drop,
and he will go crazy. In olden times
men were tortured to death in this
manner.
Many drops of water, running
over rock or through a valley, have
dug out the gully near your home or
the deep channel of the grand can
yon in Colorado.
You can easily lift ten buckets of
water, one by one. But pour these
ten buckets of water into a barrel,
and then try to lift the barrel and
you may ruin your back for life.
There is a lesson in this, about
not burdening yourself with a peak
load of work. You can do only &-
much at a time without straining
yourself.
The sensible thing to do is to dis
tribute the load. You can carry the
whole load with ease by dividing it
up but you must keep plugging
away at it. Don't forget that.

PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH
The fall attendance campaign
is on at the, Presbyterian church.
It is hoped to break all records for
church attendance at both the morn
ing and the evening services of this
church. A new plan of enthusi
asm will be tried. Instead of an
organization of a few boosters, each
and every member of the church is
appointed a committee of one to
boost the attendance during the
month. Straight gospel sermons
will fill the, "menu" for the month.
Sunday morning the theme will be
"Hearts Afire." Sunday evening
the thought will be "The Cross of
Christ." The congregation is re
joicing over the return of Mrs. Macie
Fithian to the choir after an illness
of several- weeks. The quartette of
this church, Mrs. Macie Fithian,
Miss Flora Hill, Mr. Robert Harbe
son and Mr. Charlie Mitchell, rank
among the best in the State. It is
always a treat ta hear them. The
hour of the evening service is chang
ed, beginning Sunday night, from
7:30 to 7:15. The goal for the
Rally Day program at Sunday
School, Sunday morning, is 260.
Every member of the church should
make an effort to come to Sunday
School on Rally Day. The publis
is cordially invited to worship at
this church.
