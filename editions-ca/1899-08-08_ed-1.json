Scrofula to
Consumption
Any one predisposed to Scrofula can
never be healthy and vigorous This
taint in the blood naturally drifts into
Consumption Being such a deep seated
blood disease Swifts Specific is trie
only known cure for Scrofula because
it is the only remedy which can reach
the disease
Scrofula appeared on the head of my little
grandchild when only 18 months old Shortly
after breaking out it spread rapidly all over
her body The scabs on the sores would peel
off on the slightest touch and the odor that
would arise made the at
mosphere of the room
sickening and unbearable
The disease next attacked
the eyes and we feared she
would lose her sight Em
inent physicians from the
surrounding country were
consulted but could do
nothing to relieve the lit
tle innocent and gave it
as their opinion that the
case was hopeless and
possible to save the childs eyesight It was
then that we decided to try Swifts Specific
That medicine at once made a speedy and com
plete cure She is now a young lady and has
never had a sign of the disease to return
Mas Ruth Berkeley
Salina Kan
Scrofula is an obstinate blood disease
and is beyond the reach of the average
blood medicine Swifts Specific
SSSBlood
is the only remedy equal to such deep
seated diseases it goes down to the
very foundation and forces out every
taint It is purely vegetable aad is
the only blood remedy guaranteed to
contain no mercury potash or other
mineral substance whatever
