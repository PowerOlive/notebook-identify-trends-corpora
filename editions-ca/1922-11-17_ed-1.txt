No more 1922 crops will be received. Director of Warehouses Ralph M.Barker said that some growers hadbeen laboring unde.r the impression that they would have to bringtheir tobacco to one of the largerdelivery points in order to obtainthe "best grading, ond therefore,the, best price. That is a mistakenidea, Mr. Barker declared."One of the primary objects ofthe organization of the Burley Tobacco Growers' Co-operative Association," he said, "was to see thatevery tobacco grower gets the sameprice for the same quality of tobaccoand to end the injustice of the oldsystem of selling, by which so,mecrops sold at 30 cents a pound andtobacco of equal quality sold for fifteen cents a pound. It does notCAHAL BROS.BARBER SHOPmake any difference where thegrower delivers his tobacco, he willget the same grading service,whether he delivers his tobacco atone of the larger receiving points orat the smallest receiving point inthe district. The graders of theassociation at these smaller pointsare men of just as much abilityand of as high character as thegraders at the largest point in thedistrict.'"We hope that growers will deliver their tobacco to the nearestreceiving plant of the association,instead of hauling their tobaccolong distances with the mistakenidea of getting a better service.The men who will grade our tobacco this year will be the best wecan get, no matter to what pointthey may be assigned, and thegrower will get just as good service at the smallest as the largestpoint of delivery."UNCLE SAM WANTS TAX AC4 WHITE BARBERS 4TModern Equipment.Expert and Polite ServiceHOT AND COUD BATHSPlant This FallFruit and Shade TreesBlooming ShrubsSmall FruitsGrapt VinesEvergreensPerennialsIn fact, everything for Orchard,Lawn and Garden.

Thegeese were in charge of veteranleaders, who directed their flight.Parties of hunters going downMain street, en route to thecountry in pursuit of rabbits, gazed long and lovingly as the geesepassed over, wishing they could bagsome of the "noble birds." Thesouthern flight of wild fowl is always an indication of the approachof real winter weather.Observers declare that more migratory birds have gone Southwardand gone much earlier than formany years. Weather prophets saythat this is one of the surest signsof a severe winter.

Fire originating from anunknown source in a big pile oflogs and brush had grown to suchproportions as to seriously endanger property in the immediate vicinity. A call was sent in to the firedepartment, and by taking the apparatus a roundabout way, reachedthe scene. It was found that itwould be impossible to get the autopumper close enough to get a streamof water on the fire, so Chief McCracken decided to use other means.A cable was fastened to the logs,which were dragged into the creek.-A bucket brigade was formed andrBoone Baldwin, of the firm ofBaldwin Bros., has gone to Graham,Virginia, on a business mission,and for a visit to his brother, Robt.Baldwin.Mrs. Carlie Wilmoth anddaughters have returned to theirhome in Paris, after a visit to herparents, Mr. and Mrs. JamesShropshire.Misses Lillie Williams, ofParis, and guest, Miss Clay Williams, of Kansas City, Mo., were recent dinner guests of Mr. and Mrs.Taylor Mathers, in Carlisle.Mrs. James Thompson, of Paris,will be one of the guests at theluncheon to be given by Mrs. J.Campbell Cantrill, at the PhoenixHotel, in Lexington, to-day.J.

Scott, of Louisville, to bequeath their historichome, "Liberty Hall," at Frankfort,to the Colonial Dames, on the deathsof the owners."Liberty Hall" is one of the oldest homes in the State. It wasbuilt in 1796 by John Brown, the'first Senator from Kentucky. Plansfor the house were drawn by Thos.Jefferson, in whose office Mr. Brownstudied law. The grounds and gardens of the old home extend downto the Kentucky river.The old Quincy home in Massachusetts, was presented to the NewEngland chapter of the ColonialDames several years ago, and "Liberty Hall" will be one of many historical houses which have been donated to the society.SCORING WITH FOOTBALL FUN.Football is an autumnal sport engaged in by elevens of players andthousands of spectators. Of course,women don'tbe known as the, Kentucky HomeService Fund. The ExecutiveCommittee will be made up of citizens of this county, with an appealsent through the mails to the citizens under their names. Heretofore the Army, through its kindfriends, solicited the funds for theArmy. The new procedure willeliminate all of the former campaignwork.The work of the Salvation Armyhas been endorsed by every lodge,all denominations, iex-FresidJentWoodrow Wilson, President Harding, and all prominent men andwomen of America, our gallant soldiers of the late war, in fact, byall. The army reaches a class ofpeople that others can not reach.Its open arms are extended in allparts of the ' world where it canhelp and does help. It cares formany unfortunate women and infants, the so-called "down and outers." Its work extends into thejails, penitentiaries and slums.There is no place that the BlueBonnet lassies will not go to helpthe fallen, sick and poor. They goand do that which is needed. Theydo not boast. They work day andnight.You never hear of the Armyboasting about their 7work duringthe world war. But your sons, relatives and friends who were at thefiring lines have told you what theSalvation Army did. Bullets,gases, etc.. did not stop them.They were with our gallant boysall the time. No one should forgetthe Army in its appeal. They musthave funds to help others.The ex-soldiers never forget theArmy. We may need them again.Many a wounded and sick soldiersent these words home to theirdear mothers: "Never pass by theSalvation Army without helpingthem." So let us open our pursesfor the forthcoming appeal, kindcitizens of Bourbon county.Ministers are asked to make anannouncement from their pulpitsfor this worthy cause over thecountry.Wonderful tact and ingenuityare displayed by those behind thebars bent on obtaining their liberty. Without ouside help a prisonerwill manafge to fashion a saw froman ordinary table knife or improvise a key from a spoon or piece ofwood. Even jails constructed ofstone, steel and reinforced concreteseem unable to withstand the assaults of cunning inmates suppliedwith crude implements.Not long ago a Kentucky Jailerfoiled a wholesale escape barely inthe nick of time. Two of the prisoners were allowed to have a fiddleand a banjo. For several nightsthe jailer thought he detected anunusual noise from the instrumentsand hilarity in the performance ofthe jigs and breakdowns. Upon investigation he found that the musicand shuffling of feet had drownedthe noise of the saws as they atethrough the steel bars. The jobwas about completed and in another night the prisoners wouldhave left to the tune of "ArkansasTraveler" or "Turkey in the Straw."Successful jail keeping nowadaysconsists largely of outwitting theinmates.PROTRAITS OF CONFEDERATELEADERS ON SALETHE PROPER COURSEInformation of Priceless Value ToEvery Paris CitizenHow to act in an emergency isknowledge of inestimable Vorth,and this is particularly true of theT)laV football btlt ulstJitat:a uu. ins uj.

Nowadays, football attracts almost as many fansas does baseball in its season.PROMPT ACTION NEEDEDParis citizens are again being annoyed with professional beggarsand traveling fakirs, and none ofthem are worthy of the help they,seek. Many of the cities of Kentucky have passed a law prohibiting these fellows from playing theirgame. Most of them carry printedcards which they present to peoplefor help. And in nine cases out often they are not worthy of help.Some of them are able-bodied, andoften more so than the people towhom they present their cards. Inalmost every instance these fellowsare professionals, and are workingan unsuspecting public for an easyliving. Paris has an ordinance prohibiting this kind of work, and itshould be strictly enforced.KENTUCKY ROCK ASPHALTUSED IN CHICAGOJUNE M, H2TOn the reemmendation of an engineer, the city council committeeon streets and alleys decided to layone block of Kentucky rock asphaltas an experiment.

E. Stephenson, soilsspecialist of the College of Agriculture. This is a heavy drain onthe fertility ol the State's farmsthat takes away plant food worthmore than twice the amount thatis returned in commercial fertilizers. Stalks that are producedalong with the leaf crop make goodfertilizer and if they are used carefully will help considerably towardchecking the annual drain on soilsthat grow tobacco, Mr. Stephensonsays. ,A total of 150,000,000 pounds oftobacco stalks, or 75,000 tons, areproduced along with a crop of 500,000,000 pounds of leaf. Figured atthq cost of commercial fertilizers,the value of the nitrogen, potashand phosphorus taken from thesoil by a ton of stalks alone isworth $19. At this rate, the 75,000 tons of stalks produced in theState this year contain fertilizerworth $1,350,000. This makes thevalue of the stalks greater than thecommercial fertilizer used on thetobacco crop. 'Tobacco is especially rich in nitrogen and potash and thereforemakes a good supplement for phosphate fertilizers. A ton of thestalks contains about as much nitrogen and potash as eight tons ofstable, manure. They shouldtherefore, be spread over as largean area as possible when beingused on the farm. The stalks alsoare excellent for top dressing younggrass or small grain in the spring.Both the nitrogen and the potash in tobacco is quite soluble andleaches away easily. When thestalks are left in piles exposed tothe weather there is. therefore, aconsiderable waste of fertilizer.The fact that they contain about$18 worth of plant food to the tonmakes it important that they betaken care of so that their valuewill not be destroyed during thewinter. Storing the stalks in ashed until spread on the field is thebest means of making sure thatnone of the fertility which theycontain will be wasted.A SIN TO LETHAIR FALL OUT3 Sc "Danderine" Saves YourHair Ends Dandruff!Delightful Tonici!SHurry!
