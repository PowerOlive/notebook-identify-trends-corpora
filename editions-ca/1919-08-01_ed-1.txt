TheParis Ice Manufacturing: Homnanv(has been able to furnish but a limited, supply, and is unable to get icejfroni the ice plants in surroundingtowns, where the famine is also beginning to be manifest. On manystreets in the city last Monday thewagons failed to make their appearance, and those who managed to Io-icate pne of them only secured a verysmall amount. Restaurants, softdrink and soda water stands, hotels,boarding houses, private homes, business houses, and in fact, almostevery line of human endeavor keenlyfeel the absence of the cooling article. In many families where there is(sickness it has been almost impossible to secure enough ice for coolingdrinking water. Appeals sent out togneighboring towns elicited the replythat they could barely furnishenough for their own patrons, andthat none could be spared for outsiders. While this condition has existed in Paris every summer for theor Carroll and many of them don'tcare a tinker, which one is nominated.ButThe Republicans are claiming thatthe apathy in the Democratic ranksover the primary to-morrow argueswell for Republican success in November. They are hugging a delusion. There is no party apathy, it isonly apathy in the matter of choosing a candidate.

Petitions wereprepared by County Judge GeorgeBatterton, and placed in the handsof solicitors, prominent among whomwas Mr. John Merringer for circulation among the business men and theresidents of Paris and the county.Within an hour after the paper hadbeen circulated on Main street aloneover $5,000. had been subscribed, instock, and it is now apparent thatthe promotors will have no difficulty,whatever in securing the necessarycapital for erecting and operating aplant that will cost in the neighborhood of $50,000, or possibly more.The shares have been placed oil themarket at $100 each, and each dayfinds more takers.It is the plan of the promotors tohave the stock distributed widelythroughout the county,! so -that thestock may be held in small blocks byfarmers, business men, mechanics, laboring men, and all others who havea small amount of capital- they canreadily invest., for sure returns.From present indications -the-plan isa sure winner, and one that will bewelcomed in Paris.

Stanley receired 107,585 votes; for LieutenantGovernor, James D. Black received69,616. The official rote cast at thegeneral election held ffovember 2,1915, A. 0. Stanley received 219,991, and James D.

However, in Knox county,the home of James 'D. Black, Staakyreceived 758 votes and James D.Black received 1,599.

He wrote prolifically, fand his novels had considerablevogue for i little day, but the product of his fancy did not wear well.'"The best of nis stories, and theone that will come most readily tothe minds of the reading public atmention of his name, is 'The Trail ofthe Lonesome Pine.' And this facteffers some food for curious speculation." The title of the novel was afterward pre-empted by a song writer,probably with the novelist's consent,and the melody became at once popular. It is still a favorite with theplain people, and though the composer's iame may be known to fewerthousands than that of John Fox, Jr.,his tuneful numbers certainly reached a wider audience than Fox's novelever did. ""It might be found, too, that 'TheTrail of the Lonesome Pine,' as aasong earned ipor? money for publisht-,' '- - ' -er and melodist than it did as a storyfor publisher and novelist. We mightadd, too, that the song sales surpassed the revenue' fromVthe play whichwas subsequently adapted from thenovel. - .-"As to that, we can't be sure, butthere is no question whatever that tomost people 'The Trail of the Lonesome Pine' means a song and not abook or a playIf John Fox had written nothingbut "The Trail of The LonesomePine," the above criticism might bewarrantable, but he 'wrote a wholeshelf of books that will survive theirauthor, not because they are greatbooks, but because they are readablestories, good pictures of mountainlife and in some cases very good humorous writing.The Record's writer is perhaps notfamiliar with the Fox short storieswhich were famous before he wrote"The Trail of The Lonesome Pine,"and which, like James Lane Allen'svery different stories, seem to haveembodied more of the spirit of thewriter than was found in his longstories with their melodramatic popular, and perhaps, passing, appeal.The American Legion.The very name of the AmericanLegion, the organization that is being formed by discharged soldiers ofthe World War, is a happy choice,and' the plan of organization, inwhich there shall be neither considerations of party nor official rank,but all the members shall be on thesame level in every respect, is a necessary outcome of the great contestin which the men were engaged forthe defense of democracy. This organization is going to have a place inthe activities of the country and inthe affections of the people equal tothat held for so many years by thatother wonderful organization ofAmerican soldiers, the Grand Armyof the Republic.And it is believed that it is a dutythat every man who served in theWorld War owes himself and to thecountry to become a member of thisnew organization. It is certain thatit will have a powerful influence upon the nation as a whole to keep italways facing forward as the champion of right and justice. In theyears' that are to come there are sureto come up many problems for theright solution of which the influence of this great body of menf whoknow something of the fundamentalduties of national existence will beabsolutely necessary. The AmericanLegion is bound to be a force standing for all that is virile and -forcefulin the nation's life. It would be neglecting his opportunity for a manwho is entitled to be a member toavoid his duties -within the ranks ofthe organization.An Auto Romance.Charming Gladys had a mirrorAnd she 'thought 'twas very niceTo use it several times a dyJust to "powder" once or twice.Now, her sweetheart had an autoWhich sometimes wouldn't goSo their romance nearly came tonaught'Cause its battery "stalled" them so.Gladys sometimes read the papers,Knew something too was up-to-dateAnd a big "spark" was her hobbySo she wouldn't trust to fate.But told her lover she was willingA magneto should be tried;Since then the "go" is thrillingFor the wedding-knot's been tied.BOURBON COUNTY CONVICTS FIGURE IN BAYS' NEWS.John R.

Perkins, Ghairniaii birtlje committee ; "Cleveland H'Dodge? Treasurerof the War Work Gountil, and H.W. WilmptjL 'Comptroller, slightlymore than?, 2- per cenfr of the totalfunds contributed- by the Americanpublic were expended for religiouspurposes -in the" United States andoverseas, -while approximately 80per cent was devoted to 'the purchase, transportation and . distribution of canteen supplies and to entertainments, education and athleticsports.In addition to providing free athletic supplies, which included, amongother things, in the ' United Statescamps alone 557,096 baseballs and20,000 sets of boxing gloves, the report says, the Y. M. C. A. distributedoverseas $36,832,449 worth of merchandise. Of this merchandise $1,794,771 worth, or approximately 5per cent, was given to the soldiersfree. This does not includeoverseas Christmas gifts and entertainments worth $651,963.Of the $97,817,005 expended, it isshown, more than $30,000,000 wasspent m the home camps, more than$43,000,000 with the American Expeditionary Force abroad and $14409,175 for work with the alliedarmies and prisoners of war.The balance was used for otherexpenses. The statement explainsthat the "Y" suffered a loss of $1,478,084 in the operation of armypost exchanges and canteens. Alsoon account of the depreciation invalues of French and English currency the conversion of the overseasfigures at market rates resulted ina book loss of $2,432,089.The report, the committee makesclear, is not final because the warservice of the Y. M. C. A., whichreached its maximum in March ofthis year, is being continued in theUnited States and foreign countries.Three war work campaigns forfunds, it points out, brought fromthe American public $123,254,052,and this amount, the report stated,was augmented to $125,282,859 bysums from other sources.Some idea of the magnitude of thework accompanied by the organization is shown by the statement thatmore than 97,000 concerts, vaudeville performances and other entertainments were given by the ."Y"in American cantonments to an aggregate audience of 43,500,000, at acost of $1,166,767. In addition,free motion picture shows in thehome camps necessitated an outlayof $2,328,271. yErection of 950 huts for men intraining camps on this side cost$7,698,984, and the outlay for maintenance was $3,965,736. "Thesebuildings," says the report, "werecenters of religious, educational, entertainment and athletic activitiesfor all men who passed through thecamps on their way overseas or whoused the centers through the periodcovered by the report and still areusing them."Overseas the statement says, workof even "a vaster scope" was accomplished. The 1,900 or more "Y" hutsand tents built or leased for the useof -the America expeditionary forcecost $4,801,271, were equipped at acost of $2,950,421, and maintainedat a further expense of $1,014,337.Writing materials ' and newspapers for the overseas men, including400,000,000 sheets of letter paper,halt as many envelopes and 16,000,000 postcards, cost $2,296,808. Formotion picture shows, in which 13,000,000 feet of films were used inFrance alone, and spectators aggregated 50,000,000, the "Y" paid $1,066,757. More than 34,000 concertsand entertainments increased the expenditures by $850,969.In accounting for the balance of$27,465,854 March 31, 1919, thestatement lists assets tf the WarWork Council on that date as $43,333,166. These included, it is said,$8,835,881 cash on hand and assetsoverseas amounting to $18,761,676.Canteen supplies on hand includedgoods worth $5,992,591.

C,"Auditorium Hotel,"July 28, 1919."Dear NEWS: "It is again myhappy privilege to attend the Southern Methodist Assembly in the heartof the picturesque Blue Ridge mountains. "Since my visit here last summerI find that there are many new"buildings under construction and development along all lines is progressing at a rate that promises to makethis religious assembly grounds themost beautiful and extensive in. theUnited States."This place has already become sopopular that the accommodationsare not sufficient for those desiringto attend. In view of this fact plansare now under way for buildinglarger hotels. When I first arrivedhere the Auditorium Hotel had meassigned to Lakeview Cottage untilsomeone vacated a room in the hotelbuilding. To my very great surprisethe cottage belonged to Dr. J. A.Baylor, Assistant Secretary of theBoard of Church Extension, Louisville, Ky. ' Dr. Baylor was on. theCentenary team of the KentuckyConference and spoke in Paris whenour Centenary Group meeting washeld there. Mr. ajid Mrs, Baylor andtwo daughters are spending the summer in their attractive home whichborders immediately ou the lake. Iremained there for two days and wasthen transferred to my present home,the Auditorium Hotel, which is incharge of Mrs. B. C. McClees. Mrs.Mo.r.lees is the "greatest mother ofJunaluska," and she certainly aresfor her large family well. She seesthat we are all comfortable and want Jfor nothing."The more you see of Junaluskathe more wonderful it becomes. Thereis always something new to attractyour interest and admiration. To-dayI looked at the surrounding mountains and saw the rain falling in torrents while the sun was brightlyshining on the lake."My main object here is to betterqualify myself for the work in whichI am engaged, but at the same timeI am enjoying a wonderful vacation.The training courses whicn i ampursuing are very difficult and require a vast amount of hard study.The faculty of the school is composedof some of the most prominent andbest educators in America and theycertainly know how to make youwork and study. The class periodsare from 9 a. m. till noon. The afternoons are devoted to recreation andculture and to preparing next "day'slessons."In order to complete the course Itis necessary to .attend. eight lectures.These lectures are given in the evening. Chautauqua "programs representing the best talent are also presented in the evening."This afternoon I took a boat ridewith a number of the fairer sex.This was followed by a swimmingparty. I manage to take a plunge inthe large lake most every day. Tomorrow I have an invitation to attend a reception at ttie Terrace Hotelgiven by Miss Minnie Kennedy, otNashville."Wednesday afternoon we are arranging for a mountain climb whichwill be a twelve mile trip. I suppose I will be the only one from theKentucky Conference, as I have beenunable so far to discover anyone fromthe Bluegrass State. I am fully convinced that Kentucky does not produce all the pretty girls. Seeing isbelieving. Virginia;, Mississippi,Florida, North and South Carolinahave some lovely representatives,here, who are lending grace to theoccasion by their charming personalities.

Brown, Jr., is a ContributorTo Judge Carroll's Campaign Expenses.State Campaign FalsehoodsExposedA Statement By Governor BlackiffIIISIIf1VwTO THE DEMOCRATS OF KENTUCKY:I believe I have been more extensively misrepresented in this campaign than any candidate in the history of Kentucky politics, with thepossible exception of Gov. Goebel, whom Judge Carroll in his speech atMayfield, June 21, admitted he refused to support A righteous cause,however,' will withstand many assaults, and I have relied to a great extent in this campaign upon the intelligence of the voters to distinguishbetween fact and falsehood, and to be influenced in their opinion only bythat which is true. My faith in the people has received ample justification in the fact that the rank and file of the Democratic voters are forme in this race. The machine politicians are doing all within their power to encompass my defeat Indeed, the race has resolved itself into acontest between the people who love clean government and the professional politicians, whose interests are selfish, and whose motives are sinister That the voters may not be taken advantage of in selecting a Democratic nominee for Governor, there are some flagrant falsehoods beingcirculated throughout the State, over the signature of M.M. Logan, JudgeCarroll's campaign manager, which I shall let the truth dispose of asfollows:STATEMENT NO. 1.In my speech at Hopkinsville, Ky., July 22, 1 said I had been informed that M. M. Logan wrote to T. 0. Turner. Judge Carroll's reputedcampaign manager in Trigg county, in substance as follows: "Rest easyor sit steady in the boat. If Carroll is elected, the appointees of Gov.Stanley will be taken care of."Tn a telegram received bv me from M. M. Logan, he alleges he neverwrote such a letter, and asks me to prove my statement or withdraw it.My proof is contained in the following affidavit by the Hon. J. FrankLadd, a prominent farmer of Trigg county, and the Hon. John T. King."County Attorney of Trigg county:State of KentuckyCounty of Christian SetThe affiants, J. Frank Ladd and John T. King, say that thev are citizens and residents of Trigg county, Kentucky; that about the middle ofJune. 1919, they saw a Tetter written by M. M. Logan to T. 0. TurnerCadiz, Ky., in which the said Logan stated to the said Turner, in substance: "Rest easy, or sit steady in the boat If Carroll is nominated theStanley apointees will hold their places."(Signed) J. FRANK LADD.(Signed) JOHN T. KING.Subscribed and sworn to before me by' J. Frank Ladd and John T.King, thii 22d day of July, 1919.CSignedj s. r. DAVIS,Notary Public, Christian County, Kentucky."Therefore, I refuse to withdraw the statement made bv me in myHopkinsville speech.STATEMENT NO. 2.In a recently published advertisement, headed: "Black's PoliticalRecord," and signed by M M. Logan, said Logan states I was a delegateto the Republican convention in Louisville in 1903, when my brother,John A. Black, was nominated for State Treasurer, and that I became afollower of the Republican ticket thereafter. I was never a delegate toa Republican convention in my life, and do not know of a man in Kentucky other than M. M. Logan, who, knowing my lifelong service to Democracy, would be willing to subscribe to such a perversion of the truth.The following affidavit, which is signed by W. H. McDonald, editor of theMasonic Home Journal; Dr. William Carson Black, ex-Representativefrom Knox county; J..R. Jones, ex-Sheriff of Knox county; John Parker,ex-County Clerk, and W. R. Lay, ex-County Attorney, refutes the statement that I was a delegate to the Republican State Convention in 1903,or a follower of the Republican ticket thereafter:"State of Kentucky,County of Knox SetThe affiants. W . H. McDonald. W. C. Black, J. R. Jones, John Parkerand W. R. Lav, state that they are Republicans in politics, and have beensuch all their lives; that they are residents of Barboursville, Knox County, Kentucky, except the affiant, W. H. McDonald, who now resides inLouisville, Kentucky, and that they are well acquainted with GovernorJames D. Black, who is making a campaign for the Democratic nomination for Governor. They state that they were delegates from Knox county, Kentucky, to the Republican State Convention held in Louisville,Kentucky, on July 17, 1903, at which convention Morris B. Belknap wasnominated for Governor, and John A. Black, of Barboursville. for Treas-'urer. Thev state that the said James D. Black was not a delegate fromKnox county to that convention, and did not attend said conventionThey say that said James D. Black has been a consistent Democrat inpolitics as long as affiants can remember.Jhey make this affidavit in the interest of the truth, and in view ofthe fact that certain persons are undertaking to disseminate a falsehoodagainst the said James D. Black by saying that he was a delegate to theaforesaid convention.(Signed) W. H. McDONALDW. C. BLACKK ' J T? .TONEST JOHN PARKERW. R. LAY.Subscribed and sworn to before me by W. H. McDonald, W. C. Black,J. R. Jones, John Parker and W. R. Lav, this. July 21, 1919.(Signed) V. C. McDONALD,i Notary Public, Knox County. Ky."STATEMENT NO. 3.,- In the same advertisement, "Black's Political Record," the said Loganstates I "made a loan of $2,500 to Caleb Powers, then under indictment."Hie truth is I never loaned Powers a cent while he was under indictment or at any other time. But some five or six years ago, and whilePowers was a member of Congress, I loaned Dr. Samuel Bennett, a cousinof Powers, $7,500. At the time I made said loan to Dr. Bennett, saidBennett was making extensive real estate purchases in SoutheasternKentucky. Some time after the loan to said Bennett, by some arrangement agreeable to himself and Powers, Powers agreed to, and did assumea portion of said $7,500 loan, amounting to $2500. But this was notwhile 'Powers was under indictment, as Logan says, but while Powers wasa member of Congress.In the appendix of the Congressional Record, page 140. a list of CalebPowers' indebtedness is given by Powers, which contains the followingitem in-Powers own language: 4To Judge J. D. Black (borrowed bv Dr.Bennett) $2,500:'Powers own statement shows that said $2,500 was borrowed by Dr.Bennett," as explained above by me, and M. M. Logan purposely refrainsftpm stating the truth, and in so doing, the Congressional Record convicts him of a deliberate attempt to fool the Democrats of Kentuckywhile pretending to give them the truth.

He admits being 115 years old, but his old neighbors say he skips years very frequently in his reckoning."Uncle Henry" Chappell, himself70 years old, and one of the foremostcitizens of that community, says Mr.Shell was an old man back as far ashe can remember, and that he has atax ticket showing payment of ta$esby the old man in 1809, which wouldmake the latter at least 130 or 131vears old. The old man says hismother had a record but it was lost.Mr. Shell's oldest chidren are nowabout 90 years old, and he has several great-great-grandchildren growing up. He has about nine childrenliving, and no effort has been madeto count the grandcnimren, greatgrandchildren and great-great-grandchildren.The total would probablycome close to two hundred.His eyesight is" as good to-day asever, and his greatest pleasure is tohave the "boys" come in for oldtime shooting matches, un which hegenerally bests present-day marksmen', most of th,em. nearly a 100 yearsyounger than he. ! . " .He came to the Kentucky mountains while the section was a realwilderness, following the huntingtrails blazed a short time previouslyby Daniel Boone, and was himself agreat hunter and marksman.He attributes his long and vigorous life toNhis outdoor living, hunting mostly, and to his never-failingtemperate habits. He never drank,ate, or used tobacco to excess at anytime in his life. In fact, such indulgences have, as matter of habit,been rare.It is claimed that forty years agothe old man's first set of teeth wereall gone, and a new set of gleaming,pearly white teeth grew out, but decayed within a few years sincewhich time a fairly good set havegrown out and are still on duty, hismouth looking reasonably full today. He is of rather light, wiry,tough build and when he has occasion to do so, gets on his horse andrides twenty miles into Hyden andback.DIZZINESS IS ANNOYINGAs ManyParis PeopleWell.Know TooWhen the kidneys are weak or disordered, they fall behind in filteringthe blood of poisons. As these poisons attack the nerves, the result isfelt in spells of vertigo, just asdrunkenness will make a man dizzyfrom the poisoning of alcohol. Dizziness, headache, backache and irregularity of the kidney secretions areall signs of weak or disordered kidneys and should not be neglected.Use Doan's Kidney Pills, the homeendorsed kidney remedy.

They accomplish thisnot by changing the color or cut,cut, but the way in which they applythe garments and by the way theycombine with their own clothing.Last week a party of AmericanRed Cross women, distributed garments to 600 mountaineers in thisdistrict. Then they left for anotherstation, but returned to openup a soup kitchen and feeding station. On their arrival at Petestithey were greeted by the beneficiaries of a week ago, clad in theirneAv American clothes."It was a wonderful transformation," said one of the Red Crossworkers. "The children wore thepinafores as waists and the white underwear as bloomers. The girls hadworked colored designs in the stocking and had evolved a -style all theirown out of the sweaters. Mountainflowers in their hair and about theirclothes completed the costumes inmany cases."The mountain districts have suffered intensely from the war. For fiveyears they have been able to obtainno clothing and very little food fromthe surrounding towns. The American distributions, now under way,are a big event in "the various townsand are celebrated in an appropriatemanner. The children strew flowersin the path of the arriving Americanworkers, and elaborate ceremoniesprecede the presentations of clothingby presenting very formally to theRed Cross workers, a basket containing two eggs, all that could be obtained in this district.. 1CATARRH CANNOT BE CURED- i oWith local applications, as theycannot reach the seat -of the, disease.Catarrh is a local disease, greatly influenced byconstitutional conditions,and in order to cure toNciire you musttake an internal remedy.

Last year 1,258 people in Tennesse lost their lives by accident.Railroad accidents were responsiblefor 273 of these fatalities; automobile accidents for 87 of them; the remaining 898 were due to a great variety of causes; but it is worth noting that most of them were in thecountry districts. It "is also worthnoting that while people find a greatmany ways of getting killed,--thereare certain accidents that appear ascauses of death year after year withdistressing regularity.Every year children are burned todeath by falling into unprotected fireplaces, or into tubs of hot water, orby being fastened up in houses whiletheir parents go away. Every yearmen are killed by having loadedwagons, or the improperly placedloads of wagons, overturn upon them.Every year men are caught in theharness and dragged to death byhorses or mules. Every year men arekilled by trusting "gentle" bulls or"'safe" stallions."Safety first" is a good motto. Letsis remember it a little better.o.

Other fires thathave been burning for weeks alsocontinue therein. It was expectedthe Rattlesnake fire that has burnedover 5,000 acres, would be entrenched before to-morrow.Aid of soldiers has been asked bythe Montana State Council of Defense. High winds have fanned theblazes to a strength that makes theircontrol by present forces problematical. WIRES ALLOWED.

Announcement has justbeen made of the results that came ofthe gigantic profit-sharing plan recently offered by the company to itspeople. The avidity with whichworkers, from label stickers to manaagers, seized the opportunity to become partners in the business, isnothing short of a sensation at thecompany's headquarters in Chicago.So great was the demand for sharesfrom employes that the company setaside sufficient stock to take care ofsuch employes as are in the army andnavy and who will be back withinthe next few months."We are pleased," declared F. S.Hayward, secretary of Hhe company,"at what we look on as a vote of confiednce on the part of our employes.Their respense to our offer has beenfairly amazing. I believe to-daythat our stock ledgers will show agreater proportion of employe shareholders than any other large manufacturing concern in the country."Stock which had been turned intothe treasury some time ago affordedthe company an opportunity which ithad long sought, the stock subscription books we're opened last May onthe following plan:Each employe earning up to $20 aweek was allowed to purchase oneshare of stock at its par value, $100.The market quotation is much abovethis. Employes earning $20 and upto $30 a week were entitled to twoshares; $30 and up to $40 a week,three shares; $40 and up to $50 aweek, four shares; $50 Nand over.five shares. No employe -was allowedto purchase more than five shares.The stock is to be paid for at the rateof $1 a share per week.Employes whose economics for theimmediate future were committed tothe purchase of Liberty Bonds weregiven the right to reserve stock bymaking a $10 deposit on each share;no further payment was required ofthem until they had completed purchase of Jtheir war bonds. The onlypledge asked of any one taking advantage of the proposition was thathe should look on his purchase as aninvestment and not a speculation."We hoped," said Mr. Haywood,"to put 10,000 new shareholders onour books. We had' already 5,000shareholding employes who had comeinto the company under our old system of selling stock at market valueunder a two-year payment plan. Butthe hurricane of applications thatblew into the office after the newplan was announced straightway convinced us that we had underratedthe interest of our employes in thebusiness. Now. six weeks after webegan accepting applications, wehave 17,000 new share holders. Andthe most satisfactory thing about thewhole affair is that we have associated with us as partners many of thevery persons we most wanted theplain workers."The unexpected demand for shareshas caused the company to create aspecial department to handle the applications., More than 2,500 of thenew shareholders are women. Subscriptions have been received fromemployes at all of the plants of thecompany and also from each of the400 towns and cities where the company has a branch house.TKEASTJUY TO ISSUE 4V2 LOANCERTIFICATESWASHINGTON, July 31. Loancertificates of five months' maturitybearing an interest at 4 per cent,will be issued by the Treasury onthe 1st and 15th of every month, beginning August 1, for the remainder of the calendar year, for the purpose of financing the government'srequirements.In making this announcement Sunday in a letter to the banking institutions of the country, SecretaryGlass said the minimum amount ofeach issue in August and Septemberwould, not , exceed $500,000,000,while subsequent issues would beabout that amount, with the totalestimated at $3,500,000,000. Thesame period will see the redemptionof $2,997,540,500 in loan and taxcertificates, leaving a net increase of$502,559,500 to be refunded by theissue" of short-term notes when market conditions are favorable.All national and State banks andtrust companies will be expected totake not less than 1.6 per cent oftheir gross resources in each semimonthly issue of loan certificatesduring August and September, withthe percentage falling to 0.8 toward.the end of the calendar year.Secretary Glass hopes to make thedistribution of the new certificatesas widespread as possible, believingthat their investment' value has beendemonstrated ' to a large class ofbuyers in previous issues.Reviewing the financial conditionof the country Secretary Glass estimated income for the fiscal yearending June 30, 1920, at $6,535,100,000 made up of internal revenue$4,940,000,000, custom $260,00,-,000, sale of public lands $3,000,000,Victory Liberty Loan installments$1,032,000,000."In the absence of. a budget system or of any Treasury control ofgovernmental expenditures," he added, "it is even more difficult to foretell the expenditures than the receipts of the government. The grosspublic debt should be on June 30,1920, when presumably the wholecost of the war will have been financed, say $26,516,506,160.": oQuite So.v Honesty is the best policy, and themext policy is a life insurance one.Xouisville Courier-Journal: .

Moulton inEverybody's."The farm is devoted entirely towheat, and if it produces somewherearound the country's average oftwenty-eight bushels perracre, whichis practically certain, it will add approximately -five million six hundredand fifty-six thousand bushels tothe 1919 wheat crop."All of the work is being donewith tractors. Last fall, when the,first ground was broken, there werefifty monster machines at work tearing up the prairie sod. This springothers have been at work. They plowon an average of one acre a minutefor the working time. A record wasmade one v day of eighteen hundredand eighty acres turned and broken.All the seeding,vharvesting, etc., willalso' be done by tractors, and then,of course, there are the threshingmachines. Hence the absolute no-ac-countnessof horses about the place."THRIFT STAMPS PERMANENTSale of thrift stamps, which, at 25cents apiece provided $956,023,121toward financing the war, will becontinued permanently by the Treasury, Secretary Glass has announced.He informed the National Educational Association, which recentlyrecommended that Government obligations be made available to small investors in peace times by continuingsale of stamps, 'that the penny-savingissues would be a regular part of theGovernment's financing hereafter.BRlGHTERT3jSeNothing adds to the pleasuresof a home, or makes life moreworth living, than a well illuminated house.useSlectricitiTor CitingIt's the only satisfactory way.9se Sasfor Beating and CookingIt's 'the only sensible plan.Let Us Fix You UpFor the Use of BothElectricity and Gas.Paris Gas & Electric Co..; (Incorwwated)-. ?.tJPtIjs LVw Ithe MccormickImproved Mowers&&?Mxml, 1 iff iiagggI6ga8ggBgip. tSave Time, Labor, Troubleand Moneyby using the Improved MoCormick Mower.
