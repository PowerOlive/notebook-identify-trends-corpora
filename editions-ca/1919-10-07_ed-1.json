Following- a long- illness, during
Tvhich she bore her suffering with a
. Tesignation born of faith and un
derstanding of the rewards that come
to those whohave fought the good
fight. Mrs. Edward F. Spears, aered
- eerenty-nine, widow of the late Capt.
Edward F. Spears, of Paris, died at
- -lier home on High street, in this
city, at 6:30 o'clock last night.
Mrs. Spears had been an invalid for
a long time, 'and her death, while
- not unexpected, came like a shock to
those who knew and loved her. Mrs.

. to the effects of a fall which she sus
tained some time ago, when her hip
was broken.
Mrs. Spears was a daughter of the
late Mr. John T. Woodford, of Mont

of the Paris Presbyterian church, to
which she was devoted. She is sur
vived, by two daughters, Misses Mary

brothers, John T. Woodford and Hen
Ty -Woodford, qf Montgomery county,
and Catesby Woodford, of this coun
ty, and one sister, Mrs. Wm. L. Yer
kes, now residing in Los Angeles,
California.

ably be lield Wednesday afternoon.
In the death of Mrs. Spears the
' - community loses a truly Christian

utes endeared her to all who knew
ier. To her family she was ever a
. counsellor, advisor and friend and
was staunch and true in all her re
Jations to life.
