TREATY UPSenator Vest Urged Mr Davis to Namea Dav When a Vote Could Be TakenSenator Dtvis Replied That the Qneitloiof Fixing Day for a Vote Hid NotBeen Considered By itae Foreign Relatione CommitteeWashington Jan 25 The senateresumed consideration of the peacetreaty in executive session TuesdayThe Berry resolution for the consideration of the treaty in open session wasvoted down and there was more orless talk of taking- a vote though onthis point no definite decision wasreachedThe session opened with a strong appeal by Senator Berry to open thedoors and allow the world to listen tothe debates on the subject He saidthat he desired an opportunity to re-pl-to some of the speeches which hadbeeu made on the treaty in open sesIsion but that so long as the t rcatywas considered executive businesshe did not feel so free as others seemedto be to discuss it openly Briefspeeches were made for and againstthe open door proposition but the motion was finally disposed of in the negative without a loll call and by a verylarge vote There was a demand for aroll call by the supporters of the motion but the- withdrew itProbably the most significant occurrence of the session was the banterupon the ques tion of a final vote uponthe treaty itself Senators Gormanand Vest both of whom oppose ratiflcation urged the importance of getrting a vote at no very distantday Senator Gorman in a briefbut very earnest speech said thatmuch had been said by the friends ofratification as to the necessity of disposing of the subject without any greatdelay He agreed with them on thatpoint and if they were in earnest hefelt that a vote might be reached withfci ten days Senator Vest joined inMr Gormans appeal and urged MrDavis to name a day and an hour whenthe vote could be taken We want itunderstood distinctly said lie thatwe are not holding the treaty up atull Name the day We will agree toany date that will suit you If youhave the votes you can ratify yourtreaty if not it will be defeated Thequestion will be disposed of and thesenate can proceed with other businessLet us vote now responded Senator Aldrich who had just entered thechamber after a visit to his home inRhode Island We ought to be readyto vote in 15 minutesSenator Davis replied however thatthe question of fixing a day for a votehad not been considered by the com-rnittee on foreura andthatwould not feel justified in assumingJuch a responsibility upon his own authority unsupported by the action ofhis committee He promised to bringthe matter to the attention of the committee at its next sessionThe principal speeches of the generaldebate were made for the treaty bySenators Teller and Frre and by Senator Hoar in opposition Senator F ryesremarks were a sharp criticism of theopposing senators and it was so pointed that it brought Senator Hoarto his feet for a somewhatacrimonious reply Mr Frye dweltat some length upon the conditions under which the treaty hadbeen formulated and also referred tothe situation in the Philippines intimating that the opposition to ratification was the principal source of encouragement to the Filipinos in theirpresent attitude toward the UnitedStates Mr Hoar defended the courseof the opposition Disagreeable as itwas he said to arouse the ill will olhis brother senators that conditionwas preferable to plunging the countryinto a position that might be of

Acknowledged Bv the WaiDepartment as Ominous The Delayed Action on the TreatyEmboldens FilipinosWashington Jan 25 It is acknowledged in administration circles thatAgoncillo the Filipino representativein Washington has practically submitted an ultimatum to the presidentto recognize him at once as the ambassador of the Filipino republic or takethe consequences The dispatches viaMadrid and London Tuesday morningannouncing that the time allowed theAmericans to recognize the Filipino republic expires Tuesday are acknowledged to have some foundation in so far as Agoncillo has demanded recognition by the president In fact at the war departmentthe situation is considered as dark asit has ever been and each days delayby the senate in acting on the treatymakes it worse Agoncillo and hisaugmented junta have lost no time ininforming Aguinaldo and his army ofthe situation in Washington only thatAgoncillo has declared the Americansare afraid to assert their possession ofthe islands for fear of the PhilippinearmyThe proposed postpenement cf theratification of the treaty has so emboldened Agoncillo that it would beno surprise to the officials here if hisdispatches to Manila did not inciteHtrouble there This phase of the situation was discussed by the cabinet butthe administration is powerless to actso long as three or four senators blocka vote on the treaty and make the nation appear before the world as afraidto do anything Within the last twoor three days Agoncillo and his fellowmembers of the junta it is claimedhave been in close consultation with anumber of opposition senators and havebeen concocting schemes and plans fordefeating or further delaying action onthe treatyThis conduct on the part of the Filipinos comes very near what the lawprescribes as treason because a stateof war still exists the treaty of peacenot having been ratified and there isa question whether if he continueshis tacties Agoncillo might not bedealt with under the law The president and his cabinet are still determined that the American forces shallnot be the aggiessors in the Philippines but if Aguinaldo considers thetime limit for the Americans to recognize the so called republic as havingexpired Tuesday the Filipinos maybring about the crisis themselvesThere is no fear whatever about our5000 soldiers in the Philippines beingable to handle Aguinaldos army beause if they once come into conflictour trained regulars with their breechloading and rapid fire guns wouldmake short work of the little MalaysThe president has no idea of doingany such thing The longer the treatyis held back the more defiant andarrogant are tne Filipinos goingto become Agoncillo backed by afew discredited senators who havefailed of re election is going to keepup his dispatches to the Filipino juntas in Paris London and Hong Kongand through them to Ag uinaldo Onthe other hand if the treaty is ratifiedat once Agoncillo will notify his bossesthat the jig is up and Aguinaldos armywill go to piecesThe advices from Manila whichhave reached the war department arefar from reassuring It is understoodthat Gen Otis reports an expectationon his part that the insurgents

Intelligentand Would B Efficient as Part ofthe Locil ConstabularyWashington Jan 26 AssistantSecretary of War Meiklejohn gave outWednesday a synopsis of Maj GenFrancis V Greens report concerninghe duties assigned to him in CubaSpeaking of an inspection which hemade of the Cuban troops Gen Greenefound them to be of all colors mulattoand white They were an able bodiedlot of men although smaller in staturethan the Americans They hadbeen inured to hardships during the last three years seemedwell disciplined and so fully controlledby their officers that although theirsufferings for lack of food were verygreat no cases of pillage had been reported Their equipment was wretchsd The officers impressed GenGreene most favorably For the mostpart they were intelligent educatedmen well mounted and well dressedGen Greene gives it as his opinion thatthis force possesses the elements of afine body of native troops provided theyare properly organized equipped andtheir regimental and possibly battalion commanders selected from American officers It is his opinion that theorganization of these troops should bebegun at the earliest possible momentotherwise there is danger that theforce may disintegrate and turn intobrigandsJen Greene believes that this officerand the men under him under properdiscipline would be very efficient as apart of a rural constabulary Theroaming life they have led for severalyears has disqualified them for thework of peaceful farmers It wouldbe possible to get from 10 GOO to 15000such men who would be suitable formilitary service About 5000 men suitable for military service could probably be obtained from the dischargedSpanish soldiersThe remaining half of the Cubanforces about ten to fifteen thousandwho are not especially adapted to thelife of a soldier and are peaceful laborers and farm hands seemed anxious toreturn to their homes Kut as theirhomes have been destroyed their families having perished in the reeoncencentration their fields grown up withweeds and as they have no money topurchase implements for farming purposes for the time being this is impracticable It is of the utmost urgency to provide workfor these men immediately In JenGreenes opinion money could be putimmediately into the hands of thestarving laboring class by employingthem in the construction and repair ofroads and the rebuilding of hospitalsasylums and public buildingsIn a few months by pursuing thiscourse they wouia be enabled toreturn to their homes and startlife over again Money thus disbursed would find its way throughthe ordinary channels of tradeThis would relieve business mon ywould accumulate in the banks fromwhence it could be loaned to suchplanters as could give reasonable security This would also enable themto restore the damages done to theirplantations and enable them also topurchase cattle and faming implements and to begin plantingThe prosecution of this work andthe prompt payment of wages will gainthe gratitude of the Cubans and at thesame time enforce respect for the authority and the govern ment of theUnited States Nothing would moresharply indicate the difference betweenthe Spanish and American methodsthan the prompt payment of wages ingood coin the faithful carrying out ofthe government obligations and theprompt suppression of anythingtending to disorder The food sent bythe Bratton was distributed alongthe north coast and that sent by theComal was distributed along the southcoast A small portion only was distributed to the insurgent troops thebulk going to the reconcentradoesThe latter are in such a debilitatedcondition that their stomachs can notassimilate hard bread and bacon andGen Greene recommends that if further supplies are sent they should consist of rice beans conee sugar andcanned meatsThe most important question affecting the future of Cuba is the care andeducation of the great number of orphans whose parents perished in thereconcentratit n The estimates of mortality during the three yean sinceWeylers reconcentration proclamation was issued vary from 400000 to 000000 persons or from0 to 40 per cent of the populationof the island The number of orphanscan not be even approximately estimated but there must be a great manythousands of them They are found inevery town and village in a semistarving condition and living on a precarious charityAn Even TradChicago Jan 20

opposite the ToisondOr The fate leading- into the littlecourt was shut and so was every window facing the street The signboardwas swinging sadly over the closed doorand at the first glance it looked as ifthe house was deserted 1 would trustas little to chance as possible 1 passedslowly on and found that the ToisondOr joined on t another but muchsmaller house which had its bound sotto it by the wall that crossed the streetThe sash of a window on the top storyOf the house was up and as 1 came upto it the front door swung open and aman stood on the steps and looked mefull in the face As my glance passedhim I saw that the door opened into aroom that was used apparently as ashop for all kinds of miscellaneous articles and the man himself would havestood well for the picture of a thievesfence which indeed he wasA good morning captain he saidWill you buy or have you come tosell he asked dropping his voiceAs he spoke Pantin came up and began to importune the man from a safedistance to purchase his wares but beyond a curse had no further attentionpaid him and with a disappointed airhe went slowly back toward the ToisondOr It flashed upon me that something had fallen my way I have conicto buy compere 1 answered and stepping into the shop began to examinea few cast off doublets and flung themaside demanding one on which the goldlace was good A woman joined theman at this time and whilst they wererummaging amongst their stores Ihastily ran over in my mind the planT had formed If I could get a lodginghere I would be in a position to watchwho came and went from the house andstrike my blow with deliberation andcertainty So at last when the doubletwas shown to me though the price wasexorbitant I paid it without demur andon the man asking if it should be sentto my lodging I pretended to hesitatefor a moment and then explaining thatas I had iust come to Paris and was inawwwJJlBjsearch of a lodging I would take thedoublet with meThe woman however here cut in andexplained that if it was a lodging Ineeded they could accommodate meAll the more if you buy as well a3ou do now captain said the manI will sell you as cheap as you wantbesides I answered but let me seethe roomsThere is but one room monsieuranswered the woman but it is largeand furnished and then she led me upthe stairway The room was certainlylarge be3Tond the ordinary but I wasdisappointed beyond measure at finding that it was at the back of the houseand would prevent me from watchingwho came in and out of the Toison dOrI objected to the situation saying thatI wanted a room overlooking the streetThere is none she answered shortly but if monsieur desires to look onthe street he may do so from the window at the end of this passageShe pointed to a narrow passage thavled from the door of the room to a smallhanging turret and from the archedwindows of this I saw that I could seuall I wanted without being seen myselfThe woman seemed to be of the samekidney as her husband and drove aclose bargain and after much pretendcd haggling I closed with her termsand arranged also for her to brincr memy meals explaining that for the nexweek or so I would stay indoors as rathealth was not goodI understand monsieur she saidshowing her teethThen it is settled and I will stepdown and bring up the doublet whichI left in the shop with these words Icounted out the rent and the money formy

you understandAnd I he answered have sold acabbage to Babette If you hear nothing more meet me at dusk in thesquare behind St MartinsThere was no time to say more forwe heard the fence coming back Pantin went off down the street and Iafter a word or two with the man andan order to his wife regarding mymeals went slowly up to my roomCHAPTER XVIIITHE BKYUGHT IN THE TOISON DOROnce back in mv room 1 flung off mvcloak and took a survey of mv newquarters The room was long and lowand situated in the topmost story of thehouse In one corner was a settle covered with a faded brocade whilst onthe other side there was a wardrobeand a few necessaries The bed wasplaced at the extreme end of the roomand close to the window which overlooked the back of the house andthrough which from where I stood theblue sky alone was visible there wasa table and a couple of chairs Between the table and the bed interveneda clear space about ten feet by sixcovered with a coarse carpeting If Iam thus precise in my description Iwould say I have done so in order toexplain clearly what followsSo far things were satisfactoryenough and beyond what I had a rightto expect in such a locality The onedrawback was that I would be compelled to use the turret at the end ofthe passage for my watch and thus runthe risk of beinc observed from theother houses In the meantime I determined to see exactly what could beeffected from the window and pushingthe table aside so as to get a betterview looked out I then saw that thehouse I was in as well as the ToisondOr was built against the remains ofthe old walls of Paris Below me therewas a sheer drop of 0 to GO feetright into the bed of the abandonedfosse which was covered by a thick un-dersrrowth and full of debris I thoughtat first of stopping any further concernwith the window but as I was turningaway I looked rather particularly atthe wall below me and saw that aledge ran along it about three feet below the window Following its trackwith my eyes I observed that it wascarried along the face of tho ToisondOr and in doing this I became awarethat there was a window open at thebuck of Babettes house and that thiswas situated on the same level as myroom but just about the middle instead of the extreme end as mine wasWhen I considered the position of thiwindow tind that its lookout was on aplace where never a soul seemed tocome I could not but think thatI madame were in the Toison dOrin all probability her room was thereand 1 swore bitterly to myself at thethought of how impossible it would beto reach her I then craned out andlooked upwards and saw that my housewas a half story lower than the ToisondOr and that whilst the latter had ahigh sloping roof the portion of thebuilding in which I was appeared to bea long and narrow terrace with alowmachicolated parapet running alongthe edge Thus if there were a dooror window in the Toison dOr thatopened on to my roof it would be possible to step out thereon and tbn Idrew back my blxd burning If it wasTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY FRIDAY JANUARY 27 18W9possible to step out from the ToisondOr on to the roof of the house I occupied it might be equally easy to getthence into the Toison dOr Takingmy sword I measured the distance ofthe ledge from the window sill andthen holding on to the mullions by onehand stretched out as far as I couldand found I could just touch the top ofthe parapet with the point of my bladeIn short the position was this that sohard and smooth was the outside of thewall it was impossible for anythingsave a lizard to get along it to the window behind which I supposed madamewas prisond yet it was feasible withthe aid of a rope thrown over the grinning head of the gargoyle a little aboveme or else over the low battlement ofthe parapet to reach the roof and theodds were in favor of there beiag somesort of a door or window that wouldgive ingress thence into the ToisondOr I began after this to be a littlemore satisfied with my quarters anddetermined to set about my explorations about the dinner hour whenmost people would be within and thechance of discovery reduced to a minimumAfter allowing a little time to elapseI descended to the shop and began carelessly running my eyes over the miscellaneous collection of articles therein The fence followed me about nowrecommending this thing and now thatAt last I saw what looked to be a ballof rope lying in a corner and coveredwith dustWhat is that I inquired touchingit with the point of my swordThe man stooped without a wordand picking it up dusted it carefullythen he unrolled a ladder of silken cordabout 12 or 15 feet in lengthThis captain he said -winging itbackward and forward belonged notso long ago to M de Bellievre thoughyou may not believe meI have no doubt you are speakingthe truth but it seems rather weakOn the contrary monsieur will youtest it and seeWe managed to do this by means oftwo hooks that were slung from a beamabove as in a manner to satisfy methat the ladder was sufficient to beardouble my weight and then as if content with this I flung it asideWill not monsieur take it askedthe man it is cheapIt is good enough I answered if Ihad a business on hand but at presentI am waitingIf monsieur has leisure I might beable to give him a hint that would beworth something in crownsI am lazy when in luck compereXo I will not take the ladderIt may come in useful though andwill occupy but a small space inRAISING MYSELF CAUTIOUSLYI PEEPED INsieurs rooms and seeing that 1 appeared to waver shall I take it up Iwill let it go for ten crownsFive crowns or nothing I saidfirmlyBut it is of the finest silkI do not want to buy You can takemy price or leave itVery well then monsieur thanksand I will take it up myselfYou need not trouble I am goingup and will take it with meWith these words I took the ladderfolded in long loops in my hands andwent back to the turret There 1 spenta good hour or so in reexamining it andsplicing one or two parts that seemeda trifle weak at the same time keepinga wary eye on who passed and repassedthe street without however discover-in-anything to attract attentionFinally the woman brought up my dinner and 1 managed to cat after a jion but made more play with theBeaugency which was mild and of agood vintage When the table wascleared I sat Mill for about half an houror so playing with my glass and thenrising saw that my door was securelyfastened in sueh a manner that no onecould effect an entrance except bybursting the lock This being done Iremoved my boots and unslung mysword keeping my pistols however inmy belt and after a good look round tosee that no one was observing me managed to loop the ladder round thegargoyle and then tested it once morewith a long pull The silk held wellenough but the stonework of the gargoyle gave and fell with a heavy crashinto the fosse below It was a narrowbusiness and it was well I had tried thestrength of the cord again I lookedout from the window cautiously im secif the noise had attracted any attention and found to my satisfaction thatit had not After allowing a little timeto elapse so as to be on the safe sideI attempted to throw the looped endI had made to the ladder so that itmight fall over the parapet betweentwo embrasures but discovered after half a dozen easrts that this was notfeasible from where I stood Then Ibethought me of my boyhoods training amongst the cliffs that overhungthe bay of Auriac and stepping outon to the ledge of the window managed with an effort to hold on to thestump of the gargoyle with one handand balancing myself earefulij for aslip meant instant death flung theloop once more and had thetion of seeing it fall as I desiredWithout any further hesitation I putmy foot on the rungs and in a minutemore was lying on my face behind theparapet and thanking God I had madethe effort for before me was a largeskylight half open from which I couldcommand a view of the interior of oneroom at least of the Toison dOr andby which it might be possible to effect an easy entrance Before goingany further however I glanced roundme to see how the land lay and was delighted to And that I could not be observed from the opposite side of thestreet as the portion of the house Iwas on was concealed from view by thegabled roof that rose about ten feetfrommeleavingmein a sort of longbalcony Xow that I think of it this roofmust have been an afterthought on thepart of the builders Then I was but toothankful to find it existed and had notime for reflections By turning myhead I could see too that the highwall that shut in the mouth of the passage was evidently raised as a barrierbetween the street and the fosse whichtook a bend and ran immediately below the wall After lying perfectlystill for a little I slowly pushed myselfforward until at last I was beneath thej skylight and then raising myself cautiously I peeped inTO BE CONTINUEDWHEN MEN FORGET GOLDThe Fear of Death and the Exaltationof Steps in Human

Senate With onlrsix dissenting votes the Nicaraguan canal billwas passed through the senate Saturday afternoon In fact it was allowed to be agreed towithout a division and only the decided opposition of Vest of Missouri made the call ofthe roll necessary The final triumph of themeasure was due most largely to the acceptance of many amendments whichrob the bill of most of its objectionable features In fact theacquiescence in the plan of Spooner to allowthe president to negotiate for perpetual rightof way had more to do with the carrying of thebill than any other single point in it The senate

FIGHTINGImpossible to Tell Infantry FromCavalry at Two Thousand YardUnless they have had experienceremarked an army officer people arevery likely to have a very imperfectidea as to distances in army and fieldoperations and as a result get thingsconsiderably mixed When they readthat armies are engaging with each other at 2000 yards between them theymay think that they can see each otherbut the reality is far differentAt that distance to the naked eyea man or a horse does not look anylarger than a speck It is impossible todistingnish at that distance between aman and a horse and at 800 yards less1200 yards especially where there isany dust it requires the best kind ofeyes to tell infantry from cavalry At900 yards the movements become clearer though it is not until they get within 750 yards of each other that theheads of the columns can be made outwith anything like certaintyInfantry can be seen in the sunlightmuch easier than the cavalry or artillery for the reason that less dust israised Besides that infantry can be distinguished by the glitter of their muskets At 2000 yards however everything is unsatisfactory even with theaid of field glasses for a marching column in dry

finding the bright side of J fictionIiTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY FRIDAY JANUARY 27- 1899everything Like the robin I used toread of when I was a little girl Therewas a lesson in one of our readers abouta raven who in the early spring wassitting on the branch of an old oak treefeeling very and cross Soon a little robin who was looking for a placeto build her nest came with a merrysong in the same treeYou seem very about nothing croaked the raven Dont you seethose black clouds above us It is going to snowWell I shall keep on singing untilit comes A merry song wont make itany colder chirped the robinYou are very silly croaked theraven and he sat still and made himself as uncomfortable as possible Soonthe clouds went away and the sun cameovt warm and bright but the raven satalone on the branch of the old oak andwas as sad as ever He saidTo be sure it is quite pleasant justnow but I know the sun will soon shinehot enough to burn one up Then tomorrow it will be colder than ever Itis always too warm or too coldJust then the little robin came backWeil my friend she said where isyour snowNever mind he answered It willsnow all the harder for this sunshineAnd snow or shine said the robin1 see you are determined to be miserable For my part I shall look on thebright side of everything and have asong for every day in the yearAnd the lesson ended with the question Which was the wiserit was a sort of fictional problemand as a child I was much impressedbut whether that impression was a lasting one or not I cannot sayThe moral is certainly very goodsaid Sadie Jessie I am afraid we aretoo ravens But life in this burg wouldmake a raven out of any robinKittie laughed softly1 am afraid you havent grasped themoral very well yet Sadie No matterhow black the cloud is it has its silverlining and you must keep on singinguntil you have found it We wont always be in this burg Why last evening I met May Spencer She is homeon a visit and while I stood talking toher 1 wondered how so wealthy and soelegant a man as her husband evercome to form such an attachment Sheis not at all clever and she is neitherpretty nor stylish and Kittie couldntresist snatching a little glance at thereflection of her own pretty face andstylish tailor gown that fit close toher perfect form in the mirror oppositeOf all our girls May was certainlythe most ordinary In fact she was inferior said JessieYes that is all true but if she hadnot gone east for that visit she wouldnever have met her banker arguedSadie One never meets a man likehim here and here we seem fated tostayYou cant tell what day there may bea convention of bankers or bonanzairon kings or Coal Oil Johnnies calledhere and we shall all meet cur fateGrandmother says never go to market for your husbands the best arebrought to your door laughed KittieOh 1 suppose some day there willbe a great commotion at our door andthe bell will ring long and loud announcing the arrival c f a strangerMother will go to the door and a youthhandsome as a god will inquire if sheis Mrs Atkins Mother will answerhim yes and he will ask if she has abeautiful daughter named Sadie againmother will answer yes and he willsay bring forth the maiden she ismy fate Then the three girls laughedmerrilyWell I cant say whether it will belike that or whether you will fall downthe front steps and sprain your ankleand be carried in by one of the delegatestothisconvention that I have promisedsaid Kittie But for myself I havenever thought of my millions comingwith a man I have always felt thatsome day or other grandfather wouldstrike oil I am like a woman grandmother tells of 1 feel certain that theday will come when the rustle of mysilks and the sparkling of my diamondswill startle peopleTell the story Kittie said JessieYour grandmothers stories are always goodWell grandmother had a neighborin Londonerry such a happy cheerfulwoman Her husband was a carriagemaker and they were in very independent circumstances They had onlytwo children Miles and KathleenMiles was attending the Dublin collegeaid Kathleen was at a convent in Pariswhen the hard times came in IrelandThe first to feel the depression were thecarriage makers and this family hudto seil their home and take asmaller place The children were takenfrom school and Mis a big handsomefellow joined the English army andwas sent with his regiment to IndiaThe family kept getting poorer andpoorer Kathleen was a lace makerand for a long time they lived on whather sales of lace brought in but as thepeople all became poorer there was nodemand for real lace and thus theironly means of support was cut off Butgrandmother says that sweet womannever forgot how to smile and whenthey were so poor they could be nopoorer she would say Never mindMrs Mailing we will be rich again andthe rustle of my silks and the flashingof my jewels will startle people andsure ei ough it came about She had abachelor brotherin India who after hermarriage never corresponded with herbecause she married against his wishesBut when Miles went to India and hisuncle heard his story he bought himou of the English service and a veryshort time after that he died leavingMiles sole heir to his fabulous wealthThe boy came home and bought a magnificent estate for his parents and hismothers prophecy came to pass Theywer the envy of the country aroundIt sounds like a fairy tale doesnt itbut it is one of those truths strange asIsnt it lovely said Sadie I believe it pays to be cheerfulIndeed it does said Kittie I havewatched people scold and fret and sulktheir lives away take every plan in factto make life worth the living except toleara as they drink lifes bitter tonicto smile across the cup If it neverbrings gold a bright face and a hopefuldisposition makes you and those aroundyou happier oftentimes than moneycould Like virtue cheerfulness is itsown reward As Kittie said this shiglanced at the little gold clock on themantel Girls it is 15 minutes to fourI must goOh dear I wish you could staylonger I have enjoyed this visit somuch Your life is a regular little sermon if you never preached Kittiesaid Jessie looking up into Kitties softbrown eyesI didnt mean to preach little onelaughed Kittie But there is no reason in the world why either of you girlsshould be blue Fall is not the time tobe melancholy Its the time to be realjolly Then Kittie said good by andwas gone leaving the girls brighter andbetter for her visitCome to think of it Jess said Sadiewe are two of the variest little ravensAll I wonder at is that we have beentolerated so long and Ill begin cultivating a cheerful disposition on thespotAnd I too said Jessie Kittie shallbe my modelAnd Kittie shall be my wife if shewill only say yes and Fred AtkinsSadies handsome brother parted thecurtains that divided the library fromthe pretty sitting room and stood before the two astonished girlsWhy Fred Atkins began SadieI know it Sadie he interruptedbut I didnt mean to play eavesdropper I came home early to day to tellyou and mother of my good fortune Ihave been taken into the firm as juniorpartnerFred and Sadies arms were aroundhimT knew you would be glad he saido I hurried home to tell you butwhen I came I found mother out andyou girls were in your room so I wentinto the library to write some lettersI heard you when you came into theroom but I kept on writing ThenKiltie came and I meant to come outas soon as 3 011 were seated but Kittiesstories were so interesting I couldntInterrupt them and 1 knew I should ifI came outAnd do you really mean to ask Kittie to be your wife asked JessieYes I have been in love with herfor a long time But I never knew until to day how genuine she isWell I think she loves you tooFred said JessieAnd so it proved for in a few weeksthe

doublebarreled cannon in the world In thenext place it was invented with a peculiar idea in the mind of the inventor It belonged to the MitchellThunderbolts a company of old menorganized here in 1863 purely for homedefense One of the company Mr JohnGilleland invented this cannon andhad it cast at the Athens foundryThe idea of Mr Gilleland was one ofconsiderable ingenuity A 50 footchain with the ends attached to twocannon balls was the charge and theidea of the inventor whs that when thecannon balls came out of the muzzleof the cannon they would have a tendency to diverge draw the chain tautand mow down an entire company Thecompany took the cannon out into thecountry near Athens one day to tet itIt was properly charged and wasouched off with great ceremony Oneof the balls got a little ahead of theother and then the mischief was topay It had a kind of circular motionand plowed up about a quarter of anacre of ground the members of thecompany in the meantime scatteringia all directions to keep from being hitby the flying chainThe old cannon was never used afterthai except at an occasional democraticjubilee when charges of powder wouldbe fired About five years ago theold cannon disappeared and not untila few days ago did our people knowwhere it was Last week it turned upin a juukshop but it was promptly purchased by the city Mr Neumyer whoowned the cannon had been

HartfordCourtroomThe propriety of spectators wearingskull caps in sessions of the courts hasbeen somewhat discussed by attaches ofthe courts in the county building andothers during the last few days Thediscussion was brought about by an incident which occurred in Judge Casescourt recently Inquiry shows that theofficer of the court had good precedentfor preventing one of the spectatorsfrom wearing a skull cap during thtsessionIt was on one of the days recentlvwhen the jury was in attendance thata tall and aged man walked into thecourtroom a few minutes after a caehad been taken up for trial As soon ashe got inside the door he took off hisovercoat and sat in one of the seatswithout the bar He had no soonerseated himself than he put his handin the pocket of his overcoat whichwas lying on the seat beside him Hetook from the pocket a skull cap placedit upon his head and then gave his undivided attention to the witness uponthe witness stand The court officerwas surveying the spectator all thetime and presently left his station andtold the spectator that he would haveto remove the from his headI am a clergyman said th spectator and I wear this cap in Canrch1 think I should be permitted to wearit hereAll heads must be uncovered incourt said the officerIf I am not permitted to weai thecap I shall have to go out said thetall manI cant help that said the officerYou must uncover vour head if youstayThe man left the courtroom in hasteand hurried from the building Heseemed to bea stranger to everyoneand he has not made his appearancein the courtroom since that timeAlthough skull caps are quite generally worn in halls and other publicplaces they are seldom noticed incourtrooms Judge Case saidwhen asked of the propriety ofspectators wearing skull caps in courtthat he knew of no rule asrainst it Hesaid that if a man was in the habit twearing a skull cap and his health demanded that he wear it he did notknow why it could not be worn undersuch conditions If a man wanted towear a cap in court through fancyJudge Case thought that would be different He did not know of the- incident regarding the skull cap in hiscourt until after it had happened Hadhe known he would have allowed theman to remain and wear the capAnother member of the judiciarywheu spoken to of the matter aidthat he saw no impropriety in thewearing of a skull cap in court Hedid not know that he had ever

Wisconsinagricultural college makes the following interesting and practical commentson an article in Wisconsin Agriculturist entitled Ensiling PotatoesThe article is an interesting one fromseveral points In gentral 1 am not infavor of putting root crops into a siloThe turnip beet or potato when takenfrom the ground in the fall and storedin the pit or cellar is a living object andunder normal conditions loses only avery little of its substance from week toweek because when dormant the condition of life is maintained at the minimum of food requirements The rootin the cellar or pit wastes a little day byday but the los is small When we cutup or slice roots and put them in thesio life is destroyed and fermentationsand decay set up at once and theseproceed quite rapidly under almost anyconditions Beets and turnips contain90 to 94 per cent water Because sovery watery these substances are notin any way suited for silage the potato on the other hand contains abotit20 per cent dry matter or as much asgreen corn forage It is possible thisparticular root or tuber may be usedwith success for silage I cannon beiiee however that putting potatoesinto the silo is very practical or thatthis material willbecome common as asilage substance If potatoes are verylow priced in the fall farmers generally hold them in pi is r cellars waitingfor rise and only feed them to stockin the spring when the markets are unsatisfactory To place them in a siloin the fail cute off all opportunity forsale at a biter dale Viewing the matter from iil sides it seems to me ourfarmers especially where corn can begrown had better rely upon that greatforage plant for silage material andhandle the potato crop much after thepresent planDried Cob for KindlingAfter corn cobs have thorough vdried it is quite common to use themfor kindling fires But the cob alone isa very poor substitute for wood forthis purpose a it does not make abright blaze and the proportion ofpotash is so large that the ashes willoou destroy what flame might otherwise come from it But if these cobsare dipped in kerosene oil they willhold enough to burn several minutesand by thi9 time the wood above willbe thoroughly afire This is reallythe only safe way to use kerosene forbuilding fires It should on no accountbe thrown on lighted nood from aboveEven if there is no explosion the woodwill not be set afire so well as it willfrom below American CultivatorThe only objection to lew headedirees is that they interfere with cultivationSCRUBS MUST GONo Stockman Who Stick to I hemCnu Reasonably Expect to MakeBoth Ends MeetScrub stock is not always bred thatway The best and bluest blood knownto breeders may be made to bring forthprogeny of the scrub order by carelessness on the part of the feederThe old saying that well fed is halfbred is not merely a saying It isfounded on truth and as a statement isquite exact The veriest scrub may bemade quite respectable by proper feeding but it can never be made a purebred animal It has not in it the quality to assimilate feed and put it to gooduse that is inherited by the pure bredanimal and the feed given to it willnever produce the results that wouldhave been shown if the care and skillthat lies behind the pure bred beasthad had some part in making it upThere is no excuse for scrub stockwhether bred or made so by careiessiiss Scrubby horses or cattle markthe owner as being at once non-progressiveand ill fitted for breeding orfeeding A man may not be financiallyable to stock his farm with pure bredstock but even the poorest farmer maycommand the services of good siresand in this way secure the benefits ofgood blood The first remove from ascrub where a pure bred sire is usedshows an improvement and four removes will generally produce an animal that will pass for a high gradeand possessing the good qualities ofthe breed it has been graded up withHappily the day of bred scrubsabout past Very few genuine pennyro al steers are to be found now andeach year they become fewer Thescrub made so by lack of care and careless feeding is still too much in evidence It will not disappear as long ascorn stover is left in the field for cattle to forage on during the winter Xoprofit can result from any kind ofscrubs and the man who allows themto remain on his farm and continue tabe scrubs will be the one who is readyto testify that there is no chance

inline with TooImIt is extremely important that everyfarmer train himself to handling toolsof all kinds If he has a forge withbellows and a toolhouse with turninglathe he can make extra whiffletreesclevises and other articles that are aptto break when men and teams are busiest Many of these can now be boughtquite as cheaply as they can be handmade But there are many thinirs thatare exceedingly handy to have aboutthe house or barn that cannot be purchased in the stores The toolhousewill be one of the favorite places forbovs on the farm to learn to be handywith tools and whatever they do inlater life thev will never berudsre thetime and experience it has taken togive thorn the lessons thus learnedSelecting Pig for BreedingBefore disposing of the spring pigsmake sure that you

extra care but it is not wise todo this every year Plump solid hogsare the kind for brood sows and thisselection is made after studying theherd all summer One thing it paysto do is to select those

Shine on the Old Plantation When a MaineYankee CalledThe last eclipse of the moon reminded a Virginian of a storyThe civil war he said did not endas I had hoped and when it was over Ifound myself the owner of my fathersplantation and half a hundred niggerswho refused to acknowledge Mr Lincolns emancipation proclamation ButI had no money 1 decided to sell outthe old place and go into a new country If some of you care to look it upyou will find in the files of a New Yorknewspaper in 1865 I think an advertisement of a southern plantation forsale at a bargain There was one happyidea in that advertisement at least Ithought so It was that the plantationwas one on which the sun never set Itwas not an original idea of course Ihad often heard my father speak of theplantation in that way He meant thatevery foot of it was under cultivationAnd it became known in our county andthe region round about as the plantation on which the sun never set In advertising it for sale I used the description knowing that some one wouldrecognize it and talk about it and thatis the secret of successful advertisingOne day while I was sitting on theporch we didnt call it veranda thena stranger called I very soon diagnosed him as a Yankee and a MaineYankee at that He had come to lookover the place and the news spreadamong the niggers like goose pkingsin a high wind After I had shown theprospective purchaser over a part ofthe plantation we returned to theporch where he became my guest Asouthern man never permitted a callerstranger though he was to leave hisgate without setting out the decanterand I offered the Maine Yankee the bestI had He guessed he would and Ireckoned he shouldWhile we talked about the possibilities of the old plantation and I hadworked in the sun as often as I couldI suddenly heard loud lamentationsdown in the nigger quarters I askedthe Maine man to accompany me if heliked as 1 knew he would be interested in what I supposed was a suddenreligious attack When we reached thescene some of the niggers fell flat onthe ground others were on their kneesand the pickaninnies had crowded under the cabins as far as they could andtheir feet were wriggling in the airThe noise subsided for a moment butquickly broke out louder than beforeThe burden or refrain of the supplications was about thisM Oh de good Lawd done die and desun gwine out and dont shine on de oleplantation no moI yelled and cussed until I finally gotthem quieted and then my Yankee visitor called my attention to the heavensThe sun was eclipsed The editor ofour count newspaper had failed to advise us of the event and I hadnt lookedinto my almanac lately After the Yankee had left I went down in the niggerquarters to do a little more cussin overthe outbreak and to remind the niggersthat above all things they must observegood order when strangers were aroundwith a view of purchasing The wifeof the old preacher and she always selected his texts and helped him in hiswork fanned herself vigorously withher dress skirt as she exclaimedMass Bevly she said yo pa aliussay dat de sun alius shine on dis plantation and you done say so yosof Ande sun alius did shine until databolishiner came down hyar and talk aboutbutin and den de sun go out MassBevTv in de hebbens dat de good Lawdmoughty unpleased dat an abolishinergit de ole placeAnd with this explanation the otherniggers fell to wailing again Oh degood Lawd done die and de sun gwineout and dont shine on de ole plantartion no mo I still own the old plantation X Y SunSensible Physical ExercisesI have always been much impressedwith the facility with which the graduate of West Point or Annapolis doesvariety of things in physical exerciserexercises some of which are perhapsnot always characterized by the nameof athletics although useful not only inphysical development but as adjunctsthrough life The man who can rideand who can swim and who can danceand who can fence and who can do other things such as are taught at WestPoint and Annapolis has distinct accomplishments the attainment ofwhich has not only benefited him during the period of attainment but thepossession of which will continue tobenefit him so long as he shall have theuse of his physical powersI have long thought that the graduate of Harvard ought to possess physical accomplishments equivalent toeven if not identical with those of hisbrothers at West Point and at Annapolis and I am inclined to think thatunless he is a cripple or otherwise infirm physically it is the duty of theuniversity to see that he does possesssuch before

in the ground About 10 I decided to take a walk and accidentallymeet them I took a roundabout waybecause there was sure to be more or lessgiggling when I made my appearance nomatter how nicely it was managedHero Bill helped himself to my first bestpipe and heaped a few more blessings onhis headWell said he after a few strong pullsat the pipe I soon reached a cursed littlehill which sat up against the mountainlike a pimple beside a mammoth wart andperched on the side of the measly bunchof dirt was an enormous rock left thereby a glacier I suppose The day it wasdropped there was cold but the day BillMorse found it was still colder Climbingup to the lower 6ide and leaning backagainst it I took a look around Justthen some one set off a blast or they begancannonading off Mole St Nicholas Anyway the jar seemed to shake the hill andthat stone moved I braced myself againstit instinctively the motion stopped andthen came one of thoso Hashes of intelligence for which I am famous as you knowold manYou have seen a schoolteacher takehis class into the yard and demonstratethat one boy can keep a ladder upright bylooking out for the center of gravity etcand that it takes them all to stop its falling when you let it tip Oh I knew allabout it Bill Morse knew If I let thatstone get started it would crush me tor itwas so broad I covld not spring out of theway I bored one shoulder into the double dyed thing and finally twisted roundso as to face it worked my way to theedge the cold sweat standing out all overme and jumped clear Things were darkfor a moment but I soon straightened outand looked to see where the rock had fallen It hadnt budgedI was going to ask Bill if lie was angrybut he had jumped up and was kickinghis valise around the room and I thoughtit unnecessaryBob he cried between the kickswords are poor things I agree with theman who said language was intended toconceal your real thoughtsAfter a few more kicks and a fresh pipeful Bill resumed I rushed round to thetop of that infernal rock determined topush it over if it didnt intend to take adrop itself I moved it about an inch andto do more than that would require all ofthe kings horses Oh but Solomon was awise one He said all men were foolsThat stone Bob was a rocking stoneWhen I realized what it was I wonderedwhy Solomon had not mentioned me particularly I began talking to the stoneand was just beginning to do myself andthat beastly chunk justice when that henpicnic came screaming down the mountain side They had seen the whole circusAlice gasped out Oh W Will its toofu funny and then put her hand to herside and absolutely shrieked with laughter I gave her one look and then toldher a plain truth that I know shell neverforgive Then I rushed back to the hotelgot my things and hero I am Its allover I m a tool and a wretched one iryboyI agreed with him but didnt mentionit Then the light was turned out and weturned in I slept but I dont think Billdid Ho moped around the house and ateprecious little

woman to whom the world did nothing inparticular until it treated her badly And Ithat happened when she had a grown updaughter and three sons at school and an jinvalid husband who could do nothing to- jward earning money that was neededThen it was that she thought of writinga book A friend who had dropped in oneevening told a story of an acquaintancewho had written a book in middle age jand made a great deal of money ThenMrs Abbey remembered that when shewas a girl before her marriage she hadwritter wo little stories and sent them to ja provincial ptper They had been accepted and paid forShe said to her husband I wonder if I jcould write a bookHo did not answer for he thought shewas not in earnest But Mrs Abbey jthought of it constantly uiuil ideas beganto crowd her brain She said to herselfI do believe I could write a book Thereis no harm in tryingShe got a packet of clumsy foolscap pa- jper and one night when all the household was asleep she lit a lamp and began jto write And the words came fluently Ivery fluently Her daughter Gwendolyn jawoke and seeing the light came to find iout what her mother was doing for thesetwo women shared every hope and careMother she cried seeing the pile ofpaper what are you doing Oh motherI do bolieve you are writing a bookAt first Mrs Abbey denied it from thesame impulse that had made her put herhand quickly over the writing when herdaughter came in But after a time sheconfessed that it was so and timidly readaloud the first chapter which she had justfinishedOh mother it is beautiful criedGwendolynShall I go on with it thenYes yes go on with it Its splendidIm sure it will sell Do go on with itSo she went on with it And when several chapters had been written she saidtimidly to her husband and sons whowere homo for the holidays I I thoughtI might be aljo to write a story I haveput down a few ideas here and Id like toknow if you think it worth going onwithIvo read it said Gwen and its sogoodMr Abbey took the closely writtenpages of MS and read them aloudIt is fine It is beautiful they criedAnd it was beautiful It was very beautifulShe went on writing It was to be areal book a great book as long as one ofScotts or Dickens and though her penwas so fluent the writing took a longtime Besides she had other work to dohousehold duties to tire her out duringthe day and sometimes her head achedwhen evening came but as soon as shetook up the pen her cheeks grew flushedand her mind grew warm with hope Shelost sight of the bare surroundings andlived in the atmosphere which falls like ashimmering mist from heaven upon thosewho commit their souls to paper and writewith their lifes blood She was networking for fame or glory or celebrity Shehad no worldly ambition but she workedfor husband and children for bread forlife itselfEvery Sunday Mr Abbey read aloud thechapters that had been written during theweek and they all cried It is beautiful The crush had left them smlieientmoney to live on for about 18 monthsBy that timo the book would be finishedand the book must needs be a success bocause it was written with all the best of awomans soul They were shy of mentioning it to outsiders but Mr Abbeyread part of it to a few intimate friendsand they admired itI am glad of that said Mr Abbey inconfidence to his daughter because Irather mistrusted my own judgmentthough the book seems to me very beautij ful but Mrs Murray admired it Immensely And she ought to be a judgesaid Gwen because shes a cousin ofI that Mr Johnson the journalist and must1 know a lot of literary people The booktook nearly IS months to write and byI that time the money was all used up Thelast chapter had been finished and theend written with a flourish The manuscript was large and bulky and very closely written They packed it up in brownpaper and sent it off to a literary agent asMrs Murray had advised them to do AsMrs Abbey handed it over the postofficecounter she felt as though it was her hearti that she was sending forth made op Into abrown paper parcel sealed and registeredand labeled MS only About threeWeeks later the postman brought the letterfor which they had been watching Theliterary agent wished to see Mrs Abbeyi the following dav if she would come tohis offices He said nothing about thebook but there was an undefinable fragranco of kindness about the businesslikelittle note or su at least it seemed to themNext day Mrs Abbey started off withGwen both their hearts beating Theywent in their best dresses Mr Linley wasawaiting them When he heard them coming up the stairs he began to wish himself 100 miles off He had given the deathblow to many hopes in the course of hislife but ho winced somewhat all the samePerhaps he had the faculty of reading between the linesAnd Gwen and her mother sat quietlywithout a word while he broke to MrsAbbey as gently as he could the truththt her ureat bulky story hid a beautifulroul in a body hopelessly unlovely Itwould be useless to offer it to any publisher and even it anybody would take it itwould never sellI an sorry said Mrs Abbey withdry lips Gwen could not speak or lookupMr Linley winced Then he told herthat he could put her in the way of doinganother kind of literary work where herfluency would be useful and wheie beautiful thoughts were not needed Would shecome back to see him this day weekGwen and her mother walked away Theygot into a dingy omnibus to save theirbest dresses from being spoiled by therain They were quite silent for a longtimeNevermind Gwennio said the mother at last putting one cold hand up toher mouth I shall do something elseAnd he seemed a kind man M EFinlay in Cincinnati HeraldDevils IslandDevils island is not named on themaps It is the smallest and most northern of the three Isles du Salut situatedabout
