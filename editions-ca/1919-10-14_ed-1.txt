THOMPSON NOT OP-iPOSED FOR REPRESENTATIVEThe withdrawal of Mr. N. A.Moore, of Paris, Republican nomineefor Representative, leaves Mr. JamesH. Thompson, Bourbon's Democraticjiominee, unopposed in his race.This means that Frankfort will bethe temporary abiding place for Mr.Thompson during the next sessionof the Legislature.To make assurance doubly sureMr. Moore called on County ClerkPearce Paton, Saturday, and officially notified him to have his namestricken from the ballot now in thehands of the printers. This removesthe official barrier in Mr. Thompson's candidacy and means his election in November."With Mr. Thompson occupying theseat in the Legislative halls that hasbeen filled by many able men representing different walks of life, theinterests of Bourbon county peoplewill be in excellent hands, and theirconfidence in him will be justified.. oTKEJ) BASSET TELLS ONE ONCYNTHTANA.The Maysville Daily Ledger hasthe following "joke" perpetrated byFred Bassett, popular and wellknown traveling man and entertainer: "Fred W. Bassett, representing thePower Grocery Company, of Paris,Ky., a hustling salesman came 'cleanfrom Cynthiana here to-day.' He saidat Cynthiana a dentist pulled a toothfor a gentleman, and after the 'operation' gave him a good, stiff drinkof 'Old Bourbon.' The gentlemanhappened to mention it down thestreet, and in less than a half hour,sixty-five men were up to get a toothpulled, and it took the entire Cynthiana nolice force to hold thecrowd- which proved very difficult1,for one man. It seems that Bassetthasn't a tooth left in his head."ADMINISTRATORS APPOINTEDIn the County Court Judge GeorgeBatterton appointed James "Webb asadministrator of the estate of JohnW.

ALEXANDER KILLED JNAUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTIsaac S. Alexander, aged aboutsixty-five, was struck by an automobile in front of the BourbonCounty Y. M. C. A. building about8:30 o'clock, Saturday night, sustaining injuries which resulted indeath a few moments later. Fromthe testimony of eye-witnesses itseems to have been an unavoidableaffair.Mr. Alexander had just left hishome, and was walking along Mainstreet, and coming to a point infront of the Y. M. ,C. A. was endeavoring to cross the street. A bigtruck was sitting on the side of thestreet from which he started and asMr. Alexander, who had a habit ofwalking with his head hung down,as if in deep study, emerged from therear of the big machine, he wasstruck by an automobile, driven byStanley Dickson, of North Middletown, who, in company with severalyoung ladies of that vicinity, was returning from Lexington. Neither thedriver of the machine or the victimof the accident was aware of theother's presence. Mr. Dickson's machine had just turned into Mainstreet from Tenth, and he was notaware of Mr. Alexander's presenceuntil he felt the impact of the bodyagainst the radiator. He was driving a slow rate of speed, according to witnesses.As soon as possible Mr. Dicksongot out of his car, and with the helpof others, had the unfortunate mancarried to his home, at the corner ofMain and Ninth streets. Dr. J. M.Williams was summoned, but beforethe physician arrived Mr. Alexanderhad breathed his last. An examination showed he had sustained a broken neck, all his ribs and both armwere broken, and he was also bruised about the body.There was hardly a better-knownman in Paris than the victim of thisaccident. He was born and raised inthis city, receiving his education inthe schools of his day. He was agraduate of the Edgar Military Institute, at that time one of the leading educational institutions of Paris.He had a wonderful memory and wasone of the best-read men in thecounty, being especially well versedin both modern and ancient history:He was well-informed on all mattersof public interest and took an especial interest in the doing of theJn1!V.nmfiira TAr)1ac the 1apria1atlirt nfMm -SLaLH and the Congress of th'eHUnited States. He was a veteran ofthe Spanish-American war, havingbeen color-bearer in Company I, ofthe Second Kentucky Regiment, recurited largely from Bourboncounty.Mr. Alexander was a son of thelate Mr. William W. Alexander, oneof the brightest legal minds of hisday in the county, and was a grandnephew of Jefferson Davis, -presidentof the Southern Confederacy. Hisparents, and two brothers, Williamand Jack Alexander, preceded him tothe grave several years ago. He issurvived by two brothers, Hugo- andRichard Alexander, and one sister,Mrs. Lucy Alexander Anderson, allof Paris, making his home with thelatter.The funeral was held at 2:30o'clock, yesterday afternoon, withservices conducted at the grave inthe Paris Cemetery by Rev.

The communication follows:"Plans are rounding into shapefor the greatest 'safety' moyemeatever undertaken the National Hailroad Accident Prevention Drive tobe staged during the last two weeksof October by all railroads throughrout the country under governmentcontrol. C. M. Anderson, RegionalSupervisor of Safety, has announcedthat the roads of the South werewell advanced in their preparationsfor participating in the drive, withfull determination to stand at thetop of the list of safe railroads whea.the record is made up. x"Experience has proved that themajority of railroad accidents areavoidable; that a large part of theenormous toll of killed and. injured1reported every year is due not to theunavoidable catastrophes which attract public attention, but to the little lapses from caution which, causedeaths or injuries here and thereevery day in the year. Educatiom;and constant training reduces thenumber of lapses, big and little,and ihe preaching of 'safety during the past few years has savedmany a life and limb."One of the first steps toward preparing railroad employees of thSouth for the part they are to playwill be the posting of an Octobercalendar with the dates 18th to31st in red in all stations, officestool houses, shops, cabooses andother places where they will attract 'attention. Industries along railroad lines will be asked to co-operate,especially in the way of removing unnecessary hazards andwarning their own employees of thedanger ever present on railroadtracks. Owners and drivers of automobiles also are to be called upon,to help.

Old ladies, somber-facedand white of hair, welcome the short skirt, for, whetheranyone else believes it or not, theycajole themselves into the comforting delusion that the new styletakes away years from their appearance. And, mayhap, this is true. Atany rate, the short skirt is sanitary.It gives the ankles air and it doesnot stir up a cloud of . germ-ladendust as the parade goes by. It givesthe girl with plump calves an opportunity to display her charms without being called brazen or immodest. Whatever is sanctioned by fashion is right, according to the feminine viewpoint. So, when the vogueof the short skirt has passed awayand trains are stylish again thesesame women will be very careful notto allow a glimpse of their feet asthey stroll down Main street (inParis, Ky.) Then the woman whowould dare appear in a skirt of thepresent period would be ostracisedby her discreet sisters, and the Prodigal Son would go back home andtake a chance on what the familyhad prepared in his honor.?MBSBSSSSS!r BSSSSSSSSSSSSSShSbsSBb fiWsJ SSSSSSSflRRSBflHESs&H? szi&eJBmSBBiBBaSBK9BSSSSSBSSSSsnBSSSSBSBW;snaSiBllBB "gSaMRSJPBJRssasSBMS 'BSSnBSffiBBP-SSSZiBlK , rffifiSlSgSSSSSSflBSSSMrSSSSSSSbSSSBBHBEBhBSBBSBSSsW"1E 'BflSBftflvlBSSSsTBSSBBSSSSSSPmKkF''KFkTvmrm!, ".ssssssssssslSSSSSS 'BSkN-BSSBw- 5k lL'B&&k , V& 'srMBfe'' ?W..:"bbbbbb ;SSSSSSSL.

Shinnick, one of theablest of the younger news writersof Kentucky, who has been followingEdwin P. Morrow on his speakingitinerary says that after talking withthe voters in the different towns hehas visited, that he is convinced thatthe independent voters are for Governor Black. Mr. Shinnick says thatGovernor Black will get every Democratic vote, as he has found no disaffection anywhere. With the largeand respectable body of independentswho hold the interests of the Stateabove any party for him, it wouldseem that Governor Black has hiselection cinched.Democrats, however, should takenothing for granted. There is noearthly reason why any KentuckyDemocrat should vote for a man likeEd. Morrow against such a man asGovernor Black. There is, on theother hand, every reason why Governor Black should get every Democraaic vote in the State. In theevent of a vacancy in the UnitedStates Senate from Kentucky theGovernor elected November 4th willhave the appointing power. If thatGovernor is Black the Senator appointed will be a Democrat, who willuphold the President in his greatwelfare work for all the world. If byany calamity it should be Morrowwhoa ppoints a Senator to fill a vawho appoints a Senator to fill a vaon to vote and work with the Pen-rose-Lodge-Borah-Johnsonobstructionists to do all they can to embarrass and harass the Presidentsolely fox political effect.Let every Democrat in-Kentuckyget to the polls November 4th andcast his vote for a- man of cleancharacter, high intergity and noblepurpose, whose sole ambition is toserve his people well as Governor.oMore that 16,000 members of theBrotherhood of Railway Trainmenwill receive special medals for warwork.Governor James D. Black is making votes wherever he is appearingin Kentucky. The Governor knowsthe people of his State, understandsthem, sympathizes with them in theirstruggles for none of them has hada harder struggle with poverty thanhimself and withal will make Kentucky one of the best Governors sheever has had. State Chairman TomRhea informs us that if the Democrats come out and vote GovernorBlack will have the largest majorityever given any Democratic candidatefor Governor. ' He also gives warning, however, against over-confidenceor reports of Republican dissension.While the personality of their candidates, it is true, does not appeal tomany high-class, loyal Republicans,it is and always has been a fact thatthe Republicans of Kentucky votetheir party ticket, regardless of thecandidates or how they became candidates. Mr. Morrow, they feel, isentitled to ttieir support, having beenduly branded "o. k." by Mr. Hert'spersonally-conducted Lexington convention, and for that reason theywill support him. There is littledoubt that Governor Black will receive the united support of the Democrats and independents and that hewill snow Mr. Morrow under. Therevelations in regard to the pricescharged Kentuckians by the Ballardflour mills at Louisville will not helpthe Republicans in their attempt toenlist Democratic sympathy. Mr.Ballard, the Republican candidate forLieutenant Governor, charges thepeople of his own city and State$1.10 a barrel more for flour thanhe charges the consumers of NewOrleans, and he admits it.Census Clerks WantedCensus Clerks, (men, women) 4,000 needed. $95 month.

Mott, of New York, theGeneral Secretary of the InternationalCommittee of the Y. M. C. A, was theguest of Louisville and Kentucky onthe occasion of the state-wide conference on the second of the month. Dr.Mott was given a remarkable reception, and in the opening words of hisaddress at the evening dinner, precipitated a volume of cheers and greatenthusiasm from the three hundred andfifty people in the spacious auditorium of the Seelbach Hotel."We have come out into a new day,a day of citizenship, and we'll followour President in this great undertaking of reaching out to help the nationsof the world," he declared. His expression brought a storm of applause,which grew Into loud cheers of enthusiasm. Continuing, Dr. Mott paida glowing tribute to the hard work,unselfishness and sacrifices of President Wilson. He spoke touchlngly ofthe adverse news from Washingtonconcerning the condition of the chiefexecutive, and asked that he be specialty remembered In the prayers ofthe audience that "God would sparehim to the American people m a timewhen he is so sorely needed."4T think if he could be here tonightand hear your cheers he would beheartened," Dr. Mott said.Allies Want Y.

The luncheon meeting for state secretaries and district chairmen waswidely representative of .Kentucky, according to the word of State 3;. M. O.A. officers, and the dinner meeting 4nthe evening was equally representativef'Louisville. The quota of this cityIn the coming campaign, $41,000, wasannounced.The luncheon was presided over byL. L. Anderson of Louisville, the president of the State Y. M. C. A. andcampaign chairman. General Chas. P.Summerall, Commander of the FirstDivision, the famous "Fighting Firstin France," and new commander ofCamp Taylor, was the first speaker ofthe program and the first appearanceof the general as a speaker In Louisville. "I am no speaker," said GeneralSummerall, "but anyone is able to talkon such a subject as the work of theY. M. C. A. In the war."General Summerall spoke eloquentlyon the great service the Y. M. C. Arendered, and said in substance:"The crowning inspiration of theY. M. C. A. was sending the splendidwomen, who brought the spirit of thmothers and sisters to the soldiers.They sustained the splendid morale olthe army and were a real factor lawinning the war."Mr. P. C. Dix, the State Secretary,made a ringing statement of the actualachievements of the State Y. M. C. Adwelling upon the results secured bythe district scheme of organisation.He said there is a Y. M. O. A 'secretary competent and ecperienoed in Y.M. C. A. work and a committee backof him, for every ten counties in thestate. This plan has been in actualoperation for the past two years andIs not a piece of imagination causedby tho war and presented as papexplans. The work presented in thState Y. M. C. A publication, "At 11for Rorenty-five Yeara," was a realreport of statewide activities that rep-1 roseotod th entlra state. "OurJilrim,":"lwmuV"nmaior us to carry a messagsMo everyhigh school in the state in a period ofeleven days, and If It were not forsome of the places some of you comefrom, counties that have no railroadsIn them, we could make it in less timethan this." "Now Tour most timelyquestion is," he continued, "will youmake it possible for the State Y. M. 0.A. to maintain and extend its scheme4' work so as to care for the needs ofyoung men and boys in the small counties of the unorganized fields, or willit he compeUed to reduce Its organisation to such an extent that some otherorganisation will come in whose motive will be other than the religiousone.Following Mr. Dix, Rev. R. T. Nooeof Frankfort eloquently advocated thepolicy of the Y. M. C. A.'s occupyingthe entire field and offered a motionto that effect t- seconded in an equallyearnest and eloquent tone by GibneyOscar Letcher, an attorney of Henderson. On the call of the campaigndirector, C. A. Tevebaugh, every district from the "Purchase" to the BigSandy reported organization and ahearty acceptance of their quota of thestatewide objective.Dr. Mott's Address.John R. Mott's address was one ofthe most impressive discourses everdelivered in Louisville. The distinguished American was introduced byDr. E. Y. Mullins, president of theSouthern Baptist Theological Seminary, who, In presenting the guest ofhonor, called attention to the manyconspicuous positions of leadershipwhich Dr. Mott 1ms occupied. Amongthese were head of the Student Volunteer Movement for years; head of theorganization of the International Y.M. C A.; head of the War WorkCouncil of the Y. M. C. A., and headof the Edinburgh Conference. "Thougha layman, Dr. Mott is the outstandingreligious figure of the day, because thefire of his spiritual devotion burns sostrong and so bright in the midst of apractical life," concluded Dr. Mullins.Dealing With a New World."I remind you that you are dealingwith a new world a shaken, quivering world a world in which pillarsthat were deemed pillars of strengthand were pointed to with pride, havecrumbled to dust at our feet," said Dr.Mott, after a brief preliminary whichexplained that he had for the pastthirty-one years been "cruising" overthe world on missions of helpfulness inforty-six countries ; that he had vlsKedtne war zones of Europe six timesduring the course of the world warand had traveled 7,000 miles on theeastern front.Continuing, the speaker said: It isan Impoverished world also, for up tosix months ago it had cost over 260billions of dollars; it is an exhaustedworld both economically and vitally,as demonstrated by the 11,000,000graves that have been filled because ofthe struggle; and it is still a ''sorrowing and suffering worldf, for in all mysix visits to the war zones I spentjnuch of my time in the homes, and notone' that I can recall but had beenvisited once7 and oftenniany times,Dy tne aaric snaaow or aeatn.The World Is "On U. Serves."Dr. Mott said that the people everywhere Impressed him as being "ontheir nerves" and in a state of Irritability, which is productive ofcriticism. He declared that it is awonderful time to live when a wholeworld is accessible to new ideas. Comparatively speaking, it is an unselfishworld too, he said, for although It isnot so unselfish as it was a year ago,or two years ago, it is far more unselfish than before the war."I had thought that I might see oneof two nations plastic, but I neverthought to see a whole world moltenand plastic as is the world todaybut it will set, and' set hard in a newmold, and this Is the golden opportunity of an organization like the Y.M. C. A, which can render a uniqueservice at this time because of itscontact with both capital and labor Inthe industrial unrest. Its forwardlooking program in the development oiyoung manhood physically, Intellectually and spiritually, can- be a determining factor in the molding of thenations, for I have been thrown withthe leaders of many of the nations,and none of them are sure that theyknow the way. Yes, it is a humbleworld, too, for where is there a nationtoday which boasts that it knows howto deal with Its problems?" he said.Praises State Y. M. C. A. Work."I have been particularly impressedwith the plans wmch have just beenlaid before you men of Kentucky. Iam sure you cannot realize how farreaching this program may be. Because of this, I would like to say thatby a peculiar circumstance, I havebeen able to get a larger view a setting as It were on the effect of justwhat such an enterprise may accomplish ; by reason of the fact that Ihave traveled in every country in theworld, have been associated with thepeoples and leaders of so many national, and have watched the virus ofBolshevism, which seeks to cleave the'nations into class hatred, spread overEurope and the United States. Iwould say that you can have no conception of the multiplying possibilitiesof this program ; or of the healing possibilities of its application. It is apivotal campaign. There will be newenergies released. It looks into thesuccesses and visions of the churches."Army "Y" Men Elect.The Army Y. M. C.

If you feel uplifted by beautiful music, do something that will tally with your mood,and then the music has been worthwhile. If you read something that isinspiring, at once do something, no,matter how small, that is a little different and a little superior to yourroutine. The theory applies with equaltruth to the reading of books as morethan a pastime.

Rogers, announces that80,000 enumerators will be neededto take the next census. The workbegins on January 2 and will lastabout two weeks in cities, and amonth or more in rural districts.Rates of pay will vary, depending upon the locality and character of thedistrict to be canvassed. The average pay per enumerator at the censusof 1910 was about $70. At thiscoming census it will probably be notless than $100."Active, intelligent, and reliablemen and women, not less than 18years of age, are needed for thistask," said Director Rogers, "and, ina sense, this is a call for volunteers.The importance of a complete andreliable census, especially in thesecritical times when more than everbefore perhaps we need completedata regarding population, conditions, tendencies, and resources, canhardly be over-emphasized. The reorganization of the social and economic structure and the readjustment of international relations necessitated by the War must be based onaccurate knowledge if we are to actwisely and deal justly with all classesand all interests. It is hoped, therefore, that public-spirited energeticpeople throughout the country willvolunteer to act as census enumerators even though they may not carefor the positions so far as the pay isconcerned. I should be sorry tothink, and I do not believe, that allour 'potnotism was used up by thewar and none left over for publicservice in times of peace."Mr. Jos. W.

Hissermons in all of the meetings werelogical, practical and oratorial. Thegood that Dr. Thacker did in Millers-burg will be felt long after he hasp-nup from us and there are nonewho heard him but who appreciatehis work, and wish him pronouncedsuccess wherever he may go. Thesong services were under the direction of Mr. and Mrs. Harry P.
