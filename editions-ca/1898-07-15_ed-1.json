INTO THE LIGHT
Gladys Wallingford threw herself down
on her couch burying her head deep in
the cushions redolent of pino
She had never been happy for more than
a moment slnco her fathor died She had
been strangely like him almost lanky
with white skin and big heavy lidded
black eyes and marvelous blue black hair
and he big bronzed major of the Fif
teenth lancers full of wonderful tales of
India and Africa had fairly idolized her
showering upon her susceptiblo passion
ate little heart fond foolish admiration
and joyous pride Ho died when she was
9 and although she had changod hub
little in 10 yoars now she was told alio
was swarthy a bean polo not fib to bo
seen in a drawing room For it must bo
understood Major Wallingford had left a
window and two other daughters older
than Gladys all three beauties after one
style petite blond portly attractive The
incono was limited and to the youngest
daughter had been alloted by common
consent all tho small disagreeable duties
of tho household along with the odds and
ends of clothing from her sisters ward
robes
Sho got up and lighted a lamp I
mush bo very self possessed and deter
mined sho went on as sho bathed her
hot face They mustnt catch me at a dis
advantage So sho dressed horsolf care
fully putting on herono decent frock aud
when sho lifted the portieres and entered
class carriage and come toward thom two
well gloved hands extended a smile on
her face All envy died out of thoir
breasts She seemed beyond even that
too big too gloriously beautiful Hor gen
erosity hor seemingly complete forgive
ness of their former selfishness and cruolty
set them an example of the magnanimity
such as their petty souls had never before
conceived
They wore all chatter all questions
They demanded detailed accounts of hor
doings of the last year
Tell us from the very beginning they
said and so sho told of hor arrival at
Bath of her precious godmother of her
London season but go modestly of hor
success that they would never have guessed
her triumph from her accent They talked
until late into the night getting nearer to
one another than they had ever been
Im so tired she said at last Wont
you come to my room and lot me got my
clothes off We can talk so much more
comfortably in wrappors
Her maid had already unpacked her
boxes and the room was filled with photo
graphs and signed sketches and exquisite
bits of glass and embroidered silks clev
er mens offerings to a beautiful and gra
cious woman Gertrude was looking at
the silver which fairly loaded the dress
ing table And who is this sho asked
turning toward her sistor and holding up
a large enameled framo with the picture
of a marvelously handsome man looking
from it
Gladys dropped her eyes just a inomont
and then raising them sho walked
straight and buoyantly to hor mothor took
her in her arms and kissed hor closely sev
eral times Her voice was low and allur
ingly sweet when she spoko again
He is Lord Stansbury sho said and
if mother will give her consent I will
marry him in tho fall Chicago News
Witchcraft In Bavaria
The oldest mention of witchcraft in
Bavarian law is the imposition of a fine of
12 shillings about 20 cents upon persons
who injure the harvests by magic arts In
addition to this fine tho sorcerer is also
made pecuniarily responsible to the owner
for loss of property Penaltios of a like
character were also inflicted upon such as
foretold future events produced storms or
causod horses and cattle to disappear by
means of diabolical machinations
In Arbeos Life of Corbinianus the
first bishop of Freising it is related that
as he was one day riding up to the castle
he met an old woman reputod to be a
witch accompanied by mon bearing meat
and one of them leading a live animal
On asking whence they carao and what
they were doing he was told that the
dukes son had been vexed by demons and
that she had healed him This informa
tion so excited the wrath of tho bishop
that he leaped from his horse and gave the
old hag a sound beating He also took
away the gifts which she had receivedfore
her services and distributed them among
the poor at the gate of the city This in
cident occurred between 718 and 724

HER CRUSOE
I When Edgar Carroll and Irene Hayno
plighted over again thoir troth with tha
solemn earnestness of lovers in tho hour of
parting either would have staked exist
ence on the others truth
For three years Edgars letters came
bearing messages of love which seamed so
real that Ireno could almobt fimoy them
uttered at her sido insteaJ of coming from
the other sido of tho world
At last one came that sot hor heart in a
flutter and causod a brighter light to
sparkle in her oyes It spoko of her lovers
speedy return Success had crowned his
efforts and at last ho might stnd without
blushing in tho presonco of proud old Wal
ter Hayne and speak his mind freely
Then there was an interval in which no
lottors came
Months passed and still no tidings
Irenos letters remained unanswered At
last sho could not oven hope Hor lover
must bo dead Sho could never believe
him faithless Her cheek grew paler and
her stop loss elastic and anxious friends
began to shake their heads and hint of
failinq health
Her fathers fears beenmo alarmed
Physicians counselod travel and change of
air Tho experiment was triod but with
out perceptiblo benefit
During the absonco of Mr Hayne and
his daughter a stranger had taken up his
abodo in tho place of thoir residence
Who or want Air Aewcome was
tho drawing room a few momonts before whence he came nobody pretonded
the dinner hour even her mothor started a
bit at the picture she made Tho creamy
white gown with its gold bolt and collar
her white face with largo lustrous oyes
tho masses of hair coiled on hor daintily
poised head it carao to Mrs Wallingford
with a shock of surprise that hor youngest
daughter was beautiful
Gladys I had a letter from Mrs
today Gladys looked up
She was surprised at her own audacity
And what has that to do with mo
she asked V
A great deal answered her mothor
Sho is your godmother a very rich and
a very eccentric old lady who sonds al
most in tho form of a command an invi
tation to you to visit her Sho suffers
from gout and has taken a house at Bath
for the season I suppose sho wants you
as a sort of companion You might coma
in for a very nice little legacy if you play
your cards well
Gladys almost shivered at the words
Gladys Wallingford on the Monday fol
lowing the receipt of the invitation loft
hor mothers house to pay hor visit to a
total stranger and in due course they re
ceived a telegram to tho effect that sho
had arrived safely at her destination
Before the end of tho week there carao a
letter from Mrs Brinsloy McKay
With your permission it said I will
kcop Gladys awhile longer Sho suits me
exactly her fathers perfect image in
voice in carriage in thought I loavo for
London again before long and as Gladys
has never seen a season there it w ill bo a
treat to her As you havo so many girls
you will be able to sparo ono of them to an
old woman like me wont you
And one morning Gertrude and Juliot
awoke to find their sister the most oole
brated beauty of the yoar She was pre
sented at court sho went to tho best
houses for hor hostess know every one
that was worth knowing in all sots hor
meo was continually linked with royal
beauties
So it was net until nearly a year had
gone by that Mrs Wallingford ono morn
ing received a telegram saying that Gladys
would be home at 7 oclock The two
girls didnt want to co to tho station to
meet her but curiosity at last mastered
them and at 7 oclock the threo stood
each one in her best gown waiting for the
express train from London They couldnt
help the rapid beating of their hearts as
the train pulled up There they saw the f he stood motionless
tall and radiant sister stop out of first Nowcome
a
or
to
know yet every man woman and child
was ready to vouch for his respectability
Ho was a bachelor and lived alono rarely
appearing in society yet often enough to
avoid tho appeoranco of shunning it
His habits of soclusion wore soon meas
urably abandoned He was constantly
meeting Ireno first by seeming accident
at tho house of such friends as sho was ac
customed to visit then by direct calls up
on herself
At ono of these interviews tho conversa
tion turned upon Australia where Mr
JCewcomo had spent some years In the
course of it ho mentioned a name which
caused Ireno to start
Edgar Edgar Carroll You knew
him then sho managed to say with
effort
Ho was my most intimate friend re
plied Mr Xewcomc with seeming care
lessness at tho same time scMining keenly
her agitated face tlit is until ho mx
ried
Marriod
It was considered a good match I be
lieve Mr Newcomo added pretending
not to notice the effect of Lif words The
lady was a wealthy colonists daughtor
an only child and all that
Tho blow fell with cruel force For a
moment Irenes faculties were stunned
Some months later when Irones lather
hinted that Mr Xewcomo had asked per
mission to become her suitor and that his
own sanction had bfen already given he
was agreeably surprised at tho manner in
which the announcement was received
By sacrificing herself sho could save her
fathers fortune and for horself what did
it matter now
It was the ovening before the wedding
day and Mr Newcomo had called to pay
his last visit as a wooer
Irenes face was palor than usual and
her manner was more disturbed but her
father was in too high spirits and Mr
Newcome too polite to notice the change
They were in tho midst of an agreeable
chat when a visitor was announcod who
insisted on seeing Mr Hayno alone
In no gracious mood Mr Hayne passed
into an adjacent apartment whence ex-
cited voices wore soon heard
At the sound of ono of them both Irene -and
Mr Kewcome started to thoir feet
So the villain is here exclaimed Ed
gar Carroll thrusting open the door But
l Irenes white face mob his angry gaze and
for the moment had believed
himself in personal poril and had shrunk
back coweringly but a moments reflec
tion assured him that in the presence of
Mr Hayne and his daughtor he had no
cause for fear
In tho distant land to which wo had
both gone in quest of gold this man and
myself became friends Wo shared the
same tent and had no secrets from oaoh
other In treasuro seeking I proved tho
more fortunate of tho two and my gains
had already reached tho point I had pro
posed they should attain whon my friendi
suggested a visit to somo unoxplored is
lands of which ho pretended to have heard
rumors and of whoso wealth we might
become the solo possessors
We fitted out a small vessel and after
a voyage of several days anchored off a
thiokly wooded island Leaving the crew
on board my friond and myself went
ashore and began our search In a se
cludod spot I was felled to tho earth by a
blow from behind and left for dead
On regaining consciousness I found
myself alono I ran to tho shore but the
vessel was no longer in sight
One day I descried a sail in the dis
tance The sight made mo wild with joy
I shouted and signaled and by every
means in my power sought to make my
presonco known
But still the ship held her course
Frantic with desptiir I rushed into the
waves determined to swim toward her
while strength hold out when at Jongth
she shortened sail and I saw a boat low
ered from her side
I conducted my deliverers to the treas
ure I had found There was enough for
us all I returned to find myself robbed
of my precious gains whose place of con
cealment was known only to myself and
him who had sought my life to get pos
session of them But the loss I regarded
as a trifle I was now the possessor of
treble tho amount
Irono Carroll is a happy wife now and
never happier than when listening to a
chapter from the adventures of her own
Robinson Crusoe Exchange
