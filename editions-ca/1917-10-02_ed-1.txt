Farmers on the streetsyesterday were dividing time between"discussions of the war, crops and politics, with the latter coming strong atthe finish.A general review of the candidateswho have been selected in the primary election in August shows thatthe Democratic nominees are practically without opposition, and there isvery little reason to believe that thetalk of a fusion ticket, such as washeard some time after the election,or of Republican opposition, will bedeveloped into anything more thantalk. The Democrats are' expected toput up an aggressive campaign, justas if they had active opposition.Unless there are some unexpecteddevelopments of eleventh-hour entrants, the voters of this city andcounty will elect the following ticketat the November election:For State Senator George Hon, ofClark County.For Representative C.

The groom,-who is a member of the EpiscopalUnit No. 34, of New York, which heTecently joined as a brain specialist,was married in Grace church, inNew York, on Sunday to Miss JeanMacdonough, of Philadelphia.It was several years ago that theyoung Dr. Frank, while a studentat the University of Pennsylvaniamet Miss Macdonough, whose father,now deceased, was a prominent banker of the Quaker City. A few monthsago when he left for the East to jointhe hospital unit aiiswering the callof his country, he again met MissMacdonough, whowas taking an active 'interest in the raising of Red-Cross funds. The common cause ofpatriotism proved an inspiration toCupid and the result of the severalmonths' renewal of acquaintanceshipwas announced of the engagementand approaching marriage.Capt. Shelby Frank, of the Ordinance Department of the UnitedStates Army, a brother of Dr. Frank,who is stationed at SpringnelcLTMass.,was the best man. A rumor broughtto Louisville says the bride will goConfronted by an audience composed of the most representativewomen of Paris and Bourbon county, an audience that is saidto have been one of the largest thatever gathered in the big CircuitCourt room, Miss Curry Breckinridge,of Lexington, in an address that willforever live in the memories of herauditors, told yesterday -of her experiences near the fighting line "somewhere in France," and delighted anaudience that was not the least bitchary of attesting their appreciation.Miss Breckinridge was introducedby-Mrs, Fanniebelle Sutherland, pres-jident of the City Federation of Clubs,in a neat address that was a littlegem in itself, and was followed byMiss Breckinridge. At the conclusion of the meeting a free willoffering amounting to a good-sizedsum was taken for the purpose offurthering the work of the Red Cross.- te m mGOING FAST.Thecoming of October court daysaw one of the biggest crowds in thecity than on any similar occasion formany months. The fine weather, thesplendid progress the farmers havebeen making with their crops, andthe general easy tone of the situationall tended to make the day in thenature of a vacation for the agriculturists. There was a good supply of mulesand horses on the market and dealers were kept busy in making transactions. A'large number changedhands at good prices. The generaltone of business was gQod and indicated a set determination among allclasses to "keep business as usual."The itinerant street preacher dividedume ana attention of the crowdwith the "horse traders," and allwent along merrily. At the courthouse one of the largest crowds everinside the walls heard Miss CurryBreckinridge, of Lexington, deliveran Interesting talk of her experiences in France. Merchants reportedbusiness and collections both good.IThe name of the adQTessee should. be written as plainly as possible andalways given in full.

George Harris, rector ofSt. Peter's Episcopal church of thiscity, to whom a call had been extended, signified his acceptance oftrust. Rev. Harris will continue withthe Paris church until November, butwill act in an advisory capacity withthe faculty of Margaret College, ofwnich he has has also been chosen asDean.The announcement that Rev. Harris had been chosen to take the rectorship of St. John's Episcopalchurch, in Versailles was receivedwith profound regret by the peopleor .Fans and the congregation of St.Peter's church, of which he had beenrector since 1912. Rev. Harris hasendeared himself to the people of thiscommunity by his uniform courtesy,his attainments as an orator, ministerand man, and they regret the chancethat will take him and his estimablefamily from us to new duties in anew place. He is a man whose genial disposition at once made him. awide circle of friends in Paris, whos'ebest wishes follow him to his newcharge.At the same time the vestry, of St.John's church ratified the action ofthe Board of Directors of MargaretCollege in electing Rev. Harris asDea:n of the College, an office whichwas created to meet the situationcaused by the removal of the president, the Rev. J. M. Maxon, to Louisville. Dr. Maxon still retains thepresidency of the College, but as hecannot give all his time to the work,it becomes necessary to draft Rev.Harris as a guiding hand at the helm.There is no one better qualified forthe responsible position.The new Guild Hall of the Versailles church will be dedicated onnext Sunday morning at eleveno clock. The services will be incharge of the Rt. Rev. Bishop LewisW. Burton, Bishop of this diocese,and Rev. J. M.

We would like to do the--seme to the business men of thistown.Arvada, Colorado, is an, examplejust now of what can be done whenpeople want to do.In some manner the impressionwas spread abroad that the businessi interests or Arvaaa am not invite an1 - overly close relation with the community at large. It injured the town.When this impression reached theears of the business men they wastedno time in vain regrets. They wantlo work Jlke men and organized a' community club it is called "TheArvada Community -Club."The object of the club is in the- main to unite the interests of thetown and the surrounding tradingterritory by .bringing all of the people into closer touch one with another.They will organize an exchange,with a competent man in charge.Farmers, gardeners, any person incountry, or town who has anythingfor-sale can list it with the ex--change and it will be disposed of for-them, without the charge of any com--mlssion. " Qnce a month a big public-auction will be held at which all articles not heretofore sold will be disposed of without expense to theseller. The sale days are to be"widely advertised in the local pressand themost experienced auctioneers obtainable will be engaged.The business men of the town are tobe urged to advertise their merchandise heavily m in the Arvada -papersand make special bargain days forthe auction sale days, and in thismanner establish a close relationship between the town and surjounding territory that will causafarmerato forget that such thing as ar -JB&U order house ever existed.y - -Now if .Arvada can do it, why can't- we?

He was aquiet, unobstcusive fellow who answered to the name of Alfred Hoskins,and when he swore softly and usedsuch unfamiliar slang as "blighter"and his superlatives were, limited to"Bully." He was a character for Jos.Conrad, this Englishman was. Heran away from -London because hedid not want to go to war. Hethought a lot of life. Any seacrificethat might take it away from himwas too much.Alfred Hoskins climed stealthilyaboard a ship and came to America.He left his?-two brothers to do thefighting for the family. He left hismother to cry and weep scaldingtears of humiliation. He left his father angry and brooding. Of course,his conscience bothered him it behaved abominably but it wouldwear itself out. A few months inAmerica and all would be all right."Two years Alfred Hoskins roamedthe American continent, but the conscience did not wear itself out. It rebuked him in Chicago, in Cleveland,in theJWest, in the East, in Akronit became unbearable. It admonished him night and day.Three months ago Alfred Hoskinsgot a job as elevator man with theB. F. Goodrich Rubber Company. Heworked nights. Everywhere in theday time, he was confronted bysoldiers, by newspaper accounts ofthe stirring deeds of his countrymen.A week ago Alfred Hoskins gave upthe struggle. He quit his job.. Heconfessed his weakness. He was going back. He was going to fight.And to-day, postmarked New York,came the message v."Passage all arranged. Enlistedwith British recruiting station inNew York.

(28-3t)To The Public!The merchants of Paris recentlysigned agreements to. close theirstores as follows: Grocery stores at7 p. m. and Saturdays 11 p. m.Other lines of business at 5 p. m., excepting Saturdays. Some of our merchants are doing all they can to liveup to their agreement, while othersfind all kind of excuses to extend thetime of closing. One of their mainexcuses has been that customers willdelay their purchases to the lastminute, and by entering stores at theclosing hour make it difficult formerchants to close their stores asagreed, upon.The Merchants Protective Association of Bourbon County at its lastmeeting directed by an unanimousvote that the undersigned make anurgent appeal to the public to kindlyassist the -merchants by making alltheir purchases so as not to conflictwith this closing arrangement.There must be reason in allthings. A business or householdconducted without order and systemcannot bring complete success. -Remembersuccess does not mean moneyalone but also means "Happiness,Haririony and Good Health."The mechanic and ordinary" daylaborer will not work over 10 or 8hours per day. This you will 'agreeis exactly right.; But why thenshould we expect a merchant towork from 6 a. m. to 10 or even 12p. m., or from 12 to 18 hours perday? "The merchant desires good health.and wants to live as long as others.He wants to enjoy the company ofhis wife and children at 'eveningduring the week as well as only onSundays. Two hours extra rest eachday means all this for him and betterservice for you on the next day. Nodoubt you believe this is right andare willing to grant him and hisclerks and porters this necessaryrest. Then why not help him to liveup to his 'pledge and make your purchases accordingly?. To those merchants who have sofar failed to close their stores ,aspromptly as they agreed", we appealagain, "For the good of all, as wellas your own welfare, let us stand together and work like one man."To those merchants who so farhave failed to fall in line on theclosing agreement, we extend anearnest appeal to "Come and work together with us.for a common cause,"and to the public we appeal for theirencouragement and co-operation inthis movement, because we believe itright.SignedFRED WECKESSER, Chairman.WM.

This is anArtistic axiom that is broken bythousands of women over 50 yearsold, and yet jt is a safe statementhy which to stand.- The straight brim, which is reminiscent of the sailor hats worn bythe Gibson girls, is usually unbecoming to every American except a certain fragile type. Once we thought it-was symbolic of the American girl,because Mr. Gibson's art led us intothat belief, but the truth is that themodern American face looks its worst- under a stiff regulation sailor.The graceful brim is the swirlingone which goes up or down, according to the features of the woman'sface.

DODSONSouth Main St.The Httm of Good Coal11 wV'&Blue Serge Walking CostumeThere are creations, marvelousgowns, furs and coats, to be seen,but about each there is a subduedelegance of good taste. Under theglaaour of these snappy days, onecan see the ever-present feeling ofthe seriousness of the war. "Wesimply can. not dress inappropriatelywhen these happy-go-lucky youngsters in khaki throng our streets andact as our escorts to places of amusement.The Battle of the Bustle- There is'a restraint about everything, from the sleeves, which arelong and tight in street costumes,.to the skirts, which are narrowerthan last year, and which promisesto be longer. There is one important question which has not as yetbeen settled. A fierce battle is waging between two fashions, for thebustle and against it. After all, itis up to the women themselves, inthe end, and only they can decidewhether a style is "to be or not tobe." Fashion authorities may launcha mode, but if the women won't wearit it dies, and something elsequickly takes its place.The Dress and the SuitAt present, indications are thatthe dress and xioat will be more popular for street wear than the coatsuit. This is a rule that is easily setside, and there will be many suitsworn this year. Indeed, it is anAmerican costume, and the Americanwomn always, feels ihat theresfrreoccasions when only a coat suitshould be worn. Mowever, dressesto be worn on the street without atxat, these first cool days, are holding the .center of the stage. Blueserge lelids, as it always does, buttricotine, gabardine and wool jersey,as well as the heavier woolen-materialsin various colors and combinations of colors, are equally smart.THe Tie-OnWaist and the StraightSkirt vThe illustration shows one of the'many clever designs for the tie-onblouse. The-surplice line is so generally becoming that I, for one, amglad to see that it continues to be afashion favorite. The panel effect inthe front, with its braiding design,is another feature. This dress wasdeveloped in blue serge, with thecollar and braiding in beige color.Atlrst glance, one' sees the simplicity of the costume, an effect gainedby the absence of trimming. Adress of this type is equally suitablefor morning and afternoon.Buttons and TasselsThe day-of the buttons seems tohave arrived to stay. They are ofevery shape and color, and in manystrongholds. Up and down the backthey travel, around the hems of inconspicious skirts, and across theshoulder and down the sleeve. Whenthey match the color of the costume, they are smart; when theyare of a contrasting shade, they aresmart; when they are round, squareor oblong, they are equally smart.Indeed, one is tempted to say thatthis fall they are the chosen insigniaof Dame Fashion.Tassels, too, and fringe come infor their share of applause. Indifferent widths and shades, they accentuate the flying drapery of thestraight silhouette.JThe New Tunic Dress.The tunic' gives such lovely longlines to the shortest figure, that onecan easily understand why it is sopopular. Then, too, the tunic dresscan so readily be made of two ma?-terials and. contrasting colors, and sopresents many possibilities for thehome dressmaker as well as for theprofessional.. The shaped tunic isvery new; the one illustrated hereshows how graceful is the effect obtained when it is longer on one sidethan the other.. Fur, longr'or shorthaired, is used a great deal on thesedresses. There is something fascin-tating about the contrast of the richfur and the simple material.
