with the greatest cast of principals,
the gretest bunch of Creole chorus

uonucement that this season the show
is all new, and kknowing that the

previously, the public may well antici
pate the coming engagement with

In many Chinese cities an expert
shirt marker who does good work can
be hired for 10 cents a day to make
shirts to measure, at least for native
customers, and he will turnout not less
than ones hirt a day, for an indefinite
period. All of which .discourages the
trade of dealers in ready-made gar
ments of even moderate cost." The
materials, of course, are of approxi
mately equal value in both cases.
Cloudy ice may be. from one-third'
to two-fifths less efficient in cooling
than transparent ice, stated M. Tab
oury at the Toulouse Congress of Cold.
It appears taht the heat absorbed in
the melting of clear ice is remarka
bly constant, and never varies more
than 5 per cent. Cloudy ice, on the
other hand, is very variable, some
times absorbing as much heat as clear
ice, though usually much less.
In Knasas City both the men and
the women who work in offices are
dissatisfied with the dress of the other
sex. A woman writes to the Kansas
City Star to complain because men re
move their coats when at work. A
man writes not in reply to this com
plaint to charge the girls who work
in his office were turning it into a
"caberet show" by their "conspicious
and immodist attire."
Tourist travel across the Pacific, in
both directions, is steadily and fast
increasing. Larger, swifter and better
steamships help to make it popular,
and interest in the Orient grows with
more knowledge of Eastern Asia and
easier access to China and Japan.
