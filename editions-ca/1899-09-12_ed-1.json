The
Cruel Knife
It is absolutely useless to expect a
awrgical operation to cure cancer or
Any other blood disease The cruelty
of such treatment is illustrated in the
Alarming number of deaths which re-

THE BOURBON NEWS PARIS Y TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 12 1899
CAUGHT IN THE TEAP
THE GREAT SMALLPOX SWINDLE AND
HOW IT WAS WORDED
A Brazen and Well Planned Scheme
by Which Two Sharp Confidence
Men Bunkoed a Hotel Keeper Oat
of 5OOU
I dare say you never heard of the
great smallpox swindle said the ho
tel manager The facts of that re
markable affair were withheld at the
time for the most urgent reasons of
policy and even uow 1 prefer to tell
the story without names or localities
It happened in the fall of 1880 when a
certain hotel in a large western city
was crowded with tourists One day
at the height of the season two gen
tiemauly looking strangers put up at
the house and were assigned to what
we call a double room About a week
later one of them appeared at the of
fice and requested a private interview
with the manager I regret to inform
you he said after the door was clos
ed that my friend Is down with a se
vere attack of smallpox
The proprietor nearly fell out of his
chair There was known to be small
pox in the city and the bare sugges
tion that the disease had appeared in
the hotel was enough to empty it In a
twinkling To let the news get out
meant the loss of thousands upon thou
sands of dollars It meant the ruin of
the seasons business He must be
quietly removed at once said the pro
prietor trying to control his agitation
Removed exclaimed the other
Taken through the cold air to a laze
retto Why man that would be mur
der Ill not permit It
The hotel keeper was thunder
struck Do you mean to say he must
stay here he gasped
Certainly said the stranger
It was a ticklish situation The hos
tel keeper dare not enforce his sugges
tion while to let the case remain was
like storing gunpowder in a furnace
room He pleaded protested begged
threatened and blustered but all in
vain The man was firm as a rock If
you attempt to eject my sick friend he
declared Ill publish your inhumanity
to the entire community
Finally it occurred to the distracted
proprietor to see first whether it was
really a case of smallpox So he sent
for a physician swore him to secrecy
and hustled him up to the room The
doctor took one look at the disfigured
face on the pillow and reported that
the malady was there In a malignant
type He advised the mans immediate
removal at any cost lf you keep him
concealed he said the disease may
spread and it would ruin you for life
You owe something to your guests
gain the proprietor Interviewed the
friend and again the latter refused to
budge from his position
Where can I take him be demand
ed You know very well 1 cant get
comfortable quarters for such a pur
pose and I wont have him butchered
In a pest house to please any landlord
on earth The hotel man felt his hair
stand on end but concluded to let
things stand as they wre until morn
ing
Next day he sent for the sick mans
friend and asked him whether he had
any suggestions to make
Yes he replied I thought up a
plan over night which you may adopt
r not as you like As I said before
he continued it Is useless to try to
rent quarters for such a case We
might however buy a small cottage
and take him there I have figured the
thing up and the total expense would
be about 5000 If you are willing to
hand over that amount I will take him
away and assume all further respon
sibility I make the offer entirely out
of sympathy for your guests
The landlord looked him in the eye
I too have thought the situation
over he said and Im convinced its
a confidence game pura and simple
Im convinced theres nothing the mat
ter with your dear friend up stairs
but 1 am also convinced that the slight
est breath of the affair weuld greatly
damage the reputation of the house
As a business proposition 1 consider it
worth 5000 to get rid of you
The other man smiled ironically
Call a cab and get out your money
he said and inside an hour the incubus
had been spirited through a side door
swathed in blankets and driven away
As the landlord shrewdly surmised
the whole thing was a confidence game
and he learned the particulars later on
through a sport he had once befriend
ed There was nothing the matter
with the rascal up stairs except that
his face had been pricked a little with
a quill dipped in eroton oil something
that makes horrtMr looking pustule
which disappears in a few days and
leaves no mark 1 always thought the
hotel man showed good sense in tak
ing the course he did He was caught
in a trap and took the cheapest way
out The bare rumor of even a sus
pected case would probably have
volved a loss of 000O or 00000 It
was far better to pay the 5000 and
charge It to educatiou New Orleans

Lincoln and the Hair Restorer
Here Is a story of President Lincoln
from the late Judge Carter who was
a member of congress from Cleveland
during the war and one of Mr Lin
colns most Intimate friends It re
lates to a Quaker philanthropist from
Philadelphia who did not have a hair
on his head but took a great interest
in public affairs and was constantly
calling at the White House in behalf
of somebody or other who happened
to be In trouble and took up a great
deal of Mr Lincolns time The presi
dent treated him with great courtesy
although his patience was frequently
tried One day when the philanthro
pist was particularly verbose and per
sistent and refused to depart although
he knew that important delegations
were waiting Mr Lincoln suddenly
rose walked over to a wardrobe in the
corner of the cabinet chamber and took
a bottle from a shelf Handing it to
his visitor he remarked
Did you ever use thi stuff on your
head
No sir I never did
Vell remarked Mr Lincoln I ad
vise you to try it and if at first you
dont succeed keep It up They say
Its a good thing to make the hair grow
Take this bottle with you and come
back in six months and tell me how It
works
The astonished philanthropist cover
ed his polished pate with his broad
brimmed hat and left the room while
Judge Carter coming in with the next
delegation found the preslaent over in
the corner doubled up with laughter
at the success of his strategy and be
fore he could proceed to business the
story had to be told Chicago Record
The Power of the Whale
If the whale knew its own power it
could easily destroy all the machinery
which the art of man could devise for
catching him It would only be neces
sary for him to swim on the surface in
a straight line ia order to break the
thickest rope but instead on being
struck by the harpoon he obeys a nat
ural instinct which in this instance
betrays him to his death
Not having an air bladder he can
sink to the lowest depths of the ocean
and mistaking the harpoon for the
teeth of a s won fish or a shark he in
stantly descends this being his man
ner of freeing himself from these ene
mies who cannot bear the pressure of
a deep ocean and from descending
and ascending in small space he thus
puts himself in the- power of the
whaler
If we include the pressure of the
atmosphere a body at the depth of 100
feet would sustain that of 60 pounds
on the square inch while one at 4000
feet a depth by no means consider
able would be exposed to a pressure of
1830 pounds We need not therefere
feel surprised that oo the foundering
of a ship at sea though Its timbers
part not a spar floats to the surface
for ir the hull has sunk to a great
depth all that is porous Is penetrated
with water or Is greatly compressed

The Tide Ram Jtvay
The- humorist had been tied hand
and foot and lashed to a ple that pro
jected a dozen or more fieet above the
water at low tide
He had dared to perpetrate an orig
inal joke and the Paragraphers Amal
gamates union had decceed his death
In vain he wriggled
The cruel waters were rtsing beneath
him The tide was coming in
Im afraid he murmured as he
looked down and noticed that the little
waves were lapping at his shoe Im
afraid that one tied will not affect the
other And be laughed harshly
Anyway he added moment later
Ill stick to my post
The tide rose faster It was at his
knee His waist his elbow his neck
Just as it readied ai chin he gave
one final glance across the sparkling
waveband muttered
Welf it seems to boup to me now
