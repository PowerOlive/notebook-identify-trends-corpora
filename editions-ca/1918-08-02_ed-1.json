maintained. In a survey recently
completed by the Goodrich National
Touring Bureau it was found that it
is possible to build roads which will
stand up under the heaviest motbr
traffic. Such roads exist to-day and
have for several years in the State
of Connecticut.
Connecticut has furnished the ex
ample for the rest of the States. She
not only has excellent highways
throughout the State, but has carried
her rockwork right to the State
lines of adjoining States, instead of
stopping the work at the last impor
tant town, as is the unfortunate
method in many States. She has
given the lie to the insidious reports
that trucks destroy highways. Con
necticut says that the right kind of
roads, properly maintained, will
withstand the hardest truck "traffic.
More than that, she has adopted the
policy of removing snow from her
highways in the winter, so that she
gets the use of them" for twelve
months of the year.

NEW AUTOS SOLD.
THE UNIVERSITY 0E E31NTUCKY
.TRAINS WOMEN IN DRAFTING
The C. S. Ball Garage, of this city,
made the following sales this week
of Buick autos to Paris and Bour
bon county people: John Woodford,
seven-passenger; Lou Taylor, seven
passenger; Sol Redmon, five-passenger,
Noah Gray, five-passenger; Miss
Grace Hargis, flve-passenger; Tollie
Young, flve-passenger; Rev. George
R. Combs, flve-passenger.
On account of the urgent need for
draftsmen in the large industrial
plants of the United States, because
of the large number of men filling
these positions answering the call to
the colors, the course in drafting for
women at the University of Kentucky
will be made continuous, it has been
announced at Lexington.
A young woman may enter the
three months'" course at any time,
and if. she has shown proficiency will
be given a position at once. The
draftsman course is thought to offer
the best opportunity of any work
open to women. It is pointed out by
those in charge of the course that it
not only fits them to fill a man's
place, but it gives them an opportu
nity to get into work that is elevat
ing and throw them in contact with
the best workers. Twenty young
women -who entered the first drafts
man class will complete their work
on September 17,and already, the
College of Mechanical and Electrical
Engineering has received more re
quests than there are mejmbers of
the class.
The valuation department of the
Illinois Central Railroad has sent in
a request for women who have taken
the draftsman course; the Western
Electric Company has asked for ten,
and the American Socety of Mechani
cal Engineers, at whose request the
course was instituted at the Univer
sity, has agreed to place twenty.
These positions pay from ?75to$100
a month to start.
FOOD ADMINISTRATION MAKES
ANOTHER SLIGHT CONCESSION
Another step toward partial re
sumption by the nation of its old
habit of eating has been taken by
the Food Adminstration in releasing
housewives from voluntary pledges
to curtail the consupiption of wheat.
This follows closely the release of
hotels, restaurants, clubs and dining
car services from their privileges,
becoming effective yesterday.
, No change has been made, the
Food Administration announced, in
the half-and-half rule, and purchas
ing of wheat flour will require the
purchase of an equal weight of
wheat substitutes. Bakers still are
required to make "victory" bread,
containing at least 2 5 per cent wheat
substitutes. Coming in of the new
wheat crop has made it possible for
the release of the voluntary wheat
savings, the food administration said.

on Eighth street, died at the Massie
Memorial Hospital, in this city, Tues
day night, from the after-effects of
an operation performed for appendi
citis. Young Burley had been ill but
a few days, and was taken, to the
Hospital after symptoms of appendi
citis "manifested themselves'. The op
eration was deemed necessary, and
was performed early last Friday af
ternoon. The patient stood the ordeal
very bravely and was thought to be
doing well until late Tuesday after
noon, when a relapse set in, from
which he did not rally, death ensuing
in the night.
Young Burley had been for a long
time on the carrier force of THE
NEWS and .the Lexington Herald,
and faithfully served a large number
of' patrons over an extended terri
tory. He was a member of the Boy
Scouts and. the Liberty Drum and-1
Bugle ..Corps, and was highly regard
ed by his comrades. He is survived
by his father, Mr Arthur Burley,
one sister, Miss Emma Louise Bur
ley, and his grandparents, Mr. and
Mrs. Wr W. Burley, who now reside
in Wyandotte, Mich.
Thetunerkr was, "eld rifrom the
residence onx Eighth street; --yester-;
A new brand of German
ganda has come to light.
It is directed against the automo
bile industry. A number of alarm
ing and malicious stories have
broken loose simultaneously in a
dozen or more of the large cities.
The purpose of all of them has been
the sajme, and that is to alarm the
motoring public as to the future of
the motor car.
One story that has been industri
ously circulated was that there would
be serious shortage of tires as a re
sult of the embargo on crude rub
ber. That this report is unfounded
is proved by the following informa
tion offered "by the B. F. Goodrich
Rubber Company, backed up by
Great Britain. Uncle Sam has
promised the rubber trade in America
100,000 tons of "overseas" rubber
this year. Last year American man
ufacturers used 57,000 tons above
100,000. It is estimited the re-,
serve stock on hand in America, the
first of the year amounted to- 80,-
000 tons, so added to the 100,000
tons guaranteed her, America is re
ally better fixed now than last year.
Another Hun lie was to the effect
that, beginning July 1, to save-gasoline
the Government would order
the discontinuance of passenger cars
on Sunday for a period of twelve
continuous Sundays. There .is no
shortage of -gasoline yet in this
country, and .the Government jso far
as we know is not contemplating any
action of an alarming nature-along
this line.
Probably the most harmful prop
aganda now in circulation is: 'JKeep
the heavy trucks off the highways;
they are destroying them." . This
story spread so quickly and so
wjldely in one Eastern State that the
State Legislature actually almost
passed a fclaw forbidding -heavy
trucks on its highways, andjprob
ibly would have done so but for the
vigilance of motor truck owners.
To say that roads are bad because
motor trucks have T)een passing over
them is simply a confession that -the
roads are not properly" built and
