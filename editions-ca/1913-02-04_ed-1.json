Siudebaker Cars Combine Real
Luxury With Low Cost.
Ehose who see the "35" for'the first
time generally ask the price twice or
thrice.
Your first thought when you sen the
Studebaker "35" will probably be that
you have been shown the "six" by
mistake.
A six passenger Studebaker car uf
splendid proportions, electrically light
ed and started, sunerbly rushioned and
tired and trimmed at $1200 it seems
incredible.
Every Studebaker store has arleady
heard the same query reDeated a hun
dred times "Did you say the price
was $1200"
And even the nnce of the Studeba
ker "Six" $1550 -will not express
vour enthusiastic imDression of the
value of the "35."
Instinctively and inevitably you will
make comparisons from a 2000 angle.
And the Bourbon Garage is quite
willinc that you should inspect the
"35" through S2000 lenses.
It accepts the responsibility of a
comparison so trying and will gladly
abide by the result.
It mvitesjthe 2000 buyer to descend
to $12n0 without any loss of satisfac
tion or in results.

Considerable excitement has pre
vailed here for the past few days after
it became generally known that Mr. C.
B. Bastin had been asked to resign as
local manager of the Bourbon Home
Telephone Co. This came in the na
ture of a surprise to the many sub
scribers of the company since it was
generally believed tnat Mr. Bastin
had given satisfaction with the com
pany as he had with his patrons. Mr.
Bastin had been connected with the
local office since the first of October
and has given better satisfaction than
any previous manager For the past
year there has been considerable
trouble to maintain a manager here
and aftpr Mr. Bastin had demonstrat
ed his ability along the line of this
kind of work it was hoped by the
patrons that a local manager had been
found that would make something of
the local business.! It is said the office
at Paris has been rutting down the
number of employes in the exchange.
For the past month .they have had but
two operators here", the twenty-four
nours in the day being divided between
these two ladies. Subscribers have
realized that the work of 4local man
ager and operators have been very
much handicapped by a lack of help.
Saturday Mr. English was sent here
to relieve Mr. Bastin. Mr. Bastin has
a number of friends who regret this
move on thejpart of thetelephone com
pany and a petition is "in circulation
which will be presented to the general
office asking that Mr. Bastin be re
tained. The petition was started in circula
tion yesterday morning and a large t
number of signatures have been placed
to the list. It is said that late last
night 140 names had been secured.
The Millersburg people are very indig
nant over the action of the telephone
officials in removing Bastin and unless
he is reinstated subscribers of the
company will order their telephone
service discontinued.
! Since the above wasjput in type it
has developed the companv has acced
ed to the wishes of the subscribers
and reinstated Mr. Bastin. After
the petition was circulated tit became
apparent the people of this place
meant business and the officials of the
company guarding their interests
argeed to their demands.
STOCK, CROP AND FARM NOTES
Mr. Jeff Davis Grover, of Scott
county, has sold his farm on the
Paynes Depot pike to Mr. N. F. Arm
strong for 250 an acre.
THEATRICAL.
The coming of Aborn's mammoth
spectacular production of "The Bohe
mian Girl" in English, to the Paris
Grand on Thursday, February 6, should
prove among the most important of
the season's offerings. Halfe's mas
terpiece will be Dresentedjn a lavish
stage environment that is'said to rival
any of the many productions given to
this opera in its seventy years of pop
ularity. The magnificence of the
Aborn version combined with he
wealth of detail ne'er before attempt
ed have caused many to wonder how it
was ever possible tojiave given a com
pletely satisfying performance of this
grand old opera without the introduc
tion of at least some of the ideas that
haveAnow been incorporated. , To the
opera has been given a scenic mount
ing comprised of. six massive and
magnificent scenes, and in this partic
ular, widely different from the make
shift scenery that has usually been
emDloyedby traveling comDanies Dre
senting Balfe's work. Among "the
features heretofore not known to this
opera are a cavalcade or norses that
are shown in a wild race up the mount
ains in pursuit of the kidnapping gyp
sy chief, an encampment of Gpysies
who are seen making and breaking
camp, with its genuine gypsies, .dogs!
geese, pigs, chickens, etc. These and
a multitude of otner novelties com
bine to make the Aborn version of
"The Bohemian Girl" an offering of
exceptional importance. The present
ing company, one of importance and
unusual size, includes a double cast of
principals, big chorus and a special or
chestra. The most important of those corn
pricing the cast are Helena Morrill, a
prima donna discovery made by the
Aborns during their Boston engage
ment last spring.
Blanche Rio it Ltxinf ton.
Stamped with the approval of Nw
York, Chicago, and the larger cilie
of the country, "The Wall Strett Girl"
is again Blanche Ring's starring ve
hicle this season, and this popular
comedienne will be seen in this great
est of her. successes at the Lexington
Opera House Monday, February 10.
When it comes to singing songs,
there is only one Blanche Ring. la
"The Wall Street Girl" there are
fully a dozen tuneful numbers and half
of them fall to Miss Ring; among -them
being "Deedle Dum Dee." "I
Want a Regular Man," "I Should Have
Been Born alBoy," and'Whistle It."
Miss Ring has surrounded herself with
a chorus of stunning girls, who assist
materially in making the songs worth
while.
Margaret Mayo and Edgar Selwyn
are the co-authors of "The Wall Street
Girl," while Hapgood Burt i respon
sible for the lyrics. The music is by
the late Karl Hoschna and various
others. The piece is in three acts-and
irrespective of the music and songs
would make an interesting play.
James Greene, a Wajl street broker,
disappointed in not" having a son.
brings uphis daughter, Jemima, in a
mannish fashion. Her interest cent
ers in a business career until she
meets Dexter Barton from Nevada.
Then she throws her masculine train
ing to the winds and adonts all tha -fluffs
and flounces so dear to the hearts
of most women.
Barton has a gold mining pronosition
to sell arid when this is turned down
by Greene, Jemima takes a hand and
bays a half interest. How the gold
mine saves Greene from financial fail
ure and how Jemima falls in love with
her mining partner are cleverly worked
out by the cu-authors.
Featured with Miss Ring is Will
Rogers, whose lariat throwing and
qu?ir.t humor touched New York and
Chicago's funny bone. Among the .
other principals are William P. Carle
ton, Paul Porter, Charles Winninger,
Elmer Thomason, George Gaston,
Kate Wingfield, Lillian Spencer and
Alice Sullivan.
