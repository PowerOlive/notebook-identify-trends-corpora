The Gvy And Festive Floater -
MC
An exchange prints the following
timely lines
Behold the day of election draweth
nigh when the gay and festive floater
is seen in all his glory Even now he
acenteth the flesh pots from afar off and
nioveth in the direction thereof He
seeketh ont a candidate here and a can
didate there and he telleth each of mnch
work that needeth to be done The
candidate taketh him to one side and
the palm of his hand is greased and the
floater floateth to another candidate
and telleth him of a bunch he can
handle or a nest he can fix He
plncketh the coin from the hand of his
boss and in his heart saith All men are
fools He leaveth town and in the
pocket of his tronsers is concealed the
money of rival candidates He fooleth
them all for on election day he walketh
into the booth andstampeth in the place
of his own choice and no man is any
the wiser

C F Clay is a horse of great finish and style in fact as much so as any horse
we know of Is a beautiful mahogany bay with black points and stands 153i
hands high His pedigree is full of the richest producing blood which has year after
year added new and brilliant performers to the turf for instance Nannie Etti
coat out of his dam has given in 1896 Red Silk 210 and Brown Silk 219 the lat
ter the dam of China Silk two-year-old record 216 beyond question the best
two-year-old filly of 1896 As a two three and five-year-old C F Clay was cam
paigned and landed many good races securing his record of 218 His first crop
of foals came in his form and for several years afterward he was the
leading sire when age of foals was considered His get all possess his grand in
dividuality and are especially speedy and as to race horse qualities the perfor
mances of Coleridge 205 Choral 208 Connor 211 Arthur W 211 and others
are too recent and of too much merit to need any comment But few better sires
than C F Clay are now in the stud His colts are not only trotters but are show
horses as well having probably been awarded as many premiums at the leading
fairs as the get of any horse in Kentucky C F Clay will make the season of 1897
