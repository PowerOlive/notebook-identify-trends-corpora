Mr. I. F . Chanslor, aged 68. fdied
suddenly at his home on the Mayeville
pike, one-half mile south of town, Sat
urday afternoon at i.5 :30 o'clock. Mr.
Chanslor was apparently in good
health and had attended to his farm
duties all during the day. On Friday
evening he ate a light suDper and Sat
urday he complained of feeling badly.
At noon, however, he ate a hearty din
ner. In the afternoon his daughter.
Miss Florence, came to town, going
to the farailv n lysician, Dr. Huffman,
procured medicine for him, which,
however,.was not to be taken until
bedtime.
After Mr. Chanslor had done his eve
ning farm work, he went to the house
and as supper was not ready, lay down
on the couch in his room. A little
later one of his daughterswent to him
and found him heavily asleep. She
made a slight unsuccessful attempt to
arouse him, but failing to do so, was
not particlarly alarmed. A little later
two of thedaughtersjwcr seated on the
veranda, he was hetrJ, as they
thought, to sneeze, and one of them
went to him and found him dead.
The family phvsician, Dr. Huffman,
was hastily summoned. Mr. Chanslor
has been subject to attacks of indiges
tion for several years, but recently
these attacks were less frequent and
his general condition was thought to
be much improved.
He was a native of Mason countv.
and one of a large family, being born
near Sardis. Early in life he was
united in marriace to Miss Jane Rach
ael Reese and began life as a farmer
near Shannon. For a time he was an
extensive dealer in tobacco and hogs.
In 1838 he sold his Mason county farm
to Mr. H. D. Watson and purchased
the Robert McClellan farm near Mil
lersburg. Since coming to Bourbon he has con
finedjhis attentions almost entirely to
farming and gardening. He was the
j father of eight children, six daugh
ters, Mesdames Frank Armstrong.

Garth Fund Beneficiaries.
The Garth Fund Commissioners,
composed of Messrs. John T. Collins,
of North Middletown. and Claude M .
Thomas and Emmett M. Dickson, of
Paris, submitted their report to the
Fiscal Court, Thursday.
In their report the Commissioners
state that thevhave carefully examined
the old beneficiaries who applied for j
assistance from the fund, as well as a
number of new applicants.
In commenting on the work accom
plished be the applicants the report
says that several of the boys have
made excellent progress, while some
are apparently not appreciative of the )
opportunity given them. The report
states that these boys have been notified
by the Commissioners that they must
make commendable progress the coming
year or they will not again be assisted.
The Commissioners state that in the
future the number of beneficiaries will
be reduced, and that larger amounts
will be paid those who are worthy, and
who appreciate the advantages extended
to them. These boys will be chosen
strictly by the grade attained upon
examination, and by their reports from
the schools attended during the previous
year.
The report further states that in the
opinionof the Commissioners, that of
the entire number of applicants for the
Garth Fund during each year, only
eight or ten in the long run prove
worthy, and they say that on that ac
count the number of new applicants
accepted annually should be reduced
largely, and a larger sum of money
appropriated to the hard working and
worthy applicants.
The Commissioners selected twenty
three old beneficiaries for the coming
year, appropriating the sum of $1,685
for their use, while the new applicants
number eleven, who were appropriated
the sum of $310, making a total of
thirty-four young men being educated
by the Garth Fund, entailing an expense
in the sum of $1,995.
The following is the list of benefici
aries, of the past year who have been
continued for the coming year, and the
new beneficiaries, together with the
amount of money apportioned to each,

CURIOUS BITS
OF HISTORY
A DUMPING GROUND FOR
. JAIL-BIRDS.
-c By A. W. MACY. "x
Prior to the revolution Eng
land used the American colo
nies as a dumping-ground for
her undesirable citizens. It Is
estimated that between 1717 and
1775 not less than 50,000 con
victs, of all kinds and of both
sexes, were taken from the jails
of Great Britain and Ireland and
transported to the American
colonies, where they were con
demned to hard labor and hired
out to the settlers. The Mary
land colony suffered most from
the affliction, 20,000 or more of
the jail-birds being sent there.
Some of them, however, had
been convicted of slight offenses,
and were) easily transformed in
to good , citizens of the new
world.
