Talbott & Whitley, attorneys for the Paris Gas & ElectricCompany, in which they stated verypositively and definitely that unlessan understanding was reached before next Saturday between the cityand their clients the city would,findthe street lighting current cut off. Aproposition was submitted some timeago for the settlement of 'the matter,and the terms it gave would give thepeople of this city a much lower ratethan has ever been offered before tothe city and the private consumersof current. In fact, it would be muchlower than they have ever enjoyedAna an tms, too, is in view oi mefact that the cost of production hasbeen incrase'd, the cost of living andthe cost of material, coal, etc., verymuch higher. A majority of themembers of the Light Committee,and also a majority of the Paris CityCouncil are in favor of accepting thesettlement and the new rate as embraced in the proposition submitted.while one of the Light Committeewas in favor of holding out furtherfor better terms. The Mayor andMr. Weiss, the Consulting Engineerfor the city, were also in favor ofholding out for a better understanding and better terms. The opposing members of the Light Committeeand the Council may yet be broughtto see the other side of the matterand stand solidly with us in favor ofsecuring a speedy settlement of thematter.

In comparing water-powerwith, other natural resources, the report says: Conservation of everyofcher natural resource means restrict'rzi; .invit. own use, for use meanso sumption, and permanent destruction. Every pound of coal burned isforever withdrawn from use. On theother hand every horse-power notused is lost, and horse-power conrserved and used saves not only thehorjse-power, but its equivalent incoal and may incidently improvenavigation."Engineers of high standing havetold Congress that the passage of aproper water-power development lawwould result in piQneer industrial activities in twenty-five States. Senator . Jones made the statement thathese hydroelectric developments inth- West would have "an ultimateaggregate capacity of about 2,000,OVo horse-power, requiring an investment of $250,000,000." He furthestated that the industrial plantserected to use this vast amount ofpower wiuld give permanent employment to 500,000 operatives.It Might Have Been.; ?i3he was a good wife 'to me.

The old hen pays therooster's board, she buys the gas torun. the Ford; she even, buys the oldman's cud, and still he meets herwith a thud, if in the feedbox sheshould stray, or roost upon his newmown hay. She buys the soap toclean the kids, the sugar and thefamily lids. She's up the first one inthe morning, she's out and hustlingin the corn, before the old manchucks his snores to call the boys todo the chores. She's always happyat her work; no one can say thatshe's a shirk. She don't belong to anyclub, belives in paying for her grub.She does not work and doesn't carehow others comb.or curl their hair.She lives to serve and serves to live,gets all she can, is free to give ofwhat the good Lord gives her.

Commissioner of Immigration Caminettisays that 6,000 of these are to beshipped back to Europe at once. Itappears likely, from official information, that this will be but the beginning of a clean-up in the interestof America for Americans.But what does Bolshevism mean?Why it is so bitterly attacked andso little explained? And when theexplanation is 'finally made, it is theRussian Bolshevist theory that ishanded out to us by red-eyed agitators of the anarchist type, who beingunable to furnish sensible opinionsabout the American form of government, are -never relied upon by intelligent people as authorities on the affairs of countries as far removed asRussia. Bolshevism, generallyspeaking, is an. European evil, thatrepresents discontent, and is a factorthat breeds wars. We will not attempt to analyze European Bolshevism here. But there is an easy answer to the question: What is Bolshevism in America, and the peopleof this country should hasten to acquaint themselves as to the meaningof this strange doctrine.Senator Nelson, of Minnesota, hasdone a good service by inserting inthe Congressional Record the aims ofBolshevists in the United States asproclaimed by their leaders in thiscountry. The statements should bemade into an official document" andcirculated everywhere. The publication from which the material is collected, is called "Hunger The International Revolution." This publication purports to stand for a lot ofthings that no intelligent personwants, and it promises that "theshams of the present system may bepresented and subjected to analysis."It is printed in Minneapolis, a city inwhich there is no "hunger," but almost every paragraph glares withthe lie that all people who work are"hungry" and oppressed by the capitalistic class.American Bolshevism is an insidious and rabid form of class hatred;ft is anarchism under a new namethat seeks respectability by attaching itself to European "isms." It isSocialism with the brains picked out.it is not much difference from thelI. W. W. only if such a thing bepossible, it hns less sense. It is athing that should be understoodthoroughly in the United States, because it needs only to be understoodto become 'an outlaw among intelligent and respectable people of everyclass.The documents which Senator Nelson has produced weave together themost unchristianlike, debased theories, that could be collected. Thei whole underlying purpose is to create clamor and build up class hatred.Government is nothing, except to bedestroyed. Not even a substitute isoffered. The whole doctrine is untrue to anything that can be classedas modern civilization. It is verydoubtful whether Bolshevism in theUnited States is up to the standardsof Russia, or Germany. It is Europeanism in the days of the FrenchRevolution. This Bolshevism isnothing that need be feared in theUnited States. It needs to be understood. The light would destroyit. The people may be trusted tosee that it is properly taken care of.o, CATARRH CANNOT BE CUREDWith local amplications, as theycannot reach the seat of the disease.Catarrh is a local disease,' greatly influenced by constitutional conditions,and in order to cure it you must takean internal remedy.

Some of the means to this endnow under official consideration areearly maturity, higher interest andexemption from taxation.But there is one considerationwhich weighs more with the smallbuyer than all these, and that is thestabilization of the securities at ornear their par value. The small buyer exchanges his savings or pledgeshis wages for duds. But if a squallshould strike him he must converthis bonds into cash. The smaller,therefore, the hiatus between theface and the market value of thebond the more attractive it is to him.Whether this stabilization is possible is another question. The shortmaturity may effect it. If there isany promise of this, the small buyerwill come forward more readily.D0.Y0U SLEEP WELL?To be at his best a man must havesound, refreshing sleep.
