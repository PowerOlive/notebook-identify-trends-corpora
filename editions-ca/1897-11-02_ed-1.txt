soonevoked an outburst of applause whichcould not be repressed Dr McGlynnsaid in partThe place where we meet here this afternoon is not one dedicated to religion or to theservice of God but has generally been used forpurposes of recreation or amusement or of artIt has to day been made sacred and we meethere upon holy ground and stand ashened in thepresence of a message directed to us from thethrone of God It is no ordinary messageThat messenger of death has been brought toour hearts that which has immeasurablyshocked usWe stand upon ground that is made sacredby the remains of a man who was raised fromamong us by our father in Heaven to spreadthe messages of truth and righteousness andjustice and peace to alL tHo died in a struggle for the cause of humanity especially that of New

name was HenryGeorgeHenry Georges gentle heart was ready tobreak because he saw that nothing came fromthe professors of the schools of politicaleconomy which could improve the condition of thopeople because the limits of the knowledge ofthose economists was hardly to be consideredwithin the bounds of science at allTruly it was designed by providence to raiseup such a man before the world to expose thefallacy and the injustice of their reasoningWherever word has gone that Henry Georgeis dead his teachings live and his voice isheard though he lies still in death His workshave been read

they say aboutI didnt catch it all sir but the detective mentioned the stain on yourhand and said it no doubt came fromthe sheet or from the curtain betweenthe rooms He said your explanationsatisfied him and that he did not believe a guilty man would wait dor thepolice to come before he washed hisbands and then do it right before emIt seems to me at would be foolish tomix you up in it sir even if you didknow about the willWill What will are you talkingabout asked Whidby abruptlyWhy masters will sir They mustV opened his desk an got into his private papers for they said there was awill makin

at theclub but that you had laughed at thereport They seemed to have foundsome of the young ladys letters withmasters papers and they appeared topoint that wayT think I did deny the report atfirst said Whidby thoughtfully butI confess I had just begun to think myuncle was in love She is a wormyyoung woman but much too youngfor him and was influenced by hiswealth Perhaps you had better gond speak to the undertaker I supposethey will want to put up the coffin inhere I shall go upstairs and occupythe front room I dont feel like goingout my head aches and I dont seemito have my wits about me I could notrest in my old room with the undertakerin the otherCHAPTER IIIAs Whidby ascended the stairs inthe hall Matthews admitted one of the-undertakers and his assistants andshowed them into Strongs roomWhidby went into the bedroom aboveclosed the door threw himself on alounge and shut his eyes In a few minutes he began to feel less nervous Arestful -sensation stole over him and heelt sleepy Suddenly his mind reverted to what seemed a vague dream ofthe night before Was it a dream orcould it have been reality He sprangup quivering all over with excitementbut the more he tnougni 01 11- iui mwua 1the memory evaded him tin in aesperamn h sat down on the lounge andburied his face in his hands Just thenhe heard a step in the hall and some one-rapped on his doorHe rose and went to the door H wasMatthews--sa -i v-VCol Warrenton is dowstairs sir andvants to see youSend him up here said Whidby Idont care to go downIn a moment Col Warrenton enteredHe was a short middle aged man witha red face and iron gray hair He puthis silk hat on a table and gave Whidbyhis handI was dumfounded by the news hesaid We are such good friends thatI waived all ceremony and came rightroundIm glad you did old man returnedWhidby Sit down and excuse me ifI am not entertaining The truth is Iam badly broken up over this affairSomething is wrong with me I am notmyself at allThe visitors glance wandered aimlessly about the room in the silence thatfollowed Whidbys remark Then thecolonel saidYou need not tell me anything Ihave heard all about it from CaptWelsh He and I have been intimatefriends for years You have not askedfor nry advice but I love you like abrother and I dont want to see you runyour head into trouble for the lack of alawyers opinionWhy do I need legal advice askedWhidby nervously In what way Idont understandThe lawyer drew his chair nearer tothe young man who was seated on thelounge and laid his hand on his kneeOf course it is absurd to think of iyour being concerned in Strongs deathAlfred he began but I am obligedthrough the force of habit to look atsuch affairs from a professional standpoint I know you are innocent butinnocent men have been hanged beforethis and I have seen men put on trialfor murder with less circumstantialevidence against them than there isagainst youWhidby brushed back his disheveledhair with a quivering hand and staredat his friendYou mean that I may yet be accusedIt all depends on Hendricks thecolonel interrupted He is the brightest man in his line in the world If hegets on the track of the real criminalyou are all right and not a soul willaccuse you but if his investigationsshould be confined to this house it mightgrow very unpleasant for you Itstruck me that this view of the casemight not occur to you and that is thereason I am here You see it is wellthat I came of my own accord for ifyou had sent for me it might have anugly lookThe young man rose and began towalk to and fro across the room I amvery much obliged he sighed Inever dreamed of being suspected Matthews said that after I left the roomduring the inquest something wasbrought up about the blood stain on myhand and uncles will but that did nottrouble me- Col Warrentons glance followed hisfriends form backhand forth fora ni6jment then he saidPardon me my boy but do you really know if you got the blood on yourhand from the sheet or from the portiere Is your memory clear on thatpointNo I did not notice it till I startedto wash my hands In fact the detective called my attention to it I musthave been very much excited or I wouldhave noticed a thing like that but oldman my head is in such a whirl thatI do not know what I am saying Ioverslept and feel as if I had beendrugged Besides Whidby stoppedat the colonels side and put his hand onhis shoulder besides to tell the truthsomething has come into my mind sinceI have been in this room something Idid not remember at the inquest Perhaps I ought to tell the police about itsince I did not think of it when testifying As I was lying down just before you came up something flashedinto ray mind like a dream I seemed torecall walking about my room and being half walced by stumbling over achair near my bed I caught the chairto steady myself and half rememberthat my shirt which I had thrown onthe chair when I went to bed fell on thefloor It seems to me that I picked upthe shirt and replaced it and then wentback to bed I know the shirt was onthe chair when I waked this morningbut I cant imagine what I was doing upin the nightAh that is indeed curious said thelawyer thoughtfully Can you remember passing the portiere or touching it with your handXo I have told you all 1 rememberWas the chair between the portiereand your bedYesWas the back or the front part ofthe chair towards the portiereThe backYou are sure of thatYes it is quite clear to me thoughI cant explain why that I ran againstthe back of the chairThen you were undoubtedly comingfrom the direction of the portiere andgoing towards your bedIt seems soDo you walk in your sleepNot now at least not to nry knowledge I used to do it when I was a boyAt that time were you ever conscious afterwards of having done so TYes I would sometimes get lost inmy room and be unable to find my wayback to bed till I wakedThat showed you had a habit ofwalking about and unconsciously returning to bed It was only whensomething half roused you that youwere unable to act for yourself ColWarrenton reflected for a momentthen he said Look here Alfred Iwant to give you some advice You havetruthfully testified on oath as to whathappened last night to the best of yourmemory at the time you were questioned This little circumstance hassjiuce come into your mind Now myadvice to you is to keep this to

our more important American embassies for the collection of information of interest toAmerican farmersThe secretary recommends an increase in the appropriations in aid ofthe- bureau of animal industry of theweather bureau and publication officesHe thinks the department should beenabled to place the result of important operations at agricultural collegesbefore the entire country so that thefarmers of each state may get the resultof the good work done in other statesHe refers to the efforts of the department to aid the foreign markets for ourdairy and live stock products whichhe thinks can be done by making theforeigners familiar with them Instead of sending abroad for seeds hesays the policy in the future will be toencourage the introduction of suchseeds as will enable our people to

have a heavy and profitable export trade in cattle and mayhave an export trade equally heavyand profitable in horses The department is gathering facts regarding ourhorse industry at home and the requirements of purchasers abroad sothat our farmers can learn what foreign buyers demandThe most important work in whichthe animal industry bureau has beenengaged is that looking to the destruction

H HitchcockChief of the Section of MarketsWashington Nov 1 SecretaryWilson of the department of agriculture has issued a report prepared under his direction by Frank H Hitchcock chief the section of foreign markets that gives some interesting factsrelative to the present wheat shortagein Austria Hungary and the consequentimportation into that country of American grain According to the UnitedStates consul at Reichenberg Austriaan importation of 400 carloads ofAmerican wheat was made as earlyas August coming by way of HamburgOther importations were reportedamong them one of 36700 bushels ofred winter No 3 and Kansas wheatpurchased through the Vienna produceexchange After recounting these unusual importations of the present season the bulletin presents a carefulreview of the grain situation inAustria Hungary during the past tenversify their crops and keep money athome that is now sent abroad to buy I years The croPs ff the4 t rTi c4 i 11 i season are remarkablv small If theMr Wilson department will official estimates quoted are fulfilledtne comDinea wneau proaucuon 01Austria and Hungary will amount tolittle more than 130000000 bushels or60000000 bushels short of the cropharvested in 1896 which was estimatedat about 190000000 bushels Asidefrom the abnormal conditions of thepresent year annual statistics of production importation and exportation during the decade makeit apparent that a markedchange has occurred in the last fewyears as regards the grain situation inAustria Hungary The tendency ofthe various cereals has been towards alarger home consumption of the national product and consequent reduction of the surplus available for shipment to other lands Most of thecereals are now brought into thecountry in larger quantities than theyare exported Barley is the onlygrain of which any considerableamount continues to be shippedabroad In respect to other cerealsthe status of the monarchy is apparcn tly that of transition from an exportinginto an importing country While itis hardly to be expected that thesechanged conditions will to any considerable extent create an enlargeddemand for American cereals thefacts set forth are certainlyof interest as indicating the lessenedimportance of Austria Hungary amongthe countries with which the UnitedStates is obliged to compete in thegrain marts of the world The flourtrade with Brazil is large

tree-Elizabeth Akers In Youths CompanionJ JI M GflTGflE WGflTIT IS hardly to be doubted that themost heartily despised set of persons on the face of the earth are the dogcatchersThe oldest man now living- cannot remember the daj when he heard a kindly word uttered in behalf of thesnarersof vagabond canines It is an articleof faith in some localities and amongcertain people that Ishmael owed hisunpopularity and utter isolation to thepresumed fact that he was unwiseenough to hire out as a garnerer of surplus dogsJust now the Chicago dog catchersare experiencing their regular fall carmival of assault and imttery and thepeople whose pets they lure or dragjaway are offering up their ancient andtime honored testimony which is to theeffect that most wire wielders arethieves who go on private property tosteal good and valuable dogs while utterly ignoring the measley curs whichire alleged to throng the streets without hindranceIt is the same story which is told ofdog catchers in all worlds and at alltimes Ajid unfortunately in manycases it turns out to be the truth forthe men on the iig wagon have a shrewdidea of the great profit arising out ofthe harvesting of high class dogs andholding them for ransom There was ar man of that Mnd once in Councili Bluffs la hut he was discouraged outof the business His name was Whimpie and he has reduced the dog traffic to a science He naid verv little at-tention to the untagged vagrants of thecanine species but give him a goodchance at some good mans St Bernardor foxhound and he would climb electric light towers and get his wire nooseover the head of the quarry He wasclever about it too and although theowners of good dogs hired detectivesto watch him with a hope of gettinga criminal case against him he alwayssucceeded in eluding the sharp eyes ofthe sleuths and would indeed by careful maneuvering even while closelypursued slip around into a back yardloose a fine hunting spaniel from hiskennel and entice it out into the alleywhere with the support and backingof the law he would clap his noose overthe beasts head Valuable dogs hadthe fondest passion for losing theirtags about 15 minutes before Whimpies arrival in the neighborhood Theexplanation of the phenomenon wasnever clearly given but at any rateWhimple succeeded in finding morejood dogs without their passports thanfcny other dog catcher who ever lived inthat city And once caught it costquite a neat bit of money to ransomsuch a victim3ill Boyer a printer and a statesmanwas a dog fancier who for six wearyyears suffered at Whimples hands Hewhipped the man thrice but as the dogcatcher was always able to make a fairshowing that he had been inside thelines of the law the fines imposed uponBoyer amounted to more than thebribes which he was obliged to payWhimple for the release of his impoundi edpets Boyer at last worked the thingdown to a system One year he wouldwhip Whimple and pay a fine of 2230and the next he would igivej tfre dogcatcher the amount of his claim for thecatching of his dogs usually about20 The former course cost more butBoyer calculated that he got at least340 worth of satisfaction out of break-ing Whimples visage The printingman would regularly pay the city fory his dog licenses but as regularly thetags would disappear in somerious manner and Whimple would getaction3uyei iii last ueuiuea -to take extreme measures

prepared dog iottiand -waiting for the opening1 of the dogcatching season he set about perfecting his plans By the time Whimple waidue to go on his rounds all was readyand Boyer took his dog out and set itdown on a rubber mat on the frontporch This was at night and early thenext morning the despised Whimplesneaking along inBoyers neighborhoodfor he always made for the home ofthe dog fancier on the first day of hisresumption of business caught sightof the spaniel in the early morning semilightThats Dodger he murmured tohimself Boyerll pay ten dollars outof hand to get him back once I catchhim And he looked carefully abouito see if he was observedIll get him quick an take the tagoff him before he can give a yelp saidWhimple softly an then Ill be readyto swear he was runnin around outhere barkin at me as I was goin byWhimple as has been said saw thedog But alas there was an invisiblething of which he took no cognizanceAnd -that invisible thing was the heavycopper wire which ran from the trolleyline over to Boyers house and downalongside the porch whereon Dodgerlay waiting for the door to open Andif the man had seen it do you think hewould have stopped to calculate thatthe dog was loaded with enough electricity to keep 16 trains plyingbetween Omaha and Council Bluffsthat the beasts life and vitality camenot from a collection of sesamoids andtemporals and livers and lights butfrom a lot of 20 ton wheels in a powerhouse two miles away HardlyCertainly he thought nothing of thekind But standing on the well wateredlawn of Bill Boyer and oh how carefully the man of types and stumpspeeches had sprinkled that lawn onthe night before he poised his wirenoose for action and leaning over therail slipped it about the dogs upliftedhead and gave a quick jerk the purposeof which was to choke his prey into immediate silenceThe school books used to say that Ua man lived on the planet Neptunehewould be able to jump over the Washington monument or thereaboutsFor a moment Whimple seemed to believe that his home -was in Neptuneand that he wanted to get back thereright away He gave one leap aloft andturned a few dozen times like a sort ofa day fireworks brand of pin wheelHe alighted on the back of his neckwhen he came down but being acourageous sort of villain in someways and believing that the dog wasstronger than he ever calculated upon hehung grimly to the

carts and bread carts aredrawn by dogs The carts are madelike an American handcart with twoheavy wheels about as heavy as thefront wheels of a narrow tired American wagon The dogs are sometimeshitched in front of the cart and sometimes under the cart When there arebut one or two they are hitched sothat they walk right under the bedand between the wheels Often the axleof the cart has an arch in it so that thedogs walk right in the arch The dogsusually wear good leather collars madeIn a harness shop and the traces arePEDDLING MILK IN BELGIUMfastened to the legs or the body of thecartThe picture

sittingupon the cart with a half dozen cansin the back of the bed and going alongthe streetThey have another very commonmethod of doing work on their farmsthat we rarely see in the states thatis with cattle It is a common thingto see a man plow his beets or othercrops with one ox or with a cowhitched to a ohovel plow When theywork an animal single they have acollar and harness and a bridle witha bit that goes in the mouth the sameas we work a horse Sometimes yousee two animals hitched together acow and a bull or two cows To met it looks very much out of place to seetwo old milch cows hitched to a bigload of wheat but it is common hereThese people here know what itis to work They Cut every bit of theirgrain with the hand sickle They raisemagnificent crops of everything Everything depends

onionswere once commonly sold in this country but much larger American garlic is shipped in crates and barrelssome from the -Jar southtwest comes inlong cylindrical basketsGarlic is sold by the pound or by thesingle bulb which is sold for a pennyIn its commercial form whole anddry garlic does not yield the strongsmell for which it is famous In awholesale produce establishmentwheregarlic was stacked up in quantitiesthere was no noticeable odor from itBut if one of the several smaller bulbsof which each root is composed andwhich are called cloves of garlic bpbroken off and broken in two

arousing interest inthe cause of improved highways hasoften surprised those who were convinced of their importance and hassometimes discouraged them It is tenyears now since the league institutedits active and aggressive good roadscampaign Great results have beenachieved but there is yet much to bedone There are still extensive ruraldistricts in which the people areapathetic in spite of the efforts of thepress and of organized clubs all over thecountryIn the more sparsely settled districtsand especially in many parts of thewest it is claimed that activity in railroad construction has prevented expenditure of much energy and capitalin building good roads The people andthe state legislatures are interested inthe railway problem they are agitating for railroad facilities working tosecure them and until this is accomplished the question of better wagouroads is in abeyance In the older statessuch as Massachusetts and New Jerseywhere so much has been done thegrowth of railroad building has nearlyreached its maximum so that withtheir denser population they are in aposition to take hold of their commonroadsBut even allowing for all this iZ isproving a slow task to awaken all classesof the population to the positive valuesto them of better roads In commenting on the conditions that exist in Kansas the Topeka Capitol says that thefarmers of such states as Kansas wherethe roads are as bad as they possiblycan be and where the loss is heaviest tcthe producers who are obliged to Stayout of the market during an importantpart of the year because of impassableroads apparently pay no attention tcthis all important subject It is thsconservative and careful estimate oi thegovernment at Washington that thepeople of the United States lose everyyear no less than 600000000 by reasouof impassable or defective roads theloss being mainly borne by the f armersIt requires the entire wheat crop everyyear to pay the loss to farmers occasioned by bad roads This is no fanciful estimate but is below rather thanabove the truth Students of road making who are familiar with the results oithe excellent roads of old world countries estimate that bad roads cost thewestern farmers 25 per cent of everything he buys There is in reality ncsubject of more importance to the farmers than road improvement and thereis none in which the average farmer takes less apparent interest Ncstate in the union has more to gain byactive road reform beginning with theadoption of wide tires than Kansas Ithas been profitable elsewhere to remthe road tax of all farmers using widetires and no doubt the same policjwould work to advantage in this stateThe present time is agoodone to in-crease Jthe agitation for highway iinprovement If the matter is broughtforcibly to the attention of the farmersthey may be made to realize its directimportance to them Crops are abundant and find ready sale With thecoming wet weather and deterioratingroads will come an object lesson whichshould be used b the press and allgood roads advocates to srengthentheir arguments The farmer can thencount in dollars and cents the loss entailed on him from inability to get tomarket easily and cheaply He is ina better position now than he has beenfor some time to undertake the workNo other investment will pay him sowellIn some sections these facts are apXJreciated and every effort is being madeto secure road improvements CountyCommissioner Clark in Pennsylvaniasays I have never seen in Alleghenyccunty such enthusiasm as there is overthis movement Everybody is interested The law is well

New Era Greensburg IndMany of our readers may remember anitem in this paper a year ago last fall whichstated that Mr William Stimpson a well-to-dofarmer living near Rugby Ind hadbeen stricken with paralysis of the lowerlimbs and his recovery was doubtfulThe case which was an unusually severeand complicated one has at last been entirelycured to the utmost surprise and joy of MrStimpson and his familyMr Stimpson was pleased to relate to areporter the particulars regarding his caseand his subsequent recoveryA year ago last fall began Mr Stimpson I did a large amount of work Myhired help left me in the middle of corn cutting and I finished the fall work myselfdoing an unusual large amount of work Iput up several hundred shocks of fodderand also husked all my corn To accomplish this I had to work early and lateAbout the first of December as I wasgetting my fall work about done I suffered a stroke of paralysis which the physician said was brought on by excessive laborMy left limb was entirely helpless and myright limb was fast becoming so My physician became uneasy and after attendingupon me for a week or so he brought me abox of Dr Williams Tink Pills for TaleTeople sayingthat he believed thev woulddo me more good than anything which heknew of as he had used them with greatsuccess in a case very similar to mine whereall other remedies had failed The case inquestion was that of L Phillips of PetersvilleAbout the time I began taking the secondbox of these pills a decided change wasnoticed and when I had taken two moreboxes we discovered that I was actually getting well You can probably imagine whata relief and feeling of gladness this was tome after being confined to my bed fornearly two months Well I kept on taking the pills according to directions until Ihad consumed nine boxes of them whichcompletely cured meI am sound and well to day with not asign of the returning affliction and canaffirm that Dr Williams Pink Pills forPale People did me a wonderful good

flowers under her feet Butthat could not continue for she was avery sweet little woman and could noteven hurt a flower without regrettingit and presently she bent her gracefulfigure and pulled the wild anemonesand the few late violets and havingreached the rustic seat she added a roseor two and sat down- Its a perfectly lovely morningshe murmured and pinned the flowersamong the folds of tbe mull kerchiefI wonder where she has taken thechild becauseShe stopped and looked anxiouslyabout till she saw in the distance themaid and the little boy rambling amongthe trees and apparently absorbed ingathering wild flowers and chasing butterflies and the music of the childslaughter was borne to her on the softperfumed summer breeze It was aheavenly sound a sound to gladdenany mothers heart but Kate Seldensighed and drew from her belt a closelycrumpled piece of paper which she hadthrust there in fierce impatience and asshe looked at it the tears which hadnot retreated very far again rose to hereyesOh Im just a dreadful fool shethought A silly silly little simpleton And Im glad he is late for Iwouldnt have him know for anythingin this world that I cared enough tocry And smoothing out the crumpled paper she began to read the written words once more though she already knew them by heartIf you will see me on Wednesdaywe can talk the matter over I havespoken with my lawyer and he

Whatwoman could fAnd then she heard the laughter andshouts of little Sidney who had justcaught sight of his father and was howrunning wildly to welcome him It wasa fortunate interruption to a scene tliatwas nearing a painful climax and shewas very glad to take a step or two toward the laughing boy who was already flying across the bridge followedby his nurse then there was a crash ashriek The

two pairs of arms met andclasped each other close about theconquering hero who seemed to find himself quite suddenly an object of secondary importanceIt then occurred to Annette that Master Sidney
