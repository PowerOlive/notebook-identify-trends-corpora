-Mr. Lettou Vimont received a telegram
Tuesday morning announcing the death
of his brother, A. T. Vimont, at Ordway,
Col. Mr. Vimont was seized with 'a
hemorrhage of the luligs about 2 o'clock
Tuesday morning, dying almost immed
iately. He was about 30 years old and
for the past four years had been a suf
ferer of tuberculosis. The most of this
time he had been going from place to
place in vain endeavor to seek health.
He spent about 18 mouths at Ashville, j
in. . lvast July lie went to Eads, Col.,
where he remained until about two
months ago, when he went to Ordway
and built a beautiful little cottage. Some
days ago his mother received a letter
from him saying that he had entirely re
covered from the grippe and was able to
make garden. The announcement of his
death was a shock to relatives here. He
was the oldest son of Mr. and Mrs. J.
M. Vimont and in his early years was a
prominent vernier farmer, .omp vmk
ago ne was unite i m marriage to Mrs
Naomi Harbaugh of Franklin, Ind, Be
sides his wife he is survived by his moth
er, Mrs. Vina Vimont, one brother Mr
iyetton Vimont, and one sister. Mrs. C.
n. Lavson. Hie remains nrrivpfl liara

home of his mother, in Millersburg cem

would menace those who have put their
imiii cdmeu money down lor the pur

selfish and several of the most prominent
tax payers are involved. Ten thousand

Fifth streets to the depot and Vimont
a"CCL- Ali e proserty owners on the
side street have contributed liberally
but unless those who are holding off
come up with their portion, there will
not be enough oil .to cover the streets
and those wholiave contributed will de
mand the return of their money. Color
ed people and citizens of moderate cir
cumstance L have been the most liberal
contnbuters tofthe tund, and it is dis
tressing that they should be imposed up
on in such a manner. There should be.
an ordinance enacted and there is a
a probability stich action will be taken to
require all the citizens to oil in front of
their homes. The matter has reached
the final stage, so those who are holding
on had oest reconsider aud contribute
theirshare toward the movement.
