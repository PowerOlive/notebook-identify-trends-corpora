CLAY DEADDeath Summons Comes To NotedBourbon' Turfman AndCitizenThe inevitable summons, to whichall mUst respond, the . trumpet callof the Grim- Messenger, came Monday night at nine o'clock, to Col.Ezekiel Fields Clay, aged eighty,citizen, soldier and a man amongmen, at his home on the Cynthianaroad, near Paris. Col. Clay hadbeen in declining health for severalmonths, but 'had been able to be upand about until a few days age,when he contracted pneumonia, which was the immediatecause of his death.The funeral was held at the family home, Wednesday afternoon atthree o clock, with services conducted by Rev. W. E Ellis, pastorof the Paris Christian church, ofwhich Col. Clay had for almost alifetime been a devoted member.The burial followed on the familylot in the Paris Cemetery, in thepiesence of a large concourse o'friends and relatives, and many ofhis cojinrades-in-arms, who had followed him in the days of the war.The pall-bearers were: Honortry J. Harry Holt, Catesby Woodlord, Benjamin Woodford, T. HartTalbott, James F. McClure and Wm.T. Bucknei ; Active S. BiooksClay,, Catesby W. Speais, Ze!oDavenport, Ayelette Buckner, Buckner Woodford, Samuel Clay, John F.Davis, Ezekiel Arnold, John HarrisClay and Cassius M. Clay.Col. Clay, who was one of theworthy representative citizens oLBouibon. county, descended from anancestry of which he felt justlyproud, various representatives of thefamily figuring prominently in thepublic affairs in Virginia and Kentucky. The name has honorablyadorned many pages of Ajmericanhistory, and Col. Clay's forebearswere jmen of noted mental calibei,raie versatility and extraordinaryexecutive ability. He was born inBourbon county the first day of December, 1840, and was the son ofHon. Bratus J. and Amanda (Field)Clay.Col. Clay, after due preliminaryeducational training in the publicrchool of his native county, enteredBacon College, Harrodsbu'rg, andwas nursuing his studies in' that institution when the dark cloud ofthe Civil War cast its pall over adividing nation. On October 21,he left the LTniversity td enter t-nsConfederate seivice, enlisting as uprivate in the First KentuckyMounted Rifles. He was in activeixrvice during the succeeding faland winter, under General Humphrey Marshall in the mountainsof Eastern Kentucky and WesternVirginia.Col. Clay then organized a newcompany, of which he was electedCaptain early in 1862, and was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel in theFust Batallion. He continued mGeneral Marshall's commandthionghcut 1862, and commandinghis battalion, was actively engagedduring the Federal raid on the Halston River, near Abingdon, in thowinter of 1862-63. The followingmonths weie passed in raids andskiiimishs of minor importanceuntil September, when Col. Clay ledhis battalion, under the brigadecommand of General Hodge, uncerGeneral Forrest, in the operationfollowing the battle of Chickamaugaand on the thirtieth started out inthe vicinity of Athens, Tenn., forMcMinville, as a part of the forcesof General Wheeler, in the famousraid through middle Tennessee.His battalion was advance guardof the brigade, and accompanied byGeneral Davidson, the division commander, opened the attack on McMinville, October 3, and drove theenemy from the rifle pits. Whenthe brigade came up the garrisonsurrendered with several million.dollars' worth of stores and provision. Col. Clay was also in the leadof an attack on Shelbyville, whenGeneral Wheeler was defeated. Following this Clay and hjs soldiersfought in the'1 rear guard, determinedly resisting the Federal pursuersand suffered great losses. Said General Hodge: "For five hours and ahalf over seven miles of country anunequal contest continued. My gallant brigade was cut to pieces andslaughtered. I had informed theofficers and men that the sacrifice oftheir lives was necessary and theymanfully made the 'Sacrifice." Inthis memorable fight Col. Clay's1 oise was killed under him. Immediately securing another mount hewas severely wounded while gallantly commanding his battalion.During the Knoxville campaign hewas with a regiment in Armstrong'sdivision and was on active duty inBast Tennessee. In April, 1864, atPuncheon Creek, near ' Paintville,Ky., in command of his brigade heencountered a brigade of the enemyand had the misfortune to be againwounded, a rifle ball destroying thesight of one of his eyes. At thesame tijme he was captured, and being taken to Johnson's Island, O.,was held lhere until a short timebefore the surrender of General Lee.when he was paroled by order ofPnsident Lincoln, and permitted toreturn to his old home in Bourboncounty. j tlio- late George C.

On the organization of theADJUDGED INSANEIn the County Court, Tuesday,benjamin Franklin Holder, neretfabout fifty, was jriven a hearingoetoio J.udge George Batterton in Jtunacy proceedings. After hearingthe testimony, or physicians andothers, the jury adjudged him to be"of unsound mind and ordered hisconfinement in . the Eastern Kentucky Insane Hospital, at Lexington, where he was taken Wednesaavpiorn'ng' by an attendant.Holder became insane over theacquisition of real estate. Heclaimed that he owned one-tenth ofthe whole world, and that the end.of all things terrestrial would be amatter of but a short time. Hewanted to dispose of his one-tenthinterest, but could find no takers,all the real estate men being awayon important business of their own.Holder, who is a traveling evangelist, approached Deputy SheriffRobt. M.'Gilkey, while the NorthMiddletown Chautauqua "was inpi ogress and protested the Chautauqua, stating that such thingsvere of no value and ought to bediscouraged. He told Mr. -Gilkeythat he (Holder) had until a rewweeks ago owned the entire world,by a special dispensation from.Heaven, but that it was too big atask to keep it going, and he hadgiven it all away except a onetenth interest. Mr. Gilkey soothedLorn and persuaded him to accompany him to- Paris where he washeld until an examination into hismenial condition was made by physicians.

Claywas made its piesident and he wasable and popular incumbent ofthis office until 1909, when he resigned. He served for several yearsas President of the Kentucky Racing Association, the oldest- turf organization in America. In politicshe was aligned ab a loyal supporterof the principles of the Democraticpa'rty, and contributed in generousmeasures tc the civil and ma'terialadvencement of his home countyand State at large. He was a manof mentality and broad humantarianism. His genial kindness wonhim a host of friends In a fraternal way he was affiliated with various representative and social andfraternal organizations.In 1867 Col Clay began thebreeding, of Shorthorns, which hecontinued most successfully until1875. Following that period he entered into a partnership with, thelate George Bowen, former Sheriffof Bourbon county, in the breedingof thoroughbred horses. At Mr.Bowen's death he formed a) partnership with Catesby Woodford, andtogether they established the famous Runnypneade Stud. From thisstud came ,Miss Woodford, Hanover,Imp. Billet, Hindoo, Six Dixon, Jaconet (sister of the great Iroquois),and many other kings and queens ofthe turf. From the RunnymeadeStud was fcold to Dwyer Bros.,Houston, a full brother to Hanover,for ?3,200, which at that time wasthe highest price ever paid for atwo-year-old. As Col. Clay was inthe thoroughbred business for loveof the horse, his strict integrity andhigh moral character enabled himto bring about many turf reforms,and numerous laws passed for theregulation of racing on the Ajmerican tracks have been prompted byhis efforts to keep up the standardof racing. le is doubtful if thereas a more widely known or morepopular breeder of thoroughbredhorses in America.On May 8, 1866, Col. Clay married Miss Mary L. Woodford, idaughter of 'John T. and ElizabethBuckner Woodford.

KtuckyjrEwspiurjs advancedPER-CgrPSOFCE 1815 .v A current report- of the Government Forest service says that fehelarger newspaper publishers of thecountry have Been able to keepdown the advance in cost of theirnewsprint to about 200 per cent,because of j.heir ability to contractin large volume. But the marketprice, according- to the bulletin, hatadvanced 500 per cent, since 191JT.It is at this price that the' smallpublisher is compelled to . buy. hi?paper stock.Primarily the reason for the advance in paper is due to a woodshortage. In early days the papermills were built in the lumber regions and their' pulp wood was a.sort of by-product ot tne saw jmui?ing industry. But in most of thesjregions the saw mills have finished,and they have packed up, burnedout, or moved away for some otherreason. But the paper mill cannotplay the part of "caipet bagger"quite so easily, and as a result thenorth-eastern ptrt of the UnitedStates has become largely dependentupon Canadian wood. Spruce fromMinnesota and Canada, for-example,is being hauled fom 700' to 1,200miles to Wisconsin paper mills. InNew York State, where nearly fiftyper cent, of our newsprint paper isproduced, sixty per cent, of the pulpand paper jmills have absolutely nntimber supplies of their own. NewHampshire and Maine appear to bethe only Eastern States that stillhave raw materials for making paper, and there is a well-groundedsuspicion in the paper trade thatthe day of profiteering in spruce,hemlock balsam and poplar ispretty well -under way.The big papers, in any event,..re certainly eating up the littleones, and their "funny sheets,"magazine sections and other irrelevant features add to the tragedyof the proceedings.oWOMAN'S CLUB NOTESIn response to the request of theKentucky Federation of Women'sClubs, a five-day course in Citizenship was given by the University ofKentucky ending Friday, July 25,the course being given as a, featureof the Summer Session.

"It's onethat, will appeal to all patriotic people, regardless of their political affiliation. As a candidate I am standing squarely on that platform andfighting for it," he declared.THE DEMOCRATIC .PLATl-ORMThe Elizabeth News says it is aplatform "which will satisfy allreasonable Democrats and will (makevots for the party."

R. Elliott, ofthe Agricultural Experiment Station of Kentucky University, "rust"or "wildfire"-' has-been found in afoty-acre patch of tobacco belonging to J. D. Gay, near Clintonville.They estimate that the crop hasbeen damaged to tlie extent of $10,000 oi $15,000. The; investigationin this county has been limited,and it is possible that ot.her tobaccocrops in the county will be foundj infected as the investigation progresses.Investigations made so far. indicate the infection is caused by twodistinct disease. One is what iscommonl known as rust, bacterialinfection, whch usually hits tobacco about cutting time. Thisyear, however, it has made its- appearance several weeks previous,and just what effect it will have onthe plants cannot be determined asyet. When the disease attacks theleaves near cutting time, tne tobacco can be cut and the damageis only slight.The other disease bears a closeresemblance to "wild fire," a bacterial 'disease which has been doing.much damage in North Carolinafor the last your years. So far asExperiment Station experts havobeen able to determine, this is thehrst appearance of the disease inKentucky.Dr. Valleau is devoting all histime to an. investigation and studyof the infections, but as yet no remedy las been discovered.Since both of the diseases arebacterial infections, they are spreadby the wind and rain from leaf toleaf, experts say. It has beennotfeed that 'the side of the leaf onthe side from which the rain iscoming is the worst affected.APPELLATE COURT SUSTAINSBOURBON COURT DECISIONAnothei chapter was written in,the contention1 between th people"of Millersburg, the Milfersburg Military Institute and the BourbonCounty Board af 'Education, Tuesday.

This yearSudan glass sown in May was nearly waist high on the Kentucky Experiment Station farm, July 1. ILwas a small area, but was grownon rich land.Hogs were turned in -on one Experiment Station plot about the middle of June and they ate it down inpreference to rape. They were takenoff when the stand was hogged andthe grass has sprouted up nicelyagain, despite the dry condition .ofthe soil.Agronomists do not give unqualified recommendation to Sudangrass because of this short trial,but they see no reason why it wouldnot fill the need. Hogs should beringed before turning into a Sudangrass pasture or they will injurethe stand by rooting.0LEMON JUICEFOR FRECKLEStI pirls!
