CONFIRMED PROOF.
Residents of Paris Cannot Doubt
What Has Been Twice
Proved.
In gratitude for relief from aches
and pains snd bad backs from 'dis
tressing kidney ills thousands have
publicly recommended Uoan's Kidney
Pills. Residents of Paris, who so testi
fied years ago, now say the results
were permanent. This testimony
doubtly proves the worth of Doan's
Kidney Pills to Paris kidney sufferers.
Mrs. J. T. Martin, Pleasant and
Eleventh streets, Paris, Ky., says:
"All I have ever said praising Doan'e
Kidney Pills was entirely correct and
confirm my former public endorsement
of this remedy. It permanently cured
me of kidney trouble. I suffered quite
severely from pains across Ithe small
of my back and in my kidneys. The
trouble alarmed me and I tried many
medicines. I did not get relief how
ever, until I procured Doan's Kidney
Pills at Wilson's drug store. They
improved my condition in every way
and 1 certainly can say they are a
reparation of merit."

pany bond department reports the
sale of the Stephenville North and
South Texas Railway Company bonds
as being quite brisk in the Eastern
markets, they having placed over two
thirds of the entire issue of $2,423,000
in New York City, showing the de
mand in the .East for rail bonds of
this character. The bond department
of the Commonwealth Trust Company,
which was recently organized under
the able management of Mr. .lames D.
Chambers, who for five years was
manager of the bond department of
the Union Savings Bank and Trust
Company of Cincinnaii, has been mak
ing rapid strides, and are today in a
position to furnish bond buyers any
information they may desire with re
ference to investment securities.

Keller Not in Race.
Hon. W. J. Fields, congressman
from the Ninth Kentucky District, has
made a formal announcement of his
candidacy for renomination. It is
practically assured that Congressman
Fields will not have opposition, though
there are several counties that have
favorite sons they would like to have
the honor. During the past week
many of the friends of Col. G. R.
Keller, representative from the Robinson-Nicholas
legislative district, have
been mentioning his name as a suit
able man for the place. But it is cer
tain that Col. Keller will not consider
entering the race, as he is one of Con
gressman Field's strongest supporters
in this election.

Mauser is Now a Hold0ut.
James Hauser, who last year was a
member of the Paris team, was one of
the most promising young pitchers in
the Blue Grass League, is a hold-out,
and there is a possibility that ;he will
not return to Paris this season. The
fact that Hauser has so far failed to
sign a contract has been the source of
considerable uneasiness on the part r,f
the local fans who looked upon him as
being the mainstay of the Bourbonites
this season.
Hauser is holding out for more
money according to President Bacon,
and the amount he has asked is beyond
the reach of the local club. The sturdy
young fellow was forwarded a con
tract some two months ago and the
Paris management was very liberal in
granting amincreasen his salary over
last year, but Hauser wants more and
has stated that unless his demands are
met he will remain in his home town
this season and pitch independent ball.
In a letter to a friend in this city he
stated that he did not intend to return
to Paris, but there is a belief that he
will reconsider and the fans here
entertain the hope that he will make
up his mind to report in time to go in
to training with the other members of
the club when they arrive here about
April 11.
Last season Hauser was regarded as
the mos promising piece of base ball
timher on the Paris team or in the
league and with the substantial in
crease in his salary over last season it
was. the opinion of the local manage
ment that he would be one of the first
to return his contract. Being on the
reserve list it will be impossible to
participate in organized base ball un
less the Paris management grants his
release.
President Bacon, who has been
making an elfort to secure a catcher
from one of the clubs higher up.states
that so far he has not succeeded but
that the man he has in view has asked
for termB which have been forwarded
him, and he is daily expecting a reply.
NOTES.
All doubt as to whether Richmond
will have a team in the Blue Grass
League this season was dispelled Sat
urday when it was reported that the
comimttee appointed to solicit funds
with which to Dut the team on a good
sound footing this season reported that
the necessary $2,l)UU hart oeen raised.
The fans went down in their pockets
and responded nobly to the call and
now a team is assured.
At a meeting uf the stockholders
of the Winchester club held in that
citv Wednesday night a new boa-d of
directors was elected and it was an
nounced that SI, 000 had been subscrib
ed towards financing the club this
season. An additional S600 is needed
but it is believed this amount will be
raised in a few days. It is the h( pe of
the management to secure O. v.
Moran, of Washington, D. C, to man
age the team this season.
Jimmy Viox, a former Colt,' is with
the Pirates in training at Hot Sprk)?3.
According to reports trom the training
camp the little shortfielder is making
a very creditable showing.
