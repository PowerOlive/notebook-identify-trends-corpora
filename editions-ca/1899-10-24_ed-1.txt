just madepublic is that relating- to the increaseof the medical corps of the navy Hepoints out that while there has been asteady increase in the enlisted force ofthe navy for the past two years andwhile the marine corps has beenswelled by the addition of 3000 menthere has been no suitable provisionmade for a corresponding increase inthe medical corps which is chargedwith the care of the health of thesemenEvery surgeon who is not sick is saidto be on duty and the department hasbeen unable to supply surgeons forneeded recruiting and other dutiesTherefore the surgeon general saysthat the corps be increased five surgeons and twenty assistant surgeonsand five volunteer surgeons who servedin the war and who are now in servicebe transferred to the regular rolls andthe age limitation be removed Thereare eighteen of these men and in somecases they are over thirty years of ageIt is also earnestly requested thatthe naval assistant surgeons be placedon an equality with those of the armyin pay and rank At present the armycan get all of the medical service itneeds while the navy can get scarcelyany surgeons to serve There are nowfour vacancies in the rank of assistantsurgeons and there will be eight moreduring the yearand the hope is expressed that the corps will not be allowed to die out from lack of recruitswhich must follow unless the inducements are equal to those offered in thearray at leastThe surgeon general calls attentionto the fact that of the 84 casualtiesduring the war with Spain only 17have put in pension applicationsso far a most noteworthy fact in viewof the report that 18 of the casualtiesresulted for the vearIn concluding the report special attention is invited to the excellent sanitary conditions existing in the navyand especially in the Asiatic squadronduring the past year Early precautions were taken to prevent as far aspossible the ill effects resulting fromnecessary climatic exposure and togive the best care and attention to thesick The

hand 1looked aside for a second at the line ofbreathless faces watching me then backain to the muzzle of my weapon DEntrangues was now not 20 yards away Icould scarcely breathe as 1 pointed the arquebus at his heart I had already begunvo press the trigger when something seemedto come across my mind like lightning Isaw in a moment that lonely room in the Al1 izzi palace where I had kneeled to my Godnd sworn to put aside my vengenee Theweapon shook in my graspFire sinore whispered Jacopo hoarselyWith an effort I jerked the muzzle in theair and pulled the trigger The report wafollowed by four others and two of theHoopers fell The next moment we were onthem with a shout and there was a clash ofsteel as fierce blows were struck and received now and again a short angry oathand sometimes a cry of pain I did not wantto take life but a trooper came at me so 1had to run him through the heart and themar fell forward under Castors hoofs witha yutt I shall never forget The next instantDEntrangues and I crossed blades andwhether he recognized me or not I do notknow but he fought with a skill and fierceness I have never seen equaled At last Ilost my temper and cut savagely at him Heparried on the forte of his blade but sofurious was the stroke that it broke theweapon in his hand and almost unhorsedhim Reining back skillfully he avoided another cut I made at him and drawing awheel lock pistol from his holster fired itstraight at me At the flash some onedashed between us I heard a scream whichfroze the blood in me and a body lurchedforward and fell to my side whilst a riderless horse plunged through the press andgalloped away I saw the light of the goldenlead as it fell and forgetting everythingforgetting DEntrangues forgetting all butthe fact that a dreadful deed was done Isprang down from Castor and raised StArmando in my arms As I did this a hoarseyell from my men told me the day was wonbut 1 had no ears for this no eyes for anything except the slight ligure which lay inmy arms gasping out its lifeCongratulations signore we have takenthe lot and Jacopo bleeding and dustyrode up beside meAt too great a price 1 groaned helpme to carry I could say no moreHere two of you secure those mulesBande Nere see to the wounded Queen ofHeaven the chevalier and Jacopo giving his sharp orders sprang down beside meand together we bore our unconscious burden under the shadow of the oaks A darkfigure stepped to our side and kneelingdown supported the lifeless head on his armwhilst hot tears fell from his eyes as hepraved over her It was the abbeflow did this happen I asked did Inot say you were not to moveIt was done at once he answered Icould not prevent it alas How can I carrythis tale back to St ArmandeWater excellencyJacopo bid brought some clear water inbis helmet I thanked him with a look andbe stepped back leaving us three togetherTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY TUESDAY OCTOBER 24 1899two who were living and one who was goingawayI bathed the forehead and drawn lipsfrom which flowed a thin stream of bloodand as I did so her eyes opened but the filmof death was on themDi Savelli Ugo and she was goneGone like a flash flung swiftly and fastinto eternity struck down perhaps unwittingly by the arm which should have beena shield to her I have often wondered ifDEntrangues ever knew who fell to hispistol shot If he did God pity him In theone glimpse I caught of his white face as he6wung round and rode off I thought I sawa look of horror But everything went soquickly that then I had no time to thinkand now I can recall but the endTo her dead lips Carillon pressed his crucifix into her dead ears he mumbled prayers1 knelt tearless and prayerless beside himthinking only of the great love that had laiddown a lifeOne by one my men stole up and stood ina half circle leaning on the cross handles oftheir swords over which the grim beardedfaces looked down on us in pitySuddenly Carillon raised his crucifix aloftMy Father he cried receive her soulAmi some one said softlyAmenCHAPTER XXVTHE VENGEANCE OF CORTEWe buried our dead and madame sleptbeneath the ilex in the courtyard at thecastle below the north wall Over her nameten grave we raised a rude cross and afterit was done Carillon bade me farewell Hewas noing he said to bear the story to StArmande and when be reached it 1 witthere was sorrow in the Picard chateauhence madame took her name It was witha heart of lead that I rode into Sassofcrratoand there as arranged made over my prizeto Hawkwood The tale of the ducats wascomplete nd the Englishman giving me myquittance held out his hand saying bluntly1 wronged you Di Savelli but 1 knownow We all know for Bayard has told usI hesitated Many memories came toand there was bitter resentment in my soulThey had all been too ready to believe Theyhad flung me forth as a thing too vile totouch and now it was an easy matter tohold out a hand to say lam sorry tothink that a civil word would heal a hideousv und The kind world was going to forgiveme because it had wronged me Such as itwas however it was the world and thingshad made me a little humble After all ifthe positions were reversed if I slood inHawkwoods place and he in mine howshould I have acted I would not like tosayCome said Hawkwood let thebe covered Come back we want youAs you will and I took his grasp Iwill come back in a little time Till thenadieuGood by and we partedFive minutes later I was spurring toRome my following at my heels It waa manner putting my neck on the block forirdo was probably making hithither with all speed and doubtless DEntrangues as well Recognition was allcertain but risk or no risk I was bound tosee the cardinal and tell him my taskdone Little did I think however astor bore me with his long easy gallop athe oak forests the- Nera that the face ofaffairs in Rome had been hanged in an hourand that had I bo wished I might have insafety proclaimed what I had done from thevery house tops As Ave came nearer thecity it was evident that there was somegieat commotion within for from everyquarter pillars of dim smoke rose up inspiral columns and then spreading out likea fan hung sullenly in the yellow of the sunset It was eear that houses were burningand swords were out We soon began tomeet parties of fugitives hurrying from thecity and making across country in all directions They avoided us like the plagueand the mere glint of our arms was sufficientto make them scatter to right and left leaving such property as they could not bearwith them to the tender mercies of theroadside Some of my men were cage r toride after the runaways and question thembut I forbade this knowing we should hearsoon enough and that if there were dangerit would be best to hold togetherPer Bacco and Jacopo riding up besideme pointed to a black cloud which slowlyrose and settled above the vineyards of thePincian hill we had best go with a leadenboot excellency There is a devils carnivalin Rome or I am foreswornAt this juncture we turned an abrupt corner of the road coming upon a crowd offugitives who seemed to be running forwards caring little where they went so thatthey put a distance between them and iJomeAmongst the throng was a figure I lecognized and in a mean habit mounted on amule which was seized with an obstinate fitand refused to budge although soundlythwacked I saw the cardinal of StrigoniaBidding Jacopo keep the men together Irode up to him and askedCan 1 render your eminence any aidHis round eyes starting out of his headlike a runaway hares glanced at me in fearand the stick he bore dropped from his handno doubt much to the satisfaction of themule At first he was unable to speak formy words seemed to fill the man with terrorand I had to repeat the question before hestammered outYou are mistaken sir I am no eminencebut a poor brother of Mount Carmel on myway to Foligno out of this hell behind meand he glanced over his shoulder towardsRomeI see I answered with a smile but ifthe poor brother of Mount Carmel will lookmore closely at me he will see a friend Inshort your eminence I am Di SavelliCorpo di Bacco I mean our Lady bethanked And so it is you cavaliere Takemy advice and turn your horses head toFoligno On beast and he kicked at themule which moved not an inchI am for Rome your eminence but whathas happenedOh that I had a horse he groanedWhat has happened Everything has happened Alexander is dead or dying Cesaredead they say and burning in hades by thisOrsini and Colonna at the old game of hammer and tongsAnd the cardinal DAmboseSafe enough I believe as the Orsini holdthe Borgo and have declared for FranceTrust me your reverence you will besafer in Rome than out of it The wholecountry will rise at the news and the habitof Mount Carmel will not save the cardinalof Strigonia Turn back with me and I willescort you to the Palazzo CornetoTo make a short story DEste agreed aftera little persuasion and the mule was kindenough to amble back very willingiy toRome We placed his eminence in the eenterof our troops and went onwards enteringthe city by the Porta Pinciana riding alongleisurely in the direction of S Trinila diMonti and thence straight on towards theRipetta It was a work of no little dangerto make this last passage for everywherebands of plunderers were engaged in guttingthe houses many of which were in flame3und we continually came across dead bodiesor passed houses from which we heardshrieks of agony We could help no oneIt was all we could do to keep our own headson our shoulders but by dint of shoutingA Colonna with the Colcnna and OrsiniOrsini with their rivals and sometimeshitting a shrewd blow or two we crossedthe Ripetta and in a few minutes were safein the Palazzo CornetoHere we were received by Le Clerc whocomforted the trembling Strigonia with theassurance that an excellent supper awaitedhim informing me almost in the samebreath that DAmboise was in the VaticanI lost no time in repairing thither which Idid on foot accompanied by Jacopo aloneand made my way without let or ftindranitto the Torre Borgia Here everything was inthe wildest confusion and the Spanish soldiers of the pope were plundering right andleft I stumbled across De Leyva who witha few men at Vns back was trying to maintain order He gladly accepted the offer ofmy sword and we did what we could to prevent the wholesale robbery from going onIn a brief interval of rest I askedDo you know where DAmboise isIn the Sistine chapel with half-a-dozenothers De Briconnet guards the entranceAnd AlexanderDead or dying I do not even knowwhere is is Don Michele has seized as muchas he can and carrying Cesare on a litterhas escaped to OstiaThen Casare is not deadXo Cross of St James see that andhe pointed to a reeling drunken crowd fullwith wine and plunder who passed by uswith yells into the great reception roomsFollowed by the few men who remainedsteady De Leyva dashed after them andwith Jacopo at my heels I made for theSistine chapel I reached the Scala lxcgiaand although I knew the Sistine chapel wasbut a few feet distant yet owing to thedarkness that prevailed I missed the wayand Jacopo was of course unable to help meGroping onwards we came to a small doorand pushing it found it to open easily Itled into a narrow vaulted passage Avherethe darkness was as if a velvet curtain ofblack hung before us I do not like tbelook of this excellency said Jacopo as wehalted in front of the doorKeep a drawn sword I answered andfolkow moWe could only go in single file and pickedour way with the greatest care our feet ringon the stone iloor Except for this thesilence was intense and we could hear nosound of the deviltry outside The passagecontinued until we almost began to thinkit had no end but at last the darkness gaveway to a semigloom and a faint bar of lightgleamed ahead of us At this we increasedour pace finding a sharp corner a lttle beyond which rose a winding flight of stairsending before a half open door throughwhich ike dim light came I put my footonthe first of the steps and Avas about to as-wncn wo were startled by hearing amoan of mortal ony followed by a laughso wild and shrill so exultant and yet sofull of malice that it chilled us to the boneIt pealed through the door and echoed downhe passage behind us until the horridcadence became fainter and fainter finallydying away into the black darknessGod save us exclaimed Jacopo it is afiend laughing its way to helllie went on with chattering teeth toaciure me to go no further but crossing my-wcJhmCStmLMm y3SAnd she was goneself I bade him be silent and stepped forwards Since that moan of agony and teriible laugh of triumph there was no soundami I could il most hear my heart beating as1 reached the door Jacopo had nerved himself to follow me and stood pale and trembling at my shoulder his sword quivering inhis shaking hand I was myself not freefrom fear for no man may combat withspirits but after a moments hesitation Ilooked cautiously in I saw before me a roomof great size dimly lighted by two tall candles burning on each side of a massive bedstead on which lay a man bound and writhing in the throes of death The light thoughfaint around the room fell full on the faceof the men and horribly as the features werechanged distorted as they were I saw theywere those of Alexander and that he wasin his last agony alone ami friendless in hissplendid palace Yet not alone- there wasanother figure in the room As I looked itstepped out of the gloom of the rich curtainsat the window and standing over the bedlaughed again that terrible laugh of devilishjoy At the sound the dying man moanedthrough his black foam clothed lips andCorte for it was he bent over the body andmocked himRoderigo Borgia Vicar of Christ hellyawns for you but a few moments Borgiabut a few moments of life think you thatyou suffer now There is more comingthings 1 even cannot dream cf In the faceof Alexander came so awful a look of entreaty that I could bear it no longer Istepped into the room and putting my handon Cortes shoulder saidCome let him die in peaceHe turned on me with a snarl but recognizing me laughed againHa ha Let him die in peace Whyman you saw her die and can say thisBut he is going too It is a week since his doctor Matthew Corte bled him for an agueand touched him with a little knife just abttle pin prick He began to die then buthell is not yet hot enough for him He diesin too much peace Why my dog died inmore agony But he has felt somethingSee those torn curtains See this disorderedroom He tore those curtains in his madness He bit at the wood of the chairs hehowled like a dog at the moon and theytied him here and left him I alone watchI will let him die in peace Ila ha It isgood 1 do not want him to die yet I givehim food and he lives In a little while perhaps he will die But in peace ha ha Icould almost die with laughter when I hearthat It is too good Ha haI saw it was hopeless to do anything withCorte and the pope was beyond repair Imight have cut down the madman but itwould have served no purpose For a moment I thought I would -ass my swordthrough the Borgia and free him from painIt would have been a mercy but I luckilyhad the sense to restrain nvyself AgainAlexander deserved his fate and a few minutes more or less would make no differenceSo I left the wretch to die the death of adog that befitted his life and turning on myheel went back through the passageJacopo heaved a sigh of relief as we cameout and I felt a different man as I ran downthe steps of the Scala Regia Here I metwith De Leyva again and told him what 1had seenThe Camerlengo has just gone to himhe answered referring to the pope and youhave missed DAmboise He has returnedto the Palazzo Corneto I can do nothinghere and am going myself Do you walk orride I have no horseWalk 1 answered and the Spaniardlinked his arm in mine as followed byJacopo we took our way back to the cardinals houseOn reaching there 1 sought DAmboise atonce He had heard of my arrival and wasawaiting me After a brief greeting 1 told himhis business was done and handed him thequittance I had received from HawkwoodHe was mightily pleased as may be imagined I felt it my duty to inform him ofthe death of St Armande telling him howit occurred without in any way disclosingmy knowledge of the secret He was muchaffectedIt is a sad business he said but wehave other things to think of now MonDieu mon Dieu And to this day I amunaware if he knew or notBut the night was not yet over and lateas it was there were yet things to be doneAbout midnight we heard that Alexanderwas dead and a few minutes later OentilOrsini hurried to the cardinal They held ahasty council and De Briconnet and I weresummoned News had come that Cesare hadnot yet left Ostia that he was too ill totravel and DAmboise and Orsini resolvedon a bold stroke It was nothing less thanthe capture of Borgia Orsini offered to lend200 lances for the purpose but a leader waswanted He could not go himself as hisarch enemy Fabrizio Colonna held all Romeon the left bank of the Tiber and was insufficient force to make a dash for the Borgoat any moment The short of it was thatat the cardinals recommendation I receivedthe command and about two in the morningset out for stia If the ships Cesare hadhired had arrived the matter was ended andwe could do nothing but if not there wasevery chance of his surrendering without ablow as although he had about 500 menwith him they were not to be relied on except the half dozen cut throats who formedhis personal guard and who might betrusted to fight to the last The luck whichhad followed me so far favored me againand pressing on as fast as our horses couldbear us we came up with the fugitives in theearly morning Only one ship too small tohold all had come and they were crowdeden the banks of the Tiber making every effort to embark The river shore was strewnwith the enormous quantity of baggage theyhad with them and a scene of the utmostconfusion took place on our arrival Theship was drawing up to the quay and wecould see the litter of the Borgia surrounded by the few men who meant to fight Theaffair was over in five minutes and Cesarewas my prisoner Seeing how mattersstood the master of the ship anchored inmid stream heedless of the yells and execrations of the followers of the Borgia whowere not spared by my men Indeed 1 hadgreat difficulty in keeping Cesare from harmHe was in truth very ill but was able togasp out as he yieldedMaldetto it is my fate I had prepared for everything except being ill Hethen lay back in his litter and spoke nomoreTO BE CONTINUEDThe Elaborate Chinese XovelIt is a proof of the high degree ofelaboration to which fiction literaturein China has been carried that most oftheir novels are thickly interspersedwith poems of all orders of merit Xostronger evidence could be afforded ofthe fact that whatever they lack it isnot literary finish If anything theyhave this in excess These poems areintroduced in a variety of ways Tnehero sends one in a billet doux to theheroine or he overhears her singingone or perhaps a poetic contest isstruck up the fine on defeat being generally the compulsory drinking of somany extra flagons of wine Winedrinking and poetizing almost invariably go together in Chinese novelsthough whether they do so in real

the nextgrowth richer and more luxuriantYear after year century after centurythe process of growth itnd decay wenton until the beds of v getable matterthus deposited had reached greatthicknessBut the earths body was still shrinking and in conseqrt ace her crust attimes contracted and fell in When itdid so the land sank throughout vaslareas these beds of vegetable matterwent down and over the great marshesthe water swept again bringing driftvegetation from higher levels to addto that already buried Then overthestdeposits the sand and mud and gravelwere laid up anew and the day soilfrom which the next rich growth wouldspring was spread nut on the surfaceThis process was repeated again andagain as often indeed as seams ofcoal in any coal bed Thus the conditions for the formation of coal weremade complete atmospheric air beingentirely excluded while the vegetablebeds underwent the processes of decomposition These processes went on under the water of the ocean under thesands of the shore under the new deposits of succeeding ages transformingthfi wood of the carboniferous era intothe coal of to dayNature is still making coal thoughunfortunately not at a rate anythinglike fast enough to make up for theconsumption of this product The processes maybe watched from beginning toend For this purpose one miiot firstgo to a peat bed which is simply an accumulation of the remains of

surroundedGeologists are of the opinion thct bituminous and anthracite coals vierfformed during the same period and under like conditions Originally thewere all bituminous but during theviolent contortions and upheavals otthe earths crust at the close of the carboniferous age the bituminous coals involved in that disturbance wenchanged by heat and pressure and thconsequent expulsion of volatile matter from bituminous to anthraciteCannel coal is a variety of bituminouscoal which burns with great freedomthe flames of it ifiording considerablelight It was called candle coal bytin English peopie who first used it asit often served as a substitute for can-die-The name became corrupted toearncl and hs so remained It ismore compact than ordinary bituminous coal and it can be wrought in a latheand polished A certain variety of itfound in Yorkshire England is manufactured into a kind of jewelry knownas jetDr Homer Greene gives an interesting description of the climate of Pennsylvania during the coal forming epochThe most remarkable features of thevegetation of that period were the sizeand abundance of it plants Trees ofthat time whose trunks were from oneto three feet in diameter and whichgrew to a height of from 40 to 1110 feetare represented at the present day bytvAfaUAy Hi rWON THE CHEAT RIVERScene in the If- irt of the Alleghany CoalRegionsimilar species whose steins are onlyi fraction of an inch in diameter andbut one to two feet high But at thattime all conditions were favorable fora rapid and enormous vegetablegrowth The air was laden with carbonwhich is the principal food of plantsso laden indeed that man could hothave lived in it The great humidity ofthe atmosphere was another elementfavorable to growth Vegetation neverlacked an abundance of moisture eitherat root or leaf Then too the climatewas universally warm Over the entire surface of the earth the heat wasgreater than it is to day at the torridzone With all these circumstances inits favor vegetation could not helpflourishing The iossil impressions ofmore than 500 different species of plantsthat grew at that time have been foundin the coal bedsThe most abundant of the plants ofthe coal forming era were the fernsTheir fossil remains are found in greatprofusion and variety in most of therocks of the coal bearing strata Therewas also the plant known as the treefern which attained a height of 20 or30 feet and carried a single great tuftof leaves at its too Next in importanceto the ferns were gigantic mosses resembling in kind the low club mossesof the present but vastly magnifiedThey doubtless comribute the greatestproportion of woody material to thecomposition of coal There were foresttrees and their fossil trunks have beenfound measuring from 100 to 130 feetin length and from six to ten feet indiameter There were also pines somewhat resembling those of to day whichprobably grew on high ground liesides these there were plants of thehorse tail family which grew up withlong reed like jointed stems to aheight of 20 feet or more and with adiameter of 10 or 12 inchesIt is claimed that coal vas mined inEngland before the Koman invasion byJulius Caesar The cinder heaps foundamong ruins of the time of Roman supremacy in the island appear to showthat coal was largely used by the peopleof mat age By the end of the thirteenth century bituminous coal wasburned to a considerable extent in London The oldest coal workings inAmerica are near Richmond Va It issupposed that coal was discovered andmined there as early as 1750 Traditionsays that a boy while hunting for crawfish chanced upon the outcrop of a coalbed which crosses the James river 12miles above Richmond was uegurt and by the year 1775 the coal wasin general use in the neighborhood Itplayed a part in the war for independenc by helping to make cannon balsand by 1780 it was being shipped toPhiladelphia and New York Duringthe late civil war these mines wereseized by the confederate governmentfor the purpose of procuring fuel andthey are stll largely productive jfliiflcoal bed has an area of about ISO squiinmiles and an average thickness of 2 1feet It is supposed to contain

Clyde steamship docksugged and perspired in their effortsto place it On the cars of the FloridaCentral Pennsula railroad attractedconsiderable attention recently andmany inquiries were made about it Itwas what is known to the paper manufacturing trade as a clipper and is thefirst of its kind ever shipped to FloridaThe machine weighed eight tons andwas to be used in crushing pine intopulp for papermakingWhat makes it of peculiar interest isthe fact that it marks the introductionof one of the most important industriesof the country to the state of Floridaand is the forerunner of a much largerplant to be erected at Pensacola in ashort time A gentleman who is interested in the Pensacola factory to someextent and whose brother is a leadingstockholder says that it will be onlya matter of time when Florida will beone of the leading centers of the papermanufacture of the country The secretof the shipment of this piece of machinery lies in the fact that it has beendemonstrated beyond the shadow of adoubt that paper can be made at aprofit out of pine fiber through a process but recently invented by a southerninventor whose name is Thomas whichenables those possessed of the secret toeliminate the resin from the woodThis process is known to but three persons and it has been decided to keepthis secret among three persons ratherthan to expose it by putting the patenton file in the patent ofiieeThe fattcry erected in Pensicola willhave when everything is completed andthe machinery all is place a capacity offour tons daily While this will amountto quite an output in the course of ayear it is a comparatively small plantJust at present nothing is being madeexcept what is known asmanila paperIt is however of excellent quality andcan be made at a cost that will enableit to compete wit any part of the United States in quality rd cheapness ofmanufacture The material from whichthe paper can be made Is abundant andgoods made in Jacksonville can be delivered in New York city or

of ail acfes as Rheumatism and to find a Reliable remedy for the same At last we have found it in 5 Drops manufactured by the Swanson Rheumatic Cure Company Chicago III The 5 DROPS has provenitself wonderful for its curative power in Rheumatism not as a Temporary Reliever only but toTKADE VARKgive a Permanent Cure even in chronic cases Sometime ago I hadamong others several Rheumatic cases under my treatment and prescribed for these patients the very best Remedies which I skillfully selected but without desirable results I then heard of 5 DROPS andof its Wonderful Cures and prescribed it to a few patients who found relief from its use within a few days After that I prescribed it to a greatnumler and to my surprise I will sav that in the course of Two or ThreeWeeks after they had used 5 DKOPS and 5 Drop Plasters theywere Cured Among these wre a few who had for a number of yearsbeen suffering with Chronic Rheumatism who had piloted themselvesaround on Crutches They came to mv office without Crutches and toldme they were perfectly Well They give all the credit to 5 DROPSand to 5 Drop Plasters and this is their testimony to the SwansonRheumatic Cure Company for their kindness and
