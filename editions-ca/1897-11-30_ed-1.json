Rheumatism
If the people generally knew the true
cause of Rheumatism there would be
no such thing as liniments and lotions
for this painful and disabling disease
The fact is Rheumatism is a disordered
state of the blood it can be reached
therefore only through the blood But
all blood remedies cannot cure Rheuma
tism for it is an obstinate disease one
k which requires a real Vleod remedy
something more han a mere tonic
Swifts Specific is the only real blood
remedy and promptly goes to the very
fijqttom of even the most obstinate case
jkike all other blood diseases the
doctors are totally unable to cure Rheu
matism In fact the only remedies
which they prescribe are potash amd
mercury and though temporary relief
may result these remedies produce a
stiffness of joints and only intensify the
disease Those who have had experience
with Rheumatism know that it becomes
more severe each year
The case of Mrs James Kell of 6n
Ninth Street 8 E Washington D C
should convince everyone that it is
useless to expect doctors to cure Rheu
matism Under recent date she writes
A few months ago I had an attack of
Sciatic Rheumatism in its worst form
The pain was so intense that my ner
vous system was prostrated and I was
for a long time perfectly helpless The
attack was an unusually severe one
and my condition was regarded as
being very dangerous
I was attended by one of the most
able doctors of Washington City who is
also a member of the faculty of the
leading college here He told me to
continue his prescription and I would
get well After having it refilled twelve
times and receiving not the least bene
fit I declined to take it longer
Having heard SSS Swifts Spe
cific recommended for Rheumatism
I decided almost in despair to give
it a trial After taking a few bot
tles I was able to hobble around on
crutches and very soon had no need
at all for them for SSS cured me
sound and well All the distressing
pains have left me my appetite has
returned and I am happy to be again
restored to perfect health
SSS never disppoints for it is made
to cure these deep rooted diseases which
are beyond the reach of all other reme
dies It cures permanenty Rheumatism
Catarrh Cancer Scrofula Eczema and
all other blood diseases It is the only
blood remedy guaranteed
