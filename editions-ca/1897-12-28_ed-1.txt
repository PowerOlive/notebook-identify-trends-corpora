with old Betsey Tucker andher faculties needed collecting1 herwounded pride soothingIf anything- could calm her ruffledold feelings the sights and sounds ofthat June day should have done so Theair was sweet and balmy the afternoonsun golden and the lengthening shadows soft on the green swardIt was one of those happy days whenthere did not seem anything to do andno particular reason why it should bedone when one felt as irresponsible asthe lazy little clouds that floated overhead and as careless of purpose as the3ellow butterfly which flickered abovethe field flowersThe uncertainty of spring was pastthe heat and burden of the summer notTel come It was that short betweentimes when nature for a few preciousweeks abandons her responsibilitiesand takes a blessed vacation invitingall her children to join in the revelryThe bees boomed and buzzed amongthe flowers which made gay the dooryard the birds twittered busily overhead but Mrs Collins ears and eyesresisted all temptations to be divertedBetsey Tucker had been very provokingShe allers used salt risins and asfor her pie crust twas heavy as hertread She givin me advice GoodlandOld Mr Buck doubled with rheumatism and tremulous with years limpedup the path and seated himself on the 1bench by Mrs CollinsWhy he said blinking at herthrough his steel bowed glasses youlook kind o het up Ms Collins Youmustnt LuiTy so with your age andfleshTaint hurry Mr Buck and I aintso old but I can hold my own yet thankyou Its iroperdence that has riz myblood Ive half a mind to pack up mytilings and leave the house and she aTucker with Tucker breedin andTucker manners I jest wish Mr Collins could a heard her this afternoonHed say Hannah you git right out ohereWhereasked Mrmight you think o goinBuck rubbing a meditativehand over his kneeMrs Collins waived the question itwas an embarrassing one There wasno hope of Mr Collins offering her ashelter the Greenhill graveyard hadheld him for 10 years Indeed therewas no one in the town norin the wideworld for that matter to whom MrsCollins could flee if she turned her backon the precincts of the town farmThe poorhouse might not be an aristocratic place in which to pass ones oldage but it was clean and comfortableand Mrs Collins knew it1 guess theres plenty who wouldtake me in she said evasively ButI dont care to be beholden to nobodyIll put up with a deal first If I hadwhats mine by good rights Id leavehere fast enough Taint just the placeI care to be inI guess thats the case with most ofus responded the old man with acracked laugh We aint any of ushere by choice Ms Collins but theresworse places than thisI aint complainin of the place MsChase is a mighty good woman andthere aint a speck o dht to be foundnot if- you should go down on yourknees and hunt for itMr Buck sighed It woiild take morethan the satisfaction of finding a speckof dirt to get him down on his poorstiff kneesXo eonitnued the old woman Iaint sayin anything against the housebut theres them in it who oughter betaught their placeAt this moment the gate opened and alittle girl came slowly up the ash pathholding her school books under herBrm She was delicate and prettyabout eight year old with quiet soberface and gentle movements Her dresswas clean and whole but plain in theextreme it hung limp and forlornabout her slender limbs and affordedample space for growthXow theres a little creetur whooughtnt to be here said Mr Buck asthe child vanished through the doorShe wants a mother to make her laughand spank her and put someon to herWell I dont know returned MrsCollins Ms Chase does well by herLettys got her life before her and shewont spend it all here Its old folkslike you and me Mr Buck who are inhere for the rest of our days and whohave known somethin better who feelit the mostThe two inmates sat on in the warmafternoon air Old Mr Buck dozedpeacefully off but Mrs Collins did notyield to the drowsy influenceAs the sun went over into the westand its light grew more and moregolden softening everythingby its gracious touch the old womans thoughtsbecame reminiscent instead of vindictive and Betseys aggravating remarksno longer rankled within herEven the scenes about her faded fromher conscious gaze She was not sittingat the poorhouse door the little porchwas her own The yard dwindled into atiny patch of brlglrWmed flowers shutfrom the dusty thorougMare by a smallwhite gateHer eyes so faded and dim now weretjA--SOXe-vvbright and alert as they gazed into thestreet watching for some oneIts most time for William she murmured half aloud but the very act ofspeaking drove the pleasant memoriesfrom her mind and the reality wasforced upon herThe big bell rang out its summons tosupper swung by Mrs Chases capablehand and the two old folks en thebench roused to the present rose to respond to its pallIf there was only a place in theworld I could call my own thoughtMrs Collins If it warnt nothing buta shanty I wouldnt complain Thismay be comfortable but it aint homeit aint home And she went in toher evening mealGreenhill poorhouse were thrown intoa great state of curiosity and excitement Mrs Collins had a caller a gentleman with whom she was closeted inMrs Chases own sitting room forhours Up and down the narrow hallthe old folks hobbled peering and listening Dim eyes and dull ears werestrained to catch any bit of satisfaction and tongues wagged accordinglybut nothing could be made of the situationOne or two glimpses were caught ofthe object of all this interest hurryingto and fro from parlor to bedroom looking most flurried and importantWell never git a word outer her tillshes a mind to let on sighed BetseyShes dretful close mouthed I wontask her not if I dieAt dinner Mrs Collins place was vacantThe large clean kitchen with itsshining yellow painted floor and sunnywindows offered a cheerful eatingroom for the inmatesMrs Chase sat at the head of thetable active and impressive she did noteat with the paupers but she alwayspresided over their mealsThe inmates manifested an air of suppressed curiosity Mrs Chase that ofwithheld informationAt last Betsey could stand the pressure no longerAint Ms Collins well piped sheLord shes well enough rejoinedMrs Chase dealing out the beef stewwith a liberal hand But she wont betaking her vittles with the likes of usany more Then after a pause calculated to make the announcementmore startling she added Shes hada fortune left herBetsey choked and nearly strangledThe news quite took away her breathit exceeded her wildest conjecturesA fortune she gaspedYes said Mrs Chase important inher knowledge A cousin she aintheard on for years has died out westand she bein the only livin relative themoney falls to her I dont know jesthow much it is but by what the lawyersaid I reckoned it was a heap Shesgoin down to the Greenhill hotel thisafternoon hired the best room for aweek Oh I can tell you theres nomore of us for her This aint the kjndof a place people withfortunes staysmLittle Letty dropped her spoon in herstew spattering the clean scrubbedtable and calling down upon herself areproof from Mrs ChaseMrs Collins going away she saidtimidly Mrs Collins had been good toherGoin away Well why should shestay at the town farm Id like to knowwhen shes rollin in money and candrive her span answered Mrs ChaseMr Buck giave his cracked little laughSomehow the picture of stout Mrs Collins wrestling with a pair of livelyhorses amused himNo continued Mrs Chaserisingand taking nn Indianpudding ffomthestove We wont see no more of MrsCollins I expect its as much as evershell speak to usUp in her little room Mrs Collins waspacking- her few belongingsHer movements were quick and nervous her cheeks flushed her eyes brightand her gray curls bobbing excitedljon her forehead Never before had anything so astounding befallen herFor ten years those whitewashedwalls had limited her world for tenyears she had longed for somethingmore than their bareness could affordNow she was to leave them foreverHer unexpected inheritance was notof the proportions described by MrsChase but it was ample enough to secure her a comfortable home and attendanceHer eyes wandered out of the narrowpane to the hill slope which was driftedwith daisies and golden with buttercupsThis window has the sightliest viewin the house she said to herself andshe sighed a little I wonder whollhave it nowA little old trunk stood open on thefloor A shabby trunk of rusty blackstudded with dull brass headed nailsits once bright paper lining faded andtorn Even its small capacity was nottilled The things she could call herown were so pitifully fewMrs Collins eyed its scanty contentsIll buy the best black cashmerethere is in the market Betsey Tuckermight as well have that brown shawlI shantl never use it ag ain She and mewont quarrel any more I guess Shewont feel like contradictin me noweven if she gits a chanceAbout four oclock that afternoon ahack drove up to the door of the poorhouse It had come to take Mrs Collinsand her belongings to the hotelThe inmates were out in full forceto see their former companion departThere were various feelingsrepresented in that little gathering envyjealousy a good deal of curiosity considerable importance that one of theirnumber should be so favored a largeshare of genuine good-feeling- for thefortunate one and real regret at thepartingMrs Collins shook hands all

have a house of my ownThe summer passed oncarnageleaving inGreenhill memories of parching dayswilting foliage and dusty roads Poorhouse Hill caught every little wind andthe air was fresher and cooler than inthe village below But no breeze wafted tidings of Mrs Collins and her newprosperity She never came near herold abodeThen autumn had its turn and thedrooping foliage blazed in a fire of redand gold a fire which burned out alltoo quickly leaving bare branches andbrown fields and heaps of shriveledleaves as its ashesOne bleak November day when thewind was raw from the east and theearth lay waiting for its white coveringMrs Collins again drove out in theGreenhill hack this time towards thepoorhouseHer portly figure was well clothedand instead of her old worn and rustycloak she was wrapped in a warm fur-trimmed garment Her face shone withan eager expressionThe inside of the carriage was heapedwith bundles and two good sizedtrunks behind threatened to break thestrap which held them to the rackThe driver urged his horses over therough frozen road but even liis persuasions in the shape of cluck and whipdid not quicken their speed enough tosatisfy the impatience of Mrs

have deserted their timeworn hard luck and no work in favor ofthe Klondike song and every other feminine or childish mendicant who hauntsback doors and street corners will makeuse of it this winter Nor is the Goneto the Klondike idea confined to thewomen and children by any meansThe authorities of the charitable societies are growing weary of Klondiketales of woe and the novelty of such narrations has long since worn- off for thedwellers in comfortable residencetricts Unless something new turns upto once more whet the public appetitesfor Klondike details of all kinds thetramps and beggars are likely to findtheir newest excuse growing decidedlystale before fhe season closesJust how and where the tramps andmendicants acquire the knowledgewhich enables them to take advantageof every public happening of note is aquestion which has always puzzled megreatly said a man who has grown oldin caring for and working among1 thepeople of this class in Chicago but thatthey do acquire

tramp tolose It is impossible to prove or disprove it and anything which pertainsto the Klondike is popular with the public just now And then too the idea ofthe wonderful finds of gold took possession of Weary Willies imagination beyond a doubt There is something aboutthe idea of large sums of money ormoneys worth which is attractive to the ordinary mans fancyespecialljr if he happens to possess

InterestinglyTreated by Gen StoneThe subject of state add for roadbuilding was touched on by Gen Stonein his address at the annual conventionof the National Road parliament HesaidThe provision of state aid is the onlypossible method by iMiich tihe stateand the corporate property of thecities can aid in the building- of roadsThroughout the United States thecities and corporations jso far as Iknow are quite willing to help and theonly question is how they can do itIt is of more vital importance to thecities to have good country Toads thanit is to tihe people of the country themselves Every ounce of food that isconsumed in the cities must come fromthe country and if the country roadswere wiped out to day the farmerscould go right on living but the peopleof the cities would have to scatter tomorrow tihey could not live a dayThey are beginning to realize it theyare beginning to feel that they wanta hand in the building of the roads andthey have a feeling of very warm interest A great many city people are going to the country tlhat formerly didnotg o at all and they wTould go a greatdeal more if they had good countryroads and state aid is the only measure that anv of us have been able to de-vr yji a9 JJBAD WISCONSIN ROADLocated Between Winneconne andsippivise by which city and corporate property can aid in the development of iixecountry roadsI was interested in what one gentleman said the other morning that in Msown township his village and his bankpaid three fourths of the township taxand that was a fair contribution Thatwas unquestionably fair so far as histownship was concerned but how aboutthe next township that has no villageand no bank We must look beyondour own immediate neighborhood wemust cultivate a wider citizenship andw fplintr ni wider citizenshin isfc tsrpwing a eeling that the favored lom caliliesmusthelp those not so favoredI am glad to say that the actual possession of good roads wherever I haveknown it has had a great effect in developing that kinder feeling and broader citizentship It has been a markedfact in New Jersey that the localitieswhich have taxed themselves to getgood roads are the first to vote to givestate aid to the localities that have notgood roads Many men say We seethe benefits of it we have the benefits of it and we can afford to help ourneighbors enjoy it And you will findthat the movement for state aid wherever it goes will help to develop abroader citizenshipI hope that some time federal aidwill broaden it still more I hope thatthe people of the United States in themore favored regions will feel disposed as they get the benefit of goodroads themselves to help confer thosebenefits upon the regions that have notthe advantages I believe that everystep taken every judicious step takentowards bringing about the aid of thefederal government towards generalroad improvement will help to developthat feeling all through the UnitedStates that we have got to considersomething beyond our own neighborhoods beyond our own counties andbeyond our own states We have gottolook over the whole field of the UnitedStates and see what the general government can do to help the people whomeed this kind of help everywhereORCHARD AND GARDENThe peach will thrive beston plum stockHoot pruning isgraftedone wav of dwarf-ing fruit treesFew kinds of fruit are easier grownthan -the cherryMulch the

incision in or through the bark will greatlyaccelerate root growth by startingnew roots Avoid top mutilation whenplanting and at all other times Theonly occasion for cutting a tree is toprevent forks Thinning the brancheswill prevent this Foliage is essential to root development Good topsare better than good roots Whentransplanting I care little whether atree has roots at all when plantingIt must have a top I will supply theroots How By giving it a good topXurserymen have long instructed theirpatrons to conform the top to matchthe roots Bah There never was agreater mistake More than 20 yearsago in root grafting apples I experimented with scions of water sproutsfour or five feet Jong on bits of rootsnot over an inch in length They grewreadily The roots of a tree are onlynecessary to start growth and hold thetree in an upright position until rootsare formed The last apple orchard Iplanted the trees were the large overgrown ones that were unsalable Theywere four years old and so large thattwo men were necessary to handleThey were carried from the nurseryand roots closely trimmed Not abranch of the top was touched withsaw or knife This was in 18S6 In1890 these trees bore an immense cropand being sold on the trees wereguessed by the purchasers at two barrels of marketable fruit per treeWestern Fruit GrowerPROTECTION FOR TREESAn Effective Guard Wlilcn Costs But aFew

Carolinalocated nearto the state line and not far from Charlotte N CM have lost much trade of lateas the farmers prefer to haul over thegood roads into another state in preference to using the poor

Requirements ofOcean Passenger SteamerFirst class passengers must have alarge and handsome dining saloon indeed the commissariat departmentcould not be managed at all if it werenot dealt with en bloc The ladies musthave a drawing and music room Thestudious must have a library Themcnmusfhave a smoking room Everybodymust have a bed and all must haveroom for exercise in the open air wheninclined for it Similar but less elaborate conveniences must be providedfor those who wish to travel in the sameship but who are unable or unwillingto pay the highest fare In many casesa third class of accommodations is givenfor emigrants and those to whom costis a matter of the first moment According to their several ranks all thesepassengers must be waited upon so thata large body of stewards and servantsmust be carried in addition to the crewof navigators and engineersWith this large number of people tobe fed cooking arrangements of themost elaborate and complete kind mustbe made Provisions must be stored insuch a manner as to remain fresh andgood throughout the voyage and forthis purpose steam refrigerating machinery and bold storage chambers areusually provided at the expense of someof the cargo space A practically unlimited supply of fresh water must be allowed to everybody on board and yetthe arrangement for its supply must besuch that everything like waste shallbe preventedThe passenger is by nature a grumbler and being shut up for days together on an island from which thereis no escape with little occupation butto find fault he must be an angel indeed if he uttered no complaint It isthe constructors province if possibleto shut his mouth by anticipationThis huge floating caravansary hasto be lighted warmed and ventilatedThe progress in lighting by incandescent electric lamps without vitiatingthe atmosphere has- been an immenseadvantage to passenger steamers eventhough it be a costly lightThe maintenance of an equable temperature with pure fresh air free fromdraughts warm enough in cold climates and cool enough in hot latitudespresents almost insurmountable difficulties Where spaces are so contractedand nooks and corners so numerous theair must lie quiescent unless disturbedby currents too violent to be admissible and it is to be feared that even inthe best vessels there must still be asmell of the ship shippy In recentpractice all unnecessary
