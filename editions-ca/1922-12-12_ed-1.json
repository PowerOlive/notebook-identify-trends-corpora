"STTNNY LEN" A VISITOB -
Many Paris people wijl remember
"Sunny Len" Lanius, of Cincinnati,
who makes Paris a visit "eyery year,
spreading the doctririe.kof optimism
and sunshine, and incidentally, tak
ing care of his business interests.
Mr. Lanius while here was a guest
of his good friend, Dr. William
Kenney. He is part owner- of tne
Central Optical Co., of Cincinnati,
but says that is merely a side issue,
as his reaj mission is to. spread sun
shine around. '
Mr. Lanius was for several years
champion lightweight wrestler ' of
the United States, and is a "past
master in the art of jui jitus, the
Japanese art of self-defense, though
he uses an entirely different system
from that employed by Japanese
teachers. He has written several
books on the subject and on health
topics and is recognized as one of
the leading exponents of health and
jexercise, in the country. While in
Paris last October Mr. Lanius gave
a lecture and demonstration on
health topics to the pupils of the
Paris schools, which were highly
commended.
