With a continuation of the re
markably and almost unprecedented
fine weather that has favored . the
Latonia Jockey Club during the first
part if its autumn meeting it is Rea
sonably certain that the season will
be prolonged until Saturday, Novem
ber 30, thus affording the race pat
rons sixteen days of racing instead
of the ten days' session that would
terminate the meeting Saturday, No
vember 23.
From the present outlook it would
appear that there is no obstacle in
the way of accomplishing this, un
less it be a decided change in weather
conditions toward the end of the pres
ent week. However, horsemen and
race-goers can rest assured that Gen
rela Manager John Hachmeister will
have the meeting continued to the
latter date if such a-step is at all pos
sible. Inasmuch as the Kentucky
State Racing Commission's rules pre
scribe that there be no racing in the
State after December 1, and prior 'to
April 1, Mr. Hachmeister would be
within his rights in keeping the meet
ing going to November 30.
The meeting so far has been one
of the best in the track's history, and
this despite the rather pessimistic
outlook prior to the opening due to
the postponements, and the very late
date in finally getting the season
started. Manager Hachmeister is ac
cordingly greatly encouraged, and is
going to redouble his efforts to give
the club's patrons an even better
grade of racing the repiaining days
of the meeting.
