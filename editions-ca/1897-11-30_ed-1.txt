official publications against which considerable complaint has been made by thetrade journals of the country will becalled to the attention of congress atits coming session The trade journals complain of the practice as an unfair competition on the part of the governmentThe latest cause for irritation is arecent publication by the bureau entitled Commercial Directory of theAmerican Republics of which therewill be two volumes of about 2500pages each It is estimated that theadvertising contained in the bulletinsof the bureau and in the commercialdirectory will amount to 80000The practice of canvassing for advertisments for the bureau publications was originated by the formerhead of the bureau Mr Clinton Furbush and has never been legally prohibited It is defended on the score ofnecessity

Afterworking on the flames for half an hourthe firemen succeeded in getting theflames under control The building isbadly gutted and a large portion ofthe machinery damagedThe president in his message will itis expected devote more attention toAlaska than has been given to the bigterritory heretofore since its purchaseIt is known that the executive willrecommend speedy legislation to secure the best possible government forAlaska and that he will also take occasion to point out the difficulties which the people are underand will urge that something shouldalso be done to protect the property ofthe government In this connectionhe will allude to the fact that the government is losing large sums becausethere is no way of protecting thetimber from indiscriminate useCommissioner Herman of the general land office has submitted information on this point to the president and has also taken occasion torecommend some radical changes inthe laws pertaining to the permit system for cutting timber

and if he thinks we have lost something of intrinsic value -he may tell us alot of lies Usually they do all thc3 canto aid a detectiveAh I see answered Whidby Ishould have blundered there if I hadbeen aloneThe dealer a little Jew with a verycrafty face came from behind a counter piled up high with sacks of rags andpaperWhat can I do for you gentlemenhe askedIn a few words Hendricks explainedwhat they were searching forAh and j ou want to catch him ehAYell I hope you can said the JewI think I know the bags I got fromdere They are up in the loft I willthrow them down and vou can lookthrough

said Here is a note addressed to me and there are some oldbills of uncles But after five minutes search he declared he saw no envelope which looked like the one he hadin mind The second bag was searchedwithout success but the third had hardly been opened before Whidby pickedup a large square envelopeI think this must be it he saidYou are right it matches the colorof the paper They must have

it Whidby questioned1 dont know myself said the detective I have seen something likethis before but I cant tell where ByJove it will drive me crazy if I dontmake it out There is something aboutthis envelope that is familiar but iteludes me like the memory of a nightmare But Ill get it after awhileLeave me you and your man Ill walkback alone I want to tussle with thething I shallsee you as soon as I cometo any conclusionCHAPTER XTVHalf an hour afterwards the detective arrived at his hotel and went up tohis room His face still wore a lookof deep perplexity He sat down at awindow and stared at the envelopesteadily for ten minutes Then therewas a rap at the dcor It was a servantto say that Capt Welsh was downstairsand that he was anxious to see himSend him up said Hendricks andhe put the envelope into his pocketHe picked up a newspaper two or threedays old and was hidden behind itwhen the captain rappedCome in the detective called outI am sorry to disturb you beganWelsh but the truth is we are makingI so little headway that the mayors people are showing a- good deal of impatience Mrs Roundtree says we areentirely too slow and she is laying itall on me and my men The mayorhimself has just left my office Ofcourse I could not tell him what yoususpected about his daughter andI should think not captain sinceyou yourself dont know what I do ordo not suspect And Hendricks threwhis paper on the floorOf course o course but arent youreally going any further with your investigations up there I thought whenI told you that I spent the night in frontof the house and saw her come out andsecure the revolver from the grassthatHendricks broke into a low laughbent forward and rubbed his hands between his kneesYou didnt see me captain thatnight We were both a pretty pair offools I

Morethangood helived In NottoofastAnd tho to save his native land he neverdrew a swordHe was what all lils tenants called a mightyline landlordWheneer a tenant chanced to break a paneor two of glassHe never used to storm and rave or murmur out Alas IBut he would go and buy some more Insunshine or In rainOr if it was at zero and hae them setagainNo matter if in room or hall the papershould get tornHe would not as some landlords do complain from night till mornAnd if the paint jgoLscarred and soiled thefirst thing he would doWas send and have the painter come andpaint the house anewNo matter if a faucet froze or if got cloggeda drainIt made no difference to him he neverwould complainAnd if a tenant short of wood should burnthe cellar stairsN He always thought It sweet delight tomake such small repairsAnd if a tenant should neglect to close aswinging blindAnd it should be thrown from its place bythe fierce winter windAnd tumbling to the walk below somepasser by should killHe would not say one unkind word but goand pay the billAnd ere the morning light broke forth hefrom his bed would riseAnd not with thunder in his tone nor angerin his eyesBut with a rosy shade of joy upon his

points for the treatmentof his porkship after he becomes suchthat every housekeeper can bear inmind with advantage to herself Th2sepoints succinctly stated are Thatwestern pork is better than the easternbecause it is corn fedThat in ordering pork for roast youshould always call for young porkThat the reason some pork cookedwith beans cooks away to a sea ofgreasy crumbly fat is because it isfrom an old hogThat the way to distinguish youngpork when buying is that salt porkfrcm young pigs or yearlings is firmhard and close in texture and its skini thin and smooth while that from aneld residenter is rough scaly and fullof bristlesThat clear white pork is better thanthat with a pinkish or yellowish tingeThat pork tenderloin alone is tasteless and has to be treated with varioushigh condiments to be made palatableThat in boiling a ham you shouldadd one cup of vinegar and one cup ofsugar That the liquor in which hamis boiled makes a good foundation forpea soup That is it much cheaper tobuy a fresh shoulder of pork and cornit for yourself allowing one gallon ofsalt to five gallons of waterThat pork drippings make one of thebest frying mediums for chickens orfish That apple sauce should alwaysbe an accompaniment for roast porkThat cold roast pig sliced thin isalmost equal to the breast of turkeyThat the leaf lard from the kidneysfcris best That old or very salt hamshould be parboiled five minutes beforei broilingThat fried ham cooked too long willbecome hard and dry WashingtonStarCharity of SpeechCharity of speech is as divine a thingas charity of action To judge no

over hills andmountains with grades of 10 to 15 feetin 100 instead of following valleysskirting hills and making gradual windt ing ascents keeping as close as possibleto a four per cent gradeThe Square Corner tax is common onthe prairies and in level districts Itconsists in traveling for instance sevenmiles north and then seven miles eastto reach a point that is but ten milesnortheast in a straight line In sucha case 40 per cent of the actual distance is added The average distanceadded in this way between any twoi points throughout the country is 20per centThe Mud tax is due to having softroads insufficiently drained and generally repaired by having the sodstones and earth from the g uttersthrown on them once a year when roadtaxes are being worked outThe Fence tax arises from the

needed in this operation is tocut back each main branch to a healthylateral branch which will serve to attract and elaborate by means of itsleaves a sufficient flow of sap to insurethe growth of the

with Great Britain andOther European CountriesThe imperial statistical office at Berlin has just published a detailed account of the commercial relations ofGermanj to foreign states in the year1896 In that year Germanys exportsto Great Britain British India Australia and Canada amounted in value to908000000 marks while the importsfrom the same countries -and from theBritish West Indies amounted to 931000000 marks To Great Britain aloneGermany exported to the value of 715000000 marks and from Great Britainalone she imported 614000000 marksVery different are the statistics of German trade relations with British Indiaand with Australia The exports tothose destinations amounted to 78000000 marks while the imports thencereached a value of no less than 270000000 marks In view of tAese figures thetv conclusion is drawn that Germanjrneed not fear in the case of BritishIndia and Australia any attempt tohamper her export trade as she is in aposition to retaliate with effect In thecase of Canada however Germany is ata disadvantage Her imports from thatcountry only amounted to 3000000marks while she exported 15000000marks worth of goods to British NorthAmerica The results of commercialtreaties with Russia and Austria-Hungaryare strikingly illustrated by thenew statistics In 1S92 German exportsto Russia had reached a total value of239000000 marks In 1893 durin g thesecond half of which the tariff warwith Russia prevailed the value of German exports to that country fell off tothe figure of 1S5000000 marks Afterthe commercial treaty came into forcein March 1894 the rise in- exports toRussia was constant and the past yearthey reached a total of 364000000marks To Austria the amount of German exports in 1S91 the year before theconclusion of the commercial treatywas 348000000 marks It rose in 1S92the first year of the commercial treatyto 377000000 marks and last year to477000000 marks N Y PostA Phenomenal IslandA most phenomenal island is that ofBornholm in the Baltic belonging toDenmark It is famous for its geological peculiarities consisting as itdoes almost entirely of magnetite andits magnetic influence is not onty verywell known to the navigators of thosewaters but also much feared by themon account of its influence on the magnetic needles which makes the steering of a ship correctly a matter of muchdifficulty In fact this influence is felteven at a distance of miles and beingsighted by -mariners on the Baltic theyat once discontinue steering theircourse by the needle and turn insteadto the well known lighthouses andother holds to direct their craft Between Bornholm and the mainlandthere is also a bank of roclc under water which is very dangerous to navigation and because of its being constantly submerged vessels have been frequently wrecked at that point Theleculiar fact in this case is that themag netic influence of this ore bank isso powerful that -a magnetic needle suspended freely in boat over the bankwill point down if not disturbedwill remain in a perfectly perpendicular line Chicago ChronicleHer Idea of rtA Hudson N Y lady recently tookInto her household a 12-year-old cirlwho had been brought up in the Brooklyn orphan

a general merchandise store Itssurroundings are peaceful and farfrom what they once were The townoccupies a great hill overlooking theMissouri river Nearly 90 years ago itwas built as a fort and it was once thescene of probably as heroic a littlestruggle as ever occurred in MissouriSome years after the fort had beenbuilt probably during the progress ofthe war of 1812 Baptiste Roi an oldFrenchman and his wife and four hunters occupied the fort and they were besiegedby more than 200 Osage IndiansIt seems the Indians knew of the desperate straits in which Roi and hiscompanions were placed and they assaulted the fort with great fiercenessThe men were Indian fighters andfortunately their assailants were notarmed with rifles and Rio and the hunters used their guns with such rapidityand effect that they soon drove the Indians back to the woods The fort hadbeen built expressly to resist such assaults but unfortunately the inmateswere compelled to depend upon theriver for their water supply and the Indians suspected as much for they kepta sharp watch on the river with a partof their numbers while the remainderendeavored to set fire to the fortressThere was a small supply of water inthte fort and for two days and nightsthe whites preserved their strongholdintactThe Indians became exasperated atthe stubborn resistance of the handfulof whites and they tried a general rushwith a view of setting fire to the fortIn this latter undertaking they succeeded but it cost- them dearly forwhile they were applying xhe torch therifles of the whites were busy and soonthe Indians were driven back to coverand the fire was presently extinguishedThen the performance was repeatedseveral times and until every drop ofwater the whites had was exhaustedand the fort was again on fireOld man Roi and the men then gaveup in despair and prepared to sell theirlives as dearly as possible Meantimethe formers wife was busy huntingamong her milk crocks and in an oldchurn and she managed to raise enoughsour milk to extinguish the flames andwhile she was doing so the men kept theIndians at a saftj distance with theirriflesStrange as it may seem the Indianswere so disheartened at this criticalstage in the defense of the fort thatthey withdrew carrying their deadand wounded with them No one in thefort was injuredIt had been learned at St Louis thata large body of Indians had attackedCote Sanddessein and of the desperateand successful resistance made by thebrave inmates The St Louis peoplepresented Roi with a fine rifle inlaidwith gold and silver and suitably inscribed and his brave old wife whoreally saved the fort was suitably rewarded with a handsome presentCote Sanddessein is not much largernow than it was when old Baptiste Roiand his party fought the Osages andmany stirring scenes were enactedthere while the Indians strove with thewhites for possession of the countrybut none were deemed more deservingof praise even in those days whenbloody encounters between the whitesand the red men were common than thedefense made by old Baptiste Roi Itwas known that he and his partj killeda large number of Indians for they wereall expert marksmen and used to suchencounters St Louis
