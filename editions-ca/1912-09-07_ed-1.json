Will Not Receive Appeals.
Superintendent of Public Instruction
Barksdale Hamlett declines to take
iursidiction ;of appeals fiom county
superintendents' rulings regarding
contests foi the office of district
scnool trustee. Prof. Hamlett cites a
decision of the Court of Appeals, mak
ing the decision of the county superin
tendent final until the cases are passed
upon by the courts, as they involve the
rights of persons to hold office.
Several cases were before him, the
Drincipal ones of which were from Pike
countv. Division No. 2 of that county
furnibhed the hardest fought cases,
with B. P. Johnson and W. B. John
son, brothers and prominent men, on
opposite aides. B. P. Johnson appeal
ed against Robert Mullins 111 the Shel
by Creek district of that division and
K. P. Bentley against G. W.
from another district
vision.
Last Notice.
Having notified all my customers
who have accounts that are unpaid,
both by mail and collector I feel that
I have done my duty and that they
should not feel hurt it same are placed
in the hands of an attorney. I need
the money due me at once and must
have it. So I take this method of
making one last appeal for settle
ments. All accounts not settled y
the fifteenth of September will be
placed in the hands of an attorney
for immediate collection.
Repectfully,
MRS. CORNE WATSON BAIRD.
