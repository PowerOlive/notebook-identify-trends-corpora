NICKEL. -
A scientist of the Bureau of Mines
has just issued a report on nickel, in
which he points to the great possi
bilities of this metal as a material
for kitchen utensils and cooking pots.
Besides the standard iron pots, cop
per and aluminum pots have found
favor in the kitchen. Great care is
necessary in the use of copper, and
aluminum to be satisfactory must be
so heavy that tlie price is high.
Nickel has practically all the good
qualities of either of the other mate
rials; it is reasonably cheap, takes
a beautiful finish, can easily be elec
troplated and does -not corrode. An
increasing use of nickel in the kitch
en is looked for.
