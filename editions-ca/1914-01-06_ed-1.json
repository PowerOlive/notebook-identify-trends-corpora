The year 1913 has closed and we
have opened a new year. Millers
burg, like every other place, has un
dergone numerous changes, some of
them very marked. A number of
prominent citizens, including J. H.
Linville, John W. Mock, J. C. Lay
son, William Petersonf"G. F. Jones,
have given up their vocations in life
and lie peacefully at rest in the cem
etery. Other prominent ones have
moved from our community, among
whom are Joel W. Mock and family,
U. S. G. Pepper and family, and oth
ers. There have also been many
mercantile changes. Mr. Joel W.
Mock having disposed of his furniture
and undertaking business to Mr. W.
E. Pruitt, Mr. S. H. Endicott his gro

T. P. Wadell, the one occupied by
Elder C. O. Cossaboom, the new col
ored Methodist church, which would
be a credit to any town, and the col
ored Baptist church. We have a
healthy town and community, and all
kinds of business has prospered here
during the year just ended. Rev. A.

Some Profit
A handful of raw pig iron, weighing
about five pounds, is worth five cents.
From it 60 table-knife blades can be
made, of a value of $15. Converted
into steel watch springs, there can be
about 110,200 of those tiny coils made
from it. They sell for $1.75 a dozen,
which would bring the neat sum of
$16,070.83 for the five cents' worth of
raw metal. Browning's Magazine.
MARSH PREDICTS TWO FLOODS.
W. W. Marsh, the Winton Place,
O., prophet, predicts- that 1914 will
be a year of damaging storms, al
though much more peaceful than 1913
HQt so many strikes, and not such
severe floods and other catastrophes.
Two floods are forecasted one in
February and one in March. The
months of January and February,
Marsh says, -will bring heavy sleet
and snow storms. The coming sum
mer will be ideal, he says, the heat
waves being relieved by cooling
waves.

Americans, as a rule, do not know
very much about the Greeks who
come among them. They see them
engaged in various industries sell
ing fruit, . operating shoe-shining
"parlors", serving as waiters and
bellboys, sometimes in higher posi
tions and their efficiency in their
seVeral occupations is indicated by
the fact that their services are sat
isfactory enough not to be criticized.
The average American accepts the
services as a (matter of course and
thinks little about those who render
them. If he takes heed of the men
at all,-he sees keen, clear, dark eyes
and fine, dark faces, and if he opens
conversation he is likely to be sur

wonder what the "problem" is that ' acres- The Price realized is said, to
concerns tliem.
According to the Eastern and West
em Review, a magazine published in
Boston in the, interest of the Greeks
in America and printed in English,
most of the transplanted citizens of
the classic land a.o greatly ' disap
pointed wlLh-enr country, not finding
here the opportunities they expected,
but, once here,, they s.tay and make
the best of things. Some of them are
highly educated, ana members of this
class particularly find it hard to
establish themselves, often being
forced to take inferior positions. A
porter or "bellboy" in a hotel may
possess scholarship far beyond that
possessed by pretentious persons
whose baggage he carries.
Many tales of heroism are told of
the Greek soldiers who took part in
the recent Balkan war, large numbers
of them returning from the United
States in order to' participate. They
had. not heralded their loyalty to
their native land as many other for
eigners in America have done, but
they showed their patriotic spirit by
their conduct. Mention is made of
one man, who had been a banana
peddler in New York, who is now
commanding a regiment, and others
who had been in humble occupations
here died like heroes.
A writer in the Review praises the
soldiers highly. They are temper
ate; they endure hardships well;
they are brave and intelligent. An
other characteristic is their love
reading. They take an interest in
international as well as home affairs,
and are especially interested in their
national poetry. According to this
writer thoy are worthy descendants
of the Homeric Greeks. So far as
reading is concerned, the statement !
is sustained by the fact that tv
daily papers in the Greek language
are published in New York, showing
a demand for current news. It may
be that in this comparatively new
element in the "melting pot," a de
sirable addition is to be made to the
American character.
