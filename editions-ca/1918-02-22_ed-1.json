from another paper, there appeared
in this department last Tuesday an
item to the effect that Cadet Gro
ver Kyle, Jr., a student at the M. M.
L, had been taken to his home in
Harrodsburg, threatened -with ty
phoid fever. A card to Major Best
stated that young Kyle was abou
to teturn to school, and that his ill
ness was but slight, and not due to
typhoid fever.)

"A- finer group of men I've never

BUY THRIFT STAMPS.
HOLD YOUR LIBERTY BOOTS
Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo
urges the purchase of Liberty Loan
Bonds of both the First and Second
issues to hold fast to their bonds.
They are the best investment in the
world.
The Secretary's statement was call
ed forth by the fact that Liberty
Bond holders are being approached
from time to time by agents seeking
to induce them to part with their
Liberty Loan Bonds and take in ex
change securities which in a num
ber of cases are of a very questiona
ble value, and was prompted by the
desire to protect the bondholders
against ill-advised disposition of
their bonds.
The Secretary expresses the hope
that every purchaser of a Liberty
Patriotism demands and thrift
commends the purchase of Thrift
Stamps. This is a time when evervBond wil1 realize that the only gen-
lover of his country should be look
ing for a chance to help his country.
He should be glad to pay in service
and money the interest due his Gov
ernment on the help rendered him by
his Government. It is not a time to
ask "How much interest can I get out
of my Government?." but "How much
interest have I in my Government?"
Not "How much can I do my coun
try for?" but "How much can I dD
for my country?" The answer is,
Buy Thrift Stamps almost any place
in Paris. '
As a general thing when a girl has
a brother and a sweetheart in the
army she lets mother knit for
brother.
uine help that he gives his Govern
ment is keeping his bond as an in
vestment so long as it is possible for
him to do so. He states, however,
that no just objection lies to the
sale of a Liberty Bond where real
necssity exists for its sale.
Another reason why bananas are
so popular in the tropics is that it
isn't niuch work to shell them.

GERMANY AIDING SLANDER OF
AMERICAN TROOPS.
(Louisville Courier-Journal.) '
In his impressive speech defending
the War Administration against the
attacks o Senator Chamberlian and
others, Senator James quoted a letter
from the Rev. Geo. Wood Anderson
to a citizen of Marion, Ky., in which
the evangelist, recently returned
f roni work among our troops abroad,
said "that our Government is doing ,
everything possible to safeguard the J
health and morals of our boys in'
France, and they are the best-cared
for soldiers in the world."
The other night in Flint, Mich., a
speech was made by Dan Reed, who
left his work at managing director
of the Flint Board of Commerce to
make a personal " investigation uf
conditions among our forces in
France. His report was most heart
ening. Here is an extract from his
speech, as printed in the Flint
Daily Journal:
"You probably have heard some of
these stories about our boys over
there not living right. You prob
ably understand where a lpt of these
stories started,
" 'Germany,' said two or three in
the audience.
"Gerjmany! echoed the speaker.
Germany is using every possible
means to influence opinion in the
United States. She is spending
$50 0,000 in Switzerland alone every
year to have such stories spread to
this country. There is no way of
telling s how much. 1 money fe being
