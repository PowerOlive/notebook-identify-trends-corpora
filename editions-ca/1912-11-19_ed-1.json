inevitable that they will droD by the
wayside. Don't get discouraged. That

have a good start, stick and see the
fight through ; you are worthverv lit

stares you in the face, that is the time
when something will occur to change
the conditions entirely. No matter

The Disraelis were visiting Strath
fieldsaye in the time of the old duke
of Wellington. Going up to 'the bed
room, Disraeli found his wife and her
maid moving the bed from one side of
the room to the other. When he in
quired the reason, his wife said:
"Well, my dear, the duke sleeps on the
other side of the wall, and if I lie
against it I can boast that I have
slept between the two greatest men in
England." San Francisco Argonaut

Colored People Raise Funds lor
Hospital Annex.
With the view of raising funds with
which to ecmin the annex fur the color
ed people at the W. W. Massie Memo
rial Hospital, n Wbite Addition, the
colored DeoDle recentlv held a mass
meeting, and succeeded in securing
tne sum oi $8U6 of the 51,500 that will
be necessary for the purpose.
The trustees of the institution,
which have the construction of the
building under supervision, plannedto
erect an annex for the colored people,
but a sufficient fund was not available
and their original intention was aban
doned. From the original sum be
queathed for the purpose by the late
Mrs. Annie Massie, inheritance lax
and necessary charges made in the old
G. G. White property, consumed a
larger sum than was first anticipated,
so this dpeartmeut was left until some
fuure time.
The public spirited colored people of
Paris at the meeting held "recently
perfected an organization for the pur
pose of soliciting funds to use in the
work of equipping a department for
the suffering members of their race.
The officers of the organization are :
J. B. Redmond, President; H. C.
Smith, First Vice President; H. B.
Webster. Second Vice President; D.
C. Mebane, Third Vice President ; Dr.
J. H. Sebree, Secretary; French
Thompson, Treasurer; Finance Com
mittee. Dr. J. D. Mebane, Lucy Ha
den, E. J. Mickens.
The meeting was held at the St.
Paul M. E. Church, and was addressed
by Dr. A. H. Keller, who is taking an
active part in assisting the colored
people in the work thev have under
taken. Fraternal organizations and
clubs subscribed sums ranging from
$25 to $125, and private subscriptions
from 50 cents to $25 were received,
bringing thetotaljjto $806, a little more
than half of the amount nceessary for
the work.
Advice to Alpine Climbers.
In the earlier part of the nineteenth
century many even of those who had
been up Alpine peaks themselves de
nounced the sport. Regarding the as
cent of Mount Blanc, Murray's Hand
book in the year 1838 stated that "all
who have succeeded have advised no
one to attempt it," and nearly 20
years later noted the "remarkable
fact that a large proportion of those
who have made this ascent have been
persons of unsound mind."

Angels on a Needle's Point.
This was a favorite topic of debate
among the scholiasts and doctors of
the Christian church from the earliest
time. It was particularly to the fore
during the period of futile and quib

decline of scholasticism, say from 1300
to 1450 A. D.

SIMON DEPT STORE.
Prevention of Mildew.
Nothing should be stored in a damp
condition on aecount of mildew,
which is a vegetable growth, being a
kind of fungus, which quickly spreads,
and is very difficult to remove. To
remove it from flannel etfcer is best to
use. For mildew on cotton material,
damp the part, rub soap thickly on,
cover with powdered French chalk
and put in the sunshine, and keep re
peating the process until the spots
disappear.
New England Romance.
From Boston comes the story of a
touching phonograph romance. The
manager of a store became Infatuated

frequently in the machines, wrote to
her for her pictures, and the acquaint
ance speedily ripened into marriage.
The bride, by the way, was intending
to study in Paris for grand opera, but
ha3 decided to settle down in New
England. San Francisco Argonaut.
THEATRICAL.
"A THOROUGHBRED TRAMP."
"A Thoroughbred Tramp," which
will be the attraction at the Paris
Grand on November 20 is a powerful
comedy drama telling a beautiful atory
combining humor, pathos, heart inter
est and thrilling realism. There is- a
strong vein of comedy a laughable
nature tnat more than pleases.
The story, it is said, is written
around incidents of a celebrated case
ot New York life, well written and
not unreal or stagey. It is one of the
best comedy dramas of today written
by playright who has given the public
some of the very best dramas of recent
years. "A Thoroughbrea Tramp" will
be presented by a competent company
with the eminent emotional actress,
Miss Josephine Wowsey, in the leading
feminine role, and supported by such
people as Louise Wren, of Jekyl! and
Hyde" fame, Hal Williams Frank
Carman and others in the cast.
The quiet home is a fitting atmos
phere. One feels at home by the fire
side with the devoted young husband
and wife; shudders at tha entrance of
the villain whose only purpose is to
destroy the reputation of the hubsand
in order to get possession of another's
wife. One cannot help but admire the
fidelity of the little waif to the sorrow
ing wife and glory in the unfailing en
ergy of "A Thoroughbred Tramp,
who finally runs the evildoers to the
end of their ropa and right triumpis
over might.

State Argicultural Commissioner
Newamn has decided to take steDs to
check the progress of the gvDsy moth
among the fruit trees of Kentucky
Some days ago the United States Gov
ernment notified Prof. Garman, at
Lexington, that some steps should be
taken . by the Kentucky authorities to
eradicate the pest, so as to prevent a
quarantine against Kentucky by other
States. Prof. Garman. having no
funds at his command in his depart
ment, notified the Governor, who, in
turn, referred the matter to tne Com
missioner of Agriculture. Mr. New
man says he has no funds a his com
mand for this specific purpose, but he
proposes to use some of the money at
his command for other denartments
to aid in the stamping out of the gyp
sy moth, if it is possible to do so.
The spreading of hemp in Bourbon
countv has already begun prenaratory
to rotting and -breaking it out. Ac
cording to reports Bourbon county will
have the largest crop in a decade, a
condition due mainly to the successful
tests made by the O'Neal hemp
breaking machine, invented by Frank
O'Neal, Jr., of this city. After seven
years of arduous labor he has perfec
ted the machine, which gives promise
of reviving the hemp growing industry
in this section of Kentucky, where the
majority of the hemp of the State is
grown, and which, owing to the inabil
ity of the growers to; secure labor to
break out the product and prepare it
for market, has been practically aban
doned. Tests made with the machine
last fall on the farm of J. N. Camden,
in Woodford county, revealed the fact
that, in addition to turning out hemp
fibre, rfee from hurds. it will break
hemp either green or rotted, and will
save the farmers a handsome sum on
each crcp.on accounfcof handling hemp
and preparing it for market that
which could not be broken out by the
hand breakers.
