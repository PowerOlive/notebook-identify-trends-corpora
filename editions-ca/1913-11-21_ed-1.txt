L. Steenbergen,or the PariR fins Sr TCiantvin rnwhich holds the franchise for the dis- jtribution of natural gas in this city,is in receipt of a letter from the officials of the Light & Development Co.,of St. Louis, which own and controlsthe local company, to the effect that the company accepts theterms of the city council regardingthe franchise which the company intends to operate under.At the last meeting of the councilan ordinance was passed which restricted the local company fromcharging an amount in excess of thej rate provided in the franchise granted the Central Kentucky Natural GasCo., and which was taken over by thelocal concern. In addittion to this thethe council acceded to the request ofthe officials of the Light & Development Co., and left in force the franchise held by the company, which wasgranted in 1910, and which providedfor a rate of $1.65 per thousand forgas.Following considerable agitation asto the possibility of the distributorsof natural gas in this citv. ODeratinerunder the franchise granted m 1910 !to the, Paris Gas & Electric Co., the!matter was taken up by Mayor Hinton, who to safeguard the interests ofthe city, compelled the officials, of theLight & Development Co. to elect under which franchise it would oferate.Mr. W. H. Beck, secretary of theLight & Development Co., came tothis city to confer with the officialsin an effort to straighten the entanglement, but after stating it was thepurpose of he company to operateunder the old franchise, a statementwas issued by Mayor Hinton in whichhe said the case would be carried tothe court of last resort in an effortto annul the old franchise and compelthe company to furnish natural gasto the consumers at the rate specified im the Tatter franchise.Following a call for a special meeting of the City Council to take immediate action, Mr. Beck requested thatthis action be deferred until he could!reuirmo si. iouis. Following hisvis Mr. W. S. Smith, President of theLight & Development Co., came toParis to appear before the Councilin the interest of his company and inan effort to bring about an amicable djustment. In his statementmade to ttie Council Mr. Smith declared it was never the intention ofhis company to operate under otherthan the recent franchise granted tothe Central Kentucky Natural GasCo., and which was purchased vy theconcern of which he was the head.The ordinance, which proved acceptable-toMr. Smith ,was read inthe Council, and after its passage bythe unanimous vote of the Board,Mr. Smuh, on behalf of his company,'agreed upon his return to St. Louis,to formally accept the terms and provisions of the ordinance before itcould go into effect.The letter directed to Superintendent Steenbergen was jerterday presented to Mayor Hinton. Hon. C.M. Thomas, attorney for the St. Louis company, returned after' an absence of a few days from the city,and stated that he had hot .receivedany communication from the company which he reprsents.- -.

John Tonkin, of Oil City, Pa.,President of the Central KentuckyNatural Gas Co., was a visitor inParis Tuesday, coming here especially to look into the conditions and to,investigate the rumors that had beencarried to his ears that the purchas-I ers of 1913 franchise The Light andDevelopment Co., of St., Louis, Mo.,intended to operate under the franchise of 1910.Col. Tonkin spent some time in consultation with Mayor J. T. Hinton inregard to the matter and gave the information to the city's executive thatimmediately upon receipt of the ruiribr which was in effect and whichoccasioned .decided unrest among theprospective consumers of natural gasin this city, he immediately telegraphed the St. Louis concern that hewould insist that the Paris Gas &Electric Co. operate under the latefranchise.Later, he said, he received a replyto the effect that it was the intention of the company to pursue -noother course than that with the approval of the city officials as well asthe consumers of natural gas, andfurther than that the Light & Development Co. was having papers prepared that would prove satisfactory.'After investigating the affair andfinding the people of Paris thoroughly satisfied with the course of tlieParis 'Gas & Electric Co., which' isowned and operated by the Light &Development Co. and assuring MayorHinton that the Central KentuckyNatural Gas Co. would in event of abreach of contract insist upon thelocal concern operating under the1913 franchise, he left Sor Lexingtonwhere he will' spends few 'days be-jfore returning home.530945lv!KJ1a3J&REDUCED PRICES- ON ALLWINTER SUITS$35.00 SUITS J $24.7525.00 SUITS .v ,.

It will be of interest to many Kentucky farmers toknow that in the classes offered forthe best ten years of white dent cornat the National Corn Show last year,Kentucky stood first among theStates.The annual meeting of the CornGrowers' Association is to held onWednesday, January 7, 1914, but thetorn show will continue throughoutthe week of January 5 to 10. Theprogram for Corn Day will be madew bearing on soil fertility and otheri I fundamental questions upon whichA- I the growing of corn like any otherW J crop depends. $ffa j Besides the corn show, which williV mcluae tlie cereals, tnere will oe inexhibits and competitive shows inhorticulture, dairy products and poultry, and a tobacco show. It will beseen from this synopsis that farmerswhose larger interests' represent thesevarious lines of agriculture will bebrought together for a general convention and for instruction by noted experts, and all has-been crowded intothe space of one week, that those especially interested in two or morefarm specialties may without greatloss of time attend both conventionsand others if they so desire.The other conventions are those ofthe Beef Cattle Breeders' Association, the Kentucky Dairy Cattle Club,the Kentucky She.ep Breeders' Association, the Kentucky Swine Breeders' Association, the Kentucky HorseBreeders' Association, the Poultrymen, the Bee Keepers' and the StateHorticultural Society. In most casesat least one specialist will be broughtfrom a distance to deliver the principal address at the meeting of. eachone of these associations.The women's department has notbeen slighted, as special arrangements are being made for work inhome economics which will be ofgreat value to women who live in rural communities. They will also bevery much interested in the poultryshow, the dairy products exhibit andconvention, and perhaps in the beekeepers' convention. A prospectus ofthis week of work being preparedand will be mailed free upon application. A very attractive premium list hasbeen provided for the corn show andfor tire other shows where competition are to be made, which will besent free upon request. Some maynot consider it worth while to sendsuch corn as they have which hasnecessarily been produced under veryadverse conditions during the pastseason, but it must be rememberedthat all have suffered from the samecause and the chaaces will be equal.Those who cannot attend the showare entitled to send their corn by express with the privilege of having itplaced in competition.Farmers' Wqek constitutes theopening of the Winter Short CourseI of Ten Weeks which is arranged forfarmers who cannot spare the timeand (money to take a longer course,but who want to gain some valuableand practical suggestions as regardsbetter farming.For further information, addressT.

New York physician 'who is an expertin tile care and treatment ot children,writes' an article entitled "How toMake Babies Better." Following isan extract in which Dr. Dennett giveshis ideas of exercise for children:"It seems to be the idea of somemothers to suppress their children intheir play, with the idea that it is fortheir good. I cannot understandwhy this suppression is so popular,because I believe that throughoutchildhood there are few exceptions tothe rule that a child should be allowed to be as active as he wishes.Not Jong ago I asked a mother whosechild did not seem to be in the bestof ihealth if she was very active' in hecplay. The mother replied that thechild was very lively, indeed, but thatshe was not allowed to run when shewas out of doors for fear of gettingoverheated, there was so much dangerof her catching cold afterward. Thishi not at all -unusual, for I meet thissuppression almos everyday. Suchmothers should learn that their children are far more apt to catch coldwnen tney ao not get the properamount of exercise than when theyare allowed to run and play all thylike. Let your children be as livelyas they wish and play to their heart'scontent. If they are not naturallyactive encourage them in a fondnessfor games. Most of us have caughtthe spirit of the fresh air treatment,and it would be welljf we coujd learntiiau CAvi m j jugi, cio xmixji. uc4.hus l-.

McKernan was takenill shortly before the close of theSouthern Michigan League .season,and wis for a time unable to standthe trip to his home in Cincinnati.A few weeks ago, however, his condition was somewhat improved, but itis hardly likely he will be sufficientlyrecovered to play ball next season.Hogarf' Yancey, of the Lexingtonteam, was in Cincinnati a few daysago to confer with McKernan in regard to assuming the management ofthe Lexington team, believing that heis the only ,man in minor leaguebase ball who could pilot the Coltsto victory in the -Ohio State Leagueduring the coming season.The fact that McKernan won twopennants for Paris while in the BlueGrass League, and in the second season in the Michigan League won forBattle Creek, is sufficient guaranteethat he would put the Colts in, therunning if his services could be secured. McKernan's illness was theresult of being struck over the kidneys by a ball during last season,which practically ruined his health.His many friends and admirers herewill regret to learn of his seriouscondition.RELIGIOUS.STOCK ARD FARM JiCSrv N.

But if -warmair, well loaded with moisture, issuddenly cooled, the sponge is squeezed and the moisture falls out as rain.Twenty years ago some hopefulgentlemen went to the arid regionsof Texas and exploded a lot of dynamite 'on the theory that the concussion would mix the strata of warmair near the earth with the spoolerstrata above, and so cause the necessary precipitation of moisture. Therehappened to be light showers aboutthe time of the experiments, whichejicouraged the experimenters, but didnot convince anybody else.The fact is that Nature's rainmaking machine is too gigantic to beaffected by the puny efforts of humans at least by any efforts so fardiscovered. "' Nature putnps the moisture-ladenair up into the cold regions of the-upper atmosphere with a wheel athousand miles in diameter. Whenthis tremendous wheel of air is revolving normally it lifts millions oftons of wter vapor to an elevationwhere it can no longer be carried insolution and so falls as Tain.When the wheel is off adjustmentit is as futile to bombard the skywith dynamite as it would be to firepopgun corks at the side of the latestdreadnought.Daily Reminder.Often "cold feet" is the better judgment peculiarly manifesting itself.qEST LAXATIVE FORBOWELS "CASCARETS'When Constipated, Headachy, Bilious3reath Bad, Stomach SourGet a ten-cent box.Aro youkeeping your bowels, liverand ctomach clean, pure and freshwith Cascarets, or merely forcing apassageway every few days withsalts, cathartic pills, castor oil or purgative waters? -Stop having a bowel wash day.

The upper part of theskull showed a well-developed humanforehead. Two molar teeth were;found in the lower jw and their formconvinced Dr. Smith-Woodward thatthe skull was that of an anthropoidape."When the relic was brought to myattention," said Dr. Williams, "I hadphotographs made of both the restored skull and the original bones. Isaw that Dr. Smith-Woodward t hadfilled in the cavities of the jaw withthe teeth of a gorilla. This, I felt,was wrong, and in my model substituted the teeth of a hnman."I finally proved to the satisfaction of the majority of the membersof the Royal College of Surgeons thatthe relic dated back to before thePleistocene era, which isagreed uponby nearly all scientists to have beenat least 500,000 years ago Therefore this man lived over "half a million years back.

Theplacers along Trinity and Klamathrivers were developed early in thegold rush and have been worked withvarying-'energy to the present time.The La Grange- mine, which is noeof the largest hydraulic placers in theworld, is now in the height of its activity. An account of an investigation ofthe auriferous gravels in the WeaverVille quadrangle, which embracesportions of Shasta and Trinity counties, by J.. S. Diller, is contained inBulletin 540-A, recently issued by theUnited States Geological Survey.The outlookfor future placer mining in this region, is encouraging.The success of the La Grange mineconsists in the economical treatmenton a large scale of relatively lowgrade gravel. The success of thedredging at Trinity Center and of theplacers north of Lewistbn gives confidence to those who are attemptinglarger developments at the mouthof Eastman Gulch and at the bendof Trinity river above Lewiston, andthe region may well be regarded aswortny of investigation by capitaPists interested in dredging and hydraulic mining. ,The bulletin also contains an account of the gold lodes of-the Weav-ervine quadrangle, by H. G. FerguGold was first discovered in the quadrangle In 1848; in the f al 1 o f thatyear $60,000 worth was taken fromtheNbed of "Clear Creek. It is impossible to make any cloBe estimate ofthe amount of gold produced fromthe lode mines in the quadrangle, butit is believed that' the total is in excess of $15,000,000'.In certain of the deposits of theregion practically all the gold, is contained in small scattered pocketsnear the surface. One of thesepockets yielded as much as $45,000in. distance of 44 feet; from anothera single plate of gold weighing 100olinces is said to have been obtained. The peculiar pocket deposits have given rise to a class ofprospectors known -as "pocket hunters." These men often" discovermany rich pockets by tracing theparticles of gold in the soil to theirsources. As soon as a pocket isgouged out and colors of gold are nolonger shown, the place is abandoned.
