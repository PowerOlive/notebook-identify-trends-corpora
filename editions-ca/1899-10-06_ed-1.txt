thousand members of civic organizations paradedbefore him besides tens of thousandsof non organized citizens and in aroar of cannon roekets and the blazeof red fire and the thunderous cheering of the populace and the warmgreeting- of the head of the nationDewey came to the national capital toa welcome such as has not been knownhere hithertoHis journey here frqm New York hadbeen one continuous ovation limitedin its intensity only by the density ofpopulation The decorated specialtrain which left the Pennsylvania railroad terry slip in Jersey City at 150 inthe afternoon was fully in keepingwith its distinguished passenger Itwas made up of five cars the Pennsylvanias prize special the Atlanta adining1 car a combination smoker andthree parlor cars for the accommodation of the Washington reception committeeIt was said by the railroad officialsand trainmen that the ovation duringthe rim from New York to Washington was the most remarkable demonstration that has ever taken placealong- the line Every town turnedout its full population and everyhouse and crossroad settlement wasturned inside out to see the flying- special passA bare stop was made at Princetonwhere young- Dewey had been a student and the admiral went to theplatform for a minute mereh sayingto the boys that he was pleased withrniril of vour rerrard It is true thatas long as I live and I hope to live along time cheers I intend to live inWashington I thank you again forthis expressionWashington Oct 4 The culmination of Adm Deweys triumphal homecoming was reached Tuesday in theshadow of the dome of

as he aooearedihe Jeweled Weapon Voted to before tne vast audience composednot only or all the hihe tofficials in the land but of spectatorsdrawn from every quarter of theQnited States The battle of Manilabay was not forgotten but it micrht besaid to have been relegated almost to1 second place in the desire to do honorto the man who had nroved himself aaI who had shown in the long and trying1months that followed his naval tri-nmph the qualities of a statesman anda wise administrator as well as ihoseof the lighting leader of a victoriousfleetAnd enhancing these qualities wasthat of manly modesty displayed inthe quiet dignity with which he metthe occasion This trait of Deweyscharacter was evidenced from the mo-ever paid by lLincut ne reacueu uie muiu sine u sinevwith the

ofDeanwood while the reception committee went through the formality ofpresenting the nations guest the freedom of the districtJohn Addison Porter secretary tothe president first extended PresidentMcKinleys greeting- to which the admiral returned his thanks very brieflyCommissioner Wight tien saidAdm Dewey you are now in theDistrict of Columbia and representingthe commissioners of the

havepoiub iura moment unwillingj parently to take the place that hadi been prepared for him on the right ofthe platform lest he should appear to usurp the place dueto the chief magistrate PresidentMcKinley grasped the situation in aninstant and taking his great sea captain by the arm placed him by gentleforce in that chair that had been intended for him Later in the day asthe carriages bearing the official partydrove away from the capitol betweenwalls of cheering people the presidentagain displayed his tact by remainingcovered and ignoring the demonstration himself leaving its acknowledgments to the admiral aloneFor Dewey it was a trying as well asa triumphal day It has been given tofew officers in the naval history ofthe country to sit before a crowd ofthousands while the chief of the naval establishments dilated upon theirexploits and then to stand before the same crowd to receive atthe hands of the president a swordprepared for him at the behalf ofthe representatives of the wholepeople The strain upon Adm Deweyreached almost to the breaking pointNone but those nearest to him couldsee how he labored to repress his feelings during the address of SecretaryLong but when he arose to receive thesword from the hands of the presidentno one could mistake the flash of thewhite gloved hand as it rose to dashaway the tears before the admiralcame to the rigid attitude of attentionbefore his chiefWhen it became Deweys turn to reply his voice failed him and he madethe effort twice before his lips wouldrespond When he did succeed histones were clear and steady but solow that only those nearest him couldhearOne of the most remarkable featuresof the eventful day was the ovation toRr Adm Schley on the return of theparty from the capitol to the whitehouse His carriage was several numbers behind that of the president andAdm Dewey and received an ovationthat could be tcarely ranked belowthat accorded to the admiral himselfThe tumult grew as the carriage proceeded down the avenue and the crowdsurged around it till the horses werebrought to a footpace Finally a company of the high school cadets cameto the rescue and formed about thecarriage in a hollow square Thusprotected and flanked by a force ofpolice the carriage reached the whitehouse with a long gap between it andthe next official guestsGut of the store of his experiencethe president was able to give AdmDewey one valuable suggestion beforeleaving the capitol Ihe venerableCardinal Gibbons was presented andafter an exchange of greetings thepresident asked the admiral if he feltequal to a general ordeal of handshaking The hero of Manila s vervedfrom the shock explaining that hsright arm was partially paralyzedfrom his experience in New YorkLet me suggest to you said thepresident hereafter you

the Many Varieties of SewingMachines Made Nowadays andin General IseIt is a more or less familiar fact thatsewing machines are used nowadaysfor sewing many different materialsas leather paper canvas carpets rubber They are used frr making buttonholes and sewing sn buttons Theyare made of many types and in simplyhundreds of varieties for special usesBut it may not be known so commonlythat there are many sewing machinesnow made with more than one needleTj first of these a two needle machine was made in the early eightiesabout 15 years ago It was used by manufacturers of heavy clothing perhapsfirst of all by the overall manufacturers making seams stronger by puttingin two rows of stitching The utilityand economy of the two needle machine soon became apparent and itcame into widespread and diversiiieduse Whenever two rows of stitchingwere to be made a two needle machineWas used A familiar illustration ofthe work is seen in the two parallellines of stitching run with perfect exactness around the top of a shot1 vampShirt sleeves are stitched into the bodyof the shirt on a double needle machinethe two rows being made in the sametime that it would take to make oneCollars and cuffs were stitched on twoneedle machines as were a great variety of these things and later therewere produced machines with morethan two needles the first of thesecoming into use within five or six yeansThere are now made sewing machineswith as many as 12 needle-A 12 neede sewing machine simplyhas 12 needles where the ordinary sewing machine would have one Insteadof a single spool of thread on the topof the machine there appears there arack of 12 spools There are 12 tension disks The thread from each spoolruns through its own tension disk toits own needle There are below 12shuttles one for each needle Whenthis machine is operated it makes 12rows of stitching just as an ordinarymachine would make one The 12 needlemachines are used chiefly in the manufacture of corsets X Y SunCLIMATE AND ALC0K0LRussian Physician Ipsots the TimeHonored Theory of Hunts Effects iii Cold CountriesA genera helief is that the consumption of alcohol especially in concentrated form is greatest in cold climatesand that its effects art- less harmfulowing to more rapid oxidation and themore active life of the natives whilethe neglect to reduce the amount ofalcohol in warmer regions is consideredone of the chief causes of diseaseamong- Europeans in th tropics Theresearches of Dr Sikorsky of KiefRussia seem to that this is farfrom the truth says the Army andNavy JournalHis country is admirably suited forsuch an investigation for over a vastextent of latitude from the White seato the Caucasus the Russian peasantluis for generations been testing theeffects of his favorite solution

table is aseasy as pie and that the fives are notmuch harder But slight as is the mental effort required in multiplying anynumber by live it may be lessened stillmore by discarding the multiplier entirely and substituting a divisor instead This may sound paradoxicalbut by experimenting you will find thatdividing by two will bring the same result as multiplying by five providingyou add a cipher to the quotient if thedividend be an even number or five ifit be odd For instance you multiply734 by five the product is 13070 Whatis still easier divide 2734 by two whichis done almost

makes the presentdisturbance of particular interest toAmericans is the fact that the merchants and foreign planters who arethe bone and sinew of the republic arealmost unanimous in desiring theUnited States to either annex or establisk a protectorate over the little countryThe Dominican republic sometimeserroneously called the republic of SantoDomingo occupies the eastern andlarger part of the island of Santo Domingo or Haiti in the West IndiesIt is broken by several mountain chainsand in the interior there are elevatedplains of great fertility and beautyThe majority of the inhabitants numbering about C50000 are of mixed Indian Spanish and negro blood withsome of pure African descent and comparatively few whites Spanish is thecommon and official language thoughFrench and English are spoken in thecoast town- The state religion is Roman Catholicism but other religiouscults are tolerated Agriculture cattleraising and- timber cutting are almostthe industries the principal exportbeing sugar cofuv tobacco hides andcabinet woods The entire area of therepublic according to Dominicanclaims is 18045 square milesThe capital of the county is the cityof Santo Domingo located at the mouthof the Ozama river It was founded byBartholomew Columbus in 149G and isthe oldest European city and was longevery ourth year was a farce as he wasthe whole government Congressjudges and provincial governors werehis creatures and the constitution andthe law were interpreted according tohis wishesHad he been a truly great man he couldhave made the Dominican republic respected at home and abroad but hispassion for display and extravaganthabits led him to excesses which havebrought the little country to bankruptcy and ruin After he had occupied thepresidential chair for six years he owedlarge sums to every merchant andplanter and to such foreign residents ascould be persuaded to lend him anything Man of these obligations wereincurred in the name of the government and when the time for settlement came not even a Philadelphialawyer could have separated the national from the private debtsWhen pushed beyond the verge of en-durance for ready cash th presidentsent confidential agents to Europe tonegotiate a national loan of 3b59000These men did their work so well thatfinanciers in Hamburg Amsterdam andBrussels not only subscribed the required amount but in 1890 granted another loan of 4500000 of which twothirds was to be set aside to completea railroad from lorto Plata to SantiagoTo secure payment of the interest onthe loan the creditors- required the government to make over to them the entire customs receipts excepting 60000gold per month for the budget Themoney received on the loans was spentin less than no time to use a slangphrase but the railroad remained unfinished and Heureaux was hard up oncemore The European financiers de-J clined to increase their Dominican ini vestments and in this extremity a syni dicate of American capitalists came tothe rescue of the spendthriftUnder the direction of Smith MWeed Charles 13 Wells Warner MillerMatthew S Quay Stephen B ElkinsWillard Drown Calvin S Brice andether prominent capitalists and politicians the Santo Domingo

elected by universal suffrageFrom 1S65 up to 1SS2 when UlyssesHeureaux who was recently assassinated one revolution succeeded theother murder was practiced openlyand corruption permeated every branchof the government In 1808 the Kothschilds made a loan of 3075000 to thestate of which only 35000 reached theDominican treasury the balance beingdivided between the promoters of thedeal the financiers interested in it atCthe government officials who signed thebonds Yet despite this gigantic stealthe country was fairly prosperous whenHeureaux was elected president in 1882and restored

atonce branched out into fresh excessesborrowed money from the Americanconcern at a ruinous rate of interestall of which sums became incorporatedin the national debt In 1894 the American concern purchased the Frenchbank of Santo Domingo the only financial institution of importance in therepublic and reincorporated it as theBanco Nacional de Santo DomingoIhe improvement company becameowner of two thirds of the stock theremaining third was the personal property of President Heureaux Still thingswent from bad to worse and whenHeureaux was assassinated a fewmonths ago it was found that the American company held 7500000 in fourper cent bonds and 13825000 in twoand three quarter per cent bonds Tothis vast sum must be added a floatingindebtedness to merchants and othersj roughly estimated at 8000000 Andout of this total of 30000000 little morethan 1000000 is traceable to legitimategovernment expensesThe American company virtually controls the government at the presenttime It collects all the revenues andsupervises the expenditures The congress is its creature and the otficials inevery department court its favors Butrich as the country is it is doubtful ifit can bear the burden of taxation thathas been laid upon it by dishonest public servants and should the Americancreditors force the payment of themoney due them civil war and the destruction of American propertj wouldbe inevitable In such an emergencythe United States would be compelledto interfere and to annex the republic a contingency which would beheartily welcomed by the improvementcompany as it would mean a profit ofat least 5000000 to its shareholdersThe only hope entertained by the patriotic Dominicans for the perpetuation of their country as an independentstate lies in the election to the presidency of Don Juan Isidro Jimenes awealthy native of the island who wasexpatriated by Heureaux several yearsago Jimenes returned to Santo Do-mingo at the head of a powerful bandof revolutionists and just now seemsto have things his own way It is hintedthat Heureaux was assassinated by oneof Jimenes henchmen and even thenew autocrats most intimate friendshave so far not taken the trouble todeny this

PARIS KY FRIDAY OCTOBER 6 1899GOOD CROP OF WHEATSome Things That Cannot Beed If Profitable Result AreExpectedOne essential in growing a good cropof wheat is to have the soil prepared ingod tilth One advantage in plowingearly is that a better opportunity is offered of getting the soil into a propercondition for the seed The under soilshould be fairly well packed and tiiesurface to the depth of four or uveinches prepared in fine tilthThe disc and smoothing harrows arerood implements to use in preparingthe seed bedWhen conditions will admit reasonably i nly seeding is best iva thereis no advantage in sowing the seed until the soil is in a good tilth and unless there is sufficient moisture in theroil to induce a yood Termination ofthe seed Of course wheat as well asmany other kinds of grain will lie iathe ground when the soil is without germinating and Act when rfticome to moisten up the ground theseed will germinate But there is riskof loss and lying in the ground weakens to some extent the vitality oi tiieseedIt is best there ore to defer t lie seeding until there is sufficient moistureAnother item that may make it desirable to defer the seeding is risk ofinjury from Hessian fly Many goodfarmers consider that if the seeding canbe put off until there is one good frostthe risk of injury from fly is greatlylessenedAnother item in making a good cropis to use good seed For nearly allcrops seed should not only possess sufficient vitality to germinate readily under seasonably favorable conditionsbut to send forth a vigorous thriftyplantSeed should be carefully selected andonly the best be used In sowing cftreshould be taken to distribute the seedas evenly as possible over the surfaceOne advantage in tising a drill is thatthe seed is not only distributed moreevenly but is covered at a more uniform depthBecause wheat is low- in price is thestrongest reason why all reasonablecare should be taken to secure a goodyield A good yield may return a smallprofit even at a low price while a light-yield and low prices mean a positivelossThe quantity of seed depends somewhat upon the time of sowing thequality of the seed and the condition ofthe soil at the time of seeding If sownIn good season with the soil preparedin good tilth live pecks to the acre willbe plenty This quantity should beincreased as the quality of the seedcovers with late sowing and poor conditions of the soil So with late sowing and unfavorable conditions sevenpecks to the acre will not be too muchSt Louis RepublicKEEPING WATER PUREHow to Keep Surface Water andOther Deleterious SubstancesOut of
