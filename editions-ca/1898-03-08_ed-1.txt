Foreign BuildersNew York March 7 A special tothe Herald from Washington saysFully realizing the importance ofpreparations for any emergency thepresident has directed the navy department to open negotiations looking tothe purchase abroad of warships Thisfact is now for the first time made public It probably would not have transpired at this juncture but for theexcitement caused by the statement published that Spain had purchased or was negotiating for warships being built by the Elswick company of England for Brazil and otherships under construction With aview of ascertaining the facts yourcorrespondent called upon a high official of the administration and obtained an official admission madefor the first time that whilethe president does not anticipate war he recognizes that there is apossibility of hostilities growing outof the Cuban problem and the Mainedisaster and that he proposes to beprepared for it There has been ampleevidence of this in the extensivepreparations

men-of-war which are practically completed in foreign shipyards have been offered for sale in theUnited States The president hasgiven consideration to the advisabilityof placing an option on them Thenavy department has been carefullywatching the construction of shipsabroad through the eyes of itsnaval attaches of London ParisSt Petersburg Berlin Vienna andRome This surveillance has been maintained for two months but more especially since the Maine disasterThrough these naval attaches andfrom ship builders themselves the secre tar3 of the navy has learned that hecan now purchase two small sizedbattleships two armored cruisers andfour torpedo boats all at a comparatively low price The builders havepromised that they can deliver theships to agents of this government atthis time complete in every respectand all that will be necessary for theadministration to do will be to orderthe necessary details of officers andmen to proceed to the shipyard go onboard the vessels and take them to anypoints which may be desiredThe builders have urged that thepurchases be made at once as they saythat a declaration of war between theUnited States and Spain would resultin the enforcement of neutrality lawsand prevent the sale of the ships Thebattleships and armored cruisershave been built by English and Germanfirms for governments which are nowunable to pay for them so that thisgovernment would have no difficulty inobtaining the vessels by simply putting down the neeessary amount ofcash The four torpedo boats havebeen offered by the Thornycrof t ShipBuilding Co whose boats are recognized by experts to be among the bestin the worldWhile your correspondent was unableto learn the names of the ships whichhave been offered to this governmentthere is reason to believe that amonthem are three powerful shipsunder construction at the Vulcanworks Stettin Germany fqr theChinese government These threeships are of S000 tons displacementcontracted to make 195 knots and willbe able to carry not less than a thousandtons of coal in their bunkers There isalso reason to believe that in case oftrouble this government could purchase from Japan the Kasagi and theChiosa which are nearing- completionat Philadelphia and the Union ironworks The official with whom yourcorrespondent talked had no doubtthat Japan wonld be wiliing to aid theUnited States by selling the

court of inquiry will decidethat there was a mine explosion underthe Maine discussion among Americannaval officers and civilians here is prevalent as to the warlike measureswhich it is believed the United Statesgovernment will adopt in case thequestion of the payment of indemnityby Spain is overruled A majority believe that American troops willbe landed at some point east of Havanaand the insurgents communicated withthat the Spanish soldiery will be defeated or captured in detail and thatin the meantime a fleet of UnitedStates vessels will blockade if notbombard Havana No one seems todoubt that the reduction of this citywould be comparatively easy Four 12inch guns two west and two east ofthe city are the only ones that areconsidered dangerous These are notlikely to be well served while theiremplacements are not modernThat some Spaniards are of the opinion that an attack on Havana will bemade is believed to be shown by theabnormal activity displayed on boardthe Vizca37a A press correspondenthas the best naval authority for thestatement that the Vizcaya is in a constant state of readiness for emergencies and that picket boats are on thealert day and night inside the harborand outside the harbor at nightIt is pointed out that the men-of-warVizcaya and Almirante Oquindo whichhas arrived might be caught ina blockade and fall an easy prey to aUnited States fleet The cruiser Alfonso XII is without boilers andwould be of no account All this discussion of the probability of waramong the Americans and Spaniardsproves nothing- and only shows thestate of feeling hereThe conduct of the Spanish diverswho are investigating- the wreck of theMaine is a mystery Thus far theyhave not been down five hours in theaggregate and they show no disposition to make a thorough inquiryIt is impossible to learn the truthfully regarding the purpose of theSpanish court of inquiry but it is generally believed that the divers weresent down for forms sake only and thata report will be made in accordapcewith instructions from Madrid It maybe that the Spanish divers have discovered that the whole port side of theMaine forward is gone and having soreported further

these mysteries any relationto or any connection with the sealedcellar Sonntag iinaly saidThe woman said nothing about thestrange events being located in any particular jilace and I did not think to askher I replied The old lawyers question opened up a new train of thoughtCould it be possible that the strangevoice- I had heard proceeded from thesealed cellarAh I suppose the women are superstitious and think the place ishaunted Such ideas generally getabroad about old long- vacated housesBut you do not mind their talkYou are not afraid of ghosts are youThe old fellows eyes twinkled merrilyWell I have never come across anyof those shadowy beings I could tellbetter after I met one I hardly thinktalk alone could frighten me I repliedgpmewhat shamefacedly rememberingSow nearly I had been unnerved thenight before by my own reflectionI will be over some time to morrowand will see if anything can be done regarding the mysterious cellar MrSonntag said as I rose to leave Andpardon me for referring to the unfortunate affair have you heard of anynew developments in the robbery caseWhat I exclaimed you know of ittooCertainly I lived near Philadelphiaat the time and I read the papers heleplied smilinglyIt seems I cannot escapehearing ofthat terrible affair I said bitterly1Ah She loves you thenAnd I acted the part of a fool too inthe matter Instead of putting forthevery effort to find the perpetrators IJet the thing go let others who couldnot possibly have had the interest inthe case that I had undertake investigations I am rightly served for mysupineness for I have heard nothingabout it at all I know what I knew-the morning of its occurrence not a bitmore Others have failed I intend toee now what I can doYou intend going into the affair-then he said drylyI do with all the energy and resource I am possessed ofDo you know how near you cameto being arrested for the crimeSonntag askedWhy yes I know of course thatwould have happened could anythinghave been found against meWell there was enough to hold youon suspicion at leastThen why did you not arrest meI am sure I was willing I courted atrialIt was very seriously talked ofamong the trustees But the president-opposed it for one Sonntag saidYes I know he really believed nie-innocentBut his objection was not the strongest influence which arose in your behalf continued myv agent Thestrongest most powerful opposition toyour arrest came from one whose influence outweighs even the presidentsOne of the trustees I asked eagerlyYesYou cannot meanSylvester Morley interrupted thelawyerMr Morley I exclaimed joyfullyFor I knew great as Sylvester Morleysinfluence was there was one who wielded a greater since she could influenceher father Was it her sweet self thathad come to my aid through herfather It would be happiness to knowthis but then why had she passedme without a greetingMy face must have told a whole storyto the shrewd old lawyer When Iturned toward him again there was avery grave expression on his face and acontemplative look about his sharpeyes as he regarded meYou seem highly elated by this hesaidOh I am What young man wouldnot feel highly honored in knowingthat a man of Mr Morleys standing jhad defended him I exclaimedThe old fellow saw the blush whichspread over my face however and hesmiled as he replied I do not courtyour confidence but it is plain there issome power behind Mr Morley whichled that gentleman to defend you Nowbelieve me Mr Conway I do not askfor curiosity there is a grave purposein the question I am about to ask youhe went on as the smile died from hisface and what seemed to me to be deepconcern appeared instead The question is this Are you an especial friendof Miss Morleys Are you engaged tomarry hervNo But had the suspicion of therobbery not fallen upon me I probablywould have asked her to be my wifelong before now I replied rather wondering at myself for telling this to theold fellow on so short an acquaintanceAh she loves you thenThat I cannot say I believe she didthink very highl3 of me at one timebut I promised riot to hold any communication with her until my innocence was known It is a year sincethen Whether her f for me haschanged or not I do not knowYou have kept your promise thenWhy certainly I I answered withsome indignation at the implied doubtof meNow about the investigation you desire to -engage in Sonntag saidchanging the subject rather abruptlyWhat do you propose to do How goabout itOh hire some smart detective Ireplied I suppose that will be theonly way What else can I doDo you think the bank officials haved one nothing Do you think you couldfind any shrewder detectives than haveundoubtedljr been working on the caseIf the bank with all its tremendous reFOtirces has not succeed6din runningthe robbers down how can you expectto succeed when your limited meanswould make your search merely asuperficial oneBut heavens man what am I to doCarry this load to the grave Why MrSonntag this suspicion of me you cannot imagine what a horrible thing it ishow it darkens my life I exclaimedin bitterness of spirit as I realized howhopeless my case seemedYou have been patient so long underyour trouble a little more endurancewill not hurt you Sonntag said inanswer to my despairing wordsing colors some day Now it may notlook so to you but to me it appearsthat you have done a great deal yourself in the investigations which nodoubt are still in progressHow can that foe I have done nothingAnd- that is exactly what I meanThat very course seems to me to be acreat feature in the search thoughyou cannot see it in that light Sonntag smiled in a knowing wayIn what respect has my supinenessaided the case I asked curiouslyBy allowing the real perpetrators ofthe crime to feel secure in their position knowing as they probably do thatyou are still the only suspected part3rI was much impressed by the old fellows wordsYou ought to have been a detectiveI remarked at which he- turned hissharp glance toward me and answeredYes I might have done somethingin that line But I prefer a quiet lifeSonntag followed me out to the buggy I took up the lines but a thoughtoccurred to me and I delayed my departure to voice itDo you know Mr Morley 1 askedNo I do not was Sonntags answerThen where did jou get your information about that gentlemans defense of meOh such news gets out sometimesStill I dont mind telling you It wasfrom Horace Jackson I received the informationProm Jackson I exclaimed in surprise You know Jackson thenYes merely a speaking acquaintance though He comes here quitefrequentlybank I askedHe is not employed there nowJackson has become quite wealthy atleast so he himself says He has madesome big strikes speculating in coallands He said hs could not afford todevote his time to the bank for a paltrysalary when his interests outside hadgrown so important So he left aboutfive or six months agoThen he did finally fulfill his threatof leaving I remarked He was always talking about leaving I continued in explanation As he stillheld on to his position notwithstanding it got to be a standing joke in theoffice about Jackson quitting the jobAh indeed He seemed then toj desire that every one of his associatesTHE BCfUEBON NEWS TUESDAY MAECH 8 1898might expect his leaving at any timeremarked the lawyer with a significance I could not then account forI suppose so or he would not havereiterated his intention so frequentlyAnd hes become rich No wonderHe told me once he was interested withMr Morley in a few business venturesWell hes lucky Youll foe over thento morrowYes Good dayCHAPTER VmWhen I again passed the depot atSidington on my way home there wasa lady on horseback talking to theagentIt needed no second glance to tell meit was Florence Morley Her face wasturned toward the fellow and so shedid not see me I drove along slowlykeeping my eyes upon her and debating in my mind whether I should stopand address her or notIt was a strong temptation and onlyfear held me back a cowardly fear tooI doubted how my overtures might bereceived I had chosen my course ofmy own accord and I would follow itIf it was contrary to her wish shewould find a way to tell meAfter passing the station I allowedmy horse to continue at a walk so that1 I I M I mAnd what did you anB werPFlorence must catch up with me if sheintended to ride to her home from SidingtonThe resolve to stick to my promisewas growing weaker since Sarahs comment upon it A word from Florence Iknew would cause me to break it andI really was impatient for that wordSoon the sound of approaching hoofsbeating the hard road reached meNearer it came and nearer until finallyI caught a glimpse out of the cornerof my e3e of a swaying petticoatShe pulled in her horse to a walkand then I turned my head and glancedat her My heart was in my throatwhen I looked but the smile that greeted me dispelled my fears like mist be-fore the morning sunBut the smile was not all that toldme of her emotion at again meeting meThe deep brown eyes were suffusedwith tears With my own heart leapingfor joy I reinea my horse to a standstill In an instant I was at her sideShe extended her hand and with myassistance sprang lightly to the groundI took her horses bridle over my armand with the disengaged hand helpedher climb into the buggyTie the horse to the back axle thencome here beside me were the firstwords she said I lost no time in obeyingImagine if you please the overwhelming joy to be seated once morebeside her who held my whole heart inher keepingI could not trust myself to speak andit was she who foeganAre you not pleased to see me oncemore Mr Conway Because if you arenot I certainly will not tell you howhappy I am in again meeting an oldfriendThe soft sweet tones of her voicewhich I loved so to hear ljad now atremble to them I glanced at her andwell Florence was still my true heartas she had been throughout notwithstanding nry doubt and fearThe past year has been an eternityto me I finally saidAnd who is to blame for that I wonder And too when was the mysterycleared up since you are now speakingto me she said with a joyous laughwhich told me as plainly as wordscould how she had missed meIt is not cleared up sometimes Ithink it never will be I could not havefound fault with you had you forgottenme Will you forgive me when I confess I was fearful you hadNo I do not think I can quite forgive that What reason had you formistrusting me she earnestly askedYou passed me this mornincr vouknow without bowingI was so startled and we had gonebefore I realized that it was youwho were standing there That wasa slight cause for mistrusting me sirIt was and I am very sorry IndeedI have been a fool right through thewhole affair I see it now I had noright to make such a promiseWell I do not think you were afool But forgive me that promise wasa foolish one and and just a trifle unkind The tears again started in hereyes and her voice took on the tremblewhich went so appealingly to my heartNever again will I be so foolish Iexclaimed I will see your father andtell him I have broken my promise thatit was impossible to keep it and that itis simply absurd to subject us to themisery of a longer separation May 1tell him that May I speak for both ofUSYShe hung her head while -the redflush spread over her face Then shemurmured Yes speak for Iboth ofus Why not since it is true Perhaps3oull find father has changed his viewsa trifleNot in his opinion of my incccncei hope I said I hare been told hestrongly objected to my arrest AndI know whose influence caused him todo so2fot mine really Florence earnestly replied Father believed you wereinnocent and tookithe stand he didfor that reason I did not know aboutthe robbery until after the first meeting of the trustees It was at thatmeeting that he opposed your arrestI remember he felt quite triumphantafterward for most of the trustees insisted upon your immediate arrest andit was only after father said that hewould never consent to it that they gaveup the pointNow that is pleasant to hear Icried joyfully What reason have youto think he has changed his views regarding the promiseThis morning after we had passedyou I said That looked like NelsonConway Father laughed at me andanswered that it must have been anhallucination produced by constantlykeeping my thoughts upon youIt is impossible to describe the fascination of Florences manner when shetold me this how maidenly bashfulness blended with loves boldness howthe blushes dyed her smooth cheekwhile her eyes shone with a confidenthappy lightThen at lunch this noon fatherasked me if I I liked you as much asever Liked was not the word heused but never mind well use it nowAnd what did you answer I askedeagerly and expectantlyThat not a day went by that I didnot think of you And oh Nelson shecontinued her voice deep and full in itsearnestness that was not half thetruth Why should l Hesitate to confess it to you my dear friendHere I made use of my disengagedarm I could not help it I drew herclosely to me and kissed her bloomingcheekI certainly shall not go on if I am interrupted Florence said in gentle remonstranceWhat did your father say in answer I finally askedHe said he thought perhaps it wasunjust to both of us to insist on yourkeeping the promiseDid he say that I exclaimed ThenFlorence but really it is enough to saythat the dear girl promised to be mywife even though the suspicion shouldnot be removed f romme providing MrMorleys consent could be gained andshe moreover promised to do all shecould to help me gain his consentTO

the Atlantic and the Pacific slopes of the continent Up the eastern incline we havetraversed the sand wastes the lava bedsand the pin on groves of New Mexicodown the western we lookout upon thewide and desolate sweep of ArizonaThe fort is not a strong place of defensewith moat and rampart and bastion itconsists essentially of low adobe buildings which inclose a quadrangularparade ground On three sides of thesquare are houses for officers and theirfamilies and on the fourth are barracks for eight troops of cavalry Outside the central quadrangle are thestorehouses the hospital the magazinethe laundresses quarters or Soap sudsRow and the stables The angulararchitecture of the fort seems drawnup at Attention against the dazzlingblue sky of New Mexico Nature however relieves the squareness and grayness of the earth colored houses by adrapery of wild clematis and woodbinein summer and of softening snow inwinter The parade ground is brownand dusty except for a few sparsepblades of grass

private letter from Belize British Honduras recieved in this city bya gentleman familiar with affairs inCentral America comes the news thatfriction and unpleasant relations between the whites and negroes of British Honduras that has existed for several years past has culminated in several incendiary attempts to destroy thelittle city of Belize The letter writtenin the Spanish language was translated for the Eegister by the recipientHis correspondence dated Belize January 28 states that a reign of terrorexists in that city and that the negroeshave determined to drive the white settlers from the town not by force ofarms but by burning up their propertyOn the night of January 26 there were14 houses burned on King Bishop andAlbert streets This is the third attempt made to burn the town On thefirst attempt property to the value of250000 was burned including largewarehouses and stores The negroeshave made threats that they will notrest until every white man in the placeis driven out The situation of thewhites is very precariousThe gentleman to whom the letterwas addressed declares that within hisown knowledge the ill-feeling-that exists among the blacks of the provinceagainst their neighbors is of longstandingBritish Honduras has a population ofnearly S0000 and of these the whitepeople number less than 3000The fertility of the soil and the warmclimate conduce to human inactivityand the negroes will do little workThe country has presented a profitablefield for enterprise and push in theexport of fine woods of the forests andin the import of everything that theinhabitants eat drink and wearThe trees are felled and rafted to anoutpost by black labor which i9 employed by yearly contract and as thecontractor has the commissary storeand supplies goods and clothing o hislaborers and as they are ignorant andimprovident the consequences usuallyis that at the end of the year the laborer has very little wages due himand in many instances is in debt to thecontractorThe result has been that the whiteswho are in trade with the provinceshave prospered while the negro laborerhas retrograded The uneasiness exists in all parts of the province andhas done so for more than seven yearsThe outbreak of incendiarism thathas occurred at Belize will possibly beduplicated with greater atrocities inthe interiorThe news from Belize will be lookedfor with tense interest in the UnitedStates Much more than half the whitepopulation in the colonj are Americansand since the development of the fruittrade during the past few years thetrade of the country has been

treatment for fungus diseases published in several previous bulletins But concerning brownrot Monilia fructigena we may saythat only the most persistent effort canhold this fungus in check As all growers have observed the decayed fruitshang to the twigs and persist over winter It is from these in the early dajsof spring that an abundant crop ofspores are borne and the petals of theflowers young leaves and even manybranches are attacked Thpse mummied fruits also hang on all summer andcontinue to produce spores Hence bythe time the fruits become half -grownor begin to mature the infecting sporesmay come from the old decayed fruitsof the previous year or from more recent infection on the young growth olthe Ctirrent year Whenever the fruithas become badly attacked treatmentis quite uselessThe proper plan is to remove all decayed fruit from the orchard when thetrees are free from foliage as it can beeasily seen at this time then beforethe buds swell in the spring wash thetrees thoroughly with a solution olconcentrated lye or of sulphate of copper The first solution should be madebjr dissolving eight cans of lye in 50gallons of water and the copper sulphate bluestone in 50 gallons of water I consider the lye preferable butthe latter may be somewhat pleasanterto handle This washing is very important and perhaps does as much realgood as all later workThe later washings should be givenas follows Weak Bordeaux just ascolor shows plainly in the bloom budsand repeated soon as bloom has fallenIf the work is well done to this pointvery little infection will have survivedConcerning value of later sprajings Imuch in doubt If the early washing isnot well done I have almost no faithin later treatmentAll washing or treatment of orchardsshould be done with a
