After reading of so many people in
our town who have been cured by
Doar.'s Kidney Pills, the question
naturally arises: "Is this medicine
equallv successf c in our Tneighboring
towns?" The generous statement of
this Car isle resident leaves no room
for doubt on this Doint.
R. L. Curtis, policeman. Chestnut
street. Carlisle, Ky.. Bays: "I tell
everyone I know about the merits of!
Doan s Kidney Pills. I am glad to
confirm the statement I made in 1908
in their praise. Any person who fol
lows blacksmithing for any length ot
time is likely to have kidney trouble,
as this work weakens the kidnevs and
back. I had a bad case of backache
and 'my bladder became inflamed. 1
finally began using Doan's Kidney
Pills and they acted splendidly, soon
giving me relief."

of those living in a pineapple country,

twist around. It comes out easily.

Pleasures oF Childhood.
"Well, what has my little girl been
doing today?" asked a Kansas City
mother of her daughter of six years
who had just returned from play.
"Why," was the reply, "we had a
couple get married, and then they
went away for a wedding trip and
then they had a baby and then the
baby died of spinal meningitis. Oh,
we had' the most fun!" (
Banks Replace English Safoont.
'We are abolishing public houses, hut
we are increasing banks. A writer has
put a question as to the number of
banks between the Euston road and
St. Albans, and on the south side be
tween the Elephant and Croydon. Half
a century ago there was not one. It
was London and Westminster that
first set up a bank for the small man.
And now you can hardly pass a street
corner without the appeal of the hank.

Paris Wins Close Game From the
Lawmakers.
By the masterly pitching of Hauser,
his timelv drive in the tinal session
and the opportune hit of Dunlap which
counted the iirst run, Paris was able
to snatch an extra inning contest from
the League leaders at White Park yes
terday afternoon.
The contest was fast and , snappy
and une of the most interestine one on
the local lot this season, rlhe scrappy,
mood in wmch Manager Gfroerer, of
the J-awmal:eis. allowed himself to be
plunged into probably added a little
snap to the exhibition but with all it
was nothing short of disgraceful and
to say tl e least did not meet with a
very hearty approval.
Hauser was at his best throughout
the ten-inning struggle, and had it
not Deen for a couple of errors in the
eighth frame the Lawmakers would
have been completely blanked and
Pan's would have come out at the close
of the final session with the long end
of the run column.
Another fact is the locals accom
plished the defeat ot the mighty Em
ory, who came with a string of victo
ries almost too long to measure.
While the visitors out-hit our boys by
one point, the diives sent into sate ter
ritory werej)f less consequence and out
of lour extra base hits three of the
number were to the credit of the locals.
For the occurence which ook place
yesterday no one is more to blame than
Umpire Kelly, who in his official po
sition could have nut a stop to the
manuevers ot Gfroerer, who after a.
tacking he Paris pitcher engaged in a
war of words with the bleacherites
and the occupants of the stand, threat
ening to do violence. Not until an
officer threatened him with ejection
did he become reconciled.
The game was a prettv exhibition
so far as ball playing is concerned and
was marked by many brilliant plavs
on both sides. The first run for Paris
came in the fifth when Harrell singled
and Dunlap almost bursted the fence
with a stinging drive for three bases.
The score was tied in the eighth when
Nicholson singled DastMollenkamp,pil
fered second, went to third on .Hicks'
wild peg and scored when Locke
fumbled Gust's roller.
Ilauser won his own game in the
tenth frame when Lock1, the second
man up, walked and pilfered second,
scoring whengthe former sent a sting
ing drive to left.
The Lawmakers will be the attrac
tion at White Park tomorrow afternoon
when the double-header scheduled
will be pulled off. Boniosh, the Indian
huiler, will be on the knob the opening
game which will be called at 2 o'clock.
Thefact thatt ha Indian did not pitch
the game yesterday was due to his not
being in proper condition and his work
out yesterday afternoon will fit him
for the game this afternoon." The

TUESDAY PARIS 3,MAYSV1LLE6
Maysviile broke the hoodoo, Tuesday
afternoon, in that city, and defeated
the Bourbonites by a score of 6 to 3.
The game wa3 a splendid exhibition
and went to the Rivermen by a margin
of three scores acquired by clean and
consecutive hictincr. For four innings
Pari3 was unable to hit Weilman, hut
three hits in succession in the fifth
gave them their first two runs, while
a rally in the ninth resulted in anoth
er. Applegate was touched ud for an
even dozen safe drives. Both teams
fieldtd well.

A double-header was scheduled for
Wednesday afternoon, but a heavv rain
caused a postponement.
Frankness.
"When we speak of the hope of con
viction by which we live we can at
least do so gravely and frankly . . .
we are too apt to turn the edge of dis
agrement by banter; too apt to shrink
away from what we really most care
to say . . . or to hear through dread
of a smile; too ready to distrust our
own sincerity because of the inevit
able ebb and flow of our feelings and
so to throw a veil of something like
cynicism over the subjects we feel
most sacred." Caroline Stephen.
