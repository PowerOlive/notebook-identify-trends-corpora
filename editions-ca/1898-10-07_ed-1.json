EDWARD HARDY the jolly man
MR
ager of Sheppard Cos great store at
Braceville 111 writes I had never
been sick a day in my life until in 1890 I
got so bad with nervous prostration that I
had to give up and commence to doctor I
tried our local phvsicians and one in Joliet
but none gave me any relief and I thought
I was going to die I became despondent
and suffered untold agony I could not eat
sleep nor rest and ix seemed as if I could
not exist At the end of six months I was
reduced to but a shadow of myself and at
last my heart became affected and I was
truly miserable I took six or eight bottles
of Dr Miles Nervine It gave me relief
from the start and at last a cure the great
est blessing of my life

Chicago Chronicle
Eotltimo In Canada
Any one who has visited Canada real
izes the difference between Yankee
hustling and the easy going way they
do things up there I should love to
go visitingvin Canada fays a tired
wanderer if the people there ever
went to bed They never go to bed
and they never get up commented a
Hibernian who had been there
Something must be wronc with the
Canadians are and they rarely go to
bed much before midnight nor break
fast much before 9 oclock It is an old
country custom handed down and com
foitably enjoyed The 930 p m bed
time of American domesticity is there
unknown and tho 730 breakfast be
longs solely to the lowest laboring
clashes
Oh yes I feel splendid this morn
ing I got to bed early and had a good
sleep said a young man who had
been complaining of weariness and lack
of rest What time did you retire
asked the inquisitive American Oh
real early was the reply Soon after
the clock had struck 12 Troy Times
The Astute Uon
One day a toothless lion whose mus
cles were unstrung by age lay in a
shady place by the streamlet side
What is the matter they aslud
monarch and worried him with their
teeth
Inside of five minutes they all lay
rigid in death
Golly chuckled the lion Im
His Worst Offense
When it was proposed to lessen the
list of crimes punished by death Lord
Eldon objected to the noose being ban
ished in cases of petty shoplifting The
small shopkeepers will be ruined by this
exemption said the old Tory lord
chancellor
Another Tory a judge so venerated
the sovereign that he included in his re
gard any article belonging to the king
no matter how far removed from actual
possession A tailor had been condemn
ed for the murder of a soldier and the
judge tacked on this addition to the
sentence of death
And not only did you murder him
but you did thrust or push or pierce or
project or propel the lethal weapon
through the belly band of his breeches
which were his majestys
Past Salaries of Actors
A number of autograph letters of Ed
mund Kean supply some interesting in
formation about the salaries of aotors
early in the century One relates to an
offer by Mr Ellison offering Kean 3 a
week as aoting manager of the new
theater in Wych street Later this
rose as high as 25 a month In 1826
Kean was offered 12000 a year to go
to America In the
prime of his popu
larity he received 200 for a week in
Edinburgh and apparently reached the
highest point when Mr Bunn wrote
from the Theater Royal Dublin on
Feb 8 1829 and offered him 50 a
night to play in Dublin and Cork
Liverpool Mercury
Iiife of a Battleship
Naval experts have put down the ao
tive life of a modern battleship at about
15 years A hundred years ago battle
ships lasted nearly six times as long and
were on active service nearly the whole
time of their commission The Victory
for instance was 40 years old when she
aoted as Nelsons flagship at the memo
rable battle of Trafalgar A line of
battle ship the Royal William was
built at Chatham in 1670 and was not
broken up until 1813 being rebuilt sev
eral times before her final demise
The Laplanders drink a great deal ol
smoked snow wbter and one of the na
tional drinks of the Tonquinese is ar

Mrs Mosolys young spinster friend
closed the sitting room door of the pretty
Kensington flat and prepared for a revela
tion of connubial tyranny and iniquity
Read that cried Mrs Mosely hold
ing out at arms length a newspaper with
her thumb nail pressed viciously into one
corner of an advertisement column and
then bursting into fresh tears
Mildred Clarke read as follows

sL tomplato committing such a crime
Because I gotl from a man on this lotam sur0 ho isbbad enough for
thing Onlv tho day before yesterday
just because I said I wished I had never
seon his face ho was so provoking in con
sequencoof tho eggs being boiled hard he
said that if I really meant it he would go
abroad and start life again in one of the
colonics It shows that his mind was
running on deserting me Oh Mildred
what can I do
I hardly know dear It looks seri
ous
Have yon any schome in your mind
Mildred
Yes First of all we will answer the
advertisement in person
In person
Fnrtnnntelvl havo never vet succeeded
in meeting your husband so ho doesnt
know me You shall accompany mo as a
old axiom of how to be healthy wealthy friendf for proprietys sake in disguise
ana wise ior me nrsc ac leasu tnese you Know
any
An hour later two ladies were shown
into tho private offico of Mr Mosely
1 Are you tho gentleman who has adver
tised under tho name Carlo asked Mil
dred
Er yes but replies should bo mado
by letter
I thought a personal interview might
bo more satisfactory thrn r letter in a case
of this kind I hope I
Ok not at all Im sure I am only too
delighted to havo the opportunity of I
suppose I id ay take it that you are your
self an applicant ahem that you are in
terested in tno matter on your own ac
count
Quito so It occurred to mo that
You find tho position embarrassing
It certainly is rather comical But let us
I treat tho matter in a busincssliko way I
presume this lady is
1 My friend You may speak as if we
were alone
Well then you will havo learned from
the advertisement that I am 35 vears of
He set up a dismal groaning which age aml a bachelor
soon drew a crowd of hyenas around I am going to Australia next month
him
and it is my desire if I am lucky enough
to find a suitable lady who is willing to
He explained to them that the davs niarry me to tako out an English wife
I sha11 be ablG to Prduce
of his kingship were over and with J 2vifcn
tears pouring down his face protested act profs hink of n Position
f good character and income
that he was unable to defend himself fe
laj j at least h he went
against even the weakest of his enemies that will
you give mo some encourage
On learning this the hypocritical ment and that good heavens ray wife
sympathy before shown by the hyenas has fainted
changed at once to open malice Thev He ran forward and caught her in his4
threw themselves nnnn tho Tirnsrrnr arms The words my wife told Mil
dred in a flash that Mr Mosely had known
Ethel all the time in her disguise
Ethel darling ho cried as his wife
opened her eyes its all a joke I knew
you all tho time The advertisement is for
a friend of mine How can you doubt mv
glad I took the precaution to dust my faithfulness littlo wife
hide with strychnine before I tested the Oh Carlo It isnt true is it You
kindness of these good friends A aro uot Poing to desert me
low learns something by having been
in politics
So saying he calmly went to sleep
Criterion
But how did
you recognize me Carlo Mrs Mosely
asked
1 rincipally by that uncommon bangle
which you forgot to take off I had been
thinking what you would be likely to do
if you happened to see tho advertisement
Then tho general pubic would not know
that Carlo was likely to bo found at Mr
Mosely s office rather than at one of the 50
other offices in this building Finally you
seem to have forgotten that though I had
never before met Miss Mildred Clarke her
photograph isln your album
But I must ask you said Mrs Mosely
severely to give me an explanation as to
tho real Carlo
He is an old schoolfellow of mine Wo
drew up tho advertisement together and I
let him use this address I adopted the
word Carlo for the simple reason that
one word would seem as well as another
and Carlo occurred to mo first The
bachelors name is Herbert Carter You
shall seo him
Mr Mosely rang his bell
A tall and handsome man entered and
was presented to tho two ladies
Miss Clarke I may tell you said Mr
Mosely has called in reply to your ad
vertisement
Mildred blushed and attempted an in
dignant denial but the curious fact re
mains that in tho following month she
went out to Australia as Mrs Herbert

The Streets of Ancient Athens
It has been said that the streets
Athens when the city was the center
of
of
attraction of the wrrriri i ocnm
tiled those of Bulgarian and Turkish towns
by their narrowness and irregularity
Strangers when they first walked along
them used to be in doubt whether they
uuuiu uavo arrivea in so famous a city
Owing to the labors of the members of the
uerman Archaeological institute it has be
come certain that Athens possessed one
Biireet at least which was tolerably wide
It was laid out between the Dipylon at the
wall on the northwest and the Agora and
was therefore north of the Thesoion The
wiatn ot the roadway was about 10 meters
or S3 feet As the Greeks with all their
ability had not Macadams shrewd noca
the ancient street was made up of layers
ui eartn wnicn required repairs constant
ly One reason for the exceptional breadth
was mai originally a brook ran along on
side and when it was covered over the ad
aitionai space was allowed to increase
road London Architeot
the
Billed Firearms
In the South Kensington museum are
several wheel lock muskets with rifled
barrels made during the reign of Charles
I if not earlier Such barrels were then
usually called screwed Zachary Grey
in a note on Hudibras part i canto iii
line 533 says that Prince Rupert showed
his skill as a marksman by hitting twice in
succession tho vano on St Marys Stafford
at 60 yards with a screwed pistol
