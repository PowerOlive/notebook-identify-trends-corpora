The Burglar's Umbrella. ,
Among a collection of articles tatft
by burglars when engaged in their a-1
farious calling Is one particular con-f
trivance that arouses great interest
In appearance It resembles a large
umbrella that has seen hard service.
It was formerly the property of a bur
glar, and It was by its means that he
was able to enter the second story of a
building. Removing the cover, a stick
wound with ropes is revealed. The
sticfi opens like a telescope or a joint
ed fishing rod. Wound round it is a
rope ladder made of strong material
and about thirteen feet in length. The
ladder is only wide enough for one
foot to be placed on the rungs. The
extending stick was used to raise one
end of the ladder to the window
through which the operator wished to
enter, and on the upper end of the
ladder are two hooks to be fastened
to the sill. This imitation umbrella is
regarded as one of the most ingenious
affairs ever made use of by a thief.
London Standard.
Took the Shilling.
A recruiting sergeant one day met an
ignorant youth idling, with his hands
in his pockets and standing before a
house on the front of which was a
notice informing the public that the
building was to be sold. The notice
ran thus: "To Be Sold by Private
Treaty."
The sergeant approached the youth
and asked him if he had ever thought
of joining the army.
"Not me," was the reply. "You'd
have nothing in the army worth talk
ing about."
"Is that so?" said the other. "Well,
how is it then Private Treaty has a
house for sale and him only a private
yet?"
The youth looked thougntful and
puzzled, and presently, over a pint of
ale, the possibility of owning a house
by joining the army grew into a cer
tainty and the shilling changed hands.

Wonderful Animalculae.
Of all the minute creatures that in
habit this globe unseen by the naked
eye there is none so astonishing, ac
cording to the Scientific American, as
the little living things that live in
! stagnant water. They are called slip
per animalculae, or, as the scientist
has it, the Paramecium. These tiny,
invisible things develop so rapidly that
if they were able to live through 350
generations they would, crowd every
other living thing off the face of the
earth and form a mass, larger than the
planet itself. Should they go on re
producing until the nine hundredth
generation these little creatures would
form a mass large enough to crowd
the- moon and stars and even the sun
entirely out of space. Luckily for us
this is not possible, according to na
ture's decree. The Paramecium dies
after it has attained the one hundred
and seventieth generation, and so the
awful possibilities are checked of its
multiplying to fill the universe.

ALL MY PIMPLES GONE

"I was ashamed of my face," writes
Miss Minnie Pickard of Altamahaw,

scars, but after using D. D. D. Pre

no sign of that Eczema, and that was

D. D. D. has become so famous as
a cure and instant relief in Eczema J
and all other serious skin diseases,
that its value is oometimes overlooked
In clearing up rash, pimples, black

The fact is, that while D. D. D. is
so penetrating that it strikes to the
very root of Eczema or any other seri

are so carefully compounded there Is
no wash for the skin made that can

Japan's Snapping Turfla Farm."
One of the oddest farms in the worli
turns out each year tens of thousands
of snapping turtles and has solved the
problem of preserving the supply of
what is to the Japanese as great
a delicacy as diamond back terra

Certain of them are set apart as breed

A Resourceful Badger.
An English artist while painting a
sea piece discovered a badger's lair and
thought to play the animal a practical
joke. Gathering together a bundle of
grass and weeds, he placed it inside
the mouth of the hole and, igniting it
with a match, waited for the ignomini
ous flight of the astonished household
er. But Master Badger was a resource
ful animal and not disposed to be
made a butt of practical jokers. He
came up from the depths of his hole
as soon as the penetrating smoke told
him that there was a fire on the prem
ises and deliberately scratched earth
on the burning grass with his strong
claws until all danger was past No
human being could have grasped the
situation, more quickly or displayed
greater skill in dealing with an un
familiar event

city ordinance to drive at the speed

me to the judge and pay your fine."
"What is the fine?" inquired the
doctor.

Quarantine Declared.
Scabbies in sheep in Kentucky i3
being' stamped out so rapidly by the
methods now being used that the
quarantine against about twenty-five
counties in Western Kentucky, west
of Green River, will bf lifted within
the next few months. The State Live
Stock Sanitary Board held a meeting
recently and heard a report from Dr.
A. J. Payne, of the National Govern
ment, who is conducting the fight
against scabies lin Kentucky. Dr.
Payne said the situation is much bet
ter and the scabies is being stamped
out even faster than he had hoped.
He recommended that a Quarantine be
established1 against all states which
use any but the same dip used in this
State. The board declared the
quarantine in effect so that only the
Btates which use the tobacco dip,
which is used officially in Kentucky,
can ship sheep into the State.
Dr. Payne reported that ninety-two
counties are working to eradicate
scabies. In sixty-five of these coun
ties infection has been found. In
twenty-seven counties practically no
work is being done- In three of these
twenty-seven counties, namely,
Breathitt, Knott and Letcher, the
County Judge has failed to appoint a
county live stock inpscetor. Three
fourths of the counties that are not
pushing this work are located in the
eastern section of the State.
He reported that 534,267 sheep had
been inspected during the past three
months and found to be free from
scabies ; 845 had been found exposed ;
39,762 were found infected wih
scabies. This makes a total of 574,874
sheep that have been inspected in the
last three months. The Assesors' re
pcrt show that Jthere are 650,000 as
sessed in the State. He also reported
that there had been 50,925 sheep dip
ped under official supervision. This
report is somplete up to July 1.
