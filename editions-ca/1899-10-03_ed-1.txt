pulled it lifted it into atree played a fine deck stroke into a bunkerand made extraordinary straight long-distanceputts in which the ball hopped geniallyacross the hole into the long grass whichskirted the greenAt first the players demeanor was ominously sweet he seemed positively to enjoyhis strokes then he grew mad then he grewapparently careless though his caddie noticed the carelessless was only assumed ashe was pressing horribly The worst ot golfis that you can never deceive either yourcaddie or your ball At last at the seventhhole he grew wonderfully calm and marchedoff to the next teeing ground remarking tohis trembling caddie that he would nottrouble to hole out After an easy preliminary swing or two he topped his ball whichtrickled away about 20 yards

joyWhen I was a boyWhen tears never blinded my eyeBut with hope and careAnd an earnest prayerWill bring all that has gone away-Harvey P Layton in Atlanta Constitutiont m i i i f m h m jisrxlA yAKVV

Bronzegates had taken themselves off and a considerable number of servants and followers were enjoying here the results of piratical raids on the supper tablesOutside however everything was in order for De Leyva was a thorough soldierI found both the Spaniard and De Briconnctcursing their luck at being on the guardsand attacking a capon which they werewashing down with copious draughts ofFuiemian Their duties kept thorn outside and it wis a poor supper they weremaking by the light of torches seated together on the steps of the VaticanWhat out already eavaliere askedDe Briconnet Is the cardinal goingNo but there is a little business I answered as l called JacopoXom eiu diable Can I not comeIt would be a relaxation said De LeyvaI am afraid not gentlemen although wethank you Here Jacopo Get three ofour ieiows and toow me j en uiuomerseto hold their horsesIt was done in a twinkling and in a fewsteps having harked back we were in thePapal gardens The casino or summer houseof the pope was in full light and we directedour steps there without difficulty I madetwo of our men walk in front Jacopo andthe third behind us and we remained inthe middle Strict orders were given tohave swords ready and to use them atonceExcept for the moonlight the gardensthemselves were not illuminated and aswe tramped along the paths l thought tomyself how easy it would have been forMichelotto to have got rid of both St Armapde and myself if we had been foolsenough to go without escortNothing happened We reached thecasino and waited tnere a full hour butthere was no sign ofAt last I lost patienceHe never meant to cross a sword withyou chevalier I can bear witness you werehere and kept tryst We have escaped afelons blow together Come back it isgetting late even for his eminence W eturned and made our way back but it wasa good two hours before DAmboise retiredBayard had gone on long before decliningaU oders of escort When we reached thepalace we found he had arrived safelyI wished St Armande a good night withmore respect for him in my heart than Iever felt before and turned to seek myapartments Late as it was however therewas to be no sleep for me as De Briconnetwhose brain the Falerian had merely mademore lively insisted on accompanying meand we split another ilask and talked offalconry till the verge of the morningCHAPTER XVIIITHE OPAL RINGHis eminence will await the SignorDonati at supper this eveningDefaure delivered his message receivedhis answer and tripped away his littlepages cap set jauntily en the side of hishead and the haft of his dagger clinkingagainst the silver chain which held it tohis belt As for me my heart leaped at thewords for I felt sure my business was comeand summoning Jacopo I gave him thenecessary orders to have our men in readiness for an immediate start I then soughtSt Armande and toid him what I expectedI am ready he said simplyVery well then sup lightly and awaitnie in my apartmentsI turned back and on reaching my roomswas surprised to find I had a visitor awaiting me It was Corte As I have said hehas cast rside his fantastic dress and wasrobed as a doctor He still kept his heavybook under his arm and the features ofhis curious seamed face and thin bloodlesslips were as pale as if he had arisen fromthe dead His eyes alone blazed with anunnatural brill tancy but he was outwardlycalm1 came but to see if you were safe signore after last night he said as he tookmy handThanks I replied offering him a seatwe are all quite safe Nothing happenedThe don was not there Either he hadchanged his mind or we were too strongin iorceA little of both I should think he saidwith a thin smile as he placed his book onthe table Signore he went on are younot a little surprised and curious to see meamWell Mcsser Corte I will own to itBut 1 am honestly glad that fortune hasgiven the wheel a right turn for yoult is not fortune he said it is something greater It is fate No chance turnof the wiieel of a sleeping goddess WhenI Bed from you signore on that day hisvoice choked a little 1 came to RomeNever mind how Here a great man foundtne Great men pick up little things fortheir purposes sometimes And MatthewCorte who is but a little man knowsthings the great man doe3 not know IIoho and he laughed mirthlesslyAnd that has put crown- in your purseYes crowns in my purse crowns in mypurse he repeated and then the old madness came upon him and he rose and pacedthe room 1 could have done it last nightmade the hilt of my dagger ring a ainsthis heart the devil the devil But he isnot to die this way not thus not thusHe will die as no other man has died andit will come soon very soon Mat hewCorte swears thisHe stopped suddenly and turned to mewith the questionHave you ever seen a mad dog dieNo answered wondering what wouldcome nextWell my dog is deadI am sorry I began but he interruptedDead I say Life went from it in writhings and twistings in screams of agonythe little beast poor little beast I wouldhave ended iia misery but I wanted to secI wanted to find some death so horrible thatit would pass the invention of man AndI have found it signore See this toy ofa knife This fairys dagger and he heldup a tiny lancet only a touch of it anda man would die as that dog did in writhings in twistings in screamsI rose and put my hand on his arm keeping my eyes steadily on his faceCorte I said this is not like you Youarc not well Here is some wine and Ipoured him out a goblet of Orvieto Hedrained it at a gulp and sat with his headburied in his handsAs he sat there the scene in the lonelyhut when I went forth an outcast fromArezzo came back to me and there rosebefore me the dim light of the torch themad figure of my host and I could almosthear the pattering of the rain and the dying hisses of the log fire without Then Isaw other things as well and a pity cameon me for the man before me A suddenthought struck me and acting on the impulse of the moment I spokeSee here Corte You are ill you wantrest quiet Throw off these dark thoughtsand do what I say Two miles from Colzain the Bergamasque lies a small farm Itis mine Mine still though mortgaged Gothere Ask for the Casino Savelli and payyou have come from me from Ugo di Savelli You know my name now and thewill want nothing more from you Livethere until you are better or as long asyou like The air is pure in the hills thereis the boqueton for you to hunt the lifeis good Will you do thisHe lifted his head and looked at meThen rising he placed one hand on eachol my shoulders thin hands they were withlong bony fingers that held like clawsSignore he raid with emotion Donatior Savelli whoever yu are you are agood man I thank you but it cannot beCood byAnd lifting up his book heturned and strode out of the room leavingme a little chilledAfter that 1 waited for my meeting withDAmboise 1 saw to the packing of avalise went down and looked at the homesclosely inspected the arms and mountmy men who looked capable of anythingand in one way and another managed toget through the time until about the sixthhour when his eminence supped I presented myself punctually and was ushered intoan inner apartment which 1 had not hitherto seen and where the supper was evidently to be held for the table was set outthere I was alone at first and seating myself on a lounge looked abeut me Theroom was small but beautifully fitted Dpand had all the appearance of being thecardinals private study By my side wasa table on which was spread a map withvarious crosses marked on it in red chalkthe chalk itself lying on the map whereit had been carelessly Hung In front ofwe was an altar surmounted by a silvercrucifix bearing an exquisitely carvedChrist Near it in a corner leaned a longstraight sword from whose cross handlehung a pair of fine steel gauntlets Resting on a cushion placed on a stand wasthe cardinals hat atid behind the stand1 could sec the brown outline of a pair ofriding boots and the glitter of burnishedspurs In a corner of the room was alarge table set out with writing materialsand covered with papers Running my eyesover these idly I finally let them rest onthe supper table which was arranged withlavish profusion The curtains of the windows were drawn and the light from eighttall candles in jeweled holders fell on therose and amber of the wine in the quaintllasks on the cheerful brown crusts of thepasties on the gay enameling of the comlitures and on the red gold of the plate Inoticed too that the table was set forthree only lt was evidently a private supper where things were to be discussed andI became glad for I felt already a step onwards towards winning back my name andI seemed to see in the mirror on the wallto my left a vision of a woman with darkhair and dark eyesYour eminence I fairly started up 1ad not observed the entrance of DAmboise until he stood beside me and touchedme lightly on the shoulderDreaming cavalierc 1 did not thinkyou were so given 1 am afraid that late asI am I must still keep you from your supper for I expect another guest Ila thereie isIndeed as he spoke the door swung opennoiselessly and Machiavelli entered Hewas plainly and simply dressed and woreno sword merely a dagger at his side Ithought however I caught the gleam of asteel corselet under his vest as he greetedthe cardinal and DAmboises own sipphire was not more brilliant than the singleopal which blazed in the secretarys handThis is the Cavalierc Donati your excellency said the cardinal but 1 think youknow each otherMachiavelli extended his hand to me withhis inscrutable smile but as 1 met his eyesI saw that they were troubled and anxiousHe however spoke with easy unconcernWell met Messer Donati I can only sayI am sorry we parted so soon I would havegiven much to have had you in Florence fora few days moreYour excellency is most kindSt Dennis said the cardinal but areyou gentlemen going to exchange compliments and starve instead of sitting down tosupper Burin are we not ready and heturned to his gray haired major domo whohad entered the roomYour eminence is served replied theman and we took our seats on each sideof the table DAmboise between usYou need not wait Burin but remain inthe passage Burin stepped out silentlyand the cardinal said with an air of apology You must not mind so informal a repast gentlemen but we have much to discuss pleasure first however my maitredhotel has an artists soul and he will havea lit if we do not touch this pastyThe cardinal ate and talked I now andthen put in a word but the secretary wasvery silent and hardly touched anythingSt Dennis said DAmboise but yourexcellency is a poor trencherman And Iheard so much of youYour eminence will excuse me when Isay 1 have bad newsDAmboise became grave at once Letme say how sorry I am It is not a matterof stare and he glanced meaningly at thesecretaryNot in the least but much worse a domestic matter 1 do not see why 1 should nottell you That cursed brigand Caglioni hasseized on my ward Angiola Castellani andholds her a fast prisoner in Perugia1 felt cold all over to my feetThe Lady Angiola 1 exclaimedPrecisely said Machiavelli dryly Ithink you have metBut this can be easily remedied burstin DAmboise a demand from the Signorya word from FranceWill not bring the dead to life againput in the secretaryMy God 1 burst out 7she is not deadWorse than that he Aaid it was doneby Cesares ordersThen Cesare Borgia will pay with hislife for this I exclaimedAt this moment there was a knock at thedoor and Burin entered bearing a silverflnTon the stopper of which was made ofa quaintly carved dragonYour eminence ordered this with thesecond service he said placing it beforePAmboise and retiringI pledge you my word your excellencythat I will not rest until full reparation hasbeen made for this outrage on an ally ofFrance said DAmboise I could almostfind it in my heart to let loose open war forthisWe are not ready your eminence Restassured of my thanks and I will gladly accept your aid but at present we can donothing This however has not decreasedmy zeal for the measures we are planningand with your permission we will now discuss these and put aside my privatetroubleFor me I could hardly breathe A hundred feelings were tossing together withinme all that I could think of was to throwaside everything to gallop to Perugia tosave her at any cost The cardinals voicecame to me as from a distanceI agree one glass each of this all roundand then eavaliere would you mind handing me those glassesThree peculiar shaped straw colored Venetian glasses were close to me these 1passed onwards mechanically to DAmboiseand he went on filling the glasses to thebrim With wine from the flagon as he spoke1 admired the rare workmanship of thisfagon last night and his holiness sent ithome with me full to the brim with thisFlernian which Giulia Bella herself pouredinto it The wine is of a priceless brandand our lord was good enough to say that if1 liked it he would send me all in his cellars if I only let him knewWe will drink this then with your eminences permission to the success of the undertaking said the secretary poising hisglass in the airRight said DAmboise Gentlemensuccess to our ventureHe raisnl the wine to his lips I silentlydid the sameHold onWe stopped in amaze and Machiavelliwho had spoken quietly emptied his glassinto a bowl beside himWhat docs this mean said the cardinalThis your eminence and Machiavelliheld out his hand on which an opal wasflashing a moment before The stone wasstill there in the geld band on his fingerbut it was no longer an opal but somethingblack as jet devoid of all lusterStartled by the movement DAmboisebent over the extended fingers and Ia Tft MPAmt r i it i JThe lorpia -will rue thi3 daylowed his example The red on the cardinals cheek went out and his lips paled as helooked at the ringPoison Heart of Jesus he mutteredthrough pale lipsYes said Machiavelli slowly withdrawing his hand the ring tells no liesDiavolo Was ever so grim a jest Askingou to tell him if your eminence liked thewinelt was too near a matter to be pleasantand the hideous jest and the treachery ofAlexander idled me with a hot anger Ithad the effect however of pulling me together at once the sudden presence of deathand the danger recalling me to myself forall my thoughts of Angiola I breathed aprayer of thanks for our escape It was agood omen My luck was not yet run outDAnjboise sprang to his feet By Ghe said bringing his clenched fist into thepalm of his hand the Borgia will rue thisday here give me those glasses He seizedthem and drawing back the curtain Hungthem out of the window where they fellinto the court outside breaking to splinterswith a little tinkling crash Then heemptied out the contents of the flagon andhurled it into the grate where it lay itsfine work crushed and dented the two emerald eyes of the dragon on the stopperblinking at us wickedly This outburstmade DAmboise calmer and it was withmore composure that he struck a small gongand reseated himself at the table As hedid so Burin entered the roomWe want a clear table said the cardinal removeUiese things and hand me thatmapBy the time Burin had done this his eminence showed no further trace of excitement except that his lips were very firmlyset and there was a slight frown en his forehead as he sm6othed out the roll of the mapOne corner kept obstinately turning up andas Machiavelli quietly put his hand on it tokeep it in position he said See Thering is as it was beforeWe looked at the opal and sure enoughthe poison tint was gone and under thepale semiopaque blue of its surface lightsof red of green and of orange flitted to andfroIt is wonderful I said and DAmboisesmiled grimly to himself The cardinalplaced his finger on the map where the portof Sinigaglia was markedIs it here ho landsYes replied Machiavelli and thenstraight to RomeYou have sure informationYesThen will your excellency instruct MDonati As arranged 1 pledge an immediate movement on the part of Tremouilleat the iirst sign of successYou have agreed eavaliere to undertakethe task and the secretary turned to meI have your excellencyMachiavelli then went on speaking incisively wasting no words In ten davs orthereabouts from now Monsignore Bozardothe Papal envoy to the Grand Turk willland at Sinigaglia and start ior Rome Hebrings with him A letter and a sum of money40000 ducats These are for his holinessBozardo and the letter may reach if youlike the ducats must notWhere are they to goTo the Duke de la Tremouille1 followthtferstand that you

margin I will stopBozardo or die but 1 propose effecting therelease of the Lady Angiola as wellA glad look came into Machiavellis eyesbut the cardinal flashed outNom du Diable What grasshopper haveyou got in your head Leave the demoiselleto us You cannot do two things at onceThen with respect to your eminence Idecline the affair of the ducatsDAmboise looked at me in sheer amazementYou decline you dare but MachiavelliinterposedA moment your eminence Can we getanother agentNot now it is too late nowAnd we have no money for active measuresNot a livreIt seems to me that the eavaliere has usin his hands and we had better agree Afterall he only risks his head twice instead ofonceDAmboise bit his lips and with a frownbegan to drum on the table with his fingersI sat silent but resolved and Machiavellirising went to the writing table pullingout from his vest a parchment In this herapidly wrote something and dusting itever with drying powder held it to the flameof a candle Then he turned back leisurelyand as he resumed his seat handed me thepaperI have just filled in your name on thisblank uafe conduet through the PapalStates I took the precaution of obtainingthis from Sforza to day When can youstartNow your excellency and 1 put thesafe conduct securely by1 suppose I must agree said the cardinal suddenly If it fails all is lost if itsucceedsThere will probably be a new Conclaveyour eminence said MachiavelliDAmboises forehead flushed dark at thehidden meaning in the Florentines wordsBut we all knew that the chair of St Peterwas ever before his eyes and for this heschemed and saved although profuse in hishabits George of Amboise never gainedhis desire but when he died he left a fartune of eleven millions This however wasyet to beI had already risen to take my leave asMachiavelli spoke and the cardinal takingno notice of his last remark turned to mewith something of his old good temper Perhaps the hint of Florentine support at thenext papal election was not

to DAmboise and the secretaryand withdrew but as the door swung behind me I heard Machiavellis voiceThe air of Rome does not suit me youreminence No thanks No more FalernianTO BE CONTINUEDviA HERO OF
