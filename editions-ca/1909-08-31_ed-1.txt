Neither of these ques questions Â¬tions were answered in the former formerpledgespledges To strengthen that point it is isprovIded isprovidedprovided in this pledge that the owner ownerbecomesbecomes

point in his county countythat countythatthat may maybe be named by the Board ofControl of ofControlControl of his county There are two tworea tworeasonsreasons rea sons why that should be in the

three crops cropsII believe some one In the meeting meetinghas meetinghashas suggested that this matter has hasbeen hasbeenbeen referred to some of the local attorneys at attorneys Â¬torneys and it was their opinion that thataa landlord could not compel a division divisionofof his crop but it would have to be besold besoldsold as a whole because a divisionmight division divisionmightmight injure the tenant financially It Itwould Itwouldwould not injure the landlord as his hishalt hishaifhalf would go into the pool but it itmight itmightmight injure the tenant because jie jiewas he e ewaswas standing on the outside I believe believeitit was agreed upon by all the attor attorI attorneys attorneys Â¬I neys here ill conference yesterday that thatsuch thatsuchsuch was not the law Even taking

that he would not notsell notsellsell without the consent ot the tenant tenantoror that the crop should be sold as a awhole awholewhole Of course if he makes that thatagreement thatagreementagreement

thepastpast was that when a man would sell sellhis sellhishis tobacco out of the society in viola violationot violation Â¬tion tionot of his contract there was no way wayof wayofof arriving at the damages How was wasthe wasthethe society damaged It was a so society society Â¬ciety without capital It was repre representing represeating Â¬senting other people and it was a ques question question
