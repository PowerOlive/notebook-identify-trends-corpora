Direct from its second year at
the Cohan Theatre, New York City,
"Potash & Perlmutter" comes to j&e
Paris Grand Opera House on Thurs
day, Sept. 10th. No announcement
could be of greater interest to the
theatre-goers of this city, who have
heard so much about this most re
markable of comedies.
"Potash & Perlmutter" is an "up-to-date
garment in three pieces,"
made from the material in Montague
Glass' famous stories in The Satur
day Evening Post, and "trimmed
with a thousand laughs, and guaran
teed to fit all sizes and ages." No
play within the memory of the oldest
theatre-goer made a quicker or great

lightful dramatization of the joys and
sorrows, trials and triumphs of the
two quaint, lovable .partners who are
business men to the tips of their
fingers, but soft hearted to a fault,

Greatest Shoe Store
to the stirring story of "Potash &
Perlmutter." Abe and Morris are
seen first in their modest down-town
factory and salesroom on the verge
of bankruptcy, because a rival firm
has employed the prize designer
whose Arverne Sacque has no equal
in the trade. How Abe and Morris
secure this designer and then, when
on the way to a fortune, risk their all
to save from unjust imprisonment &
poor young Russian refugee; how
they get o'ut of their difficulties while
Morris wins the designer fo rlife and
A"be gets a fine son-in-law; how the
partners quarrel and make up, and
quarrel and make up again and
again, is told in three acts that fairly
teem with laughs, although at times
the tears will come to the eyes of the
audience.
It is the wonderful heart-interest
of "Potash & Perlmutter" that ac
counts as much as anything else for
its wonderful grip on the public. It
is intensely human, intensely true.
The sale of seats will begin Mon
day, September 7th, at 9 a. m. at Box
Office of Alamo Theatre.
