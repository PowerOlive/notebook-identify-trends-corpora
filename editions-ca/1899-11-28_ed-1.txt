the battle ofBelmont bear a stereotyped characterproving that the hand of the censorhad been at work upon them Theyare too incoherent to enable the readerto form an accurate idea of the eventor to

the Britih infantry in the face ofterrific fire while the Boers gunwere splendidly served the gunnersstanding by them with dogged determination exposing themselves untilthe very last moment and only becoming wild and inaccurate in their aimduring the final deadly charge of theBritish infantryAll admit however that the victorycould uot be properly followed up andutilized owing to the want of

The newspaper puts hisadvertisement before hundreds of readersregularly twice a week and the advertisement may be changed in form adozen times The advertising cards whichare put up in public places only remainthere a week or so sometimes and thebusiness mans money might as wellhave been poked in a rat bole Thusare some men led to believe that advertising doesnt payTURKEYSWe will connience to
