THE CHINESE EAR CLEANER
One of the Strange Sights to Be Seen
In Manila Street
In this city of strange and unusual
sights there is probabiy pothing that
appears so strange at first sight to
the American as the Chinese ear clean
er pursuing his calling on the street
corners The Chinaman so engaged is
provided with a stool and a small
bamboo case in which are inclosed
his instruments
The Filipino is just as sure of hav
ing his ears cleaned on Sunday as an
American is of having a shave and in
fraud who was npstars came to her j the by streets aud alleyways they line
leLiance but the burglar had broken up for all the world like a barber
shop on Sunday morning the only
difference being the Chinaman cant
say next
First of all the Chino takes a razor
which looks more like a propeller
blade than anything else and wiping
the victims face with a wet rag pro
ceeds to mop the dirt therefrom While
watching this part of the proceedings
I was surprised at the flexibility of the
native nose as demonstrated by the
skillful fingers of the operator To
windward to leeward on Its stern
beam and bow the natives nose is
rapidly twisted to avoid the aforesaid
razor Having removed the real
tate from the natives face the China
man turns to the more difficult task
of ear cleaning The smallest spot of
dirt and the tiniest nesh worm is re-
moved before the operation is com
plete and from the heavenly
I sion one would imagine that the oper
ation was anything but pleasant Ma-

Newspaper Obituaries
By this time one would think near
ly everybody has ceased to wonder
at the way In which newspapers can
come out with column after column of
biography the very morning after
some eminent person has passed away
and it is an open secret that a care
fully written life has been pigeon
holed in the office for months nay
years before
Biographies interviews personal
paragraphs all yield their quota to the
compiling of an obituary but in some
cases the subject has the grewsome

troubles and is often the result of an
inherited taint in the blood S S S

My son Charlie was afflicted from infancy
with Scrofula and he suffered so that it was
impossible to dress him

head and body were a
mass of gores and his
eyesight also became
affected No treatment
was spared that we

him but he grew worse
