While here they gathered a large
fund of data and information regard

spent several nights auto-camping
on the C. B. Laysbn farm, which
was originally owned by John Mil
ler. They were en route to Cali

FOKMER, PARISIAN CLAIMS RE
MARKABLE INVENTION
(Carlisle Mercury)
Tuesday mornin'g a lepresentative
of The Mercury viewed a demonstra
tion' of the working model of a water-power
machine, invented by Mr.
M. A. Ritter, who is at present em
ployed at the Neal Bakery in Car
lisle. Mr. Ritter, who was born in Ger
many, and came to this country in
IS 70, at the age of ten years, has
been working on this machine for
twenty-two years. He is still en
thusiastic over the possibilities of
the machine and to a layman, at
least, his invention seems to have
great possibilities.
The power is furnished by a five
foot overshot wheel, of the type
used. in old water mills in past days.
A small 1-S horse power motor is
used to start the two 3-inch cylin
der pumps, which work alternately.
The water is delivered to the over
shot wheel, which revolves rapidly.
A 24-inch drive wheel, attached to
the overshot wheel is intended to
furnish the power to operate a dy
namo. The dynamo will furnish
lights and at the same time charge
a storage battery, from which the
motor, the original power, can be
operated indefinitely.
Mr. Ritter has in mind the fur
nishing of a cheap motive power for
lighting country homes. His inven
tion may also be used to heat a
home. In fact he stated that he in
tended to put a machine in operation
in Carlisle this fall, and furnish
both heat and light to a local home.
The power developed by the ma
chine, the inventor states, is con
tingent upon, the size of the overshot
wheel and the power of the pumps
which furnish water to the wheel
cups. Theoretically, at least, suffi
cient power might be developed to
run large machinery.
The perfected machine will run
on ball bearings, which will elimin
ate friction and also prolong the
life of the machine. In fact the
wearing parts "is the only thing that
can prevent it from lasting indefi
nitely. As in the history of most inven
tions, Mr. Ritter has worked long
and faced many disappointments. A
patent was granted him in 1907,
but a patent on an improved motiel
was denied him in September, 1921,
on the ground that the machine was
an attempt at "perpetual motion."
Several substantial business men
in Paris became interested in Mr.
Ritterls invention, when he lived in
that place, but the failure to secure
a patent has prevented the perfec
tion 'of a marketable machine.
The model -now in Carlisle is in a
rear room of the old Conley House,
where Mr. Ritter will gladly demon
strate it to anyone who is interested.
The mechanic might be able to
find the flaw in this rather wonder
ful piece of mechanism, but, as has
been observed, it appears most feasi
ble to the layman.

DEVELOPING INTELLECTUAL
GROWTH IN BOYS AND
YOUNG MEN.
Alfred J. Westendorf, formerly
of New York, now with the Babson
Institute, Wellesley, Mass., where
young men are trained for high ex
ecutive positions, has earned an en
viable reputation, through a hobby
of his, as a developer of permanent
"root" growth in boys and young
men. He is one of those men who
has time to think of and with oth
ers. Some of the magazines have
referred to him as a national friend,
others call him another Doctor Con
well or Judge Lindsay.
He possesses a very inquisitive
mind when it comes to the welfare
of young people. He is always won
dering about what is being done
and what might be done. During
the past two years at his own ex
pense and in his, quiet way he has
been carrying on a survey with ref
erence to high school activities
throughout the country. He want
ed to know what they were think
ing about and what they are doing.
He found that piactical school men
everywhere were clamoring and crav
ing for definite and concrete exam
ples of school activities. That bet
ter ideas were in demand every
where. To serve these people is the
thing that urged him on in these in
vestigations. Mr. Westendorf found that lack of
interest on the part of the pupils in
many cases was due to lack of con
centrated effort on the part of the
school. That it was due to not hav
ing the work hung on a definite hook
He found that many schools by
simply giving their present methods
a new twist might become 1000
more productive. He found loads of
schools carrying on splendid Thrift f
campaigns, but in Olathe, Kansas,
for instance, the pupils are not sim
ply urged to save, but are trained
from the fifth grade up to prepare
to meet their own graduation ex
pense. It is not only a fine train
ing, but unconsciously it tends to
develop a desire to stay to the fin
ish. It tends to eliminate the drop
ping out habit. It gives thrift an
entirely new color.
In Birmingham, Mich., they are
building up a Scholarship Fund, an
other fine example to follow. The
ordinary variety of "honor roll" is
common everywhere. In the Rich
mond, Indiana, High Schools they
do it in a different way. They ad
vertise the "honor boys" as "guar
anteed boys." It creates an entirely
different effect. These young men
during their senior year are allowed
to spend a part of their time with
out pay, associating and acquaint
ing themselves with the things they
hope to do after graduation. It
gives them a practical opportunity
to demonstrate their worth and it
places them on a much better foot
ing after graduation. This added
kink doubles and trebles effort. We
are told that if we are not trained
to be workers, we unconsciously are
being trained to be Bhirkers
The Pierre Schools of South Da
kota, are radiating a helpful influ
ence over an unusually wide aera.
There are many rural children in
that locality who cannot afford to go
to Pierre for the entire school year.
To meet the need, the high school
teachers of Pierre co operate with
the rural teachers during the first
half of the year, thus reducing the
cost to these children by one-half.
It is a plan that might be copied
and duplicated very effectively in
many other States and sections.
Canton, Ohio, during the past school
year attracted more than 4.000 peo
ple out of a population of 90,000
to its splendid night schools? In
Richmond, Virginia, the second
generation is commencing to reap
the benefits of these special educa-
''tional advantages. The Richmond I

dist church was organized in Nicho-.
lasville in 179S by Rev. John Met-,
calf, and the first church, a frame
building, was erected and dedicated,
during his pastorate, a year later.
In latter years a frame union church
was built, which was used by Meth
odists, Baptists and Presbyterians.
The Methodists built a brick church
of their own in 1846, and this was
dedicated in 1886 by Dr. H. C.
Morrison, and which was destroyed
by fire last December. While the
church is under erection, services
conducted by the pastor, Rev. Madi
so Combs, are being held at the
court house.
REAL ESTATE DEALS
Contractors have broken ground
for the erection of a modern frame
