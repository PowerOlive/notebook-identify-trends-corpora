rotary motion to the spherewhen discharged producing a curvein any direction according as the position of the projecting prongs ischanged There is but one serious defact in the operation of the machinethat will prevent its use in games andtthat is the long time required for reloading This was especially noticeable in Tuesdays game because theintercepting plate was out of orderand the frequent delays therebynecessitated did not allow the game tobe finished Three innings only wereplayed During the first inning thebatsmen were timid about standingnear the plate and the big out curvescaused them to jump back but as thegun threw strikes in every instancethey plucked up courage stood closerto the plate and succeeded occasionally in making safe hits The game wasuninteresting

between his commanderend the civil officers of the law Closehad come home in high dudgeon andwas as usual slow and cautious butmore than usually reluctant and suspicious Fuming over the failure of themission on which he had started soconfidently believing himself trickedby the enemy and now offered amplerevenge an 6 assured of success throughthe information tendered him he nevertheless faltered Lambert returningfrom the round of his sentries wastaken unawares by the sudden questionThis gentleman says the old ladyknew just where we had gone and justwhen we would get back What do youthink of itIts a matter I know nothing aboutbit was the answer except that shedid say she wras writing a letter to begiven you on your return this eveningarid instantly corrected herself by saying on your returnYes Heres the letter by Jove andits a worse jJiizzle than before Andheres the deputy marshal back withincreased powers new orders searchwarrants and God knows what allIm willing enough to back

thatholds nothing but women because youthink some of your jail birds arethereI tell you captain theres no roomfor doubt The negroes have seenthem They told Mr Jaryis here andtold him the mules were to be there before ten oclock to carry em off out ofharms way Your man Murphy admitshe saw one last night one of theScroggses sure by the description andhis brother is with him there Ill beta hatI dont believe it sturdily answeredClose Only last August she turnedWalton Scroggs away from her doorwith such a tongue lashing as I neverheard an thats sayinga good dealShe forbade him ever setting foot within her gates again I heard her sodid half the men in this companyI know all about that He has beenin love with his cousin the elder of theWalton girls as long as I can remember and because of his shiftless habitsthe old lady wouldnt listen to it Thenthey took to meeting by stealth andshe found it out She discharged oldRasmus for no other reason than thathe carried letters for them Ive triedto bribe him twice to tell where WalScroggs was hiding but the old niggersa damn fool with a starving wife tooThey tell me he was seen round herea day or two since asking for Iiiggsand hes been carrying letters againThe old lady wouldnt have him thereliefore perhaps but she wTould shelterhim now when the government demands his surrender But even if shewouldnt Esther Walton would I tellyou theyre there cajtain and theyllbe ofE and out of our reach this night ifyou fail to take them nowClose was pulling on a soldiers overcoat at the moment and stopped tolisten to some sound down the dark recesses of the bottom along the winding streamIts the mules now began Parmelee excitedlyvbut Close held up warning handIf it is my men will nab em thats4iH Now youve been thermeans of myUikin the men on moren one long wild0os chase afoot that telegram ofyours was enough to give the wholescheme away and of my bein invited tobe damn fool enough to fight two duelsthis afternoon Both Col Scroggs andMr

States officers in discharge oftheir duties came and took up theirresidences across the road from CaptCloses camp and dared him to takethem Thats the way itll readby Godif you dont act to nightPor a moment Close simply stared atthe man Parmelee was no fighter manto man steel to steel that the war veteran knew well but the Yankee schoolmaster of ante bellum days had learnedto use his wits and his tongue Hecould argue if he couldnt face a bulletThe stalwart soldier who single-handedhad captured a squad of astonishedtrench defenders before Yicksburgandhad faced the blazing battle line withdauntless front a score of times lookedhelplessly a moment into the face ofthis keen fencer then turned appealingly to the young West Pointer asthough to ask Isnt there somethingin your education to answer this ButLambert was silent Prom first to lastthe lesson taught him at the nationalacademy was subordination of the military to the civil authorityWell go ahead Youre boss I sposeI can only follow What dyou want meto do said CloseI want you to search that house andget those men was Parmelees answerAnd then there wTas another momentof oppressive silence then sudden startand alarmDown the Tugaloo road to the southat the farthest corner of the fencewhich surrounded the Walton placethere was a pathway leading throughthe brush to the level bottom belowSomewhere in this direction but beyond the corner only a few seconds before had been Jieard a sound like thatof a bray nipped suddenly in the budof a mules essay at vocalism checkedsummarily with a club At this pointwhere road and pathway came togetherLambert had posted Private Green areliable soldier of many years experience and when Green challengedthere was reason for it Low and sternhis voice was heard distinctly at thelistening camp Who comes therefollowed almost immediately by thesharp order Halt Halt or I fireWaiting for no order Lambert wasoff like a dart Burns following with alantern Again came the cry r Haltbut the promised shot was not heardEven when running at speed past thegate of the Walton place the youngofficer could not resist a quick glanceat the dark facade of the old homesteadAlready a light was dancing along theportico another gleaming at an upperwindowWhats the matter sentry hepanted as he qame upon the dark figureat the turn of the road Green with hisrifle at ready was peering into thegap in the tangle of shrubberySome one was coming up there sirand ran the instant I challenged Iought to have let him get up to mcandthen halted him but I had regulationsinstead of sense in my head saidGreen a New Englander with a propensity for talk Hes out o harmswayBut Lambert waited to hear no moreWith Burns at his heels he sprang downthe dim pathway and had not gone 30yards before he came upon some struggling object crashing into the brushtowards the stream Halt heshouted and while something haltedother somethings with muttered oathriAvent plunging on He heard a -splashhoofs clattering over gravel the lashing of a whip and then all was stillacross the dark open space throughwhich flowed the sluggish branchBut here among the bushes were twowondering quadrupeds one a muiewith broken bridle rein the other asBurns lantern speedily showed aCherokee pony both saddled A corporal came running to join them and ina moment the beasts were led bacJc tothe road way where

prospectivebridegroom was deeply interestedIn those days poker was more commonly plajed at the statef capital thanit is to day and there were some prettystiff games pulled off in the hotels andstar chambers around town Avhen thelegislature was in session One of theliardest players with which the regularsiiad to deal was young- Jim Rawson ofs 3Egg Harbor He ran a general merchandise store down there and wasmixed np in the oyster trade so that healways had money to burn as the boysisay nowadajsIn the winter of 54 Uawson came toTrenton to help push a bill in which hewas interested throug h the legislatureand one evening he got mixed up in aame of poker in the United States hotelAvith Sol Travers Jerry Holcomb andDick Collins three of the gamiest players that ever drew cards The game wasinnocent enough when it started butalong about three oclock the nextmorning it had assumed proportionscalculated to make an ordinary playergasp when the bets were made Rawson was the youngest man at the tableand had probably played poker less thanany of the others but he had moneyand nerve and the way he used both ofthem made the other three keep theireves onen There wasnt much difference in the mens winnings up toV eakfast time but all of a sudden thecrris got freakish as they will sometimes and began to run against RawJsonThe players wouldnt give up thegame and had breakfast brought tothem They laid down the cards long- enough to eat and then went at it againRawsons hard luck kept up He turned3iis hat around crossed his legs got upind walked around his chair rung innew packs of cards and did everythingthat the superstitious poker player doesto change his luck but it wouldntchange His money kept drifting awayimtil ten oclock in the forenoon whenlie counted up his assets and found thathe had 200 left He had fed about 1800to the tiger and naturally felt a littlesore At last a jackpot was startedabout half past ten oclock and thecards were dealt around a dozen timesmid nobody got openersHurry up boys and open it saidRawson Ive got to catch that 1145train Im going to be manned tonight and I must be in by five oclockrlressed for the occasionRut the boys didnt seem to be ableto hurry They dealt and dealt butsomehow the right kind of ojienerswouldnt fall and finally there was atmug little pot of about 600 on thetable At 1130 Travers opened the potfor 100 Holcomb and Collins stayedI feel just as if X was going to winthat pot said Rawson Avriting somefigures onn piece of paper and throwingit on the center jof the table -with w hatmoney he had left Im shy 50 boysbut I guess Im good for itYour check isas good as yourmoney said TraversEvery bit said Holcomb and ColJinsBut youll never cateh that trainremarked TraversBy thunder explained Rawson Iforgot all about that He looked at hiswatch and found that he had threeminutes in which to get to the stationTheres no use trying to make it nowhe- said theylhhave to postpone the-wedding Xil telegraph that Ive missedsihetniiu At 1145 a messenger wa7vOjwSjsent to the telegraph office yith a dispatch and the game went onThe pot was 1000 strong when themen drew cards and I want to tell you iinow of the most remarkable set ofpoker hands that I ever saw dealtTravers was dealing Holcomb calledfor onb card Collins took one Rawsondrew four and Travers took one Therewas business ahead everybody saw thatTravers made a bid for a raise by betteinp 25 which was lifted 200 by Holcomb and Collins raised that 200 sothat when it came around to Rawson itcost 425 to come in Everybody thoughthe would throw down his cards but hedidnt he slowlv drew a check book outof his pocket and wrote a check ior1000 and shoved it up thus raisingCollins 575You could see right away that theother players thought he was bluffingTravers mot the raise at once and added500 to- it Holcomb saw that andraised it another 500 Collins simplysaw the raise and Rawson lifted it another thousandTravers settled back in liis chair andeved Rawson ior i minute Youve gotpretty good nerve old man he saidbut you cant make me lay down noton a four card draw anyway Thenhe saw RaVsbns thousand raise andincreased it 500I call you said Holcomb shovingin 1500I might as well take a chance formy money said Collins laying 1500 onthe pile Rawson put down anothercheck for 500Well boys said Travers Im sorryfor you Ive got four queens He threwthem on the tableThat beats my four jacks saidHolcomb and my fdur tenssaid Cohlins -but it doesnt beat my four kings1said Rawson spreading out his cardsHe held four ldngs and an ace- Thunderation what a draw exclaimed TraversTwas pretty good said Rawsonraking in the money and I got themall in a bunch I held up an aceRawson pulled in 13000 and 9750of it came out of the pockets of the otherthree men It was the biggest pack potI ever sawHow about the wedding a sited alistenerOh yes I meant to tell you abmtthat said the old settler You sefthe girl that Rawson was going tomarry had a mind of her own and whenthe telegram came saying that he hadmissed the train what did she do butjump aboard the cars and come up toTrenton reaching here about sixoclock in the evening RaAvson wasmighty glad to see her tob They wentout and hunted up a minister and gotmarried Then they came back to thehotel and Ave all had a mighty nice layout I dont know whether the womanever found out why Rawson missed thetrain or not but I reckon if she did shewould have more sense than to kickmuch because she seemed to be apretty level headed girlSpeaking about that being a remarkable set of poker hands said anold

should depend someAvhat upon the nature olthe sickness If the disease is contagious the patient should be removedas far as possible from the other members of the family and no one save thenurse and the physician should be permitted to attend upon or visit him Insuch an event a room at the top of thehouse is best selectedWhatever the nature of the illnesshoAvever the sick room should be onthe sunny side of the house quiet andeasily ventilatedIt is of the Aery first importance thaithe air should be kept pure and freefrom uiiAvholesome odors and to accomplish this an unlimited supply oifresh outdoor air is indispensableIf the room is small the opening of aAvindoAAr is almost sure to create adraught which Avill be felt by the jmtient or his attendant but in a room oieven moderate size one of the AvindoAVScan be kept open at the top withoutcausing discomfort or harm This isone of tlie chief objections to a smallsick room it cannot be properly ventilated and the patient is compelled tobreathe air Avhich hinders hirecoveryAnother important matter in connection AA ith the sick room is its temperature This should be subject to but little A ariation There must thereforebe some means

village where the wagonshave broken through the gravel iswhere there as a stone imbedded in thegravel a stone of the size of a peckmeasure and projecting about threeinches as at Fig 3 The wheels ofheavy wagons have climbed upon thisstone and plunged off on the other sideuntil they have worn entirely throughand it now needs several 3rards of freshgravel drawn to mend it I should saythat the

New EntranceTo New YorkIALMOST A STOBYIt is easy to write a- story -It is easier to write a summer story inwinter or a winter story in summer thanit is to write either in its proper seasonBecause in the dead of winter you canrecall -the pleasures of summer and leaveout the disagreeable accompaniment offlies and snakes and wood ticks and wiltedcollars In summer time you can thinkof the joys of winter and not cpme in contact with blue noses shivering blasts andfrosted feet So to write a story in zeroweather you should begin in the summerLet me explainWho thdt was 10 years old at the timedoes not remember the hurricane thatswept over the entire states of KentuckyIllinois Indiana and Ohio in 18G0vleavingdeath and destruction in its wake Thatwas a long time ago but we will take itor a starterJust as the storm any otner stormwould serve the same purpose was about tobreak in its fury upon a quiet rural community in Clermont county O two townchildren a boy and a girl aged respectively 10 and 7 were passing along thehighway near a farmhouse on the Glissonplace unmindful of the terrors of the approaching storm The good lady of thehouse sent one of her sons to warn themof their danger and to bring them intoshelterThe storm spent its fury and the darkness of night hung like a mantle over thedesolate soene of destruction As soon asit was safe to venture out a courier wasdispatched on horseback to notify the distressed parents at New Richmond that thechildren were safe He was met by asearching party from home seeking theprecious ones who were supposed to haveperished in the awful cycloneRight here the boy who is not the girlsbrother may be dropped out of the storyand the one gallus jay be introduced asthe hoy heroIn the meantime the bright little girlwas rapidly winning the hearts of thehouscLold in which she had found shelterby her sweet smiles bright sayings wonderful dancing and genial disposition coupled with a fairylike beauty of form andfaceThis girl was the petted daughter of anoted steamboat captain who died but afew years ago and who spent a monthsvacation in that country town during thatparticular summer KThe child remained until morning andwas entranced by the freedom of the country She went away never to return buther name was mentioned for years afterward in that household and she was longremembered as a bright ray of sunshine inthe midst of a terrible stormNone ever knew how sad was the heartof one boy on that farm when he realizedthat in a few short hours he had met andparted from one whose image would everremain in his heart And he wondered ifhe would ever again look upon the brightvisionTwenty one years later a stranger thatsame country boy was standing on thelevee at Cairo Ills when a New Orleansand Cincinnati packet rounded the bendbelow He was in conversation with ariver correspondent of a Cincinnati paperThats the Old South Captain Lewbound for Cincinnati He knew thewhistle At the sound of the name ofCaptain Lew the stranger started forsome of the dinip misty past struggled inhis brainYes it is the same Captain Lew Hisdaughter was married some years ago andher husband who ran as mate with Captain Lew was killed in an explosion oftheir boat a year ago on the MississippiShe is a widow now and went to New Orleans with her father this trip She maybe on the boat now Lets go aboard andI will introduce you to the captain Sosaid the correspondent after he had hearda brief sketch of the incidents of childhooddays The boat had tied up to the wharfby this timeNow dont you see how easy it is to writea storyNow go up into the cabin and see thehearty greeting of the grizzly old captainj who does not fail to remember the incidentoi tne supposea lost child and is profuse inhis thanks to the young man even at thislate day and winds up his cordial greetingwith Come back into the cabin andmeet Zulema She will be glad to seeyou for she has often spoken of the Incident She seems never to tire of recitingthe pleasures of that happy eveningBefore the words were hardly out of hismouth the captain opened a stateroomdoor and there stepped out into the blazing light a veritable vision ot lovelinessthe same childish face only saddened andbeautified not to say sanctified by sorrowThe young nmns heart seemed to cease itspulsations Was he only dreamingBut it took only a little while after introductions and explanations had beenmade to convince him that she too hadremembered the first meeting for she tookhis hand trustingly and held it while repeating the experiences of that stormynight 300 miles and 21 years awayThe bell rang goodby was said the matecussed the gangplanks were drawn inthe great wheels turned the boat glidedout in the flickering waves and was lost inthe darkness The woman was on theboat while the man stood on tbeeveewatohing the lights and listening -to thewheels upon the water until they dimmedand died away in the distance even ashope died out in his heartAnother 15 years have been ticked off bythe watch Thats about all of the web ofthe story But you can see how easy itwould be to make a story out of it by giving the imagination full play 1 maywrite it some day ExchangeContagion and InfectionLet me here try to correct what I believeto be a mistake and give rise to confusionThe terms contagion and infection are toooften used promiscuously though they areby no means synonymous The dissemination of mycotic diseases takes place in different ways There are those which cannot be communicated from person to person but spread only by the microbic causeinvading the individual To this class belong malarial fevers produced by spasmodia Malaria is not contagious justso in all probability cerebro spinal meningitis There are secondly those whichare not communicable from person to person but through external carriers onlysueh as soil water food air clothing andutensils Tothat class belong yellow feverand Asiatic cholera They are infectiousThere are finally those which may betransmitted directly from a person or indirectly through carriers To this classbelong scarlet fever measles diphtheriavariola influenza erysipelas and varicellaperhaps also
