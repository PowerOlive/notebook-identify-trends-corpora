When the spirit of Mrs. Mary To
bin, aged resident of Paris, left its
frail earthly tenement a few days
ago, there departed to the Better
Land all that was immortal of a good
woman, one whose life had been spent
in good works and in the care and
raising of a family to whom she had
given the best years of her long and
useful life."
Mis. Tobin was a native of Dublin,
'Ireland, and though transplanted at
nn early age to the New World, she
never forgot the old country and its
associations, friendships and trials as
well. She was married to John To
bin, who for many years successfully
conducted a florist and nursery busi
ness on the Winchester road, near
Paris, and to them was born four
children, -all residing in Paris and
Bourbon county.
She was a faithful member of the
Catholic church, not only' faithful to
that church, but just as faithful in
believing that it was her duty as a
Christian to do the will of her Master
at all times. She was always ready
to lend a helping hand in time of
need, both in acts of kindness ana
in words. Her retiring nature Art
her to hide her best qualities from
public gazi but they were revealed
to those who enjoyed her friendship,
yet it was in her home that her true
worth was manifested most. -She was
devoted to her children, who, in re
turn gave ser the kindest attention
and love. During her last illness she
was tenderly cared for her daugh
ters, Misses Mary and Rosa Tobin,
who ministered to her every want,
and never left her alone for a mo
ment, during the long days and
nights. No invalid ever received
kinder or more devoted attention
than these daughters gave their
mother.
The wealth of floral offering' at
the grave attested the high esteem
in which this good woman was held,
and the life that closed leftjbehind
as a benediction a wealth of remem
brances of good deeds done without
thought of reward or of approbation.
So jt is ever, when a life has been
worthily lived.

The revival meeting which has
been in progress at the Paris Chris
tian chuich for three weeks, con
ducted by Rev. Jesse R. Kellums and
Singing Evangelist Richards, closed
Wednesday night witn a total 01

closing meeting was attended by the
largest crowd of the series, hundreds
being unable to gain admission to
the auditorium. Rev. Kellums and
Mr. Richards opened a revival at
Georgetown last night. The meet

record for large attendance and the
intense interest manifested. Prob
ably no evangelist in years has so
captivated his audiences as did Rev.
Kellums, and his visit here will be
long remembered by Paris people.
The month of May has been one
of concerted effort and gratifying
results in the Presbyterian church.
At one of the recent services Mr.
Smylie gave a talk on what the
French call "esprit de corps," but

What constitutes " an undesirable

answers to the question, but here is
ouis. It is a person who maliciously
and continuously violates the laws of
the community in which, he lives, and
disturbs the peace and happiness of
his neighbois and the citizens of the
community; a person whose conduct
is demoralizing to his or her family
and the good citizenship of the com-
A person may be a law violator and
yet not by an undesirable citizen.
This is a free country, but this does
not permit or give a person license
to demoralize the whole community.
