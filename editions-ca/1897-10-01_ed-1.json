Rheumatism
the
Pain
The aches and pains of Rheumatism
become a constant companion to all who
are victims of this disabling disease
Much suffering could be avoided if the
first warning pains of Rheumatism were
heeded and the proper treatment at once
taken But the people generally are
not acquainted with the cause of the
disease though thousands know its tor
tures Those who use liniments and
ointments cannot understand why they
grow worse each winter and find them
selves graduallv becoming unable to get
around as they once could yet they
know that their trouble came on at first
as little aches and pains which hardly
attracted their attention
Everybody should know more about
rheumatism they should know that it
is a peculiar condition ofcthe blood upon
which all the liniments in the world
can have no effect whatever The
best blood remedy is needed one which
is able to go to the very seat of the
disease and force it out Swifts Specific
SSS is the right remedy for Rheu
matism because it is the only blood
remedy free from mercury potash and
other minerals which intensify the
ease causing stiffness of the joints and
aching of the bones
Swifts Specific being a real blood rem
edy never fails to cure Rheumatism It
reaches even the worst cases where the
doctors have made cripples with their
prescriptions of potash and mercury
Mr D R Johnson an extensive lum
ber dealer of Blackshear Ga writes
My wife1 was for years a sufferer from
Rheumatism and was treated constant
ly but could obtain no relief The pain
was first felt in her left shoulder and
extended in all directions increasing
in severity The doctors said the dis
ease was liable to strike the heart at any
time in which event death would be
inevitable
Every kind of treatment recommend
ed for Rheumatism was given her
including many blood remedies but
none did her any good She was grow
ing worse all the while and was reduced
to a mere shadow of her foimer self
It was at this critical period that
Swifts Specific was given her the med
icine seemed to reach the disease
promptly and she at once began to im
prove One dozen bottles effected a
complete cure and she has had no touch
of the disease since
Bvtry one afflicted with Rheumatism
should take a remedy which can reach
their trouble SSS will cure the most
aggravated case of Rheumatism Catarrh
Cancer Contagious Blood Poison Scrof
ula Eczema or any other blood disease
