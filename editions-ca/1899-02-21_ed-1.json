THE BOURBON NEWS ARIS KY TUESDAY FEBRUARY 21 1899
Gun Cotton
We had come into the storeroom for
torpedoes at the Brooklyn navy yard
and the talk turned to high explosives
We have to keep a sharp watch on
the gun cotton said one of the gun
ners who were with me to see that it
does not get dry and does not get too
acid There is never a day goes by on a
battleship but careful inspection is
made of the stores of ran cotton
in a piece or litmus paper and see if it
comes out blue If it does all is well
but beware if it comes out red That
means acid and acid means danger
What do you do when it comes out
red I asked
cotton deteriorates a lot in an acid solu
tion
Do you always keep the gun cotton
wet
Always Thats one of the first
principles When its wet it safe
when its dry it isnt Let it have aU
the water it will soak up which is
about 30 per cent
Suppose you were to touch off some
gun cotton here on the ground what
would happen
Nothing at all if it wasnt confined
You might burn a ton of it like cord
wood in a bonfire But pack it in a tin
box even a flimsy one and youll have
fun And of course the stronger the
box the more fun youll have Bos

l 11 dei K round Paris
The Paris of the pavement gay
bright and exhilarating is fairly fa
miliar to us all but underground Paris
dark solitary and damx extending for
miles is comparatively unknown A
part of this area is devoted to the cata
combs a valley of dry bones a garden
of the dead the rest a garden still more
vast provides for the wants or rather
the luxuries of the living it is devot
ed to mushroom culture These subter
ranean gardens extend for some 20
miles under the gay capital and are
from 20 feet to 160 feet beneath the
surface
It is very difficult to obtain permis
sion to visit them and even when per
mission is obtained it requires some
courage to avail oneself of it for the
only entrance is a circular opening like
the mouth of a well out of which a
long pole stands Through this pole
fastened at the top only at fairly long
intervals sticks are thrust This prim
itive ladder the base of which swings
like a pendulum in the impenetrable
darkness below is the only means of
reaching the caves Here again
cried our guide with a burst of cheer
fulness see this door On the other
side are the catacombs as full of bones
as this place is of mushrooms We
smiled We were not afraid of bones

SURPRISED HER HUSBAND
Why the Young -Wife Spent an After
noon In His Office
Young Mrs Smith who lives down
on Prairie avenue is very fond of her
husband and also very jealous of him
Mr Smith knows this and enjoys it im
mensely Before the Smiths were mar
ried he used to know a Minneanolis erirl
Dip who visited his sister in Chicago Mrs
Smith knew her very well too The Min
neapolis girl came down not long ago
and Mrs Smith called on her A few I
days before the Minneapolis girl went
back she called on Mrs Smith and
they had an eniovable nuarter of an

When the Minneapolis girl rose to
go she said sweetly Oh by the way
I want to see Charlie before 1 go back
and 1 think I may just drop into his
office this afternoon
Oh do Charlie will be Relighted
returned Mrs Smith The door had
hardly closed on the guest before Mrs
Smith executed a sort of war dance
She dressed as fast as she could put on
her bonnet and announced her intention
of going down to Mr Smiths office
Her grandmother remonstrated in vain
Mrs Smith is only 18 and she is jeal
ous
I thought Id spend the afternoon
with you she announced to the aston
ished Charlie as she swept into the
office
But my dear he began when
Mrs Smith ensconced herself at the
side of his desk and intimated that the
most violent arguments would not
move her She sat there all the after
noon The Minneapolis girl enjoyed
herself shopping and forgot to call in
to tell Charlie goodby Mrs Smith broke
down and confessed as soon as she got
home and her foolish young husband
told her to go down next day and buy
herself the prettiest hat she could find

JOHN HAYS BIG APRON
One of the Cases Where DisliYvash
iag PrttdBcwl a Poet
Colonel Hay was when a boy a regu
lar attendant of the Presbyterian Sun
day school at Warsaw Ills
The Sunday school lessons partly con
sisted of committing to memory Bible
verses and to attain supremacy in this
created qxiite a rivalry among the schol
ars John Hay was sure to come out
ahead from two to five answers some
times more causing those of his com
rades who were always behind him to
regard him with envy
Consequently when some of those boys
heard that John had to wash dishes and
do the churning for his mother and
more than all that he wore an apron
while at these duties his jealous com
rades fairly crowed
One morning it was agreed by his
comrades to get him out of doors while
he had his apron on and humiliate him
by having two or three girls whom he
rather liked ask him questions in re
gard to his housework
Young Hay came out to where the
boys were and answered the questions
by saying that he washed dishes as his
mother taught him and then with
twinkling eyes he gavs the dishpan
which he had with him a tremendous
fling contents and all drenching who
ever happened to be near enough and
laughing loudly ran into the kitchen
Hay and his big apron were never mo
lested after that Christian Endeavor

A Kissing Nation
In no other part of the world is kiss
ing so much in vogue ae in Rniieia
From time immemorial it has been ths
national salute Indeed it is more of a
greeting than a caress
In public affairs as in private the
kiss is an established custom Fathers
and sons kiss old generals with rusty
mustaches kiss whole regiments kiss
The emperor kisses his officers On a
reviewing day there are almost as many
kisses as shots exchanged If a lillipu
tian corps of cadets have earned the im
perial approval tbe imperial salute is
bestowed upon the head boy who passes
it on with a hearty report to his neigh
bor he in his turn to the next and so
on through the whole juvenile body

Heroes of the Pen
The intensity of application with
which the mind follows whatever it
lays hold of in literary pursuit is ex
emplified in the case of Robert Ains
worth a celebrated writer and anti
quarian of the seventeenth ceatury He
had been for years engaged in a volumi
nous Latin dictionary and while fas
cinated with this heroic work gave so
little time and attention to bis wife
that be incurred her bitterest jealousy
and oefore tbe work was quite complete
she committed the whole to the flames
Instead of abandoning himself to de
spair Aiusworth set to work and re
wrote it accomplishing the entire work

ment was endured with similar heroism
by Carlyle when the manuscript of his
Frederics the Great was destroyed
by fire
