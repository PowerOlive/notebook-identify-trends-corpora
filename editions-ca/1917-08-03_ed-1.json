MAGAZINES AND BOOK .WANTED
FOR S0LDIERS
A call is being made on the public
for books for the soldiers of the Unit
ed States. The American Library
Association has undertaken the or
ganization of war service libraries,
its members are contriouting to a
fund for that purpose, and the asso
ciation is working with the Y. M. C.
A. and Knights of Columbus, which
are engaged in plans for furnishing
recreation places for the soldiers.
War Service Library work prob
ably will be observed in October, but
the association is desirous of start
ing the work at once, and its appeal
to Kentucky reached Miss Fannie
Rawson, secretary of the Kentucky
State Library Commission.
Every library in the State is in
service for this -work, and people who
have books or magazines to contrib
ute may send them to the local li
librabry or to teh Kentucky library
Commission, Frankfort. In places
where there is no public library
women's clubs probably will collect
the books and send them here.
It is not the aim to send cast-off
books to the soldiers, but books that
will interest them fiction, travel;
history and technical works relating
to the branch of the service in which
they are engaged. Magazines less
than 2 years old also are acceptable.
The plea is made that people immedi
ately select the books they wish to
give and deliver them to the library
so that no time will be wasted and
that the confusion at the last minute
rush may be averted.
England has a well-organized war
library system and her people have
fsent hundreds of thousands of books
to the soldiers at the front, where
regular libraries are- operated.
Kentucky libraries, on the sugges
tion of the commission, already have
been doing publicity work by posting
bulletins on conservation and the va
rious subjects the Government desires
brought to public attention, and no
tices directing attention to the near
est recruiting stations and Red Cross
training classes.

DEATHS.
WHITE.
Mr. Lawrence White, of Mt. Ster
ling, who had been a resident of
Frankfort for several years, where he
had been Assistant State Treasurer of
Kentucky, died Monday at an Indian
apolis Hospital, where he had been
under treatment for several weeks.
He had been a sufferer for several
years. Mr. White was Assistant
State Inspector and Examiner under
Sherman Goodpastor during the four
years of Gov. McCreary's administra
tion, and went with Treasurer Good
pastor into office in 1916.
Mr. White was a brother of Mr.
Robin White, whose death by drown
ing in Bath county some weeks ago is
still fresh in the minds of the public,
and of former Commonwealth's At
torney Bridges White, of Mt. Ster
ling. He is survived besides his
brother, by his mother, Mrs. Bettie
White and his wife, Mrs. Mary Owens
White, of Mt. Sterling, the latter be
ing a niece of Mrs. Jesse Turney, of
Paris. Mr. White was a cousin of
Mrs. N. A. Moore, of Paris. Mrs. Tur
ney and Mrs. Moore attended the
funeral, which took place in Mach
pelah Cemetery, in Mt. Sterling, Wed
nesday afternoon, with services con
ducted by Revs. Yeaman and Darsie,
of Mt. Sterling.

EMERGENCY MUNITIONS.
Here is a paragraph, snipped out of
an article by George Creel in Every
body's for June, which shows the war
uses to which various peaecful manu
factories can be subjected:
"A manufacturing jeweler was sur
prised to learn that his plant, with a
few changes, could turn out peri
scopes; a sash-chin maker found that
his machines were adapted to the pro
duction of cartridge clips for rifles
and machine guns; a phonograph
concern was discovered to be well fit
ted for the manufacture of certain
delicate shell parts; makers of under
wear may be relied on for bandages;
a manufacturer of music rolls for
gages; a creamery separator plant for
shell-primers; a sewing machine com
pany for gaines; a recording and
computing machine plant for fuses;
an infants' food concern for shell
plugs; drug manufactories and dye
works for high explosives; finished
shells may be expected from candle
makers, flour-millers, tobacco manu
facturers, siphon-makers; silver
smiths can make cartridge-cases, bul
let jackets, and caps; while shrapnel
can be made in gas-engine works,
can-factories, electric-elevator works,
locomotive-works, stove - foundries
and machine-sh'ops."
