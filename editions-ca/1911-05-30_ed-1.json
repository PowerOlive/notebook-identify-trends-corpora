The spacious drill hall of the college,
w itli a seating capacity of seven hun
dred is by far the largest building in
town and was practically full. The
musical prorgam was very good,
especially the trio and choral work by
the cadets. Dr. Porter in his address
was at his best. He is not a stranger
in our community and is always a wel
come visitor. Most of our people know
what to expect before hearing him and
were not disappointed. On a whole it
was one of the best services ever con
ducted in the drill hall.
The fourteenth annual competitive
drill of the M. M. I. took place Mon
day morning at 9:30 on M. M. I.
grounds. The entire battallion met
the Paris Military Band at the 8:30
train and escorted them to the grounds
where the drill was witnessed by one
of the largest crowds ever seen on the
field. The exercises were equal to
those of former years and the contest
at the manual at arms as well as the
drill by companies was warmly con
tested. The medal in the manual at
arms was won by Cadet Harris, of
Frankfort. In 1910 Company B won
the flag over Company C. Yesterday
Company B was again awarded the
flag for another year. The judges
were ExCadet Alex Hawes, of
Chicago, Jesse Miller, Lexington and
Allen Ingles, Millersburg. Mure than
forty guests were in the house during

Ten 0ears
What will your new furniture look
like? That's a point to think about.
If you are a wise buyer and buy
wisely your furniture will be as good
as new in ten years.
If you think only of low prices, and
don't bother much about quality,
in ten years what you buy will be
completely worn out
You see the argument, don't you?
To come closer to the point This
store guarantees to save you money
on furniture, principally by selling
you the highest qualities in the land.
