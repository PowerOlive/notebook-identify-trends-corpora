Thousand Troops Had BeenMustered in Up to SundayWashington May 16 Thepatches from Hong Kong brought welcome news Sunday from Adm Deweyto the president and particularly tcSecretary Loner and the naval officialswho are watching the admirals move- jmentswith so much interest Whileno apprehension existed as to his security nevertheless reassurance oisafety is always pleasant The telegrams indicate that Dewey has lostnone of the prestige gained in hismemorable fight of two weeks agonnd hafc while he refrains fromtaking the city of Manila he asit practically at his mercy The admiral expresses the belief that the rebels ar hemming in the city by landbut the fact that he says explicitlythat -they have made no demonstrationseems to disprove thoroughly the published reports that they had alreadyentered Manila and had begun a careerof bloodshed and rapine The bestewdence of the effectiveness of thehlockade maintained by the Americanadmiral and also of the work of the insurgents in surrounding the city ishown in the statements in the dispatches that provisions are scarcein the city of Manila which seemsto indicate to Adm Dewey an earlysurrender by the Spanish authorities-Another published report seems alsoto be refuted by the admirals advicesand that is that the rebels had raidedCavite where the Spanish naval stationwas located and where presumablylarge supplies of arms and ammunitionwere kept If the rebels have beensupplying themselves with arms itmust have been with the admiralsconsent as his dispatch is originallydated from Cavite indicating that he isstill in possession The greatest satisfaction prevails here over the goodwork being done and the effectivenessof the blockade being maintainedThe officials are making all possiblehaste to rush troops to supplement- Adm Deweyrs forces so that if theSpanish governor does surrender theformer will not be dependent upon thesmall number of maiines which he canilly spare from his ships but will havethe assistance of soldiers in holdinghis position and maintaining orderIt is confidently hoped here that theCity of Peking chartered as a transport vessel will be able to clearfrom San Francisco in a veryshort time to be followed in rapidsuccession by the other three ships engaged for a similar purpose ThePeking can carry 1000 men whichwith the marines aboard the Charleston just about to sail will be of con-sierabe assistance to the admiralbut far from the number which he willneed The total number of men to besent will aggregate probably 12000as Maj Gen Wesley Merritt whois to command the

here that practically allthe volunteers will goSecretary Long was at the navy department several times during the dayand in addition to the dispatch fromthe admiral he authorized the publication of the statement that the torpedo boat Terror belonging to thjSpanish fleet was disabled at Port ofFrance Martinique The dispatch isas followsSpanish torpedo boat Terror disabled at Port of France MartiniqueThere was a disposition among someof those who saw this statement to regard it with suspicion suggesting thatthe report of disability was intendeddimply as a blind and that the Spanishgovernment had caused it to be spreadso that no eomplaint could be made toFrance on account of the stay of theboat at a neutral port None of theofficials however would express themselves on the subjectAt the state and war departmentsthe officials were on hand in many ofthe bureaus for the greater part of theday Secretary Day and AssistantSecretaries Adee and Cridler were attheir desks

intend toarmistice but simply hoisted a flag oftruce to -cover some treacherous military maneuverThat maneuver was the evacuationof BayamoThe Cubans answered the flags oftruce Avith a heavy artillery and riflefire The Spaniards retreated in twocolumns to a little town called Embarcadeo on the Cauto riverFor a distance of 200 yards on theSan Augustin road the Cubans planteddynamite torpedos that

theCommissioners ConventionQuestions Pertaining to tlie Conductof Railways Which Are otInterest to the GeneralPublicThe railway commissioners of thecountry met in convention at Washington DC on Tuesdaj May 10 for thepurpose of considering1 questions ofgreat interest both to the railways andthe people of the United States Theconvention was addressed by Hon ME Ingalls a high authority in railwaymatters upon the establishment ofproper traffics conduct of shippers andthe betterment of existing conditionsin railway affairs also the advancement of measures looking to the greater comfort and convenience of the public Mr Ingalls address is here givenas being a semi official expression ofthe views held by railway managersgenerally and as being also cf general interest to the public at largeMr Chairman and Gentlemen I amvery much obliged for this opportunity ofaddressing you I understand I have In myaudience the members of the interstatecommerce commission and the gentlemencomposing the various railway commissions of the different states It Is a bodythat is supposed to stand as an arbiter between the railroads and the people as afriend of both a body that ought to and-does have great influence and especiallyin reference to legislation regarding railroads If this audience should agree uponany legislation in that respect that wasneeded I presume there would be no difficulty in inducing yonder congress toenact it into law and believing as I dothat it is essential to the public interest tosecure legislation I am pleased to havethis opportunity of presenting my viewsand endeavoring to enlist you in the reforms which I think are so vital We havereached a crisis in railway managementwhere something must be done If we wouldavoid disaster not alone to the railwaysbut to the material interests ot our countryFor SO years a contest has been wagedin legislatures in congress and before thecourts by the people on one side who believed that railways were public corporations and subject to control by the powerthat created them and on the other handby oflicials of the railways who did notbelieve such control was legal or practicable State after state asserted its rightThese rights were contested from one courtto another and decided from time to timealways in favor of the people under certain restrictions It finally culminated in1887 in the enactment of the interstate commerce law and since then there has beenhardly a day when some provision of thatlaw was not under consideration by thecourts or by congress until now we maystate it is as fairly settled by the highest courts in the land that the legislaturesof the states have control over railwayswith reference to their local business subject to certain conditions and that thecongress of the United States has thepower to regulate interstate business Thesupreme court of the United States whichis the highest arbiter of these differences has just decided that such control ofthe states or regulation must be reasonable and that rates cannot be reduced helow a point where the railroads can earntheir expenses and a fair return upon theircostHallway managers had accepted the situation and were endeavoring to obey theInterstate commerce law and adapt theirmanagement to it when in March 1S97 a decision was rendered by the supreme courtwhich produced chaos and destroyed allagreements It was practically that theSherman anti trust law so called whichit had not been -supposed applied to railways did apply to them and under theconstruction of that law by the court itwas practically impossible to make anyagreements or arrangements for the maintenance of tariffs In the case broughtagainst the Joint Traffic association inNew York this view has been combattedby the railways and it may be modified bythe courts But since that decision InMarch 1SS7 there has been practically astate of anarchy so far as the maintenanceof tariffs is concerned in a large part of thiscountryIt Is well perhaps that we should lookthe situation fairly in the face- and while Ido not care to be an alarmist I feel boundto describe plainly to you the condition today so that you may understand the necessity for action Never in the history ofrailways have tariffs been so little respected as to day Private arrangementsand understandings arc more plentifulthan regular rates The larger shippersthe Irresponsible shippers are obtainingadvantages which must sooner or laterprove the ruin of the smaller and moreconservative traders and in the end willbreak up many of the commercial housesin this country and ruin the railways Amadness seems to have seized upon somerailway managers and a large portion ofthe freights of the country is being carriedat prices far below cost Other than themaintenance of tariffs the condition of therailways is good their physical conditionhas been improved their trains are wellmanaged and the public is well served Ifa way can be found by which tariffs canbe maintained and the practice of secretrebates and private contracts discontinuedthe future will have great promise for railway investors railway employes and thepublic generally And here I wish to saythat this is not a question which concernsrailway investors alone If it was youmight say let them fight It out It concerns Jver and above everyone else thegreat public One fifth of our people areinterested directly in railways either aemployes or employes of manufactoriesthat are engaged in furnishing supplies tothe railways Can any body politic prosperIf one fifth of its number Is engaged in abusiness that is losing money The railways serve the public in so many ways thattheir prosperity Is closely interwoven withthe prosperity and the comfoit of theordinary people One thousand millions ofdollars were paid out last year by the railways from their earnings to employes ofmanufactories in this country 511000000 ofpassengers were carried 13000 millionswere carried one mile 765000000 of tons offreight were moved 95000 millions of tonswere moved one mile Do you think thatany Interest performing such immenseservice as this can be in difficulty and thebalance of the country not feel it Fortymillions of dollars were paid out for public taxes Over three thousand millions ofdollars that have been invested In railwayshave earned no dividend for years ThisIs not water as some populist orator willsay but good honest money These securities are held all through the land andtheir failure to pay any return has broughtdisgrace upon us abroad and suffering andwant In many a family and community athome A slight improvement in the ratewhich would be scarcely felt would makethis investment good One mill per ton petmile or one tenth of a cent additional lastyear would have made 950C0 increase innet revenue and this would have paid threeper cent upon this invested capitalThese are the material sides of the question There is a much more dangerousview and that is the demoralization of themen conducting these immense enterprisesand the want of respect for the law whichis being developed by the present situationThe trouble is not due altogether to theprovisions and the interstate commercelaw It has grown up from various sourcesThe panic of 1893 and the loss of businessfor the next few years Intensified the competition between the Hnes new avenuoswere opened the competition of the Gulfports increased enormously also that ofthe Canadian Pacific on the north Altogether these causes produced such sharpcompetition coupled with th decision re-THE BOTTEBON NEW PARIS filfeUESDAY MAY 17 1898ferrred to of the courts that no understanding or agreements can be made andhave combined to produce the most complete breakdown that has ever been seenin any business There Is less faith to daybetween railway managers with referenceto their agreements to maintain tariffsthan was probably ever known on earth inany other business Men managing largecorporations who would trust their opponent with their pocketbook with untoldthousands in it will hardly trust his agreement for the maintenance of tariffs whilethey are in the room together Good faithseems to have departed from the railwayworld so far as traffic agreements are concernedOne of the chief difficulties with the lawas it stands to day is that the punishmentfor private contracts and rebates is entirely out of proportion to the offense Theimprisonment clause was put in as anamendment to the interstate commercelaw and I believe the commission andeveryone who has watched its workingswill agree with me that it has been a failure more than a failure that It has causedperhaps more demoralization than anything else The public has not believed init it has been impossible to secure conviction it has prevented the railway official who desired to be honest from complaining of his competitor whom he thoughtwas dishonest In fact it has been whatevery law is that is not supported by public sentiment a failure What in fact Isthe manner of conducting business to dayThe railway official who desires to be honest and law abiding sees traffic leave hisline and finds the freight that he was carrying hauled to the warehouse of his rivalthe earnings of his line decreasing andcomplaints from the management of loss ofearnings and in the distance he sees looming up the loss of his position At the sametime the shipper who desires to obey thelaw sees some rival selling merchandise tohis customers at prices he cannot meetand he knows very well that he is securingconcessions from some railway to enablehim to do this The railway agent and thjshipper who wish to obey the law sit downtogether and look it over What relief isthere for them They can complain oftheir rivals possibly convict them underthe interstate commerce law and sendthem to the penitentiary but such actionwould bring down upon them the condemnation of the public and would ruintheir business for as i stated before thepublic does not believe in this severe feature of the law and will not support anyone who enforces it The result is thesemen in despair are driven to do just whattheir opponents are doing they becomelawbreakers themselves I have drawn nofancy picture it is what is occurring everyday around you Boards of trade commercial bodies and conventions have repeatedly reported on it and all have cometo the same conclusion and yet for someinexplicable reason congress has failed toactThere are two changes that should bemade in this present legislation whichwould aid in creating a better condition ofaffairs than exists to day First the tenthsection or imprisonment clause should bestricken out and a new law should be enacted imposing a fine of say 5000 uponthe offending corporation make each andevery contract or bill of lading a separateoffense Leave out the shipper altogetheryou want his testimony If he cheats byunderbuying or false invoices he should bepunished but his attempt to secure a lowerrate than his rival should not be indictableas you then prevent getting testimonywhich you need With this amendment putinto law every railway official will be interested in prosecuting his rival for anyviolation of the lawTo day you cannot get any help thatway because no one Is going to try to sendhis competitor to prison Public sentiment would not support it and over it allis the fear that he himself may have committed transgressions which in turn willbe discovered and prosecuted and punishment inflicted upon himself But if it was acase of fine against the corporation therewould be no hesitation in these corporations using the entircpower which theyhave to convict wrongdoing You maythink that some would pay these fines andgo on but I assure you that a few finesof 5000 would work wonders in reformingrailway corporations in their managementAbove all you wil have public opinion behind you and it will be easy to enforce thislaw You can get all the testimony youwant no one can refuse to produce hisbooks You will at least give those railwayofficials and those shippers who sincerelydesire to be law abiding citizens a fairchance to defend themselveaSecond the law should be amended sothat railway corporations can contractwith each ether for the maintenance ofrates or the division of business and incase of failure of either party to keep hiscontract allow the other to sue in thecourts and recover damages This in partis what is called pooling but it is more thanthis It legalizes contracts between railway corporations It may be a contractfor maintenance of rates with no divisionof business To day if two railway corporations contract that they will maintainthe same rate between Baltimore and NewYork it is a conspiracy contrary to publicpolicy and cannot be enforced in thecourts This Is an old law which is notadapted to modern business methods Itgrew up to protect the public in eld timesbut it Is no longer necessary and should bechanged to legislation The right to poolas you all know provides that two or morerailway corporations can agree to dividethe business between competing points oncertain proportions and the line thtt carries more than its share shall pay a certainsum as damages for its failure to keepits contract The objection to allowing thisbias been that excessive rates might becharged To protect the public in this matter enact into law that upon the complaintof any citizen such rates shall be subject toreview by the interstate commerce commission and in case they shall find that theyare excessive they shall at once be reduced to the basis fixed by the interstatecommerce commission or else the agreement shall be endedAll of us who have any interest in ourcountry who desire Its prosperity are interested in the solution of this great question It is not a time for the demagogue tohowl about corporations It is not a timeto talk about the wrongdoings of railwaymanagers There are always some in anybusiness who will not do right and therealways will be but the great mass of railway managers to day I assure you areas honestly seeking a solution of this question as are you oi any member of the legislative body I believe I voice the belief ofa very large majority of them that the twoprovisions I have mentioned are necessaryand will lead to the settlement of this question If this body will join and heartily Indorse this course and work for it its accomplishment can be attained We haveunwittingly in this country applied to railway laws that it was never Intended shouldbe applied to transportation companies ofthis nature We have gone back and takendecisions chat were wise a hundred yearsago when civilization was in its infancyand when the masses needed certain protection-and have endeavored to apply thesesame principles to the great transportationInterests of modern times The courts unfortunately have followed in that lineI beg of you gentlemen to take thesethings to heart If the thoughts that I havesuggested are wise and commend themselves to your judgment then put them insuch form as Is proper and present them tocongress with your recommendations andI have not much doubt but that they wil bemade into law Some people will opposethem through selfish Interest or for political reasons there will be some railwaymanagers who fear the loss of their present power and who can see great troublein the future who win appose tnembut why in reference to such anenormous Interest as this wait foreveryone to agree Take the greatmass of thinking men what youyourselves approve and

perhaps a foot long Then at-one end of the desk he laid two curious-little objects that looked like metaltpollywogs They bore between them abright brass cylinder perhaps half aninch long A line wire was attached tothem its end disappearing in the valise-on the floorBeady cried the lean man 4GoHe raised his hand from the comicalipollywogs and they began wrigglingacross the top of the desk toward

longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for tho seaand none of our first plans not evenDr Liveseys of keeping me beside himcould be carried out as we intendedThe doctor had to go to London fora physician to take charge of his practice the squire was hard at work atBristol and I liyed on at the Hall under the charge of old Bedruth thegamekeeper almost a prisoner but fullof sea dreams and the most charminganticipations of strange islands and adventures I brooded by the hour together over the map all the details ofwhich I well remembered Sitting bythe fire in the housekeepers room II approached that island in my fancyfrom every possible direction I explored every acre of its surface 1climbed a thousand times to that tallhill they call the Spy glass and fromthe top enjoyed the most wonderfuland changing- prospects Sometimesthe isle was thick with savages withwhom we fought sometimes full ofdangerous animals that hunted us butin all my fancies nothing occurred tome so strange and tragic as our actualadventuresSo the weeks passed on till one fineday there came a letter addressed to DrLivesey with this addition To beopened in the case of his absence byTom Bedruth or young HawkinsObeying this order we found or ratherI found for the gamekeeper was apoor hand at reading anything- butprint the following important newsOld Anchor Inn Bristol March 1 17Dear Livesey As I do not know whether you are at the Hall or still in London Isend this in double to both placesThe ship is bought and fitted She liesat anchor ready for sea You never imagined a sweeter schooner a child mightsail her two hundred tons name HispaniolaI got her through my old friend Blandly vho has proved himself throughout themost surprising trump The admirablefellow literally slaved in my interest andso I may say did every one In Bristol assoon as they got wind of the port we sailedfor treasure I meanBedruth said I interrupting theletter Dr Livesey will not like thatThe squire has been talking after allWell whos got a better rightgrowled the gamekeeper A prettyrum go if squire aint to talk for DrLivesey I should thinkAt that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight onBlandly himself found the Hispaniolaand by the most admirable managementgot her for the merest trifle There is aclass of men in Bristol monstrously prejudiced against Blandly They go the lengthof declaring that this honest creaturewould do anything for money that theHispaniola belonged to him and that hesold it me absurdly high the most transparent calumnies None of them darehowever to deny the merits of the shipSo far there was not a hitch The workpeople to oe sure riggers and what notwere mot annoyingiy slow but time curedthat It was the crew that troubled meI wished a round score of men in caseof natives buccaneers or the odiousFrench and I had the worry of the deuceitself to find so much as half a dozen tillthe most remarkable stroke of fortunebrought me the very man that I requiredI was standing on the dock when bythe merest accident I fell In talk with himfound he was an old sailor kept a publichouse knew all thewseafarlng men in Brlstol had lost his health aslN3erijid wanted a good berth afctodkgertrovsa againHe had hobbled down there th t morninghe said to get a rnoil3S thI was monstrously totftucuso wouldyou have been and out of pure pity I engaged him on the spot to be ships cookLong John Silver he is called and has losta leg but that I regarded as a recommendation since he lost it in his countrys service under the immortal Hawke He has nopension Livesey Imagine the abominable age we live inWell sir I thought I had only found acook but it was a crew I had discoveredBetween Silver and myself we got together In a few days a company of thetoughest old salts imaginable not prettyto look at but follows by their faces of themost Indomitable spirit I declare we couldfight a frigateLong John oven got rid of two out of thesix or seven I had already engaged Heshowed me In a moment that they wereJust the sort of fresh water swabs we hadto fear in an adventure of importanceI am in the most magnificent health andspirits eating like a bull sleeping like atree yet I shall not enjoy a moment till Ihear my old tarpaulins tramping round thecapstan Seaward ho Hang the treasureIts the glory of the sea that has turnedmy head So now Livesey come post donot lose an hour if you respect meLet young Hawkins go at once to seehis mother with Redruth for a guard andthen both come full speed to BristolJOHN TRELAWNEYP S I did not tell you that Blandlywho by the way is to send a consort afterus if wo dont turn up by the end of August had found an admirable fellow forsailing master a stiff man which I regretbut In all other respects a treasure LongJohn Silver unearthed a very competentman for a mate a man namd Arrow Ihave a boatswain who pipes Livesey sothings shall pro nmio war fashion onboard the good ship Hispaniola-I forgot to tell you that Silver a manof substance I know of myoTii knowledgeftTHE BOUftBON NEWS PABIS KT TUESDAY MAY 17 1898that he has a bankers account which hasnever been overdrawn He leaves his wifeto manage the inn and as she is a womanof color a pair of old bachelors like you andI may be excused for guessing- that it is thewife quite -as much as -the health thatsends him back to roving J TP P S Hawkins may stay one nightwith his mother J TYou can fancy the excitement intowhich that letter put me I was halfbeside myself with glee and if ever Idespised a man it was old Tom Bedruth who could do nothing but grumbleand lament xVny of the under gamekeepers would gladly have changedplaces with him but such was not thesquires pleasure and the squires pleasure was like law among them all Nofoody but old Bedruth would have daredso much as even to grumbleThe next morning he and I set outon foot for the Admiral Benbow andthere I found my mother in goodhealth and spirits The captain whohad so long been a cause of so muchdiscomfort was gone- where the wickedcease from troubling The squire hadhad everything repaired and the public rooms and the sign repainted andhad added some furniture above all abeautiful armchair for mother in thebar He had found her a boy as an apprentice also so that she should notwant help while I was goneIt was on seeing that boy that I understood for the first time my situation I had thought up to that momentof the adventures before me not at allof the home that I was leaving- andnow at sight of this clumsy strangerwho was to stay here in my place besidemy mother I had my first attack oftears I am afraid I led that boy adogs life for he was new to the workI had a hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him downand I was not slow to profit by themThe night passed and the next dayafter dinner Bedruth and I were afootagain and on the road I said good byto mother and the cove where I had livedsince I was born and the dear old Admiral Benbow since he was repaintedno longer quite so dear One of nry lastthoughts was of the captain who hadso often strode along the beach with hiscocked hat bis saber cut cheek and hisold brass telescope Next moment wehad turned the corner and nry homewas out of sightThe mail picked us up about duskat the Boyal George on the heath Iwas wedged in between Bedruth anda stout old gentleman and in spite ofthe swift motion and the cold night airI must have dozed great deal fromthe very first and hen slept like alog- uphill and down lale through stag eafter stag e for whei I was awakenedat last it was by a punch in the ribsand I opened my ey to find that wewere standing still before a large building-in a city street and that the dayhad already broken a long- timeWhere are we I askedBristol said Tom Get downMr Trelawnej had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks tosuperintend the work upon the schooner Thither we had now to walk andViour way to my great delight lay alongthe quays and beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs andnations In one sailors were singingat their work in another there weremen aloft high over my head hangingto threads that seemed no thicker thana spiders Though I had lived by theshore all my life I seemed never tohave been near the sea till then Thesmell of tar and salt was somethingnew I saw the most wonderful figureheads that had all been far over theocean I saw besides many old sailorswith rings in their ears and whiskerscurled in ringlets and tarry pig tailsand their swaggering clumsy sea walkand if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could not have been more delightedAnd I was going to sea myself tosea in a schooner with a piping boatswain and pig tailed singing- seamento sea bound for an unknown islandand to seek for buried treasureWhile I was still in this delightfuldream we came suddenly in front ofa large inn and met Squire Trelawneyall dressed out like a sea officer instout blue cloth coming out of the doorwith a smile on his face and a capitalimitation of a sailors walkHere you arc he cried and thedoctor came last night from LondonBravo the ships company completeOh sir cried I when do we sailSail says he We sail to morrowCHAPTEB VILTAT THE SIGN OF THE SPYGLASSWhen I had done breakfasting thesquire gave me a note addressed to JohnSilver at the sign of the Spyglass andtold me I should easily find the placeby following the line of the docks andkeeping a bright outlook for a littletavern with a large brass telescope fora sign I set off overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the shipsand seamen and picked my way amonjra great crowd of people and carts andbales for the dock was now at its busiest until I found the tavern in questionIt was a bright enough little place ofentertainment The sign was newlypainted the windows had neat reelcurtains the floor was cleanly sandedthere was a street on either side andan open door on both which made thelarge low room pretty clear to see inin spite of clouds of tobacco smokeThe customers were mostly seafaring men and they talked so loudlythat I hung at the door almost afraidto enterAs I was waiting a man came out ofof a side room and at a glance I wassure he must be Long John His leftleg was cut off closeby the hip and under the left shoulder he carried aCrutch which hf Tnnnnrrprl irHi- V X -Illdcrful dexterity hopping about upon itlike a bird He was verv tall nnristrong with a face as big as a hamplain and pale but intelligent and smilAuueeu ne seemed in the mosticheerful spirits whistlinsr as he mnvprVword or a slap on the shoulder for themost favored of his guestsNow to tell you the truth from thevery first mention of Long John inSquire Trelawneys letter I had takena fear in my mind that he might proveto be the very one legged sailor whomI had watched for so long at the oldBenbow But one look at the man before me was enough I had seen thecaptain and Black Dog and the blindman Pew and I thought I knew what abuccaneer was like a very differentcreature according to me from thisclean and pleasant tempered landlordI plucked up courage at once crossedthe threshold and walked right up tothe man where he stood propped onhis crutch talking to a customerMr Silver sir I asked holding outthe noteYes my lad said he such is myname to be sure And who may yoube And when he saw the squiresletter he seemed to me to give something almost like a startOh said he quite aloud and offering-his hand I see You are our newcabin boy pleased I am to see youxnd he took my hand in his largefirm graspJust then one of the customers at thefar side rose suddenly and made for thedoor It was close by him and he wasout in the street in a moment But hishurry had attracted my notice and Irecognized him at a glance It was thetallow faced man wanting two fingerswho had come first to the Admiral BenbowOh I cried stop him its BlackDogI dont care two coppers who he iscried Silver But he hasnt paid hisscore Harry run and catch himOne of the others who was nearest thedoor leaped up and started in pursuitIf he were Admiral Hawke he shallpay his score cried Silver and thenrelinquishing- my hand who did yousay he was he asked Black whatDog sir said I Has Mr Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers Hewas one of themSo cried Silver In my houseBen run and help Harry One of thoseswabs was he Was that you drinkingwith him Morgan Step up hereThe man whom he called Morgan anold gray haired mahogany faced sailorcame forward pretty sheepishly rolling his quidNow Morgan said Long John verysternly 3rou never clapped your eyesOhm cried stop him its BlacfcDojon that Black Black Dog before didyou nowNot I sir said Morgan with asaluteYou didnt know his name did youNo sirBy the powers Tom Morgan its asgood for you exclaimed the landlordIf you had been mixed up with thelike of that you would never have putanother foot in my house you may layto that And what was he saying toyouI dont rightly know sir

place for alubber TomAnd then as Morgan rolled back tohis seat Silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering as I thoughtHes quite an honest man Tom Morgan only stupid And now he ran onagain aloud lets sec Black DogNo I dont know the name not I Yet Ikind of think Fve yes Ive seen theswab He used to come here with ablind beggar he usedThat he did you may be sure saidI I knew

of robust manhood it is interesting to notice the lively childlike simplicity ofmanners the love of showy brilliantcolors worn by both sexes and to compare these charming characteristicswith the sober halbiliments and reserved manners of the present dayHere is an example of the man of fashion the beau ideal of the metropolisas he sallies forth into the city to paradehimself in the favorite mart of
