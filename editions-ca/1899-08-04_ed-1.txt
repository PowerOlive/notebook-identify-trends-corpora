MAKINGSINSall the arguments presented at the firstwere gone over with increased vehemence and forceThe Friendlies were denounced forforsaking the way of their forefathersand warned that if they persisted intheir conduct they wouldbe cast out from their fellows compelled to abandon their homes leavtheir cornfields and establish themselves afresh in some far away countrylike Mexico The Friendlies feelingthat the United States governmentwould support them in the positionwhich they had taken refused to recede and the result was open hostilitieswere immediately declared Thewere driven from theirhomes and bands of Hostiles beganto take possession c their cornfieldspeach orchards and gardens Thiscould not be tolerated for a moment sothe United States Indian agent at oncenet off from Fort Defiance to see whatcould be done to harmonize the opposing factions Next morning the council was held The chief of the Friendlies as and the chief ofthe Hostiles Lo-ma-hung-yo-ma Thetown plaza

Hebema the chiefmedicine man to speak for him Misspeech was full of fire and energy Herecounted their supposed origin and invivid words pictured what thoseabove had done for them during themany snows1 which had past Thenturning to the Friend lies he passionately exclaimed You have left theOraibi way Yon are no longer OraibisSo you have no right to anything thatbelongs to them You must go away orawfui disaster will come upon you andupon usWhen replied he showedthe folly of Hebema argument thatthose above would punish with disaster those who followed the Oraibi wayDisaster would come only upon thosewho had forsaken the way of their forefathers and walked in a new way andthat for him and his friends he was notafraid of what the gods could do Whenthese words of blasphemy were ttttt redHebema shouted out with force and vehemence You are no longer ourbrethren You must go away Unlessyou do we will fall upon you and thrustyou from your houses and bar the trailsagainst your returnSeeing that nothing could be doneand yet desirous of avoiding furthertrouble the agent arretted three of theleading Hostiles and after warningthe people that they must obey the orders of Washington he went away hoping that time would heal the breachThere were sullen mutt erings when theagent took away his three prisonersbut no outward manifestations In afew weeks they were released with thehope that they had learned the folly ofresistance and would counsel no morsoppositionHOUSE WHERE KUCHIWENTIWA HID HIMSELF AT ORAIBIandrthose who did were immediatelyBut this hope was in vain Xo soonerdid the Hostile ehlejs rjeuxa than ajraid was made upon the cornfields ofthe Friendlies and everything ofvalue taken away and the growingcrops destroyedThe war was now on At the head oftwo troops of cavalry and with a hotchkiss gun the agent hurried to OraibiIt was a terrible climb to reach the summit of the precipitous cliff upon whichOraibi is built with the gun but whenit was accomplished the agent calledout one by one the names of 19 of theringleaders of the Hostile partyplaced them tinderarrest and marchedaway with themOne man that was wanted was not tobe found Spies were set to watch forhim and when it was found that he washidden in the lower story of the househere pictured several soldiers were sentto arrest him When the soldiersreached the dark and hidden chamberwhere was hidden heyelled with fear and alarm and beggedthem not to kill him With rude laughter and taunts the soldiers seized himand this so enraged the Indians oldmother that she picked up a bundle ofarrows and fireelv struck at one of thesoldiers with them Fortunately noparticular harm was doneNext day the prisoners were marchedoff to Fort Defiance ami trom thencewere taken on the Santa Fe railway tothe island fortress of Alcatraz in thebay of San Francisco where they werekept as prisoners for a number ofmonths As the train rolled alongwas so scared at thenovel sensation that he sprang out ofthe window carrying the sash withhim This was in the middle of theArizona desert The train was stoppedbacked up and the poor wretch wasfound by the side of the track bruisedbleeding and senselessWhen the government thought theseHostiles punished sufficiently theywere returned to their home where Ifound them on my last visit They arestill anirry and sullen They still refuseto send their children to school Theirenmity against the Friendries is onlyheld in abeyance through fear of thepower of the United States governmentBut their hatred of those who have forsaken the ways of their forefathers isjust as bitter as ever it was ami theird termination to drive them out fromtheir ancient village just as settled asever To all outward appearances thereis a calm but who knows when

to either McPherson ormurita Gracia but we gave him 30he doubloons as an evidence of thegress we were making andssed various plans for the future withth on the way back to GuajanWe were all very anxious that thedre or rather his eminence theishop should have no opportunitycome aboard at Apra So as thewo passengers had but little luggagewas arrangeo inai we snouia Deropped in the proa somewhere offocos island the steamer then headig for Manila Without further loss oftime This arrangement was carriedour and the people at Agana had nosuspicion of the Countess visit untilafter we landed The Pouynipetiteshaving been occupied with their ownaffairs were not positive as to justwhen jr how I had come aboard so theimpression got about that havingeo bl vn out to sea 1 had beenked up a long distance from landjuveyed to a safer neighborhoodbecause the two strangersvg that wayaiInquiring for Sebastiano that even fing the gobernador fi old me he was suffering from a severe attack of gastric fever which seemed likely tokeep nini in bed for some time so 1paid him a visit of condolence it wasthe least I could do Then I took advantage of his indisposition to get thetreasure above water while safe frominterruptionFirst I spent a couple of nights inremoving the silver already securedfrom Tarofofo and stowing it away inthe copra bags at Apra Then I maderegular trips every second day to thereef returning with a long reach tothe north northwest which broughtme into Apra bay about midnight andworking at the stowage until after Ithree This with staying under waterat the wreck was pretty exhaustingwork and but for the rest on the odddays 1 couldnt have kept it up Tolave slept all day at the gobernadorshouse would have aroused comment jvery shortly so I spent the time uponthe water with Dorotea napping in thebottom of the proa while She fishedand kept watch as soon as we werewell away from landSebastianos illness was the thickeststreak of all mv luck 1 was becinninto feel careless because of our interrupted good fortune when returningfrom the last trip but one a shadowyproa followed me into the bay I heMoff toward the Agat road until I wofigures landed from her and walkedinto the copra shed then 1 steered outto sea as fast a Hie wind would takeme Before rounding Punta Orote I 1thought nf and discarded a dozen different plans I had taken great painsto stow the treasure in the very centerof the bags so there was nothing butinnocent copra for a thickness of several rows around and above it and 1 jknew if the strangers examined eachbag as they went along they would jscarcely reach the stuff before morning It then occurred to me that Brer jMiguels ghost wasnt earning its saltas guardian of the empty fissure at jTarofofo and might be employed toadvantage nearer home so 1 sailedaround after him as fast as possibleI had reached Apra a little early thatnight so had time to return beforedaybreak and running ashore nearthe watering place about three-quartersof a mile from the shed I hurriedtoward it holding mjr apparition before meThe intruders had evidently investigated until they were tired out andwere sound asleep on top of the pileof bags This was just the opportunityI wanted Propping the figure up under the roof about ten feet from themI crawled out of sight on the oppositeside and turned the ray from my lantern upon it Then 1 dropped a pieceSHE FISHED AND KEPT WATCHof copra upon the stomach of the mannearest me He was sleeping so soundly that I had to try a heavier piecewhich startled him with a grunt of surprise and pain In about three seconds his eye fell upon that faintly illuminated wax figure and with a howlof terror that made my own nervesjump he ran for his boat as if he weretrying to break a record His companion wasnt more than five secondsafter him and the two fought like madmen in their attempt to shove off andget away To make the effect permanent I grabbed my dummy andholding the lantern so that its rayswould be reflected back upon it glidedswiftly after them The horror of thething had reduced their cries to inarticulate gasps and they worked likedemons to get out where the windwould fill their sail so as it was lowtide I waded after them holdingBrer Miguel high enough to givehim tne appearance of walking uponthe waterWhen I flrwy xded back to shoreit was getting gray feenhlfi Tiniquio stI lost no time in stowing myfrievd uuder several layers of copra bags wlierche was likely to be undisturbed butwhere I could get him in short order ifhis services should be required againThen hurrying back to my proa Idumped the cargo of specie overboardin four feet of water where it couldeasily be found whenever there shouldbe an opportunity for secreting itThis affair so thoroughly awakenedme to the danger of delay that I removed all the remaining treasure fromthe wreck in one big load next tripStanding for the last time in the lazaretto of Nuestra Senora de Sevillafour fathoms under the Pacific I felta though I were sa3ing good by to anold friend for I shall probably neversee her again There was somethingwonderful in the way she had guardedthose millions for me all the yearssince the- first disappeared under water and I speculated a little as towhether strict honesty wouldnt require my searching for heirs of theoriginal owners This didnt troubleThe risks Halme verj long howeverstead and I had undergone and theway we had worked the problem out toa successful result seemed to give usa better claim upon the money thananjone else even our fat and scheming friend SebastianoSo the days slipped along throughApril into May while I rested andlearned what it was to have a beautifulwomans personality creep into thedeepest corners of my heart Thenone morning there came a cloud whichthreatened disaster to all our hopesand but for Dorotes position andiready wit this narrative would bemerely one of fruitless adventure Atchoouer came sailing into Apra oneof the island schooners which trade incocoanuts and otherproducts in search of water poultryand any cargo there might happen tobe in the place Noticing the bags ofcopra under the shed her captain offered the harbor master a higher ratethan tha which obtained at Manilaand was told that as the gobernadorwould undoubtedly be glad to sell atsuch a jrrice he might send ashore forit whenever he pleased We were justcoming in from a sail and saw theschooners men loading some of thebags into a jolly boat as we skirtedalong outside of Apapa island Mylace must have been absolutely colorless for Dorotea laid her hand uponmy arm and exclaimedMadre de Dios querido what is itque tiene VNo tengo nada but look They aretaking away the copra in that schooner The treasure It is packed awayin the bags I never dreamed theywould be disturbed until Ilalsteadcame for them Oh good Lord howon earth an I stop them without giving the whole thing awaySteer inside Apapa and land at thepier 1 will stop it very quicklyRut how What can you say thatwill not arouse suspicion that there issomething more valuable in the bagsI cannot tell until I ask of the harbor master why he does permit itthen I will think of something Doese Capitan Ilalstead knowOf course he does and expects totake them next tripThen he would surely ive morethan other men for themYes yes So will I Only keep themwhere they are until he comes I haveit Say that I spoke to you of a newchemical discovery which Halsteadtold me about one which increasesthe value of copra and which madehim think of buying this lot oniationieals-wayfhe treasure will need

contented with their lot to saythat farmers have teams and theirwives and families can go to town whenthey like and attend churches sociables lectures farmers clubs grangeshistory clubs and Chautauqua circlesfor study and entertainment This isall true to some extent and is excellentexcept during the two to four monthsof fall winter and spring when a largepart of the farmers living remote fromany village are practically mudbound There is something romanticbeautiful and poetic in being snowbound in the way describ d by our beloved poet Whittier in his delightfulfVji - z i aAN UNPAVED CITY STREETpoem but there is neither beauty poetry nor romance in being mud boundThe first step in civilization is the stepup and out of sie mud We know Htown that ha furnished its full shareof inspiring agricultural literature forpress and platform in which some ofthe families and neighbors even oltkose who furnish such literature arepractically mud bound a part of theyear cut off from church lectures social life by very deep and very unpoetic mudAt a certain farmers club recentlyone member by previously assignmentdiscussed the influence of electricroads upon the value of the farm and itsproducts After speaking of their influence on the cash values he said in substance But there are other valuesthan the cash ones The farms bestproducts are its human ones and whatever makes these human products morehappy intelligent and useful enhancesthe value of the farm and its products inthe highest and best of all ways Evening lectures and entertainments Yesbut they close at ten or later and threemiles of mud roads and cleaning the jhorses afterwards take all the fun outof it Church Why I actually losemore religion going and coming than 1get while Im there The only time mywife is discontented with farm life iswhen were mud bound lf we had anelectric road past us farm life would beideal Another member thought really good gravel or stone pikes wouldsolve the difficulty even betterWe know a town from which severalhundred gallons of milk are shipped tothe city daily the year round Some ofthe milk is hauled three miles or moreto the station rain or shine mud ordust and as much more goes to cheesefactories There are beds of fairly goodgravel in three parts of the township oriust across the line It is sandstonequartz and granitic gravel with very little shale It is not so good or durableas limestone gravel but is better faythan clay In the township there arethousands of tons of nigger headsthat is granitic bowlders brought byglacial action from the size of your fistup to the size of a large hay cock Theyeither obstruct farm work badly orhave been gathered into huge piles infence corners and elsewhere wherethey are useless and a nuisance A goodsteam power crusher would make thevery best road metal of them Eightfeet wide and eight inches deep of suchbroken granite on a properly gradedroadbed and covered with four inchesof gravel well rounded up and withproper drainage would make solidroads the year round and the roadswould last for many years providedvery heavy loads were forbidden onthem in wet times Such roads wouldactually cost the farmers less if thehauling of material were done by themselves than it now costs them to wallow through the mud daily withtheir milk to station and to factoryseveral months each year year afteryear as they now do And what an uplift to the intellectual and social lifeof the whole community There arehundreds of such towns in Ohio andneighboring states outside of the partsunderlaid with limestone and in whichlimestone gravel abounds and in whichthe mud roads are already supersededby hundreds of miles of splendid stoneand gravel pikes in each county Insuch regions the worst features of theisolation of

place take good care oithe cow while she is carrying the calfand also when it comes If we intendto feed the calf from the pail we do notallow the cow to lick it but take it to awarm well bedded box stall and rub itoff and leave it for three or four hoursto get hungry We then take somemilk from the cow but do not milk herout thoroughlv for 48 hours at least after calving as this is a great safeguardsigainst garget and give it to the calfWe feed it about two quarts at first andgradually increase the quantity as it requires it The calf should be fed threetimes a day the first week but careshould be taken not to overfeed asscours when once started are very hardto stop When the calf is two weeksold says Farmers Advocate add a little warm milk to the mothers milki and increase it so that at four weeks oldit is taking skim milk entirely To theiskiin milk add a little meal corn mealmiddlings ground oil cake in the ordernamed in proportion to four four andtwo It is not good to mix too mucucoarse meal such as oat chop in milkput a tablespoonful or two in at firstand increase the quantity as the calfseems to relish it When the calf isabout three weeks old pat some oatchop in a manger where it can get it avery little at first and as it licks it upclean keep giving more also let themhave access to salt and fine well savedclover hay and pulped roots Do notallow the feed to become stale beforethem but keep the manger clean andput in fresh feed each time There isnothing that helps them to eat betterthan teaching them to leave a cleanplate Be careful to feed regularlyboth as regards time and quantityContinue along these lines changingthe food at times to increase the appetite and in summer when the flies arebad let them have a moderately darkwell ventilated place to stay in throughthe day and a good pasture to feed in atnight When they are weaned frommilk in the fall a run on rape for amonth or two puts their stomachs infine shape to take hold of the coarserfodder in winter quarters Calves fedin this way will generally grow welland have a good amount of flesh whichshould be increased until they arefinished A great deal depends uponthe attendant whether he likes the calfand the workSoCOST OF POOR ROADSOfficial Figures Which SpeakLoader Than Yards of HighFlown ArgumentsFrance to day is literally alive withuutomobiles due to the fact that shehas such fine roads everywhere and oneof the reasons why automobiles inAmerica still cling to the large cities isthe poor state of the roads in the ruraldistricts Hence the drivers of automobiles are joining- the bicyclists in thefight for road improvement and it ispointed out that the farmer ought tomake common cause with them Thevigures cited are certainly very striking As the result of an inquiry madehi 1815 by the United States departmentof agriculture replies were receivedfrom over 1200 counties giving the costof hauling crops in various parts of theUnited Stattt The average load hauledwas found to I 2002 pounds the average length of iaul 12 1 10 miles theaverage cost of hauling a ton of cropsto market was 302 while the averagecost of hauling a ton for a distance ofone mile was 25 cents In order to compare the roads of the United Stateswith those of Europe the bureauthrough its consuls made careful inquiry on the subject of cost of haulingin England France Belgium Italy andSwitzerland The average cost of hauling one ton one mile was found to be inEngland 10 cents in France 10 centsin Germany 82 cents Belgium 9y3cents in Italy 72c and in Switzerland from 6 to 8 cents

light The lines oftheir profiles were so delicately fine thatmany turned to look at themLast night Mabel was saying 1dreamed of muddy water I kept dreamins of t al night long It came on andon rolling up to my very feet The waveswere biafraidturbulent threatening 1 wasA sin of trouble murmured Florence that is unless it cleared Did itdearrBabel frowned She closed her fan andtapped it impatiently against the palm ofher other handNo it didnt she answered Butwhat difference did that makeWhen did you hear from ArthurArthur was Mabels soldier sweetheartThat is the trouble sighed Mabel 1havent heard from him for ages but Iam expecting him home daily His regiment came last week but he was notwith it Perhaps he stopped somewhereto rest It is a wonder they didnt all diedown there in that oven of a placeThen under her breath she added 1hate that dream of muddy water1 thought you didnt believe indreams exclaimed Florence1 dont butShe was interrupted by the appearanceof Me and lack upon the canvasThere was a ripple of subdued laughteras the little girl fell from the ropei intthe water the dog swimming coolly offand leaving her thereTic ure after picture was then prepared There was the naval parade thewarships passing up the liudson theyachts skimming swiftly in front ofthem partially obstructing the view ofthe sailors who stood like white statuesalong their decks next Hobson walkedleisurely down the deck of a little cruiser then a review of tae troops at Tampawas announcedPerhaps it is Arthurs regiment thatis to be reviewed whispered Mabelclasping her hands ecstatically togetherOh I hope soThere was a drumbeat and before adim vista of white tents the troops passed in reviewTheir faces look sad said Florenceand they walk as if they were tired todeathA white dog the mascot of the regiment occupied the center of the canvasfor a second a soldier followingA piece of paper floated along behindThen came a row of six stalwart menThe man in frout suddenly turned hisface toward the audience He lookedstraight at Mabel Uis eyes were hollow and sad Intense weariness wasstamped upon every line of his gauntfeaturesMabel leaned eagerly forward Shelaid hold of Florences armLook Florence she gasped Lookit is ArthurIn a moment the face was gone fromthe canvas others had taken its placethe drum ceased to beat the review wasover and the canvas was dark againMabel was white to the lips She hurriedly gathered up her belongings herfan her handkerchief her opera glassesWhat are you about asked Florence The thing is not half overI cant help it said Mabel I mustgo now The heat in here is stifling Icant stand it I must have the freshairOutside she trembled so that Florencetook her armIf I were you she said 1 should beglad that I saw him Why do you worry soHis eyes were hollow and sad stammered Mabel and his cheeks were thinHe looked so tired so dead tired OhFlorence suppose he is very ill suppose oh remember my dreamFlorence affected an overwhelming surpriseI thought you didut believe indreams said sheI dont I dont Who but an idiotwould believe in such rank foolishnessbut you cant help thinkingOh yes ron can Come wo will takecar and 1 will see you home myself Dont be sillyBy the time they reached the houseFlorence had coaxed the girl into something like her old ga ety She laughedat a bit of her n insense as they ran upthe steps togetherThey passed into the hall On a littletabic reserved for cards lay a letterMabel took it up and held it betweenher forefinger and thumb It was oldand yellow A dozen postmarks disfigured the face of it upou which there wasno stampFlorence took it from herI will open it for you she saidMabel sank upon her knees on thecarpet She remained there tremblingher white face clasped between her slender bloodless fingersShe saw once more the tired face onthe canvas the weary limbs dragginglaggingly along the hollow eyes peering straight into hers in all the sadnessof a last farewellFor before Florence could
