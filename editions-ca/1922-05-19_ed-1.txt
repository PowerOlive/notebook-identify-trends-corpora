Thiswill probably continue for a periodof from two to four weeks. Themarketing of old hens also is increasing, due to the fact that inmost sections, the flush egg production is over. "There is a good demand for alldressed poultry, which should keepthe market on a firm basis for sometime.Production of butterfat is nowincreasing rapidly, and as a resultthere Tias been a freer movement ofcreamery butter to the large markets, causing prices to re-act to alower basis. The production shouldshow a further increase weekly forsome time, and this should have" atendency to cause somewhat lowerprice levels. 'The warm weather in egg producing sections in the past few days hascaused a better demand for moreeggs from the northerly sections andless injury for the eggs in storageat present time are somewhat heavier than a year ago, and with thegeneral quality now showing theeffects of warmer weather, the tendency of the market may be lower.It is important that producersgather eggs daily, keep them in acool place, and market them frequently.

Figures compiled by the experts at the Ibureau of standards of the department of commerce show that therewere 13,560 licensed radio stations inthe United States in 1921, an increase of more than three thousandover 1920. Amateur radio stationsthat receive only are not includedin the licensed list. It has been estimated that there are six hundredthousand to one million receivingsets now in existence, "while a yearago there were not more than sixtythousand. The pre-war peak was in1916, when the number of licensedstations was slightly over fifty-sixhundred. During the war there wasa large drop in the number becauseall but official stations were prohibited. In 1904 the money investedin the production of radio telegraphinstruments was only $114,050 andin 1919 the amount had risen fo$7,600,698.

The discussions at' theEuropean economic conference in session at Genoa have aroused an Interest in Kthe subject of internationaltrade as it compares with pre-war andImmediately after the war periods.Mr. O. P. Austin statistician of theNational City bank of New. York, prepared the following interesting stateinterest BLu -conditions and the iment of world tradetable of Imports and exports of 25 ofthe principal nations of the world,which accompanies this article. Mr.Austin says:World International trade in 1921was only about two-thirds as much instated value as in the immediately preceding year. Ofliclal reports of the1921 Imports and exports of 25 principal countries of the world aggregate, when transformed to U. S. dollars at the par value of their respective currencies, approximately $52,000,000,000 against $79,000,000,000 in1920, a reduction of approximately 34per cent in stated value.The principal countries for which1921 figures are now available includeall of Europe except Russia, Poland,Germany, Portugal, Greece and thestates formed 'from the Austro-Hun-garianempire; the United States,Canada, Cuba, Argentina, Brazil andUruguay in America; India, Japan,Australia, Nevy Zealand and the Philippines in the Trans-Pacific area;Egypt and the South African Union InAfrica. They are representative countries, typifying jthe great industries ofthe world; the European countries,the United States and Japan, theworld's great manufacturers; Canada,uba, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay,Egypt, South Africa, Australia andNew Zealand great producers of foodand manufacturing material, while theUnited States also belongs In part tothis second group. Their combinedImports and exports formed two-thirdsof the International trade of the worldIn the year before the war, aggregating in 1913 $28,000,000,000 out of aworld total of $40,000,000,000r Assuming that these 25 countries still represent approximately two-thirds of theworld's trade, the total world commerce of 1921 would stand at about$78,000,000,000 in stated value, againstapproximately $118,000,000,000 Jn 1920,and $40,000,000,000 In 1913.Currency More. Stable.While comparisons of world tradein 1921 with that of earlier years arerendered difficult by reason of thefluctuations, in the value of the currencies in which the commerce of certain countries Is measured, it happensthat the currencies of the 25 countriesfor which 1921 figures are now available show less violent changes duringthe past 12 months than those of certain other commercial countries wuuaetrade figures are not yet available insufficiently complete form to justifytheir inclusion in the tabulation herepresented or to render possible a comparison of their 1021 totals with thoseof 1920. In most of the European countries for which 1921 figures are available, the change in the past year inthe value of currencies has been lessmarked than In earlier years and Inmany cases the year- has shown distinct improvements and this is alsotrue of the currencies of the non-Europeancountries which ft has been possible 'to Include in the accompanyingtabulation. In the mere matter of apnmnnrison of trade values -in 19211 with those of the immediately preceding year the record presented uy i"25 countries may therefore be looked-upon as a' fairly -correct picture of theactual changes in tha total valuationof the trade of the countries includedin the table.What Fall in Trade Indicates.A more detailed study oMhe fall -intrade figures, country by country, suggests that the, 1921 reduction occursQ inrirpr decree in manufactures" e 1 products, whichd bm U how declined pric' ,28,014 13.308 85,152S.

In the-case of the- United States, tne exportsof finished manufactures show a fallof practically 50 per cent In value in1921 when compared with 1920, whilemanufacturing material shows a reduction of 47 per cent, and foodstuffsS3 per cent. In the United Kingdomstatements, the exports of, manufactures In 1921 show a fall of 48 percent, while those of the group "foodand drink" show a fall of but 27 percent. In nearly all the countries of theworld whose chief exports are manufactures, the per cent of "reduction In1921 is far greater than that of thecountries whose chief exports are agricultural products. In the 10 principalcountries in which manufactures 'forma large per cent of exports, the falloff In their aggregate exports In 1921Is 38 per cent and in the 10 countrieswhose chief exports are agriculturalproducts, the 1921 reduction Is but 20per cent when compared with 1920.The whole world was compelled to buyfood and manufacturing materials In'1921, while those who desired to economize In their purchases of manufactures were better able to do so thanin the matter of food or even "manufacturing material, and hence It happens- centage of reduction In.. . p ,.h.0 onforint?international trade in 1921 is materially greater than that of food or manufacturing material.TAKE MOSCOW CHAPEL GEMSJewels Valued at 200,000 FoundMissing in Midst-of Requisitioningof Church Treasures.Moscow.
