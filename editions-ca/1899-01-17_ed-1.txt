Mile bythe War BoardWashington Jan 14 Gen Laganspersonal vituperation of the commanding general of the army irrespective ofthe merits of the embalmed beef scandal is looked upon by the entire armyas a military crime an act of scandalous insubordination and a defiant disrespect of regulations which must notbe permitted to go unpunished Fromthe president down the authorities look upon Etgans violence as a heinous breach of decorumwhich separates his cae altogetherfrom the beef controversy and requires that he be drastically disciplinedfor his undignified male rolent attackupon a superior officer in contravention of the ordinary decent amenetiesof civil as well as military societyThe judge advocate generals department of the army is of the opinionthat Gen Eagan is guilt of conductfor which the only sentence is dismissalGen Miles has taken no notice oithe attack and will apparently awaitto see whether the authorities willtake any step to punish so flagrant anoffence The fact is all the officials arestunned by the indiscretion and intemperance of Gen Eagan and wil lnotict hastily in an affair of such importance Perhaps several days mayelapse before a course of official proeedure is announcedThe following is the text of ft letterordered by the war inquiry commissionto be sent to Jen EaganWashington Jan 13 199Brig Gen C P Eagan CommissaryGeneral War DepartmentSir We respectfully inform you thatafter your testimony was read Thursday the lollowing resolution waaunanimously passedMoved That the commission receiveGen Eagans testimony without comment that it be not printed at oncebut held for the consideration of thcommission CarriedHaving now considered the questiontinvolved we have determined that inmany instances the vituperative language used by you was no1such as ought to have been addressed as a witness to thisboard We that the personal attacks and irrelevant statements contained in the papers submitted shouldbe eliminated and before receiving itas testimonv we request that vou willrevise its language and if you chooseresubmit it for our considerationWe herewith return your papersVery respectfullySigned Chakiks DenuyVice PresidentGen Eagan was at work in his officepromptW as usual FridayHe refused to say anything beyondwhat he had given to the war commission Thursday saying that his statement then was a full declaration of hisfeelings and his beliefs It was an official titterance he said made to thebody which had a right to hear it andhe declined to enter into an expost facto newspaper warIt was stated at the war departmentFriday that orders had been issued tcInspector General Breckinridge to proceed to Porto Rico and Cuba for a thorough inspection of the army campsthere The idea is ridiculed that thisorder has any connection with the heelinvestigation set on foot by Gen Milesand now being prosecuted by the inspector generals officeAt Fridays cabinet meeting a largeshare of the time was consumed in adiscussion of Gen Eagans testimonybefore the war investigating committee Thursday The cabinet membershowever were unusually reticent withrespect to what was said and declinedto express any opinion as to what iianything would be done in the matterwhich is now in the hands of the president and Secretary Alger Nevertheless all cabinet members commendthe action of the committee in declining to receive the manuscript of GenEagans testimony until the objectionable epithets have been expurgatedThere is no doubt that the presidentdeeply regrets the incident and it is almost certain that official cognizancewill be taken of the matter very soonThe question was discussed of how farGen Eagan may be entitledto immunity from punishment underthe recent public statement of the secretary of war by the direction of thepresident to the effect that all witnesses appearing before the commission would be protected in their rightsand positions if in the service of theUnited States regardless of whomtheir testimony might be directedagainstIt was gatheretl from friends of GenEagan Friday that he is prepared toaccept the suggestion conveyed in theletter of the war inquiry commissionand will amend his statement so

IntelligentOn the Aiiiivjmi River He Found mTribe of Warlike Cannibals BatNever Once Fired in Self DefenseESQLondon Jan 16 Probably therehas been no such interest circlingaround Africa travelers and geographers since the time of Henry M Stanleys expedition as has been caused bythe arrival here of a young and hitherto unknown Englishman Mr AlbertBushnill Lloyd from Central Africaafter a record journey of three monthsfrom the heart of Africa to Londontraveling over Stanleys route downthe Congo to the west coastHis journey was in one respectmore remarkable than Stanleys inasmuch as Mr Lloyd traveled quite aloneso far as Europeans were concernedand was only accompanied by two native servants and a small number olcarriers Moreover although hemarched three weeks in the Pigmy forest and then traversed the wholelength of the Aruwimi river the banksof which are lined with wjirlike cannibals he never once fired a shot in selfdefense On the contrary he was oncordial terms with both Pigmies andcannibalsOn entering the great primeval formest Mr Lloyd went west for five dayswithout sight of a Pygmy Suddenlyhe came to a clearing and stopped atan Arab village where he ment a greatmany Pygmies They told me saidMr Lloyd that unknown to me theyhad been watching me for five dayspeeping through the growth of theforest They appeared very muchfrightened and even when speakingcovered their faces I asked achief to allow me to photographthe dwarfs and he brought me adozen together I was able to securea snapshot but I did not succeed in thetime exposure as the Pygmies wouldnot stand still Then I tried to measure them and found not one over fourfeet in height All were fully developedthe women somewhat slighter than themen I was amazed at their sturdinessThe men have long beards reachinghalf way down the chest They areverjr timid and will not look a strangerin the face their bead like eyes constantly shifting They are it struckme fairly intelligent I had a longtalk with a chief who conversedintelligently about their customs inthe forest and the number of thetribesmen Both men and womenexcept for a tiny strip of bark arequite nude The men were armedwith poisoned arrows The chief tujdme the tribes were nomadic and neverslept two nights in the same placeThey just huddled together in hastilythrown up huts Memories of thewhite traveler Mr Stanley of coursewho crossed the forest years agostill lingered among themMr Llo37d then proceeded throughthe cannibal countries to the coastHe found the cannibals warlike andfierce but open and straightforwardand had no difficulty with themAt one place he put together a bicycle he had with him and rode aroundthe village A remarkable scene followed thousands of cannibals menwomen and children turning outdancing and

forwardto ease the strain of the cords 1 beganto think and go over in my mind thewhole scene of the tragedy from the beginning to its bitter end 1 had nodoubt as to the personality of Babette1 was not likely to forget her voice Ihad heard it under circumstances thatought to have stamped it on my memory for all time and if I had the faintest doubts on the matter they were setat rest by the fact that she was so wellknown to de Gomeron she probablyhad been a camp follower on our sideand also by the still more damning factthat her house was known as the Toison dOr The name had been distinctly mentioned by her and its meaningwas clear to me when 1 thought of thedreadful scene over de Leyvas bodyAs for de Gomeron I knew Dim wellenough to understand his game Thewhole affair as far as he was concerned was a sudden and rapid resolvethat was clear I argued it out in thisway to mj self and as I went on thinking it was almost as if some one wasreading out a statement of the case tome It was evident that the free lancewas to the last moment in hopes thatthe king would yield to Birons intercession on his behalf When that wasrefused he may have had some idea ofgaining his end by force but

enough forhim My disappearance my dead horsepoor Couronne all these wouldpoint to me as the author of the abduction and give de Gomeron the time hewanted to perfect his plans The man Ihad run through would never tell talesand so far the game lay in the Camarguers handsAnd then about madame As I became calmer I saw that for his ownsake de Gomeron would take care thather life was safe at any rate for thepresent and whilst there was this contingency there was hope for her ifnone for me as I felt sure that whatwith the king and madames relativesof the Tremouille on one hand andSully and de Belin on the other thingswould go hard with de Gomeron whatever happened to meHour after hour passed I shifted myposition and strange to say sleptHow long I slept I know not but Iwoke stinging with pain and found thiswas due to my being bound as 1 wasand in a little the agony became almost insupportable and I was on theverge of going into a delirium onlyrighting my failing senses by a mightyeffort of willI had lost all count of the time butguessed it was advanced in the day bythis and my eves had become so accustomed to the darkness that I couldmanage to see the faint outlines of thecell in which 1 was imprisoned Itried to make out its extent with an idleand useless cariosity and then giving itup and utterly hopeless leaned myhead on my upraised knees and sat thuswaiting for the endI longed for death to come now itwould be a happy release from my painSuddenly there came a grating noiseas the bolts outside were moved Thenthe door of the cell swung open with agroaning and there was a blindingflash of light that for the time beingdeprived me of the powers of sightthough with a natural instinct 1 shutmy eyes to the flash as it cameThen I heard de Gomerons voice saying Remove the gag 1 have something to ask monsieurAs I felt two cold hard hands fumbling with the knots of the gag I managed to open my eyes though the lightstill pained me and saw the tall figureof the free lance his drawn sword in hishand standing in the open doorwayand kneeling beside me was BabetteThe hag caught the loathing in myglance and laughed to herself as slipwrenched at the knots and de Gomeron who was evidently in no mood todelay hurried her efforts with a sharpQuickIt is done she answered and roseto her feet swinging the silken bandsof the gnir she held in hor handThen have the goodness to step backwhilst M dAuriac and discuss the positionBabette did as she was bidden muttering something and de Gomeron advancing a pace addressed meMonsieur 1 have come to make 3011an offer and I will not waste words Tam playing to win a desperate gameand 1 shall not hesitate to play any cardto win My offer is this I ask you tosign a formal document which T shallbring to you holding me guiltless ofany design against either youorMmede la Bidache In return I will set youfree in ten days after you sign this paper During that time you must consider yourself my prisoner but youwill be better lodged than now Shouldyou refuse to accept this offer there isnothing left for me but to leave you heTeto dieHe spoke in slow measured accentsand the vault of the roof above me gaveback the mans words in a solemn echoThe light of the lantern stretched in along yellow shaft up the spiral stairway beyond the door and half in thislight and half in shadow stood thewitchlike figure of Babette leaning alittle forward as if striving to catcheach word that was spokenIn the silence that followed the freelances speech I could almost hear theblood throbbingin my temples and forthe moment I was deprived of all powerof words It was not from fear norfrom any idea of accepting the ofLerbut a thought had come to my mind Iwould oppose craft with craft and meetthe fox in the skin of a foxGive me 24 hours to decide I answered and free me from these cordsI cannot think for the pain of themBardieu He laughed The knotshave been well tied but 24 ho urn is aloner timeYet you are willing to accommodateme for ten days better lodged Yentrebleu M de Gomeron do you think Ican scratch my way out of thisHe did not answer me but stocd forawhile biting at the ends of his thickmustache Then he suddenly cal ed toBabette Cut the cordsShe came forward and obeyed Wordscannot convey the sensation of reliefas the cords fell from me but f r thetime being so numbed was I that I waspowerless to moveYou have your desire monsieursaid de Gomeron and I await yourdecision It will save me trouble ifyou inform Babette whether oi agreeor not In the former event we shallbav the pleasure of meeting agiin inthe latter case I take the opportunityof wishing you as happy a time as aman may have in the future life Tnthe meantime I will see that some refreshments are sent to you adieuHe turned and stepped out of the celland stood for a moment whilst Babettepicked up the lantern and followed himMonsieur will not want the lightto aid him to think she laughed andthen the door was shut I heard thesullen clank of the chain the turningof the great keys and I was alone andin darkness once moreDark it may have been but thankGod I was no longer like a trussedfowl and betook myself to rubbing mynumbed limbs until finally the chilledblood was warmed and I was able tostand and then in a little gainedstrength to grope tny way backwardand forward in the cell as an exerciseNo thought of ever agreeing to de Gomerons terms ever crossed me I hadhowever resolved to make a dash forfreedom when he came to me again Ishould pretend to agree and then win orlose all in the rush Anyway I wouldnot die here like a rat in a trap I almost chuckled to myself as I thought Iwas in a fair way to outwit the freelance He was a fool after all thoughat the same time I could not but admitthat his move to get me to admit his innocence was a skillful one still it wasa plot which might overreach itself Mycaptors had eased me of my belt whichwas so well stuffed with pistoles Theyhad not however had time or opportunity to search me further and had leftmy clasp knife which lay in my pocketas I have said together with a dozen orso of gold pieces I had kept there to beat hand I pulled out the knife andopening it ran my fingers along theblade It was three inches or so inlength but sharp as a razor and withit one might inflict an ugly wound in astruggle I mapped out my planmentally When de Gomeron cameagain I should fell him as he entered arm myself if possible by snatching his sword and then cut my way outor be cut down I had no doubt that Imight be able to effect the first part ofthe programme In those days I was asstrong as a bull and there were fewmen especially if they were unprepared who could have stood a blowfrom me It was in act two that I mightcome to grief At any rate it should bea final and quick ending to the business not the long-drawn-out agony Iwould otherwise have to endure Nowthat I think of it it was a poor enoughplan and it was lucky that underprovidence another way was shown tome Such as it was however it wasthe only thing that occurred to me atthat time and it would not be for wantof effort on my part that it would failThe more I thought over it then themore I was convinced that it was mysole chance and I grew impatient forthe moment when I should put mydesign into execution Twenty fourhours was long to wait and I raved atmyself for having fixed such a timeMorhleu I might have had the senseto make it five or three or two hoursI little guessed as I paced the cell impatiently how many hours had passedsince de Gomeron left me and that itwas impossible to measure time in thatloathsome dungeon As I sat broodingthe profound silence was once moresuddenly disturbed by the sudden jarring of a bolt It was not however theI adJI I KREMOVE THE GAGdoor of my cell that was

fulllength of the armIf you scream if you utter a sound Iwill tear your arm from its socketThe answer was a shriek that mighthave been heard a half mile away andthen a foul oath and a howl of painIt was a knightly deed but therewas too much atstake to mince matters and on her scream I gave theprisoners arm I held a wrench strongenough to show that I could keep myword As the shrill echoes of her crydied away I could hear her breathingheavily on the opposite side of the doorand she struggled mutely and with surprising strength to free herself Therewas no answer to her call for helpthere must have been many a shriek forhelp that had rung through that terrible dungeon and died away answerless but for the mocking echoes AndBabette knew this for she ceased toutter a sound after that one longscream and fought in silence like a shewolf at bay At last she leaned exhausted against the door and I felt thathalf my game was won It had been anunexpected thought and I had jumpedat the Providence hadthrown in my wayDo you hear I said Open thedoor or and I gave another half turnto her armShe who could inflict such sufferingon others was of those who were unable to bear the slightest pain themselves She moaned in agony and calledout Free me and I promise I promise anythingI only laughed and repeated my order reliexing the strain on her armhowever so that she could slip back ahalf

a chance to get tired of sittingthere and go to bed before I began forif I didnt he might wake up any minute and interrupt things So I took aseat in a big leather chair in the librarynext room and waited for him to wakeup When Id waited what I thoughtwas a reasonable time without hearingfrom him I looked in again and thereagainst i he was still sitting there just the sameBut this time even in that lightthere was something peculiar about himand I ventured to turn my own light onhim now and then I saw that it wasnta man at all but a suit of clothes witha bat ou top set up there to dry

Action of InflamedGases Cnmei the First Serious InJnry How the Projectile ilclps toKill the GunThe larger a cannon the more extensive are the injuries it receives vvitheach successive discharge All damaged me to a gun is internal The separateaction of the powder and the projectiledamages the piece every time it is aimedand CrecL Obviously the amount of thedana depends upon the material andworkmanship of the gun Men whomake big guns describe the harm donetheir pets with many intricate and puzzling terms of a scientific turn In onecase a gun is damaged because the partof the bore which contains the powderis enlarged This happens when themetal is compressed and it is more dangerous and more plainly seen if thegunners have been using wads betweentheir explosive and their projectileThen again cavities are produced bythe melting away of a part of the metalby tbe heat of combustion of the chargeCracks come from the tearing asunderof the particles of the metal at the surface of the bore When it is first madea crak of this particular kind is barelyperceptible but it increases each timethe gun is fired Gradually it extendscompletely through the side of thepiece The crack usually begins at thejunction of the chamber with the boresimply because as guns now are thispart is not so well supported as tbeothersEdward S Farrow U S A is authority on damage to guns althoughhike all others who have studied thequestion he does not agree with verymany authorities on all the points toconsider in the life of a cannon He contends that furrowing or scoring producedby the erosive action of inflamed gasesis tbe great disease which attacks thevery big guns first This particular injury is most apparent where the currentof the gas is most rapid or at the interior orifice of the vent and on tbe surface of the bore directly over the seatof the projectile This scoring beginsvery early in the life of a very largegun but it is conceded that it does notbecome very important until the piecehas been discharged considerably Lieutenant Farrow describes this scoring asresembling the bark of an aged elm treetbe metal being eaten away into irregular furrows and ridges In extremecases however scoring has not killedthe gun although in some cases it hasacted like a wedge and split the bore atthe place attackedWhere the action of the projectile hasruined the gun the damage has beendone around the projectile and in frontof it The elasticity of the metal andthe crowding up of portions of it infront ox the shot cause a reboundingprosess The projectile carried forwardby the force of the charge strikesagainst the upper part of the bore thenit is sent against the bottom and againbounds to the top and so on until itemerges from the piece The effect ofthis bounding motion is to raise and depress the gun in its trunnion holes Theaccuracy of fire is diminished and ofcourse the gun is unfit for serviceBronze guns are the worst sufferers inthis way Mortars short and dumpyare not affectedTo stop the bounding of the projectilegunners wrap the shell in cloth or paper or else shift the base of the massto be hurled This last process is considered the best and is done by reducing the diameter of the cartridge andadding to its length Projectile injuryis also caused by furrows or scratchesmade by rough shells or case shotSmall fragments too break away veryoften from the shells and give the borea grinding and cutting process productive of great damageEnlargement of the muzzle is anotherserious injury produced by the projectile This is caused by a process whichseems unavoidable As the shell leavesthe piece it strikes against one portionof the bore The resistance at the mouthbeing less than at any other point themetal naturally yields and the muzzleof the cannon is elongated in a verticaldirectionSome men who ought to know saytkat 150 shots is the life of a very biggun a 12 or 13 inch weapon Othersplace the number of shots at 400 or 500Ai a matter of fact it is all guessworkThe great Krupp gun shown at theWorlds fair and conceded to be perfector supposed to be so has been discharged less than ten times and it ishow believed t have reached its liraotOn the other hand the big guns of theAmerican battleships have passed thetime allotted them by wTise men whoknow guns and apparently are as goodas when tested How soon they mayyield however is not in the booksLieutenant Farrow says that a verylarge gun should not be expected tostand more than 400 or 500 shots beforeit will be necessary to open a new ventclesing the old one at its interior orificeWhen the gun dies bursts the linesef fracture are photographed Specimens of the metal are saved Teets aremade and conclusions drawn And Uncle Sam has figured out so many thingsin this same connection that his gunsnowadays are conceded to be better thanthose of any other maker They livelonger than the wise ones say theyshould Chicago Times HeraldEverybody WarnedAn Arizona rancher
