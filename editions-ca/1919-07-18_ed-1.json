Lots of people keep money in their boots, but who ever thought that
romance, thrills and intrigue could be found in them? See what Dorothy
Gish's boots hold. It's the same Dorothy Gish who played in "Hearts of

Mr. Henry Patterson and Mrs.

same.
The fifth annual Chautauqua, of
iMillersburg, is being well attended.
Some of the numbers thus far do not
3neasure up with last year, while
Joflaers are exceedingly good. The
symphony concert Wednesday after
noon was all that could be expected
irom an orchestra of its size, as was
the lecture which followed in the
evening. Mr. Goldsmith in his lect
ure, on the League of Nations, Tues
day night, was generally pleasing.
On the whole, the program is very
good, and Millersburg will sign up
jfor the sixth Chautauqua.

SEKTUCKY- BLUEGRASS CROP
SHOWS BIG INCREASE.
A somewhat larger production of
."bluegrass seed than last year in
Kentucky and considerably larger
production in Missouri and Iowa is
reported by numerous correspondents
in the seed-producing sections of
these States. The summaries of the
reports received from Kentucky, are
given below:
The' acreage of Kentucky bluegrass
seed that was stripped this season i
in Kentucky beginning June 5 and
ending about June 20, was about 95
per cent, more than that of last year,
ience the reduced acreage this year
is more than offset by the increased
yield per acre, resulting in a produc
tion this season of approximately
400,000 bushels of stripped seed as
compared with an estimated pro
duction last season of 350,000 bush
elf?. . o

JOHN FOX, JR.
(Paducah News-Democrat)
John Fox, Jr., the Kentucky nov
elist who made the Kentucky moun
tains and the mountain people fa
mous, is dead at the age of 56. We
scarcely thought him that old. It
seems such a little while ago that we
recall hearing him mentioned as the
young Kentucky author, and we were
reading his first contributions to lit
erature with such interest. Even at
that his death came far too soon, for
one so gifted, and even when death
came was engaged on another book.
John Fox was in every sense of the
word a Kentuckian. He lived with
and loved the simple mountain folk,
and his true picture of them as set
forth in his numerous novels, has
done much to give them the place
they deserve in the estimation of the
public. His stories were mostly of
the mountain life in Eastern Ken-
1 tucky and had wide popularity. "The
Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come"
and "The Trail of the Lonesome
Pine" had the greatest popular ap
peal, and were most widely read, but
there were others that possibly might
be regarded as having equal, if not
greater, literary merit.
His first literary production of note
appeared in the early nineties and
he has ranked well among the pro
ducers of current fiction. He had
first place in his exclusive field and
this fact gave distinctive quality to
his work.
Many people in all parts of the
English-speaking world will regret to
learn that one who contributed so
much to their entertainment has died
in the prime of middle life.
In saying that he led in his exclu
sive field is not intended as a com
parison to other contemporary Ken
tucky writers. James Lane Allen,
earlier in the field but still alive,
wrote of Kentucky life, but of dif
ferent sections of the State. Fox
dealt with the mountains and has not
been surpassed in that particular
line.
His passing removed one who has
done much to give to the Kentucky j
mountains a charm which has ap
pealed and which will linger so long
as the name of John Fox survives.

But see "Oh, You Women!" before you answer. You may change

THE SWIRL OF KENTUCKY
POLITICS.
With the primary election but
fourteen days off, candidates are
making plans for a whirlwin finish.
The race between Gov. Black and
Judge Carroll, two leading Demo
cratic candidates for Governor, will
be close, politicians say, and they
now are seen as only noses apart.
P. J. Noel, Harrodsburg, who is op
posing Judge Carroll and Gov. Black
for the Democratic nomination for
Governor, has closed his headquar
ters in the Willard Hotel. In doing
so, however, he said it did not mean
he was out of the race, explaining
that his business was such that he
could not spend sufficient time in
Louisville to justify him in maintain
ing headquarters.
R. C. Oldham, candidate for the
Democratic nomination for Lieuten
ant Governor, has challenged his op
ponent, W. H. Shanks, of Stanford,
for an open discussion of important
campaign issues at Owenton, Mon
day, July 28.
Locally, the political pot is merely
simmering, as the candidates for
Councilmanlc offices have just begun
to circulate among their constitu
ents. Campaign managers for the
gubernatorial candidates are laying
their wires and perfecting arrange
ments for advancing the fortunes of
their favorites.
Another race said to be narrowing
down to a fine point is that between
Henry M. Bosworth, Lexington, and
John W. Rawlings, Danville, for the
Democratic nomination for State Au
ditor. Mr. Rawlings is said to be
making a whirlwind finish. Back
ers of Mr. Bosworth contend that he
has a comfortable lead, and will have
little trouble retaining it.
The voters are looking forward to
the meeting at Mayfleld next Mon
day, when Gov. Black and Judge
Carroll are expected to divide time.
By reason of the lack of contest with
in the Republican party, all interest
in the primary naturally centers
within the Democratic ranks. The
three races in which there is a con
test in the Republican ranks are
Attorney General and Railroad Com
missioner in the Second and Third
railroad districts, but the leaders of
the Republican party are taking
much interest in the outcome of the
Democratic nomination for Governor.
Efforts on the part of the rival as
pirants for the Democratic nomina
tion for Governor in the August pri
mary to stir up enthusiasm among
the Democratic voters throughout
the State has met with little success.
Old-time politicians assert that the
present campaign has been one of
the most apathetic in the history of
the State. The aspirants for the
nomination for the various State
offices to be filled by election in No
vember are busy beating the bushes
from one end of the State to the
other in an effort to work up suffici
ent enthusiasm to get the voters to
the polls on August 2.

"REILLY'S WASH DAY"
STATE HEALTH OFFICER ISSUES
INFLUENZA WARNING.
There will be 9,000 or 10,000
deaths from influenza in this State
this fall unless Kentuckians take
proper precautio-ns to ward off the
disease trough inocculation. Dr. A. T.
McCormick, of the Kentucky State
Board of Health, declared in an ad
dress before the Red Cross Insitute
in the University of Kentucky.
Dr. McCormick said he fears an
other epidemic.
"Every person in the State should
be inoculated in the last two weeks
of August and the first part of Sep
tember, and if this is done there wiU
be little likelihood of the epidemic
recurring" he said.
Dr. McCormick said 300,000 per
sons were inoculated in 1918, and
that only three died from influenza
or pneumonia.
The usual death rate in Kentucky
is 4,000, he said, but in 1918 there
were 15,000 deaths.
He also advised the creation of
county health departments, in charge
of trained doctors, who will devote
their entire time to this work.
The purpose of the State Health
Board, he said, is not merely to mul
tiply the county offices, but to place
men in charge of the county who
have proved they can really econom
ically and effectively reduce the sick
and death rate in that county.
The Red Cross course is being
given at the University to train
nurses for duty should there be an
outbreak. The lack of nurses to help
during the influenza epidemic last
fall cost many lives in Kentucky, it
is said.

Where Beauty and Economy Reign
MAY STOP KEEPING LIQUOR IN
HOMES.
A man's right to keep liquor in his
own home, which stood the test be
fore the, House Judiciary Committee,
must take its chances in the House.
Notice has been served on the com
mittee by one of its members that
when the house resumes considera
tion of the prohibition enforcement
measure an amendment would be
offered to make it unlawful for a per
son to retain possession of liquor
stored prior to July 1. The commit
tee, in framing the general enforce
ment measure, eliminated .the section
which would have made home storage
illegal, but the big majority polled
Monday by prohibitionists was ac
cepted in some quarters to mean that
the bill in certain respects will be
made still more drastic.
