Will Baker, colored, better known
as "Huggy," died last week in the
Frankfort penitentiary, where he was
serving a life sentence for murder,
the news of which was received here
yesterday. For more than a year he
had been in failing health.
The death of baker recalls the inci
dents in connection with the foulest
crime ever committed in the vicinity i
oi Miiiersourg, and for which the ne
gro was serving a sentence in the pen
itentiary. Several years .'ago a man by the
name of Willaim Burden, was found on
the veranda at the home of Mr. Silas
Cleaver, a short distance from Millers
burg, in an unconscious condition. and
suffering from the eifects of a blow on
the head with a blunt instrument. The
man diedwithout regaining consciousness.
UDOn the investi en linn ctf thn
authorities it was found that Burden
was first attacked while near the farm
of Mr. Henry Patterson, hnt hnw hp
came to be on the porch of the Cleaver
nome was never determined. Robbery
was evidently the motive as Burden
had been seen in Millersburgjthe after
noon preceding the murder, and was
known to have on his person a con
siderable sum of money.
