Sixmembers of our own race have bennominated as candidates for membership in the Oh General Assembly,three in Cuyahoga county, two inFranklin county, one in Hamlitoncounty."Six men in a legislative body mayhold the balance of power,-and forcethe ,majority to come to terms. TheBeatty bill hud teeth in it, and thepenalties which it would have imposed upon those who discriminatedagainst colored people seeking admission to hotels, theatres, places of publie resort and amusement, ice creamparlors, bathhouses, barbershops,public libraries, hospitals, billiardand pool rooms, schools, colleges anduniversities, pietuie shos and oftentimes public conveyances on land 01water, would soon have put a- stopto this injustice to the colored people.

He cannot(make any pre-election promises, butwhat is irrhis heart will be writteninto the law if he is supported by aLegislature in sympathy with him."More than that, we will have thomoral support of our candidate forthe Presidency, Senator Warren G.Harding. In his speech of acceptanceat Marion when he was notified ofhis nomination, he spoke -out unqualifiedly in favor of the rights of thecolored people. He said:" 'I believe the negro" citizens ofAmerica should be guaranteed thefull enjoyment of all their rights,that they have earned the full measure of citizenship bestowed", thattheir sacrifices in blood on the battlefields of the republic have entitledthem to all freedom and opportunity,all of the sympathy and aid that theAmerican spirit of 'fairness and juslice demands.'"In other words, they would havsthe right to choose the hotel at whichthey might stop, the theatre which.hey might artend, or the places otamusement and recreation to whichthey might. go, with -no questionsasked and no insults offered. TheBeatty bill provided penalties of $100to $500 fine, and thirty to .-ninetydays imprisonment, or both', withinihe disci etion of the court."With six of our own race in theLegislature, 'backed as they would beby Governor Davis, and. with themoral influence of. the incomingadministration of Warren G. Harding, we do not see how we couldfail to put over a measure similar tothe Beatty bill."With the Beatty bill enacted intolaw, colored pnen and women will heprivileged to go where they please,and when this right is enforced thewhite people will have moie respectfor you.

If it were true thatthe sellers had this whole problem Jin their beeping, as many suppose,then we would find commodity after commodity being raised in pricewith the new freight rates beingoffered as an excuse. But it is amistake to suppose that manufacturers and wholesalers control thesituation, for they ir. turn have todeal with new labor problems, newmethods of jmarketing, increasedcharges for their supplies, and conditions in industry that they couldnot have dreamed of when they engaged in business.

LOUIS, MO , Oct.. 14t Answering of former President WilliamHoward Taft rith shafts fashionedfrom his previous utterances with respect to the "central idea of theLeague of Nations," Article, X., wasthe task to which Governor James M.Cox Monday flight set himself beforea great audience in this city, to whichhe came from .Springfield, 111.,where he spoke to an equallyijmpressive meeting upon teespot where Lincoln debated withDouglass.It was calculated by the presidential candidate that the publication ofthe White House correspondenceMonday would drive the formerChief Executive into the open andexpose his hitherto sheltered flankto direct fire, and this was not withheld, lone.At the very outset in Springfieldhe ridiculed the recent assertion ofMr. Taft that Senator Warren G.Harding's election meant some kindof league, and quoted from a signedarticle, published m a St. Louis newspaper but Sunday, in which the former President said that "Harding'splan for a new association of nations" was "impracticable."Signatories Are Involved.The 40 countries now in the league,which, he declared, was functioning,would not be likely to abandon allthat had been accomplished to "makea new agreement, the article added.It was the utterance of Judge TaftMonday at Vancouver, virtually declaring: for the elimination of ArticleX. and repudiating almost entirely allthat had been revealed by the publication of the telegrams, that inducedGovernor Cox to level his rapid fireof interrogatories at the head of theleague to enforce peace.There was recalled initially thespeech delivered by Mr. Taft in January, 1920, a't the Academy of Music, Brooklyn, in which he used thisexpression :"I am inclined to think that thepersons who prepared the reservations, as a whole, were shootingdown Pennsylvania Avenue at theWhite House."There were nine salient queries directed at the object of the interrogations, the foundation of all of thembeing publicity spoken or printed expressions of Judge Taft since thecontroversy as to the ratificationwas begun.Text of Questions.The questions were these:"1. Did you not discuss ArticleX. in an article in The Covenanter,under the title 'The Principle WeFought For in these words : 'The lawof the league, with the sanction ofpower of the league, thus forbids theviolation of the international commandment, 'Thou shalt not steal byforce.. It is the embodiment of theprinciple that we entered and foughtthis war to maintain?""2. Did you not say also, in thesame article: 'The Monroe doctrine,as originially declared by Monroe,was Article X. limited to the aggression of non-American nations againstcountries of the Western hemisphere?" "3. Did you not also use thesewords in the same article: 'Article Xis one of the great steps forward provided in the league for the securingof general peace?""4. You say that the League toEnforce Peace, of which you wereChairman, had no Article in itsproposition. Shouldn't youhave beenmore frank with the American citizens; by telling them that your planhad but four articles in it, and thatyour substitute for- Article X wasArticle III? Can you deny that inyour Article III. you provided forthe joint use of the military forcesof the signatory powers in event ofviolation of the conditions of thecovenant?Appeal To Force Alleged."5. Did not your proposal carrya definite legal obligation to employforce, and in this respect was it notvery much more drastic than. ArticleX of the league?"6. You say that Senator Harding already has voted twice for theleague with reservations, but haveyou, not failed to say that your candidate, within the last two weeks,verv definitely announced that if hehad it to dotjver again he would notvote for the league, even with theLodge reservations?"7. You say that Senator Hardingpromises that as President he will1 indorse the covenant without ArticleX. To whom ha sbe- given th epromise? Certainly not to Senators Johnson and Borah. Everyone knows thathe has not given it to the Americanpublic. Has he given it to you? Ifso, is it not so much in conflict withSenator Harding's recent statement",that he proposes from now on to turnhis back on the league, with or without reservations, that it joins bothyou and him together in deliberatedeception."8. Assuming that the pledge hasbeen given to you then may we notanswer it with, your own words,spoken at a luncheon given by thecivic organizations of California, inwhich you said: "The gentlemen inthe Senate who are getting out todefeat this League of Nations arethose whom I would not trust overnight."Quotes From 1919 Address."9. How do you reconcile your recent statement that the Presidentwas responsible for the failure toratify the treaty with your statementin your Metropolitan Opera 'House'speech March 5, 1919, as follows: Ifthe president insists, as I hope hewill, that the league ber incorporatedin the peace treaty, and brings itback, responsibility for -postponingaeace is with the bodjf that refuses!fco ratify it."o NAbout 20,000,000 vfeet of timbei?ach year Is used in the manufacture of clothespins. .O;Since its foundation in 1904'tht'Carnegie' -Hero .
