sent to Samoa making variousrecommendations regarding the newform of government decided upon bythem as most suitable for the islanders These resolutions are based uponthe best features of the Berlin treatyand included the main features of theproposed treaty as amended and modified by the commissioners The officialreport of the commissioners and thedraft of the proposed amended treatyare said to be now on the way to therespective governmentsAmong other things the report saysThe chief evils may be in our opinion grouped under four heads1 Those which appear to inevitablyattend the election of a king in Samoaand his subsequent efforts to exert hisauthority2 Those which are due to the rivalryof foreign nationalities between themselves and to their position to takesides in the native politics and thus increase the importance and bitternessof the disputes which arise3 A third class of evils have theirorigin in the fact that for many yearsthere has been no law or governmentin Samoa other than native customoutside the limits of the municipalityMurder and other serious crimes haveremained unpunished when committedby persons of rank and the supremecourt and the nominal government

dollar before the steamer show-up always prowuing sue is sent outhere again Sebastiano cant get themoney where it is now in the wreckthats practically certain But hesmore than likely to keep on with hisfool soundings in the big proa until hefinally strikes the reef If he does Imay not have another opportunity toget anything up hell watch the placenight and daj Just at present hesbadly scared and isnt likely to domuch for a week or two especially ifhe sees no necessity for immediate action so 1 might easily store all thestuff in Tarofofo before he tackles theshoal again The chances are that itwould be safe in that fissure unless Jwere spotted going there too oftenBut suppose I managed to keep it allright until your return he would havestrong suspicions about the packageswhen they were being shipped Ofcourse if we got the treasure as far asManila he couldnt do muchThats where youre very much mistaken Im more afraid of what hecould do in Manila than here in theislandsWhy soBecause our fat friend Padre Sebastiano happens to be the bishop ofMindanao The cura let that out theother night when he had taken toomuch rum and water It would be aneasy matter for him to have me arrested upon some trumped up chargeas soon as the steamer reached portand have all her cargo stored ashorepending my examination So even ifthey failed to nold me there would betime and opportunity for him to spiritaway anything he wantedThe devil Well any way you lookat it Dick weve got to remove thatstuff inside of o days If it cant bedone one way it must another Theresmoney on that reef to buy a flee ofsteamers or to settle any indebtednesswe may incur Cant you charter avessel in ManilaT was just thinking of that Sfes 1could of course Vet it wouldnt besafe to take anything but an Englishor Dutch bottom Id want to pckmy own crew and know pretty wellwho were on board couldnt do thatwith one of the companias boats andthere might happen to be nothing elsein port Theres one thing that niio tbe

litjunoyages at least that n ie umpoijary arrangement Now betwefc eachrip we usually lay up at Cavite for twoweeks and Ramirez has twice tried tccharter her for a quick run to Hong-ong in that time The Countessould easily make Guajjin and Hong-ong out of Manila in 16 days at theWutside allowing a day and a half toload at the island if we needed itThen we could reach Saigon in fivemore and turn her over to thement in time to make theSebastiano looked like a wreck when stop and pass the time of day with a ageries connection all righthe appeared that morning He accounted for this upon the ground ofillness to which he was occasionallysubject and said that he would beobliged to rest for several da3s thathe had been working too nird uponhis book But in some mvsteriousfriend You needn t be so stuck upDick Ill bet a doubloon onza that Ican give the Countess five knots andbeat her into Tomil from hereI could see the color fade out of Halsteads face as he leaned far over therail and looked at me As for DiazWhat would it cost to charter herWeii probably a little more thanwhat the compania pays Shell register over 3000 tons gross and can do14 knots when she wants to thatspretty stiff

Miguelsher up onthe6000 easy enoughAny expenses besides thatOf course there are Coal bills atleast 9000 a month if you keep shoving 14 knots out of her Shell burnover 30 tons a day at that speed andyou cant get decent free burning coalin Manila for less than eight dollarsThen there are port charges consulsfees demurrage and numerous incidentals all of which fall upon thecharterer The owner pays the salaries of officers and crew repairs andthe special expenses of the shipSo that wed blow in the wholetwenty thousand on the mere uie ofiuc skmiiii i mi a iiiuuiuHmwell at least eighteen I

investmentThat depends a great deal upon heargo and the time of year shes incommission Freights are so lov atpresent that half of them dont iAyexpenses still the tramps that irkeover 12 knots are doing most of thebusiness and at something of aprofitDick weve got to buy the Countessthats what weve got to do Howmuch would Ramirez take for herHm she cost 45000 to build onthe Clyde and shes as good a compound tramp as there is on salt water But the triple expansion boatsthat theyre turning out carry morecrjfo with less coal and he couldntbegin to get that for her now If wewere to offer 100000 10000 downnd the balance within six monthsnd he were satisfied as to ouribilitv I think hed let us have herThen well take her If you dontcare about the investment Ill buy hermyself Now how soon can you getack to Ay anaId want at least six days in Manilao discharge coal up and settle maters with Ramirez The governmentay kick a little if they want theteamer for another trip but I guesse old man can fix that well payiem a few thousand rather than havean- hitch about it Say 18 days fromnow how would that do Will you beable to manage it and beat the padrefor that length of timethats fairly safe No matterwhat he may discover it will be impossible for him to head you off inManila this trip and when we own theship the passenger list will be as limited as the mail contract Then againyoull have an new crew regularly shipped for our own voyage Bythe way why did you speak of makingHong Kong firstBecause the Hong Kong Shanghai Banking corporation will undoubtedly be able to handle the silver forus They have a capital of ten millionsa reserve fund of four and a half andMexican dollars coined even as farback as 1700 are the current mediumof exchange in China to day Anywhere else the discount on silver especially old silver would be so heavythat wed have to sell the stuff byweight so we would get more for themon the Chinese coast than in any otherlocalityGuess youre right I didnt
