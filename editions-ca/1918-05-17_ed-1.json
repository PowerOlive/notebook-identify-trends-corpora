Of Them We Ask Their Lives;
Of You Only Money
THERE is only one way to give to the Red Cross give till your
heart says stop. A little contribution is only a salve to pride.
This is not to say that contributions of only one dollar, or
even of only one nickel, are not desired and needed. They are!
For you to give $5 when you can give $25 for you to give
$25 when you can give $100, or to" give $100 when you can give
$500 is to dodge the heaviest obligation that this war has
laid upon you. Remember, this is not a charity: this is a duty.
No man can tell you how much you
ought to give. Except this: that
"Over There the ned is so great
that only by catting to the quick,
only by giving all that you think you
can give and then mofeonly by giv
ing not a little of your excess but
much of it only by taking from your
own children and from your wife and
from yourself, can the need of the
men who are fighting for you and the
needs of the children of the men who
have died for you be met
Millions of loyal Americans will
pledge a part of each month's earn
ings during June, July, August and
Sept. $100,000,000 must be raised.
What Will Ypu Do To Help?
Red Cross 2nd War Fund May 20-27
Every cent given to Red Cross War Fund goes for
War Relief.
The American Red Cross is the largest and most
efficient organization for the relief of suffering that
the world has ever seen.
It is made up almost entirely of volunteer work
ers, 10,000,000 unselfish Americans.
It is today bringing relief to suffering humanity,
both military and civil, in every war-torn Allied
country. t '
It is there to help our soldier boys in timeof
need.
By helping the starving women and children in
the ruined districts of France and Italy it performs
a distinctly military service. A soldier who knows
that Red Cross is helping his family fights with
renewed spirit.
Thus does Red Cross help to win the war.
Congress authorizes it.
President Wilson heads it
The War Department audits its accounts.
Your Army, your Navy, and your Allies enthusi
astically endorse it.
Twenty-two million Americaps have joined it
