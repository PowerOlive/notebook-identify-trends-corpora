Power, president of thePower Grocery Co., endorsed certainnotes for Alexander, which wereoutstanding at the time the bankclosed. These notes were paid byPower out of funds of the PowerGrocery Ca, Power- claiming thatthe amounts so paid were advancements to Alexander, and also claimed a lien on Alexander's interest inthe grocery company, prior to theclaims of the bank.

Infact, I don't think there was a singleday during those two yeart butwhat I felt miserable and none ofthe many medicines I took did meany good."So many people here in Daytonwere making statements and praising Tanlac that I began taking itmyself and it certainly is wonderfulhow quickly this medicine got me tofeeling right again. By the time Ihad finished my first bottle therewas a considerable improvement inmy condition. My appetite wasmuch better, I could sleep soundly,and that tired feeling left me. ThenI got another bottle, then anotherand when I finished the three bottlesevery sign of my troubles had disappeared. Since that time I have beeneating just anything I want, sleeping like a child, and feeling fine allthe time. I was -just telling somofriends to-day it seems hard for meLto eat enough to satisfy my appetite.I remcKiber how disappointed I waslit not being able to enjoy Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner duringthe two yeais my stomach was insuch a disordered .condition.

That iswhy the following statement madeby Mis..F. C. Spayner, formerly anurse at the city hospital here,here, should prove especially convincing to hundreds of people. Mrs.Spanyer has taken Trutona andknows from experience just what itwill do."My system was generally run.down," said Mrs. Spanyer. "I haddigestion so badly that I could hardly eat anything. My back wouldache frequently and I often hadheadaches which would be accompanied with dizziness. I felt tired outall the time and could hardly do hiyhousework. I tell you I was in anawful shape."I was formerly emergency nurseat the City Hospital, and ought tobe able to judge the merits of amedicine, when I have had experience, with all kinds for years. Well,sir, the first time I tasted Trutona Isaid, 'There's a real nedicine,alright.' I give Trutona credit formaking a new woman out of me, anddid it after many other midicineshad failed. I can eat heartily nowand the food digests properly. I getup in the morning feeling fine andable to do my housework. I hopeother people who are suffering willtake the advice of a nurse whoknows and try Trutona."Trutona is now being introducedand explained in Paris at G. S.

And this is a good timeto renew the acquaintances with oldBen, who was greater even as amoral philosopher than as statesman.In a period of extravagance andspiritual restlessness, Ben Franklin'svoice has the welcome and helpfulsound of a good parent's voice to atroubled child.When he was still a young man,Franklin wrote a set of principleswhereby to discipline his life. Andhe kept books on himself, givinghimself a black mark whenever hefailed to iive up to one of his ownlules. Ere aimed to have a cleanpage every day.Franklin's personal principles asset forth in his Autobiographywere :Resolution: Resolve to performwhat you ought; perform withoutfail what you resolve.Frugality: Make no expense butto do good to others or yourselves.Waste nothing.Industry: Lose no time; be always employed in something useful;cut out all unnecessary actions.Sincerity: Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly,and, if you spepk, speak accordingly. Justice: "Wrong none by doinginjuries or omitting the benefitsthat are your duty.Moderation: Forebear resentinginjuries as much as you think theydeserve; avoid extremes.Tranquility: Be not disturbed attrifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable. Humility: Imitate Jesus andSocrates.These make pretty good - basicprinciples for the reconstruction ofwhich so much is said and so littledone. There can be solid nationalreconstruction only on a strongfoundation of individual self-disciplineand responsibility.If Franklin were alive to-day hewould be a strong advocate for theTreasury Savings Certificates, WarSavings Stamps and Thrift Stamps.He would continue to be actuated by (thrift and patriotism.oDonlt hide your light under abushel under theimpression thatyou are saving, yourselfa pack ofBIG MIMES "HOGGING" WHTTEPAPER SUPPLY.Until within recent years newspapers never quit they just passedon from one owner to another. Butnow publishers fail in business, justlike other business men. Publishinghas become a mat Ler of first importance in the nation, and likewise itshazards have increased. The timehas passed when you can take a dullboy and "make ;.:i editor outen ofhim," as the poet Will Calrton, putit. Twenty-five hundred newspapershave suspended publication sinceJuly, 1918, but still the PostofficeDepartment cries savagely for higherrates for second-class mail matter.They lay their deficits at the door ofthe publisher, and even try shiftingsome $58,000,000 annual loss in therural free delivery service to thenewspapers.It would be a pleasure to reporttliat there was a prospect that thegovernment would limit the size ofthe big city papers. The excess fatthat cannot be classified as "news"in Sunday editions consumes enoughwhite print paper to provide thouands of small weeklies and dailies.But the government is not likely tointercede, and meanwhile the bigpublisers with their cinch on thewhite print paper supply are the bigfish in the pond, whose greedinesshas jumped the price of print paperout of sight. Evidently the biggerthe publishers the less their worryabout the white print paper condition. THE BEST LAXATIVE."My sedentary habits have necessitated the use of an occasional laxative.

Do you know that the demand for export and the increased consumption of "Bright Leaf" forcedunusually high prices and really FORCED the market above what itwould have been under normal export and ordinary increase? Youknow that every abnormal market must react. Well that's history andpart of it caused by the late war, but it all has to do with our question, "WHAT'S YOUR FARM WORTH?" If tobacco prices hold up,farm lands in Kentucky will continue to hold up. If the bright leafmarket is lost by the 'destruction of cigarettes, farm lands will godown with falling' prices. One farmer was bemoaning the increase inhis land tax. He seemed to forget that land he bought for $125.00 anacre now commands $450.00. We can't keep it all. Even Uncle Sdffiwants his share. So if our land is valued at two or three times whatwe paid for it, we must pay higher taxes. That is settled. Now whatwill your farm land be worth if you cannot raise tobacco? Somefolks are mighty busy already against tobacco, and we suggest that ifyou do not know what is going on, that you 'write the ALLIED TOBACCO LEAGUE OF AMERICA, Pickering Building, Cincinnati, O.

The up-to-datefainer knows whether hisfarm is a business success or just aplace to exist. They have appliedsystem to their work. There aremany evidences that th.e church ofto-day has become dissatisfied withthe old happy-go-lucky ways of doing its work. That the church isapplying business sense to its service for God and humanity. One ofthese evidences of progress in theciiUich is the "Every Member Canvass" program which the Southern.Pre&byterian church is staging. ItjlS a sySWiianc canvassing ui. uveijrmember of the church to solicit tneirinterest in the work of the churchand their gifts to the church. Itspolicy is that no widow is too poorto want to give her mite. And thatthe rich man have the privilegeof giving as the Lord has prosperedhim. The church is of and for thehighest and the lowest, the youngest and the oldest, roch and poor,"banker and the laborer, and each hasthe right to demand, and the privilege of taking an interest in itswork, of benefitting from its Ministry, and of helping in all of itscauses.
