etery. The Millersburg County High
School Agricultural Fair, held on
Friday, was a success in every way.
The exhibition was held in the
buildings and on the grounds of the
High School. The fair was not
widely advertised, but there were
visitors from many parts of the
State, attracted by the novelty of
the enterprise. The exhibit in the
. .gymnasium building would have
been creditable to the Bluegrass or
State Fair. Displayed on tables and
hung on stretched lines about the
main floor were a countless profus
ion of articles, whicn no other coun
ty in the State can excell old Bour
bon in producing. There were cab
bage, turnips, sweet potatoes, Irish
potatoes, peppers, kershaws, pump
kins, eggs, pickles, onions, popcorn,
eld corn, lightbread, beaten bis
cuit, pies, jellies, cakes, candy,
, cheese, butter, fancy work of every
. discription, embroidered coverlets,
rag carpets, knitted work and scores
of other articles.
The exhibit was divided into two
classes the members of the Junior
Agricultural Club, which is the only
one in the county, and which holds
a charter from the University of
'Kentucky, having its exhibit on one
:side of the room. The other side
was occupied by exhibits of the
--open class. In another part of the
; grounds was held the live stock ex
hibits, composed of swine, sheep,
chickens and ducks. Following the
awarding of the premiums, and at a
" late hour in the evening, all the per
ishable stuff and farm products,
which had been presented to the fair
"by the exhibitors, were auctioned
off, the receipts going into the
treasury of the Fair. Music was
furnished by the Boys' Band from
the Greendale Reformatory, of 22
pieces, who also gave an interesting
drill exhibition.
Probably the most interesting ex
hibit at the Fair was that of "Ye
Oiae Tyme Antiques," displayed in
the music room of the main build
ing, in charge of -the following com
mittee: Miss Nannie Clarke, chair
man; Misses Hazel Kerr, Flora Jor
dan, Elizabeth Rice, Jessie Crisp,

Frank C. Bedford, all members of

"Friends in this city were advised
Thursday by telegram of the mar

his intention.

E. A. Robnson & Co., cigar manu
facturers, and was for several years
connected with the Liggett & Myers

"The announcement made in
Augusta, Georgia, by Mr. and
Mrs. Landon Thomas, of the engage

here, has been a frequent guest in
the home of her aunts, the Misses
Emily and Anne Thomas. Mr. Clay
is not a stranger in the social life
of this city among the younger set,
his name having been enrolled on
the invitations lists of all functions.
He is a son of the late Cassius M.
Clay, a member of the State Con

who, with his mother and brother,
is among the largest land owners
