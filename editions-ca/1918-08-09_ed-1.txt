He himself accounted forseven members of the machine gunners. He further stated that it washis intention to have the capturedgun shipped to this city, as a presentto Judge Batterton. The letter waswritten evidently a short time beforethe battle in which he was wounded.Soon after the declaration of astate of war existing between theUnited States and Germany, Mr. Batterton, who is still under the legalage, enlisted in the service of thethe United States, and was sent tothe naval training station at ParisIsland, South Carolina. There he-soon obtained, recognition as an expert marksman, and won a ,goldmedal in a competitive rifle shoptingcontest in which the best marksmenof the Marines were engaged. Whenthe first detachment of the American"Expeditionary Force was sent overseas young" Batterton was among thefirst to be selected, especially for hisknown and proven qualifications as amarksman. Arrived in France he wasat once given special nuty as"sniper," with the result that therewas a number of sudden deaths inthe ranks of German sharpshooters,due to Batterton's unerring aim. Inletter to his father, Mr. B. A. Batterton. of near Shawhan, and' to his"brother, Judge George Battejrtqn, Jie"statea in a moaest way nis acnieyements, writing of the numerous engagements he had participated in,and saying that as all is fair in war,he had accounted for a large numberof Germans, who would never be ableto answer the roll-call again.Further particulars are being anxiously awaited by Mr. Batterton's relatives as to the extent of his injuries,in the hope that they may be slight,and that he will soon be back on thefiring line again.IS ssSWELL UNIFORMS.TWENTY DRAFTEES LEAVEPARIS FOR FT.

From this time forward theincreasing output of vessels will notmerely offset the naval efforts ofGermany, but will steadily make upthe deficiency in world tonnage.Nearly 400 persons were overcomeby the heat in the great crowd. Theywere treated at emergency stations,and 175 of them were removed tothe yard hospital. All but 40 wereallowed to go home after receivingadditional treatment.The Quisconck is the first ship tobe launched from the great HogIsland Shipyard and the occasion wasmade worthy of the "epoch in thenation's history,?'" wHich ChairmanHurley, of the Shipping Board, declared is marked. The men who builtthe ship and the men who directedthe work, mingled in comradely spiritvrith Government officials, while thepresence of the Chief Executive andhis family was the source of unending enthusiasm."That's fine," the President exclaimed to Mrs. Wilson, as his eyecwept over the gigantic ship manufacturing plant, the 30,000 employesof the yard and many other thousandsof spectators.Hardly had the President and Mrs.Wilson arrived at the christeningstand than a huge basket of pinkroses was presented to the President's wife. The bearer was WilliamMcMillen, the man who drove thefirst rivet in the Quistconck. Mrs.Wilson dropped her bouquet oforchids to take some of the gorgeouspink blossoms, then grasped both ofMcMillen's hands to thank him forthe gift. He replied that the yardemployees were grateful for hercoming, which he declared was areal service, inspiring them to freshefforts."My services are nothing comparedto yours," she answered quickly.American-made champagne wasused for the christening. Mrs. Wilson was shown how to handle theberibboned bottle, the Presidentlaughing merrily as she practiced theblow in pantomime."Do it right, now," he cautionedher.When the blocks were knockedKentucky State FairLouisville - September 9-14SEPTEMBER 8GRAND SUNDAY PRELIMINARY PROGRAMThaviu' Band of 4C World Frniod SoloistsChorus of 300 VoletsTwo Flights by Ruth Lawt780O00 Total Premium f7,p00.0016,000.00 BMf Cattle Show Saddle Horee trnke $10,00000fKMBO-00..'

Catarrhaldeafness is caused by an inflamedcondition of the mucous lining of theEustachian Tube. When this tubeis inflamed you have a rumblingsound or imperfect hearing:, andwhen it is entirely closed, deafnessis the result. Unless the inflammation can be reduced and this tube restored to its normal condition, hearing will be destroyed forever. Manycases of deafness are caused by catarrh, which is an inflamed conditionof the mucous surfaces. Hall's Catarrh Medicine acts through theblood on the mucous surfaces of thesystem.We will give One Hundred Dollarsfor any case of Catarrhal Deafnessthat cannot be cured by Hall's Catarrh Medicine.

Saturday and Sundaywere sizzlers. The hot wave continued in all its severity until about teno'clock Tuesday night, when a breezewhich sprung up developed into ahigh, wind, accompanied by a brilliant electrical display and a slightrainfall. - The wave diminished somewhat in its intensity, but Wednesdaywitnessed a return of high temperature. High temperature records that havemarked the limits of heat waves during all the period of official observation in the northwestern portion ofthe United Siates were broken Tuesday at Washington and Baltimore,when Weather Bureau thermometers,experienced a temperature of 114 degrees, a point not even approached bythe mercury since 1881, and notreached even then.According to the Weather Bureauofficials, the hot wave owed its existence to an area of low barometricpressure, which has been movinglanguidly from west to east acrossthe continent, staying just a littlenorth bf the normal track and suffering no competition from otherdisturbances in the south. In consequence there was a great and constant flow of the air currents up thecontinent from the south to north,which gathered the accumulated heatthat many days of unbroken sunshinehad left on the mid-continental territory. The wind reached such a high velocity in the near-storm of Tuesdaynight that for a while a tornadoseemed in prospect. No damage wasdone in this city or county.During the storm which prevailedTuesday night lightning struck abarn on the farm of Mr. Ben P. Buckley, near Centerville, killing six fathogs. The barn was slightly damaged. The stock barn on the J. M.Hall farm, on the Greenwich pike,was struck by lightning. The old J.H. Thompson homestead on the samepike was hit by the bolt and set onflre. The blaze was extinguished withlittle property loss. '3 PS 1E3COHTBIBUTOE WANTS TO KNOW" WHY IS WHY" IN PARIS.(Contributed)Why all these empty stores?

This is thefirst time the government ever hasprovided "specs" for the fighters, andis in line with its war policy of making every soldier count for as muchas equipment and preparation willprovide.Formerly there were not many menin the army with defective vision,as good eyesight has been one of thestrictest requirements .for enlistment.With the induction of the NationalArmy, medical officers explained, ,therules were greatly relaxed.1 m mThere are no whiskers on the American army.

For ambush numoses mirboys wttl have to use surrbunding(many's latest ana most formidableattack disposes finally of the assertion, often repeated, that the day ofthe horse in warfare had ended. Evenin the transport service the chargewas never true. Gasoline plays agreat part, but the horse and hisgloomy half brother, the mule, cango where no motor could turn awheel. They are indispensable inwar. Past scores of trucks hopelesslystalled in the mud of Flanders and upthe steep mountains of the Italianfront, horses mules and donkeys haveplodded, dragging artillery or ladenwith food, ammunition and the countless things needed to sustain an army.In the days when cavalry deliveredthe final, crushing ''blow in battle,one horse to four men was considered necessary; 13,0u0'are nowv allottedto a German army corps of 41,000men.To provide these the Prussians encouraged horse breeding in AustriaHungary, and in the ' three monthsbefore the war bought a millionhorses, 300,000 of them from France.,Ureat horse hospitals close behindthe Teuton lines save about one-thirdof the animals injured or strickenwith disease. In spite of this Germany is now able to secure only onehalf of the 450,000 fresh animalsshe requires each year.During the first two years of thewar the Allies imported more than amillion and a half horses, a millionof them from the United States.From the battle of the Marne to November, 1917, 850,000 horses were required to handle the French units;the British used half a million in theirlast offensive.IX!X!GEO.

S.Department Agriculture for theSouthern States met in conference atBirmingham, Ala., on July 18 and19 for the purpose of perfecting plansfor making up the shortage duringthe coming year. The spirit of themeeting was that of service not only for the other fellow but for thelabor agents themselves. More thanone of the government agents haveled groups of volunteer workers inthe wheat harvest and threshing1."With such a spirit evident with theleaders the farmers have beea quickto respond to the appeal for greaterexertion in crop production..In spite of labor shortage crops areclean and in excellent condition.This has been due in large measure tothe fact that farmers realizing thatthey had to get along with reducedjabor forces, have worked harder andmanaged more efficiently than theyhave ever done before. Southern farmers are proving their patriotism inin a very practical fashion. Manywho in the past years have done noactual farm labor are taking the leadin the fields this season. The negropopulation is imbibing the spirit ofpatriotic service. Formerly, in mostsouthern communities colored laborers have done no work on Saturday.This custom is rapidly disappearingand thousands of of negroes are wearing the red-white-and-blue button ofthe Saturday Service League, pledging themselves to work the full sixdays of the week.Men of the towns and cities havegone out by the hundreds to help inthe harvest fields. Farmers forwhom these men have worked havereported excellent satisfaction. Thewi iionin -ot-otto ciinnoccfui ffcia , ,, A .. Si, V t 'farm heh.

Are you celebratingsome foolish holiday?" petulantlyasked a German officer as he marcheda prisoner, along the road to thecage1.One must admit the attack was abit violent. Apologies, perhaps,should be forthcoming. Americanboys are apt to be rough in theirplay.Unfortunately; it is only what Germans may expect from now on. Thefighting aruonti" Chateau Thierrywas nothing unusual for us. Therewas no "foolish holiday" to celebrate,although there will be one later.What the Germans saw was merelythe American style of fighting.It is the only style they know.Untutored in the rules of modernwarfare, they go ahead and maketheir own- rules. These "fresh Americans with their unbroken nerve," asthe Vossische Zeitung now refers tothem, have come over to put an endto the war.They conje from fighting stock,from a country that has never knowndefeat, and doesn't propose to get acquainted with it now. They are notgoing to quit until they march downUnter den Linden. Their individualbravery, their nerve and their ability to shoot straight are the all-compellingfactors. Neither the Germangas sheila nor the German bayonetecan stop them.Germany, in a manner of sneaking, is up against the real thingnow.JULY FAILS; TO JIVE UP TO HSREPUTATION FOR WARMTHThe highest temperature duringJuly was on the fourth, when thethermometer reached 90, and thelowest on the 31st, when the thermometer went down to 55, accordingto the monthly report of WeatherForecaster Wurtz: During the monththere were- 9 cloudy days, 9 partlycloudy, 13 clear and 10 on which itrained.
