Ind., tc identifyrnd recover an automobile alleged tohave been stolen from C. E. Finney,of Paris some time ago. Chief ofPolice Link sent out post card descriptions of the stolen car, and offering a reward for recovery of the machine and the arrest of the thief.Wednesday Sheriff Wm. G. McClintock received a message from officials at Connersville, stating theyhad recovered the car, or at least theone thought to be the Paris car in,the possession of a man whom theywere holding under arrebt. The carand thief will be returned to Paris.The man who is charged with having stolen the Finney auto has beenidentified ,as Robert Hardwick, formerly of Carlisle, who. the police ofConnersville stated, has a police record in that city, and had been undersuspicion for some' time. Suspicionwas aroused some days ago whenHardwick and another man purchased tickets from Connersville toMyers Station, in Nicholas county.They returned a few days later withan automobile and a dog, both alleged to be stolen.One of the cards sent out by Chiefof Police Link came to Sheriff Myers,of Carlisle, who compared it with thedescription he had received from theConnersville authorities and becamesatisfied that Hardwick vas the manwranted. Hardwick was arrested inCarlisle about a month ago on a warrani sent from Connersville charginghim with abandoning his family.SUPPLEMENTAL REGISTRATION-DAYS.NORTE MIDDLETOWN CHILDRENTAKE NOTED JOURNEY(Communicated)WnYS ?f ?,tIy a larSe number ofNorth. Middletown children weretaken on a journey by the MothersClub of Noith. Middletown, a journeywhich they are not likely to soon forget. The historical pilgrimage wasmade to Blue Lick Springs famed inhistory of the State. The party ofcbout two hundred left the schoolgrounds in automobiles early in themorning. Reaching the grounds abountiful dinner was spread near thebanks of the Licking river, on the oldBlue Licks grounds. 'In the afternoon the old battlefield was visited. Mrs. Lafferty toldof the early settlers and their searchfor salt and the buffalo trail whichlater became the Maysville turripike.Mr. Hunter's collection of mastodon,bones, interesting rock -formations,Indian relic , etc., were criticallyexamined. A stop was made at theformer home of Governor "Stonehammer" Metcalfe, where Mrs. Lafferty the State CJub Historian, toldinteresting facts of the life of a Kentucky Governoi, who was once astone mason, "and proud of it." Oneinstance in particular was whereGov. Metcalfe, in 1832 went to Lexington to drive the first spike in thefirst railway built west of AlleghenyMountains. Miss Lizzie Grimes, District Historian, read the excitinghorse race of young Metcalfe, as toldin Collins' History of Kentucky.The party reached home at duskvery tired and dusty, but thoroughly happy and enthused with a ntwinterest in the romantic historicalpast of Kentucky.GOVERNOR C00LIDGE AVOIDSISSUE.On the first day's trip of the Republican Governor's special throughout Kentucky, Governor Calvin Coolidge, of Massachusetts, made fourteen speeches. In none of the fourteen did he refer to the League bfNations. There is a reason. Govrnor Coolidae is tied to the Leagueof Nations by the speech, of welcomehe made to President Wilson whenthe latter returned from France wit-athe Peace Treaty in his pocket.Mr. Coolidge-admitted that he ha?not mentioned the League of Nationssince he had made speech early in th3campaign in Maine. It seems thatthis speaking campaign is not to thetaste of the Massachusetts Governor.He does not associate with the menon the train with him, and seems tofind speech-making a very burdensome task.Don't fail to register Monday,Tuesday or Wednesday of next weekif you were out of the city, sick orSTETSON.

M. Best found it necer.sary to dispose of the M. M. I property; Chey made an attempt to interest local people of Millersburjr in thnpurchasing of this property and the juuuLinuiiuon anu operation of theschool; failing in this they contracted to sell the property to the Bourbon County Board of Education forthe sum of $46,000.Several weeks later a group of citizens of the vicinity of Millersburgmade, an offer to purchase this property from the tJounty Board of Education and offered considerations approximating $60,000 for the propeity. The Board refused this offer.This was followed by a suit in whichit was attempted to enjoin the consummation of the contract betweenthe Board and Col. and M,rs. Best.This action was decided in favor ofthe County Board in the BourbonCircuit Court and by the Court otAppeals of Kentucky. At about thetime of the filing of this suit a portion of the men who were partvplaintiffs to this suit entered into aprivate contract with Col. Best,whereby it was provided that shouldthe courts prevent the sale to theCounty Board that the signers orsaid contract would take over theproperty on the same or similarterms that had been offered by theCounty Board of Education. In otherwords, had the suit been decidedagainst the County Board of Education the county would have lost thedifference between the $60,000 offered for the property prior to thebringing of the suit, and the $40,000 paid for the property.Within the past few weeks we bavtheard statements made that after thecoming election this property wouldbe secured from the County Board ofEducation. At about the same ti(mewe discovered that there was apropaganda among the colored people of Millersburg to the effect thatif the new high school was continued their school would be reduced toa term of six months; later we learned that there was further piopagandaamong the colored people of Millersburg that if they would vote for acertain ticket that their teacherswould receive more pay,' that theywould be given additonal grounds,additional equipment and moreteachersMr. A. T. Moffett is one of the party plaintiffs in the suit against theCounty Board of Education, to prevent the sale of these grounds andbuildings to said Board. It was hewho was most active in organizing aticket for filling the Board at theelection to be held November 2, 192'.He is one of the candidates for theseoffices.Since this new High School habeen established it has been a common expression 'in Millersburg: "Theway to get the M. M. I. propertyback is to fight this school.We regret the bitterness engendered ; we deplore the attempt by partiesunknown to us, to align the interestsof one race against the interests ofthe other. We believe that any person who attempts to arouse the jealousy of one race against the other orof one class against another is an enemy of both races and of bothclasses.It is common belief in Millersburgthat if Mr. Moffett and his selectiorof a ticket secure office that thisproperty will be secured from thecounty. It is unknown as to whatconsideration will be given for thesale of same.We believe that the fair-mindedvoters of Bourbon county will almostunanimously reject a proposition tc.inject directly into the County Boardof Education a fight that has grownM) bitter that when a minister addressed the Teachers' Aassociation 01Bourbon county and endorsed thenew High School in Millersburg, ex1pression was made as follows: "Hehad just as well pack his trunk andleave town." We believe that everyfair-minded person will agree that aninsistent, prospective purchoser ofcounty property places himself in anawkward position when he offershimself as a candidate for membership on a Board that will have thepower to sell the same property. Webelieve such action would never betaken excepting under stress of angerand under the sting of defeat in thecourts.We are glad to state that we ateinformed that at least two of the proposed ticket hae stated they arunacquainted with the conditionsnamed her.ein. and are not in sympathy with'the motives indicated above.Five, men who are not residents ofMillersburg or of the Millersburgschool district have been prevailedupon to offer themselves for membersof the Bourbon County Board of Education, on tne platform, namely:That they will represent as best theymay solely the School children ofBourbon courty in passing upon any.matter that 'lay be brought beforethem. These men are: E. P. Wagoner, C n. White, Ernest Darnaby,CJeorge Link and Dr. H. B. Anderson. In full justice to the men named onthe other ticket it is our belief thatonly a bare majority are expected todo the will of those whe wish to secure the old M. M. I. pioperty for private purposes.(Signed) Ashby Leer, Dr. -Jehu I).Calhoun. Waliice -Shannon, S. C. Bascom, Jr., Ralph BonarW. F.

Makeit a holy covenant crusade to the end.Other issues can wait two years.This has waited twenty centuriessnd if we fail in our duty now Goaalone can measure the cosmiccpec ofrecurrence."can be a Democrat, but I cannot support the Republicans this year," wasMr. Bernneim's statement, and hegave as bis reason the fact that conscience will not permit him to support the "Republican leaders whoh.'tve committed the crime of playingpolicies when an impoverished anastarving world was looking tofor guidance and leadership."In past years Mr. Bernbeim hasbeen a liberal contributor to the Re- jpuuncun campaign iunas. rnis year,however, the G. 0. P. will receive noassistance from himIn his statement announcing hisdefection from the Republican standard Mr. Bernheim says:"Next to my religion comes mydeep attachment to the Republicanparty, but I shall have to forget mypast record and vote this time for tbeDemocratic Presidential standardbearers, solely because my consciencewon't permit (me by my vote to confirm the acts of our Republican leaders, who committed the crime of playing polnics when an impoverishedand starving world was looking to usfor guidance and leadership."I am for the League of Nationsbecause back of it stands the American principle of 'life, liberty and thedowntrodden of every clime."Our people have put their bandsto the plow and we shall -not turnback."oFAMOUS NATURALIST WILL SUPPORT DEMOCRATIC TICKETAUTOMOBILES COMING SOONParis dealers in certain makes ofautomobiles have been informed"again" that they will be able tohave more cars furnished in the nearfuture, owing to the increase incars, and that the early spring wilifind a great relief from the present5 situation. Shipping facilities, how-evei, ars not expected to be greatlyimproved in this regard until afterthe winter months have passed, sincothe stress will be laid on the movingof coal.John Burroughs, the famous naturalist, is supporting the Democraticticket for thiee reasons. First, hebelieves in the League of Nations.Second, because Cox is for thoLeague., and third, "Because Gov.Cox "is a stronger man of the twocandidates, more progressive andmore representative of the idealismof the Nation."Burroughs' position 'is especiallysignificant in view of the fact thathe worked and voted for tbe electionof Abraham Lincoln. In Gov. Cox,Mr. Burroughs sees traits of resemblances to Theodore Roosevelt, particularly in the vigor and fearlessnessof his public utterances, his dynamicqualities and his straight-out ard! unequivocal statements of facts.IT'S SURPRISINGThat So Many Paris People Fail ToRecognize Kidney WeaknessWhen a man is married and carrying life insurance he isn't nearly aswilling to die for his wife as he waswhen they were courting.Hall's Catarrh MedicineThose who are in a "run down" condldon will notice that Catarrh bothersthem much more than when they are ingood health.
