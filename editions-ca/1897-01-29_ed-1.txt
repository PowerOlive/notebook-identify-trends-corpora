the firemen in checking the flamesThe Wanamaker establishment was atone time in flames on the Marketstreet front but a detail of firemenwas quickly put to work in the building and soon checked the progress ofthe fire there The loss by fire andwater to Wanamakers however willamount to considerableThe entire block on the north side ofMarket street from Thirteenth toJuniper and from Market to

flames spread with alarmingrapidity- In a half hour thewhole block of business establishments from Thirteenth toJuniper street and from Market toFilbert was in danger of destructionThe firemen worked heroically buttheir efforts were futile The sprayfrom the streams of water fell overthem and froze and huge icicles wereformed on the walls and roofs of theburning structuresThe wind carried the

younggentleman somewhat surprised herHe sprang from his chair the momentshe entered the room rushed out ofthe door and shrieked at the -top ofhis voice to a boy who answered himwhereupon Wentworth returned to theroom apparently in his right mindI beg your pardon Miss Longworthhe said laughing the fact was I hadjust sent my boy with a telegram toyou and now you see I have savedsixpenceThen you have heard from Canadasaid the young ladytrTes a short message but to thepoint He handed her the cablegramand she read Mine purchased shalltake charge temporarilyThen the money got there in timeshe said handing him back the telegraphic messageOh yes said George with the easy- confidence of a man who doesnt at allknow what he is talking about Wehad plenty of time I knew it would getthere all right1 am glad of that I was afraid perhapsi we might have sent it too lateOne can never tell what delays or formalities there may beEvidently there was no troubleAnd now Misa Longworth what areyoor commands Am I to be yoursigent here in Great BritainHave you written to Mr KenyonYes I wrote him just after I sentthe cable messagecXi course you didnto I didnt say a word that wouldlead him to suspect who was the mistress of the mine Innw zeal I evenwent so far as to give 3ou a nameYou are hereafter to be known in thecorrespondence as Mr Smith the owner of the mineMiss Longworth laughedAnd oh by the way cried Wentworth here is a barrel belonging toyouA barrel she said and looking inthe direction to which he pointed shesaw in a corner of the room a barrelwith its head taken off If it belongsto me continued the young womanwho has taken the liberty of openingitOh I did that as your agent Thebarrel contains the mineral from themine which we hope will prove so valuable It started from Canada overthree months ago and only arrivedhere the other day It seems that theidiot who sent it addressed it in someway by New York and it was held bysome jack in office belonging to theUnited States customs We have hadmore diplomatic correspondence andtrouble about that barrel than you animagine and now it comes a day behind the fair when it is really no useMiss Longworth rose and went to thebarrel She picked out some of theTseautif ul specimens that were in itIs this the mineral she askedWentworth laughed Think of aperson buying a mine at an exorbitantprice and not knowing what it produces Yes that is the mineralThis is not mica of courseNo it is not mica That is the stuffused for the making of chinaIt looks as if it would take a goodpolish Will it do you knowI do not know I could easily findout for youI wish you would and get a piece orit polished which I will use as a paperweightWhat are your orders for the rest 01the barrelWhat were you thinking of doingwith it said the young womanWell I was thinking the best plan-they want to use itI think it is a very good idea Iunderstand from the cablegram thatYes I imagine he left Ottawa atonce as soon as he had concluded hisbargain Of course we shall not knowfor certain until he writes49Sget thingsA -is-rVKvcry well then at seems to me thatthe best thing ypu uoujddoover herewoutdbe tbgefcwhatbrderscaribe obrtabled in England for the mineralThen I suppose you could write to MrKenyon and ask him to get a properperson to operate the mine- YesIwilldo thatWhen he comes over here you andhe can have a consultation as to the bestthing to be done after that I expectnothing very definite can be done untilne comes xou inay inane wiiateverexcuse you can for the absence of themythical Mr Smith and say that youact for him Then you may tell MrKenyon iii whatever manner youchoose that Mr Smith intends bothyou and -Mr Kenyon to share conjointlywith him I think you will have notrouble in making John that is inmaking Mr Kenyon believe there issuch a person as Mr Smith if you putit strongly enough to him Make himunderstand that Mr Smith would neverhave heard of the mine unless Mr Kenyon and you had discovered it and thathe is very glad indeed to have such agood opportunity of investing hismoney so that naturally he wishesthose who have been instrumental inhelping him to this investment to sharein its profit I think you could makeall this clear enough so that your friendwill suspect nothing Dont you thinksoWell wjth any other man than JohnKenyon I should have my doubts because as a fabricator I dont think Ihave a very high reputation but with 4John I have no fears whatever Hewill believe everything I say It isalmost a - pity to cheat so trustful aman but its so very much for his owngood that I shall have no hesitation indoing itThen you will write to him aboutgetting a fit and proper person to manage the mineYes I dont think there will beany necessity for doing so but I willmake sure I imagine John will hotleave there until he sees everything tohis satisfaction He will be very anxious indeed for the -mine to -prove asgreat a success as he believes it willbe even though at present he does notknow that he Js to have any pecuniaryinterest in its prosperity -Very well then I will bid you goodby I may not be here again butwhenever you hear from Mr Kenyon Ishall be very glad if you will let meknowCertainly I will let you knoweverything that happens I will sendIts very good of you said Edithyou all the documents in the case asyou once remarked You always liketo see the original papers dont youYes I suppose I do Miss Longworth lingered a moment at the doorthen looking straight at Wentworthshe said to himYou remember you spoke ratherbitterly to my father the other dayYes said Wentworth coloring Iremember itYou are a young man he is oldBesides I think you were entirely inthe wrong He had nothing whatever to do with what his nephew haddoneOh I know that said WentworthI would have apologized to him longago only well you know he told hieI shouldnt be allowed in the officeagain and I dont suppose I shouldA letter from you would be allowedin the office replied the young ladylooking at the floorOf course it would said GeorgeI will write to him at once and apologizeIt is very good of you said Edithholding out her hand to him and thenext moment she was goneGeorge Wentworth turned to his deskand wrote a letter of apology ThnLe mused to himself upon the strangeincomprehensible nature of wxinenShe makes me apologize to him andquite right too but if it hadnt beenfor ihe row with her father she neverwould have heard about the transaction and therefore couldnt havebought the mine which she was anxiousto do for Kenyons sake lucky beggarJohn is after allCHAPTER XXVIAfter the business of transferringthe mine to its new owner was completed John Kenyon went to the telegraph office and sent a short cablemessage to Wentworth Then heturned his steps to the hotel an utteriy exhausted man The excitement andtension of the day had been too muchfor him and he felt that if he did notget out of the city of Ottawa and intothe country where there were fewerpeople and more air he was going tobe ill He resolved to leave for themine as soon as possible There hewouldin as good order aswould be to send some of it to each or J possible and keep things going untilthe pottery works in this country and he heard from the owner When heget their orders for more of the stuffif I got to his hotel he wrote to Wentworth telling the circumstances underwhich he secured the mine ratherbriefly and dealing with other moreMr Kenyon says he will take charge of V personal matters Having posted this-the mine temporarily he began to pack his portmanteau preparatory to leaving early next morn-mg While thus occupied the bell boycame to his room and said There isa gentleman wishes to see 3rouV--ifm-- VJh--He imagined at once that it was VouBrent- who wished to see him with re-transfer and he was therefore verymuch astonished in fact iov a momentspeechless to see Mr William Longworth enter and calmly gaze round therather shabby room with hij criticaleyeglassAh he said these are your diggings are they This is what they calla dollar hotel I suppose over hereWell some people may like it but Iconfess I dpnt care much about it myself Their three orhotels are bad enough for me By theway you look rather surprisedto seeme Being strangers together in astrange country I expected a warmergreeting You said last night in frontof the Russell house that it wouldplease you very much to give me awarm greeting perhaps you would liketo do so to nightHave you come up here to provoke a quarrel with me asked KenyonOh bless you ho Quarrel Nothring of the soft What would I wantto quarrel aboutPerhaps you vill be good enough totell me why you came here thenVery reasonable request verysonable indeed and perfectly natural-but still quite unnecessary It is notlikely that a man would climb up hereinto your rdoni and then not be prepared to tell you why he came in thefirst place to congratulate you on thebeautiful and dramatic way in whichyou secured the mine at the last moment or apparently at the last moment I suppose you had the moneyall alongNo I had notThen you came in to Von Brent justas soon as you received itWell now I dont see that it is thebusiness of anyone else but myselfStill if you want to know I have no objection to saying that I came to MrVon Brents room at the- moment I received the moneyReally Then it was sent over bycable I presumeYour presumption is entirely correctMy dear Kenyon said the youngman seating himself without beingasked and gazing at John in a benevolent land of way you really show somelittle temper over this affair of oursNow here is the whole thing -in a nutshell I wMy dear sir I dont wish to hear thewhole thing in a nutshell I know allabout it All I wish to knowAh precisely of course you docertainly but nevertheless let me havemy say Here is the whole thing Itried to well to cheat you I thought1 could make a little money by doing soand my scheme failed Now if anybody should be in a bad temper it is Inot you Dont you see that You arenot acting your part well at all Imastonished at you - --Mr Longworth I wish to have no thing whatever to say to you H youhave anything to ask I wish you wouldask it as quickly as possible and thenleave me aloneThe chief fault I find with you Kenyon said Longworth throwing one legover the other and clasping his handsaround his knee the chief fault I haveto find is your painful lack of a sense ofhumor Now you remember last nightI offered you the managership 5f themine I thought certainly that by thistime to day I should be the owner of itor at least one of the owners Nowyou dont appear to appreciate thef unniness of the situation Here youare the owner of the mine and I am outin the cold left as they say here inAmerica I am the man who isleftIf that is all you have to talk aboutsaid Kenyon gravely I must ask youtb allow me to go on with my packingI am going to the mine to morrowCertainly my dear fellow go atonce and never mind me Can I be ofany assistance to you It requires aspecial genius you know to pack aportmanteau properly But what Iwanted to say was this why didnt youturn around when you had got themine and oftjer me the managership ofit Then you could have had yourrevenge The more I think of thatepisode in Von Brenbs office the moreI think you utterly failed to realize thedramatic possibilities of the situationKenyon was silentNow all this time you are wonderingwhy I came here Doubtless you wishto know what I wantXI have not the slightest interest inthe matter said KenyonThat is ungracious but neverthelessI will continue It is better I see to behonest with you if a person wants toget anything out of you Now I want toget a bit of information out of you Iwant to know where you got the moneywith which you bought the mineI got it from the bahkAh yes but I want to know -whosent it over to youIt was sent to me by George WentworthQuite so but now I want to knowwho gave Wentworth the moneyYou vvill have a chance of findingthat out when you go to England byasking himThen you wont tell meI cant tell youYou mean by that of course thatyou wont1 always mean Mr Longworth exactly what I say I mean that I canttell you I dont know mvselfReallyYes really You seem to have somedifficulty in believing that anybody canspeak the truthWell it isnt a common vice speaking the truth You must forgive a littlesurprise He nursed his knee for amoment and looked meditatively up atthe ceiling Now would you like toknow who furnished that moneyI have no curiosity in the matterwhateverVHave you not Well you area singular man It seems to me that a personinto whose lap 20000 drops from theitfimrskies would have some little curiosityto know from whom the aineIJiavent the

tor the affair It was a prettysharp trick of Melvilles and I give himcredit for it He is very much shrewderand cleverer than I thoughtIt seems to me Mr Longworth thatyour inordinate conceit makes you

to do mea favor in this matter I thought youmight have no objection to writing alittle document to the effect that themoney did not come in time and consequently I had secured the mineThen if you

the people one meetsNot only does this desire show itself asan incident of the present political inrterest and excitement but every association no matter for what purposeseems disposed to distinguish itself bysome kind of button medal badge orribbon This is easily noticeable atWashington among the hundreds of excursions of societies schools permanent organizations and clubs that dnring the year go there to see the capitalof the nationIt would appear from this that themilitary spirit of our people that for anumber of years has induced our youngmen to voluntarily snbmit to somewhat of the hardships of military education is growing less as the periodof peace grows longer while at thesame time fondness for display is increasingBut in truth there is a reason beneathall this for the falling off of interest inmilitary instructionin civil schools Thepomp and circumstance of war are veryattractive But our youth have learnedenough under tuition of regular armyinstructors to discover that the work ofpreparation is extremely arduous andrestrictive of other paths of pleasureand entertainment perhaps quite asprofitable in the walks of life they aredestined to followThe fact long

of the bodyand that the threads are nothingmore or less than a white sticky fluidwhich hardens as soon as it comes incontact with the air The spider doesnot really and truly spin but beginsa thread by

SHEEPAdvantages Accruing to- f lie farmer Who-Possesses a FlJpclc p iWithin the past ten earl sheep haVebeen defended and -attacked froni allluuxums strong ueienuurs uuupersistent enemies owing- to the agitation of the wool question in politics butcsvjng put of consideration the quesfion oi wool as asoutce of profit theref atreother advantages in -Keeping sneejwhich are admitted by all If a farmeronly sold his sheep at their actual costhe would derive a profit There is butlittle risk in sheep except from diseaseor enemies as they give a profit fromreveral sources The first advantagepossessed by the farmer who has aflock of sheep is the utilization of wastepioducts Sheep wilL consume muchthat other animals wSlhnofc accept andwilLkeep down weeds thus saving laborYto the farmer who Imslfhis fields overrun by wreeds from seeds which are eartied by wTinds to his cultivated fieldsSheep are contented on scanty pasturepreferring the short grass to that whichi long and by grazingivery close theycompletely destroy the weeds that wouldotherwise start again A large portionof their food really costs the farmernothing during the summer and withshelter from storm they are less liableto disease than other animals If thelambs come early and are sired by purebred rams of the mutton breeds theywill more than pay the cost of the flockof sheep the first year The farmer whokeeps sheep for wool only will continueto turn his sheep out and meet withf losses but the one who aims to make aprofit from ali sources provided by theflock will use precautions for safetyShelter from the sun in summer andfrom the storms in winter assist inmaking sheep pay and if they havebeen given something more than thepickings of the farm they will be ingood condition in the fall to begin thewinter A flock can be kept at but little expense as sheep will utilize turnips ensilage fodder hay and be satisfied with a small allowance of grainFarmers who will begin with goodsheep and use pure bred rams can always secure a fair profit but the profitleft in the soil from the droppings isone of the most important items as thesheep save the f armer the labor of hauling manure and apply the droppingsto the soil better than he can with hismost approved appliances Philadelphia RecordDEMAND FOR HORSESOne Wlio Ought to Know Sajs It Is asUrisk as EverCol Ed Butler is authority for thestatement that there are more horsesin St Louis now than there ever havebeen in the entire history of the cityAccording to his figures there are anywhere from 20 to 30 per cent more nowthan there were during the palmiestdays of the horse car or before the bikecame into useI am better prepared to know howmany horses there are in the city thanany other man living here The reasonis that I catch them coming and goingI shoe them while they are living andhaul them off when they are deadI know that the average citizen belives that the advent of the trolley carand the bicycle dispensed with the useof horses almost entirely but this isnot the case The bicycle dude and thetrolley car patron never owned horsesThe only horses the trolley car knockedout were the plugs that nobody wouldcare to own and there were not half asinany of them as is generalty supposedGood horses are as hard to get nowas they ever were and probably harderfor the reason that not so many of themare being bred You cant hire a rigat a livery stable any cheaper now thanyou could ten years ago and if youdrive out you will find more rigs onthe- streets than there were ten yearsago The trolley car has killed themarket for scrub horses and they arecheaper but a scrub horse is not cheapat any figure I have been trying to geta first class team for three years andam willing to pay any kind of a pricefor them but I have

EepublicIt Does Xot Pay to Feed Inferior Stockot Any KindScrub stock may be a luxury enjojTedby some farmers who refuse or neglectto breed to pure bred sires as a uselessfolly only for book farmers and experiment stations but we see an excellentobject lesson in the Live Stock Reportreferring to feeding stock in times ofdepression It shows the necessity ofboycotting the scrub and selecting goodgrades to feed which was never moreimportant than now and this shoulddrive the scrub stock from the Americanfarms and induce farmers who thinkread and care for their own prosperityto breed only pure bred or high gradestock that will return a fair profit forthe feed given them The Report saysFeeders are obliged to invest cautiously If ever there was a time whenthe feeding of inferior stock should beavoided it is now and in placing f heircattle in the feed lots we strongly advise feeders to select only such stockas can be safely depended upon to makegood use of the -feed given it anil returnfair profits for the time labor andmoney expended in fitting it for marketStock cattle are high in value it is truewhen compared with fat cattle pricesThis is because supplies are lightthat is good ones But it is usuallybetter in the end to pay well for a goodarticle rather than take a poor one because it is cheap and even if we are tohave low prices again next year as a result of the

OtherShe sat by the car window gazingout upon the unrolling scenery and possibly dreaming of home and things likethat iAbout six feet away from her acrossthe aisle was an empty seat which atthe next station was filled by a manwith a sample case He was 50 years ofage or thereabout and was quite asper looking as if he were 30 and stillthe knight to please every fair damewho set her soft eyes upon himThe lady was young and pretty withperhaps a shade too much display in hermakeup but still one could hardly saythat for all is not gold that glitters insuch cases or words to that effectWhen the man had sat down in thevacant seat and composed himself forthe journey before him he began to lookabout to familiarize himself with hisenvironments and in the course of hisvisnal wanderings his eyes fell upon theyoung lady He gave a slight start aspeople do when they think they seesomebody they know and looked againThe lady wasnt looking of courseBnt she wasnt asleepNot in the slightestAfter a minute or two or three orfour of hesitating investigation the traveling man for it was he arose and verypolitely and deferentially approachedthe young ladyIt was done as if be had been practicing that sort of thing ever since he hadpicked up the first sample case Eitherthat or he was to the manner bornI beg your pardon he said as sheturned from the window to meet himwith a half startled fawnlike movement not altogether unusual on suchoccasions arent you Miss Morton ofPhiladelphiaShe gave him a glassy stare with araw edge on itYou dont look like a man she replied with an insolent air who wouldtry to work as old a racket as that onme Do I look so green as thatIt was now his turn to gaze at her instartled wonderOh thats all right she laughedmoving overdo make room beside herand Ill forgive you You know I amnot Miss Morton of Philadelphia or anywhere else and so do I know it Butsit down Im lonesome and Id just assoon have a pleasant little talk with youas not Im to meet mamma at the station where we take dinnerI beg your pardon said the travel-ting man backing away 1 am sure ifyou are not Miss Morton I have no desire whatever to talk with youThen he went back to his place andthe flip young woman was rather inclined to the opinion tat there was atleast one man on the road who could bemistaken honestlyAll of which occurred between Washington and New York within the lasttwo weeks Washington StarSome of the Methods Used to Get Kid ofthe PestsWhole families of the animals aresometimes asphyxiated in their densA wolf of the gray variety generallymakes its home by getting on the sideof a dirt gulchand burrowing straightinward until a safe distance from thesurface is reached There her young areborn and raised to sturdy cub estateWhen a cowboy locates a den inwhich he believes the entire family tobe gathered a composite mass of cottonsaturated with damp flour sulphur andoter noxious smelling substances isthrust into the den and set on fire Themouth of the hole is then filled withclay tamped down solidly and the imprisoned wolves are speedily suffocatedwithin In this way from 6 to 10 and11 wolves young and old are wipedout at one strokeAnother effective method is to borefour or more holes in a flat piece ofboard and plug them up with beef fatsoaked in strychnine The odor of thefat attracts any wolves that may be inthe vicinity and they lick the fat voraciously until the leavening of poisondoes its work upon them and they dropdead Very often as many as a dozenwolves are killed off by this process before the fat in the holes is exhaustedStrychnine inclosed in capsules is alsoused The capsule is thrust into a slitcut in a chunk of beef and the wolfbolting the meat whole falls an easyvictim Steel traps baited with rawbeef are also tried with fair successDenver RepublicanHeading Women OrganizeThe women voters of Reading Pamet recently at the home of Mrs William Carter Woburn street and formedan organization Mrs S G B
