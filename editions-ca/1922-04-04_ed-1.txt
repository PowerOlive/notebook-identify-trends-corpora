After securingthis they "soaped" the big safe withnitro-glycerine and "dope," but wereunable to force an entrance as thecharge did not explode. It waspresumed the burglars became alarmed at the long delay in the expectedexplosion, and left without takingthe trouble to undo their work.Hearing a noise in the store- acolored man and his wife went thereand as they appeared on the scenethey were held up at the point ofa revolver in the hands of a maskedman, while two others were workingon the safe. They were compelledto remain until the men took theirdeparture. They then gave thealarm. About four o'clock thatmorning four men in an automobilewere seen leaving the vicinity, going in the direction of Paris. It wasthought they carried a large amountof goods from the store, but thethe amount was not learned untillater.

That, Whereas, Clean-Up WeeksIn compliance with the requestfor a definite date for Clean-Up andP,ain-ITp-Week for Paris, Mayor E.B. January has issued the followingofficial proclamation to the citizensof "Paris, in the interest of- theclean-up campaign, for the week ofApril 10-15:"Know all men by these, presentsThat I, E. B.

Aprilthat afford his property protection; that no citizen however rich or poorshould be favored in any manner and that the law should treat' alike theproperty of every citizen of the Commonwealth.Favoritism In The Present LawThe law now in force, which was enacted in 1917, grants exemptionsor favors to certain classes of tax payers. Those especially favored arethe manufacturers, who are not required to pay taxes on the machineryand stocks in storage, for the support of the county and municipal governments. The county and city tax is the bulk of the public tax. Thecounty and city to require more money than does the State. Therefore,manufacturing concerns are exempt under the present law from the hulkof the public tax. Other properties exempted underer the present lawhave resulted in many advantages tothe city and community in safe-UoO,000 children in Europe who areguarding health, promoting thrift,m furthering of fire prevention, instimulating civic pride, and in making home and city more beautiful.Now, therefore,"Be it known, That plans havebeen perfected for a thorough cleanup of our city, and I now proclaimand designate the week beginning:are bonds, notes, credits and all intangible properties. These properties, I Monday, April 10, -and ending Satur-.35 Reduction :05.40 As Now Taxed.40 As Now Taxedincluding manufacturing plants, pay nothing to the support of the countyand city governments, including local schools, bond issues and improvements. The fact that so much property is now exenipt from taxation andthe bulk of the local tax is being paid by real estate, we felt that theburden was not being properly distributed real estate bearing an unjustproportion of the public taxes. . There is no precedent for this law inother States, and my contention for this correction was supported hyeconomists of the present day, who urge that all property should betaxed by the government which affords it protection. NThe Proposed Tax Measure.In order to bring about a better equalization of the public burden,we proposed a classification tax jneasure with the following rates:State Tax RatesProposed rate on real estate 30 centsAmended in the Senate to. . iProposed rate on mineral rights and mineral leaseProposed rate on agricultural prcTducts. . . .Miscellaneous tangible property . 40 As Now TaxedIntangible personal property 30 Reduction .10Bank deposits 10 As Now TaxedIn addition to the State rate on the properties enumerated the counties, and municipalities are authorized to tax realty, minerals, tangible andintangible properties for local purposes, provided, the rate for county andmunicipal purposes on agricultural products shall not exceed the sum of30 cents for the purposes of each, and provided the rate on live stock andintangible personal property for county and municipal purposes shall notexceed the sum of 15 cents for the purposes of each.ii i, tpri that the proposed measure taxes manufacturer's.....

"I cannotconceiVe of : manufacturer's machinery and farm machinery as other thansubjlcls for local taxation." A. E. Holcomb, Secretary National Tax Association.) Result of The JRoposed ClassificationThe proposed measure would increase the county and city revenuesone million five hundred and ninety-four thousand nine hundred andninety-five dollars and sixty-four cents annually ($l,594,095.64h Ofthe amount thus gained by the counties the item of farm machinery wouldcontribute only a small part. Practically all this revenue .would be contributed by manufacturing concerns and intangible properties. Thus itwill be seen that the increase in taxes would fall on the now exemptedproperties of the wealthier tax payers of the State. Like properties paythe same or more tax in practically every State m the Union.Reduction In The Farmers' TaxThe proposed measure would decrease the taxes on farm . ,..,landsannually ,. ?J70, 971.55,., i . fQi Pmmtv and State tax on livewouiu uewc u. 385,147.31ernlr n T Till all Vaay, April 15, as Clean-Up andPaint-Up Week in the city of Paris.This is to mark the opening of areal campaign for persistent andconstructive effort in our city inI cleaning up and keeping it cleaned.'I urge all citizens to have 'alltrash and rubbish, such as ashes, tincans, and all other forms of rubbish,(but no wood, papers or limbs willbe hauled) placed on the streets onMonday and Tuesday, April 10 and11, as the city wagons will startearly Wednesday morning, April 12,and continue their rounds until allthe rubbish has been hauled away.The wagons will not return for anyrubbish or trash not placed on thestreets by early Wednesday morning, April 12."I further urge every citizen ofParis to do his of her part in helping to make our city healthy andbeautiful."Done in the City of Paris, Ky.,April 3, 1922.E.

Like most communities in this latitude the firstdays of spring find it presenting itsmost unlovely appearance. Fortunately, however, the desire of decency-lovingpeople to clean up andpaint up becomes an urge and a passion as the verdure appears.For the last four years the folkswho are not impelled by pride todo what they ought to do, have hadtheir premises brought to their attention through Boy Scouts. Themembers of this organization firstclean up their own premises beforegoing out to criticise their neighborsThe Scouts plans are made for usualspring survey, and will be visitingback yards and alleys shortly.The boys will report on dilapidated fences and outbuildings thatshould be removed. Scores of oldstructures ought to be serving a useful purpose in the form of kindlingwood. The need of paint is left foreach property owner to decide forhimself. But it has sometimesseemed that Paris needed paint moreand got less of it than any city inthe country. "PORTY-ITVE IN 1922 P. H.

It comes from the manufacturer and the owner of intangible property. No farmer who understands the effect and purpose ofthis measure will offer a word of protest. If there is a criticism of theproposed measure, it should be on account of the apparent favoring of thefarmer's property. The classification of live stock in the proposed measure is the same as that of intangible property, the one will equalize andjustify the other.The proposed tax rate on farm products is just. The protest purporting to come- from farm organizations on account ofc the slight increasein the tax .on farm products is a subterfuge of the' manufacturer, an attempt to prejudice farmers against the proposed measure. Farming is myoccupation and source of livelihood, and I would not inflict a penalty onthat business. The hypocrisy of the manufacturer is exposed, when weconsider the provision of the law enacted in 1917, by which the manufacturer secured for himself a tax rate of 40 cents on farm products andgave to the farmer (including municipal tax) a rate of more than ?2.004on the same property. The act of 1920 retained the rate of 40 cents onfarm products to the manufacturer and fixed on the same property to thefarmer (including municipal tax) a rate of 70 cents. The tax on farmproducts is rarely paid by the farmer. This property passing to the manufacturer before the taxing period which is the year following the production of such crops the Constitution exempting farm products the yearin which they are grown.Attitude Of' The PressThe city, newspapers disapproved the proposed tax measure. The attitude of the publishers is explained by the fact that they claimed exemptions under the Act of 1917. They escaped taxation for a time ontheir machinery and stocks, but the courts recently decided that publishers were not manufacturers, no more so than "peanut roasters, vendors ofpop corn, the baker, the tailor, the carpenter, the stone cutter and a vastnumber of others who could claim "exemptions, if the literal definition ofthe term should be applied."The recent Legislature, however, - enacted a law classifying publishers as manufacturers. They will now be exempt under the 1917 law,IS!! .ud-.tlle Proposed tax measure they would be required to pay aswx .uuuBuirapay taxes, m support of the local government.

The love for theplace and his neighbors which dismisses the thought of self interest orpolicy and resolves itself into theknowledge 'of duty when he does allin his power to make the city a hetter place in which to live.There are three distinct attitudeswhich a citizen may assume towardthe place in which he Jives, wfiichfurnishes him food, shelter and association for himself and family, toboost, to remain quiet or toknock.The booster is that ideal citizen whois never forgetful of the obligationwhich is due the home city. He isever found at the front when anymovement is launched which mighttend to the advancement of the interest of the city. While others seedarkly, to him good is visible at alltimes.

The detailsare under discussion by a committeerepresenting all lines of businesswhich -benefit most from a styleshow and will be completed possibly the first of the week.As present contemplated it is thepian of the committee to arrangethe style show to be held in connection with the American Legionmusical revue, "Fads and Fancies"o"f 1922," on the nights of April 5and 6.
