GlowersmWith a view of equipping the ParisFire Department with modern facilities for fighting fires equal if not better than, any in the State of Kentucky Mayor J. T. Hinton last night atthe regular meeting of the City Council advocated the purchase of an automobile fire apparatus to replace thatnow in use and it is probable that thecity will at an early date purchase anentirely new outfit for use in the department. Another matter of the utmost importance brought up by before theCouncil by Mayor Hinton, was the necessity of a new paving for Mainstreet, the present thoroughfare beingin such condition as to render itunfit for travel.Mayor Hinton stated to the Council, that after concidering the mattervery carefully he had reached the decision that modern fire apparatus wasgreatly needed in this city, inorder toafford protection to outlying districtswhich during the past fewyears have grown to such a considerable extent and that the departmentshould be in a position to reach theoutskirts as quickly as possible. Thepresent equipment drawn by horses,that are hardly equal to the task ofgoing the distance from one end of thecity to the other, should be replacedwith an automobile, which would enable the firemen to reach the sceneof a fire in almost any part of thecity in less than one-half the time itnow requires. Mayor Hinton statedthat he had been in communicacation with a number of fire automobile manufacturers in regard to thepurchase of a machine for this purpose and asked "the consent of thecouncil to proceed with the investigation and make a report at the nextmeeting of the body. The council wasunanimons in its consent and there isa probability that at the next meeting the purchase of a machine will beordered by the board. It is also understood that in event of the purhcase men in addition to those nowregular men in addition to those nowemployed will be added to the department. Regarding the reconstruction ofMain street, Mayor Hinton said thathe had received several letters fromthe general mauager of the construction firm now engaged in building thestreets in Lexington urging thecity officials to come to Lexington atan early date and inspect the streetthat are being put down in that city.The Council ordered that the Mayorin connection with the ImprovementCommitte of the Council make avisit to Lexington for the purpose ofinspecting the paving and to make areport to the Board at the next meeting when the matter will be given fullconsideration which will probably result in immediate action.Seven building permits were granted and a petition was presented fromthe property holders on Tenth streetasking that the city take steps lookingtoward the construction of concretesidewalks on the north side. MayorHinton was ordered to investigate thecost of the pavements."WE KNOW HOW"sLet YourMoney Do It-If Your Money Was HumanIt Would Not Want To BeExchanged For Clothing Unless it Was Dollar For DollarValue.7afkDon't let your money buy just Clothing.

Hopper Professor of Animal Industry at State University, has issuedthe following bulletin:The death rate among young chicksin this state is very high. A large percentage of this loss is due t& mismanagement. At the Experiment Stationwe have had splendid success in raising young chicks.The vitality of the young birds depends very largely upon the vigor ofthe birds that lay the eggs. We haveound that we get the best results fromeggs that are produced at that 'time inthe spring when the flock is allowedconsiderable range on grass and othergreen crops. During the winter it isa common practice among poultrymento house their birds closely. At thistime fertility and vitality are very lowwhile later when the birds get out ofdoors, these qualities increase.We have found that in comparisonwith the incubator andbrooder, the hencan very satisfactorily hatch the eggsand care for the chicks. We makethe nests out of hay or some materialthat is very fine in texture. Strawis rather coarse and allows theheat ofthe broody hen to escape, while thehay holds the heat in the nest.When the chicks are hatched wekeep them in an incubator or allowthem to stay twelve hours with themother before feeding anything. "Thenwe feed a fine chick grit and supplyluke warm water. The next day wegive the first feed of fine crackedchick feed. Rolled oats are valuable,but we have had splendid results fromfeeding nothing but chick feed andgrit for the first week. At the end often days we feel a finely powdered"grow feed" which has in it beefscraps, fish scraps, wheat shorts andother ingredients. The young birdsare very fond of this and it makesthem grow rapidly. We also sprinklepowdered charcoal in the feed once aday. Clear water is supplied in a sanitary fountain. The water is changed several times a day, as the chicksrequire a very large quantity of water.When the chicks are about two weeksold we pull a handful of green clover,tie the stems together with a stringand hang the bunch of green materialwhere the little chicks can pull off theleaves. Too much green feed willcause the scours, but some of it isneeded.The earthworm serves" as a host forthe gapeworm. Therefore chicks thatare allowed to roam over infectedground will contract gapes By keeping your chicks on the ground thathas not become infected, we havenever had a case of gap"es at this Station. When the chicks are with the henwe provide a warm nesting box separate from the remainder of the flock.If we are brooding the birds under aheated hover we are very careful tokeep the temperature at 103 degreesF. while the chicks are young. Ifthe young birds become chilled theywill be weaken. Any deformed orweak chicks are killed during the firsttwelve hours of their lives. It is not agood practice to take weak chicksfrom the incubator and allow them torun with stronger mates, because theywill contract diseases and infect theentire flock.If there are no trees in the yardwhere we put the young birds, weprovide shade by making an awningout of feed sacks, or cotton cloth.Sunflowers also make a good shade.If the young birds when they are amonth old can run in a cultivated fieldit gives them exercise and furnishesconsiderable feed.By following these methods we havehad a splendid success in the rearingof young birds.FOLK-LORE SOCIETYDoing anExcellentState..Work in ThisAttention of the readers of this paper is called to the efforts of the recently formed Kentucky Folk-LoreSociety.

Maflnn, Secretary of the Douglaa ParisJockey Club, at Louisville, Ky., afterft careful review of thQ sixty nominations in the $15,000 Kentucky Handicap, to be decided on the opening ofthe twelve-day meeting, Monday, May26, hazards the opinion that not lessthan fifteen horses, possibly more, willo to the post in that rich event.The distance of the Kentucky Handicap Is a mile and a quarter. This isthe proper route for a tried steed tohave no excuse if he is beaten by ahorse of phenomenal speed that manages to live out the distance.The recent defeat of Froglegs, J. W.Schorr's great four-year-cld, by MacKenzie & Adkins' Buckhorn, at a difference of only three pounds in favorot Buckhorn, will make that colt nowthe favorite for this event, unless thetalent award this prestige to the Kentucky Derby winner, Donerail, or hisEastern three-year-old rival, A. L-Aste's Ten Point. Considerable of thisspeculation, however, will be basedupon the weights assigned by Secretary Maginn. which will be publishedfive days before the event is run off.It is figured that, in addition to thefour horses named, many of the following, perhaps all, will face StarterMars Cassidy next Monday: AdamsExpress, Foundation, Gowell, Labold,Hawthorn, Milton B., Rudolfo, IrishGentleman, Yankee Notions, FloralPark, Miss Thorpe, Flora Fina, TheWidow Moon, Prince Hermis, JudgeWright, High Private, Manager Mack,John Furlong and Christmas Star.With good track conditions it is figured that the Kentucky record for thisdistance, held by Bonnie Kelso atLexington, 2:04, will be beaten, andeven the American mark for a mileand a quarter, 2:02 4-5, jointly heldby Broomstick and Olambala, may be (lowered In this race. The DouglasPark track has been in unusually fast jcondition all spring. This has beendemonstrated by the trials of varioushorses. Not so long ago the wholecourse was resoiled. At the comingmeeting tne track is certain to befaster thn. ever hnfnmn is amazing to note the keen interest manifested by turfmen in thlsgreat race. It has been the snbjecLof as much discussion as any race errordecided on a Kentucky track. Experts have noted the racing and theworkouts of the various performersEach horse has his following, and Itmay be said that the following In each?instance is counted in scores. This is.due in no small measure to the passing of similar races, as the BurnsHandicap, Suburban Handicap, Brooklyn Handicap, Wheeler Handicap, Club-.Members' Handicap, and BrightonHandicap. During the years in whichthey were decided they attracted international interest. The distance ofeach was a mile and a quarter, andeach was the feature event, the sameas the Kentucky Handicap this season.Manager John Hachmeister expects,the Spring Trial Stakes to be a racerwhich may have a bearing on thegreat derbies to be decided next seaBon. Among the 119 nominations areall of the crack two-yeai-olds, including the three unbeaten stars, Imperator, Vandergrift and Little NephewThis event is run on the closing daySaturday, June 7, so Douglas Park begins with a great race and terminatesits spring meeting with a race of exceptional class.The Memorial Handicap, set for Friday, May 30, Decoration Day, is a.stake which will attract all of the bestsprinters, as the distance is six furlongs. Among the sure starters willbe the flying Sprite, as yet unbeatenin 1913. The other stake event is theSpeculation Stakes, at a mile and asixteenth, to be decided on WednesdayJune 4, and its selling conditions makeall of the best platers now in trainingeligible. In this stake there are-eighty-fournominations.Manager Hachmeister Is making every arrangement to comfortably carefor the tremendous crowd which wilLbe present to see the Kentucky Handicap. As the card each day will beunusually classy, owing to the largeamount of money hung up for thhorsemen, which means that America's best horses will compete, there iscertain to be great crowds to witness,the sport. Douglas Park is more beautiful than ever, and every plan hasbeen developed to add to the enjoyment of a eeascn of unjsual racingInasmuch as the railroads have mad"a low rate for every day of the meeting, crowds will come from all overKentucky, and distant points as.well.L. dc n. time-table;IN EFFECT MAY 4,1913No.34134297104037312332625i)138385393083231Trains ArriveAil L FROMAtlanta, Ga. , Daily 91 .Lexington, Ky., Daily '.7.7.7. 5 1WCynthiana , Ky., Daily Except Sunday 7.7.7.7.7.77. 7 35 amMaysville, Ky., Daily Except Sunday. 7 38 an?Rowland, Ky., Daily Except Sunday " " 7 40 am-.Lexington, Ky. , Daily Except Sunday " .

Respectfully,Russ Corbin."By Superintendent Hamiett 'Regarding, New Law.On account of. conflicting reportsand confusion in many counties, construing the new law governing thequalications of candidates for countycandidates for the office of County Suof school State Superintendent Barksdale Hamiett has issued the followingextracts from the Kentucky Statutesin bulletin form:First. The Act of 1912 requires allperintendent, except those who arenow in office, to hold a State Certificate issued by the State Board of Examiners, which does not expire duringthe anticipated term of office.Second. The applicant may qualifyby taking a special examination to beheld in the Department of Education,Frankfort, May 30 and 31, and June 27and 28. This examination is in all respects equivalant to the examinationThird. The applicant may qualifyfor the regular State Certificate,by taking the regular State Examination, June 20 and 21, either in thecounty in which the applicant residesor in Frankfort.before the State Boardof Examiners.Fourth. Applicants may qualify after nominations are made in the August primary. However, there is onlyone chance after the primary, and thatis in the regular State Examination inAugust, and the candidates can nottake this examination, except in hishome county, where he expects to runfor office, or in Frankfort in the Department of Education.Fifth. Incumbents in office, underthe law, are required by virtue oftheir past tenure of office, to run forre-election without further examination. Sixth. The 1912 law prescribesthat all candidates who are not incumbents in office, must either have acertificate as herein described, or takethis special examination, which is inall respects the equivalent of a StateCertificate. Therefore, all such candidates must have taught two years,the time required by law to secure aState Certificate.LIVE STOCK NOTES.Rape is a valuable forage plant forhogs.Red clover makes an excellent pasture for hogs.An old straw pile is not the worstkind of winter hog pen.In shipping lambs, keep the culls athome or sell to local buyers.Keep a record of each sow to determine her worth as a breeder.Never kill a pig for market or homoconsumption until It Is ripe or fit.Hogs are among the most cleanlyanimals if they are given a fairchance.Avoid an excessive amount of forage that has been more or less affected by frost.Handle the young boar carefully.Teach him to obey the -word, and towalk fchead of you.Oil meal is greatly relished bylambs and ho.lns greatly in the finefinish obtained in feeding.When outdoor exercise and sunshine are lacking;, the pigs shouldhave a wide variety of feeds.Arrange for plenJy of yard room,and on all fair days keep the sheep inthe open air as much as possible.Fattening sheep must be made toeat as much as possible, but mustnever be made to turn from theirfood. ,The shoeing of the farm horsesshould receive the same attentionthat is given the road horse or thtrotter.It is a great mistake to keep sheepin a warm pen in winter. Theirfleece protects them, and if they arekept dry they will require nothingelse.Corn gruel is not suitable for little pigs. They should have new milkand lime water and gradually thismight be thickened with middlings,oatmeal and flaxseed meal.iWZ)SMm MMHJWEAKNESSbut is promptly relievedby the medical nourishment inScott's Emulsion whichis not a nerve-quieter, but nature'sgreatest nerve -builder, withoutalcohol or opiate.Scott & Bowne, Bloomfield, N.

There wil be another meeting ofthe stockholders and those interested in the loose leaf tobacco warehouse at the opera house Saturday at3 p. m. Let everybody be present.We can not afford to let this fallthrough with. It means much to thepeople of Millersburg and surroundingcommunity. We especially insiston the 'merchants ' and business menof Millersburg to come to the rescueof the enterprise. Where the tobaccois sold money will be spent. If wedrive this to other markets as wehave done heretofore, do not grumblebecause our farmers spend a largepart of their surplus away fromhome. Not only this, but it will giveemployment to our laboring people, agreat many of whom are now workingduring the season at Paris, Cynthiana, Carlisle and other places.. Somefew of our merchants have not contributed a cent toit. Such selflshne sscannot exist and prosper. They allwant the house, the market andtheir share of the patronage therefrom, and it is no more than justthat they should bear their part ofthe burden. Saturday will tell thestory, the company will organize orthe plans will be given up. It islargely in the hands of the merchants of Millersburg coming to therescue. If you fail in this do notgrumble when our people go elsewhere to buy. You will be largely responsible in driving them away fromtheir home market by not encouraging ' a home enterprise, which willkeep everything at home.

Quite a number ofelectric light and telephone were putout of commission. The large stockbarn of Mr. W.. D. Mclntyre at thehead of Trigg avenue, was struck bylightning, tearing a place about twofeetsquare in the roof. However, noone was very near the place at thetime. A small spark was started inthe shingles which smouldered allnight and was not discovered untilWednesday morning by a hand. Atthe time they entered the barn it wasfull of smoke, and was in the act ofbreaking 'out into a full blaze. Thefact that the roof was wet preventedthis earlier. There were severalhead of mules, farm utensils, wagons and fed-stuff in the barn. A number of other stables and- small- buildings were near the property and hadit gotten under headway it wouldhave in all probability proved a serious fire. This property adjoins theM. M. I. grounds. The M. M. I. cadetswere among the first on the sceneafter the alarm was given, and thefire was entirely out before the engine arrived. The loss to the property was but slight and was repairedat once.
