church put the little two-act drama,
"That Awful Aunt of Ours," on the
boards at the local OperaHouse, Mon
day evening. Notwithstanding the
inclement weather about all the seats
were occupied. All the froung folks
did their work in a creaitable manner.
The specialties were decidedly better
than the play. The exercises opened
withtwo or three courses by several
youngladies, followed by the readings
by Miss Aleta Wilson. The leading
feature ofthe entertainment, however,
was the vaudeville acts between the
first and second acts of the piece by

down the house. "That Awful Aunt
of Ours," was in two acts, Miss Nancy
Jones playing the part of "the awful
aunt," and Mr. T. K. Smith, as the
negro servant, were the stars. It
reached its climax in the opening of
the second act, where several young
men were smoking cigars, drinking
whisky, playing cards, and where the
young cashier of the bank was drug
ged and the villain in the act of escap
ing with the keys when the"Aunt"
appears and all is saved. It was a
scene where the society was forgot
ten and Satan was very much in evi
dence. The only thing needed to
give a proper finish to the occasion
would have been a handsome loving
cup at the toastmaster's place. Miss
Amelia Hurst was at the piano for
the occasion and did her work nicely.
The entire work was under the super
vision of Mesdames R. L. Wilson and
C. D. Tackett. About $90 was re
alized. Mrs. J.Clark Leer, Jr., suffered a
severe attack of neuralgia Tuesday
night, but is able to be out again.

GUNMMEN MUST DIE
Date F'xed for Execution of Rosen
val Murderers.
ALBANY, N. Y., Feb. 26. "Gyp the
Blood," "Lefty Louie," 'Whitey Lew
is," and "Dago Frank," the four gun
men jointly indicted with former po
lice lieutenant Charges Becker for the
murder of Herman Rosenthal, the
gambler will be electrocuted during
the week beginning April 13.
The date was fixed by the Court of
Appeals to-day when the judges sign
ed the four death warrants.
The exercise of executive clemency
now is all that can prevent thedeath
o f the gunmen. No appeals for par
dons have been received by the gov
ernor. The last day of Charles Becker's
stay in the death house at Sing Sing
prison was to-day gladdened by a visit
from his wife. Owing to the death of
her mother, whose funeral was held
yesterday, Mrs. Becker was prevented
from going to the prison on Tuesday
when news of the Court of Appeals'
decision granting her husband a new
trial for the murder of Henman Ros
enthal was announced from Albany.
The meeting between, the couple
was pathetic, although each attempt
ed to keep back any outward display
of feeling.
TWO MEN KILLED
Attempt to Cross Railroad Track and
Are Struck 3y Fast Train.
MAYSVILLE, Ky., Feb. 26 D.
Samuel White, a wealthy Banker of
Ripley, Ohio, and Lewis Williams, dri
ver of the transfer wagon from the C.
& O. station at South Ripley, were
struck by C. & O. fast train No. 5,
this. morning and both instantly kill
ed. They were attempting to cross the
track on the fast train's time, and as
this train does not stop at South Rip
ley it was speeding along at about
fifty miles an hour.
The wagon was struck and demol
ished. Both horses were killed and Mr.
White so terribly mangled that it was
almost impossible to identify him.
Williams was also mangled.
On account of the ice and snow, it
is thought that the horses lost their
footing and could not get over the
rails in time.
Because he told purchasers of city
lots that they were only fifteen min
utes walk, when in reality they were
eight miles away, P. M. Daniel, Jr., a
New York City real estate man, was
convicted of larceny.
Linen pantalettes, modified hoop
skirts and mannish coats, vests and
high collars are among the startling
features of spring fashions for women
