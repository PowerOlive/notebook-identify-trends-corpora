did not want hie mother who lives inMississippi to know how be died Hisher is alive but does not liye in ParisWilliams Own StoryThe following is Clarence Williamsown story of his life as dictated by himfor The NewsMy father is Peter Williams aud mymother is named Ellen Barrett Mymother left here when I was a small boyin 1888 with Mrs Thompson and Istayed with my father for about twoyears until he treated me so bad that Ileft him After that I stayed in townwith Martin Palmer for one year andafter that I stayed in Claysville thebalance of my life until I got into thistroubleThe public called me a mean mansimply because I wouldnt let everybody run over me I am a small man andcarried a gun to protect myself Thefirst time I ran away from home I askedhim to let me go hunting and that nightwhen I came home he jumped on meand beat me until I could hardly standnp It seemed like I was the blacksheep of the family so I left borne audstayed with Vol Howe and my fathercame after me and said he was going toFrom a photograph of Williamstaken a year agoput me in jail until I was twenty -oneyears old I begged him not to do thatand I would come home and be a goodboyAfter I came back home he workedme for a week when I was sick andwouldnt gefme a flbctor TTbolfc downin bed with a fever and I laid in bedfour months and got np too soon andtook a backset The cause of my takingthe backset was that he made me go tothe field and shuck eight shocks of cornin the snow and March winds He runme away from home once with a shotgun and told me to stay away and nevercome back if I did he would kill meAfter that I had trouble with William Warren and I shot him once in thabdomen and ouoe in the arm audserved two years in Fraukf rt penitentiary for it Previous to tliis I hadJosie Tillman as a paramour and CapTillman found it out aud took her out tothe colored folks emetery at WilliMagowans and told bim if I came outthere to kill me Then I never hadanything to do with her until I cameback ftom the penI took up with her on the third day ofJannai a a paramour and I stayedwith her until I killed her the one Iov d JoMe TillmanI was on the table at Sam Graffortsgrocery in Clavsville and Henry Walkercame to me and asked if I wanted tomake aoine money I asked bim whatdoing and he said he had some cows tosell and we would make about 75 or80 I told him I never did anythinglike that but be insisted on me goingwith him and I finally went with himand we took them te Georgetown andsold them for 45 and went to Lexingtonwhere we divided the money If ithadnt been for him I wouldnt be whereI am to day in the Paris jail condemned to be hungI bought my gun in Lexington Ikilled Josie Tillman but I didnt go todo it It wasnt my intention to kill herbut to scare her and make her comeback to me I do not believe I wouldhave shot her if she had stood still butshe wheeled to run and that was thecause of her getting shot Theevidence that was given against me Icould not blame the jurymen Therewas lots of perjuring done on the standif it was only known There was agreat deal of malace against me in mycase and at that they wont make anygreat fortune for it All I can say isthat I hope them all well in the fntreThe reason a great many swore to liestheywere afraid of Capt Tillman ashe is a great bully in Claytville andthev thought he would fix it with themI think I deserve to be punished butnot so severe I only wish that MrBradley will change my sentence to lifein the penitentiary and then I will havea chance to change my ways and get repentance as I have been a sinner inmy past daysI must say that Mrs Ashbrook andher tnrnkev Mr A M Kiser havetreated me like I was white and I appreciate it My favorite among theprisoners is Mr Forest Lang He hastreated me like a brother There wasntanything be had that was too good forme As tbe saying tjoes he certainlywas good to me and that aint nodreamClabknck WilliamsWilliams Last Statement1 wont have anything to say Mondaybut will say all I have to say to dayWednesday December 6th I hopeall men and boys will take my adviceaud not let women or whiskev or a gnnget tbe best of them Look what awomen has brought me to I have tosuffer death for people gitting up in thecourt house and perjuring themselvesTake warning of me and pick yourcompany It is altogether in the company you keep and you will find ontthat you will get through the worldbetter if you pick your companyA friend in need is a friend indeedI will say that if Forrest Lang had beenbrother to me he could not have treatedme any better There was nothing inhis power that I asked him to do for mebut what he didI am to hang dead by tbe neck in afew days to which I was sentenced bythe June term of Curt I did notkill Josie Tillman with the intention ofkilling her but the Commonwealth ofKentucky found me guilty and fixed mypunishment at death I am thankful tomy lawyer Mr Webb for what he hasdone for me I think he has done hisduty in every respect I am also thankful to Gov W O Bradley for what hehas done and would like for him to domore if he willI have done nothing to die for bnt ifI must I will this should be a lesson tothe younger people who are conductingthemselves disorderly in tbe communities in which they live I have led thewrong kind of a life from the beginningand I am sorry for the country to knowof it There are lots of things I havedone in life I dont want the public to know of because of its disgraceI have found no peace with my Makerand don t think there is any place inHeaven for me I have appealed to theSupreme Being but it was all in vainI guess the devil has got the bill of salefor ere so corrupt I dont want tohear a prayer from tbe mouth of anyone and I am not anxious to see anyoneexcept some that belongs in jailI suppose that my sentence will beexecuted December 11th Now I trulyhope the boys of this community andelsewhere who are standing in open ruinwill take warning from my case andnever be guilty of any crime in the leastAlso use this as a lesson and it will guidethem rightClarence WilliamsStory of The CrimeThe crime for which Clarence Williams was executed was committed otWednesday March 22d 1899 in Claysvi lie

materials that are now largely used formaking clock hands is aluminiumsaid a leading clock manufacturer recently Until recently the pointersof big clocks when not made of woodwere composed of two thin strips ofcopper which were capped or hollowed and then brought together edge toedge with the rounded sides out thusgiving strength as well as lightnessThe aluminium clock pointers aremade just in the same way as thecopper ones but they possess the merit of being twice as light aud are fareasier to balanceIt isnt unusual on large clocks tosee projecting from the base of thelong pointer and in line with it a rodwith a ball at the end this rod being perhaps a third as long as the bigpointer This rod and ball act as acounterweight for the big pointerwhich without a counterweight wouldin its movement around the dial bearunevenly upon the arbor or shaft whichcarries it On great clocks and oftenon big timepieces indoors this counterpoise is placed inside the dial out ofsight on the arborThe heavier the pointer the greaterthe weight required in the counterpoise the greater the weight the morefriction on the arbor and the morefriction the greater the power required to drive the clock By the use ofaluminium pointers these drawbacksare reduced to a minimum Washington StarThere Is i learned mau In Michiganwho wouli rather have a rare specimen from the animal vegetable ormineral kingdom

speculators who make abusiness of traveling through the ruraldistricts and buying up all the old goldand silver they can find They are experts in judging of the fineness ofmetal and they pay as little

rare artistic valueturns up in the lot and we would beonly too glad to take it out and makegood the coin value but the law forbidsThat by the way is no doubt thevery reason why we occasionally getsuch
