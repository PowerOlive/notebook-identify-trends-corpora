Stairsin Their Night ClothesOmaha Neb Feb 13 A specialfrom Yankton says One of the mosthorrifying fires in the history of Yankton occurred Sunday morning at 2oclock at the state insane asylumwhen one of the cottages took fire inthe basement completely gutting thebuilding and causing the loss of livesof 17 inmates confined thereThe cottage was erected of stone andgranite walls with wooden interiorand intended for luundry purposesbut owing to the crowded conditionof the main building 40 of the femalepatients were placed here with thelaundry in the basement The exactcause of the fire is not known exceptthat it originated in the dry room of thelaundry- Here there is a coil of steampipes and the theory is that either fineparticles similar to lint settled on thepipes which ignited or that clotheswhich were thickly hung here droppedon the pipes and were fired Thefight ng of fire was greatly hinderedby loss of power The burned cottagestands some 300 feet in the rear ofthe main building the water tankwhich is for fire protection standing100 feet in the rear of the cottage Thesteam pipes used for pumping runsfrom the boiler room of the mainbuilding through the cottage for heating and then to the artesian well ortank The intense heat in the burningbuilding caused the pipes to burstshortly after the fighting of thefire bejran thus leavinrr themwithout power and depending entirelyupon direct pressure from the tankwhich was in no way sufficient toquench the fierce flames Two streamsof water Mere thrown on the buildingbut did little good With the thermometer standing at 25 degrees belowzero it was a heartrending sight to witness those escaping coming down thenarrow flight of stairs in their nightclothes and bare feet into the bittercold and had it not been for the nearness of shelter the suffering and probable loss of life from freezing wouldhave been terrible The building wasthree stories high with an attic andtwo entrances one east and one westThere was one stairway from thesecond and third floors which led intothe mam halls to these entrances thusgiving but one egress for those in thesecond and third floors and attic Fifty-twopersons were in the building40 patients and 12 lemale attendantsThe attendants escaped as did the others who were saved with none of theirpersonal effects many losing all thatthey possessedCCL D G COLSON WOUNDETrouble

gas It seems to beburning in the next room tooThis chamber was a large luxuriousbedroom and as they entered it Lampkins imagination prepared itself for ahorrible spectacle To his great relief however everything here was alsoin perfect order The white lace coverlet lay as smoothly as newly fallensnow and the sheets and pillows lookedas if they had never been used Theclerk now with a look of growing curiosity if not of incipient horrorstooped down and looked under thebedNothing there he said Then hisattitude grew more serious as he wentto the large closets one by one andopened the doors There is the bathroom jet he remarked with a shudder his mind perhaps busy with a bitof French history or some recent American horror Its getting mighty common nowadays to commit bloodycrimes in bathrooms Do you suspectfoul play sirYou are going entirely too fastsaid Hendricks in a curt tone Hverymatter I choose to investigate need notnecessarily be a bloody one Hesmiled and added to Lampkin Myreputation among the people is as redas cranberry sauceThe clerk bore the reproof with becoming humility He made no replyand bung back till the detective badopened the door leading to the bathroom Here the gas was burning alsoand the small chamber with its polished tiled floor and glistening porcelain walls revealed no hint of bloodshedThe face of the clerk fell his appetitefor sensation not to be fed on thisoccasionWhat time did Mr Caruthers leavethe hotel the night be left Hendricksasked himI really dont know sir said theclerk I am pretty sure be did notmention it at the office and that is customary among our guests That is whyI thought there might have been someunderhand-Leave your pass key with me interrupted the detective coldly Myfriend and I want to have a little private talk When you go down dontmention our being hereThe clerk reluctantly laid the key ona tableIll not give it away sir He movedslowly towards the door IT you wantanything ring Ill be on the lookoutand will run up myselfGood said Hendricks you are veryKindThe detective followed him to theouter door and dosed it after himThen he came back into the bedroomI hope this is only a hoax after allunserved me coetor What are vougoing to do nextHendricks shrugged bis broad shoulders it amounted to a shudderWe are going to look through thosetnnks for a trunk and the restIs it really so bad as thatMy blasted premonition which faculty in my make up has always been amystery to me has hold of me withits four claws said Hendricks Icant explain it doctor but the minute I entered that door and saw thegas burning so brightly I felt murderin the air Sometimes on a day likethis at a crisis like this I imaginethat the spirit of the murdered man lingers round the spot where he lost hislife to trj to give me a clewLampkin shuddered as the detectivelaid hold of the nearest steamer trunkand began to unstrap it It was emptysave for some clothing in the bottomThe next trunk was a large square oneand its lock for several minutes resistedthe efforts of the detective to unfastenit Finally however aided by a key ofhis own and no little experience insuch matters Hendricks released thebrass hasp and it fell down with psharp clickThis trunk also contained nothingof a suspicious nature and the same results were produced by a careful examination of two other trunks storedIn the bathroom and a dress suit caseof heavy leather which wis found in oneof the closetsAh 1 certainly feel better criedIampkin a triumphant ring in hisvoiceI dont ejaculated Hendricks withone of his massive frowns which always made his great brow- resemble aminiature jutting cragAnd whyBecause my anonymous correspondent says I shall find the remains ofWei don Caruthers in these apartmentsand I believe on m soul he meant whathe saidBut that man downstairs said Caruthers valet has received a communication from his master in PhiladelphiaIll et my life it was forgedLampkm started and then lie gaedinto the

he said reflectivelyYou will observe he doea not saybut the remains and he has underscored the word heavily Furthermore he boasts of the skill with whichthe crime has been accomplished thatold man means somethingBut it seems to me that you havelooked into every possible nook andcranny said the doctorAs if under a sudden inspirationHendricks sprang up and going to thebed he pushed aside the silken curtainsof the canopy turned down the sheetsand doubled up the mattress Then hedrew himself up and began to examinethe about the room Hethumped with his knuckles a marblestatue of Venus de Milo in a corner andthen stood still in the center of theroom and stared at the articles of ornament on the mantel piece He walkedslowly backward to the doctor and laida hand on his shoulder and pointed toa large covered Japanese vase shapedlike an ancient urnDoctor he said the man who selected all the in this roomdid not select that vaseIt does seem a little out of harmony admitted Lampkin Rathercheaper than the rest dont you thinkIt is a disgrace to such a collectionJ returned the detective besides it hasbeen crowded in between those beautiful bronze pieces Old man I have anideaLampkin said nothing as he watchedhis friend place a chair near the mantel-pieceand mount it The chair raisedthe detective so high that the cover ofthe vase was on a level with his chinHendricks removed the cover andlooked into the vesselLampkin saw him pick up somethinginside the vase examine it and lay itback For a moment the detectivestood his back to the doctor a hand oneither side of the vessel Then he lifted it cautiously stepped clown to thefloor and placed it on the tablePrepare to be horrified old manhe said grimly It is hereLampkin started You dont meanYou neednt Ionic unless you wantto frowned the deective But ourarch fiend has actually cremated thebody of Caruthers leaving thejeweled hand of bis victim to preventthere being any doubt as to the identityof the ashes It was cremation I knowbone ashes when I see themLampkin got up and peered into thejar turning the ghastly object over onthe bed of ashes beneathThere is no odor he said trying tospeak in a matter-of-fact tone Thatis strangeEmbalmed said Hendricks Isaw indications of it in the puncturesof the fleshYou are right agreed the doctorLet me see a moment with thesewords the detective sprang to the vaseJrA JSff fw VrHE SAW HIM PICK UP SOMETHINGand picking up the grewsome objectexamined it minutelyI have only one isolated clew hesaid putting the severed hand back onthe ashesWhat is thatIn his effort to cut and wrench thishand from the joint at the wrist themurderer allowed his sharp nails tosink into the flesh The marks did notshow at the time but the process ofdecomposition has brought them outdistinctly Doctor the fellow who didthe job manicures his finger nails tosharp points as is the vogue among society men of a certain classLampkin made au examinationYou are certainly light he saidreturning the hand to the vaseShrewd and cautious as the perpetrator evidently was that did not occur tohimGod has uever yet made it possiblefor a human mind to be full of a hellishdeed and at the same time master details that will completely overcome detection was Hendricks replyYou do not think that the body couldhave been reduced to ashes in theseapartmentssaid Lampkin tentativelyHendricks shook his head and pointed to the open fireplace where lay theashes of a wood fireNo this is the only fireplace and ithas not been used for a fortnightAre you sure incredulouslyQuite sure This chimney seems tocome straight down from the roof andraindrops have fallen and left their imprints here It rained two weeks agoand has been clear ever sinceI w ould never have thought of thatIt is my business to think of everythingLampkina face betrayed the birth ofan important ideaSurely he said the body couldnot easily have been removed for thepurpose of cremation elsewhere without being dismembered Perhaps ifyou made a careful examination youmight find traces of its having beencut upThanks for the suggestion saidHendricks Lampkin watched him aaexamined the porcelain tub and whitetiled floorNo he said coming back I thinkhe managed to remove the body in itaentiretyYou think that remarked thedoctor not convincedYes it would be an easy thing todo As Caruthers was supposed to beleaving it would be natural for him totake a trunk and bis luggage goingout would not attract much attentionGood heavens exclaimed the doctor In his own trunkAt this juncture the door leading intothe corridor swung open and the clerkwho had shown them upstairs enteredsuddenly his eyes alighting on thesevered hand which across thesomewhat narrow mouth of the vaseMy Lord he exclaimed his eyesbulging from their sockets has hashe been murdered Mr HendricksAn expression of deep annoyance settled on the face of the detectiveYes he said But leave us alonefor a few minutes and please dont sayanything about this down in the officejust yet We would be interrupted bysight seersThe clerk thrust his white horrifiedface forward and peered into the vaseSurely not not cremated Mr Hendricks he gaspedThats about the size of it retortedthe detective He went to the door andheld it open The clerk tcok the hintand backed out of the roomDont lay it to me if this gets outsooner than you wish he said Amember of the detective force wadown there in citizens clothes andrecognized you when you first camein He had heard of the remarks goincround about Mr Caruthers absenceand seeing you on hand made himmore curious He has Mr Caruthersman down there now asking him questions It seems nothing has been seenof Mr Caruthers since he had the rowwith Mr Arthur Gielow at the clubHendricks leaned against the doorfacingThey had a

ffaiilinanimoasiy AitoptedWashington Feb 10 The report ofthe war investigating commission is inthe hands of the president and thecommission is dissolved All of themembers of the commission includingthe secretary Mr Wcightman and therecorder Co Oavis met 03- appointment at the white house at 415 oclockThursday afternoon and were at onceshown into the cabinet room wherethey were received by the presidentGen Dodge the chairman of the commission presented the report and inreceiving it congratulated the commissioners on the completion of their taskScaled around the cabinet tabic themembers went over their work in ageneral way and at the request of thepresident read portions of their reportwhich covered certain points in whichhe had expressed an interest Theconference lasted about an hour and ahalf and as the commissioners wereabout to leave tiie president statedthat he was satisfied that each member had done his whole duty He himself had rendered them every assistance possible and said that they wouldbear witness that he had not sought toinfluence them in any manner or in theslightest degreeIn speaking of the report Thursdayto a Star reporter a prominent memberof the commission saidThe report docs not whitewash Iicriticises but not persons or thingswhich are not warranted by the evidence before u We started outwith the assumption that the conductof the war was all right and then wewont ahead to hear and call wituesseiwho said it was not The report represents the honest opinion of everymember of the commission We wereunanimous in adopting it I say thisand I am of the opposite political faithand dont expect and dont want anything from the administrationI know that every line of the report represents my individual viewand if any member tried harder thanI did to get at and out all the facts Ihave yet to sec him There was nosuppression or concealment and nopoint brought out in the evidence wasevaded or glossed over Wc never metbefore hearing a witness and agreedaot to examine him or to touch uponcertain matters that might turn outunfavorably Eveiything that a manknew or thought he knew was the subject of inquiry and I am satisfiedAlien the country gets our report infull that there will be no complaintsither as to our methods or resultsThe president never saw a line ofjur report before he received it officially not a single word Nor inlecd has he ever talked with any ofihe commission about itHe has never in an way by wordr action or messengers evinced a wish0 have us develop anything but theruth or even touched upon the matterour workWe have questioned more than 500Witnesses and the majority of themiad some complaint that they wanted0 relate In no instance can it beproved that we have omitted to callmy witness who has been brought tomr attention as having importantfacts to disclose But had we desiredo whitewash the administration weould have had 5000 witnesses whojould truthfully testify that the conluct of the war was all rightOf course there were some evils buthey were to be expected The soliicrs in the civil war never had hospitals or medical attendance as goodis was given them in the war withSpain And their army ration thenwas not as eatable as it is now Themen who complained most of the foodpvc found were very generally the militiamen from the interiors of states andtvho had been allowed 52 per head forsubsistence stores while they were instate camps When they went into theictive fight they expected the samesort of thingIn questioning these men nearly alljonfessed to us that they had alwaysreceived the army ration They hadao right to expect any more I couldiell some very funny stories to illustrate thisThere were many complaintsbrought to us that on their face werefoolish and

veteran sport who isstaying in New Orleans during the winter races and a thousand stories aretold of their eccentricities in that lineThe queerest thing that I know personally to be a fact occurred in 1876 ina Colorado mining camp called Carbonate It was a wild woolly place andpractically run by the tough elementOf course there was plenty of gamblingand one evening a stranger carrying anumbrella walked into a place where afaro outfit was in full blastHappening to notice that one of theribs of the umbrella was sprung hethoughtlessly opened it right over thehead of a player The man glaredaround and whipping out a pistolshot the stranger dead He was arrested and taken before a self appointedjudge who was also proprietor of a kenoroom The prisoner admitted the deedbut pleaded extreme provocation Theopening of the umbrella over the headof one who is playing faro heexplainedwas as everybody knew a hoodoo forlife and doomed its victim to a careerof uninterrupted disaster The onlyway to remove the curse was to instantly slay the owner of the umbrella Thejudge listened with sagacious nods andthen sent for a number of hoodoo experts in other words the principalgamblers in town They turned paleat the very mention of umbrellas anddeclared on oath that such an episodeas the one described would undoubtedly blight anybodys entire lifeOnly two courses were open in sucha cae suicide or manslaughter Themagistrate charged the jury that theywere the sole judges of the facts andthe hoodoo and they promptly returneda verdict of justifiable homicide Afterthat umbrellas became unpopular

with a cargo ofgoods While there I was the guest ofPaul Jones at the time United Statesconsul at that place A force of workmen were engaged n remodeling theancient cathedral which had beenbuilt some 400 years before One dayone of the men engaged in excavatingstruck a leaden box with his pick justunder the altar The box was abouttwo feet in length ten inches wide andten inches tall The box was coveredwith inscriptions but time and theearth had worked such changes thatthey could not be decipheredThe box was opened and in it wasfound a handful of dust a part of ahuman skull and a number of bonesA silver plate which had been fastened on the underside of the lid of thebox was found among the bones thescrews with which it had been fastenedLaving given way with decay Therewere a number of pieces of jewelry andtrinkets in the box On the plate wasthe inscription C Colon Spanishfor Christopher Columbus Noonc butthe priests of the parish saw the contents of the box at that timeA short time later an Italian man-of-wararrived at San Domingo and asColumbus had been born in Italy theyasked to see the remains The privilege wu accorded and through UnitedSlates Consul faul Jones I was permitted to be of the party and I wasainoug the first to pick up all that remained of Christopher Columbus Consul -Jones also held the bonesAfter the impressive ceremony theremains were taken in

occasion for such rememown volition tGreat minds have wrestled to find anexplanation for the pranks that memoryplays and have had to give up theeflo t In the course of a systematic attempt to arrive at some understandingwith regard to the wonders of memorya very valuable and unique body oftestimony has been obtained The following questions have been put to 200American university students and professional persons 151 being men and49 being women The answers are heregiven with the questionsQuestion 1 When you cannot recalla name you want does it seem to comebu spontaneously without being suggested by any perceived association ofideas To this 11 per cent answeredNo and 81 per cent YesQuestion 2 Does such recovery evercome during sleep To this 1 7 per centanswered No and 28 percent YesSome examples given1 This morning I tried to recall thename of a character I had read of thefailed I taught a classhoni in the afternoon all the names recurred to me without effort2 I tried to recall the name of abook Gave it up Half an hour laterwhile talking of something else blurtedit out without conscious volitionQuestion 3 On seeing a sight orhearing a sound for the first time haveyou ever felt that you had seen or vessels approached thehta 1 the same before Fifty nine per around a candle Heeet answered YesThe action of unconscious memoryduring sleep is illustrated by

brilliant illumination a steamers lights came intoview It was soon evident that thesteamer was curious to know the meaning of the illumination for she alteredher course and made for the light Sheknew that no fishing boats came out sofar from land and so determined tosolve the mystery Up she came towithin a quarter of a mile of the buoyslowed up for a minute and then started ahead perhaps a little

and seizing the offenderattempted to drag him offThe audience rose in indignationMen shook their fists and shoutedWhat has he done One frenziedyoung lady in the front of the galleryseized a tumbler and would have thrownit at the policeman if her arm had notbeen arrestedThe policeman then dragged his captive off the stage amid the hisses andshouts of the audience But anger wasspeedily changed to

ANANCIENT BOOKIf the Combatant Dies aa a Result afthe Encounter He la Told to Go OSWith aa Good Grace aa PossibleIrishmen Not Good SecondsTo Englishmen dueling is happily alost art but three quarters of a centuryago dueling was sufficiently in vogue toinduce an anonymous writer to publisha book containing much useful information ironically dedicated to DanielOConnell Esq M P and James SilkBuckingham Esq M P as entertaining the opinion first promulgatedby the immortal Falstaff of happymemory that discretion is the betterpart of valorThe author advises all my countrymen who go abroad to use the pistol instead of the sword when they have thechoice of the weapon as the balance ofkilled and wounded is now much in favor of the French who upon the termination of the late war amused themselves by occasionally spitting some halfdozen of our traveling young fashionables before breakfast He recommends Purdey in Oxford street asthe maker of the best dueling pistollocks care in the selection of a stockwhirh tits the hand comfortably and toeschew saw handles Barrels shouldbe ten inches long and half rifledwhich considering that throughout hisvolume he poses as a man of the strictest honor is puzzling for he admitsthat a wholly rifled pistol is consideredan unfair weapon therefore one not appearing to be rifled should be substitutedOn the chances he writes Manya poor long armed straggling fellowhas received the coup di sic coeur orfatal stroke who might still have beenin existence had he known how to protect his person in the field the necessary protection consisting in standingsideways and drawing in the stomachShould the party be hit presumablybecause he could not draw in his stomach he must not feel alarmed Thisseems difficult as a man with a bulletin his stomach can hardly be expectednot to display some little natural anxiety for as is admitted later a shot inthe digestive organs must be particularlv annoying to a bon vivant Toaldermen his advice is the old methodof fighting the back to the adversaryand discharging over the shoulderThe chances of a mans being killedare about 14 to 1 and of his beinghit about 6 to 1 He arrives atthis conclusion by dividing a mansbody when opposed to his adversaryinto nine parts Therefore be says Asin only three of these a wound wouldprove mortal the chances are 3 toI against his being killed and 5 to1 against his being hit that however he hastens to add provided hiantagonist has never read my work Iihe has the case may be different 1The combatant is told not to allowthe idea of becoming a target to makehim uneasy but to treat the matterjocosely He is to laugh away theevening over a bottle of port and playa rubber of whist but he must avoiddrinking to excess or taking any foodthat tends to create bile because bilious objects are not seen either distinctly or correctly This Would rather bea valid reason for getting as bilious aspossible A man with an attack ofjaundice should be invisible and ableI to blaze at his antagonist in perfectsafety If he cannot sleep on retiringto rest he is to read Byrons ChildeHarold His servant is to call him at oand give him a strong cup of coffeei Then he is to smoke a cigar and onhis way to the scene of action he is totake a brandy and soda as a mostgrateful stimulant and correctiveNo wonder our author recommendhim at this point to draw in his stomach If he dies he is to go off with asgood grace as possible On the otherhand if he hits his antagonist he is totake off his hat to him and express rej gretA challenge is not to be in rhymesuch as a certain poetical brandy loving major general of marines wroteto a brother officer who ran off with hiswifeWounds on the flesh a surgeons skill mayhealBut wounded honors only cured with steelAn Irishman is not to be chosen assecond for nine out of ten have such anj innate love of fighting they cannotbring an affair to an amicable adjusti ment and the first duty of a second isto prevent the affair coming to a serious issue Other advice is for the second to take care his principal is not inconvenienced by the sun and to get hisantagonist with something dark behindhim when it will be much more easyto hit himAs may be inferred the author holdsby dueling for the man who fallsin a duel and the individual who iskilled by the overturn of a stagecoachare both unfortunate victims to a practice from which we derive great ad vantagea It would be absurd to prohibitstage traveling because occasionally afew lives are lost by an overturn andunless men endeavored to destroy eachi
