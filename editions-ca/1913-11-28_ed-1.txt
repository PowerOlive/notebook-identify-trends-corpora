Hendricks,In order to prevent the old Confederate soldiers of Kentucky fropa falling into the hands of claim-shaverswith their pension warrants, whichare now due to be sent out, and without any imoney in the State Treasurywiht which to pay them, State Treasurer Thomas Rhea has, after considerable effort, completed arrangementstion to take up every one of the interest-bearingwarrants, totaling thesum of $148,053.34, at their facevalue.The warrants thus to be caredfor are those due November 6 last,and more than a thousand old soldiersI will be benefitted by what the StateTreasurer has accomplished in theface of many difficulties.For months past holders of StateTreasury warrants have had to discount them from one to three perper cent, to 'get cash on them, notwithstanding the fact that they bear5 per cent interest from the Stateand are non-taxable. Last week theboard of one of the public institutionswas unable to secure in Louisvilleor elsewhere in the State money onwarrants even with such a discount.Mx. Hkwt, iras prompted in his endeavors to secure the ready moneyfor the old soldiers by the informa-i tion which came to ' him severalmonths ago, following the first distribution of pension money by theState.At that time old soldiers who wereneedy found themselves forced todiscount their State warrants to localclaim-shavers in the communities, inome instance at a rate of $15 on the$100 claim.He immediately set to work to prevent such a condition when the November irarrants should be issued.When pension day, November 5, camearound, he had not quite perfectedhis plans for handling the warrants,which are the largest yet issued under the Confederate pension act.He decided hat the interest-bearingwarrants be held up several days,and renewed his efforts to get themoney to pay them.This he accomplished last Friday,and tho warrants were mailed out tothe old soldiers from the Treasurer'soffice on Monday.Treasurer Rhea was not ready tothe old soldiers are to send the warrants for payment, but each warrantwill be accampanied by a letter advising the recipients what steps totake to secure the face value of hiswarant. Ho will be enabled to deposit in 3iis home bank for collectionat its face value without discount ofany kind whatever.FORiPhonographASK THE FARMERwho has one, what wonders th Cumberland Telephone worlcs for him.
