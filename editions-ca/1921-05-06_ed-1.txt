The thoroughbred has his charms for us" all todayjost as he did in the days of GeorgeWashington and Andrew Jackson.Both these presidents of the UnitedStates were great lovers of thethoroughbred and loyal supporters ofthe sport of horse racing. They bredand raced their own horses, and history records the fact that the formeracted as a judge at the NewmarketCourse, Charleston, S. C on one occasion. Washington, as we all know,was a noted horseman, who enjoyedhis spirited thoroughbred for ridingand hunting through the field untilvery late in life, and his stable had areputation for the number and qualityof the horses it contained.Andrew Jackson was an enthusiasticpatron of horse racing lwig before hebecame president He maintained aformidable stable, which includedTruxton, a horse of which he was exceedingly proud, and with which hewon the famous match race lor $5000against Greyhound. After his inauguration as president, he brought hishorses to the Capitol, and in 1834trained them in persoa,"Vlce Presidentand Mrr Van Buren often being pres?ent to witness the morning work-outof the horses personally, superintendedby the president, with characteristicimpetuosity and plain speech, for "OldHickory," as history records, "had atemper of his own."13m Washington Course, locatedabout two miles from the Capital, wasbuilt in 1602. The Jockey Club, underwhose auspices it was operated, numbered among its members the most distinctive men of affairs of the day.Racing was regularly attended by thepresidents, from Jefferson to VanBuren. On one occasion John QulncyAdams walked to and from the course,surrounded by the equipages of thewealthy."Generals Washington and Jackson," writes one leading commentator,"are examples of the fondness thatgreat statesmen and military men hareso generally entertained for the horseand sport of the turf. Though equally bold and aggressive riders in thefield.

H. M. Oyer, akenfeter ef the Methodist Episcopal.Cbupda, who was a breeder ofthorooghbred horses and who racedone of them in the name of Ms partner. Col. Geo. Elliott. The reverendgentleman, having been charged wtthhorse racing, was summoned beforethe tribunal and asked if he bad anything to say in his defense ; "nothing,"was his reply, "except that I wosMlike to have you let me know how Ican arrange it for my half of the horseto stand in the stable while Col. Elliott's half is racing. The horse belongs to us jointly. He has the sameright to control him that I have; andhe will race him and I cannot keep himfrom it."Needless to add, Mr. Oyer was dulyacquitted. "The utter absence of prejudiceagainst the turf in earlier days bringsinto sharp contrast' our sporadic latter-dayagitations in disapproval.For example, it is mentioned in theCatholic Churchman, published at Annapolis, in 1744, that among the legitimate pastimes of the population whichmet with the apprpval of the churchitself, was the new' one of racinghorses, which had grown to be highlypopular among the gentry of the country.

Nearly two years ago mystomach became disordered andwhatever I ate pained me for hoursand much of the time I was badlybloated."The pains in my back got worse,so I couldn't stoop in doing my housework and I just suffered all the tijme.Finally I got sd weak and nervousand had such dizzy spells I had togive up my housework altogether."At night I got no sound sleepand frequently felt worse morningsthen whn I went to bed. I sufferedtortures from cramps and pains allover my body and rapidly went downhill. I was so bad off I feared I'dnever get well."As I had tried so many thingswithout getting better my husbandinsisted I should try Tanlac. By thetime I had finished my second bottleI was fast getting better. I havejust finished my tenth bottle andhave no more aches and pains and nomore troubles of any kind.

Mr. Watterson made thestatement in explaining how he acquired a copy of the seal.According to Mr. Watterson, theseal was given by Judah P. Benjamin when he sailed to England, tohis secretary, whose name wasBromwell. While employed in theJaw ofiice of Mr. Watterson's father,in Washington,, the copy was maae,and Bromwell, according to Mr.Watterson, later took the original toEngland with him.Authorities in Confederate historyinRichmondsaid lastmight that theseal was taken to England by J. St.George Bryan, who had a letterfrom the nephew of the engraver,Allen J. Wyon, certifying that theseal was the original. It was presented to the museum, where it nowreposes, in 1912.VERIFY ITThe Proof Is In Paris, Almost Ats ,Your DoorTlie public statement of a Pariscitizen is in itself strong proof for.Paris people, but confirmationstrengthens the evidence.Here is a Paris citizen who tes-tified years ago that Doan's KidneyPills relieved weak kidneys and nowstates the result was permanent.
