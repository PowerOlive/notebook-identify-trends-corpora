WHALEY.
Mr. Horton L. Whaley, aged sixty
four years, died Friday night about
8:30 o'clock ta the Massie Hospital.
Death was caused by paralysis of the
brain.
Mr. Whaley was taken ill about ten
days ago at his home in East Paris,
but upon the advice of his physician,
was removed to the hospital, where he
remained in an unconscious condition
until death.
He was one of the best known and
most highly respected men in the com
munity, correet and upright in all his
dealings, modest and unassuming in
his conduct. He was twice elected
County Surveyor of Bourbon county,
being in office from August, 1882, un
til January, 1895. As a public officer
he was careful and conscientious.
Mr. Whaley was never married. He
is survived by one sister, Mrs. E. Hall,
and three brothers, H. C. Whaley, J.
W. Whaley and T. C. Whaley, all of
Paris. He was a faithful and devoted
member of the Christian Church. The
body was taken to the home of Mr. H.
C. Whaley, on SouthMain street,
where it remained until Sunday after
noon at 2:60 o'clock, when it was ta
ken to Clintonville, where services
were held at the grave in the Clinton
ville Cemetery at 4 o'clock, conducted
by the Rev. W. E. Ellis. The pall
bearers were: William Myall, Perrry
Hutchcraft, B. B. Marsh, E. P. Weath
ers, W.. T. Talbott, J. H. Haggard, S.
L. Weathers and H. C. Parvin.
STOCK AND FARM NOTES
John K. Northcutt of Cynthiana,
breeder of high-class Shorthorn cattle
and Duroc swine, recently purchased a
son of the great King .Cumberland to
head his herd of cattle.
A news dispatch from Sharpsburg
says twodi the best stock sales re
cently reported in that section were
the following sales made Wednesday:
Mr. Hughes Atkinson sold to a West
Virginia party a pair of sixteen-hands-highmare
mules for $550, and J. O.
Ralls sold to T. S. Robertson, of Beth
el, a mare mule colt, three months old,
for $185.
Fifteen hundred hogs were chip
ped from the Glasgow depot one day
last week to the Louisville and Cincin
nati markets. Some two years ago
when so much tobacco was raised in
that section and but little feed was
grown, there was a hog famine in Bar
ren county. When the real conditions
became known the farmers and stock
men became alarmed and many of the
citizens purchased hogs in Illinois, In
diana and Ohio and brought them to
that section. Just how successful
they have been is shown in their ship
ments last week.
Probably the best yield of wheat
in Fayette county, so far reported this
season, was produced on the farm of
A. B. Bateman, who resides six miles
from Lexington, on the Iron Works
pike. Mr. Bateman had his crop
threshed this week, and one piece of
two acres made an average of 40 bush
els to the acre. Another field of six
teen acres showed a yield of 18 bush
els to the acre. The thresher man
who threshed Mr. Bateman's crop
stated that he has been threshing all
over the county, and the forty bushel
yield on Mr. Bateman's place is the
best that he has so far seen or heard
of.

should live it within prison walls.
He was taken to Gov. McCreary by
