Takes His Jags In Transit
The other day I was coming east on
the Baltimore and Ohio railroad said
Mr H T Towns of New York In
the parlor car in which I traveled were
a couple of hilarious New Yorkers who
were spending their money for cham
pagne or at least one of them was with
a liberality that was nigh akin to reck
lessness The number of quart bottles
that they consumed was startling and
every time the colored attendant brought
in a fresh bottle he was presented with
a 1 note Whenever the contents of
one were pretty nearly gone the elder
of the bacchanalians shouted out to the
waiter Who told you to stop bringing
in wine
But along toward evening the sup
ply ran out much to the disgust of the
pair and they had to be content with
high halls cocktails and other plebeian
drinks These were sufficient however
to keep up their spirits and later in
the night 1 could hear them yelling for
another round
The next day the conductor of the
train told me that this couple had been
riding up and down the road for nearly
a week and that they hadnt drawn a
sober breath in all that while It seem
ed that it was the odd way taken by the
senior member to indulge in a spree
He took the younger man along merely
for company and footed all the bills
About once a year the notion took him
to go off on a tear and not wishing to
indulge in inebriation at home he
couldnt think of as good a scheme as
riding continuously on a trunk line
where there would be only strangers to
wonder at his dissipated behavior The
idea of picking a Pullman as the the
ater of a protracted jag struck me as de
cidedly original Washington Post
Time Spent In Shaving
Think of the time lost in shaving
Campbell the poet calculated that a
man who shaves himself every day and
Strained the- Jar
A little old woman with a sharp nose
and sharper tongue was in the country
grocery store buying suppliea Among
other things she brought in from her
cart was a battle scarred jug whioh she
ordered to be filled with treacle
At last when her purchases were
completed she began looking over the
account item by item before payings
Whats this she excJaimed You
have charged me for twe gallons anar
half of treacle
Yes maam
But that jug holds only two gali
3ons
You must be mistaken 1 measured
tire treacle carefully and it took two
gallons and a half to fill it
Well said the old woman with a
fiigh I dont so much mind having to
pay for the treacle but I do object to
having the old jug strained by your
putting iD half a gallon more thaniifc
will hold Strand Magazine

lives to the age Of 70 expends during interesting Parng aphs Gathered By A
his life as much time in the act of shav
ing as would have sufficed for learning
seven languages Southey commenting
on this minuted himself May 15 1830
during the act of shaving and he found
the time employed nine minutes He
neither hurried the operation nor linger
ed about it Listen now to William Cor
bett concerning shaving As it may
cost only about five minutes of time and
may be and frequently is made to cost
30 or even 50 minutes and as only 15
minutes make about a fifty eighth part
of the hours of our average daylight
this being the case this is a matter of
real importance I once heard Sir John
Sinclair ask Mr Cochrane Johnstone
whether he meant to have a son of his
then a little boy taught Latin No
said Mr Johnstone but I mean to do
something a great deal better for him
What is that said Sir John Why
said the other teach him to shave with
cold water and without a glass

Three Centuries Behind Americans
Several papers dealing with the Penn
sylvania coal regions appear in The
Century Henry Edward Rood writing
of A Polyglot Commujaity says
More than one half the total number
of immigrants into the United States are
coming from Austria Hungary Italy
Poland and Russia While official sta
tistics are not available yet careful in
vestigation leads to the belief that per
haps 50 or 60 per cent of arrivals from
the countries mentioned have had no
regular occupation while possibly 30
per cent may have been servants or la
borers iive years ago the Rev Mr
Maujerie himself an Italian in com
pany with the writer made a tour of ob
servation through the Lehigh region of
Pennsylvania and stated that in his
opinion the Italians working there were
about three centuries behind Americans
in their standards of living that is in
their ideas as to foodV clothing shelter
wages work and general intelligence
Since that there has been no im
provement in the class- of immigrants
arriving at our ports
