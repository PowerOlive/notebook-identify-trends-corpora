Home 13-gK ,RBBPVVW i rnmrnmninnnn'ft I'nlnCommittee Investigate Charges. ,The fire committee of the City Councilcomposed ot Councilmen Hinton, Parriah and Brooks, met at the city iialllast night for the purpose of investigating the charges that had been preferred against Henry McGinley, chiefof the fire department, m which it wasalleged that he anpr priated for hisown use and profit certain articles theproperty of the city.From the evidence introduced therewas nothing to indicate that Mr. McGinley had misused the city's propertyand the committee was thoroughly convinced of ihe innocnce of the accusedin regard to the alleged charges. Itwill make a report to this effect atthe next regular meeting uf the Council. A number ot witnesses were in;troduced to testify to the cnargeswhich, it is said, wero preferred byJ. W. Kng, a member ot the department, following an erupton amongjthemembers atfer the appointment ofMcGinley to the office of Chief 'severalweeks ago. At the instance of Kinghe was arretted on a charge of carrying concealed weapons, and was finedin Police Court.Before the Committee King testifiedthat he had not preferred any chargesaganst McGinley, but stated that aportion of a load of hay purchasedfrom Joe Housgton had been disposedof to J, M. Flanagan, through McGinley andjthat a set of harness belonging to the department, at his instance had been sent to Mr. M. J. Murphy. It developed from the testimony ofFlanagan that the hay referred to hadheen purchased by the city from Houston and when it became known thatonly about one half of it could be usedby the department. McG nley prevailedon Flanagan to purchase the remainder which he did, paying Houston forhis portion.According to the testimony of Mr.Murphy the harness was loaned himby McGinley for a few davs and thatit had been returned to the department. Other witnesses examinedwere Chas. Thomas, city electricianand Ed Walsh, an employe of the cityquarry.Hurt in Collision.Chester Rees, of Winchester, suffered painlul injuries Friday night as aresult of a collision wilh a wagon onthe Lexington pike opposite the homeof Mr. J.
