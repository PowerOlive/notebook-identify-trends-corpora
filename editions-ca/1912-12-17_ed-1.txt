The Court ct Appeals rendered a decision some time ago in which thecourt granted Mrs. McClintock adivorce fram bed and board and awarded her alimony in the sum of $100 amonth. The defendant was severalweeks behind in the payment of alimony. Judge Kerr directed that Mr.McClintock pay 100 immediately andthat another payment of $200 be madeon or before January 1. In responseto the rule Col. John'R. Allen, representing Mr. McClintock, admitted thatMr. McCJintock was behind in payment ofalimony in the sum of about$600. He stated that about threeweeks ago Mr. McClintock paid hiswife $100 and said that the reason thatbe had not paid the remainder wasthat he did not have the money onhand. Col. Allen also stated that Attorney Maury Kemper, representingMrs. McClintock. had put the motionon the docket without consulting JudgeGeorge C. Webb and Robert Talbott,other attorneys for Mrs. McClintock.In response to the rule Mr. McClintock filed an affidavit stating that heis indebted to the Agricultural Bankof Pans, notes and overdrafts in thesum of $8,221; that he owes his sister$1,500, Judge Denis Dundon $1,500for legal services in damage suits andother debts including attorney's feesfor his wife amountnig to about$12,000.Attorney Kemper in arguing themotion stated that Mrs. McClintockwas without money to meet her boardDill and other expenses, that she waacompelled to have money to supporttheir child and that she was compelledto seek the court for relief. Mr.Kemper said that he disclaimed nowinganything about the straitened circumstances of Mr. McClintock.Card o!
