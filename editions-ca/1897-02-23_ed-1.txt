coast wasoften applied to him there is littledoubt but that his heard was a falseone and worn only on occasions whenlie was willing to be recognized as thepirate captain Undoubtedly he oftenvisited cities and plantations on oursouthern coast and there laid his plansfor a raid which soon followedThe fact as related in regard to hiskidnaping negroes from planters of onesection and selling them to those of another is traditional So also is the Sanlomingo episode in which the readerfirst makes the acquaintance of BlackBeardTie undoubtedly successfully cleanedout the vaults of several banks

to wear and rot away beenrecovered and the frame reclothed withCarolinas pine many times but beneath the covering of to dav stands thesame old frame and in the same locationas it stood in the troublous days of theAmerican revolutionTrue the time worn floors that werepressed in turn by the feet of a Cornwallis and a Washington have been replaced by others but underneath thesills and girders that supported it restto day as stanch and true as they didwhen placed there a century and a quarter ago and testify to the enduranceof Carolinas pineThe rooms that in the days of longgone by have echoed alike with thelaughter and revelry of British sons anddaughters and the music of Sambo andCuffy as they called all hands roundpromenade all while the sons anddaughters of the Tar Heel state

Most Important Factor imthe MarriagesNever during its existence has Indiabeen so rich in jewelry as now Thepeople are always adding to their stockSavings from nearly all sources are disposed of in this way and these savingsare being constantly made of ten at theexpense of clothing sometimes at theexpense of greater necessities of lifeThe making and the storing away ofwealth in this form is the national peculiarity of the countryJewelry is regarded as the most stablekind of wealth and fortunes are nevercounted without estimating the valueof the stock of jewelry It can always bepledged or disposed of The marketfor its sale is never closed and neverdepressed The most ignorant nativewho wishes to sell a piece of jewelryknows its market value quite wellHe can scarcely be cheated- Jewelry forms the greatest factor inmatrimony The most lowly bride hasher stridham which is occasionallyequal in value to five years income ofthe bridegroom There is often ascarcity of clothing sometimes ascarcity of cooking pots generally nota jjarticle of furniture but nearly always a stock of jewelry The wife thathas no jewelry possesses nothing elseshe cannot be robbed The family thatdoes not have jewelry is absolutely indigentOne of the greatest boasts of the jewelry owner is that his hoards cannot betaxed A man may own jewelry valuedat a lakh of rupees and xay no incometax This is a source of great satisfaction Jewelry yields no recurring income but it is prized more than government paper If it never increasesit never dkninishes is a national sayingcommon among men and women alikeNo native marriage except among themost impoverished takes place without a transfer of jewelry and very frequently of new jewelry Detroit FreePress0A POETS KINDNESSEagene Fields Way of Helping the Unfortunate- A story has been going the roundsof the newspapers which is partlytrue but it puts facts in a false lightas stories always do when only halftold It was originally printed severalyears ago and ran as follows MrsField had load by enough money to paythe quarterly installment upon MrFields life insurance and she handedhim the sum to make the payment Onhis way downtown he met a man whohad a large collection of butterfliesconsisting of S00 specimens which sofascinated Mr Field that he forgot ailabout the life insurance and immediately purchased the entire collectionThe truth is that Mr Field did startout to pay for or buy something whichwas needed but not to make a life insurance-payment Also he did meetan old jnan with a collection of butterflies The old man was a gentlemanhe knew a friend who had lost hiswife and two children Besides theweek before the house with all itscontents had been destroyed by fireThe man was absolutely without meanshome or friends He happened to havethe butterflies left as at the time ofthe fire fltej were in the house of afriend When Mr Field returned hesaid viI did not want the butterflies butI had to give that poor old man themoney and he would not take it unless I accepted the collectionIt was simply one more instance ofthe fact that the gentle hearted poetcould not leave a friend in misery whilehe had the money in his pocket to helphim Martha Nelson Yenowine in StNicholasWhat the Vatican ContainsOn the whole the Vatican may be divided into seven portions These arethe pontifical residence the Sistineand Pauline chapels the picture-galleriesthe library the museums ofsculpture and archaeology the outbuildings including the barracks ofthe Swiss guards and lastly the gardens with the popes casino Of thesethe Sistine chapel the galleries and museums and the library are incomparabty the most important The nameSistine is derived from Sixtus IVas has been said The library was founded by Nicholas V whose love of bookswas almost equal to his passion forbuilding The galleries are representative of Raphaels work which predominates to such an extent that the paintings of almost all other artists are ofsecondary importance precisely asMichelangelo filled the Sistine chapelwith himself As for the museums theobjects they contain have been accumulated by many popes but their existence ought perhaps be chiefly be attributed

orSectional XQnterprlse -The prime object of the TennesseeCentennial and International exposition to be held at Nashville from May 1to October 30 1897 is to celebrate theone hundredth anniversary of the statein a spirit of patriotism to illustratethe progress that has been made incivilization and at the same time tocall attention to the bountiful resourcesof the field the hills and the forestsof Tennessee The fact that the stateproduces to some extent every cropreported in the United States censusand contains iron coal marble granite hardwood timber and phosphaterock for fertilizers in unlimited quantities that the agricultural crops neverfail and seldom vary and that the climate is perfect with a mean temperature of 5S degrees should induce immigration from other states and from foreign countries to such an extent thatTennessee will take the place in thelist of states in which she properly belongs in point of population and commercial importance It is to call attention to her natural advantages and resources and lead to their greater development of wealth as well as to showthe progress that has been made in thearts and sciences that this great object lesson is to be givenIt is a practical way of celebrating agreat event and will enable the peopleof the state to present at one and thesame time their historical record of100 years and to give their reasons forbelieving that Tennessee is an invitingfield for the investment oF eapital anda pleasant country in which all maylive in the enjoyment of peace andplentyThe state will no doubt derive greatbenefits from the exposition It will a Ileast bring her own people and herneighbors of the south if not of thewhole country closer together andshow what can be done by concertedaction Whatever may be said of theconservatism or lethargy of the southern people it must be acknowledgedthat the spirit of enterprise whichtfrrVrjnany previous exposition the worldfair alone excepted but there areother attractions which will have a determining influence upon those who arein doubt whether they shall go to Nashville or not Nashville and in fact thewhole state of Tennessee is historicalground and all northern soldiers whohave not visited the south since the closeof the war will want to avail themselves of the opportunity of doing soduring the present year of nationalpeace and political tranquillity Withinsight of the exposition grounds almostwas fought the battle of Nashville andupon the very ground now known as Ex-position park the soldiers of the northpitched their tents The present homeof the vice president of the Tennesseecentennial Mr Van Leer Kirkman andhis wife the president of the womansdepartment of the centennial situatedabout four and a half miles from Nash-ville on the Franklin turnpike was thescene of the battle of NashvilleIn the southern suburbs of thecity is Fort Negley What is- novvknown as the Hermitage club in thecenter of the city was used as the headquarters of Buell and Rousseau ofGrant and Thomas The Maxwellhouse then not quite finished now oneof the leading hotels of the south wasused by the federal soldiers as a barracksIn every part of the city there are objects to remind the visitor and particularly the old soldier of the stirringtimes from J 801 to 1805 Although thescene of so much activity during the rebellion Nashville was spared theravages of war and as a result the cityand surrounding country presents today the best picture of southern lifeto be found anywhere south of Masonand Dixons line Of course Nashvillehas witnessed many changes but theyhave been generally for the better frocity in the south has made more substantial progress or done more to improve the conditions of life In themost trying times of general financialdepression Nashville suffered greatlybut the inherent wealth of thetry surrounding it greatly mitigated theevils and disasters of the panic of 1893and she is holding her own to day withas firm a grasp as any of the northerncitiesAs a great seat of learning Nashvillehas far outstripped all of her sistercities of the south and by common consent is known as the Athens of theI South Not only has the progress inTHE TENNESSEE BUILDINGconceived and made it possible to carryout the plans of this exposition havenever been equaled in any city in thiscountryThe great burden of responsibilityand expense of this enterprise hasfallcnupon the city of Nashville and without the aid of any other city countyor state she has raised over 500000which sum has been expended uponthe beautiful grounds and magnificentbuildings which stand to day in testimony of the faithful discharge of dutyon the part of the exposition managers to the state and to the wholecountry Whatever more may be needed to complete the plant and to puteverything in order for the openingday will be furnished by Nashvillespatriotic citizens The appropriationmade by the United States governmentwill be used exclusively for the erectionof a building- and tor the exhibit of thegovernment and will be no part of thecost of the exposition proper Thesame may be said of the appropriationsmade by several states and oT some ofthe counties of Tennessee whose buildings will be for their exclusive use andbenefitThe exposition is not a local or sectional enterprise It has been handsomely recognized by the United Statesgovernment nearly every state in theunion will be represented and some ofthe finest buildings and most attractivedisplays will be those from foreigncountries It will probably not beequal in all respects to the worlds fairat Chicago but it is the opinion of menfrom all parts of the country who haveseen the Nashville exposition in itspresent unfinished condition and whohave visited all the greater expositionsthat it will be second only to that ofChicago and that the architecture andthe artistic grouping of the buildingsis more pleasing to the eye and on thewhole more satisfactory to the visitorThe scope of the exjOsition is comprehensive and the extent and variety ofthe exhibits will leave nothing to be desiredNo writer can convey to the readerwho has not beheld the glory of thispicture the least conception of itsgrandeur and magnificence Whateveridea the reading public may gain fromthe descriptions or even from the pictures of the buildings and their harmonious grouping and pleasing surroundings there will still be a pleasantsurprise for all those who may see itfor the first time in its completenessandituUtiT lis oj buthe education of the white race beenmarked but what lias been done for theadvancement of the colored race is viiliout a parallelThe country surrounding Nashville isnot unlike the famous Blue Grass region of Kentucky The soil is perhapsnot so rich but it is undulating andmore picturesque and it is always wellwatered it resembles the Blue Grassregion of Kentucky also iu that it is agreat stock raising country The mostfamous stock farm in the world is theBelle Meade which lies within a halfhours ride through a beautiful countryand over a well made road from the exposition grounds In fact this beautiful old time place can be reached by railin ten minutesMr George W Chambers of St Louisan artist of considerable distinction recently visited Nashville and after returning to his home wrote a letter toa friend in that city giving some ofhis impressions of the exposition fromwhich the following extract is takenIt is a pleasure to give jou however briefly the impressions I receivedfrom a visit to the centennial grounds1 was surprised to find the buildingsand the grounds as well so far advanced Indeed from the cleau condition of the roadways and grass platsone might with reason conclude thatall inside as well as outside was inreadiness for public scrutiny Thegrounds seemed to me to be admirablylaid out both for convenience in getting about and for the best presentation of the architectural effects Thestretches of lawn which spring willdress in living- green will be a featurewhich was much lacking at the worldsfair and will add a repose so muchneeded in a white city whose architecture is more or less rigidly classicThere were not many places ak Chfcago for the eye to rest upon in detail and none at all in the general effect It was too literally a cityIn your coming lair all this will bedifferent if one may judge from thepresent condition of affairs Of courseas yet one misses the color effect whichwill so much enhance the beauty of itall The flower beds to break the greenhere and there and perhaps a

iifJJias foils for the straight architecturaland structural lines necessary in thebuildingsOf the buildings already completedit would be invidious to speak comparatively and indeed unnecessarywhere all is so admirably planned anddesigned And yet I cannot omit abrief word concerning the ParthenonNot in its praise for it needs nonenor of its history for that is tritenor yet of the wisdom of choosing itas being adapted to the purposes forthat will be evident to all who enterit The thought I had in looking atit was that strangely enough it wouldperhaps be less of a surprise to southern visitors than other buildings commonplace enough in all respects Itwill be perfectly familiar to them andthat not because they have seen pictures of it but because south of theMason and Dixon line this is the typeof architecture that was chosen forthe stately homes as well as for stateand public buildings That choice ofthe classic Greek for all importantwork domestic and national is distinctly the choice of the south Itwould seem that approaching theparallel of Athens in this country itwas a sine qua non to follow its architecture But however that may beand whatever the cause it will chancethat the southern contingent will lookwith familiar eyes upon the grandrepose of the Parthenon Of course noone is going to bother himself aboutwhat it all means because we will all betoo busy looking at and enjoying thebeauty provided for us by the splendidenergy and self sacrifice of your people But it might furnish a half hour apleasant reflection in some shady corner to note first that this same Parthenon seems externally to be the mostconsistent building on the groundsand to consider after whether the largesimplicity the wide repose and the impressive stability of it did not somehow belong to that old life from Virginia downwards which can never comeagain There is at all events and therewill not be a visitor from all the fairold southland that cannot recall it the-same

more Hesaw in her face much that he had notseen in the picture She parted herhair in the middle and she had a StCecelia nose so that the young mandid not observe that there was alsomuch in the picture that was not in herface She could noteven play the pianobefore which she had posedThe idle young woman loved seriously nothing whatever Least of all didshe love the serious young man Ifhe had no surface she was all surfacelike a brook all waves full of light andbrightness The young man was attracted by the waves and imagined adepth beneath them She was repelledby the darkness of his depth and couldimagine no waves upon its surface Sowhen he asked her to say Yes she answered No He suffered greatly andafter a time he died and he went topurgatorySome months later she caught pneumonia at a dance and she went to purgatory too She found him seated ata glistening dinner table paying compliments and telling funny stories to awoman in a decollete gown The womanshe recognized as the head of the missionary society in her former homeOf all people she exclaimed Howdo they ever come to be doing thatshe asked the keeper They are doingpenance for having been bores on earthand they arc learning

at the table for the light and dashof his talk attracted her and she tookfor granted a depth beneath themBut he loved her not at all and thoughthow dull and unresponsive she hasgrown She might take

willmaintain them at less cost than the mudroads with all their inconveniencesare maintained in their wretched condition The work required by law ofable bodied men together with theroad tax gives to the road supervisorsof our state the expenditure in moneyand labor of a vast sum Much of thisis wasted by reason of incompetentmanagement The railroad tax forhighway improvement in some roaddistricts

Produce It1 Bitter milk has three causes something eaten by the cow advanced periodof gestation and pure cussedness It isnot a pleasant thing to contemplatebut there is a great deal of horse manure eaten by cows The best wayafter regulating the ration is to fenceoif a part of the yard and put the horsemanure in it or else fence off the cowsI have read that rag weed would causebitter milk but as my cows wouldnever eat it I cannot say anything frommy own experience on that scoreFor the second cause there is no curethat I am aware of and the third is almost as hard to prevent Briefly statedin its natural state milk after a certain time gets sour because of the actionof a certain kind of bacteria whose business it is to make milk sour But ifthese bacteria are prevented from getting in their work owing to cold weather they work only in warm weather orin a warm temperature then naturewhich abhors even a vacuum of bacteriaimmediately sets another gang of bacteria to work wThose job it is to makemilk bitter And if xaoliticians attendedto their job as well as bitter bacteria totheirs we would be much better off forit takes much work to persuade them toquit work The remedy is first to washwith boiling water every vessel withwhich the milk or cream comes in contact or better still put the vessels inboiling water on the stove for 10 or 15minutes This kills off all the bitterbacteria Then to get the sour bacteriato work for a few days keep all the milkat a temperature of 70 degrees and puta little sour buttermik in the creamThis will give the sour bacteria achance to get firmly established Thendo not let the mik get too cold or itwill all have to be done over again Astwo sets of bacteria cannot get along atthe same time the bitter bacteria giveup the job National

ParmerPRISON LABOR PROBLEMHoavto Avoid Competition Between Convict and STree LaborThe prison labor problem presentsdifficulties at every turn The abolition of the contract system of disposing of prison labor was undoubtedly awise step but it by no means effected asolution of the problem The competition of prison made goods with theproduct of free labor is a bad thingyet it must be remembered that the convicts can scarcely be employed at allwithout competing more or less withoutside labor In the nature of thingsthis must be so If the convicts werenot in prison they would be at workoutside competing with other laborersSeeing the demoralizing effect upon themarket of prison made goods leaders oforganized labor have asked that convicts be employed in making goods foruse by the state and its political subdivisions In accord with this suggestion which has decided merits GovTanner has recommended that convictsbe employed in making text books foiuse in the public schools And naturally enough though certainly inconsistent at a meeting at which the general policy of employing prisoners inthe manufacture of goods for the statewas commended the particular proposition to employ them in making textbooks was condemned by the representation of the printers that was in attendance This episode serves to illustrate the difficulty and complexity ofthe problem and should inspire in alla spirit of toleration in considering thesubjectThe only way prisoners can beployed without competing directly withfree labor is to put them to work on public improvements that could not be constructed for years to come but for theutilization upon them of labor of thissort In this way there may be securedimprovements of inestimable value forall time that the public might not havefelt warranted in constructing underother circumstances There is no doubtthat good roads would be worth almosrany amount to a community but it ispractically impossible to get taxingbodies to take from the people the sumsnecessary for their construction Making of good roads would be in many respects ideal employment for a portionof the states convicts and the proposition so to employ them lias been revivedin New York The chief objection tathe plan peculiarly enough is a sentiment one It is argued that the popular sense would revolt at the sightof convicts under guard at work in thepresence of the public This objectionhas some weight but it should not bemade to appear insuperable ChicagoRecord- - - - --- i twiinsrsatt rniuwCTmtfHEi ra srrasBE jmvu PBBsaBnpsaTHE BOURBON NEWS TUESDAY FEBRUARY 23 1897THE GERMAN CARPIts Introduction in American Waters TVaaa Great MistakeA recent dispatch from SwedesboroK J announced the poor success of2arp fishing in the tide water streamsthis winter The few fish taken it wasreported were small and not marketable The scarcity of carp this seasonin the South New Jersey streams is attributed to the great catches of lastyearThose who have studied the habits ofthe carp and become convinced of itsdestructiveness with respect to otherfishes will rejoice at the possibility ofits extermination from American waters There is an act of the New Jersey legislature which imposes a heavyfine on any person who introduces German carp into the waters of that stateThe coming Pennsylvania legislaturewould do well to enact a similar lawMore than a year ago the state boardoffish commissioners after a careful investigation came to the conclusion thatthe presence of German carp in our waters is detrimental to the increase ofmuch better food fishes and decided todiscontinue their distribution Thecommissioners of game and fisheries oiNew York reached an identical decisionabout the same timeFor years the United States fish commission defended the introduction ofthe German carp and advocated itswider distribution in the face of overwhelming evidence of its insatiablespawn eating habits this was perhapssince that body was first responsible ferits general planting in American waters but the present commissionerCommander Brice is actuated by nosuch considerations and when he wasconfronted with the proofs of the undesirability of the carp immediatelyordered further output to be stoppedThe carp may be a good food fish inGermany but if so it has sadlydeteriorated in this country Asa table food it is pronounced scarcely better than our American sucker many indeed regard the latter as much better for eating purposes Wherever it has gained afoothold far better food fishes rapidlydecrease in number through the formerdevouring the eggs of the latter Itsfilth loving habits foul clear water andimpart a muddy disagreeable taste toits flesh Except for its rapid growththere does not seem to be a single quality to recommend it thus it is a matterfor congratulation that there are signsof its becoming scarce in the Delawareriver and tributariesWithout exception our Americanfresh water fishes qre better thanthose which have been introduced fromforeign countries and it would be wellfor the United States fish commissionand the different state bodies to discourage any further foreign introductions Far from the New Jersey fishermen advocating their legislature to prohibit carp fishing for two years asis reported to be the case now that theyhave a prospect of getting rid of it theyhad better urge the legislature- to increase the penalty in force against anyperson who may plant more Philadelphia LedgerA TERRAPINS LOVE OF HOMECaught Marked and Released ThreeTimes it Returns to Its AbodeThe devotion of a land terrapin to itshome is well illustrated by a story fromPaoli Ind In 1840 Miss Davie Peele ofthat city was ten years old While playing in the woods one day she came uponone of the creatures and took it homeIts curious ways pleased her and sheput it in a box to keep as a pet- Thelittle prisoner refused food and chafedat confinement As the 30 ung lady wasabout to release the terrapin some onesuggested that she carve her name inits shell She did this adding thedate The little animal was let goTen years later Miss Peele marriedCounty Clerk Wible of Orange countyOne day she found herself in the vicinity where she had first discovered theterrapin To her great surprise sheagain found the little fellow within afew feet of where she first saw it Hexname and the date were as plain as whenshe put them there The terrapin wasagain made prisoner to show herfriends the marvelous find Againtracing her new name on the shell shereleased her captive The date 1850was put onAfter many years Mrs Wible becamea widow and removed to HutchinsonIvan There she married Dr McKmneyand still resides thereIn the summer of 1872 Mrs MeKinneyvisited her old home at Paoli A searchagain revealed the terrapin at its firstabode Again she carved her changedname on the shell It was the talk olthe little town Returning to her western home Mrs Mrfxinnev thought littleof her terrapin until a friend in 3895sent her a copy of a local paper containing the facts The terrapin had beenagain found and the date 1805 carvedon its back It was found right whereit had been first discovered bjr MissPeele Each time it had been releasednear the center of the little town andfound its way to its original homeN Y WorldA Useful MapA school inspector having a few minutes to spare after examining the schoolput a few questions

ofWeil KnownRailroad EngineerWhat Built Him Up AgainF om the Qazctte Chillicotlie OhioMr Elbridge Waterman is a well knownrailroad engineer of the Baltimore and OhioSouthwestern Railway who has been agreat sufferer from nervous debility of anaggravated kind lor the past ten years Thestrain was telling on his nerves terriblyand steady work was impossible The following is his storyFor the past ten years he said I havesuffered as few men have with nervousness heart trouble and rheumatism I havelived on the footboard most of my life andthe constant jolting and nervous strainslowly but surely undermined my constitution I was forced to quit work and thereseemed to be little prospect of my goingback to the throttle agaiu I tried everyremedy that I could find but none ofthem did me any good I consulted doctorsall over the country but to no avail I wouldbe better for a time and then would comeon an attack more severe than ever and Iwould have to quit work The money Ihave spent during that time for doctors andmedicine none of which did me anvmauent good would place me now out ofvvaub auu m ijuiuparauve uuiuence 11 x naait An idea of how much time and money Ilost may be gained when I tell you that during last summer alone I was totally unableto work four months on a stretch and wasmuch of the time confined to the hbusej andto the bed sometimes unable to move Itmakes me cold all over when I look back onwhat I have gone throughBut rheumatism wa3 not the onlv thincrI suffered from My heart troubled me verymuch and I was totally unable to sleep fordays and weeks at a time When I woulddrop off into a doze my heart would 1eatitself almost out of my bosom and wouldwake me up as though I had been struck bya trip hammer I had twitchings in myarms and legs and was altogether in suchjacondition that my wife and friends began toconsider me beyond reach of medical assistanceI was almost of the same opinion myself when I happened to see in the paperlast June a letter from an old soldier iu thewest who had been cured of rheumatism byDr Williams Pink Pills The testimonialwas written in such a way that I knew itwas not a faked up one and I determined togive this medicine a fair trial I was unable to work at the time and almost in despair So I went to the drug store andbought six boxes of theni in order to givethem a thorough test ana in a few days Ibegan to feel the improvement they wereworking in my system In two weeks Iwas able to go to work and I have workedever since without a lay off which is something I have not done 01 yearsThe first improvement I noticed was inmy heart which grew more and more normal in its action until at last it did nottrouble me at all and I was able to sleep asI had not been able for ten years The hearttrouble has never returned and my sleepfor the past two months has been healthyand deep Last night 1 went to bed earlyand slept soundly until eight oclock thismorning And now when 1 wake up I feeliuvigorated and ready for the days workjust as I used to feel when I was a boyThe nervous twitchings were also curedin a short time and have never returned orbothered me in the least since This hasalso been a great relief to me as the twitchings were very annoying as well as an indication to everyone of the terrible conditionin which my state of health was And thegreatest wonder of all is that the rheumatismseems to be cured alsp and does not botherme in the least any more except when I expose myself unduly and even then only fora short time Iconsider myself -a well mannow and hope to continue so I am stilltaking Pink Pills for I want the cure to bea -complete and permanent one I only wishI had known them years ago for I wouldhave saved myself large sums of money aswell as suffering for which no money couldrepayDr
