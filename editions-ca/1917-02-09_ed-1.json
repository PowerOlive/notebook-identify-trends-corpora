ANNOUNCEMENT.
Is the one-cent paper to be a passing
fad in lilie United States? The Phila
delphia papers, without exception, we
believe, have returned to higher prices,
and Philadelphia is the third American
city in population. 1 he Buffalo papers
bolted the one cent platform recently
in a body. Some of the New York pa
pers are showing signs of nervousness
and talking very gravely about the
cost of white paper.
It has not been long since nobody
thought of getting a first class news
paper for less than five cents and the
circulation of many of the Southern
papers was as large at five cents as it
has been recently at three, two or even
one cent. The Hearst papers in New
York built up a tremendous circulation
while charging one cent for a copy
and papers like the World, the Times
and the Herald fell in line. The price
was experimental and it seems not im
probable that the experiment will be
declared a failure.
