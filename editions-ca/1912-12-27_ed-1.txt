Four men werein the parts that did the shooting andafter the shot was fired all of themran down Tenth street and disappeared. The bullet from the revolver tookeffect in Bowles' right side, passingbetween two of his libs, narrowly missing his right lung and lodged in hisback. He was taken to the b'ordhamhotel where Dr. George Rankin wassjmmoned to attend his injuries.According to the statement ofBowles he was walking in the direction of the denot, having left theI saloon of John Johnson at the coinerof Tenth and Main at twelve o'clock,lie ssid that four men, all of whomwt.ru unknown to him, walking in thesame direction passed him on the pavement and when a few feet in front oneof the number turned, drew a revolver,and fired point blank at him.He said that no remarks were exchanged between he and the men andthe shooting was without provocation.Several persons in the neighburhoodheard the shot but as there had been"a large amount of fireworks explodedin that locality, nothing was thoughto the report, and it was supposed itwas a cannon cracker or a giFnt torpedo. Pedestiians passing in thatdirection shortly after the shootingfound Bowles suffering intensely fromthe wound, ana he was taken to theFordham Hotel.Mrs. Bowles, his wife, was notifiedof the shooting yesterdav morning andshe came to Paris on the early train tobe with her husband until he is able tobe removed to his home inCvnthiana.While the wound is in a dangerouslocality the nature of it is such as tocause little alarm. Unless complications arise he wili soon recover fromthe injury.This is the second serious accidentBowles has sustained in the pastyear. Recently he fell from a trainat Lair Station striking on his faceand destroying the sight of his r.ghteve. He was confined in the hospitalat Cynthiana for several weeks as aresult of this accident.A very vague description of themen who were in the party a memberof which did the shooting was giventhe police by Bowles and an effort isbeing made to locate thp guilty man.r"WE KNOW HOW"IxmmMmBtMMftWmmmW'krsimwSKSSSitt3&i3&;&3&!$fi&U4&2U&9Mt&fS3Sn&&Tfeves-feV47,&!ill.iSfcillmW$cHi3faSUfcakiSS4SSriA "T.-J"A."

NETTLESHIP."I don't see what" in the world weshall ever do with all our things,"sighed Mrs. Hemming when she andher husband decided, after much discussion, to move from their house,which was too lonesomely big nowthat the children had all gone awayto homes of their own. "Our apartment won't begin to hold our furnuJture,-to say nothing of all the thingswe have stored in theattic.""Pick out the furniture youneedand then turn a second-hand manloose in the house," suggested Hemming."But, Charles, you wouldn't want meto sell all our old keepsakes, wouldyou?""Most assuredly. What earthly useto any one are a lot of old books,vases and pictures that no one everlooks at except at house cleaningtime. Do they do anybody any good?""No, I don't suppose they do," reluctantly admitted Mrs. Hemming, "butI hate to part with some of them."That's just sentiment, my dear. Thefact is, it will be a relief to you whenyou are rid of all that old lumber.""Perhaps I could select just a fewof the oldest things and we could putthem in the storeroom of the apartment. You know there's a nice bigstoreroom, Charles.""Yes, I know it, Harriet, and I'mplanning to keep my golf clubs thereand my fishing tackle. So if youplease, we won't fill up that storeroomwith a lot of useless trash."After the second-hand dealer's visitHemming said to his wife: "I hopeyou were sufficiently strong-minded tolet everything in the attic go?""Well, nearly everything," answeredMrs. Hemming. "There are a few little articles that it seems a shame tosell, such as ""Never mind enumerating them,Harriet. I shouldn't be interested ina list of crippled furniture or ancientphotograph albums.""But what I thought of keeping wasthe two old ""Now, Harriet, we decided to getrid of all our old stuff. Don't let Hankins leave a thing tomorrow when hecomes with his wagons."When the wagons drove away loaded with furniture and bric-a-brac,mostly of a peculiarly inartistic period, Mrs. Hemming laughed awayher regrets. "Charles was right," shesaid to herself. 'It would have beensilly to keep that ugly trumpery."About a fortnight after they weresettled in their apartment, Hemmingcame home one afternoon carrying alarge box."I have a little present for you, Harriet," he said with boyish pleasure."You'll be surprised when you seewhat it is. I was passing Devlin's antique shop this morning when somethings in the windows caught my eyeand took me back about 40 years togreen glass lamps. There, my dear,large green glass lamps of old-fashionedshape and decoration. "Do theymake you think of anything, Harriet?" "Yes, they do they make me thinkof a lot of things," she" answered."How much did you pay for them?""Devlin let me have them cheap.You see, one of his collectors pickedthem up for litle or nothing in an old,out-of-the-way Vermont- farmhousewhere antiques aren't appreciated, sohe sold me the pair for $20. Really,Harriet, I'd have given $30 if he'dasked it.""Well, I'm glad he didn't ask it,"replied Mrs. Hemming, "for I soldthese same lamps to Hankins threeweeks ago for $1 apiece.""Great Scott! Are you sure they'rethe same lamps?""Of course I'm sure. I'd know themif you bought them in Egypt. I wasbrought up under those lamps.""A dollar apiece! And I snappedthem up for $20 the pair!" musedHemming, trying not to look sheepish."Yes, and I'm glad you did," responded Mrs. Hemming. "For theywere what I hated to part with most.I wanted to keep them and I'm awfullyglad to have them back."Turk With Wife Would Be Safe.Montenegro is the only country inEurope where a wife may be regardedas a perambulating life insurance policy. The Montenegrin is intensely chivalrous. Respect for women is carriedto such a pitch that although the veryword Turk affects the native as a redrag does a bull, yet a Turkish travelerfinding himself in the wilds of Montenegro would be absolutely safe if hewere accompanied by his wife.Life is patriarchal. There are notowns, only villages. There are villages of half a dozen houses, in eachof which three and sometimes fourgenerations of a family live together.Travels, in spite of this patriarchallife, find the men gloomy and taciturn,with their eyes open for treachery andtheir right hand on their revolver.London Daily Mirror.Make Living by "Poking Fires."One occupation by which a score ofBritons are said to earn their livelihood is that of "poking fires."

The building. GOO feet in length from northto south, will be semicircular in form and w.ill have as its central motive a low dome arising from a unique base. Forming tbe foreground will be a great lagoon surrounded on three sides by a sunkengarden, which will be designed in romantic Italian architecture. Herewill be assembled the notable paintings of history."Good night," said the young man.But he made no move from the farcorner of the divan where he wasj seated.The young woman sitting with herhead obstinately turned from himmoved it back perhaps half an inch."What are you going for?" she demanded. "Well," said the young man, "Igathered from your last set of remarks that you could breathe morefreely if the atmosphere of the roomwere not contaminated by my presence that there would be more spaceto turn around if the place were notcluttered up by undesirable commodities. In short, I rather figured it outthat it was a hint for me to leave!""I'm sure," said the young woman,"that I don't want you to stay Ifyou'd rather go! I wouldn't keepyou for a minute against your will. Itcertainly shows when you eagerlyseize upon the simplest remarks andtwist them about to suit your ovnconvenience that you are looking fora chance to escape! Don't let me detain you, I beg!""Oh, you aren't detaining me," theyoung man assured her. "Before I goI'd like to point out that you arein error when you call your remarkssimple. They wrere not. On the contrary, they were exceedingly forcefuland emphatic."While those remarks were clear inmeaning they were complicated in design you started on one topic andincluded sixteen others in the samesentence so I am rather proud thanotherwise that I was able to make out'precisely what you meant. It provesto me that I have at least brainsenough to come in out of the rain. Irather doubted this at first in the faceof what you said. But I couldn't goaway and leave you laboring under thedelusion that you had something tosay that was entirely ineffective andsimple. What you said hit the spot!""I don't know what you are talkingabout!" said the young woman. "Isuppose you think you are funny!""Funny!" the young man echoed inhollow tones. "What do you think Iam? Do I impress you as the sort ofperson who would dance and sing athis own funeral? Why should I bemirthful at having received my walking papers?""I hate slang," observed the youngwoman. "Don't be silly. I never saidanything like that."The young man shook his head ina resigned manner. "Don't draw outthe agony for me, Genevieve," he said."It's cruelty to attempt to smotherthe blow. Having given it, why attempt to feed me chocolate drops?As I said some time ago, good night!""I wish you wouldn't be so foolish,"said the young woman, turning cleararound toward him.

In life there is nocreature so degraded but knows fullwell which is the noble and beautifulthing that he should do; but this noble, beautiful thing is not strongenough within him. It is this invisiblebut abstract strength that it must beour endeavor to increase first of all.And" thus strength increases only inthose who have acquired the habit ofresting more frequently than othersupon summits where life absorbs thesoul, upon heights whence we see thatevery actjand every thought is infallibly bound up with something greatand immortal." Chicago EveningPost. 'London. The numerous large andvaluable rolls of historical papyri recently discovered by Robert De Rustafjaell, F. R. G. S., have now beenbrought to England. Mr. De Rustafjaell has allowed an inspection ofthe rolls, which are certain to createconsiderable interest in the scientificworld. They were unearthed by afellah while sinking the foundation ofhis mud-hut near a temple of thePtolemies in Upper Egypt, and areof the Greco-Egyptian period.There are seventeen of them. Theyare about twelve inches wide, allclosely rolled,- and some are as muchas four inches in diameter. The sizeof the largest probably will be foundto be about fifty feet, which would bea record length for a roll of papyri.The rolls probably are the mostnearly perfect ever found."It should be borne in mind," saidMr. De Rustafjaell, "that Manetho,the Greek historian, who lived probably about the time that these manuscripts were written, gave us a history of Egypt, and the only framework we possess of the order andnumber of dynastic reigns."With the discovery of the RosettaStone we obtained the long-lost keyto the language of ancient Egyptians.We think that we are justified in anticipating further and possibly morestartling revelations from these manuscripts." Mr. De Rustafjaell had the good fortune about four years ago to lightupon the find of papyri which werepublished in an interesting bookcalled "The Light of Egypt" At thetime they were popularly referred toas "Further New Sayings of Christ."One volume only, however, dealt withthe subject. It proved to be SaintBartholomew's apocryphal narrativeby Christ of his descent into hell.This is the only authentic literatureextant on which, the Litany is basedin the passage referring to the descent into hell.USE LIQUOR TO QUENCH FIREGuests at Coney Island Pour "FireWater" on Burning Paper Bitsand Save Structure.New York. Wine and beer weresubstituted for water in extinguishinga fire that threatened for a time tosweep through Stauch's restaurantand pavilion, one of the largest builcfIngs at Coney Island.The fire was started by a lightedmatch thrown into a pile of confetti.Almost instantly the flames leaped tothe ceiling, igniting the decorations.If it had not been for the prompt workof Captain Thomas H. Murphy of theConey Island police station the firemight have resulted seriously.Every year Barney Klobloch, manager for Mr. Stauch, gives his confettidance. There was an unsually largeattendance at the dance when thefire started. It was estimated thatthere were 3,000 persons in the hall.A balcony circles the dance hall andit was thronged when the fire started.At the several hundred tables belowwere assembled men and women ingay attire.When the cry of fire was raised andthe shaft of flame jumped toward theceiling, everybody in the hall emptiedthe contents of their glasses on thefire.When the downpour of wine camefrom the balcony Knobloch and manywho were dancing were drenched.PUNS CONCILIATION COURTCleveland Ready to Try Scheme toReduce Costs of Small SuitsMall to Aid.Cleveland, O.
