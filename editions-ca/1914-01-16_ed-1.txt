A.MI WDISTINGUISH LADIESUnderdress of the Well-Bred'Woman Given Careful.Consideration.STYLES IN PAJAMASNEW YORK, Jan. 15. There arewomen who like to dress for the gazeof, the multitudes, but when it comesto the -privacy of their own apartments, think that "any old thing"will do.. But there is another kindwho like to feel the well being thesolidity of being well dressed at alltimes, if it be in the boudoir or atchurch. It is this last kind of womanwho might be termed a well balancedgood dresser. The first loves goodclothes for the sake of those who admire her, and the other loves them forher own sake. By this one the construction of a proper dress for morning wear is' given as much consideration as the dress she wears to theexclusive reception. He lingerie maybe counted upon as being dainty andbeautiful, kbut more- practica 1 thanher neighbor's, who buys for showalone, regardle wearing qualities.Never Such Bgajitiful Cotton FabricsSeen As Those Displayed forSunimer Wear.The cotton fabrics used for housedresses are "being shown " in a widervariety, a3 the stores are commencing to exhibit materials for the Southern .resorts, and incidentally "for ourownractical needs.Ratings and crepes hold the principal '.place, and are to be found in numerous' guises or, perhapsritTmight betermjd,Jdisguises.Bcoca'djid effects are seen in everything from cotton "flanne to .'velvetbroche 'voile. Linen 'frabrics with adesign not unlike that upon our damask tablecloth, are shown in all thepopular colors.Nota Bene If you have a .linentablecloth you are not using, just dipit into the dye-pot and you will havea most up-to-date material for a dressespecially if you make it up with theborder around the bottom " of theskirt.One extremely pretty cotton housedress is pictured in Fig. 1. The material is a novelty madras which lookslike a firm though loosely-woven lawn,with alternating ratine strip of blackand lavender. The waist has raglansleeves, with the tucks on the waistending at the line of the sleeve. Thecollar and cuffs are of plain lavenderlinen. The skirt is very simple, asbefits the woman who does a gooddeal of housework, two pleats in thefront being the only relief and causing a little puff at the hips which givejust a slight touch of tahe popularbouffant silhoutte. and why not ?Surely, utility and style may be combined with a little thought.Another dress, seen in Fig. 2, is ofblue linen crepe, with tiny red flowers naving green stems tnrown- auiily across it. The waist is very simple a broad tuck on either shouldergives breadth and fullness, while atab closing lifts it from the sphere ofthe ordinary shirt waist." The fourgored skirt is also plain, but relievedby a tab corresponding to the one onthe waist. Around the waist is ,acruched girdle of black satin, anda simple little bow finishes the plainblue collar. These last accessoriesmake it a dress suitable for afternoonwear at home, but it is still plainenough for the dress for manringwear.For thenow stylishjlgparate waistsvoile continues to bery.--popular,vT TnlsfnT I vlvt mm W! i Jli AMi M!

One very pretty squarevas plaided in quarter-inch squares,with a fine ratine cord. Another-'ery pretty fabric, called echilyn, haslong and short drawn-work bars scatpred in groups of three over thevoile background.White crepes and crinklettes areve'ng used to make up lingerie, especially for the traveler or businesswoman, but the housekeeper shouldnot fail to see the advantages ofthese webs, as they are great laborsavers, needing no starching or ironing. Chemise and combination suits aremade of the softest batiste, with atiny embroidered figure in pale pink,blue, or lavendar. One extremelypretty chemise is trimmed at the bottom with several net ruffles abouttwo inches wide. This is called thetango chemise, because of the slasheson either side, as it is too narrow tolance in otherwise.In the-tiny shops on side streets,4ust off Fifth Avenue, are the placeswhere ultra effects in lingerie mayrather gasps at some of the things-lisplayed.and the absurdity of chiffon nightgowns trimmed, with stripsof fur, for an instant strikes her humor rather than the enjoyment ofhe pretty effect. Last year's swan's1own was the nearest approach tofur, but this year fitch, skunk, margin and fox are seen even upon mus'in nightgowns! They are also now"'uite necessary for trimming our negligees. It is. strange that veen our chemises and nightgowns are. feelinglhe effects of certain phases of fash'on. It was quite natural that closeItting gowns should bring the princess slip, but that is now being discarded for a chemise of the softestcrepe de Chine or Italian silk, havingi ribbon drawn through the hem and"onfining it closely to the knees.Vnd, will you believe it? anotherform of pantalettes is having quite a-rogue. They are supposed to takehe place of a petticoat, and areusually made of chiffon, fastened tofancy garters and worn just belowhe knees and as long as the skirt.These are most attractive when wornwith a slashed skirt.1&n'itL iHmmwm2jjf &"'Z2S;$;'-umm.Z':s''v)MU-.fJ'' iMA'"rffrfrfci'-Vr Jy.j'Mi&fe&&mm -JwmmmSr l-y.-.'rJ :'' V-tmm imrM f&Zfig&i.?&MH1 '.''

From a productive standpointmany of these fields of alfalfa arevery poor. They represent simplythe possibilities of alfalfa, in the particular section, when the conditions'necessary for the production of' thecrop are fully met. Here and tkerein the State, however, are found menwho, with a thorough knowledge ofthe requirements of alfalfa, are eminently successfulin growing the crop.A'farmer can consider himself successful with alfalfa when he is ableto harvest three or four cutting3 ayear, aggregating a yield of from 3to 5 tons per acre, and when the fieldhas been kept comparatively freefrom weeds and has been productivefor several years.Every live farmer knows the superior feeding value of alfalfa for nearlyall kinds of live stock. The questionis, can ho grow it?The climate of Kentucky is congenial to alfalfa, and in many sectionsthe soil is sufficiently fertile to growthe crop successfully. The lack ofproper preparation of the seed bed isoften the cause of failure. Soilswhich will grow from forty to fiftybushels of corn, per acre are richenough to grow alfalfa, while somesoils not quite so productive can beprepared for alfalfa by growing a cropof cowpeas to turn under. In sectionslow in phosphorus content finelyeround phosphate rock should be added. The Kentucky Experiment Stationis so interested in the value of alfalfa to the farmer that the Extension Department is making, a specialeffort to become acquainted with allsuccessful growers, and in addition isoffering services in directing the workof clubs of farmers whose memberswish to grow a few acres of alfalfaunder instructions. The ExtensionDepartment has now a good numberof farmers in the State who are inthis way learning to grow alfalfa, butis able to offer its services to a 'fewmore groups of farmers for the coming year.Any farmer who has become interested in the growing of alfalfa in hiscommunity is invited to correspondearly with the Extension Departmentconcerning the formation of an alfalfaclub, and its subsequent direction bythis Department.H.

Ton Broeck, of Minneapolis, in the recent issue of the Medical Record, gives an account of a newmethod of treating Ciptheria. He relates liis experiences in implantmgin the throats of patients sufferingfrom it a fungus which multiplies rapidly and destroys the germs responsible for the disease.The fungus is said to be harmlessand to its work rapidly. It is calledthe Achlya Muscaris, and is described as Thallophytic fungus. The qualifying adjective is derived from twoGreek words thallos, a green twig andphyton plant."Achlya muscaris," says Dr. TenBroeck, "possesses the power of destroying bacilli diphtheria in cultureand in the throat."It is appliable in all stages of thedisease and seems to give speediestresults in the earliest cases."There are grounds for believingthat a throat in which the fungus isgrowing is soon shorn of its danger ofcontagion, even if the diptheria bacilli are still harbored."If this fungus possess strong bactericidal properties," says Dr. TenBroeck, "it ought to prove itself curative unaided by other means."Anticipating the clinical tables, itmay be said that the fungus seems toremove membranous anginas of various origin Given a case of membranous 'angina not seriously sickenough to demand immediate antitoxin, it is apnarent that the fungu"an be inoculatprl nnrt b" Joiner -i4-workmany hours before the diagnosishas become established.

Speer on theground that they had not been adver-1tised as provided by the constitutionninety days before the election,and his contention was upheld byJudge jStout.i This opinion was affirmed by theAppellate Court Wednesday.Secretary of State Crecilius, whoseduty it was to advertise the amendments ninety days before election,failed to advertise them until sixtydays before the election. He certifiedthe amendments to go on the ballot,however, and they carried 20 to 1.A friendly suit was brought to testthe law.
