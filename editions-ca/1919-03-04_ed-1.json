SUBE WE CAN DO-IT
Some folks seem to think that Un
cle Sam is going to hive trouble this
spring in floating his Victory-Liberty
Loan of $5,000, 000,000.
That now that the war is over, all
save signing the peace treaty, public
support Is going to loiter on the way
to the bond counter.
But don't you believe it.
The great American public, which
means of course nothing more nor
less than the American people, are
going to finish the job.
They've been behind Uncle Sani
every minute.. f They're behind him
right now. ' They're going to be be
hind him until the last nail is driven
in the coffin of Kaiserdonv Until
democracy is; really safe' for the
world. - , ". : '
It took. just three weeks -in the
'Fourth Liberty Loan for these same
folks to subscribe something like 6,
500, 000,000: -
' And it wasn't such great shakes of
an effort at that-
They have bought scfnething'like
$17,000,000,000 worth of Liberty
Bonds since the war began almost 18
months ago.
Yet no one has gone broke in the
performance..
' And there is'stili a sufficient sur
plus of loose change lying around
the country to. take this next $5,
000,000,000 issue without serlously
crippling any of the projects neces
sary to our continued prosperity.
For most folk's have been jmaking
a little more money of late than ever
before. Some have been spending
more. But most of us have got as far
as our A B C's in the lesson of thrift.
And we like the idea. x
Besides this next loan is to be
only for a short term, and the rate is
to be higher, and winter will be over
and spring will be in the air and' all
will be lovely. And the future will
be looking as bright as the skies:
We simply cannot fall down this
ti'me. We will not.
We will simply eat it up.
