hisbroad bow with its stump of the spritBail mast was close at hand A crowdof fifrures showed above the low bulwark of the loredcek and 1 looked excitedly4citedly till one of them should hail Itwa only a moment A man in a cuirassand headpiece standing by theweather shrouds leaned over and puthis hand to his mouth-Raft a boyI sprang to my feet all the oldstrength of my voice returnedBoard the ship I roared backWe are English It was surely unnecessary now to tell him that we werein distressShe came into the wind and whileher bows beat up a great smother offoam and her sails flapped and thundered the line snaked out and 1 seizedit and made it fast We were hauledrapidly in and a doen strong sunburned hands helped us scramble upthe sideSquare the yards roared the samevoice that had hailed meMen knocked by me to the afterbraces and I was too confused to getout of the way sailor though I wasWell od how is it with yon nowasked a new and quiet voice and Istarted and stared like a fool for theowner of the voice was Nicholas Pradey IMr Tym had waited forme havinggained a step in advance but the rushover the crowded deck had pressedhim back He was not at my sidetherefore when the villain addressedhis question to meFor the life of me I could not lay instant hold of the word to answer Thesurprise the feeling that fate hadplavEd us a trick something like theTHE BOURBON NEWS PAKIS KY TUESDAY MAY 2 1899suggestion that the rogue was des-tined in spite of all to triumphthese mingled impressions confusedme and held the words back on mylipsBut all was the business of an instant and by that time Mr Tym was atmy elbow He had made out the villain though it seemed he had notcaught the exact purport of the inquiry He drew himself up sternly andlooked the fellow in the faceWhat may be your question sirI trust it may be such that the answercan be briefNay he answered leisurely yourmanner is a bit stiff and unfriendlyBest take some further considerationand then we will discourse Meanwhileyou have wants that shall be attendedto We can fit you and Master Ardickhere as well as this good fellow withdrier clothes than you have LieutPhibbertA big fellow in steel headpiece andbody armor but otherwise in ordinarysea habit pushed out of the crowdHave these people below Bestowthis one in the vacant berth off thecabin and find the others bunks inthe steerage Ask Lieut Niles for ashift for this gentleman I opine theyare near the same bigness and havethe slop chest overhauled for MasterArdick and the other In truth heconcluded with a cold grin we do ourcalling no discredit in bestowing thishospitality for I can aver that thesetwo at least are rare fighting menMr Tym puffed out his lips andsucked them back as his habit waswhen perplexed or in thought andafter a glance at me answeredSpeaking for myself 1 would chooseto have as little as possible between usvet I acknowledge that we are notwholly in case to refuse your offersLet our absolute needs be met thensince it must be ko but ask us notI am sure I speak for Master Ardickas well as for myself ask us not toexchange more than the strictest needof words with you Further I refuseyour offer of the cabin and would besent forward with my friendsBe it so I care not how you haveit io where you wish and be as mumas you like I make but the one condition you and the others shall blabnothing of old matters At a latertime I will send for youWell said Mr Tym we are conformable to that are we not friendsBoth Mac Ivrach and T assentedGet refreshments then saidPradey turning a wayand at a properseason you shall be summonedWe followed on dripping in the wakeof the lieutenant and were had downthe companion to a plainly furnishedcabinStand by and 1 will see whatcan be found to thaw the cockles saidthe lieutenantHe fetched us to the table and tookfrom a locker hard by a hospitablelooking black bottle Glasses were inthe rack overhead and he filled fourand bade us toss off It proved to bevery good sack and was most acceptable chilled and weary as we wereThe lieutenant kept us company andwhen we had all emptied a second ofthe small glasses he opened the lowdoor leading into the 1 w cen deeks andpiloted nsalongto the steerage As theship carried no cargo all spacewas given up to sleeping accommodations but in truth there was no roomIo spare as the company was so greatThe lieutenant who like most bigfleshy men seemed rather good-naturedand who might have been mademore so by the wine bade us findplaces and make ourselves at home andwithdrew to hunt up the dot lies Thesecame in due time not ill fitting sea rigsbut better than we expected Mr Tymsin particular very trim and decentWhile we were shifting we relieved Mae Ivrachs curiosity by tellinghim into whose hands we had fallenAfter concluding we all agreed thai weeoidd do no more now than to conductourselves quietly treating the buccaneers in a civil manner and1 beyondthat must wail for Pradeys disclosureWhat that might be we hazarded someguesses about but of course could resolve nothing certainWe- did not specially avoid Pradeyand indeed secretly hoped that hawould be out with his communicationso that we could tell what to dependupon but somewhat to our disappointment he made no sign We talked nlittle but guardedly with the crowexplaining briefly in answer to theirquestions how our adventure occurred but going Into nothing of momentThe rest of the afternoon passedand at supper time there was no important change in the situation TheBlack Eagle as our ship was namedvery nearly held her own but carrying fully as much canvas forward asthe present wind and her weakpatehed up mast warranted Supperwas served both below and on deckand we chose ours In the latter placeour mess t ub being shared in commonwith an Englishman two Swedes and anegroWe found the fare very good far beyond what it would be on any merchant ship and certainly better thanit was or is in the royal navy andeverything washed down with plentyof wine and aleThe meal over we lounged about thedeck and finally repaired to the midships weather rail which we overhung watching the chase and talkingPradey at last took In all but his chiefsails the wind now seriously threatening the weak forward spars ami thecanvas there was shortened in proportion It seemed to us now that he hadgiven op all hope of overhauling thePilaneaThe moon rose and we continued tohang about that part of the deckAll about us the lights of the menspipes sprang up and the scene waslike a bivouac with the groups of recumbent figures and the glancing ofarmsOnly a small number of persons asI found were appointed for a watchThe rest idled about or went below asthey pleased As yet there was noparticular disorder among them andno fighting or noticeable drunkennessWe were together at the rail talking in subdued voices and what withthe poor captains death and thethings that had happened to us to acertain degree fallen into a little melancholy when Mr Tyms name wasspoken and we turned to beholdPradeyWTell sir said the rascal in anamicable voice I trust you and jourfriends here find yourselves in betterspirits than you were I have a bit ofleisure at this time and if you areready we will have the discourse Ispoke ofWe were quite willing to hear himand readily said so and he bade usfollow him to the cabinThe cabin was vacant as we discovered by the aid of the single smalllamp Pradey signed us to seats on thelockers and himself took a place at theend of the table with his back to hisown stateroomI do not purpose to waste time inboxing the compass he began assoon as we were seated but will be atthe bottom of the business at onceYou see me in command of this tidyship and I Avill inform you if you donot know that she belongs to CaptHenry Morgans fleet of special commissioners Now I conceive I need notspin out an argument to convince youthat your future must depend upon unfriendshiplie paused as though expectingsemie sort of reply and Mr Tym saidbrieflyAnd if so what thenWhy then he went on a littlesharply it behooves you to do all inyour power to please me and move meto further kindness Look you I havelittle cause to love you and yet oneasy conditions 1 will overlook allSay that you will join me and swearto reveal nothing of the old mattersand I will pardon the ill you have doneme and stand your friend In thisoffer I include your companion whoI presume is posted as to our past relationsCHAPTER XLOF THE BARGAIN WITH PRADEYI cannot say that I had conceivedanything like this and yet I was notstruck with very great surprise Itseemed pretty evident that Pradeycould not so well dispose of us as towin us over if that might be His crewthough desperate enough did not precisely sail under the black flag and tobutcher us in cold blood would makea very stirring bit of talk that wouldWXWhLBoard the ahii I roared backbe like to trouble him in the futureIf Morgan indeed held a royal commission then his deeds and those of hiscaptains must not be altogether lawless and he must not have too muchblood of his own countrymen on hishands Provided that Pradey hadfound a way to silence the fellowsfrom the Industry he had only to winus over and he might return even toEngland in safety But as to complying with his proposition that was another matter and one which had moresides than I could turn about and cometo a decision on in a moment Nor didMr Tym bold and resolute as h wasattempt a full and conclusive answerHe glanced at Mac Ivrach and me andfinding that we wore dcubtfttl expressions made for him a cvy cautiousreplyWe have heard you Master Pradey he said and while I speakingfor myself hesitate not to reject onepart of your proposition to wit thatwe shouhl join your ships companystill there are other points in the matter that require thoughtWell I will not press you saidPradey rather mildly and you mayhave till morning for the answerMeanwhile said I thinking It agood time to settle one point bepleased to tell us how it cam aboutthat we find you here Also what hasbecome of jour companionsWhy that is a short story saidPradey with one of his cold grinsThe night of the day we left you itfell quite dark and the watch havingfortified his courage with spirits suffered himself to fall asleep and a shipcoming up ran us down Some werekilled outright and others drownedand in the end I was th only one savedThe ship was a buccaneer one of thosecruisers sent out by Morgan and wasso unfortunate as to have just lost hercaptain He had been killed in awrangle with the first lieutenant andthe latter had then been shot in turnone of the crew As no person wasleft aboard who understood navigation and as I made no scruple to putmyself forward I was soon chosencaptain and when this was settled westood away to rejoin the fleet Weshortly came up with it when CaptMorgan was pleased to confirm me inmy place About this time news wasreceived of the sailing of the Pilaneawith the governor of Panama on boardand while most of the squadron stoodfor St Catherines three of us weredispatched to intercept the don I wasthe only one fated to fall In with himand it seems that I have come ratherdisastrously off I think you nowhavei the whole story unless it be that I forgot to tell Morgan and the rest quiteall that had formerly happened to mebut spun a yarn about my ship takingfire and we poor creatures barelywhipping off at short notice the others miserably perishingWell sir I thank you for the storysaid I and in truth I am sorry for thepoor sailors particularlj forLewsonAnd now he said you might giveme in return an account of your ownfaring Surely when I looked over therail to day and saw jour familiar facesI was not a little astonishedAs we were to see you said I butafter all it was a simple matter andwith this I went on and related ourstoryAt least there are those that arenot born to be drowned he saidlaughing my worthy self includedWell go now and think over the othermatter Let me know when you havecome to a resolutionWe took ourselves off accordinglyand returned to the deckWell friends said Mr Tym assoon as we were secure in our placeswhat think you of all we have heardMac Ivrach looked at me to answerand with a little hesitation I saidBut for the matter of covering therogues crime I should be for acceptinghis terms I should count it no sucndreadful thing to join the buccaneersthough once I admit I thought otherwise and this sentiment is strongersince the death of the poor captain MMr Tym nodded Aye that is myreasoning he said Moreover itseems that Morgan does really bear acommission from the king Pradey aswell as all before speaks very confidently of it so we may be pretty sure ofthe legality of the thing But the villains old offense that is the stickHere Mac Ivrach who had been giving close heed put in a wordIs there no a middle course I takit the man micht listen to a bit compromiseI had been thinking fast as the Scotchman spokeI cannot say 1 replied I havenothing clear and yet Stay Howasto a compromise in time Say we wouldagree under this stress to cover thevillainy for a periodT distrust it said Mr Tym shaking his head Besides Pradey wouldnever consentBut there is more to the matter Iwent on coming to a clearer conception of the thought myself as I talkedAs you say he is desperate and voidof all conscience Could we trust himin any caseWhy no he answered a little perplexed but what thenWill he trust us in turn The baseare always suspicious Think you nothe will seek to make way with uspledge ourselves as we may Thenwhy would he not agree to the compromise we would swear to besecret till the end of the expeditionHe would consent I think meaning todestroy us at the first opportunityIn truth there is weight in what yousay said Mr Tym beginning towaver Aye doubtless you have therights of it he added almost immediatelyLet us test it I said Nothing isto be gained by waitingMy companions agreed and we accordingly went below and sought Pradey He was on the quarter ldeek andwent aside with us upon which MrTym made the propositionTO BE COXTINlEDAN UNUSUAL CAPACITYThe Native Wondered at the
