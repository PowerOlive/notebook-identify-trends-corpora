LENIHAIN,Cash Grocery.MrBoth Phones 234On the charge that, he receivedmoney unlawfully for the purpose ofinfluencing an election the" BourbonCounty Grand Jury sitting at theMarch term of the Bourbon CircuitCourt returned an indictment againstMayor John T. Hinton, of this city,but by order of the court thb indictment was withheld from the publicuntil late last week and after benchwarrants had been issued and served.The indictment against Mayor Binton was the reeult of the investigationwhich was in progress at the earlysession of the grand jury and theprobe was made into the alleged election frauds at the instance of JudgeRobert L. Stout, who instructed thebody to conduct.an investigation alongthese lines with a view ot unearthingan alleged scandal referred to in thespeech of Hon, J. Campbell Cantrill inhis speech here several weeks ago inthe interest of his candidacy for Congress. The indictment of Mayor Hintongrew out of alleged frauds which weresaid to have been perpetrated in theThird Ward in this city during -theelection last November when, it issaid, Mayor Hintcn received from theFirst National Bank of Paris, the sumof S700 to be used to influence thevoters of this ward and bring aboutthe election of Harry Baldwir, aDemocrat, over J. VV. Laikin, a Republican. By the terras of the alleged dealentered into by James McClure,cashier of the First National Bankand others and Mayor Hinton, the latter it is claimed agreed to vote hisstock in the Agricultural Bank ofParis cn the question of merging thetwo institutions, and consolidate underthe First National. According to therumor which was circulated MayorHinton failed to comply with his partof the a'rgeement.When the Grand Jury met threeweeks ago the investigation of thealleged frauds referred to by JudgeStout were overlooked and the matterof probing into the Third Ward election was assumed. James McClure,cashier of the Frst National, M. R.Jacoby, Roy Clendenin, Thos. H.Clay, Jr., Stamps Moore, C. C. Clarkeand others were summoned before thebody it is said and testified in the casebefore that body, as being witnessesto the deal made with Mayor Hinton,and upon this evidence the indictmentwas-returned. - -Theevidence given bsfore the grandjury, it is claimed, was sufficient 10indict all parties to the alleged transaction, but from the fact that onlyone indictment was returned the matter reflects upon the integrity of thegrand jury 'and from an unahised pointof view shows clearly upon the face ofthe situation that Mayor Hinton wasthe victim of a conspiracy.According to the statement of Mayor Hinton made yesterday the onlyagreement made with the officialsof the First National Bank wasthat he would favor a merger cf hisstock in the Argicultural Bank provided the men from the First Nationalcould show him as they claimed theycould that the Agricultural stockwould be worth more under suchmerger than at present, but up to thistime this has- never been shown norany attempt made to do bo, and thatha did not receive the campaign contribution of seven hundred dollars asstated.S Our Spring Suits 1Js FOR Nfiscal Court Meets Thursday.Men, Young Men and BoysArc Now on DispSayIn all the Latest Cuts and a'l the new Colorsat Prices to Suit Everybody's Pocketbook.You are Cordially Invited to inspect thisLarge Line.1 The regularthe.

Andas a matter of fact the consumers began to actually pay increased pricesfor woolens and cottons in anticipationof the increased wages to be paid bythe woolen trust, before the znnouncement of the increased wages wasmade.Cotton prints, calicos and the likehave risen in price at wholesale inNew York City a quarter of a cent peryard in the last ten days, and millagents predict the increase will reachtw.o cents a yard.This will mske a difference of 5cents in an apron and 25 cents in thehousewife's dress. Men's clothing isgoing up and women's and children'sdress goods'are declared to be the nextin line. The increases, it is estimated,will bring approximately 513,000,000intothe coffers of the woolen trustwithin a year. Thus an accommodating public will bear the cost of- thestrike and the increases in wages.The men who work such game3 onboth public and employes are but ahandful in number.

IThe two games whichwere to have been played with theMason county High School have beencanceled.Those who availed themselves of theopportunity of witnessing the teamplay throughout the season as theywrested victory after victory fromtheir less fortunate opponents feelthat time can never erase frommemory the recollection of how valiantly they fought.Those who must rely solely upon thisreview of tha season will get but afaint and inadequate idea of what thisphenomenal team did or was capableof doing. Full justice and creditwould not be rendered the young ladiesthat make up the team, if the wholeaccount was to be written in capitals,punctuated with exclamation points,with every adjective in the superlativedegree.The first game of the season waswith the Richmond High School girlsin which Paris won by the score of 44to 0. This furnished but a slight intimation of what was to follow. Themajority of the games could hardly beconsidered anything more than practiegames. Of the list of victories wonthere are two that deserve specialprominence. With reluctance theState University girls agreed to playthe Paris High School and then onlyon condition that the game be playedon their own floor. Suffice to say thegame was played according to theirterms and much to the chagrin of - theproud wearers of the blue and white,resulted in a victory for Paris by thescore of 14 to 10.It would not be presumptive for theteam to claim not only -the champion-snip of Kentucky but alsi of theSouth. According to the availabledope" the championship of the southlay between State University andTransylvania. No game was playedbetween these two teams to decide thechampionship but Paris defeated StateUniversity, who defeated Louisvillewho'in turn defeated Transylvania.Asa htting climax to the season theParis team defeated the aggregationfrom the Lexington High School.It would indeed be an injustice -toattempt to pick from this galaxy ofundefeated stars the brightest. Thebest and fairest way to comment onthe team is to consider them as theyalways played; not individually, but aswhole. The Pans girls know thegame from start to finish and generally employed their knowledge to thebest advantage. They" are all hard.consistent players, the whole teamong since learned the difficult and allimportant art of connecting with thebaskets. Their goal shooting was onlyexcelled by their floor "work whicheveryone that ever saw them play willadmit wast ruly remarkable.Elsa Heller, captain, and RuthCnambers, the two guards, are largely responsible for their opponentscsores being as small as they were.The goals thrown over them were alldeserved. In passing it might be saidthat none' of these girls were bornbasket ball players. To Prof, Johnsontoo much credit can not be ascribed.His ability as. a coach can best bejudged by the record his team hasmadp. The young ladies, who enjoy theproud distinction of composing the1912 team are as follows:Elsa Heller, captain, and RuthChambers, guards: Mary Hayden,center; Olive Tatfl and Nellie Rummans, forwards; Gertrude blicer andJerome Chapman, substitutes. Thegames played this season ara as follows :Paris 44, Richmond High School 0 ;Paris 52, Cynthiana High School 1 :Paris 14, State University 10; Paris30, Cynthiana High School 0; Paris 24,Richmond High School 13; Paris 19,Curbin acdemy 13 ; Paris 26.

Mr. Gamble, incidentally, is manager of the PereMarquette fast freight line. He walked into a hotel in Kansas, and there,upon the lobby floor, he saw a smaiigreen wad. "A $5 bill," marveled Mr.Gamble when he unrolled it.A week or so later he ambled intothe lobby of another hotel in anotherstate. The first thing his eyes litupon was a pellet of green near theclerk's desk. Business of making ahurried dive for it and then discovering two $10 bills, packed together.Mr. Gamble observed that he wassure enough in the middle of the luckycurve. He wondered what he wouldfind next.He came to town, walked into theCadillac, and there, in the middle ofthe lobby floor, appeared that, familiarlittle emerald bulb. Mr. Gamblesidled toward it, trying to look as if hewas looking another way. Just atthat moment a small .dog butted in.He seized the little green wad andfrolicked toward the street. Mr. Gamble abandoned his pretense at indifference and dived for the mutt."Grab urn," begged Mr. Gamble;"catch urn."A gentleman standing by the doorobliged. He took the little bundle outof the dog's mouth; then he lookedup at Mr. Gamble. "This yours?" heasked.Mr. Gamble thought he would take achance. "Yep," he said; "it's mine.I just missed it."The gentleman handed over the bundle with an odd look at Mr. Gamble,and went away hastily. Mr. Gambleexamined it. The wrapper was ofsoft green paper. It had broken mseveral places from the dog's teeth.Inside was a pair of lady's garters.Cincinnati Times-Star.ALL ALONE IN THE STORMInside, the Merry Country PartyWotted Not of the Forlorn FigureOut in the Cold.It was bitter cold. The snow fellthickly, and, driven by the wind, itbeat relentlessly against the faces ofthose who were not sheltered. A wildnight, indeed. Midwinter, and in theopen country, and one of the coldestnights in the memory of the oldest inhabitant. He stood not far from the winding,snowbound road, his face turned toward the highway. A forlorn objectin that great storm.His old felt hat, jammed roughly onhis head, but ill-protected his face andears from the' chly blasts. He woreno overcoat, only a light and muchfrayed jacket, more fitted, indeed, forsummer weather than the zero temperature of that night. His handswere unprotected by gloves, while histrousers,, thin and worn, flutteredabout his legs. He wore no shoes.Inside the great farm, close by, thelights blazed merrily, and through thewindows, from which the shades weredrawn, could be seen many young people passing hither and thither. Amerry country party youth andlaughter.And now through the storm othersmake their way to the farmhouse.They are bundled up warm and comfortable, and defy the snow and thecold. They are happy in the anticipation of the joyful evening before them.Care and worry have no part in theirminds.They do not know that close bystands that ill-clothed figure, witharms stretched appealingly forth, andif they knew there would be no pityin their hearts.For it was only the old farmer'sscarecrow. William Sanford In Puck.Flight of aJ-Ioney Bee.George S. Demuth, now with theUnited States department of agriculture, but until recently at the headof the apiary department in the officeof the state entomologist", tells in theforthcoming anriilal report of theapiary department, of proof, he has ofthe great speed attained by honeybees in their flight. Mr. Demuth wasshipping some bees from Terre Hauteto Indianapolis in a special tractioncar, when a few of the bees escapedfrom the boxes In which they were being transported."When the bees escaped," said Mr.Demuth, "I watched their behaviorand was surprised to find they had nodifficulty in flying out at the open cardoor and flying ahead of the movingcar. The car was going at the rate of35 or 40 miles an hour. In my opinion, the flight of a honey bee mustexceed the speed of the average railway train."Smoking to Be Stopped.Statistics gathered through investigation by the authorities of New Yorkcity show that 3,245 fires in 1910 and3,332 in 1911 were caused by the carelessness of smokers, mostly in placesof industry. Fire Commissioner Johnson, who has been studying the lawsrelating to the prevention of fires, aswell as to their extinguishment, hasdiscovered a statute which forbids.acts which endanger the heaitn orsafety of any considerable number ofpersons, and he Is going to attempt tomake It applicable to smoking -in factories. He has therefore ordered 40,000 notices printed in English, Yiddish and Italian forbidding smokingIn factory buildings. These will beuniversally distributed and followedby vigilant and constant inspection toprevent the Tfoppf his order.I CAUSE 10 DOUBT.A Statement of Facts Backed bya Strong Guarantee.We guarantee immediate and positiverelief to all sufferers from constipation.

Chairman M. H. H.Davis, of the Executive Committee.has received notice from a numberof citizens stating that the doors oftheir home will be thrown open tothe Knights and ladies for their entertainment during the conclave.In the nex few weeks it is the hopeof the Quarters Committee to haveevery commandery in the State whichintends to attend the conclave assigned to quarters. From the fact thatthe accommodations are limited inthis city it will be necessary to assignthe remaining commanderies to private quarters, and from the largenumber that usually attend on suchoccasions, the people of Paris shouldcome forward unhesitatingly and extend to the visitors unlimited hospitality. The Quarters Committee, of whichDr. F. L. Lapsley is Chairman, requests that all who can accommodatev.sitors, communicate with them immediately, that all requests for quarters to come in from now until all areaccommodated.

Thereis a strong tendency to run towardroyal families, court musicians, andphilosophers. Two or three personscan distinctly remember having beenJoan of Arc, and the number of reincarnated Napoleons and Louis Fourteenths is growing all the time. Butthe man we are anxious to meet isthe chap who can remember withpleasure his incarnation as thebrawny "white wings" who pushed thscoop around the arena of the RomanColiseum after the show was over andthe animals retired, or the employe ofthe Imperial Health Departmentwhose duty it was to descend into theCloaca Maxima when it got clogged.Another New Thought which comesat. this moment is in connection withthe statement of Dr. Sears that shewas the Italian singer Marsina 400years ago, was bitterly discontented,and now she longs to sing and cannot.There's matter for rumination in this.We shall hurry away now to tell theyoung woman in the apartment adjoining ours that the reason she longsto sing, or thinks she can sing, andcannot, is because she had a sweetpipe several hundred years ago anddidn't make the most of it.

Printers' Ink.She had a jaw that somehow reminded one" of the cowcatcher on a locomotive perhaps because it was always somewhat in advance of hercountenance. Also there was a lookof determination in her eyes, and itwas evident, from the manner inwhich she elbowed other passengersaside, that she had no desire to be regarded a? a shrinking violet. Yet shewas rather good looking, and she wasdressed in such a manner as to indicate that she was free from the necessity of practicing economy. Aftershe had fought her way into the carshe looked at the men who were occupying seats and then stationed herself in front of a smallish, gray-hairedgentleman whose expression was kindand even lamblike.The woman engaged his attentionby kicking his toes. He curled his feetback under the seat and continued toread his paper. Then she "hemmed"loudly and'bumped against his knees.He looked up at her, indulged in asigh of weariness and tried to makeroom for her by crowding closely tothe woman who sat at the left of him.She declined to budge, however, andthe old gentleman again turned hisattention to his paper.Exasperated by such ungallant behavior on his part, the woman withthe decisive jaw said in tones that inno wise suggested the haunting melody of a tinkling brook:"I suppose I'll have to stand all theway home. I've heard of men whohad the decency to get up when thecars were crowded, but I guess they'reall dead.""Madam," the little old gentlemanmildly remarked, "I would give youmy seat, but I'm saving it for a lady."Chicago Record-Herald.KENTUCKY TRACTION ANDTERMINAL CO."The Blue Grass Route."Hourly High Speed ThroughHigh SpeedService.ParisLexington - FrankfortDivision.Centenary of Moscow Campaign.One hundred year ago Napoleon setout on his campaign to Moscow, andit is perhaps only natural that Moscowand Russia generally should bS eagerto celebrate the centenary of a campaign which was so disastrous to theinvaders. Already preparations arebeing made in Moscow to open the1812 museum, and an immense numberof objects relating to the campaignhave been collected. The centenaryhas already been celebrated by a concert, which revived the marches aridmilitary airs of both armies, and someof these, according to the Debats, aremost interesting and curious. Moreinteresting still, as likely to recall theevents of that year, will be the visitsthat are to be paid to the battlefieldsand the ceremonies that are to takeplace there.Taking No Chances."Say, Conn, do you know a nice -girlwith lots of money for me to marry?""Yes, I know several and I got pictures here.
