Campbell Cantrill. Regardless of the fact that Senator James had only nominal opposition and spurred on only by a desireto send him a message of good cheerto the sick room at Baltimore, theDemocrats did their duty, but at thatthe vote was a comparatively lightone in many localities.The returns indicate that WilliamPreston Kimball, who was on the ballot, as an opponent of SenatorJames, received only a small scattering vote, and even in Fayette county,the home of Mr, Kimball, SenatorJames received an overwhelming majority. Indications point to Dr. Ben Bruner, of Louisville, as having a slightlead over Judge B. J. Bethurum, ofSomerset, for the Republican nomination for United States Senator. Thecounties heard from are scatteringand represent every district in theState. The Republican vote fell farshort of that cast in the Democraticrace for Senator.The vote in this county was verylight, a total of only about 450 votesbeing cast. The farmers were busywith their crops, and nobody seemedto care very much about it, anyway.In one precinct in the county thereJmeamiIgwas not a single vote cast, the election officers failing to show up, andthe voting booth remained closed allday.to to toSOME SEASONABLE SUMMERSUGGESTIONS , SWINGS,SEPARATORS, ETC.Special Prices on Cream Separators, Lawn and Porch Swings; Hammocks, Ice Cream Freezers and Refrigerators.

This areais a nest of German reserves and. fieldartillery.Goussancourt itself has been takenby the FreUch, the 'ad vices add..The capture of the importantgrpund on the heights to the westerlyside of "the linet also, means that theGermans' will otl)e abeM:o retire inan" oi'ditlary leisurely1 Way, andf'thattheypVobabjywllf have' to 'go beyondthe Rfver'VesIe in their retreat.SAVING AND'SAVTNG AND LENDING. Sir William Goode, of the BritishFood Ministry, says that from July,1917, to April, 1918, the UnitedStates exported to the allies 80,000,000 bushels of wheat products. Ofthis it is asserted that 50,000,000bushels represented voluntary sacrifices by the American people in theirconsumption of wheat.There is a triple economy, a tripleaspect to thjs saving of wheat. Itsaved wheat for our Army and thearmies of our allies; it saved moneyto the American people, and for themost part this money went "tor thepurchase of Government war securities. There is another saving still; thissort of sacrifice and economy is helping win the war with the resultantsaving of soldiers',, lives. ,MAT CtfT D0W3 RE ADINGRestrictions onthe reading matterspace in dailyandSinday dltibnsof newspapers', retail price of' twocents or more and'jth elimination, ofall waste werereconpiendetQ theWar IndustriesoarJy'tlie commjttee on" cqnaefion ' of jijewsprintpaper, by' jtheT AmerlcanlrewspaperAssociation.

' When this tubeis inflamed you have a "rumblingfcound or imperfect hearing, andwhen it is entirely closed, deafnessis the result. Unless the Inflammation can be reduced and this tube restored to its normal condition, hearing will be destroyed forever.

This demonstrates beyond argument that the Babies' Health Contests are educativealong lines invaluable to the cominggeneration, and that all mothers shouldbe provided with the knowledge of howto care for her'haby, how to feed it,how to let it sleep, how to dress t, andhow to remedy defects.The Babies' Health Contest this yearis under the supervision of Mrs. JohnL.

Amid the many asytriumphs' which 'enabled the -Teutonsthis year to slice great sections fromthe map of "Russia, like coupons froma' bond; Germany and Austriaboth suffered one -frightful disappointmentAnd the pang 'was in the weakest partof their political anatomy the collecttive stomach of their peoples.Ther grain of which the two kaisersexpected to plunder the Ukraine ,wasnot there at least there was 'so littleof it that -Germany had to lower herbread ration, while 'Austria continuedto starve a bit more rapidly. The supplies had been burned. NThese fires were lighted, with a kindof poetic justice, by the remnants ofthe Czecho-Slovak army desertersfrom the Austrian ranks and ' inveterate enemies of the Hapsburgs, whohad been reconstituted into Russianmilitary units under the Kerenskyregime and fought so splendidly forRussia before the whole nation collapsed from the gnawing of the bolshevikf. fortunate for the Allies.Until March of this year this Czechoslovak army had been stationed in theUkraine 50,000 men in line and 50,000more in reserve. Then bolshevik representatives dissolved their organization and took away their arms, thoughJ about 20,000 refused to part with theirweapons. Tney were given promisesthat they would be allowed to leaveRussia for the United States, but, ofcourse, no means of transportationwere provided. And so they remainedwhere they "were.It was fortunate for the allies thatthey did. As soon as they realizedthat Germany's chief objective inRussia was the Ukrainian grain supply they began a systematic campaignLof pillage and burning, in which theywere assisted by the peasants themselves, aroused at the thoughtj.thatthe old landowners were to return under German protection.The evidence that the Czecho-Slo-pyakfr wereuccessful is incontestable.Count Czernin,- Austro-fiungarianprime minister until his little' ex-of pleasantries with M.Clemenceau, placed the responsibilityfor the bare Ukrainian cupboard onthe shoulders of the Czecho-Slovaks.German ' representatives in the Austrian relchsrath repeated the charge ingreater details. A 'Magyar deputy inthe Hungarian parliament recently declared that the Czecho-Slovak army InUkraine had burned or taken awayeverything of value.Had Their Revenge.Not only did they destroy what theycould, but they fought bitterly to prevent the Teutons taking what wasleft. Retiring and hampered by theirlack of equipment, they stopped tomeet the advancing Germans repeatedly in the field. Their last battle,one of those confused struggles whichget little space in the' cable reports,was fought near Bachmac, halfwaybetween-Kieff and Kursk on-the road,jto Moscow. . After the fight, thoughthe' Czecho-Slovaks, had been armedchiefly with axes, they themselvesburled more than 300 Germans.Certainly in Ukraine the Czechoslovaks have had their revenge forthree centuries of suffocation andoppression in Bohemia. -But throughout the war they have launched shattering blows against their Austrianand German enemies and the wholeidea of Mittel Europa. jKEEP LOST MEN'S PHOTOSNavyDepartment Is Anxious to Perpetuate Memory of Enlisted Men.Thaviu.at the Panama-Pacific Exposition, andit was the only one commissioned toplay a return engagement.
