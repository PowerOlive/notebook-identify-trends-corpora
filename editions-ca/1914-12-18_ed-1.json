WAR TAX DOES NOT AFFECT
THE PARIS "JOHNNIES."
"I should worry about this war-tax,"
said a well-known young Paris society
man, as he strolled into a long dis
tance booth at the Cumberland Tele
phone office, smoking a freshly-lighted
cigarette and chewing his arrowmint.
"Lef the poor Belgians starve," he
said. "No doubt a good many other
poor people in this town will come just
as near starving as the poor Belgians
this winter. But the high cost of liv
ing is not worrying me one iota of a"n
eyelash. And the European dum-dum
bullets are not perforating any of my
meal tickets," he added, as he proceed
ed to call up his best girl at Hutchison
and make an engagement to take her
to the Ben AH, in Lexington, that
night.
After the arrangements were com
pleted with his feminine friend, our
"Johnnie" wired to Manager Scott for
the theatre tickets. A warm friend of
his, who was selling insurance, bought
j mm a. uuujy, v-uaucugeu mill lu a. game

j ed at its height, managed to get his
I signature to an application for an in

. tooth paste at Varden's drug store.

FOR FATHER.
AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION.
Buy Grass and Clover Seed Early.
A great deal of a farmer's prosperir
depends upon his ability to get go I
stands of grass and clover free fr1
noxious weeds. Not the least imp J
tant factor in accomplishing this '"
good seed. Farmers have not attac'
BIRTHS.
ed enough importance to good seed -i
the past, Avith the result that th v
have lost many dollars and" their farirs
have become infested with trouble
some species of weeds.
It is entirely possible to get gra
and clover seed free from weed seed.
By the use of modern, cleaning ma
chinery nearly all such seeds can be
removed. In addition, to clean seed
we want seed that will grow, and seel
dealers should be required to guaran
tee the germination of the seed the.
sell. Good seed is always the cheap
est. Poor seed is expensive at any
price, even as a gift.
Dealers have a' good stock ot seci
now in most cases. They are just a?
cheap now, or probably cheaper, than
they will be later. Why not bu
early and get the first chance at th
high grade seed. Buy by sample an 1
test for germination and examine fo
purity, or, if you do not feel competed
to do this send the samples to the E.
periment Station, where the work wil!
be done free of cost. In case of bh'o
grass and red top seed, this is always,
the best plan.
Do not wait until the last raome4
and take the poorest seed, that even
one else has refused.
