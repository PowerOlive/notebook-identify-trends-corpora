HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW
TIr Attitude Made niin Question
the
Joke Manufacturers Veracity
Some time said the young man
when business is light I am going to
take a day off and vhen I dp some of
Ibe ccziic papers will do well to engage
a large assortment of guards
Going to turn iu some comic verse
are you inquired the older man face
tiously
No Im not answered the young
man with emphasis but Ill bet when
I get through with them they will
know a few things about their business
that they never knew before
Oh theyve been having fun with
you have they exclaimed the older
man But you mustnt mind that Its
all in good nature you know
They havent mentioned me as
serted the young man but they have
led me astray by a long series of inane
iests and I intend to show them the
error of their
that Ive been
year
Yes I heard of your wedding
Well just about two months after
we were married my wife informed me
one morning that her mother was com
ing to visit us I immediately thought
of the comic papers Before she became
my mother-in-law I rather liked the old
lady but of course things were different
nfter the wedding Consequently I
stamped around and swore a bit and de
clared that I wanted it understood that
no relative to either party to the con
tract could step in there and run that
house Then my wife came back at me
with the statement that if her mother
wasnt welcome we might as well come
to an understanding at once and arrange
for a separation I replied that she was
welcome so long as she was willing to
mind her own business but that it was
a well known fact that no mother-in-law
ever had succeeded in doing that
yet Naturally the result was that when
her mother arrived my wife and I were
not on the best of terms and it didnt
take long for the old lady to see it
When she did see it she acted
Boasted you I suppose said the
older man
Roasted me nothing returned the
young man She roasted her daughter
I happened to overhear it and when she
laid down the law as to the duties of a
wife my heart went out to her and I
felt meaner than a bobtail flush for all
Id said of her And shes been the same
ever since She doesnt mix in much if
morous writers to idfor a minute Im
feeling pretty strcn

Purists and Pedants
Many purists condemn such a phrase
as no sort or kind on the ground of
tautology I should be sorry however
to see it disappear because it is a land 1
mark inEnglishphilology It is a relio
of the fusicn of Saxon and Norman-
French At that period many phrases of
a bilingual character crept into Use and
this is one of them Truth and honor j
is another truth being troth or hon 1

A Member of the New York Doprrrlmcnt

About Given Up All Hope
Jacob A Riis author of eIIov the
Other Half Lives writes of Heroes
Who Fight Fire in The Century The
article is one of the scries Heroes of
Peace Mr Eiis tells the followirg
story of a heroic rescue at the Hotel
Eoyal fire in New York some years ago
Sergeant Vaughan went up on the
roof The smoke was so dense ttio
that he could see little but through it
he heard a cry for help and made out
the shape of a man standing upon a
window sill in the fifth story-overlook-

he ran down and around in the nest
street to the roof of the house that
formed an angle with the hotel wing
There stood the man below him only a
jump away but a jump which no mor
tal might take and live His face and
hands were black with smoke Vaughan
looking down thought him a negro Ha
was perfectly calm
It is no use he said glancing up
Dont try You cant do it
The sergeant looked wistfully about
him Not a stick or a piece of rope was
in sight Every shred was used below
There was absolutely nothing But I
couldnt let him ho Eaid to me months
after when he had come out of the hos
pital a whole man again and was back
at work I just couldnt standing
there so quiet and brave To the men
he said sharply
I w7ant you to do exactly as I tell
you now Dont grab me but let me
get the first grab He had noticed that
the man wore a heavy overcoat and had
already laid his plan
Dont try urged the man You
cannot save me I will stay here till it
gets too hot then I will jump
No you wont from the sergeant
as he lay at full length on the roof look
ing over It is a pretty hard yard down
there I will get you or go dead myself
The four sat on the sergeants legs as
he swung free down to the waist so he
was almost able to reach the man on the
window with outstretched hands

The Middle Aged Man
wonder said the middle aged
man why we take life so hard At the
very best we have only 75 or 100 years
of it and yet we fume and fuss and
worry all through it I think of it
sometimes Here I am well say 50
with maybe 20 years ahead The cold
chances are against my getting so many
but take a hopeful view and Eay Ive
got 20 But thats a mighty short time
heh But just think of frittering away
that time in worry
When I think of these things I
make up my mind that by cracky I
will not worry any more and oh I
think I take things more philosophical
ly than I used to But let some little
thing come up I dont fly all to pieces
over it maybe but it drags and grinds
And only 20 years to live
What a waste of time What poor
miserable critters we are New York

sergeant got a grip en the collar of his
coat
Hoist he shouted to the four on
die roof and they tugged with their
might The sergeants body did not
move Bending over till the back creak
ed it hung over the edge a weight of
203 pounds suspended from and holding
it down The cold sweat started upon
his mens foreheads as they tried and
tried again without gaining an inch
Blood dripped from Sergeant Vaughan
nostrils and ears Sixty feet below w
the paved courtyard Over against hiin
was the window behind which he saw
the back draft coming gathering head
way with lurid swirling smoke Now
it burst through burning the hair and
the coats of the two For an instant he
thought all hope was gone
But in a flash it came back to him
sentiment I dont like it and never
use it but it occurs in Shakespeare
Notoriously many so called Ameri
canisms are old English provincialisms
The purists threaten indeed to become
insufferable pedants It is now the cus
tom of the printers reader our great
authority to treat none as invari
ably singular a contraction Jor no one
Bet it is useful as a plural and is so
used in Shakespeare e g Speak
daggers but use none Why may we
not continue to say I spoke to no wo
men at the meeting because there were
none present Academy

wrenched and tore at his muscles he
was swinging the man to- and fro like a
pendulum head touching head He
could swing him up A smothered shout
warned his men They crept nearer the
edge without letting go their grip on
him and watched with staring eyes the
human pendulum swing wider and wid
er farther and farther until now with
a mighty effort it swung within their
reach They caught the skirt of the coat
held on pulled in and in a moment
lifted him over the edge
They lay upon the roof all six
breathless sightless their faces turned
to the winter sky The tumult of the
street came up as a faint echo The
spray of a score of engines pumping be
low fell upon them froze and covered
them with ice The very roar of the fire
seemed far off The sergeant was the
first to recover He carried down the
man he had saved and saw him sent off
to the hospital Then first he noticed
that he was not a negro The smut had
been rubbed off his face Monday had
dawned before he came to and days
passed before he knew his rescuer Ser
geant Vaughan was laid up himself
then He had returned to his work and
finished it but what he had gone
through was too much for human
strength It was spring before he re
turned to his quarters to find himself
