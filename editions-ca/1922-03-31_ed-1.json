With Conrad Nagel, Lois Wilson and Jack Holt
A Paramount Picture
A story of a million married lives, throbbing in the hearts of one wife and one husband. Both yearning for the vanished
thrill of sweetheart love. Both wondering why the passing years of marriage should steal away romance. So, drifting
apart, the man'plunged into the world's affairs. The woman, in spite of her vows and her child, turned to an old-time lover.
Until the great and terrible thing crashed into their home! And taught them how true romance mayijive! A picture with all
the allurement and charm of William de Mille's "Midsummer Madness," yet finer and deeper far.
