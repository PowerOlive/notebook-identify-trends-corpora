Has Ordered Several Companiesof State Troops to the SceneHazleton Pa Sept 11 The strikesituation reached a terrible crisis onthe outskirts of Latimer Friday afternoon when a band of deputy sheriffsfired into an infuriated mob of minersThe men fell like so many sheep andthe excitement since has been so in-tense that no accurate figures of thedead and wounded can be obtainedReports run from 15 to 20 odd killedand 40 or more wounded One manwho reached the scene Friday nightcounted 13 corpses Four other bodieslie in the mountains between Latimerand Harleigh Those who were notinjured carried their dead and wounded friends into the woods and estimateis baffledThe strikers left Hazleton at 330oclock Friday afternoon announcingtheir intention to go to Latimer Assoon as this became known a band ofdeputies was loaded on a trolley carand went whirling across the mountainto the scene where the bloody conflictfollowed After reaching Latimer theyleft the car and formed into three companies under Thomas Hall E A Hessand Samuel B Price They drew upin line at the edge of the village witha lence ana a line oi nouses m tneirrearSheriff Martin was in entire command and stood in the front of the lineuntil the strikers approached Theywere seen coming across the ridge andSheriff Martin went out to meet themThe men drew up sullenly and listened in silence until he had once moreread the riot act This finished a lowmurmuring arose among the foreigners and there was a slight movementforward Perceiving this the sheriffstepped toward them and in a determined tone forbade advance Someone struck the sheriff andthe next moment there was acommand to the deputies to fire Theguns of the deputies instantly belchedforth a terrible volley The reportseemed to shake the very mountainsand a cry of dismay went up from thepeople The strikers were taken entirely by surprise and as the men toppled and fell over each other thosewho remained unhurt stampeded Themen went down before the storm ofbullets like tenpins and the groans ofthe dying and wounded filled the airThe excitement that followed wassimply indescribable The deputiesseemed to be terror stricken at thedeadly execution of their guns and seeing the living strikers fleeing like wildand others dropping to the earth theywent to the aid of the unfortunatesvhom they had brought downAt Farleys hotel there were two menlying on the porch Both had beenshot in the headOne had three bullets in him Hisgroans and appeals for a doctor ordeath were heartrending All alongthe re ad the wounded men who wereable to leave the field of battle scattered themselves and sought the shadeof the trees for protection but therewas no need of that then Approaching the place where the shooting occurred people were met wringing theirhands and bemoaning the catastropheThey could not talk intelligently andit was with the greatest difficulty thatinformation could be gleanedAlong the bank of the trolley roadmen lay in every position some deadothers dying Three bodies face downward lay along the incline and threeothers were but a short distance awayOn the other side of the road as manymore bodies lay The school house wastransformed into a temporary hospitaland some of the wounded were takenthere The colliery ambulance wassummoned to the place as soon as possible and upon its arrival two menboth shot through the legs wereloaded into the wagon All along thehillside wounded men were found onthe green on the roadside and in thefields Many others who had beencarried to a distance could not befoundAmid the excitement the deputiesturned their attention to the woundedand carried many of them to placeswhere they could be more comfortablytreatedIIariusburg Pa Sept 11 GovHastings Friday night ordered out

into conference atthe executive mansionand has arranged for the speedy transportationof the soldiersHazelton Pa Sept 13 The situation here Sunday night was graverthan it has been at any time since thebloody affray of Friday afternoonThere is strong reason to fear a conflict between the slfrikers and the military Monday and there is an indication that from five to seven thousandmore miners will join the malcontentsFeeling continues high against Sheriff Martin and his deputies and the intensity of the situation is such that asudden turn of the head or a wordspoken above the ordinary tone bringsa running crowd The soldiers arewatchful and ready for any emergencyand the people of the town are in astate which may easily become panicAn incident of ugly omen occurredduring the funeral of three of the victims Sunday afternoon As services wasbeing held inside of the St Josephsa --church about 2000 foreigners werecongregated about the doors A number of them raised their voices andit is declared by eye witnessesthat a policeman stationed nearthe door became unduly officiousInstantly an ominous muttering followed mingled with scowling looksand clenched fists Word was immediately carried indoors to Rev FatherAust He hurried to the door andbundled the men who seemed mostquarrelsome in the church A fewwords of counsel to the others prevented further demonstrationsTrouble is in the air and if it is tocome the time will be Monday Thisis clear from the words used Sundaynight by Gen Gobin commander ofthe Third brigade The striking minershave made elaborate preparations for ademonstration at the funeral of ten ofthe victims which is fixed for half pastten oclock in tne morningThe military authorities are determinedthat nothing of the kind shall be permitted and that from this time onthere shall be no marching of any character whatsoever whether duringfunerals or otherwise This resolutionis not generally known and the minersare going on with their arrangementsGen Gobin talked over the telephone to Gov Hastings for anhour or more Sunday afternoonHe said he had merely made aformal report to the governor of thesituation It is apparent howeverthat the commander is not cheered bythe immediate outlook although hesays he thinks there will be no furtherturbulence He would not say whenthe troops are likely to be withdrawnand he has resolved to act with the utmost rigorFurthermore he made a revelationwhich put a startling aspect upon thesituation This was that the house ofthe engineer of No 3 colliery had beenbroken into late Saturday night by sixmasked men and the engineerwho is a cripple unmercifully beathim There is no clew to theidentity of the assailants Theonly work the man1 has been doing lately is the pumping necessaryto free the mine from water The general had also received a formal reportof the Audenreid outrage of lastThursday night when strikers brokeinto the house of Gomer Jones superintendent of the Lehigh and Wilkesbarre Coal Co Jones whose unpopularity with the miners was one ofthe first causes of the strikewas not there but the men literallywrecked the interior of the house andthen attacked a mine power housenearby and stole therefrom a quantityof dynamite As soon as he heard ofthis Gen Gobin assigned a guard ofthe Thirteenth regiment to remain atAudenreidThe addition to the strikers ranks ifmade will be the men at Coxes minesand should they go out the last biganthracite company in the region willbe idle It was not kn6wn until Sunday that the 2000 men employed at colliery No 7 had a meeting at StocktonSaturday night and drew up a petitionto the operators demanding an increasein wages of ten per cent This will bepresented Sunday and the action in theevent of refusal is strike It is accepted as a fact that if these men goout all the others employed by thecompany will join them making thetotal number something between fiveand seven thousand from these minesalone The Coxe men had already beenoffered an increase but rejected it onthe ground that it was still lower thanthe scale paid by the other operators inthe region These men have beenworking steadily up to this time and oflate up to ten oclock at nightTo all intent and purpose Hazletonis under martial law Gen Gobin declared Sunday night that in spite ofwarrants issued for the arrests of Sheriff Martin and his deputies no constables or civic authority will be permitted to arrest the men He said thatthe sheriff is an executive officerwhose duty is to preserve the peaceand that he Gobin and the troops arereally subordinate to the sheriff at thistime being engaged in helping him toperform that duty Under these circumstances he will not permit interference with the sheriffs officials solong as the militia is here In spite ofthis fine distinction the commandersdecision on this point is accepted assuperceding the civil authorities by themilitary powerThe events of Sunday were the deathof another of the wounded Jacob Tomashantos the 18-year-old

the facts seem tobe that both the passenger and freightwere going at full speed about 20miles an hour for the passenger and 10or 12 for the freightOne report as to the cause of the accident is to the effect that Conductor Burbank of the Colorado Midland stocktrain made a mistake of ten minutesin figuring on the time when the RioGrande passenger train passed Newcastle and that therefore he was chieflyresponsible for the disaster EngineerOstrander of the stock train couldeither confirm or deny this report ifhe was alive but it is believed he isunder the debrisThe passengers in the day coach

Peck N O TimesDemocratThe Old Silver TrailBY MARY E STICKNEYCopyright 1896 by J B Lippincott CoCHAPTER m ContinuedYou are so kind Dorothy returnedIier eyes very bright as she looked downat him I am sure you did not guessthat night how grateful we were Wewere so tongue tied with excitementso wholly upset But afterward Iwould have been so glad of an opportunity to thank you again It troubledme to think we had said so little whenyou had been so kindIt was more than kind of you notto think it presumption he answeredlier flushing with pleasure I confess it rather looked like that to mewhen you had so courteously dismissedone at the door of the Colorado buildingand I persisted in still keeping you insight down the walkBut what a relief it was to me tofind you there when that alarm cameand the lire company came rushing byand the crowd jostled me about It wasso soon after the Cold Storage disaster and the idea of fire threw me into apanic to say nothing of the fact thatthejerowd seemed disposed to tramplemeo death without perceiving me aall I was so grateful to you for seeing me she added smiling down afchim with perhaps more of kindnessthan she knew in the depths of her eyesYou seemed like an old friend then afriend in needAnd how grateful I was to that firealarm for giving me a chance to assume the attitude he eagerly exclaimed And when I ventured to assume that it might give me a pretext towalk along beside you ah Miss Meredith I trembled for my audacity thena good deal more than when I was burglarizing up in the Colorado buildingI can hardly credit that I remember you as perfectly cool and self-possessedshe declared holding up hersoft cap as though to shield her facefrom the fire in reality making it serveas a screen to hide the blush she could-feel burning upon her cheeks Andwhat a mercy it was that you did comein view of the fact that Mrs Halletwas not waiting for me at the placewe had agreed upon With the darkness and the crowds about the electricfountains I should have been wild ifyou had not been there to help me findher And when she had been discovered and it further developed that sheliad lost the child and his nurse whyyou were a regular godsend It was sucha time of mishapsYou did seem rather out of luck fora fact he laughed though when youmake so much of my small services Ifeel anything but sympathetic in away I cant be sorry that it happenedBut I never clearly understood by theway how your friend happened to letthe boy get away from her Was it inher hunt for youOh no we had left little Paul withIlls nurse looking at the trained animalsover in the Midway late in the afternoon arranging that they were 10take supper at some place over therewhere the girl had a friend employedI fancy it was her sweetheart from heranxiety to patronize the place At allevents it was settled that they wereto be left to their own devices untilseven oclock when they were to meetus by the electric fountains But MrsHallet and I became absorbed in haggling over some curios at one of the Algerian bazaars over by the anthropological building and before we knew itit was after seven oclock Of courseshe felt that she must fly to keep herappointment with little Paul while it-as hastily settled that I should takeifce intramural train around to the Colorado building and get my jacketwhich I had left there It had neveroccurred to her that she had arrangedher rendezvous at the spot which wassure to be most crowded at that hourwhere everybody was gathering f ortheIllumination but when she came thered course it was like hunting a needle inx haystack to find the child and nurseAnd then as it grew dark and heri earch continually appeared napre hopeless while I also failed to come backthe uoor woman was simply wild Itseemed very funny in retrospect such3 chapter of incidents but it did not appeal to our sense of humor atthctimeAI should imj not be sympathetlookingically rejoined adding with good cheeressentially masculine But you cameout of it all rightThanks to you And now to haveyou come a second time to rescue mefrom despair She paused expressively looking at him as though in newamazement as she reflected upon thestrangeness of such happenings Didyoir recognize me at once but I remember you called me by my nameNow I think of it though I am surprised that you know my name I didnot suppose I mentioned it that nightYou did not but I heard your friendcall you Dorothy he confessed Itis not verv common the name andDorothy Meredith was the only Dorothy to be found in 20 pages of thevisitors book at the Colorado building I liad plenty of time to lookwhile I was waiting for you to comeHis face had flushed deeply and therewas a curious light in his eyes as hesmiled up at herIt flashed upon the girl that to awoman who loved him he would be simvply adorable with that smile upon hislace and tnen ner cneeics too Teadened for the f roward thought and shehastily moved away as she murmureda comprehensive OhI felt most certain of the name hewent on but you made your addresscruelly vague dont you know It wassimply Colorado There was not evena hint as to where you might be foundin ChicagoOh it was simply a tribute of loyally to Colorado signing the name at allshe hurriedly rejoined embarrassmentgrowing upon her for the frank admission of how much he had cared to seeher again And then I am rather likethe man who was born down Cape Codand all along shore I could hardly layclaim to any fixed place of abodeNo he returned interestedly thetone courteously interrogativeI was born in Colorado she explained with an air of friendly confidence but the altitude never agreedI might be educated there and partlyfor the sake of her own health Sincethen I have only been back for occasional visits but I have always called Colorado home And now I suppose I shallbe here more Her face clouded overas after a brief hesitation she addedMy mother died last springIndeed he murmured Seeing thathe seemed easting about in his mind forfurther comment the girl hastened toadd with kindly garrulity We wereto have gone abroad this summer papaand I but just at the last minute wewere stopped by a wretched lawsuithere at Windy Gulch Perhaps by theway you know my father Col MeredithYes I know him the young manadmitted rather drjly as it seemeddragging his box a little farther fromthe fire which brought his face moreinto shadow irrelevantly adding in atone which somehow struck the girl asodd And so it was this lawsuit whichbrought you to Windy Gulch and gaveme the pleasure of meeting you againYes It is strange how things turnout is it not She looked at him witha rather baffled feeling conscious o avague sense of irritation For her ownpart she had been so cordially frankthere was even a rankling suspicion inher mind that she had been more friendly than the conditions might warrantOnly reciprocal confidence could herelieve the situation from awkwardnessnow And do you live here at WindyGulch she went on curiosity in herglanceThat is my post office address hesaid devoting himself to putting morewood on the fire with rather an inscrutable smile I live so far as it can becalled living up at my mine Whichleminds me starting up abruptlycontrition in his air I promised youI would ride over to the Grubstake andlet your father know that you are allright I had almost forgotten it butwould you like me to go nowWhat and leave me alone hereDorothy cried in a tone of sharp protestNot unless you like of courseThe fact is I have been thinkingpapa might not be there himself shewent on He rode over to Tomtownthis afternoon to see a surveyor therea Mr Brigham It is a bad road yoiknow and with a storm and all itseems as though he might have been detained does it notI should think it quite probablethe 3roung man returned looking at herwith an expression of keen interestHe rode over to see Brigham did yousay And then the odd shamefacedlook upon his face he added prefacingthe hurried explanation with a note oflaughter that seemed strangely forcedBrigham is rather a friend of mineyou seeIs heMiss Meredith returnedat him in vague surprise Ifancj papa does not know him very wellIn fact heDont Miss Meredith You mustnot he brusquely interrupted I wasa cad to let you say a word about himbut He rose hurriedly leaving thesentence unfinished while he went tothe door and looked out with an air ofseeing nothing I beg a thousandpardons he said gently presentlylurning back seeming very big andbroad shouldered as he stood lookingdown at her but the fact is your father -has a lawsuit on you spoke of ita moment ago and in such cases eventrivial things admissions that mightseem almost nothing might reallymake grave mischief Especially under the circumstances well I shouldbe very sorry to take an unfair advantage by letting you say anything youmight afterward be sorry for youknowBut I have not said anything thegirl protested looking wholly bewilderedNo you have not said anythinghe said soothingly his eyes seeming toher entreat forgiveness Only pardonme for offering advice if I were youMisa Meredith I would never speak toa stranger of your fathers movementsOf course in nine cases out of ten noharm might be done but then againyou might regret itI think my error in the present casewas in assuming that you were not astranger her face flushed an angryred frank mortification in her eyesBut has it not stopped raining Ithought as you opened the door that itseemed almost clearBlundering chump that I am I havemade you hate me he impetuously exclaimedOh by no means her chin verymuch in the air I never trouble tohate strangersBut it was a mere question of timeI suppose he gloomily went on hardly addressing the remark to her Soonor late you were bound to have it in formeThere was startled questioning in thegirls swift glance and then she lookedaway Did you say it had stoppedraining she asked stiffly after a momentvI believe it has he dully rejoinedgoing to the door to look out againYes it has stopped I suppose Iwould better go for the horsesThe spirit of frank good fellowship inwhich they had -renewed their unconventional acquaintance in the shelter ofthe old hut seemed to have been lost inits shadows In almost sullen silencethey rode along over the rough trailmaking toward the turning to the Mascot mine At first she coldly protestedagainst his coming withherbuthe saidthat it had grown too late for him toride on then to the raih for wThich hehad started out he womd have to makethe trip another day and now if shereally did not mind he xyould prefer togo back With chill indifference MissMeredith assented and then they rodealong with the silence scarce brokenbut for the splashing fall of garneredrain drops from the

ablaze with wrath She wassurprised at the vehemence of her feeling at the poignant sense of disappointment and ill usage which was filling her with desire to visit with fiercepunishment his air of smiling unconcern I suppose it seemed to you ajoke to take me in to delude me withtalk of your acquaintance with my father to let me go on as though you hadbeen an old friend until I had been betrayed to such a frankness of speechthat even you were ashamed ofthe mean advantage you were taking I did guess after that atleast I thought there must be something but I could not I would not believe it could be so bad as this I wasso sure that you were ajentlemanSee here Miss Meredith you are going too far he interposed authoritatively a light in his eyes before whichher angry glance wavered I did notforce myself upon you you must remember that I ran across you by accident just as I did at the worlds fairI found you in a pouring rain yourwrist sprained and your horse foundered In common decency I could dono less than take you to shelter and Itried to behave like a gentleman youmust at least give credit for the intention I did not talk of any acquaintancewith your father I merely admittedthat

would have a hard time making me tell anythingThe boys continued discussing whatthey would and would not do in theevent of their being taken prisoners bythe British Meanwhile the Seagull-which the boys declared was the fastest boat in New York harbor was making good use of her wings and showingthat she deserved their boast Theyhad passed through the Narrows andwere rapidly nearing Sandy HookI

were almost too excited totalk and as soon as they droppedanchor again at their mooring placethey hurried ashore and started on arun for thetown to inform the committee of safety of their discovery and theletterAlmost the first man they met wasMr TreversOh Mr Trevers theres a Britishprovision ship down at the HookWhats thatA British ship down by the Hookand w6 think shes loaded wjth provisions

wait for me I willnotify the rest of the committee I wantthem to hear your storyWithin the hour the committee ofsafety had assembled The boys repeated their story and then the letterwhich had been given them by theofficer was read It ran as followsOn Eoard of His Majestys TransportShip the DeerhoundSandy Hook July 1775To Gen Sir Henry Clinton Commanderof His Majestys Troops in America andGovernor of New YorkSir I have the honor to inform you thatI have arrived in the harbor with a cargoof provisions for the troops under yourcommand and also some choice delicaciesand wine for your own tableI am at anchor near Sandy Hook andrespectfully await your commandsI am sir most respectfully your obedient and humble servantGEOFFREY HENDERSONCommander of the DeerhoundThe boys galnced proudly aT eachother to see their suspicions verifiedDid she carry any cannonNot that we could seeWere there many men on boardWe only saw the sailors who werefurling the sails and the man and theofficer who spoke to us We think sirif you will pardon our boldness thatshe could -easily be capturedThe boy is rightWe will do itThe boys were questioned closelyupon all they had seen and then thecommittee held a long consultation asto the plan to be pursued to capture theship thus adding to their own storesand crippling the enemyThe British had found it necessary tosend provisions across the sea to theirtroops in America as not only weresupplies scarce in the colonies but thepatriots destroyed whatever they couldnot use themselves that was likely tofall into the enemys hands At thistime food was at a premium with boththe Americans and the British and theprovisions aboard the Deerhound wouldbe as grateful an addition to the patriots store as it would be a severe lossto the British So these patriots ofElizabethport were more than willingto take the risk in order to capture thesupplies To fight men must eat andas they ate that they might fight sothey often fought that they might eatThat afternoon fourlorge boats putout from Elizabethport each mannedby two rowers who apparently werefishermen cBut a search under thehatches would have shown each boattc be loaded with men patriots whowere all heavily armed witih musketsswords and pistols Among them inthe leading boat crouched Frank andWalter They had been taken alongupon their earnest solicitation representing that they were needed to showwhere the British ship lay But theydetermined earlier in the day to domore than act as pilotsIm not going to be left out of thefighting if I canihelp it are you saidWalterNot much but Im afraid they wontlet us have any armsWell get some for ourselves and notlet them know itTuntil we get thereWhere can- we get anyI saw a lot of them when we were atthe hall They Svont all be used Wecan get some without their seeing u IthinkCome onji 3The two boys were favored by chanceas no one -was at the Hxall wlien theyreached there nearly everyone in thetown being down- at the beach watchingthe preparations for the expeditionThey secured a cutlass and pistol apiecewith ammunition Then came thequestion how to conceal the weaponslb was easy enough with the pistols butwith the swords it was a much moredifficult matter Finally they concluded to put them inside their hirtsand down the legs oft itlheir breechesThis made walking rather awkwardbut the boys hoped to escape detectionand in the excitement of the preparations they dad so As they lay in th edark hatchway they fairly trembledwith suppressed excitement and infact the older members of the littlband were not too self possessedIt was aiearly dusk when a sailor onboard the Beerhound sang outFour boats on the staboard bowsirWhat are theyLook like fishing craft sirMany menTwo in each boat sirHow arejthey headedThis way sirGood Hail them when they tnear enough and tell them to comealongside Id not mind a messof freshfishAy ay sirThe four boats drew slowly nearerand upon- being hailed by the sailorthey

boardI will that sir more than youlllikeWhat say youIll send as many as you want sirAll right send them alongThe supposed fisherman them turnedunnecessarily loudGet out the fishThis was the agreed signal and thewords had no sooner left his lips thanthe hatches were burst open and thearmed Americans swarmed up the sidesof the shipCapt Henderson had given a surprised shout at this catch of what wereindeed strange fish and they were farmore than he likediMr Trevers finally managed to et f His shout and the siglit of the climb-Deerhound They sprang for theirarms and what was not an altogetherpleasant surprise to the Americanswere joined by a company of soldierswho came pouring up from below gunsin hand This put the numbers in favorof the British but the Americans hesitated not a momentFrank had sprung for and graspedthe anchor chain up which he wentfollowed by Walter their swords between their teeth and the pistols stuckin their waistbands As Frank leapeddown from the bulwarks his footcaught and he fell headlong on thedeck One of the soldiers sprang forward and in another moment wouldhave run- him through with his bayonetbut Walter was right behind his chumHe had one leg over thesideof the shipwhen he saw the soldier spring atFrank Walter whipped the pistol outand hardly waiting to aim fired andhad the satisfaction of1 seeing the manfall when he was within a foot of FrankFrank was on his feet again in a minute he grasped his friends hand for asecond without speaking and thenthe two boys dashed into the fray Ina few minutes from the first shout thedeck of the ship was the scene of a hoiand fierce fightThe Americans were forward led byMr Trevers while the British sailorsand soldiers were massed just abaft themainmast There was not much timefor any formation as the fight beganwhen the first American put his foot ondeck It was shoot cut slash andstumble Back and forth across thedeck raged the conflict at one time itseemed as though the Americans wouldbe driven dack to their boats but theywere rallied by the cry of RememberLexingtonFrom then on the British were drivenslowly but surely back The two boysplayed their parts manfully more thanonce saving each others lifeThe conflict though sharp was shortthere was a final rush on the part of theAmericans and then less than half anhour from the time the first shot wasfired the Americans were in full possession of the ship with the defeatedBritish prisoners They had been takencompletely by surprise and lost nearly30 men while the American loss wasbut four killed and half-a-dozenwounded The captors manned theDeerhound and sailed her up to Elizabethport where her cargo was landedamid the cheers of the whole town whocrowded the shoreFrank and Walter were the heroes ofthe day and the

could read abillet doux or comprehend an excoriation in that kind of characters An incident which occurred recently illustrates this very wellAbout six months ago a druggist onone of the prominent streets on theSouth side decided to adopt the reigning Japanese craze and have his storebambooed all over He got a downtown firm of decorators at work Theywere not long in giving every conceivable thing in the store a fishing rod effect Besides this they put a fewdragons on the ceiling and some YumiiYums above the soda water fountainand finall3r to complete a very ornatejob they placed on one side of the doorframe on the outside of the building aJapanese scrollThe store was the admiration of theproprietor and all his friends He informed himself on Japanese lore andwas able to explain everything prettywell except the inscription outside Itlooked a good deal like a laundry ticketbut he assured his friends that to behonest with them he didnt think itmeant anything and was merely an idlecreation of the man who did the workAfter some time it passed out of hismindOne day last week however a subject of the mikado who is studying inChicago came into the store with abroad grin on his

LAWIt Has Forty Two Provisions Warranted to Confuse Any ProspectorThe law regulating the control of rubber trees in the republic of Bolivia waspromulgated a year and a half ago andconsists of 24 articles warranted to perplex and confuse the most astute citizenof North South or Central AmericaArticle I declares that all rubber treeswhich may grow in forests or unclaimedland are the property of the government The right to explore the publicforests for rubber trees is limited byarticle II to all natives or foreignersNo previous license is required andsuch explorations may be made by anynumber of persons at the same timeA person residing for five years in acommunity in Bolivia is considered theproprietor of thelandprovided theareaof theland does not exceed 75 hectaresAll persons or companies to whom ex iploration privileges are granted shallpay 15 bolivianos for each estrada andjthe payments are to bements of one boliviano a year At theexpiration of that period presumablythe period of a year the grantees havaabsolute right to the ownership of theland without taxation and also theright to 25 hectares for every hundredestradas which they had previously received To enjoy this right the grantedmust prove that he has paid all installsmerits but those who either by donation purchase permium or by contractwith the government acquire possession of public lands are obliged undeaarticle XI to pay 750 bolivianos for tharubber trees standing on the landA petitioner for such grants must ap spear before the national delegates irjthe regions in wnich they exercisqtheir jurisdiction He must state hisname domicile and profession titlewhich he intends to give to the portionof the forest land claimed the area ancjboundaries of it and the names of hisjnearest neighbors The petitioner iialso to present a map of the groundiThe notary of the treasury as the recording officer is called in Bolivia filesthe application and directs the publication of the petition in the newspapersof the neighborhood three times consecutively every 20 days At the end oi60 days the petitioner if unopposed byhis neighbors and others gets a decreqto the land provided the verification othe territory is witnessed and approvedby two experts one appointed by thjpetitioner and the other appointed bjgovernment The fees and traveling expenses of the experts their sustenanceand entertainment are paid for by thepetitioner When all these formalitiesare attended to the petitioner underarticle XXII must immediately takopossession and go to work for if threemonths elapse before he does so unlessthrough some impediment or insuperable obstacle he shall forfeit all claimsand rights which he has securedHe must also stipulate as acondition of occupancy to permit the free introduction of groceries into the community where he resides groceries with the exception ofliquors The fine for violation of thisprovision is from 50 to 200 bolivianosand altogether it would seem a

of dipping sheep is avery commendable one In fact it isconsidered absolutely necessary forthe preservation of a flock Many onthe western range think that sheepthere are free from all diseases butthe fact remains that while sheep mayrun a year or two and show no signsof being affected in any way theremay be a few sheep that are affectedand consequently the whole flockmust be dipped to reach the

to the dilemma that confronts the man who settles down to one way of doing thingswithout so much as a thought aboutchanging his plans and methods to suitchanging conditions says the KansasFarmer We may use the feeding problem as an illustration of the point inquestion When corn is comparativelycheap or as might be said during thelast feeding season absolutely belowcost of production the feeder does notfeel justified in buying more concentrated feeds in any form whatever formaking up a balaa ced ration In onesense he is a loser by this neglect butupon the whole no doubt he is on thesafer

fodder if he would it would unquestionably be the better policy tofeed simply corn and corn fodder Andthis is exactly what feeders have beendoing upon the whole Yet the experiment is a valuable one in demonstrating how necessary it is that the feedergo about his business intelligently andthoughtf ully if he expects to get themost possible out of it in the way ofprofits Because he has found it

fattening hogsby a wonderful method The plan wasthis Three pig pens were built onehaving several lean scrub swineknown as xazor backs the centralone being empty and the third containing the blooded animal which itwas desired to fatten The scheme wasto let the fine pig into the central yardand let him eat all he could out of thetrough When he had as much as hecould hold a hungry pig would be letin and of course begin to eat It being a pigs nature to eat as long as ittaw another pig -do so the man reasoned that the fiull pig would immediately set to work again and take another meaL When the razor back wasfull he was to be taken out and a thirdhungry pig brought in when the sameperformance would be gone throughagain Philadelphia TimesRiffht Size of TurkeysPeople as a rule do not want

built of brickis arranged a9 a model nursery whilethe other is used for the offices of thenurses and medical men in chargeThe most important considerations inthe vitality of premature infants

employed to a limited ex- jtent but nothing so regular and uniform so pure and wholesome in itsoperation has heretofore been devisedThe new apparatus was explained tothe audience of Prof Coney of Heidelberg its paramount qualification being the automatic maintenance of auniform temperature the incubatoris a metal and glass case under a cubicyard in capacity The front portionis formed by two swinging doors Thechild rests on the coverlet of a fine wirehiammock suspended from the fourcorners The air is supplied through apipe four inches in -diameter connectedwith an air box and before enteringit is made moist by passing through asmall sheet of antiseptic absorbentwool The air then passes throughdry wool which retains the soot andother impurities of the atmosphereFrom this filter the air traverses another pipe leading to the center of theincubator Over its- orifice is placed a Jdisk for uniformly distributing the airand above all is a three foot chimneywith a horizontal revolving fan whichcompels the exhausted air to escapeThe uniform heating- of the case isproduced by hot water drawn from anexternal boiler heated by paraffin gasor electricity the circulation being effectedby a copper pipe running beneaththe wire hammock In the right handwall is fixed a thermostat connected toalight chain which suspends analuminum cone lid over the lamp of theboiler and its expansions and contractions automatically control the temperature to the oTegree to which the apparatus is set A thermometer suspended inside one of the glass doorsrenders possible observations of thetemperature of the interior while ahygrometer similiarly indicates themoisture of the air within LondonStandardPROTECTING THE BIRDSEfforts t8top tlie Slaughter of theSongstersIt is the evident duty of all good citizens to do everything in their power toprotect the song birds In a neighborhood near Baltimore a mutual agreement has been made among the largerholders of property that strict ordersshall be given to every employe to refrain from molesting birds of any kindexcept the crows This agreement although only a ear old has wroughtmiracles and in the spring summer andautumn the trees in that neighborhoodare full of the most exquisite musicand in the mornings there is a regularorchestral chorus beginning with thebreak of day and chattering its merrycourse until sundown and afterThere are strict laws against theslaughter of cong birds in many statesbut they are indifferently enforcedThere are two factors that must bedealt with the small boy who slaysfrom mere wantonness and the millinery fiend The small boy can be controlled by the law The millinery offenders must be reached by public sentiment An officer of the New York museum of natural history an institutionwhich we advise all who have the opportunity to visit recently said thatin the course of two afternoons in NewYork he saw on the hats worn by women 173 wild birds or parts of them representing more than 40 different speciesWhat this means must be plain to thecommonest understanding It is thatthe birds which furnish us music thebirds which give life to our trees thebirds which were placed on earth tosing the birds which we love are simply sacrificed to the caprices of fashionPublic sentiment must sop this slaughter Leslies WeeklyTlieir DecorationsMaud I have an uncle who distinguished himself in the

time in three months The letterstated that it was a very bad case and herrecovery was such a surprise to the neighbors that it created considerable gossipBeing anxious to learn the absolute factsin the case a special reporter was sent tohave a talk with the girl and her parentsThey were not at home however being somedistance away A message was sent to MrStevens asking him to write up a full

feel it my duty totell you of her caseTwo years ago this winter Mabel begancomplaining of pains in her limbs principally in her lower limbs She was going toschool and had to walk about three quarters of a mile each day going through allkinds o weather She was thirteen yearsold and doing so well in her studies that Idisliked to take her from school but we hadto do itFor several months she was confined tothe house and she grew pale and dwindleddown to almost nothing Her legs and armswere drawn up ana ner appearance wasEitiful Several doctors had attended herut it seemed that none of them did herany good They advised us to take her tothe springs but times were so hard we couldnot afford it although we finally managedto get her to the Martinsville baths Hereshe grew suddenly weaker and it seemedthat she could not stand it but she becamebetter and it seemed that she was beincbenefited but she suddenly grew worse andwe had to bring her homeShe lingered along and last winter became worse again and was afflicted with anervous trouble almost like the St Vitusdance For some time we thought she woulddie and the physicians gave her up Whenshe was at her worst a neighbor came inwith a box of Dr Williams Pink Pills forPale People and wanted us to try them asthey were advertised to be good for suchcases and her daughter had used them fornervousness with such good results that shethoueht they might help MabelWe tried them The first box helpedher some and after she had taken threeboxes she was able to sit up in bed Whenshe had finished a half dozen boxes she wasable to be out and about She has takenabout nine boxes altogether now and she isas well as ever and going to school everyday having started in again three weeksago Her cure was undoubtedly due tothese
