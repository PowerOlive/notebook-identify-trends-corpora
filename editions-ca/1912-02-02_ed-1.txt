There wasno beating about the bush. They declared they had been"misrepresented"by Cantrill, and stood ready to resentthe action of the committee and theDougressman.There was only a small nunber ofDemocrats present at the meetng heldhere last Saturday, but they were arepresentative lot and the resolutionsthey adopted voiced the sentiments ofthe majority of the Democrats in Bourbon who believe in fair dealings andhonest primaries.The matters is up to the committeeof this district or the State CentralCommittee. One of the two bodiesmust take action. Dishonesty in politics is a thing of the past so far a3the masses are concerned. The Democrats wont stand to ba led about bythe nose by Cantrill or politicians of alike calibre, and it is time for one orthe other of the committees to figurewhish is for the best interest of theparty.Protection.To Be Sure.The Flemings-urg Gazette in itscurrent issue has the following to say :"While Mr. Cantrill and DeshaBreckinridge are arguing the meritsof the former's services as a publicofficer, our mind cannot but revertback to Cantriil's record in the Kentucky Legislature. There are questions concerning nis history at Frankfort which were never satisfactorilycleared up to the public's mind."The following is an extract from anappeal sent by the 15,000 men, womenand children striking textile wokers atLawrence, Mass., to W. M. Wood,president of the woolen trust:"We are of the opinion that youhave had ample time to consider thedemands of the mea, women and children who have made the AmericanWoolen company what it is today. Inview of the fact that machinery hasbeen improved, .the workers turn offmore and more work, but they are notpaid accordingly, even though the priceof food, clothing and shelter has inmany cases increased 50 and 100 percent within the last few years."We, the committee, are willing tomeet the officials of the company atany time and submit the grievances ofthe strikers. So if,1 you believe in asquare deal ycu will not refuse to meetwith us, but will ccme forward at onceand try to bring .the trouble to a finalconclusion, ifou must bear in mindthe fact that these men, women ai dchildren have not gone on strike forlight op transient causes, but becausethey could no longer bear up under theburdens lad upon their shoulders. TheAmerican Woolen company has withinthb past few years built several mills,which are paid for, according to yourown figures, and the company haaevenin the worst of times managed to paydividens."The workers are of the opinionthat the only competition left is thestruggle among themselves for amiserable job at $6, $7 to $8 a week.This is how schedule K "potects"the working man, solely for whosebenefit the Payne-Aldrich bill (according to Payne and Aldrich) was passed.Since the protectionists admit thatSchedule K, which places a heavy taxon every article of woolen clothingsold in the United States, was designed solely to benefit the workingman inthe woolen industry, and since the $5,$7 and $8 wages paid by the woolentrust demonstrates beyond successfulcontradiction that Schedule K does notprotect the workers, why should theAmerican people longer tolerate Schedule K.Much Harder Question."What," said an interviewer to acandidate, "do you intend to do ifyou are elected?"

All members of thefirm has returned from a purchasingtour through (Illinois and Iowa andinromises tne animals the hsst Averbrought to Kentucky.Opposed to Action.The Georgetown News, published inthe home county of CongressmanCampbell Cantrill, expresses its disapproval of the action of the SeventhDistrict Committee, and says the primary wias called for the"unmistakablepurpose of 'freezing' out oppositionregardless of the wishes of the rankand file of the party. Further theNews says :"In this the home county of Mr.Cantrill there are quite a number ofDemocrats who have not only expressed their disapproval of the action ofthe committee, but are ready and willing to unite with the opposition in theother counties in the district in bringing about some fair means wherebythe will of the majority of the Democrats in the district may govern in theselection of the nominee."There was a time when this sort of"practical" politics cnuld be put overon the people without meeting withanj serious resentment. But thankgoodness the time has come when thepeople are not only opposed to suchpolitical i methods, (but will demandthe same fair dealing in political matters as expected in other things."Why One Still Lived."How many deaths?" asked the hospital physician, while going hisrounds. "Nine." "Why, I ordered medicine for ten." "Yes, but one wouldn'ttake It"THEATRICAL."THE TRAVELING SALESMAN."The first act of "The Traveling Salesman," which A. S. Stern will send tothe Paris Grand Monday, February 5,represents the railroad depot of a smallmiddle West town, with the usual furnishings that go with this structure ina rural district. The model which Mr.Forbes has taken for his comedy issaid to really be from a village in theWestern part of Indiana, to which Mr.Forbes journeyed during the writingof the play and where he spent severaldays in the study of his subject. Notcontent with merely a replica of hislittle depot, the author opened negotiations with the railroad officials to buythe old benches with the high backs,which for years had done duty in thislittle waiting room, and upon which theboys and girls of the village had carvedtheir names side by side.The company which Mr. Stern willsend to Paris is the orignal New Yorkand Chicago one, headed by Robert E.O'Connor, and which added to the success of the play's metropolitan runsvery materially."THE GIRL OF EAGLE RANCH.""The Girl of Eagle Ranch," acomedy drama, founded on actual factsthat transpired in Arizona on the wellknown "Z" ranch will be the attraction at the Paris Grand one night, Friday, February 2, and will be presentedby George W.

MONTGOMERY AND STONE IN"THE OLD TOWN."It is pardonable to assume that notsince the visit of Bernhardt has anyannouncement been received with bomuch pleasurable anticipation thanthat of the soming of Montgomery andStone in one of their greatest musicalcomedy successes "The Old Town,"which is underlined for production atthe Lexington Opera House, matineeard night, February 7.Montgomery and Stone are makiugtheir first Southern tour. Not sincethey have achieved fame and fortunehave they ever left the precinct otthat popularity which haa been solelyconfined to the largest of the Easterncities where in many instance theyhave remained a whole year at a time,and that in but one piece. The demandfor their appearance in the far Westand the North and South has been soimperative that Montgomery and Stonehave at last said good-bye to their constituency and have sallied forth to Imake new friends and conquer newterritory, and so it goes that the originals of "The Wizard of Oz" and "TheRed Mill" and kindred successes fin1themselves in our midst for the firsttime. In "The Old Town" it is saidthat Montgomery and ; Stone-have aworthy successor to their former creations. The two grotesque comediansappear as a couple of youths who runoff and ar stranded with a country circus. Their vicissitudes reaching homeagain furnish the nucleus of a mostamusing story. "The Old Town" hasspent practically all time in Mr. Dillingham's Globe Theatre, New Yurk,and his Studebaker Theatre, Chicago,with a few visits to the mor importantpoints. We are promised the samebeautiful production and the same no-i table cast remarked during the metropolitan engagements together withthe Old Town Pony Ballet which hasconsiderable reputation as a marvelousdancing octette of picturesque cleverness. Some eighty-five people cornprise the numerical strength of theparty necessitating special trains fortheir conveyance."THE SWEETEST GIRL IN PARIS."Trixie Friganaz and her eighty oddassociates in "The Sweetest Girl inParis," which comes to the LexnigtonOpera House, Saturday matinee andnight, February 3, are making one ofthe most extended and comprehensivetours ever undertaken in the history ofAmerican theatricals. During thepresent season of forty weeks thisgreatest of all La Salle Opera Housesuccesses, which has a record of morethan three hundred performances inChicago, will be presented in everysection of the country, from coast tocoast, and from the cities of the GreatLakes' region to the localities alongthe Gulf of Mexico. To cover so muchground in so comparatively short atime, it is necessary to employ aspecial train during most of the season, a huge expenditure when oneconsiders that this train is composedof two baggpge cars with scenery andproperties, two sleepers, a day coachand a dining car. "The Sweetest Girlin Paris" however, faces only capacityaudiences in every place it is shown,so that the expenditure is more thanworth while.especially as Harry Askindesires that Trixie Frigdnaz and "TheSweetest Girl in Paris" shall havevisited every theatrical center of anynote in the country before her appearance again at the La Salle OpreaHouse in a new vehicle next season.All mail orders address to Chas. iScott.

PresidentBacon is very hopeful of securing someexcellent timber from the youngstersthat he has under contract, and is investigating the records of severalother players who desire a berth withthe Blue Grass League Champions.The matter of securing a first baseman to take the place ot John Harnett,drafted at the close of Jast season by aVirginia League team," fis one of themost important positions to fill on theteam and the local management hasthe hooks out and hopes to have a lineon a good man by the time the seasonfor practice opens.The first of the reserves to fall intoline and send in his contract for thecoming spason is B. F. Goodman, whowas a member of the championshipteams of 1810 and 1911. GooJmansought to secure the management ofthe team this season, but tne fact thatLewis was chosen to succeed McHernan had no effect upon the sturdy out-neiaer, wno returnen nis contract early and will be here among the first inthe spring.President Bacon reports he hassigned G. C. Myer, a pitcher of Batesville, Ind.. Clem Howard, of Cyntni-ana, and P. A. Gallaway, of Cincinnati, infielders. Laac year Gallawayhad an offer of a trial with the NewYork State League for the season of1912, but preferred the Blue GrassLeague.

Heplayed a short time in the Central League, but at the time was sufferingfrom illness and returned to his home.It is said the local management willlook for him to make a strong bid forthe first base position.Howard Myers, of Bellbrook, 0., isthe only catcher signed so far to tryfor the position left vacant whenWalter Mayer was drafted by theChicago Americans. Myers is said tobe a fast coming youngster and in 28games last season batted 285 and fielded 978.Manager Joe Lewis'reports to President Bacon that he has signed PitcherWood, a brother of Wood with theBoston Americans, and pitchers Clarkand Koehler, a shortstop named Leerand a third baseman named Giles. Mr.Lewis knows all the players and thinkseach of them is capable of makinggood in this company. He has alsosigned Outfilder Fenzell,who he thinkswill prove a valuable acquisition tothe Paris team. Fenzell is said tohave turned down an offer to go withHarry Davis, but preferred to playthis season under Lewis. Two of thepitchers signed are left handers.Manager Lewis is in touch with theTri State League and thinks he canlanJ some good material there.Manager Lewis, who has attainedquite a reputation as a marksman, isnow enjoying the sport and shooting ingood form at the tournaments underthe name of Tafford.ThSMtWormEKm I I i llip 1 1 if Z) ! tON ,730 16 fJi ) iM irCopyright, 1911, by the Staadard Advertising Co.'IME casts dark shadow s ahead for him who fails toprovide for the future.

Terence O'Rourkein his hotel. O'Rourke, a military freelance and something of a gambler, isdressing for appearance in the restaurantbelow when the sound of a girlish voicesinging attracts his attention. Leaningout on the balcony he sees a beautifulgirl who suddenly disappears. He rushesto the corridor to see a neatly gownedform enter the elevator and pass fromsight.CHAPTER II. O'Rourke's mind isfilled with thoughts of the girl, and whenhe goes to the gaming table he allows hisremarkable winnings to accumulate indifferently. He notices two men watching him. One is the Hon. Bertie Glynn,while his companion is "Viscount DesTrebes, a noted duelist. When O'Rourkeleaves the table the viscount tells him herepresents the French government andthat he has been directed to O'Rourke asa man who would undertake a secretmission.CHAPTER III. At his room O'Rourke,who had agreed to undertake the mission,awaits the viscount. O'Rourke finds amysterious letter in his apartment. Theviscount arrives, hands a sealed nackaseto O'Rourke, who is not to open it untilon tne ocean. He says the French government will pay O'Rourke 25,000 francsfor his services. A pair of dainty slippers are seen protruding from under adoorway curtain and the viscount chargesO'Rourke with having a spy secretedthere.CHAPTER TV. When the Irishmangoes to his room he finds there the owner of the mysterious feet. It is his wife,Beatrix, from whom he had run away ayear previous. They are reconciled, andopening the letter he had received, hefinds that a law firm in Rangoon. India,offers him 100,000 pounds for an Indianjewel known as the Pool of Flame andleft to him by a dying friend. O'Rourketells his wife that it is in the keepingof a friend named Chambret In Algeria.CHAPTER V. O'Rourke is forced tofight a duel with the viscount. The braggart nobleman Is worsted in the combatand acts the poltroon.CHAPTER VI. The loyal wife bidsO'Rourke farewell and he promises tosoon return with the reward offered forthe Pool of Flame. He discovers bothGlynn and the viscount on board theship which takes him to Algeria.CHAPTER VII. Chambret has left Algeria and O'Rourke has to gain a military detachment going across the desertto reach his friend. As he finds the latterthere is an attack by bandits andChambret is shot.CHAPTER VIII. Chambret dies tellingO'Rourke that he has left the Pool oFlame with the governor general of Algeria. He gives the colonel a signet ringat the sight of which he says the officialwill deliver over the jewel.CHAPTER IX. O'Rourke is attackedhy Glynn and the viscount who ransackhis luggage, but he worsts them in theconflict.CHAPTER X. When he arrives at Algeria the Irishman finds the governorgeneral away. He receives a note fromDes Trebes making a mysterious appointment. CHAPTER XI. The viscount tellsO'Rourke that he has gained possessionof the jewel by stealing it from the safeof the governor general. He does not,however, know who has offered the reward for it. He suggests a duel withrapiers, the victor to get that informationand the jewel.CHAPTER XIII. The efforts ofO'Rourke are now directed toward speedily getting to Rangoon with the jeweland he starts by ship.CHAPTER XIV. He finds the captainof the vessel to be a smuggler who triesto steal the iewel from him.CHAPTER XV. The jewel is finally secured by the ship's captain and O'Rourkeescapes to land.CHAPTER XVI. With the aid of oneDanny and his sweetheart, O'Rourke recovers the Pool of Flame.tie turned toward the rear of thehouse, and as O'Rourke rose to followhim, the signal sounded on the metaldoor. Danny quickened his steps, andas he disappeared his master slippedquietly into the shadows beneath theoverhanging gallery. From this pointof seclusion he could hear distinctlythe jar of the holts as Danny openedthe iron door, followed by his hoarsewhisper: "Whist! Is ut yersilves,now?"Hole's voice answered him huskily:"Who the hell else would it be? Letus in, you damn' harp."The door creaked upon its hinges;and was cautiously closed. The boJtsrattled again. Footsteps shuffledslowly, as of men heavily burdened,over the floor of earth. Then, whileO'Rourke gathered himself together,exultation in his heart, and the foretaste of revenge sweet in his mouth,two cloaked figures scuffled into thecourtyard, breathing hard beneaththeir burdens of smuggled drug.Hole promptly dumped his share ofthe load down upon the bench andswung upon Danny. "Where's Niccovie?" he demanded, evidently in asugly a mood as he could muster."Where is 'e? Stop standin' thereand starin' with yer balmy trap open,yer ""That will be about enough," suggested O'Rourke pleasantly, in a conversational tone, stepping from hisplace of concealment "Don't callnames, Hole ye're too near your Godif ye have one, which I misdoubt."In the clear, bright starlight the pistols In his hands were plainly evident;and one stared the captain in the eye,one covered the head of the Pelican'sfirst officer."Ye will not move!" said O'Rourke,sharply, "save and except to put yourhands above1 your heads. So don'tidelay, Mr. Dennison; I've never known!ne temper to be shorter."Hole began, to splutter texoitedly.""Save your breath, ye whelp!"'O'Rourke counseled him curtly. "Ye'llnaad of it befora I'm dona withye. ,He added: "Search and disarm them, Danny."The servant set about his task withalacrity; it is safe to say that he leftnot so much as a match in the pocketof either. While he was about it,Hole, with his eyes steadily fixed uponthe unwavering muzzles of O'Rourke'srevolvers, managed to master his emotion enough to ask coherently:"What are you going to do withus?""Ye'll see in good time," returnedO'Rourke grimly. "Have ye found it,Danny?"Danny backed away from Hole,whom he had searched after Dennison. "Yiss, sor," he returned. "Atleast, I think so. Is this ut?""I can't look at this moment, Danny.Is It a leather bag with somethinghard inside, the size of a hen's egg, ora bit larger?""The very same, yer honor.""Very well," O'Rourke suppressedthe tremble of relief in his voice."Put it in your pocket, Danny thevery bottom of your pocket. Did yefind a gun on either of them?""One on each, sor.""Loaded?""Yiss, sor.""Then cover them, Danny."For himself O'Rourke put down hispistols and calmly stripped off hiscoat, rolling up his sleeves."Hole," he said, tersely, "don'tmove. If ye do, Danny will punctureye. Your turn comes last. Dennison, ye may step out.""What for?" demanded the Scot, advancing. "To receive payment, with interest,for that blow ye gave me this evening, me man. Put up your hands.I'm going, in your own words, Mr. Dennison, to hammer the fear of Godinto as cowardly and despicable a pairof scoundrels as I've ever encountered. And," reflectively, "I've meta good many. But most of the otherswere Men."CHAPTER XVII,Two battered and sore sailormensat back to back, their arms lashedto one another and to the central upright so that neither could move, bothhalf-submerged in the fountain of Niccovie the Greek."Ye'll find the bath quite refreshing," O'Rourke told them, preparing todepart, "as well as a novel experience. 'Twill do ye a world of good,Captain Hole, as anyone will tell yewho has ever had the misfortune toFor?" DemandedAdvancing.Scot,stand to leeward of ye. Your moneyand other belongings ye'll find on thebench here, if ever ye are Iposed,which I doubt. I call your attentionto the fact that I take nothing butme property, of which ye sought torob me. On the other hand, becauseof that attempted robbery, I hereby refuse to pay my bill for passage fromAthens to Alexandria. If ye care todispute it, me solicitors in Dublin willbe pleased to enter into litigation withye. Gentlemen!" he bowed ironically,"I bid ye good night."He was still chuckling over the outcome when, twenty minutes later, heand Danny were trudging through thesilent streets of Alexandria, a full mileaway from Danny's lodgings.'Danny," O'Rourke pursued, withjust a hint of anxiety in his tone,"would ye happen to be having a bitof lining in your pocket, now be accident, as they say?".Danny drew himself up proudly."I've erght hoondred and fifty pounds,Ay-gyptian, sor, and two-hundred avthat is yours be rights, bein' whatye lent me, yer honor, while all therist is yours for the taking.""That's fine, Danny, fine!" sighedO'Rourke. " 'Tis yourself will never regret investing it in Pool of Flame, Un'limited. I'll personally guarantee theIncome from it, Danny.""Shure, sor, don't I know?""And in the morning, early, Danny,ye and I will take boat and go out tothe Pelican for me kit-box."But In the morning, as it happened,the Pelican had discreetly left the harbor. CHAPTER XVIII.It was mid-afternoon of a sultry day.No air stirred. The Panjnab was coaling at Port Said.O'Rourke eyed the vessel with disfavor from the shore; then droppedinto a harbor dinghy, ensconced himself at the tiller-ropes, and causedhimself, with his luggage and hisman-servant, to be conveyed alongsidethe steamer.Near the gangway he was heldhack: another boat had: forestalledt.i i"Whatfor the East. O'Rourke was interestedIdly.He saw a woman, a slight, trim figure becomingly attired in white, witha veil about her head, leave the boatand mount the gangway steps with aspringy, youthful step, a cheerful andpositive air, a certain but indefinablecalm of self-possession. At the topshe paused, turned, looked down,watching the transfer of her luggageand her maid. . . . From sundryintangible indications O'Rourke assumed the second woman's figure tobe the lady's maid. And so did Danny.The one eyed the mistress, the otherher servant, both with interest. . . .The woman on deck threw back herveil. She seemed to promise uncommon beauty of the English type, fullcolored and of classic mold. . .The Irishman was much too far awayto be certain, but he fancied that hergaze wandered toward him and butthis, of course, was only imaginationthat she started slightly.At all events, she was quick to dropthe veil and turn away. Her maidjoining her, both vanished beneath thecanvas awnings. The boat that hadbrought her sheered off, and O'Rourkewas permitted to board the Panjnab.It was a glad day, the O'Rourke toldhimself, as he trod those decks; itsaw him definitely started on his wayto the East.O'Rourke roused upon his elbowand peered out of the port of hisstateroom. The steamer was plowingthrough the Bitter Lakes. He saw astring of buoys, a width of water likea jade, a vista of sand, flat, gray,patched with gray-green desert shrub,bounded only by the horizon. . . ."Damn . . ." said he listlessly.He slipped down again upon his back,panted, and wiped his brow.Danny, recognizing that he was notexpected to respond, and Ibeing ayoung man remarkably acute to diagnose his master's moods, prudently re-. f rained from comment. He sat hunched up on a cabin stool, hi intenselyred, bullet-shaped head bnt low overa bit of chamois skin, which he wassewing into a rough, sturdy bag.As the sun dipped beneath the rimof the horizon, a pleasant shadow invaded the stateroom, until that moment blood-red with its level rays.And Danny straightened up, droppingthimble and thread, announcing thecompletion of his needlework by abrief, contented: "There!"O'Rourke glanced at the articledangling from his valet's fingers, andslammed the book against the bulkhead at the foot of his berth."Finished, is it?" he exclaimed."Faith, 'tis about time, ye lazy good-for-naught!"Danny smiled serenely. "And a goodjob, too, sor," said he proudly."M'anin' no onrespect to yer honor,"he added hastily.O'Rourke took the subject of discussion in his fingers and examined -itsearchingly." 'Twill do," he announced. " 'Twillserve its purpose, if no more. Layout me evening clothes now." Hestood up, stopping to stare throughtne port. "Good enough," he commented on what he discovered without; " 'tis passing Suez we are thisblessed minute. Praises be, wecaught a boat that doesn't stop here."Danny scratched an ankle thoughtfully. "Yiss, yer honor," he assented,dubious. "But, for all that, phwat'sto hinder annywan from boordin' usbe boat, if they sh'u'd want to?"O'Rourke turned and eyed the mankeenly. " 'Tis a great head ye haveon your shoulders, Danny," he said."Sometimes ye betray almost canineintilligence. I'm be way of havinghopes of ye. Now get ye on deck andwatch to see who does come aboard,if anyone, and report to me.""Yiss, yer honor.".O'Rourke bolted the door after Danny and assured himself that the keyhole was properly wadded, that nocrack existed through which his movements might be observed from thegangway. Shrugging his broad shoulders he returned to the seat vacatedby his valet and thrust a hand beneath the coat of his pajamas, withdrawing it a moment later, fingerstightly wrapped about a rather bulkyobject.And the Pool of Flame lay glittering and stabbing his eyes with shaftsof blood-red light.Into its depths of pellucid fireO'Rourke gazed long and earnestly, inthe most profound meditation.But at length, slipping the ruby intothe new receptacle and drawing thelanyard tight about its puckeredthroat, he stood up and threw the loopover his head, permitting the bag withits precious contents to fall beneaththe folds of his jacket; and, shakingoff the sober mood inspired in him bythe study of the stone, rang for asteward, to whom, when he responded,he entrusted a summons for Danny"if so be it we're clear of Suez."In the course of five minutes or soDanny himself tapped on the door andpresented to his master a beamingface."Diwle a sowl!" he announced triumphantly. "Sure, 'tis ourselves havegiven thim the slip entirely!"He fished a brand new kit-box frombeneath the berth and, opening it, beban to lay out O'Rourke's clothing.His master indulged in a sigh of relief.

"It is mad ye are, ortiave ye no judgment at all, ye scut,that ye speak to me in that tone?"Solicitously Danny rubbed thechastened portion of his person, grumbling but unrepentant.O'Rourke grinned tolerantly, retaining his hold upon the servitor's ear.'Her name?""Ow, yer honor, leggo! . .Missus Prynne, sor!"The wanderer gave the ear anothertweak, by way of enforcing the lesson.

The peal of the trumpet announcingdinner interrupted his contemplatedlecture on the ethics of investigationand the perils of flirtation as betweenmaid and man servant.CHAPTER XIX.The wanderer had come upon Mrs.Prynne but once since he had boarded the Panjnab. That morning, himself early astir because of his vaguemisgivings, he had discovered her onthe hurricane deck of the liner; an inconspicuous, slight figure in the shadow of a life-boat, leaning upon therail and gazing with (he fancied)'troubled eyes, out and across thewaste below Ismalla.Though sheTriust have been con-ncious or nearing root&teps, she hainot stirred, and he had passed on,gaining but a fugitive glimpse of aprofile sweetly serious; nor had sheappeared either at breakfast or luncheon. A circumstance which led him.to surmise that she did not court observation: an Idiosyncrasy whichseemed passing strange in a womanso fair.He told himself that she wore anair of watchfulness, of vague expectancy, as though she, like himself,feared some untoward mishap; thatshe had the manner of one definitelyapprehensive, constantly on guardagainst some unforeseen peril.Now, he asked himself, what couldit be? What threatened her? Adwhy?He dimly promised himself thepleasure of her acquaintance, relyingin the rapid intimacy that springs upbetween strangers on a long voyage,with a still more indefinite intentionof putting himself at her service Inany cause that she might be pleasedto name, provisionally: she must notinterfere with his plans for reachingRangoon "in ninety days."That night he was hoping to findthe lady at dinner; but though theship's company was small, he failedto see her in the saloon, at either thecaptain's, the chief officer's or thedoctor's table; nor, so far as he coulddetermine, was she taking the air ondeck. Was it possible, then, that hehad been right, that she had a reasonequally as compelling as his own forsecluding herself? Or, was it simply(and infinitely more probably) thatMrs. Prynne was indisposed, an enervated victim of excessive heat?The latter conjecture proved apparently the right one, Mrs. Prynnefailing to appear during the two following days, while the Panjnab wasrocking down the Red Sea channel;and O'Rourke grew interested enough(he had little else to occupy his mind,for a duller voyage he had neverknown) to give Danny permission topursue his inquiries: with an injunction, however, prohibiting too lavishan expenditure of the boy's wealth ofaffection. Whereupon Danny returned with the information that the mistress of Cecile, the maid, was suffering from heat exhaustion.This was entirely reasonable.O'Rourke accepted the demolition ofhis airy castles of Romance, laughedat himself, in part was successful inputting the woman out of mind;doubtless, in time, he would have doneso altogether, had not the lady chosento take the air the night that thePanjnab negotiated the Straits ofBab-el-Mandeb. For on that samenight, O'Rourke, himself wakeful, wasminded to sit up and watch the lightsof Perim Island heave into view.O'Rourke, in a deck-chair on thestarboard side, well cloaked in theshadow of the deck above, watched the other passengers, one by one,quiet their chatter, yawn, stretch andslip below to stuffy staterooms.He suffered a dreamy eye to rovewhere it would, greedy of the night'ssuperb illusion.Four bells two o'clock chimedupon his consciousness like a physicalshock. He verified the hour by hiswatch and, reluctantly enough, agreedthat it was time he got himself tcbed. He half rose from his chair, thensank back with an inaudible catch ofhis breath. Without warning the apparition of a white-clad woman hadinvaded the promenade deck. For aninstant he hardly credited his eyes,then, with a nod of recognition, heidentified Mrs. Prynne.Unquestionably unconscious of hispresence in the shadow, she fell topacing to and fro. Now and again,she stopped, and with chin cradled inher small hands, elbows on the rail,watched the approaching cliffs ofArabia; then, with perhaps a sigh, returned to her untimely constitutional.Partly because he had no wish tostartle her, partly because he wasglad to watch unobserved (he had arare eye for beauty, the O'Rourke),the wanderer sat on without moving,stirred only by active curiosity. Thestrangeness of her appearance upondeck at such an hour fascinated hisimagination no less than her personheld his eye. He gave himself overto vain and profitless speculation. .. . Why, he wondered, should shekeep to her cabin the greater part ofthe evening, only to take the air whennone might be supposed to observeher?Why, if not to escape such observation? Then, he told himself, he mustbe right in his supposition that shehad something to fear, someone toavoid. What or whom? What was itall, what the mystery that, as hewatched her,-seemed to grow, to clingabout her like some formless, impalpable garment?Events conspired to weave the manint the warp and woof of her affairs;more quickly than he could grasp thereason for his sudden action, he foundhimself a-foot and dashing aft at topspeed. But an instant gone MrsPrynne had passed hfcn, unmolestedand wrapped in her splendid isolation; and then from the after part ofthe deck he had heard a slight andguarded cry of distress, and a smallscuffling sound.In two breaths he was by her sideand found her struggling desperatelyin the arms of a lascar a deck-handon the steamer.At first the strangeness of the business so amazed O'Rourke that hepaused and held his hand, brieflyrooted in action. For although it wasapparent that she had been caught offher guard, wholly unprepared againstassault, and while she struggled.fiercely to break the lascar's hold, the woman still uttered no cry. A singlescream would have brought her aid;yet she held her tonsua.Tne two, the woman's slight,, whitir;figure and the lascar's gaunt and slmewy one, strained and fought, swayingsilently in the shadows, tensely, "witk.the effect of a fragment of some disordered nightmare. But then, u thlascar seemed about to overpower Mvictim, O'Rourke, electrified, gpramxupon the man's back. With one stroaffarm deftly he embraced the fellow, anelbow beneath his chin, forcing lifthead up and back. With the otkechand O'Rourke none too gently toraway an arm encircling the woman.Then wrenching the two apart, hmsent a knee crashing into the small oCthe lascar's back, all but breaking himin two, and so flung him aprawlisg;Into the scuppers.Without a word the man slid upohis" shoulders a full half-dozen- feetwhile O'Rourke had a momentary;glimpse of his face in the moonligafcdark-skinned and sinister of expression with Its white, glaring eyeballsThen, In one bound, he was on himfeet again and springing lithely back tpthe attack: and as he came on a jagged gleam of moonlight ran like lightning down the sinuous and formidableilength of a kris, most deadly ofknives.O'Rourke fell back a pace or two.His own hands were empty; he hadnothing but naked fists and high courage to pit against the lascar and hiskris. Keenly alert, he threw himselfinto a pose of defence.But O'Rourke had forgotten, thewoman; it was enough that he hadmade possible her escape, and he hadno thought other than she had fled. It;,was, therefore, with as much surpriseas relief that he caught the glimmecof her white figure as she thrust herself before him and saw the lascarbring up in the middle of a leap, hisnose not an inch from the muzzle ofan army Webley of respect-compellingcaliber.Simultaneously, he heard her voice,clear and incisive if low of tone:t"Drop that knife!"The kris shivered upon the deck."Faith!" murmured the Irishman,"and what manner of woman is this,now?"The lascar stood as rigid as thougKcarven out of stone, long, gaunt legsshining softly brown beneath his coel,Found Her Struggling Desperately Inthe Arms of a Lascar.dazzling white cummerbund, the upper half of his body lost in the shadow;of the deck, a gray blur standing forhis turban.O'Rourke stepped forward, with Xquick movement kicking the kris overboard, and would have seized the fellow but that the woman intervened.She said decisively: "If you pleaseno."Bewildered, O'Rourke hesitated. "Tbeg your pardon " he said in confusion. She did not reply directly; her attention was all for the lascar, whomher revolver still covered. To him,"Go!" she said sharply, with a significant motion of the weapon.f Continued in our NextPoet's Longest and Shortest Play."Hamlet" is the longest of Shakespeare's plays and the "Comedy otErrors" the shortesthas helped countlessthousands of thin, weak,delicate children madethem strong, plumpand robust.It creates an appetite,aids digestion, fills theveins with rich redblood.After illness or lossof weight from anycause, it brings strengthand flesh quicker thananything else.ALL DRUGGISTS11-16THE BOURBON NEWS, PARIS, KENTUCKY, FEB. 2, 1912IS A LEIThe Manufacturers Who Consigned Us TheirOverproduction of thisJSeason's FootwearDemand Prompt ActionWc have, therefore, re-marked these goods at pricesthat must hasten their removal.
