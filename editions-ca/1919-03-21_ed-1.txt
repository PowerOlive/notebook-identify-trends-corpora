W. Clay andhis father, Mr. Thos. Henry Clay,were driving on the Winchester pike,Tuesday afternoon, caused the deathof Sam Schooler, colored, aged sixty.The accident occurred near thehome of Mr. Charlton Clay, on theWinchester pike, a short distancefrom Paris, about two o'clock in theafternoon. Both. Schooler and theClay machine"were heading in thesame direction. Mr. George W. Clay,who was driving, saw the man walking in the middle of the pike, a shortdistance ahead of him, and soundedhis horn repeatedly, giving amplewarning of its approach. Schoolerevinently became confused uponhearing the machine so close to him,as he turned in the wrong direction,and was struck by the car. Mr. Claymade every effort to stop the machine, running it in the ditch at theside of the road, but too late to avoidthe accident. The machine struck astone fence at the side of the pike,and was slightly damaged. Whenstruck Schooler was knocked downand pinioned under the car, his skullbeing crushed, causing instant death.Mrs. Wm. Woorford came along inher car a few minutes after the accident and took Mr. Clay and his father back to Paris, where the accident was reported to the authorities.They then returned to the scene ina machine secured from a local garage. The body of Schooler was released from under the Clay machineand was, sent to the undertaking establishment of Ed. Martyn, on Highstreet, where it was prepared forburial. In the pockets of the deadman were found two receipts for supplies purchased at the grocery of P.J. McElhone & Co., in Lexington; apaper containing the address of Mrs.Bettie Schooler, 553 Clinton street,Cincinnati; several interurban cartickets from Lexington to Paris, andabout fifty cents in coin. He hadbeen evidently going to work as afarm laborer, as he was dressed inoveralls and carried a package'oyerhis shoulder, which proved to contain a luncheon.Mr. Clay gave a clear and concisereport of the accident, which tendedto show that he was not. to blame forthe unfortunate occurrence. He saidthat he did all he could to stoptbe,car in time, but that the man jumpeddirectly in front of it, and that hecould not avoid hitting him.Coroner Davis held an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the accident, at the courthouse yesterday afternoon at twoo'clock. The testimony of Mr. Geo.W. Clay and Mr. Thos. Henry Clay,the only eye-witnesses, was taken.The jury, composed of H. M. Collins, foreman, Newton Mitchell, A.S. Thompson, G. W. Itedmon, I. I.Price and E. B. Myers, returned averdict, absolving Mr. Clay from allblame for the unavoidable accident.BED GROSS UBGES MEMBEBSSTJBSCBIPTION TO MAGAZINEOnce more Bourbon County Chapter members are called upon to showtheir loyalty.

Short term notes, maturingin not more than five years, will beissued instead of longer-term bonds.While the amount of notes to beoffered was not disclosed officially itis understood that $5,000,000,000 isthe tentative figure, ;with .the Treasury reserving the right to "accept allover-subscriptions. The interest rateon the notes and the amounts to beexempted from taxation will not bedetermined until a week or two before the Campaign opens.After studying financial conditions 'in all parts of the country,"said Secretary Glass, "I have decided the interest of the United Stateswill best be served at this time bythe issuance of short term notesrather than of long term bonds,'which would have to bear the limitedrate of interest of 44 per cent."The Victory Liberty Loan will,therefore, take the form of notes ofthe United States, maturing in notover five years from the date of issue.These notes will be, as were the Liberty Loan bonds, $ie direct promiseto pay of the United States, will beissued in registered and couponform, and the coupon notes will bein final form and will have attachedthe interest coupons covering the entire life of the notes. I am hopefulthat the notes in final engraved formwill be ready for delivery by theopening of the campaign, April 21."I am led to adopt the plan of issuing short term, notes rather thanlong term bonds largely because ofthe fact that I believe a short termissue will maintain a price atabout par after the campaign isended for more readily than would alonger term issue."CARLISLE HAS ANOTHER ESCAPEEROM SERIOUS BLAZE.SOCIAL AND PERSONAL.

Mr. Dennis V.Shapp, the Sunday School Field Secretary of Kentucky in presenting theCehtenary and the Sunday School,in la rebent speech said in part:"Every Methodist must give hisfullest , co-operation in making theCentenary a success. Co-operation inthis case does not simply mean thatyou are not to oppose the Centenary,but more than that, it implies thatyou'are to contribute your time, yourenergy, your .money and if need beyour, life service in making this greatmovement successful in every particular. "There is every reason to believethat the Sunday Schools are going tobe;100 per cent, loyal to the Ceritenrary. They are asked to raise a certain amount in money, one milliondollars a year as a minimum contribution but this is not the primary taskassigned to the Sunday Schools."The main object of the SundaySchool is to educate. It is said thatat least 95 per cent, of those who under present conditions are receivedinto the church pass through the Sunday. School. It is -therefore incumbent upon our Sunday School to trainand develop a missionary churchcomposed of members who are willingand ready to give systematically tomissions. There is absolutely no gainin, raising this $35,000,000,. unlesswe educate the rising generation tosupplement and sustain the great program of "work which we propose tolaunch as a result of the Centenarycelebration."While the great war was in progress we quoted Light Horse HarryLee, who said: 'A Government is themurderer of its citizens which sendsthem to the field uninformed and untaught, where they are to meet menof the same age and strength, mechanized "by education and disciplinefor battle.' And I would declare toyou that the church is underminingits own foundation when it allows itschildren to go out into the "field oflife uninformed and untutored, wherethey are to combat sin and vice, without sufficient implements derivedfrom Christian education and discipline to over come these impediments."The Sunday School therefore, inaddition to raising a minimum sum ofover a $1,000,000 annually for missions, proposes to awaken a jiissionary spirit, by incorporating missionary lessons and programs in theSchool Standard, the Sunday SchoolMagazine, the Adult Student, andothers periodicals.

We can not and we will notfail to discharge our duty at thistime, the most crucial period of theworld's history. We should at onceaccept this challenge which has beenthrown to us or' else we will be forcedto surrender our self-respect.The amount each Sunday School isallotted is a maximum sum. It is avery small amount as compared withwhat the Sunday Schoolsare able togive. Each school is asked for anamount equal to a total of five centsa month per pupil enrolled.If the Centenary Commission hadgiven the Sunday Schools of Kentucky a definite amount of moneyo. be raised as a.Conf erence organization, regardless of how it should beraised, our task would have been acomparatively easy one. But the Commission has very wisely given us anallotment making it necessary forevery schobl;to do its part before ourgoal is ehiev,ed;. This plan is valuable because of its educational valueinasmuch', as it provides, missionaryeducation and systematic giving. Ifyour school fails to accept its partthe entire Kentucky Conference hasfailed to that extent.There is absolutely no doubt in mymind but what all schools will ultimately adopt their allotment. But thething we arfe- urging" is that eachschool immediately assume and announce its obligation. The SundaySchools must complete their work before The Eight Day Drive for thechurch at large begins.There are over. 00 Sunday Schoolsin "the 'Kentucky Conference. It istherefore a; physical impossibility forme to' get in personal touch with allthese schoolSf, J. therefore appeal toyou 'for your whole-hearted co-operation,in makingthe Kentucky Conference -Sunday' Schools' 100 :per cent,loyal po the Centenary.

Any deep stirring up ofthe garden soil is sure to cut thetiny fibrous roots which feed closeto the surface of the garden. Thehoe should be so sharp and brightthat it can be run barely beneath thesurface of the soil, thus cutting theweeds off and stirring only enoughof the soil to hold the moisture forthe growing plants.Cascarets WorkWhile You SleepNo headache, biliousness, upset stomach or constipation tomorrowSpend 10 cents feel grand I Tonight take Cascarets to liven yourliver and clean your bowels.

The question tnen arose as towhether it was dutiable, particularlysince airplanes are not mentioned inany tariff acts.Customs . officials finally decidedthat if it remains permanently in theUnited States it should be taxed as a"manufactured article" at the rate of20 per cent, and if it .flies out of the.country again within, six months, itwill be regarded as "on a tour," andwill no be taxed. In view of theprospects that international air touring may, soon be common, the rulingwas regarded as important.1"P0BGOT WHAT HE NEEDED.From the Republican, Mt.
