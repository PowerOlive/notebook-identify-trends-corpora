Little
Pimples Turn
to Cancer
Cancer often results from an im
Turity in the blood inherited from
generations back Few
people are en
tirely free from some taint in the blood
nd it is impossible to tell when it will
break out in the form of dreaded Can
cer What haa appeared to be a mere
pimple or scratch haa developed into
ithe most malignant Cancer

KnrlnR Sliver at the Mint
Perhaps the most interesting scheme
for the recovery of waste silver at the
local mint Is that applied to the uten
sils of the melting gang The big irou
stirring rods the dippers the strainers
and the ladles that coiae in contact
with the molten metal are laid aside at
intervals and sent down stairs They
are covered with what looks like brown
rust but is really oxidixed silver
Suppose to digress a moment one
desired to get a coat of paint off the
outside of a house In such event the
plan of scraping away the house and
leaving the shell of paint standing
would be regarded as somewhat eccen
tric yet that is substantially the meth
od adopted at the mint The imple
ments are placed in baths of sulphuric
acid which attacks the iron or steel
but leaves the silver untouched Little
by little a strainer for instance will
entirely disappear
That is to say the original strainer
disappears and leaves in its place a hol
low silver counterpart delicate as an
eggshell They are very curious these
fragile casts Their surface is a sort of
natural filigree honeycombed with in
numerable fantastic perforations The
reproduction of a bolt or screw is some
times as perfect as an electrotype but
they are hurried remorselessly back to
the crucible and thus pursue their cy
cle until at last they find their Karma
in a minted coin New Orleans Times
Democrat
Will of Some Women
Some women dc rive a great deal of
enjoyment out of making their wills
remarked a lawyer the other day
They change them as often as they
change their gowns It is only a few
days ago that I came down to my office
to find one of my fair clients anx
iously awaiting me She was in a great
state of nervousness
Oh Mr Iilank she exclaimed Ive
come to change my will
What Again r I asked
Yes she sid I discovered last
night that Mrs whom I had in
tended to have my diamond tiara to
has been saying spiteful things about
my poor dead husband said he made
his money out of green grocery and an
off beer license odious creature that
she is I could never rest in my grave
if 1 thought siie would benefit a farth
ings worth from my death
Cross her off the will please Mr
Blank and substitute the name of let
me see now whom can I leave the dia
mond tiara to Well Ill think it over
tonight and come and see you iu the
morning
And so on continued the man of
law That good lady changed her will
six times In as many months and the
names in it would have tilled a small
directory while the rest of it suggest
ed an auctioneers catalogue London

Oriental Judgment on Mixed Babies
The Greek ecclesiastical authopities
at Aleppo have been called upon to de
cide a case which strongly recalls Solo
mons famous judgment By a strange
coincidence a woman and her daughter
both gave birth to a female child at the
same time But the babies got mixed
and as one of them was ugly and the
other pretty and healthy both mothers
claimed the latter The elder woman
maintained that as all her other chil
dren were handsome the ugly child
could not be hers while her daughter
claimed that being young handsome
and strong she could not be the moth
er of a weak and ugly babe
The religious chief of the town set
tled the Affair in a summary way He
adjudged the beautiful child to the
daughter on the ground that it being
her first the occasion was not to be
made one of humiliation and disap
pointment wbile the elder mother
could afford to forego her claim since
she had already Lad several handsome
children Constantinople Malumat
A Wonder Flower
The Canadian Manufacturer reports
the remarkable phenomenon of the dis
covery of a flower incased in a hole in
an old iron casting the flower being in
a perfect state of preservation A work
man engaged in breaking up old iron
at a foundry in Ontario came across an
old wheel that had done service on a
stationary engine for many years On
breaking it he discovered in a crevice a
flower Itlossom in perfect condition its
color being as fresh as the day it found
its way into its mysterious hiding
place It had evidently fallen Into the
casting when it was being poured and
in some manner escaped injury from
the molten metal As the cavity was
perfectly airtight it naturally retained
its fslijies until exposed view
Her Lncld K iNtxr
Dont you wish he asked looking
soulfully into her eyes xhat the tun
nel on this line was ten times as long
No she answered
It struck him like a dash of cold wa
ter in the face lustaatly it dawned
apon him that she no longer loved him
Tbey always light the car lampa
when coming to the long tunnels sae
added and they dout for the shart
ones Chicago Past
An Ineonsclon Press Asent
It was a critie who uprose on the first
night of the late Charles Readea
drama Its Never Toe Late to Mend
at the lrincess theater London In
1805 and vehemently protested against
the flogging business in the jail scene
as being inhuman and untrue to life
However it was true to life and the
discussion that ensued tended to crowd
the theater for many months
