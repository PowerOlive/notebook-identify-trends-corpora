young worms arefed on finely chopped leaves but asthey grow larger the leaves need onlybe broken in two The people have tofeed and watch the worms night andday or they wander in search of foodand are lost and in the silence of thenight the sound of the worms feedingis like a gently falling rainThe worms fast three or four timesduring this period and about 24 hoursis the length of each fast A curiousfeature about their fast is their posture they assume the attitude of acobra snake about to strike and remainrigidly fixed in that position for the en-tire period When they are ready tospin small branches are placed on theshelves arid as the cocoons are formedupon them the dead twigs seem to beargolda fruit When the worms getthrough that part of the business theneighbors are called in

recently at a meeting onthe subject of good roads at NewburgX Y Hon G E Harrison of theUnited States department of agriculture bureau of roads said he had spent50 years on a farm in Kew Jersey andPennsylvania and ten years in his present position he was therefore hethought qualified to speak The roadquestion had loomed up because it hadbeen found that it takes a third of theirvalue to move the crops the cost ofprimary transportation being verylarge On an average it costs 25 centsper ton to pay for primary transportation In 1S95 it cost 940000000 to moveproduce to pay for its primary transportation Farms could not be put onlines of railroads and railroads will notgo into farms any more than they noware Investigation had shown that itcostsTcentspermileto move farm products over country roads Farmers donot think of this or if they do theyfigure that it does not really cost themanything as they do the hauling withtheir own teams The governmentfound that the cost of transportationfrom the farm could be reduced twothirds 03 having good roads and hadissued 24 bulletins giving informationon the subject New Jersey was the firstto adopt the state aid law and it iseconomical and produces the best results That law was started by farmersThe speaker gave the wheelmen creditbut remarked dryly that they dontancve the national government Thewheelmen knew nothing about thestate aid act and it was passed withouttheir help and hardly their knowledgeUeing asked about wide tires on goodroads tne speaker replied that the bestrolling any road could be given wasby
