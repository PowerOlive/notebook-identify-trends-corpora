filed suit in the Fayete Circuit Court
Saturday against Miss Crosthwait ask
ing that eight pieces of property which

be divided among the various heirs
according to their respective shares.
The property which the plaintiff
seek to sell belonged to Eleanor J.

estate, with remainder J:o the children

cept Miss Crosthwait, the defendant.
Not Half as Hard.
It Is not half as hard to do what
one wants to do most of all, as it is
to do that which some one else wants
one to do above all else.
There is more Catarrh in this sec
tion of the country than all other dis
eases put together, and until the last
lew years was supposed to be incura
ble. For a great many years doctors
pronounced it to be a local disease
and prescribed local remedies, and by
constantly failing to cure with local
treatment, pronounced it incurable.
Science has proven catarrh to be a
constitutional disease and therefore
requires constitutipnal treatment.
Hall's Catarrh Cure, manufactured
by F, J. Cheney & Co., Toledo, O.,
is the only constitutional cure on the
market. It is taken internally in
doses from 10 drops to a teaspoonful.
It acts directly on the blood and mu
cous surfaces of the system. They
offer one hundred dollars for any case
it fails to cure. Send for circulars and
testimonials.

STEEL MONSTERS
CfSASUEAD ON
THRILLING SPECTACLE PROM-
ISED FOR VISITORS AT KEN-
TUCKY STATE FAIR.
COLD SHIVERS A PLENTY
Two Monster Steel Steam Engines
Dash to Certain Destruction in
Full View of Spectators.
Seldom is it that any community is
afforded an opportunity to witness
such an ambitious and thrilling per
formance as is promised the crowds
in attendance at the Kentucky State
Fair on Saturday, September 16. when
the spectacle is provided of two mon
ster steam engines, started under a
full head of steam and permitted to
crash head-on in full view of the spec
tators A. sight such as this is suffi
cient to cause the most stolid of per
sons, he with the nerves of steel, to
involuntarily shudder and flinch as
the collision occurs.
The hiss of escaping steam, the
bursting of the great boilers, J;he rend
ing of the formidable iron pars, the
tearing and crashing and grinding of
twisted masses of steel are even in
spiring in the terrible force which ac
companies them.
The sight of the two mountains of
machinery rushing headlong into each
other's embrace is sufficient to freeze
the blood in one's veins, and send
shivers of fear rushing up and down
the spinal columns, despite the knowl
edge that there is no personal danger.
The sensations resulting arc intense
but it is such as these tn?.t the hu
man family is seeking to day, and no
more spectacular offering coi'ld be
provided to satisfy the ever present
desire for something out of the ordi
nary. The engines arc placed on opposite
ends of a track built especially for
the purpos3. The fires are started,
the steam is produced, the throttles
are thrown open, and the two mon
sters are started to physical destruc
tion by engineers who leap to safety
before the impact comes.
PREMIUM LIST FOR
CREAMERY BUTTER
NEW DEPARTURE FOR KEN
TUCKY STATE FAIR CERTAIN
TO MAKE HIT.
i Nursery cultivation is proving not
only one of the most fascinating of
, studies in the rural sections of Ken
, tucky but it also is developing into
one of commercial importance which
is taking high rank. To those inter
ested it will be good news to learn
that the Kentucky State Fair manage
ment has decided to offer tempting
premiums for nursery displays in con
nection with plant and flower depart
ment. This is another of the entirely new
departures which have been decided
upon for the big Kentucky State Fair
of 1911. It is along the lines of prog
ress and improvement which make
certain that the Kentucky State Fair
not only will maintain its lead in the
south but that it will take its rightful
place among the great state exhibi
tions of Indiana, Iowa, Illinois, Minne
sota and others to the north.
PERMANENT BUILDING IN
INTEREST OF HEALTH
The campaign for health being
waged the country over is to be aided
materially by the establishment on the
grounds of the Kentucky State Fair, at
Louisville, of a permanent health
building, the cost of which will be paid
by the Jefferson county fiscal court.
Dr. W. Ed Grant, city health officer of
Louisville, and Dr. "W. B. Smock, Jef-
ferson county health officer, took up
this matter with the fiscal court and
secured the appropriation. The federal
government has agreed to send a corps
of instructors to Kentucky each year
during the fair to deliver lectures
dealing with the problem of health.
PRIZE WINNERS' PARADE
ONE OF BIG FEATURES
Livestock, Bedecked in Ribbons,
March Around Pavilion to De
light of Audience.
What has always been one of the
J most interesting of all the features in
connection with the Kentucky State
Fair was the grand parade of prize
winning livestock around the ring in
the pavilion building. This feature is
to be given more attention this year
than ever. It will be started at two
o'clock on the afternoon of Friday,
September 15.
This parade is an imposing one, not
alone from the amount of money rep
resented by the premiums, but-because
of the great amount represented in
the value of all the winners combined.
The slow moving, ribbon bedecked cat
tle seem aware of their oommercial
importance as they trudge around the
ring, while the sleek, carefully groom
ed horses of high degree prance along
as if more than conscious of their
grace and breeding.
Collie dogs, running and barking at
the crack of the whips of their mas
ters, ponies and costly sheep and hogs,
all combine to make a show equal to
any presented during the week. It is
a source of pride to those who own
the prize winners and a stimulus to
others to enter their stock in future
Kentucky's First Electrocution.
The first Texecution under the new
law providing electrocution in place of
hnging took plaace at the state peni
tentiary at Eddyville Saturday and it
almost caused the death of two per
sons instead of one. Prison physician
R. H. Moss stepped forward to feel
the pulse of the negro who formed the
first subject before the current had
ben cut off. A warning yell from the
penitentiary electrician did not stop
the doctor, who misunderstood the
caution and still advanced. A second
"warning had to be given, before he
understood. The negro, James Booker,
murdered a policeman at Lebanon.
