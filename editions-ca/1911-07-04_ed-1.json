Visions of the Penant in Sight.
With the closing day of the first sec
tion of the Blue Grass, League in sight
Paris still has a good chance to land
the rag. By winning from Winches
ter yesterday the lead was increased
to 29 points over the Hustlers. As it
'"jstands Paris has four games to play
and Winchester 3. Should Winchester
win all of her remaining games and
Paris one out of four the per cent
would be even, but if Paris shou'd win
" two out of four and Winchester lose
one out of three Paris would lead by
a per cent of 7 points over her near
est rival. It is reasonable to believe
. Paris will win one of the remaining
...games unless Winchester has an un
usual streak of luck it is not likely
she will tie with Paris for pennant
-honors.
FRIDAY.
The Bourbonites broke even Friday
in a double header with the Pioneers,
losing the first in a lively contest by a
score of 5 to 2 and taking the second,
which went only six innings.by a score
of 11 to 3. Errois by Chapman and
Maxwell gave the visitors three runs
in the first inning, a lead, coupled with
the effectiveness of Creager, the locals
could not overcome. Creager essayed
to pitch the second game but was
v pounded off the mound in the second
inning. The score:

SATURDAY.
In a game that went the full length
of two contests Paris and Lexington
tied Saturday afternoon and at the
conclusion of the eighteenth inning the
game was called on account of dark
ness. To make the affair more com
plete, after Wilkinson and the Paris
team had left the field Yancey appoint
ed Vallandingham substitute umpire
and the Lexington player declared the
game forfeited to Lexington.
The contest was a pitchers' battle
between jgHauser and Robbins with
honors greatly to the favor of the
Paris hurler.
Paiis counted their lone tally in the
eighth. Kuhlman singled, toqk second
on a. fumble and scored when McKer
nan doubled. An oversight on the part
of Umpire Wilkerson robbed Paris of
the game in the same half when Mc
Kernan stole home and Sewell dropped
the ball. He was called out by Wil
Rerson. In the ninth Yancey put the
ball over the left field fence that tied
up the game. The score :

-SUNDAY.
Paris took revenge upon the Law
makers for the double defeat a week
previous, and Sunday afternoon took a
double bill from the Frankfbrt team.
The first game resulted in an over
whelming defeat for the visitors but
the second was of an entirely different
character.
Aside from four mlsplays on the
rjart of Paris in the first game they
fielded brilliant. In the outfield Haus
er and Goodman took some difficult
chances and robbed the visitors of sev
eral hits. While Barnett had two er
rors he played a star game and laced
out a home run in the fifth. The
Champs hit Cornell at will -but King
pitched masterly ball, and to the sixth
inning held his opponents to two hits
after which he slowed up.
Shears and Cramer opposed each
other in the second game, which was
an exceptionally fine contest. Both
pitchers were on their mettle. A hit
and two errors in the fourth gave the
visitors their only ran. In the seventh
after McKernan flied to Nicholson,
Maxwell singled to center and Barnett
to right. Maxwell scored on Mayer s
sacrifice. After two were out in the
ninth Barnett walked and Mayer fol
lowed with a double sending Barnett
over the plate with the winning run.

When Walter Mayer, the Paris back
top, advanced to the bat the. first
time Sunday afternoon, he was pre
sented with a handsome bouquet of
flowers, the gift of relatives and
friends who came from Cincinnati to
witness the games between Paris and
Frankfort. Umpire Wilkerson pre
sented the flowers to Mayer, who re
cieved them smilingly while the crowd
cheered. Danny HarrelLrelieved him
of the immense floral offerng while
the Paris wind-pad artist faced the
pitcher. Among those who came from
Cincinnati and who were interested
spectators at the game were Mayer's
father and mother, Mr. and Mrs.
Julius Mayer, his brother, Julius
Mayer, Jr., and sister. Miss Vera
Mayre, and Mr. Gus Tedesco. They
wei;e all proud of tha way Walter ac
quitted himself and especially so in
the iast game, when his sacrifice put
over the run that tied up the contest
and his timely two-hagger sent Bar
nett around with the winning run:
