His Day of Fate.
An odd story of a dream of ill-omen
comes from Sunderland, Durham, Eng
land. A young shipyard laborer
dreamed that he would be killed, and'
therefore he did not go to work In
the morning. In the afternoon he
went to bathe in the River Wear, and
getting into deep water was drowned
before help could reach him. The
efforts of his companions to save him
were unavailing, through the swift

When the crops becomes very largr,
and the fowls show signs of the dis
ease, keep them away from all focd,
allowing only water, for forty-eicht

eat of finely chopped onions, allwoing
them nothing else but water for sever
al hours more, or until they show they
are relieved. I have never known the

No Vipers In New World.
Africa is the home or the typical
vipers. No species -of the true viper
inhabits the new world, though sev
eral kinds of snakes are commonly
so called. The viperine snakes of this
hemisphere belong to a sub-family of
the vipers, known technically as the
Crotaiinae. "Under this head come the
rattlesnake, copperhead, water moc
casin, bushmaster and the fer-de-lance.
Irreverent' Youth.
On a recent publication day of a
newspaper printed out west, a boy,
some ten or twelve years of age, came
into the office, and, with a peculiar
grin on his face, inquired, "if that pa
per," pointing to the copy, "has an
account of the man that has been mur
dered in Dele van?" He was an
swered in the affirmative, when de
positing five cents upon the table, he
remarked, with an air of self-importance,
"Well that's my dad, and 1
want to read about him." Boston

Snail Millions of Years Old.
A petrified prehistoric snail embed
ded in the heart of a large piece of
blue lias stone, was discovered a few
days ago- by quarrymen' working at
Cheddar Cliffs, Wales, upon some
large boulders of stone which were
displaced in the landslide which oc
curred some years ago. The discov
ery is distinctly interesting to the
geologists on account of the great age
of the find, as, situated upon a very
low strata, it must be millions of
years since the snail lived.
Remains of Old-Time Fortress.
Archaeological, researches made at
a spot some 20 miles from Kars, Rus
sia, have brought to nt a complete
ly intact stone fortress of prehistoric
date. The masonry of the primitively
designed forts and bastions is some
what roughly, v but extremely well
laid. Among the 'many and various
objects found are quite a number of
well-preserved figures of heathen
gods, mostly in animal forms and in
a kind of hard-baked potter's clay.
Same Old Human Nature.
From the fresco paintings of wom
en in Cretan palaces of the period
about 2000 B. C. it is learned that the
women of that time pinched in their
waists, had flounced or accordion plait
ed skirts, wore an elaborate coiffure
on their heads, shoes with high heels
and hats which might have come from
a Parisian hat shop, while one woman
might be described as wearing a jupe
culotte.
Uses of Nitrate of Soda.
Sodium Nitrate is the only nitrogen
salt that can be used in solution, as
all the other soluble salts of nitrogen
become fixed as soon as they come in
contact with the soil. However, they
become available in a short time. The
released sodium may correct soil acid
ity or may liberate calcium, potassium
or magnesium from the soil.

A Hare's Daily Sea Bath.
A hare which had made a dally
practice of swimming in the sea at
Cley,' to the delight of visitors, has
been captured by some local fishermen
in a boat. They chased the animal
seaward for 300 yards before they
came up with it. The hare was then
exhausted and was easily captured.
