DOVE IAW EXPIRES ON SEPT. 1.
Dove hunters who have been un
der the impression that the open
season on dove shooting began on
August 15, will find they have been
mistaken if they should take the
field. The law does not expire until
September I, at which time they are
free to get out with their guns in
pursuit of the elusive and gentle
dove, the "messenger of peace."
In this connection State Game
Warden A. W. Bullock, of Paris, de
sires to warn all hunters that they
must have the necessary hunting
license, and must have it with them
when they take the field. Violators
of the game laws will be vigorously
prosecuted, with the help and co
operation of the Bourbon County
Game and Fish Club, and, all
other good sportsmen.
Game Warden Bullock, who also
works under the direction of the
Federal Game Commission, has re
ceived the following letter from, the
State Game and Fish Commission:
and Fish Commission:
"We call your attention to the
fact that a violation of the dove
'shooting law is also a violation of
the Federal statutes.
"In the event that you fail to
convict any violators of the dove
law after having been brought to a
trial, please report to this office and
we will take the matter up with the
Federal authorities.
"Please be especially vigilant in
your endeavor to see that there is no
violation in your district prior to the
opening of the season."
