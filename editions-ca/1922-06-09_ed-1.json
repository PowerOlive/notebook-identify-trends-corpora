BOUKBON FABM CONDITIONS
" Between the stripping of blue
feT grass seed crop, setting out tobacco
'and gathering a rich crop of ripe
strawberries, the farmers of Bour
bon county finished one of the bus
iest!", weeks in their history. Very
few of them have been to Paris ex
cept on short errands during the en
tire week. Every available laborer
in the county has been given em--ployment,
and in some instances
labor has been so scarce that men
have been brought here from sur
rounding counties when the supply
-exceeded the demand.
Showers of the past week have
"been of great benefit in giving the
-tobacco plants a good start, but
"liave delayed slightly the work of
stripping blue grass seed, but have
delayed slightly the work of strip
stripping grass seed. Under the be
nign influences of sunshine and rain
-all growing crops have taken on new
"life and are growing "an inch an
hour."
A spirit of optimism continues to
'prevail among the farmers and
merchants alike, and all are firmly
convinced that the present year
-will bring forth better times than
we have had in this county for sev
eral years. v

tributing the registration books now
being printed in Louisville. The
books must be distributed to the

WILL
TEST ANTI-TRADIN&
STAMP LAW
The first step in a fight against
the anti-trading stamp law came
when J. Bacon & Sons, Louisville
dealers, filed suit in Circuit Court
to enjoin Commonwealth's Attor
ney J. Matt Chilton from prosecut
ing any action that, ma'y be insti
tuted against the plaintiff for the
giving of trading stamps.
Hearing on the motion for a tem
porary restraining- order against the
defendant officials will be heard Fri
day morning by Chancellor Lafon
Allen. Lawton and Chilton were
served with notice of the suit
Other large concerns which give
trading stamps are expected to file
similar suits.
The possibility of a meeting be
tween Morvich, Benjamin .Block's
unbeaten colt, and Snob II, J. S.
Cosden's imported sensation, consid
ered by turf followers the fleetest
three-year-olds of the season,
loomed up as a result of the an
nouncement by Fred Burlew, Mor
vich's trainer, that he was pointing
the colt for the Carlton stakes at
Acqueduct June 17.
Snob's entry in the race, which
is limited to three-years-olds, and
over a distance of a mile, was by no
means certain, but if the winner of
the historic Withers stakes is suc
cessful in the $50,000 Belmont
next Saturday there is a strong pos
sibility that the rivals will meet
for the first time.
Burlew's decision assured Eastern
race followers their first glimpse
this season of the Kentucky Derby
winner before he is sent to Latonia
for the $50,000 Special" and the
Derby.
Matt J. Winn, general manager
of the Kentucky" Jockey Club, an
nounced during the recent race
meeting- at Louisville, that he had
been advised by owners Block and
Cosden that, present conditions
holding, both Morvich and Snob II
would go to the post in the $50,000
Special race at Latonia, Saturday,!
June 24.
