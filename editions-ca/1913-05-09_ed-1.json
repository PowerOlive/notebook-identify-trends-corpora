SOLICITING COMMITTEE.
The Loose Leaf Tobacco Warehouse
Committees have, during the rjast
week, secured quite a number of new
subscribers. Another meeting is
called for Saturday Tafternoon at 3
o'clock. This is an enterprise that is
of vital interest to every citizen of
Millersburg and surrounding country.
Ml re stock is yet necessary before the
company can be finally made up, and
should be raised.quickly, so vas to have
the house ready for the new crop' when
the market opens. It furnishes a home
market for tobacco. Ajlarge part of
the money will be paid out and spent
at home. It gives employment to
quite a number of laboring people who
now have to seek it elsewhere, many
going to our neighboring towns. It is
of like importance to the farmer and
the business man of town, and the
burden of stock should be &o distrib
uted so as to be borne d' the great
majority of those who will derive per
sonal benefit from it. Everybody says
itjis a good thing and if lt is a good
thing attend the meeting Saturday af
ternoon. If you have not subscribed
for the cause don't fail to 'do so then.
Remember it is to your advantage as
well as your neighbor and there is no
doubt as to it being a paying invest
ment. Underrating Influenza Germ.
One orange a week is to be given
to each child m the Lambeth Guard
ians' schools at Norwood, England, as
a preventive against influenza. All
we can say is that, if the influenza
germ is to be intimidated by one
orange a week, it has sadly lost its
pluck since we last met it.

J. H. Linville Succumbs Sud
denly to Heart Attack
Mr. J. H. Linville, Constable of Mil
lersburg precinct, a prominent Mason,
and one of .the most popular men of
that place.'died suddenly at his home
at he edge of town last nignt about 8
o'clock, from an attack of heart
trouble.
Mr. Linville, who was aged 55 years,
was in Millersburg yesterday after
noon. Apparently he was enjoying the
best of health in good spirits, and
having occasion to visit the office of
MillereburgCoal and Lumber Co., on
business had a long conversation
with a number of friends. He gave no
evidenceof 'being ill at that time and
about 4:30 o'clock returned to his
home, where he conducts a dairy.
After changing his clothing, Mr.
Linville went to the barn : where he
milked several cows, but before re
turning to the house, experienced
some difficulty in gettng a calf , in the
lot. In doing so he was compelled to
run the animal for some time, and
from this exertion became overneated,
which it is believed was the immediate
cause of his death.
Returning to the house he ate a
hearty supper and aside from a slight
exhaustion seemed to suffer no ill
effects from his experience. Shortly
before eight o'clock he retired, leav
ing Mrs. Linville sittinc on the porch
of the home. A few moments later,
according to Mrs. Linville, she heard
him calling her in a very feeble tone,
and rushing into the room found that
he had nxpired. Dr. W. V Huffman,
of Mlle.sburg, was summoned imme
diately, but life had been extnet for
some time belore the pnysician ar
rived. 6
( Mr. Linville was prominent in Ma
sonic circles, being a member of Am
ity Lodge No. 40 ot Millersburg, and
held the office of chaplain of the
lodge. He was a member ot the
Christian Church and one of its offi
cers. He had a wide acquaintance and
was very popular with a Jarge num
ber of friends, not onlv in Millersburg,
but in other sections of the county.
Besides his.wife. he is survived "by
onedaughter,' Miss Katherine Linville,
of Lexington, four sons, Harry, of
Millersburg, Homer, of Columbus, O.,
Roscoe, of Colorado, and Malcolm Lin
ville, of Peru, Indiana.g"At a late hour
last night no funeral arrangements
had been made.
"Yankee Doodle" a Silly Song.
Of the original words of "Yankee
Doodle" it is impossible to say one
gobd thing. They are to be seen in
the British Museum on a single sheet,
quarto printed about 1825, and sold at
the time by L. Denning, Hanover
street, Boston. There are 15 stanzas,
and each succeeding one from the be
ginning grows more idiotic. And yet
what a sensation the melody has
made in the world! Fitzgerald Sto

First Idea of Sewing Machine.
The earliest afctempt at sewing by
machinery of which there is any au
thentic record was in 1755, in which
year a machine was patented in, Eng
land by Charles P. Weisenthal. In
this machine the stitch was formed
by a needle, having two points with
an eye at mid-length, which passed
completely through the goods in imi
tation of hand sewing.

Choir Invisible Has a Recruit.
A Kansas man who has lately been
abroad reports that this inscription
actually appears on, an old tombstone
in a cemetery at Saragossa, Spain:
"Here lies John Cabeca, precentor of
my lord the king. When he is admit
ted to the choir of angels, whose so
ciety he will embellish, and where he
will distinguish himself by his powers
of song, God shall say to his angels,
'Cease, ye calves! and let me hear
John Cabeca, a precentor to the king
of Spain!'"
