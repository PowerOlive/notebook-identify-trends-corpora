is aboutto venture into some unknown placeI would probably have gone to my roomand procured a candle had not this fearsome sensation come over me I laughedat inyself for experiencing itTesting every step before trustingmy whole weight upon it lest the timbers rotted by the dampness mightgive way and precipitate me headlongto the depths below I went slowlydown into the Egyptian darkness Myhand rested on the rude balustrade allthe way and when it came to the endI knew I was standing on the last stepI am probably no more of a cowardthan most men and had never beenafraid of darkness but this was theblackest night I had ever been immersed in Really there was a lesserdegree of darkness when I closed myeyes for then the sensations of theglowing western sky still lingeredStanding there on the bottom step anunaccountable fear came over meProbably it has been perceived fromthis history that impatience regardingthings which seem to have a bearingon the supernatural is one of my characteristics To feel a sensation of fearwhen there is no apparent reason forit causes disgust at what I consideran unpardonable weaknessSo then I determined to chastise myThe sun was hanging low and a coolbreeze had risen I insisted uponwalking much against Sarahs wishBut the horses had had a hard day inthe fields and I would not allow themto be taken from the cool clover patchBeminding the good hearted womanof her promise to drifts over to Nelsonrille early in the morning I started upthe road toward home The dust hadbeen laid by the heavy shower of themorning the air was bracing the lastsong of the birds was sounding thepatches of woodland through which Ipassed were resplendent in the rays ofthe dying sun which shot goldenshafts through the leafy masses overall were calm and peace and solitudeMy spirits answered to the influencesAof nature and in a happy reflectivemood I proceeded on my way In mymind one beautiful object predominated FlorenceWith the lovely phases of the peaceful evening appealing to the sense itseemed natural for my thoughts toturn to the beloved one to dwell enher goodness her faith her love forjaeAnticipation of future happinesswhen my darling should be always atmy side should be in my life roundingit out in the fullness of content engrossed my mind There were nocruel forbodings no forecasting oflire events no warnings Even thesight of the station agent Skinnercutting across the fields toward Sunset Hill caused only a temporary relapse from my happy moodIf Skinners errand was with theMorleys Florence would undoubtedlyrefuse him admittance after what Ihad told herBy the time I arrived at my house thesun had fallen behind the mountainsmd only the golden rays remained inthe western sky and fired the edges ofthe single cloudGoing up through the yard I noticedthe door to the cook house was unlatched I had been unable in myexplorations of cherished spots of interest in boyhood days to gain entrance to the cook house The doorhad been locked and I had not considered it of sufficient importance toask Sonntag for the keyWondering why the place should nowbe unlocked I pushed the door open andenteredThe recollection of a deep dark apartment underneath which had been usedns a root cellar during my grandfatherslime was brought to mind by seeingthat the door leading to the stairway waspartly open Obeying a sudden impulseE entered and standing on the landingazed down into the impenetrablegloomNow there was no reason why I-should go down into that cellar nevertheless a strong impulse urged me oncowardice by keeping on and exploring that dark hole I would not allowmyself to beat an ignominious retreatsimply because a sensation of fear inclined me to such a courseI took the last step and my feet jrested on what seemed to be a loosenlank which crave wav a few inches Iunder my weight From the feelingof insecurity this brought to me 1thrust out my foot to feel my way before proceeding fartherBefore I could take a step forwardhowever from somewhere in that tomblike darkness in deep solemn tonessounded a voiceAnother step means death Pausebefore you take itTo say that I was simply startledwould not be true I was paralyzedwith fear My hair bristled up myheart began a trip hammer action andthe blood surged to my head in a fiercetidethe voice this time in sterner tonesBack forBut I stayed not to hear more Neverhad that stairway been ascended ingreater haste I fairly tumbled upusing my hands as well as my feetPausing not to close the cook housedoor I made a wild rush for my roomintent on the one only purpose ofescaping from the unknown terror ofthat horrible voice I closed my bedroom door after I had entered andbolted it Then I threw myself intothe nearest chair and covered my facewith my handsFor some time I remained so limppowerless and completely unnervedThe night had fallen when I againlooked up and my room was shroudedin gloom Darkness was horrible sostaggering to my feet I fumbled aboutfor some matches and in feverish hastelit the two lamps and the candlewhich were in the room The windowwas open I closed the shutters andbolted them The door leading into theparlor where my grandfathers bodyhad reposed in the coffin waiting forburial so many years ago was alsoopen and in my wrought up imagination specters of the dead seemed to passbefore it There was no bolt to thisdoor and not feeling satisfied in havingit simply latched by great effort Ishoved a tall chest of drawers against itEven thus barricaded there was nofeeling of safety There was no knowing what fearful mystery might comeup through the floor from the walledup cellar beneathThe experience just passed throughwas enough to frighten anyone Butit was not that alone which caused sucha complete demoralization of my nervesand so absolute a terrorism of all myfaculties There was something morethan the demonstration just encountered something from within myselfLooking back to the time now I realize how true it is that often comingevents cast their shadows beforeAfter awhile I began to realize moreand more that the intensity of the fearwhich had swept over me was notwholly caused by the sound of thevoice or the attendant circumstancesI scouted all idea of a supernatural origin but then what was itThe season of the year had arrivedwhen the farmers had about completedthe garnering of an abundant harvestand therefore a feeling of contentabounded The countryside was overrun by tramps the members of the dusty fraternity well knowing that foodwas never denied a hungry man by thewell provisioned farmers Perhaps thecook house cellar was a rendezvous fora number of tramps I was so eager toarrive at some explanation of the eventwhich would have a wholly materialisticbearing that the absurdity of a manseeking a resting place in a damp foulcellar when a much more comfortablebed might be secured out at the barnamid the hay and straw did not strikemeThen too the place would undoubtedly lose a degree of horror if a lightwas introduced So seeing that mypistol was in my pocket and taking thecandle and some matches I again madefor the cook house Having resolved todescend again into the mysteriousgloom I did not allow myself to pauseand think that would mean perhaps areturn of my fright I must plunge intothe mystery suddenly or not at allIt was like taking a cold water baththe longer one waits the harder to makethe plungeInside the cook house I lit the candleand taking the xistol from my pocketapproached the stairwayAbout again to descend thetinn n f niv PTTipripnpp nmp in Tnin all the force of its unearthlyities and I was seized with a tremblingfit My knees smote together and myhand shook so that the flame of thecandle was nearly extinguishedThe return of my fear howevermademe all the more resolved to go on Igritted my teeth and advancing mypistol in readiness slowly began thedescent Not a sound greeted my earssave that made by my own footstepsAfter reaching the bottom step I heldthe candle aloof and gazed expectantlyaroundThe room was about 20 feet squarethe flat stones with which it was pavedand the surrounding walls were slimywith moisture and here and there reflected back the light of the candleThat was all No human being was insight not a sign of one having beenhereAt my feet a part of the stone pavement had been removed and a plank inserted Lviner near the edsre of theplank was a paper with some printingon the outside like that on a bond ordeed I stepped down upon the plankand again noticed that one endsank under my weight Stooping down to pick up the papermy ears were again assailed by the solemn admonition seeming to come fromthe opposite side of the cellar Another step means death Pause beforeyou take itGrabbing the paper I quickly resumed an upright position and holding the candle above me gazed intently in the direction of the voice Therewas nothing but the walls around meWith cautious tread I took the ftden stepBack for your life Back for yourlife The words were hurled at mein fiercer tones than beforeI advanced another step and stilllived Waiting a few moments with attention strained to fix the spot whencethe voice sounded and being given nofurther warning I began by the lightof the candle to search the place closely with my eyes Where could the voicehave come from No possible hidingplace appeared nothing but the barewallsMoving the candle about it struck methat there was a space in the wall opposite which did not reflect back thelight which did not have over it thedank green ooze When I approachednearer two cracKS running paraueiand about two feetI perpendicularlyBack for your life again soundedbecame apparent I ran handapart myover the intervening space andi foundit aniooth A close examination re-Back for your lifevealed to me what seemed to be somekind of a wooden door rudely paintedto represent the surrounding stonewalls But there was no sign of boltlatch or hinge If this was a door itmust close with a spring lock whichwas on the other side But then howwas it opened Rapping upon the woodproduced a hollow sound Undoubtedly there was some kind of apartmentbehind itWhat was it used for and where didit lead to Was there a passage waybehind the door leading to the walledup cellar under my bedroom Thiswas probable as the door was in thewall nearest the main buildingSome one had gone through the dooron the night of my arrival and startledby the pistol shot at my reflection hadallowed it to slamStanding before the place and reasoning thus to myself I noticed a smallhole between two stones at about theheight of my chest Besting one handon the edge of the door frame I stoopeddown to examine it more closelyImmediately there was a blindingflash right in my eyes a hot flame almost burning my cheek a loud reportthen total darkness The candile wasshattered in my hand There was thesmell of burnt powder and my lungstold me of the smoke which filled thecellar Half stunned I groped aboutfor the stairway but it was some timebefore I located it and ascendedThe soft pure air outside partly revived me and I managed to drag myselfacross the yard to the main building andso to my room On the first occasionterror had lent fleetness to my feet nowthey seemed weighted with lead Anumbed indifference to my surroundings was over me I was heavy-headedand drowsy so much so that I fellasleepI awoke suddenly with a start thatbrought me to a standing position Aglance at my watch told me it waspast nine oclock and that I had slepttwo hours When I put back my coatfor the purpose of replacing the watchin my vest pooket a rustling of paperattracted my attentionThis brought to my mind the pieco Ihad picked up in the cook house cellar and hastily thrust into my coatpocket I took it out and examined itAmong the securities lost by the bankin the robbery was a batch of Morgancounty refunding bonds There liadbeen 100 of them issued each of 1000denomination and the bank had purchased the entire issueThe paper picked up in the cookhouse cellar and which I now held iamy hand was one of those 10C bondVWFpjj VBFTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS EX

abstract of the report ofthe court of inquiry which investigated the wrecking of the battle shipMaine This abstract is made fromthe report itself access to which wasobtained Sunday despite official secrecyunparalleled in the handling of officialpapersThe report is made up of eight partsas followsFirst The court finds that at the timeof the explosion the battle ship Mainewas lying in five and one half to sixfathoms of waterSecond The discipline aboard theship was excellent everything storedaccording to orders ammunitionguns stores etc The temperature ofthe magazines at 8 p m was normalexcept in the after ten inch magazineand that did not explodeThird The explosion occurred at 9 40oclock on the evening of February 15There were two explosions with avery short interval between them Theship lifted on the first explosionFourth The court can form no definite opinion of the condition of thewreck from the divers evidenceFifth Technical details of wreckagefrom which court deduces that a minewas exploded under the ship on theport sideSixth The explosion was due to nofault of those on boardSeventh Opinion of the court statingthat the explosion of the mine causedthe explosion of two magazinesEighth The court declares that itcan not find evidence to fix responsibilityCOMMODORE C S NORTONCommandant of the Navy Yard at Washington D CThe report is unanimous and is signed by all the members of the court Itdoes not refer to existence or non-existenceof mines in the harbor of Havana except in the specific finding thata mine was exploded under the shipand the opinion that the explosion ofthe two magazines was caused by theexplosion of a mineThe report as a whole is a formaldispassionate recital of facts and bearsthe stamp of that strict officialismwhich marks naval proceedure It isa brief not exceeding 1800 words andamong the eight parts goes to thegreatest length under the second heading which deals with the discipline andorder of the ship This the courtspecifies with extreme minutenessthe least detail of the satisfactory condition of everythingon board being given Thenormal temperatare of the large forward magazines at 8 oclock only anhour and 40 minutes before the explosion disposes of the question of accidental combustion within these magazines While the court holds thatthese magazines did not explode frominternal causes they nevertheless areof the opinion that the explosionof the mine under the portside of the ship caused theexplosion of the two magazines Thiswill explain the remarkable destruction wrought the explosion thus being shown to have combined the forceof a mine without and two magazineswithin The two explosions which thecourts find to have occurred with avery short interval between them isan additional detail showing that twoforces operated in causing the destruction The finding that the ship lifted on the first explosion indicatesan external source and one of tremendous power to be able to lift a battle ship of thousands of tons Thecharacter of the wreckage technicallydescribed in the fifth part of the report from which the court deducesthat a mine was exploded under theship on the port side sustains the viewtaken by some experts shortly afterthe disaster that the force of the explosion was exerted from port to starboardThe feature of the report of deepestinterest to the navy is the completeexoneration of Capt Sigsbee and allon board contained in the second finding setting forth the perfect orderand discipline prevailing on the shipand more directly stated in the sixthfinding which declares the disaster tobe due to no fault of those on boardThe inability of the court to find evidence to fix responsibility as statedin the eighth part makes the report soguarded in expression

scarcerthe fact becomes more and more apparent that the practical farmer shouldendeavor to derive the most benefit possible from under one roof This applies in particular to the barn A barnwith a basement under it may havenearlj a third more room than one without and that at the expense of but littlemore building material Especially isthis true if the barn is located on anincline or bank In any case howeverthe most required will be stones for thewall and generally speaking stones ofthe requisite sort can be had in mostlocalities in abundanceOf course there has been some controversy of late years concerning thecomparative value of a bank or base-THE OLD BARNtnent barn and one built on levelground Nevertheless the writer hazards the opinion that no farmer whocontemplates building a new or remodelling an old barn will be sorry if hechooses one with a basement WhyBecause such a barn is economical andwarm and if well ventilated very comfortable for stock Indeed in case ofan old barn such as is shown in the firstillustration rather than replace it witha new and enlarged affair which willcost much time labor and money whynot new timber new side and new roofit as may be needed and then raise it upsufficiently to build an eight foot stonewall on three sides of the rectangle thefourth to be boarded battened and prepared as shown in the following cutAn old barn thus made over will proveTHE BARN REMODELEDvery satisfactory and if only properlyattended to will serve for many yearsThe barn represented in the sketches issupposed to stand on perfectly levelground which renders the work of constructing a basement and approaches-for driving in and out of the secondfloor quite difficult and yet one hasonly to glance at the remodelled barn tosee how nicely and completely the wholemay be arranged by a little planningand labor As before mentioned thework is lessened greatly provided thebarn is situated on an incline or bankfor then the approach to the secondfloor will be for the most part ofnatural construction In any case abasement pays owing to the extraamount of room that is obtained and ifthe barn is only properly ventilated bymeans of windows and a ventilator atthe top a better more convenient andcomfortable structure for the housingof stock cannot easily be devised especially when the cost of constructionis taken into considerationOne of course can arrange theground plan of such a barn as he desires but it is well to divide the stallroom as far as possible so that it willgive the best servicePor tieing cattle it has been foundfrom practical experiments that a chainis very serviceable The way to use itis to place a 2x4 inch scantling withrounded edges to permit free workingup and down of the chain in the stallsin such a manner that one end of thescantling is fastened to the top of thepartition and the other to the top ofthe manger slantingly The chainplaced about this scantling and theneck of the animal allows plenty ofroom while eating and lying down andyet keeps the animal in its proper placeconstantly- The cow stalls should varyin length according to that of the cattle and behind all of them ought to extend a six inch dropSimplicity is the object aimed at andas regards the stalls they are practically separate even to the mangers therefore each animal has its own stall andown food a thing of vast importanceespecially where animals of differentages are stalled together FrederickO Sibley in N y TribuneEarly Potatoes in GardensIt is the habit of most farmers to planta few potatoes for early use in the garden But this is bad practice becauseoften the potatoes are planted on thesame ground year after year and as thegerms of disease live in the soil overwinter the potatoes thus grown aremost likely to be diseased Besideswhere potatoes are grown in successionthe soil is filled with hard shell potatobugs which come up just about the timethe potatoes do and will often be foundgnawing the potato shoots before it isfairly out of the ground It is muchbetter to plow a clover sod somewhereon rich land for the early potatoes andreserve the garden for vegetables notso easily grown by field cultureAmerican CultivatorItalian bees are not only more hardybut more energetic than black beesAN IMPORTANT ITEMThat Is What the Platlasr ofthoFarm Corn Crop IsSo far as conditions will permit theplanting should be done early as innearly all cases it is the early plantingthat makes the best growth and yieldAt the same time it is a detriment to thecrop and often to the soil to work itwhen wet or to plant before the soil isin a good tilth In order to make sureof planting early every advantageshould be taken to plow mfw Withthe plowing all done by using the discand the smoothing harrow the soil canbe made ready for planting very rapidly It is always best to plow deep andthorough Ground plowed deep willwill hold moisture much better thanif plowed shallow and this is quite anitem with corn When plowed earlyrun out the furrows clean so as to givegood drainage as in many cages thiswill help materially in drying ut thesoilIt always pays to prepare the il wellbefore planting the seed not oniy as anaid to the germination of the seed butalso to get more vigorons start of theplants to growing and as a help to beginning the cultivation early Harrowdrag and roll if necessary to secure thedesired tilthWhen planted early it is best toplttntshallower than later on A certainamount of heat and moisture are essential to a good germination and theseconditions can best be secured by planting early while later on when the soilgets warmer and drier deeper plantingwill be bestIn determining the varieties to plantthe character of the soil as well as thetime of planting should always be considered On a good rich soil it is nearlyalways best to plant the large late-maturingvarieties but on thin or gravellyland it will be best to plant the smallerquicker maturing sorts The largelate varieties may be planted late andon a rich strong soil make a good cropthough there is always a risk of injuryfrom early frosts But it is an exceptional case when it is advisable to planta large late variety on thin land Useplenty of seed bo as to secure as far a3possible a good even stand It is alwaysbetter to thin out than to replantThe condition of the soil as regardsfertility should largely determine thenumber of plants in a hill Two vigorous stalks capable of producing twoor three good ears of corn are betterthan four little stalks with four nubbins St Louis EepublicBERRIES IN BARRELSA

EffectThe farmers of Xebraska and Iowaseem to have suffered more from thecorn stalk disease this season than everbefore though comparatively few casesof it are reported in other statesDr Peters of the Nebraska experiment station experimented with cattlein order to learn the exact nature ofthe disease and his conclusions werethat a remedy may be found in feedinga grain ration instead of feeding stalksexclusivelyThis conclusion has been negativedby the experience of John N Garth ofWebster City la as related in a localpaperAir Garth has been feeding his cattle shock corn They have had accessto water and salt all the time Theywere turned into a stalk field one hourthe first day two hours the second dayand the third day five of them diedThis case sets at naught the smut theory the impacted stomach theory -andnegatives the conclusions of Dr PetersThe government has been investigating the disease for four or five yearsbut no definite remedy has been discovered If the disease is not increasing itis attracting more general attentionthan ever and farmers soon will becomeafraid to turn their cattle into stalkfields where a mysterious death lurksThe consensus of opinion is that cornstalks preserved in a silo never serveto introduce the disease If this iaproved to be a fact we may look for alarge increase in the number of silosin the corn belt in the near future Thiswould
