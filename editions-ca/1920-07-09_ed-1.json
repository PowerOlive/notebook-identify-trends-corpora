jnade in the legular term of the
IMadison County Quarterly Court,
R-lien a decision wps returned in
favor of the i laintiff in the case of
Bryant Newberry vs. Dave Smith
The action grew out of the agree-Tnenfc-of
Smith to buy a production
of tobacco f;om Newby at a stiu
lated price and subsequently failing
to do so, alleging- the product was of
r a quality below that represented
vhen the contract was made. This
necessitated Newby taking his crop
to a. sales barn, where he effected
its sUe later on, and alleges that
owing to the holding of the tobacco
as result of Smith failing to ful
411 his parto the contract, he was
lorced to sell at -a loss estimated at
$150. The jury after a short delib
' erjation held for the plaintiff and

consideration shown to our great
State of Ohio for which I am glad,
and gives reasonable assurance that
finally a newspaper man is to be
made the Nation's chiof executive.
Ohio has accorded Gov. Cox very
unusual distinction, and he deserves
his victory at San Francisco. Hi
nomination wilPnot change our ac
tivities in 'any way in Ohio. It, is a
great party contest before us, to be

'LOST A CUSTOMER
This, is the true story of how a
prominent Paris iurniiure dealer
lost a customer, as told THE NEWS
'in an :
A few days ago during an unusu
ally busy day, one of the clerk.s
was approached by a pair of Paris
newly-weds, who were on their first
hopping toui. They asked to be
shown various articles of homo fur
nishings, and made a number of
purchases. Among them was a very
handsome brass bed. The groom
put the question Nin a stage whisper
to the clerk: "Is this a good strong
bed?" "Yes, sir," responded the"
clerk, anxious to cinch the pur
chase, "We srand behind every bed
we sell."- There was a hasty cor
ference between the .newly-weds,
and a look of dismays overspread the
face of the bride, as sho blushingly
whispered to her hubby: "Oh, my,
dear, we don't want to buy a bed
here!" But the obliging clerk has
tily explained what he meant, the
atmosphere was .cleared up. and .the
nrass oeo was .added to the sum
total of the purchases..
