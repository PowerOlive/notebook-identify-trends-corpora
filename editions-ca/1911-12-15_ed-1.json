out. Mrs. W. G. Dailey, mother of
the hostess, met the guests at the
door and packages were received ly
little Misses McLona Butler and Caro
line Mclntrye after which they- were
ushered into the presence of the re
ceiving line which stood just within
the parlor and was made up of Miss
Dailey, the hostess, who wore blue
chiffon over blue mesaaline, and Miss
Ciay, in black net ovnr green messa
line. Candles under pink shades gave
a pleasing effect. Miss Alma Duke
Jones rendered pleasing music.
After the guests had all assembled
each presented the bride-to-be with a
card upon which was written a charac
teristic of a good wife. These were
read aloud, she then reading to each
from the book of "Fate" their future
destiny. These couplets from the book
of 'F'ate" were epsecially good being
arranged by Mrs. Dailey. The guests
then repaired to the drawing room
where refreshments consisting of
salad, beaten biscuits, olives, cheese
sandwiches, hot chocolate and mint
were served. The drawing room was
beautifully arranged.
On the large table in the center of
the room were silver candelabra and
candlesticks with rose shades and sil
ver bon bon dishes. On a small table
was a large crepe paper shoe of pink
laced with white ribbon which con
tained the handkerchiefs and stock
ings wrapped in tissue paper. After
lunch these were presented to the
bride by the hostess in an appropriate
little address that will always be re
membered by those present. The
packages were then opened by the
bride who bestowed upon the donors
her thanks.
More than thirty guests were pres
ent. It was one of the most deilghtful
entertainments of the kind ever given,
abounding largely in originality and
was a decided departure from the
average.
