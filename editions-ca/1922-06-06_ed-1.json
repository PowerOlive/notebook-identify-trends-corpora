PEPPER
Miss Christine Pepper, aged
twenty, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. U.
S. G. Pepper, foxWrly of Paris and
Millersburg, died last week at Ashe
ville, North Carolina, after a pro
tracted illness. Her mother was at
her bedside when the end came.
Miss Pepper was an unusually
handsome and attractive young wo
man, who for many years resided in
Millersburg, where her father was
at one time postmaster and connect
ed with other business. She was a
! graduate of the Millersburg College,
and was very popular with the peo
ple of Millersburg and the county.
She had a large circle of friends to
whom the news of her death came as
a distinct shock.
Besides her parents, Mr. and Mrs.
U. S. G. Pepper, Miss Pepper is sur
vived by one sister, Mrs. Jennie
Marie Carrico, of North Carolina.
The body arrived in Lexington
yesterday morning, and was brought
to Paris by The J. T. Hinton Co.
The funeral was held at the Paris
Christian church, at eleven o'clock,
with services conducted by the pas
tor, Rev. W..E. Ellis. The pall
, bearers, were: Ashby Leer, Frank
IVimcrt, Dr. C. B. Smith, Catesby
Speau, Ayelette Buckner, Samuel
Hardy.
. j-,. ,.oo oo-rt wn-
anger. ut lunty w "&" "
Ham James in this country and
Lange, in Denmark, both worked out
n theorv that the "expression" of
an emotion really helps to make it I
that if one did not feel the scowl,
the flush, the tightening muscles,
and all the inward bodily changes
that go with them he simply would
not be angry
And James asks his reader to try
the exneriment and see how colorlets
the anger that he feels or tries to
imagine really is when he lies back
in an easy chair with a smile on his
face and all his mtiscles relaxed.
- -j- i a nrrrA fY O
The experiment is 6vw v,,
and it teaches a valuable lesson, for
theie can be no doubt that to man
age the "expression" helps one to
manage the emotion itselfj though
some of the bodily changes back of
it, like the flush of the face or the
altered beat of the heart, can not be
controlled so directly and so easily
as that part of the "expression"
which depends upon the "stripped"
or voluntary muscles.
But if the frown helps to make;
the emotion, what makes the frown?
Is it not something made on pur
pose, like the "faces" that children
make at each other? But it is a use
ful form of action inherited from an
cestors who go all the way back to
the beginning of human life.
A flush, a frown, or a raised voice
can break no bones; but it is a very
good sign of something else that can
a sign that others learn to respect
and thereby avoid a Nconflict that
may mean wounds or death or both.
So long as men-will fight and dogs
will bite and bulls gore and snakes
will strike, scrowls and barks and
snorts and rattles are a means of
safety for all concerned.
. v . o- - -
The heights of profiteering and
injustice were reached when sand
was included in the list of things to
be taxed and the duty on brick mul
tiplied nine fold at a time when the
housing situations, not only in the
big cities, but even in the small vil
lages, is almost unendurable The
outrageousness of such procedure
was so great that even Senator Cal
der, a hard-boiled protectionist and a
builder, admitted that even the pres
ent duty might be taken off.
This outrageous attempt to add
further burdens to tenants and to
home-builders was thoroughly venti
lated by Senators Robinson (Ark.),
and Stanley (Ky.), among the most
effective of Democratic spokesmen,
but no -disposition was shown by the
hard-boiled protectionists to recede
from the amendment to the brick
schedule increasing the existing rate
from 25 to 225 per cent on bricks.
LUCKY MAN
(London Times)
There was a time when our fath
ers did not debate politics or the law
with the womenfolk; never
theless they listened attanta
tively when their womanfolk- chose
to talk of the men and manners of
the day They .understood that her
detachment from the actual strug
gle gave woman a position to which
man could not aspire. She spoke,
in a sense her praise or blame
amounted to a re-estimation of char
acter in terms of values more en
during than political exigency.
It was this detachment of women
which made small-talk both inter
esting and considerable. No man of
any importance could escape its acid"
purge; blatancy or bambast wither
ed quickly under it. The place hunt-
jer, the crafty fellow, the mere bab
bler soon found their level among
the dames whose quick eyes dis
cerned the man under the actor's
cloak. Now if a woman still, in her
heart, discerns the man she does
not give him away, for she is com
mitted to a party, a policy, which is
his party, his policy. Argument
has taken the place of epigram.

SHACKLEFORD
Following a protracted illness
due to the infirmities of age, Mrs.
Phoebe A. Shackleford, aged eighty
nine, died at two o'clock, Friday af
ternoon, at the home of Miss Lucy
Miller, on Vine street.
Mrs. Shacklejford was a native of
Shelby county, where she was .born
as Miss Phoebe Anne Whittaker, on
'October 23, 1832. She was married
jin early life to Mr. "Collier Shackle
ford, of Shelby county, who preced
ed her to the grave many years ago.
She was a woman of fine intellectual
' attainments and had traveled exten-
sively. Until the last year she had
I spent her summers at Lake Chau
tauqua, where she spent much of
j her time in close study. She was a
j cousin of Miss Lucy Miller, with
I whom she made her home in this
city, and of Mrs. Charles Stephens
j and the late Mrs. William M. 'Hin
iton, both of Paris. She was also a
relative of Misses Emily and Anne
I Thomas, of Frankfort, who have
'been frequent visitors in Paris.

jlliving Paris at 12:3Qo'clock. The
funeral was 'held in Shelbyville at
OLD
BRICKS USED TO
CHARM OF AGE
GIVE
One of the newest things in home
architecture is the return to the old.
A number of builders are using' old
bricks, for instance, to lend the
charm of age, as well as an air of
substantiality to their houses. Old
bricks, it is said, -are nearly twice
as heavy as bricks made to-day.
The effect of the old hand-cut
shingle is obtained by using split
shingles, a machine product. These
are larger and cleaner than the or
dinary type. Instead of a thickness
of one-quarter to three-eighths inch
es and a length of sixteen inches, the
split shingle is from three-eighths
to one half inch thick and twenty
to twenty-four inches long.'
Antique fixtures, such -as wrought
iron lanterns for the porch light or
wrought iron candlesticks for the
wall lights, are used effectively.
The stiff modernity of the cpn
crete walk can be eliminated by us
ing irregularly shaped blocks ot
rock planed fevel. When grassland,
moss grow up between the rocka'the
effect is enhanced:
