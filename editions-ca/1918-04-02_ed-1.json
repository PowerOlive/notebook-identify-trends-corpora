The little folks of the Graded
Schools enjoyed a marble hunt in th?
paik, Friday afternoon. More then
five hundred marbles, had been scat
tered through the park. At the ap
pointed time the children were taken
there by their teachers, and whea
the signal was given everybody got
busy and the hunt began. The larg
est number, being found by Leslie
Ludenburg, and the smallest number
by little Miss Violet Duncan. "
The Farmers' Bank is perhaps
one of the most progressive of all the
banks in the. small towns in Ken
tucky. It is always addjng something
lor the convenience ofbusiness and
looking tothe bst interest of their
depositors." They have purchased the
latest adding and posting machine,
at a considerable cost. The machine
will be ready for business about the
middle of 'April. It posts the books,
and with it they can draw off every
depositors' account at the end of each
month with little or no trouble. It is
perhaps one of the mpst wonderful in
ventions in bookkeeping. The busi
ness of the bank demands this, inas
much as they have passed the haif
million mark in deposits.

DEATHS.
BRENT.
Mrs. Kelly Brent, formerly Miss
Kymie Talbot, of Paris, died at her
home in Kansas City, on Saturday,
after a few days' illness. Mrs. Brent
was 58 years of age, and was a sis
ter of Messrs. Hart and W. &. Tal
bot, of this city, and Dudley Talbot,
of California, and Mrs. J. M. Ar
nold, of Covington. The burial took
place- in that city yesterday. The in
direct cause of Mrs. Brent's death, it
is said, was the shocking news of
the tragic death of her nephew,-Mr.
Hart Talbot, Jr., of Los Angeles, Cal.,
who came to his death by falling
from an oil tank. Mr. Talbot ha I
been in the oil business for several
years, and it is said had become quite
wealthy. Mr. Talbot was 35 years of
age, and was a nephew also of
Messrs. T. Hart Talbott and W. G.
Talbot, of this city.
GOVERNMENT WHITEWASH
We give below the formula for gov
ernment whitewash. We belie've this
should be published at least once each
years to encourage its use on the
farm. This is the season when sta
bles, cellars, fences and other struct
ures should be whitewashed. Paint is
unusually expensive, hence the de
mand for a serviceable whitewash
that can be used as a substitute.
Coloring matter may be added if the
user so desires.
Take a half bushel of unslacked
lime, slack in warm water, cover it
during the process to keep in the
steam; strain the liquid through a
fine sieve or strainer; add a peck of
salt previously well dissolved in
warm water; three pounds of ground
rice boiled to a thin paste and stirred
in boiling hot; half a pound of
powdered Spanish whiting and a
pound of glue which has been previ
ously dissolved over a slow fire.
Add five gallons of hot water to
the mixture, stir welLtnd let it stand
for a few days, covered to keep out
the dirt, strain carefully and apply
hot.

MAY BE WHAT MADE-THE WILD
CAT WILD!
While running a shifting machine
to a mine in the Snow Shoe region in
Pennsylvania when the thermometer
registered 22 degrees below zero the
crew noticed a wildcat on ttie tracks
ahead, apparently caught by the
head'. When the locomotive struck
the animal it ran into the woods
with a gurgling cry. On' investiga
tion the pien found the cat's tongue
hanging to the rail.
The vild cat had come to the
spring near by and vevidently stepped
into the water, with the result thai
when it was crossing the tracks and
stepped on to a frosty rail its foot
immediately froze fast. In attempt
ing to lick its foot loose .the cat's
tongue .was caught.

Sex on Plants. .
The chief reason for the existence
of sex in plants seems to be the need

Individuals into one, 'thus new forms

SANTA CLAUS'S WORKSHOP
"Long, long ago, when you and I
uere young," says Harriet Ogden in
"Santa Claus's Right Bowers" in the
April Red Cross Magazine, "most cf
our toys bore the legend 'Made in
Germany' stamped upon them. To
day this species is almost extinct
in fact our girls and boys wont have
anything to do with the few remain
ing. "But where does Santa make his
headquarters nowadays?
"Well, I've been to his shop and
I could take you there, too, any day.
It's called 'the Old Men's Toy Shop,'
because things- must have a name. I
went and I saw it with my eyes big
rooms where bearded men bent over
long tables loaded with horses and
camels, and giraffes and hippototami,
and furniture for dolls, and little
carts to wheel round; and I smelt it
with my nose delicious and painty,
with a tang of varnish, and very
faint if you were clever enough to
catch it, the odor of sawdust; and I
heard it with my ears squacking
saws and tapping hammers and the
voices of the old workmen talking to
each other and singing songs. So 1
know that it exists."
NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC.
You are hereby notified to boil

NO, BAN ON SALE OP EGGS ANYWHERE.
A report has gained prominence in
the past few days that the Food Ad
ministration has prohibited the sale
of eggs from March 1 to April 30.
.This is entirely erroneous and with
out a vestige of truth. Eggs may be
sold just as before. The only order
that has been issued by the Food Ad
ministration is the one prohibiting
the killing of live hens and pullets
weighing over two pounds from Feb
ruary 23 to April 30.
The Administration encourages
the extension of the poultry business.
The only reason for prohibiting the
slaughter of hens and pullets during
the specified time is to obtain a
larger crop of eggs, which we need
so badly.
It has been recently arranged by
the Sugar Division of the Food Ad
ministration to take care of the act
ual requirements of all preserve man
ufacturers and vegetable canners
who, will use sugar during the com
ing season. This applies to the can
ning and -preserving factories and to
the housewife.
As each crop comes and is ready to
pack, kindly apply to the Food Ad
ministrator in your county who will
see that you are allotted the proper
a,mount of sugar you need.
