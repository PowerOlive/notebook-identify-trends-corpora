MATRIMONIAL. '
MORRIS STUART.
Friends and relatives in this
city were greatly surprised to learn
yesterday of the marriage in Indian
apolis, Sunday night, of Mr. John M.
Stuart, of Paris, and Miss Bobbie
Morris, of Indianapolis. The wedding
was a miliary one, the groom being
in the service of the United States at
the Vocational Training School, in
that city. No details were given.
The groom is a son of Mr. and
Mrs. George W. Stuart, of this city,
and was for many years associated in
business with liis father in the firm
of Stuart & O'Brien. He was also
interested in the seed business and
proved himself a very capable busi
ness man. He is a graduate of the
Paris High School. When the call
came for volunteers in the selective
rcrvice as specialists in mechanics,
to go to the Vocational Training
School of the army, at Indianapolis,
Mr. Stuart was one of the first to, re
spond, and was made captain in
charge of the men when they left
here.
The young woman who became his
bride is one of the most charming
girls in the Hoosier city, strikingly
handsome and graceful, and possessed
of those feminine charms that first
attract, then endear. She is a daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Morris,
formerly of Paris, where Mr Morris
was engaged in the insurance busi
ness. The family moved to Indian
apolis some years ago.
Just before Mr. Stuart left Paris,
his companion and friend, Mr. Ire
land "Bit" Davis, knowing what a
lonesome time the embryo soldiers
would have around a training camp,
told him he would give him the ad
dress of a handsome young woman,
who would entertain him. He there
upon gave him Miss Morris' address.
That Mr. Stuart improved his oppor
tunities was evidenced by the follow
ing telegram, "which was received
here yesterday by Mr. Davis:
"Thanks for giving me Bob's -address.
Yes, it was a military wedding."
