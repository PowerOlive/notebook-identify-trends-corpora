"PECK'S BAD BOY." '
"Peck's Bad Boy," which is to be
presented at the Paris Grand next Fri
day night, is one of the most human
stories which has etfer been offered on
the stage. The plsy's story meager
as it is concerns such an American
hoy as is to be found in any hamlet,
village, town or city in this country.
It shows this typical American boy at
the pranks which every boy of his age
has played upon those with whom he
comes in contact. The Bad Boy has
for his companions a chum and his best
girl, and this trio makes things very
interesting for the Bad Boy's father,
his mother, and the man who runs the
corner grocery store.
This season'9 edition of the old
favorite comedy is brighter and more
entertaining than any previous one has
been because of the unusual ability of
the vaudeville performers whu are
with the company introducing their
specialties during the action of the
play. Prices for lower floor 50 cents
and balcony 35 cents.
