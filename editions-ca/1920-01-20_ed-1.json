- ROSE HATFIELD.
A very pretty home wedding
was solemninzed in this city recently
-vhen Miss Goldie Rose became the
bride of Mr. Charles Hatfield. The
'-eremony making them man and wife
-as performed by Rev. Arthur Fox,
f the Paris Baptist church, at the
fome of the bride's uncle and aunt,
3Ir. and Mrs. J. R. Johnson, on Clif
lon avenue. .
The bride is the only daughter of
Mr. E. D. "Rose, and is a very charm
iag young woman. Her wedding
gown was white sating, combined
vrith silver embroidery and she car
ded white carnations. The groom
is an industrious young farmer,
toring for several years been en
gaged on the farm of Mr. T. H. Clay,
2tew Austerlitz. During the great
"rorld war he served eighteen months
-ith a jmachine gun corps in the

with large hat to jmatch, and can-led
a bouquet of bride's roses. The
maid of honor, Miss Eunice Gantley,
was lovely in a suit of brown velour,
and carried a bouquet of pink roses.
From the large number of presents
they received it may be judged that
their friends were many, and that it
will not be for want of good wishes
if they do not move most joyously
on the matrimonial pathway.
Those who know Mrs. Bishop best
are the ones who love her best, and
appreciate jmost highly her many
fine qualities of mind and heart
that go to make the successful mak
er of a happy home. Mr. Bishop
may be truly said to have won a
prize in his beautiful bride. Of Mr.
Bishop it may truthfully be said that
few young men .can claim such an
array of loyal friends as he can.
These young people go out in the
world with the good wishes and the
felicitations and prayers of a host
of friends and with God's blessings
on their heads. With the lovelight
in their eyes and love in their hearts
the young couple make their start
in life under favorable auspices.
Ajmong those from a distance at
tending the wedding were Mr. and
Mrs. Frank Mahar, Maysville; Mr.
Dan Corbett and sister, Miss Mi
nerva Corbett, Mrs. John Gantley
rnd daughter and Mr. Reed Down
ing, of Wedonia; Mr. and Mrs. Med
