entirely this gleaming sheetstretched the length of the platform towhere the white bulk of his trunk stoodon end at the eastern edge The charredand blackened relic of a flight of stairsled from the platform to the slopingground some five feet below but noteven a hand rail warned the unwaryagainst a breakneck plunge into spacePart of the platform itself had beenburned away and some charred andblackened posts sticking bolt uprightfrom the ground in the shape of a narrow rectangle showed that a woodenbuilding of some kind bad formerlystood along the rear of the ricketystaging Midway along its length onthe southern side a shed with a slopingroof had been loosely thrown togetherand the ends nearest him boarded inand pierced for a door and a couple ofwindows bore over the threshold inblack stencil the legend Ticket OfficeUnder the shed were a couple ofplows and some boxes Out on thebare slope midway between the trackand a snake fence that paralleled itsome twenty yards to the south a dozenbales of cotton were huddled three ofthem partially covered by old war wornpaulins and ponchos the others entirely exposed to the rain of sparks tobe expected from any passing enginewhen the wind happened to blow fromthe track and all of them evidentlydefenseless against the predatoryhands of pilferers for jagged rents weretorn in the coarse sacking of each andhuge fistfuls of the white staple hadbeen dragged from a dozen gapingwounds in every baleThe red soil showing here and therethrough the scant and withered herbage was seamed with mule and wheeltracks and a few rods away a brokendown farm wagon lajr with a spokebristling hub close by its shattered axlewhile the tire rolling away from thegeneral wreck reemed to have crawledoft to die by itself and leaned rustingagainst one of the charred timbersThe southward view was limited to along low ridge of ugly white fleckedcotton stalks Eastward the sun wasbreaking a pathway through the fringeof trees along another ridge and a faintline of mist rising sluggishly in the intervening low ground with the hollowrumble of the train crossing an invisiblebridge told of the presence of someslow moving stream Westward thetrack came into view around a thinlywooded hillside with a clearing hereand there in which some low cabinswere scatteredWith this cheerful outlook to greethim at three points of the compassLambert turned him to the north Therewas a siding with a swi h at each endbut as three or four rails were missingopposite the west end of the platformit stood to reason that the railway company found the other all that was necessary to the traffic of so bustling a placeas Tugaloo A brown freight car stoodon the siding with wide opened doorsand some household goods loomed inplain sight There is more honestyin this community than the UnitedI States marshal would give us to believethought Lambert as he recalled the extract from a recent report which wasshown hwn at department headquartersHe laid his satchel and sword upon theplatform and wrapping his blue circular about his shoulders took a fewsteps forward and a peep into the inferior of the car Prom the midst ofbedsteads bureaus and cheapioned furniture a

quadrupedwas half hanging by the bridle reinwhile the dilapidated saddle had workedaround during the night until it settled upon the animals sideJudging from such signs or legendsas were visible over the doorways ofTugaloo Lamberts impressions werethat the vending of intoxicating drinkswas the principal industry as therewere throe saloons to one store devotedto general merchandise--which establishment painted white and with an airof prosperity and a flock of cotton balesaround it bore the sign of I Cohen andtold pathetically that the pioneers of arelentless and one sided trade had alieady made their lodgment in the midstof a helpless communityIt was sunrise and not a soul was apparently astir A street led away northward at right angles to the main frontof the square and straggling houses1ricd it at intervals on either side Oneof these with a belfry at the corner ofthe plazi seemed to be a meetinghouseof some kind possibly the pro temporesubstitute for the county

tohis feet but in his struggles he snappedthe old headstall and the remnant ofthe bit and bridle dropped into the dustIt was not until the vagrant stood erectthat Lambert discovered from the US brand that he was or had been government property The saddle tooturned out to be one of the old-fashionedblack skirted pigskin McClellans so familiar during the war daysAs the mule seemed only half awake andunaware as yet of his freedom Lambertfrst essayed to reset the saddle to whichhe submitted without objection andthen to replace the bridle to which hewould not submit at all but with lowered front and menacing hoof turnedhim about and jogged over to wheresome wisps of hay lay scattered infront of a shanty labeled Post OfficeFor ten minutes Lambert exercised hisarts in vain effort to recapture

BLACKMAILWellfancy itBY HERBERT ADAMSIsir I cant say I altogetherYou see they might bringit into the law courts and then theytwists and turns you till you gets allof a whirl and theres no knowingwhat youll say sir or what theyll sayyou say sirMy dear Mrs Hennell Avas thesomewhat impatient reply Ill guarantee it shall never come into courtIm a lawyer myself and I know howto manage it though even if it did gettried the jury would be sure to give bigdamages It is such a likely thing-that a lodger should trifle with the affections of his landladys daughterparticularly if she is pretty and he isa curateBut really sir I dont think heever made love to my Marjy I reallvdontDont be a fool my good womanWho said he did All youve got to-do is to accuse him of promising toanarry your daughter and then of failing to keep his promise He will denythat he ever thought of such a thingbut there are sure to be a lot of littlethings he said and did that youcan bring in and when hes threatenedwith an exposure hes almost sure tooffer you a lot of money to hush it upMeanwhile heres five pounds and Illpromise you five more when youvedone it -But my Marjy got engaged last weekto Willie Kent sir said the old woman avariciously seising the five goldensovereignsDid she Neve mind Dont tellanyone about it and youll make MrGrayson pay for their marriage expenses and house furnishingYes but hasnt he just got engagedtoo sir To Miss Byngham of the HallShes got lots and lots of money andthe man that could get her would not belikely to want my Marjy though she isa precious sight better than most ofthem- I know all about that and his browdarkened a little he loved your daughter and he jilted her when he got thechance of marrying this rich lady Itis so simple a case that you are sure tomake a lot of monetv but of itYery well sir me and Marjy willdo our best though 1 must confess Idont like itShe held out her hand to him andmastering his disgust he shook it effusively After all the arch villainmust be courteous to his toolsThe astute young lawyer chuckled tohimself in anticipation of his triumphas he leftI dont think it can fail if she playsher part well he muttered as hewalked rapidly towards his homeShe is such a greedy wretch thatshe is sure to do her best He is prettycertain to offer her something to bequiet and if lie doesnt the piteouscry of the wronged widow and deceived orphan will soon till the townIf he does pay up Ill take good cairethe tale leaks out and the money hepaid will prove the charges were trueAnd then we shall see whether DoraByngham will prefer this conceitedpopinjay of a curate to me I think Ivegot him pretty safe and Dora and herbeauty and her money will soon bemineIIRev Frank P Grayson B A juniorcurate of St Marys Pretworth wasas Mrs Hennell afterwards said completely flabbygastedMrs Hennell had been somewhattimid when she undertook the business but having started it the opposition Mr Grayson very naturally raisedaroused her lighting instincts and sheplayed the part of an irate parent whohas a daughters wrongs to remedywith lifelike faithfulness and intensityLook here Mrs Hennell said Grajson I always took you for an honestvoman or as honest as a landladycould be reasonably expected to be butI perceive you are only a blackmailer5How dare you say such a thing tome cried the virtuous mother Notsatisfied with making my Marjy sounhappy you are now calling me badnauiesGrayson felt considerably disturbedHe was indignant at this most calumnious charge but he saw that it wouldbe exceedingly difficult toit and there was little doubtXOO rVthat many of the townsfolk would beonly too willing- to believe the evil accusations4tHow much do you want he atlength askedWell sir one does hear of thousandsof pounds but I only wants justicesir Ill call Marjy and see what shesaysMiss Marjorie Hennell was a good-looking-brunette of about 20 years ofage She had bold brown eyes thatwould attract some and repel othersShe had been a little reluctant in joining-the conspiracy against Mr Grayson as no one knew better than shedid the untruthfulness of the allegations but having been reared by a socialistic father wTho regarded everyonewith money as a natural foe and beting shown that if successful thescheme would mean a quick marriagewith her sweetheart Bill Kent she wassoon persuaded She had had a roughlife and it would be interesting to knowhow much of her disposition was inherited and how much acquiredDo you mean to say that I ever suggested that I should marry you askedthe curate when she arrivedYes you did said Marjy veilingher eyes and trying to look modestYou did that day when you took meon your kneeWhen 1 whatWhen you took me on your kneeand asked if I had a sweetheart andwhen I said no you said you would bemy sweetheart And so artistic wasthe girl that she managed togetacouple of very realistic tears to trickledown her cheeks Then she went onYou told me your name was Frankand 3rou asked me to call you FrankThis is infamous cried Grayson ashe fell helplessly back into his chairThere was the merest atom of truthin what she said and the rest was anutter fabrication But how could heprove it and get people to believe him-They might not be able to establishtheir claim in court but his namewould be for ever besmirched bv theskillfully concocted allegationsWhat would his fiancee Dora Byngham say when she heard it He almost felt it would be better to be victimized than to create so unpleasanta scandal At last he promised lo givethem his decision in a weeks time andthey agreed to wait for that period before taking further actionHIWhen Theophilus Baines the vicarof Pretworth gave a garden party inthe pretty grounds of his vicarage allthe local world wTas thjere But to DoraByngham and the junior curate thewhole world only numbered two andthey looked forward with a great dealof joy to the day when they two shouldbecome one Frank Grayson thoughthimself exceedingly fortunate in having secured the affections of so rich agirl but it was the girl herself and nother banking account that he lovedThey had rambled together to a secluded part of the garden but they didnot talk much Dora was happy at being with him aud he was wonderingwhat answer he had better give his latelandlady in three days time and whether or not it would be well to tell Dora allabout it He felt sure she would trusthim and yet he shrank from the miserable subject It was Miss Bynghani whospoke firstOh what a surprise here comes MrHamerI thought Hamer was rather a chumof yours said GraysonOh said Dora with a delightfulmoue that would have xjleased everyone but the dapper innocent lookingman who was apiroacliing themNever mind said Frank Perhaps hell have the sense and g oodnessnot to speakHamer might have had the sense buthe certainly lacked the goodness Hesmiled very sweetly as he came forwardand shook hands with them bothI was afraid you were not going tobe here Miss BynghamReally whyBecause I was able to come myselfand it is so seldom that such a charming coincidence happens on my behalfWhat is it that so of ten detains youthen asked Dora while Frank preserved an obstinate silence hoping thatHamer would move onOh we lawyers try to do in practicewhat the clergy do in theory saidHamer and that is put an end tocrimeI thought you flourished on itvburst out Grayson who disliked Hamermore than a littlePerhaps I shall some day repliedHamer lightly but flushed a little ashe said itShall we go and have a game atcroquet asked Dora to create a diversion and perhaps get rid of HamerWhat Are you not sorry that thatgame has been revived Miss Byngham he asked It is so insidiousInsidious how soWhy it teaches you to go up to aball to creep as near to it as you caneven to embrace it and then afterlingering apparently in friendlinessand love by its side this apparentaffection suddenly proves to be a maskand with a mighty sweep you drive itto perdition or as near it as you canI think the game inculcates treacheryMiss Byngham and it ought to be punished as we punish breach of promiseHe had made his little speech with agayety that caused Dora to smile at hishumorous fancy but he glanced atGrayson as he spoke about the breach ofpromise and was incased to see hisguilty start The curate had turned ashade paler but he flushed ag ain AvhenDora cried merrilyBreach of promise No punishmentshould be too severe for thatCome he said huskily let usgo and join the othersAnd Hamer smiled with an evil glitter in his eyes as he followed themIVWhile the vicars garden party

BeIrrigation is being- adopted by the successul gardeners andthroughout the world The factthat water can be applied to fruits andvegetables at any time required isenough argument to convince anyoneof the value of irrigation Thoroughtests in the rain belt regions have demonstrated that irrigation makes betterSavored products and more than doublesthe yield In this sense the applicationof moisture by the hand of man has become a science Although practicedfor the past G000 years and anecessity in the production of cropsin two thirds of the world irrigationis but little understood by many of thebest farmers and gardeners in theUnited States The science dispelsdroughts and malces crops annual successes At best the rain dependencel If If If f If I riii k I I l lk I i i tIJ IK l iLJi iljiUiatcPJtc7SCIENTIFIC IRRIGATIONis only an uncertain substitute for independent soil moisture by irrigationThe sources of artificial water supplyare so numerous that there is no necessity for any section of the countrysuffering from a lack of rainfall Running streams can be tapped by constructing gravity canals springs maybe easily developed and their watersXtilized wells and cisterns can bepumped of their supply by windmillsand other lifting devices When onceacquired a water right is worth morethan the land it irrigates even in thesections where rainfall moisture isdepended upon for soil food Gardensand small fruit orchards and vineyardsnre especially benefited by irrigationeven though there is an abundance ofrain for general field crops The scientific application of water at the exactlime needed solves the long mootedproblem of whether or not the gardenpays for any except the professionalmarket feeder Many abandoned farmsin the east could be reclaimed and madeto pay as well as desert lands are redeemed in the west and converted intoearthly homes of paradiseSeveral s3Tstems of irrigation are practiced but probably the most generalmethod is the furrow plan This consists in a main canal which carries thewater to the head or highest point ofThe land where it is divided into smallerlaterals and conveyed by them to thefurrows These small furrows lead thewater along near the roots of the treesor plants and after passing throughthe entire lot empties into a wasteditch which carries it into a creek orether stream to be used again by thefarmers below The time occupied inirrigating a given era depends ujon thekind of crop and nature of the soilIn ordinary garden soil containingmuch manure and little clay a smallstroam may run from one hour to threetimes that long on a row eight to twelverods in length In most sections it isadvisable to make irrigating furrowsnot more than 20 rods in length as theends next the ditch or main canal gettoo much water from soaking

Mendenhall the chairmanof the highway commission of the stateseems to have expressed the commonopinion when he said If 3ou are building roads to be used by power wagonsand I think we are coining to thatyou must build them entirety differentin some respects from those en whichhorses now run Gen Uoy Stone director of the office of road inquiry atWashington is more specific in his predictions In a paper quoted at the samemeeting he says Undoubtedly thewearing surfaces of stone or asphaltwill be replaced by flat steel rails suited to all vehicles and laid level with theroadway so that wheels will pass ontoor off them with slight difficultyThese great highways will connect al3the large cities and will be crowdedwith vehicles of kinds now seen onlyin exhibition or on trial tripsSuch forecasts are an illustration oithe modern habit of discounting the advance of science As yet horseless carriages have hardly passed the experimental stage in America Nevertheless here is a of practical students of the road question planning forthe time when they shall be in commonuse Such planning however shouldnot neglect the claims of the bicyclewhich are not likely to be soon withdrawn in favor of any sort of threewheeled or four wheeled traveling machine As to the claims of the horselittle need be said The modern worldseems to be taking the position that hehas no claims which any traveler isbound to respect Youths CompanionSTRAINING THE MILKSo Task in the Dairy Nceilsto HeDone More CarefullyNo work on the farm should be morecarefully done than the straining ofmilk A strainer made with a wirescreen though often used is very imperfect and should be discarded Thewriter has found the strainer illustrated1 herewith simple cheap and perfect inits work A is simply a large funnelthe upper part of which is a hoop six or13AN EXCELLENT STRAINEReight inches deep with the top of thehoop a little larger than the bottomFig b is a tin hoop similar in shape buta trifle smaller than the hoop whichforms the top of the funnel When Iwish to use the strainer I place a pieceof muslin IS inches square over the topof the funnel a and the hoop b is puton top of the cloth which is pusheddown inside the top of the funnel Aperfect strainer wTith a cloth bottom isthus obtained The bottom of the funnel is made to fit the top of my milkcans When ready to milk the straineris placed in the top of the can and takento the barn and as soon as a cow ismilked the milk is poured into the funnel strained at once and all dust perfectly excluded As the top of thestrainer holds several quarts a pail ofmilk can be emptied at once and no timelest by slow pouring Samuel S Heedin Orange Judd FarmerBOV1NES THE PIONEERSOxen mid Sot tlie Railroads Settledtlie Western ConntryIt is the horse and not the railroadwhich should be given most of thecredit of settling this western countrysaid a state senator in discussing abill to regulate freight rates the otherday He was mistaken The niost potent influence in settling all the western empire was the ox It alone couldstand the burden across the burningsands as with little food and less waterit plodded its patient way toward thesetting sun Anyone familiar with theearlier days can testify to this Thetrail followed by the California 49erswas literally fenced with skeletons ofhorses but seldom could the bonesof an ox be foundAnother thing which may not be generally known but which is nevertheless a fact is that in those days an oxtrain would cross the continent in lesstime than a horse train It was theold story of the turtle and the hareWe once heard an old 49er say thatno dog ever made the trip from theMissouri river to California unless itwas carried in a wagon Next to manthe ox can go further afoot than anything which lives with possibly theexception of the camel Next to theox the mule was no doubt the most enduring animal engaged in the freighttraffic on the great plains before theiron horse made its way to the mountains The mules used in the overland work were mostly bred in Missouri from the best Spanish and Maltesestock and for generations great breeding establishments were kept up forthe purpose of supplying this tradeSome day the mule family will havea monument in this country DenverField and FarmTlie Cost Was EnormousNo system of rpad building has everbeen devised which for durability

during whichmost of them have nadfew if any repairs--GREEKS ON THE FRONTIERSome of tlie Best Hill Troops in EuropeI have been to Xalambaka and to thefrontier 35 miles to the north It is adistrict of wild mountains the watershed of the river Peneios and Haliacmon says the Trikkala correspondentI found at Ivalambaka one detachmentof Euzonoi they were still short of uniforms but otherwise fully ready PromKalambaka to Velemitza on the frontier a militaiyroad is being madewhich will be finished in a week Theonly possible passes from the Haliacmon valley debouch on Velemitza Asproklisia and Zarkos The last is nowpossible for artillery The Greeks keepG000 men there It is probably thesame path by which Alexander the Greatcrossed to the destruction ot ThebesAt Velemitza there is no road on theTurkish side beyond Yaskala whereG000 Turks are posted I then went tothe principal intermediate points suchof securiner neoiohvtes Thence I traveled four hours by goat tracks to a village above which stand the rival blockhouses The Turkish are the morestrongly held There are no paths bet-ter than goat tracks The Greek officers are most hospitable and I stayedthe night There are splendid views ofPindus and Olympus and the valleys ofthe Haliacmon and PeneiosThe Euzonoi on the frontier excitethe warmest admiration There are nobetter hill troops in Europe They areequally remarkable for their agilitytheir endurance their spirits theirtemperance and their intelligence Ifthe rest of the army were like them theTurks would have but a small chanceThere is danger also since they aresuch natural fighters that once mobilized they will be hard to recall without bloodshed Their talk is all of aguerilla waron arisingThey evidently rely muchin Macedonia I detecteda strong note of impatience As theyare mostlj north Greeks and Albanianstheir minds run more on Macedoniathan on Crete and they will be greatlydisappointed if the settlement of thelatter robs them of the chance of inAading the former As for the EuzonoiI am afraid that the Greek public reliestoo much on this splendid but not numerous force and little knows howmuch more training and preparationof all kinds are needed Political courage however great does not compensate for the absence of drill in an organized and not guierrilla army AtTrikkala there are about 6000 of allarms and at Ivalambaka and on tliefrontier 4000 more Nearly all the artillery is concentrated here and atZarkosWhatever happens the frontier lineneeds rectifying everywhere There isurgent need of a neutral zone and theHaliacmon is a far better naturariinqIt seems that Greece a Aveek hence willbe as ready as the present conditionsand her resources permit but unreadiness repaired in a desperate hurry willentail a heavy price and the Greeksmust count all the cost before theyj move London TimesFEAR THEIR MOTHERS-IN-LAWPeculiar Customs in tlie Householdsof tlie Xavaju IndiansSome of the manners and customs oithe Navajo Indians may be of interestto mother-in-laws There a man cannotunder any circumstances speak to oreven look upon his mother-in-lawShould his eye rest upon her even fora moment the superstition is that hewill by accident become blind It seemsimpossible that such an idea should beactually held by a large number of people The law must be broken repeatedly by accident without the paymentof the penalty Yet the idea is currentto day and is in full force and effectexercising an appreciable influence onthe social conditions of the peopleThe mother has no direct interest inher daughters marriage but the interest arising from maternal love mightoften complicate or even make impossible the usual procedure So the mother-in-lawtaboo began and graduallygrew into a fixed custom or law Whatharm could an irate mother-in-law doif she were absolutely prohibited fromspeaking to her daughters husband1And on the other hand what showwould a man have if left unprotectedto the mercy of three or four mothers-in-lawfor polygamy is commonly practiced in the tribe Some such law isan actual necessity in primitivecietiesThe complications brought about bythis peculiar condition are many andvarious An accidental meeting for example is very awkward to both Ifother Indians are present frantic warnings to hide himself are shouted to theman and if he is on horseback he willstrike out as if for his life The womanis warned and threatened and if possible hurried off and concealed behind arock or biish If no way of escape ispossible the man drops upon theground huddled up into as small aspace as possible and drawing his blanket over his head remains thus hiddenuntil the danger is jmst ChicagoChronicleorMFARO WAS KINGITH E BOURBON NEWSFIUDAY MAY 14 1897jit Was the Ragre in Washington Osrit ins
