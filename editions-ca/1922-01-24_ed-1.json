Perhaps you read that-remarkable
story of Calvin Juhnsjon, "Temple Dusk,"
in the Saturday Evening Post, And, if so,
you remember the weird atmosphere that
envelops it the hushed mystery of the
gambling den; the drama that r layed
itself out, with death and irony as spec
tators! That story was made into a pho
toplay under the name of "Without Limit"
and breathes the power of the original.
It's a screen play we know you will
