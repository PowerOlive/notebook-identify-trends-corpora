H. Cheser, 1708 Indiana avenue, Louisville, Ky."For all these years I had sufferedfrom stomach trouble and indigestion. My appetite had never beenvery good, it was seldom, if ever, Icould nd anything to eat that didnot hurt me, and there were somethings, such as pork or any kind ofvegetables, I could not eat at all.After every meal my food would lieundigested and feel as heavy as arock in my stomach. I graduallygrew worse until when I started taking Tanlac I was in a run-down,weakened condition."It hardly seems possible that amedicine can so quickly relieve aperson of troubles of such longstanding like Tanlac has me. Why,while I have only taken two bottles,I have a splendid appetite and caneat just anything I want, pork, vegetables, or anything else, withoutever having a sign of indigestion.Not only this, but I have gainedseveral pounds in weight, and am somuch stronger I feel almost like adifferent person.
