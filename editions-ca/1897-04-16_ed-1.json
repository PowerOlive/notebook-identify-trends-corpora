C F Clay is a horse of great finish and style in fact as much so as any horse

ter the dam of China Silk two-year-old record 216 beyond question the best
two-year-old filly of 1896 As a two three and five-year-old C P Clay was cam

of foals came in his six-year-old form and for several years afterward he was the
leading sire when age of foals was considered His get all possess his grand in
dividuality and are especially speedy and as to race horse qualities the perfor
mances of Coleridge 205 Choral 208 Connor 211 Arthur W 211 and others
