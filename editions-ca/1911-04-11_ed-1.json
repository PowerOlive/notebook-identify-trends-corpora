For the past two weeks the "Ogling
Owls" has been one of the daily topics
for conversation. Monday morning
the members of the cast put on little
red caps wich owls on them and wore
them continually on the street until
Friday night. Notwithstanding the
inclemency of the weather there was a
grand rush made for seats as sdoh as
the sale opened and by nnnn the great
er part of the house had Lcen sold.
Wednesday morning it 'aj decided
to move the place from thto lira house
to the M. M I. drill hall ..s it is a
more commodious place ami will ac
commodate nearly three hui arjd more
people. A11 of the best se s i i this
uuilding were taken by nco.i Friday
and had it not been for the continuous
rain of the afteinoon Friday this build
ing would not have accommodated the
ciowd.
The audience asembled early and by
the time the curtain went up at 8:15
the house ivus wll filled. The piece
was a burlesque in three acts. The
rast was strong and it was well carri
ed out. Mr. F. F. Hurst as king exer
cised that authority in presiding which
is typical of those of whom we read.
Mr. W. V. Shaw as candidate and Mr.
M. P. Collier as "Snigglings Snuff c."
or court fool, were the stars of the
evening with a strong support. Mr.
Aaron McConnell as "Witch," was a
tpyical ideal character both in make
upand work, while Mr. J. J. Peed as
"CiXecutioner" was always ready with
his ax and beheaded the candidate with
tht ease of the French in the days of
the Huguanota.
Mr. O. R Rankin as "High Hypro
tist" was perhaps the best character
of the evening inasmuch as he wa3 dc
ing the part of Dr. Miller, who was
compelled to give it up on account of a
death in the family. Mr. Rankin had
but one rehearsal in the wrk but
when the time arrived for him to ap
pear he was ready with the goods.
We are sorry that space will not per
mit us to make mention of all th
characters. H. M. Campbell as the
"Priceless Princess" made an exceed
ingly pretty girl that some of the fair
i maidens might envy. The piece was
humorous irom start to finish. All the
points were caught by the large audi
ence and there was nothing fell flat.
Mr. J. B. Cray and daughter. Miss
Louise Cray, rendered beautiful solos
between acts.
Mr. Cray in his Irish hong brought
the house down while Miss Cray took
everything by storm in her college so
lo. They were accompanied by Miss
Alma Duke Jones, who is one of the
promising students in music of the M.
F. C. Three beautiful solos were
rendered by Miss Lula McNamara who
is a graduate of the Conservatory of
Music at Cincinnati. Miss McNamara
is quite a pianist. She possesses that
grace and ease and at the same time
that dash and passion which always ac
companies the artist.
On the whole the entertainment was
exceedingly good and everyone went
home well pleased. The gross receipts
were nearly $175. The expenses were
rather heavy and it has not yet been
learned just how much the lodge will
ne.
