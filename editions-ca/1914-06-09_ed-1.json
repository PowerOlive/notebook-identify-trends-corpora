EXECUTIVE AGENT QUINCY
WARD DOING GREAT WORK.
Every law-abiding and law-respecting
sportsman in Bourbon County
will heartily approve of the following,
from the Richmond Register: "State
Game Warden Quincy Ward, has been
stocking many streams of the State
with fish from the Government, of
late, and the spotrsmen of the State
will Jiave another chance to enjoy the
sport that has for years was one of
the greatest in the country in Ken
tucky. In recent years though, the
seine, the gig and dynamite, have al
most wrecked the streams, and an ef
fort is now being made to regain, if
possible, the lost sport. Every fisher
man in the State should see to it that
the new game laws are strictly ad
heared to, and all violators prosecut
ed. There seems to be a determined
effort on the part of the fishermen, as
never before, to aid the State Com
missioner in replenishing the streams
of this county with game fish."
Finds Father After Fifty Years.
Wilmore Wilmore residents are
listening to another tale of separa
tions of families in war times in the
South, and the finding of the long
missing. John Lee, a negro, 75 years
old, of Shaker Bend, Mercer County,
after searching 50 years, found his fa
ther, more than a 100 years old, living
at Dayton, O. The father .had en
listed in a Northern army in the Civil
War, and had been believed to be
dead by every one except his son.
Grandfather's Clock.
Harrodsburg B. F. Smart, of Mer
cer County, has an old-time woodeh
"grandfather's" clock, which has been
in the family for 125 years. It is a
correct- timepiece, and also gives
changes of the moon, days of the
week and days of the month.
The old clock was once the prop
erty of Mercer , Daniel one of the
early"' settlersof tliecbunty, and has
been handed down from father to son.
It is now in the possession of B. F.
Smart, greatgrandchild of Mercer
Daniel. It bids fair to make another
century run.

TRACTION COMPANY ADOPTS-
NEW RATE SCHEDULE.
Beginning on June 20, the Kentucky
Traction & Terminal Company will
establish an entirely new schedule of
rates upon its interurban lines1 cen
tering in Lexington, the new rates be
ing made to conform to the two and a
half cent rate law passed by the last
session of the General Assembly.
This law has been construed to apply
to interurbans as well as" steam roads,
the latter having already taken steps
to put the new rate into effect and the
same time.
The most significant feature of the
new change rates is that it will en
tirely abolish the old five-cent fare
zones, and fare points, the minimum
rate as provided in the new law, be
ing ten cents.
.This will affect a large number of
interurban patrons living within two
miles of Lexington, Paris, Versaille
and Geogretown, who have up to this
time been enjoying the advantage of
a five-cent interurban service.
Outside of the increase in the min
imum fare from five to ten cents the
most marked change affecting local
patrons of the interurban service is
rates from Paris, Lexington, Ver
sailles and Georgetown. The rate to
these places is raised five cents in
each direction. The rate from Paris
to Lexington will be forty-five cents
instead of forty cents, as at present.
The special rates to Blue Grass Park
from Lexington and other points ef
fective as summer round trip excur
sinos will not be changed. The rate
from Paris to the Country Club, 35
also remains unchanged .
