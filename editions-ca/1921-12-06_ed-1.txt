Whenever a community isfound in which the local merchantsare not steady and liberal advertisers, the mail order house puts on acatalogue . campaign. The mail order houses get their businessfrom localities in which there areno live merchants.The truth is that local merchantsthemselves are largely to blame forthe success of the mail order houses.The local merchant can sell goodscheaper than a merchant in a bigcity, for he is at less expense, andwhile he may not carry as -big a,stock of goods as the city merchant,he can replenish his stock as often asmay be necessary and within a fewdays.But the local merchant must( advertise his goods and prices if he isto get the trade that rightfully belongs to him.'

COURT HOUSEynmnninnnni i milium HiiiiimniMiimiThe city and county authoritiesworking in co-operation, are seekingthe murderer or murderers of Grif-ffin Hatcher, who was shot .and killedin the South Paris yards of the L.& N. Three negroes who were inthe vicinity at the time, and whoshortly afterw.ard disappeared, areunder suspicion, and efforts are being made to locate them.One of the men,wuo was a laborerin the same camp with the murderedman, is said to have left the vicinityin a short time after the killing, andto have gone to Covington. His nameis being withheld by the- police, inorder to keep publicity giving thesuspected, man a hint that he iswanted or under suspicion. Thfc authorities claim to .be in possession ofvaluable clues that may eventuallylead to the apprehension of the murderers. Several clues that seemedpromising were run down, but abandoned. A general alarm was sentout to all surrounding towns, -andthe' author ties asked to assist in thesearch for the hold-up men who killed -Hatcher.Coroner Bavis communicatedwith. tb St. Louis police and withHatcher's aunt, giving full particulars of the killing.According to the testimony givenby. two colored men before the Coroner's jury, Hatcher, who, ashorttime before his death, had been jokingly accused of being "broke,"offered to wager that he could produce as much as $175 in cash in ashort while. The two suspects, whowere present and overheard thestatement, have disappeared.' Theirgeneral descriptions tally with thosegiven in a dying statement made toMaster Mechanic Ed H. Gorey, of theL. & "N., who was one of the first toreach him after . he had been shot.In the course of his investigationsCoroner Davis discovered thatHatcher had been shot twice in theabdomen. One bullet dropped to thefloor while the body was being removed to an undertaking' establishment.

At theend of the fiscal year, June 80, 1921,there were 26,800 disabled service menin the 1,692 United -""States PublkHealth Service, Coatract and Government Hospitals and Soldiers Homes,and that number is increasing at arate of 1,000 a month.Thousands of these men receivingmedical treatment, compensation andvocational training from the Governinent today, started their efforts toobtain them through the Red CrossChapter. The Chapter, acting as thedisabled man's agent Jn claims againstthe Govei ninent, informs the man as tothe procedure necessary to gain forhim that which is provided him b)Federal statute. His applications forcompensation, medical treatment andtraining are properly filed -vlth the aidof the Red Cross Chapter.Many Forms of AssistanceIf there Is delay before the man'sclaim is acted upon, the Red CrossChapter lends the man money to meetthe Imperative needs of himself andhis dependents.Most vital to the man's gaining fullbenefit from the Government's care i5keeping his mind free from worry abouthis home. Keeping the veteran's family from hardship of every kind andInforming him of Its welfare Is another province of the Chapter. Freefrom fear on this score, the man' lecovery and advancement' usually iirapid.Every month during the last year.the Ameiican Red Cross has givenservice of one kind or another to anaverage .of 129,215 former service menjand their families.
