necessaries Through the goodofficers of the Spanish government itis probable that in the event it is decided to send food supplies to Cuba inaddition to the remittance of moneyour government will be able to sendmuch more than would be the case ifivLty were exacted upon the goods imported An intimation has been giventhat such supplies will beadmitted duty free The importance of this remission can beperceived when it is realized that theduty on flour is 450 per barrel orabout its original cost In otherwords the 50000 appropriation willbe practically doubled in value by thesaving of tariff

CHARLES KINGLCopyright 1894 by J B Lippincott CoV ContinuedTlie effect of this unexpected tiradeWas remarkable The knot of civilianlisteners who had come to get such fundut of the situation as the circumstances -would jiermit and who hadbeen indulging- in no little half stifledlaughter were evidently amazed atthisnew side to the Yankee officers character and stood silent and decidedly appreciative listeners to his denunciationof the luckless Parmelee The soldierswho had for some months been tastingthe comforts of military service undercivil -control and trudging all overChittomingo county day in and day outon the mysterious mission of servingprocess were evident 3 tickled thattheir commander should at last haveseen for himself what they had morethan half suspected all along thatParmelee was an arrant coward whohad held his osition and made hisrecord for efficiency in enforcing thelaws onl3r when a big squad of regularswfas at his back-whose sole knowledgeAs for Lambertedge of affairs in the south was derivedfrom the accounts published in thenorthern journals and inspired almostwithout exception by carpet bag politicians and who full3r expected to findhimself pitted against a determined array of ex confederates engaged in theslaughter of federal officials white andblack the young New Fmglander began to look upon the whple affair asanother practical joke devised by hisnew associates simply to test his gritor gullibility This at least was hisfirst impression until the sight of themain body of the company swinginginto the square under command of thefirst sersreant and another look atCloses burning browrn eyes and ParmeJees hangdog face convinced him thatso far as they were concerned therewas no jokeBut how about the chuckling nativesnow augmenting their number everymoment Certainly there could be nodoubt as to the contempt they felt forthe squire as they facetiously termedParmelee or the ridicule which Closesappearance had excited until he hadwell nigh finished his denunciation ofthe civil officer Then for an instantthere was almost a rrpple of applauseThey watched him as in his uncouthill fitting unsoldierly garb the commander strode angrily back and begansearching the wall and window-shuttersof the jail for signs of bullet marksMeantime graduall3r recovering confidence or hope the besieged in the cellar of the meeting house began to parity The bell ceased ringing and humble voices were heard asking who wereoutside A brusque order in Closesgruffest tones to Come up out of thathole and account for 3 our prisonersseemed to cause unlimited J03 Therewas sound of unbarring doors andscrambling on wooden stairs and presently the portals opened an inch ortwo and cautious peeps were takenThe sight of the

first dajvofrcompany dutyfound liimselfin the fMfeammaildingHlie temporary post sof-A-i-Tugalco The responsibility now de-volving upon him was the only tilingat enabled him to resist an almostoverwhelming sensation of depressionand disgust Marching at route stepback to camp he had held brief andlow toned conference with Sergt Burnsand learned something of the circumstances that led up to the events of theday Old man Potts said the sergeant was a character He owned aplace half way over towards Quitmanand so near the county line that nobodyknew wThether he rightfully belongedto Quitman or to Chittomingo Whenhe was wanted in one he dodged tothe other Two of his sons had beenkilled during the war and the twoyounger were prominent both as citizens and skylarkers for there wasno miscniel or frolic going on tlieywerent mixed up in Sergt Burnsdidnt believe in kuklulc thereaboutsbut the colored folks and the deputymarshals did and so the soldiers werekept on the jump Old man Pottshad cussed Parmelee off his jjlace twoweeks previous but had ridden in toQuitman and reported himself toBrevet Lieut Col Sweet commandingthe two company garrison there andsaid any time he or his bo3Ts werewanted just to say so and he wouldcome in and account for himself andthem to an officer and a gentleman buthed be damned if hed allow that sneakParmelee on his premises Then hehad had high words with the marshalof the district himself His boys hadharmed no one he said The3r were fullof fun and perhaps of fight hewouldnt own em if the3r werent butthey did not belong to the kuklux ifthere were anything of the sort aroundthere at all and they only foughtwhen interefered with They mighthave expressed contempt for Parmeleebut that wasnt law breaking Themarshal told him that very serious allegations had been laid both againsthim and his boys as well as againstfriends with whom they forgatheredand warned him that arrest -would follow if more outrages occurred andthe result was that only the interference of Col Sweet prevented a shooting scrape on the spot Ever sincethen Parmelee had had some onewatching the movements of Potts andhis boys There was a young lady overat Cla3tons plantation to whom oneof the boys was devoted and Parmeleesspies reported there was to be a dancethere Thats how he came to go overto Buccatubbee with the squad butthev onlv got Harrv Potts and two ofthe Scroggs boys Barton Potts wasntthere They were riding home toQuitman county after the dance andmaking some racket as 3roung fellerswill and Parmelee laid for em on theroad They were brought into thejail by Sergt Quinn and the squad andthere left to Parmelee and his peopleAs for the rest the lieutenant knew asmuch as the sergeant except that oldman Potts with his boT Hal suddenlyrode into camp just after Mr Lamberthad walked away and the old man hadgiven Capt Close a piece of his mindafter which he and Hal with a coupleof friends rode back townwards Allthe shooting that took place was probably a feu de joie to the accompaniment of triumphant yellsi It was a fact that when old Pottswith his friends not more than half adozen all told came riding- in to offerbail for the boys armed only with thecustomary revolver thev were followedtowards the jail b3r aparty of inquisitiveand interested townspeople at sight ofwhich arra3 Parmelees posse on dut3rat the jail had fired one volle3r from thatbuilding and then rushed for the shelter of the cellar under the meetinghouse Thev had killed Potts muleand wounded another in exchange forwhich the Pottsites had ridden offwith the first two animals and all theprisoners they saw There was no oneto claim the latter and old Potts hadcoolly offered the former to the inspection of Capt Close one proved to begovernment property the other Parmelees Ill just bawrow these two totake us back home an then 3011 gentlemen can have em as soon as 3oull sendfor em but 3roull hardly expect us tocall again after the reception aceawdedus law abiding and peaceable citizensto day This was the majestic conclusion of Potts remarks to the surprised but stolid captain Then theyrode away and crossing probably atthe ford made a circuit back throughtown where they doubtless had a Tugaloo jubilee with their friends and fellow-citizensto the continued alarm anddismay of the bell ringers in the meeting house until warned that the troopswere coming when they deliberatedwithdrew across the railway trackfiring off a parting salute and a volleyof the characteristic southern vocalisms known to fame aS the rebel yellThis was injudicious It was wellenough to ride away in Compaq withprisoners whom nobody claimed or appeared to care to hold but they shouldnot have rejoiced thereat with riot andungodh glee It was human and b3 nomeans divine It gave the oxpositiontoo much to tell about in the startlingreports -that went broadcast over thenorth that very night and appearedwith lurid headlines in the morningpapers on the morrowParmelee had not been seen from themoment of the initial appearance ofPotts and party until he came scrambling into camp ori a borrowed muleLater that afternoon when matters hadmeasurably quieted down he made h isway westward in time to tell at thestate capitol his story of the riot to hisproper- indignant chief while allalone Capt Close was jogging over toPotts on the day accommodation little dreaming of the ill

station hasmade extensive experiments with difCerenfc methods of killing the woolly-aphis or apple root plant louse Following is a summary of the discoveriesmadeThe limb form of this insect can bereadily killed by one or two thoroughsprayings with strong kerosene emulsion Apple seedlings buds and graftsshould be planted in a small trenchfilled with finely powdered tobacco orJobacco dust and lightly covered withearth This will keep the woolly aphisawaj Apple nursery stock should havea liberal supply of tobacco dust appliedto the roots every spring in order to killthe woolly aphis and prevent it from establishing itself there It should be applied by removing some of the earthfrom around the roots filling the exeavation with tobacco dust and lightlycovering it with earth Newly clearedtimber land should be cultivated in cornor other crop for two years before theapple trees are set out in order to killthe woolty aphis that may be on theroots of the wild crab and allied treesApple nursery stock should have theroots cleaned and dipped for a minute instrong kerosene emulsion in order tokill the woolly aphis that may be thereIn planting apple trees tobacco dustshould be freely used among and overall the roots and close around the trunkin order to kill and prevent the woollyaphis from establishing itself thereEvery spring as soon as settled warmweather appears each tree should havea liberal supply of tobacco dust appliedto its roots by removing the earth fromaround the trunk for a distance of twofeet and four inches in depth evenlyfilling this with the tobacco dust andcovering it with earth The root formof the woolly aphis may be cheaply andeasily killed and kept away from anajple tree by the liberal use of tobaccodust About five or six pounds of thissubstance should be applied as above directed to the roots of every infested treeand half this amount should be appliedin a similar manner each succeedingspring costing approximately twocents per tree per year This insectmay also be killed by injecting one fluidounce of carbon bisulphide two jeetaway from the trunk on two sides of thetree but the use of this substance is notadvised except in extreme cases since alittle carelessness may injure the treeand it is alwajs necessary immediatelyto treat the trees with tobacco dust inorder to keep the insect away Country GentlemanQUICKLY MADE HEDGEWoodbine Grown Over a Frame GivesSatisfactory ResnltsMaking a hedge with ordinary hedgeplants requires a good many years ofwaiting before the full realization ofones anticipations Many are deterred from starting hedges because ofthis long period of waiting The accompanying illustration shows a shortcut to a remarkably -handsome hedgeA form is made of wire netting thesides and top also being coveredAlong the base on either side of thisTO MAKE A HEDGE QUICKLYquickly growing vines are plantedwhich soon cover the wire with a massof green that becomes more and moredense and beautiful each succeedingyear if the proper sort of vines isused The proper sort in thewriters estimation would include ourcommon woodbine It is a quickgrower and its foliage is remarkablyhandsome both in the green state andwhssi touched by autumn frostsThere are many other vines howeverthat would answer admirably for thispurpose so that all tastes can besuited Such a hedge needs only suchannual clippings as will suffice to keepthe vines growing evenly all over thewire as thickly in one place as in another Cedar stakes should be usedand carefully set in making such ahedge since once made and coveredwith a black growth of vines it will-be inconvenient to make inferior repairs though stakes can of course bedriven down through the netting ifnecessary Webb Donnell in AmericanGardeningDAIRY

FarmerCOMMON SENSE VIEWTurning Corn Stalks Into Butter Is aPaying OccupationSome eminent professor has been telling of the increased value the corn stalkwill have after certain of its propertiesbecome more widely known The pithit is said makes the best lining for abattle ship that so far has been foundIt is greatly compressed and thenplaced next to the armor of the shipand when an unfriendly cannon ballgoes through the armor the pith instantly expands to its original size andthereby fills up the hole preventing anywater from entering the ship Thensmokeless powder may be made fromthe stalk at a cost far below what it nowtakes to produce the stuff When theseand other properties of the corn stalkbecome more widely known it is statedthe farmer will get as much for the cornstalk as he does for the corn which isnot saying much just about now Butin spite of this new and prosperous future thrust upon the corn stalk we areof the opinion that its most profitableuse is to put it into a silo and with branor linseed meal turn it into butter Andwe are reasonably sure that if good butter is made from it it will pay betterthan to turn it into a contrivance foraiding in the killing of human

sought her advice years ago a greatarmy of her fellow beings are to day constantly applying for advice and relief and the fact that more than one hundred thousand of them have beensuccessfully treated
