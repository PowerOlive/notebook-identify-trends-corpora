WED IN" TUNNEL.
Conductor Everett Peterson, of
Paris, who has the passenger run
on the Louisville & Nashville from
Paris to Maysville, had a very unique
experience on his train the other day,
in the way of a wedding celebrated
in a tunnel.
Conductor Peterson had as passen
gers on his train from Paris to Mays
ville three colored people, William
Anderson, Emma Wilson and Rev. E.
L Hathaway. At Pleasant Valley
the minister asked Conductor Peter
son to run very slowly through the
tunnel just this side of that place,
stating that Anderson and the Wil
son girl wanted to get married in the
tunnel, and that he was going to per
form the ceremony. Mr. Peterson,
who is one of the kindest and most
accommodating men on the road,
readily consented. Two drummers
were called as witnesses, and the col
ored minister tied the nuptial knot
uniting the dusky lovers as the train
slowly steamed through the big tun-
ne j
Mr. Peterson says he has been a
passenger conductor on the Louisville
.& Nashville for a period of about ten
years and that in that time there
nave been four weddings and four
deaths on his train.

known in his own home as a man of
just principles and integrity.

H. KELLER. ,.
Within the last few days there
have been whisperings- and mutter
ings about the Paris Water Com
pany's plant. Whence come these
objectors and who are they? Are
they in the open and in good faith?
Or, are they in some devious mis
guided and unfair way endeavoring
to make trouble for the people of
our city, men and women of good
balance and excellent, good com
mon sense, by injecting into the com
ing vote on the Contract between the
City and the Paris Water Company,
all manner of rumors and deprecat
ing the efforts of the City Council in
having passed such ordinance as in
its good, intelligent business-like
judgment seemed best for the city?
I am not going into the merits or
demerits of the contract which is
now before the public for review. My
official association with the City
began in January, 1911. In that
winter, contagious, communicable
and infectious diseases very largely
prevailed. None of them, however,
was traceable to impure water sup
ply. Excepting the prevalence of
smallpox introduced through the
agency of the L. & N. R. R., a year
or two laler, when numbers of
negroes from the South were being
used for the double tracking of the
system, there have been no epi
demics of any kind whatever. Gas
trointestinal diseases, including ty
phoid fever, have only occurred in
one year since the present Board of
Health began its labors, and this was
in its first year (1911.) A storm of
protest arose at that time, and all
manner of statements were made in
criminating the Water Company.
Was there the slightest foundation
for these ill reports? There was not.
The epidemic involved probably 20
cases, all of which occurred, I think,
in the Henry Addition. A polluted
water, the old Ford Spring, was the
immediate cause of each case. This
source of drinking water was at once
destroyed, hence an end to the the
typhoid cases. In this epidemic
there were probably two deaths.
The ordinary intestinal diseases
traceable to highly polluted .water
have been conspicuous for their ab
sence. Very many communities in
Kentucky are now scourged with
typhoid, scarlet fever, measles, small
pox, infantile paralysis, diphtheria,
etc. If there is such a case here, it
is sporadic which is liable to occur
I under the most stringent sanitary
surroundings in any regulated city.
I think the Board of Health can
go on record in the statement that
not one single death has occurred in
the past six years which was in any
way traceable to a badly polluted
water furnished to the people by the
Paris Water Company. If such case,
or cases, existed, they were never re
ported to me.
It isn't within the province of this
article to defend a bad water supply
but to be just and fair to all con
cerned and give credit to whom it is
due. There are times when the water
is low and the weather very warm,
that the aroma doesn't strike your

olfactories .as would a, violet or a
Tose and that is pollution, but not
such as to arouse our people to a
pitch of indignation. Not at all.
Our citizens are too intelligent,
reasonable 'and broad-minded to give
credulous ear to unworthy and en
tirely uncalled for reports. If the
State Board of Health refused to
grant to the L. N. Railroad permis
sion to use the water from the Water
Comnany's plant the Secretary of
! the local Board doesn't see how such
action can be immediately prevented.
Since the life of the present Health
Board many improvements have been
made at the Water Company's plant.
j Such chemicals as are ordinarily used
Jin purifying water for drinking pur
poses are being used in our waters
here as elsewhere. Exactly the same
ClieilUUilU die uacu in vjiiiimion
and in the same proportionate
amounts. Not alone for clarification
and sedimentation, chiefly for bac
tericidal effect. In other words those
water borne germs which are known
to produce diseases incident to the
human body are being combatted in
their efforts by the application of
such chemicals as are known to de
stroy them. The Water Company's
plant is not of such antiquity as
should convince us that our memory
centers have been long since dead.
Neither is it - an outfit which in
every particular conforms to the re
quirements of a strictly down to the
minute filtration plant. We might
vote a large bond issue and build a
fairly modern plant. Looking from
my view point, realizing that there
are not now, nor have there been
during my regime any diseases at
tributable to polluted water, I will
vote for, and use my humble in
fluence to the endorsement of the
contract submitted by the City Coun
cil for ratification or rejection of the
voters on the 6th day of November.
Finally, I desire to say that from
time to time the public has had ample
notice through the local press of the
desirability of boiling all water used
for domestic or drinking purposes
whether such water be from wells,
cisterns, springs or hydrants. These
notices have been officially giver
from time to time. The suggestions
to the public are in keeping with
similar suggestions by the best sani
tarians in the country, men who live
in cities where bacteriologists of high
scientific attainments are busy each
hour of the twenty-four examining
the public drinking water supply
not a baccilus, not a bacteria may
I have been found, yet these eminent
health authorities say boil ALL water
for drinking purposes, the safe way,
and the people of Paris have been
sufficiently advised. On all questions
affecting public health the Board of
Health, composed of Dr. Campbell,
Mr. Monroe Mansfield and Dr. Ober
dorfer have been in entire accord,
and have at all times advised with,
and given to the Secretary such
earnest hearty support as in its
judgment seemed best.
Respectfully,
A. H. KELLER,
City Health Officer.
