This is said tobreak the .world's record. Fourthousand dollars has been offered forthe hen, but she is not for sale.But the hen doesn't "deserve muchLcredit, when you come to think of it.It was the brains of scientists, experts at crossbreeding, that createdthat record number of eggs. Someday those brainB may make everyhen produce -as many eggs as this$4,000 Orpington.Most of our most important activity in this generation is in experimentation that is, making valuable discoveries for our descendants. oTHE EATLE0ADSYThe transportation business as hasI been pointed out repeatedly, is theonly one in the world whose scaleof expense is fixed by one body ofmen, and whOBe charges for meetingthis expense is fixed by another.The railroad labor board tells theroads how much wages they mustpay and what expenses they must incur in numberless ways.An entirely different body, the in;terstate commerce commission, tellsthe Toads how much they maycharge to meet their expenses,The latter is necessary, for theroads are virtually monopolies intransportation and hence rates cannot be fixed by competition. Butthey are not monopolies in the employment of labor.A man in Texas who wants a tonof coal from West Virginia cannotget it at all except by rail, but noman is obliged to accept the railroad's terms of employment or gowithout workEverybody is willing that railroad.men should receive more liberalwagesthan the average worker, forthey are above the 'average "workerin the necessary personal qualitiesand the responsibilities of theirdutiesBut when they are giYen abnormally high pay, the result is hardship to the vastly greater number oflaborers in other lines whose costsof living are increased by theamount by which a special class ofworkers is overpaid.The Southern Christian Advocate,in discussing this matter not longago, aptly said that "the soonerboth capitalists and laborers recognize that the object of human exertion is the production of wealthrather than the acquisition of money, the sooner will many points ofconflict be eliminated."OUE STOEE TO BE OPEN NIGHTSUNTIL CHEISTMASIN OBDEB TO ACCOMMODATEOUB HOLIDAY CUSTOMEBS OTJBSTORE WILL BE OPEN EVERYNIGHT UNTIL CHBISTMAS(x ) A.
