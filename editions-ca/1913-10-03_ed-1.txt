H. Thompson,1 39 West Main St.,Lexington, - Kentucky":sa(Baltimore Sun.)Of all the thrilling experiences Federal officers have had in their waron postofiice burglars and safe blowers none was attended with more hairbreadth escapes than the celebratedround-up and raid which had its climax in Baltimore, where twenty-twoof the most desperate yeggmen operating in the East and South were captured, each man being taken at thegun point.Word had gone forth from Washington that the band of yeggmen operating in the East and South werebecoming daily bolder and thir postoffice safe blowing so frequent thatthey must be checked at all hazardsand the yeggmen brought to justice.Inspectors Bulla, Hooton and Gregory were the meridetailed on thecase.Inspector Hooton. trailed a numberof yeggmen and their folio were toMrs. Herr's saloon in Baltimore.After a long campaign of preparations a number of these men werecaptured. Most of these were thesmaller fry of yeggmen, but the postoffice inspectors were especiallyelated over the capture of Robert L.Shainback, alias "William Johnson,"alias "Will," James Sherwood, alias"James Shannon," "Fatty Ghee," Jno.King, alias "James Brennan," aliasJohn B. Stilwell," alias "Pa (Pennsylvania) Swipes," John Adams, alias"D. C. (District of Columbia) Jack,"and Charles Nor, alias "Charley Norway Slim."The captives were speedily arrigned before United States CommissionerRogers, and each was held in defaultof $10,000 bail.The inspectors elated over theirnight's work, called on the police toinstiute raids on the other resortsthat hed been watched. DetectiveBradley led in the invading party onone of the Caroline street cribs, andwhile only a few shots were fired,nightsticks and blackjacks were freely swung, and' it was a badly battered band of burglars that was hauledto the city prison, at the conclusionof the hearing before the commissioner. In the haul John, Smith, alias"Emerson Pam," alias "Frisco Slim"(but the original "Frisco Slim,")Frank Burns, alias "Thomas Grady,"John Collins, alias "John Warren,"William Smith, Edward Fitzpatrick,alias "Burlington Fatty," and JamesGallagher, alias "St. Louis Jimmy,"were seized. All of this group weretaken to La Plata, Md., where threewere positively identified as participants in the robbery of the villagebank. It was an easy matter to connect the others, together with someof those taken in the earlier raid,with the Mt. Airy band robbery, and,this done, they joined their companions in the Baltimore city jail forsafe keeping. Detective Bradleymeanwhile had arrested Robert Cassidy, alias "Big Casey," alias "Wilmington Rad," after a knock-down-and-drag-outfight.But one more of the yeggmen's retreats remained to be raided. Thedetectives on guard had conveyed information to the Postofiice Inspectorswhich led them to believe that thevery men working under the direction of "Ned" and "Connecticut Shorty" were in this dive, and furthermorethey had reason to believe that theprincipals themselves were not faraway. The round-up must be madeat any cost, for the striking while theI iron "was hot a dozen desperate roughsand thieves had been seized andthoses till loitering ahout the yegg-infested, city were needed to makethee hain of evidence, all but forged,complete.It was nearly midnight when twopolice; patrols drew up within ablock'of the saloon in Caroline Streetwhich harbored this band of thieves.At a given signal police pounced intothe place from the front and rear.At the windows of the houses adjoining on each side which commandeda view of the side and rear yardsof the saloon polices tood with pistolsdrawn and under orders to fire on thefirst man who mado a break for thesurrounding fence.After the first volley of shots firedin the saloon men scurried throughthe side and rear doors to the yardlike rats from a scuttled ship. Thepistols of the police stationed in overhanging windows barked out theirgreeting, and when this was accompanied by sharp and decisive command to "stop and throw up yourhands!" a dozen men paralized withfright, their arms uplifted above theirheads, halted in their tracks andstood waiting for the dreaded "pinch."And it wasn't long deferred.Policemen and detectives camesurrying into the yard, and whiletheir retreat from the saloon wascovered by fellow-bluecoats at everydoorway with drawn pistols, those inthe yard sheckeled their prisonersand hurried them away to cells, although some of them were removedto a hospital, where they remaineduntil their bullet wounds had healed.When noses were counted and pedigrees taken the police docket wasaugmented by these names: JamesSheffield, John Wilson, Edward Parker, Thomas Brooks, Roy Tinney,William Milan, William Stultz, JamesWalsh, Eugene W. Martin, alias"Kansas City Red," the latter proprietor of the saloon just raided; Wm.Row and Thomas Hart, alias "Milwaukee Paddy."A few days following the thirdsaloon raid the police located "Ned"at 2008 Ridgewood avenue, and hiscapture furnished a fitting climax tothe strenous two weeks the inspectors and detectives had spent in depleting the ranks of yeggs at large inand about Baltimore. The "policelearned that a man whom they knewwas an associate of some of the menjust arrested had with his supposedwife moved from 413 North Rosestreet to 1930 Walbrook avenue. Thisman they had reason to believe wasMorgan ("Portland Ned.") He wasfound home to the Ridgewood aveshadowed and trailed from his newnue house, which he was seen to enter shortly before o'clock in themorning. Detective Bradley haddone the shadowing and, having beentold of the -desperate type of criminalhe had to deal with, he notified thenearest police, station and in a shorttime he was joined by DetectiveBurns, Sergts. Sehner and Carey andPoliceman Joynes. Captain of Detectives Pumphrey also wns nntifioriand he, too, put in an appearance. !Burns rang the door bell and a wo-iman rpsnnndoH CKn a :.i i . . 1.-.uv-u. one uemeu mat aman had entered the house. This woman a Mrs. Adams, then slammedthe door m the detective's face. Thedoor was forced and as Burns andbergt. Zehner made their way intothe dining-room they saw a womanlying on a sofa. On her arm restedan infant, Mrs. Adams' baby, andboth were covered to their shins witha heavy blanket.The woman on the sofa Avas noneother -than Maud, wife of "Pm-fi,?Ned," the woman ;for whom he hadmore than once attempted murderwhile seeking to slay men of his ilkupon whom he thought she smiledtoo sweetly. Commanded to rise thewoman declined and defied the policeto touch her. As Sergeant Zehneruiaillu:i) cu wmen tiie woman clung desperately. DetectiveBurns noted a suspicious move beneath it. At the same time hespied the blue steel muzzle of a 44revolver peeping from beneath thesofa covering. Maud and the babywere unceremoniously tumbled fromthe sofa, and there stretched at fulllength, with a pistol in each handlay "Portland Ned."The police seized the pistol and ina jify "Ned" was shackled and takento police headquarters, where he washeld pending the arrival of the postoffice inspectors who had so relentlessly trailed him through sevenStates. Upward of $200 was foundin the yeggman's pockets, and therewere other indications to show thathe had been enjoying flush times tothe full. Two days later the policefound buried in the cellar of thehouse Mrs. Adams had furnished forher son, "Joe" Adams, at 2009 Cliftonstreet, two flashlights, a metal box ofpistol cartrides and a piece of fusesimilar to that employed by yeggmenin blowing safes.All in all it was a remarkable roundup and the inspectors who inspiredand engineered it owe no end ofthanks to the police, who made theactual captures in these cases bystriking when the iron was hot.::arHIi:!nHlgiiHlgI81II1311I51SgHiIgIHH!H5gl12111inHHimmHliiyiIHHHfmiIg'& "FT tfTitffcUr "W0MAN'S delicae system requirest& ir'VLlrJSLii V Vmore than ordinary care and attentionmore care and attention thanit is given by the average woman.Neglect ifc and ills soon creep in, andiia look of old zc, sometimes quiclJy,pometirnss gradually follows.M HS weIt oar I'EiHieIhct backer n". ?i common vnnnp- 'vomen, bringo vitli it the sunken chest, theheadache, ti ec . u 'or, 1 rov's i ctr, it jt ?oyn tVii j outhful oouy is so more youthful in aupcsaraiK'j and ali btccto of i ch oZ sulezitiun.Thorp is r.o won vhy y-. s's.cuM hrt so unfotun.il9, vVn joi hae at yourdicpojal a remo:y Mie-i uOr.PIro&'s SuvnviLo Proi.crJptic recomrner.dedfor over 40 yearn as a J ernedy for ailments jjecu'.far to women.

It is alleged the man accused of the crime was in hiding inthe alley as Wilson approached andfired upon him.Three shots were fired in rapidsuccession, and Wilson, bleeding fromhis wounds, made his way to Mainstreet, where he wai rendered assistance and was later taken to the Massie Hospital in an automobile.Thos. Craven, extra policeman atthe carnival grounds, was one of thefirst to reach the scene, and he foundWilson struggling along in his efforts to find assistance. Cravenhelped him to Main street. According to Craven he saw no one in thevicinity of where the shooting is alleged to have taken place.Three bullets from a 32-30 specialrevolver took effect in Wilson's body,one entering the right leg passing entirely through the member, the secondpassing through the left arm and,the third struck him in the neck,passing through the mouth and thetongue. Owing to his condition thewounded man has buen unable to talkand to give his version of the affair.It is said there were two witnesses.It is thought he has a chance forrecovery, although the attendingphysicians declare his condition to becritical. He suffers a great deal andis a part of the time unconscious.SPECIALI am offering some very specialprices on Wilton and Wilton Velvetrugs. Not many left.J. T.

OBERDORFER, Druggist,Paris, Ky.'CROOKS HAVE TEETH MOUNTEDTO USE THEM AS SAWS.(New York Free Press.)The other day press dispatchesfrom Boston described how a daringprofessional thief, George H. Prentiss, used his teeth to cut iron pipes,thus could escape from any jail, prison, penitentiary or reformatory at hisown sweet will. It seems that thissame Prentiss not only had the powerof thus breaking, but recently usedhis teeth to cut avay enough pipefrom burglar-proof buildgs, such asBoston's fine police stations, and thenstole 28 pounds of t'ae iron and leadpipes from his own cell in the EastDedham Street Station.These burglars, gunmen and second story men use their teeth to cutthe pipes at both ends, enter thebuildings as they please, and thentake the iron away with them to selltor pocket money.This is not by any means so straneeor rare a trick as the press seemeddisposed to think it. A prominentdentist of national reputation, whodose not care to be quoted, in a private discussion said recently that certain bold and shady characters of theunderworld, such as veeirmen. trnn-men, burglars and the like, have theirteetn nlled with gold or platinumwhen there is nothin wrong withtheir teeth."A -certain notorious crook, who isnow serving a long term in SingSing," said he, "had better be wathed with the utmost care. This fellow, whose name I do not care to divulge because of professional ethics,has several teeth filled with wold, anda hard saw edge has been groundinto the gold. Briefly, it may be saidthat his mouth is filled with hardchisels and cold saws, ready to sawhis way through steel and iron, soilor barriers of any sort."Another criminal now at large,who escaped from a Western penitentiary in some to the authoritiesmysterious manner, had his teeth filled with platinum, gold and a dia-'mond. He came to my office originally and showed me a newspaperclipping with the account of an actress, whose name now escapes me,who had a tooth filled with a diamond. "Can that really be done, Doc," heasked with the familiarity commonamong ,the rats. Little thinking atthe time what he could wish withdiamond teeth, I answered: 'Yes, ifyou furnish the diamond.'"Well, you may picture to yourselfmy surprise when he returned notmore than two hours later with asharply pointed one-carat diamond,worth at least 150, and requested meto crown a good tooth with gold andto firmly set that diamond in it.wiiy, lie even picked out the tooth,and I, without a thought of what heintended to do , filled, crowned andset the tooth and the diamond as hedesired. One night, long afterward, Iwas awakened oh, no, not as youguess, by a burglar that turned outto be my patient by a telephone -callfrom this very fellow, who had beencaught red-handed breaking open thesafe of a down-town business house.Ue had the nerve to ask me to go hisbail."Well he was not convicted thattime, but his record soon becomeknown to the police, and he was sentenced to a long prison term when hewas next caught."'CASCARETS" ALWAYSSTRAIGHTEN YOU UP.When Constipate Headachy, Bilious,Stomach Sour, Breath Bad.Get a ten-cent box now.You men and women who can't getfeeling right who have headache,coated tongue, foul taste and foulbreath, dizziness, can't sleep,are bil-ious, nervous and upset, botheredwitn a sick, gassy, disordered stomach, or have backache and feel wornout.Are you keeping your bowels cleanwith Cascarets or merely forcing apassageway every few days withsalts, cathartic pills or castor oil?Cascarets work while you sleep;cleanse the stomach, remove the sour,undigested, fermenting food and foulgases; take the excess bile from theliver and carry out of the system allthe constipated waste matter andpoison in the bowels.A Cascaret tonight will straightenyou out by morning a ten-cent boxfrom any drug store will keep yourstomach sweet; liver and bowels regular, and head clear for months.Don't forget the children.

ELVOVE,Paris, Kent-utclcyOur Call Home Phone 360iThe production of a new play byDavid Belasco is always awaited witha thill of expectation by the theatregoers all over the country. The consistent excellence and popularity ofall his previous offerings is causeenough for this. "A Good LittleDevil," howerer, which is to have itsfirst production at the Grand OperaHouse, Cinncinnati, the week commencing Monday evening, October20th, is looked for with a somewhatkeener anticipation than the usualyearly offering of Mr. Belasco, in asmuch as the magnitude of the produc:tion only permits presentation in thelarge cities. Out-of-town patronsought, therefore, to secure seats bymail order as speedily as possible."A Good Little Devil" is a play ofinternational reputation. It is thework of Rosemond Rostand, the greatFrenchman? who gave "Cyrano deBergerac," "Chanticler," "L'Aiglon"and the other great postic dramas tothe world., One can imagine that asthis play grew from the first outlineof its plot, until it reached its finisheddramatic form, it was read, and commented upon scene by scene and actby act by the master dramatist. Thisis clearly shown by frequent passagesof verse which occur as in Cyrano,and the presence of a poet amongthe characters. The fantasies of"Chanticler" are also recalled in thesentient animals and birds which lenda fantastic charm to the outdoorscenes.The story is one filled with poetryand sentiment, as well as an abundance of comedy, and finally turns outhappily, as well regulated fairy talesshould. The scenes are laid in oldScoteh's garret and cottage, and inJuliet's garden, which undergo magical transformations from time totime under the touch of Queen Mab'sfairy wand."A Good Little Devil" ran for along time last season at the RepublicTheatre and shows the master touchof Belasco in every line. The English adaption was made for Mr. Belasco by Austin Strong, who is saidto have faithfully presented the poetic spirit and high literature valuesof the French originals. The cast indues Milliam Norris as the aunt,Ernest Truex as Charles, and MaryPickford as Juliet. Miss Pickford,who is better known as the "MaudeAdams" of the movies, has made thehit of her brilliant career in thischarming character. The fact of witnessing "Little Mary" in real life isan opportunity rarely offered.The balance of the cast is up tothe usual excellence presented by Mr.Belasco.9999999999999999999999999999999- Messers ' . j .Jas.

Sim Levy, on Pleasant street, about two weeks ago hasbeen the source of great consternation among the members of the familyever since. Mrs. Levy discovered thesnake, and, becoming frightened,called for some one to assist her indispatching the reptile.Mr. J. W. Brown, who was passing,went to her assistance, but his snakeship had made his escape. Mrs. Levydescribed the reptile as being aboutfive or six feet long, and since thattime constant fear of another invasion has kept the family in a stateof uproar.A few nights ago Mr. Levy wentdown town to a picture show, and, returning, discovered the snake(?) coiled to an immense heiglit on the frontporch. Calling to his wife not to befrightened at any unusual noise, heenlisted the aid of several boys, andthe party gathered all the stones possible to carry, and cautiously ventured on the porch for fear of disturbing the slumbers of the reptile.As a means of putting an end to itin short order Sim secured a stonethat weighed in the neighborhood offifteen pounds, and when within afew feet of the object let go at itwith all his strength, while at thesame time the enlisted force showered the object with small stones. Thenoise of the onslaught aroused thewhole neighborhood, and when thesmoke of the batti-; cleared away,much to the chagrin of the belligerents, instead of a mutilated, bleedingreptile they found a large mass ofcotton, fur and excelsior. It was hislittle boy's Teddy Bear that had beenso valiantly slain C?).PARIS WATER SUPPLYALMOST AT AN END.The question of a water supply is becoming a serious problem in this cityat the present time and unless a heavyrain falls within the next week Pariswill be practically without enough water for domestic purposes and therewill only be a limited amount for fireprotection.No rain of any consequence havingfallen in the past two months and owing to the extreme drouth, StonerCreek, from which the water for thecity is secured is at the lowest stagesince 18S1, when the bottom of thestream was visible for miles above thedam. The small pools of water standing in the stream bed, have beentrenched in efforts to get all that canbe secured within the reach of thepumps of the Paris Water Co. and theLouisville and Nashville railroad.The latter company began Mondayto lay a temporary pipe line from themouth of the Doyle spring and emptyin above the dam. The line was completed Tuesday morning and a pump isnow engaged in lifting the supply ofwater above the dam.Superintendent Newt. Mitchell, ofthe Paris Water Co.,-has notified allconsumers to refrain from the unnecessary use of water, and has orderedthat the sprinkling of the streets bestopped under penalty of having theentire supply of the city cut off for atime at least.At the present time there is a sufficient amount to affoiG fire protection,which is being preserved for an emergency. Mayor J. T. Hinton yesterdaynotified Superintendent Mitchell thatthe city would refuse to honor anyclaims of the water company untilthey came up to the requirements oftheir contract. Mr. Mitchell, however,is doing everything in his power tomeet the demand made upon the reservoir and has a large force of menabove the pumping station trenchingthe bed of the stream. He has had allof the springs flowing into the streamsdynamited, with the hope of securinga stronger flow of water, but with little result.In less than a mils lin-strpam thAj creek can be crossed on the rocks inas many as a dozen places. The condition has now assumed a criticalstage and unless rain falls shortly insufficient quantities to flood the bed ofthe stream, Paris wil be face to facewith the most distressing water famine in thirty-two years.FOR PRESERVING.The best pears for preserving thatwere ever brought to Paris.
