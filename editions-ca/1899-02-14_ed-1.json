FREAKS OF MEMORY
QUEER
PRANKS FOR WHICH
IS NO ACCOUNTING
THERE
iaitancpt of the SlBgiltr Ef
fect Produced Ipon the Mind by
GuzinR Steadily at a Crystal For-
Incident Recalled
The rceer freaks of memory are a
constant puzzle to those who study
psychical phenomena Who has not
been driven to the verge of distraction
by the total inability to recall a name
when an effort was made to do so and
when the occasion for such remem
own volition t
Great minds have wrestled to find an
explanation for the pranks that memory
plays and have had to give up the
eflo t In the course of a systematic at
tempt to arrive at some understanding
with regard to the wonders of memory
a very valuable and unique body of
testimony has been obtained The fol
lowing questions have been put to 200
American university students and pro
fessional persons 151 being men and
49 being women The answers are here
given with the questions
Question 1 When you cannot recall
a name you want does it seem to come
bu spontaneously without being sug
gested by any perceived association of
ideas To this 11 per cent answered
No and 81 per cent Yes
Question 2 Does such recovery ever
come during sleep To this 1 7 per cent
answered No and 28 percent Yes
Some examples given
1 This morning I tried to recall the
name of a character I had read of the
failed I taught a class
honi in the afternoon all the names re
curred to me without effort
2 I tried to recall the name of a
book Gave it up Half an hour later
while talking of something else blurted
it out without conscious volition
Question 3 On seeing a sight or
hearing a sound for the first time have
you ever felt that you had seen or vessels approached the
hta 1 the same before Fifty nine per around a candle He
eet answered Yes
The action of unconscious memory
during sleep is illustrated by further
queries
Question 4 Do you dream Ninety
four per cent answered Yes
Qaestion 5 Can you wake at a given pointer
hour determined before going to sleep
without waking up many times before
Fifty -nine per cent answered Yes
Thirty -one tkt cent answered No
Question 6 If you can how about
failure Sixty nine per cent seldom
failed 25 per cent often
Question 7 Do you come direct from
oblivion into consciousness Sixty four
per cent answered Yes and 16 per
cent Gradually
Examples
I I had to give medicine every two
hours exactly to my wife I am a very
sound sleeper but for six weeks I woke
up every two hours and never missed
giving the medicine
2 I am always awake five minutes
before the hour I set the alarm
3 I had had little sleep for ten days
and went to bed at 9 asking to be
called at midnight I fell asleep at
once I rose and dressed as the clock
stuck 12 and could not believe I had
not been called
A strange phenomenon has come to
light in the course of the inquiry into
the mystery of memory It has been
discovered that by gazing steadily at a
cr atal consciousness is partly lost In
to the void thus produced those who
have practiced crystal gazing find that
enter unbidden forgotten incidents
and lost memories To give a few in
stances A lady in crystal gazing saw a
bit of dark wall covered with white
flowers She was conscious she must
have seen it somewhere but had no
recollection where She walked over the
ground she had just traversed and
found the wall which she had passed
unnoticed
ae took out her bankbook another
day Shortly afterward she was gazing
at the crystal and saw nothing but the
number one She thought it was some
hack number but taking up the bank
book found to her surprise it was the
number of the account
jLl another time she destroyed a let
I without noting the address She
could only remember the town After
gazing at the crystal some time she
Sf 7 321 Jefferson avenue She ad
dVed the letter there adding the
town and found it was right
A lady sat in a room to write where
she had sat eight years before She felt
L eet moving restlessly under the ta
ble and then remembered that eight
years before she always had a footstool
It was this her feet were seeking
Psychical research brings to light
mnny cases of similar strange trieks of
memory It is easy to find instances
that serve to deepen the mystery It is
not so easy to give an explanation The

MYSTERIOUS LIGHT AT SEA
Three Steamers Didnt I nderati
It but the Prince of Monaco Knew
The Prince of Monaco has been known
since 1885 as an enthusiastic student
of the sea and its various forms of life
He usually spends his summers in the
study of ocennographic problems and
his cruises have on some occasions been
extended almost to the coasts of Amer
ica He delivered a lecture before the
Royal Geographical society in London
in which he told this incident
One afternoon while in the bay of
Biscay he sank the trap in which he
collected specimens of sea life It went
to the bottom in over 1000 feet of
brance was past had the missing name water and as night approached he fas
nasn into the mind apparently of its tened to th wi attafihad to it an W
trie buoy and then stood off a mile or
so It did not happen to occur to him
that he was right in the track of steam
ers plying between northern Europe
and the Mediterranean but he was re
minded of the fact later
As he and his 14 sailors were watch
ing with a good deal of satisfaction the
swaying buoy with its brilliant illu
mination a steamers lights came into
view It was soon evident that the
steamer was curious to know the mean
ing of the illumination for she altered
her course and made for the light She
knew that no fishing boats came out so
far from land and so determined to
solve the mystery Up she came to
within a quarter of a mile of the buoy
slowed up for a minute and then start
ed ahead perhaps a little disgusted at
the incident that had lured her several
miles out of her course
She had hardly got away when a sec
ond steamer came into view and she
too bore down upon the lighted buoy
The marines on the princes vessel un-
night before in one of Scotts novels and derstood by this time that the
and walking
tion was probably believed to be evi
dence of a disaster Just as the princes
steamer was moving up to explain mat
ters she was nearly run down by one of
the large liners in the oriental trade
which had also left her course to render
what assistance she could
The swell was very heavy and the
prince feared a collision as the three
light like moths
therefore veered
off and the other vessels after standing
by for a few minutes went on their
way and probably never learned the
cause of that nights illumination at
sea
But the incident gave the prince a

carefully refrained there-
after from exhibiting his electric buoy

FOOLED IN A HORSE TRADE
This Animal Possessed Several Re
markable Traits
A prominent English landlord was
one day riding across a common ad
jacent to his preserves when ne over
took one of his tenants who was also
mounted After the usual salutations
they rode on in silence for some min
utes when the tenant slightly spurred
his horse a balky animal whereupon
it dropped to its knees
Whats the matter with your
horse asked his lordship The em
barrassed tenant remarked by way of
explanation that his steed always acted
that way when there was game to be
found
A moment later to the tenants sat
isfaction and surprise a frightened hare
jumped out of some bushes near by
This so impressed the landlord that
he at once drove a bargain by which he
secured the tenants barebacked beast
in exchange for his own fine mount
perfectly saddled With much agility
the tenant leaped to his new horse and
all went well until they came to a
small stream whereat the landlord s
new nag immediately balked A drive
home with the spurs brought it again
to its knees
Hello whats up now Theres no
game here said his lordship
True my lord was the ready re
ply but I forgot to tell yon ees as
good for fish as ee is for game Ran

The Audience Got Angry
There was a soene of wild excitement
during the last week of May 1892 at
the Gaiety London and all owing to
the singular behavior of a policeman
Two popular entertainers were on the
stage and one of them asked the audi
ence a little conundrum Why is a po
liceman an utter ecoundrel
A gentleman in blue who was appar
ently on duty in the body of the thea
ter at once took offense He jumped on
to the stage and seizing the offender
attempted to drag him off
The audience rose in indignation
Men shook their fists and shouted
What has he done One frenzied
young lady in the front of the gallery
seized a tumbler and would have thrown
it at the policeman if her arm had not
been arrested
The policeman then dragged his cap
tive off the stage amid the hisses and
shouts of the audience But anger was
speedily changed to laughter when Mr
Policeman reappeared with his victim
and fctood revealed as one of the Cosmo

Pigrn and Witchcraft
Two women of the lower class were
quarreling violently the other evening
in Heavitree a suburb of Exeter One
yelled to the other You wretch you
always keep a black and a white pig
so that you can witch us You ought
to be scragged The one so addressed
it seems has lived in her cottage some
20 years She has during this period it
is said always kept a couple of pigs
one of each color and her neighbors
consider she does this so that she may
enjoy the very questionable powers of
Witchcraft No butcher in the neigh

known to do so he would certainly lose

Notes and Queries
OLD DUELING ETJIES
MUCH USEFUL ADVICE FROM AN
ANCIENT BOOK
If the Combatant Dies aa a Result af
the Encounter He la Told to Go OS
With aa Good Grace aa Possible
Irishmen Not Good Seconds
To Englishmen dueling is happily a
lost art but three quarters of a century
ago dueling was sufficiently in vogue to
induce an anonymous writer to publish
a book containing much useful infor
mation ironically dedicated to Daniel
OConnell Esq M P and James Silk
Buckingham Esq M P as enter
taining the opinion first promulgated
by the immortal Falstaff of happy
memory that discretion is the better
part of valor
The author advises all my country
men who go abroad to use the pistol in
stead of the sword when they have the
choice of the weapon as the balance of
killed and wounded is now much in fa
vor of the French who upon the ter
mination of the late war amused them
selves by occasionally spitting some half
dozen of our traveling young fashion
ables before breakfast He recom
mends Purdey in Oxford street as
the maker of the best dueling pistol
locks care in the selection of a stock
whirh tits the hand comfortably and to
eschew saw handles Barrels should
be ten inches long and half rifled
which considering that throughout his
volume he poses as a man of the strict
est honor is puzzling for he admits
that a wholly rifled pistol is considered
an unfair weapon therefore one not ap
pearing to be rifled should be substi
tuted
On the chances he writes Many
a poor long armed straggling fellow
has received the coup di sic coeur or
fatal stroke who might still have been
in existence had he known how to pro
tect his person in the field the neces
sary protection consisting in standing
sideways and drawing in the stomach
Should the party be hit presumably
because he could not draw in his stom
ach he must not feel alarmed This
seems difficult as a man with a bullet
in his stomach can hardly be expected
not to display some little natural anxie
ty for as is admitted later a shot in
the digestive organs must be particu
larlv annoying to a bon vivant To
aldermen his advice is the old method
of fighting the back to the adversary
and discharging over the shoulder
The chances of a mans being killed
are about 14 to 1 and of his being
hit about 6 to 1 He arrives at
this conclusion by dividing a mans
body when opposed to his adversary
into nine parts Therefore be says As
in only three of these a wound would
prove mortal the chances are 3 to
I against his being killed and 5 to
1 against his being hit that how
ever he hastens to add provided hi
antagonist has never read my work Ii
he has the case may be different 1
The combatant is told not to allow
the idea of becoming a target to make
him uneasy but to treat the matter
jocosely He is to laugh away the
evening over a bottle of port and play
a rubber of whist but he must avoid
drinking to excess or taking any food
that tends to create bile because bil
ious objects are not seen either distinct
ly or correctly This Would rather be
a valid reason for getting as bilious as
possible A man with an attack of
jaundice should be invisible and able
I to blaze at his antagonist in perfect
safety If he cannot sleep on retiring
to rest he is to read Byrons Childe
Harold His servant is to call him at o
and give him a strong cup of coffee
i Then he is to smoke a cigar and on
his way to the scene of action he is to
take a brandy and soda as a most
grateful stimulant and corrective
No wonder our author recommend
him at this point to draw in his stom
ach If he dies he is to go off with as
good grace as possible On the other
hand if he hits his antagonist he is to
take off his hat to him and express re
j gret
A challenge is not to be in rhyme
such as a certain poetical brandy lov
ing major general of marines wrote
to a brother officer who ran off with his
wife
Wounds on the flesh a surgeons skill may
heal
But wounded honors only cured with steel
An Irishman is not to be chosen as
second for nine out of ten have such an
j innate love of fighting they cannot
bring an affair to an amicable adjust
i ment and the first duty of a second is
to prevent the affair coming to a seri
ous issue Other advice is for the sec
ond to take care his principal is not in
convenienced by the sun and to get his
antagonist with something dark behind
him when it will be much more easy
to hit him
As may be inferred the author holds
by dueling for the man who falls
in a duel and the individual who is
killed by the overturn of a stagecoach
are both unfortunate victims to a prac
tice from which we derive great ad van
tagea It would be absurd to prohibit
stage traveling because occasionally a
few lives are lost by an overturn and
unless men endeavored to destroy each
i other they might live to a patriarchal
jMBg APMMqMMVpv
age and multiply so rapidly that the
soil would soon be insufficient to sup
ply them with nourishment with
which reductio ad absurdurn the vol
ume may well be put back on the shelf
