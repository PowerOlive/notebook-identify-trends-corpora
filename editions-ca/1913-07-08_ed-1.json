THE WEATHER TO BLAME.
The Hitchcock amendment, if adopt
ed, would anake the Government a
party td the violation of the anti-trust
law, provided the trust paid enough
for the privilege. It has no place in
a programme for trust regulation when
the party is called on to deal with the
trust question. It has nothing whatso
ever to do with a tariff bill. The cau
cus majority did well to reject it
It is, of course, to be regretted that
the Senator, beca'use of its rejection,
saw fit to withdraw from the caucus,
but then the weather at Washington J
nas been so persistently and unbear
ably hot that there is really no telling
statesman. The wonder is that Hitch
what pranks it will play, even with a
cock episodes have been so few.

Brick Couldn't Feaze Him.
A negro stopped a brick at Washing
ton the other day, after It had Xallen
ten stories and was traveling with the
Telocity of a cannon ball. When the
brick hit William Moore, the negro,
on the top of the head, the brick broke
into bits. Moore sat down suddenly
and apparently was a subject for the
coroner,. Workmen sent hurriedly for
a physician, but before he arrived
Moore sat up. "Whut d'ye want to do
that for?" he demanded angrily of a
workman. Examination of Moore re
vealed that all he suffered was a
headache.
Horrible Death in Elevator Shaft.
Powerless to move, a man named
j Fulmer, employed at an abbattoir, lay
at me Dottom or an elevator shaft at
Philadelphia, Pa., the other day, and
waited the descending lift, which
crushed him to death. The man had
fallen into the shaft, and his cries
for aid were droWned by the noise
of the machinery. The man fought
desperately against the freight laden
elevator. His body was flattened al
most to the thinness of paper.

UTAH SHEEP GO FOUR
MONTHS WITHOUT WATER,
Sheep on -the Nebo National Forest,
Utah, go four and a half months with
out water except for such moisture as
they get from the dew and juices of
f oragev plants.
Grazing sheep on a range entirely
destitute of water is a recent innova
tion due to the increasing demand for
forage and the efforts of the forest
officers to find a place on the forest
ranges for all the stock that can safely
be admitted. The area on the Nebo
which has now proved usable by
sheep, is high and rocky, a portion of
it being above timber line, and it has
neither springs nor streams of suffi
cient size or accessibility to be used
for stock watering purposes. Its graz
ing season lasts from June 15 to Octo
ber 31, and uring this period of four
ber 31, and during this period of four
get a drink
Under such conditions, however, the
sheep have done extremely well, and
last year's lambs from this range, had
an average weight at the-lose of the
season of 68 pounds- on fhe Chicago
market, which was rather above the
normal weight from that vicinity.
In one area on theTarghee forest in
Idaho sheep get water only twice dur
ing the four-months7 summer grazing
season, but the sheep are driven to a
nearby stream lower down the moun
tain side. Lambs from this range
weighed 65 pounds on the Chicago
market.

May Do Good Work Unknowingly.
Chemists show us that strange prop
erty, catalysis, which enables a sub
stance while unaffected itself to incite
to union elements around it. So a
host or hostess who may know but
little of those concerned may, as a
social switchboard, bring together the
halves of pairs of scissors, men who
become lifelong friends, men and
women who marry and are happy
husbands and wives.
"Artificial Rain."
The shallow draft passenger steam
ers built by an English shipbuilding
concern for river service in the trop
ics are equipped with "artificial rain."
Up through the awning forming the
roof of the upper cabin project two
water pipes, each of which is fitted
with a spray head. These fountains
throw sprays of water over the awn
ing, and the rapid evaporation under
the hot rays of the sun keeps the
cabins cool. Popular Mechanics Mag
azine. Great Advance During Century.
A century ago astronomers, geolo
gists, chemists, physicists, each had
an island of his own, separate and
distinct from that of every other stu
dent of nature; the whole field of
research was then an archipelago of
unconnected units. Today all the
standpoints of study have risen to
gether to form a continent without
either ferry or bridge.
Putting the Matter Plainly.
He was an old-fashioned father,
which explains why he said to the
young man: "Are you sure you're
able to give my daughter the com
forts and luxuries to which she is ac
customed at home?" To which the
young man promptly replied: "As
your daughter's salary has paid the
rent and bought most of the clothes
and food for your family, I think we
can worry along."
