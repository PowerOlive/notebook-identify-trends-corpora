Cold feather
rings Catarrh
Tnongii the disagreeable effects of Ca
tarrh are felt all the year round cold and
disagreeable weather aggravates the
disease and it is during the winter sea
on that its severest form is felt Bach
jicceeding year seems to intensify the
disease so that it gradually fastens its
kold upon the sufferer with a grasp that
jitecomes firmer each season
f Catarrh often appears as only a cold at
Jfrst and is hardly noticed But gradu
ally the cold returns and it is more
difficult to cureand stays longer than f or
Kierly These symptoms cannot be mis
taken they mark the first appearance of a
disease that will develop in severity and
-stubbornness and which it is impossible
to cure with the local treatment of sprays
-washes and similar applications JBeing
4t disease of the blood only a blood
zefnedy can have the slightest effect
pon it SSS Swifts Specific is the
nly cure for Catarrh because it is the
only blood remedy which goes to the
fceat of all obstinate and deep seated
cases and forces out the disease
Mr T A Williams a leading mer
vchant of Spartanburg S C writes
li 4 mW
For four years I had nasal catarrh
and though the case was a mild one at
firstit was not long until I noticed that it
was gradually growing worse Of course
I was under treatment of first class phy
sicians but their remedies were applied
locally and the disease seemed to be get
ting a firmer hold on me all the while
After spending so much money for
treatment which proved to be all in
vain I was urged to try SSS This rem
edy proved to be the right one for it got at
the disease and a few bottles cured me
perfectly The cure was a permanent
one and I have not had a touch of the
-disease for many years Swifts Specific
is the only remedy that will have the
slighest effect upon Catarrh
Sufferers from Catarrh should get a
start on the disease before the cold
weather aggravates it Those who have
been relying upon local treatment will
jfind winter weather is all that is
needed to show that the disease is still
-with them A course of SSS Swifts
Specific will prove all assertions made
that it is the only cure for Catarrh it goes
to the cause of the trouble the blood
and forces out all traces of the disease

which reaches real obstinate blood dis
eases it cures Catarrh Rheumatism

MY PAROQUET
I had a parrot once an ugly bird
With the most wicked eye I ever saw
Who though it comprehended all it heard
Would only aay Ob pshawl
I did my best to teach it goodly lore
I talked to it of medicine and law
It looked as if it knew it all before
And simply said Oh pshaw
I sat me down upon a dry goods box
To stuff sound doctrine down its empty
craw
It would have none of matters orthodox
But yawned and said Oh pshawl
I talked to It of politics finance
I hoped to teach the bird to say Hurrah 1
For my pet candidates when hed a chance
He winked and chirped Oh pshaw
I am for prohibition warp and woof
But that bird stole hard cider through a
straw
And tipped and teetered off at my reproof
And thickly said Oh pshawl
Enraged I hurled a bootjack missed my aim
And plugged a passing stranger in the jaw
He wheeled to see from whence the missile
eame
The demon laughed Oh pshawl
I gave the creature to an old maid aunt
And shook With parting grief its aJdnoy
Hell serve to cheer she said my lonely
hearth
For Id not marry the best man on earth
Oh pehaw sneered Poll Oh pshawl
Emma Herrick Weed in New York Sun
A CONQUERING HEEO
It was snch a pretty scene The frees
had the abundance of verdant foliage
that belongs to happy June The grass
seemed more than usually rich and
green and the wild flowers more abun
dant than ever before there was a rural
bridge over a deep rushing stream that
fed a mill dam some distance beyond
and roses clambered over the broken
rails of the bridge and twined their
wild tendrils about an old tree near by
nrminKf WhirVh was ft rustic seat On the
rustic seat was another rose a very
sweet and fresh and lovely rose in white
muslin with a Marie Antoinette fichu
across her breast and knotted at the
waist and a wide leghorn hat on her
head that Bhaded her eyes so cleverly
that no beholder could guess that tears
were rising there from time to time and
dropping on the white mull kerchief
And this had happened so often that
the rose might very well be said to be
washed in dew
Her name was Kate and she was very
angry with herself because the tears
would fall despite all the indignant
things she was saying to herself in her
effort to stop their flow till at last she
started to her feet in a dreadful pet and
began to walk up and down crushing
the wild flowers under her feet But
that could not continue for she was a
very sweet little woman and could not
even hurt a flower without regretting
it and presently she bent her graceful
figure and pulled the wild anemones
and the few late violets and having
reached the rustic seat she added a rose
or two and sat down
- Its a perfectly lovely morning
she murmured and pinned the flowers
among the folds of tbe mull kerchief
I wonder where she has taken the
child because
She stopped and looked anxiously
about till she saw in the distance the
maid and the little boy rambling among
the trees and apparently absorbed in
gathering wild flowers and chasing but
terflies and the music of the childs
laughter was borne to her on the soft
perfumed summer breeze It was a
heavenly sound a sound to gladden
any mothers heart but Kate Selden
sighed and drew from her belt a closely
crumpled piece of paper which she had
thrust there in fierce impatience and as
she looked at it the tears which had
not retreated very far again rose to her
eyes
Oh Im just a dreadful fool she
thought A silly silly little simple
ton And Im glad he is late for I
wouldnt have him know for anything
in this world that I cared enough to
cry And smoothing out the crum
pled paper she began to read the writ
ten words once more though she al
ready knew them by heart
If you will see me on Wednesday
we can talk the matter over I have
spoken with my lawyer and he has
consulted with yqurs and a separation
can be arranged without any public
scandal at least I Hope so I would
call at the house but I know your
mother hates me worse than ever now
and it would only cause a scene So if
you will come to the old rustic seat
close by the- bridge you know where
we used to meet in the old happy days
ah Kate if you weuld only let me
tell you every thing you would find that
I am not so very much to blame But I
wont speak of that because of course
I know you wish to leave me and I
will make no defease Yes you shall
keep the boy though T believe the law
would give him to me if I chose to fight
for my right rna in tiiat I yield to you
entirely I believe a child belongs to
hi mother first and before all others
therefore I give him to you without
asking what the law n ieht say about
it but I do ask that you will let me see
him as often as I may wish for I love
him dear yes though you may not
believe it Kate I love him next to his
mother who is still the dearest on earth
to me There I didnt mean to say that
but it is written and let it stay so I
will not offend you again but be there
on YvVlnesday any time before noon I
Wont be later than 11 a we can ar
ranj all the business douua the law

face to face With her husoana Hraa
very pale and his lips looked pallid

their eyes met but now the color ebbed
away from her girlish face and sheid
confusedly 1
I am so glad I mean not tolkeep

You are very good he said jant
you are always good You got met

Oh yes or I wouldnt have Icnown
you were coming here She moved
backward a step and was very glato
drop into the old rustic seat Ms
very generous of you Sidney to agree
to everything and particularly about
baby M
It is all I can do now to tryjpo
please you he answered weaklynd
the perspiration was like dew onffis
brow He took off his hat and stammer
ed something about its being awfully
hot 3
Yes perhaps you have walked fuffi
It is very warm and you look tiredf
Wont you sit down She moved ai

We used to say there was just foonf
enough for two he added
amile and she turned her head away
perhaps to pluck a rose for she snapped
one off short and then threw it awayf h i
Am I to see baby today he asked
after a few minutes of awkward silencet
I haven t seen him you know sincearr
Oh yes she answered hurriedly
and looking a bout There they arene 3
and Annette yonder m the woods They
are coming this way Oh Sidney she
cried suddenly turning toward
how could youi 1 can
forgive you
him
never never
I could never dare to ask you XV
They were a4most the very wordslpf
Pauline and Claud She remembered
a moment that it had been the first play
Sidney had taken her to see after they
bad married and how often they had
laughed at that pair of lovers each
dying to forgive and be forgiven and
neither daring to say the right word
She used to think she could never be so
foolish as that and now it was get
ting very awkward for this was a far
more serious matter and she knew that
she could never never forgive What
woman could f
And then she heard the laughter and
shouts of little Sidney who had just
caught sight of his father and was how
running wildly to welcome him It was
a fortunate interruption to a scene tliat
was nearing a painful climax and she
was very glad to take a step or two to
ward the laughing boy who was al
ready flying across the bridge followed
by his nurse then there was a crash a
shriek The side of the bridge was gap
ing outward The maid stood wringing
her hands The golden curls that Baftf
floated a moment above the rushing
water were gone
It was so sudden so inexplicableV
that the frantic mother could not real
ize at first wbafhad happened rs3Vnn
she did the air resounded with herag
onized cries and it was the nursegifl
who was the first to see that Selden had
already reached his child just in time
Courage maam couragel the girl
whispered while she supported her
mistress See he is saferl His father
has him Look look 1 The darling has
his arms about the masters neck and
heshuggkig and kissing of him just as
if nothing had happened at alll r
The girl assisted her mistress back to
the little rustic seat and when the
father and child had reached the young
mother little Sidney was already laugh
ing with delight and as he put one
dripping arm about her neck he drew
her close till her face touched herhus
bands face
Kate whispered Selden Kate
may I beg forgiveness now
Oh Sidney I have been so proud
and heartless I was jealous and vaih
and and so selfish and unfair I
wouldnt listen to you and all the mme
I knew you never cared for that woman 1
Can you forgive me too
Just give me a chance thats all
And then two pairs of arms met and
clasped each other close about thecon
quering hero who seemed to find him
self quite suddenly an object of second
ary importance
It then occurred to Annette that Mas
ter Sidney would have a dreadful cold
unless his dripping gjirments were
changed immediately so she carried
him off in pursuit of dry clothing
