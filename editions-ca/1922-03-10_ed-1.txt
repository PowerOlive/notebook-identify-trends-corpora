Two hundred of thecountry's leading educators, it issaid, are back of the movement,which it is expected, will requireseveral yearB years to push to conclusion. Officials of the Bureau of Education express the hope that such Statelaws, when passed, will not requireany special form of study of the Constitution, and point out that the"practice of some schools wuivg SOn"teach it, of requiring scholars tolearn it by heartf is apt to do moreharm than good. They say, i&St itis the meaning, not tne wording,which is important, and that it is theduty of the Supreme Court, not theindividual, to interpret the phraseology. If the average student is required to study it from the standpoint of understanding its principles he will, they point out, be muchmore likely to use his knowledgethan if required merely to learn itword by w.ord.We will be back to normal whenthey quit selling five-cent cigars forten cents.o-Another grievance against capitalis that it is hard to get hold of.?FASHION nF.PRF.FS RT APK" nPPCQFQOmr Dyeing Deparbaentla tk buds of a most expert dyer, offers you an oppor- Itsaky t sare money.

Clarke, of theUnited States Supreme Court, said ina speech recently that the; Eighteenth Amendment had placed-anunprecedented strain upon all thecountry laws. "The EighteenthAmendment," he declared, "requiredmillions of men and women to giveup habits and customs of life whichthey thought not to be wrong, but-which, on the contrary, they thoughtto be necessary to their comfort andhappiness, and therefore, as we allnow see, respect not only for thatJaw, but for all law, has been put toan unprecedented and demoralizing,strain."Does any intelligent person doubtthis? It is not possible for humanbeings, no matter how strongly developed their respect for authority,to see more than half the communityin sympathy with technical lawbreaking, without themselves losingreverence for law.The American people are as awhole coming to the conclusion thatprohibition is impossible of enforcement, and we believe the Americanpeople will, sooner or later, relievethemselves of a Constitutionalamendment that already has becomea scandal.
