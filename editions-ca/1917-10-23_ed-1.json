"To All Federal Food Administra
tors: "A statement has appeared in Chi
cago papers, that the United States
Food Administration has the inten
tion of reducing the hog price to
$10.00. This statement is absolutely
untrue, and has caused a flood of in
quiries to which the following is a
sample of our reply:
"Chicago advices absolutely untrue
and do not represent opinion or pro
posed action of the Food Administra
tion, which will take no steps to
jeopardize live stock producers' inter
ests. All our power will be used tbv
keep prices at which allied and gov
ernmental purchases are made, on a
plane that gives an assured return. of
cost and profit to producers of meat
animals. In our opinion the best
market obtainable for the present
corn crop of the country will be
through live stock. We need in
creased production of beef and pork
and the Only way to secure this in
crease will be .!)y a profit on produc
