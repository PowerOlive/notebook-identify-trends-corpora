A Shattered Nervous System
FINALLY HEART TROUBLE
Restored to Health by Dr Miles Nervine
rp
sJv
EDWARD HARDY the jolly man
ager of Sheppard Cos great store at
Braceville 111 writes I had never
been sick a day in my life until in 1890 I
got so bad with nervous prostration that I
had to give up and commence to doctor I
tried our local physicians and one in Soliet
but none gave me any relief and I thought
I was going to die I became despondent
and suffered untold agony I could not eat
sleep nor rest a nd it seemed as if I could
not exist At the end of six months I was
reduced to but a shadow of myself and at
last my heart became affected and I was
truly miserable I took six or eight bottles
of Dr Miles Nervine It gave me relief
from the start and at last a cure the great
est blessing of my life

THE BOURBON NEWS
THE LETTER
I have existed but a few hours I was
bom this morning on thb red velvet lid of
an ebony writing desk A woman wrote
me into existence and as I grew under a
fine gold pen I first perceived the tips of
slender white lingers whoso regular sway
back and forth gave me a delicious sensa
tion Then I distinguished the face bent
above me a pretty face pale and sad with
great gray eyes under which were black
circles rosy wet eyelids but white lips
Her hair fell in disorder over her forehead
curling behind her ears down to her shoul
ders My first lines in a slanting English
handwriting were to this effect
Had passed a miserable night impossi
ble to sleep strange dream and awoke
trembling pity and mercy asked in the
same line Then the ball of the night be
fore was spoken of She had been very
unhappy and had left full of presentiment
although ho was there Why was this
Sho leaned on the desk her head on her
hand and fell into a reverie Her sleovo
fell back and I felt the perfume of her
warm soft arm penetrato me Sho re
mained thus some time hor beautiful
largo eyes full of sad thought Suddenly
twqt tears gathered and I began to under
stand the sense of the words Why was
this The tears trembled on her eyelids
then ran down her cheek The poor little
woman sighed and returned to me
Ho had been very neglectful at the ball
and sho had caught his eye only once or
twice The pen began to write rapidly
the words wero scratched off sentences
followed each other without punctuation
a passionato love filled my pages in a
retrospective glanco The transport of
the first days doubts timidity the
avowal first kisses Then the day when
jealousy was awakened so terrible yet so
charming terror agony if ten minutes
late the promise of eternal fidelity re
newed vows all this as the eyes rained
tears and the pen went on impetuously
tightly held in the thin fingers
My four pages were full when some one
entered the room I disappeared quickly
inside the desk I fell among a pile of let
ters faded flowers and debris of all sorts
In ono corner lay a white cravat twisted
around a little white bouquet It was of
corded muslin and made mo suddenly
think of a certain date of which I speak
later
When I was taken out of hiding the
young woman was dressed ready to go out
with a thick veil covering her red lidded
eyes Sho added two words Como to-night
and then I waited impatiently for
a namo that I expected to seo when I felt
two fresh warm lips pressed bo1 passion
ately against mo that the paper crackled
Then a flower was slipped between my
leaves and I was shut up in an envelope
and addressed and the ah I cannot say
for sne what happened My impressions
are vague I was put in a pocknfc later
where found a little handkerchief damp
with tears I had spti wiped avay
We wero together until nce more T was
brought forth but to fall into a vilo box
whero I rSmained all alone It had an
I opening on top from which I could Bee
i people passing to ana iro j was Kepi ne
j a long time and thought 1 should never
get out again when thump a heavy masfr
fell upon me then another and still an
other I was nearly stifled under the load
hideous yellcw envelope fell on my side
os if to wrush rce out of existence Per
haps ic contained some villainous news
sonic hypocritical lie some message of
evil and I yet palpitating froio the fine
English handwriting en my pagar had to
bo mixed up withall this
z key clicked Kthe lock cric crack
in enormous red liaixi plunged mto the
box arnd taking pffeket disappeared j
and earue again Ewica I slipped between
his bigfingers I was1 too delicate for such
handling but I vas- setzed at asrtl
crumnledi tin in a bundle tied with striil
Then E was carried along- till wo were sur
rounded Tsy voices scratching of peosy au
I was seized anew bva hand that pressed
something dreadful upora mo I received
two diro strokes right ovesrtho poox little
dower between my pages
Whemlcamo to myself again I found
myself on a chimney piece the room filled
with shadows of the dying iTav At Bingth
after a long wait my envelope was torih fc
open and I was glanced over rapidly by jj
two superb but icy cold- bin eyes sodry
and hard that they gave me a shock i
Only my first lines wero read ETe i
seemed to divino the restr and
threw meioughly on the cMrnney piece fe
again the flower fell uraheeded to tho floor
I saw it nomore Tho one who rejected
me so unkindly was very handsome
man talland well made with curly blbncL
hair and long carefully trimmed baard
He was elegantly dressed and his bands
were white- and delicate
As I lay in an uncomfortablo position
close to a chandelier the- man evidently
forgetful of my existence dovoted his at-
this very moment my dearfriend whosent
mo forth this morning waswonderinghow
I was being received Oh if I couldlonly
efTace all that sho had confided ta mel
Ho reread mo however after a tim jmd
little by little memory awakened iiziturn
over tho history contained therein bat his
expression remained hard and cold Re
proaches tears heartthrobs all were un
availing I heard him murmur as he
paced upand down the room If Hgoy
thero will be more tears and what to be
done It is not my fault that I db not
lovo her any longer I am decided 1
cannot go -tonight i will write and tell
her so twill say and ho wrote
What a differenceover this morning
when Zsaw a sweet womans face bending
over me feverish with emotion caused by
thoughts of him anthis man seated be
fore a table searching his brain forphrases
to fit but tho words would not como any
mor easily than tho ideas HQjtoxoup

I tell you all thisfrom the bo ttoni of a
drawerwhero I am lying Thero aro let

A SINGULAR DEED
If was supposed that Captain Faulkiner
nad married Honor Beaumont for her
money I had kndwn Faulkiner for some
years and I am bound to say I had very
little to urge in his defense He had never
been actually caught in any nefarious
proceeuingbut it was known that ho had
run through most of his friends that he
was wonderfully lucky at faro and that ho
was anxiously looking out for an heiress
The wedding duly took place and about
four months afterward Captain and Mrs
Faulkiner wero back in town apparently
tho happiest couple to bo found in all Bcl
gravia
As for Faulkiner he seemed completely
changed There was a manliness about
him that one never noticed before II is
eyes wore a frank expression that was
truly refreshing to see He was clearly
devoted to his wife nd they seemed to
perfectly understand and trust each other
What could it mean-
Gradually I got to really like Faulkiner
He mado a splendid host was a pattern of
tho domestic virtues and impressed one as
being the soul of honor Our acquaintance
finally ripened into a close friendship
One evening he expounded tho mystery
Shall I tell you the story of my court
ship Jack he asked
As you will my dear fellow I rc
pliod if it isnt too sacred a subject for a
third party
Thats just it It is a sacred subject
as you will see
Ho lit a cigar and proceeded
All that tho world thought and said of
me before I was married was truo and
more than true I was a regular bad lot
and it is true also that in proposing to
Miss Beaumont I was actuated by tho most
mercenary motives and those alone
All that I wanted was heriipney her
money Jack Do you hear The world
said so and the world was perfectly right
I had plans as to what I would do with it
My chief anxiety was to her get
ting any inkling of the truth and so I
never ceased to dance constant attendance
on her and especially to withdraw her as
far as possible from her lady friends All
went well until one evening at the Villiers
ball she took me on one side saying
Fritz she always called mo Fritz
rather than Frank Iwant to speak to
you
What is it darling
You are not to call mo darling aity
rcoro till this matter in cleared up
What matter dear
Just this- Peoplo aro saying that you
are- marrying me merely far my money
Is that so
Of cours not I love yau for your
self
Stop stop lam going voput you
to the- proof You know my solicitors
Messrs Bicey iri Lincolns
km
Yea
Well- meet me there tomorrow at
nMtott shajqp And now good night
wn a moment she was gone 1 passed
a sopless uight and with great difficulty
nerved myssrJf in the morning to ieep the
mysterious appointment
Gild Dicey I call him that beoause ho
is now ono of my dearest friends Ksceived
mo coldly
Iliave been favored Captain FarnIk
iner fto said with some very extraordi
nary instructions from my client your
fiancee Miss Beaumont I must entirely
disclaim ail responsibility in the matter
II have simply gaven effect to Miss
and the final issue of them
laust rest entirely with yourself B you
please we will go to tho adjoining room
where Miss Bcauraont awaits us
We fomid her seated near a winsSow
Sho did notrisci Scut simply bowed and I
saw that Iter face was pale and that ic
wore an expression of enforced calm
Fritz F told you last night thafpeo
plo aro saying you aro marrying me mere
ly for my money It matters little to me
mow whether they speak truth or hot If
they do then whether or not you become
my husband is the- light gone out of my
life indeed You know Fritz how I love
you If you have done this cruel thing
nothing- can undo it now If you have
designed to beggar mc under tho pretext
of affection fortune or no fortune hus
band or no husband can make no differr
euce to me But it shall nover be said
that you actually did marry mo for- my
money and so Fritz I have asked Mr
Dicey to draw up a deed which which
and here the- poor darling broke down
completely and could say no more
The deed Captain Faulkiner said
Mr Dicey with frigid solemnity is- an
uncommon one I know indeed ofi no
precedent But it recites that in consid
eration of Captain Francis Arthur Faulki
Tier of the Second Life guards releasing
Miss Honor Beaumont of Hurstfield
House Hertfordshire from her engage
ment to marry him the said Miss Honor
Beaumont herewith makes over to the
tention tc tying a white cravat tho mate- f 6am captain Francis Artnur tfaiumner
nf tho mifi in tiin flnei v nnd nr rim- o t -all her real and personal nronertv as
v VHV 4VUI1W44M JW UWUWU t U 1
scheduled herewith save and except tho
residence known as The Grove Isleworth
in tho csunty of Middlesex and as much
of her Midland railway debenture stock as
will suffice to provide an annuity of 1500
a year
I turned half mechanically to Honor
She was atill calm and pale but Ber eyes
were brimful of tears
It is impossible I exclaimed and
just at that moment something seemed to
struggle within me for out of the depths
of my sinful heart thero came welling tho
tiny fsable remnant of tho littlbgood it
ever hold
I fait as if I could give not only love but
life to- that noble woman who had proposed
to herself this mad this fearful sacrifice
in order to put to proof the sincerity of the
mansho loved Disregarding thepresence
of thsman of law I clasped her in my
arms and we yes Jack v wept to
gether
treasure now that sacred parchmeat
wbich awakened to new life tho little good
that was left in me which aroused the
dfeadened sense of unselfish love and gave
meriches greater far than my villainy had
ever dreamed of Do you wonder Jtck
that I am a changed man London
