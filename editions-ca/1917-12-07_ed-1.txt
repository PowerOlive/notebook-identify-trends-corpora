Calmly, but withhis usual unassailable logic, he urged an immediate declaration of waron Austria-Hungary.- In moving words that broughtcheers from the diacinguished gathering which listened to him, hebranded the dual monarchy as avassal of Germany and as such anenemy to the United States. -The President added that the samelogic would lead also to a decaration against Bulgaria and Turkey.They also are tools of Germany."But," he continued, "they aremere tools, and do not yet stand inthe direct path of our necessaryaction."President Wilson's utterances weregreeted with' tremendous applauseand cheering from the floor of theHouse and from the galleries. Ambassadors, members of the SupremeCourt, members of the Cabinet andthe crowded rows of citizens expressed their hearty approval.President Wilson asked for Immediate action. He got it.

Paris'is, indeed, beautiful for situation. Nature seems' toSlave done her utmost in creating a"35ne site for a city of genuine worthsnd enduring progress. It wouldIiiis seem that Nature must havedesignated this- particular spot fors. noble and high-minded class of-citizens. Nature, in' this respect-feas evidently met with a genuineresponse. Every town or city has-sn individuality, a type of its own,and thus attracts citizens of theSjeneral -characteristics to a greatctent at least, we think this isriie.The people here are observed toe thoughtful, kind, sympathetic andhelpful to one another. And, as the-Postum man is wont to ;ay, "There'st, Teason." This is pre-eminently atity of homes. The very atmosphereo things imparts to one a restfulfeeling, a thoughtful spirit, and all"5s concerned in the development andgrowth of the higher ideals.In speaking of Paris as a city of3iomes, however, we do not meanto say that it is not also a place ofsubstantial business interests. By:no means!All the various kinds of businessaire not only well represented byxaaen of good ability, but those who'possess the spirit -of genuine projpcess. The places of business are,or the most part, well arranged,aeatly kept and managed with a"promptness and courtesy towards'-customers that compare favorably"with many cities of much larger, size. We wish the people of ParisI -would all get interested in Paris-3nd stand by it. If a rich manstarts a project, encourage it; if aroor man, help him. Don't be afraidto stick your hand in your pocket.1 you have means, invest in some-ilMng that will give employment tosomebody.Do not kick on every proposedimprovement simply because it is nott your own door. Do all you canto beautify Paris and your propertyalso. 'Be friendly to everybody and".courteous to strangers, and neverTorget that you are a part of the.xown and that your own deportmentdoes its share in giving the town itscharacter. Sell and buy all you canat home. Stand by all other enterprising citizens and be ready to3o some of the work yourself; anddont grumble or spend your time inprophesying failures.p-i 1r-i -J5AKP TAYLOR MEN WILL GETTT- FURLOUGHS.

Clement, of Washington,D. C, Superintendent of the Townand Country Nursing Service of theAmerican Red Cross.Miss Clement states that a visiting nurse had worked with greatsuccess in a mining town in the"West, when suddenly she was infomed' that her services would nolonger be required.She discovered that at a meetinga majority of the town board hadvoted to withdraw financial support.She was mystified by this action,until she came to inquire who hadcast their votes against her andwhat their reasons were for doingso.One of the majority voters was. anundertaker who stated in meetingthat'since the arrival of the nursehis 'business in babies' funerals' hadfallen off so that he was doing practically nothing in this line. Anotherowned an unsanitary barn next tothe school house. The barn hadbeen torn down after the nurse, explained the danger to the community. The third owned propertywhich was not connected with thesewage system, but which the lawrequired should be connected. ' Thenurse was striving, with the supportof the town to enforce the law.It pays to support a nurse whohelps to put the undertaker out ofbusiness.
