There are many such inParis, and the purpose of the Community celebration is to enable theseunfortunates to be remembered onthis day when others are beingmade happy. "Even as ye do it untoone of these so ye do it unto me,"were the words of the Master.Those generously-inclined areasked to contribute gifts suitablefor children, to be placed on the treeChristmas Eve.

The sajme sentiment was expressed by growersof Fayette county, who were askedwhether they would jplant as muchnext year as they did this season.Some replied that it "depends on theprice paid for tobacco this year," butthe general tenor of the replies wasthat the acreage would be considerably reduced, regardless of pricesthis yeai, and several growers saidhey would get out of the businessaltcgpther if they rould do so ardhold their tenants.From Clark and Bourbon countiesonly general reports were received,but they were along the same lineas the reports from other counties,showing heavy loss m weight anudetermination on part of growersgenerally, both landlords and tenants, to reduce their acreage nextyear to a point at which it can behandled without the employment ofexpensive outside laboi to care forthe crop and prepare it for market.THE CHRISTMAS STORE.A wonderful display of Christmas Goods is being shown at ourstore.
