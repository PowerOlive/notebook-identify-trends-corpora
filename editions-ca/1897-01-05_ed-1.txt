isthe provincial assembly of which thereis only one in Porto Rico but one foreach of the six provinces of Cuba Thefunctions of the provincial assemblyare largely united with those of theproposed council of administration inthe case of Porto Rico because there isbut one body The council oftration will be an independent body inCuba and will for the first time givethe Cubans a large share of controlover their internal domestic concernsThe home government will retain control of the laws levying taxation andwill reserve the right to renew thebudget of appropriations but the appropriations will be made by the council of administration subject to theappproval of the ministry atMadrid The Spanish government does not propose at present to widen the limits of thesuffrage which extends to

Chicago Inter OceanTHIoftheWSftMineor A Woman J J Intervenes0CHAPTER XVI ContinuedOn Monday morning- as lie came in bvtrain liis eye caught a flaming- posteron one of the bill boards at the stationIt was headed Financial Field and thenext line in heavy black letters wasThe Iica Mining Swindle Kenyoncalled a newsboy to him and bought acopy of the paper There in leadedtype was the article before him Itseemed somehow mnch more important on the printed page than it hadlooked on the proofAs he read it he noticed an air oftruthful sincerity about the articlethat had escaped him during the briefglance he had given it on Friday Itwent on to say that the Austrian Mining company had sunk a good deal ofmoney in the mine and that it hadnever paid a penny of dividends thatthey merely kept on the mine at a constant loss to themselves in the hope ofbeing able to swindle some coninvestors but that even their dfgL were as nothing compared to thets srTi riLT xzaceu aempu vt swiiimingplated by John Kenyon HelUgllfrme inprint It was a shock for which he wasnot prepared as he had not noticed itin the proof Then he read on Itseemed that this man Xenjon had secured the mine at something like 10000 and was trying to shove it off onthe unfortunate British public at theenorinous increase of 200000 but thisnefarious attempt would doubtless befrustrated so long as there were papersof the integrity of the Financial Fieldthat took the risk and expense of making such an exposure as was here setforthThe article possessed a singular fascination for Kenyon He read and reread it in a dazed way as if the statement referred to some other personand he could not help feeling sorry forthat personHe still had the paper in his hand ashe walked up the street and he feltnumbed and dazed as if some one hadstruck him a blow He was nearly runover in crossing one of the thoroughfares and heard an outburst of profanity directed at him from a cabdriver and a man on a bus but heheeded them not walking through thecrowd like one under a spellHe passed the door of his own gorgeous office and walked a considerabledistance up the street before he realized what he had done Then he turnedhack again and just at the doorsteppaused with a pang- at his heartI wonder if Edith Longworth willread that article he said to himselfCHAPTER XVHWhen John Kenyon enterd his officeit seemed to him that his clerk lookedat him askance He imagined thatinnocent gentleman had been readingthe article in the Financial Field busthe truth is John was hardly in a frameof mind to form a correct opinion onwhat other people had been doingEverybody he met in tne street itseemed to him was discussing thearticle in the Financial FieldHe asked if anybody had been in thatmorning and was told that there hadbeen no callers Then he passed intoclosed the door behindthe directors roomhind him sat down on a chair andhands with Insleaned his head on hiselbows on the table In this positionWentworth found him some time later-and when John looked up his face washaggard and agodAh I see you have read 11YesLongworth is at theDo you thinkbottom of that articleJohn shook his head lwhatever to dosaid he had nothing1 - How do you knowexactly what hadKenyon related- passed between the oily young man ofVI theFinancial Field and hiinsdf lhati j while tliisjecital was go-SL expressing ii opinio now andthen in remarks that

the paper for libelWhat good will that doWhat good will it do Do youmean to say that you intend to sit hereunder such an imputation as they havecast upon you and do nothing Whatgood will it do It will do all the goodin the worldWe cannot form our company andsue the paper at the same tirne Allour energies will have to be directedtoward the matter we have in handBut my dear John dont you seethe effect ofrthat article How can weform our company if such a lie remainsunchallenged Nobody will look atour proposals Every one will sayWhat have you done about the articlethat appeared in the Financial FieldIf we say we have done nothing thenof course the natural inference is thatwe are a pair of swindlers and that ourscheme is a fraudI have always thought said Johnthat the capitalization is too highReally I believe you think that article is not so unfair after all JohnI am astonished at youBut if we commence a- libel suit itcannot be finished before our optionhas expired If we tell the people thatwe have begun to sue the FinancialField fov libel they will merely saythey prefer to wait and hear what theresult of the case is By that time ourchances of forming a company will begoneBefore John could reply there was aknock at the door and the clerk enteredwith a letter in his hand which had justcome in Kenyon tore it open iead itand then tossed it across the tabkj toWentworth Wentworth saw the nameof their firm of solicitors at the top ofthe letter xiaper Then he readDear Sir You have doubtless the article in the Financial Field of this morning referring to the Canadian Mica Miningcompany We should he pleased to knowwhat action you intend to take in the matter We may say that in justice to ourreputation we can no longer represent yourcompany unless a suit is brought againstthe paper which contains the articleYours truly W HawkWentworth laughed with a certainbitterness Well he said if it hascome to such a pass that Hawk fearsfor his reputation the sooner we begina libel suit against the paper the betterPerhaps said John with a look ofagony on his face you will tell mewhere the monev is to come from Themoment we get into the law courtsmoney will simply have to flow likewater and doubtless the Field hasplenty of it It will add to their reputation and they will make a boast thatthey are lighting the battle of the investor in London Everything is gristthat comes to their mill Meanwhilewe shall be pajring out money or weshall be at a tremendous disadvantageand the result of it all will probably bea disagreement of the jury and practically ruin us You see I have no witnessesYes but what about the mineHow can we go on without vindicatingourselves -Before anything further could besaid young Mr Longworth came inlooking as cool calm and unruffled asif there were no such things in theworld as financial newspapersDiscussing it I see were his firstwordsYes said Wentworth 1 am veryglad you have come We have a littledifference of opinion in the matter ofthat article Kenyon here is averse tosuing that paper for libel I am infavor of prosecuting it Now what doyou sayMy dear fellow replied LongworthI am delighted to be able to agree withMr Kenyon for once Sue them IWhy certainly not That is just whatthey wantBut said Wentworth if we do notwho is going to look at our mineExactly the same number ofpie as would look at it before the articleappearedDont you think it will have any effectNot the slightestButlookatthis letter from your ownlawyers on the subject Wentworthhanded Longworth the letter fromnawk Longworth adjusted his glassand read it carefully throughBy Jove he said with a laugh Icall that distinctly good I had no ideaold Hawk was such a humorist Hisreputation indeed well that beatsme All that Hawk wants is anothersuit on his hands I wish you would letme keep this letter I will have somefun with m3 friend Hawk over itYou are welcome to the letter so1far as I am concerned said Wentworth but do you mean to say MrLongworth that we have to sit herecalmly under this imputation and donothingI mean to nothing of the kindbut I dont propose to play into theirhands by suing them at least I shouldnot if it were my case instead of KenyonsWhat would you doI would let them sue me if theywanted to do so Of course their canvasser called to see you didnt he Kenyon -Yes he didHe told you that he had a certainamount of space to sell for ascertainsum in cashYesAnd if you did not buy that spacethis certain article would appearwhereas if you did an article of quitea different complexion would beprintedYou seem to know all about it saidKenyon suspiciouslyOf course I do my dear boy Everybody knows all about it Thats the waythose papers make their money I thinkmyself as a general rille it is cheaper tobuy them uncle alwaysoff I believe myways does that wherThe has anythingspecial on hand and doesnt wanfebe hothcred with mi tside Issues Btftwe havent done so in this instanceana this is the resuM It can dbWmMmi If ins9itit-it-All that vou have to do is to pay hisprice and therewill be an equallylengthy article saying that from outside informationreceived with regardto the CanadianMining company heregrets very much thatarticle was an entire mistake and thatthere is no moresecure investment inEngland than this particular mine Butnow when he has come out with his editorial I think it isnt worth while tohave any further dealings with himAnything he can say now will notmatter- He has done all the harm hecan But I would at once put the bootSf ther foot I would write downall thecircumstances just as they happenedgive the name of the younrman who called upon you tell exactly the price he demanded for his silence and I will have that printed inan opposition paper to morrow Then- TS1 b OUr friend be FinancialField s turn tosquirm He will sayit is all a lie of course but nobody willbelieve him and we can tell him fromthe opposition paper that if it is a 12he is perfectly at liberty to sue us f orlibel Let him begin the suit if hewants to do so Let him defend his reputation Sue him for libel I know agame worth two of that Could youget out the statement before the meeting to nightKenyon who had been looking forthe first time in his life gratefully atLongworth said he couldVery well just set it down in yourown words as plainly as possible andgive date hour and full particularsSign your name to it and I will take itwhen I come to the meeting this afternoon It would not be a bad plan toread it to those who are here Thereis nothing like fighting the devihwitlifire Fight a paper with another paperNothing hew I supposeNo said Kenyon nothing newexcept what we are discussingWell dont let that trouble ycuBo as I say and we will begin an interesting controversy People like a fightand it will attract attention to themine Good by I shalL see you thisafternoon And with that he wasgone leaving both Kenyon and Wentworth in a much happier frame of mindthan that in which he had found themI say Kenyon said Wentworththat fellow is a trump His adyice hascleared the air wonderfully I believehis plan is the best after all and asyou saj we have no money for- an expensive lawsuit I will leave -you nowto get on with your work and will beback at three oclockAt that hour John had his statementconcluded The first man in was Longworth who read it with approval merely suggesting a change here and therewhich was duly made Then he put thecommunication into an envelope andNI -would let them sue ma if they wanted tosent it to the editor of the oppositionpaper Wentworth came in next thenMelville then Mr King After thisthey all adjourned to the directorsroom and in a few minutes the otherswere presentNow said Longworth an we areall here I do not see any necessit3r fordelay You have probably read thearticle that appeared in this morningsFinancial Field Mr Kenyon has written a statement in relation to that whichgives the full particulars of the insideof a very disreputable piece of businessIt was merely an attempt at blackmailing which failed I intended tohave had the statement read to youbut we thought it best to get it olf agquickly as possible and it will appearto morrow in the Financial Eaglewhere T hope you will read it NowMr Kenyon perhaps you will tell ussomething about the mineKenyon like many men of worth andnot of -words was a very poor speakerHe seemed confused and was often a little obscure in his remarksbut he waslistened to with great attention by thosepresent He was helped here and thereby a judicious question from youngLongworth and when he sa down theimpression was not so bad as mighthave been expected After a momentssilence it was Mr King who spokeAs I take it he said all we wishto know is this Is the mine what itis represented to be Is the mineralthe best for the use Mr Kenyon has indicated Is there a sufficient quantity of that mineral in the mountain hespeaks of to make it worth while toorganize this company It seems tome that this can only be answered bysome practical man going out thereand seeing the mine for himself MrMelville is I understand a practicalman If he has the time to spare Iwould propose that he should go toAmerica see this mine and reportAnother person asked when the optionon the the mine ran out This -wasanswered by young Longworth whosaid that -the person who went berand reported on the mine could cablethe word right or wrong thentherewpuld be tinie to actin LoncTpnin gettingup the lYst of subscribersI suppose said another that in jfK of dflnv hvpp wrmlrl Vif trnnMfl I-a-i5fe-Jin renewing the optiort for a month- oi-twoTo this Kenyon replied that he didnot know The owners might put ihigher price on the property or themine might be producing more micathan it had been heretofore and theyperhaps might not be inclined to sellHe thought that things should be arranged so that there would be no necessity of asking for an extensionof the option and to this they allagreedMelville then said he had no objection to taking a trip to Canada It wasmerely a question of the amount ofthe mineral in sight and he thought hecould determine that as well as anybody else And so the matter was aboutto be settled when young Longworthrose and said that he was perfectlywilling to go to Canada himself incompany with Mr Melville and thathe would pay all his own expenses andgive them the benefit of his opinion aswell This was received with applauseand the meeting terminated Longworth shook hands with Kenyon andWentworthWe will sail by the first steamerhe said and as I may not see youagain you might write me a letter ofintroduction to Mr Von Brent and tellhim that I am acting for you in thisaffair That will make matters smoothin getting the extension of the optionif

comingaround to day to dig up the floor and findit He actually believed me and I haveno doubt has been all day hiding thepaltry shekels iii some new placeThe girls attention was at that mov xnent engaged by a burro sleepily f alliDg over the high banks of the Galisteoriver and she did notlook into the shabby room How many times afterwardshe wished she hadIn a few minutes langford Afras at

reached a shady placeunder the very droppings of the greatpulpit I dont mind it in a cool retreat like this with plenty qf room torstretch myself and 3red Langfordpushed his hat back from his foreheadin a boyish way and felt for his handkerchief There another handkerchief gone If lose one I lose 50 a year7ut say go on with your little preach1 rather like to hear youA dark low browed Mexican ac-quaintance stopped in the grateful shadejust thenShe says I committed a murder backthere on old Sandoval Garcia and shestrying to make me sorry for it Langford said lightly in SpanishWhats that the Mexican askedin surpriseOh she says I am a murderer oneof your throat cutters you know ButI didnt dig up the old mans money- 1 left that for you and he laughed atthe wondering gleam in the mans blackeyes as he passed onWhat makes you talk so Kater Markley asked Can you never beserious Now -that Mexican half believes what you saidWhats the odds if he does SayIvate do you believe in everlasting punishment or just the many stripes ofretribution we get here below heasked turning the subject with a sudden characteristictwistSo the conversation passed on in apleasant summer talk sense and nonsense delightfully mixedThe next morning the village was wildwith excitement for poor old SandovalI AM A JAIL BIRD NOWwas found murdered in his bed and oncircumstantial evidence Langford wasarrested for the crimeCircumstantial evidence exclaimedJvate Markley in indignation andWhat evidence can there3qssibly be against such as henvvnn irlv there not only canbe but there is much was her informants reply- In the first placethere was an altercation between thetwo during the day and afterwardsSandoval went so far as to express fearof the young man Besides this Langfords knife covered with blood was-found in the death chamber his pockethandkerchief actually among thevclcthes of the disordered bed IBut that can all be explained returned the girl He was just playinga joke on the old fellow 1A sorry joke indeed Langfordjokes generally do not require explanation but I hope he will be ready with usubstantial one this time and thespeaker passed on leaving Kate alonewith this dreadful intelligenceAnd she had no alternative but tosuffer She could not go to the miserable young man though no one in theworld loved him so well And he as thenetwork of evidence closed around himdrew himself up austerely within hissuffering self In reply to a sad littlenote of sympathy he refused Kate thesimple comfort of helping him bear histrouble because forsooth he woulddisgrace her forgetting foolish manthat womans love is his manna in thewildernessThe poor girl had nothing left to dobut to dread the future and brood overthe past that beautiful Sunday morning sweet with rosemary but she remembered too the poisonous jimpsonsthey gathered and all the chaffing talkcame back to her like mocking spiritsto increase her anxiety Herness ana aiscomnxure were eumjjieiewhen she was subpoenaed as a witnessfor the prosecutionAh me in the presence of that Mexican jury all those innocent words thereckless fun were like stones aroundLangfo rds neck and the penitentiary-if nothing worse yawned before himKate had not seen him since his arrest and now as she looked into hispale face into his sad dark eyes so different from the merry ones she hadparted with she could have cried outat the change One moment he gazedlong and earnestly in her face then heturned resolutely away and fromthence forward seemed oblivious of herpresenceThe girl was recalled to herself thecurious crowd in the room and all themiserable circumstances by a questionfrom the prosecuting attorneyYou saw the defendant enter the deceaseds house on the day of his deathYes but it was just for funWas the deceased at homeOh no well why I dont thinksoDid the defendant say he was notNo but why I know he wasntthoughHow did defendant seem when hecame outWhy just warm from running tocatch up with meRather excited red in the face perhapsYes for it was very warmWhat did he sayOnly that he had put a cactus in thiold mans bed Thats just how he losthis handkerchief there you seeBut the lawyer did not exactly seeand he continuedWhat did defendant sav to the Mexican Garcia in your presence aboutmurdering the man SandovalAs that question was put to Kate ittsuddenly started a clew in her mindas a flash of lightning sometimes reveals a person at your window in thedarkest midnight For a moment theflash of thought blinded her and shecould not answer even stammered andmade so bad a matter of it when shedid that the poor defendant represseda groan Her thoughts were all thetime intensely taken up with this newidea even when she heard this youngman sentenced to the penitentiary tenyears for manslaughterNo one pretended to believe that Lang-ford deliberately planned the murderonly that it came about from a practical joke to a quarrel thus the sentenceKate saw Langford a moment in thehall as the sheriff was taking him awayand so crushed and- miserable he wasthat her heart nearly broke at the sightof him With her eyes streaming withtears she ran to his side and clasped oneof his cold hands in her hot ones Buteen then he would not allow his misfortune to compromise her Puttingher gently aside he said in tones toolow for anyone else to hearPlease pass on I cannot allow thisKate I am a jailbird now Good byThe next moment a massive door hadclosed between them Never to meetagain The grief -stricken girl couldhave fallen where she stood at the realization of it all Then there was herlart in it She wondered in her agonyof fear how much her words haduweighed against him But she did notlose sight of her clewsaidLangford was innocent of courseThen some one else was guilty shereasoned and she had never forgottenthe evil covetous gleam in the man Garcias eyes Nobody else saw it howeverand nobody took any interest in herwild words She must work out herproblem alone and she began with herSpanish grammar Her Spanish studiestook her into the Mexican quarterand long and earnestly she strove toget a foothold in the man Garcias housebut without success and the way helooked at her sometimes made her heartafraidOne day in her little room she sankdown discouraged and began thinkingfast and hard There was one lastthing she could do but it was a verydifficult thing indeedI fear I am a poor detective shesaid sadly but I can be brave andfaithful anywayThe next moment she started upher book under her arm and was off forthe Spanish quarterIf I succeed she was saying to herself Brother Ben

ghost So abject are the innocent as well as the guilty in this peculiar terror that Kate found it ahard task to perfect her importantplan Finally for a money consideration the young Mexican with whom sheargued her case began to yieldNow remember Jose she said inparting the money is yours when youbring Filipe Garcia to night at midnight down the path by the old SanPedro cemeterySi senorita he answered earnestlyI will get him thereIt was a moonbright night but verycloudy for a New Mexican sky Themoon passed in and out among thestorm messengers like a lantern carriedthrough a forest on a dark night nowappearing now disappearing in anuncertain kind of way and givingshape and ghostliness to the most harmless thingsThe little old cemetery was just at theedge of the village and surrounded by ahigh adobe wall It was almost exactlythe time when the village clocks werestriking 12 that halting uneven stepswere heard along the hard adobe walkleading to this humble Gods acreThen as they came nearer a protestingvoice now refusing to go any farthernow raised in agonized entreaty Itwas Jose Martinez then who saidfirmly unpityingly that he certainlywould go farther even dov n that verylane to the graveyard Next there weresounds of scuffling as if Jose might becarrying out his intention withcult3r It was just as they reached theside of the burying ground oppositepoor old Sandovals new made gravethat they hesitated Everything wasdeathly still but each man could havesworn that he saw something beside thelong rows of white and black crosseswithin and Jose himself was not proofagainst any moving thing in a cemetery at that hour He had no taste forseeing graveyards yawn He stoppedstock still lettingo his victim Thelatter had every inclination to runand indeed started but at that verymoment an awful white apparition appeared above the wall and his kneesgave way beneath him He sank downtrembling crossing himself muttering Ah Dios Jesu Christi inthe most abject supplication The figure leaned toward him Felipe Garcia it said in awful tones you killedme where is my money where is mymoney you killed meThe wretched man fairly groveled inthe path and groaned aloud in his terrorYou killed me you killed mewhere is mv money where is mymoney continued the voiceHis tongue essayed to answer butcould hardly utter a vordIts its its in the wall in myHE SANK DOWN

could steady histrembling limbs for carrying him homeJose had long since disappearedstrong witnesses were already therepoor old Sandovals money was safelyin their possession and the little ghostwas crying nappy tears un nci u abrothers armGreat was the excitement in townwhen the facts were produced at daylight and Garcia arraigned in Langfords place So frightened was hestill that he did not hesitate toconfessevery detail of his crime How themoney was suggested to his covetousmind by Langfords careless talk andthe murder was a means to it Thiknife he had found and simply used because it

hod occasion to call on J H Wehrmann the oldbird man on South Sixth street forthe purpose of buying food for yourpetWhen you got there he probably offered you your choice of either driedflies or ants eggs in quantities to suitthe size of your purse or the stomachiccapacity of the said petYou may have been startled the firsttime at these efforts but if you werecurious enough to inquire you learnedthat both are very common articles ofdiet for imprisoned birds and reptilesand that they are imported to this country by the barrelThe flies are obtained from MexicoThey live in the swamps in various sections of the country and the individualinsect is called the moscos It is smalland delicate much more delicate thanthe omnivorous scavenger the commonhouse fly and its whole body has theappearance of having been gilded Inlife it must be beautiful It is perfectly harmless The flies swarm by thethousands and millions and are captured in silken nets by men who makeit their business Great quantities qfthem are cured or dried in the Cityof Mexico and other towns furthereast Most of them that are shippedto the United States come through Laredo Tex They are packed and soldby the barrelMr Wehrmann usually buys them inten barrel lots and retails them in smallquantities lou can get a large envelope about half full for ten cents andfrom this you can judge that a barrelful of them must costa pretty pennyThe ants eggs are brought from Germany mainly from a point near Hamburg In the Black forest lives a monster ant and the eggs are deposited inthe ground in such numbers that whena nest is uncovered it is just like digging into a wheat bin where the- egghunters commence work with theirshovelsAfter being dried they are packed iabarrels and shipped to the differentparts of

theCountryEvery iarge shipper in these daysmust have his own private freight carsand the wonderful growth o theLspecial car idea can be demonstratedany day by watching a through freighttrain It is dollar to cents that theretvill be anywhere from one to a dozenspecial cars in the string and the purposes they serve are as varied as theirownership The dressed meat refrigerators are now so well known as toexcite no interest unless it be in thevague conjecture as to how many millions of dollars are tied up thereinfor the number of these traveling iceboxes is legion Directly the oppositeof the refrigerators are the heater carscleverly contrived to keep the contentsat a fixed degree of temperature throughout the trip and therefore invaluable for shipping fruits in cold weather The heating is done by oil stovesThere are quite a number of specialfruit car companies which own carsespecially equipped for the carriageof fruit and produce in bulk and thesecars are divided into many classessuch as orange cars cabbage carsmelon cars and so on almost indefinitelyThere is a pickle line a coffee linenumberless beer lines and strangest ofall a chicken or poultry line theselatter cars being filled with permanentcoops and feeding and watering facilities intended for the safe handling offowls of all kinds There are furniturecars buggy cars chair stock cars icecars plate glass cars crockery carsand indeed cars for almost everyknown commodity manufactured insufficient quantities to make it worthwhile for the producers to build theirown conveyances As to live stock carsthere are all kinds from the palace orstable cars down to the plain everydayslatted affairs and unlike most of theolher special vehicles the stock carscan be used by any shipper willing topay the owner a nominal sum for therent of the car over and above theusual freight charges imposed by therailroads the advantage gained being the much better accommodationsafforded by these special cars thangiven in the regular equipment of therailways In tank cars there are varieties for nearly everything liquidPetroleum lard cotton oil molassesacid tar cider water and even whiskyare a few of the commodities carried intanks nowadaysThe owners of these private cars getno direct benefit from their use Thacontents must pay just the same freightcharges as if carried in railroad companies cars but the one great advantage lies in the fact that a supply ofcars ready to load can always be depended npon for the special cars whenempty are promptly sent home or totheir point of origin and are not usedin any other trade without the owners permission The railroads allowowmers a trifling sum for mileage whichserves to keep the cars in repair buthardly yields any great revenue tothemOf course many of these private carsarc built because of the special tradein which they are nsed and whichwould not pay a railroad company totie up money in furnishing the equipment necessary As builders mustconform to the rules of the master carbuilders the private cars are as safe torun as those owned by the railroadcompanies and indeed many aresuperior to the average cars in generaluse Philadelphia TimesTHE COQUETTE A BENEFACTORIVhy She Is aTrue Philanthropist inSocietyFrom an ethical standpoint at therisk of appearing1 paradoxical I will gofo far as to assert that the coquette isyour true philanthropist To beginwith she is generally a mens womanThat term immediately generates aprejudice in all well regulated mindsand yet why should it Charles Dudley Warner says of her She is a happycombination of qualities somewhat difficult to describe Mrs Eackett saysA creature for whom education hasdone much and nature more She hastaste elegance spirit and understanding Warner says She is all thisand more To begin with she is oldenough to know her world thoroughlyyet though she need never have beenbeautiful she must have kept heryouth She is in no sense a light woman neither is she over intellectual shewould not speak Greek even if shecould She is a creature of infinitetaot whom every outward semblanceof a man interests -profoundly Withhim she is always at her best and shecontrives to get out of him the bestthere is She listens well and growssympathetic as she listens Eas he aspecial weakness She half tempts himto believe it is a virtue An adept inthe subtlest forms of flattery she wouldforce the meanest of us to shine evenwhen he is ill at ease And yet aboveall she remains sincere Her interestin him is real and survives the fleetingmoment He is a man that is to say Jthe brightest page in natures bookShe respects convention knowing wellwhen she may venture to beventional yet she is unapproachableand irreproachable- In return headores her George Eliot says Onesself satisfaction is a kind of untaxedproperty which it is very unpleasant tofind depreciated The mens womanwith a word or a gesture 6r a look conveys to her companion the convictionYou interest me not so much forthe sake of pleasing as because it

INJUSTICEShortly after Mr Boyds return to WestPoint he missed sums of money broughtfrom home but said nothing about it Inthe class with Mr Boyd was a man whohad entered Wast Point at the avowed ageof 25 though undoubtedly much older ashis appearance indicated During wartimethe extreme of age for admission therewhich before and since was and is limitedto 22 years had been extended to 25 ThisWas done in order to permit young menVrho had achieved distinction in real warfare the opportunity of acquiring a military education So this man named Caseyhad entered at the acknowledged age of 25He was absolutely without money andbelonged to an Irish family in humble circumstances and his superior age and cunning unfitted Mr Boyd to cope with himMr Casey was compelled to procure money at all hazards Before entering WestPoint he had married That fact ifknown would have dismissed him at oncefrom the academy in accordance with thelaws governing that institution whiehpermit no cadet to marry In the academyat that time were several cadets sons ofvery wealthy parents who contrary toWest Point rules kept in their rooms atbarracks large sums of money That wasCaseys opportunity for he had constantneed of it with which to silence his wifewho had threatened his exposureSo great was the confidence of the academy classmates in each other that themoney was simply placed in a trunk towhich all the clique had access and usedas a general fund Tho government supplies cadets with all necessary articles sothat only luxuries need be purchasedEven to those generous young men the disappearance of money in large sums became puzzling and led to inquiries whichdeveloped into suspicions and a plan wasformed to mark some of the bills and thusdiscover the evildoerMr Boyd by reason of his unpopularity was unaware of those movements andhe had told no one of his own losses Thecadets had informed their immediate commandant that money was constantly being stolen in the corps Aghast at such astate of affairs he had authorized and Felected a committee of eight two fromeach company to find and punish thethief In an unguarded moment the commandant had said If you find the offender you can deal with him as you deem advisableThe most prominent member of thecommittee was Casey himself the realculpriAftpca perfunctory search throughquartera occupied by other cadets theyreached Mr Boyds and found nothing toreward their efforts At that juncture Casey glanced upward at a pile of books lying on some shelves and said Let us lookat that large dictionaryCaseys room was directly opposite thatoccupied by Mr Boyd who roomed alonebecause of his unpopularity Mr Boydsroom was unguarded and accessible so nodoubt Casey had frequently entered it andtaken money from tho man he now publicly accused The search took place at noonwhen the main body of the corps were atdinner On Mr Boyds return to his roomhe found it filled with cadets whomadlyaccused him of the crime White with horror and shame unspeakable he answeredtheir charges in a way which would haveconvinced any judge of human nature thathe was entirely innocent Sinking to hisknees and raising his eyes to heaven hecried By the memory of my deadJinother I- swear I knew nothing whatever ofthis moneyBut the supposed culprit was in thehands of Philistines No thought of mercyimpelled them I now quote from a published account by an eyewitness the scenelater in the day It was a cold sad blusterless day The air was full of snow andthe cold was bitter Orders were given tofall into ranks in the area of the barracks for undress parade The cadet adjutant commanded Parade rest Af ter apause he continued Cadet captains willplace themselves opposite their respectivecompany fronts and arrest any man wholeaves the ranks There was an intervalof the most profound stillness Then abovethe winds howling came the sound oftramping feetAcross the broad porch of the barracksand down the steps came four cadets bearing between them a mans form They advanced along the battalions front Asthey turned the adjutant raised his righthand and forthwith the drums and fifesbeat and wailed out in unmelodious andunearthly harmony the terrible tune ofthe Rogues March On they came andnoW I saw affixed to that mans breast alarge white placard and on it the wordsCoward Liar Thief The face abovethe words was marblo white as the face ofthe dead but the wild staring blood redeyes seemed to wail and shrink in theirhorrible misery The four cadets passedalong the full length of tho battalion andwith their victim turned down the slopebeyond the buildings and disappearedGeneral Cullom was then in commandat West Point On that particular eveninghe was returning from tho dock towardwhich those heartless cadets had drivenMr Boyd when he met the young manface to faceThe generals first and natural thoughtwas that Mr Boyd had dressed himself incivilians clothes and was stealing off thepost in search of amusement but a secondglance showed him a face full of grief andshame He took the young man at once tohis own quarters questioned him andfound to his dismay that the cadetsbadperpetrated a most unprecedented andcruel outrage General Cullom determinedthat the matter should be sifted to the bottomThe court of inquiry later instituted byGeneral Cullom resulted in a verdict ofnot guilty In the eyes of the cadetswhose insensate cruelty had warped theirjudgment it was simply a Scotch verdictof not proved and though acquittedthe defendant was thenceforth a disgracedand dishonored man ExchangeThe SaltanThe London Chronicle says that the
