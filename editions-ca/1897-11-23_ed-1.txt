many as100000 people will be gathered therenext year and a military force shouldbe ent to that territory and largeemergency powers should be grantedto the president to suppress lawlessness Probably

buildings lyingeastward of Aldersgate street and between that thoroughfare and RedCross street just after 1 oclock Fridayafternoon The flames were fanned bya strong wind and were fed by highlyinflammable stocks of Christmas fancygoods and flimsy dress materials of alldescription that filled every floor ofthe six buildings in the old street Consequently the conflagration gainedheadway with surprising rapidity andwas soon beyond the possibility ofbeing checked by the few enginesWhich were early on the spot Forfour and a half hours the flames hadtheir own way and it was after morethan a hundred engines had worked anhour that the chief of the fire brigadesent out the signal that the fire wasunder controlAt 11 oclock Friday night the firewas still the scene of greatest excitement Fifty engines were playing-upon the ruins wagons were hurryingtip coal and tons of water were pouring into the fiery debrisThe scene must occupjr the firebrigade for several days especially inview of the grave danger of the collapse of the shells of buildings whichfall now and again with a loud reportThe latest accounts indicate that nearly a hundred warehouses have been destroyed while the loss will probablyexceed 3000000 15000000 Thehistoric church of St Giles has beenmuch damaged the principal damagebeing to the roof the old windows thebaptismal font and Miltons statueAt 4 oclock Saturday morning a verylarge force of fireman and about twenty engines have been working at a highpressure all night The district ravaged by the fire is bounded by Aidersgate street Red Cross Maiden

the British fire insurance companies are involved and fireinsurance shares were practically unsaleable on the stock exchange Fridayafternoon after the fire was well underwayNearly 300 telephone wires have beencut thus interrupting communicationwith many of the big provincial townsThe fire will cause an enormous advance in the price of ostrich featherswhich rose 30 per cent Friday eveningTwo feather firms alone have lost 15000 sterling 75000The damage done by the fire is enormous - Most of the buildings destroyedwere six stories high and filled withmerchandiserThe area of the fire is at least 100000square yards Sixty warehouses havealready been destroyed and the fire hasextended from Wood street square toAldersgate streetThe fire originated in the storeof anumbrella manufacturer on Hamsellstreet at 1 oclock Friday afternoonand the great loss of property seemsto be due to the delay in summoningthe fire department The publishedreport says that the police officer whofirst detected the flames blew hiswhistle loudly for assistance but several minutes elapsed before the alarmwas heard by any of his comrades Assoon as assistance reached him theofficer was dispatched to call the firebrigadeBut here again this was an unaccountable delay of 20 minutes beforethe first engine appeared Then the fearful dimensions of the fire were apparent and it was decided to circulate acall throughout the whole metropolitandistrictThe church of St Giles was built in1545 It is approached by an archwayin Red Cross street also within thescene of the conflagration and contains among other things the tomb ofJohn Milton who died in 1074 thetomb of Fox the martyrologist Frobtsher the voyager who died in 15U4and Speel the tjpographer who diedin 1025Oliver Cromwell was married in thechurch

and valleys could be seen sinking and risingfar and wide the endless ridges of theGreen mountains sweeping away to theeast and the blue Adirondaeks closingthe western view It was the finestfarm in northern Vermont old MrDeane had always declared and thehigh pasture had been for generationsa favorite place for coasting parties andcorn roasts Tt was more popular thanever now since Sue Deane was thehandsomest girl in the county andcounted her swains by the dozen1 dont know how Sues ever goin tosettle down said her mother plaintively for theres no one man will humor her the way they all do now Andthen Sues so masterful shes as sweettempered as you please but she alwayshas her own way in the endSues obedient enough as far assee replied Mr DeaneWell father she is to you and always has been but dear me witheverybody else she does what shepleases I will sa shes generallyright but thats just it shes got asmuch sense and more than most of herbeaux and she aint likely to find ahusband she cant rule And thats poison to a woman like Sue she needs tobe managed herself Theres just oneId choose for her and thats Tom Kellogg But then my land hes not thekind to stand bein played with andSues not the kind to give up her waysfor anvbodv so there aint much hopeof itToms a good fellow said Mr DeaneTaint every boy could work throughcollege ndilaw school nd get into practice in a city as he has in BurlingtonAnd Sue and he knowin each otherfrom children ef they dont understandeach other by now they never will Ithink itll likely be a matchMrs Deane shook her head Accustomed to be ruled by her daughterswill she had little faith in any manscombating its caprices successfullyIn the main she was right That veryday Sue was planning in her coquettishmind how to tease Tom Kellogg at thecoming corn roast Sue treated otheradmirers as she chose but she felt Tomwas different and liked him all the better for not being sure whether she couldtrifle with him or not On this occasion being especially tender to him inher thoughts she was prepared to beespecially baffling in behavior fordeep in her womans heart she knewthat all the delaying all the coquettingin the world were not going to keep herlover from speaking before his shortvacation was over and he went back tothe city and meanwhile there was thesweetness of an understanding no lessstrong because it was yet unspokenSoft and clear the September eveningdrew on The whole neighborhood wasinvited to the roast They came in buggies in carryalls in hay wagons andone group after ftuother they climbedthe dewy steeps of the hill pasture ButTom Kellogg did not come and Suesbrowa eyes sparkled with impatienceL4Wij arid a touch oi anger at so unexpecteda turn of the tables Finally when thebig bonfire had been lighted and everyone was gathering about it Tomsbuggy drove up to the foot of the hilland he helped out of it a very youngand very pretty girl Miss Eleanor Cabell the city boarder at his auntsPoor Tom it was not his fault andSue might have known it but the amantis irae is proverbially -unreasonableThe facts were that Miss Cabell wasyoung charming ignorantly enthusiastic had never seen a corn roast andthought she was conferring a great favor upon Tom by accompanying himnot dreaming that his aunt had beggedhim to invite her Entirely ignorant ofhis affair with Sue she claimed himsweetly and unconsciously for herownOh how beautiful she cried asthey climbed the slope and saw thegreat bonfire flaming up on the summitDo take me close to it Mr Kelloggand she chattered away to him with little shrieks of admiration as the widestreaks of flame shot high into the airand flared upon the summer wind Theone huge pine tree stretching its widebranches upon the summit was so nearthe blazing pile of logs and brush thatone big limb caught a waft of the fiarcieand the needles snapped with cracklingexplosions Oh will it be quite safecried Eleanor and clung for an instantto her escorts arm Sue passing nearfelt a swift desire to strangle her on thespotBut that was only the beginning forMiss Cabell was either appealing toTom or ordering him around for thenext -two hours First she must have achoice ear of corn selected for her outof the big basket heaped up to overflowing wtjth the green tasseledsheaths Then with her own whitehands he must show her how to impale it upon the sharpened end of thelong lithe sapling and she would insistupon fixing one for him too Then theright place must be chosen where shecould lower the corn at the end of theswaying rod into the heart of the glowing fire now sunken to an irregular circle of white hot embers This necessitated getting so near to the bonfire thatthe heat reddened her pretty cheeksand Toms big handkerchief had to becalled into play Holding it before herface with one hand and peeping roundthe edge of it with many appeals as towhether she was holdingthe corn rightand was it done and was he sure thesapling wouldnt catch fire and burnher up Miss Eleanor Cabell was certainly a bewitching spectacle one ofthose charming helpless winsome little women whom all men enjoy Hqwwas Sue to know that Tom wasnt en-joying it When he managed to crossto her side for a moment he found herabsolutely stony to him and ilirtingdesperately with Will Adams and hewas soon almost as angry as she wasThe merriment grew and heightenedas the evening went on The smokingblackened sizzling ears of corn werewithdrawn from the fire sprinkled withsalt and hot and tender be3ond description were eaten amid a generalchatter and fun More and yet morewere stripped from their silken sheathstoasted and consumed and in thedying embers apples were cozily roasted as a dessert The great ring of firedied into a dim glow and then into amere twinkle of light here and thereamong the ashes the stars came outover the hills and the wind ceasedleaving a balmy clearness in the farspaces of the night It was time for going home so the revelers joined handsand ended the corn roast by dancing ina ring about the fire and trampling outthe last embers keeping time to theirflying feet by an old fashioned chorusas they swung round and round MissCabell was charmed with this shedanced like a fairy and laughed likea child as she tripped in the swayingcircle Everyone admired her andthought Tom Kellogg in luck Sueheard the comment everywhere shewas irritated beyond feminine endurance and when as the ring brokeand the groups scattered again towend their way down th hill in thestarlit softness of the night Tom atlast found his opportunity to speakwith her she was in her most exasperating moodI am going away day after to-morrowSue Can I ste you to morrowWill Adams is going to drive me overto Fair Haven to morrow I shall atopifMat Aunt Sylvias and I wont be backagain until Monday the said stifflySue said Tom shortly all his innate masterfulness coming to the surface if you dont see me before I goyoull not probably see me againThis was dangerous Sue knew hewas right and that she ought to givehitft a chance to explain but she wasnot the stuff of which patient Grizelsare made And just at this critical moment a sweet voice said out of thedarkness at his elbowOh Mr Kellogg isnt it a pity itsall over and we have to go home MissDeane it has been so delightful wehave enjoyed it so muchIt was Miss Cabell radiant and unsuspecting Her we was the finishing touch Sues face hardened into determinationYou must get Mr Kellogg to showyou other things of interest in ourcountry life she said sweetly hehas a little while before he goes backand will be at your service I am sureGood by Mr Kellogg I hope you willhave a pleasant winter in the cityGood by said Tom holding out hishand Sue turned away ignoring itand began talking and laughing withWill Adams who was hanging aboutwaiting to take her down the hill andwhom she knew Tom particularly disliked And that was the end of thecorn roastIt was Thanksgiving day The family gathering had taken place at theWilcox homestead this year for MrsDeane and Mrs Wilcox were sistersand alternated the festival Mr Deanethis time however was ill in bed andhis wife stayed to nurse him Sue cameover with the Alcotts who were cousinsand lived a mile or so beyond the Deanefarm The day had been eminently successful the dinner was a triumph ofMrs Wilcoxs skill the pies were flakythe turkey savory the cranberry a chefdoeuvre of jellied richness the cakebewildering in variety and lightnessOutside a whirling snowstorm hadrkged all day but with a dozen merryguests and the hearty Wilcoxes to bootthere had been no lack of gayety andfun in the old homestead It stood justoutside the village and now and thenduring the afternoon a neighbor wenthy in his sleigh and waved his handto the windows Tom Kellogg passedin the cutter with the colt he wasonly at home for a day or two andSue saw him with a great throb of herheart and a realization for the hundredth time since their quarrel of howmuch she loved him and how foolishshe had been Sue was a just clearheaded little woman in spite of hercoquetry she recognized that Tom wasin the right and that he was taking theI i J w z c MmummI AM GOING AWAY DAY AFTER TO

madesome sign Yet she knew also that heloved her as much as ever and was nomore liable to change in that steadfast affection than in the quiet determination that controlled it Tom hadturned the tables on her and gained themastery She vowed she would notyield but she felt her day of coquetrywas over whether she chose or notThrough all Thanksgiving day eachhad been thinking of the other Atchurch during the long and weightydiscourse which sent the youngermembers to sleep even upon the hardseats of the high backed pews Tom wascontemplating the side view of hissweethearts pretty head with a mingled desire to shake her and kiss heras one might a naughty but bewitchingchild When he drove the cutter in theafternoon it was not chance that tookhim by the Wilcox place He longed tobe within those hospitable walls tojoin in the games that he knew weregoing on with the chance perhaps fora moment to hold that nymph like figure in his arms on get one good lookinto those willful dancing eyes Itwould have been easy enough to go inbut Tom was a Spartan and crusheddown such weak desires And Suelooked out and hoped against hope thathe would come in and was gayer thanever in all the games and

listento the rainWhich beats its solemn rhythmic marchupon my window paneA dull and dismal monotone but in itsmuffled tuneWeird voices whispering of the past runsoftly through its runeAnd somehow as familiar tones are thusconveyed to meLoved faces from the shadow land withinthe room I seeThey come and gro within the glow of mydeclining fireThe ones who for long years on earth fulfilled my hearts desireAn aged mothers gentle face in halo madeof smilesWhose memory still keeps far all sin whichinjures or defilesThough now the coffins lid shields her fromearthly 111 and careHer voice comes back in accents sweetand bids her boy bewareNar her a fathers kindly face and gravebut loving voiceWith friends long gone who come againto solace and rejoiceWhose presence seems here to diffuse ablessing for their friendWhose kindly smiles and gracious wordswith love in blessing blendRed embers burning low as though lovesgenial altar firesThe raindrops marking time with beatwhich never flags or tiresAt such times come to seeing souls thespirits of the pastThe memories oft by daylight cares andstern work overcastThe forms which touch us not at all in toilsome garish dayThe gentler thoughts in business hours asshy and sweet as theyBut when the twilight shadows veil daysworry fret and rushGhosts march timed by the rains tattoothrough evenings restful hushHow sweet sometimes to rest at eve tohold this glad communeWith rhythmic rain and rhythmic thoughtand gentlest hours in tuneOur better selves thus touching souls whichlong since went awayTo leave us none we loved with quite sotrue a

of the hypnotist Hisgreat flashing eyes were fixed on thesleeper his brows contracted all hismental force seemed concentrated uponone ideaCome get up get up he said presently in a tone of commandWhidby caught his breath audibly asone suddenly waking from sleep Heturned over rose slowly and put hisfeet on the floor Come stand up thehypnotfjet ordered firmly Whidbyobeyed looking as if he were wideawake Do as you were told to do onthe night of the 10th of June Do it Isay dont hesitateSlowly Whidby walked toward theJ window at the head of bis bed but with-n a yard of it he suddenly stopped threwup his hand in front of him with a repellent gesture and retreated backwardto the center of the room Do it Isay repeated the hypnotist Oncemore Whidby slowly aproached the window with his hand outstretched butagain with the same gesture he stoppedand retreated to theeenter of the roomThe colonel witnessed the whole proceedings He fancied he saw an expression of vexation on the face of thehypnotist every muscle of whichseemed drawn every vein about toburst His large eyes seemed to startfrom their sockets For the third timethough now no word was spokenWhidby aproached the window andthen with a deep sigh and a strangechild like whimper he returned to hisbed and sat down on the side of itTen minutes passed The hypnotiststood like a statue A thrill of suddenfear passed over the colonel Couldany man be sane with that look on hisface Some one passed along the streetwhistling and carrying a lantern Itslight danced about on the walls for aninstant In the flashes the colonelsaw Whidby had covered his face withhis handsCome get up In the awful silencethe tones sounded like a clap of thunderThe colonel heard them ringing inechoes in the hall Whidby rose passedthe folding doors and entered Strongsroom The hypnotist released the portiere letting it fall across the openingand cautiously followed Whidby whoslowly approached the foot of the bedand then went round to the right andbent over the colonel The young manwas breathing hard and excitedly Hefelt the colonels body through the covering and then turning it down at thetop he pressed his fumbling fingersagainst Warrentons bare throat two orthree times then drew himself up andturning went slowly back towards theportiere He caught it with his righthand drew it aside and passed inDr Lampkin was close behind himfollowed by Warrenton They drewthe portiere aside just in time to seeWhidby strike the chair which was between him and the bed He graspedthe top of it with his right hand andleaned so far forward that the otherswasthought he going to lose his balance and fall on his faceHowever herecovered his equilibrium and pausedto replace the shirt which had fallen onthe floor Then he lay down on the bedturned his face from them and closedhis eyesThe hypnotist bent over him Sleepsleep he commanded Then he turnedto the colonel a look of disappointmenton his face Poor chap I am sorryfor him It looks very much as if hehad been made to commit the deed Iunderstand now what caused him tohave a slight remembrance of touchingthe chair picking up the shirt and soon When he stumbled and almost fellthat night the hypnotizer wras so fearful of the noise his fall would make thatfor an instant he lost control of his subject but he regained it in a momentand put him to sleep Wha was thatI thought I heard a sound in the otherroomDont be frightened it is I sounded from behind a screen in a corner anda man in a broad brimmed slouched hatlong whiskers and linen ulster rose intoview He drew off his hat and his falsebeard bowed and smiled Doctor weare not strangers he said Pardonmy lack of ceremony I confess I havebeen spying on your movements lhadto see what was going on and in myown wayMinard Hendricks by Jove ejaculated the doctor 1 should never havedreamed of your being here at such atime This is Col Warrenton a friendof Mr Whidby We were experimentingHendricks bowed to the colonel andwent on I know yon need not tellme I was in the colonels room justnow and overheard your talk I feltless like an interloper when I heard yousay you were going to give me the benefit of your investigations so I followed3 ou down here and have seen and heaTdall I am glad to make your acquaintance Col Warrenton but you mustboth pardon my impatience I am dying to make a little examination on myown account Will he is the youngman sound asleepYes he can hear only what I ad-dress to himGo ahead Warrenton joined inYou may do as you like hereThanks Ilendricks lighted thegas with a soundless match and goingto the window which Whidby had approached so many times examined thesill closely Then he crossed the floor1o the corner nearest the door and taking a small dark lantern from thepocket of his ulster he went down onhis hands and knees and throwing thelight here and there about the cornermade a minute examination of the carpet and then of the plastered walls nearwhere he crouchedWarrenton and Dr Lampkin watchedhim curiously both with long facesWhen he had finished and closed hislantern with a snap Warrenton ventured to sayIf you have discovered anything sirwhich would lead you to believe thatmy young friend was not the instrument of a hypnotist and not made tocommit the crime I should be verygrateful I am really afraid the morbidfear that such is the ease will drive thepoor fellow madHendricks smiled as he buttoned hisulster around himThat point I believe lies in DriLampkms province I was trying todiscover traces of the murderer where1 failed to search the other day For thepresent I can tell you no more However I may say that in spjing on you1to night I have discovered enough tojprove to ray mind at least that edtherthe murder was a hypnotist or MrWhidby is a capital actorWhat do you mean asked Col Wararenton sharplyThe detective smiledease Lither Whidby is guilty or someone else is and that is what thc publicJhinks I should be glad to prove himwholly innocent If he is guilty he

Delmar -was admitted to thedrawing room of the Strong residenceShe was thickly veiled She told Matthews she wanted to see Mr Whidbvat once As she took her seat she heardvoices in the library across

faceDont scold me she said extendingher hands and speaking tenderly Iicduld not let another day pass withoutseeing you after mjr weakness yesterday when you told me about your foolish fears in regard to hypnotism andyour being the the tool of some onewith that power I was so horrifiedyou seemed so earnest about it andit shocked and frightened me so that Tcould not comfort you But now thatX have thought it all over I am notworrying- at all Dear it is only imagination on your part You have read ofsucli things and fancy them possible toyourself I dont believe a word of itYou had nothing in the world to do withit It is only an absurd ideaWhidby put his arm round her anddrew hertoasofa He did not speak foratniinute but sat stroking her glovedhand Then he saidYou ought not to come here dearit is imprudent makes me veryI lllpSleep sleepl he commandedhappy for it is such a strong proof ofyour love and confidence Unfortunately however my morbid fears have justbeen confirmed Dr Lampkin thehpnotic expert of whom I spokeyesterday is in the library with ColWarrenton There is now no doubtlhatI was hypnotized and made to do thedeedWhat 01 Alfred Miss Delmarpaled and he felt her shudder as sheleaned nearer to himThere is no longer any doubt aboutit he repeated Dr Lampkin has justbeen giving me a good talk against worrying over what cant be helped andrealty I do feel more hopeful about itBesides all may come out well in theendBut but how do you know you didit Its perfectly absurdThey put mo to a test last night Twont trouble you with it It wouldonly try youir nerves to go into detailsI knew nothing about it I was hypnotized after I fell asleep and they gotsufficient proof to convince them Nowdont get excited darling you aretrembling all over just as you didyesterdayMiss Delmar drew her hands from hisclasp and covered her faceOh I cant bear it I simply cannotbear to think that you did it in in sucha horrid way Alfred 3 ou didnt YoudidntThe door bell rang Whidby sat staring into the frank eyes of the girl unable to formulate a reply Neither spokejust then They heard Matthews go lothe door and open it then a gentlemanentered the drawing roomI beg 3our pardon Mr Whidbyhe said I am Minard Hendricks thedetective who witnessed thein vour bedroom last night Ithought I might find Dr Lampkin amiCol Warrenton hereThev are now in the libraryanswered Whidby Matthews

pardon said HendricksYou are Miss Delmar I am sure Jwould not detain you but I am certainthat I can tell you something you wouldlike to hear Now I see Hendrickswent on smiling reassuringly thatyou think I am pretty bold to introduce nryself in this abrupt way butyou must remember that I am a detective and that it is my business sometimes to introduce myself withoutmuch ceremonyMiss Delmar smiled faintly andbowed Of course that is your rightsir she saidThen Col Warrenton and Dr Lampkin came inGood morning gentlemen saidHendricks I have been thinking overour mutual investigations of last nightand have come to the conclusion that itcannot harm my proceedings to endeavor to remove a false impressionfrom your minds in regard to MrWhidbys actions when hypnotized bythe criminal I could have told you thetruth last night but was not quiteready to do soYou dont think he was made to dothe deed asked Dr LampkinHe didnt broke in Miss Delmarexcitedly I dont see how anyonecould think so for a momentIlendricks smiled Thats the wayI like to hear it expressed he said tothe young lad3 If you had been preserit last night Miss Delmar you wouldnot have let them think soHow are 3 011 going to prove itasked Col Warrenton hopefully Dontmake any mistake this time Much depends on it Whidby has been frettinghis heart out over the horrible ideaMay we go into Mr Whidbys roomnow asked Hendricks Miss Delmar may come also I can explain tilingsbetter to ladies than to menWarrenton opened the door Certainly the room has been put to rightsCome onNow began the detective whenthey had entered Whidbys room wewont indulge in so much realism as tohave the colonel representing the deadman nor Mr Whidby playing the roleof a peaceful sleeper out of respect forMiss Delmars nerves for while shewould realty make a better detectivethan any one of you she is only awoman after all and we wont makethe picture any more gruesome than isnecessary For our purpose we willsimply imagine that the other roomcontains a sleeper and that Mr Whidby is reclining on this bed Now DrLampkin when Mr Whidby was hypnotized last night and you made himget up did you notice whether his righthand was closed or openI did not replied the doctor with asuoden start and then a questioningstare into Hendricks faceto be coxtixuedHIS MOTHERS WATCHA Poor Authors Straggle vrltli HifsSense of DutyMme Octave

BRIDEThe betrothal and marriage of MmeOctave Feuillet is told by herself withcharming naivete and wit in QuelquesAmies de Ma VieI was nearly 19 years old My mother insisted that I must marry Everyweek she presented a new aspirant butwhen after each interview she askedDoes this one suit you I repliedNo not this oneMy father urged me also It was generally during our horseback rides in thecountry while we let our horses walkalong the pretty routes that he undertook my conversionI know some one he said one daywho loves you and who this morninghas asked for your handAnother Good heavens 1Yes another but I hope you willnot rebel when you hear the name ofthis oneTell me my father who it isIt is your cousin Octave FeuilletWhat my cousin Is it possible thathe loves me He hardly knows me living so far away I have perhaps dancedthree times with him and that is allVery well that is sufficient He desires you to become his wife He desires it ardently Your mother and Iwould be in despair should you disappoint him with a refusalMy father let me have a little timefor reflectionNot too long answered my father and may God inspire youGod inspired me that same night tothink my cousin charming Again inimagination I saw him at those threeballs where I had danced with him andrecalled his handsome figure and bearing his distinguished looking featuresand his slightly haughty airI remembered the grace with whichhe bowed to a woman particularly tomy mother I recalled the words he hadspoken to the music of the orchestraduring the quadrilles words which didnot resemble in any way the trivialphrases I was accustomed to hear Hetalked as well as he wrote He had already a great reputation among literarypersons and his novels and poems weremaking a sensation in the worldAnd was it I who was destined to become the wife of this poet of this gentleman I could not believe in suCh goodfortune In accepting it I felt uneasyIt seemed to me impossible not to disappoint the accomplished being whohad deigned to choose me When Ithought of his worth I felt my own inferiority I found myself provincial andignorant Nevertheless my father hadsaid that he loved meHe loved me in spite of all my deficiencies It remained for me to recompense him by working for self improvement After having devoted my thoughtsexclusively to him I turned in imagination to the existence we would leadWe should doubtless live in Paristhis beautiful Paris which I had notseen since the journey with the ladiesof No more visits to the tombs ofSt Denis but presentations to thefriends of my husband and drives infiacres from museums to churches andfrom churches to museumsAnd then the installation of ourapartment and the purchasing of elegant furniture which would make itcharming how beautiful did all thesedreams appear when I compared themwith the monotony of the presentThe effect of all this was that I didnot sleep till morningI shall never forget that evening whenmy cousin came the first time as
