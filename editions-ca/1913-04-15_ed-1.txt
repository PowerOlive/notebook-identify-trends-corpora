McClintock, in whichthe court reduced the amount of alimony tor Mrs. IMcClintock from $10Uto $62.50 per month and modified theorder in relation to the time Mr. McClintock should see their cnild.Mr. and Mrs. McClintock ihave "anequal division of time as fto seeing thechild on Sundays, while Mr. McClintock will be permitted to see rthe childtwo hours each week 'day. The courtgranted to the father the privilege "ofseeing the child for taking advantageof the privilege at one time any day ofthe week. Mr. McClintock was formerly allowed to see the child threehours daily.Following Judge Kerr's announcement of his decision. Maury Kemper,representing Mrs. McClintock, askedan appeal, which was granted. Theaction of the court was made on a motion made by Mr. McClintock askingthat the amount of alimony be reducedand that he be allowed .to see hisdaughter as contemplated in the judgment ot the cpurt.Mr. McClintock was represented byCol. John R. Allen, of Lexington, andJudge Denis Dundon, of Paris. Col.Alien read an affidavit signed ,by Mr.McClintock in which he set ud thegrounds that his income from allsources is $3,245 annually, and that hisnereasary expenditures were so muchthat after paying the alimony of $100per month he had practically nothingleft.Col. Allen reporte'd that Mr. McClintock had paid $568 as expenses incurred in the Court of Appeals, andthat he Daid $1,200 feejas directed bythe court some.time ago as part payment'forjthe attorneys for Mrs. '.McClintock. He (said that if expensescontinued to pile up Mr. McClintockwould have but little'money left whenhis daughter reached womanhood.Practicallythe same statements weremade by Judge Dundon.Mr. Kemper said that the reasonthat Mr. McClintock had not been permitted to see his child a a often as contemplated in theorderof the court wasthat he was behind in his alimony payments. The Court of Appeals granted Mrs.McClintock a legal separation fromMr. McClintock and fixed the alimonyat $100 per month. The question otthe custody of thechild was left to thelower court.i " " """"WE KNOW HOW"' vr x-A,wV,X,- A'Jfwwwi-.VKjijfimmSpring HatsEn AH the Latest Stylesand ShapesNew Line of ShirtsThe Celebrated Fountain Shirt,!i&fltfA IT - am amThe Price Shirt $1.50Men's Night Shirts 50c, 75c, $1Pajamas $1 and $1 .50ManyApply forSuperintendencyincelthe resignation of Prof. Geo.W.

On the contrary, every resident is a "freeholder.VfUk aiiip m . w ,. r h IToo much praise cannot.lbe bestowedupon Quincy Ward, of this city, theExecutive Agent of the Kentucky Fishand Game Commission, for his untiring efforts in the enforcement of thelaw. Scarcely a'day passed that someof the State papers f ail'to overlook theopportunity to extend a little complimentary comment upon the manner inwhich Mr. Ward is conducting theaffairs of thisfdepartment. and it canbe readily observed from the mannerin which he has proceeded since theestablishment of the commission, thathe is worthy of every item of praisethat has "appeared to the public.Doubtless if there is a Irian in thisstate who is mure familiar with .theconditions, nor one who. even whennot acting in an official.capacity. "givesmore studv to this question. Foryears Mr. Ward has been identifiedwith the sportsmen of Jthe State, butof this great number there is not one,who seeing thegame lawsopenly andsecretly violated had the couraee totakejsteps'to bring order fromchaos.Mr. Ward was instrumental in having the game laws passedjand was active in favor ofthe creation of a gamecommission by the Legislature. As'areward he was given a position at itshead. How well he has attended theduties imposed upon him is attested bythe daily reports that come from allsections of theactivity of the agent forthe commission in enforcing the laws.Not orily iSjthia a prominent character in his career with the department,but he has taken steps to 'establishgame preserves, a greatly neglected,although essential rdeveluDment. Theefforts of Mr. Ward along this line willbe accepted for the good tney wiH dotoward preserving the game, of thestate, to prevent a ruthless slaughter,to rehabilitate the Kentucky forestsand to make our'State what it shouldbe in this respect.Abolish The Fiscal Court.Mr. Bowsorth, says the LouisvilleCourier-Journal, addressing the convention of County Road Engineers,aptly termed the grinding expense ofbad roads the "mud trust." It is theheaviest of taxes. The farmpr in acounty without good roads pays agreat deal more in "mud tax" than hewill.ever pay for the maintenance ofpeace by preparedness for war. HeDays "mud tax" upon every vehicle,every draught animal, Jevery bushel ofproduce, every .parcel bought at thecountry store, every basket of eggssent to market, and Jan enormois"mud tax'upon'everv acre of land.The value of land does not consistwholly in its productivity. It is in agreat measure situation. Land thatsells for S100 an acre because of saitable transportation facilities from thefarm gate tothe freight depot will notproduce any more per acre than 40land which is reached only by badroads.Mr. Bosworth has made a study ofthe roads question. He knows whereof he speaks when he says that theexisting Fiscal Court system cannotbe relied upon, to reduce .the "mudtax."'The "graft tax," the "negligencetax," the "incompetency tax," areadded to the "mud tax"under the Fiscal Court system. To get good roadswe must abolish Fiscal Courts.Church Rushed to Completion.A time record in church buildingwas established recently at Bankstown, New South Wales, Australia,when the edifice was built in tenhours.Quite So."Love is a joint stock concern,"murmured the girl.

So the battle isshorter, and two or three more fightswill follow in quick succession during the course of an afternoon'stertainment."en-Test of Sobriety.Many shibboleths have been devisedfor testing sobriety. George Meredith,who doubtless could have evolvedsome wonderful examples, had hechosen, calls them "oinometers, ormethods of determining the conditionof man, according to the degrees ofwine or beer in him." One of themost snareful of these is the sentence,"Give James Grimes' gilt gig-whip!and a cup of coffee from a copper coffee pot." London Chronicle.Before Visiting Sick.An infectious disease is more liableto be taken when one has been longfasting than soon after a meal. It iswell, therefore, when going to see afriend suffering from a disease of thiskind to eat a substantial meal first.Neither should one go into an affectedarea when very warm or after a long,quick walk, when the pores of thebody are all open.Butcher Shop for Cats.There is a butcher shop in NewYork city that is unique in one way atleast. It has been there more than 30years. From the very beginning itsproprietor, in addition to his regularbusiness, has made a specialty of furnishing appetizing meals for cats.

Ducklingsshould be marketed at from nine totwelve weeks of age. After that theytake on weight slowly, and it is notprofitable to keep them longer thantwelve weeks.Geese grow about as rapidly asducks. Allowance of course must bemade for the original difference insize newly, hatched goslings weighing about four ounces. Turkeys donot grow rapidly at the start, but develop much quicker after threemonths of age.ICtGather eggs dally.Cull out small eggs.The goose averages about thirtyeggs.Geese do not thrive when yarded;ducks do.The goose like the duck, has practically,, no crop.The average weight of the goose istwice that of the duck.Geese pair, but drakes will takecare of four or more mates.A hen left to shift for herself maylay in summer but seldom will in winter. "Are you figuring on entering oneor two pens in a poultry show, if not,begin now.Before packing and shipping poultry should be thoroughly dry and cold,but not frozen.Limberneck is caused by the fowlseating some dead animal matter thathas bred maggots.The goose is a grazing bird, whilethe duck thrives with a limitedamount of green food.Don't forget to sprinkle lime ondrop boards, not too much, for it ishard on the chicken's feet.Meat in some form must be fedpoultry at least twice a week alsogreen food if you want results.A good dry mash for layers: Twoparts bran, 1 part cornmeal, 1 partalfalfa meal, and 1 part beef scrap.Ducks can be profitably bred forfour years, geese can be bred formany years for a period that seemsincredible.Fifty hens with abundant room,care and proper feed will return morecash than one hundred carelessly fedand crowded.Dust the hen with insect powderbefore setting, and twice more whilehatching, then chicks will not be fullof lice to begin with!After hens have passed their periodof profitable laying (two or threeyears), they may be sold at little ifany loss on their first coeU- . 1YInstant ReliefTou can stop that awful itch fromeczema and other skin troubles in twoseconds.Seems too good to "be true but it is.true, and we vouch, for it.Just a few drops of the simple, cooling wash, the D.D.D.
