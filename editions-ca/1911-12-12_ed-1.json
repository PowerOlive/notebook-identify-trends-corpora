Burley Society Closes Big Deal.
The American Tobacco Company,
alleged enemy of the Burley Tobacco
Society of Kentucy, Indiana and Ohio,
has purchased a large part of the re
mainder of the 1909 pool remaining in
possession of the l'.crley Tobacco
Society. About 8,000,000 pounds

This closes out all pool holdings, and
work on the new ten year landlord's
agreement will now be taken up with
renewed vigor. This leavts about
four million pounds on the society's
hands.
This tobacco had been held or two
years for better prices. Two weeks
ago some cf it was placed on open
matket in Lexington and Cincinnati.
Inducements had been held out to the
American Tobacco Company buyers,
it is said, but they bought very little
n opnn market.
3 Ai the meeting of the Burley Socie'y
last week however it had a represen
tative who opened negotiations which
are now closed. The tobacco will be
taken immediately and the money paid
before Christmar.

An Appeal for Assistance.
The btate Tuberculosis Society and
the local society will shortly make an
appeal to the public through the sale
of Christmas seals to contribute to
their work.
The State Association will again
make a determined fight in the legis
lature this winter for a State sana
tarium, for State aid for county sana
toria, and for funds with which to
carry on its educational work, so far
financed entirely from private sources.
Is the crusade against the Great
White Plagueworth the while?
During the four years of the Civil
War the total loss of lives was 205,700
Evrey four years theltubercle bacil
lus (consumption germ) destroys in
the United Ststes alone over $700,000.
Evrey year from 180,000 to 200.000 die
of tuberculosis in the United States.
Kentucky furnishes 6,500 eathsd an
nually from tubreculosis.
The anual economic loss from con
sumption in the United Stated is S330,
000,000 The annual economic loss in
Kentucky is 10,400.000.
Can we afford this loss or can we
better afford to protect the public by
creating the proper facilities for car

thus-saving fuitter inteel ion.
