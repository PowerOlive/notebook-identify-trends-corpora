It is certainly true that th play is one
of the most fascinating and interesting
plays on the stage of to day Cincin

This play calls back the old days when
big steamers plowed the mighty Missis
sippi arid when St Looy was the
mecca of every riverman St Louis

Mr Hamiltons work is careful adroit
and effective as gentle shrewd whim

Yes sirree observed Silas Winter
green Billville is gettin too all fired
good fer me Im goin ter move to the
country
Why Uncle Silas whats the cause
of this sudden determination in
quired the postmaster

unlimited speech which is my constitu
tional right
Tell me about it Uncle Silas
Well it was this way You know

Ten Nights in a Bar room up at the
town hall Well after the show Prof

villian at the play Well when I ex
pressed my opinion dont you know he
had me arrested fer swearin
You dont tell me
Yes sirree he did Billville is
gettin too dodgasted good fer Silaa
Wintergreen When a feller cant ex
press his opinion about the opery and
sech things without bein arrested I
low that its time to move to the country
where a feller can say what he dod
gasted pleases
A GRAVEYARD COLLOQUY
At rare intervals the moon peeped
through the billows of a sea of fleecy
clouds and cast sickly beams across the
path of a form which was walking slow
ly and stealthily in a country graveyard
The figure stole furtive glances about
him as he crept to the grave of a man
who had died on the gallows on Friday
Just as the clock was tolling the mid
night hour the form fell prostrate on the
srrave uttering not a sound Almost in
an instant the figure rose Taking a
knife from his pocket he made a single
rapid cut and turned to leave the place
A moonbeam revealed a look of ghoulisb
glee on his countenance
Halt
The figure stopped
Who goes there
Jist a poah niggah
The figures met and the lanterns flash
disclosed the identity of the men

loves subterfuge
When the face of your loved one fair
Bears looks of pain or mute despair
Tis not always a heart wound deep
Her thoughts may seem on some past day
And yet be not a foot away
Her foot perchance may be asleep
Walter Champ in Courier Journal
Pill a bottle or common glass with urine
and let it stand tweuty four hours a sedi
ment or settling indicates an unhealthy con
dition of the kidneys When urine stains
linen it is evidence of kidney trouble Too
frequent desire to urinate or pain in the
back is also convincing proof lhat the kid
neys and bladder are out of order
WHAT TO DO
There is comfort in the knowledge so often
expressed that Dr Kilmers Swamp Root
the great kidney remedy fulfills every wish
In relieving pain in the back kidneys liver
bladder and every part of the urinary pas
sages It corrects inability to hold urine and
scalding pain in passing i or bad effects fol
