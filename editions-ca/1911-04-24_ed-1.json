Harem Oewn to Be Worn at Open
Htise Tonitkt.
Eddie Adair and Edytta Hanney.
t bo are to appear at tha Opara House
on Wednesday and Thursday of thi
week, in their newest offering, "Clas
cal Tomfoolery." have been known to
the vaudeville public for the past five
yvars as two of the best dressers io
this particular line of theatricals.
Miss Henney just received form
Paris (not Kentucky) a handsome
Harem gown. This importation at
the cost of $400, has set the women jpf
many cities to thinking seriously of
wearing this new style of gown. Last
week in Lexington it created a sen
sation and the Hippodrome was packed
at every performance, it being safe to
say that not a lady in Lexington miss
ed the opportunity of seeing with her
own eyes what has been the talk of
this country and Europe .for .the past
year.
Miss Henney will 'wear the Harem
gown at each performance tomorrow
and Thursday nights. Eddie Adair
will be remembered by the "musical
set" as being the composei of some of
the best selling song successes of the
day. He will sing his famous hit,
"When the Right Girl Comes Along."
Miss Henney is conceded to be one of
the most beautiful women on the
stage, as well as a performer of abili
ty. Mr. Chas, Hecklow. the eccentric
comedian, warranted to make you
laugh and two fine independent pic
tures will complete what will be about
the best bjll of thn season.
Health Board Means Business.
The Health Board is not running a
jesting plant. True its members'often
indulge in light, refreshing pastimes.
That's when we are out for .a good
time. Not so now. They are strictly
out for a "hot time in the old town,"
and are not going to relax an effort
until they know the old town will be a
clean town some day. Ge up steam
then and come on. better look at your
running gear and see how yon are fix
ed. We are expecting any tu nig good,
bad, indifferent and might bo. incited
to fight the Devil with .is own
weapons. Awake ! Turn on tha light,
can't you see what's coming. This is
intended for you not the other fellow.
If your neighbor it wrong be his friend
and show him his errors, be sure how
ever, you have the right to approach
him.
The scriptural idea .of the beam and
the moat is not inapt here.
These little, phrases are not writds
to hurt, their only aim is to interest
and impress. You will hed them will
you not? If you don't and a little
reminder comes your way preserve
your balance. Otherwise you will ag
gravate your troubles and not lessen
ours.
True you feel aggrieved (a few only)
but in the parlance of the street you
will come across all right wunt you7
We think so, and it i3 best for you and
for the pubilc.
Time will mcllcw your woundecrfeelf
ings and biing you to a full realization
of your duties and obligations as good
citizens and you will be just as ready
and willing as are all fat-minded men
and women to join the chorus, "down
with the .hammer brigade," else you
are tough sure.
The super-critical may not admire
grammar, diction, etc., but that's im
material to the

The Chicago Record-Herald in a re
cent issue has the following to say of
Al Kaiser, a former member of the
Paris club, now plaiyng in the outfield
for the Cubs.
"Kaiser made two swell catches in
thefoutfield, Fand Artie Hoffman had
better look out for himself. In the
first inning he robbed Rube Ellis of a
triple by scooting back to left center
and pulling down a long drive. In the
ninth he took another triple away from
the aame man, this time going to right
center and making a sparkling catch."
