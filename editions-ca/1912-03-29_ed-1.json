Girl Grows Crop o Tobacco.
Milleraburg can boast of a very suc
cessful tobacco grower of the gentle
sex and from the fact the crop was
tended by a girl of 13 years of age
makes it all the more remarkable. The
girl is Miss Agnes Waddell, daughter
of Judge T. P. Waddell of Millers
Uurg, and the tobacco was grown in
the turl. ay pens in Millersburg. Miss
Waddell cared for her crop from the
time the plants were set until the
tobacco was ready for cutting when
male help was employed. The crop
consisted of about 130 pounds, which
wfs sold on 'the lo.ose leaf market at
Carlisle for an average of $20 per
hundred. Miss Waddell is happy over
the price she received for her product.

Hospital Location , May Be
Changed.
.When the Massie Memorial Hospital
is established fn this city it will in all
probability -be of a different location
from that set out in the will of Mrs.
Anna K. Massie who upon her death
bequeahted her home place'Hidaway"
at the corner of Vine street and Stoner
avenue for the purpuse. It is the pur
pose now to buy the White property,
first proposed as a hospital, and dis
pose of "Hidaway" to Mr. W. C.
Massie, a son of the late W. W.
Massie.
Mr. Massie met with the trustees of
the hospital, Mrs. E. F. Clay and Mrs.
Lucy Simms, and made a proposition
to purchase the property that it may
be perpetuated in the family and at
the meeting of the City Council last
night the matter was taken up. By a
unanimous vote the Finance, Commit
tee was instructed to dispose of the
bequest of Mrs. Massie to the only son
of her deceased husband, and to use
the proceeds in ;tht- purchase of the
White property to Ibe used for the
hospital.
The trustees of the proposed hospital
met with Mayor Hinton yesterday and
discussed the proposition made to
them by Mr. Massie . Mrs. Simms and
Mrs. day have secured an option on
the White property at' $6,000 and it is
the purpose to sell the bequest of
Mrs. Massie and utilize the proceeds
in the purchase of the White property.
Following the action of the Council
last night the Finance Committee will
at once open negotiations with Mr.
Massie looking toward the transfer of
the property to him if amicable terms
can be reached.
The White property has long been
regarded as the most logical place for
the hospital. It is located in an ideal
spot with the most excellent surround
ings. The building contains twenty
three rooms and is in a gocd. state of
repair. It was erected by the late G.
G. White at a cost of $30,000.

THEATRICAL.
THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS."
At the Paris Grand next Thursday.
April 4, Jos. M. Gaites will present
John Hyams and Leila Mclntyre in his
atmospheric musical play. -.."The Girl
of My Dreams." This musical produc
tion which had its initial presentation
in Chicago last season enjoying a
twelve weeks' run, is said to be one of
the most delightful and refined musi
cal plays seen in years and a worthy
successor to Gaites' famous "Three
Twins."
The story of the piece tells of a
bachelor's downfall before the charm
of a demure little Quaker girl. These
roles will be those of the principals,
John Hayms and Leila Mclntyre. The
bachelor is much of a club man and
has the cynical' attitude of his class
toward the feminine sex. A habit oi
breaking village speed ordinances
leads him into a bad, motor, accident.
He, is carried, much injured, -into a
Quaker household where he is nursed
back to health by the Girl. By the
time he is able to look about from an
arm chair his ideals of bachelorhood
are shattered.
The Quakeress and her father go
later to the city to see the hachelor
and the young woman is much shocked
by her prospective husband's friends.
She doesn't know whether she loves
him or not, but the aky is clear in time
for a happy wendding Just before tha
drop of the final curtain. The piece is
chuck full of catchy musical numbers,
"I'm Ready to Quit and Be Good"
effectively rendered by Mr. Hyams,
and Miss Mclntyre's deilghtful"Doctor
Tinkle Tinker" being the most popu
lar. The supporting companj numbers
among the principals Alice Hills,
Harold Forbes, Carrie Bowman, Irving
Brooks, Wm. G. Ricciardi, Delia
Nevin, Perciat Aylmer and Henry Carl
Lewis. Seats on sale at Mitchell &
Blakemore's. Free list 'is entirely
