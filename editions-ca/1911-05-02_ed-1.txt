Stuart, Chairman of theBourbon County t-iepublican Committee, lorcsaw the probability of defeat,and in an effort to secure the instructions of the county, Stuart announcedhimself as a candicale fo RailroadCommissioner, after offering hisresignation as county chairman, andasked that the opposing factions uniteand instruct the delegation i'6r him.The leaders of the Garrett faction declining to consider his proposition insisted upen a vote being taken fortemporaiy chairman and put in nomination A B.

After considerable wrangling itwas decided to give Earlywine thebenefit of one hundred votes. Claiming unfairness they held a rump convention on the steps of the Baptistciiurch, selecting James Shea aCnairman and Jim Brool:s,a negro, as Secretary. After introducing resolutionsthe following delegates and alternateswere named by the Craig men :A. W. Cottingham, G. W. Stuart, J.B. McClintock, W. W. Jackson. GeorgeMason, Horace Mitcnell, J. V.

Kaiser, tne Cub outfielder, had one of his fingers broken,while attempting to fieiu a line drive.He will be out of the gnme for sometime as a result of his injury.A dispatch from Chicago says BillySmith, manager of tne Chattanoogaclub, callsd President Murphy of theCubs over long distance and tried tobuy Kaiser. "Not for your wholetown," was Murphy's reply. "Whosaid you could get him?" he then asked. And the answer was that GarryHermann had told them Kaiser was notmaking good and might be procured.Cincinnati is Kaiser's home town andhe was overlooked by all the Cincinnati scouts, though he played exhibition games with the Reds. This mayhave been Garry's little way of getting even.Desirable Property.Barnes Palce is the first residentdistrict on Main street to be thrownopen to "the public in the history of thecity.

It isjust as unreasonable to expect the same results from thin, weak soil, in comparisonwith deep, rich soil, as it is to expect a child to do a man's work. This is a reasonable proposition, particularly to the scientific corn grower.More money is being spent and greater efforts along educational lines are beingmade to-day than ever before in the world's history to increase the yield of corn peracre. We contributed a very large effort to accomplish these results with our BlackHawk single kernel edge drop, and we now add to our combination the No. 15 Variable Drop, with which the drop can be changed to 2, 3 or 4 kernels in a hill withoutstopping the team; or can drill 7 1-2, 10 or 15 inches, 9, 12 or 17 1-2 inches, or 11, 14or 22 inches apart, without stopping the team.Hand Drop Attachment with each Planter, has Foot Drop also.
