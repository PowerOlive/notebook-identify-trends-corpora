He will have his office in thecourt house, in Paris, and will bethere every day ready and willingto help persons subject to the income tax make out their returnswithout any cost to them for his services. How many income-tax payers willthere be in Bourbon county? If youcan guess how many married personsliving with wife or husband willliave net incomes of '$2,000 or overand how many unmarried personswill have net incomes of 1,000 orover this year, then you know.The Collector of Internal Revenueestimates that there will be 900 taxpayers in this county.Returns of income for the year1917 must be made on forms provided for the purpose before March 1,191S. Because a good many peopledon't understand the law and won'tknow how to make out their returns, the government is sending inthis expert to do it for them. Butthe duty is on the taxpayer to makehimself known to the government.If he doesn't make returns as required before March 1 he may haveto pay a penalty ranging from $20 to$1,000 and pay a fine. So if youdon't want to take chances on incurring these penalties, you bettercall on the income tax man. If youare not sure about being subject" tothe tax, better ask him and make;sure. Whether you see the incometax man or not, you must make return if subject to tax.Of course, persons resident inother counties may, if they want to,come and see the income tax man,who will be here.The Collector suggests that everyTndv start figuring up now his income and expenses so as to be readywitn tne ngures wueu mc cajch.rives. Expenses, however, don'tmean family expenses, money used topay off the principal of a debt, newmachinery, buildings, or anythinglike that. They mean what youspend in making your money, interest, taxes paid, hired help, amountpaid for goods sold, seed, stockbought for" feeding, rent (except for.your dwelling) , etc Income includesabout every dollar you get.JK2 151 T3BEST OF ALL.Would not you wife be delighted.to -find, a McDougall Kitchen Cabinet in her kitchen Christmas morn?$1.00 will put one there.

IN 'THE ,WUllLAJM UVAJ JUXiuui.Stories are frequently told of ahorse rescuing a man from drowning, but very rarely is a man calledupon to jump into the water to savethe life of a drowning horse. However, an incident of this kind occurled during the filming of GeraldineFarrar's Artcraft production of "TheWoman God Forgot," which will beseen at the Alamo Theatre and PansGrand Opera House, Monday afternoon and evening, Dec. 24.During the action of the story asna.iiferri dashes through the private.vinn nf Montezuma's daughter,!and leaps with his horse into thepool where the royal Aztec maidenswere wont to swim. The people on-h -ha-nv watched the animal go un-i,Q wntpr rise to the surface 1and go under again, three times.One of the members of the organization then realized the horse wasdrowning. He dived into the pool,caught the bridle of the animal,s;am with it to a runway at oneside of the pool, held the horseslioad on his knee while a sling wasio.oH nrmmd its body, and towed itto a place where it couldashore.mi E3 isbe ledTHE CHRISTMAS STORE."

Business goes on all the happier because there is a warm, charitable feeling in a man's soul toward"his employer or employees or acquaintances. We are all so busywe are apt to forget to be consider--ate,forgiving and kind. It .is wellto let the brain rest and allow theheart to rule sometimes, or men maylose the faculty of loving and beingcharitable.Centuries of experience have proven that it is well to make a Clearing house of the season, to squareaccounts by wiping off all the oldgrudges and settling old quarrelsand listening once again to the message of peace and good will. Angerand malice never gave a man happiness; nothing but forgiveness andcharity can do that.The new Christmas game will bevery fashionable.

Every American who wants to help win thiswar should bear in mind that private service mustgive way to government service should emergencies require that everything be subordinated tothe telephone demands of the army, the navyand other representatives of the government.So when the increased business of fall and winter is reflected in your telephone service by a slowing down and by more frequent "busy" reriorts,remember that we are using every means at ourcommand to keep our sendee up to its usual standard. Every available position at our switchboardis occupied and it is difficult to secure additionalpositions because Uncle Sam's requirements havereduced the available supply of material to thepoint where manufacturers cannot make a definitepromise of delivery.Here's how you can help.

H. S. student, who is now "Some-where-in-France"is published bycourtesy of his mother to whom theletter was written.November, 5, 1917.My dear Mother :My mail is increasing to suchproportions that I fear a secretaryis necessary. Books, papers, magazines, tobacco, candies and I certainly do appreciate, all of themOne box war intact, the other lookedas if it had met with a U-boat enroute. We are closer to the war than IJiave ever been before. Close enoughto feel it's pulse, to hear eye-witnessleports, and to see some of its terrible destructive force.My first visit ashore in this country is one I will never forget.Cities that were once typical of thecountry they represent, are nowstrangely changed and cosmopolitanpractically all the male population in some kind of military uniformonly the very old and thevery young are to be seen in civiliangarb. There are many odd and interesting visitors gathered togetherin this Mecca of armies doing theirsharp towards mnlcinpr t.Ti "Wnrlrl"safe for Democracy."Sengalese, Algerians, Morocansand East Indianmen from the Colonies of England and France astrange collection of men are thesebrown and black soldiers baggytrousers, short jacket, turban headdress and every imaginable kind offoot gear they wander aimlesslyabout, unusually interested in theopen bazaars that display odds-andends and gaudy trinkets. I watchedone make a purchase and his selection was pitiful as well as amusing.Judging from the coins that changed hands, I know that a goodly portion of his month's pay, and whatdo you think he received in return,a pair of baby blue, ribboned sleeveholders, a useless, highly ornamental clock and a celluloid comb.The thought occurred to me 'that Iwould like to see one of those fellows with a couple of dollars inWoolworth's after the first shockof surprise, he would probably develop into a raving maniac.For all that, these strange, ignorant, filthy soldiers have their ownimportant part in the war. Theyknow no fear of death, and whenthe time comes to charge the Bochetrench they are armed with twolong double edged knives and "overthey go." They either capture thetrench or are themselves destroyed.No half-way job for them. In theiropinion a prisoner is a nuisance andvery unnecessary. These black andbrown soldiers once they have captured a trench are immediately relieved from holding it theywill" not stand under artilleryfire and if they can't go forwardthey turn around, walk out andleave the trench disgustedly.Besides these soldiers from foreign, distant lands, there are themore familiar figures of "TommyAtkins", French poilu, and our ownboys, and Portuguese soldiers andmen 'o'war's men. Here and thereworking under guard are Germanprisoners whose looks and actions J 9plainly show that they are not at all jdispleased with their present lot. j 9The different uniforms first at- jtract one's attention, and then grad- jually there creeps over one the de-1pressing realization that nearly all j 9of the young women passing on the ( astreets are in deep mourning it 1makes you feel like doing something1grand and noble for these people'who have suffered so silently andjawonderfully. j JEverything has its blighter aspectand we have lots of fun and amuse-' Jment, and our French hosts are veryehthuasistic.
