r . PROGRAM.
The chicken business does not fail.
It is the individual who fails. Teach
ers fail in the teaching business;
preachers fail in the preaching busi
ness; lawyers fail at law, and doctors
at medicine. Poultry raisers too fail.
But the poultry business keeps on for
ever, and forever will. It offers big
premiums to patience, industry, study.
Garden Hose.
We have a big stock of garden hose
and all kinds of nozzles. Telephone
