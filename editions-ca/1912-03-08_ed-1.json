Aerial Gun Practice.
Aerial gun practice is not confined
on our battleships, to one and three
pounders. The Springfield rifle, the
bullet of which hurled at an angle of
5 degrees elevation, reaches a height
of G.SOO feet, is such an effective piece
that it "will afford no inconsiderable
defense against any aeroplane which
vould attempt to execute feats of
bomb dropping.

CURIOUS BITS
OF HISTORY
A NAPOLEONIC COLONY IN
ALABAMA.
By A. W. MACY.
The overthrow of Napoleon
and the establishment of a new
regime in France, was followed
by the banishment of many of
his prominent followers and sup
porters. Among them ' were
generals and other officers of
high rank, and ladies who had
figured prominently in court
circles. One group of them
came to America, with the idea
of establishing a little com
munity of their own, but sub
ject to the jurisdiction of the
United States. Congress grant
ed them, by act of March 3,
1817, four townships of land, to
be selected by them in the state
of Alabama; the conditions be
ing that they should cultivate
the vine on one acre in each
quarter section, and the olive
on another, and at the end of
14 years pay the government
B $2 an acre for the land. About
400 men and women came over,
under the leadership of Marshal
Grouchy and General Lefebre.
Most of them settled in two vil
lages, Demopolis and Eaglesville,
in what is now Marengo county.
Here they lived for several
years in quietness and simplici
ty. But the vine and the olive
did not prosper, and the leaders
became discouraged. The colony
gradually melted away, though
it is said the descendants of
some of these aristocratic
French- settlers are still -Ao .be
found in that region. '

will head a subscription list with
$1,000, provided that it is circualted in
Paris and Bourbon county to secure
the amount necessary to pay for the
rights of way that may not be donated
between Paris and North Mddletown.
Third I will subscribe $2,000 in
cash toward securng the road provided
a route is used that does not go
through my farm at all.
Will you please give as much pub
licity to these, the actual facts, as you
did to the particle referred to, so that
the people of North Midaletown may
judge whether others along the line
will waive any greater part of their
damages or whether those who have
been so free with their criticisms and
dictations as to my actions will be as
ready and as prompt to render sub
stantial aid.
It is a very easy matter to say what
should be given bv other people. Let
us hear from tnose who have the same
interest in Paris as I have and who
have been so ready to inspire such
articles as the one you published. Let
us hear what they are willing to do
themselves.
I trust that this may be seen in the
right lignt and that everyoue interest
ed may feel inclined to do his part in
this, and that this road may soon be
assured.
Yours respectfully,
J. T.'HINTON.
DIAMOND NOTES.
Manager Ed McKernan, of the
Battle Creek, Mich., club has purchas
ed of. the Winchester club Catcher
Laross and Shortstop Callahan.
At a meeting of the directors of the
Winchester Base Ball Cluo Monday
night, a committee was appointed to
raise $1,500 to finance tne club for
the coming season. It is thought that
if the 1,500 can be raised to tide the
club through the training season it
will be aelO supporting through the
rest of the season. A meeting will be
held next week to elect a manger.
George P. Shears, an ex-m ember j
of the Bourbonite pitching staff, now
a New York recruit, is thought to be
one of the best prospects in Harry
Wolverton's squad for the coming sea
son. Reports say tint the young Ken-tui-.kian
is well liked by his new
manager and is sure of a good chance
to make good in fast company. Shears
is only twenty years of age and is 6
feet three mchea tall. He mas with
Paris last season when they won the
Blue Grass League penant. He work
ed in 37 games, winning 20. He struck
out 168 batters and walked 66.
When thejseason for spring practice
rolls around eighteen or twenty men
from which will be picked the team to
represent Paris in the Blue Grass
League this season will make thier
way to this city to enter on their
strenuous work of conditioning for the
trials that-will be before them during
the coming struggle for 1912 pennant
honors.
The Paris team this season will be
made up almost entirely of new
material, as only one of the men which
composed the team last year has re-,
mained on the reserve list after the
drafting.season has signed a contract,
that being Outfielder Goodman, who is
now in the city awaiting the arrival of
the other members of the club who
are scheduled to appear here about
April 11.
The fact that Billy Kuhlman, the
fast third sacker of the pennant win
ning organization for two years, has
not returned his contract is becoming
a matter of deep concern wih the
fans, and James Hauser, the star
twirler, who was the only hurler in
this company who last season presid
ed on the mound in a no-hit affair, is
another who the local followers of the
game were counting on to be one of
the first to send his contract.
Although there will be many new
faces here this season, the local man
agement is confident of finding some
real good material and to this date a
total of eighteen men have been sign
ed. Manager Lewis, who will arrive
here about ten days ahead of the other
men under contract, seems to be on the
lookout for a number of good hurlers
to make up the pitching staff this sea
son and besides himself has gathered
together half a dozen, most of whom
were members of the Marion, O., club
of which he was at the head for two
seasons. They are C. C. Meyer, Law
rence Ulrich, H. S. Blankenship, Pete
Wood, J. C. Clarke and Ed Koebler.
W.ood is a brother of Pitcher Joe
Wood, of the Boston Nationals and is
said to be a youngster of much
promise.
Two catchers have been signed to
try for the place made vacant by the
drafting of Walter Mayer, who this
year goes to the Chicago White Sox.
They are Howard Myers and Leo
Pick. C. J. Conrad will try for Bar
nett's position at first and Thos. Dun
lap and Clem Howard, the latter a
Cynthiana boy, will try to make the
second station. Giles and Galloway
are two new shortfielders and the club
has under contract an outfielder by
the name of Fenzel.
President Bacon stated that he has
the hooks out for a high class catcher,
but is not sure at this time whether it
will be possible to get his here. How
ever, the club will put forth a mighty
effort as it is realized that this most
responsible position must be filled by
a competent -man. It is also stated
several other players are being con
sidered and an outfielder who should
figure prominently in the batting
record of the league members is being
sought.
Beginning Life.
It is a sad thing to begin life with
low conceptions of it. It may not be
possible for a young man to measure
life; but. it js possible to say: "I am
resolved to put life, to its noblest and
best use." T. T. Hunger.

elaborate Imp production of "Ten
Nights in a Barroom. " This is by far
the most gigantic motion picture pro
duction of a play ever produced. The

reels, comprising 3,500 feet of film and
over 100 scenes. It was staged by an
all star cast of performers.
" Every scene of the famous novel and
play is produced with several additions
making its production easily rank as
the greatest of all motion picture pro
ductions. The photorgaphy is excel
lent andt he film being new are ex
ceptionally clear and distinct. This is
one oft he few motion picture pro
ductions that is unqualifiely endorsed
by the clergy as teaching a good moral
lesson, and every parent should see
that their chilrden, as well as them
sevles witness it. It is prelete with
pathos and comedy. There is no sen
sationalism. There are 25 peoplb in
the cast making it the greatest dra
matic picture of the century. A

"I'm going to ride at the country,"
