considerable Thesplashes of blood found at daylight atthe position the Spaniards occupied indicate fatalities but their comradescarried off the killed and woundedThe engagement began with desultory firing at the pickets 1000 yardsinland from the camp Capt Spicerscompany was doing guard duty andwas driven in finally rallying oa thecamp and repulsing the enemy at 5oclock The bodies of privates McColgan and Durphy were found bothshot in the head The large cavitiescaused by the bullets which inside arange of 500 yards have a rotary motion indicate that the victims werekilled at close rangeThe bodies were stripped of shoeshats and cartridge belts and horriblymutilated with machetesWhen they were brought in the-whole battalion formed three sides ofa hollow square about the camp on thehill

body and broke before theyvere one third of the way up the hillbut they came so close that at pointsthere was almost a hand to hand struggle The officers tised their re-volvers Three Spaniards got throughthe open formation to the edgeof the camp Col Jose Carapinnthe Cuban guide discharged his revolver and they turning and findingthemselves without support ran belterskelter down the reverse side of thehill It was during this assault thatAssistant Surgeon Gibbs was killedHe was shot in the head in front of hisown tent the farthest point of attackHe fell into the arms of PrivateSullivan and

the outposts word came of the finding of thebody of Sergt Smith He was reported as having been killed at fiveoclock on the previous day but it appears that he had been seen alive atten o clock in the evening When andhow he was killed no one knows atthis writing Neither had the menbeen mustered nor had the outposts ofLieut Neville and Shaw been relievedLieut Col Huntington and MajCockrell gave high praise to the nerveand steadiness of officers and men especially the young ones as the engagement was a baptism of fire for alarge majority The men were indarkness and in a strange land butthey stood to their posts with courageand fortitude and there was no sympton of panicThe marines though very much exhausted were eager for more fightingpromising to inflict heavy punishmentThey complimented the daring of theSpaniards with characteristic campprofanitySunday the amplest precautions weretaken and as the Dauntless left reinforcements were landing from theMarblehead A stormy time was expectedEstimates vary as to the attackingforce some say 200 and the figures runas high as 1000 CoL Campina theCuban guide said the Spaniards weremostly irregulars but the reports ofthe discharge of Mauser rifles wouldindicate that they were regulars asmost of the guerillas carry Remingtons The Cuban guerillas as a rulehave more dash and courage than theregulaisThe new campaign uniforms provesatisfactory and are almost invisibleat a distance oi 200 yards The Leeguns caused several accidents in drawing cartridges Corporal Glass shattered his handDespite the loss of the men which iskeenly regretted the marines rejoicethat they have been engaged in theirfirst fight on Cuban soil They sailedfrom New York the day war was declared and expected to land within aweek at Havana Since

WasrHobsons The American AdmiralConsiders the Deed One of theBravest Since CushingsWashington June 13 The navy department Saturday posted the following bulletin giving a detailed officialreport from Adm Sampson upon theheroism of Lieut Hobson and hismen in sinking the Merrimac in theSantiago channelUnited States Flagship NewYork Off Santiago June 3 1898Permit me to call your special attention to Assistant Naval ConstructorHobson As stated in a special telegram before coming here I decided tomake the harbor entrance secureagainst the possibility of egress bySpanish ships by obstructing thenarrow part of the entrance bysinking a collier at that point Uponcalling upon Mr Hobson for his professional opinion as to a sure methodof sinking the ship he manifested themost lively interest in the problemAfter several days consideration hepresented n solution which he considered would insure the immediate sinking of the ship when she reached thedesired point in the channelThis plan we prepared for executionwhen we reached Santiago The plancontemplated a crew of only sevenmen and Mr Hobson who beggedthat it might be intrusted to himThe anchor chains were arranged ondeck for both the anchors forward andaft the plan includiug the anchoringof the ship almost automaticalhAs soon as I reached Santiago and Ihad the collier to work upon and thedetails were completed and diligentlyprosecuted hoping to complete themin one day as the moon and tide servedbest the first night after our arrivalNotwithstanding every effort the hourof 4 oclock in the morning arrivedand the preparation was scarcely completed After a careful inspection ofthe final preparations I was forced torelinquish the plan for that morningas dawn was breaking Mr Hobsonbegged to try it at all hazardsThis morning proved more propitious as a prompt start could be madeNothing could have been more gallantly executed We waited impatiently after the firing b the Spaniards had ceased When they did not re appear fromthe harbor at 6 oclock I feared thatthey had all perished A steam launchwvjch had been sent in charge of NavalUadet Powell to rescue the men appeared at this time coming out undera persistent fire of the batteries butbrought none of the crew A carefulinspection of the harbor from this shipshowed that the vessel Merrimac hadbeen sunk in the channel gThis afternoon the chief of staff ofAdm Cervera came out under a flagof truce with a letter from the admiral extolling the bravery of thecrew in an unusual matterI can not myself too earnestly express my appreciation of the conductof Mr Hobson and his gallant crewI venture to say that a more brave anddaring thing has not been done sinceCushing blew up the AlbermarleReferring to the inspiring letterwhich you addressed to the officers atthe beginning of the war I am sureyou will offer a suitable professionalreward to Mr Hobson and his companionsI must add that Commander J MMiller relinquished his command withthe very greatest reluctance believinghe would retain his command underall circumstances He was howeverfinally convinced that the attemptof another person to carry out thenultitude of details which had been inpreparation by Mr Hobson might endanger its proper execution I therefore took the liberty to relieve him forthis reason only There were hundreds of volunteers who were anxiousto participate there were 150 fromthe Iowa nearly as many from thisship and large numbers from all theother ships officers and men alikeSignedW T SampsonUseless to Talk of PeaceMadrid June 13 Several Spanishgenerals are quoted as sajing thatSpain can continue the war in Cubafor two years and that it is useless totalk of peace unless on the basis ofstatus quo ante bellum Political circles declare no suggestions

or five failures by the man withthe flag of truce and disappeared inan instant afterward among- the treesCHAPTER XXITHE ATTACKAs soon as Silver disappeared thecaptain who had been closely watching him turned toward the interior ofthe house and found not a man of us atLis post but Gray It was the first timewe had ever seen him angryQuarters he roared And then aswe all slunk back to our places Grayhe said Ill put jour name in the logyouve stood by your duty like a seaman Mr Trelawney Im surprised atyou sir Doctor I thought j ou hadworn the kings coat If that was howyou served at Fontenoj sir youd havebeen better in your berthThe doctors watch were all back attheir loop holes the rest were busyloading the spare muskets and everyone with a red face you may be certainand a flea in his ear as the saying isThe captain looked on for awhile insilence Then he spokeMy lads he said Ive givenSilver a broadside I pitched it in redhot on purpose and before the hoursout as he said we shall be boardedWere outnumbered 1 neednt tell youthat but we fight in shelter and aminute ago I should have said wefought with discipline Ive no mannerof doubt that we can drub them if youchooseThen he werft the rounds and sawas he said that all was clearOn the two short sides of the houseeast and west there were onlj twoloop holes on the south side where1he porch was two again and on thenorth side five There was a roundscore of muskets for the seven of usthe firewood had been built into foxirpiles tables you might say oneabout the middle of each side and oneach of these tables some ammunitionand four loaded muskets were laidready to the hand of the defenders Inthe middle the cutlasses lay rangedToss out the fire said the captainthe chill is past and we mustnt havesmoke in our eyesThe iron fire basket was carriedbodily out by Mr Trelawney and theembers smothered among sandHawkins hasnt had his breakfastHawkins help yourself and back toyour post to eat it continued CaptSmollett Lively now my lad youllwant it before youve done Hunterserve out a round of brandy to allhandsAnd while this was going on the cap-tain completed in his own mind theplan of the defenseDoctor you will take the door heresumed See and dont expose yourself keep within and fire through theporch Hunter take the east sidethere Joyce you stand by the westmy man Mr Trelawney you are thebest shot you and Gray take this longnorth side with the five loop holesits there the danger is If they can getup to it and fire in upon us throughour own ports things would begin tolook dirty Hawkins neither you norI are much account at the shootingwell stand by to load and bear a handAs the captain had said the chillwas past As soon as the sun hadclimbed above our girdle of trees itfell with all its force upon the clearing and drank up the vapors at adraught Soon the sand was bakingand the resin melting in the logs of theblock house Jackets and coats wereflung aside shirts were thrown openat the neck and rolled up to theshoulders and we stood there each athis post in a fever of heat and anxietyAn hour passed awayHang them said the captainThis is as dull as the doldrums Graywhistle for a windAnd just at that moment eame thefirst news of the attackIf you please sir said Joyce ifI see anyone am I to fireI told you so cried the captainThank you sir returned Joycewith the same quiet civilityNothing followed for a time but theremark had set us all on the alertstraining ears and eyes the musketeers with their pieces balanced n theirhands the captain out in the middle ofthe block house with his mouth verytight and a frown on his faceSo some seconds passed till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket andfired The report had scarcely diedaway ere it was repeated and repeatedfrom without in a scattering volleyshot behind shot like a string of geesefrom every side of the inclosure Several bullets struck the log house butnot one entered and as the smokecleared away and vanished the stockade and the woods around it lookedas quiet aud empty as before Not abough waved not the gleam of a musket barrel betrayed the presence of ourfoesPXfJTHE BOUSBON NEWS PARISDid you hit your man asked thecaptainNo sir replied Joyce 1 believenot sirNext best thing- to tell the truthmuttered Capt Smollett Load hisg un Hawkins How many should yousay there were on j our side doctorI know precisely said Dr LiveseyThree shots were fired on this sideI saw the three flashes two close tog-etherone further to the westThree repeated the captain Andhow many on yours Mr TrelawneyBut this was not so easily answeredThere had come many from the northseven by the squires computationeight or nine according- to Gray Fromthe east and west only a single shothad been fired It was plain thereforethat the attack would be developedfrom the north and that on the otherthree sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities ButCapt Smollett made no change in hisarrangements If the mutineers succeeded in crossing- the stockade he argued they would take possession ofany unprotected loop hole and shoot usdown like rats in our strongholdNor had we much time left to us forthought Suddenly with a loud huzzaa little cloud of pirates leaped from thewoods on the north side and ranHa roared aloud and his hangar wont up overhis beadstraight on the stockade At the samemoment the fire was once more openedfrom the woods aud a rifle ball sungthrough the doorway and knocked thedoctors musket into bitsThe boarders swarmed over the fencelike monkeys Squire and Gray firedagain and yet again three men fellone forward into the inclosure twoback on the outsille But of these onewas evidently more frightened thanhurt for he was on his feet again in acrack and instantly disappearedamong the treesTwo had bit the dust one had fledfour had made good their footing inside our defenses while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight meneach evidently supplied with severalmuskets kept up a hot though uselessfire on the log houseThe four who had boarded madestraight before them for the buildingshouting as they ran and the menamong the trees shouted back to encourage them Several shots werefired but such was the hurry of themarksmen that not one appeared tohave taken effect In a moment thefour pirates had swarmed tip themound and were upon usThe head of Job Anderson the boatswain appeared at the mid die loopholeAt em all hands he roared ina voice of thunderAt the same moment another pirategrasped Hunters musket by the muzzle wrenched it from his handsplucked it through the loophole andwith one stunning blow laid the poorfellow senseless on the floor Meanwhile a third running unharmed allround the house appeared suddenly inthe dooiway and fell with his cutlasson the doctorOur position was utterly reversedA moment since we were firing undercover at an exposed enemy now itwas we who lay uncovered and couldnot return a blowThe log house was full of smoke towhich we owed our comparative safetyCries and confusion the flashes andreports of pistol shots and one loudgroan rang in my earsOut lads out and fight em in theopeui Cutlasses cried the captainI snatched a cutlass from the pileand some one at the same time snatching another gave me a cut acrossthe knuckles which I hardly felt Idashed out of the door into the clearsunlight Some one was close behindI know not who

Nextmoment I was face to face with Anderson He roared aloud and his hangerwent up above his head flashing in thesunlight I had not time to be afraidbut as the blow still hung impendingleaped in a

formidable American fleet has been assembled consisting of 16 warships ofvarious classes headed by the big battle ship Indiana which for all roundeffectiveness stands at the head of thenavy This fleet is assembled at PortTampa and is to serve as a convoyfor the troop transports from thatpoint The formation of this formidable convoy fleet is due to the reports more or less indefinite thatSpanish ships were lurking betweenFlorida and Cuba with a view of intercepting the troop transports Thenavy department has not given seriouscredit to these reports yet they weremore or less circumstantial In orderto avoid the slightest possibility of adash by some Spanish ships againstthe troop transports this new fleet of16 war ships was determined uponWhether it was ordered from Washington or was due to the precautionarymeasures of the officials in command in the south is not disclosed It is known only that Commodore llemey commander of the navalbase at Key West has brought together this powerful fleet of convoys It isstrong enough both in numbers ofships of individual ships and armament to cope with an3 Spanish warship that might be at large in theWest Indies and it entirely eliminatesany possible danger that might attendthe transporting of the army of invasion to Cuba Capt Tayloiwho commands the Indiana isavailable as commander of this squadron although it is not disclosed definitely who will be its chief Commodore Watson is with the blockadingfleet off Havana and can not well baspared from that position which willbe maintained efficiently notwithstanding the drafts made to createthis large convoy squadron CaptTaylor is regarded as one of the mostjudicious and capable officers in theservice and should the squadron command fall on him it is felt that it willbe in good hands The Indiana willprobably be the flag ship of the convoysquadron There probably will bebattle ships but it is not deemed advisable for prudential reasons to givethe full list of the ships in exact detail The Indiana is considered one ofthe most formidable slaips afloat being regarded by naval experts as superior as a fighting machine to theships of the Terrible class in the British navy

transports containing the army of invasion for Santiagowas collected just outside of Tampawaiting for a proper escort Thestories of the phantom Spanish jfleetwhich no subordinate officers believeat

comingAs you read the rhyme I writeYou can hear his hoofs low drummingDay and nightYou can hear the distant drummingAs the clock goes tick-a-tackAnd the chiming of the hoursIs the music of his packYou may hardly note their growling1Underneath the noonday sunBut at night you hear them howlingAs they runAnd they never check or falterFor they never miss their killSeasons change and systems alterBut the hunt Is running stillHark the evening chime Is playingOer the long gray town it pealsDont you hear the death hound bayingAt your heelsWhere is there an earth or burrowWhere a cover left for youA year a week perhaps to morrowBrings the huntsmans death hallooDay by day he gains upon usAnd the most that we can claimIs that when the hounds are on usWe die gameAnd somewhere dwells the MasterBy whom it was decreedHe sent the savage huntsmanHe bred the snow white steedThese hounds which run foreverHe set them on your trackHe hears you scream hut neverCalls them backHe does not heed our

forhaying been misled Her husband nevertroubled his head about these flirtatious being assured quite vighUy thatshe was a good woman He was notjealous she on the o flier hand waspossessed of a

peril but also the high regardin which he is held by the men underhis command It was during the springof 18S7 when Commodore Dewey thena captain had command of the flagshipPensacola a sailing vessel in the Mediterranean While en route from Athens to the coast of Spain the vessel encountered a series of short but violentsqualls which not only greatly retarded her progress but proved intenselywearing on the crewOne night when the inconsistency ofthe weather was particularly annojingthe officer of the watch happened to bea young lieutenant who wasWery unpopular with the men being what istermed in nautical vernacular abucko Several times during thewatch all hands had been called toshorten sail and they were naturallyvery much exhausted from racing backand forth from the decks to the upperrigging Finally the order was given tomake sail and the tired sailors setabout to put it into execution Butafter the Avork had been accomplishedand all hands had come down fromaloft it occurred to the officer that themen had not exhibited sufficient alacrity to suit him and advancing to thebreak of the poop speaking trumpet inhand he thundered a torrent of epithets at the crew following it up withan ordr to lay aloft and go throughthe tactics of shortening sail by ofdrill Unfortunately however he hadhad failed to reckon upon the inbornspirit of the American sailors and righthere their forebearance forsook themand not a man of their number madea movement to execute the overbearingorder Wildly flourishing his trumpetthe now frenied martinet threatenedand cursed and stormed but to no availthe blood of tKe crew was up and theycursed back ridiculed laughed him toscorn Suddenly the sea and sky wereseen to grow darker to windward andit was clear that another squall was imminentAlive to the danger to which the shipwith all her canvas spread was exposed the lieutenan t retreated from histhreatening attitude and tirged entreated implored the men to save thevessel but in vain they had beendriven to sheer desperation and onlyscoffed at him the more Onward camethe tempest its fierceness foretold bythe livid shafts of lightning which repeatedly flashed from its inky depthsThe lieutenant in despair had sunk tohis knees with his face in his handsawaiting the inevitable doom Suddenly from out the cabin companionway a form emerged It was the captain In an instant his glance had takenin all the approaching storm the defiant crew the suppliant officer theflapping sails and then clear and loujirang out his order All hands shortensail That was all But it was sufficient Before the last word of thatcommand had been uttered the riggingwas full of flying sailors cheering theircaptain as they sped to their taskand in a twinkling every foot of canvashad been stowed and the ship placedunder bare poles Even before thevcould regain the decks the gale burstupon the vessel demonstrating only toothe fate another moments delay would have hurled upon herWhen the shock had passed and thecrew had assembled in readiness toobey the next order Capt Dewey addressed his first words to the officer ofthe deck Go to your room he saidThen turning to the crew he commanded without the least suspicion ofrebuke in his tones Boatswain pipedown St Louis Globe DemocratBRITISH BOOTSSome That Were Evidently Meant forCavalry Not InfantryServiceThere is likely to be serious troublefor somebody in connection with theignominious collapse of the boots furnished to the British troops in Sir Herbert Kitcheners Soudan expeditionThe matter has been ventilated so thoroughly in the press that it will be impossible to avoid investigation Thecommanding officers of all regimentshavejbeen asked to send in full reportson their boots but the facts are already well known In a word 45 percent of the boots of the British brigadewere worn out before they reached Berber and out of the 400 men who hadto be put in boats at and before theyreached Berber the greater proportionhad to go by river not because theywere sick but because they had noboots to walk in This collapse in bootstook place after six weeks wear andwas due to the soles coming away fromthe boots on account of their havingbeen sewn on instead of riveted It isadmitted that men had a great deal ofroute marching before they started ontheir march to Kunur but it i arguedthat however energetic a generalmaybe he ought not to be able to walk theboots off his mens feet in six weeksFortunately the Sirdar was able to letthe British brigade have 350 pairs ofEgyptian boots and it is said that themen liked them better than their ownIf Mahmoud had moved more quicklythan he did and the British brigadahad been required as was fully expected to march at once up the Atbara 45per cent wouia have had to

amount of milk wasinsufficiento pay running expenses and the natural consequence was failure Whiiicreameries pay they can only be madeto pay with plenty of milk and in working up a cooperative creamery one othe first items to look after is the suppljof milk The farmers must not onljkeep cows but they must keep gooddairy cows and be willing to sell thmilk at a fair price and there mustbe asufficient number of cows to keep thtcreamery running every day Malesure of the cows before undertaking thtbuilding Another cause is the investof too much money Too high 1price is paid to the promoters of thescheme The dairy business is of slowgrowth and if after a careful canvasthe milk of only300 cows can be received it is rather poor economy to invest in a building and machinery tcwork up the milk of 500 cows Then besure that considering quality you arpaying a fair priceOne of the schemes worked that hascaused more failures than any other isto induce the farmers and business mento
