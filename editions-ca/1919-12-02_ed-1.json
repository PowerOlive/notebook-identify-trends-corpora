Notabie-Screen Offering Peculiar in
Moral and Appeal.
(By Enoch Grehan)
"The Miracle Man," with Thomas
Meighan Nand Betty Compson in the
leading roles, will catch .the fancy
of photo connoisseurs as few screen
productions have been able to do
since the "Crisis," "Birth of a -Nation"
and similar masterpieces chal
lenged popular attention.
Unlijte the photoplays here men
tioned', ' "The Miracle Man" depends
rather upon finished delineation in
the silent drama than upoh spectac
ular effect, and in that peculiar
sense, thereforelis a -superior work
of art. But in still other, senses 'ft
is a more impressive .screen narra
tive than its more widely, known
predecessors, -"it tells a remarkable
story with transcendant emphases
and serves to disclose in , Thomas
Meighan and Betty Compson virtues
in the field of ingenuous and natural
delineation that other vehicles en
trusted to their keeping aid not
hitherto" brought to, light.
The perfervid imagination of a
public pitched to high, key of1 expec
lation by the industrious- activity of
an ingenious press agent sometimes
lecoils with" disappointment at not
finding a great "moral" or a great
50c
3c War Tax 25c
"lesson" in photoplays like "The
Miracle Man" and its .krnd, but
frankly spea'king, in thismorthan
remarkable screen offering there-arc
both a moral and a-leson.
On6 would-be a generous critic in
deed if he found in it sufficient basis
for the assertion that it is either a
great work of art or an unusual
story, but there is in it that which
somehow goes with the spectator tr
his home, thence to his pillowy and
he may not .be unduly surprised if it
even intrude upon his sleeping hour
with its' searching memory of noble
conflict between righteousness and
sin; between love and lust and the
final triumph of faith Jike unto the
faith of those who are said to have
some to scoff but remained to praise.
