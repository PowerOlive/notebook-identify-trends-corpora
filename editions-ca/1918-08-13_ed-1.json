Railroad men passing along the
railroad tracks in the rear of the
residence of Mr. John Merringer, Sr.,
on South Main street, at an early
hour yesterday morning, discovered
the 'body of Mr. Merringer lying in
a path in shis garden, where he had
been, at work for some time. They
notified the members of the family,
who were at home, and an investiga
tion disclosed the fact that he was
dead. Death resulted from heart
disease superinduced by Bright's

extensive truck garden an the prop
erty on Houston avenue, which is
now built up in residences. The de
ceased assisted his parents In culti
vating their gardens, which became
noted in this section for the quality
of their products. Some years ago
he engaged in the truck garden bus
iness, having purchased a small farm
on the CHntonville pike, near Paris.
The insidious disease which had
fastened on him compelled him to re
tire1 from active work some time ago,
and he disposed of his farm, re
turning to Paris to reside. Mr. Mer
ringer was a straight-forward, up
right citizen who had many 'friends
who will regret his passing. -

wife, who was formerly Miss Annie
Connelly, two daughters, Miss Annie
Merringer and Mrs. Earl Culbertson,
and three sons,. Councilman John
Merrfnger, Mr. William Merringer
and Mr. James Merringer, all of
