Fifth Thursday Thanksgiving
Day.
President Taft has designated Thurs
day, November 30, as Thanksgiving
Day this year. It has been the custom
to fix the last day of the month. This
year there has been doubt, because
November happened to include five
instead of four Thursdays. The White
House has been besieged by theatrical
managers and those in charge of col
lege football games to settle this
doubt, so that arrangements could be
made for the usual tpecial perform
ances and sport that marks the day.

Mr. Todd's report on the inspection
ot accounts and affairs of the State

very lengthy one, and the inspection
covers a period of the last three fiscal
years. So far as is known, it 13 the
first official inspection that has been
made by the State Inspector of the
State University. There are some
interesting statements in connection
with the report which will be of inter
est to the people of the State.
