Who said "Bill" Hart's blood was cold?
"Breed of Men" proves that this doughty Westerner has a heart
through which flows a flood of romance as warm as any man's.
See what chances he takes for a girl in "Breed of Men" and, above
all things, see the last chance he takes, when the blood runs to- his face,
and he asks THE BIG QUESTION!
There are a hundred scenes to make "Breed of Men" worth while
but the climax! See it.
