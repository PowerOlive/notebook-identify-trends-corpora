O joy sweet spring is hereThough keen and cold is still the windAnd all the earth lies bleak and drearAnd icy bonds the streams still bindThe scent of buds and coming flowersIs in the air and fills my heartAnd soon the woods and leafy bowersWill in new life and beauty startFrom yonder hedge first of his clanA bird begins his song to singAs though he would do all he canTo welcome back the sweet new springThat spring is here scarce need be toldAnd soon the trees will all be greenAnd nature robed in green and goldStand out in all her glorious sheenFor from the sere leaves at my feetA modest violet lifts its headAnd with a fragrance passing sweetIt warns m heed well where I treadAnd here too at my feet I seeA daffodil with golden bellAs though about to ring with gleeThe gladsome news It comes to tellrAnd earth so long in slumber deepStirs dreamily as if to wakeFrom its protracted frozen sleepAnd from its icy bondage breakAnd soon the newly wakened powerWill in each bush and tree be stirredA nd throb in every charming flowerAnd in the song note of each birdSo lessons sweet and full of graceLifes darkest hours will surely bringSome flower of hope will show its faceSome bird of promise

evidently intended for the cherub who had justvisited him In one corner was theartists name Marie Wendall Jotting it down in his note book and passing his hand over his forehead and eyesas though to

rate price instead of a double rate Also thatcoops must be strong- and slatted andnot injured by other packages beingpiled on them If the coop is sufficiently strong expressmen have no objection to coops being lined inside withi ioth to protect birds from a draftThe coop illustrated above is four feetlong two feet wide and 20 inches highmade entirely of laths excepting thebottom and the boards around thebase which are four inches wide of bottom box stuff The laths ou the sidesare securely nailed to nosts which areoL one inch square spruce Such acoop will carry any amount of merchandise

Tor a night or until well settledagain then exchange the false for fresheggs Keep a supply of shelled corncontinually in this sitting house thathens may fec d at their pleasure and getback to egg

LiberallyWith all stock that is to be keptthrough the winter it will be found easier as well as more economical tojeeepan animal thrifty than to allow it torun down in condition and then attemptto feed it up This is especially thecase at this season when dry feed mustbe largely depended uponOf course the cost must always beconsidered as it is an item to feed andkeep in a good thrifty condition at aslow a cost as possible At the sametime it should be rememberd that it isnever good economy to stint the feed atthe expense of growthWith young and growing stock andiii fact with all that are to be keptthrough the winter it will be found agood plan to allow them to run outevery day that the weather will permitbut at the same time too much dependence should not be placed upon theamount of feed that they will secure inthe pasturesGenerally it will be found a good planto gradually increase the ration nightand morning at this time the amountto be largely determined by the condition of the animals If good shelter isprovided and they have been kept up ina good thrifty condition less grain isneeded than when the stock are exposed to cold or storms or have been allowed to run down in condition Ofcourse roughness is usually cheaperthan grain and one of the advantagesin providing a comfortable shelter isthat it lessens the grain rations and ifcare is taken to make the shelter dryand comfortable a very light grain ration niht and morning will keep in agood condition But care must be takennow to keep a watch on the stock otherwise they may begin to fail and this implies more or less of a loss and underpresent conditions if farming is to bemade profitable every item must beconsidered with growing stock theircondition must be such that a steadygain can be maintained until

question whether it is betterto manure for land or for crop is notmuch asked nowadays The loss of original fertility of soil and the narrowinoprofits on crops require that farmers inthese times should get as nearly full returns as possible from all the manurethey apply If they manure at all forthe future it is by seeding with cioverwhen they apply the fertilizer so thatpart of its benefit shall remain in theclover roots Besides this seededground does not waste fertility eitherby washing or blowing away as thatleft naked in winter is sure to doYoung growing animals are the mostorofitable rFURNISH COLLAR BUTTONSModern Laundries Damase the StreetVendors BusinessModern methods in at least one lineof business have struck a blitheringswipe at the sidewalk merchant who patiently stands for hours on a downtowiicorner trying to sell collar and shirtbuttons Nobody ever tHiinks of buyingany buttons from the luckless man be- icause everyone wno patronizes a laundry gets buttons for nothing and inthe course of a few months lays themup by the grss says the Chicago ChronicleSome time ago when a shirt came fromthe laundry it had beside tlie greasefrom the ironing machine and the inkfrom the markers table two pins thrustdesperately through the stretched linenholding the bosom and back of the garment in place There are no more pinssent home with shirts Some brightlaundryman started a new era by furnishing small metal buttons wlhieli are Islipped into aill the button holes of theshirt caaising it to hold its shape perfectly The other laundrymen were notslow to follow and now half the men jon the street wear these little charity ibuttons for shirt studs They are madeof lead or some similar soft metal andevidently do not cost much for shirtsare done up cheaper and done up moreby the way than they were -when thehumble but serviceable pins were usedSo therefore the patient street salesman finds a slow market with a downward tendency for his collar buttonsA Wonderful
