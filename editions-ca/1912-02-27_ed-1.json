Daughters Favor Substitute Bill.
Richard Hawes Chapter, United
Daughters of the Confederacy have
expressed themselves as being heartily
in favor of the Substitute Bill, provid
ing benefits for the Confederate Vet
erans of Kentucky, -and at a recent
meeting of the committee resolutions
commending the bill were adopted.
The resolutions are as follows :
We, the Richard Hawes Chapter U.
D. C, do heartily endorse and com
mend the Substitute Bill for the bene
fit of all Confeierate Veterans.
First, because the veterans of the
late war have waited long and patient
ly for proper recognition of their sac
rifice and service.
Second, we believe that our great
Commonweatlh ought rot to do such a
great thing in such a small way as the
original bill proposes. That she should
show a spirit as magnanimous as her
sons were partiotic and self sacrific-"
ing.
Third, the dted should be a reccgni
tion of valor, devotion and noble en
durance rather than an act of charity
toward the suffering. The fame of old
Kentucky is involved as well as the
wants and worth of her Confederate
rons. Let her show herself great and
impartial to her soldiers who were
volunteers, whose rewards should be
medals of honor and not humiliating
appropriations of a charitable charact
er. Let them all have at the hands of
the Legislature the same benefit,
whether they accept them or transfer
them lo those more needy.
We, the Daughters, heartily endorse
and earnestly request our own repre
sentatives and all Legislators to en
dorse the Substitute Confederate bill.

through the entire time. This rrear.s
the pooling of the products of nerly
100,000 farmers in Kentucky, Ohio and
Indiana.
Warehouses and factories will be
built in several places. A co-operative
factory costing $2,500,000 will be built
in Lexington during tne coming
season.
Farmers connected with the organiza
tion produce an average of 300 mil
lion pounds annually. The society
originally was formed to fight the to
bacco trust and is five years old.

THEATRICAL.
"THE SMART SET" COMING.
"There is nothing so human as laugh
ter, and in the present production of
"The Smart Set" in "The Mayor of
New Town" there are no less than one
hundred and fifty minutes ; each one a
laugh, a sons? or a comedy minute, and
which even a judge and jury of
grouches would find guitly of inciting
a riot of laughter. Specializing such
fun producers as Salem Tutt Whitney,
who able critics pronounce the peer ol
all negro comedians and J. Homer
Tutt, who is an able asistant and Miss
Ethel Marshal, a winsome prima don
na, together with a cast which includes
Edward Tolliver, Sam Gardner, Will
Dixon, Al Strouder, J. C. Wright, W.
Blaine Walters, Nettie Taylor, Mabelle
Brown, Helen Chisraan, Grace Kneff,
Babe Brown, Nina Marshall. There
will be twenty-one muiscal numbers
and a full scenic and electrical produc
tion add usual big singing ''Smart
Set" chorus coining, to the Grand for
one night, Monday, March 4.
and cake. The tables were beautifully
decorated with white and crimson
carnations. All of the young people of
the town and community and several
out of town guests were present,
among wbic .were the following:
Misses ArderyGoddard, Litsey, Red
witz, Divine, Koberts, Miller, Stivers,
Vallandinghair , Higgina and Houston,
of Bourbon C liege, Pais;Mrs. Smoot,
Miss Matild-' James and Mr. Cox,
Paris; Miss L. rrine Wheeler and Mr.
Luther I and, Lexington ; Mr. Offutt
Blackburn, Georgetown.
Tne ten-year pool wll close on
March I.
In order, therefore, to give every
grower of tobacco in Bourbon county
an opportunity to become a member of
said pool, or at least to fully under
stand its plans, I will be at the office
of the Burley Tobacco Society, in the
basement of the Court House, in Paris,
on Tuesday and Wednesday, Feb. 27
and 28, for the purpose of giving such
information as may be desired, and
taking the pledges of such as may de
sire to join the pool.
And, finally, as the last opportunity,
a mass meeting, or rally, of the tobac
co men of the county, will be held on
Thursday, Feb. 29.
Let us have a large attendance and
full discussion of the situation.
Many believe, with good cause, we
think, that the present market for to
bacco has been largely influenced by
the agitation of the ten-year pool, and
this we think, becomes more apparent
as the price is advanced as the day for
closing the pool approaches.
If these are facts, is not the Burley
Tobacco Company, in which all the 1909
poolers are asked to leave their 10 per
cent stock subscription, worth its cost
many times over?
Is it not wise for the tobacco growers
of Kentucky to keep this company in
existence?
This is a matter of vital importance.
Come into Paris and lets discuss the
matter together. We will have no
outside speakers, but a simple business
like discussion of the situation.
Come, then, on either of the days
named, and if yov are unwilling to sign
the ten-year pool you certainly will be
willing to agree that your 10 per cent
stock subscription in 1909 pool may be
held by the Burley Tobacco Company
for the purpose of starting a manufact
ory of tobacco, as well as creating a
strong company that will at all times
be ready to battle for the growers
against the trust.
