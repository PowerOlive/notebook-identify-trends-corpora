A news dispatch from St. Louis tells
of the withdrawal of the four Catholic
bridesmaids from the wedding party of
Miss Cora South Brown, who is well
known in Paris, having frequently
visited here, because the prospective
bridegroom has been divorced. The
dispatch is as follows:
"Four of the Catholic bridesmaids
announced for the wedding of NVilliam
Glasgow O'Fallon and Miss CoraScuth
Brown, 'the most photographed beauty
in St. Louis,' granddaughter of the
late Governor John Young Brown, of
Kentucky, have withdrawn because the
prospective bridergoom has been di
vorced. "The bridesmaids are Misses Lucille
Cates. Miriam Bonist, Virignia Zeibig
and Harriett Lamotte.
"Miss Brown's family is Episcopa
lian and on account of the divorce th1
marriage will take place April 25 in
St. John's Methodist Episcopal church,
of which John J. O'Fallon, great grand
father of the bridegroom, was one of
the founders.
"O'Fallon owns a ranch at Mercedes
Texas, and he met a pretty divorcee in
San Antonio. O'Fallon was then only
20 years old. They were married after
a short acquaintance, and lived togeth
er six weeks. He returned to St. Louis
and his wife obtained a divorce a year
ago on the ground of desertion.
"O'Fallo is a stepson of NV. S. Mc
Chesner, Jr., general manager of the
Terminal Railroad Association.
"Mrs. John Young Brown, the
bride's mother explained to-night that
none of the girls mentioned as with
drawing as bridesmaids for her daugh
ter were asked to serve, since they
were informed that the bridegroom
was divorced of the church, and it was
decided to request the following to
serve as bridesmaids :
"Misses Malotte Houser, Louise Nu
gent, Irene Clifford, St. Louis; Grace
Hays, Nashville, Trr. ; Caroline
