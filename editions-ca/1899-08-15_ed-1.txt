bringing on death and on a sudden hilthe guard next to use on the face with allmy force Down he went like an ox and Imade a rash to the tent door little doubting that I should be cut down and put outof my miser But they were too quick Jwas one and they were many In a bandturn 1 was tripped up my wrists securelyfSstened behind my back and any furtherresistance on my part impossible The manwhom I felled scrambled up and attemptedto brain me with the butt of his spike as Jwent down but Braccio struck him senseless with the hilt of his sword and this timeie lay in a huddled heap quiet enough1 besought Braccio to give me my paroleswearing on the faith of a gentleman on thehonor of a Sarelli that I would not attemptescape and would go with him quietly if Iweie but fi ee from the ignominy of the cordsthat bound meShut the cage door keep your bird helaughed brutally I have to answer for jouto morrow and 1 weigh the faith of a gentleman and the honor God save the markof a Savelli as that he snapped his fingers when it comes to a consideration ofBraccio Kortebraccios head So yourknighthood must even go as you are withmy loveknots on 3Tou Here two of youtake charge of this tent and see after Arnulf there I never thought his skull so thinmarchAnd in this manner was I led out two menin front of me two behind one on eitherhand all with their weapons ready whilstthe provost himself brought up the rearwith his drawn sword in one hand and alighted torch in the other Not that lightwas needed for the moon had risen andwas in its full I believe however thatBraccio held the torch so that the additional light might the more clearly show who hisprisoner was and I hung down my head aswith quick steps we marched to the military prisonQui vive la the challenge rang outcrisply and on the instant the provost replied France and TremouillePass on and the sentry one of Bucicaults arquebusiers looked at us curiouslyas we went by And now to add to myshame we met face to face a group of laterevelers returning to the campDiablo called out a gay voice ourrespectable provost is at work I see Whathave you got there Braccio1 shuddered for I recognized Bellegarde- young noble of the Franche Compte whohad come to seek glory in the Italian warClose up men another of my strayedlambs brought back to the fold Visoompte- pardon me it is late and I must hurryonBut Bellegarde was merry with wineNot til you have drunk our health helaughed barring the way with his drawnrapier as he added Lowenthal here hasa skin of wine from the Ilhineland have apull t it man and let us see the

Bracciowhispered to BellegardeMy God -aid the latter and thenhastily Come on Lowenthal Let themHTOLet der brisoner drink Would you debrife a boor man of his liquor repliedLowenthal and to bide my face I seized theskin and raised it to my lips Even Braccioheld the torch away and Von Lowenthalfailed to recognize me in the half light Mythroat wS red hot with thirst and sick as Iwas with shame 1 drank greedily andhanded the wine skin to the GermanBKtzen he said giving it a shake youNow heir brodrink Uke an honest manvost a health to Germany m honest German wine What No Then drink to derhalter man and Lowenthal will knightyou swaying to and fro he attempted todraw his swordMatters were at a crisis for Braccio wasnot to be trifled with any longer M thisjuncture Bellegarde and the others withhim again intervened and dragged onLowenthal away The provost instantlyrressd forwards with a hurried good nightWe fast however as not todid not go soperceive from the noises behind us that theLanzknecht had subsided to earth and wasapparently abandoned there with hi winehkm by his companions The sound of hisvoice engaged in a drunken monologuereached usDcr rascal Braccio der knight of dernoose und halter I will gif him der accolade 1 But we lost the rest as we hurried on the guards smiling to themselvesand Braccio very ill temperedIn a few paces we passed DAlegreV headquarters and through an open window Isaw half a dozen of my late companions playing at dice and heard Hawkwoods basscalling the mains A few steps more broughtus to our point a fortified wing of the VillaAccolti itself and Braccio thrusting me intoa strong room turned the key of the doorand with a giuff order which I did notcatch walked away Now indeed was Iin a distressful state and the agony of mymind so great that I heeded not the pain ofthe cords but paced up and down like anycaged animal I fully recognized that I wasthe victim of a deeply laid plot on the partof DEntrangues and saw clearly that Iwas completely in his hands It was astroke of genius on his part not to interferein any way to save his creature the wretchedTarbes That hasty order of DAlejrres hadremoved the only danger of his scheme being laid bare I tried to think out some planof action but to no purpose for my mindWas altogether confused and bewilderedami I was incapable of thought The roomin which 1 was confined was bare of all furniture not even a camp stool There wasonly one window and that iron grated wasset high up near the ceiling The moonlight Btraggled through the grating in longwhite ribbons and dimly showed up thewalls around me Hour alter hour passedaway I could hear the occasional barkingof dogs tv distant cries of the sentinels asthey called to one another and the soundoi the guard being relieved at my doorThen the moon sank and the morning cameFrom s lieer weariness i threw myself on thelie v and fell into a troubled sleep fromwhich J was aroused by the cords bitinginto my flesh This and the constrainedposition in which my arms were held gavetortuie I attempted bv shouting to attract the attention of the sentic 1 over mebut though I heard the clod tramping upand down I recerVed no answerAt about noon Braccio entered the eellie informed me that my affair was to bedealt with by the duke in person and that Ishould make ready to go with him I repliedthat 1 was prepared to go at once andv ithoul more ado was escorted to the mambuilding of the villa I could see th it a considerable crowd was collected and from thelitters and riding horses that were being ledto ami fro perceived that some ladies hadheard the news ami were come to gratifytheir curiosity at my expense and see suchtriads as I was to undergo I was led intothe great nail which was full of people andin the gallery above the dais saw amongstother ladies the Duchess de la Tremouilleand by her side Mme dEntrangues Thelatter kept her eyes down and tanned herself with a fan of peacock feathers whicheven at tiiat moment 1 was able to recognizeas my gift On the dais was a table withseats set about it which were as yet emptyAt the seps of the dais stood DEntranguesand beside him a small man cloaked in a sadcolored mantle with a keen cleanly shavenface and watchful tyes He held in his handa sMi ill packet and surveyed me with nolittle interest DEntrangues did not meetmy look and his hang dog face was turnedtowards the doorway immediately oppositeto him In a moment or so the door wasopened and the duke entered talking earnestly with a cavalier of a most graciousand distinguished presence Tremouillehimself was a small slightly built man offeatures in no way remarkable but redeemed in some part by the alert intelligenceof his glance In early life he had met withan accident which left him lame ever afterYet he was a good horseman and of a constitution that nothing could tire As forhis companion his face was then strange topie but in after times when I was admittedto his intimacy and honored with hisfriendt hip I came to know him as great beyond allmen and this I do not say in gratitude forthe debt I owe himy but simply to add myhumble testimony to that of others hiscompanions in arms and equals in stationwho with one consent allow him to be theglory of his age and of knighthood Immediately behind Tremouille came DAlegresand Trevulzio who had raised himself to hispresent high position and was a most capable soldier These four took their seats atthe table and the numerous and brilliantstaff of officers who accompanied themranged themselves behind From the manner in which the stranger took his 3eat Igathered and 1 was not mistaken that hewas there as one of my judges and for themoment i wondered who he was That liewas of the highest rajik was clear from hisaspect and bearing and from the fact thathe wore round his neck the collar of theHoly Ghost The proceedings of this publiccourt martial began at once It is needlessto set their down in full detail DEntrangues stated his case DAlegres briefly setforth the action taken by him and Viscontiand Hawkwood testified to having foundtheir property in my possession nsder thecircumstances already explained 1 will dothem the justice to say that they did so withevident and genuine reluctance Tremouillewho had doubtless heard all this before listened patiently to the end and then askedme what I had to say What could I say1 looked at the faces around me and saw nosympathy I looked up at the gallery wheretlie ladies sat and caught a whisperI do not care I know it is false he isnot guiltyThe words gave me courage The chargewas false Then I found tongue 1 askedif it were possible that I a noble whosecareer had hitherto been blameless couldhave suddenly become so vile as to sink tocommon theft I pointed out my long yearsof service and called DAlegres and Trevulzio under whose banners I had servedto witness if they had ever known me sullymy honorIt is known M di Savelli that you arehard put for money said Tremouille1 admitted the fact and also admittedthat at the time 1 stood there I owed moneylost at play but that the sum did notamount to more than 50 crowns and therewas twice that amount due to me from theMilitary chest 1 then went on to point outhow unlikely it was that even if 1 hadstolen the jewels 1 should have hoardedthem up and not turned them into moneyfor which I allowed I was pressed andwound up by saying I was the victim of aconspiracy and that 1 was prepared to assert my honor man to man against DEntrangues or any other who would take uphis causeWhat say you my lord of Bayard andTremouille turned to the stranger who satbeside him Even whilst waiting for hisanswer and on the cross with anxiety as Iwas I could not help looking with the greatest interest at the man This then was thecelebrated Pierre du Terrail the noblestknight in Christendom Vague rumors thathe was to join the army of Tremouille witha high command had reached us But wehad merely looked upon them as rumorsAnd now he had come apparently suddenlyand without warning I felt sure that hebrought war with him but had no more timeto think for he answered A fair offerM dEntrangues can do no less than acceptBut Trevulzio then cut in pointing outthat practically the case was proved Thatto allow me the ordeal by combat wouldupset all the course of military disciplineunder which he thought the matter shouldbe decided Even if the oiJeal of battlewas allowed and I won it would not provemy innocence in the face of the damningevidence agamst meIf there is any shadow of doubt yourexcellency and DEntrangues advanced tothe table this will clear it up MesserVieri kindly hand that package to thedukeThe man whom he addressed who was noother than he whom I had remarked on entering the justice room as DEntranguescompanion stepped forward and placed thepacket before Tremouille who opened itamidst a dead silenceMesser Vieri how did you obtain thisa ed TremouilleThe matter is simple excellency repliedthe banker but first may I ask if madamethe duchess recognizes the trinketThe circlet was handed to the duchessw ho said in a low voiceIt is mine it was stolen from me a monthago on the 7th of MarchOn the 8th of March a packet was delivered to me at my house of business by one1 iirhes calling himself servant to the CavaSi ie di Savelli Ue did not know the contents of the parcel but it was sent to me forEafe keeping by his roaster so he said Igave him a receipt for it I myself did notknow what the nature of the packet was un- Itil to day but hearing the charges preferredagainst the cavaliere I opened the case andat once recognized ma lames circlet which1 hare the pleasure to restoreHow did you come to hear these chargesagainst the Cavaliere di Savelli askedBayardI was informed of them by the knightMesser dEnlranguesThat is to say M dEntrangues musthave known that the jewels were pledged toj 011 Is this not oddIt was a straw of hope that floated to meand I could scarcely breathe DEntranjhowever replied boldly 1 was told of thematter by one Tarbes a servant to M diSavelliou forget to add 1 burst out thathe was a creature of yours whom I employedon your recommendationDEntrangues made no reply and Bayardsaid M dEntrangues appears to haveusurped the functions of the provost andpb ed catch pole Could we not see tinsI arl 1Call Tarbes said the dukeBraccio came forward and explained thathe had been dealt with summarily underthe orders of the lieutenant generalMiiu said Alegrcs in astonishmentYes excellency he was the prisonerwhom your excellency ordered me to hanglast nightA pity remarked the duke and Trevulzio between whom and DAlegres therev u little love smiledI suppose you have nothing to say tothis said Tremouille tome1 was not in the camp on the 7thWhere were youBut this question I could not answer forI caught Mme dEntrangues eye imploringiuM 1 mJ2uSBk JrVyP --eatiDegradedme to silence I looked back at the dukeand as I did so felt that Bayard had followedmy glance and that his eyes were restingon madames face He glanced down almost as soon as I did and turned to me andthere was a grave encouragement in his lookfrom which I took heart To me it was agreat thing to show I was not at or near thecamp on the 7th and yet if I did so I wouldruin a womans name It had been 1 harmless frolic I swear this as I know I willcome to judgment before a higher tribunalthan that of man and yet had I spokenthere would have been but one constructionI hated DEntrangues too and this Youldhave struck at a vital part For a second Ihesitated and looked up once more atmadame She was pale as deathI looked at Bayard and his glance seemedto penetrate my thoughtsI cannot sayThere was a sound of a gasping sigh anda heavy fall The peacocTv fan flutteredslowly down from the gallery to my feetand lay there with its hundred eyes staringat meThis ruins you exclaimed DAlegresThink again before you reply said theduke 1 will give you timeI thank your excellency but I have nofurther answerTremouille shrugged his shoulders with adisappointed air and dropped his chin between his clasped hands his elbows restingon the table a favorite position 3i hisWhilst he was thus considering Bayard waswhispering earnestly to Trevulzio and theolder soldier seemed to assent and his hardface almost softened as he looked at meThey then turned their gaze on DEntrangues and Trevulzio with a shake of his headnoted something briefly on a slip of paperand passed it on to DAlegres The lieutenant general looked surprised but aftera moment nodded assent and in his turnpassed the paper on to the duke sayingI agree Tremouille read the paper slowly and then they consulted together in lowtonesAnd now in a few brief words 1 heard mysentence and it was carried out at onceBraccio himself hacked off my spins mvsword was brought in and solemnly brokenand I was warned to leave the camp withinan hour on pain of being hanged as a thiefSuch property as I had was declared confiscate and the men of my condotta were tobe enrolled by force if necessary under another banner How I went through it all1 do not know 1 cannot say how 1 passeddown that great hall with the eyes of allfixed on me a dishonored man an outcastand a leper One thing however did happen Whilst the sentence was being carriedout Tremouille sat apparently absorbed inthought When the provost broke mysword he rose to leave the room and as hepassed DEntrangues the duke stoppedMonsieur he said you have mistakenyour vocation His majesty does not desirehis officers to be thief hunters For suchtalents as yours you will doubtless find roomelsewhere and 1 have to tell you that theking my master regrets he has no furtherneed of your servicesWhen I left the door of the justice roomI had to pass through the main courtyardand run the gauntlet of open scorn and contempt bestowed upon me by all assembledthere It was a great thing for them forthose whom the French call canaille wehave no such appropriate word in our owntongue to see a noble dragged in the dustand covered with infamy And they did notspare me taunt and jeer passed from mouthto mouth Some even would have gone scfar as to strike at me had not their officersprevented themAh Croque mort exclaimed an arquebusier you should hang but the manstepped back a half pace at my look andgaining the outer gate I pressed on hardlyknowing whither my steps led me I soonfound out 1 was going in the direction ofArezzo itself and as that was as good as anyother place for me at present I made no alteration in my course but anxious to get onas fast as possible quickened my pace almostto a run until I was tired out and perforcecompelled to go slowerThis happened when 1 had covered abouta mile and was beginning the ascent leadingto the town and here I heard behind me theclatter of horses hoots and looking backbeheld a party riding in my direction Iturned aside and concealing myself behind the stem of a locust tree waited untilthe riders should pass This they did in afew moments and I saw it was Tremouilleand his staff returning to the town By theside of the duchess who was riding with herhusband was Bayard mounted on a bayEnglish horse which be managed with infinite grace and dexterityMme de la Tremouille was in th best ofhumors most probably at the recovery ofher circlet for she was laughing gayly asshe said something but they went by toorapidly for me to catch the wordsWhen I hastened from the scene of mycondemnation I bad no other idea but ofdeath of sell destruction rather than lifeas it v 01 Id be now to me but 1 put aside allthese thoughts for 1 had to live for revengeThat would be my first object and until itwas achieved 1 would not rest With thisin my mind I gained the St Clement gateof Arezzo passing through without noticeTO BE CONTINUEDSNAKE CHARMINGTricks of the Hindoo Fnkirg in Handling the VenomousReptileThe exhibition of the East Indian fakirs during- which the deadly cobra ismade to dance to the music of a flutehave created a popular impression thatthese creatures are extremely sensitiveto the sound of music Dr J C Thompson says that demonstrations of thischaracter are only tricks on the partof the clever Ilindoo and the cobra instead of being in an amiable and fascinated condition as it waves its body toand fro is really in a fit of intense anger The trick is simple Wheneverthe reptile is annojed it has the habitof elevating the forward part of thebody from the ground spreading itsneck or hood and glaring fiercely at theobject of its anger It is then watchingfor a chance to deliver a deadly blofobserving every movement of the objectin front of it If one moves no matterhow slightly there is a correspondingnervous movement of the snake Whenthe Hindoo opens his snake baskets thecobras rise naturally to their positionof attack He commands them to danceand at the same time begins a livelytune on the flute swaying his bodyfrom side to side in time to the musicThe excited cobras follow every motionof the supposed charmer They are notdancing to the music but intensely angered are seeking to revenge themselves on their captor The handling ofgiant boas and pythons as seen in circuses is still more simple These hugesnakes are lazy and sleepy andthe secret of handling them is to avoidanything like a nervous movement Ifthey are taken up gently but withoutthe slightest

that he was a foolHe knew more about himself than 1could Shoot himself You bet hedthought of that and what stopped himwasnt prejudice nor want of pluck neither Well the life he lived that lastyear would have been enough in the caseof the average man He saw it outthough mind you if nothing had happened to him after all hed be in a lunutic asylum tonightFriday hed asked me to dine withhim here

him Itwas close upon 12 before wed got to collee Id kept an eye on Kirton all alongYou know the Mandevil sort of faceabout the color of a new drum headThen he was staring right through me atthe door and his face hail pt to be thecolor of that cigar ash Behind me thereseemed all at once a kind of commotionWhen I looked round the people betweenus and the door were getting out of theirchairsAll tlw chatter and the clatter seemedto stop I fancy one or two womensqueaked I heard one woman back ofme cry out Whats that to the chap shewas with Then everybody seemed to bestaring straight at us There was Kirton sort of pinned back in his chair ina tit youd have said his hands close tohis throat at grips with nothing his eyeshalf out of his head and his fact welllike no other fellows face f hat 1 eversaw going through till then There wasa sort of stampede Burners actually toldme afterward that he felt it every timehe tried to get near his master felt something between em like death he said
