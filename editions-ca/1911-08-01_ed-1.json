Hen Becomes Foster Mother of
Kittens.
A five-year-old Black Spanish hen
owned by Mrs. Taylor Collins, of
Franklin county, has adopted six
kittens, and cares for them as tender
ly as if they were her chicks. The
kittens have learned to heed the call
of the hen's "cluck," and the old hen
calls the kittens and spreads her wings
over them to protect them as carefully
as if they were her brobd.
The affection displayed by the kit:
tens for the hen and by the hen for
toe kittens is the most unusual because
the cat, the mother of the kittens, is
living and nusers the kittens as regu
larly as if they did not have a foster
mother. -. s. U
The old cat seems to understand the
situation and displays no jealousy,
but, on the contrary, seems to delight
in the attention shown her offspring
by the hen. The hen does not under
stand why it is that the kittens, which
have acquired the strength, desire to
run about the yard, and becomes very
uneasy when they are out of her sight.
She left a setting of eggs to adopt
the kittens, and has lost interest en
tirely in chickens of all kinds since the
arrival of the kittens.

THE FIRST ASTOR.
A Daring and Resourceful Operator In
the Fur Trade.
John Jacob Astor was born in the lit
tle village of Waldorf, in Germany, in
1763, just as France at the close of
the Seven Years' war was ceding
Canada to England. He sailed to our
side of the Atlantic in 1783, when
George III. in the treaty of Paris waa
acknowledging our independence and
when the merchants of Montreal were
establishing the Northwest company.
He became a fur dealer, gradually
gained control of the trade south of
Lakes Huron and Superior, except
that which was in the hands of the
Mackinaw company, and won a repu
tation "as a daring and resourceful op
erator, which made his name known
in Montreal, St. Louis, London and
Canton.
He had a dozen vessels afloat, repre
senting a capital of $1,000,000. carry
ing furs to England and China in
1S00, and at the time that the pur
chase of Louisiana in 1803 pushed our
boundary to the Rocky mountains he
was the wealthiest and most success
ful merchant in the United States.
North American Review.
The Man of Leisure.
Most of our rich men work very hard
not always because they want to, but
in many instances because they have
to. The husbandry of a big estate in
itself may be a task for the whole of
the time and thought, not of one man,
but of several. As a general thing it
is fair to say that our only man of
leisure is the tramp. The social pariah,
the mutineer against the rule of work,
is the only one who can be sure ot a
care free, sybaritic existence, and even
he lives in constant danger of rock salt
from the farmer's gun or the onslaught
of the watchdog around the corner as
the hobo knocks at the kitchen door
or pauses at the water trough to drink.
The poor tramp Is certainly a more
frequent social phenomenon than the
rich one. Philadelphia Ledger.
The Earl and the Angler.
One of the earls of Mlnto had a
kindly nature. One day a Hawick an
gler was throwing his line on the river
near Minto when a tall gentleman,
came up to him and inquired what
kind of sport he was having. The
fisher replied that it was not very
good and that he could do better if
he were at the other side of the water,
adding, "I'll gi'e ye sixpence if ye'll
carry me across." The bargain was
struck, and the gentleman, getting the
angler on his back, carried him through
the water to the other side. True to
his promise, the angler produced the
sixpence, which he proffered to the
stranger, who. however, smiled and
remarked, "Give it to the first beggar
you meet and tell him it is a present
from the Earl of Minto."
Why She Worried.
"But, mother, why do you object to
my being pleasnnt to the young menY
You can't hope to keep me with you
always, you know. One of them will
take me away from you some day."
"Take you away from raeV Well, if
that happens I shall not complain. It
is the certainty that none of the young
men who have been coming here so
far would take you away that has
worried both your father and me."

Tilt Expected to Veto Wool Bill.
Democratic leaders of the Houe
adopted anything but a conciliatory
tcne on the wool tariff situation Satur-,
day. Underwood and Harrison ot the
Ways and Means Committee, and other
prominent Democrats expressed them
selves in unfriendly terms to the iwool
tariff compromise with the Senate that
would mean raising the rate of the
Underwood bill.
Meantime. President Taft is gener
ally credited as fully determined to ve
to the bill.
The present situation in the House
is the key to the entire tariff tangle
in Congress. Upon the action of the
House early next week rests the possi
bility of further tariff legislation this
session. Speaker Clark exuiepsed con
fidence that a wool bill will be agreed
upon in conference and be signed by
the President. Other House leaders,
however, adopted a more pessimistic
view.
Apparently the desire of certain
House leaders ia to take no chances of
Deing piacea on recora as endorsing aj
party protective tariff bill. Ihey be
lieve the President will veto any bill
and do not want to be on reccrd in
favor of any except a straight revenue
measure, as the Underwood bill is
claimed to be.
Back of this sentiment is the demand
of a faction of which Harrison.of New
York, is leader, that the raw wool
duty shall not be increased above 20
per cent. The general expectation is
that the La Follette compromise bill
as it passed the Senate will emerge
from conference based on 30 per cent
ad valorem on raw wool.
There was no change in the Senate
situation, the coalition maintaining its
strength and the parties to that com
bination' expressing confidence in their
ability to put through the revision
legislation.
Fight Against High Heels.
A nation-wide movement against the
wearing of high-heeled shocB is the
plan of Justice W. O. Howard, of the
Supreme Court of New York State.
In an address at Troy, N. Y., Justice
Hwoard said to an audience of women:
"The wearing of high-heeled .shoes is
as barbarous and as torturini and as
destructive of health as Chinese wood
en shoes. It is as heathenish and out
landish as wearing rings in the nose or
ta t)oing .the lace, and it breeds an
ungainly and deformed race. The
obsolete civilization of China feels
proud of another kind.' Each results
in walking monstrosities. Can I urge
you to go out and advocate normal
feet, sue-'i as God gave. Have you the
courage to sneak out against this silly
faahior a fashion as destructive as
rum, as deadly as opium or are you to
be counted among its devotees."
