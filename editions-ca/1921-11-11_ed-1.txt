Due to theneglect of the Republican candidatesto file their election certificates withthe County Clerk within the specified time, their names did not appear on the official ballot, and, although the Republican ticket withthe names of the offices and blankspaces for writing in the names ofthe candidates was on the ballot,few took advantage of the privilegeto vote. The total vote was probably the lightest ever cast in thecounty. The two amendments to theState Constitution carried by a largevote. The election was an unusually quiet one, due to the lack of opposition, and many stay-at-homevotes cut down the Democratic majority. The successful candidateswere as follows:Circuit Judge, Robert L. Stout, incumbent; Commonwealth's Attorney,Victor A. Bradley, incumbent; Senator, Henry S. Caywood, succeedingGeorge Hon; Representative, Jas. H.Thompson, incumbent; Circuit Clerk,Wm. H. Webb, incumbent; CountyJudge? Geo. Batterton, incumbent;County Attorney, D. D. Cline, incumbent; County Clerk, Pearce Paton,incumbent; Sheriff, M. Peale Collier Jsucceeding Wm. G.

CountyBoard ot .Education are George; Linkvand "Ernest Darxaby. ,The outstanding case of StatewideDemocratic victory was in Kentuckywhere that party regained controlof the Legislature, which has beenRepublican for two years. In Maryland, where the entire lower housewas elected, with 127 members of theSenate Democratic, control was increased. Both Houses of the KentuckyState Legislature will tie organizedby the Democrats at the sessionwhich will open next January, according to unofficial returns received from the Thirty-fourth Senatorial district, on which control of the,State Senate hinged.Unofficial returns compiled Wednesday give the Democrats twentymembers of the State Senate to eighteen for Republicans, and 67 members of the House to 33 Republicans.In the 1920 Legislature, the Senatewas tied, each side having 19 members, while the House had 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats.That the spirit of Democracy isstill militant was the conclusiondrawn by Cordell Hull, recentlyelected chairman of the DemocraticNational Committee, from the results of Tuesday's election.In Mr. Hull's opinion, the result ofgreatest importance to Democracywas that in Kentucky, while NewYork City elected a Democrat asMayor by a majority as large as itgave President Harding a year ago;Syracuse elected a Democratic Mayorfor the first time in a quarter of acentury, and other cities in severalStates showed a strong trend toward Democracy.BUY COAL NOWJELLIC0 COAL FOE STOVES ANDGRATES BEST COAL ON THEMAEKET.

Baldwin that too manydrugs are used in treatment of disease. Dr. Baldwin made the statement in. an address before the OhioState Medical Association atx Toledo. Healers of schools other than medical say they obtain high percent-'ageswof" cures without the use of anydrugs. They operate through themuscular or nervous systems or themindsjof patients.DVBaldwin declared that mostphysicians use too many drugs andthat in many cases diseases wouldbe cured just as soon, or possiblysooner, if allowed to take their natural course. He did not advocatethe entire elimination of medicine,but the use of less medicine.Dr. J. H. J. Upham, mentioned byDr. Baldwin as having blocked publication of his address, called theassertions a combination of truth,half truth and untruth..The Committee of reference whichconsidered Dr. Baldwin's address andrecommended that it be not published in the State Association's magazine was appointed by Dr. Upham.The State Association's Coucil alsorecommended that it be not published because of the misinterpretationpersons outside the medical profession might place upon it, Dr. Upham said. He (Dr. Upham) was nota member of the council, but speaking before it, advised against publication. v. Other physicians indicated a conviction that Dr. Baldwin's commentswould be taken in the wrong way bypersons not familiar with modernmedical practice."I agree with Dr. Baldwin," saidR. L. Shook, chiropractor. 'I use nodrugs at all, and am having successful results in a wide variety ofca'ses."y"l have known for some time ofDr. Baldwin's stand on the matter,"said Charles E. Clark, chiropractor..

"During the hunting season thisfall, more than 5,000,000 persons,estimates the Biological Survey ofthe United States Department of Agriculture, will go out with a gun intothe woods and fields of America.Their going emphasizes the growingneed of more adequate and uniformlaws to conserve and protect thecountry's dwindling game supply."It has been the practice in manyStates," the department says, "toissue hunting licenses for the openseason to all applicants, with toolittle regard for the available gamesupply of any particular area. Thehunters may far outnumber the animals hunted within a given section,and under such conditions the extinction of big game especially isinevitable."The Department of Agricultureadvocates a limited license plan forbig game, based on annual estimatesof game conditions in each district.This means that the number of biggame licenses issued for a given areain one season would depend uponthe number of game animals whichit has been determined in advancecan be spared. Proper administra- Ltion of this sort should conservega,me in the greatest numbers consitent with the reasonable demandsfor local grazing and other interests and obviate the necessity forestablishing perennial closed seasons, except to areas being restocked."fcThis little hit of advice may helpyou regain your Health, vStrength and VitalityThousands of people suffer from nervousness.

They lapseinto careless, desultory habits, or develop a shrinking attitude. Theirfaces look pinched.The blood becomes overtaxed bytoo rapid growth; and poisons fromthe system take the place ofstrength-giving red corpuscles in theblood. Red corpuscles are those little red particles that swim in bloodand give it its color. Gradually thatchild loses interest in its play.Poor blood needs the building thatthe iron in Gued's Pepto-Mangangives to weakened blood. Gude'sPepto-Mangan enriches the blood byincreasing the number of red corpuscles, and restores the blood by driving out the poisons.

That all a girl has to do become aproficient milkmaid is to be born inthe country is being demonstrated, afallacy at Berea College. A course indairying, open to men, but especiallydesigned to appeal to women, is oneof the features of the Berea curriculum which is guaranteed to turn amountain girl into a dairy-maidequally able to preside over a herdof cows, or to direct a butter-makingestablishment. And the girls are notthe Broadway musical show varietyof milkmaid, either.With its excellent herd of milkcows, its large dairy-barn, and itswide range of pasture, Berea cangive to its girls all the atmosphereand practice obtainable "down onthe farm." Special emphasis is laidon the practical side, and particularly on conditions as they obtainon the average small farm in thecountry, in order that the girl leaving college may be able to demonstrate to the people of her mountainneighborhood how to take care ofcattle in a most efficient way.While some master minds havelong felt that fudge-making andfancy embroidery are the heaviestwork that should be done at a girls'college, the modern girl is doingthings differently, and Berea'scourse of dairy-work is practicalenough to suit anyone. At the sametime the completion of Berea's recently hegun campaign for additional endowment and new buildingswill place hundreds more of theeeewill place the facilities of the college within reach of hundreds moregirls of the Sounthern mountains.The work has been greatly limitedby lack of accommodations for thegirls, but additional girls' dormitories would mean educational freedomto many who otherwise could not secure it.

The first of the year is hardon the student and in a very shorttime several hundred dollars hasbeen given out. In order to meetthe demand of the opening of thesecond semester more money must beaccumulated. It is not a charity.The students pay back after theyleave the University (and sometimesdo so before they leave), but alwaysafter getting a position. The moneyis given only to good students or to'students who would make a successof school were it not for the factthat they have to work nearly allthe time. The cause is a worthyone. The Kiwanians of Lexingtonwould ilke to have all the State interested in it and contribute to thefund by patronizing the concerts.Miss Harvard has a voice of beautyand she is an artist.

It is one ofthe few institutions of learning inthe land in which a student may secure an education running from therudiments to an A. B. degree, andalso one of the few colleges where agrown but uneducated man or woman may begin at the beginning.There are five schools in BereaCollege. The most interesting oneis the Foundation School, open tostudents from fifteen years old up.As the name implies, It starts fromthe foundation, welcoming to itsprecincts older as well as youngerstudents who have never had achance to study.The Academy is the equivalent ofthe usual preparatory school orhigh school course, which gets readyfor college those students who wishto continue further than the primary grades.The Vocational School brings tothe students a knowledge of pursuitswhich they may desire to use intheir choice of a life work. Shops,a herd of cattle, an experimentalfarm, a hospital for curses innursing, and other equipment areready for vocational school students. The College itself carries students from the Academy to their degree of A. B. and is the equal ofany College course in the South.Many of its graduates return totheir mountain homes as teachers atgraduation.The Normal School is used forthe training of students as teachers,and gives a certificate for this purpose. Many of the school teachersin the mountain districts areBarea's product. With these fiveschools ready for the mountain boyor girl, Berea College is able to perform a duty to education withunique chances of service.The development of the fiveschools is an outgrowth of Berea'sdesire to be everything to the mountain people who depend upon it. Itcould do this only by being ready togive to all who asked anything thatwas desired in the way of coursesor teaching. That the scheme is asuccess is shown by the fact that inthe year just completed 2,560 students passed through the ever-opendoors of Berea.With an ideal situation, a hugeclinetele to draw from, and the goodwill of the mountain people, but onething has handicapped Berea thelack of money Its friends have beenmany, and new and much-neededequipment and buildings have appeared as if by magic.
