appreciative. Every number Was ren-
t dered with the care of an artist, and
the vast audience could have enjoyed
it for two hours longer without grow-
ing tired. It was one of the best con
certs we have had the pleasure of
listening to in a long time.

who are conducting the revival meet
ing at Paris, conducted services at
,the Methodist Church here Wednes

wishes, and in all of this his wife
and little son were not forgotten.

a. m. in his late home in Carlisle,

RED CROSS NURSES. -
ft
Mrs. Minnekef, -of Cincinnati, who
is in charge "of the visiting nurse
work in this city and county, -under
.-
the auspices of the Bourbon County
Health and Welfare League, has re
ceived the following veryinteresting
letter from one of her " associates
formerly of the Cincinnati Hospital:
"On Board Red Cross S. S.f
September 23, 1914.
"My Dear Mrs. Meineker:
"As. eigth of the Cincinnati Hos
pital graduates have left Cincinnati
and have gonewith the American Red
Cross to take a modest part in the
European war, or rather in nursing,
I thought you would perhaps like to
hear of them.
"We left Cincinnati September 2,
at 12:30 p. m. over the B. & O. On
reaching New York after a very pleas
ant trip we registered at the Central
Club for Nurdses, at No. 54 East 34th
Street. We then went to Osborne
Hall just opposite Bellevue Hospital.
After getting our uniforms and equip
ment and attending lectures and
meetings, where Major Patterson,
Miss Delano and Helen Hay gave
some interesting talks, we went
aboard the American -Red Cross
ship, but did not sail until Septem
ber 13. Almost the entire crew had
to be changed, as some of them were
members of the German navy. We
have been eleven days on the water,
and expect to reach Falmouth, Eng
land, some time this evening.
"For six days not a ship of any
kind kwas seen. Our time has been
devoted to study, no cards or dancing,
usually four hours of class, taking up
which is used in Europe, prayers af
file First Aid and Metric System
ter dinner and then a lecture,, retir
ing at 10:00 p. m. "
"Our unit from Cincinnati consisted
of twelve nurses. Ten were seasick
and. 411 other units fared about as
well. After three or four days all
recovered, feeliner much better than
when Ave started. To show that we
are neutral our surnames have been
dropped and w address one another
as Sister Bertha or Sister Helen,
which we have become quite accus
tomed to by this time. Y
"The first group will leave for
England, next for Russia, then France,
then Germany. Our group, the last to
leave, will go to Austria. Just when
we will arrive there I cannot say,
probably in another week or two.
Will write later. Would so much
love to- hear from you.
"Had intended to answer a call for
Mrs. Virgil Gaitskill in November,
but I don't think I will get back by
that time. Wrote her hurried note
telling her of my departure for
Europe.
"The nurses all send their love and
they will all be glad to hear from
you. I will give you the list: Anna
Sutter, Bertha Butterfield, Mary E.
Minshall, . Margaret Bodkin, Ella
Hoff, Lula B. 'Mastin, Anna Donner
shausen, Ella Weimann.
"Mrs. Shoepf and Mrs. Caspar Bur
ton sent us a cheering telegram just
hefore we sailed, and Mrs. Woodward
a sewing bag, stating that we would
be remembered by the Guild.
'Please address in name of Ameri
can Red Cross, U. S. Dispatch Agency,
No. 4 Trafalgar Square, 'London,
England. With love and good wishes,
I remain your friend,
"ELLA WEIMANN."

FORMER PARIS FAVORITE
. DIES IN NEW
YORK.
Marion Manola, for many years
one of the most popular operatic and
dramatic stars of the country, died
suddenly Wednesday, following an op
eration atthe NewRochelle Hospital,
in New Rochelle, N. Y. She was for
merly the wife of John Mason, with
whom she appeared at the local opera
house several times in "Friend Fritz,"
which scored a big success all over
the country. For the past ten years
she has vbeen the wife of Geo. G.
Gates,, and lived directly across the
street from the former husband, John
Mason, in New Rochelle.
Friends of the once famous Paris
favorite said that her death was due in
large measure to the recent arrest of
her husband and the shock she sus
tained when detectives armed with a
warrant invaded Aer sick room hunt
ing Gates.
The arrest of Gates was the result
of a fight for the control of a moving
rpicture corporation, in which he made
an affidavit that he had been asked
by Frederick S. Dudley, vice-Presi-deht
and general manager of the con
cern, to falsify the statements to the
stockholders.
Scores of Paris people who were
once charmed by Marion Manola's mu
sical voice and' fine stage appearance
will r,egret to learn of o rtragic
death.
