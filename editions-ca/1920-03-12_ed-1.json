Ten different races are served by
the Home Mission Work of the
Southern Presbyterian' church Mex
icans, Cubans. French, Italians, Bo
hemians, Hungarians, Poles, Syrians,
Chinese and Indians. These people
have come from foreign lands to
work in American industries. The
church is giving them a chance to
serve America's God. The missions
for them are scattered over the
Southern States. Besides this tre
mandous work the Home Mission
Board is doing work among the
mountaineers, the negroes, and the
poor people in desolate places of the
country. The church conducts a
seminary for colored preachers at
Abbeville, South. Carolina, besides
about forty schools with one hun
dred scholars. To sustain and pro
mote this great work is one of the
points of the Presbyterian Progres
sive Program, in .which the First
Presbyterian Church of this town is
engaging with Mr. John Woodford
as Chairman-Manager.
POTnC SALES EASING TTP.
During the months of January
and February and the first week in
March there was a general rush to
dispose, of town and country proper
ty, Auctioneers were kept busy and
public sales were held every, day in
the week. Nearly everyone seemed
lo be willing and many were anxious
to dispose of farms, etc. The vol
li mo of real estate transfers in Paris
and Bourbon county the past fall
anc" winter will total an enormous
sum. County Clerk Pearce Paton
end assistants have 3iad all they
.could do: to attend to the work of
transferring, copying and recording.
There is at present a lull in the mar
Set, which may be revived, at any
time. The banks, real estate men,
attorneys and many others profited
JargeJy through the rush to sell.
BIRTHS.
"STATISTICS."
'"O Lord, bless me and my wife,
my son John and his wife, us four
and no more," might have been the
prayer of one man, but it is not the
spirit of the churches of America in
.1920. It is not the spirit of the
Southern- Presbyterian church, as is
shown in the spirit of the Presby
terian Progressive Program. This
church has over 364,000 members.
The foreign mission field which has
been assigned to it has more than
31,846,000 people in it. About 87
heathens are looking to each, man,
woman and child of this church for
news of Christ. The church has
sent out 384 workers. They have
trained a force of 3,024 native
workers. There are 1489 regular
places of worship. The Southern
Presbyterian Church iiu foreign
lands is roughly one-eighth, as large
as it is in America. There are 43,
221 members in seven countries.
China, Africa, Japan, Korea, Mexico,
Brazil and Cuba, and 5,489 members
were added to these churches in
101 8T. There are 752 schools with
27,684 students. Twenty-six doc
tors and 12 trained nurses run 15
hospitals, using 46 buildings, which,
in 1918 accommodated 9,936 pati
ents, performed 2,267 major opera
tions, and from 19 dispensary build
ings gave 94,404 .persons a total of
333,635 treatments. It is estimated
that $1,332,000 will keep this tre
mendous work going for the next
year.

XOEHING IN THE WOODS.
'As one pushes through the fiinge
of undergrowth which skirts the for
est and seats himself, at daybreak,
on a stump or a fallen tree to watch
and listen, the woods become in-
stinct with life," says Arthur F.
" Rice. "The blue jay sounds his
trumpet call, the crows hold noisy
consultation over their plans for the
iay and a ruffled grouse whips the
twigs-of the pine with her wing as
she leaves her roost. The chip
ttiunks scurry about from stump to
'Stump, now rushing precipitably to
cover, now coming forth again to
take a critical view of the intruder.
Their larger cousins, the red squir- J
rels, come out from the

tie out a challenge to all comers.
At last comes the sound for which
you have been waiting and which
snakes the-heart beat faster. It is a
thrashing among the boughs of the
TMJlIow niaple near by, telling you
that the gray squirrel is out after
' his breafast.
"Away he goes toward some big
oak: or hickory, scattering a shower
dew- from the leaves as he jumps

accenting, each syllable with a jerk
of his broad tail. Of all the sounds
in nature, there are few which thrill
fie like thcr bark of the gray squir

Several scientific investigators
aeree that the Indian as we know
Mm is a comparatively late ccmer.
Whether he arrived by way of
Alaska frchi Asia may never be dis
covered, but the relics of his civili
ation are believed to date back not
more than a few thousand years at
most. There is much evidence on
the other band to indicate that men
lived in North America at the close
of the Ice Age and perhaps during
the glacial period. The evidence is
found for the most part in the Ohio
and Delaware valleys. The rude inr
struhient these men used in their
hunting and homes have been found
buried deep in gravel which is be
lieved to date back to the close of the
Ice Age. If this be the case men liv
ed in America -10,000 or 15,000
years ago. Some geologists believe
that the gravel deposits are consid
erably older. How these men found
1 heir "way to America in re .note an
tiquity, how much of the land they
occupied and where they disappeared
are perhaps ihe most fascinating
problems in American archaeology.
The patient investigations of many
trained scientists are carrying -us
every day nearer the answer.
