A PLAY WITHIN A PLAY.
Tho Feasting Scene Developed a Cemi
. jcal Complicatidn.
In Willie Ecjouin's production of
"Dreams," which enjoyed a long and
lucrative prosperity, there was a night
ly feast on the stage, of which the
principal item was a "property"
chicken, made of canvas and with de
tachable -legs and wings. Obviously
the actors could not eat them, and each
night after the scene they were gath
ered up and replaced on the bird, ready
for the next performance. The real
edibles were generally apples, bread
and gingersnaps. for the purchase of
which a generous management allowed
the property man 25 cents a night.
James, as this functionary was called,
used to pocket the money, according to
members of the company, and feed
them stale biscuits and crackers taken
from the table of the dollar a day
hotels in which he made his residence
en tour. Member after member of the
company complained to Mr. Edouin,
but each was treated with scant con
sideration,, for Mr. Edouin did not have
to eat in the play. His share in the
banquet was a glass of lemon soda,
served in place of wine, and the prop
erty man was generally wise enough
not to offend the star by any substitu
tion. One night, however, during the ban
quet scene, when Mr. Edouin. as a
grandfather, pulled the cork of the
stage champagne, a disagreeable odor
and whitish smoke came forth. Some
thing had gone wrong with the lemon
soda. Mr. Edouin discovered at once
that there had been a mistake. He
pushed his own glass aside and start
ed to fill the other glasses. Thereupon
his wife, who was never behindhand
when there was a chance for fun,
leaned across the table and remarked
quite audibly:
"You are going to give us a treat to
night, grandpa; don't fefget yourself."
Interpolating lines meant a One of
$5, and Edouin glared, but he raised
the bottle to fill his glass. The last of
the liquor was thicker and apparently
more unpleasant than the first. As
Edouin appeared to hesitate his mis
chievous wife sprang to her feet with
a new interpolation:
4A bumper, grandpa," she cried,
shaking the gray curls she wore as
grandpa's wife. "I demand that you
shall first dirink a bumper to the
health of the old wife who has stood
at your side more than fitty years."
The house applauded, and there was
no getting out of it Edouin drained
the glass, then, with a look of murder
in his eyes, vanished from the scene.
A moment later he returned, dragging
with him the property man, who had
been standing in the wings, dressed
as a country bumpkin, ready to drive
the sleigh in the nest scene.
"Here, mother," said Edouin, "here's
some one who wants to drink your
health too." Seizing a bowl, he drain
ed the contents of the bottle Into it and
then, deliberately emptying all the
glasses into it, handed it to James.
"Drink that, my lad," he said cheer
fully, adding under his breath, "If you
leave a drop of it you'll be discharged."
James took his medicine; then he
disappeared. New York Times.

Agreed With the Admiral.
Sir John Fisher, who recently re
signed as first sea lord of England, Is
a bluff, blunt, old fashioned seaman,
about whom anecdotes cluster as bees
on a honeycomb. One of the classics
has to do with a former boatswain on-
Fisher's ship, who insisted upon seeing
him at the admiralty offices in London.
Fisher was busy and refused to be
bothered. "Hi'll stay h'until Hi do see
'im," said the boatswain.
Sir John was not in good humor, and
when this was reported to him he
snapped out, "I'll see him in hell."
The boatswain had edged into the
office and heard this promise. "Hi
know that, Sir John." said he, "but
Hi want to ave a talk with you first"
And he had the talk.

pointing?" said the engineer. "Yes,
