OP
'Tis a funny world, an investiga
tion of the police department brought
out in Lexington recently.
Following reports that buckets of
blackberries were being sold with
only a layer an inch in depth on the
top of the bucket and that the re
mainder was filled with sacks, rocks,
sawdust and anything else that
might have been available, the de
partment came upon Chester Dawson,
who was in charge of a truck-load of
the berries.
Dawson had brought the berries
all the way from Log Lick, in Clark
county, to dispose of them in Lex
ington and did not know the contents
of the buckets was other than berries
until several had been sold. The
man who owned the berries had hir
ed several persons to pick them, pay
ing them by the bucket. It was the
pickers, he said, that perpetrated the
camouflage. The police were satis
fied Dawson was not to blame.
The money was refunded to those
purchasing the "phony" buckets, but
Dawson, was convinced he was up
against hard luck in hauling twenty
buckets of rocks to Lexington. The
rest of the load, about fifty buckets
in all, were all right and all the
buckets were filled with honest-to-goodness
berries and sold rapidly.
