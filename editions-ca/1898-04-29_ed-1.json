Ihad not thought ah God had I butknownl
That this Ead hour sliould ever me hefaU
When thou I judged the holiest of all
Should come to be the thing I must disown
Was it not true that April morn thy blown
Gold hair around my hair for coronal
Or is this truer thou at tho outer wall
Unroyal and with unrepentant moan
Yet prize I now this wisdom I have won
Who must always remember nay my tear
Must close mine eyes as thou wouldst hide Ihy

If some great meteor kindred to the sun
Should haunt the undying stars ten million
years
To fall some noon dead in thy market place

THE LITTLE TITMOUSE
One Free Bird That Attracts Attention
Among Hundreds of Captives
In a big bird store where there are
hundreds of birds of many kinds inces
santly squawking chirping and singing
there is one that is free a tiny tit
mouse The window is full of cages
containing birds of various sorts and
one side of the store is lined with bird
cages stacked up high all along But
there is none that attracts so much at
tention as the little titmouse flitting
about the store at will At night it
perches on a gas fixture in the window
and to that it comes back from its vari
ous excursions by day
Customers that come in to buy birds
and birdcages and bird seed and one
thing and another never fail to notice
the titmouse They may not notice an
other bird there individually but their
attention is sure to be attracted by this
one as it darts about free among so
many captives and they are likely to
smile at it they are so pleased witb it
And sometimes children looking in at
the windows of the bird store come in
to tell the clerk that one of the birds
has got loose
When it has nothing else to do the
titmouse sits on its gas pipe perch and
perks its head this way and that and
looks about Sometimes it whets its
beak on the gas pipe Every now and
then it dashes off somewhere If it
wants a drink it perches on the rim of
a goldfish globe for home aquariums
and stock for them are sold here as well
as birds no doubt to the great surprise
of the goldfishes and certainly to that
of the human beholders who wonder
that it doesnt fall in it has to bend
over so far to reach the water Eut it
gets it and when it has taken its fill it
flashes back to its perch on the pipe in
the window
Tho titmouse catches spiders and oth
er insects and it feeds in the larger
cages when it will It goes in and out
of them between the bars with perfect
ease It is a very little bird even with
its plumage in its natural form With
its feathers pressed against its sides it
can get through a very narrow space
between the bars of a parrots cage for
example with ease There are in the
window a number of parrots cages in a
rows- The titmouse almost flies through
these cages stopping in each perhaps to
eat of the parrots food but they never
molest it Parrots that would bite at
the finger of a man who should put his
hand near enough to the outside of their
cage stand back in fright or sheer
amazement when the little titmouse
dashes in and perches on their feed cup

German Education
The Germans are the most thoroughly
educated people in the world What
they know they know well
A fellow traveler had taken his de
gree of B A in the University of Penn
sylvania and gone to that of Berlin
where he spent three years Subse
quently traveling in Switzerland he
met a young German whose range and
accuracy of knowledge weee simply be
yond that of any man of the same age
he had ever met In many walks and
talks the German had absolutely pumped
the American dry while his own store
of knowledge had only been touched
Ach said the German student one
day I shall never get my degree it is
so difficult it is so much so hard so
long I must have patience I used to
see you at the University of Berlin
and forgive me the question how did
you get into the university
Why I was admitted on my B A
from the University of Pennsylvania
replied the American
Mein Gott gasped the German
scholar I knew it must be some way
like that
No better comment on the relative
standards of knowledge and the thor
oughness of the method by which it is
pursued could be asked Philadelphia

A Peculiar Feeling
The sensation of homesickness has
been variously described but never more
graphically than by a little girl who
miles away from home and mamma sat
heavy eyed and silent at a hotel table
Arent you hungry dear asked
her aunt with whom she was travel
ing
No
Does your head ache
No
What is the matter
The childs lip quivered and she said
in a tone to grieve the heart
Im seasick for home National

dition of the Kidneys When urine stains

frequent desire to urinate or pain iu the

night to urinate The mild and the extraor
