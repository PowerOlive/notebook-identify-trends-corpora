oth army corpsGen Shafter read a cable messageirom Secretary Alger ordering himat the recommendation of SurgeonGeneral Sternberg to move thearmy into the interior to San Luiswhere it is healthier As a result ofthe conference Gen Shafter will insist upon the immediate withdrawal ofthe army north within two weeks Asan explanation of the situation thefollowing letter from Col Theo Roosevelt commanding the 1st volunteercavalrv to Gen Shafter was handedby the latter to the correspondent hereof the Associated Press for publicationMaj Gen ShafterSir In a meeting of the general andK cal oflcers called by you ac the palace thismorning we are all as you know unanimous inview of what should be done v ith the armyTo keep us liere in the opinion of every officercommanding a division or a brigade willsimply involve the destruction of thousandsThere is no possible reason for not shipping0 practically the entire command north at onceYellow fever cases are very few in the cavalrydivision where I command one ofthe two brigades and not onetrue case of yellow fever hascurred in this division except among the mensent to the hospital at Siboney where theyhave I believe contracted it But in this division there have been 1500 cases of malarialfever Not a man has died from it but thewhole command is so weakened and shatteredas to be ripe for dying like rotten sheep whena real yellow fever epidemic instead of a fake- epidemic like the present strikes us sis it isbound to if ac stay here at the height of thesickness scjsou August and the beginningof September Quarantine against malariafever is much like quarantining against thetoothache All of us are certain as soon asthe authorities at Washington fully appreciate the conditions of the army tobe sent heme If we are kept here it will inall human possibility mean an appalling disaster fcr the surgeons here estimate that overhalf the army if kept here during the sicklyseason will die This is not only terrible fromthe standpoint of the individual lives losttbut it means ruin from the standpointtof the military efficiency of theflower of the American army forthe great bulk of the regulars are here withyou The sick list large though it is exceeding 4000 affords but a faint index of the debilitation of the army Not 10 per cent are litfor active vork Six weeks on the NorthMaine cast for instance or elsewhere wherethe yellow fever germ can not possiolypropagate wouid make us all as fit asfighting cocks abe as we are eager totake a leading part in the great eampaign against Havana in the fall even if wenre not try Porto Rico We cant beIfmoved north if moved at once with absolute-safety to the country although of courseitwould have been infinitely better if we hadbeen moved north or to Porto Rico two weeksngo If there were any object in keeping ushere we Avculd face yellow fever with as muchindifference as we face bullets but there isno object in it The four immune regiments ordered here are sufficient to garrison the city andsurrounding towns and there is absofutelynothing fcr us to do here and there has notbeen since the town surrendered It is impossiblc to meve into theintcrior Every shiftingof camp doubles the sick rate in our presentweakened condition and anyhow the interioris rather worse than the coast as I have foundby actual reconnoissance Our present campsare as healthy as any camrs at this end ofthe island can Le I write only because I cannet see cur men who have fought so bravelyand wno have endured extreme hardships anddangers so uncomplainingly go to destructionwithout striving so far as lies in me to avert adoom as fearful as it is unnecessary and undehcrved Yours respectfullyTheodore Rooseveltr Colonel Commanding 1st BrigadeAfter Col Roosevelt

of occupation m Cuba arc of the unanimous opinion that this army should be at oncetaken out of Cuba and sent to some point onthe northern seacoast of the United Statesthat it can bo done without danger tothe people of the United States thatyellow fever in the army at present isnot epidemic that there are only a few sporadic cases but that the army is disabled bymalarial fever to the extent that its efficiencyis destroyed and that it is in a condition to bepractically destroyed by an qpidemic of yellow fever which is sure to come in the nearfuture We know from the reports ofuompetent officers and from personal obv servationi that the army is unable tomove into the interior and that there are nofacilities for such a move if attempted andthat it could not be attempted until too

terminated after having- complete-- ly approved the reply to the UnitedStates which it is said accepts theAmerican conditionsThe reply was telegraphed to SenorCeon y Castillo the Spanish ambassador to France Saturday night so thatM Cambon the French ambassador at-Washing-ton will receive it MondayThe government is fully convincedthat the note will be satisfactory to-the Washington government and thata suspension of hostilities will be itsimmediate consequenceSenor Sagasta the premier has justconcluded his conference with thequeen regent Her majestj approvesthe general lines of the reply of Spainto Americas peace terms which SenorSaTgasta explained to herThe reason for postponing the cabinet council until G oclock Sundayevening was that the note was not yetfully drawn up The government believes that the United States will ac-- cept Spains answer which will certainly reach the white house 03 Tues-day As a consequence of the UnitedStates accepting the reply hostilitieswill immediately afterwards be suspendedAs the reply to the American terms-was only submitted to the queen regent Sunda3 all the reports of her approval Saturday of the American deiniands are necessarily without foundationMadrid Aug S According to themost reliable sources of informationthe Spanish note is couched inified language It asserts that Spainbows to the force of circumstanceshaving- done nothing to provoke thewar into which she has beeningly led in the defense of her rights- and territoryIt expresses a willingness to appoint-delegates to meet the American commission to discuss a regime for thePhilippinesWashington Aug 8 Although asyet without official confirmation of thereport from Paris that the Spanishgovernment has decided to accept theterms laid down by the United States- as essential to the negotiation of atreaty of peace the officials here areproceeding under the conviction thattie end has come and are givingtion to the steps to be taken next Inview of the delay in coming to thisVtyconciusi6ntHa Idea was begin hihg toprevail that the Spanish governmentwas about to enter a plea in abatetment and that the answer would againbe inconclusive In this case thepresident was disposed to deal firmlywith the issue to give notice that ourproposals were withdrawn and to letit be understood that when Spainagain sued for peace the conditions would be more severethan those first laid down If theSpanish answer should embody an effort to secure any material change inthe conditions it will meet with promptrejection Some reference has been-made in the dispatches of Britishnewspapers to a desire on the part ofthe Spanish government to include inthe preliminarj agreement a clauseexempting it from liability forthe Cuban debt The formal statement of -the points of the UnitedStates notes given out from the whitehouse made no reference to this sub-ject and it can not be known as yetwhether or not the full text showsanything more But presuming thatno reference whatever is made to theCuban debt it is possible the subjectmay be regarded as one that should betreated by the peace commissionerswho are to meet later to for the treatywhich of course will embody-many details that are left untouched in the main propositionthough cabinet officers have authorized the statement that no partof the Cuban or Porto Rican debtswould be assumed 03 the UnitedStates Based upon the AssociatedPress reports of the progress beingmade at Madrid toward returning the-answer of Spain it was calculated bythe department officials that the formal note could not be delivered to thepresident before Monday and that-was also the belief of the French ambassadorAttack by Sea on San Juan ReportedWashington Aug S At midnighttan unofficial report was current thatthe

cameand hundreds of blue Irish eyes were onthe two speakers as they ascended therostrum Henry opened and as a bidfor the Irish vote he told in witheringterms how Johnson when in congressbefore had voted against a bill for anappropriation to assist Ireland during atime of famine He himself had doneyeoman work for the passage of the billwhile this other man who was nowasking their support had done everything possible to defeat it It was a finepoint and the speaker made the mostof it burning before it the lamp of hiseloquence until the crowd were wildwith excitement Then Henry sat downand
