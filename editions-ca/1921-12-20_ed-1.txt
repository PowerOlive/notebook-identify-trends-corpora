H.Thompson, Conceded StrongestCandidatcFor SpeakershipH. C. DUFFY MAY WITHDEAWI With the opening of the 1922 session of the General Assembly buttwelve days away, Democrats arealready preparing to watch withkeen interest the events which willtranspire there for the next threemonths, the party again having control of jDoth legislative branches ofthe assembly despite a Republicanadministration.The Assembly will convene Tuesday, January 3. On Monday, theday preceeding, the Democraticmembers of both the Senate and theHouse will gather in a caucus to organize both branches for the comingsession. The caucus of the party'smembers of the House of Representatives will be held in the body'shall at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.The Senate caucus will be held at 8o'clock that night.Official calls for both conferenceswere issued during the past week byJudge Charles Harain, of Harrodsburg, chairman of the DemocraticState Central and Executive Committees. There are but three candidates forSpeaker of the House at the presenttime. Jas. H. Thompson, of Bourbon county, Democratic floor leaderduring the last session, Ira D. Smith,of Hopkinsville, and H. C. Duffy, ofCynthiana, are the candidates.Henry Lawrence, of Cadiz, until ashort time ago also sought thisoffice. He withdrew, however, andhis support has been cast to Representative Smith.Central Kentucky politicians forecast the election of Mr. Thompsonas Speaker. He entered the race forthis place at an early date and isknown to have already obtainedpledges of support from a large number of Democratic members of theHouse. Central Kentucky, .northernand eastern Representatives are expected, to vote for him., Mr. Smith is regarded as the mostlikely winner should Mr. Thompsonfail to marshal sufficient support toobtain the Speakership. Representative Duffy, according, to- many- politicians will withdraw his name ar acandidate when the caucus is convened and throw whatever Supporthe may have to Thompson. Shouldthis occur Thompson will undoubtedly be elected.OUR STOEE TO BE OPEN NIGHTSUNTIL- CHEISTMASIN OEDEE TO ACCOMMODATEOUE HOLIDAY CUSTOMEES OUESTOEE WILL BE OPEN EVEEYNIGHT UNTIL CHEISTMAS(x ) A.

Similar actionhas been taken in' all. the L. & N.shops in the State. In. the Louisville shops over 1,200 shopmen havebeen deprived temporarily of employment. "Elimination of time and one-halfpay provisions in the code of working rules governing railway maintenance of way laborers is the outstanding change in new ruTes promulgated by the United States Railroad Labor Board to replace ruleslaid down under Federal cdntrol.The rules became effective Dec.16, just one year after the agreement was made between the UnitedStates Railroad Administration andthe United Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes and RailroadShop Laborers.Under normal traffic conditions585,000 men would be affected, andthe new rules would result in cutting many millions of dollars from-railroad pay rolls. At present amuch smaller number of men is affected, and due to the fluctuationalseasonal nature of their work, ho esf imate of the savings to the roads ispossible.The new rules retain the eighthour day for maintenance of waylaborers in accordance with its previous decisions recognizing it as thebasic working day. They specificallyrequire eight hours' work to constitute the recognized eight-hour day.The rules also include employes engaged in the maintenance of telegraph, telephone and sfgnal systemsand make it possible for them to bebrought under the new ten-hourovertime rule.Time and a half for Sunday andnon-day work, -provided for in someinstances under former rules, iseliminated. When called out for lessthan a day's work period onN Sunday, however, employes are to bepaid three hours' pay for two hours'work.Time and a half pay for hoursworked before and after the regularworking hours is eliminated, exceptfor the time in excess of ten hours.Employes called off their regularassignments and traveling in campcars under the new nilesget onlystraight-time for eight hours perday. Under the national agreementthey drew one-half time for theperiodbetween iO a. m. and 6 am.Neither the railroad managementsnor the employes' organization haveyet placed before the board any proceedings looking to a readjustmentof the wage scale.HANDKERCHIEFSOUR LINE OF MADEBIA ANDDONEGAL HAND - EMBROIDEREDHANDKERCHIEFS IS COMPLETE!(tf ) FRANK & CO.HNE CHRISTMAS LINELECT FROM-TOSE-Perfumes, toilet waters, satchesand toilet articles.

It Is a sort of commonground 6n which we all meet for, atleast, one day In the year.In its religious aspect the festival;u U a remembrance of the Christianf . faith the gift of God to the world ofa divine Savior. Out of that centraland dominant idea, no doubt, grew uptke practice of selecting Christmas,above all other seasons, as the timefr friends to bestow gifts upon oneanother, and, for all who can, to extend charity to those In need.Although not so old as the religiousfeature, the domestic and social features of the festival date back to veryarly times, at any rate, to times thatare early In our history.For centuries Christmas has beenpre-eminently a season of home-.gath-ring,when absent ones return andthe family circle Is once more completed, or as nearly completed as thechanges end chances of life make possible. With home-coming was associated good cheer, and so Christmascame to be a seasonvof feasting andBterrymaking.In England during the Middle- ages,and for many generations after theMiddle ages had closed, the Christ--ssasseason, which included at leasta whole week, and liturgically 40 days,was given over -to merrymaking offmrious kinds, some of which havegene the way ot many of the customsf our forefathers.

Indeed.Bishop Taylor In his "Great Exemplar"remarks that the" first carol Is thehymn of the apgels to the shepherdsin the plains of Bethlehem:"Glory to God In the highest, andon earth peace, good will toward men."In the Fifteenth century carols werewidely uaed throughout Europe. Infact, the first pieces printed by thevery first printers were carols. In oneof the oldest collections appears "TheBoar"s Head," which used to be sungas that old Qlsh was carried to thetable during the Christmas revelry:Ths Boar's Head In bands I bringWith garlands gay and birds singing;I pray you all to help roe sing"Qui estla In convlvlo!"'The Boar's Head" represents oneof the convivial carols or 'jolle chansons," which had their place at tliefeasts, dances and other gay festivities of the Christmas season.In Shakespeare's time bands ofItinerant singers used to wander aboutthe streets and make their caroJry apretext for getting money."During the Eighteenth century carolry declined greatly, and many of thequaint old customs which had markedChristmas festivals for centuries became obsolete.Carolry still exists In parts of England. In Wales It has been preserved toa still greater extent, while-'lreland,too, has her Christmas caroling Intime-honored style. France has Its"Noels," and In Italy Christmas carolshave been sung since the time of StFrapds of Asslsl, who discovered thepower of sacred song In the vernacular. In churches all over the world manyof the delightful old carols are now apart of the Christmas service.Good Reason, Too.At Christmas the children of a certain provincial school tried to collectmoney by g4ng from house to housesinging carols and snatches of nymns.Many complaints reached tke rector'stars of bands at youagsters scamperig through tke first verse of VfhlleShepherds fatched," and tasst violently ringing: tke deertell. o ke Instituted Inquiries ea tke next coaaionka Ttetted tfaescfaeel."Wlsr is itb taked, "Ikaiastead' 9l staging &e hyn i a reverentI way, you scamper thgk eae versaand them, ring the beuTSilence relgmed lor a ftt tisiae,fhA a sbrfH retce freaa a aatali boyat tke bask of fee reta was bear toexplanatieau"Please, sir, If s 'caBK tkey atwafs-lets tke dec leeae attke ceeesM wrae.Charity In the" Hear.ke seaaeat far BdMaHsf tk ireef kapttaftietr ! tke kal, tke fealalfle tf ekarttf to tl kearfc-Wa-rnr ir kj vv. -vjw v i,i.c trecswpzrx irr$?

Among the folk' lore ofother countries are several quaint ateries in which animals and birds giveevidence of their adoration. A wellknown Bosnian legend offers a versionof world adoration they claim thaton the holy day "the sun in the eastbowed d6wn, the stars stood still; themountains "and forests shook andtouched the earth with their summits,and the green pine tree bent; thegrass was Deflowered with the opening of blossoms; incense sweet asmyrrh pervaded upland trod 'forest;birds sang on the mountain tops andall gave thanks to -the great God."In Bosnia on Christmas day a sheafof- rye Is put into birds' nests and birdhouses for the birds Christmas. Astranger, stranded in a Michigan townwas once ,s tar tied to see a sheaf ofrye in a bird box. He knew -immediatelythat one of his kind lived thereand was keeping Christmas In theold way.An old Indian legend tells us that. on Christmas night all the deer inthe forest kneel In adoration beforethe Great Spirit. Woe to him, however, who tries to spy upon -them.He is punished with perpetual stiffening of the knees. vMany people of the old world claimthat on Christmas night animals aregifted with speech, but none must trespass or eavesdrop.The Greater Need.Little Horace My mamma says maylie you'll give my papa a safety razortor Christmas,Department Store Santa Claus Yes,little man, I think I will.Little Bforace Hadn't you betterkeep It and use It yourself?

But sometimes the simple toy gives more real satisfactionthan the costly one.Many mechanical toys used to besold that" were poorly made. ..Theywere elaborate and handsome, andthe children would look at themopen-mouthed for a few days, untilthey refused to work. A toy of thatkind does not help a child to develop, Children should be taught to preserve their toys, but if they are somade that they go to pieces in a fewdays, the youngsterhas no incentiveto care for them.Toys are very useful "when theygive a child the opportunity to engage in some healthful sport, orgame that develops his initiative orwhen. they encourage, him to dosomething with his hands. Avsetof building blocks for instance,' leadshim to exercise skill and imagination. Substantial and well-built toysthat lead a- child to do things forhimself; can be a factor in -promotinghis development. .PEBNDEIL PLIJM PUDDINGPerndell Plum Puddings andMince Meat are no higher-.than others, and always as good as the best.(.
