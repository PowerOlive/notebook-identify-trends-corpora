DANGEROUS CURVE AHEAD
99
Rupert Hughes' Comedy Drama of American Married Life, with Remarkable Cast including
HELENE CHADWICK and RICHARD DIX
Remember "The Old Nest?" Well, Then Make Sure to See "Dangerous Curve
Ahead," Another Rupert Hushes Masterpiece.
Married life is just one danger curve after another. What are they? How can they be rounded without a crash9 Per
haps you think you know. "Dangerous Curve Ahead" shows them 4 clearly, lightly, yet with a deep insight into human
hearts. It is a picture that lives. It is something refreshingly new in the art of the screen.
Young Lovers Will Thrill Over The "Dangerous Curve Ahead!" Husbands and Wives Will LaugK a Lot Over Those
They Have Passed and Learn a Lot About Those Coming! Fathers and Mothers, Now Safe Over The Road Will Chuckle and
Weep As They Live Over The Past! "Dangerous Curve Ahead" Will Be a Performance That Will Always Be Fresh In
Your Mind.
Rupert Hughes and E. Mason Hopper worked for one year on this picture. Together they evolved the many little touch
es that make it so amazingly lifelike. We recommend it to our patrons unhesitatingly as the greatest comedy drama ever
made, a perfect entertainment from every angle.
In Addition: Juanita Hansen in "The Yellow Arm" and a "Snub" Pollard Comedy

CO-OPERATfvE MAEKET PLAN
ENDORSED BY CLUB
The directors of the Paris Com
mercial Club at their recent regular
meeting gave full and unanimous
endorsement to the co-operative to
bacco marketing plan and the fol
lowing statement has been prepared:
"We, the directors 61 the Paris
Commercial Club, believing that the
proposed Tobacco Co-operative Mar
keting Association will enhance the
general interests of farmers and
business men of Bourbon county
alike; that it proposes the most prof
itable method of tobacco marketing
through its plan of practical mer
chandising, rather than 5 the dump
ing "of the whole crop of tobacco on
the market at one time; that this
plan has proven a success as applied
to agricultural products in various
sections of the United States and in
the more progressive foreign coun
tries; do hereby endorse the propos
ed plan and urge that the farmers
who have not yet signified their wil
lingness to co-operate shall do so,
and thereby assist in placing tobacco-raising
on a more stable and
profitable basis, in improving gen
eral economic conditions, and in
bringing an era of greater happiness
and prosperity for us all."
Hot weather, says an exchange,
makes fat men fatter and thin men
thinner.
