conditionMany persons will realize after weighing the doctors remark that theirgreat desire for food at certain times isa warning that all is not well withinthem Dr Porter supports his startling statement by some interesting explanatory facts The healthy persondoes not slight his meals it must beunderstood but does ample justice tothem Yet not until he tastes the foodbefore him says Dr Porter does herealize the need of it He could goabout and forget his meal times butfor the force of circumstances Thepangs of hunger are felt as an effectof imperfect digestionDr Porter gives some valuable information on the question which andof what kind shall be the principal mealmorning noon or night In speakingof this he saidAs in the running of an engine themost intensive consumption of fuelmust be just prior to and in accordancewith the amount of work to be performed so in man the time for takingand the quantity and quality of themeal ingested or the determination ofthe principal meal must be in harmony with the work to be accomplished If the individual is to beginhis daily labors between four and sixin the morning and terminate them between five and six oclock in the evening it necessitates the taking- of a goodand liberal breakfast at an early hourin the morning from a half hour tonu hour before beginning active workespecially so if Hie last meal of the dayprevious has been a light one at sixoclock as is the common habit of thisclass Habits Of this kind naturally callfor the heaviest meal which also maybe called the principal meal at noon ornear that hourOn the other hand if the custom iato rise between six and eight in themorning- and the largest amount ofwork is performed between nine in themorning and the succeeding midnightan entirely different arrangement ofthe meals must be followed In thisclass a light breakfast is in order atabout eight in the morning a strongermore substantial meal at one oclockin the afternoon and the heaviest andwhat justly deserves to be called theprincipal meal should be taken fromjf six to seven in the evening because thisnpre nearly in the middle of theVAvorkihgiiours When the labors arecpntinued until midnight and
