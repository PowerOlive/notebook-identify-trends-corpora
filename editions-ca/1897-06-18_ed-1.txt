and jumped overboard Thefourth officer jumped overboard afterhim immediately but he failed to savethe life of the South African speculator as heavy seas were running andthe vessel was steaming at the

oclock Wednesday The senate atonce went into executive session andas soon as theN doors were closed themessage of President McKinley accompanying the treaty and the treatyitself were read to the

Grayobjected to a vote on the motion andunder the rules a single objection carried the motion over until ThursdaySenator Davis gave notice that at thenext executive session he would pressthe motion for publication as all theessential facts and almost verbatimcopy of the treaty had been publishedin the press of the country -The message of the president wasnot a very long document It dealtwith the historical facts concerningthe island and showed that the UnitedStates and Hawaii yearly grow moreclosely bound to each other Thiitwas not annexation he said butcontinuation of existing relationswith closer bonds between peopleclosely related by blood and kindredties Since 1820 said the presidentthe predominance gt the United Stateshad been known The sending of thefirst envoy there brought the islandsin closer relations with the UnitedStates and those relations had grownmore firm by succeeding events Atthe time the tripartite agreement wasmade for the government of Samoa hesaid Great Britain and Germany wanted to include Hawaii in the group overwhich a protectorate was establishedbut the suggestion was rejected by theUnited States because this government held that there already existed relations between Hawaii andthe United States which placed theislands under the especial care of thiscountry and that this governmentcould not allow any other country tointerfere in the affairs of HawaiiThe annexation of the islands saidthe president and making them partof the United States was in accordance with the established pqlicy of thiscountryThe president Wednesday

the senate had disposed of thecereals In the agricultural schedule The interest In the sugar schedule had been whettedfor -weeks and aside from the fact that morerevenue is derived from sugar than from anyother article there was the added interest due to the sensational chargesmade of late within and withoutthe senate concerning irregularitiesin connection with the progress of theschedule But the debate failed to developany dramatic incidents Senators and spectators soon lapsed into a state of indifferenceas the speeches dealt with a labrynth of technical details of vital interest to the sugar refiner and expert but nt to the general public Mr Jones Ark opened the debate tosome extent answering Mr Aid richs statement on the sugar schedule It was argumentative and lacking in severe

KINGLCopyright 18D4 by J B Lippincott CoxnThe Christmas holidays were comingon at Walton Hall where sore strickenits mistress lay hovering- between lifeand death Two -weeks had passed sincethe eventful night of the arrests andthough no change had come over thelandscape and days of sunshine werefew and far between some odd alterations had taken place in and aroundthe old homestead Of these the mostremarkable was the appearance threetimes a day of a young officer in Yankeeuniform at the family board a youngofficer who often prolonged his visituntil late in the evening Mr IsaacKewton Lambert though occupying histent in camp had become otherwise aninmate of the Walton establishmentfor unknown to the beloved invalidher daughters were actuallyboarders-f v rVitaking-Another boarder who had come andmoved a modest bachelor kit into oneof the upstairs rooms facing the eastand overlooking the little camp was MrBarton Potts better known to all theinmates as Cousin Bart Indeed itwas due in great measure to his adviceand influence that Mr Lambert was admitted Impoverished as were the Waltons in dire need as it turned outnow that the resolute woman who somany years had managed the familyaffairs was stricken down nothing butprompt action and the helping hands-of kinsfolk and friends stood betweenthem and starvation Squire PottsOld Man Potts as he wras generallycalled had urged on Mrs Walton inNovember the propriety of her abandoning the place entirely and taking shelter for herself and her daughters underhis xoof Even though in desperateneed she had declined for one reasonbecause that would bring Esther andfcWalton Scroggs together again for anther because she could not bear tovj jfthink of the old home becoming theiL abiding place of all the houseless shiftless negroes in the neighborhood Shehad offered the house garden and cotton-fieldsstill remaining in her handsto any purchaser at almost any pricebut who was there to invest in suchunprofitable estate at such a timeIn the midst of these cares andtroubles which she could share withher daughters wrere others which shecould not She durst not let themknow on how slender a thread her lifedepended That wras one secret heldas yet by their old family physician andherself alone because the knowledgeof it would bring such grief to thegirls There was another which sheprayed they might never know becauseits very existence brought such griefand shame to her Eloyd her youngestson her darling who had fought sobravely by his brothers side throughthe hottest battles of the war had abjured the faith of his fathers as shebitterly expressed it had become intimate with the federal officers and soldiers instead of sticking closely tolaw in the office of her oldfriend Judge Summers at QuitmanAnd then worse than all she learnedthrough his own desperate letter thathe had enlisted in the cavalry Thatwithin a week thereafter repenting ofhis mad folly he should have deserted the service and fled the countrywas in the poor stricken womans eyesno crime whatever That he shouldhave enlisted sworn to defend the flagwhich was to her the emblem of in-solent triumph over the fallen fortunesof ihe land

disposition to do soThe command had not been gone aweek before men were unaccountablywishing it back and when it reappeared with certain additions it wasactually welcomed by people who wouldhave scouted the possibility of such athing the year before This time ColSweet announced to the rector that hiswife and daughter would speedily follow and were even then in New Orleansawaiting Ms

offer and having nothing heldhis tongue though he could not holdhis peace That was goneThat was a wretched summer andautumn The fire raged along the gulfand cholera swooped upon the garrisonSweet got his wife and child away tothe mountains They left suddenlywhile Floyd was on a brief visit to hismother and sisters It was Decemberwhen they came back Meantime JudgeSummers had abandoned practice andgone to live at his old home at Sandbrook Mr Todd could offer youngWalton no help there was no moneyin law business just then Mattersbad toworse and Walton found himself absolutely without money to pay his boardThat made no difference to Mrs TowerShe told him his mothers boy was aswelcome as her own and made him welcome where fascination all too strongalready held Kim Something in Jennie Sweets gentle manner had changedShe was nervous ill at ease and soughtto avoid him Something in hermothers manner too was very different And one day the truth came outThe frequency with which letters began

as a wealthygentleman from Philadelphia a fewyears older than Genevieve but a mostcharming person Genevieve herselfsaid little or nothing but looked nonetoo radiant Col Sweet said less butlooked much

and lodge himand here from serving his customerswith drink he got to serving himselfand to associating with a regular setsome young townsmen some soldiersThere were stories of gambling andquarrel even before Col Sweet foundthat Jenny the apple of his eye wasdrooping in that southern climate andsent her with her mother north forgood The next thing heard of FloydWalton was that he had gone to NewOrleans with a discharged soldier- andeven while grieving over her bo3s infrequent letters and evident hopelessness and depression Mrs Walton received a missive one day that left herprostrate She went alone to Quitmanas soon as able to move and came backwithin 4S hours looking years olderand both the gfirls soon knew that shehad parted with the diamond earringsthat were their fathers last gift to herin the happy prosperous days that preceded the war Floyd had written thatstarving drunk or drugged and desperate he had been led by his associatebefore a recruiting officer had beensent with others as reckless as himselfto sober up at the quarters of a cavalrycommand near the city and that thenext thing he knew he with a squad ofseven recruits was on his way to join atroop stationed

insolence triedher temper but could not alter her toneand bearing It was not until he wasgone that Estfier trembling and intears came and begged her to lodge nocomplaint against the man as he indeed knew more than she supposedAnd then in reply to her mothers demand Esther brokenly admitted thatshe had already heard of Floyds enlistment and desertion through thisvery soldier He had been at the

stairs unfastened the side door and came at onceupon the intruders with the result already known Not until aroused bythe screams of Elinor and his sisterKate did Floyd know anything of theaffair Half

ObservtttioiiHMr D L Ditmars exploded some oldideas about rattlesnakes in a paper readrecently before the Linnaean society inthis cityAmong the specimens in my collection he said are two young diamondback rattlesnakes born in a friends collectiQn in Florida and sent to me before they had ever tasted food Immediately upon their arrival a youngmouse was given to each and as soonas the little creatures were introducedinto the cages the snakes drew backtheir heads in true viperine fashionstriking the little animals which diedin less than a minute After being carefully examined the mouse was seizedby the head and swallowed withoutmore ado This happened more than ayear ago and it is interesting to statethat the snakes which were at thattime about 15 inches long with a smallsoft button on the tail representingthe future rattle and hardly able toswallow a large mouse are now powerful rattlesnakes over three feet inlength with six rattles and feedingvoraciously upon full grown ratsThe following observations weremade upon these rattlesnakes BornSeptember 4 1895 length about 15inches skin shed for the first timeabout twa days after birth one jointof the rattle present which is soft andnot only positively refuse to appear as rubber like and anchylosed to the taila witness in the case but will prohibitany of her household from soappearingSunday morningAnd possibly the lady of Walton Hallfelt quite assured that her mandateoverruled any subpoena the federalauthority could draft One tlyng iscertain when Close read it over a sec-j ond time he handed it to Lambertthe snke is unable to make any soundwith it although it frequently shakesthe tailAsthetimeapproachedforthesecondshedding of the skin the tail at the endbesran to exhibit a slisrht swelling-which grew gradually larger andlargerand when uncovered by the old skinproved to be a second joint of the rattle All the succeeding joints have beenacquired in the same manner the jointitself not being visible until uncoveredby the old skin After the second jointwas uncovered the snake was still unable to rattle as the new joint was softand seemed finnly joined to the original button but in a few days thisjoint dried turning a dark straw colorits previous color being black and theserpent sounded its first war note somethree and a half months after birthIn habits those snakes are muchdifferent from moccasins for while thelatter will eat frogs birds or rats thesereptiles will take rats only always killing the prey before swallowing it whilethe moccasins to the contrary seize afrog or bird and sinking the fangs intothe victim begin to swallow it whilethe creature is yet in its death strugglesThe interesting and valuable pointderived from the raising of these snakeswas the growth of the rattle Thesnakes were born with a soft joint onthe tail and did not acquire a secondjoint until three and a half monthsafter birth The number gained during the first year was five in all thusexploding the general belief that thereptile gains a joint every year and thatthe age of the snake may be told by thenumber of joints of the rattle Yet theage of the serpent may be roughly estimated by the general shape of the rattle For instance the snake is- bornwith a small button on the tail andgains on an average of three or fourjoints a year each joint being largerthan its predecessor in proportion tothe snakes growth Thus the rattle assumes an acuminate shape As timewears on the old joints of the rattle become broken and lost but are beingconstantly replenished by new onesAfter i onie years the growth of thesnake ceases from his own observations the writer would say between fiveand six years and the joints addedafter this period are uniform in sizeThus if the rattle is acuminate thesnake is still growing three joints fora year in temperate regions and four intropical latitudes hut if the joints arouniform in size the reptile is an old oneand no conclusion may be reached byan examination of the rattleAs a conclusion to these observations let us sum up the more valuabledetails first that these snakes are bornas fully provided with fangs and venomas their parents second that the skinis shed a few days after birth thirdthe young rattlesnakes are born with asoft button on the tail and from birthshow the habit of shaking the caudalappendage fourth that these snakesreared in captivity eat more readilythan those captured some time afterbirth And lastly that the colors arebrighter than on their relatives thathave been constantly exposed to themerc3r and fickle mood of the elements2T Y

communicants in the Boman Catholic churchHe found no opposition from the Bomanists to his work and they encouraged him He was welcomed by thepress and the educated people whowhile they did not themselves believe inChristianity wanted the common people to believe in it for the moral goodit did the communityI cannot begin to express the condition existingthereat that time said thedoctor The

situated as they arein one of the best agricnltural regions inthe world are to be felicitated for theirexcellent judgment in adopting improved methods in farming without being governed by prejudice or hearsayTo the farmers of Johnson County whohave been familiar with the Windstacker since its introduction in 1891discussions at this time concerning themeritsof the Wind stacker must beamusing When they know that theyhave straw stacks that have stood forthree four and five years with the strawbright and clean a few inches below thesurface they certainly cannot helpwondering why the Wind stacker couldanywhere be coijdemmed because thestraw would not keep The geographical position of the County the whole ofwhich lies within forty miles of the capital City of the State makes it readilyaccessible to the agents of all the agricultural implement manufacturers Forthat reason this County is particularlyfavored in having the first opportunityto receive and judge of new inversionsWe suppose the contests by agents forsales of machinery are as keen here asthey could possibly be anywhere Iftherefore there should be any weakresses or defects in a machine the agents ofcompeting machinery would be svrift todiscover them and point them out tobuyers The fact is that a thresherrnanin this County to da3r without a windstacker has very little to do and noneof them thinks of buying a new machinewithout it Farmers will no longer endurethe disagreeableand arduous laborrequired in stacking straw nor can theysecure hands in a busy season to do suchwork The

PATIENTBy Charles W Harwood H DOR half an hour past Dr Sanbornhad been certain that he was on thewrongroad The main highway ranstraight to Winchester but he hadcome upon unfamiliar dips and turnsgoon after leaving his patients houseRather than risk another mistake hedrove straight on There were outlying villages all about the city andbefore long he must reach some thoroughfare leading toward homej It was nearly midnight The sky was- thick and a lantern hanging over thea lasher barely showed the breadth offs this forest bordered wayThe reins hung slack from the doctors hands but suddenly he tightenedthem and grasping his whip leaned- forward to pierce the darkness aheadbetween the jogging steps of his horseL Jhe had caught the sound of quick softj iootf alls upon the dust of the roadTt was a timeand place for cautionDr Sanborn presently saw a mans figure in the road before him He held thewhip ready to lash his horse onwardbut the stranger turned to one side andlialted at a discreet distanceSay are you a doctor he calledout hreathless with runningYes What do you want Withoutxelaxing his guard at all Dr Sanbornjf mTillpri nr Ti hnvaFor Gods sake come with me71 Theres a fellow

dog you know you wouldnt-- doctor- Thats so Well Ill see yourfriend Go ahead and lead the wayThank you doctor It isnt farWith a look of relief he faced aboutand ran on just in front of the carriage Meanwhile strange stories weret flashing through Dr Sanborns mindOn such pretexts men had been enticed4 away and robbed yet he resolutely- quelled all suspicion and touched up hisi horse The tramps face had been sharpwith unfeigned distressSoon after emerging from the woodsl1 the man ran off to one side and stoodan a driveway leading back to somebuildingIn here doctor he called as the carriage drove up We crept into an oldbarn for the night Let me hitch yourhorse and cover himWith medicine case and lantern inhaffd Dr Sanborn followed his guideo winging- tne ngnt around he sawJt Vi- jKjsKsf

plea for sympathy Allthat was best in life he had long sinceflung away but there were still humanties to whicli he could appeal From hisfriends unconscious face he glancedin some hesitation at Dr SanbornWill he be better soon he venturedspeaking softlyNo I fear not The doctor hesitated It seemed cruel not to offer thecomfort of simple frendliness It isall I can say he added with an impulse of good will At best the matteris serious and I cant tell what may beback of thisIs it pneumonia Dick asked aftera short silenceXo its worse than pneumoniaDr Sanborn returned to his patientIt was time for some improvement butan hour passed by in apparently futileministrations Never had diseaseseemed so merciless or the strongestdrugs so impotentDick stood by ready to give aid whenneeded Presently he dropped upon hisknees and impulsively clasped hisfriends hand Its very touch seemed toawe him and looking up he asked onetremulous questionDoctor is he dyingThere was no answer and shakenby an irrepressible sob the man creptawaj With every sense intent upon theslightest changes of pulse and breathDr Sanborn took no heed of his gojngThe silence grew oppressive Dick soonreturned and sittingdown bowed hishead upon his handsIhate to lose Will this way he saidmournfully Weve been together along time now Will ran awar fromhome because he thought his fatherwas working him too hard but it wasnteasy to find work elsewhere and hetook to tramping with meThis last year hes been getting tiredof it Many a time of late hes said tome Ah Dick a man cant get anything worth having unless he worksfor it steady mind you Dick hewould say steadyAll this passed the doctors ears unheeded He was reading a more absorbing story and its climax was nearat hand There lies the romance of aphysicians life The nights adventureand his strange surroundings scarcelymoved Dr Sanborns imagination butit stirred his blood to feel the pulsegrowing stronger under his fingers andthe deadly chill passing awayFor almost incredulously he admitted the fact It had been a longfight and his eyes sparkled with triumphDick Avas still talking It was onlya variation of the old sad story butsomething in his manner of speechseemed incongruous and the doctorflashed a critical glance over himYou were a man of some educationhe remarked abruptlyI Dick queried in surprise OhI had an academy course He gave ashamed uneasy laugh They used tothink Id study for the ministryWhere are they now asked thedoctor quietljDead A moment passed in silenceThere wasnt any trouble with myscholarship I lacked something

suggested Hemade me promise I wouldnt tellthemI havent promised the doctor rejoined decisively However I cantleave him yet There is a good chancefor recovery now and we must fight itout alone- An hour later- the sick boy openedhis eyes and half consciously raisedboth hands to his temples My headaches he muttered drowsily and soondropped fo sleep again tIt is the medicine Dr Sanborn ex-He has had

air was Drawing a long breathof relief he wrapped his overcoat closely about him uncovered the horse anddrove away kIn the darkness it would have beeneasy toniiss his destination but hekept a sharp outlook and at last descried the Forrest house looming indistinctly upon the rightThe night was still but no one seemedto be roused by his coming He walkedup the gravel path to the front doorand drumming soundly on a panelstepped away to watch the upper windows Presently a sash was raisedabove his headWho is there asked a well knownvoiceI am Dr Sanborn Mr Forrest Ihave urgent business with youThe window was closed and a faintmurmur of voices dropped out into thehush Dr Sanborn fastened his horseand went back to the doorstep Knowing Wills father as a stern and silentman he had already begun to doubtthe- issue of his intercessionA glimmering light shone throughthe close shutters of the hall and descended the stairs There was a rattleof bolts the door was opened and a tallspare man came forward hastilyclothed but erect and dignifiedYou may enter he said gravelyIn austere silence he led the way intothe parlor and solemnly confronted hisvisitor as one who expects the worstIn the chill of the early morning helooked old and graySir are you a messenger of good orof evil he askedPerhaps of both the doctor repliedAir Forrest have you a son 3The mans stern face softened a little as his wife entered the room andcame quickly to his side But he hadbeen deeply wounded by Wills desertionI had a son he answered grimlylDont say that father his wifepleaded He is always our son 0doctor have you any news of WillieOne could read unshaken love in hqrappealing eyes Dr Sanborns smilewas sufficient reply and with a gladand grateful look she hurried from theroomHer husbands lips were still set inunrelenting lines He was a proud andjust man and he waited for some tokenof Wills repentanceMr Forrest said the doctor impressively do you believe in the storyof the prodigal sonIt was a touch upon the quick and thefather bowed his head Oh if he wouldonly come back he groanedHe has come back said the doctorTo night he lies sick in a barn not fitfor your cattle He has fallen by theway but he was coming home if onlyto look upon your face againThe old man raised his hand he couldbear no more Soon a light touch clungupon the doctors arm and Mrs Forrest stood beside him hastily dressedfor the night air Her worn face wasfairly aglow with joyDoctor Im going to my boy Therewas a deep thrill in her voice whichstrongly moved the young man Whereis he What shall I take to himSome one must stay here and prepare for him was the gentle replyYou can do that best Your husbandwill go with meWith a quick nervous stride Mr Forrest started for the Carriage while hiswife hurried to get the necessary wrapsIt was all one to her so long as shecould work for WillThey drove in silence The roll ofcarriage wheels announced their coming and Dick was waiting outside thedoorWhere is my son Mr Forrest askedhoarselyAt the farther end resting quietlysir Hes been talking about the oldfolks doctor Im glad you have comeAs they entered the barn Dr Sanborn laid a warning hand on the oldmans arm Remember to controlyourself- ne has been very near todeath this nightI will I will Only let me seehim But even with the words uponhis lips he sprang into the bay and ashe knelt and caught Will into his armsthe boy opened his eyes upon his fathers faceWill my son The fathers vpicewas choken and broken and Will sobbedaloudFather I didnt treat you righthe faltered Im going- to do betterson It was all the old

Xawlgable Allthe Year ArcmntlNavigation on Lake Michigan is neverclosed Steamers run back and forthacross the lake and between the portsof the west shore of the lake during theentire winter with remarkable regularity The first attempts at winter navigation on the translake routes weremade by the Detroit Milwaukee Bailroad company and by the now defunctEngelmann Transportation companymany years ago and the success of winter ventures became established as thecharacter of the steamers was improvedand developments were made in marineenginery Now winter navigationprocceds almost uninterruptedly and thenew car ferries steam back and forthwith little regard for weather or forice The success of the car ferries onLake NGchigan and the car ferry whichdefies winter in the Straits of Mackinacis probably the cause of the announcement that negotiations are in progresslooking to the construction of icebreaking freight steamers that will enable their owners to keep them in commission on the Lake Superior and lowerlake route during the winter The report is without foundationThere is a vast difference betweenthe navigation of Lake Michigan fromone shore to the other and along itswest shore and the navigation of thegreat lakes throughout their lengthsand through the interlake channels Icebreaking is expensive and occasionallythe ice floes defy the crushing powers ofthe best of the so called ice breakersOne of the car ferries was recentlystalled by a floe near Menominee whichdefied not only the steamer but theexplosive power of dynamite Thetrouble of winter navigation on thechain of lakes would occur in the interlake channels and in the canals Owing to the clogging effects of the ice itwould be almost impossible to operatecanals during midwinterAnother and a very serious bar togeneral lake navigation in winter is theprevalence of snowstorms duringwhich nothing whatever can be seenSnow is more obstructive to the sightthan fog and during a driving snowstorm it is impossible to see anythingahead even in the daytime Winternavigators on Lake Michigan who arenever out of sight of land for any greatlength of time experience their chiefannoyance from the snowstorms Theymanage to steam into port when snowis flying thick because of their familiarity with the route but thev occasionally get into trouble while they arewrapped in the tumultuous privacy ofthe sTormIt does not follow by any means thatbecause winter navigation is successful on Lake Michigan it can be onadesuccessful in the upper and lower lakeservice Milwaukee WisconsiniLV ftA CITY IN A VOLCANOThe Picturesque and Peculiar Cityof Snlm in tlie West IndiesIf you will take down your geographies and look on the map of the WestIndies you will notice between theislands of Santa Cruz and St Christopher two small islets which unlessyour map is an unusually large andcomplete one will have no names givenThese two islands belong to the Dutchand the most northerly and westerlyof them is called SabaThe Dutch are noted for their oddand quaint customs and for their perseverance Holland being sometimescalled the Land of Pluck but I doubtif anywhere in all their possessionshave these curious people shown theirqueer and eccentric habits to greateradvantage than- in the little out-of-the-wayisland of SabaThe island is small its greatest diameter being not over 2 miles and it isnothing more than an isolated mountain top rising out of the sea Thesides are very steep and high risingin places for a sheer 2000 feet Thereis no harbor no beach no safe anchorage and no large trees on the islandAlthough Saba has a population of over230Q yet you might sail all around itwithout seeing any signs of houses orsettlements If you wished to land orgo aboard as the Sabans say youwould have to do so on a shelving rockon the southern side of the island andhere you would find a steep windingflight of stone steps leading up therocky mountain sideFollowing these steps which number S00 and are called The Ladderyou at last reach the top of the mountain and looking inland see a smallgrassy plain covered with neat whitered roofed houses the whole surrounded on every side by towering peaks andprecipices covered with tree ferns bamboos and wild plantains This littletown the only one on the island isknown as The Bottom a curiousname surely but it is well namednevertheless

and women whoseem utterly oblivious of the value ofthe refinements of human life in molding the character The remark is frequently made in describing certain individuals that they are well educatedbut utterly without culture This iscertainly a contradiction A properlyeducated person must be culturedthat is she must have so thoroughlydigested hei knowledge that it hasmodified and refined her characterThe meaning however is clear andconveys a truth that ought to be generally recognized by parents Learning is not culture nor knowledge wisdom We cannot lead our children intoa higher life by surrounding them -bysordid and coarse associations andthen by one supreme effort in expenditure as a sort of financial speculationsend them through college Such aneducation seldom pays considered fromthe lowest standpointThe education of a child begins at itsmothers knee and continues until thechild arrives at mature years Thehome education is far more lasting thanthe school education Surround

Every good book whichis brought to the house is an investmentin the education of the children Everygood engraving hung upon the wallsmolds the taste Keep the Avails bare-until you can afford to hang

BetterThis Way Than ly a CompassThat sailors prefer not to steer bycompass must have struck you as onecurious fact Here is another Asteersman can keep his ship better onher course at night if it be clear thanduring the day Look ahead get a starand steady her head by it So says theA B of the ocean to the sailor who hasnot yet won his degree Por to thehelmsman the stars are like the pillarof fire in Scripture They are the handson the dial of the night They twinklegood evening to poor Jack as he sitsup aloft or stands at the helm and winkgood morning and good by to himwith daylight It is obvious that tlieto or off movement of a vessel canbe more quickly detected by a smallbright object like a star dead aheadthan by the monotonous sweep of thehorizon or by peering into the compass box The same ancient marinerwho told me about measuring thelength of the off and in shore legs bythe life of candles told me that oncewhen the oil in the binnacle lamps gaveout and he was steering by a star heoccasionally struck a match and lookedat the compass to see if the star hadmoved anv He was a genuine seacook this ancient mariner being steward of the vessel on which I was sailing and he would bob up out of thecooks galley amidships like a seal bobbing up through a hole in the ice andproceed to spin yarnsWhen the lookout sings out Landho and has replied to the officersWhere away a star over the rock orother danger may be noted and broughtdown in line with the point on the compass and its proper bearing obtainedThe stars said a sea captain tome move apparently from east to west-aso that when we find our first star will -no longer do we select another This isthe case with all but the north or polarstar which is in line with two certainstars in the Great Bear or Dipper andthe orbit is so small that it is a goodguide for all night and we can even detect errors of the compass by itThe north star is of course as trueas or even truer than the most accurate compass To the other thingsthat sailors steer by the compass ishowever what steam is to electricityTo produce an electric light you requirea dynamo to run the dynamo you needsteam You may feel the wind on yourmoist brow or hand but the directionfrom which it blows you can except incase of the regular trade winds or unless you are up in sea lore tell onlyfrom the compass Then by sailingclose to the wind jtou can keep on that -coursewithout looking at tl2 compass But the sailors naturally have alarge accumulation of weather lore andin addition in the trades there areexcept in case of violent storms certainregularities in the winds in certainparts of the ocean and certain other recurring signs which the helmsman canutilize and which often enable him todispense with the compass altogetherPor

fly sucks bloodfrom cattle and so irritates them asno doubt to retard the iaying on offiesh with beef cattle ami the production of milk by milch cowsMany substances have been recommended to keep away the flies TheMississippi experiment station recommends two parts cottonseed oil or iishoil and one part pine tar This stationapplied this j mixture to 350 head ata total cost for material of S5220sene emulsion has also been used spraying iVover the oatle with a knapsacksprayer The flies are killed by theemulsion if it touches them The emulsion may be made by mixing at the rateof one pint of -soft soap or one fourthpound of hard -soap dissolved m boiling water -and one pint of keroseneIn 25 pints of water thoroughly whippedtnd churned togetherAt the IDndiana experiment stationwe have triad

very desirable but where only small quantities are planted a stake and line mustbe depended upon The great troublewith a line is that after having markeda row by it and shifted the last end forthe next row you must walk back doing nothing the whole length of therow whether long or short to shift thefirst end This year I hit on the following contrivance which I have neverseen described and ft is a great helpBesides the line with a reel a on oneAHillWnVfrr-IIIHA CONVENIENT MARKERoend and a stick b on the other havetwo smooth sticks c with roundedtops like theupper part of a broomhandle Drive

cord isnow as shown by the continuous lineMark or plant from e to a Put in theother new stick at b lightly Take upthe end stick at a and pull so hard onthe line that the stick at fc leans overand the cord slips off Stretch the cordtight around the stick b and drive theother end of stick firmly at c Thecord now appears as the dotted line andit will have been shifted for the secondrow without loss of time or unnecessary walking You are always workingtoward the one stick and away from thetwo sticks In this way you can plantan indefinite number of rows and onlycross the ground without planting

of others who owe theirhealth and vigor to Dr Williams PinkPills Mr Marshall never hesitates to singtheir praises In his case it was necessaryto use only a few boxes of the pills to restorehim to the full possession of bodily healthHis digestive organs had become almost useless through a long and serious illness butin a surprisingly brief period through theagency of this wonderful medicine theywere capable of again performing theirfunctions in a regular and perfectly satisfactory manner In narrating his experience with them Mr Marshall saidLast spring I was rtaken sick with inflammatory rheumatism and my entire systemwas affected To relieve the suffering itwas necessary to paint me with iodineAfter three months treatment i became convalescent but the attack had sapped mystrength and left me extremely weak andfeeble I could scarcely lift an arm or a legThis weakness permeated my entire systemand applied as well to my stomach and digestive apparatus as to my limbs I soondiscovered that I had lost my appetite almostas completely as though I never had oneI had no desire whatever to partake of anynourishment and the natural result was thatmy convalescence was extremely -slow andmy parents feared that I was going to suffera Relapse or fall prey to another ailment onaccount of my debilitated conditionMany a day 1 would not take any nourishment and whenever I did the quantitywas too insignificant to materially hastenmy improvement Tempting dishes wereprepared for me btztl could not touch themI began to become anore or less alarmed asdid my parents andone day my mother

Pennsylvania town not far from the American encampment at Valley ForgeWithin this humble home Made Lee agirl of tender years sat by the bedside ofher feeble grandfather trying to divert hismind from the unpleasant news they hadreceived that morningWord was sent that Allen Lee had beenarrested on the serious chargCrOf intendingto reveal plans of the American army tothe enemy Lee indignantly denied thecharge but his word was not sufficient toenable him to escape imprisonment andthe trial he would have to undergo nextday He proved a gallant soldier and hadgained the good will of General Washington but the documents found on his person made a very dark outlook for himIt was a long dreary day for the prisoner at Valley Forge and a very sad one forMadge and her grandfatherMy son arrested for being a traitorjmoaned the old man Oh I cant believeit It is too dreadful to endure and hewrung his hands in despairv Yes grandfather it is hard for ussaid Madge as she brushed the silvery locksfrom the wrinkled brow But do notworry I know father is not a traitor forsomething tells me that his name will yetbe clearedHeaven bless you Madge replied theold man as he raised his eyes Let uspray for the justification of your fathersgood name It cant be that he must diea traitor my son bo brave and trueNo no assured Madge He willnotThe old man closed his weary eyelidsand it was not long until the regularbreathing told Madge that he sleptAs she rose and moved to the windowshe seeded filled with light and strengthand her rapid thoughts flew hither andthither seeking to plan a way to help herfatherIf I could see General Washingtonthought Madge he might listen to meaiu Jiclp fatherI will go she said resolutely to herself Grandfather will be likely to sleepwhile I am gone she continued as sheglanced on the careworn features Itwould kill him if father were condemnedto die and then I should die too Madgewas naturally a timid girl but there wasunfaltering decision now in all her quickactionsWrapping her cloak about her she quietly descended the stairs and passed into theclear light of the bright afternoonShe hurried along the frozen path whichled across the fields to Valley ForgeTwice she slipped and fell but filled withher great purpose she went dauntlessly onAt length she came in sight of the encampment How cheerless was the sconeThe very atmosphere was gray with coldand the sound that came to her seemedlike the voice of winterMadge went hurriedly to the door andwas at once bidden to enter GeneralWashington rose and acknowledged hercourtesy by a low bow of his stately headShe did not know how fair she lookedthat afternoon The sharp wind hadbrought a vivid color to her cheeks andthe crystals of snow shone through hercurls like glistening dewdrops She wasmuch frightened and endeavored to keepfrom trembling as she heard the generalsvoice when he asked how he could serveherI came sir to speak with you of t hecase of my father faltered MadgeWhat is your name my child askedthecommander jn chief Madge Lee shereplied And your father is AllenLee said Madge quicklyWashingtons brow wrinkled he loweredhis eyes and his firm lips pressed closerOh sir said Madge beseechinglywill you not save my father I know heis not a traitor for there is no braver soldier no truer American in the worldThe pathetic tremor of the young girlsvoice affected Washington My childsaid he as he looked in her wide shiningeyes I give you my promise that I willdo all I can to aid your father It may bethat he is innocent but the papers foundin his possession cast a dark suspicion overhim Perhaps there is some mistakecontinued the general encouragingly 1will look into the case at onceOh thank you sir said Madge asshe stepped from the door and hurriedhomeward with the good newsShe held the vision of his face and stately form constantly before her and whenthe bugle call rang forth in the distanceher lips trembled with happinessThe father of such a daughter cannotbe very bad no matter how dark is thesuspicion cast on him remarked Washington to himself as he watched Madgehurrying on in the distance There mustbe some mistake I will investigate thecase without delayMeanwhile the old man slept and whenMadge reached her home she quietly entered and crept softly up the stairs Shefound her grandfather seated in a lowchair by the window His eyes were closedand his chin was tipped high showing thelines of distress about his mouthAt the sight of the pallor of his faceMadge lightly crossed theloom and kneeling beside the chair threw her arms abouthim He felt her warm lips upon his browand opened His eyesGrandfather she cried Ihave seenGeneral Washington and he has promisedto help fatherMadge gasped the old man and hiswasted frame trembled with emotionThe next day Madge received a letterbearing a large red seal She quicklyopened the note and read the followingMiss Lee Your fathers case has receivedmy attention and I am pleased to inform youthat he is innocent of the crime cruelly chargedagainst him The real traitor has been discovered It was this fellow jealous of yourfathers success who concealed the papers onhim and brought about his arrest Of yourfathers promotion I need not speak for hewill be with you soon to tell you all May thegreat blessing of peace and joy rest on the Leehousehold Geokge WashingtonIsnt he kind
