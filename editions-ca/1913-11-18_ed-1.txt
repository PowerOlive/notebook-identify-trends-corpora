I have systematicallyrefused to deal off-hand, with,this important problem, as so many of theinterviews expect. It is one of vastimportance and complexity. Thereare many avenues of approach' to it;imany controlling factors and no simple remedy. But I am not One of thepessimists. I do not entertain thethought for a second that we have approximated the limit of our outputfrom the soil. -As a matter of fact,we have just begun to attack theproblem. We have not even reachedthe end of the pioneering stage andhave only- in a very few localities developed conditions where maximumreturns may be secured. But wehaveunmistakably reached the periodwhere we imust think and plan ourwork. We can no longer rely on thebounty of nature. There are evidences that providence is casting itsprotective supervision of fools andAmericans. Conditions are emerging which if rfot fundamentally dealtwith will lead us into serious embarrassments. It is well for us to facethe facts and get our , bearings.LESS THAN 12 , JJER GENT.

Suitable For Residences, Office and Hotel Buildings, 2School Houses, Etc. 2do so.The problem of the individual farmer las received' scant enough systemetic attention, and the problemof rural life as a whole, has, untilrecently, been practically ignored.The story that comes from everysection is substantially the same; itis a story of increasing tenancy andabsentee ownership; of soils depleted; of inadequate business methods;of chaotic marketing and distribution; of inferior roads; of lack ofsupervision of public health and sanitation; of isolated .and ill organizedsocial activities, and of inferior ntellectual provision.THE COUNTRY CHILD VERSUS' CITY CHILD.v Consider the position off a child inany of the more remote sections ofthe rural districts in America to-day,and ask yourself what his opportunities are for training and development and efficiency as compared withthose of a similarly endowed boy inan urban community. The latterlives in a house supplied with running water, the purity of wjiich isprotected by ample means; walk onsidewalks free from dust and mud;drives along adequate roads; has access to many things that ministers tothe legitimate pleasures of living;has at "hand the best training physicians and surgeons; publicly maintained hospitals; well planned schoolsof every grade from the kindergarten to the professional school of college. And most of these things hesecures at a minimum expensethrough a relatively low rate of taxation. The other picture is esasilydrawn. If we may confine ourthdught for a moment to the schoolsalone, we find that outside of NewEngland, which has solved the ruralschool problem' largely by eliminating the rural population, all that thevaverage country boy has access to isan 'ungraded school, usually taught inone room by a girl with less trainingthan a high s'chool graduate, receiving $40 or $50 a month for seven oreight months in the year, teaching allages in thirty or more classes a day.If by any chance a boy survives thisand desires to go further it is necessary for his father to put him on atrain, buy his transportation, sendhim tpa town, pay his board, histuition, and lose his services duringthe session, and probably lose himpermanently from the country. Ihave said it before and I am notafraid to repeat it that I do notquite see how a father and motherwho are ambitious for their childrencan gain their own consent to continue tp live in remote rural districtsunder existing conditions.THE PEOPLE THE GREATEST UNDEVELOPED RESOURCE.The greatest undeveloped resource'of any community, as our great Ambassador to Great Britain has soemphatically said, is vthe people.And if we devote more enlightenedattention to the conservation and dedevelopment of the people we shall berelieved -of much of the concernabout the conservation and development of our natural resources.SOME COLLEGES NOT DOINGTHEIR DUTY.Now this problem of the development of agriculture and of rural lifeis one which requires the most serious thought of the best agencies inthe nation. It is on,e primarily forthe farmers themselves, and I clearly recognize that they have done mostand will continue to do most to solveit. But they need, deserve, and demand assistance and will have it. Thenation has created certain responsible instruments for their assistance.Among these ' are the State departments sof agriculture, and the Statecolleges of agriculture. That all ofthem have done good work no onecan question; that some of them havesuperb work many will gladly recognize; that some of them have notlived up to their opportunities admitsof no manner of doubt. vThose colleges that are not doingtheir duty to their States are notwholly to blame, but in my judgment they are largely to blame. Thetrouble in too many of our4 Stateshas arisen from a dispersion of agencies undertaking to aid in the advancement of agriculture and to con-Stomach. Weak? . WfefcflfBlood Bad"?

Manyfish that live in the deep seas possessthis same power of becoming luminous. Scientific men have vainlytried to explain the mechanism of thisluminosity. Prof, Aranand Gautier,of Paris, France, has just communicated to the Academy of Science a notice of MM. Ville and Denien, of Moritpellier, who explain this production oflight by the oxidation of a substancesecreted by luminous animals, calledlophine. This organixj azoted substance, under the influence of oxygenemits a visible luminosity.' Potash, inin the presence of catalytic elements,such as the ferruginous matters of theblood, likewise provokes the oxidationof the lophine, and consequently formlight. Oxygenated water has also, thesame property. In the organisms itis unstable oxygen of the tissues catalyzed by the ferruginium elements ofthe blood that produces the oxidationof the-lophine and renders animalsluminous.NEARLY EVERY CHILDHAS WORMSPaleness, at times a flushed face,unnatural hunger, picking the nose,great thirst, etc., are indications ofworms.

I could point toState after State department of agriculture is jealous of the State collegeof agriculture and is busier watchingthe advances of -the State college thanit is with its job helping the people.I could point to State after State'where the State college of agricultureand the State university, created bythe same people and maintained forthe service of the same people, arebusier preventing extensions of oneanother's activities than they arewith extensions of their own activities for the service of the,, people.Neither is content lto find out the jobit can do best and to do it. It istrying to prevent the other from doing a job that it might do.Whereto much is to be done, wastethat comes from antagonism and duplication is criminal. The averageState college of agriculture can render its community, through the successful operation of short courses, andabove all, through aggressive and active service to the adult farming population. It is the greatest urgencythat all the agricultural agencies ofthe nation shall put their .heads together and co-ordinate their activities. "Unquestionably in .the pastthere has been much useless duplication of effort, no little waste of moneyand energy, and no inconsiderableamount of hostility and friction.One of the most gratifying developments of recent years has been theclear, recognition of the evils growingout of lack of systematic planningand co-ordination of effort and theState colleges of agriculture, the Federai department, and Congress, are determined to eliminate them.Secretary Houton then reviewed"briefly the many and varied activities of the Department, which he said-would astound those who consider itan agency for the distribution of garden seeds.Mr. Houston continued:HECOMMENDS DISCONTINUANCEOF PRESENT SEED .DISTRIBUTION. Yoji may T)e interested to know thatin the estimate just submitted to Congress it has been recommended thattlie distribution of ordinary vegetableand flower seeds be discontinued andthat part of the $300,000 heretoforedevoted to this purpose be used toprocure, propagate and distributeamong the people, new and valuableseeds and plants. If Congress sees fitin its wisdom to .accept the recommendation, particular attention will be given to the securing and distribution ofnew and valuable seeds andplants, in-eluding forage crop seeds, whosecharacter and quality will be thor' oughly known and tested; and pains"will be taken in every instance to see-that sufficient supply is sent to makeit worth while for the individual farmer to make an experiment.DEMONSTRATION WORKEXTENDED.TO BEHeretofore the work of the TDepartment has lain chiefly in thetfield ofproduction, and even in this field itlias been conscious of limitations. Thechief difficulty has been to make itsresults known effectively to the greatmass of farmers who most needed theknowledge. There can be little doubtthat the Federal department of agriculture and the various State collegesand the best farmers have enough"knowledge to revolutionize the nationif it could be conveyed to all farmersand they could be induced to utilize it.Suppose what is known about hog-cholera, tick eradication, the boll weeTil, and other things could be made intimately known to every farmer andlie could be induced to apply the remdy? Wht hideous waste could beavoided!How to get this information to thelast man on the farm has been one of"the most troublesome problems confronting the Department. After manyyears an effective method has at last"been devised. The demonstration7)lan has made its demonstration. Theold lesson that personal contact is ofthe highest value has been taught.A' DECENTRALIZING BLAN.It is perfectly apparent that an extension of this demonstration work-will be made and a bill is now pend-irig Iri" Congress, known as thejSmith-Lever Agricultural Co-operative Extension Bill, which embodiesthe main principles approved By experience. It will insure the closestco-operation of the Federal Department and the State colleges; it willmake both of them think and plan; it-will stop haphazard enterprises; itwill give each all the facts about theactivities of the other; it will guarantee that nothing shall be undertaken until it has been carefully thought"out in advance. It will prevent 'duplication' of effort and will removefriction. It will insure the expenditure of the Federal funds for the purpose for which they were intended;It will provide an automatic checkagainst the looting of the Federal"treasury by requiring an equal aporpriation from the State treasuryand by fixing an ultimate limit to4he Federal contribution; and -finally, 1it "will prevent the building up in"Washington of a great centralizedTiureau, intimately reaching into-every farm in the nation."THE RURAL CREDIT PROBLEM.We shall leave nothing undone to, stimulate production directly 'and toconvey information to the farmer,"fcut we have suddenly been broughtlice to face with the fact that inmany directions further' increasedproduction waits on better distribution. -There Is" a general impression thatfarmers need better credit arrange--ments. The aligiitest renecion- winconvince one that all farmers do notqually need ,it; that all sections arenot 'Similarly 'Cir.eumMancad. From-ovoktal at lawr ratW, but for iaf or-tte jftdouoa. cones te ury, awt iutmation .s to how to invest capital.That many communities N need longtime loans under permanent improvements and that pther communitiesneed an improvement in conditionsunder which the small farmer maysecure relatively small sums for operating expenses at a low rate, cancan not be denied. The question isone of ways and means. And justwhat is needed and just what shouldbe done, no one, so far as I havebeen able to discover, is at presentsufficiently informed or wise venoughto assert. For a generation economists have known the facts aboutEuropean conditions, bjit few have investigated the conditions at home".The Department of Agriculture is nowdefinitely and rapidly making thehome survey and should" in a shorttime have information of great valueto the farmer and to the legislature.FARMER' CLASSDOESCREDITNOT DEMANDLEGISLATIONOne .thing is clear, the schemesl hat are multiplying -which conceivethe farmer, to be a mendicant and asubject for unique and special legislation may be at once condemned.The American farmer 'does not needor desire to be classed with thoseforeign people who are just emerging from a condition of serfdom andtutelage. He asks no opportunitythat is not afforded to every American citizen; he asks for no legislation which shall give him credit oneasier terms than his orother mechanic or his professional friend orhis merchant may secure it. But hedoes ask to be assisted in creatingconditions and machinery which shallenable him on a similar credit foundation to secure money at the samerates as any other class in the community. This, and this alone, itseems to me is all that he asks andis nothing less than he deserves. Iam not impressed wiht the wisdomand the justice of proposals thatwould take the money of all the people through bonds or other devicesand lend it to the farmers or to anyother class at a rate of interest lower than the economic conditionswould normally require and at a rateof interest lower than that at whichother classes are securing their capital. This would be special legislation of a particularly odious type, andno new excursions in this directionwould be palatable when we are engaged in the gigantic task of restoring the simple rule of equity:In the field of marketing:, there isalso danger that pressure will bebrought to bear upon us to act everywhere before we are prepared to actintelligently anywhere. -Not that assistance cannot be given here andthere and not that the Department isnot furnishing and will not furnish information of great practical value toindividuals and communities. The; Department has arranged its marketinginvestigations under five importantsuD-aivisions:First Marketing Surveys, methodsand costs, including especially available market supplies in given production areas, demand at consuming centers cold and other storages, marketing systems and prices, and costs ofwholesale and retaildistributionfarm productsSecond Transportation and "Storage problems having in mind the eliminatnon of waste and study of problems connected with surplus marketsupplies, terminal and transfer facilities, including freight consignment,car supply, deterioration in transit, extension of the practice of precoolingof perishable and other special services. Third City marketing and distribution investigations, involving a studyof the uses and limitations of farmers,municipal, wholesale and retail market houses, systems of City distribution, the promotion of direct dealingbetween producers and consumers byparcel post, express and freight.Fourth Study and promulgationof market grades and standards; consideration of sizes and suitability qfpackages. and containers, methods ofpreparation of perishable products andthe ultimate establishment, so far aspracticable, of official market gradesand standards for the farm products.Finally Co-operative productionand marketing investigations. TheDepartment has done much work inthis field through various agencies.It has established standard cottongrades and, has practically completedits standard in corn grades. It hasgiven much attention to the cola"storage problems, to the packing andhandling of perishable fruits. It isconvinced, as you are of the existing chaos and of the consequentwaste waste resulting from faults onthe part of the farmer in the grow'-ing and handling of his nrndnp.tswaste resulting from the machineryof distribution, including physicalequipment and physical handling;waste resulting from' the ' manipulation of those middlemen who perform no clearful, useful arid neccessary service, and waste resultingfrom ignorance on the part of the consumer and of the producer of thecharacter of the product which isplaced on the market. The producerof any product is entitled to receive"an exact nrice for 'the SDecific nro-duct which he offers, and the consumer is entitled to receive just thecommodity he thinks he is payingfor.A failure in either direction involves injustice and greatly, hampersproduction and' crop improvement. Letme illustrate by reference to two vitally important crops cotton andcorn.THE COTTON AND CORN STANDARD PROBLEMS.Several different standards of cotton classification are noV in use.FOURTH GALLEY'Some markets have adopted them, butdo not trade on them. Liverpol hasone set -of grades; New York another.The former is a great market for bothspots and futures; the latter almostpurely a future market. Atlanta hasits own grades; Augusta's are differ-ent. .Savannah, handling largely thesame character of cotton ,as the twoforegoing, trades on Liverpool grades,using Liverpool middling as a basis.Atlanta middling is equal to Liverpoolgood middling. I other words at thepeenu uute uis .urc $iaut;iujiiim'is3 applied to two' qualities -that differmarket value jas much' as $2.50 perbale. vThe adoption and application of oneuniform standard would result in agreat simplification of all cotton transactions, doing away1 with the complexmethod of figuring buyer's limits. It'would not be sufficient to have uni-foran grades, but the grade selected asthe basis grade should be the same inall markets.The local buyer knows the marketcotton grades, the farmer does notToo frequently the local buyer securesthe cotton at practically a bat ratebasis on lower grades, grades the cotton himself andvsells it for" what it isworth. The middleman alone profitsform this transaction, the producer isdefrauded as well as the consumer.There is not only incentive for placing a good product on the market, butas a matter of fact, a penalty attachesto the cotton grower who takes thepains to improve his product..Uniform standards throughout thecotton belt would result in the rapidbuilding up of a body of commonknowledge on the part of the farmers,students in agricultural colleges andothers interested in the universal eetof grades.Practically the game results wouldfollow and the same evils would beremoved if standard grades for cornwere universally adopted. Definitestandards for, the grading of commercial corn and the uniform applicationof such standards In all markets under suitable Government supervisionwould be of direct value' to our corngrowers, in that such standardizationwould encourage the marketing of drycorn of "better quality. Heretofore ithas been the common practice to paypractically th'e same price for all corndelivered at country stations regardless of its water content or of itssoundness. Farmers have not beenslow to grasp the situation, and undersuch a system have naturally madebut little effort to market corn in agood dry and sound condition. Thesystem has placed a premium onpoor and careless farming at the expense of farm, methods and practices.Under a definite system of gradingand the elimination of such termsas "reasonably dry" and "reasonablyclean" the farmer as well as thegrain dealer, will be able to knowand fully understand the requirements of the different grades. Witha knowledge of the grade requirements the farmer who markets drycorn of good quality will be in a position to demand a premium for suchcorn.. It will not" be necessary forhim to accept a $4 price for, cornwhich he sells under a grade designation of $3. He will thenlhavesome encouragement to exercisegreater care -in the harvesting,storing and marketing of his corn; hecan likewise ascertain in advance ofsale with a fair degree of accuracythe grade of his com while in the criband thus not market it until it issufficiently dry to meet the requirements of a higher grade.'NEED FOR COMPARATIVE ACTION. Several things stanri rmf vwv.ninn,-ly at this stage of our knowlege. Alltino waste must be eliminated. Insimple justice, the roducer must bepaid specifically fo what he produces and for nothing else, and the consumer must receive wlmr ho fiifni,.he purchases and must be willing to,v.j ci luu: price ror a good productIt is absolutely clear that before theproblems of rural credit and of marketing, the individual' farmer, actingalone, is helpless. Nothing lessthan concerted action will sufficeCo-operation is absolutely essential.The same business sense and thesame organizing genius which haveplaced this nation in the front rankin industry must be invoked for agriculture. I am not advocating an organization which shall attempt to establish a closed market and to fix prices. I am advocating simply an economic arrangement which will facilitate production and enable the producer to find the readiest and bestmarket for his product and the consumer to receive his supplies at thelowest cost. Nor am I thinking ofHuunuuinrateu enort wfiich shall proceed from above downward. Itmust associate itself with sqme particular product vhich-is more or lesscapable of being standardized and theobject must be to overcome somespecific difficulty. It goes withoutsaying that the members of the cooperative society must be those whoare bona fide producers and that every approach of the exploiter mustbe aggressively repelled. The objectmust De specincaiiy economic and Jnot remotely political.Here again the -need is for information. Types of organizationswhich operate successfully abroadcan not necessarily be imported intothis country without modification. Aform helpful for one undertaking isnot necessarily the best for another,and one successful in one communityunder certain conditions can .not necessarily be expected to succeed- under other conditions in another community. 4 There are many facts to beascertained. We are aggressivelyconducting a survey; we desire to,know and to estimate the varioussorts of enterprises afoot, to be ableto tell the people on what principles they may organize and for whatpurposes.RURAL ORGANIZATION.This brings us sharply up againstthe -whole problem of the organization of rural life. That rural lifeshould be organized and can be organized is clear; various agenciesare, definitely attacking its intellectual side. We are effectively studyingrural physical improvements, especially good roads. The country isaroused concerning it It realizesthat good country roads are prerequisite for many important rural undertakings. They are prerequisite forbetter marketing, 'for better schoolsand for comfortable living and. forthe promotion of social life.There is. obivious need of organization or. sanitary purposes and forsocial development. "Whether allthese fhall come through definite attack 6rv private or public agencies,'or as by-products, makes mnx differinlencer ,,thfey anust come. ,We can. nolonger entertain the notion that m-cial necessity-. It is more difficult tojoined and unorganized. Its organization is a national, economic and social necessity. It is more difficut toorganize a scattered rural poulationthan a concentrated one, but thegreat need is to give the rural population at least approximately the primary advantages which the townenjoys. The town is organized, andbecause of its organization and of itsconsequent advantages, it has tendedto attract to it the most ambitiousyouth of the country. The educatorof America has said: "The difficultyof a task constitutes no reason fordeclining it." And Nin this way liesthe largest promise for national upbuilding and .stability.PHILIPPINE FORESTS INVITE AMERICAN ENTERPRISESThe first big sale of Philippinetimber, offering opportunities for lumberman in the United States, hasjust been announced by the bureau ofinsular 'affairs of the' war department. While there are American firms operating in the Philippines, it is pointed out by the officals of the bureau.that the Philippine Islands offer toprospective lumbermen chances formost improved machinery methods.in the world The forest officers ofthe Philippines state that the Islandscontain 200 billion feet of merchantable timber for which there is alarge present demand and that practically all oi it is' owned by the government and is available under favorable terms. In almost all icases theforests can be easily logged by themost improved machinery are methods. The timtier, itself, it' is pointed out,includes structural material of greatvalue, in addition to many fine-hardwoodsparticularly suited to cabinetwork. In this latter class some ofthe most plentiful woods may be soldin competition with mahogany, suchis their beauty of grain and richnessof color. Manila is only two days'distance from Hongkong and China,which has largely exhausted its timber, furnishes a ready market. Japan,Australia, and even the UnitedStates, will take Philippine lumber,which is admitted free to this country. One of the commonest Philippine timbers, red laan, which worksand finishes well, has been sold on thePacific coast where it serves thesame purpose as the finest red-wood,which it somewhat resembles, ashigh as $80 per thousand board' feet.vGovernment timber in the Philippines is offered at a very low rate andit is stated that the labor problem .isrn no sense difficult. Investments byAmericans are not only invited, butare encouraged.The Philippine bureau of forestry,in this firs't sale which is being called to the attention of American timber operators, is offering a twentyyear concession which gives exclusive rights to a tract comprisingabout 95,000 acres, which containsnearly 2 billion board feet of timber.' It is required that the successful bidder shall keep up a certainminimum output which starts with 15million board feet during the first 2years and increase to an ultimate output of at least 21 million per year.A modern sawmill and logging equipment must be established and alsoa patrol system for the prevention offires and tresspass.A complete report on this body oftimber, which can be had at the officeof the director of forests m Manilaor at the Bureau of Insular Affairs inWashington, shows that the regionoccupied by the main body of thetract presents Ideal conditions. Thisreport shows that railroads can bebuilt easily and cheaply and that theentire timber belt can be logged ata minimum of expense and trouble.The amount of timber per acre variesfrom 12,000 up to 30,000 board feetand more. In the four principal typesof forest embraced in the area, muchvaluable material can be securedfrom even the least desirable type,and the most valuable types will, according to figures of the bureau, provide a handsome profit for an outlaycomparatively small in relation to thevalue of the timber which is to "beexploited.The principal kinds of wood arethe lauans, excellent constructiontimbers and somewhat comparable, inmechanical properties, to the Pacificcoast red-woods; yacal, one of themost valuable because of its greatstrength, and its resistance to destruction by white ants; apitong,quite comparable to the hard pines 6fthe United States, and various otherhardwoods which have already founda place as substitutes for mahogany.It is required that the successfulapplicant shall furnish a capital sufficient for the immediate prosecutionof the work, the amount in this casebeing placed at not less than 100,000pesos, Philipine currency, equivalentto $50,000.It is proposed that all bids for thistimber shall be opened in Manila onDecember 10. For the benefit of prospective purchasers in America, however, unable to prepare their 'applications and have them received inManila on or before that date, thebureau of insular affairs in Washingtbn will onv notification before thefinal day send a cablegram and havethe time extended until the actualbids cap be received in Manila.Two shipments of shad fry, the firstplanted in June, 1871, and totaling619,000, were brought to the coast' andplanted in the Sacramento River.Twenty years later the supply was inexcess of the demand and the presence of the fislL was reported fromSoutheastern Alaska to the boundaries of Mexico. While shad havefteen fished on this coast for the pastwo decades no impression has beenmade upon the supply, whereas on theAtlantic coast artificial propagationhas been necessary.HUMOR AND PATHOS.'
