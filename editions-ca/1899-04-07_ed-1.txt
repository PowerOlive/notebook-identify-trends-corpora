Master Ardick just reachedhis majority and thrown upon his own resources after stating his case to oneHouthwick a shipmaster is shipped as secondmate on the Industry bound for HavanaMr Tym the supercargo descries a sailCHAPTER IIOP THE BRUSH WITH THE BUACKSHIPI plunged off to the forecastle seizing a handspike as I went Thundering on the hath and then opening itI roared downAll hands ahoy Look alive Inan instant there was a bouncing outof bunks and hammocks and a rush upthe hatch The fellows popped outin quick succession and in a flash theentire crew was ranged on deckTo the braces shouted the captain through the trumpet All readyto slack and haul Some of you forward to tend spritsailThese orders taken up by the mateas the yelling of the wind drowned inpart even the bellowing of the trumpet were rapidly obeyed and the crewscrambled to their stations and stoodreadyDown helm was shouted back tothe two fellows at the tiller The shipshead began to fall off and as it did sothe orders to handle the braces followed In a mere matter of momentsGfSstr did tie men work urged onindeed by ike knowledge that therewas sora unusual stress though asyet the understood imperfectly thecause fin that few moments the last4order was carried out and the shipshead now pointed due north I hadkept an vye on the strangers movements while we were fetching the Industry upon the new course and wasnot greatly surprised on casting myeye that way to see the broad bowssuddenly fall away from the wind andthe lomif black side begin to show Atthe same moment her yards flew roundand thus she too was pointed northThere could be but one explanationof this last action the stranger meantto overhaul us I was now burning toget speech with the captain or Sellinger that I might resolve somethingmore certain out of this stirring business but for the present they werebusied with other matters so that Idid not like to seek them The readiestanswer 1 o be come at was that she wasDutch and was making a flying cruiseof it in the channel If so she shouldbe both faster and stronger than shelooked for it would be a bold thingindeed for a mere wagon of a merchant rigger without broadside gxinsand having no near friendly port forrefuge thus to seek prizes in our narrow seas While I was turning thesematters ovejr in my mind taking careto keep an eye out aft the while to bein readiness for sudden orders thecompanion opened and the supercargoagain appeared The mate was standing near by and Mr Tym at once wentover to him and by his expression andsome words which the wind took tome desired to know what had happened This was the very thing Iwould have for now without pushingmyself into their counsels I could slipa little nearer and be made acquainted with he whole matterAy p Dutchman fast enough thesupercargo was saying A daring fellow too and not to be lightly shakenoff I fancy Will it do to set a lit moreruiIt would not be profitable themate answered She is doing whatshe can with this strength of wind Bythe breaking of the clouds yonder itwill presently quiet a bit and then wewill see what can be done You observe that we hold our own with thefellow at present and carry as muchas he deesYes said the supercargo I perceive thatWe will make a race with him forthe coast pursued the mate and itwill go hard with us if we do not givelam a shrewd brushHow far might it be Surely twentymilesCall it a bit more Say five-and-twentyHe could make that byTrue said Mr Tym with a satisfied nod and if he should overhaulns on this course we could try a bowlineVVTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY FRIDAY APRIL 7 1899ne strode off to where the glasshung the captain had brought up another which he was using from thepoop and when he fetched it to therail he climbed upon a coil of line andbrought it to bearThe supercargo used the glass forsome time but finally put it by andwent up to have a talk with the captain Of course I could not hear whatthey said but it was easy to guess thatit must be about the present strait Ina few moments the captain came tothe verge of the poop and called themate Master Sellinger hurried up theladder and the three men talked together earnestly The mate then camedown ajrain and immediate the captain walked to the color halyards andwith his own hands ran up the flag Asit blew out at the rnizzen truck thecrew who as well as n self werewatching anxiouslv and curiouslv thedoings aft broke into a cheer All eyeswere now on the stranger for this wasa clear demand that he should declarehis intentions It was the most stirring moment thus far since the chaseI or race if you please had begun Thelong black mass rose on the next crestand slid foaming down the valley andagain soared and fell How we watchedher Lift lift she rose uptilted hergreat house of a stern and plungedwith the shock of the parted seas downthe declivity and all swiftly and mightily rode to the top again and still nota handkerchiefs breadth of buntingFive and at last ten minutes and thesame monotonous upride and tilt andfall The captain stood with straddledlegs silently using his telescope andthe mate was in the mizzen shroudsscanning the foe under the pent houseof his hand The supercargo leanedover the poop rail holding on hat andwig and the rest of us lined the weather bulwark in the waist Of a suddenthe captain lowered his glass and shutit up The supercargo turned catchingthe action and they came together andexchanged a few wordsThe thing is fetched to a head saida sailor at my elbow with an excitedpull at his waistbandHe had scarce spoken when Houthwick left Mr Tym and stepped brisklyto the head of the poop ladderMaster Sellinger set the mainsailand reef it Take vst one reef in theforesailThe mate was off his perch to thedeck in an instant and at hfs word themen flew to their stations The windhad less weight now than formerly andblew steadier but for all that I apprehended that we were taking considerable hazard to thus swell our canvasYet very quickly the thing was doneand under the added pressure the shipdrove her nose into the smother andmade a strong lurching start of it onward While I was stepping back fromthe foot of the main shrouds and inthe act of directing one of the men tocoil up a loose length of halyard someone behind me gave a shout and Iturned to see that the dark ship waslikewise whitening with added sailOn we raced and it must have beenthat the greater part of an hour wentbv So far the Dutchman and we wererarely well matched he driving alongat the same point off our beam asthough he might be our shadow Buta change was at hand All in a moment as it seemed his long bulk began to narrow the small slant of hissails that we could see expanded andat once his pot round bows rode leaping and sinking into view He hadchanged his plan and would flystraight at usIn an instant the trumpet of CaptHonthwick began to bellowMan braces Down helm Slacklee braces Haul in on the weatherAft here some of you and let out areef in the lateenIt was clear what the skipper wouldbe at The cruiser perceiving that hecould not outsail us and cut us offmeant to close in and try to disable uswith his guns To prevent this we mustturn tail and make a straight awayrun of it The question then to be settled was whether he could get nearenough to wing us by cutting up ourspars and rigging I thought this allout at a blink as the Scotch say forjust at the moment I had to use my fingers rather than my brains When Icame in from the boltsprit havinggone there on some matter concerningthe drawing of the sail I found thatthe Dutchman was fair astern of usonly the slant of his sails catching thelight and the rest of him standingup round and black I think something like two hours now passed onlyone thing but that an important onehappening which was that the Dutchman slowly gained upon us At lastHouthwick said something to whichthe others appeared to assent and themate hurried off the poop He espiedme as 1 stood by the main shroudsand beckoned me to him When I cameup he said low and in a strained quicktoneThe captain thinks we had best trya gun I must serve it Do you standready to help work the ship Call thecarpenter and put him in charge ofthe magazine The main hatch willhave to be opened till they can get upthe first supply of ammunition afterwhich batten it down again The restcan come up the companion Tell Spyglow that he can fetch out the armschest and take the pikes from thebeekets and pile them up No harm tohave things at hand Stay You maylikewise gret out the medicine chestl and set it in the open space tweendecks That must serve as a cockpitif any are hurt Let the cook who issomething of a sawbones go thitherThe cabin boy can assist him Thatwill do for now and look aliveI said Aye aye in a seeminghearty voice though to own thetruth my heart was beginning to beatfast and I felt a bit weak in the kneesand hurried away In a few minutesall the orders were carried out and themate was free to try his experimentWhen I returned to the deck thegangport had been unhooked and 1hevguns canvas jacket taken As Iturned to see whether the mate wasready I mean ready to have the shipluffed so that he could secure his aimI heard a low dull boom and as Iwhirled again a ball of smoke blew outfrom the bows of our pursuer andwreathed off to leewardHes firing at the moon said themate contemptuously and now I sawthat the excitement had struck thecolor from the mans cheeks save fora little patch of red which showedunder the sea burn and that hisnerves were strung high and firmAt the gun called the captainfrom the poop Are jou ready Master SellingerAll ready sirThen to the braces men Luffhe roared back to the two fellows atthe helmThe ship came handsomely into thewind and as she dipped to the bottomof a hollow the mate gave a swiftglance along his gun and applied thelinstockHe had loaded while I was belowand I knew not what the charge wasbut it must have contained afor I saw a tremendous dimple all over the water just outside ofthe Dutchmans forefootA good beginning shouted thecaptain Have at him againWe got upon our course once moreand meantime the gun was reloadedHa hes showing his teeth at lastcried the mate pausing with his fusewhich he was blowing up in his handHe pointed oward the enemy andlo two ports in the bows had openedand in each was the round target spotwhich marked the muzzle of a gunHe has discovered that somethingbesides swivels will be needed saidMr Tym who had come without ourperceiving him among us Nay buthe is about to give us the complimentof his whole broadsideA tremendous crashing roar and asky full of smoke followed I think Istooped but I am not sure and thenext that comes clear before me isthat a great splinter from somewhereoverhead struck the deck near me andgave a queer sort of elastic spring andwent overboard I confess I jumpedback and as I did so I ground my heelupon something soft and had to makeanother spring to prevent falling Bythis time I had backed nearly to thequarter deck and the smoke havingnow almost blown away I leanedagainst the break of the deck andlooked around The spot where I hadstumbled first arrested my eye andWThe captain rounded down in a loose heapthere rolled up almost in a ball laythe body of old Dingsby His belt hadburst with the strain of his doublingover or perhaps was cut by the glancing fragment of shot and it was slipping off him almost giving him an airof unbuckling it from the front hisback being toward me The mateand the Frenchman were standing upstiff and bold near the gun and noone else had been hurt that I couldperceiveThe captains figure broke throughthe passing cloud of smoke comingfrom the helm or some part aft andpausing at the edge of the poopOn deck there how fares it heinquired peering down Then perceiving the body of the oldman he answered his own questionSo they have slain poor DingsbyCarry him a bit aside some of youand bestow him in a seemly sort Wewill do better anon What say youMaster Sellinger have you a sharpword backAye aye sir growled the mateLuff her and 1 will give her a ahwiwdanswer enoughLuff it is thenAgain we came into the wind aridagain the mate sighted and applied hfslinstock The smoke drifted asternand I eagerly jumped into the shroudsand stared through the first clearopening What was my delight whenI saw the great bulk of the Dutchmansawing wildly into the wind beatingup a yeast of foam and all a wreck forward where his fore topmast and foretopgallant mast hung in a dreadfulmess from the foremast headPresently th order came to handlethe ship and fill upon our oldcourseWe had got everything to drawingand I had climbed upon the weatherbulwarks my mind very content andcasting looks of exultation at thefloundering Dutchman when withvery startling suddenness a spit of firedarted along his cumbered foredeckand a terrible whistling ball rushedclose above my head I distinctly feltthe wind of it and was off my perchhalf tumbling indeed to the deck Inan instantAs I steadied myself on my legs Iheard a laugh above me and on lookingup saw Capt Houthwick standing atthe top of the poop ladder He shookhis shaggy head at me mightily amusedas it seemed at the way I rolled or thebulwark and as I looked up he saidsomethicg in a kind of chuckling voiceand turned away I had his tall broadfigure for an instant in my eye andthen came the boom of another gunfrom the Dutchman and before I coultfmove or scarce think the captain took Ja long sinking step backward whirledraced to the edge of the poop androunded down in a loese heap one armhanging over the vergeCHAPTER IIIOF THE COURSE OF EVENTS TILL WEWERE FINALLY SOUTH BOUNDSome one behind me shouted andthere was a rush of the men and criesand in the midst of it I saw the littlesupercargo dart from some place aftand raise the captains head I leapedto the poop ladder and flung myself upand then I turned to the poor captainwith whom it had fared indeed afterthe worst His lower face save for thechaps to which some beard hung hadbeen shot away and he was a deadman even before I had stopped to speakto the sailorThis is sorrowful business said thesnpercargo rising with a sigh and covering the shattered face with his pocket handkerchief He was a brave manand trueI summoned three seamen and withgreat tenderness we brought downCapt Houthwicks body which we laidfor the time on the quarter deck covering it with a tarpaulin When thesethings were attended to the mate dispatched us again forward and for alittle we gave our sole attention to thehandling and better speeding of theship The Dutchmans crippled foremast continued to fret him but hewould not give over and so for a longtime we both kept ourcourse though theIndustry all the while made a small butsteady gain It must have been halfan hour after this that Master Sellingercalled me and upon my responding saidthat he imist now retire to the cabinfor a little the further disposition ofthe voyage standing to be settled andthat meanwhile I was to command theship With that and upon my ascending to the quarter deck he made asign to Mr Tym and thej

conscienceI thought everybody had oneTheoretically everybody has butit is only used in judging other persons acts When a man is personallyinterested he puts his conscience tcone side Thats what makes work forthe lawyers Every term there arehundreds of cases tried in which oneparty knows he is entirely in thewrong but hopes to get the better ofhis opponent by some slip of thelawThe root of the trouble he wenton is that people have got theirmorals mixed Nine tenths of the people think that nothing is wrong unless the law says it is If they shouldhappen to land in a country wherestealing was

and afarce n our state but one of them hasthe nerve to sav so over his own sitrnature in the newspapers said Mr PR Graham a leading business man ofDurango Col to a Washington PostreporterAs 1 do not aspire to office there isno reason for timidity on my part andI unhesitatingly declare that the experiment of giving the ballot to womenin Colorado has been as rank a pieceof foolishness as any people ever inficted upon themselves it has dene avery little good perhaps and a greatdeal more of harm and though it maynever be repealed there is no possibility of good coming out of it The women claim that their presence has madethe elections cleaner but I contendthat they appropriate credit that doesnot belong to them for while theelections are better conducted thanformerly the improvement is ic tothe Australian system and not to thewomenThe presence of women in conventions and political meetings is to mymind degrading to them Surroundedby a lot of coarse men whom theywould not elevate or refine in a lifetime they are entirely out of their element Their vote in no way conducesto better government than if they werewithout the franchise for they vote onsentiment or follow ihe lead of theirhusbands and so the only result is toincrease the number of voters Thereare thousands of good women in thestate who are tired of the business andvery much regret that the ballot wasever conferred

Weevil Stoppedin a CertainSection of the CountryMany years ago I used to grow acresof white field peas for hogs That waswhat they were called then but sincewe have to get seed of the same fromCanada where weevils seem not tobother the name seems to have beenchanged to Canada peas I raked thepeas in bunches with a horserake whenripe the rake tearing them out by theroots W7hen dry I stacked them alongside the hog yard like hay and forkedthem into the yard as hogs neededOnly enough were stored in the barnto be threshed for seed and for youngpigs the next summer When warmweather came the next June the grainroom had not been opened for two orthree weeks when I went to get peasto soak for some pigs just before weaning and the sight I beheld was photographed on my mind indelibly Aportion of the substance of my peaswas running all over the floor and wallsand bins of wheat corn oats and barley The eggs of the pea weevil hadhatched in every pea consuming aboutone fourth of each grain and thenemerging in the form of dirty graybeetles and I suppose they were ontheir travels looking for sunlight andchance for further development Mypea growing for pigs ceased then asit did with all my neighbors and probably never to be renewed in this section of the country Oalen Wilson inPractical FarmerFACTS FOR FARMERSIt pays to prepare the ground wellfor the cropA low wheel wagon on the farm

that painters traceAbove below and everywhereA sense of living thrills the airSprings message through the silent sentWith earth and wood and sky is blentThe hedgerow blossoms stain the sodThe south winds make the grasses nodAnd woolly lambs in awkward playDown the green hillside ambling strayAlong the blue horizon rimThe lights and shadows sink or swimAnd penciled faintly on the skiesA ghostly

CompanionONE GLASS OF WINEA Belief That It Changed the Historyof Thia CountryIt is said that a single glass of wineprobably wrecked the Democratio partyin 1860 The story is worth tellingAfter the breaking up of the nationalDemocratio convention at Charlestonthe party in Georgia held a state convention Great excitement prevailedThe leaders of the party could notagree It was a critical periodThe majority report indorsed the seceders or bolters at Charleston whethe minority report opposed theirThe leading champion of the nwas Herschel V Johnson andhis followers were confident that hiseloquence and logic would carry thedayIt is quite likely that such wouldhave been the case but for an unfortunate mishap Ex Governor Johnson began his speech before the noon adjournment on the second day and concludedafter dinnerOld men who remember that speechsay that it was a powerful argumentand the impression gained ground thatafter the noon recess the speaker woulddemolish his opponents with a feweledge hammer blowsBut the overooufident friends of theminority report were doomed to disappointment Johnson felt the strain ofthe morning session so much that hewas unable to eat anything and he tooka glass of wine upon an empty stomachto strengthen himself This was a fatalmistake That one glass of wine perhaps changed the destiny of the nation IThe great orator resumed his speechbut the wine bad nauseated him Hewas hazy verbose and unintelligible attimes His style and argument lackedvigor consistency and positiveness Hisfriends looked at one another in despairThe men on the other side were exultant It was evident that the speakerbad damaged his own causeThen Howell Cobb and Henry RJackson followed each other for the majority report They spoke with an airof expectant triumph and captured theconventionThe majority report was adopted Itis unnecessary to follow the history ofthe next few weeks The national Democracy was completely disrupted andput two tickets in the field Lincolnwas elected and the country was plunged into a civil war Had Johnson succeeded in inducing the Georgia convention to adopt his conservative ideas itis safe to say that other southern stateswould have fallen into line with ourcommonwealth and the national Democratio party would have remainedmiiittdThis 4s the story of whpfca little gJaupf wine did It rnrimd a great par frycaused a
