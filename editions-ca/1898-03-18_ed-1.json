the glands of my neck and all efforts
of physicians in Washington D C

HOW TO FIND OUT -
Fill a bottle or common glass with urine
and let it stand twenty four hour a sedi
ment or settling indicates an unhealthy con
dition of the Kidueys When urine stains
linen it is evidence of kidney trouble Too
frequent desire to urinate or pain iu the
back is also convincing proof that the kid
ueys and bladder are out of order
WHAT TO DO
There is comfort in the knowledge so often
expressed that Dr Kilmers Swamp Root
the great kid- ey remedy fulfills every wish
in relieving pain iu the back kidueys liver
bladder and every part of the urinary pas
sages It corrects inability to hold urine and
scalding pain in passing or bad effects fol
lowing use of liquor wine or beer and over
comes that unpleasant necessity of being
compelled to get up many times during the
night to urinate The mild and the extraor
dinary effect of wamp Root is soon realized
It stands the highest for its wonderful cures
of the most distressing ca es If you nped
a medicine you should have the best Sold
by druggists price fifty cents and one dollar
You may have a sample bottle and pamphlet
both sent free by mail upon receipt of three
