At the close of the vork to the sur
prise of all present, Mr. Cray asked

where oysters were served. This
coupled with the smoker that followed

Miss Alma Duke Jones, a student
at the Cincinnati Consrvatory of Mu
sic, will give a piano recital in the au
ditorium of the Millersburg Female
College, Saturday evening, April 18,
at 8 o'clock. Miss Jones will be as
sisted by Miss Esther Thiele, vocalist.
After graduating from the musical de
partment of the M. F. C. one year ago
Miss Jones entered the Conservatory
and has made rapid progress. She is
very entertaining and accomplished.
The recital will be given under the
auspices of the McDowell Musical
Club. It is urged that seat reserva
tions' be made early.
For some time Dr. C. C. Fisher
has been talking of building an annex
to the M. F. C. Those who were in
clined to be skeptical did not think
that he meant anything, and that if he
did it would be in the far dim dis
tance. However, it is now an as
sured fact. The building is. to be
erected, a handsome four story press
ed brick front with stone trimmings,
one hundred feet in length by seventy
in width, removed thirty feet from the
main building. The two are to be
connected, enclosed in glass, and will
furnish another beautiful conservato
ry for flowers. The greater portion of
the lower floor oc the building will be
occupied as the gymnasium, with a
swimming pool in the rear, and it will
run to the height of two storeis. The
third floor will be taken up with so
ciety halls, art halls, and music rooms,
and the fourth made up of dormito
ries. When the new building is com
pleted and equipped the Millersburg
Female College will have no superiors
and but few equals in Kentucky. Dr.
Fisher has not stopped with this.
Two months ago he had a landscape
gardner to visit the grounds and make
blue prints for flower beds and shrub
bery. On Tuesday and Wednesday of
the present week these beds and the
shrubbery were put out by experts.
All of these new improvements will
tax Dr. Fisher very heavily, but as
the reputation of the M. F. C. is now
so universally wide spread it is abso
lutely necessary that it be done.
TO KENTUCKY BUSINESS MEN.
Business interests in Kentucky must
rely on themselves. Their principal
city newspapers are Abusing both the
Glenn-Greene law and the fire insur
ance companies alike. Some of their
Congressmen are advertising their in
competency by talking of Congression
al intervention. Under Supreme
Court decisions Congress is further off
from fire insurance in Kentucky than
I China. The last group of companies
j trying to operate in the State was
I forced out by Chrman Laffoon's
foolish order Tuesday. All words,
words, words no insurance. The pa
pers out in the State seem to under
stand the situation netter, but busi
ness men must rely upon themselves.
They know that insurance or any
other companies doing business would
not quif the State if they saw a fair
chance of operating at a reasonable
profit. Some managers might be fool-
! ish, but not all. When they see noth
I ing but hardship and no chance for
j profit all businesses stop. That is
' the situation with respect to fire in
i surance in Kentucky. The new law
! seems ideal for politicians and people
i who have no property at stake. If
, ideal for business, then companies
would be falling over each other to get
in; as it is they are falling over each
other to get out. Chairman Laffoon
threatens State insurance! Newspa
pers threatenFederal intervention!
Words, words, words, but not a dol
lar's worth of insurance. Let busi
ness men insist upon Mr. Laffoon
coming down from clouds of eloquence
and getting down to the brass tacks of
business. It's time for business sense
not for grotesque political anti-corporation
advertising! Today the insur
ance companies are getting the hot
'end; tomorrow it may be your corpo-
lation. The Insurance Field.

URGE .ESTABLISHMENT OF
SANITARIUM IN NICHOLAS
A special dispatch from Carlisle
says:
"Ladies representing the Nicholas
County Health League appeared be
fore the Nicholas Fiscal Court and
asked that Nicholas county be de
clared a tuberculosis district. This
is the first step taken to establish a
sanitorium in Nicholas county. It is
the plan of the women who are work
ing to secure a tuberculosis sanitori
um to have Nicholas county declared
a tuberculosis district in order that a
vote may be taken to raise money for
the buiWing and equipping of a hos
pital. One of the plans on foot is to
have 'Nicholas, Robertson, Fleming,
Mason and Bourbon or Harrison
counties co-operate in establishing a
hospital at Parks' Hill."

No wonder this man is discouraged! He thought he
could make a fortune quickly. He believed some oily tongued
rascal; he sent his money away; he LOST IT.
Would it not have been better for him had he kept his
money SAFE in our bank and let it PILE UP until he had
enough to buy something right here at home he could watch
himself? He would have helped the community and in
creased the value of HIS property.
