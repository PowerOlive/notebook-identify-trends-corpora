WHEN OLD AGE COMES
IT DEPENDS NOT UPON YEARS BUT
UPON VITAL FORCE
ically and mentally than others are at
tho same age It is self evident that old
age does not begin at rny set time so
far as the divisions of time divide the
periods of life but that it has to do
with that subtle agent known as the
the balance the vitality on the one side
with the pathology on the other
The indication of old age may be no
ticed by ocular inspection The figure
stoops the walk is less elastic the
rounded figure gives place to the spare
habit of body the wrinkle of time
mounts the cheek while the frost of
many winters mantles the brow The
typical healthy person who attains old
age is spare of body and old age em
phasizes this fact by causing a paucity
of adipose tissue So the wrinkle of
time after all is kindly in nature
Physiologically we notice that a
diminution of the physical energy is ac
companied by a corresponding diminu
tion of the power to eliminate waste
material from the body Elasticity and
strength give place to hardness and
brittleness of nearly all the tissues of
the body The general health may be
good because there is a harmonious
balance between the action of the nerv
ous system and the circulatory system
However the former is less responsive
to external stimulation and the latter
is less vigorous in old age The vital
processes conducted by the circulation
respiration and metabolic changes in
the tissues are less active There are
diminished adaptability of the whole
system to changes in the environment
and less ability to meet the require
ments of emergencies such as sudden
demands of muscular and mental strain
The senile conditions and diseases are
numerous and obvious in the first
place weakened digestion and assimila
tion The weakened vigor of the circula
tion and glandular system necessarily
weakens the power of eliminating
the excrementitious substances which
gives rise to pernicious nutrition and
that in turn is the cause of the tendency
to develop malignant or benign growths
in different parts of the body in old age
The strong tendency to overeat and
underdrink together with the natural
decline of functional power gives rise
to a condition of lithemia which is the
prime cause of the majority of deaths
in old age In the healthy state that
great glandular furnace and chemical
laboratory the liver is capable of trans
forming an excess of nitrogenous matter
which may result from metabolism of
tissue or exist in the food consumed
into the highly soluble excrement itious
substance known as urea This excre
ment is eliminated from the blood
mainly by the kidneys and to a much
less extent by the skin
Now in old age with the functional
power and natural vitality on the wane
together with the strong tendency to
overtap this function of the liver we
find this waste is not converted into
urea but into uric or lithic acid a- com
paratively insoluble excrementitious and
toxic- substance which if it appears in
the blood in sufficient quantity and is
long enough continued in circulation
through- the urinary tubules sets up ir
ritation and inflammation which inev
itably impair the function of the renal
epithelium and we find this poisonous
substance is not eliminated from the
system but accumulates in the blood
This explains why old people are
almost universally troubled with disease
of the liver kidneys bladder and pros
tate gland The unstable circulation
atheromatous changes and brittleness
of the walls of the blood vessels with
the tendency to overtax the digestive
apparatus are the cause of many old peo
ple going to that bourn from which
no traveler returns by the apoplectic
route
Hereditary diseases naturally mani
fest themselves when the vitality is be
low a certain level so we are not sur
prised to find certain dyscrasic and
latent tendencies manifesting them
selves at this period of life wThen the
natural vitality is waning The diseases
most frequently found to fcethe cause
of dissolution among the aged are pneu
monia diseases of the liver and urinary
organs consumption cancer apoplexy
and cancren
j The enemy to longevity the author
continues is- self indulgence People
who have reached an advanced age may
j prolong their lives and greatly add to
the comfort of their declining years by
diminishing the quantity of food

mentitious matter in the blood Jour
nal of American Medical Association
Well Fed Fighters
Says tlis London Chronicle Ad
miral Deweys interruption of te bat
tle of Manila bay to give his craws the
opportunity of breaking their fast re
calls our own glorious 1st of June
when Earl Howe before he gave the
French such a hammering off Ushant
hove to for an hour before attacking to
permit of his men fortifying themselves
for the coming fight with a good meal
a pause which caused much conjecture
in the mindsof the astonished French
It has ever been the Anglo Saxon way
to fight if possible on a full stomach
Wellington once said that if ever he
wanted an Irish or a Scotch regiment
to reach a particular point by a certain
hour all he had to do was to promise
the former a drink on getting to its des
tination the latter its pay but that the
corresponding bait to an- English bat
talion was a good dinner of roast beef
CJ2i
tume of a Pierrot In a thicket a car
riage waits to drive off with the suc
cessful opponent
There is every reason to believe from
recently disclosed information by M
Alfred Darimon that in portraying on
vital force an acquaintance with which t canvas that impressive episode the
enables the analytical mind to become artist was not influenced by solely
proficient in prognosis by weighing in aginative caprice but that he has repro
duced a scene in real lite
The facts are as follows The duelists
were M Jules Brame a former minis
ter of public instruction under the sec
ond empire and M D D a well
known journalist on the staff of one of
the most influential newspapers in the
north of France When the duel occur
red both were studying for the bar
One Shrove Tuesday they in company
with friends had repaired to a restau
rant on the Boulevard with a view of
enjoying a good dinner and afterward
of going to the masquerade ball at the
Opera They all agreed to go as Pier
rots As they all wore masks some one
suggested that they should adopt some
distinctive sign by which they could
recognize one another in the crowd D
D suggested that they should pin a la
bel bearing a number to their backs
The idea was unanimously adopted and
D D prepared the labels accordingly
While so doing a diabolical idea came
into his head It was carnival time
Why should he not have his little joke
When it was Jules Brames turn to
have a ticket pinned to his back his
friend D D had written in large letters
beneath the number I am Jules
Brame One can easily imagine what
was the result No sooner had Brame
set foot in the main passage to the pre
miere galerie than he was followed by a
lady wearing a mask who on his pre
paring to enter a private box cried put
I wish you success Jules Brame
Later on on re entering the passage he
was surrounded by a group of masquer
aders who with one voice shouted out
Good day my dear Brame That
proved to him that he was known to
every one although he was puzzled to
understand how it could be
Passing in front of a box opener the
girl burst out laughing He inquired
angrily what she was laughing at
Why she replied I am laughing
at the funny idea which led you to pin
a label on your back with your name
on it And suiting the action to the
word she unpinned the label and hand
ed it to him
Jules Brame considered the joke not
only in bad taste but insulting He
sought out his comrade and finding
him in the saloon he reproached him
angrily in the hearing of the crowd in
sisting that he should apologize openly
then and there D D resenting his
friends attitude toward him declined
to apologize A duel therefore in ac
cordance with French habits and cus
toms was inevitable Seconds were at
once- chosen Short swords were pro
cured and in their Pierrot costumes the
antagonists started for the Bois de
Boulogne Fortunately the duel did not
end fatally as seems to be the case in
Geromes picture for although Brame
ran his- sword right through D Ds
body no vital organ was touched He
recovered very quickly and the two an
tagonists became fast friends again

well they may respect it for it is really

of all this is thecity tax on every chick

this is why the streets are so clean It
is why the asphalt is as smooth as a
