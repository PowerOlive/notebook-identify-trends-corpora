C F Clay is a horse of great finish and style in fact as much so as any horse
we know of Is a beautiful mahogany bay wjth black points and stands 153
hands high Bis pedigree is full of the richest producing blood which has vear after
year added new and brilliant performers to the turf for instance Nannie Etti
coat out of his dam has given in 1896 Red Silk 210 and Brown Silk 219 the lat
ter the dam of China Silk two-year-old record 216 beyond question the best
two-year-old filly of 1896 As a two three and five-year-old C F Clay was cam
paigned and landed many good races securing his record of 218 His first crop
of foals came in his six-year-old form and for several years afterward he was the
leading sire when age of foals was considered His get all possess his grand in
dividuality and are especially speedy and as to race horse qualities the perfor
mances of Coleridge 205 Choral 208 Connor 211 Arthur W 211 and others
are too recent and of too much merit to need any comment But few better sires
than C F Clay are now in the stud His colts are not only trotters but are show
horses as well having probably been awarded as many premiums at the leading
fairs as the get of any horse in Kentucky C F Clay will make the season of 1897
