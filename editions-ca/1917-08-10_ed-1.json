"Miss Willie T. Summers and Mr.
Edward F. Spears." So runs the rec
ord in the marriage license book in
the office of County Clerk Pearce
Paton.
Miss Summers, who is one of the
most beautiful and most accomplish
ed young women in t Paris, and Mr.
Spears, who is a son of Mr. and Mrs.

four hundred head of sheep which he
had shipped here for sale stock. Mr.

but finally succeeded in placing them
for the night on the farm of Mr. Will
Wornall. He will dispose of the
major portion of the sheep to-day at
private sale. Prices rule high this
year, the shipment brought in by
Mr. Clark bringing $13.50 each.
They were in good condition.
H0W THE ETERNAL FEMININE
FISHES.
It doesn't serve to mellow a man's
disposition to take a woman or two
into the boate when he goes bass fish
ing. For women always want to
fish, yet they never could or would
they stick those horrid, nasty wrig
gling angleworms on the hook. So,
between bating their hooks and re
moving the perch and pumpkin seeds
and straining your spine to keep the
boat from turning turtle and the
lines from getting snarled up, you
have a most enjoyable day's outing,
do you not? Yes, you do not! I'll
run the risk of answering that ques
tion for you. And then, when yoj
finally hook a five-pound bass weigh
ing at least three pounds and eight
ounces by his own standard scales,
and play him for twenty minutes
against their earnest entreaties not
to bring that big, ugly thing into
the boat or else they'd ju-4p out!
you calmly ease up on the line and
give him slack, also his freedom, do
you not? Yes, you do not! And
when the day is spent, they tell you
what a gorgeous time they have had
and make you promise to fetch them
again, and you promise, of course,
do you not? You do like Heaven!

BISHOP WOODCOCK SAYS WORRY
IS CRIMINAL.
"Don't Worry" that is a leading
plank in the creed of the Right Rev.
Charles B. Woodcock, Episcopal
bishop of Kentucky. Even if milk
is going up one cent a quart every
where next winter's coal is coming
from, the Bishop believes worry is
an evil. He made this declaration in
a sermon at the Cathedral of St. John
the Divine, in New York last Sunday.
"Worry is an evil," said the Bish
op. "It destroys more than rum or
vice. It is as sinful as drinking or
gambling. It is a guilty, sinful and
cowardly thing. It is always a per
gonal weakness.
"The absolute cure for worry is to
be as the bird who flies above the
wind-blown dust, and is therefore not
sullied. Se we must fly high above
the worries of the earth."
Bishop Woodcock said it was no
more sinful to drink yourself into the
gutter than to worry yourself into
the grave.
. "The people are getting life badly
mixed up," said the Bishop. "They
are shortening their lives by ten
years through senseless worry. Worry
weakens the heart and hardens
the arteries. People are carried away
by the mistaken idea that one can't
live without wcrrv. Men and wo
men doing anytlng on XJod's earth
should have no time to weaken their
soul by sensless worry'
DEATHS.
GUNSAULUS.
The body of Mrs. Elizabeth Gun
saulus, aged sixty-three, who died
suddenly Tuesday morning at the
home of her daughter, Mrs. S. B. Tay
lor, near Kiserton, was taken to her
old home in Cincinnati yesterday for
interment in the Wesleyan Cemetery.
Mrs. Gunsaulus is survived by four
daughters, Mrs. L. Britzer, Mrs. Tim
Daizey and Mrs. Dorothy Merty, of
Cincinnati, and Mrs.'S. B. Taylor, of
Kiserton; one son, Mr. JamesGun
saulus, of Hamilton, 0., and three
brothers, Robert Atkins, of Robert
son county, and William and Thomas
Atkinson, of Louisville.
WOODS.
The funeral of Mrs. Maggie Cain
Woods, aged forty-one, wife of Mr. M.
J. Woods, will be held at the Church
of the Annunciation, in Paris, at
nine o'clock this (Friday) morning,
with services conducted by Rev. Fa
ther Eugene DeBruyn. The burial
will follow in the Paris Catholic Cem
etery. Mrs. Woods had been ill but a few
days, and her condition was not such
as to cause any serious apprehension
among her family and friends. For
two days before her death she suffer
ed from heart trouble, which finally
caused her death, at the family home,
corner of Henderson street and Lil
leston avenue.
Besides her husband, she is sur
vived by two daughters, Misses Nellie
and Frances Woods, and four sons,
Thomas, Ned, William and Lawrence
Woods, and by two brothers, John
Cain, Sr., and W. F. Cain.

ASA MARTIN FORECASTS "POOR
MAN'S WINTER."
While suffering humanity is swel
tering under a torrid sun, with the
mercury sizzling aroung 90, Colonel
Asa K. Martin, widely known local
weather prognosticator, comes to the
rescue and offers some comfort in
his bulletin, just issued, forecasting
the weather for the next winter, in
which he states there will be fifteen
snows in Kentucky, the first falling
on November 11, 1917, and the last
on May 1, 1918. A May day snow
is of course a rarity for this latitude,
but Colonel Martin says we will have
it and that should settle it.
There will be no ice-gathering sea
son before Christmas, he says, but
we are to have a sharp cold snap
about Thanksgiving. Mild weather
is predicted during Christmas -week
in fact he says that overcoats can
be dispensed with on Christmas Day,
as it will be warm and pleasant. The
coldest weather of the winter will be
in January, when, he says there will
be two days when the mercury will
drop to zero. A big sleet is schedul
ed for some time in February, exact
date not stated. There will also be
one ice spell in this month, but he
says he will have to wait until
Ground Hog day to determine when
this will be.
On the whole, Colonel Martin says
that the coming winter is to be one
of the mildest that has been experi
enced in Kentucky in the last twenty-five
years and adds in his charac
teristic vein: "It will be a poor
man's winter all through the first
winter in years that the coal man
will suffer."

ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVES
PED IN BOXES.
SHIP-
Three large electric locomotives,
weighing 120 tons each, were ship
ped recently from Erie, Pa., to Chile,
South America, in knock-down form,
being boxed for convenience of
shipment, according to the Popula
Mechanics Magazine. They are in
tended for use in transporting iron
ore from the mines of an American
steel company at Tofo, Chile, 2,200
feet above the sea level, to Cruze
Grande, the nearest shipping port.
For a while the problem of getting
the engines to Chile baffled the traffic
men, as they were too big and too
heavy to be taken aboard ship in
tact. The only alternative was to
take them apart for shipment. When
this was done and the parts were
boxed it was found that each of the
locomotives occupied eight freight
cars and weighed 290,000 pounds.
There were sixty-two separate boxes,
ranging in size from over fifty feet
to only a few inches in length, the
largest weighing more than a ton be
fore being packed.

fort.
No information has been received

ate veteran, who makes the subjoin
ed additions to an article that ap
peared in the Kentuckian-Citizen a
few weeks ago:
"Maysville, Ky., Aug. 7.
"ED. THE NEWS, Paris, Ky.
"Dear Sir:
"Several weeks ago I read an arti
cle in a Paris paper in regard to the
soldiers from Bourbon county in the
war of 1861-1865.
"The writer failed to mention a
number of prominent Bourbon coun
ty soldiers, so I take the liberty of
mentioning a number of men, or the
'boys' rather from Bourbon.
In the
Federal service I recall the follow
ing: Lieut-Col. Thos. J. Vimont,
killed in action at the battle of
Sweetwater, Tenn. ; Thomas Jeff and
Jo. D. VJmont, Augustus Trotter,
John Isabell. Thos. Jeff Vimont, an
old schoolmate, was wounded at the
battle of Cynthiana, " on July 17,
1862.
I was with him all night af-
ter the battle, and furnished an affi
davit to assist him in securing an in
crease in pension a few years ago,
before he died at Paxton, 111.
"I recall the names of the follow
ing, who were killed in the Confed
erate service: Julius Purnell, at Ft.
Donelson; James Gregory, at Dallas,
Ga.; Clifton Mann, in Ohio; Willie
Talbott, at Cynthiana, the day after
he joined, and Will Trotter. Some
of the officers in the Confederate ser
vice were Capts. Dan Turney, J.
Lawrence Jones, Ed. Taylor, Adju
Jos. M. Jones, Lieuts. R. L. Bowles,
Jos. E. Hedges, George Redmon,

WHAT TO DO WITH GERMANY'S
"CRAZY WAR LORD."
We have just heard of an ideal
place to intern the Kaiser when the
war is over. It is the Queenstown
cemetery, where more than 1,000
bodies of Lusitania victims lie buried
The Town Hall, which was used as a
imorgue, has been practically desert
ed ever since. It could be moved to
the cemetery and used as a perma
nent home for the Kaiser. There,
among me sepuicmai snaaes of a
thousand of his innocent victims,
William the Last should be made to
spend his remaining years of life.
i There is just one flaw in such a pun-
jshment. His presence among the
graves of men, women and children
who were sacrificed to nis cruel am-
bition might seem a desecration of
tne- aeaa.
