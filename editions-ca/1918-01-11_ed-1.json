In a rear-end collision between a
north-bound Louisville & Nashville
passenger train and a switch en
gine at Wilder's Station, three
miles south of Newport, Tuesday
night, one man was. killed and twen
ty passengers were badly shaken
up.
The passenger train was said to
have been running an hour late
fiom Louisville to Covington. At
Wilder's Station it ran into an open
switch leading to a siding where
three switch engines were standing.
Chas. W. Peddicord, Jr., of Paris,
was engineer on the third switch
engine, jumped when he saw the
rtrash was inevitable, but his fire
man, J. A. Forbes, of Covington, was
caught between the engine and
tender and killed instantly.
Engineer Peddicord said that the
crews of the switch engines had no
time to return and throw the switch
after passing over it. The passenger
train crashed into his engine. The
tender of the switch engine was
driven into the cab by the force of
the impact. Peddicord's presence of
mind ajone saved him from sharing
the fate of his fireman. Rumors
came to Paris early Wednesday
morning that Peddicord had been
killed, but later reports refuted
them. The wreck was soon cleared
away.
