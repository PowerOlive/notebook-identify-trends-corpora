Wltkr Specialists Gf America

250000 Cured
WECURESTRICTURE
It ru always the hardest thing in the
world for me to do to wake up early
Eiglt consecutive nornings did I try to
get up at oclock In order to reach a
tain train that should take me to
delphia where business awaited my j
ence Tho earlier I went to bed the later
I slept and I began to feci demoralized
myself At all events I felt ashamed of
myself
I consulted with and opened my heart to
a friend of the name of Snapper He is
a sympathising cuss especially where it
co s him nothing Snapper suggested
that I buy an alarm clock to assist my
la k d al yeast
It vis advice and bought one
The ma sold it gave me lessons in
Operating it without extra charge I could
Bee through it like a hole in a board fence
All you had to do was simply to whirl a
little wheel-a-ma-gig around until a cer
tain figure pointed to the hour on the dial
the one which you wished to be bounced
out at and everything was serene
I bought that clock in tho evening un
beknown to my family and thinking I
had a sweet sure thing on being awak
ened at the proper hour I lingered with
soim1 friends in front of a julep reservoir
Bo it was past 10 when I got home and
everybody was asleep
My angelic mother-in-law had escaped
the perils of smallpox cholera etc and
had arrived that day to stay with us for
a few days Heaven what a number of
days it takes to constitute a few with
that mother-in-law
Well her long journey had tired her out
and she too had gone to bed Entering
softly I deposited my clock on the table
that stood at the head of our bed Then I
Bet her after which I carefully placed
myself horizontally in my little bed mak
ing no disturbance for I dislike lectures
and was soon lost to everything in the
shape of fear or anxiety
What a blessed thing deep is especially
win n you are not afraid and know you
are all right about getting up It will be
rved that I pause to n oralize
V ell 1 had really ot sleep on the brain
I was tinctured with it clear through
it there is not the slightest use of moral
izing or describing any further and I will
come to the point at one
In the dead watch and middle of tho
night I was rudely awakened by a Qerce
and agonizing yell from the partner of my
bed Not only that but 1 had the breath
nearly knocked out of my body by the
said partner throwing herself upon me In
her frantic endeavors to get out of that
bed I felt something was loose
As soon as my senses were revived I
beard the fearfulest
mingled with the wild shouts and groans
of my wife I was entirely confounded
myself She yelled Murder Thieves I
Police and with tottering steps she
made for the adjoining bedroom where
her mother was I followed In terror my
self for as yet I had not sufficiently come
to my senses to know what the deuce it
was all about anyhow
That mother-in-law leaped from her
dreams from her bed and seeing me
tremblingly trying to quiet her daughter
she at once concluded that I was trying to
murder her and came for me tooth and
nail Then I shouted then we all shouted
and the uproar was heard in the street
and murder was thought to be doing
Still that awful racket was kept up in
my bedroom The truth flashed over my
mind 1 had made a mistake in setting
my alarm clock and it had gone off I
rushed wildly for it I placed it between
the feather bed and the mattress but still
it kept on with its devilish racket Tho
women also kept up theirs I seized that
clock and rushed to the bathroom and
there let a flood of water upon it in the
hope of silencing it but all to no purpose
While this confusion was going on with
in the police had rapped for assistance and
had gained admittance to the house They
rushed up to our sleeping a artments and
burst in the door
Whats up Whats the row Where
is hey said one of them
My mother-in-law pointed them to the
bathroom where I was trying to drown
that confounded clock in a tub of water
The officers drew their clubs and pkstols
and charged upon n e I mounted the
tub and ointed to that clock which was
still dinging aw ay like something possessed
of t lie devil
What is the meaning of all this row
1 attempted to explain but the voice of
my mother-in-law was heard above all
wcids of mine
Take him away offers ITe has been
trying to murder us both Take him
away
In the meantime1 my wife jae swooned
One of the officers went for that clock
with his club He smashed it across the
snoot Hi1 welted it in the face He dis
located its lower juw He crippled Its
hands He knocked it out of time but
still it rattled away and it was not until
he had driven his No 12 boot In among
its liver and filings that It finally caved in
r concluded Id stop
Silence beinf partially restored 1 CX
plained tcthe officers how the whole rum
pus was occasioned and so far as they
wore concerned shay were inclined to
laugh at the whole affair and leave us
alone but my frightened mother-in-law
protested that I had an undoubted attack
of the jimjanig as I had been drinking
she said and nothing ihort of my going
to the station house would satisfy her
Sweet angel of my household
I dressed and went with them I took
the remains of that alarm clock with me
and after explaining to the captain all
about it all hands joined in a hearty laugh
and passed the remainder of the night
quite pleasantly with a pack of cards ard
a bottle of wine but no more alarm clocks
for me not any New York News
Wet and Dry
Why does a wet surface feel colder than
a dry one This is chiefly due to the
phenomenon of evaporation The majority
of liquids when left to themselves in con
tact with the atmosphere gradually pass
into a state of vapor and disappear
The passage from the liquid into the
gaseous state is accompanied by a great
loss of heat which is rendered latent by
the process of vaporisation Beyond this
when a substance is wet its conducting
power is increased and more heat is con
veyed from the hand to the surface
This is easily explained The hand does
not form a very perfect contact with a dry
surfaee leaving a certain small amount of
air space between and air is a very bad
conductor of heat When the surface is
wet however the contact is more exact
and the water forms a good conducting
medium

Colonel LangJale on being appointed
commandant of the Seventy first native
infantry resolved to weed out all the mar- j
ried officers seving with that corps To
this end he made the lives of the benedicts
extremely irksome so that they all applied
to be tranrferred to other regiments
In due course the Seventy first native
infantry was ordered to Haizapore the
principal military station of the presidency
when upon Colonel Langdale took a years
furlough to England It was generally
understood that the colonel would apply j
for an extension of leave and would re-
main in England until the regiments
term of service at Haizapore should have i
expired but he had not been home more I
than nine months when he wrote to Major j
Tarver informing him that he was about
to bo married and that after a short bon-
eymoon on the continent he should bring
his bride out to India with him 4You
will think mo inconsistent he explain-
ed but circumstances alter cases and
when you know Gwendoline you will I
am sure admit that I have acted wisely
and so on to the end of four closely writ
ten pages
Bah Theres no fool like an old fool
exclaimed Tarver tearing the letter to
pieces Well it s no affair erf mine He
must just dree his own weird
The terrible Indian plague had found Its
way to Haizapore at last All efforts to
arrest its progress had jvroved isefficacious
In the native city and surrounding vil
lages men women and children were dy
ing like Hies The roll of victims was
daily on the increase Custom makes us
familiar with and Indifferent to danger
and the pestilence had come to be regarded
as a matter of course an unpleasant but
necessary means of reducing the surplus
population rlie natives alone fell vic
tims to it The white men seemed by a
merciful dispensation of Providence to be
exempted from contagion There was
consequently no cessation of the usual
round of gayeties at Haizapore The can
tonment roads were thronged daily with
funeral processions on their way to the
burning grounds but tho bands at the
gymkhana ami the public gardens played
none the less cheerily though the wail of
Hindoo mourners rang louel in the air
In the native city where infection
paonrd rapidly from house to house whole
streets were being depopulated by the pes
tilence Many of the inhabitants had fled
carrying death and destruction frr and
wide into the country Others strong in
their fatalistic creed clung to their homes
and refused to budge comforting them
selves wmIi the philosophical reflection
that a man can die but once anil that
there is no escaping tho hand of fete It
became clear to tho authorities that unless
strong repressive measures were adopted
e very house in the city would become im
pregnated with the germs of disease anel
form a death trap for all future inmates
Tho troops in garrison were detaileel in
turn for plague duty their work con
sisting in examining every house and re
moving to the segregation hospital any
inmate found suffering from the prevail
ing malady When tho turn of the Seventy-first
native infantry came Major Tar
ver was ordered to superintend the un
pleasant work of examining suspected suf
I ferers and removing from the houses and
burning the clothes and effects of plague
patients
Tarver worked heroically at his uncon
genial task encouraging his men by his
examine He was Quite reckless of his
life anel would fearlessly enter houses
known to bo Infected and carry poor
Uague stricken wretches out in his own
arms One morning while riding to the
city ho was seized with a sudden faintness
but throwing it off by sheer force of will
1 he applied himself to his work with his
usual indefatigable zeal On returning
home in the evening ho hael no sooner en
tered his bungalow than his head began to
I swim his limbs to tremble a deadly feel
ing of nausea crept over him an
scribable numbing sensation pervaded his
wholo frame stupefying and maddening
him
A whisky and soda quick ho shout
ed to his servant at the same time throw
ing himself down on his bed
The man returning saw his master
writhing in agony swinging his arms
w ildly about the light of madness in his
eyes his lips bubbling with green foam
He dropped tho tray In abject fright
gasped Mabamari and ran to summon
i the regimental surgeon
Dr Mason stripping of Terrors shirt
discovered a blue livid lump under his
i left arm There could be no doubt about
it It was tho sign of the plague
Its bad business T fear said the doc
tor to Wilkinson of the Seventy whom
he met outside the house I fear them is
little chance of his recovery
Tho next morning Colonel Langdale
stopping on his way back from parade at
Tarvers bungalow to inquire after the
patient was surprised to see hia wifes
i pony trap standing at tne door A greater
j surprise was in store for kim for on
I kutlj entering the sickroom he saw his
wife Vneeiifcg With her back toward him
at the bedside clasping one of the sick
mans 1 ands iu both her own and heard
hT snv i n heartrending tones as
i
nc
cov
ered it with kisses
Speak tome Hubert luy darKg J
one word Tell me that you have forgiven
me You shall iot die dearest They
shall not take you from mo again Oft
Hubert if you only knew how much I love
you My marriage has been a mockery
anel a farae I only married for the sake
of a home Had it ben you dear how
happy my life would have been Oh why
did I not tell you I was free Speak Hu
bert It is you only I love For your
dear sake I would I
But the cold lips of the dying man gave
back no answer to her passionate appeal
Her look of lovo found no responsive glance
from the swiftly glazing eye The death
rattle was sounding in the dying mans
throat when with an access of passion al
most savage in its intensity Gwendoline
Langdale threw her arms round her lovers
neck and strained him fiercely to her
bosom in a last long lingering embrace
Let me die with yu she murmured
pressing her lips to his I am weary of
my life
The unwilling spectator of the scene had
stood motionless tongue tieel anel fascinat
ed He turned on his heel and silently left
the room
She told mo she loved me ho mut
tered and I was fool enough to believe
her I am rightly served for my credulity
