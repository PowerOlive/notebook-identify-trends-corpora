IHow Teachers May Heip.Teachers in the public schools of-a, certain city in this country haveset a precedent that should be followed generally.- They have unanimously agreed to contribute theirservices for one month of the present term free, in order to lengthenthe term.This is in a State where the publicfunds are not sufficient to warrantthe desired length of school term,and there are many States whereinthe concession would not be neces-sary. Still the concession wiuld bea splendid display of patriotism,even there.The school teachers of our country stand in the most responsibleposition in public life. They, arevery close to the young and "growing-mind of the youth, and their attitude on any question of the hour is'sure to liave a profound influencein shaping the views of thosf undertheir charge. If they display theproper degree of patriotism and selfsacrifice, there will be a ready response from the young.If every teacher in the countrywould decide to make a patriotic dosnation of a portion of his or her sal--arytosome department of the Nation's war activities, where the sameis not needed by the schools, in or' der to -secure a full term, they wouldset before our young people an example that could not fail to bear.great and lasting fruit.As To Exemptions.The enormous number of claimsffor exemption from arniy serviceconstitute a shame to American: manhood and a disgrace to our coun' try. It is proof positive as holywrit of one of two propositions:Either our young men are entirelylacking in patriotism or they are pitiful cowards.We lefer with contempt to theslacker who eluded the registration.But what of the infinitely more contemptible slacker who, while seemingly acquiescing on the draft, put- up a pitiful plea for exemptionplea that shows false and hypocritidcal on its face?All honor to that numerous contingent who, when was was assured,promptly tendered their services.All honor to another group who,while not so quick to volunteer, yetwhen the call came, stepped forwardlike men and took their medicinewith smiling faces. Such they4-ioth have made this the proud-country it is to-day.'Of course there are some perfectly legitimate claims for exemption."These will and should be granted.But the "exemption" slacker ugh!.

In this mammoth factory, one of the best equipped and most interesting in theworld,-are built the great guns forour war vessels, which carry to everycountry the message of America'sability to protect herseif and to safeguard the rights of her citizenswherever they may be., The new naval aircraft factory atPhiladelphia, which will be completed this month, will also employabout 3,000 men.The workers who man such plantsare of a superior class, and they feela personal pride in turning outproducts that will stand the test ofconflict with the arms of other nations. A considerable part of thewar vessels is also done in Government yards.The United States Civil ServiceCommission, which is charged withthe task of recruiting the ranks ofthis great civilian army, through iUwidespread organization is furnishing the men as they are needed. Incertain trades, particularly those !connected with shipbuilding, there isusually a shortage. Sailmakers, coppersmiths, shipfitters, s.nglesniiths,blacksmiths and mechanics are es-pecially neededWomen to operatepower sewing machines are also ingreat demand. The representativesof the Civil Service Commission atthe postoflices in all cities are theofficial recruiting agents for this aswell as other branches of the CivilService. The commission urges competent mechanics to offer their services to the Government at this thmof great need.IE3 tel ISCOLLECTOR WARNS AGAINST.

Roper, commissioner incharge of the internal revenue"bureau.At the instance of CommissionerRoper, Mr. Grayot is taking thismethod of warning the public to beon the lookout for such practicesand to report them if discovered.According to an official statementissued by the revenue department,attention was first called to a newspaper advertisement of a phonograph company, which stated" theprice and then explained that therewas 5 per cent, added for war tax.As a matter of fact, tne war tax onphonographs and other musical instruments is only 3 per cent.Many compliments have also beenreceived where the cos: or admissionto theatres and other places ofamusement has been increasedlargely in excess of the tax imposed.In explaining the increase, the managers said it was made necessary bythe imposition of the war tax.

The estimate on yield ofsame is 30 bushels per acre ascompared with 28 bushels yield in1916.It is early- to give the yield ofhemp, but the preliminary estimateis given at 991 lbs. per acre ascompared with 994 lbs. last year.In some localities it is expected tobreak out very light.The acreage of the potato cropwas unusually large this year, andaverage yield per acre is given98bushels. It is reported that labor isso scarce that in many communitiespotato digging is being done hy women in order that the farmers mayget the fall seeding done.Cane has also been damaged byfrost.All classes of live stock are infairly good condition, and the number on hand as compared with aneverage year, shows as follows:Horses 96 per cent; conditionshows at 94 per cent.Cattle 90 per cent; conditionshows at 93 per cent.Hogs 84 per cent; condition showsat 94 per cent.Sheep 86 per cent; conditionshows at 95 per cent.Pastures are short and show acondition of 87 per cent. More vegetables were raised this year thanever reported before.Taken as a whole the reportswould indicate that this year'scrops have been. gtfod, with both increased acreage and,in most instances, an -increased yield. However, conditions for all sowing ofsmall grains are unfavorable.Prices for everything are ranginghigh, but with an increased cost ofproduction and scarcity of labor itbecomes necessary for the farmer toget an increased price for his products in order to compensafe himfor the money and effort expended.Respectfully,MAT S.

It was under the shadow of the pyramids that brides first wore rings assymbols of wedlock.In the early Egyptian home it wasthe custom of the wife to keep all ofher jars, closets and stoierooms sealed.A different seal ordinarily was usedfor every door or jars containing cer. tarn foods. Preserved sweets, for iiiI stance, would be sealed with one device and some sharp appetizer w ithanother. So the course of time broughtthe Egyptian woman a goodly numberof seals, the special mark of her wifehood. Then it became a custom for thebridegroom on his wedding day topiesent the future homemaker with olittle string of seals. In the beginning. they usually were suspended from an! ornamental chain about her neck, butafterward it became the custom to car: ry the keys on an ornamental cordi around the wrist. And finally the keysi were attached to a woman's finger bymeans of a cord or gold wire. ThisI naturally meant reduction in the number of seals, and some genius of thej days of old hit upon the idea of combining the seal and the wire together,j from which we get the signet ring.. Such a ring was regularly presented tothe bride on her wedding day.j Things had reached this state ofprogress when keys seem to have beenfirst used in Egypt to any great extent.The coming of locks did away with thewifely seals and her peculiar mark ofsovereignty in the home. By degreesthe signet ring went out of fashion asthe special prerogative of the brideand was succeeded by a plain bandring such as every young lady of todayexpects to wear. Numbers of theseplain and signet rings have been foundin the old tombs of northern Africa,mute evidence of loves long since deadand gone.HARD WORK FOR CUPID.Roumanian Farmers Try to Keep Their. Sons From Wedlock.The Roumanian farmer doesn't thinkmuch of matrimony. A bachelor hasn'tmissed much, in his opinion. And ,when his son gets the marrying beebuzzing in his bosom the Roumaniadad is apt to take a hickory club andbeat it out of the young man's system.That's why tbe Roumanian youtJiwhen he is in love never confides thebappy secret to his father. He goesand tells his mother, for women stillbelieve in love and marriage, althoughthe3' lead from the altar to the washtub. But the father has faced the muleheels and the plow handles so long inhis hard struggle to feed the hungrymouths opened to him by marriagethat he has forgotten he was once alover sighing lover's tales. He is aboutas much in favor of state wide matrimony as a sick boy is in favor of castor oil.So the son tells his mother. Themother feeds father the best dinnershe can cook, and when the old manis in a mellow mood she breaks thesad news about their boy. If she isskillful enough she wins his grouchyconsent, -and he calls 'in his two bestmen friends. These two go with hisson to the girl's home. Perhaps shehas heard nothing of the love affair,but when she sees them coming sheguesses what's up. Her father entertains the visitors, and if he lets thefire go out it means he has taken thismethod to turn them down cold.Roumanian wives all have silk dressesor silk shawls. Their husbands do notbuy the silk for them: the women raiseit themselves. Exchange.Teeth Gritting a Symptom.When children grit their teeth, eitherasleep or as a habit when awake, itis generally a sign that they haveadenoid growths back of their nosesand need the attention of a physician.Dr. C. E. Benjamins tells in a journalof Amsterdam of his experience fc with1,344 cases of adenoids, in which about37 per cent of the children were teethgritters, and in most of the cases thegritting ceased when the adenoidswere removed. Among 113 teeth gritters he examined for troubles otherthan adenoids all but two were foundto have adenoids.Every man's conscience is his own,not another's. It is for him to determine what he shall or shall not believe. No outward force, howeverpowerful, can compel him.Leslie'sUiCMtiMhNe7pa? ,Ten cents here &- At the news stands everywWAR TALKSBy UNCLE DANNumber SixBillie and Jimmie Will Take MilitaryTraining. --"I am mighty sorry, Uncle Dan, thatthis is your last night with us.

Howard did not like it at first. Iam told for a few weeks he had 'roughsledding,' but after he found that theonly way was to obey orders, he caughtthe spirit of the institution and likedit.

Hereis a photograph showing 'before andafter taking,' and I am sure no patentmedicine advertisement could beat it."Well, mother and I were delighted.That was ten years ago, and, Howardsays the year he spent at the militaryacademy was the best year of his life."Now," said Uncle Dan, with- greatearnestness, "when such training doesso much good, makes better citizens andat the same time fits a man to defend'his country, why should not Uncle Samfurnish this training at the government's expense? The government hasthe right to call anyone to serve incase of war, and without training, aman is worth nothing as a soldier. Uncle Sam has splendid new trainingcamps that will soon be available' forthe purpose, therefore, here is doublereason why the Chamberlain bill forcompulsory military training should bepassed at once, so that every boy physically fit may have this training andnot leave it for his parents to pay for.On account of the expense, not one boyin 50 can take the training now. I amglad that you can do so. These bigcrops and big prices, I find, make theformers rather 'cocky, and that thebest is demanded by them."Billie was up with the lark the nextmorning, more excited and enthusiasticthan ever. He had a plan. He knewJimmie owned a colt worth $100 ; thathe would make almost another $100 onhis potatoes if they turned out well,,and that he had from his previoussavings, bought a $100 Liberty bond.BilHe's plan was to have Jimmie cashin and o with him. He was disappointed to find that Jimmie would stilllack about $300 of having enough tosee him through. His lip quivering, hesaid: "I'm mighty sorry to leave Jimmie." Uncle Dan was silent a moment ortwo, then he asked Billie to go dowrfto the orchard and get him some apples to eat on the train. While he wasgone, it was arranged that Uncle Danand Mr. and Mrs. Graham would advance the money necessary so thatJimmie could go. When Billie returnedhe was told about it. He ran to the'phone and called Jimmie, saying:"Comcon over, run just as fast as youcan, I've got the greatest news you.ever heard of.'' ,BWejalpSSalfc'.Afr'.w B "SSEfi''' 9!"One of theFamousFive""Use your car,passenger or commercial, more andmore tp relievethe transportationpressure on theNations railroadsand merchants'delivery service, "SAMUEL P.
