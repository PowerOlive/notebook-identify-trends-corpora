Keep Your Kodak Busy!
"The Army lives on letters" is the way the boys at
front put it. And when those longed-for envelopes with
the home town postmark contain pictures of the home
folks "and home doings they go far toward making lighter
hearts and happier faces.
Keep your Kodak busy for the sake of the lads in the
trenches, the boys in camp and on shipboard. Help keep
tight the bonds between the home and those who are
fighting for that home.

. WILLIAMS.
Nothing in recent years has so
shocked the people of Paris as the
sudden death of Mr. J. Douglas
Williams, who for many years has
been behind the desk at the Wind
sor Hotel, tin this city.
Mr. Williams was in his usual
health on Thursday night, and jupt
before closing for the night, he was
talking and exchanging stories with
a group of traveling men in the
office. As he went to his room for
the night, he turned to the group
and remarked that he felt better
than for years. This was the last
time he .was seen alive. On Friday
morning when he failed to appear
for duty at the usual hour, and the
usual call meeting no response, a
messenger was sent to his room. He
found Mr. Williams apparently
sound asleep. Al efforts to awaken
him proving unavailing, a physician
was called, who, upon examination,
pronounced Mr. Williams' death to
have taken place several hours pre
vious. He had passed away peacefully, as
there was no indication of a struggle.
His death was ascribed to heart
trouble, of which he had frequently
complained.
Mr. Williams was a native of Bath
county, where he was born seventy
four years ago. Most of his younger
life was spent on his father's farm
near Sharpsburg. He came to Paris
when a young man, and was em
ployed in various capacities. About
ten vears aso he became an attache
of the Hotel Windsor, were by his
uniform courtesy and attention to
patrons he became universally
known and very popular. He was
very fond of children and it was hi3
greatest pleasure to have a group of
the little ones around him as his
guests.
Mr. Williams is survived b3r two
sisters, Mrs. Blannie D. Shipp, of
Lexington, and Miss Lucy Williams,
of Covington; one niece, Mrs. Wm.
