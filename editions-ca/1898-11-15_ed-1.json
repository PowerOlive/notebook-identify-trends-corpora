Confusion at These Dinners
In his dining room Sir Joshua Rey
nolds constantly entertained all the best
known men of his time including Dr
Johnson Goldsmith Garrick Burke
Sterne Hogarth Wilkes Allan Ram
say and a score of others who formed
the brilliant Literary club of which the
great painter was the founder There
doubtless in the familiar lines of the
author of Retaliation
When they talked of their Raphaels
gios and stuff
He shifted his trumpet and only took snuff
At these dinner parties according to
Malone though the wine and the dishes
were of the best there seemed to be a
tacit agreement that mind should pre
dominate over body The tahle we are
told though set only for seven or eight
often had to accommodate double that
number There was usually a deficiency
of knives forks and glasses and the
guests had to bawl for more supplies
while the host calmly left every one to
shift for himself though he lost not a
word if he could help it of the conver
sation London Telegraph
Appropriate Hymns
Some people have peculiar notions of
what is appropriate Some time ago
a resident of a neighboring town was
preaching at the Gladstone jail and
prefaced his remarks by regretting the
small attendance At a race meeting
held at a band was engaged to play
appropriate music and it was found
that the numbers selected were from
Moody and Sankey Go Bury Thy Sor
row was one of them and the others
were all equally appropriate
Christmas religious service was held
at the local jail and hymns suitable to
the occasion were of course selected
The first one was Free From the Law
Oh Happy Condition and the last
Well Never Leave This Safe Abode
a Refuge In the Time of Storm The
funny side of it all appealed to some of
the inmates and the intended good ef
fect of the service was lost Adelaide
Quiz
Bismarcks Intense Hate
That Prince Bismarck was a good
hater is shown in the reminiscences of
Herr von Tiedemann formerly chief of
the imperial chancellery During the
first dinner at which Herr von Tiede
mann was present with the prince Bis
marck said he thought Goethe was
wrong in saying that only love beauti
fied life Hate did the same service and
was quite as great a vivifier as love
To me added the princeare indis
pensable love for my wTife and hate for
Windhorst One morning Bismarck
said to Herr von Tiedemann I have
not been able to sleep I have hated the
whole night
Domestic Science
What do you understand by the de
partment of domestic science
Its where they teach women how
to keep their husbands away from the
clubs
Of course the answer was wrong but
they all felt that she ought to go to the
head of the class just the same Chi
cago Post
As lato as 1682 squirts or syringes
were used for extinguishing fire in Eng
land and their length did not exceed
two or three feet with pipes of leather
Water tight seamless hose was first made
in Bethnal Green in 1720
To show the carelessness of mothers
in Great Britain over 3000 children
are burned to death in the year from
their clothing catching fire

or Government Money
At close of our Civil War in 1865
there appeared in the London Times
the following
If that mischievous financial pol
icy which had its origin in the North
American Republic during the late
Civil War in that country should be
come indurated down to a fixture
then that government will furnish its
money without cost It will have all
the money that is necessary to carry
on its trade and commerce It will
become prosperous beyond precedent
in the history of civilized nations of
the world The brain and wealth of
all countries will go to North America
THAT GOVERNMENT MUST BE
DESTROYED OR IT WILL DE
STROY EVERY MONARCHY ON
THIS GLOBE
The famous Hazzard circular to
capitalists in New York and the Buell
Bank circular to United States jank
ers both emanating from London and4
the fabulous corruption fund raised in
England and Germany estimated at
1500000 were the agents that se
cured the closing of our mints against
silver
The walk into my parlor policy
of England during and since the
Spanish War is the latest evidence
of English Diplomacy in shaping the
destiny of the United States Govern
ment
Notwithstanding the famine price
of wheat the Spanish War and fabu
lous expenditures of money by our
government during the past year gold
has increased in value eleven per cent
and all other values decreased in the
same proportion
For a thorough understanding of
the money question or silver issue
the Cincinnati Enquirer has uniformly
given evidence of its ability to teach
explain and produce all facts and
truth It is a paper that ought and
can be read by all classes with pleas
ure and profit
