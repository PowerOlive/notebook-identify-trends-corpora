Elder Thomas Smith, acred abonfc
50 ears, died Sunday morning at his
home in Milieroburg, after a brief ill
ness of peritonitis and gallstone. He
had been complaining only a few
days. He was pastor of the Christian
church of Millersburg and on Wednes
day jnight was unable to conduct his
prayer meeting service.
On Thursday he was able to be up
about the house and no one thought
his condition serious. Thursday night
he grew much worse but did not call
his attending physician, Dr. W. V.
Huffman, untilJFriday morning. As
soon as the doctbr saw him "ha realiz
ed his condition was critical and that
something had to be done immediate
ly. At times during the day Friday
and Saturday up till the afternoon it
was thought he showed symptoms of
being some better. About 5 o'clock
Saturday afternoon he took a decided
change for the worse and from 8
o'clock on his death was momentarily
expected. Elder Smith was a native
of England' As he is a co)mparative
stranger here little is known of his
life.1 About twenty-eight years aero
a theological course at the Bible col
lege, after he returned to his own
country and from there to Australia
where he preached for a time. About
eighteen years ago he returned to
America, locating in Texas, and has
followed his ministerial pursuits. For
a short time during his early life in
Texas he was engaged in the real es
tate business, which'proved profitable
to him. This he did not continue
long and since then his entire time
has been given up to his ministerial
work. Shortly after going to the
Lone Star State he married and this
union was blessed with three sons.
It was his one ambition that these
sons be educated from the same insti
tution where he received the best
part of his education: Ater placing
two of these sons in the Bible College
at Lexington he and his good wife
wanted to locate near them. Early
in January Elder Smith came to Lex
ington and as the Millersburg church
was without a pastor he was recom
mended to this' charge. He visited the
town and was later called by the of
ficial board. He was not only a good
preacher but an excellent scholar, a
fine student and a brilliant lecturer,
a' good mixer and soon won a host of
friends, in other churches as well as
his own. He was thoroughly devot
ed to his work and srave it all his !
time and attention.
The funeral services will be con
ducted this afternoon at 3:30 o'clock at
the Christian church, Elder J. W.
Ligon, of Lexington, officiating. The
burial will take place in the Millers
burg cemetery.

Home Saved in Strange Manner.
That Preaidnet Carence LeBus, of
the Burley Tobacco Society, was born
under a liicky star has generaally been
conceded by those who know him most
intimately, but perhaps his good for
tune was never more strikingly evi
deced than by "an occurrence a lew
days ago at his .old home in Cynthiana,
which savedhim several thousand doll
ars, and which was so strange as to be
almost incredible.
Mr. LeBus owns a handsome resi
dence on East rPike street in Cynthi
ana-, which he and his family 'occupied j
before removing to Lexington and
which'is now looked after by nis broth
er, Frank LeBus. A few days ago j
Mr. Frank LeBus, who canies the
keys to the residence, which is uroccu
pied.decided.to'look through the hcuse.
to see lr everything was in order. On
his round of inspection he heard water
leaking from a water pipe and upon
investigation discovered that a miracu
lous thing had hapDened without the
knuwledge or intervention of any one.
A large hole had been burned in the
floorSof an"upstairs room, but a spray
of wafer was nlaying on the charred
noards, having extinguished the blaze
before it .got under way and spread
destruction throughout tne mansion.
Closer investigation showed that de
fective electric light wiring had set
the floor on fire while the house Was
locked up, but strange to relate the
heat from the flames had partially
melted a"lead pipe which happened to
be located so conveniently near that
the water gushed forth and extinguish
ed the incipient conflagration,, th'us
saving the handsome residence. A?nd
it was this automatic fire hydrant in
operation which attracted Mr. Frank!
LeBus attention and showed him 'the
marvelous thing that had come to pass.
The story sounds incredible, butt it
is vouched for bv the Cyrithiana ijog
Cabin, one of the most reliable news
papers in the Stated v "
1912, on the premises, at the
hour of 2 o'clock p. m., I will
