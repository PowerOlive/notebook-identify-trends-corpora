A Wooden Venus That Walked and a
Brazen Man That Talked A Wonderful
Mechanical Duck The Greatest of All
the Fraudulent Automatons
There are few things more attractive
to the generality of men or more calcu
lated to excite their wonder and admira
tion than a dexterously and mysteriously
contrived automaton There is indeed
something almost uncanny in the sight
of a figure made by mens hands acting
like a creature of flesh and blood and
this uncanniness is one of the most suh
tle of fascinations Hence the silver al
the curious readily finds its way into
the pockets of men ingenious enough o
invent such marvels
This passion for the automaton is cer
tainly no new thing One meets it in
almost the earliest books sometime
veiled in myth sometimes more direct
ly stated Vulcan it will be remenr
bered made automatic tripods for the
gods of Olympua stools which ad
of their own accord to the ban
queting table and so retired when the
feast was over
Aristotle tells us that the human au
tomata which Daedalus made were so
active that it was necessary to keep
them tethered for fear they would run
away The same philosopher describes
a wooden Venus who walked about and
gives also the secret of the phenomenon
She was filled with quicksilver a some
what crude device Albertus Magnus is
credited with having made a brazen
man who talked and St Thomas Aqui
nas with having pounded it to pieces
with a club suspecting it to be a work
of satan Some marvelous feats of
mechanism are credited to John Muller
otherwise known as Kegiomontanus
who flourished in the fifteenth century
and in dealing with him we perhaps
touch firmer ground One was an iron
fly which flew around a table another
a wooden eagle which went out to meet
Emperor Maximilian on his entry of
Nuremberg on June 7 1470 and re
turned with him to the city gates
Whether due or not to the stimulus
given by Louis XIV the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries were in France
times of great automatic activity In
deed the first named century marks the
beginning of the really bistagfcal era of
automata In the eighteenth centurj
lived Mr Vaucauson perhaps the most
wonderful of all makers of automata
and the creator of the famous duck
which first appeared before the public
in 1741 The duck was Vaucansons
masterpiece and completed a reputation
already made wide by his mechanical
flute player and an automatic musician
which not only blew upon the flageolet
but also kept time to it on a tambourine
The bird was of life size and not only
was it outwardly an exact imitation to
a feather of a real duck but its internal
anatomy was absolutely true to life So
indeed were its movements for it
swam dived walked quacked ate
drank and by an ingenious device even
seemed to digest its food
This automaton disappeared after its
inventors death but turned up again
in 1840 in a garret in Berlin and was
purchased by a George Tiets who took
four years to put it in proper working
order again At the end of this time it
was exhibited in a room in the Palais
Royal Paris where Mr Houdin the
celebrated conjuror saw it and indeed
afterward when something happened
to one of its wings took charge of and
repaired it No doubt it is still in ex
istence Of more modern automata this
is scarcely the place to speak for they
are private secrets Let us confine our
selves to merely mentioning Mr Mas
kelynes Psycho and Zoo
Like most things automata have not
always been what they seemed Of
many frauds upon the wonder loving
public perhaps the completest was that
of the famous automatic chess player of
Mr Kempelen which was exhibited
all over Europe at the end of the last
century and afterward in America It
was the figure of a life sized Turk seat
ed behind a large box the top of which
was marked in the middle for chess
Prior to the automatons meeting an
opponent the front of the box was open
ed and skeptical lookers on were shown
an arrangement of strings pulleys and
cylinders After this they were allowed
to examine the interior of the figure
which was hollow Then Mr Kempe
len wound up his Turk with a key and
it was ready to play which it did by
moving the pieces with its left hand
and giving three nods for check to king
and two for check to queen All the
noted chess players of Europe succumb
ed to the figures superior strategy and
its skill so impressed the Empress Cath
erine II of Russia that she wished to
buy it and was with difficulty persuad
ed by Mr Kempelen to give up the idea
It was not for years that the secret was
discovered but like most secrets it
leaked out at last The real chess play
er was a Mr Wronsky a Polish ex-captain
both of whose legs had been am
putated at the trunk in consequence of
a wound from a cannon ball While the
spectators were examining the box
Wronsky was in the Turks body and
when they turned to inspect that an in
genious mechanism slid him back into
the box To the fact that Wronsky was
a ches3 player of consummate skill the
wide fame of the automaton which he
secretly controlled is to be attributed
After this disclosure Mr Kempelen s
automaton naturally enough ceased to
move mankind to wonder New York

EXAMPLES FROM THE DAYS
DSDALUS TO THE PRESENT
How an Actress and Doctor Were Foollsg
Each Other
In French theaters the doctor of the
theater has a seat given him for every
performance He must be there every
evening Naturally after he has seen
the same piece a score of times he longs
to be olsewhere and prefers to give his
seat to some of his friends M Ernest
Blum says that when be was a young
man a friend the doctor of the Theatre
Porte St Martin gave him his seat
Just as he was becoming interested in
the first act the stage mauager rushed
up the heroine had a nervous attack
and required medical aid Blum had
nothing else to do but to follow him
In the ladys dressing room be found
the manager with anguish depicted on
every feature and the lady wringing
her hands and shrieking
Now doctor quick Whats to be
done
Blum grew as red as a lobster aud
as he could not say an thing he just
ejaculated Hm Let us see Let us
see
He took the ladys hand in a wild at
tempt to feel her pulse She shrieked
more than ever and writhed like a
snake
Have you poured any water on her
head he asked
Yes
And no effect
None
Then dont pour any more
After this display of medical knowl
edge he continued
Give her a sniff of eaude cologne
Havent any was the answer
Then go fetch some
Off rushed the manager and the stage
manager and Blum was left with his
patient
Suddenly she opened her eyes aud
smiled
Doctor she said you area good
fellow arent you
Yes niamseile
You must be doctor Now listen
There is nothing the matter with me
You would have found that out soon I
want a couple of days off Cant you j
manage it
Delighted he replied joyfully
Now mamsello youre a good fel
low too I am not a doctor I came in
on the doctors ticket so you must not
give him away
By this time the mauager and stage
manager came back each with a bottle
of eau de cologne He told them that it
was unnecessary now The lady was
quite composed and could appear with
out any danger But she must have a
few days rest They made wry faces
but granted the holiday Philadelphia

THE FISHS COLOR
Able In a Marvelous Degree to Adapt
Itself to Its Surroundings
It is a familiar fact that fishes1 can
change their colors at will Many fishes
make remarkable changes Free swim
ming fishes most commonly preserve
their normal colors though these fisbes
can change The fishes that change mast
are the bottom feeders For their own
protection from other fishes that would
prey upon them and the better to enable
them themselves to capture food these
change their colors to match the bottom
they are on so as to make themselves
invisible They do this often to a degree
that seems extraordinary
In one of the smaller saltwater tanks
at the New York aquarium there are a
number of small flatfish The bottom of
the tank is covered with coarse gravel
The great bulk of the gravel is com
posed of pebbles of a brownish white a
sort of pale iron rust color Scattered
in this are pebbles cf a deeper tinge
with now and then one of a brownish
gray or brown black
The flatfish lying on the gravel at the
bottom of this tank imitate its colors in
their own backs in a manner that is
marvelous They are of a mottled brown
like the colors of the gravel and the
smallest of the flatfish is the most
wonderful They are all thin and lie
close to the bottom The edge of the lit
tle one blends with it and its back is a
wonderful mosaic of browns so like the
gravel of the surrounding bottom that
it appears to be a part of it Even in
this clear water at a little distance the
fish is scarcely distinguishable New

Trying- a Bead Man
It is probably an unusual thing in
any country for a court to sit in judg
ment on the dead but in a Berlin letter
to the Chicago Record an account is
given of a trial in which the accused
was a dead man
It was not his first trial That had
taken place in his lifetime and its re
sult had been a sentence of imprison
ment for 18 months The delinquent
was bureau chief in the tax office of
Schweidnitz Silesia and it was proved
that he had embezzled funds and forged
documents Soon after his sentence
however he showed signs of unsettled
reason and at longth died a maniac
His widow anxious to clear his mem
ory from the stain that rested upon it
had the case reopened and proved by
expert testimony that her husband had
been demented at the time he commit
ted the crime
Thus occurred the peculiar circum
stance of a dead man on trial The trial
resulted in the reversal of the former
sentence the court pronouncing rlie de
ceased not guilty
