appetizing to look upon it provestoo substantial to really melt in themouth as it should A certain familyhad banished this stand by from theboard but have now welcomed it backas if it were a newly discovered dishso different is the flaky concoction nowserved to the leathery horror of yoreSo simple are the means that broughtabout this change that they are givenfor the benefit of our readersThe tender discovery this omeletteis now dubbed and this is the historyThe women folk of the had thecozy cheerful kitchen as usual tothemselves one Sunday evening and ahot relish had been begged for by thepater It was Beckys turn to presideover the range and she resolved to apply some common sense hints she hadfound in some such column as this Shedared not whisper omelette She mightas well have suggested fried soleleatherTo make an omelette tender she hadread it must be cooked slowly like acustard and the eggs not whipped separately or even until frothy only afew strokes to render them smoothand not stringy Two omelettes of foureggs each cooked on small pans wereadvised for a good sized family ratherthan a large one of eight eggs so sheput two frying pans about the size of adinner plate to get very hot while shewas whipping the eggs adding to pichfour a half teaspoonf ul of salt pepperto taste and a teacupful of milk Holding the pan to her cheek to test theheat and finding it sizzling she putin a teaspoonful of butter and whenthis had been spread over the pan bya twirl of the handle the contents of oneof the bowls was stirred up and pouredthereinIt was left on the hot part of thestove the pan being gently shakenmeanwhile just long enough to makesure the bottom was evenly browneda broad bladed knife thrust to the center once to allow the hot butter toreach this sensitive middle spot whichotherwise would scorch before thewhole was brown As the pan was hotonly the same time was allowed aswould make a pancake ready to turnA cook who never trusts to guessworkhowever may remove the pan near thelight and lift the edges sufficiently tosee if proper browning has taken placeUpon the slow cooking at this stagedepends the desired tenderness so thepan was covered with a saucepan lidand put where it would only just keephot while the other omelette receivedits share of attention Ten minutesfrom the time the eggs were brokensufficed for the whole performancewhile a tough omelette maj be produced in five The ten minute varietydo not toughen when they cool and aretherefore excellent for school sandwiches as a change from meatA celebrated Erench chef to whoma lady sent her cook to learn to makethis very dish insisted uponlike appearance and we alrknow whata crumbly horror is a baked custardcooked too quickly His idea was precisely the same as Beckys but will bea new one to many Cincinnati Commercial TribuneOVERDRESSED WOMENInordinate Vanity Encourages theGrovrth of Loud GowningShe is as plain as the pipestem in herdressTo this comment uttered in a mostcontemptuous tone I replied I sincerely admire the good sense thatprompts a woman belonging to the middle classes to dress quietly Her socialgrade calls for only the simplest modesYou cannot deny that the subject ofyour criticism is always presentableno matter where she goes or with whomshe is thrownMy defense did not please I could seeI was regarded as decidedly queerThis however rarely deters me fromspeaking my mind I certainly felt impelled to do so on this occasionThe evil of our day is overdressingThis evil as a rule I do not find amongrich women but in the midst of thoseof my sex who are bus- aping theirwealthier sistersLimited incomes are responsible forthe constant appearance of gowns hatswraps that become tawdry simplj because of their environments This mustof necessity be so for the woman ofaverage means has by comparisonsparse opportunities for dress displayHer inordinate vanity refuses to admit this When she buys an elaborate article of dress it is done with butone object in view namely to find inher mirror an image that pleases herShe does not stop to consider how thisbit of extravagance is to be fitted intoher everyday surroundings Shesqueezes and

sunlit valleyIs a voice I used to hearIn the swell of that far off chorusIt rises full and clearAnd the sheen of a childish beautyComes back with its bloom and glowAs the mother sings in the

splendidplace I can take a look at it everytime I come bySaying which with a whoop and abound Pete dashed over the bramblesstones and fallen trees to reach histeam standing in the rough countryroadPete worked in a lumber camp far upin the dense forest of one of the northern states He enjoyed his work wellenough but with all his heart he longedto go to school and the work camealas almost with the opening ofschool His mother was a widow withyounger children and never once didPete dream of failing to bring all hisenergies to her helpBut he did not quite relinquish hisstudies His school books were carefullyloosened from their bindings so that alew leaves at a time could be slippedinto his pocket You would wonderhojy a boy so situated could find anybooks But Pete fixed manva rule iti his head while waiting for hisliorses io take a rest or during hisshort lunch time And although thehard work pure air and keen coldmade early sleep a necessity he stillstole many a precious half hour bythe bright glancing light of the greateabin fire until often when overcomewith drowsiness hauled off to his bunkby the older onesPete was a faithful worker and hadthis winter been promoted to the officeof driver to one of the supply wagonsThese were drawn by four or six horsesto the nearest small towns there to beloaded with things needful to the comfort of the camp Pete rejoiced in thechange of occupation for on his intrip when his wagon was almostempty he could safely take many a peepat his book while on the way out with1 his load he had to give the horses longaestsIt was during one of these thatwithout going out of sight of his wagonhe set the trap which he hoped mightbring him a little money to spend onbooks It was a winter of unusualseverity and he had become greatlyexcited by stories he heard of the greatsuccess of hunters and trappers Hunting was out of the question for himbut a trap Avould do the work while hewas at other things So with a heartaglow with hope he leaped on hisheavy wagon gathered a handful ofreins and urged on his horsesFew perhaps who have not drivena lumber camp supplj wagon can imagine the hardiness and roughness ofthe work Until good sleighing comesthe wild roads always bad are doublyso in winter and a journey of 25 milesis a hard days work It is pleasant tobe able to say that the drivers aregentle in the treatment of their horsesdriving them with patience and givingthen the best of care Day after dayon his going and returning journeysPete visited his Ipap with the hope offinding a prize If he had good luckbut once in the course of winter itwould be all he could ask But as timewent by without any return for hisoutlay on the trap he began to givet up as a bad bargainAfter a period of comparatively mildweather winter again settled down tosenious work The great trees in thewoods icreaked and groaned under the2ruel touch of the frost Fresh relaysof blankets were sent out to the campsnh the rpugb fireplaces were piledhigher with logs and brush Snow layrlepp and animals driveu from theirfar away hiding places in search ofiood ventured near the abodes of menalike fearful and fearedHelloLook thereTwo boys of near Petes age werepassing through the woods Theywere well known to him and to othersas belonging to the class whowhile thev might have had regular-work preferred to leau a shiftlesskfcfi to inouth life hunting trappingoe fishing only working when driven toit by dire necessityThe two just coming over a steeprise in the woods stood breathless atwhat they sawA bear Lookout dont go nearPshaw Hes

oldest boyLets go and tell Pete and makehim pay us for letting him know saidSamWell do bettern that said DickWhy thrt skinll keep us for amonthYou dont mean heyThats just what I doWish wed brought a gun saidSam as at length they stood near theanimal which mad with rage and painmight have inspired fear in older huntersLook-a-here said Dick with anair of serious consideration thats ayoung bear Theyve been advertisingfor a live bear down at the park inAshfield Theyll pay a lot for a goodoneBut how can we get hini aliveThats it said Dick pausing indeliberation It wont do to let himstay in the trap Well just have to tiehim by the legs with this rope Its agood strong one Thatll hold him tillwe get father and Uncle Hi to comeand help with himBut who wants to go at his legs witha ropeThats easy enough You pokehim in front with a stick while I slipa noose on his hind legs to start withWith a courage remarkable in twosuch mere boys and worthy of a better cause the two approached the enraged animal Sam secured a stoutstick and worried him to still greaterfuryThats it said Dick between twopants as lie watched his chance at thehind legs Keep clear of them uglypaws Sam now then if he onlywould keep a little stiller so I couldget a bit of a chance at himLook out there screamed Samin a voice of terror Run RunWhy what Dick began in bewilderment at his brothers frantic gesticulationsThen as a pair of angry eyes turnedon him he saw In his efforts to distract the attention of the bear Samsstick had got between the jaws of thetrap and pried it open Their infuriated enemy was at libertyDick ran for his life Still shoutinghis warnings Sam was already climbingthe nearest large tree Dick made foranother but the snow was deep hecould not go fast and the bear rapidlygained on him Still he hoped to findsafety among the hemlock branches farabove his headBruin however was something of aclimber himself as poor Dick soon realized Amid the scratching snortingand sniffing just behind him the terrified boy felt a tap on his back and witha howl of dismay sprang further upAgain his ugly foe came within closeneighborhood until the boy crept outon a branch so thin that Bruin wiselyrefrained from followingWhat shall we do now calledSamI dont knowIll get down and go for somebodyHe might get after youBut Sams courage had not yet evaporatedIll do it Ill get a good start onhim You hold on good he addedcheerily Ill soon scoot home andbring father and Uncle HiHe reached the lowest branch anddropped immediately raising a dismalcryWhats the matter called DickIve hurt my foot A great stonewas under the snow Oh I cant takea stepAfter two or three attempts he sankdown on the leeward side of a brushheapDick was a little the worse off inthe close neighborhood of his dreadedenemy and exposed to cold intensifiedby a wind which cut to his very bonesHis meditations on the situation werenot cheeringWhat if I cant hold on I couldntclimb down Id fall That fellowd beafter me I shouldnt stand a ehanceeven if I didnt break my legs which Ilikely should Sam he called to hisbrother we aint very far from theroad Somebody might be passinLets hollerThey shouted their cry ringing fartnrougn tlie frosty airWhats thatThrough the crunching of his runners on the hardsnow Pete heard a cryof distressHelp Help This wayHe stopped his horsey and listenedIt was very near the spot where he hadso often rested fiem to make a run tohis trap and it was from that very direction that the call cameHelp HelpIm comingHe sprang from his load quicklytied the leaders and ran toward thesoundIn the direction of his trap sureenough Close above it was the surprising sight which caused Pete topause for a moment in blank amazement A shivering boy hanging to anupper bough of a tree and just belowhim a bear angry and threateningOh Pete help us out of this Dofor goodness sake Pete Kill him orsomething Im freezing and Samssprained his foot I cant hang onmuch longerHowd he get you there askedPete half bewildered And at the samemoment his eye fell on his trap stillwich the stick between its jawsWe began Sam half cryingOh Pete its your bear said DickWe was gettin him out and he gotloose and oh Fete well never do thelike again longs we live neverIt was really a condition in whichany ordinary boy might have rejoicedand Pete did rejoice His bear a bearat last his proudest hopes realizedAnd there was wonderful satisfactionin seeing the boys who would haverobbed him so ingloriously come upwithBut Pete bore no malice in his heartand was quite ready to forgive the halffrozen rogues who continued tlhroughchattering teeth to pour forth appealsfor helpHold on a bit longer he said encouragingly Ive got a gun in thewagonHurrying with it back to the treePete was confronted with the dangerof shooting the boy instead of thebearShoot away at length said Dickdespairingly I miglit as well getshot as froze to deathPete shot and wounded the bearThe ugly brute fell to the ground torise with terrible energy against thisnew foePete dropped his gun and ran thebear in close pursuit bleeding at everystride It is difficult to say how thisnew chase might have ended had notDick clambered down from the treewith a celerity scarcely to be expectedfrom one in his benumbed conditionand seized the gun Another shot andthe clumsy form swayed and rolledoverAs Pete came back Dick stood nearthe bear and met his pleased ejes witha dogged scowlI shot him tie saidHot anger blazed in Petes eyes asDick faced him with a cool glancewhich told what he meantThe rope which Dick had tied to thebears leg stretched at their feet Witha quick movement Pete passed itaround Dicks body and flung himagainst a tree trunkHere you go he said moving withall the energy of honest indignationBound and round yes thats goodand tight Bound again Yes youmay keep your hands free you cantdo no harm with em Now a knotright behindAfter which Pete came around andfaced his enemyThats a good stout rope of

turned and walkedaway You aint agoin to leave methis way Im freezin PeteIm hurt Pete Sam added hiswhimper to the clamor after the boythey would have wrongedPete strode on not with the slightest intention of leaving the rascals totheir well merited suffering but tomake time for considering the situation If he released the boys therewas nothing to prevent their unrighteous claim to the bear Dick having already shown him the worthlessness ofhis wordTo his great joy he heard the shoutsof a driver and recognized in an approaching teamster one of his friendsAfter a few rapid words of explanationhe led the newcomer to the scene of theexciting occurrences of the past 15minutes -Xow look a here he said to Dickpointing to the bear whose bearsthisYourn said Dick sullenlyWhose is it

welldressed man and woman look as iftheir good clothes belonged to themwhile the dressed up individual alwayshas the air of belonging to his clothesYou can spot a dressed up person anywhere particularly in a woman Shesmoothes her gloves as one smoothes adesirable new acquaintance she patsthe fluffs and frills and folds of hergown as one pats a child whom hewould know better and she tugs at herhat and peeps at her shining boots asif she feared they would run awayfrom her A well dressed woman neverdoes any of these things She is unconscious of her fine attire because sheis used to it Men arent a whit behindwomen in this matterso the women allsay They declare that a dressed upman looks even more awkward than advessed up womanwhat do you think a man saidto me the other day exclaimed

often desired to measure a tierof wood that is irregularly piled upSelect a portion of the tier that hasthe top gradually sloping Measurethe height at each end of the slopeadd together and divide by two Thiswill give the average height of theportion taken Multiply this heightby its length and then by the breadthand you have the cubic contents NowWv 8 C tlTB Q -MEASURING WOOD PILEStake another section and proceed asbefore In the cut we measure theheight at a and c The half of thesetwo heights will give the averageheight Next take the section fromc to d This maintains an even heightso the length breadth and thicknesscan be multiplied together In theslope from d to b proceed as in thefirst slope Add the cubic contents ofthe three sections together and divideby 128 This will give the number ofcords Tiers vary in their regularitybut the principle here illustrated canbe used with any of them OrangeJudd FarmerSAVE THE FEATHERSA Source of Income IVegrlected byMany Poultry KeepersPoultry feathers should be kept forstuffing pillows sofa cushions andother home conveniences even where itis not deemed worth while to sell themGeese and duck feathers being muchmore valuable than others should always be preserved with care Downyfeathers of hens and turkeys serve avery good purpose and unless youwish to make dusters of tail and wingfeathers the soft feathery portions ofthese may be stripped off the quill andadded to the rest Unless the flock islarge it will take some time to secureenough feathers to stuff even a cushionand as they are gathered from time totime they must be put into whole cotton bags tied securely so that no mothmillers can enter and placed for a shorttime in a warm oven to dry thoroughlyIf hens are scalded before picking thefeathers can be dried in a tin pan in amoderately warm stove oven Removeall bits of skinas they produce an unpleasant odor hard to get rid of Feathers well cleaned answer very well forbolsters chair and soft

too much fluidwith the food particularly at the beginning of a meal Another factor incausing dyspepsia was the habit of eat-ing food in silence or without mirth andgood fellowship so necessary to

Royal Itis stronger and carries further butabove all things it is the only powderthat will endure the severe climaticchanges of the Arctic regionIt is for the same reasons that the US Government in its relief expeditionsand Peary the famous Arctic travelerhave carried the Royal Baking PowderexclusivelyThe Royal Baking Powder will notcake nor lose its strength either onboard ship or in damp climates and isthe most hightly concentrated and efficient of leavening agents Hence it isindispensable to every Alaskan outfitIt can be had of any of the trading companies in Alaska but should the
