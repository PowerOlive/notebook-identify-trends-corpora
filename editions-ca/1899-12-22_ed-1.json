There is only one cure for Contagious
Blood Poison the disease which has
xoinpletely baffled the doctors They
are totally unable to cure it and direct
their efforts toward bottling the poison
up in the blood and concealing it from
view S S S cures the disease posi
tively and permanently by forcing out
very trace of the taint
I w9 afflicted with a terrible blood disease
rhich was in spots at first but afterwards
ScjTk jJ
spread all over my body
These soon broke out into
sores and it is easy to
imagine the suffering I
endured Before I be
came convinced that the
doctors could do no good
I had spent a hundred
dollars which was really
thrown away I then
tried various patent
medicines but they did
not reach the disease
When I had finished my
first bottle of 8 S 8 I
was greatly improved
and was delighted with
the result The large red splotches on my
3hest began to grow paler and smaller and
before long disappeared entirely I regained
my lost weight became stronger and my
i petite greatly improved I was soon entirely
well and my skin as clear as a piece or glass
