ROYAL
Baking Powder
Economy
The manufacturers of Royal Bak
ing Powder have always declined
to produce a cheap baking powder
at the sacrifice of quality.
Royal Baking Powder is made from
pure grape cream of tartar, and is
the embodiment of all the excellence
possible to be attained in the high
est class baking powder
Royal' Baking Powder costs only a
fair price, and is more economical
at its price than any other leavening
.agent, because of the superlative
quality and absolute wholesomeness
of the food it makes.
Mixtures made in imitation of baking powders, but containing alum,
are frequently distributed from door to door, or given away in grocery
stores. Such mixtures are dangerous to use in food. In England,
France, Germany and some sections of the United States their sale is
prohibited by lav. Alurn is a dangerous mineral acid, and all
physicians condemn baking powders containing it.

The Wisest
Woman
When she buys Furniture asks
a lot of questions. She wants
to know all the "why's" and
"wherefore's" of everything.
And she isn't satisfied until she
is positive sure that the artic le
she chooses represents the
highest attainable point of
Furniture excellence.
Such a person would be sure to
find HERE mucb to please her.
Not only would she find styles.
, that would appeal to her by
reason of their novelty or
"differentness."
But she would also find that
such things aren't necessarily costly.
- We invite you particular people.
