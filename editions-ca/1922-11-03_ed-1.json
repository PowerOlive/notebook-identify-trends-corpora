PATHE REVIEW
SAYS THE CANDIDATE
"I have nothing to say against
ray opponent," said the candidate,
as he rose and cleared his throat,
"only this: . He is a liar and the
truth isn't in him.r He may not be
dishonest, but he thinks dishonestly.
I don't wauft ta prejudice this audi
ence against him at all, but he is a
blackleg, a second-story man, a .bur
glar, a bootlegger and a bum. Now.
of course, you mustn't think that I
have anything against this man and
I don't want to plant any false im
pressions in your mind, but I hap
pen to know that he is a forger, a
blackmailer, a receiver of bribes, a
wife-beater, an incendiary and a
stick-up man. All this, fyou may
say, is not to his credit. Well, per
haps not exactly to his credit, but
do not judge him too harshly by
what I have said. You may have
thought well of him, but I am in a
position to prove that he is a crook,
a dope, a booze-fighter, an embez
zler, a tax dodger and a gunman.
He would carry his grandmother up
nine flights of stairs and throw her
put the window for a quarter of a
dollar. Outside of that he is proba
bly all right, and having proved to
you vjthe solution of the great' prob
lems, that confront us and pointing
the way to better things, bid you
one and all, good night."
WOULD SURPRISE THE OLD
LADY, SURE!
A farmer in the cotton belt had a
reputation for never wearing good
clothes. His wife was continually
reproaching him for his negligenpe.
With the maturing of his crop he
journeyed to the city with the "first
bale." The bale brought ten cents
per pound more than he had ex
pected and he decided to surprise
the "old lady."
He went to a nearby furnishing
store and purchased a complete and
shining new outfit. Instead of put
ting them on in the store he placed
them under the wagon seat and be
gan the homeward journey.
When about one mile from the
farm he stopped by a creek, stepped
behind a large clump of shrubbery
and proceeded to take off his
clothes, at the same time throwing
them into the creek. They were
carried away by the current.
Turning to his wagon, naked as
Adam, he found that some one had
stolen the entire outfit, from shoes
to hat.
"Giddap, Bill!" said he, jumping
into the wagon. "We'll surprise tlm
old lady, anyway!" ;
