The season is scheduled to continue

the race includes such stars, as the
Kentucky champion, Kenneth 'D. Al

the strength of a series of startling
performances, and Johren will bea
staunchly supported second choice.

To the Subordinate Lodges of Ken
tucky: The government is offering for sale
to the people of the United States
during the year 1918 an issue of
Thrift Stamps and War Savings Cer
tificates, the purpose of which is to
raise funds to assist in financing, the
war, and to render it possible that
every man, woman and child in the
cation may do their part in bringing
the war to a successful termination.
For the purpose of selling these
Stamps, War Savings Societies
are being organized throughout the
State, and in each county there is a
Chairman who will be glad to furnish
all necessary information.
I desire to urge upon the Masons
of Kentucky the importance of buy
ing these Stamps and doing every
thing possible to cause others to buy
them. Our country is to-day facing
the greatest struggle of its exist
ence and it is ihe immediate duty of
every Mason to assist in every way
possible. I, therefore, request that
this communication be read in each
of the Subordinate Lodges and that,
wherever possible, these Societies be
organized.
. .Let every Mason in Kentucky buy
War Savings Stamps.
