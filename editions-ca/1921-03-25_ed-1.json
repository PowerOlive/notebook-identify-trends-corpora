Rev. Dr. J. B. Kendall, noted
evangelist and lecturer, will begin
a month's meeting in Millersburg

sisted by Lon D. Parker, noted as an
accomplished musician and vocalist,

services at each meeting.
A small blaze was discoverad
on the roof of the residence of Dr.
W. G. Dailey, Wednesday, about
noon. The loss was but small, fully
covered by insurance. The fire is
supposed to have originated from
sparks from the kitchen chimney.
The blaze was discovered in the
roof near the dining room chimney.
There was no fire, however, in the
dining roojoi.
The evangelistic meetings con
ducted by Herbert Yeuell at the
Christian church are attracting un
usually large audiences and wide
interest, both in Mr. Yeuell as an
evangelist, and the character of his
sermons and addresses. The ser
vices at the Christian church havo
been well attended since the begin
ning, and a record-breaking audi
ence attended the service at the
Methodist church Sunday night. Mr.
Yeuell's lecture on "Quo Vadis"
was so dramatically told, and the
illustrations thrown from powerful
machines upon the screen were so
beautiful as to .bring forth favora
ble copnment from the entire commu
nity. Friday night, at the Metho
dist church, Mr. Yeuell will give
his world-famous lecture on the
"Passion Play," as seen by him in
Oberammergau. This lecture will
have to be seen to be fully appreci
ated, as it can scarcely be described
on paper. It has never failed to at
tract large crowds of people. He
will also give his lecture, "Ben Hur,'
at a later date, full announcement
of which will be made.
The protracted meeting which
has been in progress at the Chris
tian church, for the past two weeks,
continues to grow in interest. Elder
Yeuell is an earnest speaker, and
-his sermons are growing in force.
He has captivated the Millersburg
people, beginning with last Sunday
night. The services through the
remainder of the meeting, will be
