states that an agent of abig- combination of English capitalistsis now en route to England bearing1with him options on all the mines andthe best coal lands in the section named and that if his report is satisfactory to his employers as it doubtlesswill be deals will be closed with thepresent owners at once The agenthas been at work securing the optionsfor some time past but for variousreasons has

Spanish Mission Considered at thoCublaec Meeting Failure of thepublican aucus to Ace on the Hawaiian Treaty Causes CommentWashington June 9 Assistant Secretary Day said Tuesday that the report of Consul General Lee upon theresults of the investigation made inHavana in the Ruiz case had not yetbeen received at the state departmentConsequently it was not possible tolearn whether the publications purporting to be copies of the reportwere accurate Assuming howeverthat the consul generals conclusionsare correctly set forth in briefthat Ruiz died while in jail inviolation of his treaty rights thequestion of the largest importance iswhat shall be the next step The wifeof Ruiz has filed with the departmenta claim for 150000 for the death ofher husband The Spanish contentionhas been that he was not killed andthat he was not treated harshly GenLees inquiry is understood to havefailed to bring out the truth on thesepoints but his statement on anothernamely that of his confinement inviolation of treaty rights appears tomake the first two points non-essentialand to leave the case resting onthe broad claim that in confining DrRuiz for more than 72 hours withoutpermitting him to communicate withhis friends or trying him the Spanishofficials in Cuba have assumed full responsibility for the results of that extra confinement The fact being established that Dr Ruiz kept up his citizenship by registering himself at Americanconsulates in Cuba from time to timeas required by regulations is taken asan offset against the claim that bycontinuous residence in Cuba for nearly 20 years he had forfeited his rightsas an American citizen so it is surmisedthat the next step in the case willbe the presentation of a claim againstthe Spanish government in behalf ofthe family of the Tictim of this illegalimprisonmentThe cabinet meeting Tuesday lastedlonger than usual The Cuban situation was discussed in a general waybut the most important subject presented was the Spanish mission

Carolina Martin ot Virginia Rawlins of Utah and WhiteOn the other hand Mr Carter republicanand Messrs Cannon and Mantle silver republicans voted for the Vest motion Followingthis a vote to substitute the Wilson lumberschedule was defeated 21 37 and the schedulewas agreed to as reported The debate preceding the vote was at times very strongowing to the political lines A general discussion of the future programme on the billoccurred before the senate adjourned It ledto a statement by Mr Allison in charge ofthe bill that the committee probably wouldsubmit amendments to the sugar scheduleFor this reason he announced that the suyarschedule would be pass over Tuesday and thetobacco schedule taken upHouse The house was in session for anhour or two Monday and adjourned untilThursdayWashington June 9 Senate By the decisive vote of 42 to 19 the senate adopted theamendment to the tariff bill placing raw cotton the great product of the south on thedutiable list at 0 per cent ad valorem It isthe first time in the history of tariff legislation that a duty on cotton has been incorporated in a bilL The amendment was proposedby Mr Bacon dem Ga on his individual responsibility and without theapproval of the finance committee which thusfar has been requisite to the success of everyamendment except a minor one which wentthrough by default The s mendmen led to aspirited debaie democratic senators disclosing a wide differeaceiof views and at times exchanging sharp personal criticisms On thefinal vote six democrats Bacon and Clay GaMcEnery La McLaurin and Tillman SC and Rawlins Utah voted with the repubicans for the Bacon amendment while thenegative vote was solidly democratic with oreexceptionKyle populist The debate oncotton took up the mo3t of the day Earlyin the day the sugar schedule was passed overand the agricultural schedule was taken upThe paragraph on cattle went over but thebalance of the agricultural schedule up toand including paragraph 228 was agreed to asreported all amendments except that of MrBacons being rejectedWashington June 10 Senate The senate had a period of tariff speeches Wednesdayand as a result little progress was made onthe bill Mr Rawlins Utah and Mr MillsTex discussed the democratic attitude onthe tariff from their respective standpointsMr Rawlins was a member of the platformcommittee of the Chicago convention and proposed the tariff plank which was adopted Heheld that the vote he and several other democratic senators had cast for duties on cottonand other agricultural products was justifiedby the platform and by the traditions of theparty Mr Mills severely arraigned the billus a class measure designed to buildup a vastfund for distribution among the beneficiariesof the bill and at the expense of the forgotten man the tax payer He indirectly criticised those democratic senators who voted forthe amendments to the bill putting a tax oncotton and other articles contendingthat their course was a radical departure from the tenets of democracy Later in the day Mr CannonUtah proposed an amendment placing anexport bounty on agricultural products Hespoke two hours on the need of giving thefarmer a share of the benefits of the tariffMr Butler ST C also spoke in favor of giving the farmer equal benefits with otherclasses under the bilL Only half a page ofthe bill covering four brief and comparatively unimportant paragraphs 229 to 233 werodisposed of during the day The session willbegin at 11 a m ThursdayifrviA TRAMPAttempts to Assault a Highly Respectable Tjtly at WilliHmburgBat a via O June 10

along the Tugalooroad into the gathering darknessSoon after nightfall the rain ceasedand the wind died away For the firsttime since he had turned in the nightbefore Lambert bethought him of thelantern he had purposed buying evenif he had to send to Cohens on a Sunday Burns sent some candles overfrom the company stores and the youngGerman striker set two of themalight in his tent with empty whiskybottles off which he had deferentiallywashed the labels as candlesticksOne thought led to another The proposed purchase reminded Lambert thatall the money in his possession was nowthe 20 bill borrowed of Close and thisreminded him that he wanted five dollars in small currency shinplastersas the miniature greenbacks werecalled at the time Since hearing Murphys story he better understood thestraits to -which his neighbors were reduced and he had determined that theaid he had proffered in one way shoulddespite madames high spirited rejection be rendered in anotherAt eight oclock he had secured theamount he needed through the goodoffices of the first sergeant and he waswondering how soon he might expectthe visit of Col Scroggs and what couldbe its purpose when all of a suddenthe

covered with long furthat their bodies can hardly be seenjThe bear is worshiped by them as a godand it is the ceremonial pertaining tothis cult that is described as so remarkableThey have good reason to respectthe bear of Yezo which is a huge andferocious animal closely resemblingthe American grizzly It does not hesitate to attack man and when hungryit sometimes enters dwellings in searchof food On the other hand the hairypeople are brave hunters and thoughpossessing no better weapons thanbows and arrows they do not hesitateto assail the brute The arrows arepoisoned and a mere puncture of theskin is so fatal that bruin will surelyfall dead before he can run 200 yardsThis poison is prepared from youngroots of the aconite plant Ordinarilythe hairy people use it for set bows inthe woods When a bear comes alongand steps on a cotd an arrow is released and enters the flesh of the animal In parts of Yezo the forests aredangerous to travelers by reason ofthese set bows Bears are extraordinarily numerous onthe island and theyfiirnish clothing as well as food to theinhabitants Bear gall too is greatlyprized as a medicineThus the- hairy people regard bruinwith the highest respect giving him apliice of honor in their pantheon Topropitiate him and to atone for havingprtbtimbortant feature of which oddlyenough is the sacrifice of a young bearThiire is eating and drinking

crushing the poor beast to deathMeanwhile the women dance aroundwith lamentations striking the men tomanifest their indignation at suchcruelty 1 Finally the body of the victim is laiol on a mat near

to the vest that stretched awayibaek J dont know how niany milesHire and there the little openings on-the side of West Hill log houses were- still to be seen and the folks living inthem were sometimes pretty primih eThe iJunnings were probably themost nb account of the lot They livedina little shanty old llufe had knocked- together out of slabs given to him by-lithe sawmill boss They had only a lit-fcle patch of ground and they lived onvhatthey raised the fish they caughtand what they trapped and shot Theydiclirt steal as I know of but they wereall mortal shiftless and young Hufewas worse

never comes near the estate hadjust put the place in a managers handsrTnei moved away with his family Now3titty was a real sensible go aheadigirl She knew the Sylvesters were asgood as anjbody round the Cornersif not a le etle better and she tried toHive up to the family reputation in allrvays When a girl her mother hadleen famous for the work she couldlo and Kitty was not a bit behindiEvery morning in the winter she wasnp early and got breakfast by candle-light All day long she wove carpetor quilted comforters ov spun stocking yarn or did something else thatcounted Every morning in the summer she was up with the sun andjevery day when it went down she had-churned and worked more butter orpnade more cheese or in some other way-done more work than any woman anyvhere around could do And she was thesavingest girl in the county Everybody said the was the smartest youngwoman going and naturally she wasconsidered a highly desirable catchBui she held herself mighty shy ofthem all for awhile and it was regularlygKen out -that no young man need everthink of keeping- company with KittySylvester who wasnt fully her matchTioth at working and saving So whenit was uoised about that young Bufe of- all the world had got him a pair of fine- boots a ruffled shirt doeskin jjantaloons and a broadcloth coat and hadbegun to shine up to Kitty there was ageueral uproar Folks couldnt believeit at first but it wasnt anywhere nearas hard to swallow as what came after-tvvardYou see the out giving that had beenjnade about the kind of chap Kittysjiusband would have to be had siftedthe yomigf eliows out a whole lot Most5 them were willing to work and willing to save and they all admired Kittys for she was as good looking as she wasindustrious and frugal but her standard was so high it scared the boys andleaux got to be mighty seldom on theestateNow as it turned out Shiftless Kufethought more of Kitty than any of the- others and at the very beginning sheg ave him a little encouragement Notinueh to be sure but enough to reformhim completely He wis naturallyirijrlitvbiSbashful when he called at thehouse all fixed up i clothes hewasnt used to and Kit ty at first pre-tended she didnt understand that heliad come to sec herril call my father she said Per-ljnps lyou want to talk about cutting-some cordwoodNo said itufe directly I want tojknow if 1 can keep

idea flashed through her mind-But j youll eut cordwood a wholeyeai every day but Stinday andyou may come and see me justonce Here comes father and youdbetter make arrangements to cut for3iim on

keptperfect silence till her father had finished Then she readhed out and tookKufes big soft paw in her own smallhand a hand that was calloused withhard work in spite of its littlenessMr Dunning she said Ihopejoullkeep your bargain faithfully as I shallkeep mine After you have worked hardfor a year you may come and see meonce Whether you may come again ornot will depend on yourself Goodevening Mr DunningNobody had ever called Shiftless KufeMr Dunning before and the title scaredhim far more than the notion of working every day for 12 long months Fromthe time he left the big house that nighthe was fit to drop the title shiftlessNext morning as soon as it was lightthe sharp ring of his ax was heardacross the valley biting out the chipsas he chopped down the first tree of hisyear long stent Long before noon thatday his big pulpy hands were blisteredand swollen and by sundown they werea sight to behold That night his mother cried over them and urged him to stopi 1-- rm --- V -THE

morning to night echoing acrossthe valley became as music in her earsand that the light of his candle shining through the trees in the morningsand the evenings was delight -to hereyes At last the long winter with itscold its storms and its darkness woreaway the spring passed and the summer with its heat came onNow Rufell weaken said the loafrers about the store Its all right towork hard when its cold and the airis bracings but hell let up in the hotweather sureBut they were wrong All throughthe heated term Kufes ax gave noisynotice that he was still working andwhen the fall began it wtts still bitingout chips and splitting up lengths Atlast the 2ear was nearly up and oldSylvester had begun to ask himselfwhether he had not made an exceedingly bad bargain after all For Kitty wasplainly much interested in the patientlover who had toiled so long and sosteadily for the privilege of calling onher just once and it might be theoid man reasoned that she would allowhim to call the second time tmd perhaps a third and perhaps But thethought was too awf ul to entertain andthe old man strove to dismiss it Failing in that he questioned the girl whorefused to answer satisfactorily and thetwo had a quarrel in which Mrsvester joined taking Kittys part mostvigorouslyOn the last day of the stipulated 12months Shiftless Kufe went to his workearly and began with quick eagerstrokes to cut a big hickory He hadbecome an expert axman by this timeand the sun was not yet high in thesky when the big- tree came down witha crash It so happened that I wasover in the big- woods that day with aneighbor looking at the timber Weheard the tree fall and at the sametime a scream as if a strong man werein mortal agony In a hurry I ran inthe direction of the sound guided byf XI I IA er Tn P vtwL - WHE HEARD WHAT HE WANTED TO HEARthinking about the proud stuck upgirl on the other side of the valleyThe idear muttered the old womanbetween whiffs at her clay pipe whileshe dressed Shiftless Kufes

youd make a fool of yourself for no conceited Sylvester girlTo this and much more of the samesort both from his father and hismother Shiftless Kufe made no replybut while yet the next morning wasgray tne souna 01 111s ousy ax wasiagain wafted across the valley and thiscontinued to the going down of the sunAnd so it went on day after day allrthe fall and through the winter Nomatter how deep the snow or howstormy the weather Kufe toiled on unceasingly When the days were shortest in the middle of the winter hesometimes began before daybreak andworked after dark splitting thelengths he had chopped from thefelled trees into four foot wood bythe light of a tallow dip stuck into a tinlantern of the pattern so common whenthe Corners was new but now rarelyseenBefore spring folks got to going bj7Kufes ax and lantern in beginningand leaving off work morning andnights the same as they go by the bigtannery whistle down the valley nowand nobody who began work as earlyas Kufe did and worked till Kufes lantern was out at night was countedlazyAnd Kufe did more than chop cordwood that winter He learned to readand this both his mother andhis fatherconsidered a far more ridiklis proceeding Yet more he went to meeting every Sunday as regularly -as themost pious and thrifty of the wholeneighborhood Not thathe became specially religious so far as I know but bygoing to meeting he could get a glimpseor two every Sunday of Kitty Sylvester and it was a little thing indeed forthe man who was chopping cordwooda whole year that he might make onecall on her to listen to a sermon oncea week so that he could sitf or a wbxieI hour under the same roof with herAlow moans that followed the shriekThere pinned under a branch of thefallen tree lay Shiftless Kufe badlycrushed and barely conscious For thefirst time in the entire year he had miscalculated in felling his tree As quickly as we could my neighbor and I cutaway the branch and released theyoung man Then wc got together astretcher of boughs on which we proposed to carry him home As we liftedhim he opened his eyes -I wish youd take me over to Sly-vesters first he said faintly Iwantto call on his daughter She said Imight come to night and so did herfather and maybe if you take mehome before I go there I wont be ableto see her to night at allSo we carried him across the flats tothe big house on the Barkley estatePart of the

another is oneThe operation should never be hurriedneither should it be done slovenly butthe milk should be drawn steadily as itliows Some cows have tender teatsand in milking too rapidly the operation is likety to be roughly done or iftoo much prolonged the cow gets irritated A cow that is naturally impatient and fretful does not like to submit to rough handling and if continued her disposition will soon be ruinedby such treatment The constant practice of being milked at regular timessoon impresses itself strongly upon herand she will readily submit withouttrouble As the udder becomes distended with milk it is a relief to her to haveit drawn out When the udders arefilled to the utmost with milk they become painful and if not relieved the jcow becomes restless If this happensfrequently or for any considerable timeit will cause the cow to dry up prematurely Milk the cow dry The lastportion pi the milk is the richest andbest In most cases neglect to milkregularly and clean is one cause of thecows drying up early of giving bloodymilk of garget and other evils Withkind treatment regularity in feedingand milking the cows will not only become gentle and stay so but will givemilk longer and the seasons productwill be larger A really good dairy cowis too valuable to be given anythingbut the best treatment St Louis RepublicENLARGING THE UDDERWhy the Best Vayiiiy Cows ArePound in Grass CountriesThe relaxation of the udder sack becomes so conspicuous in large milkersin some instances as to make itevidentthat the combined influence of expansion and weight tension together haveoverborne the natural contractive forceof the udder skin thus permanently enlarging the bag by destroying or atleast effectually suspending its naturaland necessaiy contractibility This result is clearly shown in the uncontracting bags of cows that are dried onlywith great difficulty and breed butseldom or fail 0 breed at I Theskin or sack of the udder is coursethinned down as yield and size of bagincreases mid this when carried to excess or effected too rapidly is doubtlessthe chief cause of loss of contractilepower in the udder skin Increase offeed being the cause of increased yieldeuch feed as adds to the bulk of bloodincreases yield and the size of th uddertogether This succulent feed likegrass and roots tends to enlarge theyield and the bag and in this will befound a reason for the largest miik2roducing cows being generally foundin the best natural grass localities inboth dry and humid climates Thusthe best grass countries in America door surely will with equal care andtraining produce the largest or bestyielding cows as a rule PlowmanHint for Orchard PlantersInexperienced orchard planter usually manifest an inclination to plant largetrees whereas an old and successfulplanter would probably select one ortwo-year-old trees The latter are wethink more certain to grow and oftenmake the more symmetrical appearance -for the

onlyeasy to plant a forest of 100 or d000 acresin a season but that it is also possibleto make it pay for the planter thatis It pays richly for ths owner laterHe is not inclined to glorify the European forestry as some of our Americans do If the Europeans had thetask of setting out forests upon ourtreeless western prairies they wouldfind it harder than maintaining a standing army fAmericans can however manage thetask because thejr do things by the largeThey cultivate by horse and steam powerinstead of by hand power The foresttrees should be planted in rows andtended like orchard trees In selectingtrees to plant those native to the locality if there are any should havefirst consideration as these will surelythrive best Many growths that do wellin the east are not suitable for the westWestern trees for western plantingis the motto because western trees arethe surest The green ash for instancemakes a line and vigorous growth inthe west while in the east the whiteash is far superior to it The chestnuthas been thoroughly tried in the westand has been found wanting The pinesand other conifers of the Pacific slopewill not grow at all in the prairie beltalthough the conifers of the Rockymountains willMr Douglas finds that 100 men canplait 1000 acres of forest in 30 daysThe ground should however have beenpreviously prepared Either autumn orspring will do for the planting Inspring the seeds of the trees shouldbe sown so soon as frost is out of theground By fall they will have made agrowth sufficient for transplanting tothe forest that is to be Forty acres willgrow seedlings enough to plant 1000acresThe farmers of Kansas have set outin the past few 3 ears 147340 acres offorest Among them are 11500 acres ofblack walnut 124SG acres of maple2037 acres of honey locust and 55553acres of cottonwood The Cottonwoodgrows the quickest and makes fuel forthe farmer sooner than any of the othershence his preference for it Land prepared as for corn planting will

AmericanGardeningXcw Facts About TreesIt seems to be well understood thata man is taller at morning than atnight but it has remained for a youngwoman named JFry to discover that theboughs of trees hang much higher inwinter than in summeil Doubtless thelow hang of the summer is because ofthe weight of the leaves but it is asurprising thing that the difference isso great as reported by Miss Fry Shefound that a certain branch of a mulberry tree wras 31 inches higher inDecember than in August and a weightof 35 pounds was not enough to makethe bough assume its August attitudein
