-single-tube tire it can be permanently
repaired by using the quick repair
astrip inside the tire See cut No 1

The Morgan Wright single tube
quick repair tire is guaranteed not
porous This is on account of the way
In which it is made Nearly every
arider has heard of tires that leak
like a sieve
Many tires rot because water gets
-into the fabric between the two layers
of rubber The Morgan Wright
fabric is proof against moisture
Everybody knows how comfortable
Morgan Wright tires are and yet
liow seldom they puncture This is
- due to the fabric
Ask any bicycle dealer whether
mother tires last as long as Morgan
Wright tires Ask also what the
IMorgan Wright guarantee means
XMorgan Wright tires are repaired
Tree of charge at the factory in
Chicago or at any of the Morgan
Wright free repair shops located in

It has a tack or nail in it may

Gave Back
My Health
There is no reason for being despondent
and considering diseases of the blood
incurable simply because the treatment
of physicians and many so called blood
remedies fail to effect a cure Though
it is naturally disheartening to the suf
ferer who faithfully takes the prescribed
treatment of the physicians often at the
expense of hundreds of dollars to find
himself no better as time goes
by still a cure will result from the right
remedy SSS no matter what other
treatment has failed
The reason that SSS Swifts Spe
cific has so successfully cured even the
worst cases after other treatment had
been tried In vain is that it is the only
remedy which forces the poison from
the blood and permanently eliminates
it from the system which is the only
correct principle of curing the disease
Mercurial remedies bottle up the poison
and tear down the system while SSS
forces out the poison and builds up and
adds- strength and vigor to the entire
system It is natures remedy and con
tains no harmful ingredient
Mr Charles Glenn of 1563 Dudley St
Cincinnati is one of the many who
constantly praise S for giving him
back his health He says
From childhood I was afflicted with
a terrible blood disease and have
taken almost every blood remedy on the
market but my case was deepseated
and one by one they failed The large
red blotches increased in size and num
ber and soon covered my entire body
My parents had me treated by a num
ber of physicians but the disease was
too much for them and after their tem
porary relief was over I found myself
growing steadily worse Thus I grew
into manhood handicapped by a terrible
disease and having tried so many reme
dies without relief when a friend urged
me to take SS S I had little faith -in any
medicine I was happy to find however
that I had at last gotten the right remedy
for one bottle of SSS did me so much
good that I soon had hopes of being cured
I continued the remedy and was cured
completely the unsightly spots soon
disappeared leaving my skin perfectly
clear My general health was also built
up and I am robust and strong I be
lieve SSS will cure the worst case of
blood poison in the world v
SSS is a real blood remedy and will
cure the most obstinate cases of Cancer
Eczema Catarrh Scrofula Rheumatism
Contagious Blood Poison old sores
or any disease caused by impure blood

BANTAM IN THEllilY
ONLY ROOSTER IN GEOR3IA fgAT HAS
A TOMBSTONE OVLK HIS GRAVE
Enlisting at Culpoper Va HjfjfServod
Under Major Williams In MaartBattles
A Sentinel In a Troo How HejBetrayed
Jlin Nessmith Hfo
While we were camped near Cul
peper Court House in the fall qfl862
said Major Tom Williams ilhecame
acquainted with a family named Dow
dy Just before the battle of Culpeper I
paid a visit to the farm and found the
ladies in a panic preparing to flee They
set- before me such scant fare as they
had left and after I had eaten a hasty
luncheon Miss Mary Dowdy called to
me and led the way to the bade yard
There is the last of ourstock of
poultry said she pointing to a little
bantam cock that was strutting- about
the yard I havent the heart to kill
him because he is a net If vou want
him you can take him and dbas you
like wirh him
During the campaign of 1863 he of
ten sat on my shoulder through the
long weary marches and hurried re
treats and I shared my rations with
him One night we had reached the
flank of the enemys camp by a forced
march and lay down to sleep on our
arms expecting to be rousedat the
break of day for a sudden charge- J had
started off with General perched upon
my musket barrel and a sudden change
in the order of march had separated us
from the wagons so I placed the roost
er on the limb of a sapling above my
head while I lay down to snatch a few
minutes sleep
General did not utter a single cluck
in protest although he must have been
very hungry from long fasting but
quietly squatted on the branch while I
flung myself on the grass and leaves
and was soon fast asleep I was so
weary that I slept profoundly until I
was suddenly aroused by an unearthly
screech in my ear Eaising my head I
took in the whole situation at a glance
General had dropped down from his
perch and uttered a shrill crow right in
my ear which had awakened me and as
I opened my eyes I saw the flash of guns
as our pickets fired and in anihstant
fell back upon us where we lay The
Yankees had turned thetables oh us
and discovering our presence the sur
prising force became the surprised and
in ten minutes there was an unearthly
racket going on in that pine thicket
Eight and left of my position the
boys came out of cover and advanced
with yells and cheers moving cautious
ly and firing as they moved It had be
come sufficiently light for me to find
my few belongings and I soon recover
ed my hat and haversack which Xhad
forgotten to pick up in the hurry of the
first surprise and juAfc at that- time I
was saluted with a loud crow just above
my head and looking up I savGeneral
perched upon his limb he having flown
back there when the firing began and
with his head held on one side he was
sidling along the swaying branch crow
ing and clucking
In spite of the banging of the guns
and whistling of bullets General stuck
bravely to his perch and never fluttered
during the entire engagement When
I told the story in camp that night
Geiieral was the toast of the evening
and he was treated to all sorts of tid
bits in recognition of his gallantry
on the field of action
One morning however General
I played the camp detective in a most
alarming manner which came near
proving disastrous 1 j a fellow soldier of
another mess All foraging had been
strictly forbidden and no man was al
lowed to leave the ranks under the
heaviest penalty of military discipline
There was a fellow by the name of Jim
Nessmith who occupied a tent not far
from that of the captain of our compa
ny About 4 oclock the order was pass
ed along the lines fpr us to -prepare to
march
General was perched on the limb of
a bush near me while I sat munching
my hard tack and all of a sudden he
raised himself on his perch and crowed
lustily Of course no cock in hearing
could resist replying to such a challenge
and from within the tent occupied by
Jim Nessmith came the muffled crow of
an old rooster Jim made a grab at the
bag and succeeded in choking him off
but the noise had reached the ears of
some of the others and the captain be
came apprised of the fact that Jim had
been f onaging A hasty examination of
his tent disclosed the body of the big
rooster choked to death by Jim in his
anxiety to put a stop to his untimely
crowing
Jim was ordered under arrest pend
ing an investigation but just about that
time the order came to advance and we
moved forward and by sunrise we were
fighting and the unfortunate officer
who had ordered Jim to be placed un
der arrest was borne from the field a
corpse after the fight was over The af
fair was forgotten amid the stirring
scenes that followed
Seeing that the end was near I
found an opportunity to send General
to the rear and placing him in a cage
started him on the long journey to the
home of a nephew ii Georgia He had
not been long on the farm before he be
gan to pine and droop and the family
thought that he was disconsolate on ac
count of being separated from his com
rades This might have been all fancy
but he lived only a short time and
when he died my nephew and the boys
of the neighborhood gave him a regular
military funeral 7
I suppose that his is the only grave
of a rooster in Georgia The tiny stones
that mark his last resting place can be
seen on the old homestead -near Dalton
today On the headstoDe is rudely carv
ed the name General witli the date of
his death and the names of some of the
most important erigagements through
