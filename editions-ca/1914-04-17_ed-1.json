accomplised, but popular, a graduate
lof the M. F. C, a popular vocalist,
a devout member of the Christian
niiiirrh. a member of all of the
societies, and a prominent
tpllpP 1n the Sunday school. She is
I l,VW -- - ....
one of the most useful girls that lias
gone out of Mir midst in a long time,
and her place will be hard to fill. She
was the recipient of a multitude of
presents, handsome and costly. Mr.
Vaught is a member of the firm of
Vaught Bros., proprietors of one of
the largest automobile plants of Indi
anapolis. For years these brothers
were in the furniture business at
Parker, Ind., and they belong to one
of the best families of the Hoosier
State. They have made a success of
life and have acquired quite a fortune.
The wedding took place at 6 o'clock
in the main parlor of the new Gibson
Hotel, the room had been especially
decorated for the occasion, and the
hotel orchestra furnished the music.
The bridal chorus, Lohengrin, as they
entered the parlor and Mendolessons'

TTiiri pr Cossaboom diss up the
loving cup, which was thought to be
buried and compels R. M. Caldwell
to scratch his old bald head, smoke
another cigar, set up and take notice.
Several weelts ago the young people
of our little city, under the auspices
of the Ladies' Aid Society of the
Christian Church, put on a. two act
play at the opera house entitled,
"That Awful Aunt of Ours."
The opening of the second act was
a drinking scene and the writer in
critisizing the same in the Bourbon
News said that the only thing neces
sary to complete the scene was a
loving cup. The officers of the Chris
tian Church had presented a loving
cup to one of their retiring officers
last" November. The breezes after

Mr. Eastin is said to have been one
of the best Commanders Webb has
ever known, and the members of the

Elder Cossaboom says that if a K. P.
Lodge can present a loving cup to a
retiring Eminent Commander, the
officers of a church can do the same
for a retiring officer. The loving cup
is of threes fold significance, literal,

gives this definition the loving cup
Ts a large cup with two or
ihp.ndlfis filled with wine or
more
other ,
liquor to be passed among the guests
I at ceremonial banquets. The loving
cup is of ancient origin and we lind

when Richard Ccuer DeLion, widi

mgs it was frequently used with song
and minstrel and the King's 1001.
Agin we find it during the reign of
llenry 8th, when the several powers
met upon the cloth of gold to adjust
differences between them that had
long existed. The loving cup passes
now from the ceremonial banquets of
Kings and other rulers. It has been
the cup of distinction, both in Amer
ica and Europe for several hundred
vpars in military life. Brother Cossa
boom, perhaps, does not know that
the K. T. Lodge is the military Lodge
of Free Masonry, and that the pre
sentation of the loving cup in all
lodges and under all circumstances
where Knights do exist, is admissable.
Not only is this true, but until very
recently the loving cup has been used
literally, as well as emblematically,
in the K. T. Lodge. Upon banquet
occasions and in State, National and
International Conclaves. The loving
cup has passed about the board freely
of all ceremonial banquets until the

Brother Cossaboom by saying that it ,

omcers t-preseuu lu x "" w..
We give the facts for what they are
wortli. It is true it is emblematical
nf frMpnrishi'Tv hnwp.ver. a meaning is
one thing and its emblematical phase
another. Brother Cossaboom is a
theologian, and of course, does and
ought to know what is proper to give
on such occasions. But be it said to
the shame of the writer, who is a
fairly good judge of wine and liquor,
that whenever he loooks at one of
these cups he suddenly becomes
thirsty and begins spitting cotton.

If all the horses which are still eli
gible for the Kentucky Derby, to be
run at Louisville- on May 9, were to
start in that race, it would mean that
just about half a million dollars worth
of horseflesh would line up against
the barrier-on that memorable occa
sion. It is doubtful that ever before
in the history of the American turf
so much valuable- thoroughbred mate
rial was entered in one race as in this
event. Six horses entered in that
race alone have a value of $145,000,
