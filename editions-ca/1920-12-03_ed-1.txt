Brother Jas. T. Davis was ejectedTreasurer and served continuouslytmtil D363, when he was elected Aice-tjrrana ana continued-m tne cnair-oneyear, and then was reelected Treasurer to which he was successively reelected until 1905, wh,en he died. He,served as Treasurer for 59 years, and'to brother Davis must be given thecredit for the success of BourbonLodge.Bourbon Lodge has several otherrecords for which we should feelhighly honored. They have met everyMonday and never yet to this dayfailed to have a quorum.During this period there have beenfour wars in the United States, andBourbon Lodge was represented inevery one of them by one or morebrothers, (Mexican, Civil, SpanishAmerican and World War.) Duringthe Civil War (of 1861) the lodgecontinued to meet as before, and onaccount of danger met some timeswithout any, lights of any kind.They have a brother, (brother Geo.W. Davis, a brother of brother Jas.T. Davis,) who was' initiated inBourbon Lodge, February 7, 1851,making him an Odd Fellow 69 yearswe expect the oldest Odd Fellowin membership in Kentucky, if notthe oldest man who is an Odd' Fellowin Kentucky who is 94 years old, andtoday he wants the writer to comeand tell him how the lodge is doing.Bourbon Lodge is noted for itsbenevolence to the outside world. Ithas always been the first one to donate to the suffering, such as theJohnstown Flood, Chicago and Baltimore fires, Galveston Tidal,San Francisco earthquakes and fire,Dayton Ohio and Henderson (Ky.)floods, and other calamities that havem. naventes Air anfl Mrs. iteuDCU imuueneu in uue umtt:u. oiams in uicFord Offutt,' at the Lancaster Hotel, last fifty or more years, and duringcne world war contrioutea to tneRed Cross and all other calls andpurchased more War Bonds than anyother order in the city, and theyhave never yet sent any good causeaway empty-handed.As for her past toward theorphans and old folks homes; she hasalways subscribed more than anyother lodge toward the maintenanceand support of the Orphan Home; asfor the Old Folks' Home it was oneof her members who proposed theestablishment of the Old Folks' Homeand the resolution was offered bythe representative from BourbonLodge, at Grand Lodge meeting, atGeorgetown, 1907, and BourbonLodge gave 500.00 as a smarter forthe home which was twice as muchas ony other lodge in the State gave,and, through its individual members,subscribed for same cause four timesas much, or more than any, other.lodge in the State.Bourbon Lodge always" gives moreto the children of the Orphan's Homefor Thanksgiving and Christmasthan any other lodge in the State.For the " drive for the first$50,000.00, Bourbon Lodge was firstto respond as going over the top, andin the $500,000.00 Endowment Drive(while our quota was about $5,920,)Bourbon Lodge through its individualmembers (not any from lodge funds)$14,052.00, and we feel like we havesubscribed a larger percentage ofmembership pledges than any otherlodge in the state, while we rankseventh in the state regarding membership, and fourth as regarding thewealth. These records we should allfeel proud of.Bourbon Lodge always remembersher widows by nice remembeurancesevery Christmas.Now, brothers, while there are otherrecords we could speak of, butwe willtop and will try and do better in thefuture and live closer to the threecardinal princiles ' of the order,Friendship, Love and Truth, and letus strife to make the world better tolive in, and keep the banner of oldBourbon Lodge, Nr. 23, always unfurled and flying to the breezes, trying to do unto 'others as we wo.uldhave them do unto us, and when theGrand Master above calls oh us toanswer the last summons then it mayDe saia 01 us as uaa mellows: asyou have been faithful pver a fewthings I will make you ruler overmany."E.

Ohio,"November 30, 1920."L. Obeidorfer,"Paris, Ky."My Dear Mr. Oberdorfer:"I have been getting such depressing reports as to conditions in thetobacco section, that I was amazedand immensely pleased to-day tolearn that experts believe your localtobacco growers will get at leasttwice as much for this year's crop asthey got for their tobjacco last year."My informant is Mr. H. C.Crouse, representative of the UnitedStates Tobacco Journal. He has madean exhaustive study of conditions,and in the course of his investigation,, ban consulted with the bestknown experts, both growers andbuyei s."He told me to-day that while thedark grades marketed around Hopkinsville will undoubtedly bell atvery low figures due to the presentforeign exchange rates (mostNof thisgrade goes to Southern Europe)the Burley markets will handle oneof the moLt valuable crops everraised. Experts believe that aboattwo hundred and twenty-five millionnounds. or two-thirds of the entirecrop, will be the highest grades of"bright cigarette tobacco, the kindmost in demand now. Tobacco of thisgrade averaged eighty cents to a dollar a pound last year, and in someinstances reached the high level ofdollar twenty-six cents."Last year only about twenty percent, of the crop was of the bestgKade. This year it will run sixtyto seventy per cent, of the .crop. TheI Blue Gras farmer will prooabiy1 Kinrtat cVimif tTivpa times as TTljlchlliailV&l' ttUWUI. lAAh-WW .good leaf as he did last year.
