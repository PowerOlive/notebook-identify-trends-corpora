The Green-Glenn Insurance Law,;
passed by the last Kentucky Legisla
ture and signed by Governor Mc
Creary, was Friday declared amcon
stitutional by Judge Robert L. Stout,
who is presiding over the June term
of the Bourbon Circuit Court.
B. Ryan, the insurance companies'
attorneys, Clem Wheeler, Frank
Drake and R. G. Gordon, came to
Paris Friday morning from Frankfort
and made application to Judge Stout
for a restraining order. The Judge
decided that the law was unconstitu
tional and made the injunction perma
nent.
The injunction is against Matt Clay,
State Insurance Commissioner; James
B. McCreary, Governor of Kentucky;
Henry M. Bosworth, Auditor, and
Ruby Laffoon, attorney for the Insur
ance Department, enjoining them
from carrying into effect the provis
ions of the Glenn-Green Insurance
Act, passed by the last Legislature.
This order was sought under an
agreed case which was presented to
Judge Stout by" the attorneys for the
plaintiffs. The defendants are repre
sented by the Attorney General's
office, but they were not present.
Judge Stout in granting the in
junction asked for, held that the
Glenn-Green bill was unconstitutional
because of various requirements for
the passage of bills by the Legislature
basing his opinion upon a decision of
the Court of Appeals of Kentucky,
written by Judge Carroll and render
ed on May '28, 1914, in the case of the
Board of Prison Commissioners vs.
Spenser.
The asking for this injunction was
one of the steps in the. recent agree
ment effected at a conference at Lou
isville on June 10 between represen
tatives of the insurance companies
and the State officials, whereby it is
expected to settle the insurance
troubles and' bring back to the State
the companies which withdrew upon
the passage of the Glenn-Green bill.
The case will be carried at once
before the Court of Appeals and a de
cision will probably be rendered with
in a short time.
Local agents of the companies that
withdrew from the State have been
notified to resume writing insurance.

LONG LITIGATION LIKELY.
FRANKFORT, KY., June 15. Pro
longed litigation is the outlook for the
suit attacking the Glenn-Greene insur
ance law. Not only must final ad
judication be had in the Franklin Cir
cuit Court followed by appeal to the
Court of Appeals, but a question in
volving the Federal constitution, uni
formity of taxation raised in the suit,
may carry it into the Federal courts.
There is little liklihood of the end
being reached before the commission
finishes its work of investigating the
situation and reports to the 1926 Gen
eral Assembly.

JOHN GUND WINS
THE LATONIA DER3Y.
A Baker & Co.'& John Gund ac
counted for the thirty-second running
of the Latonia Derby, winning" from
his stable companion, Constant, with
Dr. Samuel bringing up in third place.
Bronzewing, the favorite, was fourth,
and Casuarina, the early pacemaker,
landed a beaten last.
The winner was handled by Neylon,
who used superb judgement and sent
his mount into the lead when Cas
uarina veakened, never relinquishing
it. Gov. Gray's track record of
2:30 2-5 was equaled. The running o
the race bore out the critic's conten
tion that John Gund would win han
dily that afternoon because of his
more superb form. Bronzewing, seem
ingly sore and stiff, cameb ack to the
scales practically broken down.
Waterbass, the property of Turney
Bros., of Paris, was defeated for the
$20,000 International Derby at Mon
treal, Saturday, by David Craig. Wa
terbass dashed to the front and set a
dazzling pace. Luke McLuke finish
ed with a rush and beat Waterbass
out three parts of a length for third
place.
