In Bad Fix
."I had a mishap at the age of 41, which left me in bad
fix," writes Mrs. Georgia Usher, of Conyers, Ga.
"I was unconscious for three days, and after that I
would have fainting spells, dizziness, nervousness, sick
headache, heart palpitation and many strange feelings.
"I suffered greatly with ailments due to the change of
life and had 3 doctors, but they did no good, so I concluded
to try Cardui.
Since taking Cardui, I am .so much better and can do
all my housework."
