This puzzlement hasbeen increasing for- thirtv-three 'months or thereabouts, since the outbreak of the European war, in fact.Some venture the opinion that thewar operations are affecting theweather conditions, while others arejust as positive that cannon Are hasnothing to do with the situation.Those holding to the first theoryargue that if rainy, stormy weatherfollowed months after explosions ofthe volcanoes of Mt. Pele, Mt. Kat-,mai and Krakatoa, the thirty-threemonths of almost continuous cannonading in Mesopotamia, Palestine,Turkey, Russia, the Balkans, Austriaand France musft have the same consequences as that ascribed to the volcaoes the freeing of clouds ofdust-particles to be carried 'into theupper air currents and disarrangingthenr as well as the lower atmosrphere. If they are right, then thewar operations by creating freakweather are responsible fpr the badcrop conditions all over the world.For some days recently the skies oflower Michigan were darkened andthe sun shone with a sickly glarethrough the rifts. Some have'blamedforest fires in Wexford, Missaukee,Iron and Gogotyc counties for thiscondition, recalling the palls ofsmoke which for days overhung theMichigan peninsula during the forestfire periods of 1871 and 1881. Thisexplanation, if true, would bolster upthe theories of those wlib think theEuropean war is wrecking the world'sw eather and crops.Of two schools of thought in theUnited States weather bureau onehas repudiated with scorn the ideathat cannon fire in Europe can affect weather in America or anywhere else. But the layman, mindful of the mistaken predictions of theweathermen and fact that weatherprognostication is a wonderfully inexact science, goes right on speculating on what effect an armisticewauld have on the weather.

"Using the Dimmers."We've a complaint from a Bourboncounty reader that is deserving of attention, hecause it is justified, and;we feel sure that many will, oncetheir attention is called to it, agreefully with the complainant andact accordingly... The reader referred to declares"Jthat too many machines traversingvthe rural districts and passingthrough the smaller towns are eith--ernot equipped with dimmers for"their lights, or, if they have such attachment, it is not properly used.Many of them are high-power elec,tVic lights and people driving in approaching vehicles are frequentlyforced to shield their eyes from theglare with their arms and takechances on their horse straying tooifar off the side of the road or notgetting out far enough to clear theautos.

One of its most inspiringprinciples is that the man who makesa failure on one job is likely to makea success of the job of an opposingtype, assuming, of course, that hefails in the face of real effort. Thisis the significance of failure: Itpoints the way to an occupationwhich means success. Failure to awilling man is merely misplacementon his job. Failure at one job is nota calamity; it is an indication. Every failure is a guidepost to success."Fortunately some employers are-beginning to understand this. Whena man fails in one job they shift himto another of an opposite type. Andif the worker is not lazy or dishonest he usually succeeds. Jo foremanshould be allowed to discharge aman. He should merely report to acentral office that the mantis notsuccessful on his'particular kind ofwork. In another department he maybre.ak records. To fjre a man whohas failed at one job is poor business.The shifting of failures means themaking of success.""BUSINESS AS USUAL.""Business As Usual" should be thepatriotic slogan of every citizen ofParis and Bourbon county, for with acontinuation of the city's, county's.State's and Nation's business in theirregular and accustomed channels, wecan pay our war costs and still haveplenty left over to aid our Allies.The billions of dollars of money tobe expended in war preparations willbe put into circulation in our owncountry, and this in itself will createk new weal tli for use in the worldstruggle for humanity and relief fromoppression and Germanism. 'The one thing that might halt business now is an unpatriotic psychological feeling of panic and a false ideaof patriotic economy.Patriotic economy means the elimination of waste and extravagance.It means-the conservation of our foodproducts, our natural wealth, ourhealth, our energies, our labor, ourvery lives. It means putting moreefficiency into everything we do sothat each unit of money, energy andintelligence may accomplish the veryutmost.Patriotic economy does not meanthe lowering of America's standardof living, which would make us lessefficient physically and mentally, nationally and individually, and wouldkill the spirit and will to do the trulyself-sacrificing things to be done.Citizens of Paris and Bourboncounty, let's be patriots and do ourshare by keeping "Business AsUsual."FOR YOUR SCRAP BOOK.HIS JOB.(By Amelia Josephine Burr of theVigilantes.)"I didn't raise my boy to e asoldier -- iThe, nations ought to arbitrate, IBut I couldn't face my son if Imadehim leave undoneHis bit to help America to-day:Though I couldn't bear to think ofliim in battle,And it's terrible to trust him tothe sea,I'll give him wfth a will where hedoesn't have, to kill,Is there nothing for my boy andme?"There's a call for him that's loudereven minute;There's a hungry world that hecan help to feed.There's a fjglit without a gun thatis waiting for your sonWhere the enemy's the vermin andthe weed.If you didn't raise your boy to bea soldier,If you didn't raise your boy to be; a shirk.Here's a job for head and hand. send him out to till the land:What's the matter with a farmer's work?Amelia Josephine Burr.ADVANCE IN HOSPITAL X-RAY.The X-ray has become indispensable to the modern surgeon, and improvements are always being madeupon it. A recent one is a devicewhich, after revealing the location ofan injury or diseased spot enables thesurgeon to keep it in sight as heoperates. A frame work goingaround the surgeon's head Is fittedwith a fluoroscope an instrumentby, means of which objects revealedby the X-rays are made visible tothe human eye.

A, Qrr, Qlar-ence M.

Pennington, is also stationed.The Paris boys are greatly pleasedat the prospect of seeing active service and glad to be transferred fromthe routine ot the training stationSTILL BLIND!(Contributed.)It. is comfortable enough now tobe un-American, indifferent to ourour country's needs and even pro-'German.It is the rule now, not the exception, that those of us who are small Ifarmers or tradesmen in the MiddleWestern States have- become sodwarfed in mind and soul throughthe pursuit of material things, thatliberty, patriotism, and Americanism are only words.The attitude of many is "let theother fellow fight, give his life andhis money, it is no concern cf-mine."Perhaps it will take the severestsacrifice now or later to grow a suland spiritual understanding intothe bodies and minds of men intheMiddle-West.Perhaps it will take the sight ofyour own son crucified, when heshould have had the generous treatment of a prisoner of war. Or yourdaughter murdered when she shouldhave been protected as your ownfather and mother sold into slavery.But you will understand finallywhat patriotism means, just asFrance understands.Meanwhile Bourbon has slackedshamefully in -failing to. take hershare of the Liberty Bonds. She isthousands short, with only two daysto make good her deficit.That deficit will be made good bypatriotic men of Bourbon, but it is achance for many to show their patriotism instead of leaving it to afew.If you have not wholly forgottenthe heritage of your pioneer ancestors, if you can yet feel the impulseof liberty.-lpving Anglo-Saxon bloodstirring within your veins, and ifyou have a little money to sparefrom a hundred dollars up, call upyour bank and order your LibertyBonds to-day.BOURBON CROP CONDITIONSThe farmers and gardners of thecity and county have about come tothe conclusion that the most flourishing crop 'they have seen so far isthe weed crop, which has been growing much faster than anything elseduring the past week or two.Corn has been coming up very well,although a few farmers have beencompelled to plant some over again inlow places and on the hillsides wherethe recent rains have washed thembadly. Everybody on the farm hasbeen very busy, especially those whohave been engaged in setting out tobacco plants. A great deal of plowing has been done between the showers, which have been certainly numerous. Gardens are showing upwell, and nearly every truck farmer' jis seemingly contented with condlrtions, out noperui mere win oe moresunshine.The rampant creeks and branches,which have been the result of recentheavy rains, have gone down considerably in the past few days, but thereis much high water yet that is capable of doing damage. The farmertakes his supper quite late these days,l emaining at his. work until the lastray of daylight has left him,The harvesting of bluegrass seed,which is generally in progress aboutthis time of the year, has beengreatly retarded by the rainyweather. It is said that the crop willbe yery short this year. The shortage of the seed will cause a corresponding increase in price. For Augustdelivery $1, and in some instances$1.10 per bushel has been offered,:which indicates about sixty-five cents'from the stripper, uncleaned.'

It was announced that the steamsailing vessel, "Neptune," charteredrecently by the committee probablywould sail about July 1 from NovaScotia under command of CaptainRobert A. Bartlett, for Etha.Although the expedition has beenone of the costliest on record, it issaid that from a scientific viewpointthe result has fully justified the expenditure. While Admiral Perry believesEtha proved to be a mirage the McJtfillan party discovered six new islands, mapped and explored FindlayIsland and gathered geographical,botanical, archeologlcal and ethnological material of great importance.The message from McMillan, whichwas written about the middle of"February, was transmitted throughthe American minister at Copenhagen by Dr. Harrison J.

When Paul and hiscompanions, after the adventurousjourney in which they suffered shipwreck on the island of Malta, landed inItaly they found brethren In. Puteoll,now called Pozzuoli, near Naples, and"Were desired to tarry with themseven days ;" and then the .narrator ofthe journey says, "we went towardRome."Luke does not tell us by what roadthey traveled, but we can be sure thatit was by the great Appian way, already three hundred years old, whichwas built by Appius Claudius, aRoman censor, from Romero Capua,a point not very far from the portwhere the prisoners landed.From Capua to Rome was a distance of 125 miles. Paul and his companions probably walked the whole distance, but were met at the ThreeTaverns, 17 miles from Rome, andat Appli Forum, or the market ofAppius, ten miles from Rome, by delegations from the infant church inRome.This great highway was built ofhewn stones laid in cement, and averaged about 20 feet wide. Parts of theroad are still in excellent preservation. The Three Taverns is identified bysome ruins, which are pointed out tothe modern tourists as the remains ofthe station at which Paul was met byhis loving brethren from Rome, whohad received news of his comingprobably by the system of posts whichpenetrated to all parts of the empireand resembled the modern post office,and through the Acta DIurna, or public bulletins which were a prototypeof the modern newspaper.

It leadsus to say and do wrong tilings; itwarps our judgment and leads to injustice, unklndness and even cruelty,says a writer in the Milwaukee Journal. It paves the way for hatred andmalice. In proportion as we learn 'toclear our minds of prejudice we become better men and women; we winfriends and dissolve enmities; we aremore worthy of respect and confidence.No one wants to, be judged by falsestandards that prejudice" sets up. Beware of judging others in such light.Prejudice cramps the mind and theheart; it stands in the way of rightful growth of character.It Is wise to search your heart, andIf you find prejudice there to set aboutto root It out wholly. Do not be sureyou of all men are unprejudiced. Thatis the danger ; for prejudice is guardedby vanity. Seek to bejust in all things,small as well as great. In all the relations of life be sure "you are not judging another, not for his error but fromyour prejudice. For the worst thingabout this weakness is that it breedsinjustice and unklndness and malice.It hurts Innocent folk and makes no Jone happier.Csol.There .had just been a raflway collision in France a terrible wreck.

Everything about the Imperial Valley seems to have the dramatic quality; its story would makea good moving picture. In 1900 itwas a blistering desert where a buzzard could scarcely live. And thenthe government harnessed the Colorado River and the the desert -wasveined with irrigating canals andploughed and planted, and for thefirst time -since the primordial floodssubsided a tint of green and growingthings spread over the valley.Cotton arrived in 1906. It came inthe shape of a box of seed under theseat of a wagon driven by a Texashomesteader. He asked why theydidn't raise cotton thereabouts, andthey said because it wouldn't grow.And so being from Texas, which tosomething like Missouri, he plantedhis little st6re of cottonseed and itcame up and opened its snowy bollsto the wonderment of all beholders.Furthermore, the next year it cameup and bore again without anotherplanting.The Texan's little cottonfieldspread like a drop of butter on a hotpan. It clathed the bareness of thedesert in ite fleece. And it broughtto the men who owned the landmore hard iron dollars than everthey had seen before.

Sickness will decrease the national efficiency by justso much, whether it be among soldiers or noncombatants. Steps thatwill insure one against disease areamong the best forms of preparedness. Health of a nation at war -or atpeace depends in a large measureupon its food. A nation cannotthrive and be healthy unless it hasgood food and plenty of it. Themobilization of agricultural productsmus go hand and hand- with the mobilization of factories and munitions.Nearly half of 'the body buildingfood and 70 per cent, of the sustaining food on American tables isderiyed from grain, according to theLife Extension Institute. Thesegrains are to be the manufacturingindustries. The wanton destructionof food is as much of a traitorousact as the destruction of arms andammunition. In the last anaylsis, itis the well-fed nation that will prevail. The housewife must be economicalin the preparation of food and mustcook it with skill, so that meals willbe tasty and agreeable.Vaccination against typhoid andsmallpox are execellent preparednesssteps. It is estimated that withinthe past ten years Germany hassaved enough men from smallpox tooffset her terrible losses at Verdun.The death toll in this country frompreventable disease is far greaterthan any likely war losses. Fewermen were killed in the Civil Waron both sides than have died from typhoid fever alone in the UnitedStates, in the last ten years.Any effort that tends to reduce theinfant mortality rate will help repair the wastages of war.FOR YOUR SCRAP .BOOK.FOR FRANCE.The cheer she gave, the helpinghandWhile bugle calls are ringing clearFor legions to advance,Let all the war hosts life a cheerFor scarred and valiant France.To-day she stands with lifted hands,As erst of old we stoodAmid our torn and wasted landsAnd needing brotherhood.She saw our bitter plight and woe'And answered with a will;Now let our loyal legions showHow love remembers still.Oh, land beloved, let memory floodAnew the battle lineWhere alien valor 'tracked in bloodThe field of ' Brandywine!iPay What you owe to France, oh,land;That long uncancelled debt,The cheer she gave, the helpinghandRemember Lafayette!IMPROVED SHOW WINDOW.A novsl show window which hasthe advantage of being devoid ofglass reflections, thereby making itscontents" more readily visible, haslately been added to a Chicago shop.The-window curves inward nearlythree feet from a height of eight feetabove the floor.
