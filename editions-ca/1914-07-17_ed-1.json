The Pantagraph, of Bloomington,
111., has the following to say relative
to the late Mr. T. J. Vimont, a former
citizen of Millersburg: "Thomas J.
Vimont, a former prominent merchant,
expired at 5:15 p. m., July 6, at the
family home, 521 East Mulberry
Street, following a six-weeks' illness
with a complication of dropsy and
uraemic poison. Deceased was born
in Millersburg, Ky., May 5, 1841.
Here he grew to manhood. Several
years he spent attending Wisconsin
State University, at Madison. As a
young man he was a traveling man
for the Ely-Walker Dry Goods Com
pany, and spent several years engag
ed in business in St. Louis. On June
17, 1875, he was united in marriage to
Virginia M. Boyd, in St. Louis. To
this union were born three children,
Nellie, Florence and Bessie, all of
whom have passed away. Mrs. Vi
mont died January 26, 1896, in St.
Louis. Mr. Vimont came to Bloom
ington in 1897, and in partnership
with Mr. Koehn, conducted the Grand
Leader, a dry goods store, where the
E. M. Steele store is at present locat
ed. In the fire of 1900 the store was
destroyed, but Mr. Vimont started in
business again immediately after the
fire. Mr. Koehn retired when the
building was burned. March 14, 1900,
Mr. Vimont was united in marriage to
Mrs. Mabel Skinner, who, with one
daughter, Charlotte Vimont, survives.
He also leaves a sister, Miss Eliza
beth Vimont, at Millersburg, Ky., Mr.
Vimont continued to conduct the
Grand Leader in Bloomingon, part of
the time in partnership with Stephen
Hazel, until 1906, when he removed
to Paxton, where he conducted a simi
lar establishment until June 1, when
he was forced to sell his business on
account of ill health. It is at this
time that he returned to this city. Mr.
Vimont lias five brothers, Louis,
Waldermes, John, William and Mal
colm, and two sisters, Charlotte and
Mary, all of whom have preceded him
to the grave. Mr. Vimont was a
member of the International Bible
Stndents' Association. He was a man
of tried and true integrity and up
rightness. He was known through
out the State, where he traveled for
many years. He suffered business
reverses, but never once did he resort
to questionable business to recoup his
losses. He was a Christian of true
character. He made friends readily
and was a great favorite among chil

WAYSIDE WANDERERS BROUGHT
IN BY SHERIFF MARSHALL.
Partly disrobed and surrounded by
a dozen mangy dogs, two young wo
men, barefooted and apparently drug
ged, ar under the influence of liquor,
were found laying on the side ofthe
road, near Mr. C. C. Leer's place, on
the Maysville pike, yesterday after
noon. Two ladies passing in a buggy
made the discovery. They alighted
and endeavored to arouse the young
women, but could not do so. The
ladies covered the girls up the best
they could and coming to the city
notified the Sheriff's office.
Deputy Sheriff Marshall went to the
scene in his automobile, and securing
the assistance of passers-by, placed
the girls in the machine and brought
them to the Court House, from where
they were later taken to the county
jail.
The girls gave the name of Minnie
Jackson, 25, and Pearl Jackson, 19,
and in respones to queries stated that
they had come from Bluefield, W. Va.,
where their father had deserted them,
promising to meet them in Mt. Ster
ling. They were furnished with trans
portation by their father, and stopped
in Maysville for a day, coming to Mt.
Sterling later over the C. & O., by way
of Ashland. Their delinquent parent
did not meet them there and they
walked from Mt. Sterling to where
they were found yesterday.
They claimed they were enroute to
some point in the South, just where
they were unable to recall, where
htey had relatives.
The girls claimed to have taken
taken the dogs found with them, from
Maysville and Mt. Sterling, and said
they brought them along because they
(the girls) were lonesome.
As there was no charge placed
against the girls they were held for
safekeeping and will probably be re
leased this morning.

PITTSBURG MAN TELLS INTER
ESTING STORY OF LINCOLN.
In ah interesting letter to the Lex
ington Leader, Mr. David F. Patter
son, of Pittsburg, tells an interesting
story of the famous speech which
Abraham Lincoln made in Cincinnati,
in the latter part of February, 1861,
and which has been said was the
means of preventing Kentucky from
joining the secession movement. Mr.
Patterson, in his letter states that he
was then a student at the Cincinnati
Law School, and that his roommates
were Benjamin Butterworth, of Ohio,
afterward . the famous Congressman,
and Matthew Turney, afterward noted
as a judge of Paris, Ky. Mr. Patter
son further stated 'that Butterworth
had been a reporter on a local paper,
and that he had cheek and nerve
enough for all three.
DEAD FISH COVER FIVE HUN
DRED ACRES OF LAND.
Five hundred acres of dead fish line
the shores of Wauponoca Lake at the
Wauponoca Game Club, reserve in
Arkansas, according to reports receiv
ed at Memphis, Tenn. Lack of rain
is assigned as the cause.
The lake, scarcely more than two
feet deep at the deepest point, origin
ally covered 1,500 acres of ground.
During the last few weeks the lake
has dried rapidly, and unless heavy
rains come soon the entire sheet of
water is apt to evaporate.
At normal stage this lake abounds
with fish characteristic of local wa
ters. The 500 acres of water which
has been dissipated has killed thous
ands of the lake's fish. The shores
are lined with dead black bass, carp
and the like, and hundreds are dying
daily because of insufficient water.

POPULAR YOUNG LEXINGThw
MAN DROWNED IN MICmGAN.
David Barrow, Jr., aged nineteen,
years, the son of Dr. David Barrow
the well-known Lexington surgeon'
and well known in Paris society ci
cles, was drowned in Lake Michigan
near Ludington, Mich., late Tuesday
afternoon. Young Barrow and a com
panion, Edward Leavenworth, a fellow-student,
at the Students' Military
Camp, near Ludington, started out in
a canoe for a trip on the lake after
the noon lunch, alothough the lake
was very rough. When some dis
tance out a sudden squall struck the
frail craft overturning it. Leaven
worth swam ashore, leaving Barron
clinging to the capsized boat while he
secure help from the coast guards.
The supposition is that young Barrow
became exhausted from clinging to
the canoe and dropped off and sank
before aid could reach him. Life
savers and the coast patrol made in
effectual efforts to recover the body.
Young Barrow went to Ludington a
few days ago to join a United States
Government military camping partv.
He was well known amoug the young
er set in Paris society circles and
the news of his tragic death was re
ceived here with great sorrow by his
friends and those of his distinguished
father.
Though the efforts of the beach pa
trol and of the men in boats, search
ing for the body were tireless, it has
not been found.
Throughout the day and far into
the night searching parties continued
to patrol the beach. Twenty-five or
thirty boats were hurried to the scene
of the accident as soon as daylight ap
peared, and continued searching that
protion of the lake until driven in by
darkness. At last accounts the search
was still unavailing last night.
