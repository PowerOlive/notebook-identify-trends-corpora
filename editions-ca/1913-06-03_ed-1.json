OF MILLERSBURG
The twentieth annual commence
anent exercises of the M. M. I. opened
"Saturday evening at the M. M. I. drill
Hiall with the thre act comedy drama
entitled "The Time of His Life." by
the cadets, assisted by Misses Ruth
IMcClintock, Nettie Hurst and Martha
Smith. The piece was full of humor
from first to the finish." Neither the
cast nor the work was heavy, as Mrs.
Best usually puts on, but there was a
sjreat deal of individual work, which
made almost every character an am--ateur
star.
The musical program was equally
jgood, the audience was large, the
spacious auditorium being filled to its
-utmost. The public have looked for
ward to this commencement with
more than ordinary interest, it being
the twentieth anniversary of the
school under the management of Col.
3. M. Best. Connected with the ex
ercises is the home-coming of all the
old cadets, who have been arriving
.since Friday, there being more than
one hundred enrolled early Monday
.morning.
The homes of Millersburg citizens
re all open and there are many other
visitors also in town and community.
This occasion is a regular holiday and
ihe latch string is out for all who will
-enter.
Baccalaurate sermon was preach
ed Sunday morning at the Methodist
-church. All the available space in
the vast auditorium and lecture room
"was occupied and many were turned
.-.away. It was Dr. Gilbert's second
.appearance on a commencement oc
casion in Millersburg, he having de
livered the baccalaureate sermon for
the same school about ten years ago.
The service was very impressive.
JRev. J. D. Redd, of the Methodist
-church, presided over the preliminary
service. Prayers were made by Dr.
J. C. Fisher, President of the M. F. C,
.and Rev. A. S. Venable, of the Pres
byterian church.
The sermon by Dr. Gilbert was log
ical and deep and at the same time
abounding in simplicity of language,
:SO as to be understood by all who
"heard him. His appeal was to the
young manhood of the world and his
possibilities. The musical program
-was unusually good. The violin solo
of Miss Nell, the vocal solo of Mr.
Clay Sutherland, of Paris, and the trio
"by Mrs. C. M. Best, Capt. Howard
Freas and ex-cadet Sutherland, all de
serve especial mention. The follow
ing is a partial list of visitors: Mrs.

TOUCHED LIVE WIRE.
Mrs. Fannie Rummans Had Narrow
Escape Sunday Night.
Mrs. Fannie Rummans, residing on
Fifteenth street, had a narrow escape
from death Sunday night when she
came in contact with a telephone wire
which had crossed a lead wire of the
trolley on South Main street and as
a result sustained a number of severe
burns.
The accident occurred in front " of
the residence of Mr. William Cain,
while MrsyRummans was returning
home witli a number of her neighbors
from church, following the heavy
electric storm. The wind had blown
down a number of telephone wires
which became engaged with the trol
ley wire and were lying on the pave
ment. When she came in contact
with the wire she was thrown to the
sidewalk and remained in an uncon
scious condition for about fifteen
minutes.
The live wire was lying beside her
and her companions feared to go to
her assistance. However a member
of the party removed her from her
perilous position and she was assist
ed to her home. An examination re
vealed a number of burns on the left
limb and left hand.
Medical attention was immediately
summoned and a physician attended
her injuries. Mrs. Rummans, who is
aged about fifty-three years, had re
covered sufficiently from the shock
yesterday to be about the house, and
on serious results are anticipated.

NATIONAL BISCUIT COMPANY
Once Revolutionary.
The latest instance of a general en
forcement of laws concerning dress
occurred at the time of the French
Revolution, when some rulers of Ger
man states forbade their subject to
wear trousers, these being held to in
dicate revolutionary opinions. The
Elector of Hesse-Cassel, besides pro
hibiting the obnoxious garments, had
the convicts employed on road-sweeping
dressed in trousers, so as to In
spire disgust for sansculotte fashions.
No general prohibition of this kind
was issued in Prussia, but until 1798
all Prussian officials were restricted to
knee breeches for their nether gar
ments. Trousers were held to be "un
becoming to the dignity and gravity
of the holder of an official position.'
Ingenious Spiders.
Tho Ivoyal society in London was re
cently entertained by a distinguished
traveler with an account of a spider
living in Australia which makes its
habitation along the seashore, in the
crevices of the rocks, between high
and low water mark.
But when the tide is in their homes
are covered with water. Instead of de
serting them, however, the spiders
solve the difficulty by means of closely
woven sheets of silk, which they
stretch over the entrances, behind
wtiich they manage to retain sufficient
air to keep them alive during the time
they remain submerged. The Sunday
Magazine.
Computes Heat in Sun's Rays.
One square yard of the earth's sur
face receives each day averaging six
hours of sunshine an amount of heat
equal to that contained in 1.8 pounds
of coal, according to an Italian chem
ist. At this rate an area of about 1,200
miles receives during a year an
amount of energy from the sun equiv
alent to that obtainable from the 1,
100,000,000 tons of coal mined annu
ally in Europe and the United States.
The United States imported 95,000
000 pounds of tinplate in 1911.
