groups on the street about propa

the candidates of each Board The
voters of Millersburg would like to
be enlightened by the exponents of
these candidates, as to .iust what
they stand for, what they propose to
follow, and what pledges they are to
make the people. This can be done
either in a joint' meeting or at sep
arate times. Please let us hear fion
the two sets of candidates. And as
we have heard so much about propa
gandas, let us determine after hear
ing issues whether there are any
propogandas.
