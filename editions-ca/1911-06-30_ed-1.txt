LEINIIHAN, PropBoth Phones 234McCreary Replies to Blackburn.Former Governor and Ex-SenktorMcCreary was a visitor in Lexingtonvreunesaay ana gave out a statementin reply to the address of Hon. J. C.S. Blackburn in Owenton. Mr. McCreary's statement is as follows :"It is hardly necessary for me to respond to the statements reported inthe newspapers as made by SenatorBlackhurn last Monday at Owenton,in regard to my candidacy for Governor. My record is well known in Kentucky. "1 was not declared the nominee forUnited States Senator when the primary election was held, more thanfour years ago, but I made speeches inKentucky for the State Democraticticket, and did what I could to bringvictory to the Democratic candidatesfur state unices at the time of the lastelection. If I remember correctlySenator Blackburn was holding anoffice with a large salary at Panama,given to him by President Roosevelt,and did not participate in the campaign. "When I became a candidate forGovernor in the recent contest, I received ietters from leading Democratsof ninety-one counties of the State ofKentucky, who" voted for me in myrace for United States Senator, asking me to be a candidate. I did not'become a candidate for Governor because of the request of the forces thatcaused Kentucky to go Republican fouryears ago,' as alleged."Some opponents of mine, who cannot find anything in my lengthy political record to criticise, insinuate that Iam a candidate of a 'faction.' I amnot a candidate of a 'faction.' I am acandidate for Governor because, innearly every county in the State otKentucky, Democrats asked me to become a candidate, and the primaryelection will show Jthat my supportersrepresent the great body of the Democrats in Kentucky."When the Democratic State Committee met in Louisville, Ky., last December to decide in what manner theState Democratic candidates should benominated, I was the only candidateto advocate the primary election, andamong the reasons I gave at that timewas that primary elections were freeto bossisrn, ring rule and machines. Ihave always been opposed to machinesor factions in the Democratic party,and all know that when I was Governor of Kentucky, there was no bossisrnor machine ruld in the State."I believe that Mr. Addams' record,as a distiller and as a supporter ofPalmer and Buckner, would aeprivehim of thousands of votps, if he werethe nominee of the Democratic partyfor Governor. I have always votedthe straight Democratic ticket, andfor thirty years I have made speechesfor the Democratic candidates and-Democratic principle in every Staterace and every national race, hut Ihave never heard of my opponent makingfa speech in any race."My advocacy of religious freedomis known by all persons with whom Ihave associated and 1 have made perhaps a hundred speeches in which Iadvocated religious freedom &nd theright of every man or woman to worship God according to the dictates ofhis or her own conscience, and I havefinanced my own campaigns and paidmy own expenses at all times when-acandidate for office."I will be nominated by a large majority in the primary election nextSaturday and I will he able to defeatany Republican candidate for Governorwho may be nominated. I will notonly be supported by the full Democratic vote, but my Confederate comrades, their sons and their grandsons,and the Independents have assured meof active support.".WLr sm m .v v . .$mmSpecial iPn'ceFORSuit BuyersOURjjjffS30 and S35 suitsininFor $24These Suits are this Saason's Models-ComeH"iv.iv, aa uicy lTWli l last IWI5 K INK pilLC 4ftIPPrice &Clothiers9 vm.Hi.BBBV ) BvSaK'kkBBBBBBBBBBBCSCSCS MlkBBKBBBf"We Know How."1William Addams for GovernorFavors:1.

TefKiane 716. -&.00PayableSPORTING NEWS LETTERBy C. H. ZUBER.Cincinnati, June 30. Manager Griffith, of the Reds, has registered apromise with a few personal friends.ifrealized, will completely revolutionizethe feelings of Cincinnati followersof base ball within a very short time.Griffith's promise is that on the coming trip of the Reds, during whichthey will play in Boston Brooklyn,New York and Philadelphia, the teamwill win so many games that the badstreak which it has experienced recently will be entirely torgotten, andthe fans will again be pulling for theQueen City athletes to wind up theirseason in the first division. "Ourslump is over ; the Doys again are getting back to the form that was expected of them early in the season, andfrom now on victories will predominate," declared the Reds' leader."The material ist here for a first division finish, and we're going to see toit that opportunities are not wasted.The season is not yet half over and inwhat remains of it we can make astiff fight and finish up among theelect. Our pitchers are showing theform that was expected of them ; ourhitting is becoming more timely, andin other respects the team finally iswaking up. Nothing is going to stopus from now on." Let's hope he'sright.There has been a well-defined suspicion going the rounds ever since theseason opened that Manager Griffithbroke into a quince orchard and robbedthe most conspicious tree when he secured George McQuillan from thePhillies. The several recent appearances of the big fellow, however, indicate that he isn't the failure that itwas thought he was. His last appearance in Pittsburg on Monday of thiswetk was marked by a line of jelassywoik tnat was entirely like that'delivered by the McQuillan of old. He hadall the shoots, speed and control thatmade him such a whale in seasonsagone. And the beauty of it is thathe says that he's going to be even better. McQuillan really never was"gone," so it is not a question of hisbeing able to "come back." Manager Griffith will work the big fellowregularly from now on, and hopes toshow him in some of the Sundaygames for which the Reds are scheduled when they come back from theEast, including those of July 23 withSt. Louis; July 30 with Brooklyn; August G with Philadelphia, and August13 with Pittsburg.That a lead of ten or -twelve gamesisn't a killing handicap is shown bythe performances of the PhiladelphiaAthltics recently. Less than sixweeks after the season had opened theDetroits were so far ahead of theworld's champions that the wise onessaid that the Mackits had potered outthat they were hopelessly lost so faras honors this season were concerned.But a gionce at the percentage tableof the American League today showsthat the dope was all wrong, and thatthe good material on the Athletic teamwas certain to assert itself in due season and assume the rank to which itsability was entitled. Now it is aneven money preposition that the Mackmen will win the pennant in theAmerican League again, and there isevery reason to believe that they willgrow better as the season, progresses ;and if that is true of the Athletics,why should it not apply to the Reds?Griffith's men haven't been doing anyworse than did the world's championsearlier in the season. ' The material isthere for a spurt a la the Athletics.And stranger things have happened.The ,news wafted from Richmond,Va., some days ago that John L. Sullivan, the last and greatest of the oldtime ring gladiators, had made hislast public appearance in the spanglesof his profession, brings back a hostof memories of the old days of pugilism, when brut strength more thancleverness ruled the game, and whenthe nen who went into the ring werewilling to settle the question of supremacy with bare knmkles, if necessary. It was a sad day for a majorityof the fight fans of America when Sullivan was licked by Corbetr, and whilethere have been several champions ofthe heavyweight class since that time,not one of them, from Cor bett, throughFitzsimmons and Jeffries, down toJack Johnson, ever held the place inthe public's affection that was enjoyedby "Old John L." He was a grand,old tighter and is sun an idol with thelovers of the art pugil istic.ONE YEAR,Event year there's a new "turfwonder sprung on the betting: public ;and every year the followers of theponies feel that there's going to besomething bigger and better "pulledoff" with this nag than ever before.This year it's a nifty littla twa-year-oldby the name of "The Manager,"that is getting the support of the betting public aroand these diggiags. Inthe several starts which, The -Managerhas made at Lateaia curing the p:e-. i ' . i j xSIX MONTHSin Advance$1.00ent meeting, he has run true to form,and has shown so much superiorityover his competitors that there is reason to believe th?t he really is thclassiest young3ter of the present season. With several of the larger Eastern tracks getting ready to open, despite the adverse laws, it is reasonableto suppose The Manager will have theopportunity of meeting the best horsesof his age among the big Eastern stables. And those who have seen himperform dpclare that he'll have notrouble holding his own with anyjhorseoi nis age in America.Clark to Take Stump for James.Speaker Champ Clark will stumpKentucky this fall. Ho reached thedetermination Sunday morning whenhe learned that Senator Thomas H.Pavnter had withdrawn from the contest for the United States Senatorship,and that Representative Ollic Jameswould receive the nomination at theDemocratic primary July 1.The big First Kentucky DistrictCongressman has been one of the mostloyal Clark men in the House. Beforeit was assured that Clark would beelected Speaker, James was one of themost active men in his behalf. Allthrough James' campaign for the Senatorship Speaker Clark has been greatly interested and the Missourian is going to lend every assistance possiblefor the election of a Democratic Legislature which will ratify the choice ofthe Democratic primary.Incidentally, the Clark Presidentialboom will be sorung on the Democratsof the State. Clark is a native of Kentucky, and has such a strong hold onthe Democrats tof the State that itis considered likely that Kentuckywill send a Clark delegation to thenext Democratic National Convention.Representative Sherley of the FifthDistrict is said to be for the nomnationof Governor Harmon, or Ohio, and re-!port has it that under his leadershipClerk is not to get the delegates without a contest.A Terrible Munder.to neglect liver trouble.
