Great interest is being manifested
in the State Latin Tournament to
be held in the Paris High School on
May 15. Letters have been sent out
to all teachers in the State by Miss
Tioff, of the Paris High 'School, pres
ident of t-he Kentucky Classical As- '
sociation, inviting and urging them
to be presant, and take part in the
program.
Examinations will be given in '
Vergil, Cicero, Caesar and First
Year Latin. These examinations
will be based upon a year's stand- f
ard unit of work, that is, Vergil six
books, prosody, general mythology; I
Cicero, six orations, the four against '
Catalina, the Manilian law and '
Archias; Caesar, Books I-IV; prose j
composition, syntax and inflections,
general knowledge of the author i
and his times; First Year Latin,
any standard book, like Pearson,
Scott or Smith, containing vocabu
lary and grammar.
As the examinations are to in
volve an investment of only two
hours time, it is evident that the
ork given will have to be carefully
selected. The teachers of a Cincin
nati Latin department High School
will make out the questions; they
will examme the .papers, and upon
their decision only depends the
awaud of prizes, a gold medal to the
winner of each contest. The exam
ination questions will be mailed to
the professor of a nearby college.
He will conduct the examinations
and will forward the answer papers
to Cincinnati. The contest will be
held and the medals awarded re
gardless of the number of contest
ants. Paris will entertainthe delegates
at lunch. Each school may have
four representatives, a Senior to
take the Caesar examination, a
Freshrajm to take the First Year
examination. Each representative
must be taking the work for the
nrsi lime. i
Thirty-six entries have been re- j
ceived to date by Miss Elizabeth
Roff, of the Latin department of the
Paris High School, to the State
Latin Tcuicam'ent, which is to "be
held in this city on Saturday, May
15. The examinations will be iu
charge of Prof. T. T. Jo-nes, of the !
University of Kentucky. The que&- j
tions are being piepared by the !
Walnut Hills High School of Cin
cinnati. The Paris High School commence
ment exercises will begin on. Sun
day, June 6, when the Commence
ment sermon will be preached at i
the Christian church by X)r. E. E. i
