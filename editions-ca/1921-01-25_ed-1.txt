Thisentire crop averaged $34, while th3crop of Caywood & Plummer averaged $33.00.Like the tobacco markets in allother cities in the Bluegrass, thelocal market keeps along the slumping line, and much dissatisfactionat low prices has been expressed bythose who have brought their tobacco here. Earlier in the week tbomarket seemed to be a little stronger, only to begin a decline that,growers stated, has been steady day jby day. Even the better grades oftobacco have felt the effect of theslump, and growers are greatly disheartened by the prices being paidfor their product. Many have notunloaded their wagons, while othershaving tobacco on the floors, areholding for a possible change inprices. The tobacco continues tocome to market, but if the lovprices continue, there will be a verynoticeable slacking of receipts.Offerings on the market ofThursday were mostly of the commongrades, but there 'Was an increaseddemand for that grade, which causedthe prices to advance about one cent.Both warehouses sold about 227,000at an average of $12.40. The market Friday was about on a par withthat of the day previous, with pricespossibly a shade lower. Good tobacco brought fairly good figures,but there was a preponderance ofthe lower grades, which reduced theaveinare. The Bourbon Tobacco 1Warehouse Co. sold 162,980 poundsfor $15,745.91, an avciage of $11.50.As illustrating the condition of thelocal tobacco market the followingwas told THE NEWS Saturday by aParis grocer:"One of my best customers, aBourbon county farmei, who has always had great success in growingtobacco, Fent a load of the weed toiho Paris market Friday.

Although Berlin haschanged since 1914, the German mindremains unchanged. Neither the holocaust o dead nor the crash of throneshas shaken Germany out of her selfconceit, according to what G. Valentine Williams, formerly correspondentof Reuter's Agency in Berlin, tells theLondon Daily Mail."The German mind," he says, "doesnot seem to have altered."Albeit sadly puzzled to account forthe utter break-do n of the entireGerman system, in his outlook on lifethe German of 1920 is to most intentsand purposes the German of 1913. Ina world which to British eyes isstrangely , changed by five yeais ofWorld war the mental isolation of theGerman is absolute. To talk to himmakes you feel that the German oftoday is the loneliest creature on God'searth."Yet with heavy deliberation he iscommuning with himself to ascertainthe causes of his defeat. But he isnot examining his conscience."Any Berlin bookshop will show youthe chaos prevailing in the Germanmind.Nothing of the Present."Professor Steinach's rejuvenationexperiments, Einstein's theory of light,Maynard Keynes and Norman Angellon the Versailles Peace both booksin German translations and prominently displayed treatises on spiritualism,atheism, free love, and the like worksof this description stand side by sidewith a mass of frankly pornographicliterature. Here will you find reasonedexplanations for the past, complicatedschemes for the future, but nothingpractical to deal with the problems ofthe present. And above all, no contrition for Germany's crime againstmankind."The German surveyed the worldfrom his castle of militarism. Nowthat It has collapsed he Is left floundering In a sea of doubts and fears.The Germans with whom I have spoken expect us to hold them guiltless ofthe past because, they say, they haverid Germany of her military caste."They have, it is true, expelled thebloody-minded blunderers surroundingthat eminent nonentity, William theSecond-rater, because they failed tokeep their promise to establish German world-domination. But the German people is governed by the herdInstinct, and the expulsion of the OldGang in the circumstances of military defeat and home panic in whichthe Hohenzollerns were sent away requires weightier evidence of a changeof heart that Is forthcoming In Germany today, if It is to be accepted asa proof of the death of German militarism. "Blank Indifference.Talk to a Frenchman of any class,and you will, sooner or later, comeupon a well-banked but fiercely smouldering Republican ardor. Talk to aGerman about his government and youwill find, at the best, lukewarm Interest; at the worst, resentful ridiculetowards the German Republic."The average attitude is one ofblank indifference. The German manIn the street never thought for himself. He does not do so today. Thequestion of the future is, what partywill emerge from the present chaos todo his thinking for him?t'The Germans are perfectly willingto forgive us for the war. They talkglibly about 'this unhappy war' withthe air of a man making perfunctoryexcuses for some social lapse. Insome may be detected in addition alittle air of condescension in speakingof the late unpleasantness as thoughto draw attention to their magnanimity in accepting the war as an inevitable catastrophe, 'an act of God,' as theinsurance policies say. And even today I find that the great majority ofGermans have no idea of the abhorrence in which the very name GermanIs held in the Anglo-Saxon countries'and in France and Belgium."IANDSIIDE DISCLOSES COALMINE IN FLEMING COUNTY 'What is believed to be avaluablecoal mine lias been discovered irFleming county about nine milesfrom Flemingsburg on a farm owneaby Wat Strode, beUveen Sugar LoaiMountain and Foxport.

Tobacco broughtlots of money, yet a very large percent, of it was spent for feed to carrythe stock through the winter tograss and feed the work stock whilethe ci op was being raised. The samething was true in a smaller degreelast year.Now most farmers have corn, hayor oats, and sojmetimes all thiee, forsale.

That is what Mme. Pierre Tartoue,wife of the noted portrait painter,said in discussing her marriage andher suit for separation just started.Mr. Tartoue is said to be in theAdirondacks. His studio is said tohave been sublet to Rene Van Lennap, a friend.Since Mme. Tartoue departed fromher home over a month ago in themiddle of the night, following a series of alleged sensational incidentsin and near the studio, she has beenliving in seclusion with her mother,Mrs. H. Bengue Barnett.Tells .of Persecution.Light on the nature of her disagreement, with her husband was shedby Mme. Tartoue during her interview. She said:"The persecution to which I wassubjected by two elderly women willbe made public during the trial."I lent myself to Pierre for publicity purposes much against my owninclination. He told me it would helphim."I lent him money as well, as mostAmerican girls who marry foreigners find they are obliged to do forthe sake of preserving their homesand saving their husbands from financial difficulties. My family andfriends have reason to know intimatedetails concerning these financialtransactions."I sacrificed myself on the altarof Pierre's art and I soon discoveredhe did not appreciate it. This ismy attitude toward my husband. 1have no animosity in my heart, onlypity."After I was Pierre's wife he constantly told me I was no longer anAmerican woman. He said I was under the French law, because I hadmarried a French citizen. He toldme I would have to bear half theexpense of our establishment andthat French women had no rights.Helped in His Work."Pierre lofd me he was madly inlove with me. I was madly in lovewith him. He told me and told myfriends I was the most beautifulAmerican girl, lie told me I was aninspiration to him in his art. Believing implicity in him and in hisgenius, I helped him every way Icould. I even posed for him for portraits of myself, and I posed for thehands and gowns of some of his bestportraits. Among those were theportraits he painted last year of Mrs.Frederick Brooks of New York, Mrs.Harold Brooks and Miss Ruth Shoelhopf of Buffalo."After he had painted a portraitof me with my wedding veil over myhead, some critics told him it wasone oi tne best pieces or woric nehad ever done. When he painted the'God of Happiness,' which now hangsin the Alfred I. du Pont home onLong Island, I helped him with mysuggestions."I found, however, that Pierre didnot appreciate me. With my ownhands I used to cook him little studio dinners so that at the end ofthe day, when he was tired out frompainting, he would not have to goout for dinner. Those were halcyondays when Pierre and I were by ourselves night after night in our studio. I could hardly believe the thingwas real, it was so ideal."We were married October 14, 1919.and I will never forget the promiseshe made that day, for he did notkeep a single one of them."WE HAVE ON DISPLAYand can make IMMEDIATE DELIVERYa larger stock of finishedGranite Monumentsthan all other dealers in Central Kentucky.
