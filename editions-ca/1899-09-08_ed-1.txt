FAMINESeriously Affects Building of TorpedoBoats Now Under ConstructionOther Builders Are Anctoi by theHeavy Prices and Scarcity f Steeland May Be Compelled Askfor ExtensionsWashington Sept ft The navy itbeginning to feel seriously the effectof the heavy advance in the steel market Tuesday the shipbuilding firm olLally Co of Boston asked a yearsextension from October 1 in buildingthe torpedo boats DeLong and Blakelynow under construction in their yardsThe Nixons at Elizabethport N Jwho are building the torpedo boatsNicholson and OBrien have stated tcnaval officials that it is impossible forthem to get forgings and sruts and itis expected that they will have to askan extension There are 12 of the torpedo boats and destrojrers under construction in various yards and all areaffected by the steel famine and theheavy prices so that it is expectedthat extensions will be asked on all ofthese craftThe prospect is that the bids on thesix protected cruisers to be opened onNovember 1 will be much higher thanwas expected when the appropriationfor them was made It is roughly estimated that the steel in hulls has advanced about 50 per cent in engines40 per cent in boilers 30 per centand that the average advance on allclasses of steel used in ships is aboutSo per centThe engineering bureau has aiaofelt the advance not only in increasedprices but in an inability to get material and buildings inside the limitfixed by congress On a recent purchase of electric cranes the advancewas found to be about 25 per cent Inthe contracts for material for thepower plant at New York the increaserang d from 30 to 60 per cent the latter applying to enginesThe bureau of yards and docks is unable to proceed with a number of building projects at navy yards and stations owing to the advance in steelThis is the case as to the large buildings at the New York navy yard allthe bids being in excess of the amountallowed by congress The same is trueof the ordnance shops at League Islandyard Philadelphia and other lesser projectsCivil Engineer Cunningham of thebureau of yards and docks saysstructural steel has advanced 100 percent and in some cases 300 per cent-Adm ONeil of the bureau of ordnance says ordnance is about the onlybranch not affected by the rise in steelGun metal is use only by the army andnavy so that there is no commercialdemand to send up the pricesAT THE

Fate Rests WithEmperor William His Decision IsAnxiously AwaitedRennes Sept 7 The salvation ofCapt Dreyfus hangs on a word fromEmperor William This wa the general opinion here Wednesday nightIf the kaiser consents to allow CoLSchwartzkoppen the German militaryattache at Paris in 1S94 to testify before the court martial or to send adeposition or what is considered stillmore probable to allow his depositionto be accompanied by the actual documents mentioned in the bordereauthen Dreyfus is saved If the emperorhowever decides that it is not in theinterests of Germany for Col Schwartzkoppen to intervene then Dreyfuscase is hopeless and his condemnationcertainWednesday night the eyes of Francewere looking across the frontier toStuttgart where the kaiser is stayingand anxiously awaiting his decisionlie is in the position of the spectatorsof a gladiatorial combat in the Coliseum in ancient Rome with Dreyfuslying at the foot of his antagonist andwatching whether the emperor pointshis thumb up or down At a late hourWednesday evening he had given nosign either way and Frenchmen areawaiting with breathless interest thefirst indication of his willTo all intents and purposes EmperorWilliam stands to day the arbiter ofthe internal peace of France for everyone anticipates that King Humbertwill follow his lead This is probablythe explanation of the delay Emperor William has gone to Wurtemburg from Alsace Loraine and KingHumbert is at Turin Communicationbetween the two monarchs is therefore somewhat complicated and asthey will undoubtedly agree upon identical measures in replying to M Laborirs appeal it is possible that severaldays will elapse before their decisionis knownThe opinion generally held here isthat Emperor William and King Humbert will allow Col Schwartzkoppenand Col Panizzardi to be examined bya rogatory commission and their depositions to be sent to Rennes with supplementary evidence from the originalof Esterhazys treasonable writingsThe anti Dreyfusards are extremelyexasperated at what they characterizeas M Laboris trick He had longbeen seeking an excuse to invoke theintervention of the German andItalian sovereigns and seized the appearance of Cernuschi as his opportunity declaring that the admission ofthe evidence of this foreigner justifiedhis application regarding Schwartzkoppen and PanizzardiM Labori insisted that the appearance of Cernuschi on the witnessstand was quite without precedent butthe point out andwith a certain amount of reason thatthe counsel for the defense were reallythe first to introduce foreigntestimony as they summoned theEnglish journalist Rowland Strongon the question of Esterhazys confession to having written the bordereauRknnes Sept 7 At the opening ofthe Dreyfus court martial Thursdaymorning M Labori announced that hehad received a semi official intimationthat Col Schwartzkoppen and ColPanizzardi would be unable to appearpersonally before the court and so heproposed that a rogatory commissionshould be telegraphed to receive theirdepositionsM Paleolouge and Maj Carriere didnot oppose this proposition only thelatter pointed out that the proposedstep would involve a deviation fromthe general proceedure in necessitatinga long adjournment M Labori replied that the court was entitled to adjourn for 4S hours and in case a longerperiod was required he suggested thata short session be held Friday whenthe court adjourns until MondayHe then drew up a formal application that Cols Schwartzkoppen andPanizzardi be cited as witnesses andthac seven questions should be telegraphed them to which they shouldreply under oath The first questionwas if they had ever receivedthe documents mentioned in thebordereau and he also requestedthat they also be asked if they had received the firing manual when andfrom whom whether either had sentto Esterhazy the petit bleu a copywhereof had been telegraphed andfinally if directly or indirectly theyhad had any relations with DreyfusThe court deliberated on M Laborisapplication for a rogatory commissionfor a quarter of an hour at the expiration of which time Col Jouaust read thedecision declaring that the court wasincompetent to grant the

Postrj Practical PhilosophyWoDIDNT catch her name when Cousin1Edith introduced us at the gardenparty but she was unquestionably Interesting We ran through art and music and drama in half an hour ThenAve cameto philosophyThere is such a difference said shebetween practice and theoryI conceded the point She was soCharming in fact that l wished it hadbeen a larger point to concede Tim1 ventured to remark that doesntmake the theory wrongShe leaned her cheek thoughtfullyupon one gloved finger possibly to display the small ness of her hand possiblybecause the pose suited her probablyfor both reasonsWhen you say that the regenerationof the universe can only be accomplished by white men marrying blaekwomenAnd blaek men white womenNo thank you She shrugged hershoulders Well as a matter of factyou do not care anything about theregeneration of the universeI dont believe I do I laughedNor contemplate marrying a negressyourselfUnfortunately my personal tastelies so strongly in the direction of theblonde Edith had remembered thiswith her usual discretionIf I were black vou would sav vonpreferred ebony to ivoryI raised my hands in protest I assure you I averred solemnly I prefer you as you areCut ycu havent seen me any otherhowI am clear that improvement is impossibleShe laughed a delightfully saucylaughWhat a stock in trade of compliments you keep I can understandwhy your cousin described you as atonic for a diffident young person likemeThere is not1 I declared anotherlike you so far as my experience goesYou are putting me in a glow ofsatisfaction with myself Please go onThere ought to be one or two nicepoints remaining in me1 regarded her with calm scrutinyAn appearance of impudence becomesyou I said butButSo do all appearancesPrav dont think that vou have ex-hausted my appearances She sankback in another attitude Why3ouve barely known me an hourAn hour 1 said feelingly of exquisite qualityAn hour she sug gested whichshould rightfully have been devoted toa black woman She looked as if shewould like to add something but refrainedYou were going to sayPoor black woman Her eyessparkled wickedly I dont mean itshe hastened to addAccording to my theory I explained you should have been delighting the eyes and ears of some duskygentleman and erloor black man I never saw sucha girl to laughOn the contrary If you were toadopt my theory 1 should paint

therethat 1 doubt if 1 have any serious conversation You arc not a missionaryin disguise arc youShe didnt answer for a minute Itwas carious to watah her face changefrom merriment through thought toseriousness First the laughter diedgradually in her eyes then the littlecurls and turns went out of her lipsthen the dimples in the cheeks smoothed themselves out like ripples wideninginto nothingness on the sea then shelifted up her head a little on one sideand looked at me with solemn child-Bometteea she said sadly 1 wishI were Sometimes I wirn a missionarywould come to me I get tired oimaking fun of things and think thatperhaps they are serious after allI twirled my mustache and felt mjown smile fading out They are serious enough I said if you look atthem in that way It isnt a good wayto look at things things in generalI thinkBut one looks sometimes she saidabsently at things iu particular andfeels very very seriousThen I said leaning forward onedoesnt talk about them much Thereis rarely anyone to whom one cares tctalk about themI dont think she went on with alittle catch in her voice there is everany single person to whom anyonewould like to tell them all the seriousparticulars I meant4I dont think there is so usually onedoesnt tell themOr unburdens oneself in installments as opportunity offers Shesighed againExact ly That is why there are suchodd confidences now and then Thecritics lashed a scene in my last bookbecause he told her one of his secretsin the first half hour of their acquaintance It was natural enough reallyHe was bound to tell some one sheassented and she was the fitting confidante for that particular secretQuite so Slie was the response tothat one item of his natureTlie worst of it said my fair acquaintance is when ones nature ismany sided because wed MU knowwhat 1 meanSociety expects us to find a singlekindred spirit which is to respond toall the call- and it cannotNo it cannot she spoke withenergy though it may answer sowell so very well to some Herhands trembled Li her lapWherefore said speaking half tomyself we find it a sound theorv nott expect too much freiv anyone tolie thankful for what is given and companionate to what is misiiingYou look at the matter more calmlythan 1 she cried passionately withher lips quiveringPerhaps I told her 1 have lookedat it ofttner or longer agoShe studied the iloor

and increase it figures in thewarship of Atarte the chief goddessof the Phoenician Pantheon who under various names was adored by everSemitic race It is not therefore surprising that the crescent should be thechosen emblem of a conquering andspreading people The hordes of Genghiz Kahu carried it on their bannersfrom the great wall of China to theIndu and the Yolga in the thirteenthcentury yet these were Mongols andenemies of the very people with whomthe crescent is generally associatedThe Ottoman Turks who first got landsin Asia as a reward for assisting theSeljuks against the Mongols seem fromtheir first arrival in these regions tohave displayed the well known symbolIt appeared on the banners of the Janissaries of the Sultan Orkhan in thefourteenth century and subsequentlythe Crusaders fixed it in the eyes ofChristiandom as the counter emblem ofthe cross It is sometimes held that theTurks borrowed the crescent from theByzantine Greeks but this is evidentlynot the case On the contrary theGreeks had probably at an early periodadopted it with other religious symbolsand ideas from the east Detroit FreePressMoneyMoney talks but it isnt on speakingterms with a good many people Chicago Paily NewsTHE COCAINE HABITIts Victims Suffer Torture That IsBeyond DescriptionExperience of an Australian Physician as Told by Himself Saleof the Drug Should BeRegulated by LawSpecial Washington LetterTruth is stranger than fiction inmany instances The fiction that a manwas possessed of a dual nature that onoccasion he was a Dr Jekyll and onanother occasion a Mr Hyde is sustained by facts in real lifeSome one of these days you will readof the death of an eminent man in thenational capital either by Ida ownhand or as the result of BO encounterwith another Or else you may readthat he has committed a murder or donesomething heinous And yet he has always been known as one of the mostgentle and honorable of men He movesabout in high official and social circlesand is known to be as suave and gentleas ever Put Jin eminent man of science tells me that fully one third ofevery day he is closely watched to prevent him from injuring himself or others He is a victim of the cocaine habitFor a score of years he was known tobe one of the most business like of correspondents and every days mail wasanswered every day During the pastyear it has been noted that he was becoming careless and that tin mail waspermitted to accumulate for days at atime Then with two or three stenographers be would answer all the letters with business like tact as formerly Put during the past two months helias not written a letter although hiscorrespondents continue to send theirinquiries to him He hates the sight ofa letter carrier He knows that hisbusiness is being neglected but he doesnot strive to attend to it Moreover heis beginning to look pale and to be lassitudinous in Ids movements but thesesymptoms are only noted by his relatives and some men of science whohave been requested to look after himIn a recent article on the subject ofcocaine some of the evils of the drugwere pointed out The scientist whogave thai information has given moreto day which will be of general interest He says that the eminent gentleman alluded to is but a type of akind of patients rapidly multiplying ofrecent years It is his opinion thatpublic attention should be called to theevil habit and repeated warnings begiven the peopleThese evils cannot be more stronglyrevealed than in the experience of anAustralian physician He has giventhe world of medicine the benefit of anarration of what he underwent afterhe had become addicted to the almost7 1w AMm MrA COCAINISTS DELUSION-constant use of the drug In the courseof that confession which he did nothesitate to make public he said in describing his sensations The first feeling a cocainist has is indiscribable excitement to do something- great toleave a mark But alas this disappears as rapidly as it came and soonevery part of the body seems to cry outfor a new syringe The second sensation at first at least no hallucination is that his is enormouslvincreased so that he hears the fliesWalking over the paper Very soonevery sound begins to be a remarkabout himself of a nasty kindand he begins to carry on a solitary lifehis only companion being his belovedsyringe Every passerby seems to talkabout him Often and often have Istopped persons or ordered the policeto arrest them thinking they weretalking about me After a relativelyshort time begins the hunting of thesocaine bug You imagine that inyour skin worms or similar things aremoving along If you touch them withwool especially absorbent wool theyrun away and disappear only to peepcautiously out of some corner to see ifthere is any danger These worms areprojected only to the cocainists ownperson or clothing He sees them on hiswashing in his skin along his penholder but not on other people orthings and not on clothes brought cleanfrom the laundry How is this to be explained About the same time appearmany other hallucinations of the opticus and strange to say self-suggestedhallucinations also Night turns today You sit up in your room syringing until the morning and fall asleep ina como In my ease this occurred tosuch an extent that I had to engage ahospital warder w ho camr in the morning to revive me with about ten syringesof five per cent solution so that I wasbe to drive not walk fearing someone might garrote me Other dreadfulLullucinations I had in thousands all ofc persecuting character and frightening the life out of me so long as the effects of the drug lastedYou see small animals runninabout your body and feel their bitesEvery object seems to become alive tostare at you from all corners look revolvers knives etc and threaten youYet so soon as the effect of the injectionis over you laugh at it and producewillingly by a new injection the sameterrors About that time I boughtthree St Bernard dogs thinking theywould protect me but one night 1found out they were talking about mehow could they get rid of me so 1stood up and shot one of them with arevolver which I always used to carryI think this w as the most dreadful nightof my life I standing on the table withan Indian dagger and a syringe on theground one three foot high dog goingto die and two rather dangerous dogsroaring and groaning aloud reproachfully looking at me who always fancied Now comes the moment whenthey will tear you to pieces I stoodthe night on the table until the arrival of my wardman who hardly riskedto enter the room The strangest thinghowever in the cocaine habit is thatthere seem to be two souls in the cocainist one infested by the cocaine suffering and tortured by its effects theother normal laughing at his fears andsaying What nonsense it is only anhallucination produced by an injectionNot frightened enough by these experiences and escaping from the troublesproduced by his conduct on the cocainist goes taking more and more andlrmSHOOTING HIS DOG FRIENDthen enters a new kind of illusionwhich finishes him up for the madhouse I mean the revolting sensuousillusionsThe afflicted physician in summarizing the physiologic effects of the drugsays that the cocainist earlv loses allappetite for solid food but likes sweetslollies and cakes Vpon the muscularsystem the drug as is generally recognized acts as a most powerful stimulantfor either single or continued effortNot only could he make long marcheswithout becoming tired but on one occasion after injection he says he lifteda cab with one hand on the axle It increases also the number of the respiratory and of the heart contractions aswell as the amount of sweat hence thegreat loss of weight After each injection the pupil dilates but remainsdilated only because injections are continued As regards the brain mentalprocesses seem quickened but a kindof hypnosis intervenes so that thebrain works without and even againstthe will Immediately after the injection the cocainist becomes excited andremains restless while under the influence He likes manual work howevertrifling but has neither will nor ability for mental workThese are facts which the temperancelecturers of the future should possessand disseminate The crusade againstalcohol which has progressed for wellnigh half a century has been partiallysuccessful It has made the liquor business unpopular the saloonkeeper apariah and the drunkard a dreadfulexample to the young That there isyet much work to be done in that causeeverybody sees and admits The crusade will go on for decades before itsend shall have been completely attainedBut here is additional work to be donefor humanity and it must be doneprimarily by men of education and discernment It will require some yearsfor the workers in the cause of humanity to apprehend and comprehend theconditions thus outlined They mustknow that there is now on the market awell advertised wine which is a decoction of cocaine Some physicians recommended its use as a stimulant for thenervous system and for the digestionThis is an insidious form of introducingthe cocaine habit and those physicianswho understand the dreadful and horrible results of that habit will notrecommend its use in any form Thatthey will administer it themselvesmust be taken for granted because itis a good drug and a valuable additionto the pharmacopiaCocaine may be effectively used toproduce temporary anaesthesia overthe entire nerve trunk It can be effectively used to benumb sensibilityand relieve pain in all mucous tractswhich the surgeon may desire to reachIt is better than chloroform or ether inmany particulars Surgeons dentistsand physicians may intelligently use itfor the benefit of mankindBut cocaine must be kept from thecommon people Nature has producedenough perverts criminals and idiotsfor some inscrutable purpose Alcoholand opium have added to their numberCocaine should be throttled before itincreases its

that for a moment 1 felt a little chilled thinking that it may have beena spirit alter all Fortifying myself however with the thought that it it was a spiritit seemed in no way anxious to meet me

and apparently just vacated by its occupants Ina corner of the room stood a harp lying on atable close to a low luxurious scat were somearticles of dainty feminine embroidery sonsilken curtains

had not however sufficient experience then of the lengths to which thosenocturnal confidences in which the fair sexindulge with each other extend In themeantime I could not but admire the graceful figures before me and especially of herm ho had given me the tari Clad in a softclinging robe clasped by a jewel at herthroat and a silver girdle round her waistwith her pale proud features set in a

Which TheyAre Allowed to GrowIt would be difficult for most farmersto calculate how great is the loss fromthe prevalence of weeds in crops In aseason when dry weather prevails theselosses are comparatively small thougheven then the weeds take water fromthe soil which is not all returned whenthey are uprooted and buried in it Theweed that is buried is surrounded by airspaces keeping the soil more porousthan it otherwise would be and therefore drying it out faster The case isstill worse as regards the fertility thatthe weed has taken It was originallyentirely soluble but the weed has toferment and be resolved into vegetablemold before it can be put in the samesoluble condition Yet we have knownfarmers to delay cultivation of hoedcrops so as to have more grass andweeds to be plowed underIt is often said that weeds are a preventive of good farming that therewould be much less cultivation of hoedcrops if it were not that the growth ofweeds made it necessary Vet wherethe cultivator is kept going all throughthe season so often as to prevent anyweed from reaching the surface theweed killed as quickly as it sproutedhas done the soil more good and lessharm than it could do at any subsequent stage of its growth At this early period about all the plant substancehas been directly furnished from theswelling and decomposition of the seedin germination At this time the carbonic acid gas which the seed gives offwhen it germinates makes its plantfood more soluble than it ever can beafter the plant puts forth roots and begins to draw from the soil Finely powdered malt has been used as a fertilizerWhen it has been applied in contactwith seed grain of any kind it has produced remarkable results though it istoo expensive a fertilizer to be used ona very large scale But the ordinaryweed seed is much smaller and has farless fertilizing material in it than has agrain of barleyIt is the peculiarity of most weedsthat most of their growth is taken directly from the soil and that both itand the moisture to make the plant foodsoluble are needed by growing cropsEach days growth of a weed amonghoed crops lessens the yield If theweed is left until late its roots will beso

Indianschools and for some time past has jbeen reducing those holding such office 1to subordinate places and putting men jin charge of the schools Owing to the Icharacter of the work required ofperintendents Commissioner Jones jholds that women do not possess thenecessary qualifications Theeioner advances several reasons forthis The superintendent is on dutypractically 24 hours every day jing at the school under his or her care jThe superintendent has the executive jhead of the school work and has chargeof the employes including teachersmatrons seamstresses cooks laundresses and farmers The management of the force is an arduous taskespecially in the larger schools Forthe issuance of the clothing and provisions the superintendent is als o responsible and must be familiar withaecounts and business methodsThe principal objection to women superintendents lies in the fact that atall Indian schools industrial trainings the principal feature and it is saidIt has been demonstrated that womenare unfitted for work of this characterHerds of cattle farms and gardens areto be looked after by the superintendent who also has charge of the disbursements and is expected to prepare estimates for new buildings repairs andother improvements Where a man issuperintendent he has general oversight over the entire plant and operates the literary department througha principal

ifclimbing Then he reached right andleft above his head as one would do inpicking cherries Then without slackening his remarkable flow of conversation he put the thumb and first fingerof his left hand together and held thema few inches before his eyes and wentthrough the careful movements of onethreading a small needle And all thetime he talked Next he made overhandmotions as of throwing Then he gavean imitation of some one swimmingAfter that he described several rapidcircles with his left hand which gavethe impression of a revolving wheelThen he leaned forward and with hisright hand lifted

ticket for the latter city anda few hours later he found himself inthe national capital As he was unableto read the mistake was not discovereduntil he reached Washington and tocomplicate matters he had not sufficient funds to purchase a ticket toBostonPie presented his case to the railroadofficials at Washington and they putting him to a test were unable to distinguish from his pronunciation
