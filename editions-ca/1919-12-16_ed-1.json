ABAS, THE COMICS!
Publishers of Kansas and Missouri
have petitioned the postoffice depart-
J nient to put a ban on the comic sec
tions that many newspapers send out
in order to conserve the paper sup
ply that much. The whole country
might join in the petition, as the
comic sections serve no good com
mercial or other sensible purpose,
and are as often devoid of amuse
ment as they are of sense or in
struction. True, they amuse the
"kiddies," but if the tremendous out
lay they cost in value of paper is
continued, the comic section is abso
lutely a burden and a useless' waste
of good paper.

SHOULD BE QUABA3TC3HED
Many physicians believe that any
one who has & bad cold should be
completely isolated to prevent other
members of tke family and associ
ates from contracting the disease,
as colds are about as catching as
measles. One thing sure the soon
er one rids himself of a cold the less
the danger, and you will look a good

Remedy to aid you in curing a cold.

First guns have been fired in
Kentucky by the Allied Tobacco
League of America, an organization
formed to fight any move to pro
hibit use of tobacco.
Although Dr. W. A. Gardner, New
York, general manager of the
league, and Emmett Orr, Louisville,
field secretary, have just started en
rolling the 300,000 tobacco growers
of the State, five branches have been
established in Shelby, Fayette,
Bourbon, Harrison and Clark coun
ties, county secretaries being D. T.
Long, Shelbyville; Joseph T. Den
ton, Paris; F.'.S. Jameson, Cynthi
ana, and L. G. Cockrell, Winchester.
Those interested in culture and
manufacture of tobacco have re
ceived information, it is declared,
that since the nation-wide victory
for prohibition, those organizations
which fought liquor will now turn
their attention to tobacco.
.Every manufacturer and grower
of the weed is expected to join the
league as soon as its aims are made
known to opponents of prohibition of
tobacco, say backers of the cam
paign.
The program of meetings covers
every county and community in
Kentucky and the drive will be car
ried into all States where tobacco
cultivated or manufactured.
