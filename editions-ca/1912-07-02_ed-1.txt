Total, 1,088.There was no materialchange in thevote of the candidates on the last ballot, although Wilson, who has beengaining steadily in the balloting sincethe morning session yesterday, lostlittle ground.The last ballot was the forty-second.Speaker Champ Clark reached thelowest ebb of his candidacy on the ballot where Wilson reached the crest.He went down to 422 votes 'at thistime,but immediately began to pick upuntil he had 430, when ajournment wastaken. The hmh water mark of Wilson vote was reached on the thirtyninth ballot, when he received a totalof 501 1-2 votes.That the delegates are tired of voting and are earnestly desirous that theconvention come to an end is apparent.During the session to-night the delegates sat in a soit of stuper. The rollcall clerks entered the vote mechanically, often without waiting for response from the various States. Atthe end of the fortieth ballot a tiredAlabama delegate offered a motion foradjournment, when the Wilson forcesdemanded a roll can ttne motion wasJwitdarwn. By the time the fortiethballot was taken there was seeminglyno. hope of a nomination to-night.BALTIMORE, July 1. The Democratic convention was again the centerof animation to-day and from an earlvhour the crowds began to besiege at 9o'clock. The galleries were thrownopen to the general public withouttickets or other credentials and theywere immediately filled to theircapacity. The delegates were slow inarriving. The weather was moderately warm, but the convention hallwas kept comfort ble by the breezeth a fluttered through the large transom. The conditions are mnre comfortable than those of Friday and Saturday. Eager interest was everywhere manifested in the struggle about to be renewed and specultion was abundant asto whether the deadlock : would bebroken and on the possibility of othersensational coups. The general sentiment which prevailed was that nothing definite had been .done to bringabout a close to the deadlock and ifanything the lines were even tighterthanbefore. vWhen Chairman James entered thehall and ascended the platform he wasgreeted with an enthusiastic round ofaDplause and he introduced the chaplain of the day who pronounced theinvocation. As the chanlain concludedhis nrayer Mr. Bryan at the head ofthe Nebraska delegation entered thehall and the audience wildly cheered.Chairman James appealed to thegalleries and all guests of the convention to refrain from delaying the business of the convention by applause orother interruptions and a resolutionwas passed to appoint a committee torequest an extension of time on thereturn coupons of rilroad tickets heldby the delegates of the convention.Many of the delegates held informalcaucuses in their sections of the convention hall where the events sinceSaturday were discussed and the controversv .netween Mr. Bryan and Mr.Clark was the uppermost subject ofconversation. In all corners of the hallmen engaged in heated debate.The twenty-seventh ballot showedbut little change in the' vote, ClarkJeading by a margin of 62 votes, withthe gathering of a vote here and thereon each ballot, while those in the rearlost a few, Wilson being the leader onthe thirtieth ballot and the announcement of the vote was a signal for wilddemonstration.When the total of the 33d ballot wasannounced a large banner was sprungon the floor bearing a quotation of Mr.Bryan indorsing Mr. Clark's characteras irreproachable. The crowd at oncestarted a demonstration and Mr. Bryancame to the platform to address theconvtntion K. The, crowds cheeredmadlv and the Chair is pounding vigorously for order without effect. Thedemonstration is gradually sunsidingbut the crowd is still wildly excited.The convention adjourned to conveneat 8 o'clock.What seems to be the largest crowdof the convention gathered in theArmory. The band being disDensedwith since. Saturday night and theband "stand was jammed with spectators.The doors of the hall wxre closed at3:30 o'clock and the jam on the outsideof the ball was terriffic.

The evidence isaccessable.The Lawrence. Mass., strike revealed that the men, women and childrenworkers in the woolerf milla the mosthighly protected ot all the'industriesreceive $5, $6 and $7 a week wages forfull time. The Stanley committeeshowed that the workeis in the blastfurnaces of the steel mills the secondmost highly protected industry worktwelve hours a day, seven days a weekand are miserably treated and underpaid. And now conies the most damningrevelations of all. in the report of theNew York Factory Investigation .commission, showing that there are 296,000women at work in the highly protectedfactories of New York cities, and Jthatthe average weekly wage of theseworn en toilers is $3. The proprietorsof the factories told the investigatorstime and again'that they used womenin place of men wherever possible, "asthey are cheaper, and do not strike forbetter wages orconditions."The report of this commission hasbeen verified by independent investigators employed by a big New Yorknewspaper. Here are some of thewnvs the factory andjnil! owners"prctect" American workingmen :Bovs' fingers, when cut off in"punch" machines in the metal working shops, are'quoted at $300 ; amputated singly they are worth $150.Women, some gray-haired, stand inthe slaughter houses uten hours daily,stripping pork and making sausages.Women, some young andothers old,workt core-makingiVthe steel 'millsand iron foundries, and breathe thepoisonous carbon monoxide gas liberated bv ovens in the same shops.-Women polish marble with corrosiveacids in manv of the marbleshops,workthat would tax the strengihof robustmen.Women, as a rule, work immediatelyb 'forehand within two weeks afterthey give birth to children, that theymay supnort the little ones after theycome int) the world; they cannotafford to lay off.Many thouasnds of children arelegally employed long hours, doing thework of adults. Children can do someclasses of work as fast as men, andthey work much chaper, their wagesbeing $3 and S4 a week. In one factory the entrie output is the work ofchildren, the only adult about the placebeing the owner.Query : The manufacturers who usetheir help this way receive excessiveprotection on the plea that they desireto "protect" their emploves.
