From thewooden frame to the crown the road is Jbuilt exactly as a first-class pike jshould be built. Several of the modelswill bes ent out this imonth.Besides this there are enlarged pho-tographs of actual roads "before andafter" 'improvement, the series showing the social and economic benefits ofgood roads. Some of the photographsare of conditions in Kentucky. Onepicture shows children going to schoolover an old-fashioned knee-deep mudroad, and its companion exhibits children going to school over the sameroad improved. It so happens thatimprovement in the road and theschool building were contemporaneous and the pictures bring out this significant fact.Another from the cotton belt showsa team of mules drawing a wagonwith difficulty, laden with two balesof cotton. Its companion pictureshows this road improved, bearing awagon laden with a half dozen bales.A striking pair of pictures presents aphysician's buggy stalled in the mire,and a horse also mired, and they hearthe legend that the physician was delayed, the patient died and the funeralhalted by the mire.(wrF$Jtf ' St-W&zkThe Goods of Quality HouseJewelers and Diamond DealersINATURAL GAS SOONTO BE AVAILABLE.The largest crowd that ever assembled on the grounds of the BourbonCounty Agricultural Society to witnessthe fourth day exhibit was present yesterday.

Horron is themost spectaculai-3-year-old now on theturf, inasmuch as in his six starts thisseason as a 3-year-old he has not beenbeaten. His six victories includeamong them the Hamilton Derby, andhe has all told earned $9,430 this season, with the exception of Gowell hebeing the largest winning: 3-vear-oldJ on the American turf.Horron was a clever 2-year-oldlast season, winning five races in tenstarts and earning $2,298. This makeshis earnings to date $11,710, which isquite a snug sum for a performer inthese days before his 3-year-old careeris even near over. It is surely a creditto Imp. McGee as a sire to have out inin one season two Derby winners likeDonnerail and Horron. As the formerwill also race at Louisville this fall,as well as Gowell and Buskin, withthe arrival of Horron the four greatDerby winners of this season will bequartered next month at the two Louisville courses. Turney has also entered in the Falls City Handicap, hisother good 3-year-old, Kleburne. -O. H.
