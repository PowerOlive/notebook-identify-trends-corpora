VlmKMSPCHAPTER IThe train stopped at Sidington justlong enough to have a trunk thrown offand allow one passenger to alight Thetrunk was mine the passenger myselfThen the train went on again the engine puffing and hissing in a vain attempt to acquire suddenly the greatestspeed seemingly in great impatiencethat it had been compelled to stop atall which was not to be wondered atfor when I gazed around from what Icould see Sidington was nothing morethan a station house a few miles ofrailroad and a wide stretch of hillycountryThere was a young fellow of about myage standing in the doorway ofHe was regarding me withevident curiosity I stepped up to himWhere is the station agent I askedbrieflyWhy Im the agent the fellow replied in drawling tonesIsnt there any town here or at leasta settlement Is this sweeping myarm around in a comprehensive gestureis this all there is of SidingtonYou kin see about all there is fromhere the agent replied with a grinThen to my surprise he stepped outt on the platform locked the door andput the key in his pocketAre you going to leave the stationI inquiredYes No use stayin around Thereaint no more trains till three oclockwhen a couple of coals pass This aintmuch of a stationBut whats to be done about my luggage I asked impatiently pointingtoward a large trunk and several bundles at the upper end of the platformThe agent looked in the direction Iindicated Oh thats all yours is itI thought maybe it might be Gotchecks I supposeYes certainly Here they areHe took the checks gazed at themdoubtfully for a moment then slowlywent to the pile of luggageI guess its all right he said aftertalcing the checks from the various articles of baggage and carefully comparV1ijjthemwiththe ones I had given- fhEffi5BPYoVldn take em aldngNow the trunk was large and heavyand I turned on the fellow with a touchof anger for at first I thought he wasmaking game of me But when I sawthe expression of stolid indifferenceon his face it struck me he was simplydull and stupidThank you I finally said It isver3r kind of you to allow me to takemy own property Perhaps you willshow further kindness by telling mehow I am to take it The bundles Imight possibly manage but the trunkas you see is large and I can assureyou heavy and I really should prefernot to carry it if any other way of removal might be devisedFor a moment it seemed to me theblast of sarcasm produced an effect forjust a shadow of a smile appeared onthe agents face It lasted but an instant however and the blank starewith which he had viewed my belongings took its placeWhere you wanter go he finallyasked in an indifferent mannerI would like to go to Nelsonville ifthere could be found a way to get mytrunk there too I repliedSo youre goin to Nelsonville nefavored me with a quick searchinglance which was immediatelv withdrawn when he caught my eye Nelsonvilles about three miles from herehe continued Taint much more of aplace than Sidington You aint gointo stay there are youI was about to answer sharply thatthat was my business but remembering the curiosity that the advent of astranger generally causes in the mindsof country folks I told him my planswere not definiteTaint that I wanter be impertnent he went on with a grin but Ithought if you was only goin to staythere over night you might leave yourtrunk in the stationWell I had intended to spend two orthree months possibly longer insonville It depends altogether on howI like it So you see I must have my1 trunkTwo or three months He gazeddown at the track for a moment andthen turned quickly toward me asthough an important idea had justcome to him- There aint no hotel at NelsonvillePraps 3rou didnt know that he saidIt will make no diirerence to me 1have made arrangements for accommodation You see I am going to occupya portion of my own propertyOh you own a place there thenYes the old Nelson homestead ismine It descended to mc from mygrandfather Abram Nelson He hasbeen dead 18 years I have not seen theplace since I was quite a small boythen And now as I have plenty ofleisure the desire is natural to revisitthe scenes of boyhood daysThe agent listened to my wordsand I-was considerably amused to note theinterest they inspired an interest I-thought then due wholly to a countryfellows curiosityIf I have told you all you wish tofcnow about myself I went on willrtcPyrieht 1896 by J B Llppincott Coyou kindly tell me as a return favorwhere a team can be procured to cartme and mj belongings over to myplaceThe fellow grinned at me as thoughthere had been something in my wordsof an amusing nature but finally he didgive me the desired informationWhy I guess maybe Jake Hunsickerkin take you over Hes just gettin inthe oats but if you pay him praps hellleave the oats be long enough to driveto Nelsonville and back Anjway hekin take you after supper if you wanterwait till thenAnd where does Mr Hunsicker liveI askedThe agent pointed to a clump of treeson the summit of a hill about a quarterof a mile distant You kin see just apart of the roof through the trees Theroad runs uphill right past the houseHow about these things while I amgone Will thej be safe I inquiredOh yes no onell take em Itll beall right he replied indifferently asthough he did not care whether my luggage would be secure or not Then hegave one more glance at me grinned inhis dull way sprang from the platformand went off down the roadAll the country for miles about Nelsonville had been familiar to my boyhood But now after an absence of 18years I could hardly recognizethis partof itThe railroad had been built some fiveyears before and that made in itselfa great change The station was in avalley and the fertile fields and darkgreen forests on the bounding hills wereall very beautifulBut as there were few houses andthose in the distance there was aloneliness about the place which seemedto find a counterpart in my life ForI was a social Ishmael an outcast burdened with the suspicion of a crime ofwhich I was innocent The fact thatnothing could be proved against me inthe minds of most people only indicated that I was such an adept inroguery as to be able to cover up allproof of my guilty v v ii3It was now a year that the cloud haftrested over my good name The firstsix months of this time I had vainly attempted to live down the general suspicion But I found the houses of eventhose I had considered true friendsclosed against me and so heart soreand almost despairing I fled to Europehoping to find partial f orgetf ulness orat least a rest from cruel tongues Unfortunately for my peace Americansread the newspapers and I had only tomention my name to my countrymenwhom I met during my trip abroad tobe asked if I was the one whose namewas mentioned in connection with thegreat bank robbery in Philadelphia Isoon tired of this and of being compelledto tell over and over again the circumstances of that affair so resolved to goback to my native land avoid the citywhere I was so well and so unfavorablyknown and seek rest and peace amidthe scenes of my childhood I also determined after my arrival to begin athorough investigation of the robberyon my own hook The reason I hadnot done this before will be stated laterThe solitude of Sidington the lackof a welcoming hand the knowledgethat I had outgrown all boyish estimates and would therefore find the oldhomestead no longer encompassedabout by the romantic interest whicha youngsters mind was able to conjureup all this did not tend to raise my depressed spirits and my heart was heavywithin me as I plodded tip the longdusty hill toward the home of Mr HunsickerA delicious breeze was blowing at thetop of the hill and I paused a momentunder the shade of the maples to baremy perspiring brow to the cool influenceThen I slowly walked up the shadypath leading to the porch keeping myhat in my hand I hoped Mr Hunsickerwould be at the house for dinner forI determined not to go out into the hotfields to search for himA knock at the open front door causedan interruption in the clatter of disheswhich proceeded from an inner roomand very soon shuffling footsteps approached the doorA tall stoop shouldered individualdressed in a brown cotton shirt blueoveralls and cowhide boots loomed upout of the gloom of the darkened roomsFrom the look of astonishment on themans face when he saw me 1 judgedthe advent of a stranger was a rare occurrence to this householdWill you haul me and a trunk toNelsonville I askedMy question produced a blanker starefrom the old f el Tow and his jaws whichhad been busy masticating a mouthfulof food ceased operations I gave himtime and when he had partially recovered from his surprise again addressed himDo you understand English IaskedAch indeed he replied after he had hastily swallowed thef oodAnd is your name Hunsicker JacobHunsicker I continuedHe nodded a replyTHE BOITRBON NEWS TUESDAY FEBRUARY 15 1898The station agent down at the depotsaid that perhaps I could get you totake me over to Nelsonville Will youdo itV ell bud vere just at de oats MrHunsicker saidI am willing to wait until after supper which will not interfere with theharvesting You will be well paid fcr3rour troubleHereupon the rather shrill voice ofa woman came from the inner roomShe spoke in Pennsjlvania Dutch butI was able to make out that her wordsconveyed a command for her husbandto comply with my request She alsoadded that he should not offer to do thework too cheaplyI smiled as I recognized in this oneof the provident traits of a PennsylvaniaDutch farmers wifeIll pay you well I reiteratedI guess you should gif me feeftycent Mr Hunsicker said in a doubtful manner as though he really didnot expect to receive that amount butwas determined to get all out of methat he couldIt is settled then tliat you take meover Well not quarrel about the termsAllow me to rest here under the coolshade the remainder of the afternoonand give me some supper and you shallhave a

acknowledgedmy salutation by coming forwardI guess you haf no dinner she saidin a hospitable wayThe truth was I had had none andbeing rather healthy I was not sorryto be ushered to the table where Iwas bountifully suppliedDuring the meal the woman favoredme with many searching glances whichI attributed to her curiosityAfter I had finished my repast weagain returned to the front porchYou have a

was standingand gazed earnestly into my faceAch Gott Its true she exclaimed clutching my arms Its Nellittle Nel Ach Gott I knew itThen her excitement ended in a floodof tears I gazed down at her in astonishment and as I looked recollection came to meWhy surely I used to know youI said smiling down upon her Youmust be Sarah You used to work atGrandfather Nelsons when I wag asmall boy and took

theacquaintance just where it had beenbroken off 18 years ago and seemed imbued with an augmented adoration formeI felt there was one true loyal soulin the world whom I could depend onand in the natural desire for sympathyand consolation I recounted to her allmy troubles including the circumstances connected with the bank robbery and the suspicion under which Ihad groaned in spirit for a year

effected in the Paris post officemuddle appeared in yesterdays Leader under the following capiionCompromise between John L Bosleyand Sherman H Stivers SenatorDebceDecreed ItThe compromise between EditorJohn L Bosley and Sherman II Stiversfor the Paris postoflice by which theformer becomes postmaster and thelatter his deputy is naturally disappointing to Mr Hutchcraft who expected to becme deputy under Bosleyand to Miss Bashford who expected tobecome deputy under StiversRepublicans who returned fromWashington to day say that while Senator Deboa person illy desired to appointBosley he greatly disliked to rejectJudge Dennys indorsement of MrStiversAfter the Senator had withdrawnhis indorsement of Stivers and practically committed himself to Bosleyfgreat pressure was brought to bear onhim from Kentucky to reconsider andJudge Dennys insistance on the recognition of his recommendation as rpfereeadded to the embarrassment of thesituationWhile matters were in this condition Stivers went to Washington andCounty Fayette to Chas J Bronston J the fignt grew more incenseCounty and Kenton to WilliamGroebel Count And whats thematter with having an Allen O MyersCounty and a Col Hez Lung CountySenator Deboe who has had an unenviable task in trying to adjust differences between factions and reconcilethe general obligations of the partyorganization in Kentucky with thosenaturally growing out of the senatorialelection listened with patience to thepersistent appeals of the friends or Bosley and StiverFinally Senator Deboe took the bullby the horns and suggested that thetwo candidates compromise one takingthe postmastership and the other thedeputyshipOf course Messrs Bosley and Stivers demured to this arrangement andeach insisted that he was entitled tothe appointment without conditionsSenator Deboe insisted that as compromises and concessions were theorder of the day in so many other contests he saw no reason why the Parismat r should not be settled in thesame way relieving him of his embarrassmentThe matter continued in this hapeuntil Saturday when the Senator announced as his ultimatum that he wouldfill no recommendation until Bosleyand Stivers agreed to the compromisesuggested and if one agreed and theother refused he would appoint the onewho was willing to accede to the agreementThis was heroic treatment and it didno take long for the two contestantsto come to the conclusion that the obstinacy of either would result in theother bagging the game Bosley heldout the longest and made a final personal appeal to Senator Deboe bu thelatter insisted that the compromisewas for the best interests of the partyand refused to yield anything from theposition he had takenAnd this is the way Messrs BoJeynd Stivers adjusted their rival claimsand came home with half loaves intheir pockets to the natural disappointment of the worthy people whohad hoped for a deputyship under oneor the otherWiile he Boeley Stivers compromise carries its personal disappointments it is un joubtedly a wise political move as it cl ses up the partyranks All who took part in the contest recognized that bo h men were deserving in the highest deg ee Bothhad been strong McKinley men in theprimary contest in Ken In tiecounty district and state conventonswhich sent delegates to St Louis bothrendered valuable service to the McKinley cause and the friends of bothrightfully thought that hey were entitled to recognition Under the circumstances the compromise insistedupon by Senator Deboeis a happy oneand should make the Laity stronger inBourbon countyNew

andyeen them give up the chase and turnback when he came upon an old ricketyeoverert wagon standing at the edge ofa belt of timber near a little watercourse He was about to pass on without giving the

MEALSAo Other Food Varied Qnite so Mncbin CompositionMuch has been said and written relative to the use of cotton seed meal as acattle food Nearly all investigatorsagree in giving it a high value and urgedairymen to use this material not onlybecause it is a cheap source of proteinbut because it also has a high manurialvalue Practical feeders differ greatlyin their estimates of cotton seed mealSome seem to use it very satisfactorilyfor awhile and later conclude that thefeed is not well adapted for their purposes Occasionally a feeder observesthat the health of his animals is affected by the feeding of cotton seed toofreely and it sometimes happens thateven after animals have been led formonths with apparent success thatthey are injured by its continued useIt has also happened that cows fedupon cotton seed meal do well for atime and that later the milk flow isdiminished -without any apparentcauseThere are at present no other concentrated feeding stuffs which vary somuch in composition as cotton seedmeals from different sources and different mills Within three weeks theMaine agricultural experiment stationhas examined samjjles varying from 22per cent to over 53 per cent of proteinThis great variation in different lotsof cotton seed meal may explain thedifferent estimates of different practical feeders and of the same feedersat different times If a cow is fed acotton seed meal containing 2G percent protein and is then fed an equalweight of a meal containing 52 percent it is evident that the amount ofprotein which she receives will havebeen doubled by the change If ahe hasbeen fed up to her full capacity in thefirst instance such an increase mightresult disastrously On the other handchanging from a cotton seed of highprotein content to one of low proteincontent would diminish the milk flowunless the amount of meal fed is alsocorrespondingly increased RuralWorldTHE MODERN CHEVIOTIt Is a Compact Well Formed andProfitable SheepThe distinctively local breed of
