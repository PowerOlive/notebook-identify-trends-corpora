A SONG OF FORGETTING
The hours as playthings were ah me
And laughter lived in every word
What time that love was young and glee
Id every pulsing heart throb
The wild plum blossomed in the glen
The rabbit raced across the plain
And frightened birdlinjjs flurried when
Our hounds and horses tramped the grain
Down In the grove beside the spring
We rested when the race was won
And listened to the wood bird sing
A lullaby when day was done
But ah you wandered from my side
And paved the long lone lane of years
With memory stones and lorn too wide
For sobs to soothe with memory tears
And now you eome come back to me
To fill as then the old time place
Where is the magic of your plea
What change has come upon your face
Oh friend to lose and still love on
To live on chaff instead of grain
Is better than to feel love gone
Forgetting is the keenest pain

CHARLES STEWART PARNELL
now the Great Irish Leader Came to
Enter Politics
Charles Stewart Parnell was 28 years
old before he made his entry into the
political arena How the step was takea
is tnus Qescrioea Dy ant n Darrj
OBrien in his biography of the great
Irish leader
One night during the general elec
tion of 1874 Parnell dined with his sis
ter Mrs Dickinson in Dublin After
dinner Captain Dickinson said Well
Charles why dont you go into parlia
ment Why dont you stand for your
native county
To the surprise of every one at the
table Parnell said quickly I will
Whom ought I to see
44 4Oh said Dickinson we will see
about that tomorrow The great thing
is yon have decided to stand
44 4I will see about it at once said
Parnell 1 have made up my mind and
1 wont wait Whom ought 1 to see
44 41 think Gray of The Freemans
Journal said John who was also pres
ent
44 Very well said ParnelL rising
from the table 4I shall go to him at
once Do you come with me John
The two brothers then went away to
gether It was now 11 oclock and they
found Gray at The Freeman s office
He was amazed when Parnell entered
and said 1 have come to say Mr
Gray that 1 mean to stand for Wick
low as a Home Ruler
It was only the year after that on the
death of John Mitchel Parnell was re
turned for Meath At first it is plain
that Parnell had few if any followers
The ability of the representative from
Meath was questioned Butt was then
the controlling power It was only in
1880 that Parnell became the leader
Bruges
The chronicles of 1456 speak of 150
vessels in its basins and of German mer
chants carrying away over 2000 pieces
of cloth to the distant lands of Russia
and Poland It was the exchange of Eu
rope possessing in the fourteenth cen
tury 52 guilds and 150000 inhabitants
more than three times as many as i
now contains Among its wares we read
of leather from Spain wool from Eng
land silk from Italy and Persia linen
and cloth from Brabant hemp and flax
from Holland wine from Portugal
T -
Greece ann trance ana man ware from
Germany which included every variety
of object in ivory bone wood glass
tin copper lead iron silver and gold
It had its factories its curriers its dy
ers and its taxation considerably ex- j
ceeded that of Ghent But at the com-
mencement of the fourteenth century its j
troubles began troubles from within
and from without
The fcrueue was rendered useless by
the invasion of sand as far as Sluis
Ecluse treachery slaughter and po
litical jealousies and rivalries completed
the fall and in 1544 its inhabitants had
diminished to 7 696 Then came the re
ligious wars and persecutions from 1567
to 1584 the fanatics and the Gueux de-
tor the
Words
French revolutionists Good
The Swina Parliament
Switzerland differs from other coun
tries iu many things and one of the
most remarkable is the way in which
its parliamentary debates are conduct
ed A Swiss member of parliament can
express himself in French German or
Itnliau and the privilege is freely used
When the president of the federal as
sembly speaks in German his remarks
are translated by a secretary in close
proximity to him AH the laws and
resolutions before being voted upon
are drawn up in French German and
Italian and every official report is pub
lished iu these three languages Bir
mingham Post
Making It Clear
Somebody has discovered that a Ber
muda onion eaten raw will clear the
head A Bermuda onion eaten raw will
do more than that It will clear an en
tire room An active Bermuda onion is
a complete clearing house all by itself
Take one Bermuda onion only one
and let the lips of beauty close upon it
and Jove will turn to hatred and honey
to gall and bitterness
Clear the head Why a Bermuda on
ion in fairlv good health will clear the
head of navigation Exchange
The Germans have introduced what
amounts to slave labor in their east
African colonies Each native village
must furnish a certain number of in
habitants to labor for the imperial gov
ernment on plantations or elsewhere
without pay
A man who is overskrewd in his
business relations is pretty sure to learn
in the course of time that the world is
shrewd enough to protect itself against
him Somerville Journal
