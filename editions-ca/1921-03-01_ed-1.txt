The other, perhaps, is causing her wakefulness and her highfever. If you will place your fingersin this position, Dr. Nesbitt, you willobserve the misalignment."Dr. Nesbitt agreed with the diagnosis. "And now," said Dr. Berger, "tospring them back into place."The chiropractor's strong handsexerted pressure upon the child'ssmall back. There was an audiblesnap.

Toxic smoke candles,recently developed, will have an extensive use in future wars, In the opinion of L. I. Shaw of the internal bureau of mines, who recently spoke on"Smoke and Incendiary Material" before the Franklin institute."Smoke candles, so called," he said,"are small cylindrical boxes which areignited by some sort of friction device, and which contains smoke producing mixtures. Their use is in setting up a smoke screen close at hand,for after ignition they are simply seton the ground, not being thrown orprojected in any way. The need Isvery apparent to make the movementsof small groups of men close at handpossible.Tried by British."The British, early in the war, developed very satisfactory smoke candles which were used by all the allies. The Americans also developed acandle which was satisfactory, butwhich did not get into production anduse In France before the armistice.The smoke is normally white, musthave maximum capacity and be coolenough to prevent the setting up ofair currents end thus rise from theground. It must be heavy so as to bedisplaced by the minimum amount ofwind at low velocity. These requirements are admirably met by candleswhich produce a smoke consisting ofzinc chloride."As regards the future of incendiarymaterial, my own opinion, which opinion, however, is substantiated by atleast some of the military critics, isthat incendiary material, except forsmall arms and long range shell anddrop bombrf, will have at least a limited and, perhaps, no use. The flameprojectors will probably never be usedIn a future war. Smoke material, onthe other hand, will have a very extensive and ever-increasing use. By theuse of the smoke screen during an attack the casualties can be largely reduced. New Use of Smoke.There was in progress of development by the British and Americansduring the latter part of the war smokecandles which would give a toxic -smoke.The toxic material employed was diphenylchiorarsine. Diphenylchiorarsine is a solid which vaporizes in the heat of the candle andis obtained in such a state of divisionthat it will penetrate most gas masks.Such toxic smokes, of which there willprobably be others developed, will finda very extensive use in the future. Itis the greatest step made thus far inthe new use of smoke."CATS DO NOT RECOGNIZE MILKRefuse to Drink Strange Liquid inHungary Pet Dogs TurnVagrants.Budapest.

ManyGermans have asked for the privilegeof using the library, but this has beendenied, as the army did not think itadvisable. One Genuan told the librarian he had lived many years inAmerica and should really be allowedto have books, because he was anAmerican "in principle."Experts Hunt Among Freshmen forMaterial for Likely Journalistsand Machinists.Madison, Wis.

Thesetests will be given for several successive years to determine whether It ispossible to discover latent newspapertalent through psychology tests.The system of giving psychologicaltests, instead of regular entrance examinations to students who wish toenter a university, has been tried inseveral universities. The idea is thata student who has a good mind, buthas Insufficient or Inferior high schooltraining, may be advised as to thelines of study for which he is bestfitted.In this regard, the University ofWisconsin is giving more specific teststhan most other universities. By giving a dozen or more tests for the sameresults, the psychologists at the university are determining which testsare best. In a small series of testsalready conducted, however, the results do not correspond well with thescholastic records of the studentstested.LuckytrikecigaretteIts toastedcp a-t"fnta- wGIANT FROM NORWAYWireless Waves Bent by Coast Lines.It has been suspected for some timethat electric wa"es are refracted bythe shore lines of large bodies of water.

Remember the dayswhen you went to the maple sugarparties? Well, maple sugar time Ishere. The sugar and sirup industryis American and offers good commercial opportunities. Only the. UnitedStates and Canada produce this muchprized product on a commercial scale,which is at once a delicacy and ahighly nutritious article of diet.Warm days and cold nights are essential to a satisfactory flow, and thesugar content may vary considerablyfrom day to day. Tapping of sugartrees if done properly in no way injures the tree. Trees have beentapped for more than 100 years andare still in good condition.The maple is well up among theleaders In the American Forestry association's vote for a national tree.Early Tapping Is Favored.Tap early in the season, says a general bulletin, to obtain the earlierruns, which are generally the sweetest, and therefore the best producers.Makers have lost half and even moreof their crops by not being preparedfor the first run.In general, the association pointsout, the season Is ready to open during the first or middle of FebruaryIn the southern section and later inthe northern regions when days arehecoming warm when the temperature goes above freezing during theday and at night below freezing. Ifthe days are very bright, warm,- andsunny the sap will start with a rush,but soon slacken, or If a high windstarts the flow is checked.A thirteen thirty-seconds of an Inch(13-32 inch) bit is often used. Its direction should be slightly upward into the tree, the slant allowing thehole to drain readily. With an ordinary tree the hole should not beover one and a half to two inchesdeep at the best.Apparatus for sirup and sugarmaking does not necessarily represent a large outlay. A number of sapspouts, either wooden or metal, areneeded. The sirup Is usually gathered in buckets.From ten to fifteen trees usuallywill yield enough sirup for familyuse to make tapping worth while, andIn many cases will afford a surpluswhich ean be sold at a remunerativeprice. The flow of sap depends uponthe age, condition and habit ofgrowth of the trees, also upon thecharacter of the weather and condition of the soil during the sap-flowing season.Figures as to Yields.In a good season a tree fifteeninches In diameter will yield sufficient sap to make from one to sixquarts of sirup, which in turn can beconcentrated into two to ten poundsof sugar. Larger trees under thesame conditon will produce correspondingly large yields of sirup andsugar. Ail hard maple trees, eightinches or more in diameter, may besafely and profitably tapped for sirupand sugar production.This Industry is not confined to circumscribed areas in New Englandand New York. There are many "sugar bushes" throughout eastern andnortheastern United States and southto Include North Carolina and Tennessee; west to northern Missouri, Iowaand Minnesota.A considerable number of mapletrees of a sugar-yielding species arefound In Washington and Oregon.Mount Zlon, la. -Seventy-fire yearsago Daniel Reneker brought Mary, hisbride of a few days, to Iowa fromOhio.

Sneezing In a classroom atMassachusetts Institute of Technologydraws the gate for the offender.Orders from Dr, George W. Morse,head of Tech's new medical department, instructed members of the faculty to send sneezers and coughers directly to the school clinic, where theycan be taken care of.The epidemic of Infectious colds, theorder says, has brought the doctors tothis drastic step. Not only those whogive audible evidence of the possessionof a cold through a cough or a sneeze,but even those who, perhaps throughan over-red nose, apparently are In thegrip of the thing are to be sent to Doctor Morse.It is surprising to read in the dailypapers of treatments that our forefathers and grandmothers used forcoughs, colds, catarrh, and bronchialaffections. It impresses the writerwith the fact that jnodern scientificresearch had not advanced an iota,when as a matter of fact, there havebeen wonderful advancements in thetreatment of all diseases and conditions that bring on disease. Just because grandmother used old-fashionedmustard blisters for relieving coldsand congested conditions it is no sanereason why we should resort to theold antiquated methods when therehave been such wonderful improvements and new discoveries of remedies which are far more effectiveand less painful to use.SPECIAL NOTICE: A druggistsaid the other day that a customercame into his store and inquired fora mustard plaster and he suggestedto the customer that they try MINTOL as a more modern treatment forcongested conditions. The customeraccepted the druggist's suggestionand in twenty-four hours the samecustomer came into the druererist andsaid: "How long have you handledMINTOL?" The druggist repliedthat he had been handling it for somelittle time and the customer franklystated that he would never use amustard cream or plaster for colds,coughs, or any congested conditionsagain. There are thousands ofothers who would say the same as thisdruggist's customer did, if they wouldonly try MINTOL.
