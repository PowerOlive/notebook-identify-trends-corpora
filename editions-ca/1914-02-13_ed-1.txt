B. Lott, of Hancock county,providing for a liquor license commission of three members, in eachcounty of the State. The measureprovides that the members of each ofthe 120 commissioners shall be appointed by the Geovernor and thatthe commission of each county shallpass on all applications for license tosell liquor in that ounty, includingcities. The pay of the commissionersshall range from $1,004 each in counties containing first-class cities, to$100 each. xThe measure provides that a fiatlicense of $1,000 a year be chargedeveryone engaged in the retail ofliquor, whether in the city or county,half of that amount to go into theState Treasury. It provides that saloon license shall not be tranferableand prohibits more than one saloonlicense to one persv?n. It refuses licenses to brewers. A petition for alicense must be signed by 25 per cent,of the bona fide housekeepers in thevoting precinct in 7nich the saloonis to be conducted, a. remonstraceto be effective, must be signed by 50per cent, of the nearest 100 householders to the proposed saloon.It is further pnmaed in the measure that it shall be unlawful for asaloon to be open between the hour?of 10 p. m. and 6 a. m.

The provisions of the billmakes it unlawful for any person inthe State of Kentucky except railroademployes and indignants to ride onfree passes.&-IXB.mBill Come and buy one whilethey last.Dr. William Kenney, who 'for thepast four years has been a member ofthe City Council from the SecondWard, last night tendered his resignation which will become effective onMarch 1. The action taken by Dr.Kenney was necessary in view of thefact he will move his place of residence from the Second Ward to theHinton farm in the country, which he'has leased with the view of conducting a dairy.The resignation as presented byDr. Kenney was to become effectiveat once, but the Council in accepting,decided that it should not becomeeffective until the first of March andthat body will at its next gularmeeting on February 26 elect his successor. There was little business of importance before the Council. Mayor Hinton took occasion to laythe law downto the police officers regarding theirconduct while on duty, and which wasto the effect that no officer while onduty should drink intoxicating liquorsor enter a saloon for the purpose ofloafing. The official made it veryplain that this law must be strictlyadhered to by the members of thepolice force.A resolution was ordered and passed by the Council providing all fineshereafter assessed shall be paid onlyto the Police Judge and-that at theend of each month a record of thefines replevined shall be turned overto the City Attorney for collection andthe Police Judge retain a receipt forFRANKFORT, KY., Feb. 12.

Shecompletely swept the Legislature offits feet by her eloquence. Not onlydid her eloquence appeal to the members but the indisputable facts sheadducted were equally as impressive.By a vote of 24 to 12 the Senate,after long debate Tuesday, passed thebill of Senator Frost to strengthen thecounty unit bill by providing that apetition for a local option election issufficient if signed by 25 per cent, ofthe voters of the county instead of 25per cent, of the voters of each precinct, as now required.4ifrrhll & Rlakpmnrp.m - --- yThe Store for Men's StylesiParis, Kentucky$3151315!I mmRmmstmrmimmmmmmtmiu KUttMOimiitmHUfnfmvuaiiai 4&Fa .1 FRANK & COThe Store Where Reliability Reigns.Rthe same to be filed with his monthlyreport to the board.

FBrannon, Robert Link, a grocerymansuffered a fractured craill, from theeffects of which he is confined to thpMassie Memorial Hospital, and JohnMasterson, the other principal, war-hot in the side, the wound not being a dangerous one.The trouble was the result of illfeeling between the two men whiclhad been engendered over the settlement of an account. This occurredon Monday, and Tuesday morninrlhey met and settled their differmces, both being apparently satisled. Later in the morning, howeverhey met again, when the argumen'vas renewed, but bystanders inter'erea and prevented a clash.According to the story of Link hevas standing at the bar in the act oraking- a drink when he was structin the head either with a pistol orlunt instrument. When he fell tche floor he pulled his revolver and)uened lire, one of the bullets takingeffect in Masterson's left side, inflicting a slight flesh wound.Three shots were fired by Lnk, it i?-aid, as he arose from the floor whenMasterson grappled with him. Theyvere separated by Patrolman GeorgeTudy, who was on the scene after thirst shot was fired. Link was bleed'ng profusely from the wound in hisiead, and Masterson seemed to besuffering considerably from thewound in his side. The latter wasvaken to the office of Dr. Gilkey, andhis wound was dressed. An examinalion of Link's injury revealed a fracture of the skull, and he was taken tothe Massie Memorial Hospital, where'Dr. Barclay, of Lexington, and DrsKenney, Brown and ttankin trephinedthe skull. He is doing nicely and unless complications arise recovery isbut a matter of a short time.At the Hospital Tuesday afternoonLink recounted the arair and told ofsomeone striking him in the back of-the head, tnockng him to the floor,and while in a half-dazed condition hesupposed he drew his revolver andfired several shots. The blow on theback of the head caused the fractureA w?rrant was issued by Judge E.B. January against Masterson, charging him with shooting with intent tokill, and a similar warrant was issuedagainst Link.

The latetinier and early spring styles showhe wide popularity of trimming3 ol.roid, fringe, passementerie andjeads.Braid is used most effectively in thedevelopment of the stunning suit il-ustrated on the second figure. Thematerial used is taupe eponge. Thecollar and cuffs are of white broadcloth, solidly braided with black Hercules braid. The bouffant skirt hashe front draping caught up by a shortpanel, which is also braided. A widesash of Roman silk adds a note of color. 0 0u&The Accentuated Hip-Line and theHiflh-WaW Effect, WitH the ShortPeplum Worn. Outside the Skirt,Are the Marked. Fashion. Tendencies. The trimming of a dress, the liningi or the sash is by tar the most important factor of the modern costume.woman may don her husband'say flannel shirt, if it is lined with abrilliant contrasting silk which peepsout alluringly at neck and sleeves andpocket. A white serge, or broadclothsuit is infinitely more smart for theaddition of a lining of cerse, brighti green or black satin.The growing preference for plaid inone's costume has spread rapidly. Itjis used in a variety of ways to suitthe individual taste or tne wearer.Plaid collars, cuffs and pockets ofplaid will rejuvenate last year's dress,and a broad sash of it can only beeclipsed by its cousin, the Romanstripe.There are plaid waistcoats whichlighten a dark serge or broadclothsuit In an attractive way; in fact,waistcoats are a welcome addition tothe majority of the tilted jackets,which are the ultra style. The vestshave been worn a great deal duringthe winter with suits of broadcloth,duvetyne or serge. Brocaded oneswere worn with many of the dressiersuits. At a Dansant the other nightI saw a young woman wearing awhite crepe dB Chine waist with aseparate skirt. Over this waist shewore a waistcoat of bright Spanishyellow, cut on the lines of a man'swaistcoat even to the strap in theback.Fringe is extremely stylish,- especially that made from threaded beads.It is seen around tho edge of a tunic,like the fringe on a lamp-shade. Onthe bottom of panels and the stylishapron fronts it may be from 6 to 10inches in depth.Beads are a trimming which arevery popular. Beaded motifs offlowers may be bought to trim theyoke or bertha of a waist, even theruffles on a skirt.Beaded nets are used for tunics onevening dresses. The raw edges areleft unhemmed, or they may be finished with a picot edge. This Is doneat almost any shop vThere accordeonpleating is done. .One very attractive net for a dressor its trimming was beaded with crystals and now and then a leaf composed of fine jet beads.In one of the leading stores I saw ablack drew wkieh. waa made of -a cooa-biratiott of faille 6te teiae aod' eKameiMavmill ii i 81 A,W 111ill IP 1117 Ills I fll !

Premet, the Parisiancouturier, has used tliis very cleverlyas a new and unusual ornament tosome of his latest blouses and cots.A fantastic monogram would be an attractive substitute for the crest.Faille de laine, Bedford cord, maeltaBse and gabardine are shown amongthe materials suitable for one-piecedresses and spring suits.The first sketch shows a' dress ofwide-wale Bedford cord. The simplicity of this mode, is the secret ofits smartness. The long shoulderseams of the bodice remind one ofthe dresses worn during the CivilWar. The flat collar and cuffs are ofbrocaded silk. A noticeable, stylishfeature is that the waist is worn outside of the skirt. The wide tucks between the hips and knees Is the onlyadornment of the smart skirt.
