"STARTING LIFE EASY," SAVs "
WRITER OF PLAYS.
Clara Lipman, .who, with Samuel
Shipman, has written the new comedy
of modern life, called "Children of
Today," in which Mr. Louis Mann will
appear at the Ben Ali Theatre, in Lex
ington, Monday, Oct. 27, does not be
lieve in treating vital subjects too lu
gubriously. "Life is an extremely serious thing
and I do not mean to say ttiat it ought
to be looked upon with trifling eyes
by any means," she added, the other
day. "But I do think any great, po
tent idea ought to be presented to the
public in a sympathetic manner and
with as light a touch as it is possible
to give such things.
"You know," she went .on, "it is
very easy to write seriously. There
is no special difficulty in making peo
ple weep in the theatre. Take, for in
stance this subject of the younger
generation. It istlie most vital sub
ject of the moment in America. The
American children have no youth
whatever. The times are such, that
they are born with complete knowl
edge. They come forth into a world
of science, electricity, wireless, me
chanical toys and dear Heaven knows
what eles besides. They do not know
how to play, and as a result of' all
they have the most decided ideas
about everything under the sun. Tell
me, what is going to be the remedy
for this?
"I know how it was
Lease. My wonderful
long before her time,
weighted down with
questions that are the topics of the
moment nowadays, and she had no
one to pour out her thoughts to but
me. She did this unconsciously, per
haps, but she placed a great weight
upon my shoulders and so for many
years, when I suddenly realized what
Tuesday from 2 to 5 p. m., in honor of life was, I was extremely unhappy.

"Of course, that is a thing of the
past, for I know life now, and have
some poise and a point of view, but I
could see so much unhappines all
about me in the younger generation

kind of a play about it. But if I ptft
on such a play it would probably last
about two weeks, if it lasted that
long."
