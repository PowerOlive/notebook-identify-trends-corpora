United State Goksll Survey I
Report Containing Records of Flow it
of the Ohio and Tributarec. j '
The water supply of the United
States is undoubtedly its greatest sin
gle mineral resource. The stndy of
water resources is therefore one of -"he
most important governmental in
vestigations. The United States
Geological Survey has been making a
systematic study of the rivers and
other water supplies in the United
States and during me last 18 years
has published nearly 350- reports pre
senting the results of this work. Per
haps the most useful phase of the
work is the measurement of the How
of streams. Records of stream flow
are absolutely essential to any intel
ligent river development, whether it
bo in the interest or navigation, of
flood preventon, or irrigation, of lani
dranage, or of power development.
In a report just issued by the Survey
dealing with the surface supply ot
the Ohio River basin Water-Supply
Paper 303 attention is called to tho
importance of long-time records of
stream flow, inasmuch as all river
vary greatly from year to year. Ex
perience has shown th"afr such records
should cover all stages from abso
lute maximum to absolute minimum
and should embrace periods of 5, 10
of for some streams even 20 years.
At first glance these may seem ex
cessive lengths of time for the sim-
Pie determination of a rivers caoacitr
but when the vast interests involved
in river development are consderef
it will be recognized that great caxb
should be taken to obtain trustworthv
( information.
. In developing inland navigation the
Federal Government alone has ex-
ipended in the neighborhood
of $300.-
uuu.uuu, and prospective expenditures
will apnroximate or exceed this sum.
It is obivious that the determination,
of stream flow is necessary to the in
tellgent direction of these large dis
bursements. A thorough knowledge
of stream flow, both in the contribut
ing areas and along the great lovr
lpnd rivers, is the first necessity.
The flow doinage in the United States
is estimated to be in excess of $100,
000.000 annuallv.-the Ohio River basin
being particularlv subject to flood3, as
in the spring of last year.
Wser-Snnnly Paper No. 303, cover
