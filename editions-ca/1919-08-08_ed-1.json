VERSAILLES MAN IS REPORTED
MYSTERIOUSLY MISSING
m
(F-sc-pl TF-oct 1)
The city and county authorities
have received notice from Versailles
and Lexington to be on the lookout
for Mr. Collins Bradley, manager of
the gas company's plant at that
place, who is reported as mysterious
ly disappeared. At the time of his
disappearance Mr. Bradley had in
his possession about $400, and it is
feared that he may have met with
foul flay.
Bradley is married and has one
child. A telephone message from
Lexington stated that no trace of
the missing man had been found. He
is described as being about six feet,
two inches in height, of slender
build, weighing about 140 pounds,
has blue eyes and brown hair.
One by one the veterans of the
Civil War are yielding to the stern
decree of death, and are surrendering
to the mightiest conqueror of all.
This thought was brought out by the
news that reached here yesterday of
the death of Capt. Ed. Taylor, a for
mer resident of Paris, and a well
known Confederate veteran, which
occurred at the Confederate Home, at
Pewee" Valley, Wednesday night, fol-.
lowing ail itlness 0f two years.
Capt. Taylor during his residence
in Paris, conducted a dry goods store
on the corner of Main and Third
streets, the site of which is at pres
ent occupied by the A. F. Wheeler
Furniture Co. His wife preceded him
to the grave many years ago. Capt.
Taylor at the outbreak of the Civil i
War, embraced the cause of the Con
federacy, and enlisted in Company
C, of the Ninth Kentucky Cavalry,
under General John H. Morgan, and
followed the fortunes of that great
raider through the varying fortunes
of war. He served with distinction
and gallantry, and rose to the rank
of Captain in the service, which in
honoring him was itself honored. He
was a man of culture and intellect
ual attainments and had a host of
friends here who regret to learn of
his passing away. After leaving the
army Capt. Taylor again embarked in
business in this city, and in later
years was a traveling man for a large
Eastern wholesale house. Of late
years he has been a guest at the
Confederate Home, with comrades of
former days, where his declining
years were spent in the peacefulness
of a ripe old age. For many years he
was a prominent figure at all the
Confederate reunions and was highly
esteemed by all who knew him.
Capt. Taylor is survived by one
daughter, Mrs. Carrie Taylor Chase,
of Danville, and two sons, Ira G.
G. Taylor and Edward Taylor, Jr.,
both of Lexington.
The body was brought to the home
of his grandson, Mr. Hubert Chase, in
Lexington, where the funeral will be
.held at ten o'clock this (Friday) )
morning, with services conducted by
Rev. E. T. Edmonds, pastor of the
Woodland Avenue Christian church.
The body will be brought to this city
for interment on the family lot in the
Paris Cemetery beside that of his
wife. The pall-bearers will be A. W.
Macklin, G. S. Byrns, J. E. Keller, C.
F. Estell, R. M. Redd and Jacob San
dusky. Members of the John C.
Breckinridge Camp, United Confeder
ate Veterans, of Lexington, of which
Capt. Taylor was a member, will ac
company the body as a guard of
honor.
LYNE RANKIN.
Mr. Floyd Rankin, who conducts
a grocery on Second street, in this
city, and Miss Elizabeth Lyne, also
of Paris, secured a marriage license
in Lexington, Tuseday, and were
married in the office of the County
Clerk by Magistrate Charles N. Par
rish. After the ceremony, Mr. and
Mrs. Rankin returned to Paris, where
they will reside.
