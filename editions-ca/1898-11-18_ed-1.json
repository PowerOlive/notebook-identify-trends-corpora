Hotv Grant Ran
In September 1875 there was a re
union of the Army of the Cumberland
at Otica N Y at which President
Grant General Sherman General
Hooker General Slocum and Governor
Seymour were present
Long and loud cries arose for Grant
Grant who slowly rising from his
chair expressed his pleasure at being
with his friends but his dislike at be
ing asked to speak and his diffidence in
doing so
But there are those he added dry
ly pointing to Sherman and others
who are not troubled with any sort of
diffidence
The three generals present made wit
ty telling speeches and then arose cries
for Seymour Seymour
The governor who had been the de
feated Democratic candidate against
Grant for the presidency in 1868 came
forward and said
I think I have some soldierly traits
myself At all events General Grant
you must acknowledge that in a little
contest you and I had a few years ago
you ran a great deal better and farther
than I did
This telling allusion to the presi
dential contest brought down the house
General Grant convulsed with laugh
ter rose and bowed his acknowledg
ments Youths Companion
At Wlint Age Is Man Strongest
The muscles in common with all the
organs of the body have their stages of
development and decline Our physical
strength increases up to a certain age
and then decreases Tests of the strength
of several thousands of people have been
made by means of a dynamometer
strength measurer and the following
are given as the average figures for the
white race
The lifting power of a youth of 17
years is 280 pounds In his twentieth
year this increases to 320 pounds and
in the thirtieth and thirty first years it
reaches its height 356 pounds At the
end of the thirty first year the strength
begins to decline very slowly at first
By the fortieth year it has decreased
eight pounds and this diminution con
tinues at a slightly increasing rate until
the fiftieth year is reached when the
figure is 330 pounds
After this period the strength fails
more and more rapidly until the weak
ness of old age is reached It is not pos
sible to give statistics of the decline of
strength after the fiftieth year as it
varies to a large extent in different in
dividuals Strand Magazine
GOLDENROD
I know a field a sunny field
But not in sunny France
And there is neither glint of Bhield
Nor gleam of pennoned lance
Nor does the wind toss knightly plumeg
Nor silken tents unfold
And yot in autumn it becomes
The field of the cloth of gold
For when the haze of summer days
Has melted from the skies
And we without reproof may gaze
Up into heavens eyes
A host their plumes and banners shake
In joust with breezes bold
And goldenrods bright champions make
Tho field of the cloth of gold
The butterflies with blazoned winga
Are heralds for the fight
And many a lovely lady flings
Her token to her knieht
And so amid their gorgeous suite
With pomp and wealth untold
Summer and autumn royally meet
On the field of the cloth of gold

or Government Money
At close of our Civil War in 1865
there appeared in the London Times
the following
If that mischievous financial pol
icy which had its origin in the North
American Republic during the late
Civil War in that country should be
come indurated down to a fixture
then that government will furnish its
money without cost It will have all
the money that is necessary to carry
on its trade and commerce It will
become prosperous beyond precedent
in the history of civilized nations of
the world The brain and wealth of
all countries will go to North America
THAT GOVERNMENT MUST BE
DESTROYED OR IT WILL DE
STROY EVERY MONARCHY ON
THIS GLOBE
The famous Hazzard circular to
capitalists in New York and the Buell
Bank circular to United States Bank
ers both emanating from London and
the fabulous corruption fund raised in
England and Germany estimated at
1500000 were the agents that se
cured the closing of our mints against
silver
The walk into my parlor policy
of England during and since the
Spanish War is the latest evidence
of English Diplomacy in shaping the
destiny of the United States Govern
ment
Notwithstanding the famine price
of wheat the Spanish War and fabu
lous expenditures of money by our
government during the past year gold
has increased in value eleven per cent
and all other values decreased in the
same proportion
For a thorough understanding of
the money question or silver issue
the Cincinnati Enquirer has uniformly
given evidence of its ability to teach
explain and produce all facts and
truth It is a paper that ought and
can be read by all classes with pleas
ure and profit
