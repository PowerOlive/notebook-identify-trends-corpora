The employment conference, called by the President, did an enormous amount ofgood, and idleness has been largelyreduced as a result of the co-operationin industry brought about bythe exchange of views and educational influence of the conference.With fifty-five per cent of the population urban and but forty-five onthe farms, it is pointed out . thatsome means must "soon be taken looking to an " amelioration of the hardships of farm life, and an increase offarm profits, or food products willraise to' such prices as will make national legislative measures, alwaysto5 be objected to wheiT passed. intheinterests of a special class, a nationalnecessity.

There are greatbreeding farms in 'New Yok, Virginia,California and elsewhere, but th"very life blood of the thoroughbredcause pours from Kentucky's everflowing fountain. In this favoredState, with-its fertile fields deep inbluegrass throughout the winter, thehorse reaches perfection.The Rider and Driver does notknow of any greater calamity thatcould happen to the horse industrythan for Kentucky to turn against thethoroughbred, -and destroy the greatbreeding industry, which has not onlymade the State world-famous,, buthas aided every farmer in Americaby improving the breed of horses.The War Department has repeatedlygone on recoid in favor of the thoroughbred without which the Armywould not have suitable remounts.The Remount Service, in charge ofUnited States Army officers, has established breeding farms with thoroughbred' stallions at their head,horses that have had their speed,courage and endurancce tried in contests on the turf. These great nurseries will provide the type of cavalry horse that the Army needs, andevery farmer in t.hls country cannotonly aid the cau?e by sending hismares to thorouglibred studs, but canbe assured of reaping a substantialprofit, as the War Department is constantly in the market for horses ofthis character.Racing in Kentucky under the di--rection of the Kercucky Jockey Clubis not only a creoit to the State, butwith the pari-mutuel system perfected, it has set. an example to the worldin point of high class contests, cleanracing generous stakes and purses. Under the ola order, the meetings weredragged out to an interminablelength, in one year one hundred andfifty-five days, and in another yearone hundred and seventy-four.Under the State Racing Commission, created by an Act of the Legislature, the number of days on whichracing is permitted has been cut toone hundred and eight. There isstrict supervision of all turf matters,with the result that beginning withthe Kentucky Derby, with $50,000added, which has been run atChurchill Downs for forty-seven years,the quality of racing in Kentucky setathe standard for the whole country.Formerly turfmen raced for $400purses, and the amount distributedyearly ran from $800,000 to $600,000.Since the organization of the-v Kentucky Jockey Club, three years ago,the amount distributed daily instakes and purses averaged over$11,500, and the yearly total was asfollows :1919 S 997,190.001920 1,200,800.001921 1,281,085.00Ten.
