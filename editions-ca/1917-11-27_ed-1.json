Since the death of his wife, a few
years ago, he has spent much of his
time with his children. A few
weeks ago he buried a son, Mr. C. L.
Mitchell, of Paris. He was a life
long member of the Christian
church, and was held in high es
teem by all who knew him. He is
survived by one daughter, Mrs. Lan
caster, of Cincinnati, and four sons,
Messrs. Frank Mitchell, of Shakes
peare, Russell, Morton and Edward
Mitchell, of Millersburg. Inter

Mrs. Belle Taylor, aged fifty,
died Friday, at 7:15 a. m., at her
home on Vimont street, after a lin
gering illness of a complication ot
diseases. Mrs. Taylor was born in
June, 1837, and was a daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. George King, and was
one of a family of several children,
all of whom have proceeded her to the
grave, except one sister, Mrs.
Browning, of Cynthiana, who is a
confirmed invalid of paralysis.
In 1857 Miss Belle King was
united in marriage to Mr. John
Thomas Taylor, and with the excep
tion of two years when she resided
in Missouri, her long life has been
spent in Millersburg. Five daugh
ters and one son were born to this
happy couple. In 1875 Mr. Taylor
died after a brief illness of pneu
monia, leaving a widow to provide
for six children.
This is one of the most prominent
families of our community. For a
number of years after the death of
Mr. Taylor, Mrs. Taylor conducted
a millinery business in her home.
Some twelve or fifteen years ago she
opened one of the most popular
boarding houses in Central Ken
tucky, and it was a success. Her
tables were laden with the good(
uiiings oi me marKet, which were
calculated to satisfy the appetites of
the traveling public in every par
j ticular. She was a lifelong member
of the Christian church, and during
I her active days was a member of
its various societies. She had been
in failing health for the past three
years, but in the midst of her suf
fering she had a smile and a kind
word for everybody. She fought the
battles of life bravely and was vie
torious. Last September, when she
realized that the end of her pil
primage was fast approaching she
closed her boarding house. From
that time she grew slowly worse un
til the end came. She Is survived
by one son, Mr. Richard Taylor, of
St. Joseph, Mo., five daughters,
Mesdames S. H. Creighton, of
Indianapolis, Ind., K.' B. Hutchings,
of Lexington, Ky., T. D. Judy and
M. Taylor Long, and Miss Mary H.
Taylor, of Millersburg. The funeral
was held Sunday at 2 p. m. from her
late residence, with services by her
pastor, Eld. C. O. Cossaboom, with
interment in MillersDurg Cemetery.
Quite a number of friends a'nd rela
tives were present from all the sur
rounding towns.
