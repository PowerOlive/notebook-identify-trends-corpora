To-day among the laboringpeople can be found the very highesttype of citizenship, the purest of religion and the happiest of homes.rAt no time in years has such unity'existed among the people of our'country as exists to-day, and he whowould attempt to stir up prejudice between classes in order to further hisown or his friends political aspirations should be treated with the utmost contempt by every true Americlass of citizens.I have confined my publications aswell as my conversation to my owncandidacy. I have made no reference to the short-comings of otherseither real or rumored. I have madeno utterance against any citizen orclass of citizen.I have to the very best of my abilty been absolutely fair to all othercandidates in my suggestion for officers of election, asking for the appointment of no man except those inwhom I had the utmost confidence.My record as a member of. theParis Board of Education is openfor inspection. I do not claim to havemade no mistake in the discharge ofthese duties, but I do claim to havelabored faithfully and fearlessly for'the best interest of the institution atall times. Our books have beenaudited yearly, and were audited bythe City of Paris at the beginning ofthe present administration.As chairman of the Building Committee, my books are open for inspection and will show the exact disposition of every cent placed in myhands. It has been a profitless job,but I am glad to have rendered theservice. I do not ask your vote forhaving rendered it, as I was onlyperforming a duty which everycitizen should be willing to perform,but I mention it-only as a precautionagainst any eleventh hour chargeswhich may have or may appear.I repeat that I have made no statement aginst any citizen or class ofcitizens. I have made no promise ofemployment or favors to anyone. Iam free to solicit your support andinfluence with nothing to hamper mein the faithful discharge of theduties of the office, and I brand anystatement intimating that I have everdiscriminated against any honest, upright citizen or citizens either byvoice or deed, as absolutely untrue.(It) M. PBALB COLLIER.TOTHE DEMOCRATIC VOTERSOF BOURBON COUNTY:Those who have read the recentpublications of my opponent for theoffice of Sheriff, must have notedthe unfair insinuations containedtherein with reference to my candidacy. I have solicted and still solicit thesupport of all classes of Democratswho believe me to be an honorableand upright citizen. If among mysupporters there be "a clique" or aman seeking "to dominate and dis-tate," I can at least say that that"clique" or that "man" has never influenced me to commit a dishonorabledeed, nor have they influenced meto make unfair statements about myopponant or conduct my campaignm an ungentlemanly manner.In another article it is insinuatedthat I will let outside business interfere with my sworn duty as Sheriff, althoug hi have repeatedly pledged myself to personally and faithfully perform the duties of the office.I believe my record as a privatecitizen and as a business man justifythe voters of my county in believingthat if elected to the office of Sheriff, I "will fulfill the promises madethem during the campaign, and Ibrand any statement intimating thatI am trying to secure the office under false pretenses as not only unfair but untrue.Before my announcement for theoffice I made arrangement, in caseof my election, to retire from theactive management of the BourbonLumber Company, in which concernI am interested. I do not expect tosell my interest in this business because I have never had any politicalplans beyond the next four years,expecting at the end of my term, ifelected, to return to private life.I would call your attention to thefact that we are not members ofany "clique," nor are we seeking theadvancement or overthrow of anycitizen or group of citizens. NeitherMr. Thomas or myself have ever before asked for a county office. Mr.Gilkey was your Assessor for severalyears and we are proud of his recordas such. Since retiring from the office of Assessor, Mr. Gilkey has forfour years been third man in the office of the Sheriff on a very smallsalary.I ask only fair play and a cleanelection. I believe the officers select-PEARCE BATON NAILS LEES REGARDING "SHORTAGETO THE DEMOCRATIC- VOTERSOF BOURBON COUNTY:There has been circulated by various persons, who are friends of myopponent, a scrurrilous and untruestatement wherein thev stated that Ihave been short in my accounts withthe btate of Kentucky.lms false report was started onlyfor the purpose of doing me damagein a political way, and in order tostart same, the report of the Stateinspector and Examiner was distorted.As Clerk of the Countv Court itis my duty to collect upon all deeds,mortgages, marriage licenses, etc., acertain tax for the State of Kentucky, and this money, together withall license money collected by me, Iam required to report and pay to thebtate Auditor at the end of each thirty days.During the period beginning- July1, 1917, and ending the latter partot 1918, nearly my whole time wasrequired on the Bourbon CountyDraft Board. I n'esrlected variousduties of my office that were not absolutely necessary to be then performed in order to give my serviceswholly to my country. I did notmake my reports monthly to theState Auditor during that period, asrequired by law, but, before failingto perform this duty, I wrote to theState Auditor explaining to him hownecessary it was that my time begiven to the Draft Board, and theState Auditor in reply told me to attend to the duties imposed upon meby the war first, .and then I couldmake my reports later. Upon thisinformation I did not make these reports beginning July 1, 1917, untilJuly, 1918. The State Inspector andExaminer checked my office duringthis period and, in his report statedas follows:"His services upon the Draft Boardhad made it impossible for him tomake his reports promptly."All monies due the Commonwealthof Kentucky were paid by me in fullas soon as I obtained the necessarytime to make out these reports andsend them to Frankfort.Since the close of the War theoffice of the County Clerk has againbeen examined by the State Inspectorand Examiner, and in this report,which was filed with the Governor ofKentucky on April 3, 1920, the Inspector and Examiner made the following report:"The Examiner found the recordsin the County Clerk's office in Bourbon County in splendid shape; therecords pertaining to public mombeing complete." " VFor the service upon the DraftBoard the United States Governmentoffered me the sum of Twenty-fourHundred ($2,400.00) Dollars. ThisI refused to accept. Therefore it isevident that I neglected the duties ofmy office, not for any pecuniarybenefits, but for the good of mycountry only.Not only did I do this for mycountry during: the War. but T rmchased Liberty Bonds, and borrowedthe money to pay for them. I contributed to each and all of the Welfare and Red Cross drives during theWar, and I am reliably informed thatmy opponent during this time,neither contributed services or purchased bonds and gave but one dollarfor the Red Cross.I believe that in the time of burcountry's peril my first duty was towards my country rather than to thefilling out and sending in my monthlyreports to the State of Kentucky.If there are those who believeotherwise, then I do not want theirvote. v .I want neither the friendship "norvote of any man or woman who didnot, at that time, put the call of hiscountry before his private business.If there are those who now blame'andcriticise me for the omission of thisduty, then I gladly accept the blameand criticism and carry them withpride.PEARCE PATON.oFOR RE-ELECTION,r7JR K B- JANUARY P0RMAYOR OF PARIS.FOR MAYORD.

Helaunched into his subject at once, giva fine verbal exposition of what theplan as advised by the CooperativeBurley Tobacco Marketing Association would mean to the farmer andthe grower, and giving his views ofthe plan from a banker's standpoint.Mr. Kehoe's address was a carefully prepared and well-deliveredpiece of work, as he went minutelyinto details, and showed beyond areasonable doubt where the farmerwould be benefitted by organization,and set better prices for his tobacco.He told in a graphic way of theslump in prices on the South Carolina markets, and asked the farmersand growers of Bourbon county ifthey wanted to see those conditions jrepeated nere. ie was lunuwcu uyseveral local speakers, who told ofthe desire to have the farmersorthe county all in one organization,and of the good that could be accomplished in obtaining better marketsfor their tobacco.At the conclusion of the addressescalls were made for signers to thecontracts affered by the Associationplan, which was responded to by alarge number. It is safe to say thatnearly seventy-five per cent, of thetobacco growers of the county arenow members of the Association unahave signed the marketing plan contract, which will mean a great dealto the county in the fall when thelocal markets open for business.The latest reports from the localcommittee in Bourbon county, ofwhich Samuel Clay is chairman, indicates that that county is approaching the required 75 per cent, of theoutput in pledges to the proposed organization, -more than three millionpounds having been pledged in contracts signed during the past twoweeks.

REDMON HISDONE FOR THE TAXPAYERSREAD THE CORRES- iPONDENCEAbout July 15, 1920, Mr. LeoSmith, Assistant to the State TarCommission, came to the office of theTax Commissioner of Bourbon Couty, Kentucky, and said that we hadto raise all real esate from 6 to 10cents, and that transfers must beput in at 90 per cent, of their actual,cost price. I fought this with allmy power because I thought ourpeople were taxed high enough, andas to transfers, 90 per cent, of thactual selling price was an injustice,because if a man paid $400 an acrefor a farm I was to take it at $360an acre for taxable purposes. Thaman that did not sell right over thefence was in at $100 to $125 at theoutside. I told him I would not dait. He then said, "I will fire youfrom the office." The following letters from the State Tax Commissioner will explain the rest:STATE TAX COMMISSIONOF KENTUCKYFrankfort, July 23, 1920.Mr. Walter Clark,County Tax Commissioner,Paris, Ky.Dear Sir: We are just in receiptof a letter from our Assistant StateTax Commissioner, Mr. Leon Smith,in which he reports to us that he hasvisited you an.d looked over the wotkin Bourbon county in regard to thassessment of property being madunder your supervision at this time.It is only fair to you to say thatMr. Smith says that in his opinion,you, personally, are undertaking todo your duty as County Tax Commissioner and assess the property as?required under the law, but thatyour Deputy, Mr. Redmon, persistsin refusing to perform his duties Incomplying with the orders and rulings of the State Tax Commission tohave the property assessed at a valuenot less than 90 per cent, of itsactual cash value. From the information obtained we are advised thatMr. Redmon, who is "acting as yourDeputy, refuses to increase a singleperson, regardless of what valuation,the taxpayer places thereon, but insists that he was intending to assessthe property on the books just as itwas last year. You can imaginethat we are very much surprised atthe attitude of Mr. Redmon. He attended the conference of the CountyTax Commissioners as being a gentleman who knew his duty, and hadthe courage to perform any dutiesdevolving upon him as an official ofthis State. Based upon this information, some action must be taken inthe matter at once.We desire to call your attention toSection 2, Chapter 11, of the Acts of1918, which says:"Each County Tax Commissionerherein provided for may, with the approval of the State Tax Commission,appoint as many sober, discreet,capable persons not under the age oftwenty-one years, as deputies to assist him to discharge his duties, ashe may deem necessary, and may remove them at his pleasure."If for any reason, political or otherwise, Mr. Redmon is not disposedto do his whole duty on behalf of theState and the taxpayers of Bourboncounty and assess the property ofthis county as required by law, youshould not have appointed him as aDeputy, and if you have so appointed him, you should remove him atonce. So far as the records of thisoffice show, you have not recommended Mr. Redmon or any other Deputyto assist you in the assessing ofproperty of Bourbon county thisyear, and this Commission has not approved the appointment of Mr. Redmon, and if our records are correctwe would not approve his appointment under these circumstances. Willyou please advise this Commissionby return mail whether or not youhave requested the appointment andapproval by this Commission of Mr.Redmon as such Deputy, and if not,we must request that he be relievedfrom duty until such appointmenthas been approved by the Commission as required by law.Will you please acknowledge re-"ceipt of this letter and advise the ;Commission that you have compliedwith the requests contained herein,in relieving Mr. Redmon from dutyas Deputy County Tax Commissioner.Yours very truly,STATE TAX COMMISSION.By Rainey Wells, Member.(Copies of letter written to Mr.Walter Clark by Rainey Wells, Member.)

Why its phenomenal success? Why do we hear soy much about it? And why has this preparation so far out-stripped allother medicines of its kind? mThe answers to these questions is easy and can be explained in justone word merit. Tanlac is scientifically compounded and representsyears of work, study, experimentaiton and research by. some of the foremost chemists and pharmacologists of America.The Tanlac formula is purelyethical and complies with all National and State pure food laws. It ispurely vegetable and is made fromthe most beneficial roots, herbs andbarks known to Materia Medica. TheTanlac Laboratories are among.thelargest and most modernly equippedin this country.Ten Ineredients in Tanlac .Altogether, there are ten ingredients in Tanlac, each of which is of"recognized therapeutic value.In referring tome of the more important ingredients of Tanlac, theEncyclopedia Brittanica says:"Ie has been the source of the most. valuable tonic medicines that haveever been discovered."In referring to other of the general" tonic drugs contained in" Tanlac, then 13th Edition of Potter's Therapeutics, a standard medicine textbook,tates that "they impart general toneand strength to the entire system, including all organs and tissues."This same well-known authority indescribing the physiological action ofBtill another of the ingredients of.Tanlac, which is of value in treatingwhat is commonly known as a "rundown condition," uses the followingexpression:"It is highly esteemed in loss of appetite during convalescence fromacute diseases." .There are certain other elements mTanlac which, because of their influ-ANNOUNCEMENTSence upon the appetite, digestion, assimilation and elimination, improvethe nutrition and vital activity of allthe tissues and organs of the odyproduce that state of general tonicity which is called health.The United States Dispensatorymakes the following comment regarding another ingredient:"It may be used in all cases of puredebility of the digestive organs orwhere a general tonic impression isrequired."There are certain other ingredientsdescribed in the Dispensatory, and inother standard medical texx-Doojss,as having a beneficial action uponthe organs of secretion, whose properfunctioning results in a purificationof the blood streams passing throughthem. In this manner, objectionableand poisonous ingredients of theblood are removed and the entiresystem invigorated and vitalized.Tonic and Bodv BuilderTanlac was designated primarilyfofthe correction of disorders of thestomach, liver and bowels. At thesame time, however, it is a powerfulreconstructive tonic and body builderfor it naturally follow that any medicine that brings about proper assimilation of the food and the thoroughelimination of the waste productsmust, therefore, have a far-reachingand most beneficial effect upon theentire system.

The prices which were paid onthe same markets this year are justabout half of what they were lastyear.Judging by the Southern markets,the prices to be offered for Burleytobacco this year will be lower thanlast year. The growers will nothave a ghost of a chance to makeexpenses unless they organize. Instead of solicitors going through thecounty securing signers in the newmarketing organization, the groweisought to be running all over eachother trying to see how quickly theycould get a contract.When the growers are organizedthey will be in the position in whichthey can be compared to the nest ofhornets which the old colored manwsa asked to disturb.

Ifstrangers felt the charm of her rarecourtesy and joyous, sunny temperament, how much more the fond parents upon whom she lavished all thesweet earnestness and careful culture of her mind and nature. Strongand potent was the influence of thisloving heart which gave of its giftsso generously. The spirit of herdaily life was love for her parentsand for her friends. Gently, almostunconsciously it coerced to thosecoming in contact with it, to strivefor if not to attain the realization ofher high ideal.Miss Ball is survived by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Charles S. Ball,of Paris, her grandmother, Mrs.Clark, of Danville, two aunts, Mrs.Rebecca Simms, and Mrs. Lipscomb,and six uncles.The funeral will be held at thefamily home at three o'clock, to-morrow,(Wednesday) afternoon, withservices conducted by Rev.
