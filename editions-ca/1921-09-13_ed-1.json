Cecil B. De Mi He's Production
'SomethingtoThinkAbout'
A picture that peers deeply into human hearts and unfolds a wonderful drama made from the
joys and sorrows of ordinary life. Strikingly different in theme from anything De Mille has
done in the past, but, like his previous splendid successes, sumptuously produced and directed
with the genius of a master. An inspiring entertainment treat ! ..
