would turn; one beautiful fountain of
comfort they had, which soothed the

felt morbid and downcast and punk,

Geutry, Mo. Rev. D. M. Spencer,
who lives on a farm near here, has a
Bible that he made himself, the re
markable part of this achievement be
ing that he has been blind since ho
was two years old. The homemade
Bible is the result of seven winters'
work and is written in the Braille
type used by the blind.
He employed a young woman to

Caipenter work is among the many
things he has done to earn a living
and a few years ago he built a three
room cottage for his family, doing
all the labor without assistance. He
was born in Princeton, Mo., in 1S55,
and educated in the St. Louis School

speaker and preaches with a thor

ROBBED OF $75 FOR "JOKE"
Although Money Is Returned to Him
Man Threatens to Make
Trouble.
New York. A holdup and robbery,
planned and carried out as a "joke,"
nearly caused some serious trouble
for a certain young man of Bayshore,
L. I.
Edvard L. Valentine,, a merchant,
closed his store shortly' after midnight
and started to walk home, in a dark
section of Smith street he was sud
denly confronted by a man with a
handkerchief over the lower part of
his face. The man held a pistol to
Valentine's head and demanded his
money. Valentine gave up ?75 in
cash and the man vanished.
v Valentine felt sure he recognized
the voice of the man, however, and
in the morning he told his suspicions
to his friends. They were contem-
, plating police action when in the eve
ning several young men called Valen
tine out of his store and engaged him
in conversation. When he returned to
the store he found his $75 lying on
the counter.
He hasn't yet seen the point of the
"joke"' though, and threatens trouble
for those with the overgrown- sense
of humor.
MAD BULL HAD HIS REVENGE
Bovine Viciously Attacks Auto and

Business.
Des Moines, la. The sheriff of a
county in Iowa was driving his auto
mobile, containing, his family, along
a country road, when he encountered
a vicious bull which had escaped from
its inclosure. The bull at once gave
battle to the auto, and. although the
sheriff put on all power and . tried to

run the bull down, the animal met it
valiantly, and so vigorous was his at
tack with his horns that they,not only
put the machfnery out of business but
upset the car.
All the occupants were thVown out
and some were badly injured. Satis
fied with wrecking the machine, the
bull went his way Avith dignify and did
not deign to attack any of the mem
bers of the sheriff's family.

Vancouver, B. C. H. W. McGregor,
a Vancouver timber cruiser, and Steve
McAllister, while cruising timber in
the Queen Charlotte Islands for a
Vancouver firm, were returning to
camp when McGregor stepped into a
bear trap.
Like a flash the steel teeth closed
on his foot, crushing through the top
of a heavy shoe, two thicknesses of
woolen socks and into his ankle.
His companion and he tried to
break the steel vise, but to no avail.
At last, with the only weapon in their
possession, an a'xe,-;the bolts on the

WEAR WOOD SHOE!
Forest Footwear Popular in an
Indiana Town.
Hoosier German Settlement in Which
a Wooden Shoe Factory Has Been
Conducted for More Than
Forty Years.
Huntingburgh, Ind. In the town of
Ferdinand, this county, many of the
older generation of Germans wear
wooden shoes. Clemens Luecken of ,
Ferdinand is a master carver of wood
en shoes and. his tiny shop is the mec
ca for Germans in quest of forest foot
wear. Dubois county is overwhelm
ingly German and many of the cus
toms of "der vaterland" are observed
with as much fervor as though. Dubois
county were actually ruled by the
kaiser. One of the customs in vogue
at Ferdinand is the wearing of wood
en shoes and for more than forty
years Clemens Luecken has conducted
a wooden shoe factory in the little
town.4
Not for one moment in all that time
has Clemens Luecken allowed the
leather trust to worry him. The soar
ing price of shoe leather ,has no ter
rors tfor Mr. Luecken. As long as
birch and poplar timber can be se
cured "Der Holtzschumacher" will
never care a rap whether Uncle Sam
corners the leather trust or the leath
er trust corners Uncle Sam. Leather
is an unknown quantity with Mr.
Luecken. He specializes in the manu
facture of wooden shoes and the fact
that he has been engaged in the busi
ness for more than forty years is proof
enough that the demand for wooden
shoes is pretty steady and that Clem
ens Luecken delivers the goods.
The shop wherein Mr. Luecken has
worked at his trade for so many years
is situated on a hill overlooking the
little town of Ferdinand. The build-
Luecken's Wooden Shoe Shop.
ing is a low frame structure 12 feet
square and occupies a site in the cor
ner of the garden adjoining his home.
The little building is well supplied
with light there being three windows,
a door and a skylight.
The floor of the shop is covered
with wood chips. Tools such as are
used by a skilled wood carver hang in
orderly fashion about the walls. In one
corner of the room stands a very small
stove. His work bench in another cor
ner consists of a six-foot log some 10
or 12 inches in diameter resting on
four sticks of wood. In the center of
this rudely constructed work bench is
a groove. One cannot but admire the
skill of the old German when he first
shapes a block of wood to conform to
the foot. He holds the block of shoe
wood on a large oak block and
wields a keen edged hatchet with a
degree of accuracy that is amazing.
"Wood chips fly in all directions with
each stroke of the hatchet. Gradually
the block of wood assumes the form
of a shoe. The block is then placed in
the groove and an auger-like tool is
used in boring out the interior of the
shoe. The boring process continues
until theN interior is rounded out to(
conform to the shape Qf the foot. After
the interior and exterior of the shoe
are smoothed out it is ready for the
wearer.
The shoes are made according to
the length and breadth of the foot as
computed by inches. The host of pa
trons whom Luecken supplies with
wooden shoes every year includes
men, women and children. In price
the shoes range from 45 to 65 cents.
Shoes made of birch come higher be
cause they last longer than those made
of poplar and other wood. Luecken
can turn out several pairs a daj'. In
addition to supplying the regular chan
nel of trade he sells hundreds of wood
en shoes to visiters who buy them as
souvenirs. Luecken says that the
young American has never formed the
habit of wearing wooden shoes the
young American prefers tight fitting
shoes made of leather and the painful
corns that go with them. The feet
of those who wear wooden shoes are
never deformed by corns, bunions, etc.
If Luecken does npt have your size
shoe n stock and you are in a hurry
he sends you to one of the general
stores in Ferdinand, where you can
make your selection" from a large
stock. He supplies the merchants
with their stock of wooden shoes. It
is a very common sight in .Ferdinand
to see a patron of Mr. Luecken drive
into town wearing a pair of wooden
shoes. They come from all parts of
Dubois county.

"THE COUNTRY HOY."
"The Country Boy," which Henry
B. Harris will send to the Paria Grand
on Wednesday, February 21, is said to
be one succession of bright lines and
laughs. It fairly bristles with amusing
slang, and it affords an cppjrtunity for
the display of at least a dozen well
drawn character parts. Edgar Selwyn.
is the author.
"The Country Boy," from all ac
counts, is an entirely different kind of
a play from any Mr. Selwyn has ever
written and besides that it is one of
the very best and most interesting
comedies that has been seen in several
seasons. It has comedy of situation
and line; it has cleverness of construc
tion and development, and it has
character drawing of an exceptional
nature; it is clean and wholesome,
though it deals with situations in
which there is an opportunity to call j
things by their right names The story
is interesting and well sustained.
Tom Wilson, a country boy, is am
bitious to make something big of him
self and refuses the offer of five dol
lars a week from the father of the girl
he loves in the small town where he
lives The girl thinks he can find him
self and make or break himself in the
city.and thither she sends him to prove
his worth. There he luoses his position
and the life he leads in a tpyical
boarding iiouse is ona ct the most
amusing features of the play.
Entirely out of money and on the
point of being put on the street by the
mercenary landlady, the boy, in desper
ation, rather than go home a failure,
decides to end his life. But a fellow
sufferer in the boarding house cleverly
brings him to his senses and they de
cide to join forces and start a news
paper in the town from which the boy
hails. The last act tells of the success
of the venture and the happiness of
the hoy with his fiancee, who nas had
faith in him all along.
His Chief Proficiency.
Recently a letter of introduction
was handed by an actor to a manager
which described the presented as an
actor of much merit, and concluded:
"He plays Macbeth, Richelieu, Ham
let, Shylock, and billiards. He playa
billiards best."
Soothing Occupation.
"Who's that man who just kicked
the chair over and threw a pack of
cards into the fireplace?" inquired one
waiter. "Oh," replied the other, "he's
the gentleman who tries to rest his
nerves by playing solitaire."
Truth Mixed With Alloy.
Truth comes to us from the past, as
gold is washed from the mountains of
Sierra Nevada, in minute but precious
particles, and intermixed with infinite
alloy, the debris of centuries. Bovee.
Much Timber in Reserve.
The rich forests of the Caucasus
