BY THE OLD
PROPOSED SYSTEM
OF RURAL CREDITS
Cincinnati , Enquirer.
It is stated that upon the reassemb
ling of the Congress it is the inten
tion to push steadily forward to com
pletion legislation looking to the es
tablishment of rural credit banks
throughout the United States.
This is very commendable, and if
such a system can be devised and put
into practical operation that will ex
tend to the farmers of this country,
especially those of small land holdn
ings, the facilities for. obtaining loans
at fair rates of interest upon long
periods of time it will prove of, im
mense benefit to the country. -
It goes without saying that these
loans must be amply secured if the
system is to be a success and be per
manent. The Congress gave so much consid
eration to the banking and currency
measure; it took such pains and care
to perfect that law; it was so con
servative that is may well be depend
ed upon to pursue the same prudent
methods in preparing the necessary
legislation for the rural credit sys
tem. The farmers of the United States
need such monetary facilities, and
they should have them.
Many of the agriculturists in all
sections are hindered in develop
ment of their lands by reason of the
l&ck of facilities to obtain funds
when needed, but those of the West
and South, stand in tne greatest need
of relief in thiB respect.
Every man who owns land is sub
ject to taxation for local and State
purposes, and, whether the tract he
owns is large or small, he is a con
tributor to the 'country's development
through the tax he pays, as well as
through the work and money he ex
pends upon his lands.
The agriculturists are the great
foundation of the country's prosper
ity, and each one of them is a 'factor
in that prosperity.
These are the men who should be
accorded a monetary system that will
enable them to obtain the greatest
possible results in production through
the use of funds which they may need
in their work of cultivation and
which they can give proper security
for. ?-
They should be freed from excess
ive ., interest rates and extortionate
commissions through means afforded
them to deal directly with financial
institutions that will loan them funds
at fair and reasonable rates and upon
periods of time that will "not involve
honest and industrious persons in
confiscatory foreclosures.
If such a system can be established
in the United States it will result in
unexampled prosperity.
The agriculturists of such States
as Kentucky, Tennessee, West Vir
ginia, Virginia, North Carolina,
Ohio and Indiana would experience
an immense relief and would be stim
ulated to a development of their
lands that would add millions of tons
to the freight of the railways and
the steamboats.
It would cause, a great expansion of
the business of every merchant with
in the territory of the States named
and inure to the benefit of the manu
facturers of the Republic.
The entire country would, he bene
fitted by the increased production of . States will enter an era of the great
the farms, and also by the greater est prosperity.

RELIABLE HOUSE
PARIS FlftM SELLS SIXTY-
SEVEN MULES FOR $13,400.
An evidence of the continued de
mand fOr the Kentucky mule, and
the efforts of buyers from all parts of
the country to secure the best in
the markets of the State, was demon-,
strated a few days ago when South
ern buyers purchased a large number
of high-class mules from the local
stock firm of Caywood & McClintock.
Since this firm embarked in busi
ness about two years ago there has
been a constant drain on their supply
of this class of stock. The reliabil
ity of the firm is unsurpassed and
the fact has gone forth to many
States, resulting in stockmen coming
here and purchasing mules in large
numbers for the markets of the South.
Since last Saturday the firm has
sold to Southern buyers sixty-seven
head of mules for a total of $13,400.
The prices ranged from $190 to $200
per head. The sales were as follows:
To Mr. Jordan, of JiawKinsvine,
Ga.; Saturday, 25 mules at $200 per
head.
To Mr. Thomas Harmon, of South
Carolina, Monday, 22 head of mules
at $190 each.
To Mr. Roberts, of South Carolina,
Monday, 20 head of mules at $200
per head.
Caywood and McClintock bought 15
head of mules -from Mr. McClanahan,
of Harrison county, . this week, at
$145 per head. They also bought 4
head of mules from Smith & Turney,
of Cynthiana, at $177.50 per head, and
two- horses from the same firm at
$125 each.

,"Haven't read of any earthquakes
in the neighborhood of San Francisco
lately, have you?" asks the Iola Reg
ister. "Well, that is a tribute to the
loyalty of the newspaper men of that
city, who refuse to send out an earth
quake story. Wetalked the other
day with a man recently a resident
of Oakland, and he told us that there
had been half a dozen earthquakes
within the last six months in San
Francisco so violent that the plaster
ing had been shaken from the ceilings
of rooms in the great skyscrapers
and the people had fled in terror to
the streets. The gentleman says
Oakland has profited greatly by the
unsettled condition of the ground
under San Francisco, as tens of
thousands of people who do business
in the former city have transferred
their residence to Oakland. The rec
ords at the ferry landing show that
an average more than two hundred
thousand people come in and go out
of San Francisco by boat every day."
