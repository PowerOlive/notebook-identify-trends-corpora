THE DAY'S BEST STORY
Robert N. Johnson, Paris insurance
agent, is not a bit superstitious, but
he does admit he was a trifle nervous
the other night, while motoring on
the Lexington pike, near Paris. The
car was purring along the boule
vard softly with all cylinders work
ing perfectly and nothing save the
sounds of Nature to disturb the auiet
of the evening.
Save for Mr. Johnson the car was
unoccupied, Suddenly from me rear
seat came a voice apparently a
voice exclaiming "who, who. Mr.
Johnson stopped his car to investi
gate. Finding no one there and
Slinking his ears had deceived him,
he proceeded again, when the same
plaintive challenge came from the
rear seat, "who, who."
Convinced this time that he had
not been mistaken and determined
to solve the mystery, he stopped the
car, and arming himself with a club,
j rtftrmurh search, of the car.
His efforts were rewarded by the
discovery of a large owl perched on
the rear seat. Mr. Johnson captured
the bird and brought it to Paris,
presenting it to I. W. Bush the Lex
ington Herald correspondent, who
- has added it to his already extensive
collection. "Jamie Butler and The
Owl" of our school days had nothing
on the mystery that surrounded Mr.
Johnson's visitor.
" A
Rev. C. H. Greer, pastor of the
Paris Methodist church, spent Sun
day at Lynch. Ky.. where he deliver
ed the opening address at the new j
Methodist church. Rev. Greer, while
Presiding Elder of that district, was
largely, instrumental in raising the
funds necessary to ' build the new
church.
Memorial services were held re
cently at the Methodist church for
two former members of tne church,
Mrs. Ella Fothergill January, wife of
Mayor E. B. January, and Mrs. Bailey
Arkle, both of whom had been prom
inently identified with all the good
works of the church. Appropriate
resolutions were drawn up and
adopted.
Thursday from 9:40 a. m. to a
p. m. the elementary Sunday School
workers of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, South, are to be guests of
Rev. J. E. Moss and his congregation
for an all-day institute at Nicholas -ville.
Mrs. G. E. Cameron, confer
