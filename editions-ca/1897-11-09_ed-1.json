TIRES THAT LEAK
The Morgan Wright single tube
quick repair tire must be regarded as
a distinct improvement in bicycle tire
construction It has the following ad
vantages
While punctures in it can be re
paired with plugs or semi liquid in
jections as well as in any other
single tube tire it can be permanently
repaired by using the quick repair
strip inside the tire See cut No 1
c
Jjj
By injecting- M W quick repair
cement through the puncture and
then pressing- down on the tire with
the thumb as in cut No 2 the repair
No 2
No 3
strip inside is picked up by the cement
thus closing the puncture as in cut
No 3
The Morgan Wright singletube
quick repair tire is guaranteed not
porous This is on account of the way
in which it is made Nearly every
rider has heard of tires that leak
like a sieve
Many tires rot because water gets
into the fabric between the two layers
of rubber The Morgan Wright
fabric is proof against moisture
Everybody knows how comfortable
Morgan Wright tires are and yet
how seldom they puncture This is
due to the fabric
Ask any bicycle dealer whether
other tires last as long as Morgan
Wright tires Ask also what the
Morgan Wright guarantee means
Morgan Wright tires are repaired
free of charge at the factory inl
Chicago or at any of the Morgan
Wright free repair shops located in
the principal cities
N B When you have a puncture
get right off Riding a tire flat when
it has a tack or nail in it may
damage it considerably
