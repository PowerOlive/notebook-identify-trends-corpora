DRAWING THE LINE.
The engagement of Jack Johnson,
the American colored pugilist, by a
London Music Hall was condemned at
a meeting of the Variety Artists' Fed
eration. Hegret was expressed that
the rules of the federation prevent
he Executive Committee from taking
drastic action. A resolution was
adopted characterizing the engage
ment of Johnson as a violation of pub
lic decency.
Hostility to thd negro boxer's ap
pearance on the stage is gathering
momentum, and it seems likely that
his engagement will be canceled.
