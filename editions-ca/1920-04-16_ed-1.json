CHILD BADLY BURNED
A combination of matches and
kerosene had a bad result Wednes
day for Billy Turner, 'three-year-old
son of Mr. and Mrs. Elgin Turner,
residing on Clifton avenue.
The child in some manner secured
a can of kerosene, which was over
turned, the contents saturating I113
clothes. The boy at the time had a
bunch of matches in his hands. One
of these became ignited, set fire to
his clothing, inflicting severe burns
about the head, face and body. His
screams summoned assistance, Mrs.
Mollie Cameron, a trained nurse,
boin first to reach him. She ex
tinguished the flames and rendered
first-aid treatment. Dr. J. t.
Brown was summoned and gave
medical aid. The boy will recover.
We all want to forget some things
and "ve all want to cover up others.
HAVE LITTLE LAUGHING GAS
IN YOURS?
Having teeth pulled may become
more popular now that searchers
after the old-time "kick" have dis
covered that laughing gas adminis
tered during dental operations can
make one intoxicated. Dr. W. .F.
Rounds, dentist, dropped this "tip"
at the meeting 'of the Optimist
Club, in Louisville, recently, and
told that a "treatment of nitrou.;
oxide gas has the same effect as two
drinks of whisky on a'n empty
stomach."
