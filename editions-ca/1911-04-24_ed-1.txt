Mooney was shot four times, thefatal bullet piercing his heart and theother three making flesh wounds, twoin the breast and one in the left arm.Mooney was the partner of Representative William b Klair in theownreship of the Leland Hotel. Dolanhad for several years prior to October1, 1909. made his home at the Leland,and had been, chiefly through the decline in the value of the thoroughbredhorses: that contstiuted his principalasset, hard up for money and on thatdate was in arrears for his board $222.Mooney had told him that he couldnot carry him further and asked forhis room.

W. Bell. The Board ofDirectors of a life insurance companydoing business in Kentucky met lastyear and authorized the declarationthat there would be no payment ofdividends if the policy holder had failed to make payment in cash of thenext premium on or before the datewas due. A policy holder ofthis company failed to meet with fhu requirements of the declaration of the Boardof Directors and when the dividend onthe policy was not forthcoming heplaced the matter in the hatds of Insurance Commissioner Bell.In writing to the general agent ofthe company Commissioner Bell saysthat unless there is an immpdlnfo rovment of the dividends he will place the, matter in the hands of Attorney Gener1 al Breathitt.ic wm one ot ucse experimental farmers, who pmt itspectacles on his cow and fed her shaviajs.

It is.lust as unreasonable to expect the same results from thin, weak soil, in comparisonwith deep, rich soil, as it is to expect a child to do a man's work. This is a reasonable proposition, particularly to the scientific corn grower.More money is being spent and greater efforts along educational lines are beingmade to-day than ever before in the world's history to increase the yield of corn peracre. We contributed a very large effort to accomplish these results with our BlackHawk single kernel edge drop, and we now add to our combination the No. 15 Variable Drop, with which the drop can be changed to 2, 3 or 4 kernels in a hill withoutstopping the team; or can drill 7 1-2, 10 or 15 inches, 9, 12 or 17 1-2 inches, or 11, 14or 22 inches apart, without stopping the team.Hand Drop Attachment with each Planter, has Foot Drop also.

Canada had been ceded to the eolo-'nies France, froin which Canada hadbeen wrested some twenty years earlier, would have demanded that country as indemnity for the expense shewas put td in the war for our independence. "With the French flag restored in Canada it would have beena matter of a very short time when wewould have been at war with France,and to save us from defeat there isnothing more certain than that wewould have appealed to England. Theaid would have come, and come swiftand irresistible, and the chances arewe would have returned to our allegiance to the crown of England, for itwas years between the treaty of peaceand the 'formation of the Union, plentyof time to get into a quarrel withFrance over some dispute as to boundary or fishing. Washington PostWhy Gold Is a Precious Metal.Pure or fine gold will stand any testit may be put to in comparison withother metals. It can be rolled or hammered, extending it in any direetiou,until it becomes transparent. It can ;also be drawn into a thread as fine ashuman hair. It melts at about 2,000degrees F., and, though it may be kept jin a molten state for an indefinitetime, it loses none of its weight, evenshould the heat be increased. The color is unaffected by air, water or heatand will stand any test of oxidation.No simple acid will dissolve or attackpure gold. In conjunction with silvergold is the first inolal with which manbecame acquainted and is the most jvaluable by icason of the vast number iof uses to which it is put. It is foundin almost every country in a metallic jstate ana nearly always in crystals.The old Egyptian symbol for gold signified divinity and perfection.

The potter's wheelis the essential part of the equipment.The workman's left hand is gentlythrust into the center of the clay,while his right hand is slightly pressing on the outside to keep the wholetogether, but it is from the inside thatmost of the shaping is done. Meanwhile the "wheel" is made to turnmore quickly. Then, by keeping bothhands opposite each other i. e., oneinside and one outside together moving slowly up from the wheel, pressureby both hands is exerted, and theshapeless mass of clay assumes theshape of a pot with astonishing rapidity. A thin piece of wood is used toflatten the rim, and usually the samepiece is used to measure the pot to seeif it is the correct size.Curtis & OverbyJsBARBERS,f Successors to Carl Crawford3 Otiairs 3All White Parbers,Hot and Cold Baths.The Public Patronage Respectfully Solicited.Curtis & Overby.$Sf 77VyV77VJ& ?,5SmSaucers and Finger Bowls.Drinking from the saucer was not asocial solecism seventy-five years ago.In fact, sets of old china may still befound intact that include dainty tabloids upon which the cup was to restwhile the contents, taken from thesaucer, were imbibed and from the attending noise apparently almost inhaled by the drinker.

At last, when we'd just firedone of 'em, a good Iookin' gal appliedfor the position and got it just because she wasn't like any of the restof 'em. She was soft spoken and saidshe preferred inanagin the childrenby kindness rather than any other way.Some of the teachers we'd had weregreat trouncers, and the boys didn'tlike 'em.Miss Hathaway that was her namewas engaged, and I must say theschool settled right dowa to business.I don't know how much laruin thechildren got. but they was quiet aslambs. Some of us tried to find outhow she done it by questiouin' thescholars, but they didn't know. Someof 'em said that when she told 'em tokeep quiet she looked at 'cm in a waythat convinced 'em they better had.The cashier of Boodle's bank fell inlove with Miss Hathaway and wantedto marry her. She kep' him on therack, not giviu' him any decided answer. We who had children to eddicate hoped she wouldn't have him,for the school was doin' mighty welland had never succeeded before. Themothers were especially anxious, notthat they was particular about theirchildren gittin larnin', but because ifthe school wasn't runnin' and they hadto take care of their young uns theyhadn't no time to gossip over the fencesthat divided the back yards.But somehow if Miss nathawaybrought us good luck with the schoola heap of trouble came with her. Therewas raids made on the town by bossthieves one after t'other till nearlyevery boss in town was stole. It looked as though some un who had livedin the town was leadin' 'em, for theyseemed to know just where every bosswas located. When there wasn't buta few bosses left their owners triedto hide 'em. But it didn't do no goodthe thieves seemed to smell 'em andwent right to where they was hid.All this time Shiukley, the cashier ofBoodle's bank that I tole you about,was a-settin' up to Miss Hathaway.He had a fine iron gray boss he paid$G0O for that he used to drive her outwith. He was awful afraid he'd losethe animal, and Miss Hathaway suggested that he keep him nights in theschoolhouse. Nobody wouldn't thinkof lookiu' there for a boss. He doneit, and, sure enough, iu the mornin'there was the boss, safe and sound.But he only kep' the critter there a fewnights when somepin happened that hedidn't need to keep him there anylonger.One night Shiukley visited the teacher, and when he went away they bothwent to the schoolhouse, which wasclose by, and put in the boss. ThenShiukley kissed her good night, forshe'd promised to marry him. He wentWme and to bed. He couldn't git noBleep because he was so happy at gittin' the only gal he'd ever seed that hewanted to many.That was in June, when the daybreaks early. Between 3 and 4 o'clockIn the mornin' Shinkley was awoke bya clatter of hoofs comin' down thestreet. Thinkin' it was the bossthieves and wishin' to git a sight of'em, he jumps out of bed and runs tothe winder. He was in plenty of timeto see all he wanted to. Five men wasridin' down the street, headed by a woman ridin' straddle, just as they was.When they got opposite the winderwhere Shinkley was looking out he' seethat the woman was the schoolteacher,and she was riding his iron gray hoss.She looked up at him and larfed."Much obleeged," she said, "for givin' me the combination of the safe. Myfriends have been after somepin betterthan hosses this time. We got all thecurrency in the bank."Then the feller ridin' next to theschoolmarm he sung out, "Take thatfor kissin' my wife!" And he fired ashot that went through a panel ofglass jist above the cashier's head.Well, now, I reckon that cashierwas mad. Nothin' makes Anybody somad as to git fooled. Shinkley hadbeen fooled as to his affections, hadlost his fine hoss and given away anentrance into the bank's safe.Mebbe he didn't git a move on him!Without stoppin' to git into his clotheshe run down and out, and, seein' afriend of his'n that had a bicycle, hegot him to follow the robbers while hegot up a posse. Inside of ten minutesmen was leavin' the town on wheelsthey wasn't no hosses to ride all armed with rifles. They didn't wait forone another, but as fast as Shinkleygot a man out he sent him on. WhenShinkley had started a dozen men helit out himself.The. robbers, knowin' there was nohosses in the town, forgot about bicycles, and they didn't expect such aquick chase. They didn't hurry much.The bicycles closed up and madechase together. A hoss gits tired, anda bicycle doesn't, so every one of therobbers was tooken.Shinkley couldn't revenge himself ona woman by hurtin" her. The way hedid it was by hangin' every one of themen. includin' her husband, who hadBhotat him. She was forced to seeone after another swung off, Includinher husband. When the 'ceremonywas over thejr left her lyin in a heapin the middle' of -ihe road.
