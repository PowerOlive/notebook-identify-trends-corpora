CATHOLICCHUECH TTEAT BEADBALTIMORE, MD., March 24.James Cardinal Gibbons, arrhhishnnof Baltimore, and primate of the jAanerican Catholic hierarchy, died atthe arch Episcopal residence hereto-day, after a prolonged illnesswhich mainly affected his heart. Hewas in his 87 th year.The end came peacefully at 11:33o'clock.Cardinal Gibbons, who had beenshowing pronounced signs of improvement in health ever since hisreturn home about January 1 last, 'irom union Mills. Md.. where -hirsew lnuepenaent uoDacco warewas taken ill early in December,suffered a relapse Palm Sundayevening.The sudden change of weatherwhich brought unseasonable hightemperatures, had a depressing effect upon him. His fainting spellsreturned and when he was put tobed, from which it was realized bythose closest to him, he probably'never again would arise.Cardinal Gibbons' physicians saidrepeatedly in the early stages of hisillness that he was sound, organically, as could be expected in a person of his years, but that he suffered from the effects of his age andfrom fatigue that resulted from theprodigal expenditure "of his energiesin the performance of his duties assenior prelate of the Catholic churchin this country.Cardinal Gibbons was born in Baltimore, July 23, 1834. His parents,Thomas and Mary Gibbons, had cometo America from Ireland in 1829.They returned ta their native land-when the future cardinal was twoyears old.He entered St. Charles College atElliott City, Md., and graduated in1857. He then entered St. Mary'sSeminary in Baltimore and was ordained a priest by Archbishop Kendrick June 6, 1861.In 1872 he was promoted to thesee of Richmond, Va., and on Oct.3, 1877, was jmade archbishop ofBaltimore, gaining with it the titleof Primate of the United States, itDeng the oldest see of the Catholicchurch in America.Archbishop Gibbons presided ov2rthe Third Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1884 and in 1886 he wascreated Cardinal by Pope Leo "VTII.BEAUTIFUL DISPLAYSEE OUR EASTER DRESSES,SUITS AND HATS.TWIN BROS.

A largeajnount of the tobacco sold was of aninferior quality, but the biddingwas spirited, and nearly all gradesbrought fair prices. Rejections,receipts and passed baskets have!passed almost entirely out of thetobacco market now, and buyers andfarmers are anxious to finish up thework of selling the crop as soon aspossiblee saes held Tuesday at the"house the averages ranged from$19.12 to.?35.48, the latter being obtained for a crop of 2,965 pounds belonging to D. M. Frederickson.The Bourbon Tobacco WarehouseCo. sold Wednesday a total of. 69,625 pounds of tobacco for an average of $11.08. Three of the beatcrop averages of the sale were asfollows: Gaitskill & Clayton, 1,125pounds, average $21.51; Dodge &Mattox, 2,970 pounds, average $31.55; Shropshire & Bays, 2,430pounds, average $20.0. Wednesday, March 30, will be the last saleon the Paris market.All organized movements for thereduction of the Burley tobaccocrop in the four growing Stateshaving failed and seeing many of'the producers forced into bankruptcyand others filling the graves, of suicides on account of low prices andfinancial stringency, it is said thefarmers will voluntarily reducetheir acreage forty to fifty per cent.In the meantime, the movement toform a great marketing organization to sell the surplus in Japanand Europe is under way.

BOURBON CIRCUIT COURTHobart Harding, of Nicholascounty, was given a sentence of oneyear in the Frankfort Reformatoryon a charge of stealing an automobile. At the same time the autqmobile was stolen, Harding stole avaluable dog belonging to a farmer in Nicholas county. The machinewhich belonged to a Bourbon countyman, was recovered in Greencastle,Indiana, where Harding had takenit.A case which for its peculiar ending was declared to have been without precedent in this Court, wasthreshed out by Judge Stout. R. B.Hutchcraft, of Paris, leased a portionof one of his farms to'C. S. Groseand his two sons, to be worked onthe shares. When the time for settlement arrived Mr. Hutchcraftpresented several claims for damagesto his tenants, alleging they hadfailed to properly raise and harvestthe crops, and had allowed theirstock to trespass in the fields, causing damage to the extent of $1,000.Grose and sons filed counter suits fora less ajmount. The trial of the caseoccupied the time of the court for anentire day, a large number of witnesses being examined. At the closeof the testimony Judge Stout toldthe jury he was unable to give themany instructions, and for them to retire and do the best they could. Ina few moments the jury returnedwith the following verdict: "We,the jury, find nothing for the defendants and nothing for the plaintiff." The question arises whowill have to pay the costs in thecase?In the case of Emil Houk, chargedwith having stolen a touring car belonging to B. L. Day, insuranceman, of Paris, on the night of March15 th. He was found not guilty.Houk drove the machine toLexington, where, on the followingday it collided with a street car.George Ann Walton, colored,charged with cutting and wounding,was found gulity and given' a sentence of six jmonths in jail, and afine of $150. She was charged withcutting Mary Macon, in Ruckervillo,some time ago.The case of the Commonwealthvs.JWill Hall, charged with grandlarceny, was postponed until Saturday morning at ten o'clock.On account of the absence of JudgeStout, who was called to Frankfortfor a conference with GovernorMorrow, Judge Denis Dundon occupied the bench Wednesday.A decree granting at 'divorce fromher husband, Yutaki Minakuqhi,non-resident, was handed down ,yes-terday by Judge Stout to MrsYutaki Minakuchi, of Paris.The entire time of the Courtyesterday was taken up with thecase of Jchn S. 'Jones vs. I. C. Haley,of Clintonville. The case, after argument by counsel, was given to thejury. The jury came in late yesterday afternoon, reporting that theycould not agree on a verdict, andwere held over until this morning.EASTER FLOWERSPut in your order early for anEaster box of flowers.BRUCE HOELADAY,(It) Agent For Honaker.oASK ZANGAR, WORLD'S FAMOUSMYSTICA few of the many questions youmay wish to ask Zangar, who is toappear in person all week of March28, at the Grand Opera House, inconjunction with the regular program: When you will marry?How often you will marry?
