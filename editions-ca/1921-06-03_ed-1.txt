A distinguished writer oneconomic subjects outlines four principles for general consideration bybusinss men. First, "keep a firmhold on your common, ordinaryhorse sense." Secondf "broader andwider tolerance than you have everhad before." Third, ''use of theblessed sense of American humor,"and, fourth, "take' a new and firmgrip on our faith in the UnitedStates."These principles truly may be-said to be Lincolnian. These are theessentials of business' optimism. Butoptimism without effort is as uselessand dead as faith without works.It is certified to by indisputablefianancial authority that of all thebusiness failures in 1920, 84 percent, were of concerns that did notadvertise their business. Here isthe answer to the question, "WhyAdvertise?" The majority of modern business .men understand the value of publicity. Nations as wen asindividuals understand the natureand quality 'of this value. An adequate volume of advertising insuresto nations as to individuals largermarkets, and larger markets confernational prosperity.But times are uncertain, unemployment is growing, the bowwows are imminent, and urrgy! &c,stammers the disciple of little faithand no initiative. .In answer to that the formerPresident of the Lackawanna Railroad replies: "Advertising is themagic key that unlocks the gates ofthe commercial prosperity and floodsbusiness with new life. It is the onefactor in business powerful enoughto turn disaster into success. Itspractical value lies in the fact thatit stimulates consumption."Wherefore, concludes this scientist optimist, the logical time forpersistent advertising is when consumption is at low ebb.oRETURNS HOME FROM OVERSEAS TRIPRobert I.

All of the important racing establishments whose horseshave been making such notable turfhistory in Kentucky this spring willbe transferred en masse to Latonia,and in addition some importantstables that have not figured in thomeetings already held at Lexingtonand Louisville will make" their debutfor the season at the Kenton countytrack."Fair Latonia" will be fairer thanever when racing is resumed thereJune 4, to continue until July 9.The plant is already in superb condition and word from Latonia indicatesthat it never was more deserving ofits appellation as the "Saratoga ofthe West," than it is right now inthe beauty ' of its summer grab,which will continue over the periodcovered by the approaching meeting.The opening day's program will benotable for having double stake features, these being the Inaugural handicap and the Clipsetta stakes fortwo-year-olds, both events having anadded money value of $5,000. Secretary Will Shelley has built aroundthese stakes events a card for theopening day. The Inaugural in particular is a race of great possibilities.Most of the horses that recently metin the running of the Kentucky Handicap are eligible for this race andthe field will be composed of muchthe same horses that contested forthe $15,000 prize at ChurchillDowns.The Clipsetta stakes, which hasbeen run continuously since the year1883, is the most noted turf fixturefor two-year-old fillies at Latonia.It closed with the record number of157 eligibles embracing all of thecrack juvenile fillies of the West, together with many that have beenwinning on the Eastern tracks. Included in the number are Miss Joy,Fair Phantom, Dream of Allah,Bonus, Aloft, Martha Fallcto, Whirl,Bright Trash, Startle and others oflesser note.

The lists, so far as they have beenprinted, teemed with mistakes. Menwho volunteered in the service at theearlier days of the war, others whowere summoned by one draft board,but joined the army at a distant section of the country, while still otherswho lost their lives in fighting forthe flag, have been included in thelist which the War Department intends to hold up to scorn and opprobium of all patriotic citizens. Aninjury is being done to them, whichis difficult to efface. No amount ofcorrection or retraction can fully remove the stain, and it is an outrageto brand as belonging to the class ofBergdoll men who actually deserve tobe revered as Gresham, Enright andHay.The lists, as given official sanctionby the War Department, have provenso inaccurate "that, for instance, theWarld is the only New York paperthat will publish them, and its columns include daily a series of corrections and explanations in justiceto the men whose names have beenimproperly included.The War Department has evidentlydone a bungling piece of business,and it should. not be allowed longerto smirch American patriots. TheStanley bill should pass.oWedding Ring Finger.Whatever the fashion may ba aboutwedding rings, the Episcopal Book oCommon Prayer says: "The priaat,taking the ring, shall deliver it to.tkfman to put on the fourth finger of thwoman's left hand."The national debts of the worldare now estimated at $256,000,000,000.

At Paris, Bourboncounty, the wife of Major George W.Williams celebrated her 17th birthday, although 68 years old. Thegathering of husband, children,grandchildren and friends made it asremarkable and interesting as agolden wedding, than which sucn anoccasion as this is much more rare.oATJTOISTS HAVE BEMAEKABLEESCAPE PROM DEATHThe most remarkable escape fromdeath ever experienced by anyone inMontgomery county was that ofWilliam Wells and his eleven-year-old daughter, when the automobilein which they were driving east onthe Owingsville pike was struewhile at the Okingsville crossingnear Mt. Sterling, by the fast C. & O.morning train. The train was dueat 7:45 o'clock a. m., but was nearlyfour hours late.Wells and the little girl were riding in the front seat and the trainstruck the automobile midway between the two seats, slicing the carin twain. The little girl had beenriding in the rear seat only a minutebefore the train struck, and hadclimbed into the front seat with herfather. Mr. Wells said that whenhe first heard or saw the train waswhen he drove upon the railwaycrossing and heard the roar of theengine right upon him. The traincame to a standstill a moment afterthe collision and backed MP to ascertain the extent of damage done.PILES!aWKSJllHB:vx'fe?'::'v::::::x:-SHBIf you are a sufferer with PHffJggtLfrf Wind or bleedin. you will itregfrbmthe first applicatk or u -WLmmmr (salve) for piles and rftvUu eauSytl&iti does not art. $1.00 tymail, prepaid.t p. iW S MiMactorar, lieWasvit , K(apr29-13tF)THE BOURBON NEWI,SOCIAL AND PERSONAL.Comings and Goings of OurPeople Here, There andElsewhere.Mrs. Frank P.

(advTHE SCHOOLS AND POLITICSThe conspicious absence .of" theoffice of County School Superintendent from the list of those for whichparty nominations will be made atthe August primary, is serving to callthe attention of many for the firsttime to the fact that this ofllce hasbeen made appointive and is no longera pawn in .the election game. TheSchool Superintendents now in officewere nominated and elected fouryears ago as partisans; but in theinterm the Legislature, responsive tothe popular movement for the divorceof the public school system fromnartisan politics, chanced the thenexisting- law to make the office appointive una piacea me selection 111the hands of the County Board ofEducation, a non-partisan body.Aside from the advantage accruingto the public educational system, thegood effect of the charge is emphasized by the pending primary campaign. Ordinarily there would havebeen numerous aspirants for partynominations for School superintendent in nearly every county, involving bitter contests, in many cases repeated in the general election.With political obligations to meet,the School Superintendent so chosenwas hampered in the conduct of theoffice for, the best interests of publiceducation. Fortunately all this hasbeen obviated. The Legislature didnot stop with taking the office ofCounty School Superintendent out ofpolitics, but went as far as it could toput tb.e office of State Superintendentof Public Instruction on the sameplane. Since this' required a constitutional amendment, the Legislaturepassed the necessary enabling act;and the question of making the StateSuperintendent an appointive officerand eligible to serve longer tnan oneterm, will be submitted to the votersof Kentucky for their ratification orrejection at the coming Novemberelection.oTEACHEKSWILL BE EXAMINEDJUNE 17.Superintendent of Public Instruction George Colvin, has called theattention of city and county schoolsuperintendents to the examinationof teachers for city and rural schoolsto be held Friday, and Saturday, June17 and 18. Under the old law theexaminations were held at differenttimes, but the new law provides fora uniform date.In counties where there are nocities of the first, second, third orfourtli class the examination will beconducted by the county superintendent and appointed examiners. Innmmties containing: such cities thecounty superintendent and the citysuperintendent will conduct the examination with the assistance of appointed examiners, if necessary.Three liBts of questions for the examination will be sent out from theState Superintendent's office and theanswer papers will be returned tothe State office for grading and theissue of certificates.The elementary list includes theusual twelve elementary subjects,as follows: General science, generalhistory, American history and civics,arithmetic, algebra, plane geometry,grammar and composition, literature,first year Latin and theory and practice of teaching. The high schoolcertificate qualifies for both elementary and high school teaching. Applicants for this certificate must beat least 18 years old. ......The State certificate list includesthe twelve elementary subjects, alsoalgebra" and literature.

They will belong to thebreeder the Government will haveno strings on them. The owner willbe privileged to sell them to wnomsoever he pleases at any time. Theywill be horses admirably adapted towork in both peace and war times."But the Government will dependupon them for its supply ; and the importance of the horse to the modernarmy is to be fully realized by thecomparison of figures already citedpertaining to the use of the horse inthe last great war with those of hisuse during the-Civil War."As regards thoroughbred horsesracing, every practical horsemanknows that it is, first and foremost,vitally necessary in order tb-tet thequality of individual horses JtJfc" thefinal acid test that goes toTnuraretbsir value for breeding poqposes,and is thus decisively instrumental inthe work of preserving and improvingtfce thoroughbred horse as the race upon which depends the preservationand improvement of all our other kindsof horses and mule mares."MeanwhQe, the evolution of thoroughbred horse racing has given theworld a great out-of-door sport onethat the world truly enjoys, tt theattendance at ocr metropolitan racecourses may be-taken as evidence ofpopularity, and which, wherever properly conducted, is assuredly healthfuland? innocuous, insofar, at least, asconcerns its effects on the great majority of normal-minded citizens."The State of Kentucky is immensely the richer for her industry of breeding thoroughbred horses and its concommitant seasons of racing.

ANSWERS FOB MR. EDISON(Cynthiana Democrat)Why all this ado about Mr. Edison's test questions, for college graduates? The answers are easy. For instance, "Where does shellac comefrom?' From the paint store. "Wheredo we get prunes?" At the boardinghouse, of course. "Where do we getphosphates?" At the soda fountain."In what city are hats made?" Hattiesburg, Miss. What is the capitalof Pennsylvania?" Boies Penrose."Where do we get wool from?" Thewool gatherers. "What is differencebetween anthracite and bituminouscoal?" $6 a ton. "Where do we getdates?" From the .chickens. "Ofwhat kind of wood are axe-handlesmade?" Axle-trees. Doesn't look likeanybody should fail on those questions.

S. BALL GARAGE .Fourth and Pleasant StreetsWHEN BETTER AUTOMOBILES ARE BUILT, BUICK WOLL BUILD THEMKENTUCKY TAX LAWSThere seejms to be a peculiar misunderstanding in regard to the taxlaws in Kentucky and it is a seriousmistake to attribute the recent increases in assessments to the Classified Tax Law voted for by the people in 1913 and 1915 and adopted bythe Legislature in 1917 and now inoperation,iAssessments are made under Section 172 of the Constitution of 1891which provides that "all propertyshall be uniformly assessed at thefair cash value" and the recent increases merely show that the taxing authorities seem to be makingan attemut to enforce this unamended fundamental law.The complete failure of the oldlaw caused the people by their votesand the Legislature by its acts tosubstitute the more modern Classification law under the belief that otherproperty could be induced to contribute in taxes and relieve the burdenwhich had been carried almost entirely by real estate and this hascome to pass.Under the old law real estate paidabout four-fifths of the taxes but nowpays but little over one-half. Of thetwo millions increase in State revenue real estate was called upon foronly about ten per cent, and otherclassified property contributed aboutninety per cent. Of the increase inassessed values for the- current year,of about eighty millions, land improvements will have only sixteenthousand dollars additional taxes topay, while other property will haveto pay three hundred and eightthousand dollars. There is conclusively no shifting of the burdenfrom personal property to real estate, as has been charged, accordingto these figures published by theState Tax Conimission.In the realized expectation thatpersonal property would contributemore . liberally under classificationthe State tax rate was reduced from55 to 40 cents and had this reductionnot been made, real estate would bepaying a million and a half dollarsmore than the current tax bills, onthis class of property, now call for.These are some of the benefits ofclassification and a.revision'to the oldSystem, of so-called uniform taxaation, would only result in a renewalof the practices of evasion by theowners of movable property and realestate would have ta make up thepast.The government jmust be sustainedand principally by taxes on property.Xhe more property that pays the lesstaxes there will be on all and itwould be suicidal to drive away thevast amount of personal property nowcontributing.It is stated that there is a billionand a half dollars, in value, of untaxed wealth in Kentucky and whenall of the property in the State issubjected to fair taxation the ratessliould be lower and taxes a matterof little concern.wof new Buick six-cylinderbe carried thru the 1922,- -Is bur Mealtime DrinkSbur Friend?A good many people who like teaor coffee find that tea and coffeeclorft like them.&Nervousness, sleeplessness ordisturbed digestion is proof.P0STUM CEREALfurnishes a satisfyingcup without irritatingnerves or digestion.Thousands who have madethe change keep on withPostum because it's better for them.4,There's a ReasonSold by all grocers .Made by Postum Cereal Cb,Inc,Battle Creek.MicH.iiimi iHome Telephone.
