Claysville, in Harrison county, State
Game Wardens Geo. M. Hill, of this
city, and Cash Shaw, of Frankfort,
quietly slipped into that neighbor
hood last week and put the suspected
parties through" the third degree,
with the result that some very in
teresting evidence was gathered, and
a large number of fish nets and traps
of illegal size were destroyed. The
Game Wardens had been previously
supplied with information as to the
location of the nets and the traps,
and went after the guilty ones with
a vengeance. For twenty days a
special ofiicer in the employ of the
Fish and Game Commission had been
in the neighborhood working in con
junction with the officials, arid when
the trap was ready to spring, War
dens. Hill and Shaw made their visit
of inspection. " ,
The search and phase continued
two days, during which time hun
dreds of fish traps, nets, seins and
other illegal paraphernalia of the pot
hunter fisherman kind were brought
to light and destroyed.
By promising to keep within the
law henceforth and forever more
the men were not arrested, but
were warned that a second offense
would be very disastrous to them.
The efforts of the Game Wardens
to breakup the, illegal taking of fish
from the streams of Harrison coun
ty has been generally commendfd' by
.all lawabi&ing itieas tof ths-eou&ty.
