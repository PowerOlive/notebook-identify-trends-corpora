THE CHANCES FOR SUCH A FATE ARE

In Times of Plague and Pestilence tho
Greatest Danger of Premature Burial
Exists The Death Test That Is Applied
In Vienna
Most of us have a lingering love of
life and the thought that there is just
the barest possibility of being buried
alive sends a shudder through us
Medical men know that the human
body in time of illness and at other i
times too is liable to assume all the
outward appearances of death without
the final separation having actually
taken place There are the coma cata
leptic and other forms of the I
scious state each one bringing in its j
trcni te very simulation cf death itself i
Happily a medical man nowadays
said a physician to a reporter expe
riences no difficulty in dechiring his pa
tient to be dead as a general rule but
it may perhaps happen once in his life- j
time that he may have a doubt in
which case conviction either way fol
lows upon his findings which are sim
ple and conclusive and in which he
cannot be mistakep
It is unfortunately true that there

No no I shall not gxy so far as to
say chat a premature burial has never
takn place but it has netf occurred so

occur in times of plagues and
lences where the presumed dead t may nnder pleasant trees -where

That is where much mischief lies But tea or coffee at little taifts but mast-

In plagues such as chefera tb
state of collapse- is- so profound that it
may perfectly simulate death iflself but
the custom of burying the dcali on the
day of death is fortunately on tile wane

such events are possible

Thimbles are placed on the- fingers of
the dead to whichu are afctashed wires

Have the bell aever rung Yes once
It is impossible for a doctor to mis
take unconsciousaess iititsvaried forms

Some time ago it -was suggested that
a law should he passed making it com
pulsory for a medical man to test bodies
before giving a certificate of death
Testing by electricity was thought of
but it is an opera question yet whether
electricity kills or only stuns At all
events we in this country are not con
vinced thai such a test would be satis

death although it has its value On the

save perhaps a few tradesmen and
mummers who smell the- commercial
battle from afar It is1 an open secret
that the semblance cf a show is there
merely to court avoidance The years
in passing have turned it into a big
bazaar but not even raifchis guise can it
prove the chief attraction

truth is the garden jnst that

called the Welcome club because ad

Where the west end condescends to
