PKETTY ACTRESS MOLLIE KING
WEDS KENNETH D.
ALEXANDER.
The marriage of Miss Mollie King,
prominent star of the New York mu
sical stage and also a screen player
of prominence to Kenneth D. Alexan
der, master of Woodburn Cottage, at
Spring Station. Ky.. is the culmina-'
tion of a romance which began last"
summer when Mr. Alexander, then
in the naval aviation service, was on
duty at an air station on Long Island!
Mrs. Alexander, although for sev
eral seasons a Broadway star, is in
the very early twenties, having made
her first pronounced hit in one of the
early Winter Garden extravangances,
when barely sixteen. Since that time
she has been among the bright stars
in several successful Broadway musi
cal shows, up to two years ago, when
she deserted the speaking stage for
the movies. After winning new lau
rels before the camera she returned
to the stage last winter, co-starring
with her brother, Charles King, in
"Good Morning, Judge," a musical
comedy adaption of Pinero's "The
Magistrate." H
During the winter Miss King was
also one of the luminaries in the mid
night show on the Century Roof, but
recently gave up the latter work to
return to moving pictures.
Whether Mr. Alexander's bride will
continue her stage and screen career,
of whether she will come to Ken
tucky to live, has not been announced.
City licenses are now due and
should he paid promptly to City
Treasurer W. W. Mitchell. Penal
ties will soon attach to those failing
to comply with this law.
