One of Two ResultsEither Arbitration to Settle the Trouble orthe Mines Will Be Started With Imported Men They Have Asked for a Conference With th Miners OfficersPittsburgh Pa 20 The meeting-ofthe coal operators Thursday andand Thursday night will bring aboutone of two results either aibitrationwill settle the strike or the mines willbe started with imported men Friday will decide which course shall bepursued The operators are evidentlyin favor of arbitration in preference toa forcible opening- of their mines Thiswas evidenced Thursdav when MessrsMurray and Osborne representing- themeeting- wired National PresidentRatchford at Columbus asking if Saturday next would be suitable for a conference at Pittsburgh of both sidesThe Rend and Eobbins interests Wednesday night telegraphed Ratchfordasking him to come to Pittsburgh totry and settle the strike District President Dolan followed the telegram toColumbus and is endeavoring- by personal persuasion to bring- about sucha meeting Dolan Thursday telegraphed that Ratchford was willingto confer but preferred not to meetwith the Pittsburgh operators onlybut an interstate representation Thetelegram sent by the meeting Thursday insisted that Indiana and Illinois-would not consent to a conference andit now remains with President Ratchford to say whether or not he will meetwith the Pittsburgh operators andtrust to the others to follow the decision there madeIt is believed that a conference willbe held here on Saturday because justafter the session of the operators hadadjourned Col Rend received a telegram from his son Joseph who is inColumbus sayingDolan says Saturday was selectedfor conference Executive board willbe in session FridayIt is inferred from this that Ratchford has concluded to attend the conferenceWhen Mr Dolan went to ColumbusWednesday night he was given absolute authority by Rend Robbins andothers to arrange for unqualified arbitration and he has been working- tothis end all dayShould the arbitration meeting notbe arranged for it was decided by theoperators at their meeting Thursdaynight that immediate preparations forstarting- their mines non union shallbe begun The meeting- adjourned untilSaturday morning- to give time forRatchford to answer officiallyShould Ratchfords reply be adversemines will be Started in a few daysMachine mines will be selected for theinitial movement as none of the pickmine owners care for hostilities tobegin at their minesFrom expressions used by operatorsThursday night they are more determined than ever to start their minespeaceably or otherwise7MINE

Miners StrikeColumbus 0 Aug 21 The nationalexecutive board of the United MineWorkers adjourned Friday after having issued the call for the conferenceof organized labor to be held at StLouis August 30Following is the call for the conferenceTo organized labor its various divisions andsubdivisions and to all reform social educational and scientific bodies wbo condemngovernment by injunction and the use offorce to coerce the people and deprive themof their rights as American citizensColumbus O Am 20 1897To thc Organized Labor of the CountryGreeting The great miners strike has gonebeyond a struggle for living wages A crisis inthe affairs of the nation has arrived in whichall patriotic people must determine whetherthey will accept and consent to live under therule or an oligarchy of wealth or whether thyinstitution of free government the rights offree speech and peaceable public assemblageare to be preservedThe present struggle has assumed a contestfor the preservation of civil liberty and constitutional rightsThe tyrannical and un American injunctionsof the federal and state courts are revolutionary against the first principles of free government and derogatory to the inherent rights ofthe masses endangering the public peace anddestroying the personal security and individual liocrties or the common peopleThe courts have deserted the temple orJustice and now stand forth the defiant bulwark or confederated capital Their arbitraryrulings have set up one standard of rights forthe rich and another for the poor They decree that capital is always right and labor always wrong They have made it unlawful forstarving working people to appeal againsttyrannical treatment present grievances orpropose just and peaceable terms for the redress of insufferable wrongsThe present great miners strike is an expression of discontent that originated in poverty and starvation it was born in the sorrowand destitution of hungry women and childrenit was the last protest of impoverished and enslaved labor and it presents to the world acause as righteous and humane as ever inspiredthe souls of a Christian people The philanthropic heart of this great nation has responded in sympathy with the miners appeal for theright to receive a respectable living for themost arduous and hazardous labor in theworld Their appeal for a small share of thewealth they create and for the right to enjoysome of the fruits of advanced civilizationfinds a responsive chord cverwherc in the commonality of mankind and if it were a strugglebetween miners and mine operators onlyliberty would triumhh over oppression industry over greed and right over wrong withoutthe necessity of this callBut it is no longer a mere struggle betweenemploye and employer The judiciary has assumed the indefensible claims of the operatorsand the struggle is between tyrannical courtsand the whole people The courts althoughunder oath to serve the rich and pooralike have volunteered to defend thesordid interests of the rieh asagainst the God given rights of the poor andnow threaten to turn the Gatling guns and theWinchesters of criminals and thugs againstall who dare to protest against their despicable restraining orders The judiciary isprostituted to the bidding of oppressive capital has placed the rights orproperty above the rights of persons andhas discriminated against the many in the interest of the fewThat 350000 miners should be condemned tolives of drudgery and starvation by the arbitrary rulings of the courts is an insult to abeneflcient Creator an outrage upon free government and a disgrace to the Christian civilization under which we liveThe recent injunctions and their extreme application against the lawful rights of the poorthe arrest and incarceration of hundreds of innocent inoffensive people the general employment of armed thugs to overawe harass andcoerce the miners have so exasperated thepeople in localities where applied that we feelthat we can no longer be responsible for thepublic peace and to the end that a just andequitabe settlement of differences between employers and employes may be effected the publicpeace the liberty of the masses the sacred institutions of free government preserved andthe covrts estopped from these outrageousperversions of constitutional rights we appealto that higher more humane and patrioticcourt the great plain people who in timesof trouble have always proven the just arbiters of eery difference between diversified interests and contending elements in the government of human society We appeal to theliberty loving people of this great nation tosend accredited delegates to St Louis Mowhere a mass convention will be held MondayAugust 30 1397 The object of the conventionwill not be to merely protest against the usurpation and tyranny of the courts but to formulate plans to compel a return to the principles of free government and put said plans intopractical operationOur people have suffered all the evils

conference orto arbitrate The position taken by Ratchfordoccasions great surprise to the operators Heinsists in bringing in all competitive stateswhen he knows the operators of other statesunder no circumstances will attend a joint conferenceIn making this demand Mr Ratchford isseeking to delay a settlement in hope that hemay bring to his aid all the labor organizationsof the country and assume such political influence as will frighten the politicians into insisting upon a settlement of the strike without regards to the merits of the caseHe has always insisted that the Pittsburghdistrict is the key to the situation and the oporators hold out to him an olive branch fromwnich is suspended the key he sought MrRatchford is using the Pittsburgh miners as acats paw to scratch political

encampment Col Winans said that sofar as his information went there wasbut one choice among the delegatesand that was Cincinnati There seemsto be a feeling he said among some ofthe eastern people that San Franciscowants the encampment but that isa mistake San Francisco is preparing to make a bid in 1899 Withregard to the encampment held inRichmond Va he asserted there isnothing in it The people down theredo not want it and the veterans do notcare to go there The chief objectionhe said was the certainty of unpleasant complications over the color lineNotwithstanding this view the YoungMens Business association of Richmond has opened headquarters hereand is making an effort to secure theencampmentCol Winans says Pennsylvania willsend the most people to the encampment with New York second and Ohiothird in attendanceOne of the most brilliant features ofthe encampment will be the livingshield which will be produced onWednesday the day of the paradeFour thousand children from

It is to resemble a large grandstand the seats grading upward as thoelevation increasesThis will give the shield the appearance intended namely of resting onan easle The seating space will bosquare and the figures dressed in redwhite and blue will be so arranged asto form the outline of a shield withred and white stripes and with whitestars in a blue field surrounded by aborder of black Boys in

Little Chiwassee butthe urging of the same wholesomeemotion made him tireless in his effortsto find Thorndyke He accepted hisown theory of kidnaping and afterlearning from the hotel keeper atGlenco that Philip had set out to rideto Allacoochee and that the horse hadreturned riderless the following- dayhe was confirmed in the belief that theyoung attorney had been waylaid andcarried off to some isolated cabin onthe plateau Acting upon this conclusion he began a systematic search onthe mountain and since his occupationhad made him familiar with every spurand ravine within ten miles of Allacoochee it would have been singular if hehad failed to discover Thorndykesasylum It was late in the afternoon ofthe second dajr however when Philipheard the welcome sound of approaching hoof beats and his satisfaction wasnot lessened when he found that therider was Protheroe He laughed whenhe hobbled to the door and saw theengineer coming up with a Winchesterheld at the readyYou neednt be alarmed he calledoxit I dont want to fight and I cantrunProtheroe was mystified but thebandaged ankle was held up in evidence Then youre not a prisonerrafter all he saidjllOhi yes I am very much -so butnot by the ill will of ray good friendshere All I need is an ambulance or theloan of a gentle horseWe were afraid youd been kidnaped said Protheroe and seeingPhilips look of inquiry he added Imin the secret Duncan has told me allabout itBut I dont understand yet I wroteDuncan two dajrs ago and sent the letter in 3our care Didnt he get itA sudden light broke in upon Protheroe Two days ago that wasWednesday How did you send itBy messenger to you at AllacooeheeDuncan didnt get it and- I neverheard of it It probably fell into thehands of the enemj Sharpless went toDuncan Wednesday afternoon with astory about your having gone to NewYork and ever since hes been turningheaven and earth over to find KilgrowUnsuccessfully I hopeUp to date yes and I think theres310 chance for him Duncan warnedthe old man at onceGood then everythings all rightyet By Jove old man Ive been havingn horrible time cooped up here whenliheres so much at stake and every dayis preciousProtheroe smiled I can imaginebut you neednt worry Allacoocheehasnt run away yet and so far as Iknow the company is still solvent Areyou ready to go back to civilizationIndeed I am if youll tell me how-to do itNothing- easier yon can ride myhorse and Ill walkWhen Philip had taken leave of hientertainers and had narrowly missedi quarrel with the Bedouin in the effortto make him take payment for his hospitality he was helped into the saddleYou want to go to Allacoochee Isuppose Protheroe saidId rather go to Duncans if we canget thereProtheroes heart misgave him buthe answered unhesitatingly It canbe done and they were soon out ofsight of the cabin in the windings of atrail leading diagonally across theplateauFor some miles they pushed on inuch silence as the narrowness of thepath made compulsory but when thetrail broadened into a wood road Protheroe dropped back beside the horseand they began to speak of the missingletter The talk reminded the engineerthat he still had Thorndykes mail inhis pocketand he passed it up andconsiderately went on ahead again whilePhilip read the letters There wds onefrom Helen and yielding- to somethinglike a suggestion of moral cowardicePhilip left it until the last When heopened it he saw that it had been written on the same day as that about themarriage portion and the first wordsproved that it was an after thoughtIhave just mailed one letter to youshe wrote and it was hardly out of myhands before I began to be sorry that Ihad sentit As I remember it now itwas all about themoneyand I ought tohave known that you would do whatwas just and right without any urgingfrom me What I want to say now iswhat I should have said then that Icannot endure this separation muchlonger that the love which I have triedso hard to keep out of my letters forfear I should make you come back toyour hurt refuses to be hidden undermeaningless and commonplace phrasesOh Philip if you love me pleasedont let this misfortune raise any barrier between us You know what AuntBellam left me you know that it ismine in my own right and I entreatyou not to turn my gratitude intomisery by refusing to share this moneywith me But you will not I know youwill not and if we had nothing else weshould still have each other and whatmore could we askIn some respects I know you-better than you know yourself and Iknow that if you can have your healthyou will yet win a place among thosewho have fought their way into theforemost rank Be good to me Philipdear and let me share the battle andthe triumph with you Come back tous if you are well enough and if you arenot please let me come to youProtheroe heard something betweena groan and an imprecation and hestopped and waited for Philip to comeup Did you say anything he askedNothing- worth repeating I think Iwas tempted to swear a little at thecrookedness of things in general I wishthat cursed horse that threw me hadbroken his neck or mine or bothDoes your ankle hurtEverything hurtsProtheroe did not attempt to drivethe conversational nail any fartherHe was preoccupied with his own concerns and he had been trying to determine what he should do when hereached Duncans Would his part inthe affair be ended when he had seenThorndyke safe in the house of hisfriends or would he be expected tohelp his rival in the fight with the company How would Elsie receive himafter his late transgression How couldhe endure to meet her in the presenceof the man she lovedThey were troublesome questionsbut the engineers perplexities were asserenity itself compared with thetumult of conflicting- emotions whichhad slain the peace of mind of his companion Before he had read three linesof Helens letter Thorndyke was sinking into the nether depths of self-abasementand wThen he had finished it hefelt that it would be a comfort if hecould get down into the road and strewdust upon his head This was the lovehe had put aside for the sake of a mereimpulse born of a sick mans fantasiesthe fine gold that he had tossed contemptuousty into a melting pot heatedby the remainder of the simile wasdrowned in a submerging wave of selfcontempt And now at this presentmoment when he was cursing- his reckless inconstancy and wishing from thebottom of his heart that he had had thedecency to die quietly in the odor ofgood faith she had his letter and shehad learned at his own hands upon whata broken reed her love had been leaningAfter the storm came the calm ofdesperation He had wrecked Helenslife and his own and Elsies happinesstrembled in the balance He could atleast save Duncans daughter and inthe riot of distracting thoughts thiswas the only one that offered a grain ofcomfort He would expiate his follyby devoting- himself body and soul tothe task of making Elsie as happy asshe deserved to be And he wouldspeak to her as soon as he could findthe opportunity before he had thetime to sink still deeper in the mire offickleness he told himself bitterlyB3r the time Thorndyke had reaehedthis conclusion Protheroe was leadingthe horse down the trail on the LittleChiwassee side of the mountain and anhour after dark the small processionstopped at Duncans gateYoure heavier than vou used to beI dont think youre going

if I shouldAs not infrequently happens whenthe probable course of events has beencareful- prefigured nothing cameabout during the evening- to verifyProtheroes fears or to add to Thornd3kes misery They were all unfeignedly glad to welcome both of the wanderers and while Mrs Duncan wasprincipally concerned in doctoringPhilips ankle Elsie tried to induce the3oung engineer to la3 aside the shroudof reserve which he conceived to be theproper penitential garment for the occasion How had he found Mr Thornd3ke Had he ridden far How hadthe3r ever managed to get down themountain with the horse Werentthey both dreadfully hung Theseand many more questions Protheroehad to answer and at length he wasobliged for ver3r shames sake to compel himself to be oblivious to thatwhich Elsie was so evidentl3 bent uponignoringAnd neither that night nor the nextmorning before they left for Allacoochee did either of the 3oung men findan opportunity for private speech withthe girl though Thornd3ke abusedhimself as was his wont for not havingmade one and Protheroe went awayleaden hearted because he had been denied the privilege of confession and absolutionAs to the necessity for going Thornd3ke was peremptory and obdurateHe insisted that Sharpless must not begiven another day that there had already been sufficient delay to enablethe craft3r and unscrupulous attorneyto entrench himself behind

withcurrents of molten iron to strengthenand invigorate the thews and sinews ofthe man3 handed giant of laborThere was to be an industrial paradeand a monster meeting in the afternoonat the furnace

thestreets were thronged with visitorsmoving in unique crowds under thegayly decorated awnings or stoppingin admiring- groups to stare at theelaborate display of bunting- and flagsornamenting the

succeeded they heard a curious thumpingin the corridor which was explainedwhen the door opened to admit an unannounced visitor It was Thorndykeon crutches and he stopped to close thedoor carefulty before limping to a chairfrom which he could see both of theconspirators In the twinkling of ane3e the scowl on Sharpless face meltedinto a suave smile of welcome and hisgreeting was cheerful and

-trainoil and half a pound of 3ellowsoapSuccess inspired this man to anothereffort The wager orn this occasion wasthat he could not eat as much triiie aswould make him a jacket with sleevesHe took the bet iand was regularlymeasured by a tailor who cut the tripeinto the exact size and shape of theJgarrment The porter ate it all in 20minutesAs a pie specialist the record of aScotchman of Dundee is not withoutdistinction He consumed1 nine largetwo peimn pies in 14 minutesThis feat aroused -much enthusiasmand indiiced betting men to lay oddsagainst him that he could not devour12 pies of the saime

strength ofbamboo poles is not at all understoodby the majority of persons It is statedon excellent authority that two bamboo poles each of them 1 7 10 inches indiameter when placed side by side willsupport a grand piano slung betweenthem by ropes and that they willneither sag nor break under theburdenBamboo will form poles 65 to 70 feetlong and from S to 10 inches in diameter A derrick 26 feet high made offour inch bamboo poles raised two irongirders weighing together 424 poundsThe wonderful lightness of this material in proportion to its strength has excited comment of late and new usesare constantly being made of it Scaffoldings of bamboo have the advantageof lightness and strength It is predict-ed that this material will come in general use for such purposes An additional advantage is that bamboo resistsdecay in water as well as in earth thatthe older and drier it gets the morasolid it becomes and that it can begrown for an incredibly small sumN Y LedgerBe Couldnt

blueGentlemen and old friend of mineCome over here by me Chip Now Cigarette old manSetting his head upon the rim of thereceiver in a more comfortable positionthe Cigarette beganThe first thing that I can rememberis the fact that I was one of a numberof very young leaves that were supported by the parent stem of a flourishing tobacco plant that flourished onthe soil of a plantation way down inCuba I was very proud in those daysmainly because my plice was well upHE WRITES ONon our stem and I could see a greatdeal more of the world than my brothers who occupied places lower downIn this balmy climate I thrived andgrew notwithstanding the fact wewere often neglected by reason of therebellion that was and is now raging inthose parts You see my owner was arebel and as he held a high commission was often away for weeks at atimeOne day how well I remember it wewere wakened by the rush of manyfeet about us dreadful noises filled theair and we were so surrounded bythick smoke we could hardly see Eromwhat I had gleaned by the slaves thattended us I knew in a moment that abattle was ragingThe din became louder hoarseshouts of command and cries of agonyfilled the air now and then a thud upon the ground would tell me that somebrave man had fallen Many times wecame very near being trampled on andcrushed but by some miraculouschance we escaped serious injury 1was just bending down to congratulatethe stem for our escape when with arush a battery of Maxims 1 think thatis the name came lumbering in ourdirection I was conscious of beinjrcrushed down by the weight of

unconscious for along time for the next thing 1 can recollect was the fact that I was a veryfine leaf of tofbacco and althoughmarked with many others highgrade I was thoroughly cured of myconceited manners and green waysNot many days after this I was taken to a factory where a very prettydark eyed girl wrapped me about anumber of tender tobacco shoots andthen packed me with others of like ilkin a gaudy but verj handsome boxThere were only 25 of us all told and wewere known as the Reina family Soyou see gentlemen that 1 have everyright to be proud of my strainMy time grows very short or 1 wouldgo more into detail but suffice it tosay I like my esteemed friend thePipe underwent the horrors of a seavoyage and after knocking about aoit was exposed for sale at a high figure in the store of

was glad of this forI hate gambling oh I beg pardon MrChip I quite forgotNot at all Cigarette said the PokerChip cheerfully I am used to abuseThe Letter smiled sadly at the interruption but no one

been devoted to oarsmen in the course of the last few weeksand papers have had columns of newsabout the achievements of the variouscrews The ambition to win distinctionIn that field of athletics has caused anincrease in the membership of most ofthe local rowing associations Butwhile rowing as an amusement and asport is growing in popularity rowingas a business is steadily being crowdedout of existence An old boatman bewailed the fact in these wordsWhen rowing was first taken to bysports the boys used to come down tothe docks and get points from the rivermen We knew how to pull boats andwe had to know working in this harbor with the water going all ways andboats coming from all directions Ofcourse we were not much on the newfangled shellboats but the boys gotpoints from us just the same and thosewho learned to row the shells the bestwere the regular watermen There wasmoney in being a boatman in those daysbut the business has gone and onlythose remain in it who are too old to doanything elseWhat did we do Well we had plenty of work between taking people to theships and off them transporting stevedores and bringing messages to shipand land and it was apoor day when anindustrious man made less than ten dollars And there was fun in it at thatwith lots of excitement and races manytimes each day Nowadays there isnothing for the boatman to do except tothink of the good times that are goneand to run a line when he gets achance at three dollars a runThe old boatmen say that their business has been ruined by the little steamcraft When a ship cOmes to the harbor nowadays there is never a lack ofboatsmen to run a line or carry it tothe place where the vessel will makefast but that was formerly only one ofthe many duties of the industriousboatman now it is the mainstayWe never quarrel as to who shallhave the job if several boatmen are onthe spot said the veteran and theman who is nearest the incoming shipusually gets it and the three dollarsTo be on hand we go out as far as Bobbins Reef Light and the man who getsa job earns his moneyHe explained that the numerousboats which are seen from the ferryboats are not regular boatmens craft-Many belong to lobster men and fishermen and a goodly number are the property of men who hunt driftwcod anddrift stuff others again are manned bymen who are in the employ of the ferrycorporations who go to and from theirwork on the ferry property that wayThe boats dont look very nattysaid the bronzed oarsman of long agoand would stand a poor show in a beauty match but theyre a sight more useful than the fancy shells that all thefuss is made about and as to rowing -wellIve been at it boy and man for45 years and I think Id stand a goodshow in a race herein the harbor withiahy one of the chajnpion oarsmen

the rose is so greathat all account of its origin has beenlost It is not mentioned in the Biblical writings earlier than the reign ofSolomon but the allusion to it thenmade is sueh as to indicate that theflower had already been known for theessence of roses was extensively used1in Jerusalem and Judea during thereign of the luxurious and much married king In Egypt the rose is depicted on a number of very early monuments believed to date from 300O to3500 B C and in the tomb of anEgyptian princess disinterred a yearago in the south of Egypt several hermetically sealed vials were foundwhich when opened contained genuine attar of roses so that the modernclaims for the discovery of this delicious perfume are vain Rose water orthe essence of roses is mentioned byHomer in the Iliadt Homer and Solomon were nearlj contemporaneousBoth the Greeks and Hebrews probablyborrowed the idea of its manufacturefrom the Egyptians and these foraught anybody can tell may have hadit from the Indians or from the Chinese for the latter claim for each oftheir discoveries and inventions a mostmarvelous not to say incredible antiquity The rose is one of those flowerswhich by the people of ever3r land

Wheelmen recently delivered an excellent goodroads address before the Chautauquaassembly at Dixon HI His remarks related especially to the attitude of theleague towards the farmers and itsessential features embodied in the following article cannot fail to be of general interestNow the great question before us issaid Mr Dorner how shall we obtainbetter country highways The question is not do we need good roads buthow shall we get them Koad buildingin the United States has been left entirely in the hands of the farmers andin charge of the local town authoritiesThese local authorities as a rule haveno knowledge of the science of roadbuilding and 50 years of experience hasshown a great deal of labor wastedand vast amounts of road taxes collected in vainIn many places our roads to day areno better than they were 20 and 30 yearsago A radical improvement in the system itself must be madeThe League of American Wheelmenhas been the subject of much criticismon account of its agitation for betterhighways We have been accused ofselfishness in the matterIt is believed by many that we wheelmen expect farmers to load themselvesup with taxes that they might buildroads for the convenience of bicycleriders No greater mistake could beOTTO DORNERKnown as the Apostle of Good Roadsmade We of the League of AmericanWheelmen who are engaged in this agitation for better roads feel that thefarmer to day bears his full share ofpublic taxes and that they should notbe unnecessarily added to We feelthat a mistake has been made in thepast in expecting farmers alone to payiqrl building roads and in leaving theentire responsibility for our roads intheir hands The farmers of the UnitedStates are but a fraction of our population and they are by no means theonly ones who will profit by the construction of good roads It is claimedthat in the state of New York everyfarmer is obliged to build roads foreight persons out of the state population Why should not the other sevencontribute to their costWhile good roads would save thefarmers immense amounts in haulingproducts this saving would indirectlybenefit the whole population Neitheris the farmer the only one who travelsthe country highways Country merchants doctors and professional menpeddlers pleasure seekers and last butnot least the wheelmen would be directly benefited by good roads It is unjust therefore that the farmer aloneshould pay for building these roadsI am glad of an opportunity to sayto a gathering of farmers that theLeague of American Wheelmen proposes to help them in bringing abouta proper division of the cost of goodroads so that the city people the capitalists merchants and manufacurersthe wealthy corporations railroad insurance and telephone companies infact every class of people shall contribite to the cost of building them TheLeague of American Wheelmen believesthat many of our country roads shouldbe built by state aid that a part of thecost of good roads should be paid outof a state tax which would be leviedupon all property and all classes ofpeople alike so that every taxpayershall contribute a proportionateamount according to the amount ofproperty he owns We propose thatthe states shall help to build roadsand to divide their total cost betweenthe people of the locality who are mostdirectly benefited and the adjoiningproperty owners whose land rises invalue as a result of the improvementand the state as representing the entire population This is not a Utopianplan it is not a theory only but hasbeen adopted in practice with greatsuccess in New Jersey in Connecticutin Khode Island and in a modified formin Massachusetts New Jersey has become famous for the fine roads she hasbuilt These were constructed by astate aid system under which theircost is divided about as I have indicated The farmers of New Jerseyare enthusiastic over this state aidsjstem and the towns and counties areglad to pay their share of the cost ofthese roads so long as the state paysits part The country districts in NewJersey are overwhelming the state authorities with petitions to assist in theimprovement of local roads and thelegislature cannot appropriate fundsfor the purpose sufficient to meet thedemands from the farmers The NewJersey commissioner of public roadstells me that a large part of his time isoccupied listening to the pleading offarmers that the roads in their districtsshall be the first to receive the benefitof state aidOur suggestion of state aid is nowalso being advocated by the icuding representative f armers of the UnitedStates as the proper solution of thisgreat road building question Thefarmers national congress has passedresolutions in favor of state aid and MrJohn M Stahl the able and energeticsecretary of that organization is oneof its warmest advocates He has written extensively upon the subject andhas assisted us in our work for state aidbefore the legislatures In New Yorkstate in Connecticut in Pennsylvaniaand in Wisconsin the League of American Wheelmen and the farmers organizations have worked hand in handfor state aid This is the strongest endorsement which could be given to theefforts of the League of AmericanWheelmen and shows that they areaimed in the right directionAll classes alike are beginning to realize the great economic importance ofpermanent highways iurmers xeetthat they have too long been compelledto build and improve country roads attheir own expense and they are entitled to state support in this greatnecessary public improvement Uponthese lines and upon these lines alonethe good roads improvement is bound tosucceed and will succeed and uponthese lines the League of AmericanWheelmen proposes to keep up its agitationwith the help of the farmers ofthe United States until our commonroads neglected until now the stepchildren as it were of a great republicshall have received at the hands of ourlegislatures some of that tender careand nursing which has been extendedin the past to canals to steamship linesand to railroads many of which haregrown up almost entirely at public expenseFEEDING DAIRY COWSConditions That Will Maintain a allFlow of MilkOne of the important items in maMngdairying pay the best profits is to supply such conditions as will best maintain a full flow of milk It is not thecow that gives the most milk for a shortseason after calving and while the pasturage is at the best that gives the mostprofit but the cow that gives a goodeven flow the greater part of the yearWhile there is much in habit there ismore in feed and management A cowthat has been neglected especially asregards her feeding during the middleor latter part of summer usually commences failing in the quantity of milkshe will give until in six or seven monthsafter calving she goes dryExperience in the management ofcows has proved that it is much easierto maintain a good flow of milk bycommencing to feed in good seasonthan to allow the milk flow to beginto fail and then attempt to bringher back to a full flow again Henceit is always best to keep a watch on thepastures and whenever they begin tofail to commence feeding Some dairymen feed the cows a little mill feednight and morning even when pasturage is at its bestBut on most farms all through thegrowing season green feed is much thecheapest The second growth of clovermillet sowed sorghum or fodder canbe cut off and fed as needed and ifcare is taken to feed liberally the flowof milk can be maintained More thanwith any other kind of stock good feeding is necessary with the milch cowsIt is only from the surplus food overand above what is needed for the support of animal life that the milk ismade and liberal feeding is necessary ifa full flow is maintained With care ingood season the habit of milk givingduring the greater part of the year canbe established and this is always avaluable trait in the dairy cowThe best time to commence to establish the habit of long milk giving iswhen the heifer is first giving milkbut if regulated at that time and theyoung cow is allowed to go dry earlynow is a good time to begin Feed welland milk regularly With care andpersistence this defect in the earlytraining may be overcome But be sureshe has plenty to eat all through theseason St Louis EepublicLABOR SAVING DEVICEWith It the Filling of Bnj Is MadeComparatively EasyBags at the threshing mill are oftenfilled from half bushel
