HOW B0UEB0N FARMING LANDS
HAVE ADVANCED.
As an illustration of the remark
able increase in the valuation of
Bourbon county farm lands in the
past two years, Sheriff Will G-. Mc
niintnck. of Paris, nurchased Mon-
I day from Fiank Collins an inter
est in a tract of land near the city
limits of Paris, known as "Griffith's
Woods," for ?500 an acre.
Two years ago Mr. McClintock,
Mr. Frank Collins and Mr. Henry S.
Caywood purchased this property,
containing 311 acres, for $200 an
acre. They resold 200 acres to Mr.
John Woodford at the purchase
price. In 1918 they built two large
tobacco barns from the timber on the
I lands, and raised a crop of tobacco
I which netted 135,000. Mr. McClin-
tock then, bought Mr. Cay wood's one
Uhird interest for $400 an acre, and
this year his barns are filled with a
crop of tobacco which it is estimat
! ed will net about $40,000.

world is that a man's earning ca

NEWSPAPER CHANGES
Auvt Hoffman, of Eewing, has as
sumed the editorial and business
management of the Inquirer, pub
lished for many years at Ewing by
Lee S. McGohan. McGohan has re
tired from the newspaper business,
in which he has no doubt become
convinced there is no possible chance
to make a fortune and be your own
boss at the same time. The Inquir
er was at one time the pet possession
of the late John D. Wyatt, who spent
many years in building it up into a
paying proposition, and then quit the
game.
