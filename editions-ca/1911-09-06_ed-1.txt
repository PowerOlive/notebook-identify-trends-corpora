This move on the part of the officers did not discommode the spectatorin the least as many stationed themselves in the rear of the stand overlooking the place of exhibition, whileothers went to the grounds below.The exhibition opened with an excellent display of Shorthorn cattle, Jheattractive premiums bringing outmany entries. The pony show which,since the rejuvination of the Society,has been one of the principal attractions, and adding to the enjoyment ofthe women and children, was fully upto the average, although the exhibitors were handicapped to some extent,through the order of the officers not toallow the use of the ring.The ring for- the fancy turnout, carrying with it a premium of ten dollarsfor the first choice and half thatamount to the second, was won byMiss Marv Acnes Turner, daughter of.Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Turnei, of this'city, against two other contestants.John Stuart was awarded the secondpremium.The four events postponed until thismorning will bring together a fineclass of harness. and saddle horses,roadster stallions and colts. It is proposed by the officers to take up thispart of the program this morning andwill make an effort to complete theprogram which was carried over fromyesterday and that of today before theclosing this afternoon.

A. Webber was the first to'render any assistance to the injuredrmen. Mr. Webber was returning homeIfrom the dance at Elks' Hall last nightin company with his wnfe, Miss Chow-ney, of Shelbyville, and Miss Erdman,of Lexington."- Attlie turn in the road Mr. Webberbrought his machine to almost a complete stop, when he was hailed by Fisherwho informed him of the accident andand asked him to assist in getting themen to Paris.Mr. Webber drove his car to hishome and returned to the scene of theaccident. In the meantime Mrs. Webber 'had telephoned to Dr. C. G.Daugherty, who hastily prepared togive the injured men medicial attention. Arriving at the scene," Mr. Webber,who regarded Elkins s probably themost fatally injured of the party, withthe assistance of Fisher nd Cunningham, succeeded in jrettine the man inhis car and brought him to Paris, leaving Gratz in charge of a negro namedColeman.Mr. Webber returned to the scenbimmediately after turning Elkins overto the care of'.Dr. Daugherty, in company with Dr. Wm. Dudley and Patrolman (5. N. McKenney. and rushedGratz to this city, where he was waited upon by Dr. Dudley atthe' office ofDrs. Fithian and Dauhertv.Elkins lived but about an hour afterhe was brought to Paris. His skullwas crushed at the base and the scalptorn from his head. It is evident thatin being thrown from the car his headstruck the end of a cross tie, fracturing the skull. He died without everregaining consciousness.The body was removed to the undertaking establishment of Geo. W. Daviswhprp. it was oreDared for burial andsent to Lexintgon on the 7 :30 L. & N.train this morning. Mr. Webber communicated with Mr. W. I. Hughes, theemployer of Elkins, in Lexington, at2 o'clock thi morning, who with Mr.Leon Smith came to Paris in an automobile.When picked up Gratz was bleedingprofusely from the nose and mouth.An examination revealed a broken collar bone and shoulder and several fractured ribs. He is behevsd to be internally injured. His relatives were immediately notified of the accident andearly this morning he was rushed to aLexington hospital in Mr. W. W.Mitchell's automobile. He had partlyrpirjunpd consciousness. His conditionis regarded as critical.Neither Fisher nor Cunningham sustained any serious injury, '.the formersuffering a sprained ankle and the latter, who was -driVing the machine, aslight cut on the Meg. Both men returned to Lexington las night.The machine,, which was a completewreck, was the property of C. D. Cunningham.f'ather of 'Robt.
