Miliersburg Wants Tobacco
Warehouse.
With some of the moat prominent
and influential men behind the move
ment there is every indication that
Miliersburg will next fall have a loose
leaf tobacco warehouse and plans are
already shaping in that direction.
The initial step was taken last week
when live subscription papers were
started and after one day's work in
soliciting subscriptions more than $10,
000 was raised.
The promotere of the enterprise have
in mind a most desirable site for the
location of the warehouse, which is
located in one of the colored,, suburbs
of the town. It had been purchased
for the pumose of erecting a church
and it is the hope that if the plan noes
through they may be able to secure
this property for the purpose.
The plot is said to bo easily accessi
ble to the railroad which would fur
nish the proper facilities for the ship
ping of the tobaccoaftsr prizing. The
men behind the movement are thor
oughly confident that they will be able
to secure the necessary capital within
the nefct fewjjweeks when steps will be
taken5 looking to the purchase of a
site, and,work upon the structure will
begin shortly thereafter.
Among the public spirited men of
Miliersburg who are interested in the
plan is Mr. W. F. Saunders, who has
subscribed liberally and who is one of
the chief promoters. The movement
is but a sample of the progressiveness
displayedgby the people of Millerbsurg
recently and it is to be hoped it will
materialize.

Arnold Held Without Bail.
The examining trial of Newt. Ar
nold, charged with killing Attorney
Harry Bailey, at Cynthiana, 'on the
afternoon of Monday, January 27, was
held in that city Wednesday, resulting
in the defendant being held to await
the action of the Harrison county
grand jury by County Judg'e King
without bail.
3 Arnold, who formerly lived in Bour
bon county, has since the day of the
killing been confined in the Lexington
jail, being taken to that city for fear
of attempted violence because of the
intense feeling that existed tecause of
the killing of Bailey.
The defendant was represented by
Attorney E. P. Morrow, ol Coving
ton. A number cf witnesses were in
troduced both for the defense and pros
ecution. After the trial and by. order
of Judge King Arnoldwas taken back
to Lexington where he will be held in
jail until the date of his trial in the
Harrison court.

Good Morning, Have You a Cook
The matter of securing a cook in
Paris is becoming quite a nroblem and
many housewives are tearing their hair
in desperation. But. nevertheless,
cooks cannot be had, even at the most
satisfying salaries. As1 a matter of
fac conditions have never been such
as they are now and there is only one
reason to assignfor it.
Almost any day in the week it can
be found that cooks are wanted in
homes, and almost any dav the com
plaint is heard that "my cook has
left." The fortunate persons who
possesses the employment of one skill
ed in the culinary art frequently wake
in the morning to find the cook hasn'
shown up, and the housewife must
either exercise her own cooking knowl
edge or do without breakfast.
It has come to light that the reason
for this is that a large number of col
ored women employed around the
homes in this city spend their nights
in drunken revelry instead of keeping
themselves in condition to attend to
their duties. A good "souse" invari
ably brines on that independent feel
ing and the result is when the time
comes to go to work, the employe as
sumes a "don't care" attitude aid
quits the job.
This is a matter which we wish to
bring to the attention or the police. A

An equal quantity of bread (biscuit) was made
with each of three different kinds of baking powder

separately to the action of the digestive fluid, each
for the same length of time.

These tests, which are absolutely reliable and

to everyone : Food raised with Royal, a cream of

tible, while the alum and phosphate powders are found
to largely retard the digestion of the food made from
them.
Undigested food is not" only wasted food, but it
is the source of very many bodily ailments.

A Mammoth Concern.
Notwithstanding the S50.000 fire
which destroyed the brass and alumi
num foundry of the Buick Motor Com
pany at Flint, Michigan, they are still
making deliveries by the train load.
Right on top of the eleven trains
sent out in 1912 they are starting out
on 1913 business with two trainloads in
the first three weeksof January. The
first was one of fifty car loads which
went to the Nebraska Buick Company
at Lincoln, Neb. This is said to be
! thefirst train load shipment of motor
cars ever made into that territory.
The second is one of eighty carloads
which will be sent out the comimr
week to the Pence Automobile Com
pany at iviinndaDous. ine train win
carry 250 Buicks, and is the second to
go to the Pence people within a period
of onlv live weeks.
A big concern like the Buick has no
end of trouble in gettirir enough
freight cars. Sometimes they can't.
and if they can't they make the deliv
ery cross country, no matter what tha
weather and no matter what the roads.
Deliveries thus far thi3 season have
been made to points as far away as
Pittsburg, Cleveland and Indianapolis,
not to mention Detroit. Battle Creek
and other places near at home where
that kind of delivery is so common as.
to excite no comment.
But the real trouble in sending out a
trainload shipment comes in loading
and getting away without seriously
congesting conditions iu the yards. l
is a jobwhich calls for ingenuity and
reaonrcefulness. Buick loaders have
been made expert bv much practice
until now it takes only a minute and a
half to get a machine in the box car.
