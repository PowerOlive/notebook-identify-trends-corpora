Marvel Kins: the Winner WithTeddy Roosevelt a Close iSecond Choice.J,With a crowd in attendance which isvariously estimated at from betweensix and seven thousand the third dayof the Bourbon County Fair passed into history as one. of the largest inpoint of attendance, since the reorganization of; the Bourbon County Agricultural Society six years ago, and theexhibitions, which were of the highestclass delighted the large gathering.The oppressive heat had little or noeffect on the people as a means ofkeeping them away from the fair andearly yesterday morning thousandsthronged the streets of the city longbefore the opening of the gates, ushering in one of the most successful daysof the week.While the figures are yet incomplete, there is no doubt but that thereceipts of yesterday will go to thehigh water mark. From early in themorning until Cel. Geo.D. Speakes announced the close of the day's program the grounds and amphitheatrewere thronged with neoDle. and thei promenade of the stand was a movingi mass of humanity.. Not since the organization of theSociety has. there been such an enormous crowd on, the grounds. By noonthe amphitheatre was filled, the maIjority of which were people from thei country and visitors from other towns'and counties. The major part of thosewho went early took their nonn lunchwhich was spread upon the groundafter the, fashion of the fairs of theolden days, while others took advantage of the splendid dinner whichjvas set by the Bourbon County Hospital League.This, coupled with the extremelylarge number from the city, the majority of which waited until the afternoon to go to the grounds, swelled thecrowd enormously and at no point inthe staid, even in the aisles, was therescarcely passing room.The stock exhibit surpassej anythingof the kind ever held in the State, dueentirely to the fact that the ocietyuuerea me most noerai premiums,which had the effe.ct of bringing out alarge number cf exhibitors. Mr. C.A. Webber carried away practically allof the blue ties with his prize herd ofJersey cattle, which were in the pinkof condition for the exhibition.The feature event of the third daywhich attracted largely and broughttogether the finest .blood in show.horses, was the sweepstakes for harness horses. This ring brought out sixentries and a finer exhibition wasnever witnessed in this city. Thehorses competing were Teddy Roosevelt owned by Collins & Remon, ofNorth Middletewti, and driven by W.G. Shropshire , Jack Straw, owned bythe same firm and driven by G. D.Shropshire. 3ol.

Collins.Allie Jones of North Middletown,drove his entry, Marvel King, andRoberta King.owned by Ward & Ward,of Georgetown, was .driven by CareyWard, while Ed Watson, of Lexington,had entered an Unnamed coach mare.After much deliberation the judgespassed Col. Young iand the Watsonentry, the remaining fou competingfor the blue tie, which was awarded toMarvel King with Teddy Rooseveltseennd. Jack Straw third and the Wardentry, Roberta King, fourth.The winner of this event nevershowed to a better advantage being Inperfect condition and carrying himselfwith elegant 'style and a perfectstride.Teddy Roosevelt and Marvel Kingmet in the ring following and in thesaddle class which resulted j theawarding of the blue tie to the entryof Collins & Kedmon to which Mr.Jones' horse was second.The ring for filly colts brought outsix entries and in this event muchdifficulty was experienced by thejudge in making hia selections for thefirst and second premiums, which were'both awarded to Sanford Carpenter, ofMillersburg.(Continued on Page 2)Ferguson's Stock Barn Burned.A large stock barn on the farm of J.W, Ferguson, a few miles from Paris onthe Hume & Bedford pike, was destroyed by fire about 8:30 o'clock last night,together with its contents, entailing aless of $1,500 with no insurance.The barn contained a large quantityof feed and work harness. Also in thebarn was a team of show horses whichwas to be exhibited at the fair to-day.The animals were in that part of thebuilding where the fire originated, andwere saved by heroic efforts.To cause for the fire can he assignedother than that some of the men employed at the barn were seen smoking ashort time before the fire was discovered,and it is supposed a lighted match orspark from a pipe or cigar fell into theheavy bed of straw under the horses.Irislire yofrr - feTarii withThomas & Woodford. ?McKernan and His Men Will Put-Up Best Game Here To-morrowAfter noon.II "We .can't 'Steal tell what willhappen as base u'dM Js Very uncertain," said Manager iI6&erMn, justbefore the club left this morning forWinchester for the second gams of thechampionship series with the Hustlers lthere this af'ernon, but rest assuredwe will do our best to win the secondgame of the series this afternoon.

He anwstered "Gano's theshow, I reckon."It developed that Charley Gano,principal fun maker with the bigshow, really is putting it over on someof the boy, and keeps them workingnights to keep up. Gano is an oldtimer in minstrelsy though still ayoung man, and new to the south, buthis happy go lucky manner of delivery, his seemingly careless methodof singing, his genuine ; interpretationof the easy living, ambling, shufflingdirkey, instantly individualizes hiswork, installs him in the appreciationof his audience, and characterizes theartist, to lovers of Jminstralsy. Amongthe other funny men, Billy Burke,Tom Post, Spike;Du Ross, Allen Settle,Sotinie Dinkins, Jack Lynch, all areclever in their work, and secure wellmerited recognition, but "Gano's thej'show" seems to he 'conceded even bythe manager himself, so far as thecomedy end goes.
