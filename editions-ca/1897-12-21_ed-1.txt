my poorfriend Perdinand Perkins And foolthat I was I never suspected the truthand the devilish cunning of the monster threw suspicion upon anotherWhen I learned the real facts monthsafter the tragedy had occurred it wastoo late too lateHis distress moved me profoundThe motive was jealousy the jealousy of an Othello I had paid attention to his wife a blameless womanMr Livingston good as gold and

was not pleasingWhy did you not prosecute Iasked when you learned the factsProsecute he echoed Notajuryin the land would have sent him to thegallows The testimony was purelypresumptive and the fact that I hadeloped with and married the accusedswife would have invalidated her evidence I submitted the case hypothetically to the greatest criminal lawyer in America and he laughed at meI understandI suppose he continued dreamilyI might have taken the law into myown hands I might I had the opportunity more than once have shothim down but Livingston its a disgraceful thing to admit but as I toldyou I am a coward That awful nightswork destroyed my nerve made a woman of me and my wife implored meon her knees to leave the monster aloneI he laughed nervously needed nourging and appreciated fully my

rejoicing hasno place in art Easter Christmas NewYears Fourth of July and almostevery other day of celebration have beenmade themes for creative genius andhave furnished the world many of itschoicest engravings paintings andsculptures But Thanksgiving thoughin spirit and practice a day of gladnessstands gloomily apart with almost noone to depict its significance andgloriesThis is the more iremarkable from thefact that in the east which claims thehonor of orginating the day and thefurther honor of being par excellencethe home of American art the festivaltakes precedence of Easter and NewYears and other days of celebrationsave the Fourth of July The festivalis a Puritan product and seems to haverebelled the lovers of the beautiful asdid the stern visaged sticklers forplainness who landed at Plymouth andoverran the adjacent territoryThe illustrated papers alone haveseen the day material for artistic display andh aye for manj years presentedin pictorial form characteristic featuresof the festival In these for the mostpart the turkey has been adopted as thesymbol if not the motive as the lilyhas been for Easter and the holly andmistletoe have been for ChristmasEven -in periodical pieturesreunions there has usually been aturkey in the foreground or background with its suggestion of deathand dinnerIndeed it has been saidithatif itwerenot for the sorrows of the fowl thatmake them a mark for humor and caricature Thanksgiving would scarcelyhave broken into the illustrated journals The serious pictures pertaining tothe day are declared to be a sentimentalmodification of the humorousA canvass -was made a Jay or two agoof the leading art stores of the city butnot a Thanksgiving picture could befound At one store the bestthey coulddo was -to offer a picture with aturkej in it At another it was declared that the festival had never beenmade a theme for art and that a questfor Thanksgiving pictures would befruitless At the other stores the report was similarThe day waid one art dealeriOculiarly and exclusively American andnot universal in Christian communitiestlike Easter Christmas and New YearsHence it would fall outside of the sympathies of English and continental artists It is a strange fact though thatAmerican artists have ignored it Thefestival has nothing dramatic or tragicabout it but it does oer an opportunity for the depiction of devotion andfamily happiness with a fairly goodscope of humorous treatment Theremay be many TharJcsgiving picturespainted by artists for their own homesor for individual patrons but I have yetto see the first distinctively Thanksgiving picture reproduced for the trade andfinding its way into the art storesChicago TribunePoison IvyJust what it is thatinducrs poisonivy to play its injurious pranka on somepeople at some times and not at othersIs still a profound mystery One thingis certain that tlie number of peoplesusceptible to the poisoning influencemusi be extremely few from the factthat in the vicinity of Philadelphia thehighways and byways are overrun withthe plant to an enormous extent It isfrequently impossible for people to goby without brushing against it andif it is the vapor or some exudationfrom the plant which causes the trouble thousands of persons must be under the influence to every one whosuffers from it The writer of thisgraph knows of a tract of land on whichthe plant grows profusely and on whichman y scores of laborers arc employedThese laborers are frequently set toweeding and pulling out the -plant bythe nahed hand and so far as thewriter knows none of these men wereever poisoned by it The cattle eat itgreedily whenever they get an opportunity It seems to have no injuriousinfluence on them Meehans MonthlyIn the Dry Goods StoreTs anjone

that morning Ben Sturgis met Ruth Ames onhis way home to dinner and told herjust what kind of paper pattern he hadsold to LucindaMrs Benson who had issued cardsfor a lawn party on the followingThursday could hardly have been expected to know who composed society in Valley City and who wasbevond the pale though several welldisposed persons when they heard thatold Sam Bowers daughter had beeninvited would have put in a word inthe right direction had the list beensubmitted to themMrs Benson means well remarkedWidow Simpkins but she judgesmore by a pretty face and a livelytongue than by familyT should be very grateful saidYoung Mrs Benson to Lucinda if youwould help me with the ice cream andcake at the party next weekWherever Lucinda went it was expected that she should look after thecomestibles which Valley City calledrefreshments She dispensed thelayer cake at the strawberry and icecream sociable she filled the candybags at Christmas time and attendedto the commissary arrangements at theannual Sunday school picnics IndeedLucinda Bowers had been a burdenbearer from her childhood She paidthe rent and clothed her brothers andsisters from the wages which sheearned as a school teacher She led theChristian Endeavor meetings when nobody else would do so She fanned thefaint spark which still remained in theWomens Missionary society and keptthe sewing circle from disintegrationIt seemed as though Lucinda Bowershad always been old As a matter offact she was hardly 25 She mighthave been pretty if she had given moretime to sleep and less to care and worryWhile the whole town was busy discussing the addition to Lucindas wardrobe the young woman was busy atwork upon her first new dress in twoyears The organdie was slipped overan old skirt of blue silk which had belonged to her grandmother A few bitsof lace a few lines of tucks a girdleoi blue silk ribbon and the dress wasdoneL suppose remarked Lucinda onthe evening of the party as she lookedat herself critically in the cracked mirror of the old walnut bureau that itswicked for me to spend this money ondress when Johnny may need a newpair of shoes before long I wish Iwasnt so rebellious but I cant helpitThe Benson lawn party is still famous in the social history of ValleyCity The ambitious young matron whogave the entertainment was not contentwith the grass plot which surroundedher own pink

James Jerome Bensonsprang into social prominence stilllives The angel food a species ofsponge cake was really the best whichhad ever been served in Valley CityEven to the present day the matronsof that town are wont to say Id liketo entertain too if I could make suchangel food as Mrs Benson had at nerlawn party Mrs Benson has neverexplained that Lucinda made the ambrosial confection which was served ather tables on that memorable nightThe divinity who brought order outof the chaos of ice cream freezers andcake stands was arrayed in blue organdie Lucinda Bowers principallybecause she was not aware of the factwas positively pretty that night Hercheeks were flushed her eye sparklingShe directed the band of white cladyoung girls who carried about the icecream laden saucers and handed thetiny coffee cups to the guestsThe attention of those who werethere on that evening was divided between the angel food and a literarylion from New York He had not beenmuch of a lion when he went

have novery definite idea why he had comeback to the little village He had madehimself believe that he wished tophotograph some of the old placeswhich he had known in his boyhoodHe had gone with his camera to theold mill to the little house where hewas born and to the cabin on the outskirts of the village which marks thespot where the first white man madehis home in Bottle county Yet William

women begantoact They liked each other none toowell but all combined against a common foe Here was one not even recognized in the social register of the little town who had presumed to attractthe attention of a distinguished explorerThis coalition of social powers at oncebegan an active campaign There weredrives to the Bock house and Lucindawas carefully excluded from the list ofguests Prof Dorrance as the driveswere arranged especially for his benefitcould not very well refuse thetions There was a dance at Dr Hy desand the name of Lucinda Bowers appeared on no dancing card The professor was there for Mrs Benson whowas a remote relative of his by mar-riage insisted mat ne muatuuicuuI rather think said Margaret Elton to her mother one morning thatthe professor has forgotten all aboutour young friend of her grandmothersskirtBut the young women of Valley Citywho composed what was known as theset received invitations that after-noon which caused them to open theireyes in

There wasno silver teapot and the silver spoonswere worn yellow in places but thenapkin on the little tea table was ofsnowy whiteness the tea gave forth agrateful fragrance and the angelfood was of marvellous flakinessIm so glad said Lucinda as shetoyed nervously with the edge of ahemstitched napkin that you have allcome to day I have known you girlssince we were children I have something to tell which I want to knowfirst of ail I am to be married nextmonth to Prof DorranceThe young women crowded aboutherand congratulated her loudness of tonemaking up for lack of sincerityI suppose said

the nihilists arefond of asserting that he has a better title to the throne of Russia than thepresent czar He is directly descendedfrom the ancient house of Rurik whichruled Russia for centuries before thepresent Germanic dynasty of Romanoffcame upon the throne He was educatedat the colleges of the pages in St Petersburg which only the sons of membersof the imperial court are admitted andafterward studied atLeipsic Heidelbergand Zurich piroving Ms superior scholarship at each university Upon his return to Russia he was assigned to scientific work mnder the government andshortly afterward became secretary otfthe Imperial Geographical society Afew years later he entered the serviceof the court as grand chamberlain tothe wuf e of Alexander IIWhile he was at Zurich Krapotkinebecame infected with socialism andjoined the Society of the InternationalBut he concealed his views and Ms relationsandservedatcourt for more thanten years without being discoveredDuring the latter part of this period hewas in active communication and participation with the nihilists in St Petersburg and is said to have planned theunsuccessful plot to assassinate the eraperor in I860 All

imperial lineageKrapotkine was not executed with therest of the conspirators but was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment in thecitadel of Ste Peter and Paul There helay in a dungeon until it was thoughthe was dying when he was removed toa hospital in the city from whichfriends assisted him to escape It wasthe habit to haul wood into the courtyard of the hospital in the fall of theyear when the gates were kept frequently opened to admit the wagonsThe physicians having ordered thatKrapotkine should have plenty of airand outdoor exercise he was allowed towalk in this court attended by a singlenurse his physical weakness being suchthat no one thought he would attemptto escape Butdt appears that oneof hisattendants was bribed Through himanVarrangement was made to have adrosky and swift horses outside thegates and one day when they wereopened to admit a load of wood Krapotkine and the nurse slipped out entered the vehicle- and were driven to aplace of concealment from which theyfinally succeeded in escaping to LondonKrapotkine has since been foremostin the councils of the nihilists and hisrank and record have given him greatinfluence His speeches in this country however have not added to hisreputation I heard him in Xew Yorkwhere his audience was small and indifferent His address Tead well but wasdelivered without any force and in atone of voice that was not audible

Indian found their bodies last week andwas angry at the county treasurer because he could not collect the bountiesJack Gilpatrick an aged bearhunter who occupies a camp onthis side of- Chicks hill inthis town gave up the hunt andtook in his traps a month ago and wentto shooting and poisoning bobcats because he could find no bears Late inOctober he went out for more wildcatsand in passing through a beech woodsaw recent traces of a bear that hadbeen scratching up the fallen leavesand eating what few beechnuts of lastyears cfop he could find The nextday Jack went down to the store

judge of a youngwomans looks by a view of her figurefrom behind as a Washington youngman found to his costTwo pedestrians were walking downPennsylvania avenue one afternoon recently A fine looking woman waswalking in front of them Shehad agood figure was well dressed ahdfronvthe distance of probably 50 feet whichintervened between the two men andthe supposedlj beautiful woman shemight have been taken for a DianaIll wager the mj sterious female isas beautiful as Venus and as lovely asAphrodite said one man to the otherMake it a half dozen choice cigarsand Ill go you said the other Farfirom being pretty I am positive thatshe is absolutely homelyThats a go said the man who hadfirst spoken and both increased theirspeed so as to overtake the abject oftheir wager who had been walkingahead of them for probabty a block Asshe was passed the plotters turned andlooked at her in such a manner however as not to disconcert her and thenpassed on The man acknowledged thathe had lost without attempting in theleast to save his bet There was no usefor the lady was really ugly there wasno doubt about that She was terriblyplain and the difference between theappearance of her face and what mighthave been expected from her figure andgeneral make up was surprisingIf joull give me the secret by whichyou found that out I will throw in another half dozen cigars is what theman told his firendThats the easiest thing in the worldif you just tumble to the fact once saidthe other If you had noticed as I didthat although several men passed thewoman coming in our direction notone of them took the trouble to morethan glance at her Some of them dddnot look at her at all If she had beengood ilooking these men would havegiven her more than a glance If shehad been pretty they would have lettheir eyes rest upon her at least untilshe had gotten past them If she hadbeen as beautiful as you imagined theywould haveturned their heads to look ather I noted this and I bet onthis conclusion
