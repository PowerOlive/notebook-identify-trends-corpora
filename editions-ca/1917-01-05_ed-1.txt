With the exception of handling tobacco and feedingstock there has been very little workdone on the farms for the past tennays or two weeks.During the first of the week tobaccocame in case, and was easily preparedfor handling for the imarkets.

The wholehouse was bright with Christinasj greens and gorgeous crimson poinseitas, and old Santa Claus had forgottenone tree and it still stood at one endof the long sun parlor to remind us wewere still in the season of "peace onearth and good will toward men."The speakers of the occasion wereseated at a large round table in thelibrary, and huge windows opening onthe porch and doors leading into halland dining room gave ample opportunity to all to hear the toasts that followed the luncheon.Mrs. Fanniebelle Sutherland, thePresident of the Federation, made aperfect toastmaster. Her introductions were short, to tjhe uoint and fullof wit.Mrs. Frederick A. Wallis, from NewYork, responded first and broughtgreetings to the Club women of Pari?from the Kentucky women of NevYork. She told of their work andhopes and desires in a most interesting fashion and then gave a shortsketch, of the Oriental-Ajnerican Society, of which she is also a member.This Club is composed of the wivesand daughters of Chinese and Japanese men who are in any way connectedwith our government and identifiedwith the mercantile life of the city.The American membership is limitedto 100, but the Oriental members isunlimited.Next on tile program came MissMaymie D. Long, from 'Millsrsburg.Miss Long brought a message fram the20th Century Club, composed ot "19bright women and herself," so she toldus. She said it was a long cry fromNew York to Millersburg, and shedidn't have the interesting things totell us we had just listened to, bubut if we would come to see them wewould find a welcome just as cordial,hearts just as warm, and minds jus-,as ready to grasp, as could be foundin the whole United States.Mrs. Allie Smith Dickson, fromNorth Middletown, claimed to be onlytwo years old, and said she felt justas proud to be with us as sheJiad felcyears ago when she was allowed togo to her big sister's party. TheNorth Middletown Club was organizedin 1914 and last year had taken Modera Drama in their study. Mrs. Dickson's toast was bright and witty andwas frequently interrupted by applause and laughter.Mrs. Wm. G. Talbott told the Federation wjhat it meant to be a Club President, and Mrs. Talbott was surelyuell qualified to speak. She used oneof Uncle Remas' stories as a text, andtold of the attempt of the tortoise tofly. As long as the buzzard held him,all went well, but when the buzzardlet goThe buzzara stood looking at whatwas lett ot tne tortoise, and then said,"You can fly all right, fly as good asanybody; but what you want to do ioto 'learn to light.' "And Mrs. Talbott offered the sameadvice to any young aspirant, "to learnnow to light."Mrs. Sutherland said no matter howfeminine a meeting might be, it simplyseemed impossible to entirely eliminate the masculine. He just "must comein so she asked Mrs. John Davis torespond to the Club Husband.Mrs. Davis was very briet, but hersuggestions were tmasterlv. The idealclub husband was in the future, andthe hope of tihe next veneration ofwomen lay in the training of the sonsoi to-day. Tnus may "wisdom be justified of her children."Mrs. Oakford Hinton said her topicwas scarcely fair. "Is the Club WomanAn Asset to a CoVnmunity?" There wa3nothing to say. The "ayes" ihad itunanimously. She offered many finesuggestions to the women present!along the lines of better streets, bettersiddewalks, better laws (and betterenforced), as well as better homes andbetter wives and better mothers andbetter babies.Mrs. Geo. Stuart's subject was "Sidelights on Club Work," and in hercapable hands .Droved a veritable"search light."
