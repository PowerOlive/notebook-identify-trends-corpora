Orphans Defeat Paris.
In the game at Alt. Sterling yester
day Paais was defeated by a score of
7 to 3.
FRIDAY.
In a listless game at White Park Fri
day afternoon Paris was defecated by
Lexington bv a score of 10 to 4. Hau
ser, who was on the mound for Paris,
was very ineffective, 'and the visitors
connected with hiscurves for fourteen
clean hits. &While Turner was hit for
eleven he managed to keep them suffi
ciently scattered to be of little benefit.
SATURDAY.
Paris and Mt. Sterling met Satur
day, resulting in a victoryfor the Bour
bonites by a score of 9 to 5.
The visitors could do but little with
Dunlap, who held them to five hits,
two of which came in the laRt inning.
The locals drove Funk from the mound
in the second inning, and he was suc
ceeded bv Knight. Shook featured
with the bat, getting three hits out of
four trips to the plate, two doubles and
a single.
SUNDAY.-
The masterly pitching of Friedley
was too much for Paris Sunday after
noon, and the Orphans took the final
game of the series by score of 3 to 1.
Perkins, a recruit, was sent to the
mound and started the game, but be
foie the side had deen retired he was
relieved by Hauser. The visitors took
advantage of every opportunty and
sewed ud the contest in the fiist in
ning. The locals fielded a perfect
game but could not connect with Fried
ley Their onlv run was the result of
pass and two errors.

Representative in Paris.
Thomas Y. Witherspoon, Jr., of Cin
cinnati, 0.,reDresenting the Associated
Publishers Company, arrived in Paris
Saturday to interest the leading busi
ness men and merchants of this com
munity in the company.
The Associated Pulishers' Company
is a combination of the leading news
papers in the county seats of Ken
tucky, who will issue a monthly maga
zine supplement with their papers.
The company will embrace other
States, and gives excellent promise of
becoming one of the leading publish
ing concerns in the country. "Numer-
! ous representative citzens of this com
munity have already become financially
interested in the entemrise, and as
only a limited number of shares of
the company can be sold in Bourbon
county, the length of Mr. Wither
spoon's stay in Paris is problematical.
School Per Capita $4.05.
The schoul per capita to be Daid by
the State of Boubion county for the
ensueing year will be $4.05; Fayette
54.01: Clark 54.03; Jassemine 4.02
and Woodford 54 04'
The difference in the per capita is
caused bv the difference in wthe dog
tax collected in each county and the
difference in the amount on interest
due on bonds to the various counties,
heretofore issued Ito the counties or
school money due to them.
Narrowly Dscaped Serious
Injury.
A peculiar accident to an automobile
tire which occurred yesterday after
noon caused Jconsiderable excitement
on Main street and endangered the life
of Miss Mayme Neal, bookkeeper in
the department store of Mr. "Harry
Simon?
The automobile of Mr. Sidney G.
Clay was being driven down the street
and at a point in front of J. T. Hin
ton's store one of the rear tres blew
out. The force of the escaping air dis
lodged the rim of the wheel, hurling
it on the pavement with great force
and striking Miss Neal, who was pass
ing. The iron lira tore her 'dress skirt in
several places but she escaped with
out injury, which is regarded as mi
raculoufl. Had the car been on a
higher elevation the accident would
probably havehad a "serious result.
