plannedThere was no presidential salute flredby the naval reserves from the old revenue cutter Andrew Johnson the cannon of steam and sail craft did notbelch forth in deafening sounds in welcome of the president banners andflags did not flutter in the breeze inhonor of his comingThere was reason for the absence ofall this ceremony which had beenplanned on an elaborate scale It waslacking because the presidential partyarrived in Cleveland several hoursahead of time or rather the time anticipated by those who had plannedthe local receptionThe Comanche which brought thepresidential party from Buffalo arrived inside of the Cleveland harbor at230 oclock There she lay at anchoruntil 7 oclock when she steamed intothe inner harbor and made fast at thedock of the Pennsylvania CoSenator Hanna was

Dispatcher -orAny Public Telegraph StationChicago Aug 30 -The most difficultproblem of railroad operation how -tocommunicate by telegraph with a moving train anywhere on the line hasbeen solved by a young Chicago inventor Edison who has been experimenting with induction currents has beenfairly beaten on his own chosengroundGeorge V Trott a former telegraphoperator has devised a system -whichwill shortly be put in operation on thePensylvania line by which every trainon the line is in constant communication with the station next ahead andwhen desired with he train dispatcher or any public telegraph stationBriefly every train on a road equipped with the Trott system would atall times be on a loop circuit extending to the next telegraph stationahead and to send messages farther orreceive them from other stations theoperator at the proper station wouldonly have to cut in by means of ajack spring on one of the regulartelegraph wiresMr Trottfs device is exclusively mechanical It involves no new or untried principles and will require nomore power to operate it then the ordinary duplex cell battery at the regular telegraph stationThe device which railway engineersdeclare will revolutionize railway service is an adaptation of the street railway trolley or third rail of the elevatedrailwaysTwo insulated metallic tracks arelaid between and parallel to the traction rails They are not connectedand at intervals equal in length to thecircuit it is desired to establish arediscontinuous and separated by anon conducting cushion A trolleymechanism consisting of three pairsof wheels connected in multiple by knuckle joints and hinged tothe footboard of the engine runs under the tender on the inner rails Thecontact of the metallic wheels withthe metallic rails closes the circuit asthe wheels are joined by a metallacframework Insulated wires conductthe current into the engine cab and bymeans of the bell cord into any part ofthe train where there is an instrument Trott

breaking myheart to catch the New York trainthe Johannisberg omnibus was actuallystopped in a jam of vehicles somewherealong in this square and I was afraidwed miss itOn either side of the grass grownstreets were the costly monuments ofthe sham citys brief day of activity andlife Lofty buildings empty from cellar to roof rows of vacant store roomslined with dusty shelving and litteredwith the forlorn debris of hasty removals shattered glass on the sidewalk withered grass festooning thecornices and in front of the dismantled Bank of Ailacoochee the skeletonof an electric car left to dissolve peacefully on the rusty tracks in the roadway Here and there the desolationwas emphasized rather than relievedby a scanty and shop worn display inthe windows of some merchant whohad been unwilling or unable to joinhis neighbors in the general exodusfollowing the crash pitiable flotsamand jetsam left by the high tide ofcommerce to bleach and molder on therocks of an uncharted island in theocean of traffic Of these strandedwrecks the most notable was the storeof a dealer in hardware just acrossfrom the Chiwassee national bankThat is where I bought my pistolon the night of the garroting saidPhilip telling the driver to pull up atthe curbstoneThe proprietor of the place was sitting on a spool of barbed wire in frontof his own door and heroseand crossedthe sidewalk in response to Philipssalutation Oh its you is it MrThorndyke I didnt know you atfirst Ccmo back to take a look at thecorpseIt amounts to that Im afraid saidPhilip sympatheticallyIt does for a fact just that Allwc need now is a good old fashionedearthquake not the fever-and-aguekind you read about iiowadays but thesort they used to put in the geographieswhen we went to school a shake witha big crack in the middle of it to burythe wreck decently out of sightIts dreadful said Philip notknowing what else to say Why didntyou get away writh the rest of themThe man made a pathetic gesture ofhelplessness There were twoPhil I think you deserve great credit for notfalling in love with hersons In the first place I bought mystock and paid for it so I missed thehelp of the deputy sheriffs and thecreditors they made the move easy formost of em I tell you Then againit costs money to move a stock of hardware even if you know where to takeit and I dontI think youre more to be pitied thanthe others ventured PhilipYoure right about that Its a terrible thing to be anchored in a deadtown and thats what I am both anchors down and stuck in the mud withthe windlass broken at that The mansmiled at his own joke and went backto his scat on the spool of wire whenPhilip told the driver to turn down intothe manufacturing districtIn the space between the railway andthe river the air of desolation was evenmore oppressive than in BroadwayTall chimneys standing guard overmany windowed factories whose wallshad never vibrated with the jar of theexpensive machinery left to rust andcrumble within them piles of costlylumber warping and twisting in theweather rows of cottages built for theoperatives tenantless now save for anoccasional family of negroes livingrent free in the industrial desert Itseemed like a desecration to break thesilence and neither of them spoke untilthe carriage had reached the bisectingstreet of the old townThis is Ailacoochee the originalsaid Philip and I fancy it has goneback to just what it was in the antediluvian days Theres the Mountainhouse fine old southern mansion theytold me it used to be Thats the oldcourthouse at the head of the streetwhere I found the deed you knowThis is Catrons store and the placenext door well if that isnt nerveThe exclamation pointed at a slimfigure standing before a doorway overwhich swung a faded sign bearing theinscription Simon Pragmore NotaryPublic The figure lifted its slouch hatat sight of the carriage and its occupants and out of its sallow and immobile face came the courteous salutation Good mawnin Misteh Thorndyke glad to see you lookin so wellsehI suppose that is Mr Pragmoresaid Helen a little laterPhilip was wrestling with a ghost ofindignation Of course it is and tothink that he has the assurance to comeback here and go on with his businessas though nothing had happened Frefsfa mind to stop over and revive thtcharge against himIndeed you wont do anything of thekind retorted Helen and Philipchanged the subjectHave you seen enough of the placehe askedYesWell I havent Drive back upBroadway past the Guaranty buildingand then take the road up the LittleChiwassee this last to the old negroOpposite the office building of thedefunct town company they stoppedagain When the crash came therewere many sufferers and evidencesof rascality on the part of the companys agents were not lacking Therehad been a mob and a riot and the companys offices had suffered first andmost The four storied building of brickand stucco had been first gutted andthen bombarded with such missiles asimpotent rage could find It stood grimand gaunt with battered walls and unglazed openings a monument more pitiful than its fellows and yet lessworthy since its owners gained whereall others lostHelen shivered and drew her wrapcloser as if the desolation made hercold Lets go on she said Itstoo dreadful its like being in a cemetery with the graves all opened and thedead people staring at you out of theirbroken coffinsSo fleet the works of menBack to the earth againquoted Philip giving the order to thedriverWhen they had passed the dismantledJohannisberg with its once beautifullawn grown up into a weedy desertPhilip pointed to a last summers cornfield across the Little ChiwasseeThat was inmy day he said Lots sold over therefor 150 a front footThe old negro pulled his horse intoan unwilling trot and the carriagerolled around the shoulder of Johnsmountain in a cloud of yellow dustthe ruined street suddenly became aquiet country road and the dead citylay behind them An hour later theyhad climbed the spur bounding theScotchmans farm and Philip pointedout a comfortable stone farmhousenestling against the sloping bosom ofthe mountainThats Duncans he said as theyrattled down to the gate and theresElsie Mrs Robert Protheroe I shouldsay standing in the door with my godson in her armsThey were expected though notuntil later in the day and Mrs Duncan and Elsie were

laughed and then it suddenlyoccurred to the good housewife thather guests must be craving the privacywhich is the time honored right of travelers in all climes whereupon therewas more kindly bustle and Philip andHelen were shown up to the little bedroom under the eavesHelen sat down on the bed wbiePhilip was unstrapping the valiseShes pretty Phil very pretty andsweet enough to be taken

they do notsuffer from any weather All threeapartments are also covered outsidewith similar skins of striped lions asubstance that lasts forever And inside they are all lined with ermine andsable these two being the finest andmost costly furs in existence For arobe of sable large enough to line amantle is worth 2000 bezants of goldor 1000 at least and this kind of skinis called by the Tartars

TUESDAY AUGUST 31 1897GREASE STOPPED ENGINEExciting Incident Responsible forof an Eastern RoadWhen the road was first built theBtory telling railroad man continuedwhich now runs from Harrisburg toCanandaigua N Y it was nicknamedthe Davy Crockett and for many yearsthereafter the name clung It wasbrought about in this wayOne dark night when the conductorwas taking three passenger carsthrough to Sunbury he noticed theheadlight of a locomotive in the rearHe instantly informed the engineer ofthe fact and both began speculatingwhat it meant The train was runningat a high rate of speed but the headlight in the rear was gaining steadilyon them As there was no lights inthe rear of the headlight they conpluded it must be an empty engineThat road twists in and out among themountains and skirts the banks of theSusquehanna river in such a way aato permit anyone looking back to observe what is going on in the rear for aconsiderable distanceThe conductor ordered the engineerto pwt on more steam and the latteinulled the throttle wide open Thenfollowed a wild chase through thenight Pursuer and pursued tore alongat the highest speed Everybody on thecars believed that the engineer of thepursuing engine was either drunk orcrazyAt last a bright idea struck the engineer He recalled the fact that alocomotive can make little progress on-greasy rails The contents of twolarge cans of lard oil were poured onthe tracks from the rear of the lastpassenger coach The idea proved agreat one Soon the headlight of thepursuing engine grew dim in the distance Wlfen it was safe to do so thetrain stopped and backed up to solvethe mystery A very funny sight wasrevealedOne of the finest engines on the roadcalled the Davy Crockett they gavethe locomotives names in those daysinstead of numbers had broken awayfrom a hostler up in Williamsport andstarted down the track on a voyage oidestruction The oil poured on thetrack had baffled all the destructiveabilities that locomotive possessedThere stood the

OF MEXICOA Vicious Brute Which Seems to HaveNo Notion of FearThe most vicious and fearless of thebrute creation is the peccary or wildhog of Mexico says C W Bartlett ofLaredo Tex This animal seems utterly devoid of the emotion of fear Ihave never seen it turn a hairs breadthout of its path for any living thingMan is its special bete noir It displaysan intelligence in fighting the humanstrangely at variance with its apparently complete lack of mental instinctThey are rarely found singly but go indroves of from hundreds to thousandsTheir ability to scent men is particularly marked I have known a drove ofthem to scent a man a mile off andstrike as straight for him as an arrowflies There is no use to try to frightenthem with guns The cannonading ofa full batteiy would have no more effecton them than the popping of a firecracker The only thing to do whenthey get after you is to run away fromthem as fast as a horse can carry youAnd then there is no certainty thatthey wont catch you They are nearly as swift as a horse and their endurance is as great as their viciousnessA friend of mine encountered adrove of them in a wild part of Mexicoa few years ago and his escape wasmiraculous He very f oolishty shot andwounded a number of them Then hetook refuge in a tree The peccarieskept him in the tree all that day andthrough the night They circled roundthe tree grunting and squealing theirdelight at the prospect of a feast Hesoon exhausted his ammunition andbrought down a peccary at each fireBut this had no terrors for the beastsAlong toward morning the brutes began to eat the ones he had killed andwhen they thus satisfied the cravingsof their stomachs they formed in lineand trotted off If they had not hadsome of their own number to devourthey would have guarded that tree until my friend through sheer exhaustiondropped from his perch and allowedthem to make a meat off him Thewildcats and tigers that infest the Mexican wilds flee from the peccaries withinstinctive fear

almost hidden among the treesand about a dozen yards from the roadI would have passed by without noticing it at all but for a small flag polewhich stood in front of it from whichwaved the flag of Cuba

now it seems to meASthat I must always have been inlove with Bertha Maxwell CertainlyI know that if I try to fix the time whenit became an accepted fact upon whichI thought while awake and dreameda thousand tender dreams while sleeping I find it quite impossible to do soAs a matter of fact we had grown uptogether Herbert Maxwell the banker-ofB n and my own dear old governor who was a retired colonel andlived on his pension and a small butconvenient income which alas is nowmine through his death had been lifelong friends And so when my fatherreturned from 20 years service in Indiait was taken for granted that he wouldsettle down in B n and pass theevening of his life with the dear oldchum of his boyhoodWhether these two as they sat overtheir evening grog laid plans andwove schemes for the united fortuneof Bertha and myself I have never quiteknown but the ill concealed grief myfather displayed when certain untoward events came between us andfor a long dreary hopeless time blottedthe sun- from our sky led me to believesoAt any rate Berthas buddiug girlhood and my awkward boyhood werespent together We played tennis wewent fishing we took long walksthrough the beautiful country whichsurrounded B n and so we insensibly grew into each others lives andbecame a daily necessity to each otherAt this time Bertha was to me themost beautiful of human beings in-deed she is so still and never for asingle moment has anyone else seemedquite so fair or so lovely Her figurewas lithe and graceful her step whenshe walked buoyant with overflowinghealth and her cheeks dyed with thatrich hue so often seen in those of southern birth while her eyes were at onceserene and thoughtful or brimmingover with mirth and mischief She hada thousand little ways peculiar to herself all of Avhich 1 now know endearedher to meHowever I must come to my storyfor if I run on about Bertha I shallnever cease The hair is frosty aboutmy temples now and my step is notso quick as it once was but a little ladywho now walks beside me through thesame green lanes often looks up archlyin my face and says Dad you dolike to talk about mother And soI doWell the time came for me to go awayto complete my education When weparted I remember it as if it wereyesterday Bertha kissed me over andover again It was however only as ayoung and iunocent girl shekissedmeand as she stood in the doorwaj between my father and hers waving atearful farewell it was to a chum anda playmate of childhood only that heradieus were givenFour years passed swiftty away Ioccasionally saw Bertha and I at leastknew that the camaraderie of our childliood was at an end Bertha had growninto the most queenly creature in theworld and had taken her place quiteundisputed cs the belle of B n Hermanner with me was as charming asever but there was a slight constraintat such times as we were altogetheralone not the constraint of formalitybut that of diffidence For my part Ifound that instead of decreasing herattractions to me my absence hadserved to enhance them To me she wasthen what she ever has been the one-woman in the world Every day I resolved to put my fate to the test buthesitation born of timidity preventedme and the time passed away withoutany ever giving utterance to the wordsof lova and passion which I longed tospeakBut if I hesitated there were othersmore bold indeed Bertha at everygarden party or other social function in the neighborhood was alwaysthe center of a group of devoted admirers Among them all Eoyal Phelps waspreeminent alike for his handsome person and for a certain fascination ofmanner which made him popular withmen and women alike He stood oversix feet had fair hair and blue eyes andan athletic frame in which grace andstrength were equally apparentBertha while appearing to share thegeneral admiration for him neverseemed quite at ease in his presenceand it was perhaps this evident constraint whenever he was present whichled my father to chaff me pleasantly oneevening after dinner by sayingCharlie my boy you had better notlet your bird of paradise remain uncaged much longer or some one elsemay catch it And then the dear oldfellow laughed and winked at me mysteriously as though he were quite inthe knowI think it was the presence of EoyalPhelps and many suggestive hints abouthis devotion to Bertha which finally determined me to put to the test mychance of happiness with herIt was a bright and lovely day inJune and a large party had assembledupon the spacious lawn in front of ourbungalow as my father always calledhis house Bertha had never seemed tome so fair so altogether worthy of mylove and my life Early in the afternoon for she had come before the restto aid us in arranging for our numerousguests I had seen her color rise as Imade some slight remark about her appearance and as our hands met Ithought hers treidbled Was it myimagination Or was she too like melonging to acknowledge- her loveI shall not be with you log BerthaI said hoping thus to prepare the wayfor my proposal I shall be leavingfor Hong Kong within a month to takeup my appointmentYes yes Charlie I have heard it allfrom father he says you passed yourexams with flying colors I am sogladGlad glad of the fate which banishes me from England and fromBut she did not let me finish the sentenceNo of course not that it will beawfully lonely without you and theold place wont seem like itself a bitbut still youre a man and you have gotto make your name and way in theworld and Im glad that you are makingso good a startI could look forward to my life inthe east Bertha dear with a greatdeal more joy if the prospect were notso lonely Berthas eyes fell beforemy ardent gaze and I fancied that herlips trembled and I hastened to put anend to the tension we were both underwhen a rollicking voice broke in uponusAh here you are Bertha Whatand Charlie too Ah I hope I amnot de trop Shall I come again Haha and Bojal Phelps laugh rang outclear and loud but with a touch ofcynicism in its ringNot for the world replied Berthacrimsoning to her hair we were justarranging the games for the day andnow you can help us And so thegolden moment passed and the wordI had been longing to speak remainedunspoken then and alas remained unspoken for many bitter yearsTennis and gossip and tea andlaughter and merrymaking soon spedthe afternoon I had succeeded withthe aid of Berthas cousin Eva Winthrop in beating Eoyal and Bertha attennis and had then given myself to theduties of hospitalityAt last however I found nself freeand went in search of Bertha resolvedto endure my uncertainty no longerI approached the library window andhad almost entered the room when Iheard Berthas voice It was clear andcold and positiveNo I have told you how impossible it is I should wrong you and mjself I cannot marry you because Ido not lovevou-I was about to beat a hasty retreatfrom my false position when Eoyalswords chained me to the groundIts for that proud brute CharlieI suppose Im thrown over Oh welltake him but curse him IllYou forget yourself I have not saidI love another certainly I have not saidI love Charlie We are old friends thatis all nothing more He is no more tome than youBut I could staj to hear no moreand with heart beating I gained myown room and hid my grief from thecurious eyes about me And so thiswas the end He is no more to methan you Oh cruel words AndI ah there to me she was more thanall the world besideGovernor if you dont mind I thinkIll spend the next few weeks in London Ive a good deal to do before sailing and if you will run up with me wecan be pretty much together until IleaveAll right my boy I shall be delighted but I thought ah well nevermindwhat I thought I shall be ready whenever you areAnd so the next day we slipped awayto town I leaving a brief note forBertha saying I hoped to see her againbefore sailing though I knew full wellthat I should not dare to see her witnthose words still ringing in my earsHe is no more to me than youI will not dwell on the days my dearold father and myself spent together inLondon They were the last I everspent with him He died three monthsafter I left England We were asbrothers together then and he enteredinto all my plans with greater zest thanmyself and when at lastl told himhow and why I had come to resign allthought of Bertha his deiection seempdI as real and as deep as

theOriental carried me away from homeand all I loved to ChinaOf my life in Hong Kong I need notspeak in detail It was a combinationof hard work which soon led to promotion and such sports as are to befound in the island Having been ablue at Oxford I was soon well to thefront in cricketing circles and singularly enough it was my interest incricket which led to consequences toBertha and myself as far reaching asthey were sad I had been chosen asone of the eleven to represent HongKong against Shanghai upon the sadand memorable occasion when theBokhara was wrecked on the return voyage and with a few exceptions allhands were lost By what seemed tome the merest fluke at the time I managed to cling to a plank and after being tossed about till nearly dead bythe surf was thrown ashore thoroughly exhausted The news of the catastrophe cast a gloom over the entire European population and it was cabledhome that all were ost Before thenewrs was corrected Bertha was married and married to Eoyal PhelpsHer father shortly after the deathof mine had succumbed to pneumoniaand Bertha with her mother hadgreatly to their surprise been left incomparative poverty So that whenEoyal renewed his suit Bertha hadyielded and to gain a home for hermother had consented to an early marriage And when the news reachedEngland that I with two others hadbeen saved from the Bokhara Berthawas already the wife of another Ishall never forget the effect upon meof the news that she was no longerfree The meaning seemed to havebeen taken out of life and for me therewas no joy in the present no hope inthe futureTwo dreary years passed away and Icame home having resigned my appointment in the east resolved to settle down in England and devoteto those literary pursuits for whichI believed myself to be better suitedthan for public service I had no intention of settling in B n Theplace was too full of sad suggestionsto prove inviting to me I was compelled to go down there however shortly after my arrival to attend to thedisposition of certain family belongings and it was then for the first timesince that fateful afternoon that Iagainsaw Bertha How changed shewas Not that she was less beautifulbut her proud face was oh so sad Itseemed as though she had gonethrougha world of sorrow since I last saw herHer greeting was one almost too painful for either of us and when she saidWe all thought you were drownedyou are as one risen from the deadI realized that sHe would never havebeen the wife of Eoyal Phelps but forthe news of my death What I saw andlearned in B n made me resolve tostay there for the present at least Ido not know how I came to suspect- itbut the suspicion grew and at last became absolute knowledge that EoyalPhelps was turning the life of the onlywoman I had ever loved into miseryI had always known him to be of areckless disposition but I had notdreamed that he was addicted to gambling drunkenness and debaucheryI did not see him often and I scarcelyever saw Bertha when I did her facewas so sad so silently and uncomplainingly sad that it was all I coulddo to look at it and remain quiet Asfor Eoyal he had grown gross in person and coarse in manner and scareclyever seemed quite sober And so thedays passed from a distasace I watchedmy proud beautiful darJing pine andlade till I feared that death mirhtstep in to interfere whete I was powerless Thus thinirs went on till onfiU 7night I wassummoned bv a messagefrom Berthas mother Comely we are in great troubleI went and found the doctor there before me and learned that an hour before Eoyal had come home drunk andupon meeting his wife had first abusedher and then struck her a- cruel blowwhich had left- her senseless at his feetHe had then sallied forth ngain leaving his wife for all he knew deadThere was little I could do but creepback to my solitary miseiy and spendthe night in agonizing reflections uponthe past But when the day at lengthbroke I had resolved that the man whohad robbed me of my darling only tomaltreat and make her miserable mustanswer for his brutality to meThere is however a higher powerthan any we can wield which often intervenes in the affairs of man whenleast expected and before I ever sawEoyal Phelps again that power hadplaced him forever beyond the reach ofearthly retribution While still halfwild with drink he had mounted tofollow the hounds and a few hoursafterwards was carried home deadWe never speak of those dreadfuldays now long passed In the old hometo which Bertha clings with tenaciouseffection we are living- a life as nearlyperfect in happiness as ever falls tomortal lot The old light has comeback to my darlings eyes the old timebuoyancy to her tep As I write theselines upon lifting my eyes I see her anda smaller Bertha laughing and playingupon the lawn together and I knowthat if the news of my death was thebeginning of misery for her she is atleast happy forever St PaulJohn Huff died at Hyden Ky atthe age of 99 leaving 78

the expenses of a lawsuitwould be more than any damage thatcould be secured The right thing todo is to post notices Hunting notpermitted on this farm and then ifthey insisted on doing it order themoff

thoroughbred herd of hogs on everyfarm a prominent hog raiser saidIf my plan could prevail I wouldhave nothing but pure bred hogs inthis country I do not mean by thaithat every herd should be registeredThat would be an expensive uselessness but I do mean that all stockshould be traceable to recorded ancestry Then let the registered herds bekept up to the highest standard of excellence to supply a male head for eaclof these pork herds The professionalbreeder would then do a flourishingbusiness and the farmer would not belooking around for the best hog inChristendom for ten dollars He woulddemand something better than thatand would be reaping the profit whichhe justly deserves from feeding hisfarm produce to a class of hogs thatwould net a snug profit and commanda premium on any market whetherhigh or low and at the same time havea bunch of hogs that he could takeinfinite satisfaction in hanging onthe fence to look at and to show hisneighbor because they always callforth favorable comment and admiration which would be an incentive forsomething a little better if possible f oithe next crop I say that until the thoroughbred hog shall be given a place onevery farm his true mission is not foilfilled and further that the -mission ofthe professional breeder if he be honestand unselfish and ees the whole thoroughbred scheme in its proper light isnot fulfilled until such is the case Ifevery farmer could see this plan fromthe proper standpoint and could comprehend the advantages accruing fromits consummation three years at mostwould accomplish the work Butthough firm in the faith as I am I havegrave douTots if it is ever accomplishedThere is too great a diversity in humannature too wide a range of dispositiontoo many scrub men too much difference to ever expect to see all the farmers stand on a level in any branch ofindustry However the cause is advancing and one fact is well established that when a man once gets ataste of thoroughbred blood like

in mineral plant food andthis as the water evaporates is left onthe surface as a crust which effectuallyexcludes light and air When this crustis turned under it is dissolved by themoisture and makes a rich food forplants Besides the cultivation opensthe soil to receive air thus drying thesoil and turning the air itself intomoisture This enormously increasesavailable plant food in the soil Besides

eye which but a shorttime ago was considered absolutely incurable the so called detaching orpeeling- of the retina vhich sometimesfollows a case of retinitis This disease consists in the shrinkage of theaqueous humor a watery slightly saltyfluid which lies between the cornea andthe crystalline lens with the greaterpart of its substance in front of theiris If the quantity of this fluid islessened to a certain extent the eyesight is absolutely destroyed and thephysicians can do nothing but pronounce the disease incurable NowProf Deutschmann has succeeded inintroducing into the diseased eye saysthe Philadelphia Becord a sufficientamount of the aqueous hunjor takenfrom a live rabbits eye to restore thelost sight Several cases where thismost delicate operation was successfully performed are on record the oneof a purser on one of the steamers ofthe Hamburg American line being mostinteresting This man totally blindthree years ago was able to resume hisformer occupation after
