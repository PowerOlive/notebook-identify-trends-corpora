The formal opening "of the De
partment .of Elementary Work of
the Methodist church took place at
9:30 o'clock Sunday morning when

partment was -given. Miss Maude
Taylor, Superintendent, was assisted
in the work by Mrs. C. O. Hinton,
Hoy Pepper, Miss Ruth Orr, Mrs.
Henry A. Power and Mrs. T. J.
Flora. A, special room has been fitted
out, where the children of the ele
mentary grade may receive instruc
tion apart from the adults of the
congregation.
The meeting of the Christian
Endeavor Society of the Presbyte
rian church Sunday night was made
especially interesting by an address
to the new officers delivered by
Emmett M. Dickson. The new offi

Billy Wilson, vice-president; Miss
Emily Fithian, secretary; "Wendell
Reading, treasurer.
The million dollar committeee of
Grand Lodge of Kentucky reports
about $1,100,000 subscribed. Since
the purchase of the new site for the
buildings, the commitee has discov
ered that it will take considerably
more money than they originally
contemplated, and for that reason,
and acting under the authority of
the grand master of the Grant!
Lodee of Kentucky, the committee
will make an effort to increase the
subscriptions to $1,500,000.
Great activity is being displayed
by the subordinate lodges, Knights
'of Pythians, through the St;ate in
increasing their membership. The
request of the Grand Chancellor
that every lodge increase its mem
bership at least 40 members "fturing
the calendar year 1922 is working
fine. Many lodges are going after
this number in thje first six months
so their summer vacation won't be
disturbed.
The initiatory degree was confer-"
red on W. O. Cruse by Bourbon
Lodge I. O. O. F. last week, and two
other candidates took the work at
the meeting last night. The degree
team is doing fine work, and the at
tendance and interest grows larger
at each meeting.
The girls' orchestra from the Odd
Fellows' Orphan Home, Lexington,
will give a concert consisting of re
citations, singing and instrumental
music at the auditorium of the Pans
city school Friday night, May 28,
at 7:30 o'clock. Bourbon Lodge
will bear all . expenses, the admission
fee, 25 cents, going to the children
for their pleasure and recreation
during the summer. Let us give
them an immense crowd. Any Odd
Fellow will sell you a ticket.
