Mrs. Clay was the daughter of the
late Captain and Mrs. Daniel Tur
ney, both prominent residents of
Paris, and who preceded ner w me
grave many years ago. She was of a
bright, cheery disposition, and her
amiability created such an atmos
phere of happiness in the home and
in her presence that it was like an
inspiration. She was all that a lov
ing and devoted wife and mother
could have been, and in all her du-
Hpr held strictly to the line or
fidelity and faithfulness. She was
beloved by the large circle of friends
and acquaintances who held her in
the highest esteem, and these, with
the sorrowing relatives, have lost a
golden link from the inner circle.
She was a devoted member of the
Paris Presbyterian church, and took
an active interest in all its societies.

BIRTHS, t
An elderly woman in Clermont
Ferand, Auvergne, has received a
letter addressed to her mother in
June, 1857. It was from her father,
discussing the education of a
brother, now 75. The letter arrived
by post without explanation of the
delay. The original addressee has
been dead 15 years.
' THE NEWS once upon a time re
ceived a letter from our Millers
burg correspondent written two
days before its receipt here. The
postmark showed it had been mailed
oh the day it was written. A mem
ber of THE NEWS staff sent - a
special delivery letter to Lexington,
mailing it at six o'clock m me
morning. The letter was delivered
at the Lexington address at 5:35
that afternoon. And so we might
go on adding instances without num-
