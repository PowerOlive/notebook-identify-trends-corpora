Bison Practically Wiped Out.
How effectually the bison has been
exterminated may be seen from the
fact that a fine head lent by Idaho
people for the land show at St. Paul
is insured for $2,000. One used to
cost a morning gallop and a ball from
a big pistol.

found in his trunk an old diary with
the entry: "August 10, 1887. Went
to the railroad station to see my sister

was there to see his sister off, and In.
the rush and noise and confusion we
got mixed and I hugged his sister and.
he hugged mine." Boston Transcript.
