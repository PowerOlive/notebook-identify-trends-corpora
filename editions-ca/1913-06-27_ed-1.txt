For a long time eachand every organization that was helping the movement has been workingindependently. Now there is a desireto get together. The following reportof a special committee on the workof the Sunday school association andthat of the Louisville Commercial club,will explain itself. ' fThe Kentucky . Sunday School association has a splendid organization.Every county has some form of organization. Many of the people whoare interested in all the best interestsof the county are numbered amongthose who are connected with this association. These persons can be given a broader view of what the Sunday school, the public school and thehome could do for the entire community, reaching into the physical, mental, social and spiritual developmentNot only the city pastors, but therural pastors, who are in a measureleaders in the communities, are connected with the Sunday School asso-jelation, and in many cases the publicschool teachers, superintendents of thecounty schools and others engaged ineducational work. "The Commercial club is reachingthrough its wide system of publicity, jthe prizes it has been offering, and;the correspondence conducted, manywho are interested in truest education!but whose viewpoint is different fromthat of Sunday school workers. tne Jxentucicy Sunday School asso-iciation holds conventions in almost,every county in the state every 3 ear.attended by thousands of the bettercitizens. In addition to this severalhundred district conventions and near-,ly a thousand rallies and conferencesare held. This association also publishes the Kentucky Sunday SchoolReporter with a circulation of about5,000 per month. jThese two organizations could great- jly strengthen and advance the workboth are doing by securing one or more ,persons in each county who would rep- jresent both organizations. Under the!flit'OPfinn rf cnli nnronno o cthtqtt rf .many counties might be made, finding--- v. VI- iv.WU I,1UVUC C. OtA. J JA.the present conditions and forming acommon basis for future woik. At theconventions held time could be givenfor the discussion of topics of vital in.jterest for the upbuilding of the com-munity, school, home and Sundayschool and the length of the convention be increased to two entire days.The same thing could be done in distiict convention, rallies and institutes.By holding conferences where a wider,range of topics would be presented keacn would ue able to reacn manythat have not yet become interested.Then each could help the other.Therefore we suggest:First. That in the fnruie on all programs of institutes., com tMitions andrallies there be given a topic relatingto the corelation of secular and religious education in f lie state along definite lines and that this topic be assigned to a person well informed onboth religious and secular education.In such way there might be the opportunity of bringing to the attentionof people who have never thought onthe matter the value of such correlation. Because of the wide opportunity which the Sunday school speakerhas of reaching audiences in the statethis would be the surest way of arousing enthusiasm, disseminating informa-1tion and removing prejudice.Second. -Tnat in the future at allelecting conventions district, countyand state there be chosen superintendents wlio shall promote the co-operationof becular and religious educational forces along definite lines.Third. That whenever opportunitiesarise the possibility of the use of thechurch as a social center be emphasized and encouraged, making a possible opening for the dissemination ofeducational ideas.Fourtli. That at the state convention this work be made a distinct feature of the program and if possible adepartment session be given it.The Truant Law.When this law is so openly set atnaught as to bring a particular case tothe attention of the public it is timethat a halt was called and the malefactor made to suffer for his shortcomings. The sending of a child toschool is a moral duty, and when thismoral duty is neglected by thosewhose duty it is to obserye it is theduty of the authorities to step in andtake a hand. We want to say that ifthe county superintendent's attentionis called to some flagrant violation andshe Is compelled to act the strong armof the law will fall in no gentle manner' upon the shoulders of the malefactor. Better send the kiddies to school,Yhich is your duty, and where theybelong and thereby fulfill your moralobligation as well as avoid a conflictith the school authorittes.-Central1913flffrWoiitaci IsSSae9IME3iNo worgsn vrants to look oltL Mary in. their efTort to lookyouthtfe5orttothe'bcaJtydocto s r-r"n.t!'i.3.1heirici3-take13 fat thjy visit tho wrong uarartmcntin thedruijatore.Boat.'jr depends upon health.Wory, sleepless night., hcaJache-3, pni-s, disorders, irregulintiJind weaknesses or a d:;r nt.y i nunne character in asnort tjme brine the dull eye, 1h;j"crow j f set," ths haggardlooky droop in jc shoulders, and tne filter 1113 stei..To 'tain the appearand of -r rn 50a nusi retain health.Inroad of lotions, powders and p-ints. ask your drugziac foeFavorite PrescriptionTJiis famous medicine tnkP3 at the vrry root of ti"30enenuea of your youthful appparancc It make3 yoa notonly look young, but fsel yuuns.Your drogglat can supplyyouinnquJdorSajIoiforntiorcndww ww- . .-"iKi . wr. riBfcos inviua Motel and Sar-.gleal Institute, Buf 7a!o, W.Y. and trial box will be mailed you..Some Hot News.We will in a few days receive a car of SemiAnthricite Coal.

Many farmers have to go serial miles to vote. If roads are dejt cent they go. ' If rains have come, theroads are turned into mud lanes,where travel at two miles per hour is 1an effort, the farmer stays at home.?It is very wrong of him, but veryI'liuman, and almost any one would act" the same in his place."t These statements are easily susceptible of proof. When there is bad, weather on election daythe rural votet lalls off, and it falls off most in thoseI remote sections where road improvei jnent is unknown. Many country vot-f ers prefer loosing their votes to traveling long distances over muddy andsloppy roads.The bad road aids bad citizenship inanother way, in that it is an obstacleto popular education. Many of therural school houses are accessible only"ty traveling over highways that areall but impassible. Attendance on theschools thus is cut down, and it is a"Well-known fact that regular attendance at school is absolutely necessaryif the pupil is to maintain his interestin his duties and make satisfactoryeducational progress.. The countrychurches are factor for better citizenship, but the situation with these ismuch the same as with respect to theschools.The truth is that bad roads retardprogress in every way and everythingwhich retards progress does not tendto betterment of citizenship. Ignorance and isolation do not equip menfor the intelligent exercise of suffrage,and the only hope of improvement ofgovernment is in the'spread of enlightenment among the people.EHRMAN.Mr. A. J.

I'm not very old and amjust learning, where to find the bestthings to eat My favorite pjaces arein the spittoon iu the sitting room andthe uncovered garbage can on the backporch. Of course some flies would bebothered about having to go out ofdoors to get to that can. But it doesn'tworry me. In the house where 1 livethere aren't any screens, so I can flyfrom the garbage can to the spittoonin perfect safety. I often stop on theway, though, to get in the sugar bowlor crawl over any eatables that arehandy. lThere's a baby in this house who annoys me very much. Every time Ileave the spittoon and crawl into thatbaby's mouth it cries and spits me out.Of course I leave a few tuberculosisgerms in its mouth, but it doesn't seemlike that would hurt the baby.It seems to me like people don't knowwhat is good to eat At least the people in this house don't Why, theythrow away all the good things. Theyput them in the garbage pail. I amendeavoring to show them what goodthings are, however, for I get my feetall sticky in the garbage can and thengo and wipe them on the bread. Abouta hundred of my companions are doing the same thing. 1 really believethat the people are beginning to like it,for they never trouble us any more.We wipe our feet on the bread inpeace and quietI heard the woman across tle waysay that she believed flies had something to do with the man in this househaving consumption. I wonder if hegot it from the bread.The woman across the way is losingall her flies. They're all coming overto our house. She won't give themanything to eat She covers up hergarbage pall, has tight screens on allher doors aud is a terror to flies in general. EEer children are such happy,hearty youngsters, while the childrenin this house are always cross. Theynever get any afternoon nap. The flieswon't let them.There's a very great deal of illness inthis house. Two of the boys havemalarin aud the father is never well.I !u:ud the mother say to the womanacross the way: "I really do not knowwhat to do for all this sickness. Itdrives me distracted." What do youthink that woman said? Why, "Swatthe fly," of course, at which I ducked.Oh. vps!

This is not only true ofthe small town and the back country,but it is also true of our big cities, forhome garden clubs are growing in popularity and in numbers each season.This spring the city of Louisvilleorganized a home garden club thatgardening among men, women andchildren, and especially the children,might be pushed.

A man who had practical experience was t engaged to take chargeof the work and is now busy movingfrom place to place suggesting plansand methods by which the childrencan help furnish their own tables with jvegetables fresh from their own gardens. The photo which accompanies thisarticle was taken on the outskirts ofLouisville, where a group of four Campfire Girls have a model four plot garden. This work will have a vital effectupon the men and women of tomorrowby giving them an understanding anda giowth which can only come throughclose contact with the soil and growing things. Education is graduallyshifting to a rational use of books anda fuller use of the life which the childleads in the garden, in the home, andunder blue skies. It means an education that makes red blood throb inyoung veins; it means an education !that does things in the everydayworld; it means an education that isclose to the primitive; it means aneducation that fits the child for life."BACK TO THE SOIL"Movement Can Be Aided by ModernIdeals and Methods.The effort to better rural conditionsis touching a fundamental problem ofAmerican life. The "back to the soil"agitation can have little permanenteftect until weSygo back to the tiller ofthe soil with the inspiration and enlightenment of modern ideals andmethods. We must carry the messageinto every fertile valley and to everymountain side; we must get back fromthe traveled roads and the steam andelectric lines; we must reach the littleisolated schoolhouses, the countrychurches and every other agency thatcan be a source of help. We can givethe schoolteacher and the itinerantpreacher a broader viewpoint anddeeper interest in the welfare of theircharges an interest deeper becausemore practical and more hopeful.Xor must we rest with this. A striking feature of the new movement isthe determined effort to show the business man in the city that he has apoint of intimate contact with thefarmer that in mutual help is to befound advantage for both.We like this work because it is basedon sound social lines.
