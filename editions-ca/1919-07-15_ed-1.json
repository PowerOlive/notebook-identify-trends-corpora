JOHNSON.
Following an illness from a com
plication of diseases, extending over
a periodof several months, Mr. Wm.
Henry Harrison Johnson, aged seventy-nine,
one of the best-known and
most respected of the older genera
tion of Paris citizens, paid the great
debt to nature at his home on Mt.
Airy Avenue, in this city, at 7:10
o'clock Sunday night. Mr. Johnson
had been ill for several months, and
all that medical science could do
could not prolong his life further.
About two years ago he fell on the
icy pavement, sustaining injuries
from which he never fully recovered,
and which kept him virtually a pros
oner in his home.
Mr. Johnson was a native of this
county, having been born near Mil
lersburg. His parents were
the late James Harrison and Susan
Martin Johnson, both prominent res
idents of the Millersburg vicinity.
He received his early education in
the schools of his time, and in after
years engaged in business in Mil
lersburg. Mr. Johnson's wife, Mrs. Elizabeth
Johnson, died in 1903. For several
years Mr. Johnson conducted the
Johnson House in Millersburg, one of
the most noted hostelries of the day,
and one which is remembered to this
day by the older residents for the ex
cellence of its cuisine. Mr. Johnson
was a man of many intellectual at
tainments and had a wonderful mem
ory. During the period of his un
willing confinement at his home he
enjoyed nothing so much as having
his friends call and go over the old
times with him, his mind proving a
veritable storehouse of facts, inci
dents and happenings in connection
with local, county and State history
that was truly remarkable.
After Mr. Johnson and family movc
ed to Paris he entered the grocery
business, which he continued up to
the time he was compelled to retire
from active business.
He was a member of Halleck Lodge
I. O. O. F., of Millersburg, and was
always deeply interested in the work
of that order. He was one of the
leading members of the Baptist
church.
Mr. Johnson is survived by four
daughters, Miss Susie Johnson and
Mrs. Lydia Conway, both of 'this city;
Mrs. John Clark, of Lexington;
Mrs. Vvirgil Chandler, of Columbus,
Ohio, one son, Mr. Harold Johnson,
of Columbps, Ohio, and two sisters,
Mrs. M. R. Collier, of Paris, and
Mrs. B. F. Morford, of East St. Louis,
Illinois, and several grandchildren.
The funeral will be held from the
family home on Mt. Airy Avenue, at
four o'clock this (Tuesday) after
noon, with services conducted by
Rev. R. C. Goldsmith, pastor of the
Paris Baptist church. The burial
will follow in the Millersburg Ceme
tery. The pall-bearers will be: Ac
tive Thos. H. Pickerell, G. W. Judy,
T. D. Judy, Robert Collier, W. H. H.
Conway, G. D. Judy; Honorary
Will G. McClintock, W. C. Dodson,

GUARD ENCAMPMENT POSTPON
ED UNTIL WEEK OF AUG. 23
The encampment of the Kentucky
State Guard has been postponed un
til August 23. It will last one week.
The government had agreed that
the State Guards might use Camp
Zachary Taylor during July.
However, it will be impossible for
the encampment to be held this
month, according to a telegram from
Adjutant General Tandy Ellis, to Dr.
H. B. Tileston, Captain of the Louis
ville company. The reason given
was that members will be unable to
attend from Lexington and Paducah
because of it being harvest time.
An effort will be made to obtain
permission of the government to use
the camp next month.
There are four companies of the
State Gaurd, of seventy-five men
each. The men. enlisted for home
duty during the emergency and their
term of enlistmenlTexpires one month
after ratification of peace. The plan
of the organizers is to make hese
companies the micelus for reorgani
zation of the old First Kentucky Reg
SHALL WE HALT OR ADVANCE?
One year ago, when the fate of
the world was hanging in the bal
ance, the American soldier in the
front line trenches in France was
given the word to start for Berlin.
To the glory of American arms,
when the doughboy was ordered to
go ten miles he did not halt and say,
"No, I won't go ten miles. I'll just
go eight miles." He went the full
ten miles and many more and de
mocracy was saved.
Last fall the American people
pledged the largest sum ever sub
scribed in the history of man for a
similar purpose; to minister to the
physical, mental and spiritual needs
of men in the service everywhere.
The campaign was carried on by sev
en great agencies, the Y. M. C. A.,
the Y. W. C. A., the National
Catholic War Council (Knights of
Columbus), the Jewish Welfare
Board, the War Camp Community
Service, the American Library Asso
ciation a-nd the Salvation Army.
To date the payments on these sub
scriptions have covered about eight
miles on a ten mile advance. The
army and navy are far from being
demobilized. Every penny subscrib
ed in. that campaig n is needed. Ken
tucky is a little better than the rest
of the States in" average collections,
but stands eighth, in the 13 Sta'tes
in the Central Army Department.
Three States, North Dakota, Kansas
Iowa, are over the the top. Then
comes Ohio, Illinois, Nebraska, Colo
rado and Kentucky. Indiana is
third from the last.
KING EDWARD'S WARNING AF
TER VISIT TO GERMANY.
Dinner was over; the servants had
left. The thin smoke of cigars and
cigarettes rose up to the gilt ceiling
of the large, dignified room when
the laughter and conversation of the
men whose faces and figures formed
the subject of caricatures in the
English papers suddenly died away.
The host, a bearded man with a high
forehead and heavy, bovine eyes,
leaned forward. In his rather fine
white hand he held a thick amber
cigar holder, which he used as a sort
of baton to enforce his words.
"Gentlemen," he said in the pe
culiar guttural voice which was
known and loved in many strange
parts, "look out! I have asked you
here on my return from Germany to
say to J'ou, look out! O colossus is
stretching himself. Every great
muscle' of his arms is taut and hard.
Every little cell of his great brain
reverberates with two words only,
'Der Tag.'
"We live in a false security here.
We are a democracy which tolerates
a monarch. You, gentlement, are
our autocrats. Each one of you is the
king of England. What are your
majesties going to do? Are you go
ing to continue to play Canute and
hold up your hands to the waves and
say, 'Back?' Are you going to con
tinue to sit within the apparently im
pregnable walls of your party sys
tem? Because, if so, the security of
(this kingdom and your little crowns
IS not HUuKmauit:. lucic euo hj uia-
ders. I say to you again, look out!"
That man was King Edward Vn,
of Great Britain and Ireland. Cosmo
Hamilton, in the Century.
TREASURY DEPARTMENT AN
NOUNCES NEW W. S. SAV
INGS PLAN.
State Director James B. Brown,
Savings Division, War Loan Organi
zation, of Kentucky, has received
the following telegram from the
Treasury Department at Washing
ton: "Savings Division, Treasury De
partment, has announced that sav
ings certificates in denominations of
$100 and $1,000 would be issued for
purchase and investment at once.
War Savings Stamps of denomina
tions of five dollars are convertible
into these securities, which bear the
same rate of interest as Savings
Stamps, four per cent, compounded
quarterly.
"Widespread and continued saving
and investment in five dollar stamps
throughout the country has caused
insistent demands for Government
security, which would combine safety
and profit of savings stamps with
convenience in handling registration.
New securities have been issued in
response to that demand and to pro
vide medium for investment of funds
of fraternal societies, labor unions
civic, social and religious organiza
tions, which signified their desire to
invest their funds in these Govern
ment Savings Securities.
"One hundred dollac certificates
are convertible into $1,000 certifi
cates. Limit of investment , of $1,
000 for each individual, which is
feature of Savings Stamp issue has
been retained."
