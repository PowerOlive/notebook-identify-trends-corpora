He Could See Through Them
Carl Hertz the well known conjure i

house by performing some of his clever-
est tricks One of the parlor maids
who had been passing cups cakes
glasses and so on was much interested
and when the hostess gave a sign that
nothing more was needed the girl stilJ
lingered to see the completion of the
trick just begun
Will some one oblige me with a
heavy shawl or cloak Hertz said
Now he went on selecting a big
cashmere shawl you observe the thick- I
ness of the shawl They all did in-

Hertz and the paper as he looked down
toward it There was breathless silence j
Then he said Surely the number is

right through the thiek shawl Every
one was amazed
Then upon the silence broke the
shriek of the maid at the door With
out final gaze at the shawl and one at
the handsome conjurer she hid her rosy
face in her hands yelling at the top of
her voice Whats the good of me

A Man of System
A newspaper man of some celebrity
as a disciplinarian was noted about his
office for the extreme disorder of his
own desk Though insisting upon
methodical habits on the part of his
employees be gave his own pigeonholes
a cleaning out and sorting over only
once a year and his regular time for
doing this oddly enough was Wash
ingtons birthday
It happened one year nevertheless
that he forgot to perform this task at
the proper time and a friend who hap
pened in at his office on the morning of
didoes not go the length ot forcing a i Feb 23 was surprised at finding hira
-woman to tell her age or of punishing surrounded by his usual hopeless litter
-to an end and after the noble lady had up today arent you
retired to the country for her somewhat No sir was the reply That job
prolonged rest from urban gayeties and goes over under the rules for another
temptations a too careful official year You dont suppose I am going to
that pmprj the papers in the case set an example of irregularity to the
the princess certificate of baptism boys do you Not much
uid that she had changed the date of it And he cleared away a space on hia
nn 1847 to 1867 Instantly this grave desk and began writing an editorial on
fiSrLne was brought to the notice of the the tariff Youths Companion
sxa2thorities and the convicted embezzler
tktis summoned to meet the charge of
Calcifying an official document Then a
rurious fact was disclosed and a
amount of light was thrown on
JRuissuui society
The Prince Eugalytcheff who was
sited as a witness by the prosecutor
said that whether his bride was 20 years
oitier or younger than her certified age
-was a matter of absolute indifference to
bini All he could say was that he re-
oeved the sum of 3000 rubles for giv
ing the lady his name that immediate
ly after the marriage ceremony he pro
ired for her a separate passport and
of letters and papers
How does this happen Mr
he asked
Forgot it shortly answered the
editor
Well youre going to clean things
The Awkward Orderly
A young wag of an officer making a
I morning call upon his superior in the
iatci ti tent found him sound asleep
l
H riiaps a little the worse for a nights
tarrying over the flowing bowl
The officer was tall and the cot was
short so that his feet stuck out at the
foot of the bed
Iustead of waking him the visitor
took the spurs from a pair of boots
standing by the bedside strapped them
to the sleepers ankles and went away
The officer had pretty well lacerated
himself about the shins and ankles be-
since then he has known nothing fQre e woke np aiuj instantly yelled to
Bwro of his wife or her private affairs I 1S orderly
jury gallantly declined to convict
accused princess on the trivial
cfecaxge about a womans age and she
TBratci sent back to her provincial exile
irinces evidently come cheap in
JSassia and this is perhaps the most in
tipr tingbit of news in the whole story

A Disastrous Ending
Two Detroit merchants were sitting

ted his wife in his business affairs
Cant do it was the response
Ive tried it a dozen times a month for

mt as it did yesterday I asked her
i she thought she could discuss a little
laatter of business calmly and dispas
sionately She said she could but had
caver known me to be able to do so I
yMOTplimented her sarcastically on her
sLuelic temper and she at once ac

ht I was regarded among men as hav
ing a very equable disposition and that
joov employees called me Old Suavity
r called attention to the fact that
What do you mean by this he
screamed to the latter pointing to his
feet which were scarred and bleeding
The orderly looked at the spurs in
consternation
Ill forgive you this time for you
did it in the dark said the officer
but the nest time you yank my boots
and socks off so quick that it leaves my
spurs on IM give you ten days in the

Edmoad de Goncourt
Edmond de Goncourt was the chief
spokesman of His school He was the
first to set the fashion or at least the
first to proclaim it of going about note
book in hand for professional purposes
and on nothing did he pride himself so
much as on the paternity of the hu
man document For any useful nay
blessed formula let him receive all
credit so long as the invention is un
derstood to be of a phase not of a thing
The limitation is necessary in view of
certain extravagant pretensions which
would assign to the founders of realis
tic fiction an honor and glory similar to
that which in physical science belongs
to the author of the Novum Orga
num In both cases we are told there
was a change of method in both the
importance of particulars was empha
sized Unfortunately the comparison
can hardly be extended to the subject
matter and the results Nature was un
known when Bacon prescribed rules for
the discovery of her secrets Human
nature the motives and conduct of
men was as well known 2000 years
ago as it is today
No documentary novelist has added
to the sum of general knowledge or
done more than dress up old truths in
a few new garments borrowed from va
rious sciences The innovation of real
ism or naturalism was at most then
one of method applied to a given body
of already known phenomena just as
the same facts may be treated by induc
tion or deduction in turns And even
as an innovation of method it has been
much exaggerated on the fatuous pre
sumption often made by De Goncourt
and others that no novelist before Bal
zac had ever studied the details of life
a presumption resting apparently on
no other basis than the fact that our
old friends taking such study for grant
ed did not deem it necessary to be con
stantly talking about it Macmillans

Too Smart
General Hancock was sorely tried in
1861 by the extreme freshness of some
of the officers of his command One day
the major of a western regiment rode
up to Hancocks headquarters and with
out dismounting asked that General
Hancock step out of his tent as he de
sired to speak with him When the
superb came forth the pompous ma
jor said to the general that he had come
over for the purpose of getting orders as
to what hij regiment thouid do that aft
ernoon and without waiting for Han
cock to give directions he went on to
state that in his opinion as the com
mander of the regiment in the absence
of the colonel and lieutenant colonel
his regiment should devote most of the
afternoon to battalion drill Hancock
quietly gave directions that his regi
ment remain in camp and fix up its
quarters as nicely as possible When
the major rode away Hancock squared
himself folded his hands and looked
after him Without addressing any par
ticular person he said The major is

It Brings Ravishing Dreams of Bliss
In southern Arizona the jail and
prison officials have their hands full in
trying to prevent the smuggling into
their institutions of the seductive ma
riguana This i3 a kind of loco weed
more powerful than opium It is a dan
gerous thing for the uninitiated to han
dle but those who know its uses say it
produces more ravishing dreams than
opium The Mexicans mix it with to
bacco and smoke it with cigarettes in
haling the smoke When used in this
way it produces a hilarious spirit in
the smoker that cannot be equaled by
any other form of dissipation When
smuggled inside the prison walls the
Mexicans readily pay 4 an ounce for
it but free men buy it on the outside
for 50 cents San Francisco CalL
