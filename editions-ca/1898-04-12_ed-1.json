EDWARD HARDY tfae jolly man
ager of Sheppard Cos great store at
Braceville 111 writes Iliad never
Seen sick a day in my life until in 1890 I
gotso bad with nervous prostration that I
liad to give up and commence to doctor I
tried our local physicians and ono in Joliet
but none gave me any relief and I thought
I was going to die I became despondent
and suffered untold agony I could not eat
sleep nor rest and it seemed as if I could
xiot exist At the end of six months I was
reduced to but a shadow of myself and at
last my heart became affected and I was
truly miserable I took six or eight bottles
of Dr Miles Nervine It gave me relief
from the start and at last a cure the great
est blessing of my life

HOW TO FIXD OUT
Fill a bottle or common glass with urine
and let it stand twenty four hours a sedi
ment or settling indicates an unhealthy con
dition of the kidneys When urine stains
linen it is evidence of kidney trouble Too
frequent desire to urinate or pain in the
back is also convincing proof lhat the kid
neys and bladder are out of order

There is comfort in the knowledge so often
