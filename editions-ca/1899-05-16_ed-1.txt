castlemaking- stern shov of warlike forceon the way and there Morgan himselfwould remain keeping with him 50men and the rest were to scatter andplunder and ravage at will Certainrules however were to be observedoue being that all must deposit theirspoil in the hall of the castle whereit should remain till the final decisionanother was that prisoners that isslaves were to remain the propertyof those who seized them If nevertheless it was added any desired tobring their slaves to the castle havinga mind to sell them there they coulddo so and such slaves should be guarded and eared for till their disposalThe sun was creeping up and thebreeze had fallen when at last wecaught step and set forward down thechief street of the city The drumswere beating spiritedly and the trumpets sounded thrilling blasts and withour soldierly array the headpiecescuirasses arid musket barrels flashingin the sun I thought we presented afine and altogether awing spectacleThe place was deathly quiet Everyhouse was closed and as far as wecould see down the street not a personwas in sight Still we traveled alongand at last just as X was wondering atthe extent of this part of the city thestreet ended and we broke out into aconsiderable square or plaza Ilerethe buildings were large and of a morepretention sort than any we had yetn All were of stone some of abrown or reddish color and some ofjomraon stone well set in red cementout few were above three stories inheight The roofs of all were flat andmost had low parapets on which stoodoots of bright flowers or handsomeshrubs and the walls of some werenearly covered with climbing greenery Like the street we had left theplaza was completely deserted theshutters of every building around being ripTHE BOURBON XEWS PARIS KY TUESDAY MAY 10 18Hoots said Mac Ivrach in a lowtone but they hae secreted ilka dogand cat as well as theirsels I wad bewishing for bit stir o some sort Sicstillcess no seems cannyThis I conceive pretty well expressedthe feelings of us all who felt a kindof oppression in the continued silenceMorgan had halted a moment butpresently had us forward again andwithout any interruption or change inthe appearance of things we continuedon till we reached the castle This wasa considerable stone structure standing on the top of a little plateau andwas defended by high walls and onestrong towerIt looked as though this were an excellent place for a mine or other device but I was speedily told that thisfear was unfounded for the place hadbeen entered and the chief rooms explored but nothing in the nature of atrap had been found The keys hadbeen given to Mcrgan and the gunsspikedWe were but a moment in enteringand while one of the captains at Morgans command went up to haul downthe Spanish flag and put our own in itsplace the different companies wereformed up in their order and the lastwords of advice and command givenAmong other things all were biddento be sparing of the wine till it wasproven that it was not poisoned to return to the castle at nightfall and tohasten thither at once if two successive cannon shots were fired Thesewere to mean some sudden or imminent dangerAll this being attended To the companies save the picked detail to remain with Morgan broke ranks andshortly quitted the castleThere to be removed from the horrors we must see here I answeredI am favorable to itAnd I said Mac IvrachTut the words were scarce out of hismouth when a man came running outof the opening of the neighbor streetand on seeing as pulled up shortSattnts and angels defend us criedMac Ivrach fairly staggering backThe gaist o the captainFor indeed the man appeared to beno other than Capt SellingerCHAPTER XVOP THE CONCLUSION OF OUR CxREATSURPRISE AND WHAT FOLLOWEDAT THE HEELS OF ITEven Mr Tym changed color andfor my part my legs grew weak and myheart thumped like a fulling hammerWhy friends dont ye know meDo ye take me for a ghostIt was the same old heartv searough voice that we knew so well Itwas no spirit but the mans mortalselfMr Tym was the first to pull himselftogether Tie rushed forward andwith a little cry of gladness seizedSellinger by both hands and dancedthe strong skipper about I was nextand could scarce keep back the tearsas I gripped the big brown handsEven Mac Ivrach grinned like a merryandrew and cut one step of a caper ashe took his turnBut man cried Mr Tym as we atInst released the skipper and stood delightedly about him how can this beDid we not see you hanged Ayedangling your length from the yardarm of the Pilanca Why we madeout the very white shirt you have onsurely the only one among the crewThe captain first gave a stare of astonishment and incredulity and thenbroke into a low whistleAye aye I see how it was It wasthe boatswain Pedillo Marry 1 neverthought of your taking him for meYou see the old governor conceivedthe notion that the fellow was moreresponsible than anybody else for ourlittle break and so danced him up tothe yard I believe one of the priestsgave him a shirt or frock to be turnedotT in and so that was where you gotyour white tog Aye aye I understand the thing nowAnd so of course did we and it wassimple enough to be sureHe asked a question or two in turnwhich we answered and then I went onto inquire how the Spaniards used himafter our escapeWhy not so bad he answeredMy wound was attended to and then1 was clapped in the brig When theship reached Chagre I was set upon themidships of a mule and brought hereSince then 1 have lived in the house ofFaith but that reminds me I haverun at my best speed hither not aloneto sail in your company but becauseof another matter of urgency Wilyou come along with me and make nostay for questionsSurelv cried Mr Tym withouthesitationAnd Mac Ivrach and I said the sameThen this wayHe turned and set off up the samestreet he had emerged from I had ofcourse noticed his dress and other appearance ere this and found that helooked and was habited as formerlyHe was armed now however beinggirded with a belt to which was hunga short hook pistol and a SpanishhangerWe fetched up at a high stone wallwhich I perceived must set off a considerable estate A little way alongthis wall was a strong iron gate thetop defended by sharp spikes The captain plucked a key out of his pocketwith which he unlocked this gate andurging us all in before him hastilylocked it again I now perceived thatwe were in an extensive garden fruitand shade trees standing thickly aboutand the walks bordered with flowersA little way in the rear I could partlymake out a handsome low stone houseThe captain hurried us up the mainwalk making no concealment now ofspeed and at a fair run we brought upbefore the door of the house I perceived then that the place was strongas well as handsome the building being of some yellowish stone set offwith a cage fashion of balconies in theSpanish style The chief entrance wasdirectly before us a step leading up toit and I noticed that the door was avery strong affair and in height andbigness was sufficient for a littlechurch The captain knocked sharplytwice when the door was slowlyopened and an old negro put out hisheadAlls well Tonto These are thefriends I went to seekThe old fellow looked at us a littlesuspiciously I thought but withoutobjection stood asideThese quarters said the captainturning to us belong to Don Enriquede Cavodilla You recall him I thinkWe readily did so for he was one ofthe grandees of the PilancaWell went on the captain he isor has been my master and havingused me very well I am somewhat beholden to him Yet even more I woulddo a good turn to his wife Dona Isabella and to his niece Senorita Carmen You see now the reason of myhurrySurely said Mr Tym and we willgladly help you Mac Ivrach and Ialso heartily assentedI am free to say I know not howthe thing is to be managed said thecaptain sinking his tones a little butthat we will immediately consider Wemust first consult the donAs he spoke a door shut and a mancame out at the head of the stairsEven in the dim light I recognized himat once as the old Spaniardlie was a tall spare erect man withplenty of gray in his beard and hairbut in bearing still in his strength andprime He was dressed in the sadcolored velvet of the ship with theruffles and other fineryGo on Ardick and tell him howmatters stand said Sellinger I amstill without a hold on the rascallySpanishSir I said accordingly stepping tothe foot of the stairs Capt Sellingeris here and has brought with him thefriends he went out to seekGod be praised cried the oldhidalgo with the deepest heartinessSancta Maria scnor I never heardsweeter words Ascend ascend youand your friendsI briefly translated the dons speechand with the captain in the lead wemounted the stairsThe old man met us at the top andsomewhat to my discomposure kissedeach of us in turnYou will save us he cried Youwill deliver my wife and the poor childYou will deliver my wife and the poor childMy life is of little worth but theyAh come with me senores and assurethese poor creatures that you willsuccor themLead on scnor I said not a littletouched Re assured we will do whatAve canlie lost no more time but led ushastily to a rear chamber where hethrew open the door Two ladies werewithin who quickly roseThe shutters of th windows wereopen for the room looked out on aninclosed court and the bright sunlight cheeked merely by the draperiesbrought out everything clearlyI immediately recognized Dona Isabella She was small and slight witha proud handsome face but a fadedskin and was richly dressed with manybright ribbons and ornaments DonaCarmen was as I instantly perceivedpassing beautiful Something tall andyet of such proportions that she scarceseemed so she all but startled me withthe nnusual combination of yellow hairgreat Spanish black eyes I mean thosewith the wonderful long lashes a skinSaxon fair nose mouth and chin delicate and in exact harmony and an expression vivacious and to appearance intelligentDon Enrique now flourished us forwardIsabella and you poor Carmen hereare the brave English friends of CaptGiles he said Take heart and thankthe Virgin for they have come to deliver usEach lady in turn dropped a statelySpanish courtesy and with more resolution than I had looked for thoughto be sure unsteadily thanked usWell what is to be done said IThe -captain looked at Mr Tym andthe latter after a moments hesitationsaidLet us first understand our bearingscaptain What are the private waysout of this placeBy the gardens answered Sellingerand rearward through a court to anarrow street Thence it is a straightcourse to the waterThese gardens border upon whatConsiderable streetsAnd the ships and boats have allbeen taken and our fellows will havean eye upon the water front saidMr Tym shaking his head That willnot doWe were silent for a bit I rackingmy brains to hit upon something whenhe suddenly resumed I have athought What is to prevent us fromclaiming these people as our slavesThat will be but one each which mustbe safe enoughI thought fie had hit it ami began tosay that nothing could be betterBut the captain shook his head Ifear it will not serve he saidYou must know that Don Enrique andthe ladies were yesterday chased andwell nigh captured a party of buccaneers and I cannot doubt that thesame fellows would know them againDoubtless they would claim them under the usual freebooters ruleWhy yes admitted Mr Tym reluctantly since such are the factsMy hopes were suddenly dashed andI sighed with disappointmentBut why suld these callants seethem put in Mac Ivrach Can we nohide them awaWith difficulty said Mr Tym Itmight be managed here but when itcame to the march all must come outMoreover I doubt whether any placeor house would be suffered to remainbarred against searching parties Itwould be thought some trick was going on such as plunder hidden awayThen said the captain I see butone course to steer They must flyThe question is whitherTO BE CONTINUEDA COUNTS VISIONRemarkable Instnnee of TelegraphicPerception Foretelling aTragedyI can vouch for the truth of the following interesting case of clairvoyance On August 12 a young mannamed Livio Cibrario belonging to cneof the most ancient families of Turinwhile attempting to climb the peak ofUocciamelone in the Maritime AJpslost his way and on the followingmorning a search party found his boterribly crushed and braised at thebottom of a deep crevasseCount Cibrario the unfortunateyoung mans father who was at Turinand knew nothing of his sonfl expedition to the Uocciamelone on the nightof the accident aroused the rest of thefamily announcing with tears thatLivio wm dead He had seen him distinctly he said blood flowing from hisbattered head and had heard thesewords spoken in a voice of terrible anguishFather I slipped down a precipiceand broke my head and I am deadquite deadThe other members of the famihtried in vain to persuade the poorcount that the ghastly vision wasnothing but a nightmare and the bereaved father continued in a state ofanxiety bordering upon distraction tillthe morning when the official confirmation of the terrible accidentreached himThis case of telepathy or whatevername may be given to similar phenomena is considered all the more remarkable as Count Cibrario is a veryquiet matter-of-fact person and hasnever
