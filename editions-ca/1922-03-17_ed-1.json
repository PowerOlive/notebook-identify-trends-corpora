NEWSPAPER "UES" ARE
PUBLIC'S LIES
THE
The country newspaper editor and
publisher certainly have to stand
for a lot in this world.
In what other business on earth
would somebody dare to offer the
business man $100 for $1,500 of his
reported in the news columns of
"The American Press?"
What high brow or pedant would
dare to appear before a meeting of
big daily newspaper editors and ad
vise them to make accuracy a part
of their, code of ethics? As if their
practice was to fill their papers with
lies!
The newspapers are as accurate
to-day as the great mass of high
minded American editors, city and
country, can possibly make them.
Newspapers of the twentieth century
are far more accurate than they were
under your first Bennett, under Hor
ace Greely, or even under Dana, and
fifty years hence they will have pro
gressed to far greater accuracy than
to-day.
Newspapers will be perfect in this
respect when the time arrives tht
editors and reporters will not have
to go to the public to get the news.
The facts in news items are dug out
of people who are supposed to know
them. When they appear in the paper
and are found to be untrue or mis
leading, it is practically always the
fault of the person or persons to
whom the reporter or editor went for
his facts. This is partcularly the
case when you find inaccuracies in
country newspapers.
And it isn't to be wondered at
when it is remembered that, if you
are a judge, you cannot get the same
story of an event twice from a half
dozen eye-witnesses all under oath,
when not one person out of a dozen
will correctly repeat a remark made
in the presence of all of them.
Talk accuracy to an editor and
you insult him! Because that is al
ready the high aim of the vast ma
ority of them. j

The last large shipment of remains
of soldier dead, returned for burial
under the Stars and Stripes, will be
completed when the Armory Trans
port Cambria reaches New York
March 30, with 1,224 flag-draped
caskets. With the arrival of the
Cambria the reverent task of the
Quartermaster Corps of the Armory
of bringing home the bodies of those
who fell in France, will be prac
tically finished. Plans are already
under way for appropriate services
and ceremonies at the dock, to pay
final tribute to those who made the
supreme sacrifice. After the Cam
bria lands her precious freight, -approximately
only 325 bodies will re
main abroad to be brought to the
United States for burial. Up to
March 1, the Graves Registration
Service of the Quartermaster Corp3
had returned to this country the re
mains of 44,418 of those Americans
who died on foreign soil.
