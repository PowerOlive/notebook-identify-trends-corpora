"Black Roses"
Crime is a business, with the general human average of success
and failure. The winner to-day is the loser to-morrow. No
body finishes winner at the crime game. He is always sur
rounded by enemies none more bitfcer than those who
have been victimized. And so it proves in "Black Roses," a
thoroughly American melodrama.
Unscrupulous criminals "framed" the man who possessed the
secret for growing Black Roses. He escaped from jail (one of
the most thrilling escapes ever picturized) and became a con
federate of those who had been responsible for his plight.
There was an object in view. How he got the desired results
makes "Black Roses" without parallel; Hayakawa's support in
"Black Roses" includes Tsuru Aoki, Myrtle Steadilian, Henry
Herbert and Andrew Robson. The production is magnificent
from every angle.
