mont," near Lexington.
Publishers of county papers have
had to contend $mong other things,
with the people wno want to have
long obituaries of their deceased,
friends and relatives published free
of cost. The papers of Central Ken
tucky long ago adopted a charge for
this class of contributions. THE
NEWS reprints' from the Cynthiana
Democrat what is about the qlearest
presentation on the subject, and asks
all intending" contributors to be gov
erned accordingly:
"It seem to be necessary to state
again that The Democrat, as well as
all other well regulated newspapers,
charge for publishing obituaries.
Persons continue to send them in
with request for publication and
seejm offended when they do not ap
pear. It should be remembered that
the charge is five cents a line, which
is one cent a word. Therefore,
please count the. words and send
check' or ."cash with the request to
publish, otherwise we shall be oblig
ed to omit the obituaries. The Dem
ocrat "prints notices of deaths as
promptly as possible after the infor
mation reaches us and' usually full
details are given. . We, of course,
niake no charge for this because it
is a matter of news. Sympathy with
bereaved ones is always felt by pub
lishers, but it is not possible to pub
lish obituaries and do justice to read
ers who are not directly interested."
GASSED TWO DAYS AFTER SIGN
IN 0E ARMISTICE
It was a hard war for the Three
Hundred and Fifteenth Infantry and
Jack Devereaux, a Broadway actor
and a lieutenant in Company L. He
went through at least a dozen bat
tles without a scratch and the day
theP armistice was? signed he slapped
himself on the "back, congratulating
himself as lucky.
Deveraux came home on the trans
port Abangarez with 106 other pass
engers,, most of them soldier heroes,
but instead of slamiincr himself on
the back he was kicking himself all
over. Two days after the war ended
he was gassed.
The soldiers in this regiment were
still cheering the defeat of the Ger
mans, and Deveraux was walking
through the ruins ofBars, near Ver
dun, when he accidently tripped orer
a gas trap left by the enemy. The
soldier-actor was overcome and for
several weeks after was under treatment.
