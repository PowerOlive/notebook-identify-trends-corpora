to undertake to getmore western blood in the navy andto this end Lieut Com J M Hawleywith a sufgeon and a boatswain willstart from Washington next week ona tour of the larger western citieswith a view to securing recruits Thefirst stop will be made at Duluth andthen Chicago Milwaukee Toledo Buffalo and other lake cities will be visied The plan is to open temporary recruiting offices in these placesand secure for the navyas many of the lake sailorsas possible The project is to be credited to Lieut Com Hawley Whenthe department came to realize thefact that not a single vessel in thenaval service had a full complement ofordinary seamen and sailors and thatmen of the high standard desired bythe navy could not be procured in sufficient numbers in the coast cities hisplan was adopted and he was placedin charge of its execution Mostof the sailors who man ourwarships are from the coastcities although recently somewesterners have been driftinginto the service and it was felt that ifthis movement could be stimulated thenavy would be benefitted by securinga larger proportion of native Americanstock in its enlistments Letters received at the navy department showedthat one obstacle to the entry of westerners into the service was the factthat the men who were willing andanxious to enter had not the meansto reach the seaboard cities where enlistments are made It was for thisreason that Lieut Com Hawleywas instructed to establish temporaryoffices for recruiting as he goes wherethe recruits may apply and be sent inbatches of ten or a dozen in charge ofthe boatswain to the nearest navyyard at the governments expenseThe terms offered to the lake sailorsare For ordinary seamen 19 permonth and for sailors 24 with an allowance of SI per month extra to eachupon re enlistment and rations Therecruiting officer also hopes to securesome machinists from the lake portsfor the navy The pay of these menin the navy is to be 70 per monthagainst an average of 345 on the lakesWashington

Name UrofficialArbitrators in the Matter- 4-It May End tho Appalling Strike on Reasonable Basis and Thus Save the Conntry From the Horrors of a Struggle Between Capital and LaborNew York July 12 A speeiaTto theJournal and Advertiser from Washington saysHaving ascertained from the leadingconstitutional lawyers m congressthat there is no ground uponwhichthe federal government can take anypart in an arbitration of the disputebetween the miners and the mirieowners involved in the present giganticstruggle the Journal and Advertiserhas laid the whole matter before President McKinley personally - andasked him to name an official bodyof arbitrators whose character andreputation for fairness and good sensewould be sufficient to guarantee a justand acceptable decisionPresident McKinley has been assuredthat the mine workers have in writing agreed to submit their case tosuch a board of arbitrators andacceptand obey its decreeThe president expressed his willingness to take the lead in the matter demanded under immediate consideration on condition that the mine owners shall also agree to submit theircases to the arbitrators and abide bythe resultOf course it is understood that thisbody can have no official characterand will be unable to enforce its decision but it can perhaps induce themine owners and mine workers to endthe appalling struggle on some reasonable basis and thus save the countryfrom the horrors of a national strugglebetween capital and labor at a timewhen want and misery stalk throughthe countryA board of arbitration can at leastsucceed in placing the responsibilityfor the continuance of this disastrousand perilous strike where it belongsPresident McKinley can not and willnot undertake to select the arbitrators until he has satisfactory assurance that both sides are willing to accept arbitration Even then his action will depend upon the circumstances under which the caseis laidbefore himHe realizes fully the terrible consequences which may follow if the struggle is allowed to go on The Journaland Advertiser is not in a position tomake public all the details of this matter but it has gone far enough to opena way for a peaceful settlement Thepublic at large will presently be ableto see clearly the nature of the greatcoal strike and its environmentsPresident McKinley can not go beyond the point already indicated untilthe mine owners

still out with no immediate prospect of their returnThe event of the morning was thefrantic effort of the little dealers tosecure coal from the big dealers tosupply the retail consumer In

represented nearly everybranch of organized labor in theUnited StatesThe conference was fixed for 10oclock Friday morning at the Monongahela house but owing to the detention of President Batchford whomissed connection and did not reachPittsburgh until after 6 oclock Fridayevening it was nearly 9 oclock beforethe meeting convenedThe session was secret and it wasalmost midnight before it was overThe press committee Messrs GompersBatchford and Connahan then gaveout the following statement in whichwas incorporated they said all thatwas done at the conference The manifesto followsAfter an informal discussion reports were made by Messrs BatchfordDolan and Warner in regard to thesituation of the movement and it wasdemonstrated that the suspension waspractically general in the competitivebituminous coal district extending alsoto Kentucky and Tennessee exceptinga few points in West Virginia It wasrealized that the situation in WestVirginia required attention in orderthat the suspension should become absolutely general and success assuredWith that object in view action wasrecommended by President Gompersof the American Federation of Labor and it was determined upon toovercome this feature of the contest It was also determined thatevery effort be made on the part ofthose present to secure the co-operationand practical aid of organized labor for the struggling miners All thecircumstances warranted the firm conviction that the miners will ultimatelyachieve victory and to this end the aidof labor and the sympathetic public isinvoked Conscious of the great interestwhich the public has in a contest sowidespread as that of the miners givesus great satisfaction to know that theminers have not been and are not nowopposed to arbitration We thereforeurge and advise that a conference beheld by representatives of the minersand operators with the view of arriving at a settlement of the present suspensionNotwithstanding the positive announcement by the committee that thestatement furnished the press coveredall the proceedings of the conferenceit is known that an organized effort tosecure a general suspension of miningin West Virginia was decided uponAfter a thorough canvass of the situation it was unanimously agreed thatthe West Virginia miners held the keyto the situation and without theirunited support the success of the general movement would be greatlyjeopardizedIfjgs known that con certedc actionwill be taken at once to make the suspension of mining in West Virginiacomplete which move if successfulwill kill off the most effective enemythe strikers have to encounter Itwas this field that broke the strikein 94 and no effort will be sparedto bring it into subjection at thistimeTo supplement the conference ofFriday evening a special meeting ofthe State Labor league has been calledfor Sunday night in this city at whichfurther means of support will be devised The operators in the meantimeare viewing the conditions calmly

AkjadkjyuAaJyT JISex4-- THE BEGINNING OF THINGS- -In the days before the new era Allacoochee was a dead alive village with asingle street climbing from the ferrylanding on the river hank up to theweather beaten courthouse on the firstslope of Johns mountain If it differedfrom other inland county seats innorthern Alabama it was on the side-of drowsiness and shabby inconsequence Its reason for existence waspurely geographical the Chiwasscevalley divides Chilmath county intohalves and the ferry was a point accessible to the farmers in the valleyand to the dwellers on Jubal mountain on the east and Johns mountainon the west In the sprinkling ofweather worn buildings strewn uponthe hillside facing the river but threewore relatively notable One was thecourthouse wooden two storied witha classic porch out of which tumbleda cataract of steps flowing down to thead of the street Another was Catrons store low and windowless in therear and self assertive and pretentiousin front with a high forehead oEweather boarding rising above thewooden awning over the sidewalkThe third was the Mountain house justacross the street from Catrons It hadbeen a planters mansion in the days ofmasters and slaves and in falling fromits better estate the square brick househad brought down some reminders ofancient stateliness and solidity Therewas a suggestion of comfort in its deepverandas roomy hallways and widefireplaces but the hint was lost in thegeneral aspect of decay and neglectand the Mountain bouse together witheverything else in the village pointedtoward a gradual and painless relapseinto a condition of moribund disuseIn the nature of things the old Allacoochee saw few visitors It was 20miles down the vallev to Prattvillethe nearest railway town and AbelFrenchs buckboard was the only meansof communication French drove downtwice a week for the mail but he seldom brought back a passenger andsave on First Mondays and othercourt days the Mountain house wasusually without guests One pleasantevening in February however Frenchbroke the record He brought twostrangers up with him from Prattvilleiind there was a consequent stir of spec-m ativecuripsityx am ong Jth e loun gerswhose rallying point wasthe shelterof Catrons awnincr French beinjrpromptly interrogated conf essedreluetantly that he had been unable to findout his passengers business and having run a 20 mile gauntlet with the inquisitive mail carrier the strangershad no trouble in evading the less skillful approaches of the townsfolk Fortwo weeks they spent their days driving up and down the valley and theirevenings sitting upon the veranda ofthe Mountain houseasking questions ofeveryone and contriving to dodge all inquiries aimed at the object of their visitOne evening when the sun had gonedown behind Johns mountain the newcomers took their accustomed placeson the veranda drawing their chairstogether and lighting their after-suppercigars in full view of the open aircourt in session under Catrons awning One of them was a heavy set manwith a smooth shaven face hard butunreadable He had the mannerism ofquiet aggressiveness which belongs tophysical superiority but the bully inhim was a force rather than an expression Certain little idiosyncrasies suchas the habit of slipping his hands intohis pockets and rocking his chair gently on two legs as he talked suggestedthe lawyer cross examining a witness-and the hint pointed truthfully to thegentlemans profession Among hislegal associates in New York LawyerSharpless was respected as an able attorney and one whose loyalty to hisclients was never hampered by inconvenient questions of conscience Hiscompanion was a wiry little man whoseclothes were shabby with the wear ofactivity He talked volubly imnctuatihg his speech with a lean linger laidin the palm of the opposite hand andthrowing one leg over the arm of hischair as he warmed to his subject Hiscalling was not so obvious but thatwas because he had followed so manyoccupations that none of Them had leftits impress upon him A pettifogginglawyer a land agent for a railway com-pany a broker in real estate and latterly a professional boomer Mr JenkinsFench was a man of many parts wellqualified to bear his share in the enterprise in which he was at present as-sociated with the New York lawyerSharpless enjoyed the first inch ofhis cigar in silence before he

betterbuy that outright Does he still wanttwo thousand for itHe did yesterday but I think Ivescraped together a few details thatllhelp him change his mind You knoweverything has a history if you canonly get at the factsOf course What did you find outI got the whole story of the propertyIt seems that the place used to belongto an old fellow by the name of Kilgrow who lived on the mountain andmade moonshine whisky or apple brandy or something in that line that gothim into trouble with the revenue people Cates who was a fence for themoonshiners held the land as a tenantunder Ivilgrow for some years andnever claimed it until after the revenueoflicers had run Kilgrow out of thecountry That was six yeais ago andafter the old mountaineer was well outof fhe way Cates gave it out that theland was his that he bought it sometime before the raid Nobod seems tohave questioned his title though thereis no record of any transfer from KilgrowThen Kilgrow is probably the rightfill nmwr Tirnr- He wouldbeif Hiewere alive but hedied m Texas three years ago and sofar as I can find out there are no heirsin sightOh then it dont make so much difference after all said FenchNo except that it gives us a goodleverage on Cates It leaves a gap in thetitle j but I guess I can doctor that upYes easy enough Well go and seeCates in the morning if youre readyLawyer Sharpless had not overestimated the value of his discoveriesWhen the leverage was applied to lamesCates on the following day the farmerpromptly produced a witness whoclaimed to have been present when thepurchase was madeand who confirmedthe rumor of Kilgrows death by asserting that he had helped bury the oldmountaineer three years before on theTexan frontier Sharpless ignored thewitness and xointed obstinately to thefaulty record insisting that Catesshould produce the original deed Thefarmer declared at first that the document was among his xmpers and thenthat it had been lost Pushed to thewall he Avavered cut his price in halfai disappeared from the valley as soonas the transfer was made to the newownersIf Sharpless doubted the asseverations of Cates and his opportune witness he made no sign nor was he disturbed by the significant fact that thewitness vanished with Cates The attorney had assured himself beforehandupon two points the certitude of Kilgrows title to the land and the absence of heirs who might becometroublesome future claimants Withthese two premises in reserve he believed that the title acquired fromCates could be made as good as validf ter the purchase of the Cates farmSharpless and Fench spread a reportthat they were about to try an experiment in tobacco raising on a laxge scaleand with this ostensible object in viewthey proceeded to secure options uponother tracts in the vajley Since theyoffered good prices for poor land therewas little haggling and in a few daysthe required acreage was under control This was the first move in thecomplicated game of evolution andwhen it was made the promoters celebrated their success with a fresh boxof cigars and a bottle of rather sickishnative wine in their room at the Mountain houseWere in great luck so far saicrSharpless examining the map spreadout on the table between them Xoudbetter write them to go ahead in NewYork with their articles of incorporation - I wonder if Birkmore is ready tobegin on the railroad extensionHe ought to be he was to send Raymond up to let us know when thestrings were ready to pullJThe answer to the question was coming up the stairs while Fench was speaking and presently entered the roOm inthe keeping of a

pausing when he came to thedate Make it about May 2p 1S85The lawyer made a rapid calculationin dates Yes thatll do As nearlyas I can locate it the raid on the moonshiners was made in June or July ofthat year itll be safe enough to call itthe 20th of MayFench went on writing and presentlyhanded the two deeds to SharplessHow wall that doThats about it replied the attorney I wonder if the old moonshinerwould recognize his signatureId risk it What are you going todo about the notarys acknowledgmentIll fix that Ive been making myself solid with an old fellow across thestreet who calls himself a lawyer Hedoesnt know enough about the Jaw tohurt him but he is a notary publicHell do it for a consideration and hewont be too particular about the exactdateIs it safe to trust himI dont mean to make the experiment I shall simply tell him that Cateshas had this deed kicking about the Ihouse all these years without having itrecordedOh thats the scheme is it saidFench screwing up one eye until allthe craftiness in both seemed to peerout of the other Give me that deed aminuteHe went to the fireplace and taking apinch of soot rubbed it into his handsuntil they were black and grimy Thenhe folded and crumpled the deed untilSharpless threw tie forged deed on the tableit had the requisite appearance of ageand ill usageYoure airrartist Fench was theJawj ers admiring comment when thepaper was handed back for inspectionNobody will ever suspect now that itisnt as old as it claims to be Wonderif I could find old Squire Pragmore tonight-Perhaps said the manager washing the grime from his hands Whileyoure hunting him Ill write to NewYorkSharpless came back in a few minutes and threw the forged deed on thetableThats settled he said When itsrecorded well destroy itDid Pragmore object inquiredFench looking up from his letterHe balked a little at first but Ivegiven him a lot of business in the lasttwo weeks and a 20 fee was too muchfor himA week later Lawyer Sharpless calledat Judge Wilkinsons office in the courthouse and asked for the Kilgrow Catesdeed He took the paper that was givenhim and put it into his pocket withoutexamining it further than to glance atthe judge of probates certificate of record Being by this time burdened withmany matters of greater importance hedid not think of it again until eveningwhen he took it out with some otherpapers in the office of the Mountainhouse A cold rain had been fallingduring the day and a wood fire wasblazing in the fireplace Sharplesssingled the deed out of the bunch ofpapers and thrust ifc between the logsignoring the summons to supper untilhe had seen the crisp cinders whirledup the chimney in a winding sheet offlame Then he went to the dining roomand took his seat opposite Fench at thetable

ThursdayThroe MnrfPav v1Washington July 12 Beyond thefact that the general deficiencypriation bill probably will be passedand that the senate will stand readyto take up the tariff bill at any time vthat a report may be brought in bythe conference committee little can -bepredicted of the course of events inthe senate during the present weekThe disposition is to do little in the -wayof general legislation and thereis a proposition under consideration bythe leaders of the two sides of thechamber to adopt the plan now invogue in the house for sitting onlyevery third day after the deficiencybill shall have been disposed ofThis suggestion has been made inview of the possibility o pressure totake up the matter of the appointment of a currency commission Thegeneral impression about the senateis that the house will pass such a billon this subject as the president mayrecommend but that there is no probability that the senate will take thematter up seriously The desire is tomake this intention clear by infrequent meetingsThere are however some matterson the executive calendar demandingattention and there may be an effortto clear this calendar off during theweek If such should prove to be thecase there would be more or less discussion in the executive sessions overthe McCord Warner and Goodnownominations The friends of the Hawaiian annexation treaty on the foreign relations committee also hope tobe authorized to report a ratificationresolution at their meeting next Wednesday but it is by no means certainthat the committee will be able toreach an agreement so soonMonday will be devoted to the general deficiency bill particular attention being given to the provision forthe purchase of armor plate atper ton This portion of the bill willbe seriously antagonized and quitefiercely debated Senator Harris oKansas will endeavor to get up hisresolution regarding the re -organizationof the Union Pacific railroad during the week but in this he will beopposed and is not likely to succeedThe tariff conferees confidently expect to bring in the tariff bill byThursday The length of the debateon the report will depend upon howwell the senate conferees

MASONCopyright 1897ftftf4l2rxiFirtftthe gTeat mutiny broke outWHENthere was no end to the princesand nabobs in India and without exception all were rich The HonoralbleHast India company had forcibly deposed some from power and had boughtoff others but from highest to lowestthey still had their palaces and retinues-and retainers A few of these potentates threw their fortunes with the British but the great majority cast theirHot with the rebels or affected aalmost as dangerous No douibtrmany of them sacrificed all their wealth-to help along the cause Ibut there wereothers who transferred their treasureto safe places and let it remain in concealment until long after peace hadbeen proclaimed Under a militaryedict all hidden property became lootfor the soldiers and scores of themwere enriched by their findingsIt was ten years after the close of thewar that I landed in Delhi and thesearch for hidden treasure had longbeen given up in that district I had ah umber of friends among the Englishofficers in the Tenth native infantryand one night as I sat smoking withMaj Trainor in liis quarters he suddenly turned on ine and saidYou saw me in the bazaar to daytalking with a nativeYesThat man was for a year or so incommand of the 400 soldiers in theretinue of the nabob of Jumna as hetailed himself The place stood over inthe hills and the nabob leaned towardsour side for a few weeks that is untillie got his treasure safely away Thenlie went over to the rebels bag and bagpage Tout he made a mess of it Insideof three months he was killed and hisforce scattered and a dozjan of his followers who found -their way back afterpeace was proclaimed were hung inshort order This man whom we usedto call Col Bounce arrived here onlyto day and do you know I believe hehas an eye on that treasure He insiststhat I am mistaken in his identity andthat he was never in this part of thecountry before but I know I am rightWhat do you propose I asked4That we find the treasure ourselvesYou were going up the country Justsettle down here for three months andIll make a millionaire of you The nabob of Jumna was not as rich as somebut his treasure house held a kingsransom As things are dull now I canget a leave of absence for three monthsCapt Gordon can do the same AVe threewill then form a treasure-huntingsyndicate and if you dont wearsome of the dead nabobs rubies anddiamonds out of India Im no prophetCapt Gordon was called in andthe syndicate duly organized Unlikemost other syndicates little or no capital was needed for it The major wassatisfied that the native had returned-with but one object in view The firstidea was to arrest him and frightenliim into giving up the secret Thiscould probably have been done fiveyears earlier as the British did notstick at trifles when a prisoner was obdurate but the days had gone by when-a confession might be forced It wassfinall decided to leave- him at libertyand watch his every movement andrthis plan wTas set in motion the next-morningsCapt Gordon had a Ceylonese servant-looking after things this fellow wasgiven orders to find fCol Bounce andstick to him Inside of half a day hereported that he had picked up his manand we felt quite certain that within aweelc we should know more about thetreasureWe missed it by not rating thecolonel high enough He didnt lookoverintelligent but we had a fox todeal with He loafed for about a weekspoke freely of his past to thecaptainsservant and finally sought and obtained employment with anative jeweler As soon as he had done this wethree packed off to the hills leaving theservant on watch The nabobs palacehad been blown up and was a mass ofruins but wTe were not at all interestedin that direction The place had beenexplored again and again and withoutluck We had to do some figuring andthen regulate our movements accordingly First we took it for grantedthat the nabob had run off his treasure In so doing ha would have to takeat least half a dozen men into his confidence As commander of his forcesCol Bounce would certainly beone The wealth had not been taken tothe city nor had it been turned overto anyone for safe keeping It hadcertainly been buried somewhere andthe hills offered many advantages overthe open ground It was more thaneven chances that the treasure had beenLwalled up in a cave or cavity of somesort and that within six or eight milesof the palaceAs a beginning to active operationswe drew a map of the locality and divided it off with lines radiating likethe spokes of a wheel the ruins beingthe hub Each man was to take a lineand follow it by compass a distance ofsix miles then cross to another andreturn to the hub As the lines wereonly ten rods apart according to ourscale it would be easy to inspect everyfoot of the ground passed over Therewrere days when the heat was too greatto move and at the end of three weekswe had finished only a quarter of thework It was then decided to changerthe plan and let each man search ashe would but a fourth week passedand we were just where we were at thestartWe would have given up now but fora flying visit from the captains manwho reported that Col Bouncehad quit the place and left the cityHe had purchased a horsq and a quantity of provisions and there was reasonto believe that he would show up in thehills and seek the treasure cave We atonce moved our camp and set a watehfor the man Two days later he showedup and went into camp about a mileaway He had no reason to suspect ourpresence as we were supposed to havegone north for tigers but he was plajring for a big stake and wouldi take nochances Our men had an eye on himday and night for ten days before hemoved To some root hunters he ex-plained that he was campingout for hishealth and he did little but sleep

for a stick andit had been brought along to work amasonryIt was the major who found the caveand it was his broken leg that lost usthe treasure As we walked down theravine carefully scanning the rockywalls he slipped on a wet stone andpitehed forward against a bush Thebush was uprooted and he swayed andfell and his first cry was that the cavewas behind it So it was A stonewhich must have required the servicesof six or eight men to lift had beencemented into the mouth of a cave ofsome sort and but for the bush theseams would have been plain to anyeye on the lookout So anxious wasthe

objectsexist in the world which they will notattempt to move intact for a consideration In the directory these men arecalled house movers but they are entitled to a designation of far greaterdignity for some of their achievementsarenumbered amongthe great engineering feats of the world Within the pastfew months the house movers have experienced an unwonted activity Somereally creditable and in some cases stupendous feats have been performedThe moving of Lovering hall at JohnsHopkins university was one of thesefeats the moving of an upper Ifew Yorkhouse 1 blocks along the public highway was another and the very recentmoving and resetting of a tall smokestack at Manhanset was a thirdOne of these house movers declaresthat there is no building howeverheavy however bulky which cannot blifted from its foundations and conveyed any distance This means ofcourse without any damage to thebuilding itself that the very ornamentson the mantel pieces the inthe cabinets will in no way be disturbedjthat the window glass will not be evencracked that the home life of the family occupying the moving house will beundisturbed Such is absolutely thefact It is not necessary for the occupants -of the building to temporarilychange their quarters to take the castors off the bedsteads nor to pack upall the perishable articles in the houseIt is on record that an old tall clockwhich was in a house which was movedin Westchester county 1 Y neverstopped running all during theprogress of removal On the otherhand there seems to be no limit to themovers capabilities as far as weight isconcerned The Brighton Beach hotelwhich was placed on 150 flat cars andmoved GOO feet weighed 5000 tons Theweight of the recently moved railroadstation at Mott Haven N Y is 700tons This building was composed entirely of brick and stone and the weightis very unequally distributed a centraltower alone weighing 500 tons To befrank these feats take all of the wonderment out of the raising of the pyramids and

atdifferent times for the utilization ofthe energy developed by the rise andfall of the tides but the intermittentcharacter of the power haa usually prevented any satisfactory solution of theproblem There is however one instance in which tide power has beenquite successf uJly applied in a very simple manner Along the river front atLiverpool there is a tendency for theaccumulation of silt against the dockwalls requiring occasional dredgingfor its removal Instead of using scoopdredges this mud is removed at different periods toy the use of tide powerin the following manner Along thebase of the dock wall is laid a pipe perforated with holes directed outwardthis pipe being connected with the interior of the dock system and suitablevalves being provided to permit orcheck the flow of water When thetide is very low and consequently thehead of water measured from the surface in the docks is at its greatest asudden opening of the connection permits a rapid flushing action by thewater escaping through the holes in thepipe at the base of the walls scouringout the mud and driving it out intothe river to be carried away As thetides at Liverpool average about 25 feetor more it is evident that this simpleform of dredging apparatus may bevery effective and as the time chosenfor using it may be selected when thesupply of water is greatest it does notinterfere with the regular use of thedocks Ultimately no doubt the introduction of practical and economicalforms of power storage will render theequalization of tide power commercially practicable but at the present timethis example serves to demonstrate thefact that solar and lunar attractionas expressed by the tides have beenharnessed in a small way at leastCassiers MagazineFalling Walls at FireThere are several kinds ofBawwfallingwalls and the fireman of experience knows them well and what to expect from each There is one kind thatbreaks first at the bottom and comesdown almost straight somewhat like acurtain This makes a big noise

many fatalities Then there Isthe one that breaks at the bottom andcomes straight out reaching clearacross the street and remaining almostsolid until it strikes and as an old fireman once remarked

BIRDSSome Facts Wliicli Farmers SlioulrtAlways Bear in MindProbably few farmers have any ideaof the assistance which they receivefrom friends who ask no reward exceptnow and then a little fruit or a fewseeds of grain A recent number of theNational Stockman gives a mass of testimony as to the noble work done bythe birds in the destruction of grasshoppers and other insects The experiments were made by Prof Aughey ofthe University of Nebrask Tabulatedresults show conclusively that birds ofall kinds were doing their best to reduce the number of locusts The birdsof the thrush family were examinedfirst The stomachs of six robins contained the remains of 265 locusts threewood thrushes had 68 locusts one hermit thrush contained 19 locusts twoolive backed thrushes had gathered in55 locusts two Wilsons thrushes absorbed 73 of the pests while five catbirds had called 152 of the insectsThree blue birds yielded 677 of thehoppers and one little ruby crownedkdnglet showed up 29 as the resultofiJUiftitmicecontained no less than 250 specimensand nine long tailed chickadees had secured by hard work 481 of these enemies of agriculture Four slenderbilled nuthatches had the remains of92 locusts But the little warblers alsoinsisted in taking a hand in the general massacre for seven golden warblers turned in 77 locusts and 176 otherinsects Five black throated greenwarblers had secured UG of the hoppers and 104 other insects Four blackpoll warblers gathered 123 locusts and47 other insects Eight prairie warblersshowed the remains of 116 locusts anda still larger number of other insectsSeven barn swallows called dn 139 locusts eight cave swallows exhibited326 of the pests five bank swallowscontained 104 and ten purple martinshad sacrificed 265 of these insectsMany of these

bodies of fourlocusts Ten specimens of the yellowbilled cuckoos yielded 416 locusts and52 other insects But the woodpeckers were evidently bent on businessand did not confine themselves to asingle article of diet for 29 woodpeckers contained S53 locusts and 725 insects of various sorts Even the birdsof- prey seemed to have joined in thegood work for 18 owls examined displayed the remains of almost 600 locusts and other insects Not to be outdone by the owls the xwo i awks whichwere taken gave up 378 locusts In thesime line followed the wild turkeysgrouse prairie hens and quail Emulating the above good examples a largevariety of shore birds did almost equally good work considering that theirnatural food is largely found in thewaterIn view of the above can anyfarmer have a shadow of doubt as tothe inestimable value of the birds asaids in protecting his crops If a fewbirds furnished such results for a single days work what would be theresult were a calculation to be madeof the work of all the birds for an entire season All sorts of birds wereexamined from the pelican with itsmammoth form to the gem like hum-miner bird and all proved to be thefriends of the farmed in protecting hiscrops from the ruthless invader Howfoolish is he who allows these his alliesto be hunted as if they were robbersand enemies and especially where heallows them to be slaughtered for

of ways and means for preventingtheir future recurrence or for restraining the swollen stream within safe limits Some urge a stronger and highersystem of levees others the opening ofnew or reopening of old channelsthrough which the river may be partlyor- wholly diverted from its presentcourse and others yet other projectsall of course involving the doing oimuch work and the spending of muchmoney The further suggestion is madeas applicable for the execution of anyof these schemes that the manual laborrequired on the vast job shall be done bythe able bodied inmates of the prisonsof the various interested stales Thissuggestion is an eminently practicalone and it leads to the further suggestion that just such jobs afford the bestpossible held for the emplo3ment ofconvict laborCountry and suburban roads for example which in all parts of theunion are in need of improvement Thespring season is the best of all timesfor road building It is the very timewhen farmers and villagers are mostbusy with other matters and can leastwell devote attention to the roads Andit is the time when the housed up prisoners are most in need of wholesome occupation in the open air There arethree elements of the problem whichunerringly point to its right solutionIf to do work when it can best be donewith the least possible disturbance ofother industries and at the lowest costto the proprietor and to the greatestbenefit to the workmen and indeed toall concerned if that be business wisdom the inmates of our state prisonsshould be set at road making forthwithIn that way they will get the exercisethey need the public will get the muchneeded good roads and there will be nocompetition between convict and freelabor How much the convicts needsuch work is demonstrated in the Kingscounty penitentiary where the inmatesare reported to be in danger of goingmad some of them actually doing sothrough enforced idleness How muchimproved roads are needed almost anysuburban or rural village

attemptsto suck When weaned the flap ofleather in front can be removed y unbuckling the straps and the other partconverted into a useful leather headstall This muzzle does not hinder animals from eating grass even if it bevery short as the flap if properly fixedgoes out in front sufficiently to enablethem to graze wi th freedom After having them on for a day or two they become quite adepts at feeding with themThe two leather straps underneath theheadstall one on each side and extending to the flap in front can be shortenedor lengthened at will The two ironclips which are riveted on the frontflap of the muzzle are to prevent it rolling up when the leather gets wetFarm JournalDEPENDS ON FEEDINGHow toTurn a Promising Calf Into aProiitable CowWhen calves are intended to begrown for cows it is a great mistake tofeed them so heavily as to increase thetendency to fatten Often this can beseen at birth in the thick bull likeneck and heavy head In such case itis best to fatten and sell to the butcherno matter what stock may be its ancestry But frequently also the calf whichseems to be all right for a good milkeris fed so heavity and on such fatteningfood that its tendency for life to produce fat and beef rather than milk andbutter is fully established To grow agoodcowthe calf should not be stuntedsays American Cultivator That willimpair digestion which is just as important for the cow as it is for a beefanimal Calves intended to be kept forcows should have much succulent foodwith enough of the kind of nutrition required to make large growth Then itwill be well developed and
