One of the largest stock t ' s ever
held here was that of Vimcnt & Mcln
trye Saturday beginning at ) o'clock
a. m. and continuing until ai-ii-i four.
It had been well advertised and the
weather, which had been unpropitious
during the entire week, became mild
and bright on that day. From six
hundred to eight hundred people were
present. The bidding was spirited,
considering the large amount of stock
offered The sale, however, lost a
little of its life near the close as it
was getting late and it is claimed by
some that a few of the horses did not
bring as much as they otherwise
would have done. Most of the large
crowd present was served with burgoo
at noon. Auctioneer Speakes, of Paris,
was in charge. About 15U head of
sheep, 150 head of hogs and shoats, 40
head of milk cows, 100 cattle and 100
horses and mules constitute the sale.
Brood sows sold from SU to $30 ;shoats
S7 to $8.50; sheep, $4.40 to $7.35;
cows, $40 to $100; cattle, $35 to $65;
mules in pairs, S320 to S470 mules,
single, So".50 to 2'22.5!J: horses,

horse in pairs $400 to $.100. g ife
Cut-Out Petitions Presented Le
Bus.
The Pendelton County Board of Con
trol of the Burley Tobacca Society
having adopted resolutions to raise no
tobacco this year is urging President
LeBus to call a meeting of the Dis
trict Board for consideration of the
cut-out question with the recommend
ation that it be indorsed. Petitions
from mpmbers of the Burley Tobacco
Society in Fayette, Mason and other
counties have been presented.
President LeBus is still silent on the
subject, but men close to him say that
he will not call a special meeting, feel
ing that the question will be fully con
sidered at the regular meeting of the
District Board, the sacond Tuesday in
March.
The purpose of the meeting of the
Executive Committee of the Burley
Tobacco Union called for Tuesday next
remains unexplained. There is, how
ver.'conjecture that it has to do with
the cut-out.
