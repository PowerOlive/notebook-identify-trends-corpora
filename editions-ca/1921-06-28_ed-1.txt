The people of a city havethe right to expect from the head oftheir government the same carefulattention to the economical expenditure of their money as he gives tohis own private business. There hasalways been and there always willbe taxation of "the people for themaintenance of public improvements,and the necessary expenses incidentto the running of the city, but thetaxation should not be excessive and.the funds should be carefully expended with the sole purpose in viewof giving the most benefit to thegreatest number. I make this paramount issue in my campaign, anduse it as a basis for my appeal foryour co-operation and support.To the women of Paris, who haverecently been given the opportunityto take an equal part "with the menin selecting their city officials, I makean earnest appeal for your support.It lies within your power to makeParis a city second to none in progressiveness in the Bluegrass. Yourminds are not tainted with "politics,"in its commonly, accepted form, andyou are able to exercise the right ofsuffrage in a manner which will tendto make your home town a betterplace to live in.Respectfully,JOHN MBRRINGER.SUMMER SHOE SALEALL OUR SUMMER SHOES ATCOST AND BELOW.

Does Dr. Keller simplyflock to himself and he the president,board of directors and members, allin one?This is the season of the year whenthe county papers regale us with stories of people choking to death fromchicken bones in their throats. Withchicken at the present prices we maycongratulate ourselves that thus theyare protected from a pleasant risk.When a preacher solicits yoursupport for an office, ask him whatis his object in abandoning thesacred calling of the lowly Nazarene for politics. If you will investigate before you make any promisesyou will uncover "a nigger in awoodpile."We hope there is no truth in thestory that land at Chateau Thierryhas been leased to a syndicate whosepurpose is to build there a palatialgambling hellS in the expectation,we suppose, that it will attract agreat many Americans. It is a project that should not be suffered togo further and against which it"would be proper, as it seems to us,for America officially and actually,to enter protest. Chateau Thierryis sacred ground, and must be keptsacred.The old penalty of the treadmillought to be revived for .the speedmaniacs. Constant motion withoutthe ability to get anywhere would bea punishment fitting the crime; anda taste of it might correct the impulse to go flying through the public streets to2 the great danger ofother people's lives and limbs. But,will the time ever come when thesespeed maniacs will have any consideration for the public.For the benefit of those who, having "cleansed" the State of thewhisky habit scan the daily papersfor evidence of how thorough the"cleansing" has been would purgeit of tobacco, we would note that asfar back as Shakespeare's day hempand tobacco were paired as joint dangers to the throat. Now, both ofthese are products of Kentucky, andespecially, of Bourbon county. Clearly, we cannot have the kind of Commonwealth in which it will be apleasure to dwell until these cropsare "prohibited" and "condemned."oFITND T0 TRAIN KENTUCKY'SCBIPPLESUnder tw provisions of the rehabilitation mt passed by Congress,Kentucky will have $22,000 the firstof July to retain cripples in industry, and others for civil employment,if the State Is able to match theFederal appropriation.

If the State Vocational Board isable to raise $5,000 or $6,000through voluntary donations it willbe able to begin the training ofcripples in industry before the nextlegislature meets at which a bill willbe submitted providing for an appropriation to match the Federalfund.Over 15,000 cases are handledyearly by the Workmen's Compensation Board and of the number atleast 2,500 are men who have received permanent injuries.
