While there are many more tocome those that are here are takingadvantage of the beautiful weatherand yesterday morning arid afternoontne squad was out at the park, goingthrough a few preliminary maneuvers,Several of the men are in good shapeowing to the fact they have done somelittle practice since the opening ofspring.Pitcher Pete Wood, who came ilast week, has not lost a moment andin spite .of the absence of trainingmates on his arrival took up the workof conditioning all alone. Accompanying Manager Lewis was ReubenKoehler, of Marietta, Pa., who cameup with the Bourbonite leader. Othersto arrive Wednesday were E. Clark, ofCincinnati ; . H. S.

It is expected that Kuhlman will come acrosswith his contract some' time in thenear future, but as to Hauser andHarrell nothing definite can be stated.Local fans are very much put outover the refusal so far of Hauser tosend in his contract.

All the Democratic candidates arenot only willing but anxious to tell thepeople where they stand on the tariff.Look to the opposition headquartersfor a discussion of this vital subjectand you are greeted with a silence sothick that it could be cut with a knife.Mr. Roosevelt is busy trying to arousethe people with the"recall of Judges"issue, and Mr. Taft is doing his bestto standpat. The Democrats, on theother handfare citing facts and figuresto drive home the one great truth thatthe cause of the present hih cost ofliving in this country isdue to the hightariff wall, and to that alone.So apparent has it become that thetariff trusts have been using'the tariff all these years as a weapon to gougeprofits out of the consumers of theland, that it is next to pathetic tohear the protectionists jn Congressstill shouting, as they occasionally do,that to remove the tariff, or reducethe rates of the present law, wouldtake away the "protection for theAmerican working man." Protectionist orators in both Houses of Congress, driven to desperation by theknowledge, that the people at last understand the real issue, are making alast frantic effort to drag out the old,tattered Bogey man of "Compttitionwith the pauper labor of Europe," inthe hope of making the voters oncemore swallow the bait. But the .tariffwill not down, and the protectionists'cries are becoming weaker and weakerThe Democrats investigation,whichwere so much derided when they wererfistp ut into operation taught lessonswhich are daily sinking deeper anddeeper into the minds of the people.The light thrown on the methods ofthe steel -trust by the Stanley committee, the exposure of the rottenness inthe administration of the agriculturedepartment by the Moss committee;the shameful renditions in the woolenindustry a9 brought out by the RulesCommittee- investigation; the pettymanipulation cf public moneys in theState Department, as shown by the inquiries of the Hamlin committee, andthe various other revelations by theDemocrats of the House, all revealingthat wherever the light was thrownmaladministration inefficiency and actual graft lay exposed all have servedto convince the people that the Democrats not only haye proven worthy ofthe trust placed in them a year agobut that they are worthy of those"graver repsonsibilities"which Speaker Champ Claik said the party wouldprove itself capable of carrying.The battle of next November is going to center around the tariff Whichis the mother of all thejevils that havegrown up under the present systemdespite the efforts of the protectionists to sidetrack that question -andbring less' impor tant, issues (o thefront.It's Enough.."How do you get capers?- Do youdig 'em or what?" .
