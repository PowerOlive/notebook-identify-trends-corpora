Lord Roberts, lovingly known as
"Bobs," said by Emperor William, of
Germany, to be "the greatest soldier
of modern times," died in France, Sat
urday, where he had been visiting the
Indian troops of the British armv
corps. His death was due to pneu
monia. The news of Lord Roberts' death
was received by telegraph from Field
Marshall Sir John French.
Lord Roberts was born in 1832 in
Cawnpore, India. It was in the Indian
service that the gallant and efficient
Irish soldier achieved his first and
lasting fame. It was in South Africa
in his later years that this was sup
plemented and magnified by his
achievements m Great Britain's vic
torious campaign against Boers.
But it was as Field Marshal and
Earl that Lord Roberts formally
known, it was as "Bobs" that the men
of the ranks knew him, loved liim
and greeted him. In their estimation
and that of the admiring public no
name could fit liim better than this
diminutive of his family name and the
word meaning "hero" in Hindu.
Showered as he was with honors
and titles by his own country, it was
not by that nation alone that his mil
itary abilities were appreciated.
"The greatest soldier of his time,"
were the words used by Emperor Wil
liam, of Germany, in paying tribute
to him.
For more than half a century Eng
land has had occasion to take pride in
the career of Roberts, the soldier.
In nine of her wars he was in the
thick of the fighting, and was many
times wounded. As he fought he rose
from a supernumerary subaltern in
the horse artillery to Field Marshal
and Commander-in-Chief of all the
British armies.
As further rewards he was made a
peer of the realm and was the recipi
ent ot distinguished orders or wmen

larly interesting in conjunction with
"Adventures in Diplomacy" is the fact
that this story is laid around similar
conditions to thosce that existed be
tween Au'stria and Servia prior to the
present great conflict in Europe. It
is such minor incidents that fan the
spark of diplomatic dealings into
flame and cause nations to enter a
conflict. The "Adventures in Di
plomacy" is a story of two foreign
spies commissioned oy their govern
ment to secure at all costs a secret
treaty which is in possessidn of the
ambassador of Venezuela. This
treaty involves the affairs of Venezu
ela and Mexico and have a deep in
