Washington No Declaration ofWar is Now NecessaryWashington April 22 Diplomaticrelations between the United Statesand Spain are at an end It is expected that from now on events will movewith amazing rapidity up to the climaxof actual war Judge Day assistantsecretary of state early Thursdaymorning received a cablegram fromMinister Woodford at Madrid statingthat he had been handed his passportsand had been notified that official relations between the United States andSpain were endedHis cablegram said that he had beengiven the passports before he had hadan opportunity to present the ultimatum transmitted to him for submission to the Spanish government thedelivery of the ultimatum to MinisterPolo having been accepted by the Spanish government as a formal announcement on our partJudge Day at once hurried to thewhite house where he found PresidentMcKinley about to enter a carriage totake Mrs McKinler to the railroadstation where he intended to see heroff on a short trip to New York Thenews that diplomatic relations between the United States and Spainwere formally at an end was so important that the president bade a hastygood bye to his wife on the whitehouse portico and repaired immediately to the upstairs part of the housewhere he and Judge Day held a conference the result of which was thedispatch of Secretary Porter to thecapitol to communicate the news tcthe senate committee on foreign relations and also to leading members ofthe house It is presumed that thiswas done in order to facilitate any action deemed necessary by congressBy a hasty summons Senator Davisof Minnesota chairman of the senatecommittee on foreign relations Senator Lodge of Massachusetts a member of the committee Senator Allisonof Iowa a leader in that body andothers were brought to the whitehouse where they joined AssistantSecretary Day and the president shortly after 10 oclock in a conferencewhose purpose is to map out the immediate policy of the United StatesThe conference broke up shortlyafter half past ten oclock Judge Dayaccompanied by Senator Lodge goingover to the state department The assistant secretary would say nothingregarding the conference further thanto authorize the statement that a public announcement would be made laterin the day Chairman Davis of thesenate foreign relations committee waslaconic and not explicit simply remarking Weve taken the trickSenator Cullom of Illinois of theforeign relations committee was atthis conference also and at 11 oclockon leaving the white house said sthatthe handing of the passports to Minister Woodford constituted the Spanishreply and endedc all jjeacef ulSFjuionsWhile ati effort mighffbe made in congress to make a formal declaration ofwar there was no occasion for it andin his opinion there probably would benone He add ed There is enough of astate of war now existingEverything now he suggested wouldgo ahead without preliminary actionof a formal declaration of war by congress The next step he said wouldbe to call out the troopsThe president did not indicate to thesenators and members of the housewith whom he talked Thursday thathe considered a declaration of warnecessary and it is understood that hehas been advised by some of thosewhose advice he most relies upon thatno declaration is necessary Some ofthe leading senators consider thatthe congressional resolutions andthe ultimatum sent to Spain are allthat is necessary to give notice to theworld that a state of war exists whileothers say a manifesto to the powersadvising them of the condition of affairs might be wellThe best information is that thepresident is disposed to regard this advice and the probabilities now are thathe will not ask congress to make aformal declaration of warThe navy department Thursdayaside from giving the orders to thesquadron continued the work of adding to the navy and purchased another ship at Norfolk as anauxiliary craft and some smallyachts The news of the actual beginning of war was received withgravity at the department and therewere many speculations as to the destination of the Spanish squadron Onesuggestion was that it is heading tocut off the fine battle ship Oregon nowon its way from the Pacific

in thefull glow of a camp fire from which therest of us shrunk back a little ThereaTe no wolves now in the Adirondackwoods at least I dont know of anyEverybody hates a wolf and the uglybrutes have all been killed off I guessThe only game laws for them are suchas offer a reward for their scalpsThen there used to be wolves inthese parts I queriedlie pushed a fallen brand back intothe fire with his boot heelOh yes 1 can remember whenthere were droves of them and bythat you may know without lookingIm not particularly young Yes Iknow a thing or two about wolves andlet me tell you right here theyre theugliest thing that carries a howl insidea hide when once they get on yourtrail Catamounts are bad enough butthey dont run in packs Ive knowna bear 1o take a lot of lead to settleihim but you only have to tackle oneor maybe two at a time Quite rightyou are there used to be wolves aboutIhere ad Im not the one to forgetStHe paused after the manner of oldmen who want encouiagement to tellaYouveexclaimedhad an adventure then 1Go ahead and tell us allabout itAn adventure to make your hairstand on end he cried warming tothe subject and sitting erect Anyhow it made mine stick up like thebristles on a brush You see had another life to look out for besides myown and that almost scared mecrazyHe rose to throw on fresh logs andwhile they sputtered and blazed andcast a flickering gleam on tree trunks- deep among theshadows lie settledstoryI was only 14 then and my sistercouldnt have been more than sevenWe were living near Three Falls closeby the river It was well along in December and though for a wonderihere wasnt muck snow the ice was afoot thick and in many places sosmooth and black that you could hardly teli it from open water Of course Twas wild to go skating and mother toldme I might if Id take along sisterLorena and be sure to come back earlySo I got out little boxsled andtucked in Lorena snug and warm andl we startedThat sled was really a sort of miniature sleigh built especially forLorena who was the spoiled child inour family It had a cushioned seatand padded sides and a back so highthat I could skate behind and push itlike one of those new fangled babycarriagesIll never forget how Lorena lookedthat day she comes up before mysight just as the howling of thewolves sounds ii my ears whenever 1think about it She had yellow hairand big eyes and a rosebud sort offace and when she wanted anythingshe had only to pout just the least bitand she got it right away She waswrapped and niuflled until she seemedas broad as she was long but her rosycheeks peeped out of her soft worstedhood like a bright red pink smotheredin a bed of white ones Our Lorenawas a little beauty and no mistake forall she was sister to such a plain-lookingfellowWe went on the ice just above therapids and as soon as I had strapped- on my skates and stamped in the heel-brads we started up tlie river Minewere the old fashioned kind of skatesof course the sort that turns up infront with brass knobs over j our toesV but I had ground the edges sharp as askinning kuife At overy stroke theysheared frosty shavings from the iceand the sled runners fairly roared asthey sped over its surface Lorenashrieked and gurgled with delightand we were having such fun that before we realized it we had reached thehead of the stillwater almost nineimTos from -home much further thanwe had meant to go It was a wildplace shut in by high banks and thick-woods with a noisy fall breakingthrough a narrow gorge half chokedwith ice and yocks right in our pathto bar further progress This broughtus to a standstill and me at least toiny sensesLorena we must hurry straighthome I cried1STRUCK HIM FULL IN THE XOZZLEcomfort and hisBut Lorena insisted on getting outand stamping her feet to warm Ihema little Then she ran away to get anearer look at the fall and I raced afterher in alarm for the place was dangerous She ran clear to the bank butthere slipped and fell Just as Ireached her a sound issued from theforest that made my boyish heartslump down into my boots I hadheard the cry of wolves beforeI caught Lorena up in my arms andstaggered toward the sledWhat makes you so rough brotherXat she complained beginning to ciyWe must hurry or mother wontlike it I answered briefly and as Ispoke again came the howl of thewolves louder than before distincteven above the noise of the tremblingwaters Lorena heard it and clutchedme she would scarcely let go when Tdumped her into the box but I pulledmyself away slewed the sled aroundand began to push it homeward at topspeed As I rounded the first bend Ilooked back I saw a dark gaunt formleap down on the ice at the very placewhere Lorena had stumbled I had noticed a sort of track there Then cameanother and another and still othersThe whole pack was after usA boy and a baby We were defenseless I knew well it was a racefor life Lorenas life and mine Thechild began screaming which onlymade the hungry beasts more eagerI bent hard to my work and chiseledthe ice with sharp thrusting strokesSuppose a skate should loosenThe wolf pack rounded the bend behind us like hounds in full crle still Lorena I gasped in herear youre just callin them on andshe choked back her sobsThus far I had kept my distancethat and no more but could I keep thepace The sky was heavilj cloudedand the wind was rising fortunatelyat my back Xight was coming onfast but I feared the light would lastquite long enough to show the endSuddenly with a jolt and a clamoiof the jarring sled runners Ave strucka stretch of rough ice hubbly ice asboys call it Here it was impossible togo so fast and the fierce pack rapidlygained on us I strained with desperateeffort but my muscles felt leaden andmy throat and lungs seemed burnt outby the panting gulps of frosty air 1swallowed At last the foremost wollcame so close that my right skate as itlifted struck him full in the muzzlethe keen edge gashing it so deeply thatthe iron was stained with blood as 1rrWagaintonoticed afterward The snapping jawsof another grazed my left ankle butjust ah all was lost we shot out uponsmooth ice again and at the same moment u strong gust from behindswept me forward with its sudden impulse I cast back one terrified glanceand saw the white teeth and red lolling tongues several rods in the rearand for some minutes I steadily drewaway from them Then as a turn oithe river deprived me of my advantage from the wind I was barely ableto hoid what I had wonIt was now growing very dark Icould barely make out my tracks between the blacker shadows of the riveibanks 1 was weary beyond the possibility of any further spurting andLorena 1 thinkwas scarcely conscious but in the distance 1 thought1 caught a glimpse of the village lightson the hill 7Then all at once I felt the iceyielding and cracking under ourweight but only for a moment we didnot quite break through and again Ifelt the solid floor of the frozen river beneath my feet Behind us rose a loudsplashing and

byaccident on the coachmans room at thehead of the back stairs had frightenedthat worthy almost out of his sensesso that he had just presence of mindenough to hurl a convenient whisky bottle at the intruders head and to get upand bolt his door after the burglar andthe bottle had disappeared togetherdown the back stairs In the morningnot a particle of silverware was missing but the unfastened kitchen window and the remains of the whisky bottle were ample proof s of the coachmansstoryNothing was more needed thoroughlyto arouse the Misses A whose turnmust surely come now and whosebrother had just at this unfortunatejuncture been called out of town Theyspent that day in anxiously taking inventory of their valuables and gathering them together into one bundle forsafe keeping Taking a strong

they had washed out the silvertopped inkstand and added that and thepearl set miniature of Uncle Addisonthey glanced proudly around the denuded house and felt that the work wascomplete The basket was stored in thefurthest- depths of their bedroom closetand the sisters locked their door andwent happily to sleepAnd that night a burglar a genuinelive burglar entered the house Hesoon discovered the

clipped into thecloset brought out the heavy basket ofvaluables unlocked their door and setthe basket down in the hall just outside Then they rapidly locked the dooragain and took refuge themselves in thefurthest end of the closetAnd as the burglar walked calmly upthe stairs and secured the basket andcarried it away with him he realizedthat in this world of trouble and anxiety it rarelj happens to

farmers institute Prof AY A Henry dean of the Wisconsin agriculturalcollege said concerning the size ofbeets The best sugar beets weighabout two pounds each Do not try togrow great large beets thinking theyare the best Years ago when I waslooking up the beet sugar question inCalifornia I had a conversation withsome of the officials of the SouthernPacific Eailx oad company in their officein San Francisco I was urging uponthem the importance of beet sugar production in California Col Crocker theleader showed much indifference saying that he had lost 30000 in trying tcpromote this very enterprise I toldhim that that was not necessarily areason why beetsugar production couldnot yet be profitable Later on in ourconversation when talking about Californias wonderful productions he saidthat in his experiments he had grownbeets that weighed 20 or 30 pounds eachAs soon as he told me this I repliedThere Col Crocker is one of the reasons your factory failed You thoughtlarge beets were good beets when intruth they are poor beets and helpedwreck your factory You should havetried to -produce smallbeets but manyto the acre and such if grown properly would have been rich in sugar

Oneshould be convenient to the barn andshould be reserved especially for theteams With cattle and sheep andhorses and hogs not onlj is a changeof pasturage beneficial but the pasturewill be eaten down

andmature seed But where the stock arechanged from one pasture to anotherevery two or three weeks all of thegrass will be eaten down more evenlyand there will be much less waste Toprovide the necessary pasturage itshould be arranged for in good seasonso that after grass starts up in thespring they can be ready for use whenneeded While it is an item to haveplenty of good pasture at the same
