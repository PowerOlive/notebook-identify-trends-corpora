exclaimed Mr TymSo it seemed The buccaneer hadbeen on our lee bow when first discovered and was still well to the southBy squaring our yards then and deliberately pointing our nose southwest we meant to run under his verynoseAnd yet it stands to be his safestplan said Capt Sellinger A shipTike this riding light and with a pooplike a church will do nothing save withthe wind Once let us fetch by and ourchances are doubledThe buccaneer had altered hiscourse as we altered ours and was nowstanding a few points sotith of eastHe could scarce be better than a mileand a half away and we saw plainlythe moving black dots of the crewabout his decks He was a handsometigerish looking fellow let him be whoor what he mightNearer and nearer swung the buccaneer I could catch even the flash ofhis wet side now as he rolled with asort of swagger to the successive uplifting seas Nearer still till a halfmile is reeled off and less than a wholeone separates usA drum on our quarter deck beatThe armored guards fell into line andtheir captain drew his sword andstepped out upon the flank Three ofthe dons came out of the cabin all incuirasses buff gantlets and broadbelts hung with pistols Don LuiDelasco

something shook outabove te heads of those on his quarterTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY FRIDAY APRIL 28 1899deck and up to the mizzen topgallantmast traveled a flag It blew out as itwent broad double cross on a crimsonfieldEnglish I could not help sayingwith the water ready to start in myeyes God bless herShe would merely ask us to heaveto said Capt Sellinger in my earMarry a modest request for a craft of200 tons to make of one of five Nowlets see what the old peacock will doCapt Placido hurried up to the governor and said a few words What t li ieanswer was I could not guess but atonce the captain ran to the mainhatch lifted it and roared downTrain your broadside and lireThen he waved his arms and shoutedto those manning the gunsAim cud tireThe ship trembled with the trenu i -donsconcussion Smoke seemed to risefrom everywhere and the buccaneerdisappeared momentarily behind theveilWhen it drifted away at Inst he wasstill driving toward tis and seeminglyunharmedSome one touched me on the arm Iturned and discovered Mr TymBide a moment and then come below Let the hatch drop after youI was brought abruptly back to ourown business and shook myself together Nobody seemed to be payingany attention to me I slipped over anddropped quietly down the hatchThe place was in some gloom forthe port on the cooks side that is fheone toward the enemy was closed andthe other stood but an inch or two uponthe hookThe crisis is not far off said MrTym wherefore we must be prepared Should the Pilanca stand thebattering and break by we could scarcebe too speedy in taking leaveI apprehended him Once get thebuccaneer astern and the Tilanca stoodfair to shake him off In that rase wemust needs act quickly or not at allI now inquired for Mac Ivrach andwas told that he would be with us presentlyLet us see how near she is said Iand I unhooked the starboard portMarry she is on our quarter I exclaimed in surprise She is not abovehalf a mile distant and we have clearly dropped herThe others looked anxiously over myshoulderNay vou are a little in error saidthe captain She is more astern butquite as nearShe should put forth her best efforts now wherever she is said MrTym after a critical glance She isnot sure of finding another such opportunityShe fetches about to give us herother broadside I exclaimed a moment laterI felt secretly thankful that at leastthe after part of the ship now prettyeffectually shielded us butBy heavens they have winged uscried Capt Sellinger as a sharp crackling noise rose above the other soundsfollowed 13 the thump of some heavyobjectA big spar or I am a liar he wenton Nay but the buccaneer managesbravelyThat may bring the matter to ahead said Mr Tym coolly I thinkwe should now do well to armWe ran over to our own corner accordingly and hurriedly produced ourconcealed weapons These had beenhidden away since first we came onboard With other preparations MrTym failed not to screw in his curiousarm daggerScarce was this done when some ofthe Pilaneas guns began in turn tothunder None were of large caliberbeing merely a few deck pieces on thestern and we felt little fear of theirworkSome one comes I cried for atthat moment the hatch in the forecastle banged sharply downI think Mac Ivrach cried Mr Tymstepping out where he could commandthe view Aye he immediately announced it is the cookThe fellow came in a run Launchthe raft he cried and dinna stop toclaver A thinks hae gaen wrangWe patised for no more than to getthe sense of his words and flew to theraft and dragged it outThere were now varied thumpingnoises on deck which I took to be theclearing away of the fallen spar andother debris and I was just wonderingwhether the ships people felt assuredof their escape when there was a commotion of voices aft and immediateh1a little thunder of trucks showed thatthe door leading into the soldiersberth had been run openQuick1 cried Mr Tym Out withit The guards are upon usWe snatched up the raft as thoughit had been a clothes pole and madeone fair thrust of it into the waterDeil tak the aim pots growledMae Ivrach They hae broucht abootthis bauchle Their craving bailiescouldna bide till the messListen friends said Mr Tym without turning his head We must fetchthis thing to a close In a moment theywill have firearms and it will be toolate 1 see no hope except that thecaptain and I may stand them off tillyou Ardick with Mae Ivrach retreatto the raft That done we will make adiversion and attempt to join youIt shall be done sir said I promptlyGet you upon the raft I said hurriedly to Mac Ivraeh I will cast offand followVera gude he answered coollyand slipped through the port I wasto follow for the time indeed pressedwhen the fellows in the forecastle gavea triumphant shoutThey have pistols cried the captain warningly They are going toshootThe frail bulkhead was no barrier tobullets and I threw myself flat AsI did so I saw Mr Tym drop to allfoursTwo heavy reports followed and thesmoke drove in at the doorway Iscrambled to my feet and had Mr Tyminstantly in my eye He was straightening up and glancing around Theeptain was dose behind him but sitting flat with his knee cradled in hishandsThey have disabled me Fly Iheard him say and with that menburst in at both entrancesCHAPTEK XOF A MYSTERIOUS DECREE OF FATEI cannot pretend to give clear details of what followed Mr Tym lungedback desperately and I saw one fellow double up and fall The next mantripped over him and the supercargoimproved the time to wheel and rushto my sideOut was the one word he said andI let go the painter and sprang uponthe ledge of the port As the end ofthe line whisked clear I stooped andshot headlong downI rose to the surface at once andshook the water from my eyes Thefirst thing 1 saw was the great impending bulk of the ship It toweredfar over me and was rushing pastflooding back frothing and dividedseas I fought my way to the top ofthe next crest and looked around Tomy joy Mr Tym was close at handspitting and shaking his head asthough he had just come up from hisdive but riding lightly and easilyTurning my head to see what had become of Mac Ivrach and the raft I sawthe structure pitching up and downon a neighboring sea but to my sorrow without the ScotchmanIn the line of the raft but near amile away was the pursuing ship Shewas a bad mess forward for her sprittopmast had been shot away and someof the litter was dragging over thebowsI had time for no more than thisflash of a look about All my attention was now tipon the rushing bulk ofthe ship She was so nearthat I could see little higher than herbulwarks Her ports on that side wereopen though the guns had not beentised and in each opening were theprotruding heads of the gunnersThe ship seemed to lift away fromus and at once we got the range ofher whole side To my dismay all thebulwarks were overhung with headsand a dozen or more of the steelshelled guards showed above the lowpoop rail The story of our doings hadspread over the ship at last and doubtless the angry dons were primed forvengeanceThere seemed to be nothing that wecould do unless it was to dive as theyM J SA LTy VvTrBy heavens he means to run the gauntletmade to fire and that would be likelyto prove of little avail Our main hopemust be in the poorness of their aimand the little time we should be withinrange 1 did not forget also that ourbobbing heads presented rather inferior targets They let go soon enoughfor I had scarce gotten the wholerange of their side when a score ormore of guns and pistols were aimedsome from as far forward as amidships and a blaze among the wholeline followedPoor shooting sir I shouted nota little relieved and even exhilaratedShall we swim for the raftWe turned as he spoke and to myastonishment there was the raft closeat hand For some reason it had comebefore the wind faster than I couldhave calculated and was ready now asa very timely refugeWe disregarded further danger fromthe shooting and faced about The raftcame on climbing a crest at the moment and riding swiftly down againand it was then that both of us criedout in amazement For a human headwas sticking above the stern end anda familiar shock oflight hair albeitnow darkened a little with the wetcovered the head Ln a word it wasthe worthy cookIse be there in a blink he calledDinna ye waste your strengthWe gave over further effort accordingly and directly the affair rode downto us I was the first out of the waterand gave Mr Tym a pull after whichMac Ivrach himself crawled outWe seized his hand and shook itheartilyAnd you saw us and urged the raftalong I said Seasonably done forwe were like to be weary ere wefetched itIs not the buccaneer recoveringhimself in some sort inquired MrTym after a moment or twoI rose as high as my knees and tooka shrewd lookAye he has got the greater part ofthe mess cleared away and holds onhis course I answered Ah me ifthe poor captain were but with us Iadded with a sighHither o God burst out MacIvrach Look yonnerWe had taken our eyes for a momentfrom the Pilanca but at this dreadfulexclamation half sprang up andturned that way What we saw struckthe blood from our cheeks and left ussilent with consternation The ship hadfetched perhaps two points to thewind bo that again we had an obliqueview of her side arid a scene on hermain deck was brought to view Agroup of figures there moved and inthe instant a single shape rose abovetheir heads and traveled up swiftlv tothe main yardarm There it seemedto dangle for a moment and then fellinto the motion of the ship and swungpendulum like in board and outIt was a time of horror and I scarceknow what we said We had no doubtthat the man was the captain for whoelse could be executed at such a timeMoreover when I came to look moreintently I made out a patch of whiteabout the upper part of his figurewhich would answer for the captainsshirt none of the crew wearing a garment of that description but onlyblouses and dark tunicsWe crouched low again and watchedthe poor body as it jerked and swungThere was a dreadful fascination inthe sight and for one I could not takemv eves from it I have the thoughtthat the supercargo broke out aswearing once not loud but as I mightsay between his teeth and that Ilaughed savagely when I heard himThe buccaneer continued to beardown upon tis and as soon as he waswithin reasonable signaling distanceMac Ivrach took off his waistcoat andwaved it It was as large a distressflag as we had for all of us were without coatsto be continuedHE FUMIGATEDUncle Got Rid of the

regiment tothe east of it and took up a positioncovering one and one half miles on thesouth bank of the Kio Grande On theopposite bank were fortified trenchesfrom which a few American soldierswould have been able to defy thousands so strongly were they constructedThe Americans found the trencheson the south bank of the river deserted which furnished them with coverfrom which they could pick off Filipinos whenever one of them showed hishead When the rebels began firingtwo puffs of smoke simultaneously fromthe trenches on each side of the railroad showed they were using cannonwhich was a genuine surprise to theAmericans Several shells burst closeto Gen Whcatons staff but it seemedthat the Filipinos failed to -master themachinery of modern shells as theywere unable to get the right rangeYoungs Utah battery was orderedinto position in the center of the Kansas regiment to silence the rebel gunsand at 11 oclock the rapid tire gunshad been ferried across the river andcame into

for labor ependedAt the Indiana station mangels weregrown at a labor cost of 107 a tonThis included plowing fitting planting weeding cultivation and harvesting The variety which made the largest yield and was easiest to remove fromthe ground and handle to and from thewagon was the Giant Yellow Intermediate It grows well out of tinground The neck of the largest mangels of this variety were small enoughto be grasped and picked up conveniently with one hand This is a lurjre savinsin time over the varieties which are solarge and round like a ball that theymust be fumbled to get a good hold orpossibly use two hands The Mammoth Long Red mangel is a good handler but last season did not yield aswell as the Giant Yellow intermediateFour varieties varied in yield from 30to 2 tons to the

all but a bunchevery eight inches then these should bethinned with the hand leaving only thestrongest plant of the bunch It is especially desirable that this thinning bewell done Where two plants are lefttogether neither makes a good growthin size or shapeTare should be taken not to allow theweeds to get started ahead of the mangels Keep the ground loose by meansof cultivation A spike tooth

Why GreenhousesStay Hot InsideIt is very curious said the old professor of physics to see how many marketgardeners there are who raise thingsunder glass make money out of theprocess and yet do not know why theirheating frames and their hothouses remain hot insideNow as a matter cf fact the heatmechanism of a hothouse depends ona well known proposition in physicsI suppose you are acquainted with thefact that the energy from the sun travels in the form of little wavesThe energy does not come down tous in straight lines it comes as it werein a zigzag manner dancing from sideto side as it comes along If thesewaves are very short light is the resultif they are a trifle longer they takethe form of heatIf the light waves strike anythingan the way down they are very apt tobe made longer or rather are apt to beturned into heat Now the waves whichform light are so short that they willreadily pass through glass but thewaves which form heat are so long thatthey will not pass throughFrom this therefore you will seewhy a hothouse remains hot The energy from the sun passes into the housethrough the glass roof in the form oflight Then it strikes the objects inthe house and is turned to heatUt this heat cannot pass out throughthe glass The heat waves are too longSo the light keeps coming in and theheat keeps accumulating and soon thehothouses become very warm indeedeven on the coldest days in winterOf course our dwelling houses areheated by the sun in the same way Thelight comes in through the windowsbut the heat cannot pass out BostonGlobeCHEAP MILK STOOLit Can lie Made at
