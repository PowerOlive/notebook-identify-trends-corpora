WOODROW WILSON,of New Jersey.For Vice-President,HON. THOS. R. MARSHALL,of Indiana.For Congress,HON. J. CAMPBELL CANTRILL,of Scott county.Prophet Without Honor.President Taft says that the Democratic policy as to the tariff will putan-end to propserity, shut down themills and factories and produce a panic worse than that of 1907. But thisprophet of evil is joined to his idol ofa high protective tanfffl, which heclaims is the cause of the country'sgreat propserity whereas, as a matterof fact it is in spite of it. Prosperityis due to record breaking crops andother natural causes. To tax the people for the benefit of the trusts andnot to pay the expenses of the government economically administered is acrime. The people have stood itas long as possible and have determined to punish those responsible for itby, electing a Democratic Presidentand a Democratic Congress.A Plague on Both.Governor Wilson does not hesitate tocharge that Colonel Roosevelt "did anillegal thing in order4to build up an irresistible power," as he terms it, inpermitting the Durchaseby the UnitedStates Steel Corporation of the Tennessee Coal 'and Iron Company. TheColonel says the power of the trustscan not be destroyed, but it should becontrolled as much as possible by ,'acommission. In other words tne trustsmust be asked to be good. It is optional with them whether they will or not.With Colonel Roosevelt coddling thetrusts and Taft showing his willingness to put ud with them as long asthey put up for his campaign fund,and both shouting for a high protective tariff, the people who suffer underthe burdens can well exclaim "A plague on both of your houses." A votefor Wilson and the Democratic nominees for Congress will put the seal ofyour condemnation on .such practically legalized robbery.Sacrifices to Curiosity." It can not be truthfully assertedthat the appalling lists of death due toaviation has-been wholly in the interests of science. Men who have fallento their death while expenmenting inthe field of aviation are entitled to allthe credit due to men who risk life inthe interests of scientific research.But a majority of the victims havemet death while exhibiting themselvesto the public, not as'scientists but as8homen. In response to a morbid demand of the'public for new thrills theyhave taken long chances for a price,not for the joy of discovery. Theirdeatha are due to the same cause thatimpels death defying feats under canvas. The general public wants to bethrilled. Americana deprecate the bullfight, and have put the prize fight under the ban. But, after all, isn't itjust as bad to demand that men shallrisk death in order to supplv the thrill,as it is to demand the blood of bulls orto delight in seeing two human animals, trained to the limit of physicalperfection, nummel each other to apulp under the glare of electric lightsin a roped in arena.It Looks Like a Crimeto separate a boy from Bucklen's Arnica Salve.His pimples, boils, scratches, knocks, sprains and bruises demandit. and its quick relief for burns,scalds or cuts is his right.

Only 25 cents atObedorfer's.Taft on Third Termers.That the third 'term movement isnot founded on any one principal orfor that matter on iny principle atall, but merely for the gratification ofone man's ambition and venegance;that it would go to pieces if its remarkable leader should die; that itscrazy quilt plattorm is madeip of anything and everything to catch votes ;that ft is more socialistic than anything suggested in the countries ofEurope, .and that it is destined to defeat are some of the charges that President 'Taft brings against ColonelRoosevelt and his so-called Progressiveparty. That these charges are truefew will deny but almost as strong anindictment can be found against theRepublican party which has fosteredthe interests at the expense of thepeople, wrung taxes from them on thenecessities of life and pursued a policyof making the rich richer and the poorpoorer. It has sinned away its day otgrace and just as sure as Novembercomes the unworthv servants will bescourged from the temple.Democracy's Day.In a speech in Louisiana, ColonelRoosevelt said, "We are through onceandfor all with the Republican party." That is one thing to his credit.The whole country seems tending thatway. The G. O. P. is thoroughly discredited. Its life is well nigh spent.When it lived it lived in clover andwhen it dies November 5 it will dieall over. Democracy's day is brightlydawning.India's Coal Production.India produces twelve million toniof coal a year.Get Busy.The belief is general that Wilsonand Marshall will be elected.

Y., met dpath yepterda.v morningabout 6:30 o'clock at the substation onthe Paris and Lexington interurbanline near this city, when he came incontact with a high tension elcetricwire.Luckett,' who was an expert electrician, had been in the employ of theelectric company for Eome time andhad been engaged for about five weekswith a force of men in installing a newplant at the substation. Yesterdaymorning he was working around vihatis known as the high tension oil switchand it is supposed he accidentally camein contact with a live wire.The current un the switch, it is said,had been turned off at intervals durine the morning and that the unfortunate victim of the accident knew ofthis fact. The last time the currentwas turned on it remained on for fullythree-quarters of an hour. WhenLuckett came in contact with the electric current 33,000 volts passed throughbis body.Notwithstanding the fact that thecurrent was sufficient to produce instant death he was kept alive by meansof artificial restoratives for two andI one-half hours, although he was in anunconscious condition during tne entire time.The first that was known of the accident was when workmen who were inthe same room were attracted by thearming of the wires and going to investigate found the body where it, had .fallen when touched by the live wire. Inthe room were four other workmen including the foreman of the electriciansengaged in installing the plant.Luckett was frightfully burned aboutthe body, his left hip and shoulderbearing evidence of the effect of thdeadly current while his face wasseared by the heat of the arcing wiresand in several places the skin .waibroken.Several persons who were in the vicinity stated the flash produced by thecontact could be seen for some distance from the power house.When the accident occurred Luckettwas engaged in sandpapering a panof thn brass work near the switch," themassivp. machinery obscuring him fromthe view ofhis fellow workmen.Immediately after the discovery ofthe accident was made by the companions.of the unfortunate man, Dhvsicians were summoned from this city,Drs. Fithian and Daugherty responding to the call and they administeredto his injuries until hissufferings wererelieved by death.The substation, wl ere the accidentoccurred does not belong to the Kentucky Traction and Terminal Co., asit has not vet been conmleted and! turned over by the General ElectricCo.Coroner Rudolph Davis went to thescene shortly after the death of Luckett and conducted the investigation,finding. the facts as above stated. Theremains were then removed to Lexington where Luckett had been boardingand his relativesjn Fhilade'nhia notified of his death! The body will besent to that city for interment.Fire, wind and lightning Insurance.
