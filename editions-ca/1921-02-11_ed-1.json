EOURBOtf FARM CONDITIONS
Tobacco markets continue to hold
the center of the stage for Bourbon
county favjrt&s Receipts continue
to be large at the local houses, while
prices are rather unsteady. A few
farmers are Iiolding their crop3 and
maintain they will use them for
fertilizer rather than vsacrifice them
at the prevailing low prices.
There is little other activity on
the farm, practically all the fann
er's time being put in on the strip-
ping and hauling of tobacco. A
very little land has been broken in
cases where the soil could be
plowed.
