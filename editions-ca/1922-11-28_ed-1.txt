Twofarmers fell out after a disputeover the ownership of a calf and-went -'to court. The case was"bitterly contested and was appealed from court to court until it went"to the Court of Appeals several"-times before it was finally decided.All the time the costs of the litigation piled up until they amounted"to over a thousand dollars, many-times the price of the calf that-caused the battle.It has often been said that, nothing has been devised that will pro--motemore trouble or bitter feeling"hetween the parties than a legalghtover a will.

'THE EOYAL SEBENADERS" ATPAEIS GRAND .THURSDAYThe Royal Serenaders will appear at The Paris Grand OperaHouse Thursday, Thanksgiving Day,matinee and night.This famous troup of entertainers will please you with theirsweet, weird and scintillatingmusic and songs of the HawaiianIslands. The native Hawaiian is amusician; this goes without question. Never did a people lend itselfto music more than does the nativeKanaka. He has a style of musictypical his own, and this style hehas developed until the repertoireof native airs is most extensive.Among the best known of all Hawaiian music is "Alalia Oai," andbecause of its wondrous sweetness,this air is familiar pretty much theworld over. The native adopts anykind of musical instrument, andsoon becomes adept on it. Theguitar and his own ukelele (whichmeans dancing flea) has made themusic of these islands familiar toall. For over forty years the RoyalHawaiian band has charmed the visitor to Honolulu, for they play concerts daily in various parts of thecity. This band was a play-thingof royalty in the days before thestars and stripes were raised overthe islands, but after the islandscame under the government of theUnited States of America, the bandwas kept, and to-day is one of theshow things of Honolulu. The peculiar sliding tone of the ukelelehas taken the world by storm, andyou can hear almost any familiartune rendered a la Hawaiian.This is the company that sets thestandard for Hawaiian music inAmerica. This company is an added attraction with the romanticplay "Under Hawaiian Skies,"which comes toParis so highly recommended. NUTS TOR LIVELIHOODThere is a belief that a large nutcrop is the sign of a hard Winterand if there is anything in the portent Kentucky is due for a long andsevere . winter. Reports from allover the State are that the nutyield is unusually large and 'thatthe walnut and hickory trees areloaded.Nutting is a popular autumn diversion and with an abundantyield there seems nothing to prevent a large supply for the wintermonths. Already the roofs of mostrural outhouses are laden with alayer of walnuts and hickory nutsundergoing the drying process preparatory to storing them for thewinter. Under the circumstancesthe rural small boy is in his element, making frequent incursionsinto the woods to augment his supply. The abundant yield has its commercial aspect. Crty dwellers, someof whom had almost forgotten thetaste of a walnut or hickory nut,may have the chance to obtain thenuts at a reasonable price, sincetheir rural cousins will have morethan they -can use and will shipthem to the city market.Pecans and filberts are grown inWestern Kentucky and in some ofthe purchase counties the shipmentof the nuts isa commercial venture.Fulton county pecans which aregathered in large quantities, rankhigh and command a good price inthe markets.GOVERNMENT AID PROPOSEDFOE PARKERSCreation of a corporation withgovernment-subscribed capital of$100,000,000 to buy and sell 'farmproducts was proposed for a secondtime in a bill introduced by Senator Norris, of Nebraska, chairmanof tHe - Senate Agricultural Committee. The measure is similar to one introduced by Senator Norris at thelast session which was rejected bythe Senate in favor of legislation toextend the life and farm loan powers of the War Finance Corporation. The new Norris bill would givethe corporation, with its directorateof the secretary of agriculture andtwo others appointed by the President, authority to acquire elevatorsand warehouses, to buy farm pro. ducts in the United States and sellthem either in this county orabroad, to advance funds for thesale or exportation of farm products and to operate uncharteredgovernment tonnage.WILL BE A LONG WAIT FOR,THANKSGIVINGChristmas shoppers will haveonly twenty days in which to getrid of their money after Thanksgiving this year the shortest timepossible with the modern calendar.""Turkey Day" came on November30, the last day of the month.Christmas Eve is one of the fourSundays in December before Christmas, and the result is the unusuallybrief shopping season.

BEADERToo many people seem to thinktheir duty of citizenship ends whenthey vote and obey the law. Havingput a man in office they stand atease until the next order comes toresume the political march. Unless there be a rapid awakening thetime is not far distant in this territory when an object lesson willforce the taxpayers to realize theymust be on the job and that theyare a part, in fact the most important part, of the government. Thelesson will come in the shortage ofcoal. We are basking now in theautumn, but it will not be long before the fires and furnaces will begoing full blast. Any thinkingman knows there will be a coalshortage. The conditions in thelocal coal yards are well known,and the increasing difficulty of obtaining fuel can be learned by anyone who cares to inquire. It thepeople had been alive to their dutythey would not to-day be caughtbetween the millstones, the coalbarons on the one hand and thelabor leaders on the other squeezing out their lives. The publiccould have ended the strike in shortorder. But the public remained indifferent. Warm weather was notime to get excited about a possiblecoal shortage. The coal baronshave not worried. They 'don't carewhether there is a shortage or not.They will arrange their output byfixing prices.Even to-day the individual remains apathetic. If every man andwoman were to write a letter toour Congressmen and to our twoUnited States Senators, particularlythe Congressmen, asking what stepsare being taken to protect his district and demanding that he seethat we obtain an adequate supplyof coal, something might be done.There are plenty of letters writtenfor free seeds. Why not a line onfair priced coal. Let our Congressman see we are on the job and thatwe exneet him tn do what he, nan tnprotect the people who sent him toCongress.. oCANNOT GIVE AWAY A DRINKThe final chapter in the move tomake the giving away of a drink ofintoxicating liquor an offense underthe 1920 prohibition law was written when Judge Gus Thomas in theCourt of Appeals overruled the motion of W. W. Simpson, of Butlercounty, for a rehearing of his case.Simpson was charged with givingaway a drink of liquor and the findings of the Butler Circuit Courtwhich declared the gift of a drinkof liquor a violation of the 1920prohibition law was sustained. Inthe 'motion for the rehearing Simpson asked for a modified opinionand this motion was dismissed alsoby Judge Thomas.oST. LOUIS PHYSICIANS ATTACKDRY LAWThe Volstead act was attacked as"provocative of disrespect for law,"as an "obnoxious invasion of theprerogative of physician" and asindirectly detrimental to the healthof users of alcohol by causing theconsumption of "deleterious concoctions and beverages." in a resolution adopted by the St. Louis Medical Society of Research in sessionat St. Louis.CAHAL BROS.BARBER SHOP4-WHITE BARBERS 4'Modem Equipment.Expert and Polite ServiceHOT AND COLD BATHSr2 DAYSMAREin which to pay CountyTaxes.

The party in power hasneglected its opportunity, falteredin the face of grave and pressingproblems, played fast and loosewith the veterans of the Great War,goose-stepped before organizedbands of noisy minorities, honeyfudged the pacifists, enacted a tariffbill that, as we have repeatedlysaid, is 'a disgrace to the Republican party and a menage to the Nation,' insulted the intelligence andinflamed the passion of the electorate in many v parts of the countryby appointments to office that areindefensible on any score for example E.

That Henry and I should be in Cincinnati at such atime seems almost an act of Providence.You know how men are in time of sickness try so hard to help theyget under foot. Henry's no exception. So I just shoo him out of the house inthe morning and look for him when it's time for supper.Yesterday was my birthday. Of course you knew it was or you wouldn'thave remembered me with such a beautiful gift.Henry says you don't know what you gave me, having sent the moneyon and told him to pick something out at Mabley's.He did. The mbst wonderful fitted bag you ever saw. Everything fromnail file to hair brush. My, I'll have to travel all the rest of my life withsuch a bag. You shouldn't have remembered me so much.Henry gave me an umbrella. He said he had a hard time selecting it atMabley's because every one they showed him seemed the "best. I just can'twait until it rains so I can use it.'When I came down to supper that night, I did have a surprise. -Thereon the table was a huge birthday cake with candles. Not one for every year,as it would have been all candles and no cake, but there were a plenty.Where the cake came from was beyond me as Cousin Sue was too sick to doany baking and I knew I hadn't made it myself.Where do you suppose it came from? From Mabley's Annex. Henrybought it.It does beat all what men can do when it comes to "women , shopping." Henry says that he didn't have an idea what to buy me when he wentdown street that morning. Crossing Fountain Square, he saw somewomen's hats in Mabley's window. That kind of brought to his mind thetime I spoiled mine when I was caught in a rain storm. "So," he said, "Ijust went into Mabley's and bought you an umbrella." Then he told thegirl it was for my birthdayand asked for other suggestions. He told herabout our trip here and that we were planning another trip this winter. Shewas real friendly, took him to the bag department and introduced him tothe clerk there. Before leaving she kind of hinted I might like a birthdaycake and that he could buy one in their Annex.Henry says : "It do beat all how friendly and helpful -Mabley's is to out-of-townfolks."Henry's going to write you soon and tell you all he's been doing whileI've been indoors.
