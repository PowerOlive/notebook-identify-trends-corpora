IN PARISIn Effort to Disperse the Troops ThatAre Now in the French CapitalDuke of OrleansParis Oct 15 A long andvaguesemi official statement appeared Friday evening suggesting various possible motives such as Dreyfusite intrigues or an attempt by the socialiststo frighten the government into dispersing the troops that now preventthe success of the strike toexplainthe rumors of a military conspiracyThe mysterious allusions howeverand the absence of any straightforward denial tend to encourage the belief that there must be some groundfor the rumors especially as the statement mentions

Debt While SurrenderingJ the Security to Pay ItLondon Oct 17 The Paris correspondent of the Times says Thepeace negotiations are necessarilyslow being- conducted less by exchangeof words than exchange of notes andstatements Senor Montero Riospresident of the Spanish commission-does not understand English Consequently the few words exchanged mustbe Interpreted and even then theyare definitive till committed to paperThe Cuban debt question has thusbeen laid on the table and the American commissioners had already givena peremptory refusal to discuss aprinciple which had becu settled asthey considered by the peace preliminaries Faithful to the attitudeadopted by them from the outset they-seemed resolved to take their stand onthe instructions or rather as I havealready said the precise and conciserorders which they brought withthem but the Spaniards on their sidelo not think themselves bound to bowwith docility to the imperative instructions of another governmentThey returned to the charge Saturday if I am well informed urging thegenerally admitted principle whichimposes on conquerors the burdens belonging to the territory conqueredeither in their own behalf or that oftheir clients They insisted that itwould be an extraordinary course tosaddle Spain already in so lamentable a financial position with the Cuban debt while surrendering to thevictor the security with which itshouldbe paidThej remarked according to myinformation that if they had askedthe United States for permission toraise interest out of the customs revenues they would naturally have metwith a refusal

special train consisting of onebox car three apparently emptycoaches and a caboose that passedthrough here at 525 Thursday eveningbore two car loads of Negroes takenthrough here to Springfield Wednesdaj The train went south and by aclever ruse succeeded in passingthrough Virden quietly and withoutinterference A bisr crowd of minerswas at the station but the militia heldthem in checkWhen the train stopped at the stockade Capt Fevier who was in command then shouted Dont allowany one to disembark from that trainThe gate was opened and a file ofsoldiers rushed out on the double quickwith fixed bayonets and lined up alongside of the train General ManagerLukens made a formal request thattheir emplo3es be allowed to landand enter the stockade Capt Fevier declined to grant this Then Lukens putit in the form of a demand but the officer replied that he was under ordersfrom Gov Tanner to prevent the disembarking of any Negro miners at theworks and he would have to carry outthose instructions General ManagerLukens protested in vain and thetrain pulled out headed southBy this time the advance guard ofstrikers gathered at the depot had advanced up the track to within 100yards of the stockade The presenceof armed blue coats in the lookoutboxes evidently halted them as theyremained there until the train passedwhen they greeted it with wavinghats and cheers for Gov Tanner

the name of international law that the debt shouldnot rest solely on Spanish shouldersIt is impossible to foretell the American reply but it is not likely that MrDay and his colleagues will yield Anidea is afloat and said to be warmly-advocated by the friends of peace andjustice that the interest should be reduced 2K per cent or even to 3 percent and jointly guaranteed by theSpaniards and the future rulers ofCuba each thus bearing only a veryslight burden and the bondholders being protected from loss on their investment This last information doesnot emanate either from Spaniards

belongingto the class of water borne affections In other words it is believedthat the germs of such diseases arecarried and perhaps propagated inwater There is little doubt that thistheory of typhoid fever is correctand that in tracing any extended epidemic of the disease to its source wemust first of all examine into the condition of the water supplyDrinking water has been proved tobe the cause of the spread of typhoidfever in many epidemics in this country and England but there is littlecomfort in this for those who habitually drink something stronger than water because although during an epidemic the drinking water may be madesafe by boiling this is not enoughIf the water is contaminated thegerms may be Introduced into the bodywhile brushing the teeth or washingthe face Or again salads and fruitswhich are eaten raw may be contaminated by the water in which they arcwashed Tjplioitl fever has sometimesbeen spread in a city whose water supply was above reproach by means ofmilk or iceMilk need not be watered in order tobecome a vehicle for typhoid germsthe germs may be introduced into cansand bottles while these are beingwashed in water drawn from a conlaminated well or brook at the airyAlthough destroyed by boiling typhoid germs will resist a freezing temperature for a long time and havebeen found in ice cut from a pond poisoned with sewage containing thebacilli of this diseaseAnother means of the spread of typhoid has recentlj been discovered in03sters Oystermen frequently placeoysters in brackish water near themouth of a creek or river in order tofatten them before them are broughtto market If this place happens tobe near the mouth of a sewer containing typhoid poison or if the creek water be contaminated the oysters willtake the virus within their shells andso revenge themselves on those whoeat them rawIn some puzzling cases of typhoidit has been supposed that the food jwas infected by flies which had car-ried the germs a long distance on theirfeet a strong argument for the proper care of food in the fly seasonThese are only a few of the waysin which this disease may be spreadbut they are enough to show that soiar from feeling surprise that the disorder should be so common we mayrather wonder that we are not all itsvictims Youths CompanionPAID HER FRIENDShe Owed Her a Good TurnPromptly Sijnared

secured her invitation by telling MrsGrafton she had never really cared forMerriam Capt Grafton when he learnedof the proposed visit vainly objectedCHAPTER VII ContinuedPor the life of him Capt Graftoncould not but feel that he had beentricked and deceived and yet so plausible were the explanations he couldnot brush them entirely aside Atall events he would not now requirehis wife to recall the invitationsent and accepted It might even beas she claimed that Fan loved andclung to her as her only dear and intimate friend and craved her societyand sympathy now in her bereavementand ill health and though still suspicious and ill satisfied he gave his reluctant assent to the plan and was onhand at the junction to meet and welcome his unwelcome guestThe Merriarns had been paying a holiday visit to Floys devoted parents atthe cantonment and were absent fromSedgwick while these preliminarieswere being arranged Otherwise Grafton might have cast conventionalityaside and asked Randy for the truthabout those alleged lovely times whenthey were on their wedding journeybut he could not brinjr himself towrite and indeed there was no time forletters to go and come and decide an issue that was already decided It wasMrs Grafton who two days before thearrival of her lovely guest broke thenews of her coming to Mr Merriam andwas astonished at his reception thereofIt was almost sunset of one of thosesoft languorous southern days thatmake even midwinter warm and grateful in the lower valley of the BravoAcross the barren level of the paradethe Aroopers were marching up fromstables in their -white frocks and sending long shadows striding up the opposite eastward slope of the narrow canyon The officers iu parties of three orfour were strolling homeward past thenow shaded porticoes on many ofwhich seated with their needlework orchatting with friends the ladies of thegarrison were awaiting the coming oftJieir lords or lovers or both Thesmooth broad walks were bright withgroups of merry children or sedatelytrundled baby carriages Three or fourof the bigger boys were galloping theirponies along the roadway freshsprinkled by the hug water cart Theband that had been playing- in Its kioskiu front of the line had picked up itsmusic books and gone trudging barrackward for change of raiment beforeparade skirting on the way the circularplat of withered grass maintained atvast expenditure of labor and water atthe foot of the stall from whose shimmering peak hung well nigh motionless the blue and scarlet and white ofthe national flag Northwestward thedistant line of the Mescalero stood blueblack against the cloudless sky Awayto the east rolled the dun billows ofthe Jornada illimitable in monotonyand range Downward at the ford ofthe San Mateo some Indian boys andgirls were jabbering shrill expostulation to the Mexican- herder who wasswearing strange oaths at his usuallyplacid burros beeause they had thegood manners to shrink at the edgeof the stream wherein these childreivofnature were disporting the laughterand screaming even the splashing ofthe water rising distinctly on the airOut on the mesa to the north the quartermasters herd was nodding slowlysleepily homeward powdered by adustcloud of its own raising and over at theinfantry barracks at the westward- emdof the long line scores of the men werealready out in full dress uniformawaiting the bugle call that should de-mand The assembly Mrs Grafton hadbeen visiting up the row and was coming smilingly back nodding greetingand salutation to the ladies on theverandas of the various quarters as shepassed

naturally a comfort to the lookers on along the quarters and when Randy lifting his capwould have deserted them and gone hisway she was just coquette enough tocare to hold the exhibition and her

Whittakerten minutes later and learned from himthat the Graftons expected a guestfrom the east on Saturday Mrs McLaneAnd Saturday evening she eirae almost at the same hour at which sliefirst set eyes on that dreary landscapeand wondered what was the name othose far blue hills and who those officers and ladies could be But this timeit was the train from the northeastihatboreherin and itscompanion

could not fail tonote it No sign of dust and grime oftravel was there The shroudingprotecting veil and duster had been discarded only just before they reachedthe station Annette had stowed themcarefully away in the shawl strap whileher bereaved mistress carefully andskillfully arrayed herself in veil andbonnet that had been boxed throughout the journey She stepped forthinto Harrietswelcoming arms as trimas though she herself had just issuedfrom a bandbox herjoy at being oncemore with such fond friends decorouslytemperedby the sense of her ever-presentall pervading sorrow and the consciousness of her delicate and uncertainhealth Only a moment did she allowherself in Harriets embrace No timemust be lost in precipitating herselfupon the massive and not too

and her own needsof some strong arm on which to leanshe might even be glad to find shelterthereThere was always something so appealing about Fanv said Mrs Graftonsometimes and indeed there wasAnd then the train moved on andGrafton looked grimly at the stack ofSaratogas up the platform while theorderly was loading bags baskets andbundles into the roomy Concord wagonand the quartermasters team came

or bright or cheerful or athousand other things We do notstop to think that while perhaps wedo not think her so very pretty as wehave heard we do think her prettyand again if not very clever

corner in thegreat public library yet it has conferred happiness on a great many Chicagoans who are afflicted with the lossof sight It contains the books forthe blind The first collection of thesebooks was a private undertaking ofa West side Avoman who has sincedied In August 1893 the works wereturned over to the public library andNovember 2G 1S97 a special room wasset aside for them in the new building Since that time a few moretimes have been donated This collection is not as well known as the au- jthorities would desireHere may be seen the three well-known systems for the blind the oldMoon and the new Moon then comesthe New York point which is of much Jlater date and is somewhat similar tothe Braille system yet a vast improvement on it in many ways There are iscarcely more than 30 readers andonly 14 regular ones On the application of an ordinary library ticket thebooks are sent to the outlying stations with the proviso they are to bekept but two weeks and cannot be re- inewed It is interesting to note that Ithe old people are inclined to use theMoon system while the younger prefer the New York point Children distinguish the lines easily by touchand those who have become blind byaccident invariably adopt the lattermethodThere is quite a promising boy ofabout 12 who comes to read regularlytwice a week He always carries hisviolin case with him so supposedly heis

knows how I dont careif it is a trifle smeared Hes gettingjoy solid joy thicker than the painton his hands and clothesTheres a mean side to it too Hewanted to paint the fence and I wantedthe weeds pulled out of the yard Solike an underhanded rascal I bargainedwith him I told him that if he wouldpull all the weeds out I would let himpaint the fence He went through theother job like a soldier he

father-in-lawstent and the ceremony but forthe running of the bride from one tentto another is complete Perhaps thepurest symbolical act is that of theTransylvanian Saxon bridal pair whostep over the threshold with their handstied together Some of these Transylvanian customs are remarkable andmust be survivals from a very ancientperiod The bridegroom never wearsthe shirt made for him by the bride
