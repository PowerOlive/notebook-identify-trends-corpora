The entire section of the Ameri

Leland Standard University last Feb
ruary is cited by General Mangin
in orders to the division.
The citation of the section is mad

its arrival at the front an example

JORDAN.
Maida Jordan, aged fourteen,
daughter of Mr. and Mr. Daniel Jor
dan, of Eighth street, died at the St.
Joseph Hospital, in Lexington, at
eleven o'clock yesterday morning,
from the after-effects of an operation
performed in that institution for ap
pendicitis.
The little girl manifested symp
toms of the disease a day or so ago,
but it was not thought she was in a
serious condition until Saturday,
when she was taken to the Lexington
institution. An operation was per
formed Saturday night, but the
young patient's system could not ral
ly from the shock of the operation,
which together with her weakened
condition, brought death in its wake.
The little girl was one of the most
lovable girls in the city, the light of
her parents household, and her sud
den death and untimely passing away
will leave an aching void in their
hearts and a vacant place in the
home. She was of a bright, sunny
disposition, and made friends of
everyone. The sympathy of the com
munity goes out to the parents in
their affliction. She is survived be
sides her parents, by one brother.
The body was brought to the
stricken home in the Davis ambu
lance yesterday afternoon, and pre
pared for burial.
The funeral will be held at the
Catholic church at nine o'clock to
morrow (Wednesday) morning, with
services conducted by Rev. Father
Eugene DeBruyn. The burial will
follow on the family lot in the
Catholic Cemetery.
The pall-bearers will be the follow
ing young friends of the deceased:
John Walsh, Ralph Connell, Lauth
man Woods, W. G. Mitchell, Reginald
Kilkenney and Francis O'Rourke.

OBERDORFER
k AfMtt far Burbon County
(July 6-lm)
Restrictions on importations of po
tatoes into the United States from
Canada and Bermuda was removed
after July 1 under an amendment to
regulations of the Federal Horticul
tural Board, signed recently by the
Secretary of Agriculture. The amend
ment also permits the importation of
potatoes from any foreign country
into Hawaii for local use only.
The ruling in regard to Bermuda
and Canada is based on the fact that
inspection of potatoes imported from
those two countries during the last
three years has shown that no seri
ous potato diseases not already occur-.
ring in the United States exist in
those regions.
Potatoes for local consumption ar
to be allowed to enter Hawaii from
any country, since few potatoes are
grown on the islands, and there ii
therefore little danger of diseases
damaging local truck crops. All ship
ments of potatoes arriving in Hawaii,
however, still will be inspected be
fore they can be removed from the
docks.
The quarantine against potatoes
from Newfoundland and the islands
of St. Pierre and Miquelon, on ac
count of the potato-wart disease, re
mains in full force and effect.
TODD CRAFT.
Miss Emma Johnson Todd and
Mr. Robert Craft, both of the North
Middletown vicinity, were married at
the residence of the officiating minis
ter, Rev. I. J. Spencer, in Lexington,
recently.
The bride is a daughter of Mrs. J.
K. Todd, who resides on the Plum
Lick pike, near North Middletown,
and the groom is a son of Mr. and
Mrs. J. T. Craft, of the same neigh
borhood. Mr. and Mrs. Craft will
reside with the groom's parents on
their farm on the Prescott pike.
HUNTER WOLCOTT.
Friends and relatives of Miss
Hallie Hunter and Mr. Fred Wolcott,
both members of prominent Winches
ter families, were greatly surprised
to receive telegrams and telephone
messages Saturday night from them,
stating they had been married in
Louisville late that evening.
The bride, who is a daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. Hubert Hunter, of Win
chester, has been a frequent visitor in
Paris, as a guest of the family of Mr.
and Mrs. T. T. Templin, of South
Main street. The groom is a member
of the Wolcott Milling Co., one o!
Winchester's most substantial indus
tries. He is also well known in Paris
in both social and business circles.
Mr. Wolcott called at the home of
Miss Hunter, Saturday "afternoon,
stating that they would attend the
local moving picture show. From
Winchester they motored to Louis
ville, where the ceremony was per
formed. There was no parental ob
jection to the marriage of the young
people, but they preferred to use their
own pleasure in the matter of the
time, the place and the means to the
end in view.
After a short bridal trip to points
of interest and a visit to friends in
Louisville, Mr. and Mrs. Wolcott re
turned to Winchester, where they
.will reside at the groom's home.

BIRTHS.
i
Inhabitants of Nayon, France, no
longer have any doubt as to the
fate of the bells and chimes of
Northern France. Following those
in Belgium, they have taken the road
to German munition factories.
All the churches of the region of
the Oise and the Somme were stripped
of everything they contained in the
form of copper and brass before the
occupying troops retired. There ir
no reason to suppose that those still
inside the German lines have been
spared.
These depredations are actually
felt in this region, which has been
the country of bells and chimes since
Charlemagne generalized their use
throughout the empire.
Inhabitants of this region who
were deported to Germany before the
retreat and have since been repatri
ated bring news that the Germans
have now attempted to "regularize"
their rape of the bells by issuing a
general "requisition" of all bells not
dating as far back as the Middle
Ages. Bells cast between 1400 and
1800 are spared only when they bear
historical inscriptions or have other
wise an exceptional value historical
ly or artistically. Since few of the
bells of Northern France have the
necessary antiquity to escape thu
legulation, it is assumed that all, or
nearly all, of them have already been
fired back upon French soil in the
form of projectiles.
Most of the really ancient bells of
France were destroyed during the
revolution.

CENSORSHIP BY DIVINE RIGHT.
Inasmuch as Congress has not
passed a censorship law the proceed
ings at Washington are well nigh in -comprehensible.
Dispatches are di
verted from addresses to the War De
partment where they have been ed
ited. This seems a strange exer
cise or assumption of authority in
America. It is stated that this gov
ernment is corforming in the main
to censorship rules in the European
countries. Censorship in England is
a notorious failure as a war aid.
Lord Northcliffe, who ought to
know, has been in America warning
this country against its adoption J
Yet the department at Washington
takes charge of the news and ef
fects censorship without any enact
ment looking to its creation.

(Wall Street Journal.)
In a group of out-of-town bankers,
who were making an inspection of
the spacious banking room of the
National City Bank recently, a man
from Suffolk, Va., startled some of his
colleagues of this and other cities by
a statement to the effect that what is
properly known as the "Peanut
Bank" is probably the most prosper
ous institution in this country. He
likewise stated positively that th.
"Peanut Bank" has yielded a larger
return on the money invested than
any other banking concern on this
continent.
The "Peanut Bank" is officially
known as Farmers' Bank of Nanse
mond, and owes its great prosperity
to the peanut. It is located in Suf
folk, Va., the center of a district
where the goober flourishes as no
where else in America. The bank
started in 1869, with a capital of
$20,000, which has never been
changed. The men who own its 200
shares of stock have been made rich,
for the reason that the $100 shares
have a value well in excess of $5,000
each, and none offering for sale. It
has a surplus and undivided profits
of $1,000,000, loans in excess of $2,
00,000, and cash in values and du
from other banks usually amount to
$1,000,000 of thereabouts. It is said
that there never was such a bank
for melon cutting. Dividends come
at frequent and irregular intervals
and range from 5 per cent, or 10 per
cent, to 100 per cent, or more. Once
upon a time for some reason not
specified, the bank startled the stock
holders and natives with a 99 per
cent, distribution.
The nearest approach in stock
value and dividends is the Fifth Ave
nue Bank of New York City, whose
$100 shares have a market value of
about $4,600.
