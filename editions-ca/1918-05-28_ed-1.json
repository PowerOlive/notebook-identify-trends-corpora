PATRIOT DOLLARS.
All the dollars in the world can
not buy victory. Victory is not pur
chasable it is won. Dollars can
work for victory only in so far as
they are converted into labor and
materials. A dollar hoarded is a
slacker; a dollar wasted is a traitor;
a dollar saved is a patriot, doubly
so when loaned to the Government.
A hoarded dollar represents idle
power; a wasted dollar represents
wasted power; a dollar saved repre
sents power saved, labor saved repre
sents power saved. Loaned to your
Government, it represents power,
labor and materials in action, on the
firing line, over the top. And more
it represents reserve power, energy
stored, purchasing power conserved
for its owner.
