VELVET, THE ERIENDLY TOBAC
CO HOME AGAIN.
Velvet Tobacco, in its jolly red tin,
is again a feature of cigar stores, big
and little. There is again Velvet in
the pipes, and contentment in the
hearts of an army of American pipe
smokers. And thereby hangs a tale.
"Where's Velvet Tobacco gone?"
those same folks inquired, when dis
appointed in their quest for that age
mellowed, friendly tobacco, which
had made them and their pipes side
partners for years.
Where was Velvet? Ask the Red
Cross man or the "Y" man. Ask the
Salvation Army lassies. Ask the hur
ried and harrassed Quartermaster
Corps that were responsible for
"more beef, more bullets and more
tobacco" for the boys under the tin
derbies. Yes, that's why Velvet was
not on some of the dealers' shelves.
It was on the ships, in the canton
ments, in the billets and the trench
es. But Velvet is now wearing the
red chevron of an honorable dis
charge. The doughboy who smoked the
"tinned Kentucky sunshine" in
France, can now enjoy its friendly
company on his own front porch.
Those of us who willingly gave up
luxuries that the boys over there
might have them, can stuff our old
pipes once more with Velvet and
"smile, smile, smile."
And good old Velvet Joe! Well,
he's back in the columns of this pa
per and glad to see you ail again.

DEATHS.
DETWILLER.
Following a comparatively short
illness of uraemic poisoning. Mr. A.
Detwiller, aged about sixty-six, one
of the best-known residents of North
Middletown, died at his home in that
city Wednesday afternoon at two
o'clock. Previous to his last illness
Mr. Detwiller had been in active
health and had been able to attend to
his business. He had been a resident
of North Middletown for the larger
part of his life, and by economy, in
dustry and thrift had built up a bus
iness of large proportions.
Mr. Detwiller in the course of his
business experience became known
to all the people of his vicinity as a
model of mental industry and was
strictly honest in the service he ren
dered. He commanded the respect of
all classes and sects of people, as
was attested by the large attendance
at his funeral held yesterday after
noon. He was an honorable gentle
man in the highest sense that the
term implies. It was perfectly nat
ural for him to do right. To man,
woman or child, saint or sinner, he
always extended a cordial greeting
that lent a ray of light to brighten
their pathway in the journey of life.
He was a devoted husband and a
kind and indulgent father, and to all
his friends he was the soul of friend
ship. But the greatest of all he was
a man. And as a man it is that those
svjio knew him best most love to con
template him.
Besides his widow, Mr. Detwiller is
survived by three daughters, Mrs.
Roy Domigan, of Clark county; Miss
Daisy Detwiller, a member of the
Paris High School faculty, and Miss
Josephine Detwiller, a teacher in
the schools of the county, and one
son, Mr. Allie Detwiller, who has
lately returned from the army ser
vice. Mr. Detwiller was one of the most
prominent members of the Masonic
fraternity in the county, and stood
high in the councils of that order.
He was a member of the Couer de
Lion Commandery No. 26, Knights
Templar, of this city, and was always
devoted to the best interests of the
order.
The funeral was held yesterdav af
ternoon at four o'clock, with services l
at the grave in the North Middle
town Cemetery, conducted by the
members of Couer de Lion Command
ery, Knights Templar, of Paris. The
active pall-bearers were: S. E. An
derson, E. K. Thomas, H. C. Smith,
M. H. H. Davis, Joe H. Ewalt. Sam
K. Veatch; Honorary pall-bearers:
May (rolf, W. T. Buckner. Jno. T. Col

Luther and Sallie Hornback Ash
craft, of this city. He accompanied
the Barrow Unit on its trin to En?-
land, and was mustered out of the
service on April 19. On his arrival
home he became very ill with ton
silitis. It was thought that his con
stitution had become undermined by
the foggy clmate of England, and
that the seeds of disease thus sown
resulted later in tonsilitis, and then
pneumonia. Drs. David and Wool-,
folk Barrow were consulting physici
ans at his bedside, and everything
that medical science could do was
done to save the young man's life,
but to no avail.
He is survived by his mother, Mrs.
Sallie Hornback Ashcraft; two broth
ers, Joseph and A. D. Ashcraft; three
sisters, Mrs. L. H. Insko, of Jeffer
son county, Mrs. James H. Cheppell

Where Beauty and Economy Reign
Salvation Army were admirably se
lected; their service was one of great
devotion; its spirit was always on the
broadest humanitarian basis and the
work of the army was affectionately
and enthusiastically received by the
soldiers, so that the whole relation
ship between the Salvation Army and
the American Expeditionary Force
was characterized by a splendid
spirit of helpfulness out of which an
incalculable amount of relief, com
fort, sympathy and happiness was
derived by our soldiers. The Salva
tion Army is entitled to have it3
friends know both the devotion it
has shown and the success with
which its ministry has been at
tended." The people of Kentucky outside of
Louisville and Jefferson county, who
already have given liberally in a
successful campaign, will have the
opportunity to aid in this noble work
the week of June 23 to 30. An or
ganization is now being effected and
many of the counties already are act
ively at work.
