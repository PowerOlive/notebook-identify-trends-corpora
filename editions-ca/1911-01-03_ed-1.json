News in Millersburg.
Miss Nellie Shea, aged 25 years,
diejl Saturday morning at 2:45 o'clock
after a protracted illness of nearly 4
years of tuberculosis. For 3 years she
was day operator of the Bourbon
Home Telepnone Co., faithful in the
dsirharge of her duty and a favorite
with all the subscribers. She was at
bright and attractive lady with a
pleasant word and a sweet smile for
everyone.
In August of 1907 she went into a
decline and was compelled to give up
her duties, since then she has fought
brav ly, this most dreaded of all dis
eases. Adhering a'most strictly to the
open air treatment she unquestionably
prolonged her life far beyond what it
would have been. By nature she was
stronz and fiv years ago she looked
the oicture of heal h. Contsant, hard
w ij k en tie swithboard and a severe
cold in the spring of 1907 was the be
ginning of this sad story, however, for
the greatest part of more than three
years she has been a comfortable inval
id and at one time it looked as though
she might be able to master the dis
ease. In tie summers of 1908-9 she would
spe d almost the entire day out of
door3. She loked healthy and gained
rapidly in weight. Since last August
she hss gone gradually into a decline
and since eaTly in Septebmer has been
strictly confined to her bed. During
fach of the Christmas holidays since
he. illnes3 she has been well remem
bered by a multitude of friends.
Se was one of our most popualr girls
an I her protracted illness has created
a profound sympathy for both she and
her family. Since Tuesday she has
been c mscious only at int. vals, talk
ing at random. Fridav afternoon
about 5 o'clock she became speechless
and frra that time on until death
calimed her as his precious victim she

Sacred Service at Christan
Church.
On Sunday 'night at the Christian
church after the opening devotional
exercises Elder Morgan omitted the
3ermon and afcer a few introductory
remarks the evening was devoted to
the rendition of one of the most beau
tiful sacred cantatas ever written,
"The Angelic Choir,"
Under the difcetion of the choirh-
ter, Mr. Albeit H. Morehead, the
choir did excellent work and showed
ihe result of splendid training and
faithful practice.
The first number, "Hark, What
Muic Fill3 the Sky," was arranged
for women's chorus, solo and mixed
chorus, and was well sung. Next
came "There Came Three Kings,"
sung by Mr. Chas. Hill and a male
quartet consisting of Messrs. More
head, Bernaugh, Lancaster and Clark,
was so exquisite tnat the congrega
tion would have been glad to have it
repeated. The recitative "And There
Were Three Shepherds," was sung
by Mr. Hill, whose fine voice was
heard to great advantage in this work.
The chorus, "Good Tidings of Great
Joy," was followed by a recitative,
sung by Mrs. J. W. Longan. Mrs.
Longan sung this as well as a solo
with chorus later in the cantata in
most musicianly style and she was
showered with compliments on her fine
singing.
One of the finest parts ot the can
tata was the chorus "Bethlehem,"
which was sung with delicacy and
precusr in by the choir.
Mrs. Fanniebelle Sutherland was the
soprano soloist of the evening and
especially pleasing was her interpreta
tion of Mary's Manger Song, "Sleep,
My Little Jesus."
Unfortunately the male quartette" All
my Heart, this Night Rejoices," had
to be omitted andthe poem was ex
quisitely read by Wilder Morgan.
The closing chorus, "Hail to the
Lord's Annointed," was most brilliant
ly sung and was a fitting close of an
evening's deotional song service.
The distribution of papers, on which
the words of the cantata were present
ed, added greatly to the enjoyment.
The cantata was followed by a short
baptismal service.

hear of for my cough, and was under
the treatment of the best doctor in
Georgetown, S. C, for a year, but

Negro Killed bv Interurban Car.
Great excitement was caused on a
Georgetown interubran car Sunday
night when an unkniwn negro deliber
ately cast himself in front of its
wheels, the body being completely Vut
in two by tbem. The car was crowd
ed, returning from Georgetown, two
ladies being among the passengers,
and there was a near-par ic among
them when it was learned that the car
had run down a man. The orcurance
took place at Greendale and the uni
dentified body was carried to Porter &
Jackson's undertaking establishment.
The negro got on the car at Lexing
ton and wanted to go to Georgetown,
but only had money enough to ride as
far as Greendale. He was put off
there by Conductor Caylor, and was
seen standing on the track by Motor
man Sayers when the car returned to
Greendale. The motorman attempted
to stop the swiftly moving, car, and
applied the emergencv brakes, seeing
the negro would be struck. The
tracks were slippery owing to the re
cent rain, and i'lst as the neero was
reached he was seen to throw himself '
in front of the wheels.
Counties About Evenly Divided.
Reports from Bath, Jessamine, An
derson, Madison. Lincoln. Clark, K.en
ton, Campbell. Scott, Woodford,
Grant, Carter. Garrard Montgomery
Owen. Boyle, Mason, Franklin ana
Henry counties were received baturaay
night and all told of the selection en
delegates to the big tcbacco meeting
in Lpxington except in Woodford Jes
samine Franklin and Scott iwhere so
little interest was taken or there wb&
suc.i a misunderstanding of dates tor
the meeting that none were held.
Many of the counties reporting Sat
urday declared in their resolutions for
a cut-out of the 1911 crop ; others for a
pool in 1911 and a cut-out in 1912. One
county declared for a six-year pool
with as many cut-outs as market coi.
ditions seemed to indicate.
Of the counties so far reporting
about favor a 1911 cut-out with a 1912
pool and the other half have declared
fora 1911 pool with a 1912 cut-out.
It will be the object of the Lexington
meeting of January 5, to harmoize
these different views. Several coun
ties at which meetings were held Sat-
I urday sent their delegates uninstruc

MRS. FISKE.
One of the greatest triumphs in
stage direction that this country has
seen was scored by Mr. and Mrs.
Fiske in the famous ball room scene
in "Becky Sharp," when originally
presented in New York.
The entire production was a start
ling demonstration of the realization of
a play from manuscript. Much was
expected of the great scene depiciting
the Duchsss of Richmond's ball on the
eve of the battle of Waterloo owing to
the fixed place it holds in historical
literature, but the realty far exceeds
the expectation, but the poduction was
found to oe filled with surprises in its
accurracies realism and the thrilling
nature of its cilmax. This scene will
always remain a stage novelty, con
taining as it does a most picturesque
set of costumes, a host of people, all
the glamour of a great mill tray func
tion and that thrilling appealwhich ac
companies the tense presence of in -pending
danger. "Becky Sharp" wi:l

Fiske and the Manhattan Company at

FRANCES WILSON.
The comedy scenes between Francis
Wilson and Baby Davis in Mr. Wil
son's own comedy, "Tne Bachelor's
Baby," are reported to be nothing
short of delicious. In his nev play,
Mr. Wilson nas the role of i crusty
bachelor who is left the guardianship
of his brother's little daughter. His
disliko tor children is extreme and he
does his best to devise some scheme to
ret rid of the little one. But that wa
uefore he saw her and before he fell
captive to he childish charms, for the
little one ends by twisting him com
pletely around hei little finger and
when one tries to take her from him,
he tights lke a tiger to retain his po
session. Bright lines, delightful situ
ations, most of which are highly amus
ing and pathos and comedy skillfully
blendedmake "The Bachelor's Baby"
one of the biggest successes in the
decaed. Charles Frohman presents
Francis Wilson with an exceptionally
strong supporting company in "The
Bachelor's Baby," at the Lexington

New Trial ia Ttbacco Cases.
In the United States Court in Cov
ington Judge A. M. J. Cochran handed
down an opinion in the celebrated
night riuer case of W. s. Henderson
against sundry citizens of Bracken
county, overruling the motion fur a
new trial in part and sustaining it in
part.
About 150 men surrounded the tobac
co warehouseof Henderson in Augus
ta, it was claimed, and by angry talk
and demonstration demanded tnat he
sign a contract not to buy any more
tabacco Henderson testified that they
laid hands on him and threatened to
throw him into the river if he refused.
He signed. The crowd then visited
ethers, it is charged, and required
them to sign, and forced one 'Reynolds
Hook to the river's edge oefore he
would sign. Henderson received a
j:... - oe nnn r. , .
veruiui. xiji. u,wu against aoout a
dozen defendanis,all he cnuk1 identify.
In the trial evidence was admitted
as to the sets of the mob in forcing
others to sign 'after leaving Hender
son. Judge Cochran holds that evi
dence was competent, but finds that
the plaintiff tailed to prove that ail
the defendants against whom he re
covered a verdict continued with the
mob after it left him.
For that reason he orders a new
trial as to the defendants, Charles
Pickerell. James Stone, Paul Ger
hard, William Kurtz and Vachel Jor
dan, and as to all the other defendants
the motion is overruled on condition
that the plaintiff reduce the amount
of the veidict from $6,000 to $5,000
the court saying that while he did not
wish to invade the province of the
jury in fixing the amount of the dam
age, "I will feel better satisfied if
they are somewhat less."
This case was tried twice. The first
jury was composed in part of members
of the Society of Equity, and returned
a verdict of $250. Judge Cochran set
aside this verdict, holding that he had
probably erred in permitting these in
terrsted parties to sit on the jury.
He then ordered a jury sumoned from
non-tobacco producing counties, which
returned the $6,000 verdict".
