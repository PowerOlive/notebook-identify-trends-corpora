We have examined anumber of witnesses and from our personal knowledge find that a large percent, of our turnpikes are in a deplorable condition. Some of these havehad practically no repairs made uponthem for the past two or three years."We have compared' our turnpikeswith the turnpikes of other countieshaving practically the same road fundper mile available and find that thefiscal courts and supervisors of thesecounties have been able to keep theirroads in satisfactory condition andthat their condition is strong evidencethat there is something greatly atfault with the manner in which, themoney of our county is expended andthe work done upon the roads. Weare thoroughly convinced from theevidence at hand that these conditionsare caused by the neglect of the Fiscal Court and Road Supervisors. Wefind that practically no attention isgiven to the condition of the roads orto the manner of their up-keep by theFiscal Court or the Road Supervisors."Again we find that some of theroads of the county have been shownpreference over other roads in thecounty in regard to. the amount ofmon'ey expended for their up-keep andrepair. We' find no justifiable reasonfor this. We find that the Road Supervisors give a very small part oftheir time and practically no personalsupervision to the work on the roads."We have asked for a report fromthe Supervisors some days ago, showing the amount of money expendedupon each road of the county, butwe have been unable to get in timeto embody it in this, our final report.We recommend that in the futurethe Road Supervisors be required togive their full time and personal attention to their" offices and to the careof our roads so that the tax-payers ofour county ,may be assured that fullvalue is received for the money expended from the road fund."In justice to the tax-payers of ourcounty we respectfully ask that thisreport be fully published in a" prominent place in our county newspapersand also that the report of the Supervisors in regard to the amount ofmoney expended upon each road in thecounty be also published when it finally appears."Every Democrat of Bourbon Countybefore he decides how to cast his votenext Saturday and before he endorses.Judge Dundon's administration shouldcarefully reflect upon the report ofthe Grand Jury of Bourbon County.Read it before you go to the polls onSaturday morning.

Steele, Extr.-..PlaintiffVs. NOTICE OF SALEBailey Arkle, &c. - - - DefendantLexington, Ky. (Special.) Out ofevery hundred deaths in the state ofKentucky thirty-nine are preventable,says the Kentucky Tuberculosis Commission. And what is a preventabledisease? It is one which is directly orindirectly spread from one person suffering ivith it to others. We knowwhat most of these diseases in Kentucky are, viz., consumption, pneumonia, typhoid fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria, malaria, whooping-cough,measles, smallpox, cerebro-spinal meningitis, syphilis, and gonorrhoea. Eachof these diseases is caused by thegrowth in the body of a tiny organism,commonly called a germ. These germscan not be seen by the naked eye, butunder the microscope the shapes,characteristics and habits of most ofthem have been studied, so that theyare now as well known to physiciansas are those of human beings or domestic animals. The eggs of hookworms are also transmitted from person to person, but in this case the fullgrown organism can plainly be seenby the naked eye. Since we knowhow these diseases are transmitted,it is perfectly possible, when peopleaid the doctors, to prevent theirspread.FRESH AIR!Bourbon LaundryDWIS & FUNK, Props.Telephone No. 4.

Few thingshave such a destructive effect on mostdisease germs, after they leave thebody, as a slow, steady draft of freshair. For instance, the germs of consumption will be killed by it in lessthan twenty-four hours. Consideringthe number of people moving aboutand spreading the germs of consumption,' it is lucky for us all that the)fresh air keeps so steadily and effec-,tively at work. Fresh air is also, by jlong odds, the most important factor iin the cure of consumption. Thesteady breathing of fresh air twentyfour hours a day, regardless of theweather, will do more to produce acure than any other single thing. Theconstant supply of fresh air, purgingthe body of impurties, keeps the machinery of the body literally in "goodfighting trim," and, at the same, time,slowly and surely kills the germs ascast off.Kentucky Tuberculosis Commission.A Burning Successis the coal from our yards.

Thisis the way a great many people account for every case of the disease.It the parents did not have it, sometimes it is maintained that the diseasewas transmitted by inheritance fromsome more distant ancestor. This isall nonsense. The new-born baby ofconsumptive parents is not affectedwith the disease. However, -when acase of consumption in the family isbeing ignorantly or carelessly handledat home, it is perfectly possible for alittle child to be infected at any timeafter-birth. That, however, is not inheritance; a healthy adopted babywould suffer the same fate. It doesnot matter even if all of your relativesdied of consumption, you need not necessarily travel the same dreary road.If you will live as much as possible inthe open air, eat plenty of simple, wellcooked foods, and no other, exercise,bathe and sleep regularly, and consultyour physician as soon as you seem tobe breaking down, there is no reasonwhy you should die of consumption.Kentucky Tuhrr.ulnc;f: Commission.ASK THE FARMERwho has one, what wonders the Cumberland Tell5 &?' ephone works for him.

A patientmust have fresh air twenty-four hoursa day, and rest or exercise accordingto the orders of. the doctor. Tbe mostimportant items inJhe diet are eggsand milk, because they contain a largeproportion of easily digested nutri-ment. A few years ago, the doctorsJ reasoned that if a little of this highlynutritious diet in small bulk was good.a lot would be better; and so, in manycases, the patients were stuffed untiltheir stomachs did not work properly.Now, the question of diet is better understood; only so much of milk andeggs are given as the patient careasily digest. Of course, other foodsare necessary, and are to "be used instrict accordance, with the doctor's orders. It is his business to know whatthings the patient can digest. A Pennsylvania consumptive, -vYho tried tolive largely on a diet of boiled hamand oabbage, experienced the naturalresult of a steady decline. Remember, then, if you are a consumptive,to follow the doctor's orders strictlyin regard to the diet; and if he doesnot prescribe a considerable" use ofmilk and eggs, go to another doctor.Kkentuctfy Tubercu!6sisc Commission.Twin Bios.

KY., AUGUST .1, 1913eXfR wIfftThe Bourbon NewsEstablished Feb. 1, 188LjBWIFT CHAMP,- Editor andPublisher(Enterea at the Paris Kentucky Postoffice as Mail Matter of the SecondClass.)Judge Dundon'sBelated CardHeHeld It From Publication Untilthe Last Issue of The KentuckianCitizen Before the Election, So AsNot to Give Time For a Full andFair Discussion of The MattersTherein.The race for County Judge has beenin progress several months. Therecan be but one reason for Judge Dundon's lenghty communication publishedin the Kentuckian-Citizen on last Wednesday, July 30th. That was the lastissue of that paper before the day ofelection. He delayed until the lastissue of that paper so as not to givetime for full and fair discussion of thefacts therein announced by him, (sothat the voters could not see forthemselves how much or how littlethere is in his claim).The News has been shown a circular letter which Judge Dundon is sending out to the voters of Bourbon. It-is Judge Dundon's article which appeared in The Kentuckian-Citizen'with a lot of other things insertedliere and there which Judge Dundoneither could not get printed in a newspaper, or was unwilling to say in anewspaper, preferring to use the mailsto get these things to the voters just"before the election and too late forreply.He starts out by the meanest of allinsinuations that his opponent, if elected County Judge, would not do his(Dondon's) cases justice. In otherivords, he does not want the office toget the salary out of it. No indeed!But he simply announced for CountyJudge because his opponent would notdo him justice! But the trouble aboutthis is that Judge Dundon was a candijdate for the office several months before McMillan was thought of as a candidate! He uses the phrase "Good faith" inreference to the Bourbon News. TheBourbon News desires to know if therest of his statements are made inthe same "Good faith" as the one towhich we have just referred.Judge Dundon says he is opposedto voting negroes in the coming election. In the same cord he says thatthe reason he agreed to defend BudMacom and others went""to the pollsand voted for a Democrat for the Legislature! By the way, as to his aversion tovoting negroes. It is still fresh inthe minds of the people in this sectionhow many negroes were voted for himin Clintonville No. 2 eight years ago.We didn't hear Judge Dundon offerto resign on that account.Of course, Judge Dundon is not goingto vote negroes this time in the senseof going to the polls with them, butfriends he can't control (?) will dothis for "him, and again when appraised of it he will not resign.Judge Dundon admits that he de-fended a Blind Tiger in Claysville onetime. The Judge's memory fails him.He defended him as the records of theBourbbn Cicuit Court will show, inseveral trials until Bud Macon sawthat the juries of Bourbon countywould not stand for that and gavehim the limit. Then Macon made achange in his attorney.Judge Dundon says that there is nostatute against him taking employment in criminal cases. You cannotfind a statute against doing a geatmany things which nobody should do.Some things are left to a sense ofTight and propriety. How can aCounty Judge, who takes an oath touphold the law persuade himself thatlie can take employment to defend lawbreakers? It is his business to issue"warrants of arrest and prosecute themfor violation of the law. The evil result of law breakers feeling that they.had a County Judge to stand by themis too obvious for argument.Why does he not tell us of someother County Judge of Bourbon County"who accepted employment in suchcases? Why does he not tell us ofsome other County Judge in Kentuckyvho takes employment in such cases?He refers to the administrationwhich preceeded him leaving an overdraft or floating debt of $30,000.00and he uses this as an excuse for thehad condition of the turnpikes,$45,000.00 a year taxes each of theeight years during which Judge Dunoon has been County Judge, but heneglected to add that the county stillias this indebtedness of about 30,000,-00 besides unpaid contracts for bridgesamounting to 16,000.00 or 18,000.00.Referring to the published article oflis predecessor, Judge Smith, JudgeTundon says that when Judge Smithwent out of office the average condition of the roads was not nearly asgood as it is to-day. The grand juryof Bourbon county did not arraignJudge Smith for the condition of theToads, but it did arraign Dundon's. ad--ministrationlast March. Now we willsubmit to the people of Bourbonconaty who have traveled over theturnpikes of Bourbon county how accurate or true this statement is.With a few favored road?, excepted, theiarhpike system of Bourbon countylias gone down, down and down everyyaar during the eight years JudgeDundon has been in office and the peojto of Bourbon county will bear us outin this statement.To quote part of his card:'If the people still want good turn?flcMB, the only way to do is to submittke question of a bond issue to the peoj&& and let them say whether or nottky are willing to be taxed in a sumaoficient to rebuild all the pikes."No, indeed, Jiidge, you are wrongbcHtt this.

McMillan on the subject of theturnpikes and what he expects to doif he is elected, we publish below hisannuoncement made when he becamea candidate for the office of CountyJudge.)CARD FROM C. A. McMILLAN.TO THE DEMOCRATIC VOTERS OPBOURBON COUNTY:I hereby announce mysely as a candidate for the office of Judge of theBourbon Gounty Court, subject to theaction of the Democratic Primary Election, to be held on August 2, 1913.In asking the citizen of BourbonCounty for this high honor I am doingso with the full understanding of theresponsibilities attached to this impora year is being spent with very littleresults noticeable. There is nobodyto look -after the pikes. The CountyJudge does not leave his office to seewhether they are properly repaired orwhether the tax payers are getting value receive for the money spent. No,the people are not in no humor toraise more funds by issuing bonds andpaying more taxes to meet the bonds.They are not satisfied with the wayin which the $40,000.00 or 45,000.00 oftaxes per year is being spent. Theyare certainly in no humor to put morefunds in the same hands to be spentin the same way.What the voters want is some onewho will not have so much businessof his own but what he can leave theofficeof County Judge long enough tolook after the turnpikes, of. Bourboncounty and see that the roads are repaired and kept up with the taxes already being paid each year.In other counties in Central Kentucky which pay no more taxes thanBourbon county the County Judgeswho will attend to the office enough toprovide roads with the present taxes.Speaking of having let the roads gowithout repairs until it was necessaryto rebuild about 40 miles of such newroad the Judge says: "These goodoads were not built for the benefitof my particular friends as alleged, butone of first was built in a communitywhere I had never had a strong per-l-sonal following." Of course, that wasj the very place to put up his political! fences and make new roads and makefriends so he would be strong in thenext election where he was weak inthe previous election.Judge Dundon tries to leave thepression that he is not responsible forthe condition of the roads. That theMagistrates are responsible, not theJudge. We have twice referred tothe fact that the Court of Appeals ofKetucky in 1902, before Judge Dundonaccepted the office as County Judgeheld that the County Judge is responsible and may be indicted for failingto discharge the duty of keeping upthe turnpikes. We offered in theevent anybody questioned this to procure a copy of the opinion of the Courtof Appeals and publish it. Nobody,not even Judge Dundon, questionedthis, because he knew we could getand publish on him a copy of thisopinion decided in 1902.He speaks of the law holding the ter public discussion havig appearedCounty Judge responsible, but he says in the papers (in plenty of time forit will not go into effect until next Judge Dundon to have answered it)year. So, you see he is side-stepping, but not one word in this lengthly ar-He knows we were not referring to tide do we find on this subject notthat new law when we said the Court even an attempted explanation. Again,of Appeals decided in 1902 that the if he is so much in favor' of fair elecCounty Judge is responsible and can tions, why did Dundon and O'Brienbe indicted for the bad condition of take a hasty trip together to Frankthe roads. fort to prevent this scheme from beingNOTE The Countv Judere has. t.liA upset by the appointment of some dis-power to summon the Magistrates tomeet and stay in session until theytake steps to repair turnpikes.When he speaks ofthe Fiscal Courtentering into a contract with the L. &N.

The Judge forgets to tellus that the new court house was builtduring that time and that the moneydrawn by these Magistrates was wellspent in securing a substantial andhandsome building at a low price andthat part of this money was spent employing Magistrates to go out and lookat the turnpikes arid see that theywere properly repaired and that themoney spent on them was well spent.The little money spent by the countyin thia way sared the county thousandsiuv muuaauuB uj. uuiittio. j JlLUe OIthe same policy during Judee -Dun-don', .dminirtration wortd have giventant position, and if elected, I herebypledge myself to give all my time tothe duties of the office, and to regulatemy office hours so that they will beconvenient to the pleasure of the people of Bourbon County.I also pledge myself to give, at alltimes, a personal supervision to theturnpikes of the county, and to seethat all sections of the county roadseceive heir proper proportion of themoneys that have been raised by taxation, for repairing and constructing ofroads, and also to see that these fundsare expended in an economical manner. I will try to see each of you in person, before the election and will appreciate any support you may giveme., Respectfully,c. a. McMillan.us better roads with less money spentfor that purpose.Judge Dundon makes the point thatthis fight is against him and notagainst the Magistrates; that theMagistrates are good men. Weheartily agree with him that the fightis against him and "not against theMagistrates, because he is the one tobe held accountable for his administration and not the Magistrates underhim. These same Magistrates, withthe right kind of a County Judge whowould properly aattend to the duties ofhis office would give the people a successful administration. No better argument need be adduced that the lawas well as the public holds Judge Dundon responsible for the condition ofthe pikes than his own admission thatthe people are fighting him, not theMagistrates under him.He says that nobody would undertake to build the road in the Clintonville precinct. Why, the fact is thata competent and reliable contractordid put in a bid to puild the road andwanted to build it, but he wasn't oneof the Judge's favorites and of coursedidn't get the job. 'About not building a new Cotton, Town, bridge. If that means the lossof votes, it is .the Magistrates, .notJudge Dundon. If he can curry favorwith a voter by referring to the factthat no bridge has been built, then itis Judge Dundon, not the Fiscal Court?So, when it comes to the Fiscal Court,the things which the Fiscal Court hasdone that will make votes are labeled"We did it." And things that theFiscal Court has done which losesi votes are labeled, "The Magistratesim-'did it."The Judge has much to say about hisucouc mi icrtii auu luir elections. xutin the long article he wrote we failto find any explanation of how thatgame was played and that unfairnesspracticed which consisted of fivenames for Dundon and O'Brien beingcertified to Frankfort last August fromwhich an Election Commissioner wasto be and was selected resulted in apartisan of Dundon and O'Brien getting the position of Democratic Election Commissioner and enabling him,along with the Republican Commissioner, who was hostile to Hinton andMcMillan putting in partisans of Dundon and O'Brien in the various votingbooths.

NJudge Dundon claims he is not making an active campaign. There arevarious ways of campaigning and getting elected. Do not be misled by thisassertion.Again, Judge Dundon has been inoffice eight years using his office and jits patronage to build up a strong Jpolitical machine to help him in elec-1tions and he is depending some onthis machine working for him. Hismachine may be strong, but the Democratic voters of Bourbon county arestronger, and have made up theirminds to smash his (machine thistime.MR. BUTLER REPLIES TO THECHARGES OF JUDGE DUNDON.At the eleventh hour, when hethough no reply could reach the' voters,Judge Dundon issues a lengthy circular letter in which he makes certainstatements in regard to myself whichare at such varience with the factsthat I am compelled to notice. I denythat I ever asked the Circuit Courtfor an allowance of $1,500 for indexingthe Commonwealth cases in the Circuit Clerk's office.I deny any order was issued to meby the Circuit Court for 1,500.00 orany other sum .I deny that I ever presented an orderfor the payment of 1,500.00 or anyother sum to the Fiscal Court, andof course could not have been refusedas Mr. Dundon declares.If any one cares to investigate as towhether Mr. Dundon or myself is inerror, I refer them to the records ofthe Bourbon Circuit Court.Mr. Dundon, in his egotism, maythink "he is standing between me and1,500.00, but that question is before atribunal presided over by a Judge honorable, upright ad truthful.I am opposed to Mr. Dundon because for eight years as County Attorney he was in my opinion a miserablefailure, and his administraton of eightyears as County Judge has put our people in a state of unrest and dissatisfaction that amount almost to revolution. Judge Dundon has much to sayabout the above suit, now pending inJudge Stout's court.As he is a candidate and I am a private citizen withthe right to vote for whomsoever Iplease, had he not better occupy histime explaining about the suit of 1,000brought by James M. O'Brien for thetaxpayers against him, alleging thatJudge Dundon had collected thatmuch from Bourbon county to whichhe was not legally entitled and asking Judge Dundon to pay it back tothe county.Then, too, Mr. Dundon might explain about that 700 illegally takenfrom .he county funds to whichJudge Henry C. Smith referred in hisletter.CHAS. E. BUTLER.FORMER JUDGE SMITH'S REPLYTO JUDGE DUNDON'S ARTICLE.To The Voters of Bourbon County:Judge Dundon begins his voluminouscommunication in the Kentuckian-Citizenthis way and so I will beginmine, he to get votes, I to get thetruth before the people.The first thought that came to mymind after reading his article was,"See the galled jade wince." TheJudge's communication proves twothings as sure as a self evidentproposition: First, by waitig until aday or two before the election to publish his article, he acknowledges hisofficial record is vulnerable and he wasdetermined not to have in ventilated;Second, it proves the authorship of theanonymous article in the Paris Democat, where he was lauded as thegreatest Judge that ever lived, and byinsinuations, damn the good names ofall former County Judges because akinsman of Judge Turney and JudgeMann was running against him.The Judge in his article is laudinghimslf not as the greatest Judge, butthe best Democrat, forgetting the fundamental principle of Democracy is,"Rotation in office."I haven't the time or space to notice but a few of the items in his longarticle. He starts out by telling a halftruth, thinking to deceive the voters,by speaking of the 80 cents tax levy ofApril, 1905, and speaks of the deficitcaused by it, but he fails to tell of thefollowing November, after he waselected County Judge, how he andothers banded together and had passed a measure through the Fiscal Court,not only increasing his salary, but thesalaries of all the county officers. Idenounced from the bench such procedure a s a salary grab. He waspresent, as were other county officers.After the meeting two of the oldestmembers of the Paris bar came to meand complimented me upon the standI took and agreed with me it was asalary grab. One of the two wasJudge Mann, the other Mr. W. H.McMillan. The last named is living inParis, and I refer any to him as to thetruth of my statement.Judge Dundon knew then and knowsnow that increase of salary was a violation of the spirit of the constitutionallaws of the State. That increase ofJudge's salary and the other countyofficials helped to make the deficit hespeaks of. 'In a former article I explained where700 of this deficit w'ent, and if I hadthe time I would give the exact figuresand they are large, where the formerFiscal Court, to protect BourbonCounty's interests, had to employ other attorneys at large fees fees, andBourbon county had a County Attorney at that time. (Editor's NoteJudge Dundon was then County Attorney.) This amount would go far tomake up this deficits; and if I had alittle time I think I could explain howthe entire deficit came about.The next ite ml notice the Judgejumps on the Building Committee, accusing them of juggling their figures,and thereby deceiving the FiscalCourt, something no one ever heardof before. But he fails to tell why hewas dropped from the Building Committee. If anyone has curiosity andwishes to &now, let him ask the thenChairman of the Building Committee.The next, item I notice the Judgepike question. Here dgain the JudgeState? hS? S toS. V deceive tievoers. JTis truth the levy of tudnpikefund in the six years I was in officewas about $200,000, but he fails tostate about three years before I cameinto office, the county voted free turnpikes and a former Fiscal Court hadto buy the turnpikes from the stockholders at a cost of about $100,000;and that debt was on the countywhen I went into office, and during myterm that debt was paid and the other100,000 (or about 17,000 per annumas I stated in my last article) wasused to help keep the turnpikes in repair. He said the roads are in betterrepair now than they were when hecame into office. This I deny, and askhow in the world can such a statement be true, when 300 miles of thecounty's pikes have had hardly anywork on them in eight years?Last Sunday I was talking to oneof the leading attorneys of the Winchster bar, who owns an automobile,and stated to me, the turnpikes ofBourbon county under my administration were . much better than Clarkcounty' turnpikes, but "under the present administration of your county,your roads have gone down'so thatauto tourists shun your county asmuch as possible." If any one wishesto know who this attorney is, call meup.The Judge thinks I have learned agreat deal about t urnpikes since retiring from office. If I have it is fromClark's or Fayette's system; certainlynot from Bourbon's present system.I would lika to ask why Masoncounty's Judge and Montgomerycounty's Judge can get the U. S. Government to build a model road fromMaysville to Mt. Sterling, and theMontgomery Judge get a model roadfrom Mt. Sterling to the Bourboncounty line and Bourbon county'sJudge has never attempted to get onemile for Bourbon county.Poor Clintonville, poor Centerville,poor Ruddles Mills, poor Little Rock,what are you going to do, if you hadas many voters in your towns asMillersburg or North Middletown youmight have had one good road fromyour place to Paris before now.Judge, "consistency is a jewel." Ifa former County Judge was responsible for the condition of the turnpikes when in office, why is not thepresent County Judge responsible forthem to-day.Respectfully,H. C.

(ad-lt)WINDIINSURANCE.'IS&Fire andLightninghiponst12 Big CompaniesMcMlllLAN LOOKS LIKE xWINNER IN B0URB0k" v.The representative of the Lexirig- Tton Herald, Sherman Harvey, after "coming to Paris and investigating the Jpolitical situation in Bourbon, has thisto say in yesterday's issue of theHerald."Fouf times elected to office, twicaas County Attorney and twice as County Judge, Dennis Dundon, has again'appealed t'o he Democracy of BourbonCounty to honor him with- the office,.'and so hot is the opposition to renewed tenure of office for the tall sycamore of Houston Creek, that his cry "for help can be heard up and down thecounty."It was evident before the race had!progressed far that McMillan was assuming an aggressive stand and wasscarrying the warfare against Dundoninto the harvest fields and tobacccrpatches and was everywhere gainingsstrength. Some of Dundon's old timesupporters contended their candidatehad got a poor start; that" the distance a third term, was just a littletoo long, and the political roads orthe county badly out of repair and almost impassable with heavy loads,except in North Middletown precinctand that unless something was doneto check the McMillan tidal. wave,the fiscal affairs of the county wouldpass out of their control."But everybody admits that the.-"Jurist is a shrewd politician. Eightyears ago in his race with Thomas,North Middletown gave Dundon onlytwenty-one votes out of practicailv300. Dundon, it is claimed, figuredThomas would again enter the raceand after serving the people four yearshe announced his candidacy for reelection. As predicted, Thomas declined again to make the race, and soone else aspiring for the office, Dundon had a clear track which was hisundoing. He really believed no onecould be found who would run against,him, so great was his estimate of hisown political strength. But withouttaking any chances, he concluded thesurest way to win in 1913 would beto get on the side of the good peoDleof North Middeltown where he polledonly one vote in ten. There was butone way to do this, and that was zobuild all of the old North Middletownturnpikes over again and it was donerwhile other portions of the countyhad to pick a 'spell' of good weatherto get to town. North Middletown gotthe pikes pikes rolled and mad .classic automobile drives, and it is saidDundon will now get almost arf"eveabreak in the vote when it is cast aadtcounted Saturday in the old bailiwick,of his aggressive opponent of eizhtyeH ago;Sherman Harvey has been keeoinat.a close watch on the Bourbon political chess board, and is of the opinioathat McMillan has the third termerbeaten to a frazzle."That Judge Dundon and his o4bodyguad are alarmed, is indicatedby the rumor that alighnments witbiother candidates are being made thssame as eight years ago when Dundoahooked on behind the Clark-Thome-sonSheriff ticket which went througkby nearly 800 votes with Dundon lessthan one-eighth that number. ,"The Sheriff ticket composed of TaJbott, Marshall and McClintock has hoopposition this year which forced Dundon to seek other strongholds."Eight years ago Dundon and JamesO'Brien, afterwards Mayor of the ckjvwere bitter plitical enemies, and iaorder further to strengthen up histpolitical fences, made peace with iheMayor and it is said is co-operatingrwith O'Brien to encompass the defeatof Hinton as a candidate for re-eiec-tionas Mayor.

ELGIN, SR.To4he Democratic Voters of Paris:Fred Link, who is a candidate forChief of Police of Paris, seems to havea hobby of breaking into print, andthis week had scattered over Paris acircular telling of his "great" recordas a detective and spoke of otherthings in regard to the fitness of a manman for Chief of Police. He says thata man when he gets to be fifty yearsold should be retired as a Chief ofPolice, and of course that refers tome. For his benefit I will say thatthe Chiefs of Police qf Maysville, Carlisle, Lexington, Richmond, Winchester, Georgetown, Frankfort, Louisvilleand other placesifi Kentucky are over50 years of age, and the late JamesMernaugh was over 50 years of ageand died in office.Mr. Link denies that he was a strikebreaker in Chicago. If this charge isfalse, he is the one responsible for thefalsehood, for he told the followinggentlenien he was a strike-breaker:John Duvall, Interurban Conductor;Chas. Barnett, City fireman; Wm. Collins, City fireman; C. W. Heck, J. C.Elgin, Sr., and many others, and bragged about it.George Morat,of this city, was in Chicago at the time of fhe strike, andknewr Link was one of the strike breakers.Link brags about his promptness inattending to calls fdr Police duty.When Albert Wright's residence wasenttered by a burglar Wright called forLink, but his wife said he was asleepand she would tell him when he awoke.He never answered the callIf he assistedin arresting so manycriminals he never reported them toheadquarters, as he had been orderedto do.Four weeks ago he was off dutywithout permission, and out fishing allday Sunday. On the following Mon- jday morning h e was taken beforeMayor Hinton and- lectured ,for his ,neglect of duty.

M.Harbeson, of the Kenton Circuit Court,defeat without a comfort was the portion of those who have wroughtstrenuously to throw the Burley Tobacco Co. into the hands of a receiver. The order entered Thursdayin the action of E. B. Stansifer vs.Clarence LeBus and others sustainedthe contentions of the defendants, gavejudicial discredit to charges made bythe plaintiff, commended the management of the company and overruledthe motion for a receiver as a pleawithout merit.Judge Harbeson's ruling constitutesa comprehensive summation of theevidence presented at the hearing onthe motion in Covington last week, together with , a review of steps takenpreviously in the hostile litigation.The keynote of the decision is to befound in the declaration:"There was no evidence whateverwhich tended to show that the fundsor property in the hands of the defendants, whether we call it the property of the Burley Tobacco Co. or theproperty of the defendants, is in danger of being lost or materially, or atall injured."Management Is Commended.Concerning the investments by thedirectors Judge Harbeson says:"In these investments there is noevidence of any unfair dealing, oreven bad business judgment, .but onthe contrary, indicates the same attention and care upon the part of thedefendants that would be given theirown funds."Although declared to be withoutmerit, the Stansifer litigation has beena cause of serious embarrassment tothe company, and enemies of the farmers' organization in chief agents ofthe tobacco trust have usevd it tocreate suspicion, foment discord andwork real injury to the company's interests by prejudicing trade. With thisbar removed, stock now may be issuedin line with the decision of the Courtof Appeals and business will go forward without a handicap.Whjle the Kenton suits have beena source of harrassment and large expense, it is declared by those interested that they will bear a measure ofgood in affording opportunity for disproving libels that were being circulated by self-seekers hostile to themanagement and disarming agents ofadversaries who have hoped for thedestruction of the organization throughpersistent litigation of this character.The decision of Judge Harbeson infull is as follows:Text of the Decision."E. B. Stansifer, who as a stockholderin the Burley Tobacco Co. sues on behalfof himself and all other stockholders ofthe company, and for and on behalf ofthe Burley Tobacco Co., instituted thisaction against Clarence LeBus and aboutfifty other persons who are also madedefendants."The original petition in substance alleged that the plaintiffs, who in 1909were poolers of tobacco, subscribed tothe capital stock of the Burley TobaccoCo. ten per cent of the sum for whichtheir pooled tobacco for that year shouldsell, and authorized the Burley TobaccoSociety, who was conducting the pooland selling the tobacco, to pay to theBurley Tobacco Co. the sums subscribedout of the sales of the" tobacco."That the Burley Tobacco Society accordingly paid to the Burley Tobacco'Co. something over one million dollars,which was the ten per cent of the pooledtobacco which the plaintiffs had. subscribed and authorized to be paid intothe capital stock of the Burley TobaccoCo.Purchase of Property."The petition then alleges that without any authority for so doing the defendants took charge of the affairs ofthe Burley Tobacco Co., collected themillion dollars subscribed and paid bythe plaintiffs, and that they purchasedwith this fund numerous warehouses,tobacco manufactory and other real estate, taking the title in the name of theBurley Tobacco Co., and that they nowhave in their hands about $200,000 of thefund."The petition prays that it be adjudged that the defendants are not nowand never have been the legally electedand acting board, of directors of theBurley Tobacco Co., and prays judgmentagainst the defendants for the sum paidby the Burley Tobacco Society to theBurley Tobacco Co., or the amount oftheir stock of the Burley Tobacco Co.,which was paid by the Tobacco Society.Original Suit for Money."The petition does not claim or seekto recover the property in which thefund was invested, but treats the defendants as having converted the plaintiffs' money to their own use, and askfor the amount converted. Subsequentlythe plaintiffs filed an amended petitionIn which they allege that they have alien upon the property and fund is indanger of being lost or materially injured, and pray that a receiver be appointed to take charge of the' propertyand funds until such time as a boardof directors of the Burley Tobacco Comay be legally elected. The petitionalso contains a general prayer for suchrelief as it may be entitled."The defendants filed an answer, theallegation of which are not necessaryto detail further than a statement ofthose facts established in evidence uponthe motion for the- appointment of thereceiver, which are also pleaded in theanswer.No Right To Lien."At the outset, It is contended forthe defendants' that if thev havA nI trerted the money and -property to their'wfi use and jthe. 'Plaintiff liave" electedto" sue them for ih money usel In "thepurchase of the property, or ratherelected to tteat it- -as a debt due theplaintiffs, that they therefore have nointerest in the pioperty or fund, nor alien upon it, and that a receiver is-onlyauthorized to be appointed where theplaintiff claims "the property or a lienupon the property sought to be chargedwith the receivership."This contention involves several legalquestions which the court will not takethe time to consider, or determine, forthe reason that the question presentedmay be determined upon other grounds,regardless of what conclusion the courtmight reach upon that question.No Causo Established."Upon the heaiing of the motion forthe appointment of the receiver therewas no evidence whatever which tendedto show that the fund or pioperty inthe hands of the defendants, whetherwe call it the property of the BurleyTobacco Co. or the property of the defendants, is in danger of being lost ormaterially, or at all injured."Upon the hearing for the appointmentof a receiver, the evidence, without controversy, shows thati the Burley TobaccoSociety is a corporation without capitalstock, and that it was formed for thepurpose of marketing the tobacco of allgrowers who pooled their tobacco.This company found itself unable toproperly receive store and sell the pooledtobacco without capital, and it wastherefore concluded to form, in connection with it, the Burley Tobacco Co.,and in the pledges of Tobacco to theBurley Tobacco Society for the year1909, the grower also agreed that tenper cent of the sale price of his tobaccowas subscribed to the capital stock ofthe Burley Tobacco Co., and authorizedand directed the Burley Society to paythis ten per cent out of the sales of thetobacco.Money Raised By Officers."The Burley Tobacco Society did notsell ., this tobacco until 1912, and hence,while ten per cent of the. tobacco waspledged to the Burley Tobacco Co., ithad no cash in the way of capital withwhich to purchase warehouses, handleandstore this crop of tobacco."It had been incorporated, and undera provision of its articles of incorporation, which will presently be considered,the defendants were acting as its boardof directors. Upon the faith of this tenpet cent of the tobacco pledged to thecapital stock of the Burley Tobacco Co.,and partly upon the credit given to individual members of the board of directors, they borrowed about a million dollars and with this fund purchased warehouses, prized, stored and insured thetobacco and sold it in 1912."Two hundred thousand dollars of thisfund was procured upon the individualcredit of the defendants.Assets and Liabilities."They also purchased a tobacco factory in Louisville for $600,000, and theyhave either eleven or thirteen loose leafwarehouses where sales of tobacco areheld."There is no evidence Introducedwhich would indicate that the assets ofthe Burley Tobacco Co. consisting of itstobacco factory, its storehouses, looseleaf warehouses, and stock on hand isof less value than $1,500,000, while thereis evidence to the effect that its assetsmay be worth nearly $2,000,000, while itsindebtedness is $518,000 or less than athird of its assets."In these investments there is no evidence of any unfair dealing, or evenbad business judgment, but on the contrary indicates the same attention andcare upon the part of the defendantsthat would be given their own funds!"The tobacco factory lost $10,000 yearbefore last, and about $50,000 last year,but it appears that they have been under heavy expense in Introducing newbrands, and their expense upon that account amounted to about $140,000 lastyear, and that nlthnuch r tmri. nf ok anaor 40,000 pounds per month h.is so 'far tbeen developed in one of the new brands, inn frpfllf n .in meat Vino 1nnr r.i..nn Iupon the books of the company for thisdevelopment.Larger Than Capital Stock."According to the evidence introduced,the assets of the company are not merelvmuch larger than its debts, but largerthan the capital stock paid in by thedefendants.An item of $2,900 expended in securingsigners to the ten-year pool of tobaccois urged as an unwarranted expenditure,but it appears from the evidence that allten-year poolers were to subscribe notless than twenty per cent of their salesto the capital stock of the Burley Tobacco Co., and did do so."The evidence, therefore, fails to sustain the allegation that there Is anydanger of loss or injury resulting to theplaintiffs or to the Burley Tobacco Co.by reason of the continuation of its affairs in the hands of the defendant untilthe election to be held for the board ofdirectors."If you proceed upon the theory thatthe defendants may be liable to theplaintiffs for the full amount of thecapital stock of the Burley Tobacco Co.,and that the assets standing in the nameof the company Is property to whichthey resort or upon which thev have alien, the same result is reached.Executive Board Responsible."Not only does the evidence introducedshow that these assets exceed the capital after deducting the indebtedness, butit also shows that the executive boardin their individual right are worth about$2,000,000, and this executive board isnot more than a sixth in number of thedefendants."It s contended by the plaintiffs thatthe defendants are not legal officers ofthe Burley Tobacco Co., and that thereare no legal officers of the company, andthat therefore the appointment of a receiver to take charge of the assets ofthe company is authorized, and shouldbe made, regardless of whether theplaintiffs are in danger of loss or injury by reason of the failure to appointa receiver."The facts disclosed' upon this question are as follows: The governingboard or authority of the Burley Tobacco Society is the District Board. Itis composed of a member from eachcounty and is selected by the severalprecinct representatives of the organization in their respective counties, andthe precinct representatives are choseneach year a pool is made by the growersof tobacco in the respective precincts.Provision of Charter."When the Burley Tobacco Companywas incorporated it was provided Jn itsarticles of incorporation that the members of the District Board of the BurleyTobacco Society should constitute theBoard of Directors of the Burley Tobacco Company."In accordance with this provision ofits articles of incorporation the defendants, who were members of the District Board of the Burley Tobacco Society, proceeded to conduct the affairsof the Burley Tobacco Company, andhave managed and are still managingits Jiffs. irs"On October 7, 1912, the plaintiff instituted in the Kenton Circuit Court anaction against the defendants settingup these facts, and the other facts setup in the petition in this case, whichcause was drawn by the other division ofthis court."Notices were given and a receiver applied for. The court in that case heldthat the provision of the articles ofincorporation of the Burley TobaccoCompany which provided that the members of the District Board of the BurleyTobacco Society should constitute theBoard of Directors of the Burley Tobacco Company was in violation of theConstitution; and that the defendantswere not the legally elected or constituted Board of Directors.Acts Held Valid."The court, however, refused to appoint a receiver, and in the opinionsaid:" 'The court does not mean to holdthat the acts of the present Board ofDirectors are void; on the contrary theyare, in his opinion, valid as the acts ofde facto officers. Nor does the courtthink that the present officers shouldbe disturbed pending a determination ofthe controversy. No ' good purposewould be served by placing the businessof defendant company in the hands ofa receiver. All the relief to which theplaintiffs may be entitled can be securedto them without resorting to so drastica course. The court merely holds thatthe attempt to deprive the shareholdersof the Burley Tobacco Company of avoice in the organization and management is void.'"From the order of November 9, over-appeal .-was prayed or granted.? There-after on April 5, 1913, the followingagreement was entered: jText of Agreement." 'It is agreed by the parties, plaintiffsand defendants herein, that in consideration of the dismissal without preju-.dice by the plaintiffs of so much of theiipetition, as amended, as seeks to enforce individual liability on the part ofthe defendants, the defendants agree toand will enter their appearance to aksuit on the part of the plaintiffs thatshall be Instituted promptly in the Kenton Circuit Court to enforce said indi-vidual liability. j" 'And it is further agreed that thecourt costs in the lower court and theCourt of Appeals that are incurred bythe plaintiffs or any of them in the suit 'now pending and which Is to be takento the Court of Appeals to determine thequestion therein involved, relating to thecharter, shall be paid out of the fundsof the Burley Tobacco Company, whether decided for the plaintiffs or defendants.' "In accordance with this agreementan order was made on the plaintiffs' motion dismissing 'so much of their petition and amended petition as sets upor seeks to enforce personal liability onthe part of the individual defendantsherein.'Election Is Ordered."Thereafter on the same day a judgment-wasentered in the cause adjudging that the provision of the charter oithe Burley Tobacco Company makingthe .members of the District Board of theBurley Toacco Society its Boaid olDirectors, was void, and that the individual defendants are not and have notbeen the legally constituted Board of Directors of the Burley Tobacco Company,and further, ordering an election to beheld for the election of a Board of Dfrectors of the Burley Tobacco Company, tcbe held on the first Tuesday after thefirst Saturday in October, 1913. The judgment further appointed a commission tcascertain the stockholders of the company and to hold the election."This judgment was appealed fromand the Court of Appeals has renderedan opinion affirming the judgment.Defendants' Contentions Upheld."Upon this state of facts the defendants controvert, as a matter of law, boththe authority of the court to appoint areceiver, or that it should do so if ithas the right."It is further contended that the judgment refusing to appoint a receiver inthe former action is res adjudicata, sofar as the illegality of the defendantselection or selection as a Board of Directors constituting a ground for theappointment of a receiver."The court is of the opinion that thedefendants are right in both contentions."Upon the proposition that a receivershould be appointed upon the groundthat there are no legal officers of thecompany, the plaintiff has cited to thecourt the following authorities:"The court has . examined the textbooks cited as well as the cases citedin support of the text. The court is ofthe opinion that they do not sustain th6view of the plaintiffs.No Authority Found."In every case cited there was eitherdanger of loss or injury to the propertyof the company by reason of the wantof legally constituted officers, or by reason of dissension."I do not think there is any authorityfor the proposition that the want oflegality, alone, of the selection -of officers has ever been held to warrant theappointment of a receiver where teproperty is in possession of de facto officers and where there is no danger ofloss or injury to property threatened,and wheie an election of legal officersmay be had. In this case an electionhas been ordered and the court has control of the selection of the officers. Theother division of the court has takenjurisdiction of that matter and is exorcising it, rnd nny complaint in regardto it or any right uf pnvilcge which mayneed any direction or order for its protection relative to the election should besought there."Unwarranted Interference.""It would be an unwarranted interference for the court to undertake to makeany order or judgment which has forits purpose the regulation of anv matterpertaining to the corporate property because of the want of legality of selection of its officers, or relates to the election of the new officeis, for that wholematter is before the other division ofthe court, and it has undertaken to giveto the plaintiff the entire relief to whichthey are entitled by reason of the situation. That division of the court overruled the motion for appointment of thereceiver notwithstanding it held that thedefendants were not the legally chosen 'officers of the corporation. This division 'of the court is now applied to appoint areceiver and the sole ground establishedas constituting giound for the appointment. is the same illegality in the selection of the same defendants as such officers. No New Cause Shown."The agreement between the partiesfiled in the case does not affect the ques- ition, for the agreement only dismissedso much of the action as sought a personal judgment against the defendants,T . ,i .

The vote was 61 to 56. Mr.Bradley took the position that to cutthe present rate from $3 to $1.50, asproposed by the Democrats, will destroy the flourishing industry in "Western Kentucky.Senator James opposed the Bradleyamendment and the grounds on whichit was offered. He said that, althoughmost of the spar mined in Kentuckyis in his home county, and the operators of the mines are his boyhoodfrieuds, he is against a duty higherthan $1.50.

Both of these appealswere in the hope of escaping jail sentences which had been adjudged inaccordance with the law.Prior to my. term in office the fol- -lowingsums were collected for fines:In the years 1904, 1905 and 1906, (aperiod of three years,) a total of $1,580.15. In the years 1907, 1908 and 1909, aperiod of three years,) a total of $1,567.20. In the years 1910, 1911 and 1912fthe three years during which I havebeen Police Judge, a total of $2,868.67has been paid in fines.You see, therefore, that during myadministration, there has been a decided increase in the receipts "of theoffice. Also, jail bills for the threeyears have been decreased.The above will surely meet with theapproval of all good citizens.From the fact that practically no appeals from my decisions is it not proofof my fair, lawful and impartial judgments of my fellow man?If re-elected, I assure you that I willcontinue as in the past to judge impartially and according to law.Thanking you for past favors, andrhoping -that my administration may1"meet with your approval and indorsement, with your support, I remain,Your public servant,E.
