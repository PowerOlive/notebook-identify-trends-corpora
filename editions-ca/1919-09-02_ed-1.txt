Some days ago the home ofMr. Ben Bedford was entered androbbed of a large quantity of goods,etc. Sunday night in the absence ofthe family, thieves entered the houseof Mr. and Mrs. L. D. Redmon, onFifteenth street, and ransacked th$place from cellar to attic, takingwhatever of value they could get. Aspreliminary to their work the visitants took precaution of cutting thetelephone wires. Entrance was effected to the home by breaking outthe glass in the front door and unlocking the door from the outsideThe police were notified and are atwork on the case.With the approach of cool weatherthe activities of the sneak thief andthe housebreaker, are apt to becomequickened. The police have suggested that housekeepers take especialnotice of strangers who may be observed prowling around, and reportto the police department at once.It would also be a good idea to keepa trusty shotgun or automatic inreadiness, if occasion arises wherethey can be employed to good advantage. o-B-4 FIREInsure with.

Thisis said by some dealers to be a greater number of machines than ispossessed by any other county in theworld in comparison to its population. Statisticians have figured outthat there is one auto to every elevenpersons in the county, and, reckoningthe average family at four persons,it would mean that there are at leasttwo autos for every five families.Judging from the number of machines parked around the court housesquare and on the side streets in thiscity every Saturday it would seemthat the auto statisticians had missedtheir figures by several hundred machines.

The purchasers will usethe lumber from the building in theerection of a 'garage.The old building was erected in11840, and at that time was considered one of the best churche edifices inthe State. The congregation wasU oIder being organized in anold church building that stood nearthe old cemetery on the Prescottpike. The congregation t afterwardbought a one-fourth interest in theold brick building which is now thenew Public School. The Methodists,Baptists and Presbyterians ownedthe other three-fourths and moved totown. Shortly after, becoming dissatisfied with the joint arrangement,the members of the Christian churcherected the old building which hasnow been supercede'd by the handsome new house of worship.The old Ficklin property, on Mainstreet, opposite the court house, hasbeen condemned by the State FireMarshal, and ordered torn down. Itis one of the oldest buildings in thecity, being one of the very firstbrick buildings erected in the earlydays of Paris.

THE VOTEESMUST SAY.On Saturday, September 6, a pollwill be taken of the legal voters ofthe county on the following questions: "Are You For a Property Tax ofTwenty .Cents on Each One HundredDollars ' Worth of Property in theCounty to be Levied Each Year ForTen Years For the Purpose of Improving or Constructing, Either orBoth, Roads and Bridges of theCounty?""Are You in Favor of Issuing FiveHundred Thousand Dollars in Bondsfor the Purpose of Building Roadsand Bridges?"There seems 'to be a wide-spreadmisunderstanding among the votersas to the purpose of the bond issue,as well as to how the money derived frqm both sources is to be used.To begin with, let it be distinctlyunderstood that there will be no increase in present road tax save thespecial 20 cent tax, for the very goodreason that the constitution of Kentucky limits the additional tax thatmay be levied, to that amount. Ifboth the bond issue and the specialtax are carried -at the election thefunds collected will be no greaterthan if the special tax alone iscarried.Why, then, have a bond issue?The bond issue is essential for several reasons.The turnpikes of Bourbon county,especially the cross roads, are in a deplorable condition. They need worknow and they need lots of it.The bond issue is intended simplyto give the county the right to pledgeits credit to secure additional fundsin the first five years of its programof road construction when money isso badly needed to do the workwhich simply must be done if we areto have roads worth calling by thename, in Bourjbon county.In other words when you vote forthe bond issue you vote to give thecounty the right to borrow money todo work that it would be bad businessand false economy to defer, as will;be necessary under the slower program which we will be copnpelled toadopt if the bond issue is not carried.Further, the lav? provides" that thermon,ey ,derived from the saje of bondsshall be expended by four commissioners selected by' the Fiscal Court.These men have been selected. Theyare Catesby Spears, Sam Clay, SamHouston and John T. Collins. Thesemen have accepted the trust, andhave agreed to serve without compen-sation. If they are to have anypart in the road building programlaid out, the bond issue must be carried. Should both of these issuescarry, the Fiscal Court has agreedthat these pnen shall have supervisionof the' expenditures of all road fundsof the county from whatever sourcederived.The constructing and repairing ofthe road& of Bourbon county is thebiggest business undertaking in thecounty, and it should be handled asany other business is handled, and itis proposed to so deal with it.The county is to be treated as awhole, without showing favor or partiality to any section or any particular roads. All roads can not be worked at once. Nor can all roads be worked first.And in determining which shall beworked first, it will be necessary touse the same business judgment afarmer uses in determining whichbarn shall be roofed first, or whichfence repaired.You know, in the past, on acccountof lack of fuuds, very little work hasbeen done on the cross roads. On themain roads the water-bound macadam is being used at a cost of $4,000.00 per mile. Under present trafficconditions this construction wiU notwear and is a bad investment at itscost. It is therefore deemed good,sound business to do such reconstructing as is done on the trunkline in some way that will be moredurable and lasting.Should both issues carry it is proposed to evpend on the cross roadsfrom $75,000 to ?100,000 per yearuntil these roads are in condition.This amount will operate threecrushers and should soon bring relief. This of itself should be a sufficient answer to the man who favorsgood roads, but fears the money willall be expended on the main thoroughfares. There are those who saytaxes are high enough now. Let uslook at the question in a businessway.You are asked to pay an additionaltax for good roads. Will you makeor lose by the trasaction?Are you not now, indirectly, paying a much greater tax for bad roads?If you are the owner of a truck oran automobile, think of the brokensprings, the tire expense and general repair for which you pay on account of bad roads. If you are not anautomobile owner and this good,roads movement waa not intendedalone for people of., .this, iclass-theowner 'of a carriage, or buggy pays,KTJGGEES GATHERED FEO THE-COUNCILMAMC MDfi;At the recent jmeeting of the ParkBoard of Council considerable business was transacted, the following' be- ving a brief resume of the principalfeatures of the meeting," which wasattended by five of the seven members, and Mayor January presiding:Resolution introduced by Councilman Merringer stating that PresidentJos.

If the road to my bestfriend's is rough, I do not stay away.Tgd, but I certainly become a boosterfor good roads."I am a great believer in, recreaxion for farm folks and our car hassolved this problem entirely. It's anasy thing now for the whole familyto pile in the car and go to the cityfor the great event of the year, thecircus. And this is not pleasurealone; for there are fine educationaladvantages for children in a circus."Often on Saturday afternoon thejpood man joins the children and myaelf in a drive to the county seat,.SlCmtwelve miles away, to see a goodmovie and home again in tipne for thenight duties. Then the lovely tripson hot Sunday afternoons, when, witha box of lunch and full thermos boVtle, we all pile in the car and go forthadventuring."These trips, all made possible andeasy by ownership of a car, havemeant much to me. They have givenme a better knowledge of my,county,of her resources and beauties, andeven her needs. And I do enjoy thefriendly greeting with "the man beside the road." I must not fail tomention the trip to Sunday schooland church, and the greater tijme andease it gives the busy mother in getting the children there in time."The good man of the family willsay that the car is one of his valuable pieces of farm machinery and agreat saver of time."However, I am speaking from thestandpoint of the woman who canrun the car, change tires and cleanspark plugs, if necessary, and I sayfor the women and children on thefarm, that the ownership of a car isthe greatest factor for health andhappiness and education and a bigger, broader vision of life and living." A Town Without Churches.Now you jmay or you may not attend church; you may or you maynot assist in the support of somechurch, but we want to ask you justone question. How would you liketo live in this city if there were notone single church here? Eh, what?Ever think of that before? Paris, agood old town, and not a singlechurch here. Why, you might as welltry to think of Paris without THEBOURBON NEWS and that thought'simpossible. Perish it! That beingthe case, it begins to look as if itwere up to you to support thechurch. You've got to subscribe toTHE NEWS or you wouldn't keepabreast of the news. No one else willpay the subscription price, but youdon't have to belong to a church,and someone else pays the ministerhis salary, so you very easily acceptthe good and close the eye when thecollection plate comes along. Howabout it? Now, we are not intendingto "rub it into" anybody, and mostof our citizens do go to church anddo assist in raising the minister'ssalary and the other church expenses,but we simply present this thoughtto those of you who don't assist, andwe ask your careful consideration ofthe subject. How would you like tolive in Paris and not a single churchin the whole burg? We can see thedust flying now as you beat it.How to Achieve the Millennium.When the "happy and usefulthought strikes the Ajmerican mindthat work, hard work, will solvemost economic problems, and all social problems, we shall hear but little of the high cost of living. Asanother has said: "There are toomany people who are riding andidling and too few walking and plowing! It is the age of gasoline andthe rubber tire, high speed and shorthours, the moving picture and thefarm tractor."In the old days of honest sweat byman and beast, not much was heardabout some things that now worrythe world. There was plenty to eatand plenty to wear; and the simplelife was the rule.Man was made to toil. When hequits' and goes to fighting, as he didin 1914, there will be a scarcity offood and of everything else, and ittakes time, even after he goes backto work, to restore the equilibrium.When he setles down to work, inreal earnest, there will be peace andorder, contentment and prosperity.Safety In Auto Spooning.In revoking the automobile licenseof a youth whose car collided withanother while he was driving withone arm around a girl's waist, Motor Commissioner Dill laid down anew and important rule for motorists."We will have none of this onehanded driving in New Jersey," hesaid. "You can only do one thingat a time."It is a harsh but necessary alternative. Traffic has progressed beyound the free-and easy days ofside-bar-buggy driving, and automobiles, unlike h6rses, cannot be leftto find their way. Even the chummy readster built for two. require awatchful eye on congested thoroughfares. The automobile, indeed, besides theother changes it has wi ought, hasj radically altered the conditions ofvehicular spooning. Perhaps on thewhole it has improved thepn, with thenecessary motoring imposes on thedriver of attending strictly to business. Thus mechanical progressplays havoc with time-honored customs. But it is satisfactory to seethe disposition of youth to takechances with obvious danger properly rebuked. And it will be observed that the punishment inflictedis not the light one of a negligiblefine, but the serious matter of resey justice" runs true to form fromeven in penalties for youthful indisvoking the offender's license. "Jercretion. 'Dire Calamity Threatened.The threat of restaurant proprietors to charge ten cents for a cup ofcoffee emphasizes jmore then ever thedollar. Wben one calculates the purchasing value of a monetary unit,basing the calculation on a subsid-iary coin, the result stands outclearer than were the calculationbased on a higher unit. For instance,the five cent piece that used to purchase a nickle's worth of goods nowwill buy less than two and a halfcent's worth. Consequently, restaurants cannot afford to sell coffee fora piece of money with which they, inturn, can purchase only two and ahalf cent's worth of ground coffee.oCAEENGIE'S WILL DISPOSES OP$30,000,000.NEW YORK, Sept 1.

Isit possible that there could be a"nigger in the wood pile?"For scfne reason, whether it be a,good or bad one, the most favoredpike seems to be the North Middletown, in the county, which has beenreconstructed, repaired, patched,oiled, graveled and tarred, in part,-while the "cross" pikes have gonerom bad to worse, and the citizensalong .those have to sit idly by,-while those who traverse the NorthItfiddletown pike don't even "jostle"in their vehicles or auto conveyanceswhen traveling. Why should thecross pikes, the main pike, the Mays-ville, from Millersburg to the end ofthe Jackstown, be in more than deplorable condition, while the NorthMiddletown pike is almost a boulevard? It is true that the citizens ofthat section are most deserving, andare to be congratulated upon havinga good pike, but is it not equallytrue that .the citizens along the Millersburg and "cross" pikes are deserving of good pikes, oiled, patched,gravel and partly tarred, as well?Besides, Mr. Taxpayer, you mustremember that your property . interest will be "raised" $10 or more peracre in 1920 than they were in 1919,then why further burden yourselveswith a $1,140,000 in total?The Fiscal Court has no biddingright to grant to a commission authority beyond their term of office,unless that authority is carried outduring their 'term of office. No onequestions for a moment the high-classgentlemen selected on the commissionto spend the stupendous sum desired.In other words, the members of theCourt shifted a real responsibility,while they just "laff up theirsleeves."Remember, Mr. Taxpayer this isnot a one-year tax, but a TEN-YEARTAX, with no discount, but an addedinterest of $25,000 per year on $500,000, or $250,000 for ten years,Bully, Mr. "Money Lender," eh?COMMITTEE OF TAXPAYERS.For Sale(Advertisement)iAccording to an announcementmade by Prof. Lee Kirpatrick, Superintendent of the Paris schools;these institutions ,of learning willopen for the 1919-1920 school termon next Monday, September 8. Enrollment of the first six grades willbe held on the first day.Indications are that the Paris HighSchool will have 250 students thisyear, and every effort will be madeto go beyond this mark. A campaignfor a High School education was conducted last year, and it has alreadyshown splendid results. There havebeen persistent rumors afloat to thethe effect that there would be a shortage of books, but it has been officially stated that the Paris schools willnot suffer from that cause. TheBoard of Education, in its efforts toeconomize for the parents, made butfew changes in the books, and therefore but few new books will have tobe purchased for the students. Thenew addition to the school buildingon Seventh, street will not be completed in time for occupancy at theopening of the school term, but alarge force of men are at work pushing the work along, and it will be .amatter of but a short time until theannex is finished.Superintendent Kirpatrick announces that he expects all of thestudents to be present on the opening day, and that every effort will bemade to reduce the amount of tardiness to as low a mark as possible.Teachers for all of the positions inthe city have already been announced, so there seems to be no avenue ofescape left open for the school kiddies.Choice selection of June lilybulbs.

And so whenthe news trickled from Washingtonthe other day that "Nicotine Next"was the new battle cry and after thatcoffee and tea well all the newspapers slapped the story on theirfront .pages and the shock proof village buzzed with excitement.Life would be insufferable to NewYorkers, it would seem, without tobacco and all the Park Row editorsfilled their pipes and slashed outsome rippling caustic editorials hooting at the whole idea. That is thetrouble with New York they hootand the rest of the country doesthings and soon New York finds itselfdry or tobaccoless as the case may be.Shrewed chroniclers of events declare that there is more to this waron tobacco than people seem to realize. In fact one noted lawyer declared that the whole tobacco industry was already in jeopardy andmust begin at once to fight for itslife. 'The Anti-Tobacco folk, it is pointed out, have some mighty strong arguments which can be driven hofmefood and the tobacco acreage is enfood and the tobacco creage is enormous. The industry crowds thousands of freight cars out of commission for carrying other provisions.Growing tobacco exhausts theground, they claim, and of coursethey are playing strong on the healthfeatures the irritated throat, highlyjumpy conditions of the nerves, theheart and other physiological horrorsthat have been handed down fromour school book physiology.One learned educator pointed outin a New York interview that thegrowing of tobacco was of muchgreater agricultural harm than beermaking. Making beer requires onlyabout one-third of the barley crop,whereas the tobacco crop is an economic waste.There is no effort at evasion on thepart of the "Nicotine Next" crowd asto the reason for the campaign. Thefrank statement is made that largeemployers of labor are crusading"purely from a standpoint of the efficiency of labor." A horse or cow isnot allowed to smoke or drink a cupof tea. It has never been found necessary to consult the wishes of thesepatient animals.The same line of reasoning is followed by the crusaders. The workerwho cannot have his glass of beer orpipe of tobacco or cup of coffee,would, like the horse and cow, theoretically be a more efficient laborer.And the logic of this might lead stillfurther. If the worker would go fobed immediately after his supper asthe horse and cow are made to do,then he would be sure of a full andrefreshing night's sleep and wake upready for a very efficient day's work.STAGE MANAGERS FOR THIRDRED CROSS DRIVE.State managers for the "Third RollCall" of the American Red Cross inthe Lake Division have been appointed by MacKenzie R. Todd, DivisionManager. R. F. Grant will head theOhio campaign workers, ClarenceStanley, Indiana, and John R. Downing, Kentucky.

The other purposeof jmoney campaign is to raise fundsto relieve suffering of civilians inforeign countries and to launch theafter-war program of the organization. This includes an extension ofhome service; an enlarged nursingpersonnel to carry the messagev ofbetter health into rural communities,and to organize forces to combat epidemics; and also the extension ofJunior activities in Americanschools.This first peace-time Red Cross enrollment of members makes clear thefact that the Red Cross plans to goon for an indefinite period. Therewill be annually one appeal for support of the organization through therenewal of memberships to carry outthe Red Cross program for Americanpeople, according to a statementmade recently by Mr. Todd, campaign manager for the Lake Division.oHUMAN NATURE THE WORLDOVER.Whenever pla"ns for a new road areannounced it is human nature forthose who live along the way, eitherto bring pressure to bear to bear tohave the thoroughfare constructed infront of their door, or else to forcethe Highway Department to makedetours to save cutting through apiece of property.Perhaps no single feature of roadwork has caused the State HighwayDepartment as much trouble as thesetwo problems, that of wanting thehighway to "pass along my door"and that of securing adequate rightsof way properly located.Such a policy always reacts againstthe owner in the long run, since themore direct the road and the betterlocated, the greater the travel will beand less the cost on maintenance.
