fired killing one ofthem and wounding anotherAlmost immediately afterward theFilipinos line from Caloocan to SantaMesa commenced a fusillade whichwas ineffectual The Nebraska Montana and North Dakota outposts replied virgorously and held theirground until reinforcements arrivedThe Filipinos in the meantime concentrated at three points Caloocanialgalangin and Santa MesaAt about 1 oclock the Filipinos opened a hot fire from all three placesThis was supplementedby the fire of two siege guns at BalikUalik and by advancing their skirmishers at Paco and PandacanThe Americans responded with a terrific fire but owing to the darknessthey were unable to determine its effectThe Utah light artillery finally succeeded in silencing the native batteryThe 3d artillery also did good workon the extreme leftThe engagement lasted over an hourThe United States cruiser Charlestonand the gunboat Concord stationed offMalabona opened fire from their secondary batteries on the Filipinos position at

PANAMAWork oti the Waterway is Prosressinj at aKapld Kate The Culebra Cut WillBe Completed in Nine MonthsNew York Feb C Reports of extensive work on the Panama canal arebrought by Charles M Dobson anEnglish civil engineer who has justarrived here from Colon Mr Dobsonsaid1 have visited the canal on severaloccasions si nee 1891 but I have neverseen anything like the activity visibleat present The French are evidentlyitt earnest and are progressing at awonderfully rapid rate They are concentrating their energies on the greatCulebra cut the most serious obstaclealong the whole route The companyhas from 1700 to 2000 laborers at workwith about 50 locomotives each ofwhich hauls a train of from 10 to 15earsAt the rate at which they are nowexcavating the great cut will be completed within nine months My impression is that the management having finished this cut will declare thatthey have solved the greatest problemof the canal and that additional fundsare all that is needed to carry thewhole work to completion Water isactually in 19 miles of the canal on theAtlantic side and seven on the PacificsideUp to the present about i7000000in American gold has been spent and Ibelieve the canal can be finished for125000000 The company appears tosuffer for no lack of money for themen are promptly paidThe concession given by Colombiaexpired last October but I am informed that arrangements have been madefor its extension for another period ofsix years My impression is that itwill require about ten years morework before the canal is ready to receive shipsMINING CAMP bNOW

is more fraternity of interestthan is generally supposed An instance toprove this theory is found in the case of anartist in the suburbs who had the front ofhis cottage painted last week It wasntmuch of a job but it was done very well andthe painter was told to bring in his billThree days later the man of the house wastold that the painter wanted to see himTell him to leave the bill and Ill sendhim a check was the impatient answerHe was informed that the painter wantedto see him in person so there was nothingto do but to show him upWell said the man of the house rathershortlyI hope you

why you didnt paint yourhouse then and he said you had got yourhand out now and didnt paint anythingbut picture So when I found you was inthe trade I did my prettiest And here isthe bill 18 00 and it

frown on his face cleared Wellanswered chevalier The king I see haswon a faithful and discreet friendMake your attack when you hear thepetard Then he too turned his broadshoulders on me and followed the restAs the sound of the heavy footfallsceased I gave a last look at my pistolsdrew in my sword belt by a hole andall booted as I was essaved the ladderagainI had already observed that the skylight was but a light wooden framework with a glazing between andwould need no great effort to breakdown one strong push and the waywas clear before me So I stayed for aminute of breathless silence then farbelow came a sharp shrill whistle hurried exclamations from the plottersand now the explosion of the petardthat made the house rock to and frolike a tree in the windI had no need to force open the skylight The effect of the explosion didthat most effectually for me and blewout the lamps in the room below as wellreducing it on a sudden to absolutedarkness There was a yell of terrorfrom the room and without a moments hesitation I swung through thewindow and dropped down among theconspirators They were to a mancrowding to the door and not one tookany note of my entrance so great wastheir confusion I followed the rush ofhurrying figures as they passed throughthe door into a passage in dim lightfrom a lire that burned in a smallgrate One end of this passage was fullof smoke against which the brightflashes of drawn swords were as dartsof lightning Beyond the smoke andbelow we could hear the clash of steelcries of pain and savage oaths wheremen were fighting and dying hard As1 dashed down the passage sword inhand my only thought to reach theprisoners room one of the retreatingfigures turned and called out Quickmonsieur follow me the secretstairIt was Lafin In the confusion andsemi gloom he had mistaken me for hischief 1 made no answer but as 1rushed forward struck him on the facewith the hilt of my sword and he rolledover like a logThere I was right in amongst the-eared plotters cheek by jowl withM de -Savoys envoy and I could1 havedropped him then and there but thatmy whole heart was in madames roomand I knew that there were others whocould and would deal with himAs 1 elbowed my way through thepress vainly endeavoring to find theway to my dears prison we reached alauding from which a long stair ledstraight up and here 1 heard the marshals voice cracked with rage andfearMLafin De Gomeron Tome herehereLadies first marzhal I must look tomy brideThen through the smoke I saw deGomerons tall figure mounting thestair and 1 rushed forward to followhimIt was at this juncture that a portionof our own party forced their way tothe landing and one of them whosesword was broken flung himself uponme dogger in hand shouting Deathto traitors I had just time to seizehis wrist He tripped sideways oversomething that lay very quiet at ourfeet and dragging me down we rolledover and over with the clash of bladesover us It is I fool I dAuriac letgo I shouted as he tried to stab at meLet go you sputtered dAubussons voice and we loosed each other 1had no time for another word andgrasping my sword which was hanging to my wrist by the knot I sprangup and the next moment was hot footafter dc Gomeron1 managed somehow to force my waythrough the crowd but the stairwaywas half full of men and at the head ofIt stood the free lance with a red swordin his hand and two or three huddledobjects that lay in shapeless massesaround himSome one with a reckless indifferenceto his own life it was I afterwardfound out Pantin held up a torch andas the flare of it shot up the stairwayde Gomeron threw back his head andlaughed at usTwenty to one come gentlemenor must I come to you He took acouple of steps down the stairs and theeiowd that had made as if it would rushat him wavered and fell back bearingme hoarse with shouting for way withthem to the landingFor the moment penned up and utterly unable to get forward I was a merespectator of what followedThe free lance took one more downward step and then a slight figure withslid out from theone arm in a slingpress and flew at himIt was dAyen and I fell a suddenwarming of the heart to the man whowas going to his deathYou you traitor he gasped asusing his sword with his left hand hissword ripped the free lances ruffStand back old fool stand backor there Take it and with a sharpscream dAyen fell backwards the crowdsplitting for a moment so that herolled to the foot of the stairs and rameup at my feet God rest his soul He1 died at the last like a gallant manThey were backing in confusion nowand above the din I could hear themocking of de GomeronCome gentlemen do not delay timepressesOne rush through at that time mighthave saved him but he stood thereplaving with death With an effort Ipushed d Ayen who wesson wwagainst the side of the wall to let thepoor wretch die in such comfort ascould be and seeing my chance at lastmade my way to the frontDe Goineron was half way down thestairs by this and when our swordsmet he did not for the moment recognize me But at the second pass herealized and the torchlight showed himpale to the foreheadYou he said between his teethYes I from under the Seine andI had run him through the throat butfor our position where the advantagewas all his and my reach too short Hehad backed a step up as I spoke Whether it was my sudden appearance orwhat I know not but from this moment has bravado left him and he nowfought doggedly and for dear lifeThere was a hush behind me and thelight became brighter as more torcheswere brought and I could now see thecamarguer white as a sheet with twored spots on his cheeksDo you like fighting a dead manmonsieur I asked as I parried athrust in tierceHe half groaned and the red spot onhis cheek grew bigger but he made noanswer and step by step I forced himupwardlie had been touched more than onceand there was a stain on his white satindoublet that was broadening each moment whilst thrust and parry grewweaker and something I know notwhat told me he was mv manBut he was a brave man if ever therewas one and he pulled himself togetheras we reached the upper landing for onelast turn with the death that doggedhim So fierce was the attack he nowmade that had he done so but a moment before when the advantage ofposition was his I know not what hadhappened But now it was differentlie was my man I was carried away bvthe fire within me or else in pity Imight have spared him but there is noneed to speak of this more He thrusttoo high I parried and returned sothat the cross hilt of my rapier struckdully over his heart and he died wherehe fellBut one word escaped him some longlost memorv some secret of that ironheart came up at the lastDenise he gasped and was goneI stood over him for a moment adrumming in my ears and then I heardthe ringing of cheers and the rush offeet Then a half dozen strong shoulders were at the door before me and asit fell back with a crash I sprang inand took a tall slim white robed figurein my arms and kissed her dear faceagain and againOne by one those in the room steppedout and left us together and for oncea brave heart gave way and she sobbedlike a child on my shoulderI said nothing but held her to me andso we might have been for a half hourirtQSTEP BY STEP I FORCED HIM UPWARDwhen I heard de Belins voice at thebroken door DAuriac Come manThe king waits and bring your prisoner There was a laugh in his voiceand a light on his face as he spoke andmy dear lifted her swimming eyes tomy face and I kissed her again sayingCome my prisonerAs we passed out I kept betweenClaude and the grim figure still lyingstark on the landing and held her tome so that she could not see So withLisois before us we passed down thepassage tilled now with men-at-armsand halted before a room the door ofwhich was closedThen the door was flung open and astream of light poured forth YVe entered and saw the king standing surrounded by his friends and a little onone side was the dejected group ofconspiratorsThe marshal now abject mean andcringing was kneeling before Henrywho raised him as we entered sayingBiron and you Trmiouille and youall who called yourselves my friendsand lay in wait to destroy me anddestroy your country I cannot forgetthat we were old comrades and forold friendships sake I have alreadytold you that I forgive and iod giveyou all as clean a conscience as I haveover

people hbegun to appreciate natural scenerybut chiefly when it took the form of extensive prospects or what we shouldnow call perhaps slightingly panoramic views The novelists of that century did not place their charactersamong elaborately arranged sceneryPut the essayists of the period hadnoted the tendency of the age andstrove to explain the matter philosophically Thus we read in AddisonsSpectator The mind of man naturallyhates everything that looks like restraint upon it und is apt to fancy itselfunder a sort of confinement when thesight is pent up in a narrow compassand shortened on every side by theneighborhood of walls or mountainsOn the contrary a spacious horizon isan image of liberty where the eye hasroom to range abroad to expatiate atlarge on the immensity of its views andto lose itsalf amidst the variety of objects that offer themselves to its observation Such wide and undeterminedprospects are as pleasing to the fancyas the speculations of eternity o

the following statement Whilethe situation here has been improvedand simplified by the declaration ofGen Gomez that he will immediatelytake part in the pacification of Cubathe advantage thus gained shouldbe followed up by the Americanauthorities The entire policing ofthe island should be done by the Cubans themselves The real police workis in fact now in the hands of the Cuban soldiers and law and order arewell maintained There should notbe a moments delay in the organization and equipment of these civilguardsThe bulk of the American soldiersmust be taken out of Cuba by AprilThere is really no necessity for morethan two regiments in each provinceto serve as a background of supportfor the Cuban police In giving thebest of these people employment allthe more will be left of the relief fundfor those who must be helped back tothe landThe feeling of distrust between theCubans and the Americans has beentemporarily checked by the message ofien Gomez to President McKinleyandthe presidents reply through SecretaryHay If the younger military elementsof both armies will now jret togetherand complete the several schemes forpolicing the provinces which at thismoment arc awaiting crystallization the problem will be solved Delay in this work will be fatal If suchmen as Gen Gomez Jen Montcagudoof Santa Clara province Jen MayiaRodriguez of the Province of Piner Delltio Jen Pedro lietaneourt of Matanzas province and others whom I knowi personally will assure President Me-Kinley and Gov Jen Brooke that lawand order will be maintained theirpledge will be carried out at any costThere is too much disposition todiscuss minor details There is toomuch hesitancy in bringing matters toa head In the province of Santa ClaraMontcaguados admirable policingplan has been alread put in operationand it is one as Gen Leonard Woodtold me yesterday which is alone risrhtlines The entire police work in thatprovince so Maj Logan provost marshal informed me has been done byCubans since

They franklysay that their chief occupation is toguard each other while their chiefs inWashington Havana and Remedors are exchanging confidencesThe younger officers on both sidesshould come together and evolve preliminary policing plans and get thoseinto working order without delayOnce this is well done matters willtake care of themselves in Cuba Atleast that is my opinionTERRORIZED WOMANS

respondedwhen he could get his breath Whatthe buyer meant was an old sewing machine which could be turned in to thesewing machine company as part payment on a new machine The companyallows f 5 on an old machine and sometimes the agent or canvasser allows 5more out of his commission on the saleThe public imagines that in someway these old machines are valuable tothe company but in truth they are ofuse only as arguments in forcing a saleIn the standard makes of machines thereis supposed to be absolutely no cut inprices and the only way that a seemingreduction can be made is by taking inan old machine and allowing for itThe company does this not for the sakeof getting the machine but for the sakeof making a trade Once the old timeris in their possession it is broken up andsold to a junk dealerThe companies know of course thata large number of the families whoturn in old machines said to have benbought by them before the flood reallycome from the secondhand stores andcost only 1 At

woman he had ever met andbe seemed angonizedly anxious to loseno chance of showing her that he toohad been educated that he was netmerely the foolish boy she might haveexpected to find in the son of thehouse at a farm At first this sensitiveinsistent egotism amused Miss Roscommon then it irritated her and at theend of three days she was as near hating Robert Pry as she had ever beento hating anyone -even the least lovedprofessor at Cambridge Vet after allit was not possible to Mabel quite tohate anyone nor was it possible thatKobert Fry should ever be by anyonequite hated She had a very manly veinof tolerance and he a timid appealingmanner which if not feminine was atleast childlike But his quotations goton her nerves and the quiet charm ofher holiday was shattered It was onthe fourth evening that she spoke Hehad been standing beside her lookingat the sea and suddenly broke the calmof the great silence to quote MathewArnolds linesThe sea of faithWas thus once at the full and round earthsshoreLay like the folds of a bright girdle furledBut now1 wish you wouldnt she interrupted almost peevishlyHis blue eyes turned on her with theappealing look of a childs wear whenone whom

in bulk butin quality it gained Then Miss Koscommon awoke to the fact that he wastalking as much as ever and she morethan ever before And now she beganto perceive glimpses of the real manof the passionate love of all thingsbeautiful that had lain leneath hisveneer of cheap culture He talked nomore of literature and art Nor did hetalk of himself But he spoke of hisfather and she respected him Hespoke of his mother and the little deadsister and something like tendernessbegan to soften the respect She sawhow the pastoral peace of the old placeheld his soul and she wondered how hecould ever have torn himself from it togo into the mantles To go to college yes but into the mantles Butthis was one of the things of which henever spokeHer time for holiday was nearly overbefore she learned that he wrote versesTrembling and yet happy he readthem to her one golden afternoon inthe orchard And they were goodverses They accentuated her curiosityas to his choice of a career The twowere now so

prejudiceagainst house plants in the sleepingroom which has not seemed to be justified by anything that has been provedagainst the plants Most of such popnar ideas however embody a truthand it is not always wise to ignore themI has been recently found that malan has been propagated among persona sleeping in a room in which plantswere growing in boxes tilled with malarial soil Several cases of this disease in winter have been recentlytraced by physicians to this cause Thegerms seemed to thrive in the heated airof the house When we remember thesource from which the soil aroundhouse plants is obtainetl and the common use of rotted earth often frommalarious swamps in preparing thesoil it is strange that this complainthas not been made beforeIt is quite possible to have too manyhouse plants A few blooming houseplants are a pleasure in th living roombut the practice of some families ifilling all the sunnv windows withboxew of dark earth for the cultivationof flowers during the winter and springmonths is not one to be commendedThe most essential thing in any homeis the health and comfort of the members of that home If flowers shut outthe sunshine fhen the flowers must begiven up however delightful their presence is There is no such objection toa conservatory built especially for theaccommodation of plants though it ispossible to introduce the germs of malarious earth even in this case Theobjection to flowers in many houses isthat thev mav occupy the sunny windows that the members of the familyshould sit in and enjoy During agreat deal of their time of growth houseplants are not ornamental but simply a promise While summer plantsare restiug from growth it is better tokeep them in a well lighted cellar thanup stairs where they are not often ornamental and are certain to be moreor less in the way This applies to geraniums begonias of some kinds andto the vast majority of the sumrneTblooming plants which must be takenin during the winter X Y TribunePretty Things to

Tale tllaiu UnvarnishedFactsIn all the 20 years of his married lifeMr Greenup had neve forgotten to lookafter the valuable portable property ofthe family before retiring to rest atnightIt was his invariable custom to ioekup the jewelry gold and silver wareand other tempting articles of like nature in a cunningly devised closet ofhis own invention let into the wall ofthe dining room so skillfully that themost experienced burglar would neversuspect its presenceThen having concealed in a somewhat similar way whatever money hehappened to have about him Mr Greenups unvarying habit was to examinethe fastenings of the doors and windows place a sheet of zinc or tin underthe rug at the foot of the stairway leading up to the sleeping apartments themission of this sheet of metal being toemit a loud noise when stepped onafter which he always went to bedFor the proper understanding of thisnarrative it is necessary to emphasizethe fact that these precautions hadnever been omitted no matter how latethe hour To observe them had becomesecond nature with Mr GreenupOne night last week however whenon the point of making hi- usual roundshe was disturbed by the loud ringing ofthe door bellOn going in person to answer it hefound a boy with a telegramThe telegram was to the effect thatsn elderly aunt of his wifes was on herway to visit the family and would beat the station at six oclock the nextmorning Would he please meet herthereTo comply with this request it wouldbe necessary for him to set the alarmclock for five a inNo boy theres no answerHe closed and locked the door andwith the telegram in his hand went upstairs to reassure his uneasy wife andto set the alarm clockThen he undressed and went to bedFive minutes later when on the pointof falling to sleep he remembered witha sensation like a sudden jolt that hehad forgotten to secure the family valuables and examine the doors and windowsFirst time in 20 years he said tohimself as he prepared to get up againThen he lay back and reflectedTwenty years And in all that imethere has never been any attempt tobreak into this house I have spent letme see at least ten minutes every nightlocking things up Twenty times 305thats easy is 700 Ten times that figure is 7 000 Great Scott I bare spent73000 minutes thats over 1200 hoursor 120 working days of ten hours eachIn doing something that has proved tobe absolutely useless And I haventallowed anything for leap years Perhaps Ive been away from home enoughnights to make up for that Four solidmonths thrown away 1 And never a burglar If one wanted to get in hed doit anyhow Does it seem likely that theone night in 7300 when I miss lockingthings up is to be the one night thatsome burglar i going to select for robbing this house Hardly Ill run mychances

andinvariably take advantage of it Thatis business They are acute and carefulmerchants patient faithful and diligent workmen an servants and aboveall they are great lovers of family relatives an homeThe entire population of China is divided into four classes viz Scholarsfarmers artisans or workmen andmerchants In social rank scholarsstand highest as brains control ideasThe agriculturist comes- next becausehe produces something out of nothingThe artisan comes third because byhand and brain he brings into usefulness material that would rthrwise remain crude and worthless The merchant comes- last for the reason that heneither produces nor increases the inherent value or usefulness of anythingI He simply trades upon the needs andlabors of others Ao man is more cautious shrewd and exact in his businessaffairs however than the average Chinese merchantAs a race the Chinese are peaceablequiet unassuming more of the philosophic nature than of the enthusiasticrnd seldom enter tipon

the Living Turtle tothe Boar Layers of th Hnnu inWhich He Lives A Business ThattSlruck an Observer as HeartlessThere are many articles of daily andibourly use constantly passing beforeur eyes and through our hands aboutthe production of which we know comaratively little or nothing An interFeating example of this is tortoise shelliom which oombs and hairpins aregroaflp besides a multitude of trinketsSar the dressing table the desk andvihe pocket Fierce crusades have beenInstituted in recent years against theifilaughter of birds for the procurementtheir plumage for hat trimmingsrand yet I venture to say that the proctsee of procuring tortoise shell is a cruelty to animal life which far exceedsthat to which birds are subjectedIn the eighties I happened to be downIn Blueficlds on that awful Mosquitocoast and at the invitation of oneJUanuel Latona who was the owner andcaptain of a small schooner went withJtiim to the cay El Roncador for tortoiseshell This cay gets its name which inEnglish would be the Snorer from theexceedingly angry surf which can beheard for a long distance breaking overthe reefs This is the cay on which acouple of years back the historic oldhip Kearsarge was wrecked and battered to pieces El Roncador is nothingmore or less than a typical coral island such as is found throughout thesouthern seas three quarters of a milelong perhaps and not more than a jquarter of a mile across its widest part ISurrounding the island is a reef insideof which the water is smooth and jer shallow and at the bottom of thisshallow water there grows a peculiarkind of sea grass which is a daintyfood for the turtle tribes There is alsofound on the top of the water inside thexeef a sort of small blubber fish calledin Spanish dedalcs cr thimble fishwhich is perhaps the greatest delicacyii the entire turtle menuThe turtle whose shell is valued incommerce is a small species known asthe hawk bill There are other varieties which come to El Roncador topawn but they are net molested During the night the turtles crawl up onthe shore to lay their eggs each femaledepositing on an average about 70 Todo this they dig holes in the sand abouttwo feet deep and fter laying the eggsovcr thczn CYX so deftly that it is almost impossible for a novice to findihem These eggs are really deliciousTivhen roasted but the turtle fishers arecareful not to destroy those they do nottake for food so as to promote as muchas possible the increase of this valuableea reptile At night the Ishers concealthemselves along the shore as well aspossible and when the turtles come upjf the wsr on the beach tbey rushforth and turn them over on their backswith iron hooks leaving them secure inthis position until morningThe tortoise shell of commerce is notas is generally believed the horny covering or shell proper of the turtle it isthe scales which cover the shield Theseficales are 13 in number 8 of them being flat and the other 5 somewhat curvedTour of those that are flat are quitelarge sometimes being as much as 12inches long and 7 inches broad nearlytransparent and beautifully variegatedin color with red yellow white anddark brown clouds which give the effects so fully brought out when the shellis properly polished A turtle of average size will furnish about eight poundsol these laminae or scales each piecebeing from an eighth to a quarter of aninch in thicknessIt is the method by which these scalesare loosened which is the repulsive partof the business The turtlts are notkilled as that would lead to their extermination in a very few years Aftercrturing them the fishers wait for dayJ ht to complete the work The turtlesare turned over again in their naturalposition and fastened firmly to theground by means of pegs Then a bunchof dried leaves or sea grass is spreadevenly over the back of the turtle andset afire The heat is not great enoughto injure the shell merely causing it toseparate the joints A large blade verytitular in shape to a chemists spatulais then inserted horizontally betweentin laminae which are gently priedii m the back Great care must be taker not to injure the shell by too muchheat and yet it is not forced off until itis fully prepared for separation by asufficient amount of warmthThe operation as one may readilyimagine is the extreme of cruelty andmany turtles do not survive it Most ofthem do live however and thrive andIn time grow a new covering just asa man will grow a new finger nail inplace of one he might lose The peculiarity of the second growth of shellthough is that instead of reproducingt 3 original number of 13 segments it isrestored in one solid pieceTo see the operation of taking theshell from the living turtle once isal jut all a man of northern breedingwants of it and if the helpless reptileshad the power of voicing their sufferings under it their cries would tell ofas heartless a business as man has yete gaged in Now York PostImpossible In His CaseHungry Higgins 1 see the paper
