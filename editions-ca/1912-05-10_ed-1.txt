Dickson, of Paris,will be named as Circuit Judge to sue- jceed Judge Bobt. L. Stout who will'move from Versailles to Frankfort,leaving a vacancy of the bench in theBourbon-Scott-Woodford district, isthe opinion that prevails here. It issaid that the constitutionality of theact, cutting Franklin out of this district and placing it in a district byitself will be upheld. The announcement that Commonwealth's AttorneyFranklin will remaiu in the new district and the removal of Judge Stoutfrom the old will make the appointment of a- Judge and Prosecutor ofthis district.From the present out-look everything is favorable towards Mr. Dickson, and it is more than probable thathe will get the appointment. Hischances were strengthened yesterdaymorning and his followers receivedmore encouragement when formerState Senator Claude M. Thomas whohas been tipped for the position ofCommonwealth's Attorney and alsofor the Judgship,4 took . occasion toto make known his intentions of retiring from the race for the Attorneyship and also Judgeship, leavinga clear field for Mr. Dickson in thiscounty.Mr. 'Thomas was the last memberof the Bourbon bar to sign the petitionto Governor McCreary asking the appointment of Mr. Dickson, and in aletter to the Chief Executive of theState he declared he was not a candidate for either appointment.Every lawyer in the city of Parisplaced their names to the petition,and Wednesday a delegation went toFrankfort to preseut the claims ofthe Bourbon man to Gov. McCreary,but owing to his absence from theCapitol they failed to get a conference. It is understood that Woodfordcounty -will have an aspirant for theappointment in the person of Hon.Harry Schoberth, of Versailles, butas he is from Woodford county, atwell as Judge Stout, who has electedto go to the new district of Franklin,it is the opinion that the Governorwill hardly go to Wpodford for theeither Circuit Judge.It is said that Scott county is overwhelmingly in favor of the Bourboncounty man for the appointment to theJudgeship and friends of Victor A.Bradley, of Georgetown, will lendtheir influence in support of Mr.Dickson, it would materially increasethe chances of the Scott county manfor the Attorneyship, fcfor which heannounced himself as a candidate,shortly after the act passed the recentLegislature creating the new district.Mr. Dickson experienced no troublewhatever in getting the endorsementof the local bar, together with thatof some of the most representative citizens and it is the opinion thathis appointment will meet with theuniyersal approval of the bar associations all over the district. In eventof his failure to secure the appointment to succeed Judge Stout he willbe a candidate in the next primaryelection to be held, to secure thenomination for the vacancy.Mr. Dickson is one of the mostprominent membprs of the Bourbonbar, and is well qualified to fill theDosition. He has served as MasterCommissioner of the Bourbon CircuitCourt and served Bourbon county inthe Lower Branch of the Legislature.Col. Franklin Issues Statement.A statement issued by Col. R. B.Franklin Wednesday sets at rest therenort that he would move from Frankfort to become thp. rnmmnnwonUhs'Attorney for the Bourbon-Scott-Wood-,lord district. Jbollowmg is the statement :"Any statement that I will removefrom my home county was made without authority from me."If the act making Franklin countya single count.v district is constitutional. 1 will continue to be Commonwealth's Attorney there, and will haveall the more time to devote to my civilpractice."If the act is finally held to be unconstitutional, I will continue to beCommonwealth's Attornev 'for the oldFranklin - Bourbon - Woodford district.Whatever mav be the final vpqnlt nfthe litigation now pending to test theconstitutionality ot the act, I will continue to make my home at Frankfort."rWE KNOW HOW"totototoMO "FATTED CALF" for theProdigal Son, but we do offercomfort and satisfaction to theprodigal clothes-buyer.totototoFine Beers.We sell only John Hauck's famousdraught beer.

This is a day when you and everypurchaser must be shown what the car for which you pay yourmoney will actually perform; what it will do. Beware of anautomobile salesman who attempts to beguile you with apleasing story. Tell him to show the goods and prove to youthat his cars are worth the money. Find out whether his caris a real car or only an assembled automobile built to sell.You have a right to your money's worth, but it is up to youto see that you get it. Deeper than all appearances, thereare a few expert tests which ought to be applied to every car.Who makes the car? Is it an assembled car or made from topto bottom by-one manufacturer? What kind of a guaranteeis on it? Does the manufacturer respect his own productwith a real guarantee, or does he want you to take the chance?What do parts cost you and how conveniently can you getthem? How many cars of this make are in service and howmany are giving satisfaction? Questions like these go deep intothe heart of the case, and if you put them rigorously uponany car you will find out with a certainty whether or not thatcar is worth its price.We are-selling Studebaker E-M-F "30" and Flanders "20"cars because we know that, dollar for dollar, their equal is notsold in the market today. The records of many thousands ofcars in all kinds of service have convinced us absolutelyStudebaker E-M-F "30" and Flanders "20" cars are built torun, and because they run they sell. If we cannot prove toyou under the most searching test that Studebaker cars areabsolutely the best automobile values in the market, we donot want your business ; but we can prove if, and yourneighbors wno drive these cars will tell you the same thing.Be an expert when it comes' to buying a car. You can, bygetting trom us some lurther ideas on real tests of anautomobile, tlip the attached coupon and send it tous now because we have something new to tell youwhich you ought to know, whatever car you havem mind.1n XX X X X XL. - XX -X.X XXAvOxVx 1 toy yv Va.
