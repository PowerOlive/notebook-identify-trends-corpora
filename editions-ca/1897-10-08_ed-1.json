TIRES THAT LEAK
The Morgan Wright single tube
quick repair tire must be regarded as
a distinct improvement in bicycle tire
construction It has the following ad
vantages
While punctures in it can be re-
paired with plugs or semi liquid in
jections as well as in any other
single tube tire it can be permanently
repaired by using the quick repair
inside the tire See cut No 1
No I
By injecting M W quick repair
vcement through the puncture and
then pressing down on the tire with
the thumb as in cut No 2 the repair
No 2
No 3
strrp inside is picked up by the cement
thus closing the puncture as in cut
TXo 3
The Morgan Wright single tube
quick repair tire is guaranteed not
porous This is on account of the way
in which it is made Nearly every
rider has heard of tires that leak
like a sieve
Many tires rot because water gets
into the fabric between the two layers
of rubber The Morgan Wright
fabric is proof against moisture
Everybody knows how comfortable
Morgan Wright tires are and yet
hrw slrlntri tlipv This is
due to the fabric I
Ask any bicycle dealer whether
other tires last as long as Morgan
Wright tires Ask also what the
Morgan Wright guarantee means
Morgan Wright tires are repaired
free of charge at the factory in
Chicago or at any of the Morgan
Wright free repair shops located in
the principal cities
N B When you have a puncture
jet right off Riding a tire flat when
it has a tack or nail in it may
riamanre it considerably

How to
Cure Catarrh
Every sufferer from Catarrh should
know that it is impossible to cure the
disease with sprays washes inhala
tions etc which are universally used
In fact the experience of growing
worse all the while is proof that the
treatment is all wrong Many
who have been under treatment for
years and met with disappointment in
stead of benefit are willing to doubt
that there is any cure for Catarrh
The trouble is that all of the treat
ment they have received has been mis
directed and has not touched their
trouble Catarrh is a stubborn deep
seated blood disease and everybody
should know that to simply treat the
surface that is the local irritation
does not reach the disease A blood
remedy is needed but it must be a good
one a remedy which goes down to the
very bottom of the trouble and forces it
out SSS Swifts Specific is the only
one which can have the slightest effect
upon Catarrh for it is the only one which
goes to the seat of the disease and per
manently gets rid of it This is the only
reasonable way to treat Catarrh
Mr B P McAllister of Harrodsburg
Ky had Catarrh for years He writes
I could see no improvement what
ever though I was constantly treated
with sprays and washes and different
inhaling remedies in fact I could feel
that each winter I was worse than the
year previous
Finally it was brought to my notice
that Catarrh was a blood disease and
after thinking over the matter I saw it
was unreasonable to expect to be cured
by remedies which only reached the
surface I then decided to try S S S
and the results were gratifying for
after a few bottles were used I noticed
a perceptible improvement Continu
ing to take the remedy the disease was
forced out of toy system and a com
plete and permanent cure was the
result I advise all who have this
dreadful disease to abandon their local
treatment which has never done them
any good and take SSS Swifts Spe
cific a remedy which can reach the
disease and cure it
To continue the wrong treatment for
Catarrh is to continue to suffer Swifts
Specific never fails to cure even
the most aggravated cases It is a
real blood remedy and cures Catarrh
Rheumatism Contagious Blood Poison
Eczema Cancer Scrofrda and all other
blood diseases S S S is guaranteed

THE MONOTONIA
Hark How the great oWL ocean day and night
Breaks on you giant roeks on a throne
That towers in silent nighV
In one long plaintive awful monotone 1
i r
Unanswering ever towers the giant rock
Amid the centuries that coino andgo
As if twould only mock -T
The eternal voice that wailed and wailed be
low --
Tis thus O God the deep sea of my soul
Breaks ever on the foot of thy great throne
Its dread but only goal j
In one long plaintive awful monotone I
Unanswered yet but hoping still itcalls
Will not the throne take pity on the woe
How terriblo if its walls
Are always silent to the wail below 1

A JOKERS FAME
Some Interesting Reminiscences of the
Famous Humorist Sydney Smith
Sydney Smith was a political reform
er and one of the foremost men of let
ters of his time but he is remembered
chiefly as a humorist who could enliven
a dinner table with his wit Like other
wise men who have a talent for making
people laugh he was jealous of his
reputation for good sense
When he reprinted his essays from
the Edinburgh Review his object
en in his ownt words was to show if
I could that I had not passed my life
merely in making jokes but that I had
made use of whatever little powers of
pleasantry I might be endowed with to
discountenance bad and to encourage
liberal and wise principles In this
oujecc ne ianea ixis puuiic services anu i
wisdom have been forgotten His jokes j
are remembered
His account of Dame Partington who
lived upon the beach at Sidmouth and
who was seen during a violent storm
trundling her mop squeezing out the
sea water and vigorously pushing away
the Atlantic ocean is a household story
which every one knows The circum
stances in which it was told and the
effect produced by it have passed out of
mind
It was at the end of a long agitation
for political reform in England when
the house of lords had thrown out the
great measure of Lord John Russell
which had been carried through the
commons Sydney Smith the political
parson who had been advocating Lib
eral principles and reform measures for
many years told this story at a politi
cal meeting in Taunton at which
speeches were made protesting against
the action of the lords It caught the
public fancy and within a week every
body in England was laughing over it
Mrs Partingtons mop battle with the
tempest tossed Atlantic portrayed the
lords futile struggle with English pub
lic opinion That funny story was prob
ably more effective than the most elo
quent argument in disarming mobs
preventing a breach of the peace and
converting hostility to the lords into
good natured contempt The Atlantic
ocean beat Mrs Partington
During the 60 years nichipreceded
the Victorian -reign Sydney Smith waSj
aimosu me oniy prominenp jngiisn
clergyman who was interested in re
form movements and in his writings
for the Edinburgh Review he succeeded
by his wit in presenting the dullest ar
gument with freshnessgujp force Wit
with him was the vehicle which carried
good sense and wisdom He has been in
his grave 60 years and his reputation is
that of a clerical joker
He expected that a tablet would be
erected to his memory in St Pauls ca
thedral London where as canon he
was a favorite preacher at the close of
his life There i3 no memorial tablet
there nor is there one at either Foston
i or Combe Florey the two parishes
I where most of his work was done His
jokes have survived not only his writ
ings but his services as a reformer who
loved religious toleration and political
liberty as the breath of his life
What his career proves is that wit is
one of the most powerful weapons in
the world Without it he would have
exerted very much less influence as a
writer or a preacher in politics With
it his name has been handed down as
one of the great Englishmen of his
time
Ranch Life
It is so difficult to imagine a young
American voluntarily choosing a ranch
as a start in life that it is hardly worth
while trying to do so As a rule he
either thinks of the country as the place
where market vegetables come from
and Thanksgiving turkeys are raised
or else it represents to him a large and
expensive establishment at Lakewood
or some such place with a casino and
bowling alley and polo team attached
And as for the most part the American
does not play polo nor hunt nor shoot
nor fish with any real genuine en
thusiasm the latter view he takes is
scarcely more alluring than the former
Down deep in his heart he knows that
he would much rather be trying to run
an electric railway or a bank or build
ing bridges or losing money in Wall
street than to be doing any of those
things But the young Englishman is
entirely different He has always known
and enjoyed outdoor sports It is the
life he likes best and he imagines that
ranch life is first and foremost a sport
