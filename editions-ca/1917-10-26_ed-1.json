MACKEY SHEA.
Cupid has again invaded the
ranks of Paris bachelors and taken
away with him into double blessed
ness one of the worthiest members,
Dr. Robert Shea, of the People's
Pharmacy.
A few days ago Miss Agnes
Mackey, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Sam Mackey, of South Main street,
went to Covington to visit her
brother, Mr. John B. Mackey, and
Mrs. Mackey, and, incidentally, to do
a little shopping on her own account.
And then a day afterward Dr. Robt.
Shea, had an urgent business call
to Cincinnati, to lay in stocks, and
incidentally, too, to see if Miss
Mackey had arrived safely at her
destination.
As all such things go the inevita
ble resulted. Miss Mackey and Dr.
Shea are now Dr. and Mrs. Shea,
according to a telegram received
yesterday morning by Miss Sue
Jordan, which stated that Dr. Shea
and Miss Mackey had been married
in the Cathedral in Covington, by
Rev. Father Hanses. Mr. John B.
Mackey, the bride's brother, and
Mrs. Mackey, were the only attend
ants. Mrs. Shea is a young woman of
decided attractiveness and a worthy
helpmate for her husband. Dr.
Shea is a son of Mrs. James Fitz
gerald, of Winchester, and one of the
most popular young men in Pasis.
Dr. and Mrs. Shea, after a short
bridal trip, will return to Paris and
go to housekeeping.
