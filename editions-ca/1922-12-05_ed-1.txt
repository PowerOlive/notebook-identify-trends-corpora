THE N0RHAL SCHOOLS(Continued from Page 1)death rate of any county applyingfor the school in that district. Itspeople, are the equal of any in theState and will leave no stone unturned to make the school an honorto the Commonwealth.Much has been said at(out the influence of Judge Allie W. Young,of Morehead, in the selection ofthese two sites and the fact that heis attorney for some coal corporations is seized upon and featured atlength. 'Morehead is not in a mining district and the corporations represented by him do business in theBig Sandy. The coal barons thereendorsed Paintsville, so the stories,wilfully false as they are, must fallwith tTiPiT" rvwn -uroip'htAs a matter of fact, Judge Youngwas ?sick in a hospital in New Orleans and was not in Frankfort during the entire session. These factsare known to the Louisville press,yet they continue to republish themas if true. Of course, Judge Youngand Mr. Wells have done all theyhonorably could for their respectivetowns and who would have doneotherwise? With fifteen towns asking for the two schools, it is butnatural that much dissatisfactionshould arise.It is significant, however, to notethat all criticism instigated by thepress has been 'aimed at the fiveCommissioners appointed by SpeakerThompson. Two of those appointedby the Lieutenant Governor, thoughhonorable men, were members ofthe educational survey and recommended in writing thaf the proposednormal school in Eastern Kentuckybe located "probably" in the BigSandy. They thus prejudged theapplications of Morehead and WestLiberty. If Moreheadwas so repulsive to them, they hadan opportunity and in fact Mr.Wallen urged them to join him andname West Liberty, which couldhave been done with the sentiment on the commission alreadyoutspoken for West Liberty. Wemight also add here that West Liberty would have been an excellentlocation for such an institution.'There are many other things wecould mention, but lack of space forbids, and these are merely mentioned to show the unfair and rule-or-ruinattitude assumed by theLouisville press. The talk of aspecial session of the Legislature is,in our judgment, silly and time willvindicate the wisdom of. the Commission's actions.NOTICE TO WATER CONSUMERS.OWING TO THE CONTINUEDDROUGHT WE WILL BE COMPELLED TO LIMIT THE USE OFWATER TO SPECIFIED HOURS.WILL URGE ALL TO ECONOMIZEIN THE USE OF WATER AS MUCHAS POSSIBLE.PARIS WATER COMPANY,NEWTON MITCHELL, Supt.(24-tf)oAN APPROPRIATEGIFTCHRISTMASIgmmmmmmmmmmm" GLOVEDr MLJ IIIt holds. yourONESSAFEafterwards.,TRUST DEPARTMENTThat money and property you have -will keep your lovedones after you are gone if it is handled and conserved foithem as you are now doing.

And it is all done throughemphasizing a clever slogan: "Areal man likes a gift from a man'sOrder of St. Michael and St. store, in a man's package. Ask , theThere's only one place where"coming close" counts that's inhorseshoes.man'."About three weeks before Christmas this idea is struck every placeit is likely to be read. It is advertised on street car cards, run alongwith advertising cartoons in thelocal newspapers. Each .day thestore runs a new cartoon featuring"a real he-man," with the sloganabove the drawing the store's signature below.- Cards placed in thedisplay windows are tied up withthe street car and newspaper advertising.

Don't seem to know what to do with myself.r Have bean to every moving picture theater in the city and know just habout what's going on in the line of building.. - The other Saturday, I saw Cincinnati's navy burn up. It happened quite- a piece back, but as I haven't written since then, thought I'd mention it. Mythose boats made a blaze. Kind of a fire I've always wanted to see.Coming back from the water front, I noticed that about every child Ipassed had a toy balloon. No, there wasn't any circus in town, just somemore of Mabley's progressiveness. Every Saturday that's their way of giving the kiddies a treat., . Well, I thought I'd get some of those balloons to send along home to. the children. Here they are.s' It do beat all the way Mabley's put themselves out to be of service tooeoole. The other day Cousin bue asked me it ra mina paying tne gas dhu-2" Jl:;When I asked her where I'd take it, she said "Mabley's." Sure enough theyhave a department there to look after such a thing. This department is keptat their own expense and didn't cost me a cent more for the convenience.While I was in the store,' thought I might as well look around and getsome Christmas ideas. Fd seen a sign somewhere about doing ChristmasShopping early, so decided to grab time by the forelock.Saw any number of things that you all would like but didn't buy. I'd'rather wait until Mary can come down with me. Women like to have asay in such things. You know how they are.I found out one thing in looking around that you all might like to knowabout. Mabley's have Christmas Orders. When you can't think of anything tto give someone you want to give to, just give them one of these orders.Send on your money, get a Christmas order for that amount, and the personyou give it to can exchange it at the store for whatever they want. It's agreat idea, saves a lot of wear and tear on the brain.I'm playing nurse to-day so's Mary can run down street to buy afew things she needs. Kind of have a suspicion she's making tracks toMabley's to lay in a Winter's supply of clothes. You know how it is. Whenyou sit around, as she's been doing, you-kind of get to thinking over whatyou have and what you haven't until you get a hankering to just get outand buy up some store. Mary's not buying up Mabley's but right about now,I'll wager she's putting a dent in it.No doubt you'll get a letter all about clothes when she writes again.

If hebecame a steady beau, his picturesoon adorned the album, and thishelped to intrench him in favor.In those days an album was considered a standard gift appropriatefor any occasion.

But if it accomplishes nothing more than thefocusing of public attention uponthe inadequate teaching staffs ofour public schools, it will have morethan served its purpose.The State depends now upon itscitizens of legal age and over. Inten years it will be depending uponthe children of to-day. If thesechildren are not well taught, properly taught highly taught, the future citizens of America will be ignorant, unable to think, to plan, tocarry on this, our Nation, in its forward course.
