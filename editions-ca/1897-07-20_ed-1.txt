the Alleged Note of Secretary Sherman on the Sealing QuestionLondon July 16 The Daily Mailsays editorially Unless we get anarbitration treaty the day will comewhen -the unbridled verbiage of asmall section of American politicianswill magnify petty insult into a prettywar Secretary Shermans dispatch istoo undiplomatic for English ears andtoo hollow for American commonsense In the interests of humanitythe rumored alliance between Japanand Spain is desirable Our Yankeefriends want a little blood letting tobring them to a sensible internationalpolicy and this would best be done byany hands other than those of Englandv The Times in an editorial articlesays It is impossible to doubt theunnem icivy ox xne document it is amanifest attempt in offensive language to fasten upon England acharge of bad faith If this was notSecretary Shermans intention he hasshown himself singularly unfitted forthe delicate and responsible duties ofhis office If it was then the statement he recently made repudiatingthe charge of bad faith is deliberatelymisleading When he was first appointed to his present office doubtswere expressed as to the wisdom of thechoice If he really sent this dispatchthey will be fully confirmedThe Daily Chronicle thinksisbury would be justified in returningSecretary Shermans dispatch on theground that the British governmentdoes not receive communicationscouched in such terms If he doesnot it is because American diplomatists assume a certain liberty oflanguge not used by other countriesThe Chronicle proceeds to severelycensure the methods of American diplomacy and says The fact thattome nations like ourselves are fortunate in being favored with the presence of a diplomatist who is no less agentleman in public than in privatelife is not sufficient to remove this slurand dangerThe Standard says editorially Theappearance of Secretary Shermansdispatch has undoubtedly damaged theposition of the state department Itis preposterous that we should be accused of bad faith by men who navenotoriously refused to comply with animpartial award simply because it wasgiven against themThe Post in an editorial saysuEvery indication points to the certainty that Great Britain will be compelled to fight for her Existence againstthe United States as the Americangovernment believes that war can besafely begun In such a situation warcan not be averted by justice nor bygood will Our statesman must searchtheir consciences and make sure thatin any controversy that may be raisedtheir attitude is just and fair Theyshould concede so long as there is anyreasonable dcubt

secure from the British government additional measures of pro-vin fr the seals in ehring seaWhile he has not yet reported that theBritish have formally consented toparticipate in a conference with thisobject in view unofficial advices indicate that this is about to beaccomplished The ex secretary hassecured powerful assistance fromthe great London skin dresserswho handle all of the sealskins takenin the North Pacific and Behring seaand prepare them for use in garmentsThese merchants are advised fully asto the prospects of each years catchand the state of the sealeries so it isregarded as strengthening Gen Fosters cast very much when as he resports by cable to the state departmentthey affirm the correctness of the conclusions reached by the American expert Jordan and by inference rejectthose of the Canadian expert Thompson The issue between the expertsshortly stated was whether or not theseals are being exterminated underexisting regulationsThe American finding was in the affirmative If Gen Foster has pavedthe way for an international conference to protect the seals he has secured the most urgent of the demandsmade by our government but there isstill no evidence that the British governm ent is willing to enter into a modusyivendi to save the seals while the interminable talking of such a conference is going on and that was it issaid here one of the most importantobjects of his missionAt the Japanese legation here nocredence is given to the report cabledfrom London that the Spanish and Japanese governments have entered intoan alliance against the United StatesIt is pointed out that the Spanishnewspapers are nearly as bitter in theirdenunciations of the Japanese whomthey charge with giving material aidto the Philippine insurgents as theyare against this government for permitting arms and men to be sent toCuba It was stated in positive termsthat there was absolutely no truth inthe rumor and it was explained thatthe presentation of the Chrysanthemumdecoration to King Alfonso had nosignificance whatever so far as theUnited States Is concerned and doesnot imply any change in the relationsbetween Japan and SpainThe state department has no information whatever o any alliancebetween Spain and JapanFriday night the conferees were nonearer an agreement on the sugarschedule which continues to be thebone of contention than they werewhen

day offorcing an expression on the subjectfrom the senate in some way for itseffect on the conferees but this alsoon investigation proved to be littlemore than gossipWashington July 17 It is

changes but they ofcourse realize that they are helpless if the majority desire toreport the bill over their protest andin as much as the republican leadersof the house decided Sunday night togive two full days for the discussionof the report in the house they probably will acquiesce in the decision ofthe majority to make the report Monday All along the republican leaders have been disposed to allow butone day for debate in the house andwhile they still believe one day wouldbe sufficient after discussing the question Sunday night they decided moreto disarm the protests theminority would be sure to makeand the possible criticism that thereport was to be dragoned throughthe house to give two full days for debateacted upon by the house before it isconsidered in the senate The committee on rules will meet Mondaymorning and prepare a rule whichwill bring a vote on the report beforethe adjournment on Tuesday -Therules will be presented and adopted assoon as the conferees make their report probably soon afternoon Monday The debate will follow immediately The South Carolina dispensarybill willbe used to consume time untilthe report is brought in It is not believed that a single republican vote inthe house will be recorded against thereportThe programme in the senate ismuch more indefinite on account ofthe wide latitude allowed for debateand the absence of any preliminarymethod of bringing the report to a voteThe democratic senators it is safe topresume from their talk Sunday intend to assail the compromise on sugar to which the conferees agreed andto make a pretty stiff fight against therestoration to tne dutiable list of cotton bagging cotton ties burlaps etcwhich they succeeded with the aid ofthe populists and one or tworepublicans in placing on thefree list They also will make strongopposition to the restorationof white pine to the house rate of 200per thousand Some of the democraticsenators Sunday discussed the possibility of defeating the report in thesenate on the presumption that theymight be able to secure as many votesagainst the report as they did to placethese articles on the free list But noone imagines seriously that the reportis in any danger in the senate when itcomes to a final vote And moreoverthe most prominent of the democraticsenators freely expresses the opinionthat the fight in the senate though itmay be spirited will be brief Theybelieve a vote will be reached withinthree days in the senateSome of the opponents of the bill inthe senate hold that a motion to recommit with instructions as to separate items would be in order beforethe vote is taken on accepting the report as an entirety but the best parliamentarians in both branches saythat the practice is well settled andthat the vote must be taken first onthe adoption or rejection of the reportIt was learned Sunday that therewere some changes of verbiage in thesugar schedule and that the provisionfor the ratification of reciprocity treaties by the senate was retained in themodified reciprocity clause Amongthe other thing agreed to were thesenate rates on steel tubing and hollow billets used in the manufacture ofbicycle frames

the advantages of solitary exilebut he stood by his patient loyallyTo have advised him otherwisewould have been like preaching him asermon with the text left out Whatlie needs is out of door life and thatdoesnt mean a change to the dissipations of a summer or winter resortThe doctor paused and then addeddiplomatically And I count on yourhelp to make this possible you mustdissuade Mrs Thorndyke if she has anyidea of going with PhilipHelens faltering acceptance of thecondition imposed by this appeal endedthe interview and she left Dr Perevinsoffice with her trouble increased in inverse proportion to the success of hererrand It wanted but three days ofthe time that Philip had set for his departure and during this interval thedistress of the man who thought hisIcnowledge was definite was not morereal than that of the woman who knewnothing and feared everythingFrom the time when his mind hadclarified sufficiently to allow him tograpple with the conditions of the new- fioint of view Philip had begun to dreadbeeau seethe new1 point of view hadshown him among other things thenerher side of his love for her and hefotUid it good to look upon and tenderand self sacrificing as such love forsuch a young woman should be It wasa merciless aggravation of his miseryhe told himself that this knowledgecame so late that he had to look backat Helen from the brink of the grave asit were before he could realize what herlove was worth and what it would costto give t up He cried out against thepeculiar hardness of his lot in muchbitterness of spirit saying that his casehad no parallel Wherein he lost sightof the truth old as the complaint ofthe man of Uz that blessings are asbut the water for footwashing until thefountains are dried up and the wellsprings are no moreTalcing all things into considerationPhilip developed more strength of character than he had reason to expestwhen he went to pay the final visit tothe Morrissons He meant to play thepart of the-good-natured patient whoobeys his physicians orders withoutprejudice to a firm belief in their unimportance and this was not particularly difficult in the presence of twoelderly people who had known himfrom infancy If appearances went foranjtlhing there was certainly little evidence of ill health in the well knit athletic-lookingyoung man who leaneda gainst the mantel laughing and talking easily about his approaching de2arture He caught a glimpse of himselfin a mirror as he talked and hope almost struggled into life again It wasbut a passing moment of exaltationhowever for he knew well enough thatit was distance and the shaded light ofthe chandelier that effaced the fine linesof emaciation and turned the hecticflush into a ruddy glow of health Thiswa what he told himself in the unwritten

bullet proof hewould have smiled and said there wastime enough to prove all things butnow there was a sting in the pleasantrybarbed by the thought- that he shouldnever be able to refute this or any otherjust rejection upon his shortcomingsI deserve that he said Ive neverbeen anything but a droneEh whats that asked Mr Morrisson looking up from his bookThats what Ive been telling you eversince you left school Youvegot yourwork to do in the world my boj justthe same as the rest of us Im gladyoure finding it out before its toolateIt is too late said Philip quiettythe answer slipping out before discretion could shut the doorNonsense Why youve got the better part of your life before you yetPerhaps but that isnt what Imeant If one does the best he can fromthe time when he begins to learn themeaning of well doing he is only filling the measure of his reason for being and granting this there is nosuch thing as atonement for years ofidlenessThe old lawyer put down his book toapplaud the sentiment Better yetat this rate youll be an enthusiast before youre 30 Ive often wondered ifthe good old hard working stock ofthe Thorndykes would run to seed inone generationjThats one disadvantage

their fortunes in the west butihey soon driftedto Louisiana and settled among peoplewho spoke their native tongue Therethey became popular and every one lentthem books to read It was soon noticedthat they preferred stories of piracylawless love and vicious adventureOne day it was in 1896 the little village was startled by the news that aman had been horribly murdered Investigation showed that he had beensurprised in his house tortured to makehim reveal the hiding place of his treasure and then killed He was the richest man in the country roundabout andliving alone with the habits of a miserhe was known to have large sums ofmoney concealed on his premisesThe brutal crime roused the wholeneighborhood Large rewards were offered for the capture of the murderersBloodhounds and detectives were set atwork A poor tramp was arrested andwas barely able to prove an alibi to escape being lynched But all efforts totrace the assassins failedA few weeks after the crime the twoFrench boys showed their employer aletter from New Orleans offering themwork at higher wages Their emplo3rercongratulated them and advised themto go and they went But the sheriffhad some suspicion He found out atthe post office that the boys had received no such letter He went to NewOrleans and the boys were not to befound at the address they had givenHe tried to trace them but they had disappeared completelySome months after this two veryragged youths presented themselves ata plantation near the scene of the crimeand asked for work They showedsigns of great suffering and povertyThey were emaciated and ravenousThey were recognized as the same twobrothers who had left the neighborhood to go to New Orleans Thesheriffsoon heard of their return and arrestedthem on the charge of murder Overcome with terror they broke down andconfessed the deed It was a miserablestory of two guilty and haunted soulsThe face of the dead man followedus everywhere they said We couldntget away from itThe sheriff questioned them andfound out that in one of the dime novelswhich they were in the habit of reading a murderous plot had capturedtheir depraved fancy and1 enticed themto a career of crime This book toldhowan old miser was robbed and finallykilled and how the ruffians escaped toenjoy their booty They determined toreproduce the bloody description inreal life and spent some weeks in planning the fatal workThey traveled in luxury on the proceeds of their murderous theft Theytried every amusement every excitement but they could not be happy Invain- they endeWored to banish theagonized

comiavside and was the means of the firemendiscovering the main body of the firewhich for some time they had been eh tdeavoring in vain to locateThe smoke was pouring out of nearlyevery part of the building and al-though several entrances had beemmade it had been impossible to find theseat of the fire The chief in charge-ordered some windows on the thirdfloor to be opened up and a ladderwas accordingly raised and a firemanascended With the aid of a hook hepried open the iron shutters and lampin hand stepped in and disappearedHis companion upon the ladder wondering why he had so suddenly vanishedfrom sight peered in and found that hehad stepped into the elevator shaft thatwas directly under this window audhad fallen through to the basementHastily descending he alarmed theothers and forcing an entrance theymade their way to the cellar Herethey found their comrade in a sittingposition upon a bale of cotton jajcyJjBiunneu anu uuzeu irom xne snocKiorithe fall but otherwise uninjured Inhis hand he still held the wire handle ofhis lamp all that remained of it whilein front of him further in the basementblazing merrily was the fire they hadbeen endeavoring to find His fall hadled him directly to it On afterwardexamining the hatchway or shaftthrough which he had fallen they foundthat it had bars running diagonallyacross at each floor and in some marvelous way he had escaped each one inhis downward flight Charles T Hillin St NicholasNO POSTAGE STAMPSA Place Where Letters Are Sent Freerof CostThe letters that the Sikh police inSingapore send their kindred in Indiaand those that they receive in return vare almost invariably minus any post-age stamps One of their European of-ficers noticing this asked one of thermen the reason for this universalancb it was explained that the native postmans idea of honor concerningthe delivery of native letters are restricted to townsShould the epistle be addressed to a-V-manin a village some miles from theoffice the postman duly takes the let-ter and starts off but after going a lit-fie way slips into the nearest patch ofijungle and throws it away thus saving rhimself any further trouble about thematter It is curious to note that letters are seldom rifled The trouble ofwalking so far for a mere letter seemsto worry the native mind and no cu-riosity is aroused as to its pontentsIf the letter however is unstamped -theunhappy postman must deliver it atits destination as he is bound to pro-duce on liis return a receipt for the fineimposed for the omitted stampsThey bear no ill will to the postmanprobably they would do the same inhis place but they know the length off -hismethods accordingly Kansas CityWorldFislitlnjr BicyclesCapt Gerard of the French armynasformed an experimental company of 60jmen riding

effort in behalf of theyoung man His clothes fit him and thejgarmerits harmonize one with anotherso that his apparel regarded collective-ly is a work -of art Mr Sanford seldom wears colors or checks and peopleK are not compelled to turn and look atJiim a second timev Apparently he does not strive for effect It might be supposed that he ismerely fortunate in his selection ofwearing apparelAs a matter of fact Mr Sanford isstudent of clothes He learns fromservation that he must avoid certainkinds- of apparel if he is to commendliimself to people of taste He keepsinformed as to fashions also and follows those which are inexpensive and-which have been adopted by the menwho can devote most of their time todressing themselvesThe result is that Mr Sanford although receiving but a modest salaryis known as a good dresser He hasa small wardrobe but it is sufficient forone who cannot change clothes severaltimes a day and who is not under ob-ligations to have morning after-noon and evening clothes- Mr Sanford in the course of a conf versation the other evening announcedi his belief that men in Chicago are badly dressed because they lack taste Hestarted on the assumption that the menare dressed He said that so faras he had observed at least 99 per centmm-DOCTRINE OP SIMPLICITY SHOWNof th male adults walking the streetswere subject to severe criticismIt was sucTjrested to him

by dressingwell that a man is to be simply respectable or clean but I mean that he is tobe in style I mean that it doesnt costnowadays to dress so as to be inne as we say What does a man needthis summer A suit of light checkor gray stuff with a short coat cutclose to the body a pair of tan shoes asoft shirt a washable tie and a strawhat Is there anything expensive inthat make up Thats what the millionaire wears it he wants to be in styleland thats what man earning ten dolwrvmmmHmmii- v tiini i r r nr i Tiiirrnr r nWPijE5 M2514 v -lars a week can afford to buy Just atpresent all of our styles for everydaywear are sensible A man neednt wearjewelry or expensive waistcoats or fancy shirts If he does he simply showsthat he is lacking in taste The samething is true of womens dress Theshirt waist costume is simple and inexpensive and yet it makes every woman look like a blooming summer beautyWhy if a woman were a queen shecouldnt devise any costume more beautiful and approjjriateMr Sanford spoke with enthusiasmThe trouble is he said that people put too many ornaments on themselves A man with a tweed suit a single watch chain and a plain bow necktie is a swell But when he gets redshoes with blue tops striped trouserschecked coat and vest pink shirt rednecktie and a white hat with a blackband around it why hes a monstrosityAnd besides his clothes cost him twicewhat he should payYou know a hundred years ago thepeople of wealth and position wore thefancy costumes and the poor people ofthe servant class had to dress plainlyHow is it to day I board in a houseright across from a swell family out onthe South side The other morning Isaw the girl come out She wore asailor hat a light shirt waist a plainbelt a cloth skirt and English walkingshoes No frills no ornaments of anykind understand but she looked likean empress In a little while I saw themaid servant come out and say shehad a hat a foot high with a bushel offlowers on it and more jewelry andribbons and truck than you could getinto a show window Its the sameway with the men A fellow whosreally swell hasnt any jewelry on himHe carries a plain bamboo stick and apair of gloves maybe and the onlycolor in his make up will be his cravator his hatband Then youll see somerace track tout come along with a silver-headedcane a speckled vest a diamond pin in a flannel shirt four or fiveloops of a watch chain with a big charmon it and a pair of shoes that you woulduse for cracking ice Now it wouldntcost that fellow half as much for clothesif he would imitate the swell but yousee he thinks he has to decorate himself in order to impress people I cantake nine tenths of the men who arewalking the streets to day in tailormade clothes lead them into a department store or a ready made clothingplace and fit them out so that theyllappear better dressed than they arenow A man cant make himself welldressed by paying large prices Its allin the selection of clothes and the avoiding of contrasts For instance a mancan wear a light soft hat if his suit is ofone uniform color but if he has a lighthat of one shade a light pair of trousersof another shade and a fancy necktiecontrasting with both of these shadesthen the man is dressed like a jay Imake it a rule never to wear more thanone loud or fancy article If a man haaa quiet hat and a subdued suit of clotheshe can wear a gay cravat and it willlook all right If he has a dark coatand a dark pair of trousers he can weaxa fancy vest but if he changes to lighttrousers then he looks like a bunkomanMr Sanford was reminded by one ofthe awed listeners that the show windows were full of the gayest and fanciest patterns of shirts and cravatsWhy are they put on the market ifthey re not the real style he wasaskedThey are the style if used in moderation he replied Nearly all ofour styles in fancy shirts cravats golfstockings and the like are borrowedfrom the English These rainbowclothes are intended for outing wearA man who goes boating or wheelingor who plays golf has a right to wearthese loud clothes They are really uniforms the same as our baseball uniforms But the trouble is that abouthalf of the young men in Chicago havebought these peacock shirts and cravatsand are wearing them during businesshours The result is well you cansee for yourself They have come inwith an epidemic of loud hats andlow shoes and thewhole effect is something horrible -Mr Sanford spoke with much earnestness and one of the listeners whohappened to be wearing a mottled blueready made tie against a backround ofred and black shirt turned up

ofpoets and naturalists since the first onedawned upon the sight of man Thescientist has offered many theories f 6tthe birds long sustained power of flightbut it remains as much of a mystery asever An albatross will follow in aships wake for days sailing steadilyalong with no motion of the wingssilent and inscrutable as f ate Nbothcrmotion than an occasional veer of thewings when the bird desires to turn anangle is to be observed Despite thebirds marvelous power of sailing alongit is very hard for it to rise from thewaterThe home of the albatross is in theantipodes and Auckland islands Nolighthouse rears its head here and heavyfogs and treacherous currents swirlabout the place The land is rough andmountainous in the coast but inlandmarvelous flowers grow wTonderf ul asters marguerites lilies and gentiansand her millions upon millions of birdsmake their homes Among the coarseherbage the pure white head of thealbatross greets the eye The body islarger than that of the swan and itsexpanded wings measure 17 feet from tipto tip Its glory has departed for whilenothing can be grander than its flightover the ocean nothing is more ludicrous than its waddle on land Its onlysign of defense is to clap its beak in ahelpless manner for it cannot use itswingsThe nest is a pile of earth like a childssand castle and in the cup shaped topthe albatross lays one egg During theGO days the egg is hatching the motherdoes not stir from the nest for if shedid the seahawks would swoop down onthe egg and destroy it TheVoiingbirdis covered with fluffy down pure whitein color and silky as floss The nestlingis fed so assiduously that it becomesimmensely fat and rivals its parent inweight It is then deserted by theparents who wander- over the oceansometimes encircling the globe beforereturning to their homeThe most remarkable thing in the history of the albatross is that during theabsence of the parents the young nestling does not receive a mouthful of foodDuring the whole time sometimes fourmonths it lives on the fat it has accumulated In the open nest on a bleakhillside the young albatross is exposedall winter to sharp winds and the fiercestgales that ever rush across the oceanyet at the end of its fast the young birdis lively and in good condition Thereason the parent birds go away is notknown Their desire for flight is a nrystery for it is not the same as the migration of our northern birds to the southWhen the xarents return they unceremoniously bundle out the nestlingwhich has become a slaty gray in colorand set about repairing the nest Theyoung bird still stays around evincingin many pretty ways its fondness for itsparents and not till next year does ittake its first flight to sea in companywith its hard hearted father and mother Chicago NewsMAGNETISM IN VASESInstances Fonnd in SomeAncientRoman PotteryA curious instance of the stability ofmagnetism has -been found in some ancient lloman pottery Marked tracesof magnetization have been frequentlynoticed in Etruscan vases The obviousassumption was that the magnetizationmay have undergone some modificationduring the many centuries that haveelapsed since the vases were bakedDr Polgheraiter has settled this question by his observations on some vaseswhich were pieced together from scattered fragments taken from an excavation at Arezzo If the magnetizationof the baked clay had in any way altered since the vases were broken it isclear that the different portions fallingand lying around indiscriminatelywould have been differently affectedand when the bits were pieced togetheragain the broken vases would haveshown irregular magnetization Butthey were found to be as regularlymagnetized as those which have been excavated entire the opposite poles atthe mouth and base

against the workdone by dehorning clippers and preference expressed for the saw The clippers are all right if used according todirectionsThe balky horse and the swearingdriver are two nuisances where thehorse should have the monopoly Keepyour temper and in some wTay get thehorse to think of something else Assoon as you do he will goHard roads bang up the feet of thehorse and it is a question if hard roadsare not as wearing on the horse as softroads are But independent of thathard roads are desirable when they canbe had without too much burden to thefarmerThe 1200 pound hog and one manclaims to have one is not desirable orprofitable We once saw a pen of tenhogs where aggregate weight was 10000 pounds Hogs to weigli must bekept until the second year and that ofitself is not advisableSecretary Wilson thinks that hog-cholera can be abolished and willstudy the thing from A to Z It hasbeen studied already ut the more itis studied the worse it is Feed lesscorn breed from more

isIVocvCULTIVATING GRASSCrop Grown on the Average JatrmPays BetterThere is no part of farming at thepresent day so much neglected as themeadow and rthere is no crop grownthat pays better The general idea ofthe farmer is that the meadow does notrequire any cultivation or care Themeadow he says is all right Iseeded this field three or five years agobut I cannot see why I get so light acropIt is quite plain you have been robbing the land for three years and returning nothing Worse than thatyou have allowed the moss to cueep inand smother the roots which you haverobbedof their natural sustenance without returning anything to them or driving off the moss from the root boundgrass What kind of a corn crop wouldyou get if you did not cultivate it Toinsure a big crop of hay cultivate itHaul during the month of Decembersay from six to eight loads to the acreof barnyard manure and spread it whilehauling as evenly as you can with afork Then as early as you can get onthe meadow in March or as soon as thefrost is out and the ground dry enoughto get on with a team take a good harrow and drag it thoroughly and thencross harrow it You will imagine youare going to ruiu your meadow but youare simply loosening the roots and giving them a chance and when harvesttime comes you will find you not onlydid not injure your meadow but greatly increased your crop of grass andalso improved your ground This matter of cultivating grass is not a meretheory It is a principle proved to becorrect by actual trial with profitableresults In 18S2 Josiah Bagley ofSerena from a six acre meadow took12 loads of hay with no after eropThe following season he manured andcultivated the same six acres substantially as outlined above Some of hisneighbors laughed at him but aboutthe 10th of July 1883 he cut 19 loads ofgrass from these six acres and in thelast of September cut a second crop ofnine loads He says 1 am an advocate of cultivating grass J 3S Porter in Prairie FarmerTREATMENT OF MANGEIteeipe for n Salve Wliicli Is Said toProduce Good ResultsScurf or mange is sometimes difficultto cure It is caused by a small mitethat burrows in the skin and to get ridcf it the mite must be destroyed Thetreatment mentioned has such a tendency but as the application is mosteffective when applied locally there hasbeen too much reliance upon the internal treatment The sulphur internally is not harmful but it will taketoo much time the proeess is too slowsays Breeders GazetteIn the first place the pens and sleeping quarters should be frequently disinfected with crude carbolic acid andlime The surface affected should betreated with a salve made as followsFourrouncesofisalic3 liciacid thesameamount of hyposulphite of sodiumeight ounces of cosmoline or lard andif the lard is used a small amount ofbeeswax should be added to make themixture firm The cosmoline or lardshould be melted over a slow fire andwhile it is warm enough still to remaina liquid stir in the other ingredientsslowly until they are thoroughly mixedWhen cold apply to the diseased skin ofthe hogs every day until a cure is effected If many hogs are to be treatedthe amount should be doubled or quadrupled as the necessities may requireIn stirring in the salicylic acid careshould be used to keep the face awayfrom the mixture or the person whodoes the work will have a violent caseof sneezing The salve mentioned isgood for man or beast where there isa violent and persistent eruption ofthe skin Do not forget to disinfectthe pens and sleeping quarteresof theanimals The crude carbolic acid isgood but when applied strong enoughto be effective it is likely to make theanimals sickFOR CUTTING STALKSA Homemade Contrivance That DoesIts Work WellA cheap stalk cutter is made by taka sound log A
