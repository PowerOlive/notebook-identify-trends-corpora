SOLDIERS EN ROUTE SOUTH PASS
PARIS.
A special tram or twelve day
coaches, baggage and dining cars, en
route from a Northern cantonment
to a military camp somewhere in the
South, passed through Paris Wed
nesday morning.
The soldiers were members of a
Wisconsin regiment, largely re
cruited from Milwaukee, and were
full of enthusiasm and a desire to
"go over yonder" and get "Bill's"
goat. While many of them told of tho
nlace of their departure and their ul
timate destination, censor regula
tions forbid their publication as a
matter of public policy.
One of the men made the remark,
as he gazed woefully at a battered
old sign on a warehouse advertising
a certain well-known Milwaukea
liquid: "Well, fellows, that's as
close as we will ever get to it again
The furder South we goes the dryer
it gets."
Yesterday morning another long
train, a special, carrying twenty
coaches, passed through. Paris, from
a Northern point, its destination be
ing somewhere in the South. The
coaches were filled with a cheering,
enthusiastic crowd of soldiers, who
made themselves at home while
here.
On one of the coaches, a big plac
ard had been hung from one of the
windows. It bore the legend: "Oh,
People, We Are On Our Way To
Lick the Kaiser, And We Are The
Boys Who Can Do It!" One of the
soldiers, as he strol!e,d along the
platform, remarked, "From Paris,
Kentucky, to Berlin. That's where
we're going, suref" As the train
pulled out lusty voices were heard
singing, "Over There."

LIST OP THE SPECIES."
President Wilson, by a proclama

and Austrian women in the United
States under the same restrictions
as have prevailed for male enemy
aliens. These restrictions are appli

ears old, who have not been nat
uialized by their own or their male
relatives' 'declarations of citizenship.
German women have been-ordered to
leave the District of Columbia.
In line with the President's pol
icy of- leniency toward' male subjects
of Austria-Hungary, the women of
this nationality will be subject only
to the general danger of being in
terned if they prove dangerous.

PROJECT TO RESURFACE PROMI
NENT RESIDENCE STREET.
If plans now nelng considered by
residents of Duncan avenue, one of
the most prominent residence
streets in Paris, are completed, that
street will be resurfaced at an early
date with asphalt, in order to reduce
to a minimum the dirt and dust nui
sance, which is sure to prevail this
summer.
An expert engineer from LexingT
ton was here Wednesday and sub
mitted an estimate of the probable
cost of the work, with a view tor
having the property owners on that
street bear their proportionate share
of the cost of reconstruction. The
matter has been left in charge of
Mayor January. It is the opinion
that if the work is gotten under way
other streets in the city will take on
i like improvement in the same .man
ner. The material to be used has
been recommended on account of its
permanency.

THANKS THE NEWS TOR AID IN
LIBERTY LOAN SALE.
THE NEWS is in receipt of the
following letter from Mr. M. H.
Laundon, of Cleveland, Ohio, Pub-V
licity Secretary for the Liberty Loan
campaign :
"Cleveland, Ohio, April 15, 1918.
"Ed. THE NEWS, Paris, Ky.
"Dear Sir I want you to know
that I, personally, appreciate the
splendid and generous manner in
which you are handling Liberty.
Loan publicity not only local pub
licity, but that which I have sent ,to
you. There is no doubt that what
you have done has been of material
assistance in the sale of the Third
Liberty Loan Bonds.
"If you have any suggestions to
make I shall be more than glad to
have them.
"Very Truly Yours,
"M. H. LAUNDON,
"Publicity Secretary."
GREATLY' SURPRISED THAT ED-'
ITOR SHOULD HAVE MONEY.
In a recent issue of the Stanford
Interior Journal, Editor "Saufley has
the following regarding Editor Al
verson, who purchased the Wm. H.
Whaley farm near Paris;
"News comes that Editor Jesse M.
Alverson, of the Georgetown News,
has just bought a 330-acre farm in
Bourbon county for $68,000. This is
good news to the writer, who in his
earlier days in the newspaper busi
ness had Mr; Alverson on his pay
: oil, and who proved a most efficient
and reliable employe. As full of en
ergy as an egg is of meat, with the
ability to see as deep into the mill-J
stone as the man who picks it, 'and a j
hustler in all the word jmeans, we are
not surprised at his success, but we
never dreamed that he was getting
so rich $68,000! Just think of a
newspaper man having that much
money. Truly th day of miracles!
