friends. He was a conservative man,
and displayed no fanaticism on any
line. When he left Millersburg, for
nis new charge at Versailles he was
a. favorite of everybody. He was one
of the few men occupying the re
sponsible position he did who did not
make some enemies. His wife was
also as favorite with our people, and
was quite an advantage to Tiim in

- mend them to the good people of

new field of labor, as they have done
here.

ANOTHER VISITATION OE INFLU
ENZA T.TKELY.
From reports received by the State
Board of Health and from informa
tion gleaned from other reliable
sources, it appears that there will be
another visitation of the dreaded
plague, influenza, in this section this
fall. The disease has already ap
peared in a nujmber of mountain
counties, and is spreading in other.
directions.
Dr. A. T. McCormick, Secretary of
the State Board of Health, has writ
ten to local physicians stating that a
mild type of influenza is prevalent
in Illinois and at Straight Creek, in
this State. He urges that physicians
report any increase in mild, conta
gious summer colds. T-he Health
Board is arranging to manufacture
the Rosenow vaccine, which will be
furnished free. ,
With the experiences of the past
two years to guide us, every pre
caution should be taken by the peo
ple of Paris to prevent the disease
gaining a foothold here. We all per
haps remember that one of the very
first injunctions given out by the
health authorities was to warn the
public against the dirty and fifthy
habit of expectorating in' public
places, on the pavements, etc., one
of the most fruitful forms of spread
ing the disease. Let us heed the
warning, take tiple by the forelock,
and begin right now ' the work of
guarding against a possible spread
of the disease in aris.
A slight cold may be the forerun
ner of a severe case of influenza.
Don't neglect such, thinking it may
not amount to much. It may cause
you more serious inconvenience than
you think at present.. Be on your
guard and do everything in your
power to keep yourself in a healthy
condition, and ward, off the influenza
that sometimes leads to something
worse.
CONCRETING BEGUN.
The real work of concreting Main
street from Tenth to Fourteenth
street begun Wednesday... Owing to
the demand for labor in housing to
bacco and cutting corn in the county
the contractors were ' hampered
Monday, and the work was practi
cally suspended until Wednesday.
The grading and placing of the
concrete curbing and guttering has
been completed, and 'the work of
laying the concrete surfacing will be
rushed so as to have it completed
before freezing weather sets in.
Pleasant street from Second to
Twelfth street, will be the next
scene of improvement work, v

KENTUCKY CROP PBOSPECTS.
Kentucky's crop prospects now in
dicate the production of 424,490,
000 pounds of tobacco compared to
prospects July 1 for 442,178,000
pounds, and 427,500,000 pounds pro
duced last year, according tb the
Government crop report issued by H.
F. Bryant, field agent for the U. S.
Bureau of Estijmates. Good growing
weather now, however, is likely to
increase this estimate very much, be
fore the tobacco is all cut, as there
was a large acreage of late tobacco
that is growing fast now and the
total acreage is considerably greater
than last year. The United States
crop of tobacco is now estimated at
1,279,000,000 pounds compared to
1,340,000,000 pounds produced last
year.
The Kentucky corn crop is estimat
ed at 79,682,000 bushels because of
drouth. Last year's cropt was 93,
600,000 bushels. Oats are estimated
at 9,500,000 bushels, compared to
9,789,000 bushels last year;, potatoes
4,687,000 bushels compared to, 5,
625,000; sweet potatoes 1,125,0.00
bushels compared to 1,235,000; bar
ley 190,000 bushels compared to
196,000; apples 2,190,000 bushels
compared to 3, 780, 00 0X; and sorghum
for sirup 2,631,000 gallons compar
ed to 2,826,000 gallons made iast
year. .
Hogs on hand for fattening in
Kentucky are 2 per cent, more "nu
merous than this time last year, and
5 per cent more numerous than usu
al. Unless the corn crop turns out
better than now expected, this is
likely to prove quite a problem vf or
many farmers who had planned to
feed hogs this fall. In the United
States there are now 4.6 per cfent.
less hogs than 1918. Wool produc
tion in Kentucky this sujmmer was
3,211,000 pounds compared to 3,058,
000 pounds last year.
Condition -of other crops in Ken
tucky is: Buckwheat 80 per cent;
clover for seed 85; millet 75; pasture
field beans 70; broom corn 75; cab
bage 65; onions 85; tomatoes 75;
grapes 65; pears 36.

EXPERIENCE.

Almost every newpaper man has
at some time had to contend with
those philanthropic individuals who
want to use their space for self-advertising
and who are willing to
thrown out a little "sop" like a small
order for job work in exchange for a
vast amount of free advertising.
Editor Warren Fisher, of the Car
lisle Mercury thus details an expe
rience which has had its counterpart
in many a newspaper office:
"A farce, which proved very en
joyable and quite remunerative to
the promotors, was staged here last
week. The lady who staged the pro
duction, left with one hundred dol
lars, net, for her week's work. The
local society, for whose benefit the
farce was given, cleared about the
same amount. The Mercury carried
a fifteen inch advertisement, the
program, all in small type and hard
to set. For this service, we charged
$3.00 and were inforined when set
tlement was (made, that this was the
only 'hold-up' the lady professional
had encountered here. Notwith
standing the fact that the assertion
that an overcharge was made will
be recognized as absurd by any fair
minded person, we wish to take this
opportunity to do a little sermoniz
ing. The space in a newspaper is its
stock in trade and its principal stock.
The subscription price is usually so
low, that the margin of profit is neg
ligible. So, as a newspaper, as well
as any other business, must have
money to pay for labor and materi
als, that money must come from. the
sale of advertising space. Conse
quently we have no space to give
away, although it is a constant fight
with us to convince people of this
fact. Were we to print all the stuff
that we are requested to pFint, 'to

FOOD AGITATION BEGINNING TO

Prices are beginning to turn down

ered momentum sfneient to affect
purchases being made for ipmmediate
use, according to reports to the De

Attorney General Palmer, who ask

the cost of living, the outcome of
which railroad employes have been,
requested to await before pressing
demands for wage increases, said all
the government wanted was a fair
chance to show what could be done
to take artificial inflammation out
of the market. He said officials were
well .pleased with the success so far
attained and that cupnulative results
were expected when Congress enacts
amendments to the food control law
by which criminal penalties can be
imposed on profiteers and hoaders.
"We hope the public will begin to
