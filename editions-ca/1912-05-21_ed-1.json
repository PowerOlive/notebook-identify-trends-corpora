SATURDAY.
In a contest lacking in interest Mays
ville won from Paris Saturday after
noon by the score of 5 to ?. The River
men sewed up the arae m the fifth
inning and took a lead which the Bour
bonite3 with all their efforts could not
overcome.
Tne local? started tne contest in a
manner which eave every evidence of
resulting in the defeat of the visit
ors, due tneir lead was ovenaicen in
the fourth inniner, when with two men
on bases, Sanforcf, the Maysvill pitch
er, planted tne can over tne nign cen-
tertield fence for a home xun, scoring
the two runners before hirr.
Paris was not lacking in the number
of hits but the men were unable to
connect saf-ly when safeties were
"eeded, and as a result several opporrj
nties to score were lost. A stunid
move on the Dart of Manager Lewi
in the tighlh inning, when with the
bases full, and one out he yanked
Campbell, who had been hitting the
ball successfully, out of the game, and
substituted Dunlan, who Sanford
wonted for. three straight strikes.
The long running catches of Welsh
and Dunlap featured the contest, the
former goinz to the left held foul line
and Dulling down a long drive from
Locke's bat, and the latter made a sen
sational running catch of Sanford's
long fly in the eighth. The score:

Paris took two games from the Law
makers Sunday afternoon, the first by
score oi Jb to 0 and the last game 6 to
5. The first contest was long drawn
out, and a shabby exhibition. The
locals hit Langfitt freely and Myers
who was sent to the mound in the fifth
was as wild as a March hare, and the
locals found no difficulty in getting
runs around. Disgusted with the ner
formance of his pitcher Manager Fish
er took the mound in the eighth and
finished the game. After the fifth in
ning Blankenship was invincible.
Woods esseyed to pitch the second

the third by Hauser, who finished the
game in grand style.

o! Steuben Prop
- erty.
Chas. A.. McMillan purchased yester
day of William Steuben, colored a
small strip of hi9 property on Ciaat
Main street, adjoining what in known
as the Cottontown briJge, for the sum
ot $300. Mr. McMi'lan in making the
purchase was acting for the citizens
and property owners of East Paris- and
the property was nought for the pur
pose or. removing a portion ot tne
building to afford ample space for the
construction of a foot bridge adjoining
the structure over Stoner creek.
At the last meeting of the Fiscal
Court a number of citizens represented
by Mr. Brink Renick petitioned the
court to allow the construction of a
foot bridge in connecton with the road
bridge which doe not afford a foot
passage, and the matter was taken up
by the court to determine whether the
bridge was the property of the city or
the county, and also as to the safety
of the bridge to withstand the extra
weicht of a foot passatre which would
necessarily be placed upon it.
ine purchase of the small portion of
the Steuban I property is an assurance
that the bridge will be built immedi
ately and at the expense of the prop
erty owners in East Paris, who are
desirous of a better passage than that
afforded by the. present structure.
; Curious Lort.
It has been remarked as a curious
circumstance that Bonaparte and Wel
lington were bora in the same year,
and that Burns and Kogg, the Scotch
poets, were both born on Jan. 25; but
it is more remarkable that the' two
greatest dramatic poets of modern Eu
rope, Shakespeare and Cervantes, both
died on the same day in the same
year, April 23, 1616. It is further re
markable that Shakespeare, like the
great Raphael and Sobieski, died on
the anniversary of his birth. From

Cows Tried for Murder.
Old documents of the middle ages
tell us of numerous cases where ani-r
mals were put on trial for serious of
fenses charged against them. For ex
ample, in 1370 three cows were tried
for having killed a boy; the whole
herd 'were arrested as accomplices.
All were discharged but the guilty
three, these being condemned to be
executed. The sentence was pro
nounced by the duke of Burgundy.

Dikes Foiled a Conquest.
The University of Leyden in Hol
land was founded in 1575 as a monu
ment to the gratitude for the nation's
deliverance from a foreign enemy. The
Spaniards invaded the Dutch country
in 1574 and laid siege to the town of
Leyden, but the people held out and
refused to- surrender. The tactful
puncture of one of the dikes saved the
nation, driving the Spaniards away.
Most Powerful Poison.
The most powerful poison known is
reported to have been extracted by a
German chemist from the seeds of the
ricinus, the familiar castor oil plant,
and has been attracting much atten
tion on account of its remarkable
properties. Its power is estimated to
be so great that a gram about a thir
tieth o an ounce would kill a mil
lion and a half guinea pigs.

Testimonial.
A grocer enjoys the unenviable no
toriety of selling the worst goods in,
the district, but he has not recovered
from the shock he got the other day
when a little girl came into the shop
and said.: "My ma sent me for two
pounds of your best tea to kill rats
with, and a pound of finest ham, and
mi;-:d and cut it in good thick slices,
for it is to sole and heel my dad's
boots."'

Style changes. In the old day3 a
murderer always ate a hearty break
fast of ham and eggs just before go

Youths Turn in Fire Alarm.
Two young colored boys, scarcely
seven years of age, were responsible
for the alarm that was turned "in yes
terday about noon from Box 15. The
fire department responded to the call
and when they arrived at the location
of the fire alarm box the firemen notic
ed two colored boys hurrying- off up
Vine street. After a short chase they
were caught and taken to the fire de
partment headquarters where they
were given a thorough lecture. The
boys'were badly frightened and were
glad to get away on the promise never
to tamper with fire alarm boxes again.
