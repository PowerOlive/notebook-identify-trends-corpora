The graduating class of JM. F. C.
qut on the three-act drama, "Endym
don," a Greek play, at the chapel of the
college Monday evening to a crowded
Chouse. The work was under the di
Tection of Miss Martin, instructor in
expresssion, and 'was well done. Sev
eral of the young ladies were compell
ed to take male parts, as there was not
a. man m the cast, and played them
-yery creditably. A good musical pro
gram was also rendered.
The stage was beautiful, as was the
setting, banked with flowers appropri
ate to the scenes. Tuesday morning
at 10:30 the sixty-third anual com
mencement exercises of the college
were held in the college chapel. The
gjuests "began assembling early, and by
"the.apointed time the spacious audito
rium was well filled, the audience be
ing made up largely of beautiful, hand
somely gowned ladies.
At the appointed time the gradu
ating class, with escorts preceded by
their lady ushers moved slowly down
the center aisle of the chapel to sweet
music rendered by Miss Nannie Louise
Best, and took their places upon "the
stage. The mvocatiom was delivered
"by Rev. J. B. Harris, of Lexington,
"who also delivered the baccalaureate
sermon. Mr. Harris is a young man,
Jpastor of the Epworth.M. E. church of
Xeexington, and from the character of
Ixis work before this class there is
"unquestionably a bright future before
3iim. .
Miss Alma Duke Jones rendered the
jMendlessohn wedding march, after
"which came a vocal solo by Miss Floy
Barnes, both of these young ladies
Ibeing members of the class of 1913.
T)r. C. C. Fisher, President of the col
lege, in a brief and appropriate address
delivered 'the diplomas, read the hon
ors, and made some announcements
:for the coming year. There was pro
longed applause when he announced
that Miss Nannie Louise Best would
"be in charge of the musical depart
ment for next year. It will be re
membered that Miss Best had resign
ed her position at the close of this
terjn. to the regret of the entire
-school and her many friends in Mil
lersburg. It was not until within a
few minutes before the time for the
exercises to begin that she consented
ot take the work for another year.
Miss Louise Myall, of Millersburg,
was first honor pupil, while Miss Hel
en Asbury, of Dover, Ky., received the
second honors. The graduating pap
ers of the class are said to be the
Iest in many years.
At 12:15 Rev. J. B. Harris pro
nounced the benediction and the work
of the Milersbure: Female College I
closed until next September, many of
the young ladies and faculty leaving
on the afternoon and evening trains.

ed in the loose leaf tobacco ware
house at the opera house Saturday at
3 p. m. Let everybody be present.
We can not afford to let this fall
through with. It means much to the
people of Millersburg and surrounding
community. We especially insist
on the 'merchants ' and business men
of Millersburg to come to the rescue
of the enterprise. Where the tobacco
is sold money will be spent. If we
drive this to other markets as we
have done heretofore, do not grumble
because our farmers spend a large
part of their surplus away from
home. Not only this, but it will give
employment to our laboring people, a
great many of whom are now working
during the season at Paris, Cynthi
ana, Carlisle and other places.. Some
few of our merchants have not con
tributed a cent toit. Such selflshne ss
cannot exist and prosper. They all
want the house, the market and
their share of the patronage there
from, and it is no more than just
that they should bear their part of
the burden. Saturday will tell the
story, the company will organize or
the plans will be given up. It is
largely in the hands of the mer
chants of Millersburg coming to the
rescue. If you fail in this do not
grumble when our people go else
where to buy. You will be largely re
sponsible in driving them away from
their home market by not encourag
ing ' a home enterprise, which will
keep everything at home. We do
not want any one to take out any

Tuesday evening about 7 o'clock
Millersburg was visited by a heavy
electrical storms, folowed by a heavy
downpour of rain. Quite a number of
electric light and telephone were put
out of commission. The large stock
barn of Mr. W.. D. Mclntyre at the
head of Trigg avenue, was struck by
lightning, tearing a place about two
feetsquare in the roof. However, no
one was very near the place at the
time. A small spark was started in
the shingles which smouldered all
night and was not discovered until
Wednesday morning by a hand. At
the time they entered the barn it was
full of smoke, and was in the act of
breaking 'out into a full blaze. The
fact that the roof was wet prevented
this earlier. There were several
head of mules, farm utensils, wag
ons and fed-stuff in the barn. A num
ber of other stables and- small- build
ings were near the property and had
it gotten under headway it would
have in all probability proved a seri
ous fire. This property adjoins the
M. M. I. grounds. The M. M. I. cadets
were among the first on the scene
after the alarm was given, and the
fire was entirely out before the en
gine arrived. The loss to the proper
ty was but slight and was repaired
at once. The property was well in
sured.
