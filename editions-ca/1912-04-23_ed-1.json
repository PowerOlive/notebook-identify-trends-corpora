Paris Team Defeats The Climax. I Ordered to Turn Over F. 4 C.
At White Park Sunday afternoon the
Paris team administered a severe trim
ming to th Climax team of Cincinnati,
winning by a score of 9 to 4. Only a
small crowd witnessed the contest
which was snappy for the first five
sessions, but which during the closing
rounds had an air of slowness about it.
Manager Lewis sent Pete Wood to
the mound for the locals and he went
the entire route in fine style, showing a
slight weakness in but two innings,
and then steadied himself and pitched
winning ball.
At no time during the game were the
locals in any serious danger of defeat,
and were aided materially in the run
getting by the eight errors piled up
against the visitors. Four of the six
hits of the visitors went for extra
bases.
The game put up by thft Paris team
was quite an improvement of their
former efforts in the exhibition games
so far this season. Harrel and Good
man, two of last year's aggregation
were in the lineup and played with
their old-time dash, that renewed the
hopes of the fans. The score.

NOTES.
Woods fields his position in a style
that is pleasing to the fans, and occa
sions very favorable comment.
Campbell and Fenzell in the outfield
are very fast but both seem to be
weak at. the bat, quite an essential
with an outfielder. "
Out of five times up Dunlap secured
only one safe drive. He fielded his
position fairly well on this occasion and
a few games should improve him.
The fans were pleased to see Danny
Harrell on the job again playing with
the same old energy. He scored two
runs secured on a safe drive.
Guiels, the latest arrival, was on
second base. He batted at the highest
mark in the contest Sunday, getting
two hits out of two times up, but they
were of the scratch order.
The absence of team work on the
part of the locals probably hurt their
chances for a larger score, but it is to
ba hoped this will come before the
championship season opens.
The Bourbonites will meet the Lex
ington' Athletics this afternoon at
"White Park at 3:15 oclock and to
morrow afternpon the Georgetown
College team will be here for a game.,,
Popkin looks to be the goods on the
first station, and the big fellow played
the position like a veteran. He can
hit the ball, too, and ripped out a
corking two-bagger in the seventh.
In the seventh Goodman sent a
stinging drive into the right garden
and easily reached third on the hit.
His presence on the team is an assur
ance of a good, strong hitting and fast
outfielder.
Woods, who went the entire contest
on the mound for the locals showed up
extremely well considering the amount
of work he has had. He fanned eleven
of the ooposing batsmen and allowed
but six hits. The game should improve
him wonderfully.

Sunday evening, taking for their subject
the fact surrounding the destruction of

services were largely attended, and the
discourses were beautiful and highly en
joyed. Saturday evening Miss Walker's class
in expression presented a three-act
drama, "The Heroine of Virginia" at
the M. F. C. auditorium to a large audi
ence. The play was well executed and
each of the young ladies did their parts
well. The plot, was strong and one
beauty was that the cast was made up

appreciated by the large audience.
