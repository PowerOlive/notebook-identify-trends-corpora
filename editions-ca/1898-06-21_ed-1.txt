the crest of the hills defendingSantiago harbor since the bombardment Thursday morning shows thatthe American gunners spread wreckand ruin everywhere Some of thebatteries were demolished beyond repair The vultui es which circled onlevel wings over the hills as thick asswallows around ajhimney for hoursafter the firing ceased furnishedgruesome evidence of the fatalityamong the Spanish soldiers Hundreds of troops could be seenfrom the ships digging in moundsof earth piled up by the explosions ofthe projectiles from the heavy gunsfor bodies while their heads werefanned by the wings of the blackscavengers of the battlefield Therewere two spots one on the east andthe other on the west of the harhorentrance which were denuded of thefoliage The hill tops seem literallyblown away These marked the placeswhere the 200 pound charges of guncotton blown by the Vesuvius landedBut the most ominous token of deathflew from Morro castle The saffronflag of Spcin was half masted for several hours The significance of thisis not known It is not customary tohalf mast flags but possibly someSpanish leader was killed by the heavyfire of our guns though some officersof the squadron believe that the flagwas half masted as a notification tothe Americans that Lieut Hobson andhis brave men were deadIf such is the case they must havebeen wantonly murdered The Spanish might seek to lay their death to thebombardment but not a shot from theAmerican ships struck the fortressNeither Adm Sampson nor Commodore Schley believe that Lieut Hobson and his party have been killedWe have 17 prisoners taken at Guantanamo including a lieutenant forreprisals or exchangeThere was evident demoralizationamong the Spanish troops during thebombardment Officers could be seenwith drawn swords driving the men tothe guns but even then they could notbe forced to stay so long as our gunswere directed at them The fifteenminufes night work of the Vesuviushad shattered their nerves It is believed by some that the 13 inch projectile fired from the Texas which jivasreported to have exploded the powdermagazine in- one of- the western batteries did not fall in the battery butwent beyond and blew up one of theships in the harborA dramatic incident of the bombardment was the act of a Spanish officerwho bravely ran along the parapetunder a heavy fire encouraging hismen to stand by their guns Shot andshell rained about him and after oneterrific explosion he was seen no moreand the parapet had disappeared Heeould not have escaped deathFrom the fore top of the Brooklyn2900 yards distant the men in thegrounds could be noticed but a minute later dust and flying debris wouldtake their places and when the smokecleared away only a spot of red earthcould be seen guns and gunners hadbeen swept away It was the mostdeadly and destructive bombardmentof the war thus far Scarcely a shotfrom the big guns of the squadronwent astray The aim of our gunnerswas superb and not only were thecoast forts annihilated but the batteries on Cayo Smith up the harborwere destroyedHad all the ships used smokelesspowder as did the New Orleans therewould remain no signs of guns or fortifications to indicate that there hadever been any defenses thereThere were no casualties in the fleetalthough the ships held a fixed position as if inviting the Spaniards to fireat them The half stripped ships gunners

STEVEHSOU5PABT VCHAPTER XXHI ContinuedI dropped upon the thwart againnone too soon for I was near overboardI could see nothing for the moment butthese two furious encrimsoned facesswaying together under the smokylamp and I shut my eyes to let themgrow once more familiar with thedarknessThe endless baliad had come to anend at last and the whole diminishedcompany about the campfirehad brokeninto the chorus I had heard so oftenFifteen men on the dead mans chestYo-ho-ho and a bottle of rumDrink and the devil had done for the restYo-ho-ho and a bottle of rumI was just thinking how busy drinkand the devil were at that very momentin the cabin of the Hispaniola whenI was surprised by a sudden lurch of thecoracle At the same moment sheyawed sharply and seemed to changeher course The speed in the meantimehad strangely increasedI opened nry eyes at once All roundme were little ripples combing overwith a sharp bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent The Hispaniolaherself a few yards in whose wake Iwas still being whirled along seemedto stagger in her course and I saw herspars toss a little against the blacknessofthenightnayasIlooked longerV I made sure she also was wheeling tothe southwardJ I glanced over my shoulder and myeaxtjumped against my ribs Thererright behind me was the glow of thes campfire The current had turned atAright angles sweeping round alongvVithit -the -tall schooner and the littledancing coracle ever quickening everbubbling higher ever muttering louderat went spinning through the narrowsfor the open seaSuddenly the schooner in front of megave a violent yaw turning perhapsthrough 20 degrees and almost at thesame moment one shout followed another from on board I could hear feetpounding on the companion ladder andI knew that the two drunkards had atlast been interrupted in their quarreland awakened to a sense of their disasterI lay down flat in the bottom ofthat wretched skiff anddevoutly commended my spirit to its Maker At thend of the straits I made sure we mustfall into some bar of raging breakerswhere all my troubles would beendedspeedily and though I could perhapsbear to die I could not bear to lookupon my fate as it approachedSo I must have lain for hours continually beaten to and fro xipon thebillows now and again wetted with flyingsprays and never ceasing to expectdeath at the next plunge Graduallyweariness grew upon me a numbnessiin occasional stupor fell upon my mindeven in the midst of my terrors untilsleep at last intervened and in my seatossed coracle I lay and dreamed ofhome and the old Admiral BenbowCHAPTER XXIVTHE CltiriSEjpF THE CORACLEIt was broad day when I awoke andfound myself tossing at the southwestend of Treasure island The sun wasup but was still hid from me behindthe great bulk of the Spy glass whichon this side descended almost to thesea in formidable cliffsHaulbowline nead and IMizzeninastHill were at my elbov the hill bare anddark the head bound with cliffs 40 or50 feet high and fringed with greatmasses of fallen rock I was scarce aquarter of a mile to seaward and itwas my first thought to paddle in andlandThat notion was soon given overAmong the fallen rocks the breakersspouted and bellowed loud reverberations heavy sprays flying and fallingsucceeded one another from second tosecond and I saw myself if I venturednearer dashed to death upon the roughshore or spending my strength in vainto scale the beetling cragsNor was that all for crawling together on ilat tables of rock or lettingthemselves drop into thesea with loudreports I beheld huge slimy monsterssoft snails as it were of incrediblebigness two or three score of them together making the rocks echo withtheir barkingsI have understood since that theywere sea lions and entirely harmlessBut the look of them added to thedifficulty of the shore and the highrunning of the surf was more thanenough to disgust me of that landing--place I felt willing rather to starveat sea than to confront such perilsTHE BOURBON NEWS PAEIS EX TUESDAY JUNE 21 1898In the meantime I had a betterchance as I supposed North of Haulbowline Head the land runs in a longway leaving at low tide a long stretchof yellow sand To the north of thatagain there comes another cape Capeof the Woods as it was marked upon thechart buried in tall green pines whichdescended to the margin of the seaI remembered what Silver had saidabout the current that sets northwardalong the whole west coast of Treasureisland and seeing from iny positionthat I was already under its influence Ipreferred to leave Haulbowline Headbehind me and reserve my strength foran attempt to land upon the kindlierlooking Cape of the WoodsThere was a great smooth swell uponthe sea The wind blowing stead andgentle from the south there was nocontrariety between that -and the current and the billows rose and fell unbrokenHad it been otherwise I must longago have perished but as it was it issurprising how easily and securely mylittle and light boat could ride Oftenas I still lay at the bottom and kept nomore than an eye above the gunwaleI would see a big blue summit heaving close above me yet the coraclewould but bounce a little dance as if onsprings and subside on the other sideinto the trough as lightly as a birdI began after a little to grow verybold and sat up to try my skill at paddling But even a small change in thedisposition of the weight will produceviolent changes in the behavior of a coracle And I had hardly moved beforethe boat giving up at once her gentledancing movement ran straight downa slope of water so steep that it mademe giddy and struck her nose with aspout of spray deep into the side of thenext waveI was drenched and terrified and fellinstantly back into my old positionwhereupon the coracle seemed to findher head again and led me softlv as before among the billows It was plain shewas not to be interfered with and atthat rate since I could in no way influence her course what hope had I leftof reaching landI began to be horribly frightenedbut I kept my head for all that Firstmoving with all care I gradually bailedout the coracle with my sea cap thengetting mj eye once more above thegunwale I set myself to study how itwas she managed to slip so quietlythrough the rollersI found each wave instead of the bigsmooth glossy mountain it looks fromshore or from a vessels deck was forall the world like any range of hills onthe dry land full of peaks and smoothplaces and valleys The coracle left toherself turning from side to sidethreaded so to speak her way throughthese lower parts and avoided thesteep slopes and higher toppling summits of the waveWell now thought I to myself itis plain I must lie where I am and notdisturb the balance but it is plain alsothat I can put the paddle over the sideand from time to time in smooth placesgive her a shove or two toward landNo sooner thought upon than doneThere lay on my elbows in the mosttrying attitude and every now andagain gave a weak stroke or two to turnher head to shoreIt was very tiring and slow work yetT did visibly gain ground and as wedrew near the Cape of the Woodsthough I saw I must infallibly missthat point I had still made some hundred yards of easting I was indeedclose in I could see the cool greentree tops swaying together in thebreeze and I felt sure I should makethe next promoBotory without failIt was high time for I now beganto be tortured with thirst The glowof the sun from above its thousandfold reflection from the waves the seawater that fell and dried upon me caking my very lips with salt combinedto make my throat burn and my brainache The sight of the trees so nearat hand had almost made mc sick withlonging but the current had soon carried me past the point and as the nextreach of the sea opened out I behelda sight that changed the nature of mythoughtsEight in front of me not half a mileaway I beheld the Hispaniola undersail I made sure of course that 1should be taken but I was so distressed for want of water that I scarceknew whether to be glad or sorry at thethought and long before I had cometo a conclusion surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I coulddo nothing but stare and wonderThe Hispaniola was under hermainsail and two jibs and the beautifulwhite canvas shone in the sun likesnow or silver When I first sightedher all her sails were drawing she waslving a course about northwest and Ipresumed the men on board were going round the island on their way backto the anchorage Presently she beganto fetch more and more to the westward so that 1 thought they had sighted me and were going about in chaseAt last however she fell right into thewinds eye was taken dead aback andstood there awhile helpless with hersails shivering-Clumsy fellows said I they muststill be drunk as owls- And I thoughthow Capt Smollett would have set themskipping tMeanwhile the schooner graduallfell off and filled again upon anotherlack sailed swiftly for a minute orso and brought up once more deadin the winds eye Again and againwas this repeated To and fro up anddown north south east and west theHispaniola sailed by swoops anddashes and at each repetition endedas she had begun with idly flappingcanvas It became plain to me thatnobody was steering And if so wherewere the men Either they were deaddrunk or had deserted her I thoughtand perhaps if 1 could get on board1 might return the vessel to her captainThe current was bearing coracle andschooner southward at uv equal rateAstfor the laters sailing it was so wildand intermittent and shehung eachtime so long in irons that she certainly gained nothing if she did not evenlose If only 1 dared to sit up and paddle I made sure that 1 could overhaulher The scbeme had an air of adventure that inspired me and the thoughtof the water breaker beside the forecompanion doubled my growing courageUp I got was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray buttiris time stuck to my purpose and setmyself with all my strength and caution to paddle after the unsteered Hispaniola Once I shipped a sea so heavythat I had to stop and bail with myheart fluttering like a bird butgraduafly I got into the way of the thing andguidedmy coracle among the waveswith only now and then a blow uponher bows and a dash of foam in my faceI was now rapidly gaining on theschooner I could see the brass glistenon the tiller as it banged about andstill no soul appeared upon her decksI could not choose but suppose shewas deserted If not the men werelying drunk below where I might batten them down perhaps and do what Ichose with the shipFor some time she had been doing theworst thing possible for me standingstill She headed nearly due southyawing of course all the time Eachtime she fell off her sails partly filledand these brought her in a momentright to the wind again I have saidthis was the worst thing possible forme for helpless as she looked in thissituation with the canvas cracklinglike cannon and the blocks trundlingand banging on the deck she still continued to run away from me not on lywith the speed of the current but bythe whole amount of her leeway whichwas naturally greatBut now at last I had my chanceThe breeze fell for some seconds verylow and the current gradually turningher the Hispaniola revolved slowlyround her center and at last presentedme her stern with the cabin windowstill gaping open and the lamp over thetable still burning on into the dayThe mainsail hung drooped like a banner She was stock still but for thecurrentFor the last little while I had evenlost but now redoubling my effortsI- began once more to overhaul thechaseI was not a hundred yards from herwhen the wind came again in a clapshe filled on the port tack and was offagain stooping and skimming like aswallowMy first impulse was one of despairbut my second was toward joy Boundshe came till she was broadside on tome round still till she had covered ahalf and then two thirds and thenthree quarters of the distance thatseparated us I could see the wavesboiling white under her forefoot Immensely tall she looked fo me from mylow station in the coracleAnd then of a sudden I began tocomprehend I had scarce time to thinkscarce time to act and save myselfI was on the summit of one swell whenthe schobneivcame stooping over thenext The bowsprit was over my headT sprung to my feet and leaped stamping the coracle under water With onehand I caught the jib boom while myfoot was lodged between the stay andthe brace and as I still clung therepanting a dull blow told me that theschooner had charged down upon andstruck the coracle and that I was leftwithout retreat on the HispaniolaCHAPTER XXVI STRIKE THE JOLLY ROGERI had scarce gained a position on thebowsprit when the flying jib flappedand filled upon the other tack with areport like a gun The schooner trembled to her keel under the reverse butnext moment the other sails stilldrawing the jib flapped back againand hung idleThis had nearly tossed me off intothe sea and now I lost no time crawledback along the bowsprit and tumbledhead foremost on the deckI was on the lee side of the forecastleand the mainsail which was still drawing concealed from me a certain portion of the after deck Not a soul wasto be seen The planks which had notbeen swabbed since the mutiny borethe print of many feet and an emptybottle broken by the neck tumbled tcand fro like a live thing in the scuppersSuddenly the Hispaniola cameright into the wind The jibs behindme cracked aloud the rudder slammedto the whole ship gave a sickeningheave and shudder and at the samemoment the main boom swung inboard the sheet groaning in the blocksand showed me the lee after deckThere were the two watchmen sureenough red cap on his back as stiff asa handspike with his arms stretchedout like those of a crucifix and histeeth showing through his open lipsIsrael Hands propped against the bulwarks his chin on his chest his handslying open before him on the deck hisace as white under its tan as a tallow candleFor awhile the ship kept bucking andsidlinglike a vicious horse the sailsfilling nowen one tack now on another and the boom swinging to andfro till the mast groaned aloud underthe strain Now and again too therewould come a cloud of light spray overthe bulwark and a heavy blow of theships bows against the swell so muchheavier weather was made of it by thisgreat rigged ship than by my homemade lop sided coracle now gone tcthe bottom of the seaAt every jump of the schooner redcap slipped to and fro but what wasghastly to behold neither his attitudenor his fixed teeth disclosing grin wasany way disturbed by this rough usageAt every jump too Hands appearedstill more to sink into himself and settle down uponthe deck his feet slidingever the further out and the wholebody canting toward the stern so thathis face became little by little- hidfrom me and at last I could seeing beyond his ear and the frayed ringlet of one whiskerAt the same time I observed aroundboth of them splashes of dark bloodupon the planks and began to feel surethat they had killed each other in theirdrunken wrathWhile I was thus looking and wondering in a calm moment when theship was still Israel Hands turned partly round and with a low moan writhedhimself back to the position in whichI had seen him first The moan whichtold of pain and deadly weakness andthe way in which his jaw hung openwent right to my heart But when Iremembered the talk I had overheardfrom the apple barrel all pity left meI walked af t until I reached the mainmastCome aboard Mr Hands I saidironicallyHe rolled his eyes round heavily buthe was too far gone to express surpriseAll he could do was to utter one wordBrandyIt occurred to me there was no timeto lose and dodging the boom as itonce more lurched across the deck Islipped aft and down the companionstairs into the cabinIt was such a scene of confusion asi you can hardly fancj All the lockfastplaces had been broken open in quest ofthe chart The floor was thick withmud where ruffians had sat down todrink or consult after wading in themarshes round their camp The bulkheads all painted in clear white andbeaded round with gilt bore a patternof dirty hands Dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to therolling of the ship One of the doctorsmedical books lay open on the tablehalf of the leaves gutted out I supposefor pipe lights In the midst of all thisthe lamp still cast a smoky glow obscure and brown as umberI went into the cellar all the barrelswere gone and of the bottles a mostsurprising number had been drunk outand thrown away Certainly since thmutiny began not a man of them couldever have been soberTO BE CONTINUEDHOW VICTORIA

mostprominent statesmen of our time andone who had the honor of enjoying ina specialmanner the confidence of hermajesty that it was the queen herselfin opposition to the views of her ministers andof the distinguished man inquestion amaigf hemwho averted thewar She insisted that the dispatchwhich was sent to America demandingperemptorily the surrender of the envoys should be communicated at once toall the powers and the grave consequences of the conflict from an international point of view pointed outThe result was an able state papersent to Washington by Mr Thouvenelin which he stated that France regardedthe act of the American captain whohad arrested the confederate envoys ojboard an English ship as quite unjustfiable and expressed the hope thattlufederal government would accede to thvdemands of Great Britain Austria autfPrussia immediately followed suit aPrince Gortschakoff onthepartof Bussia urged President Lincoln to surrender the envoys without delay andwith such an explanation as would satEnglish national feeling These remonstrances from the powers enabledthe government of Washington to escape without humiliation from an untenable position and saved Englandfrom

hairbreadth escapesand daring feats in the saddle Herequestrian fame reached the ears of awealthy Sew Yorker who owns a splendid thoroughbred which because of itsnumerous and vicious attacks on women and girls had come to be known asthe woman hater The horse was gentleenough with men and boys but alwaysflew into a rage at the approach of apetticoat The owner wrote to MissStewart asking her to try her skill onthe woman hater and she gladlj offeredher services When she arrived the manwas astonished to see a slip of a girlslight and not overrobust looking ofmedium heiglit with wide blue ej esjrolden blonde hair and a real Irish complexion of roses and lilies She looksfar more like a dainty maid who mightshriek with terror And run away from amouse than a girl who is absolutely devoid of physical fear As a matter offact she is full of the pluck which characterized her grandfather CommodoreCharles StewartThe woman hater was in his stallwhen she arrived The girl at once entered patted him on the neck and spokecheerfully to him The owner and hisgroom were terrified but Miss Stewartshowed not a sign of fear though keeping a small riding whip constantly inthe horses sight The woman hater didnot look well pleased but after a moment or two took from the girls hand asmall apple and munched it comfortably Meanwhile Miss Stewart talkedto him constantly never letting him losesight of the whip By and by she putherarm around his neck and passed under his head to the other side Then shecalled for the saddle and bridle whichshe calmly put on the horse all thewhile talking pleasantly and keepingthe whip in view When the womanhater saw that she was about to mounthim he showed signs of rebellion ThenMiss Stewart in a distinctly alteredtone shortly ordered him to stand stillTo the amazement of observers thehorse obeyed at once A moment laterMiss Stewart was in the saddie Speaking pleasantly once more she startedhim around the yard riding him for perhaps ten miniutes Then she dismounted led him into the stall andafter taking off the saddle and bridlegave him another apple As he ate itshe talked to him and petted him winding up by giving him a lump of sugarThen she walked out of the stall followed by an appreciating whinny fromthe animal which until her arrival halfan hour before would never allow awoman to approach him without endeavoring to attack her savagely

BeSubstantially and Carefullyilnclcxd -with GravelIf when the well is first built thewall although of stone brick or sewer pipe is properly backed with gravelno mud or sand will come into thewell no cavern will be formed and noclearing out will be requiredI have made a drawing to illustratethis It is a section through the bottom of tihe well On the right handside tihe wall is shown backed withgravel as it should be the earth beyond standing intact The left handside shows the result where the inevitable spaces behind the wall were notso filled when the well was built Thedark shading to the left is a sectionthrough the soft slime in the bottomof the cavern the cavern above beingshown in something the shape it willtake where the water is very shallow asit is in many old wellsOf course we do not find the wallsregular and in courses as in the drawing but shapeless or in all shapesThe top of the wall is shown ready toserve as the foundation of a tube ofSECTION OF WELL WALLconcrete to be built to near the topwhere the cemented brickwork begins which is to make a watertightbug proof joint with the floor andwell curb of the well room Of coursethis brickwork must come up throughthe floor and the joint must be outside and not on top of it because thewall Avill settleThe hanging platform and the adjustable form behind which the concrete is filled in would require aseparate article with illustrationsBut 1 consider concrete much the Ibestas well as cheapest wall chiefly because it is as easily built 2 or feetin the clear as smaller thus givingample room to let down inside tubing

seemssuch an ideal wall that it will be extensively used anyway In that casethe well should be dug two or three feetdeeper after t e average well diggersays it is plenty deep enough evenif a pump has to be rigged to keep outthe water Then it should be enlargedfor gravel the bottom pipe rested andplumbed on three brickbats tilled behind with the washed gravel to abovehigh water and the bottom of the wellcovered with gravel to a couple ofinches above the bottom of the sewerpipe This gives free circulation between the water in the gravel behindand that in the well but no trace ofmud can enterOne thing more and the bottom ofthe well is complete Make the spacewide enough behind the next sewerpipe above high water to back it solidwith concrete made say of Akronwater lime and gravel poured in behind and if need be broken stonetamped into it This protects thegravel and water behind from any ratsor vermin that might burrow into thecavity behind the sewer pipe aboveThe sinking of

ih writes an article on The Bumble Bee for StNicholas Mr Standish says The workof the bumble bee in bringing about thecross fertilization of flowers is as important as that of the honey bee andthese two stand at the head of the listof insects useful in this respect Eachhas its flowers which it alone visits butthere are many flowers on neutralground visited by both So we maysay of the bumble bee as of the honeybee the more bumble bee the moreseeds the more seeds the more flowersespecially wild flowers as the tall bellflower touch-me-not Solomons sealgentian Dutchmens breeches and turtle-headBut probably the most important work this insect does for agriculture is upon the fields of red cloverThere is abundant proof that tnispjantwill not produce seed without the cooperation of the bumble bee It is impossible for the wind to bring about thefertilization of the seed as it may do inthe case of Indian corn grain and someforest trees The tube of red cloverblossoms too is so long that othey insects including the honey bee are notregular visitantsHere is proof that this plant musthave visits from the bumble bee Thisinsect is not a native of Australia andred clover failed to produce seed thereuntil bumble bees were imported Assoon as they became numerous theplant could be depended upon for seedAgain the blossoms of the first crop ofthe medium red clover of our owncountry are just as perfect as those ofthe second crop but there are too fewbumble bees in the field so early iir theseason to produce fertilization hencelittle or no seed in this crop If bumblebees were sufficiently numerous thereis no reason why much larger yields ofclover seed might not be expected thanat presentHere is what a well informed farmersays about itIt was formerly thought that theworld rested on the shoulders of AtlasI can prove that its prosperity rests onthe bumble bee The world cannotprosper without the farmers productThe farm will not be productive without clover We cannot raise cloverwithout seed and we cannot haveclover seed without the bumble bee because it is this insect that carries thepollen from flower to flower securingits development and continuance Letus learn to

summer thereis really no necessity for feeding at allin warm weather but as some will prefer to allow food the best substance iaraw meat using only that which is leangiving none of the fat portions Themeat must be fresh or it will proveinjurious and cheaper kinds suchas the neck liver and other undesirableportions will serve the purpose as wellas the best Blood is excellent as itmay be mixed

that children without exceptionike to play the piano with the hard pedalon all the time All children like to make allthe noise they can in playing the piano as ineverything else Playing upon the pianowithout the heavy pedal does not disturb meat all but the minute the heavy pedal is puton I am greatly disturbed and the continuedresounding of the notes fairly racks meOf course I cant be forever saying dontand its ungracious to say it at all I supposefor why shouldnt the children have theirfun And so I hit tipon the desperate expedient of blocking the heavy pedal I havewhittled out a nice little piece of soft whitePne into a plug that just fits into the spaceunder the pedal in the opening in which itworks so that the pedal cannot be depressedIt has only been there two days now butit has been two days of blessed relief Itcant last much longer because the childrenare liable to ask me any minute whats thematter I wonder they havent asked melong ago and of course Ill have to tell embut I am grateful for the rest I have had andthe respite has givenme strength the betterto withstand for a time at least the uproarthat will purely come when the children discover the plug N Y
