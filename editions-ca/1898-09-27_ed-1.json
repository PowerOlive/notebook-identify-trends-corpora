Snobbishness
The essence of snobbery lies in a
psrflcial viow of life which confounds a
man with his external conditions I
humbly confess that it is snobbery
which causes in mo a slight feeling of
amusement when I see in a certain
j church a stalwart policeman in his
i vate capacity acting as usher and with
measured tread marching up the aisle
with the worshipers in tow It is snob-
bery pure and simple which has effect-
j ed in ire a sudden diminution of sol-
1 enmity when I have seen a popular
penser of soda water leading the sing-
ing For I see in each case the
dental the irrelevant rather than the
real the essential the stamp of occu
patiou rather than the man
So too there was a dusky propeller
of a handcart who used to pass under
j my windows calling Kebbage
i bagel who became in my eyes invested
I i it t ji i - r i
wt i a snaue oi ausurmcy wnen x learn
ed that he was the chief soloist of r
prominent negro church I have viewed
the cemetery lot of a well known
butcher containing a row of five smali
graves and felt a disposition to smile at
the five small lambs surmounting them
And yet there was nothing really in
congruous in any of these cases unless
in that of the butchers favorite emblem
of innocence and even that only argued
a freshness of feeling which is some
what unusual Lippincotts
Famous rarhorses
Horses in war suffer more fatalities
than men Out of the many thousands
who perish in their duty toward their
masters only few return home to spend
their lives in the ease and honor they
deserve One warhorse however which
madea splendid record for himself and
now has his virtues name and noble
deeds engraved en a fitting tombstone
was Copenhagen the horse the great
Duke of Wellington rode at the battle
of Waterloo
Nine years after the Emperor Na
poleon died at St Helena an old white
horse perished of old age and pneumonia
in England Tho skeleton of the animal
is set up in the Eoyal Service institu
tion and to all visitors it is pointed out
as Marengo the charger Napoleon rode
at the battle of Waterloo Marengo
came originally from Egypt and was
left to wander on tho dismal battlefield
when the emperor was forced to fly for
his life An English officer found and
took him and he was sold to a general
in the British army In English pas
tures cared for by kindly grooms this
noble horse passed the latter years of
his life far more peacefully and happily
than his reat and unfortunate master

Ah no she sighed There is
nothing new under the sun
He felt around for the mustache he
thought he was raising and turned a

Of course she went on that

she had permitted the Cooplethwaite
