in the SenateArmy and Legislative Appropriation BillsAre on the Calendar The Teller Resolution and Appropriation Bills WillBe the Ifeatures in the HouseWashington Jan 31 The senateproceedings for the week will openwith a speech by Senator Pettigrewdealing with the Hawaiian questionwhich will be delivered Monday Beyond this speech it is very difficult toforecast the outlook for the week Thediversion occasioned by taking up theTeller bond resolution has left the senate in a somewhat disorganized andunsettled condition and with no prearranged programme Senator Pettigrews speech will be made during themorning hour and the probabilitiesare now that at its conclusion or atleast at 2 oclock one of the generalappropriation bills will be called upThe army and the legislative appropriation bills are already on the calendar and the consideration of the agricultural bill has been completed by thecommittee so that it will be reportedon MondayThe probabilities are that the armybill will be the first of these measuresto receive consideration though thereis some disposition to displace it withthe legislative bill Senator Allisonchairman of the committee on appropriations said Sunday that it was hispropose to have the appropriation billsconsidered in advance of other measures and if he adheres to this determination the week may be largelytaken up with them So far as cannow be seen there are few features inthe bills already reported calculatedto arouse discussion There is a feeling in certain quarters that the -armybill should be amended by a provisionfor the increase of the army and ifsuch a change should be attempted itwould give rise to a very spirited debateThe census bill also will be pressedforconsideration during the week andSenator Cartee chairman of the census committee said Sunday that he wasvery hopeful of securing its passage inthe near future The debate upon thecivil service will be resumed when thisbill s taken up and the billwill be so amended as to give the control of the census bureau to the secretary of the interior The bimetallist republican senators are discussing theadvisability of renewing the financialagitation in the senate by the introduction of some measure of their ownthough they do not seem quite so intent upon this course as they appearedto be immediately succeeding the voteupon the Teller resolution If theypresent a resolution it probably willbe a declaration to the effect that theUnited States is not committed to thegold standardTt is the ihtentionjfoftlieShouseUeaders to onset asppssiDie tneaction of the senate in passing theTeller resolution by killing that declaration of the sense of congress regarding the payment of the governments coin bonds in silver on an ayeand no vote in the house this weekThis will be the feature of the proceedings While the full republican strength in the house can not becommanded against the resolutionno doubt is expressed by those whohave made it their business to canvasthe situation that the majority againstit will be decisive As soon as the resolution is reported back from theways and means committee which maybe Monday the rules committee willbring in a special order for itsconsideration The time allowedfor debate is likely to be brief as theleaders do not believe there is anynecessity for protracted debate andmoreover a long discussion wouldmeasurely decrease the very purposethey have in view namely a promptand decisive negative reply to thesenates declaration The remainderof the week will be devoted toappropriation bills The District ofColumbia is still under discussion and the fortifications bill is onthe calendar The house leaders intend to give appropriation bills theright of way in order to make an earlyadjournment possible The momentthe appropriation bills are out of theway the new rules will be brought inand after that the contested electionscases and the bankruptcy bill will bebrought forwardWashington Jan 31 Secretary ofAgriculture Wilson has

see a shootingstar he was anxious to bet that hewould see more than me twenty fivefrancs a star and it was only when Iexplained that my purse was in thehands of the brigands that he wouldgive over the ideaWell we chatted away in this veryamiable fashion until the day began tobreak when suddenly we heard a greatvolley of musketry from somewhere inthe front of us It was very rocky andbroken ground and I thought although I could see nothing that a general engagement had broken out TheJUart laughed at my idea however and43xplained that the sound came from4he English camp where every manSUDDENLY WE HEAED A GREAT VOLLEYOF MUSKETRYemptied his piece each morning so asto make sure of having a dry primingIn another mile we shall be up withthe outposts said heI glanced around at this and I perceived that we had trotted along at sogood a pace during the time that wewere keeping up our pleasant chat thatthe dragoon with the lame horse wasaltogether out of sight I looked onside but in the whole of thatvast rocky valley there was no one saveonly the Bart and I both of us armedyou understand and both of us wellmounted I began to ask myselferaiterau iT was quitethat I should ride that mile whichwould bring me to the British outpostsNow I wish to be very -clear with youon tins point my friends for I wouldnot have you think that I was actingdishonorably or ungratefully to theman who had helped me away from thebrigands You must remember that ofall duties the strongest is that which acommanding officer owes to his menYou must also bear in mind that war isa game which is played under fixedrules and when these rules are brokenone must at once claim the forfeit Tffor example I had given a parole thenI should have been an infamous wretchhad I dreamed of escaping But noparole had been asked of me Out ofoverconfidence and the chance of thelame horse dropping behind the Barthad permitted me to get upon equalterms with him Had it been I whohad taken him I should have used himas courteously as he had me but at thesame time I should have respected hisenterprise so far as to have deprivedhim of his sword and seen that I hadat least one guard besides myself Ireined up my

your head off if you shouldattempt itTwo can play at that game my dearBart said IThen well see who can play itbest he cried pulling out his swordI had drawn mine also but I wasquite determined not to

not strikebackThats all very well said he Butyouve got to come along with me to thecampI shall never see the camp said IIll lay you nine to four you do hecried as he made at me sword in handBut those words of his put somethingnew into my head Could we not decide the matter in some better way thanby fighting The Bart was placing mein such a position that I should have tohurt him or he would certainly hurtme I avoided his rush though hissword point was within an inch of myneckI have a proposal I cried Weshall throw dice as to which is the prisoner of the otherHe smiled at this It appealed to hislove of sportWhere are your dice he criedI have noneNor I but I have cardsCards let it be said IAnd the gameI leave it to jrouEcarte then the best of threeI could not help smiling as I agreedfor I do not suppose that there werethree men in -France who were my masters at the game I told the Bart asmuch as we dismounted He smiledalso as he listenedI was counted the best player atWatiers said he With even luckyou deserve to get off if you beat meSo we tethered our two horses andsat down one on either side of thegreat flat rock The Bart took a packof cards out of his tunic and I had onlyto see

Englishman heplayed in a way that was worthy ofsuch a stake But I my friends I wassuperb Of the five which I had tomake to win I gained three on the firsthand The Bart bit his mustache anddrummed his

Horace Mason a near neighbor whohad dropped in as he often did for anhour in the eveningHe sat in an ensy chair balancing astout crutch which stood him in steadof his right leg across the arm andnow without waiting for an answer tohis question went on with deep sighPoor John Swift So he has gonein that way at last He has always beencalled reckless but luck has been withhim until now while I who was always far more cautious have been frequently in trouble and after havingbeen jammed bruised and pinched until it came to be said on tlfc road thatI had as many lives as a cat I have losta leg and come off barely With mj lifeJohn Swift and I began firing onthe Noneticut River road on the verysame breezy March day 25 years agoHe was promoted to be an engineerlong before I was but I was not jealousof his good luck and I will tell you howit happenedWhen we had each been throwingwood about two years there was a fearful freshet on the Noneticut river afterwhich our road was named and withwhich it ran parallel for 40 miles ormoreIt was a good road well managed byconscientious officers who treated theiremployes as if ther were men andbrothers and kept their stock away upabove par by making their road asnearly perfect in every way as a railroad can be madeThe Noneticut river fairly outdid itself in the way of a freshet that yearThere was a tremendous amount offcnow at the north and when after along rain the ice broke up and went outit made a block at the Narrows abovethe Oxbow falls and in two hours timethe water had spread out over the greatmeadow on one side and had submerged ten rods of our track on theother midway between Nosuch andNorth Nosuch stations taking everybody by surprise for the oldest inhabitants even had never before knownc the placid steady Noneticut to attemptgoing beyond its prescribed bondsLate that afternoon the freight that1 was firing was standing on a sidingat North Nosuch station waiting forthe express to pass us upon whose locomotive the Arcturus Johnny Swiftwas firemanThere was a high wind the rain waspouring in torrents the slush was ankle-deep and as darkness settLed downupon us there was promise of the worstkind of

compelled me topawn it at s for 500 ticket sacrificed Address New York Ifyou address accordingly and if the advertiser considers you a fit subject foran artful game he will wait on you witha tale of woe and the ticket The priceof the ticket should be 250 for the brilliants are most valuable but the finalprice will be partly left to you onlyplease examine the gems at once because the owner is in desperate straitsYou examine the pledge at the pawnbrokers paying 50 cents for the privilege The diamonds are certainlvthe and his face lookedfeathery snow j monds although of a shape anj quality known to the trade as rose diamonds and rather than spend five orten dollars to compensate an expert forgoing for you to examine them youconclude to advance ten per cent uponthe ticket and make it your ownThe holder refuses at fiist but finally yields and departs with 50 of yourwealth and leaves you the owner of theproperty subject to the pawnbrokerslien thereon You then redeem themwhich costs you 550 more and on taking your prize to a dealer in diamondsyou learn that the entire piece of jewelry is really worth and would be salable at the sum of 250Did the skillful and well informedpawnbroker then really lend 500 on acollection of stones worth only 250Not at all He probably advanced150possibly 200 and made out a ticket for500 agreeing with the borrower to divide the profits on the redemption ofthe ticket by a third person But youcould not hope to prove this eitherfrom the books or from the admissionsof the parties The person with whomyou dealt belongs to a

greatest number of hog s are kept The massing ofthose animals together and crowdingthem with sooArbonaceousafood as corns an invitation to disease to come andreap a rich harvest and unless timelypreparations are taken to thwart it itis a harvest- which is very liable to begathered and that successful tooThis is especially true where the piggery and its surroundings have becomeunsunitarj In such a case diseasegerms multiply fast for disease lovesdark and dampness which soon tend toenfeeble the strongest- and healthiesthog and pave the way to the most direresultsNow as sunlight is one of the bestgermicides known this togetfrer withMODEL PIGGERYdry quarters is absolutely necessary tothe continued health of any hog Indeed all animals should have the-sun-shineto bask in and most emphaticallydoes this hold true as regards younganimals According when it comesto the housing of the hogs for winterit is imperative that the piggery be soarranged as to provide the requisiteamount of sunshine inside - Whenbuilding a large piggery however theproblem is how to get the suns rays tothe north side of the building It issimple enough to get the sunlight tostream in at the south side but although it reaches the floor near thesouth side it will not reach far backWhat then is to be done Why use alittle headwork and build in accordancewith the following designs the first ofwhich is the perspective view You willthus have the north side of the piggerymade as warm and sunny and oftenfar more so than the south side Forto obtain the desired results the houseshould extend east and west no matterwhat its size is which should dependupon the magnitude of the herd that itis to accommodate and nothing else2Tf--lin apX3s x-s - i nl yINTERIOR ARRANGEMENTJpVill be observed that thepeakefiie roof is south of the center of thebuilding both sides of the roof being ofthe same pitch This causes the roofof the north side to run higher than thatof the south side in the place where theroofs meet and so enables one to put inglass below the one roof and above theother through which the sun willstream to the north side of the houseand killing disease germs by the million tone up the system of

dwelling houses as wellas to farm buildings Frederick OSibley in N Y TribuneH ELPFUL FARM NOTESDo not put all out doors into wheatbecause of the promise of the wheatmarketTthe future farmer must be educatedIf our boys cannot attend the agricultural college a systematic course ofagricultural reading is possible duringthe winter evenings and the time couldnot be better employedWhen grasses are grown and thenpastured or fed to stock during the winter and the manure carefully savedand returned to the soil the loss in fertility is practically nothing ancl this isthe ideal manner of keeping up thefarmPURCHASING BEESSome Really Valuable Hints for Xo yices in AgricultureThis is one of the puzzles to the beginner when to buy All things considered I think the spring the best timeIn the hands of the master it migfat payto buy in the fall as they can be boughtid uch cheaper then But a novice wouldnot know7 whether they were in propercondition to winter successfully or notor what to do in case they were notor how to prepare them in case theyneeded special attention preparatory togoing into winter quarters Bait by purchasing in the spring even though theycost a dollar per colony more there isno risk to run for with a reasonableseason they will pay for themselves andthere will be something leftI would advise buying as near homeas possible to save express charges asit is very difficult to ship small lots oibees by local freight If you feel timidabout handling them I should advisebuying pure Italians as they are morequiet than tihe blacks or hybrids bu1if you are not I would not pay largeiprices for any particular strain youmay see advertised in the bee journalsThe honey gathered by the blacks andhybrids is just as sweet and the quantity just as great as that gathered by thehigh toned or high priced races and ncbee on earth builds such delicate combsor caps its Ihone3 with such virgin whiteness as the poor despised black beeI would advise if possible to bin fullstrong colonies and wherever you majlive I should advise having them movedor shipped about the time apple treesblossom Make your purchase as earljas possible but dont be in a hurry tchave them moved they are much betteiwhere they are until settled warmweather has come to stay and the blossoms are producing nectar PeVhapssome of you dont feel able to bujstrong colonies if not you can buy twothree or four frame nuclei for lessmoney and at less cost of transportation Tlhese you can build up duringthe season and make good colonies oithem by fall but you could not reasonably expect much increase in number or much surplus while orthe other hand with strong coloniesyou can double your spring count andwith a good season and good management get enough surplus honey to pavfor the colonies you buy in the springI advise beginners to make haste slowly and make the bees tlheir wayevery season then should you meelwith winter losses you will be nothing out but your time and will haveyour experience hives and combs leflto begin with another spring all oiwhich you will find Valuable RairaWorldROOSTING QUARTERSConstruct Tliein so That They Can BeCleaned EasilyThere are many ways of constructing and placing roosts The aim shouldbe to make them comfortable for theJfgwls and convenient for the attendantin handling and cleaning Place allroosts back from the windows out oithe way of drafts They should belowand of a uniform height Bruising oifeet is frequently caused by fowlsjumping down from a high perch Ifarranged one above another the fowlswill jump from the lowest perch tcthe next and the stronges fowls willcrowd down the weaker ones The high-I I I I I I I I U I IPROPERLY ARRANGED ROOSTSest perch will be uncomfortably crowded while a portion of the lower ones isunoccupied The fear of danger willprompt fowls to seek the highest roosting place If the roosts are level ncinjury from getting down and off willoccur and the fowls will not crowdone another The arrangement shownherewith is a convenient one Make atight platform iys feet from the floor tocatch droppings Around the edge naila strip one by three to keep droppingsfrom scattering and going on and offA platform arranged in this way is conducive to cleanliness as the fowls willnot step in the manure and track itover the floor Place the roosts a footabove the platform and rest them firmly in a slot or mortise Make them oftwo by three scantling rounded on theupper side planed perfectly smooth sothat the fowls will not be likely to getsplinters in their feet Smooth roostsare easily cleaned and do not harborlice The perches should be far enoughapart to prevent soiling of plumage 14or 15 inches is about the right distanceAllow one foot on the roost for eachfowl of the large breeds and less for thesmall breeds Farm and HomeTio Sze of a ColonyA few hundred bees and a queen mayte called a small colony but I believean average colony contains perhaps30000 or 35000 bees and during thehoney season when they are at theirgreatest strength they maj havedouble the above number and when attheir lowest number wThich is in latewinter they may run down to 10000or much less To get at any correct estimate of this is rather difficult andmany give the average of a fair working colony at 20000 or 25000 whilesome think it possible for a colony toreach 75000 American EpitomistValue of Grass and HayErom recent experiments it appearsthat a meadow will yield about fourtimes as much feed in bulk if made intohay as it will if pastured But as it iswell known that the young tendeigrass of the often cropped pasture ismore nutritious than the older andtougher hay it vas found by a carefultest that the advantage in nutrientsdigestibility and freedom from cost oiharvesting housing and feeding of pastured fields will nearly balance tksgreater yield of hay fields except onvery high priced1CANADIAN CREAMERIESHow Tney Are Operated and Made fPay the FarmerOats No 2 -whiteRye No 2 -westernCATTLE First
