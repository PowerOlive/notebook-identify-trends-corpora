The "Womanless Wedding,"
which was given by local talent, at
M.. M. I. Drill Hall, Friday evening,
under the auspices of the Womans'
Missionary Society, 61 the Methodist
church, was one of the humorous
liits of the season. A large audience
-was in attendance. The cast was well
made-up and largely spectacular.
Preceding the wedding was a grand
v scene by the (musical talent of Ttfil
lersburg, -which was made up of vocal
selections, mostly solos and choruses.
At the close of the scene came the
-wedding, the principal features .of
-which was the costuming. -Each par
ticipant entered from the main door
of the auditorium, passed down the
center aisle to the stage, where they
took their positions. The cast ' was
made up of men only. Those repre
senting women were attired in wo
men's clothing, which was 'indeed
very humorous, and created such a
complete change in some of them that
they would not have been recognized,
had their names been called. From
the time they began to enter until
the far.ce closed the house was con
vulsed in one continuous uproar of
laughter. The work was light and
easily staged, but it created much
fun, and all went home satisfied.
The work was put on by Miss Miller,
of Mississippi. About one hundred
and seventy-five dollars was realized.

ness. His only relatives in this vi
cinity are the following nieces and
nephew.s; Mrs. Rice Whaley, Mrs.
