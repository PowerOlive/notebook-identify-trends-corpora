Paris,lield in the throes of darkness forover two weeks on account of theiuel conservation order, was a different Paris of .a few nights before,when it was ae dark as the shadesof Erebus. Brilliantly lighted show-windows beamed their welcome tothe passers-by and to window shop2ers, and the stores had their quotaof shoppers for Christmas goods,who were bent on making up for losttime. Business was fine that is, asfine as the weather conditionswould permit, and in spite of thatthere was an air of cheerfulness apparent. The contrast between that nightand the previous nights, while theban was on, was striking. Insteadof most stores being in darkness,others looking dim with their candle-.and-oillamp-illuminations, the restaurants only partly lighted, and asense of oppression everywhere, thebusiness houses were radiant withlight and brilliancy.Relaxation of the restrictions onlieating and lighting to permit retail stores to remain open nine"hours on Saturday nights was oneof the concessions made by the FuelAdministration. This was made, itwas stated, to accommodate thelieavy buying due to the near approach of the Christmas holidayseason. Shopgirls, clerks and otherswho have formed the habit of sleeping until late in the morning on account of their business places not'being open until nine o'clock for the9st two weeks, will now have tobecome accustomed to the new orderof things. With all the restrictionsremoved offices can open any timeand close at the proprietor's pleasure.TABXEBS' WIVES AND COUNTRYFOLKS.

Thewartime prohibition act was heldconstitutional to-day by the SupremeCourt.In deciding the question the Supreme Court also dissolved injunctions restraining revenue officialsfrom interfering with the removalfrom bond of about 70,000,000 gallons of whisky valued at approximately $75,000,000 held by theKentucky Distilleries & WarehouseCompany, of Louisville, Ky.The signing of the armistice didnot abrogate the war powers ofCongress,, Associate Justice Brandiessaid in reading the decision of theCourt.Justice Brandies said the government did not appropriate the liquorby stopping its domestic sale as theway was left open for exporting it.The constitutional prohibitionamendment is binding on the Federal Government as well as theStates and supercedes State laws,the Court declared.The judgment of the Court in theKentucky and New York cases wasunanimous.In rendering its opinion the Courtconfined itself entirely to the wartime prohibition act, and took onthe so-called beer cases which attacked the constitutionality of theprobibition enforcement act.The decision caused the hopes ofmany for a "wet" holiday time tovanish.o.

Two tobacco growers, well-knownin the city and county as liberal,open-handed men, square in all theirdealings, and men Tvhose word is asgood as their bond, were discussingthe tobacco markets yesterday morning in a local restaurant. Afterturning the subject over and overand discussing it from every angle,one of the men remarked: "Well,I'm tickled to death with my dealings on the Paris market. I'vecleared $2,000 on one of my deals,and I have already made up my mindto give this to my wife for herChristmas gift,." What Paris merchant doing an ordinary volume ofbusiness will be able t6 give hiswife a present of $2,000?

THE,?WS manWednesday, said: "Maifar Paris people have the idea that they are notallowed to send Christmas, narcelpost packages through the 1mail4eicause of the curtailing of transportation facilities by order of- the-Fuel-Administration." A number of inquiries had been made '-at the localpostoffice concerning this matter.Mr. Payne stated further that theieport had been - caused largely bynewspaper articles announcing thatthe railroad officials at Chicago hadrequested people to delay their parcel post shipments for a while onaccount of the congested conditionof the train service. This situation,he explained, exists only in Chicagoand has no effect on local conditions.The order was not made by theFuel Administration or the Postofficedepartment, but was merely a request of railroad officials to:Chicagoneonle. and Paris people need haveon apprehensions regarding mailingChristmas parcels post packages."But," added Mr. Payne, "pleaseask the people to mail their packages as soon as possible.

Among his pupils were a.number of young men and womenfrom Paris, -vvho remember him withpleasure.Since leaving Lexington, Mr.Chavanne has prospered in his native town, in the real estate and insurance business.

He said, in part, in referringito the value of printer's ink:"When a resident of Lexington Iwon uie cash fcrize for beins: theifirst one in suggesting the name for;the Lexington Herald when Boylewanted a name or that paper. . . .jOur Section of Louisiana is principally occupied with the productionof lumber, oil, rice and sulphurJWe produce as much, rice as Texas,larkansas, California, Mississippiant TJorth Carolina combined.

Already thisboard, which Is made up of a mixedmilitary and civiilam personnel, hasdistributed through the country, In districts suited to the quick productionof half-bred horses of robust types, thefifty-odd thoroughbred stallions, mostof them the gifts to the government ofhorsemen and persons Interested Inracing and thoroughbred production,that had previously been acquired" bythe war department through the remount board that was called into beingduring the progress of the great war.The military members of the permanent reraou. . board are Major Generals William G. Snow and Jesse McL.(Carter, Colonels F. S. Armstrong, John8. Fair, Bruce Palmer and George H.Cameron, Lieutenant Colonel John F.Taulbee and Major Hayden Channlng.Major Channlng will not be classed asa military representative on the boardlong. When he leaves the service,which he entered for the term of thewar, he will become one of New England's clirillan representatives.Weil-Known Men on Board.The civilian members of .the remountboard are Major August Belmont,chairman of the Jockey Club of -NewTork, and one of the foremost thorfonghbred producers of the UnitedStates ; Dr. John H. Mohler, of Washington; Arthur B. Hancock, proprietor of the Ellerslle stud, t Virginia,and the Claiborne .stud, of .Kentucky,and another great thoroughbred producer, his EUersife and Claiborne yearlings having fetched a total of more'thnn $150,000 at the recent Saratoga.'wiles ; F. Ambrose Clark, of New Tori: ;Algernon Daingerfleldj tke assistant.spcretary of the Jockey Club; MajorRobert E. Strawbridge, of Peniurylra-'ufa : Thomas Hitchcock, of New York,and Captain Philip M. Wtkr, of VI-'rinfei. Captain Walker, a retired officer of the regular -service of tbi Unified States urmy, is a breeder of thoroughbreds In Clarke County, Virginia.The military personnel of this boardis not to be permanent. Instead ofpicking the men best fitted by knowlf edge and experience for the work ofdirecting, in conjunction with the civilian membership, the production ofhorses for the three great combatbranches of ie military service cavalry, artillery and transport and giving them permanent billets, the war-department has intimated that it mustfor fear of violating a century-old tradition, shift the military members ofthe board from time to time so as togive other officers their opportunities.This sort of rotation is calculated toprove wasteful and ineffective, but wardepartments the world over are sticklers for traditional routine and thereIs not help for it.Two Types of Horses.The situation, as regards the workof the United States Army RemountBoard may ba saved by permanentcivilian membership. There can be noquestion of the sound sense and practical knowledge of breeds of horsesand of their general and specific usefulness of the civilian members of thehoard. To the success of Major Belmont, whose Nursery stud has beenrppresented on American tracks thisseason by Lucullite, the country'sgreatest thoroughbred of mature3 ears; by Man O'War, the outstandingchampion amonr th- two-year-olds,and by Mad Hatter; and of Mr. Hancock, reference has already been made.Major Hitchcock has won distinctionthpse twenty-five years as a developerof crosscountry performers. Mr. Clark,like Mr. Hitchcock, has been associated with steeplechasing In the east, andhn has in the course of the last twoyears rendered sijrnal service and without compensation to the army as acivilian member of the war-time remount board. Major Strawbridge andMajor Channlng have spent the better part of a quarter of a century developing hordes of the so-called huntertypp, which are the sort that have rendered the most efficient service to thearmies of Fiance and England In theworld struggle for liberty. Since thecivilian m mbership Is to be permanent It Is Inevitable that the influence9f the civilian members will be powerful, If It is not controlling, in theshaping of the policy of the remountboard.Today the remount board, as regardsbo-h the military and civilian element, Is a unit on the proposition thatthe association between effective national defense and the two types ofhorses that have not succumbed tothe overwhelming competition of theautomobile and the motor truck, whichAmericans call thoroughbreds therunner and the trotter is of sovereignimportance.

Itwas announced that the Departmentof Justice had taken over this Commission and its full personnel, asking it to be the governmental agencyto carry out the spirit and letter ofthe law as outlined in the recent extension of the Lever Act, which provides for fine and imprisonment ofanyone guilty of profiteering in anyof the essentials of food, fuel andclothing. Tiie Commission has nowagreed upon an extended program toeffect an organization throughoutthe State, realizing that the presenthigh cost of living is one of the mostdisturbing elements existing inAmerican life to-day.Since the Commission is now under the direction of the FederalGovernment with, the full strengthof the Department of Justice behindit, anyone-found profiteering in theesentials of life may expect to besummarily dealt with. A fair pricecommittee has been organized whoseduty it is to fix a fair price on allnecessary commodities, and as soonas these prices, are completed, anycne found charging a higher pricewill be promptly proceeded againstthrough the U.

District Attorney'soffice.However, it is absoluteljr necessary that the public patriotically dotheir part in this work by promptlyreporting to the High Cost of Living Commission, at Louisville, Kentucky, all cases where apparent overcharge has been made, for the fieldof investigation is so very large thatthe committee's investigators canpersonally locate only a small percentage of the offenders, therefore,it is the purpose of this body to enlist the co-operation of all business,civic, religious and welfare associations, but more especially the citizens themselves in an effort to remedy the prebent condition.A most aggressive plan of campaign was outlined with District Attorneys Gregory and Slattery, of theUnited States Court, present, whoare to give their full co-operationand assistance, and the public nowhas the assurance that any case ofovercharge reported will haveprompt attention, but in sending inthese reports, it is absolutely necessary in order to make proper investigation that the detailed informatiori be given as to the price paidfor the article itself, date of purchase, and name of dealer, 'over thesignature of the purchaser.The efforts of the Commission sofar have been largely confined toLouisville, where it has succeededin bringing about considerable benefits, and it is now our purpose toextend the usefulness of this Commission to all parts of the State, andanyone anywhere should - write theHigh Cost of Living Commission,Louisville, Kentucky, if they havebeen overcharged or if they know ofany overcharging prevailing.oOF LOCAL INTERESTSome People We Know, and We WillProfit by Hearine About Them.This is .purely a local event.It took place in Paris.Not in some faraway place.You are asked to investigate it.Asked to believe a citizen's word.To confirm a citizen's statement.Any article that is endorsed athome is more worthy of confidencethan one you know nothing about.Endorsed by unknown people.Floyd H.

True, they amuse the"kiddies," but if the tremendous outlay they cost in value of paper iscontinued, the comic section is absolutely a burden and a useless' wasteof good paper.o :SKOOT-KAR 35cTWIN BROS.DipitHinit Start7th and Main Paris, KyLIFT OFF CORNSWITH FINGERSPewWHITE 4 M.1VVILLE(ICY.LiteralifMttVfttllOFURS4kin.n I3w)ifxiTAXI - CABSERVICEAUTO LIVERY CO.E.
