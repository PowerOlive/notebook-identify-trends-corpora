LODGE NOTES
The Masonic Million Dollar Com
mittee will have a meeting in Lou
isville, November 15, to consider the
completion of the labors of the com
mittee during the coming year.
Slightly more than $977,000.00 has
been raised, and the committee will
take into consideration not only the
raising of the balance of the million
dollars, but enough to properly fur
nish the buildings anew when they
are completed. Members of the
committee are the same as hereto
fore. The Grand Lodge has deter
mined that the site will not be se
cured or the buildings contracted
for until the money has been raised.
therefore those questions will not
come up again until the meeting of
the Grand Lodge next October.
TODAY AND TOMORROW
Douglas McLean
in "The Jailbird"
A PARAMOUNT PICTURE
WITH DORIS MAY
The most popular team that the screen has ever known, in
another zippy romance that's all joy.
The tale of an oil well fake, a "hick" town editor's woes,
and a jailbird's flight into love.
Funny as "23 1-2 Hours' Leave." Exciting as "What's
Your Husband Doing?" Yet big and fine and beautiful.
THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 3rd
"Down Home'5
From the well known book, "Dabney Todd," by F. N.
Westcott, a brother of the author of "David Harum."
One tensely gripping situation follows another in this
stirring "heart interest" picture and through it all, like
a silken skein, runs a charmingly presented love-tail.
Here's a psomise! When poor, weak Joe, stirred and
uplifted by the Dominie's words of comfort, starts up from
his seat, you're going to start up with him.

and Pathe News.
