Monday, the last day of the Mil
lersburg Chautauqua, was the crown
ing epoch of the occasion, and will
ever live in the minds of those pres
ent as one of the most happy days in
the history of Millersburg. We all
anticipated a big day, knowing that
we were to be entertained by the
Banda Roma, and in this we were not
disappointed.
Owing to it being County Court day
in Paris, the audience in the after
noon was not as large as it otherwise
would have been, but it made up for
it inv the evening, when the large
tent was filled to its utmost capacity
and many could not be accommodated
with seats. In the afternoon the
Banda Romas gave half an hour pre
lude and were followed by Jacob
Randolph Perkins, of Iowa, in his fa
mous lecture, "Wit and Hajf Wits,"
which was good, dicerent in style
from any that had preceded. In the
evening we enjoyed a full concert by
the Banda Roma. Their program,
both in the afternon and evening was
varied, so as to satisfy all grades of
lovers of music. So enthusiastic were
our people over it, and so determined
were we to have them again another
year, we accepted another contract
from the American Lyceum Bureau
with 110 names signed to it as guar
antors, and could have made' it 200
just as easy. When we undertook the
work in the spring we made an effort
to get fifty names as guarantors and
were only successful in getting 43. So
delighted were the people of this first
effort that many fent to the commit
tee voluntarially asking a privilege
of signing the contract even many
of our ladies asked this privilege, and
some few that do not even reside in
the neighborhood.
The Chautauqua will be held about
the same time time next year, the
program will be equal to, if not bet
ter,, than the one just rendered, and
we are already anticipating and bet
ting ready for a great meeting. The
knockers have been regulated to the
rear and they were among the first
to pronounce it a great success. The
social features connected with it
were among its many pleasant things,
and all regretted that it was over
when the big tent was taken down
and packed for shipping.
The twenty-third annual meeting
of the Hurst Home Insurance Direc
tors convened Wednesday morning at
the Hurst Home Office. All of thev
counties of the district were repre
sented. Promptly at 9 a. m. President
J. G. Allen, of Millersburg, called the
meeting to order, and the business of
the' day was begun by the reading of
the minutes of the last meeting by
Secretary O. E. Hurst, of Millersburg.
Following this, the reports of the va
rious committees were read. The
company shows a most healthy condi
tion. The most rigid inspection was
adhered to during the past year, and
a large amount of undesirable prop-
erty canceled. Inspector 0. H. Coll
ier, of Millersburg, was assisted in a
large part of his work by Assistant
Inspector Clark, of Bath County, and
they were highly commended by the
board for their work during the pastj
year.
The losses sustained by the com
pany was slight compared to that of
a year ago. The company losing by
wind in 1913 in one day as much as
their entirevloss thus far during 1914.
The Auditing Committee found the
books and accounts in most excellent
condition. The "Executive Committee
was untiring in its efforts during the
entire year and numerous meetings
were held.
The Committee on Resolutions read
a beautiful tribute to the loss of one
of its members during last December,
which was ordered to be spread upon
the minutes of the company, and a
copy sent to the bereaved family.
A considerable amount of miscella
neous business was disposed of in
the morning session. Woodford Coun
ty has been added to the list since
last meeting, and an agent and direc
tors appointed. Mercer County will
be taken up this year. Promptly at
noon the meeting adjourned for din
ner, and all repaired to the dining
hall of the M. F. C, where a delight
ful dinner awaited them, which was
prepared by Mrs. O. E. Hurst, assist
ed by a number of lady friends. She
was the recipient of showers of com
pliments after dinner for the manner
in which she handled the crowd.
The afternoon session was called to
order at 1:30 and lasted but a short
time. The Committee on Inspection
recommended that the present salary
of $1,500 be continued, and that Mr.
O. H. Collier be re-appointed, which
was adopted. Committees were then
appointed for the ensuing year. There
was but one important change made,
Mr. W. T. Current retiring from the
Executive Committee, which was giv-
