A recent issue of the Danville
3Iessenger had the following: "Miss
Margaret Graham Davis, of the Mil
lersburg College, who is pleasantly
-remembered as a student at K. C. W.
-when she was a small girl, spent the
"Easter vacation in Harrodsburg, and
came over to Danville to visit rela--tives.
Miss Davis is a pleasant stu
dent and athlete and an all-round
splendid young woman, who will be
' Jtteard from in the days to come."
The Millbour Theatre was con-
ducted as a motion picture show by
Mr. and Mrs. Tony Zellers, who 'had
sold the lease and were preparing
to retire from business. The build
ing was to have been remodeled for
-a dry goods store. The Paris fire
department was summoned about
-12:30 o'clock. The building was
r gutted by the time they arrived.
" The loss was estimated yesterday at
: $15,p00, -with reported insurance of
$5,000 on the building, and $2,500
on the theatre. The fire sprang from
two sourjces and incendiarism is sus-.
jpected.
. Millersburg has again been vis-
Ited with a disastrous fire. About 12 I
f o'clock Wednesday night the alarm
of fire was sounded and cries of fire
rang from the voices of many who
- .were in the immediate vicinity. It
- was found to be in the Ingels Build
ing, the lower floor being occupied
by the Milbour Theatre and the' flat
a.bove occupied by Bruce McMahan
- a.nd family, Wadell Beeding and
" family, and E. T. Beeding, all of
whom barely escaped with their
vlive$, losing all their household ef
"sirlects and clothing, with no insur--tace,.
Had it not been that T. E.
"Bowles was acting as night watch-
jnan at the Farmers Bank, there is
-no doubt but what there -would have
.'.ln a. loss of lives. As it was. the
i 5r; .presidents barely escaped in their
gy; fc-s3iight clothes, and Mr. T. G. Beed-
ing, who was in the, rear of the
flmilding and cut off from the stair
way, was removed by ladders being
g placed at the window. All credit is
due tto the Paris Fire Department,
who immediately answered the call
for help and made the run in ten
minutes and soon had the fire under
control. The large plate glass win
dows in the Farmers Bank and
postoffice were broken from the heat
. and had it not been the wind was
blowing in the opposite direction the
whole block would have been des
?f troyed. As it is, two of the most
prominent corner buildings of the
k 'town are now in ruins, the Sandusky
building having burned several
yk.T8 ago.

Hall Room Boys Comedy, "We Should Worry"
THE SHIRTLESS AGE
Judging trom what the old-fashioned
aresaying about the knick
ers some of the more daring and
"liberated" of the- fair sex are -wearing,
it begins to look as though the
immediate future may be recorded
in years farther off as the "skirtless
age." There is almost enough criti
cism of knickers to make every
girl want to wear them. That they
are sensible will, of course, have
nothing to do with deciding whether
knickers are to be only a fad or
something more.
