for the farriar sergeantand the pole ax First I would give alittle tug at my ankle cords and thenanother at those that were around mywrists and all the time I was trying toloosen them I was peering- round tosee if I could find something which wasin my favor There was one thingwhich was very evident A hussar isbut half formed without a horse andthere was my other half quietly grazing within thirty yards of me Then Iobserved yet another thing The pathby which we had come over the mountains was so steep that a horse couldonly be led across it slowly and withdifficulty but in the other directionthe ground appeared to be more openand to lead straight down into a gentlysloping- valley Ilad I but my feet inyonder stirrups and my saber in myhand a single bold dash might takeme out of the power of these vermin ofthe rocksI was still thinking- it over asd straining with my wrists and my ankleswhen their chief came out from hisgrotto and after some talk with hislieutenant who lay groaning near thefire they both nodded their heads andlooked across at me He then saidsome few words to the band whoflapped their hands and laughed uproariously Thing s looked ominous and1 was delighted to feel that my handswere so far free that I could easily slipthem through the cords if I wishedBut with my ankles I feared that Icould do nothing- for when I strainedit brought such pain into my lancewound that I had to gnaw my mustacheto keep from crying- out 1 could onlylie still half free and half bound andsee what turn things were likely totakeFor a little I could not see what theywere after One of the rascals climbedup to the top of a well grown firjHE SAID A FEW WORDS TO THE BANDtree up on one side of the glade and-tied a rope around the top of the trunkHe then fastened another rope in thesame fashion to a similar tree on theother side The two loose ends werenow dangling down and I waited withsome curiosity and just a little trepidation to see what they would do nextThe whole band pulled upon one of theropes until they had bent the strongyoung- tree down into- a semi circleand they then fastened it to a stumpso as to hold it so When they hadbent the other tree down in a similarfashion the two summits were withina few feet of each other though asyou understand the3T would eachspring- back to their original positionthe instant that they were released Ialready saw the diabolical plan whichthose miscreants had formedI presume that you are a strong mancolonel said the chief coming towardme with his hateful smileIf you will have the kindness toloosen these cords I answered I willshow you how strong I amWe were all interested to see whether you were as strong as these twoyoung saplings said he It is our intention you see to tie one end of eachrope round your ankles and then to letthe trees go If you are stronger thanthe trees then of course no harm wouldbe done If on the other hand the treesare stronger than you why in thatcase colonel we may have a souvenirof you upon each side of our littleglade He laughed as he spoke and atthe sight of it the whole forty of themlaughed also Even now if I am in mydarker humor or if I have a touch ofmy old Lithuanian ague I see in mysleep that ring of dark savage faceswith their cruel eyes and the firelightflashing upon their strong white teethCHAPTER IVIt is astonishing and I have heardmany make

1898HEN in the early 70s Edgar Cat-lett fresh from college camefrom his New York home to Texas forthe purpose of starting a cattle ranchhe was just 21 years old It was his first-visit to the Lone Star state and he wisely waited to learn something of thecountry its people and their ways before investing He soon found out thatthe best ranges near the settlementswere all taken up and that if he wishedio secure a ranch cheaply he must pushout beyond them to the westward Heheard much of the staked plain a vaststretch of high prairie lying betweenthe forks of the Brazos in Texas andthe Pecos river in New Mexico and hedetermined to make a hunting trip outinto this country where perhaps hemight find a good range on which tostart his ranch For this purpose hewent to the little town of Venaditathen on the far border bearing withhim a letter of introduction to WilliamCarter the principal merchant of theplace Carter received him cordiallyand gave him full information as to thebest routes to take and the outfit hewould require and with it a warningThere is danger from the Indiansalways ou the staked plain he saidIt is the ranging ground of the Comanehes and Kiowas and if you shouldfall in the way of a bandof these Indians they will attack you if they cando it without too much riskBut I thought these Indians were allonk reservations under guard saidCatlettOh theyve made treaties and movedtheir lodges to a reservation thatstrue said Carter But it doesntmake much difference The bucks stayon the reservation enough to draw rations and get their yearly presentsTheyvget passes from the agent to goout and hunt or slip away withoutleave and then theyre ready for anydeviltrytbat offers The troops andrangers and cowboys together cantkeep them from stealing horses andtaking white scalps and many a lonev herder hunter and emigrant outfit is9 wiped out with none to tell the taleYoud better see if you can get SamBronson to go with you Hes a goodman every way and he knows thestaked plain and the Comanehes aswell as any man in TexasThe same day the merchant introduced Catlett to Sam Bronson Theman was of a different style from thered shirted cowboys who with widebrimmed hats leather chaperidos andflawing spurs rod into Venadita nowand then for a spree and sometimesshot up the town Beside these picturesque dashing riders silent unassuming Sam Bronson in his plain suit- of California overalls stuff looked un-romantic and commonplace But wheniCatlett on the next day saw Bronsonwith his rifle knock the spot throughthe ace of hearts on a playing cardnailed to a tree at 50 yards away firingoffhand he decided that here was the-- man h wanted Two davs later thevtheir start for the staked plainhorseback driving a pack mule carrying blankets flour bacon salt coffee and ammunition for a months tripFor fresh meat they depended upongame for these were days when the bufJfaJo roamed the plains and once awayfrom the settlements it- was seldomthatja herd of these shaggy headedbeasts or a band of graceful antelopesomewhere in view of -the twohuntersThe staked plain where now the cat-fhand sheep of many ranchmen pas-- ture was then an arid unpeopledK prairie The water courses which cutihe plain lire commonly dry except forVa few hours following- heavy rains butthere are springs and water holeswhich the buffalo and the Indians butonly a few white men knew about atthe time of which I write It beingJuly the beginning of the rainy seasonthe springs were flowing freely andthe water holes were full but Bronsonknew that the showers which made thegrass green and covered the prairie withflowers brought the Comanehes sureof feed -for their ponies from the reservation seeking human prey and bootyand without showing anxiety he notedevery sign that might indicate theirpresenceTo Catlett with the keen joy in lifethat comes from health and out-of-doorexercise the expedition was what hecalled a good deal of a picnic Bronson in his quiet way was a very interesting companion Sometimes as thehunters rested at night before rollingthemselves in their blankets the guidetold stories drawn from his own experience of Comanche and Kiowaraids and fightings but as yet theyhad seen no signs of Indians Bronsonspoke one night about turning backtoward the settlements soon but Catlett was eager to continue the trip Soit was agreed that they should keexon their course a day or two longerand then passing round some bluffsthat lay to the northward return toVenadita by another routeThe next da3 about the middle ofthe forenoon they came to a deep drywater course such as the southwesternplainsmen call arroj os leadingsouthward from the bluffs Each bankfell sheer downward 20 feet and thewide sandy channel between was perfectly dry Following an old buffalotrail the hunters found a crossingthe only one possible for man or beastwithin a distance of many miles Before descending into the arroyo Bronson hesitated looking northward- to thebluffs where a dimness appeared in thesky elsewhere bright and clearTherell be water running in thischannel before the sun goes down hesaid as a streak of lightning quiveredbeyond the bluffs Theres a thunderstorm gathering about the head of thearroyoThey crossed the water course andcontinued on their way until noonwhen they halted They bad begun t ounsaddle their horses when a sharpfrom Bronson called Catlettsattention and he saw the guide drawing tight the saddle cinch he had justbegun to loosenKeep the saddle on your horse andsee that its well clinched Dont lookaround as if you suspected anythingBronson said without lifting his headI think theres some hard riding forus to do pretty quick Are you readyGet on your horse and take the backTHE BOTJEBON NEWS tEDAY JANUARY 28 1898themselves and the Indians much lessshake off the tireless pursuit JJAs they rode the thunder growledlightning flashed from the dark cloudin the north and the heavy rain concealed the bluffs from view while theskj was clear above the stretch ofprairie ou which the two men and theirpursuers were riding their race for lifeor death The horses panted painfullyand their sides were flecked with foamwhen at last the hunters reined themat the brink of the arroyo Down thechannel which four hours before theyhad crossed on dry sand a muddy current extending from bank to bankwas pouring with a rising flood behindit They put their horses at the wateralready risen to their stirrups plungedthrough it and gained the other bankLooking up from mid stream Catlettsaw the gathering flood sweeping dowiilike a waterfall Ten minutes laterthey would have come too late to crossKeep straight on but dont forceyour horses pace any more saidBronson as they came up on the prairie levelThe hunters had lost time in crossing and they were about 100 yardsabove the brink as the foremostComanche got to the opposite bankSeeing the white men still runningaway the Indians not hesitatingdashed down in the arroyo one afteranother Then Bronson slipped fromhis saddle threw the bridle rein overthe horses head so that the animalshould not wander about and with hisrepeating rifle in his hand ran back tothe arroyoFollow me he called to Catlettand in half a minute more from thearroyos brink his rifle was speakingsharply to the Comanchesdown in thechannel Catlett reaching the bankhalf a minute later saw the Indiansstrung in a line extending from the further bankUo mid stream their poniesstruggling- in the swift swelling current iow risen to their shoulders inwhich they could neither swim notstand A Comanche diappearing beneath the surface a red stain m theripples closing above him a dead ponyrolling and bumping as the currentswept him down the channel two riderless ponies dashed back through thestream and two wounded warriorswhom their comrades were helping toward the other bank were evidencesof the deadly work already done byBronsons weaponA Comanche on his guard is a difficult mark to hit Sitting in his saddle at the flash of the rifle aimed athim he darts his horse swiftly to leftor right and in battle he uses the animal as a shield swinging down fromthe saddle along its side discharginghis rifle or arrows from beneath itsneck But here with their poniesINDIAN AFTER INDIAN FELL FROM HIS HORSEtrail but dont move out of a walk unless I give the word Never mind thepack mule

ponies -with bodies naked to thewaist and faces brightly painted carrying lances bows and rifles theycame 25 in number the most skillfuland daring riders of all the Indiantribes They were a third of a mileaway but their fleet ponies were swiftly closing the distanceWe must get to the arroyo ahead ofem said Bronson and set the spurshard into his horses flank Its a tenmile run with our lives at stakeBoth the hunters had good horsesand they put them to their full speedThe Indians in their first rush camewithin a quarter of a mile of them butafter that the hunters managed tokeep this distance

But ride as they might theycould not widen he ipace betweenfloundering in swift water the Indianscould employ none of their customarytactics It was only the hunters stratagem iu pretending to continue theirflight that could have led the Indiansto attempt the crossing Now findingthemselves entrapped the Comaneheshad turned their ponies and were getting back to the other bank as fast asthey were able Catlett lost no timein setting to work firing wildly at firstas greenhorns do in their first fightbut gaining in steadiness as he shotSome of the Indians who had gainedthe opposite bank fired on the huntersbut the Comanche is not a good marksman at long range and their bulletswent wild Indian after Indian fellfrom his horse to be swept away by thecurrent and twice as many woundedones rode or were

which soon was running tenfeet deep with water would have heldthem back ior 24 hours at least Leisurely hunting as they went the twomen took their Way back towardVenadita where they arrived a fortnight later safe and soundAfter his experience Catlett decidedthat the enterprise- of stock raising onthe staked plain would be to too hazardous Instead he bought a ranch withrin a- half days ride

gossiping or occupyingeach others households for a largefraction of the 24 hours should directhis or her observation to the modernapartment building It is one of themost remarkable things in our latterday nineteenth century urban life thiscustom of people not knowing eachother in flats It is only necessary toconsider all the reasons and inducements for women living in separatebuildings knowing each other to behighly astonished that they so oftendont or rather so rarely do When theylived in the country four miles fromeach other they were on terms of themost cordial and frequent intercourseBut now that they are under the sameroof and have to pass each others doors20 times a day en route to their ownhomes their testimony even on the identity of their neighbors would not be admitted by an anti corporation jurjIt is truly remarkable and must appear eo to all dwellers in flats this lackof acquaintance The very air of suchbuildings seems to preclude familiarityand the ice that each tenant wraps himself up in is of that inexorable arctickind that is never broken There is noetiquette of new resident calls such asobtains with all who inhabit detachedhouses There are nochance meetingsor conversations while inspecting thegrowth of the vines or sewing on theside porch On the contrary- every regulation every offshoot every tendencyof a flat building is toward isolationThe hollow of a rock in the desert is nothalf so good a place for av family to conceal itself or its affairs from the worldPerhaps flats are too new an institution to have a settled status suited tothose people who like a little of the oldfashioned country wa al knowing people occasionally within a mile or twoof where one lives It is certainly almost inexplicable how people can comeand go out of their homes day afterday where a false step would almostthrow them into their neighbors apartments without ever knowing or cultivating that neighbor to more than theextent of a most frigid bow It is certainly one of the most marked featuresabout apartment- buildings even thebest of them It might be objected thatpersons living in flats do this by reasonof knowing less about each other thanthose sheltered by brick and stone putup in other shapes But this can haveno weight in places where the householders are all people of means and position in the community Here the samedistinguishing characteristic of flat lifeholds good The woman on the firstfloor knows all about the woman on thesecond her husbands business whatchurch she goes to and everything butthe lady

telephone the lawyerto come and see this lady at the hotelon business The attorney was naturally a little anxious as to the nature ofthe business and he was informed in anindirect fashion that a divorce waswanted Enough was said to let himinfer that it would be a good case witttilots of fine advertising and best of allprospects of a good fee in the event of asuccessful termination of the litigationThe conspirators secreted themselvesnear the hotel parlors at the hour setand waited developmentsAhem said the attorney I calledin response to 3our requestWhat request she asked surprisedIm

through which the water runscome down through the center of thecarrel and terminate in this box Thebox to have the bottom side out thepipe to come through the top of thebox Get some nice clean gravel put ina layer of gravel and then a layer ofcharcoal and so on till the barrel ishalf full or more arrange it so that helast layer will be of gravel Just abovethe last layer put in the pipe that runsinto the cistern Cover the barrel wellso that nothing can get into it from thetop When it rains let the water init will filter from bottom to lop insteadof vice versa Have the barrel sittingon two

farms which in many instancesare two or three miles away Theyoften stack hay and grain in smallfenced lots or corrals on an uplandspot where an artesian well or reservoir furnishes water and there feedhorses and cattle during the severestmonths of the winter Numerous devices have been used in hay stackingsome being too expensive and othersbeing patented by unknown partieswho occasionally demanded royaltiesfor the use of their ideasThe most complete and the cheapestdevice yet discovered is what isPOLE STACKERally called the pole stacker It is simple in construction easily handled andis not patented Although in usebut two or three years the pole hasbecome a universal favorite and can beseen in many fields corrals and stock-yardsThe material necessary for the polestacker consists of two poles 20 and 30feet or longer as desired three pulleys two chains and two ropes Theshort pole usually a dry red pine or balsam is -set about three feet in theground after slats have been nailed onor pins driven in auger holes every twofeet which makes a ladder for gettingup and down when necessarjr to fix thetop chain or drop the lifting pole Ashort chain is fastened around thestanding pole and left to drop abouttwo feet where it hooks arourid thestacker This gives the pole plentj ofplajT and enables the man on the stackor wagon to swing it around at willThe long pole is chained at the butt endwith a chain -which regulates the heightof the stack and holds the stacker inplace after being swung around for thehay on the wagon The pulleys ropesand fork are handled as with otherstackers

dipihthoritic disease and contagious There are distempers and influenzas that stow similar symptoms that may not be contagious but genuine roup with swelling of head discharges of matter fromnostrils eyes etc- is contagious andthe disease has been communicatedfrom fowls to human beings It canbe prevented by removing the one twocr three sick fowls to a hospital andeither taking the entire fiook of wellfowls to fresh clean comfortable quarters or by disinfecting the ed quarters thoroughly with zenoleum orchloro naphtholeum or a weak solutionof carbolic acid Saturate roosts sidesfloor everything

theresult might be serious The recentreport of the bureau of animal industry on infectious diseases among poultry gives numerous cases of the diseases passing to human beings Treatment in the first stage is all right andoften arrests the disease It consistsmostly of good hygienic conditions removal of all excavations local application of disinfectants comfortable wellventilated quarters etc
