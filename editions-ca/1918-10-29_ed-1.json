The Republicans and their Louis
ville .organ are. making loud asser
tions mat tneir candidates- are sure
of election in the Fifth District, but
they are not sustained by the facts.
In the nrst place the registration
shows a safe Democratic majority and
it is -a well known fact that most of
those who registered as independent
win vote for Stanley and Sherley.
Both will carry the district by safe
majorities vsince most people who give
the matter thought, recognize the
overwhelming merits of each". They
know that Governor Stanley has
made a splendid record as Congress
man and as Governor and has kept
full faith with the, people, while Mn
Sherley's position in Congress makes
him almost indispensible in the win
ning of the war. As chairman of the
Appropriations Committee he has had
to handle all the war expenditures
and his seryices have been such ai to
make even his enemies praise him;
Uncle Joe Cannon, who once held the
position, saying that he has made the
best chairman he has 'even known.
President Wilson needs both. Sherley
and Stanley to give him the unflag
ging assistance for which he appeals
and the voters of the Fifth District
will respond most loyally.. The ef
fort to make the impression in the
country that Louisville will repudi
ate both is a falsehood that can only
be characterized properly by the
shorter and uglier word. Put no con
fledence in it, but do your best to
make the majorities of Stanley and
the other Democratic nominees rec
ord breaking.

Extracts From Gov. Stanley's
Speeches. "
On March 16, 1913, Governor Stanley,
made a speech 'in Cincinnati, Ohio. The
Cincinnati Enquirer, a Democratic news
paper, in its issue of March 17, 1918, re
ports his speech as follows:
He also sailed into the Prohibi
tionists by declaring there is little
use "of our boys laying down their
' lives for liberty in France "if a lot
of fanatics and cranks" are allowed
to deprive Americans of liberty at
home. "These fanatics are worse
.tyrants than the Kaiser, and are
bigger fools," was his parting shot.
This was quoted in an editorial in the
Lexington Herald, also a Democratic news
paper, in its issue of date March 19, 1918,
and that paper made this comment:
Would it not be better for the
'Governor of Kentucky, in whom is
invested the supreme executive
power of the State, to exert himself
to provide a force to preserve peace
in Kentucky, than to be "over
there" across the Ohio declaim
ing about "pellets of lead from flam
ing rifles" and denouncing Prohi
bitionists as "worse tyrants than the
Kaiser and bigger fools?"
