Amateur Aeroplanes.
Very small boys of the East side
have solved unconsciously the prin
ciples of the box kite and the aero
plane. They take an ordinary paper
bag, cut the end out of it so that it
remains merely a cylinder of paper,
tie a short bit of string to the end
where the bottom used to be for a
tall, then attach the end of a spool of
thread to the opposite end of the bag
The Improvised kite flies easily and
steadily as high as the roofs of the
tallest tenements. New York Sun.

In proportion to population, and con

home life, than in Australia. No mat

remote it may be from large cities,
a piano is usually a leading feature
of it. About 15,000 pianos are sold
every year in the country.

SURF RIDING IS FINE
KANAKA STANDS AMIDST THE
SWIFT RUNNING WAVES.
Jack London's! VLvid Description of
This South Sea Amusement a
Practiced at Waikiki Beach.
Much has been written about the"
native sport of surf riding in the South
seas, but the following description
from London's "Cruise of the Snark,"
is novel and very vivid. The locality
referred to is Waikiki beach, near
Honolulu:
The trees grow right down to the
salty edges of things, and one sits in
their shade and looks seaward at a
majestic surf thundering in on the
beach to one's very feet. Half a mile
out, where is the reef, the white head
ing combers thrust suddenly skyward
out of the placid turquoise blue and
come rolUng in to shore.
And suddenly, out there where a
big smoker lifts skyward, rising like a
seagod from out of the welter of
spume and churning white, on .the
giddy, toppling, overhanging and
downfalling, precarious crest appears
the dark head of a man. Swiftly he
rises through the rushing white. His
black shoulders, his chest, his loins,
his limbs all is abruptly projected on
one's vision. Where but the moment
before was only the wide desolation
and invincible roar, is now a man,
erect, full stattrred, not struggling
frantically in that wild movement, not
buried and crushed and buffeted by
those mighty monsters, but standing
above them all, calm and superb,
poised on the giddy summit, his feet
buried in the churning foam, the salt
smoke risfng to his Xnees, and all the
rest of Mm in the free air and flashing
sunlight, cmd he is flying through the
afr, flying forward, flying fast as the
surge on which he stands. He fs a
Mercury a brown Mercury. His heels
are winged', and in them is the swift
ness of the sea. In truth, from out of
the sea he Iras leaped upon the back
of the sea, and he is riding the sea
that roars and belTows and cannot
shake him from its back. But no
frantic ontreaching and balancing is
his. He is impassive, motionless as a
statue carved' suddenly by some mir
acle out of the sea's depths from which
he rose. And straight on toward
shore he flies on his winged heeTs and
t&e white crest of the breaker. There
is a' wild burst of foam, a long multi
tudinous rushing sound as the breaker
falls futile and spent at your feet;
and there, at your feet steps calmly
ashore a Kanaka.
Greerr Turtles of Indiarr Ocean.
Concerning the great turtles of the
South-west 'Indian ocean a traveler
says: "The cheloman, or green turtle
(Chelbne mydas), fs an animal of con
siderable economic importance to the
ato$T, for it stilT occurs in the vast
hordes which are so often described
by early voyagers in the tropics.
There appear to be two distinct
groups one resident and small in
numbers, the other migratory and vis
iting the atoO to breed in numbers
impossfble to estimate.
"The latter arrives in December,
and from then to April the sea seems
alive with turtle. The females seek
the small sand beaches and then as
cend them with the rising tide, push
ing themselves laboriously above high
tide mark. Holes are then dug in the
sand by means of the fore flippers un
til a satisfactory one is obtained, and
the eggs, 200' in number, are buried,
the turtle returning to sea immediate
ly. "After forty days the eggs hatch,
afrnost simultaneously, and the young
turtles dig their way up out of the
sand and go down to the sea in a long
procession in the course of which they
offer an easy prey to their enemies,
the- frigate birds and herons. Once in
the sea sharks and other large fish
eat them, and only 10 per cent, reach
.maturity.'"
Smoke Dissipated.
The practical way to ouViate the an
noyance of smoke is to dissipate it
before it leaves the chimney top in a
gaseous volume. A German professor
believes he has found a way to secure
this result without chemical or me
chanical aid.
Described in Die Umschau, the pro
fessor's chimney is perforated on all
sides by what might be called little
horizontal windows. As the furnace
smoke and gases rise they are mixed
with air, both before and after emer
gence, by the eddy forming action of
the wind passing through the open
ings. From the time the smoke enters
the chimney and reaches the height of
the lower openings, which receive the
wind from any quarter, the intermin
gling begins, and in each stage of iis
upward movement the volume be
comes less and less. At the mouth of
the chimney the outpour is compara
tively small and so diluted with air
that only a sheet of dark blue smoke
waving like a flag to the leeward is
seen, where, under other conditions;
there would be a cloudlike column of
dense black smoke a mile long.
Chimneys constructed on the pro
fessor's plan look not unlike windowed
towers. -
A Cool Costume.
Rather startling is the announce
ment in a seaside paper that "tan
shoes are very much worn this Bum
mer. Hundreds of the cottages wear
nothing else." A pair of t tar. shoes
aeriaiuly makes a very cqqI costurao.
