Through the Daily News Bandmaster
Geo. Michaels whose splendid concert
band has. delighted the crowds at the
Bourbon Fair this week; series to ex
tend thanks for the many evidences of
appreciation of the band's work shown
by the patrons. Miss Hamman, the
soloist, also added her testimony say
ing that she never sang to more ap-
-prefjitive auditors.
L) niug the heavy rain Friday aftei
noon the band and Miss Hamman both
worked under discouraging conditions,
with the rain pelting on them ana
having to contend with the noise of
the crowded amphitheatre. But they
graciously and courteously accepted
the situation and rendered the selec
tions in their accustomed perfection,
without a hitch. Mr. Michaels de
clares the auidences of the week at
the Bourbon Fair to have been the
most considerate of any to which his
band had played lately and hopes
through the Daily News to acquaint
everyone with the personal thanks of
Miss Hamman, the band and himself.
At the fair this afternoon Miss
Hamman will by special request sing
"Old Kentucky Home" accompanied
by the full band. In the closing hours
of the fair the band will render a
special prorgam of medleys, embrac
ing all gthej well known and popular
Southern airs. During the playing of
thefee airs "the whole crowd is expect
ed to warble and accompany' the
band," to use Bandmaster Michaels'
own words "Let everybody sing" and
make theclosing numbers of the musi
cal program one glorious and joyous
burst of melody. Sing your best and
loudest.
Splendid Show Tonight.
Manager Porter, of the Paiis Grand,
witnessed the performance of the
Cohurn Minstrels at Cyntbiana, and
pronounced it one of the best minstrel
shows he ever saw. Manager Coburn
has secured a company of artists this
season which are not surpassed by any
of the so called "big" shows. His
singing crew are all "headliners" and
his bunch of comedians, headed by the
prince of them all, Charley Gano and
including Tom Post, Sonny Dinkle and
numerous others, don't give you time
to quit laughing at one funnyism be
fore they have you going on another
one. It only comes once in a season.
Therefore, don't miss it.
Robinson's Circus is Tied Up.
Robinson's circus, scheduled to ap
pear in this city next Monday, will in
all probability fail to make this town
owing to the fact the show is teid up
in Morganfield, Ky. The entire show
passed into the hands of a reciever
and is tied up in that city until a
settlement is made. The liabilities
show a schedule of over $15,000 while
the assets are not given. It is report
ed the cause of the assignment was
due to a disagreement among the
managers.

THEATRICAL.
COBURN'S GREATER MINSTRELSY
The nex attraction at the Paris
Grand on Saturday night will be a wel
come return of an old favorite in Paris.
Coburn's Greater Minstrel3 with com
plete new program, people and equip
ment will be the attraction tonight.
This company requires little endorse
ment, from the local press. It is like
seeing "home folks"to see Joe Coburn
and his men coming up the street for
the yearly concert and the renewal of
old acquaintances.
The Macon Telegraph says: "It is
always pleasant to have Joe Coburn
come to town. There is no man at the
head of a minstrel company who can
boast of more friends than he, and any
man whu tries as hard as he to give a
clean, clever minstrel entertainment,
deserves it." This paper cordially en
dorses the Telegraph's statement
"always a clean, clever performance,"
each season growing bigger and bet
ter. Get your seats today at Mitchell
& Blakemore's.
"THE MAN ON THE BOX."
The Columbus, Ohio, papers say the
above play pleased their citizens better
than "The Wolf" and as Manager Por
ter, of the Grand, has both shows, our
people will know what to expect from
"The Man On the Box." The Chilli
cothe, Ohio, Democrat of last week
said Manager Morgan of the Masonic,
gave ihs patrons a rare treat when he
booked "The Man On the Box." Lo
cal theatre goers pronounce the per
formance the best ever put on in Chil
licothe. The troupe was undoubtedly
from the larger circuits and put on a
show seldom equaled in the samller
towns. The play itself was a .good,
one and the actors played their parts
to perfection. "The Man On the Box"
will be ahe attraction at the Paris
Grand Monday night, September 11.
