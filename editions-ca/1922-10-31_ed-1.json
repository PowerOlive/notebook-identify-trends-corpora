GOOD EQUIPMENT TO HELP
FAEMEBS IN SHORT COURSE
Farm men and boys -of the State
who attend the annual winter short
course in agriculture which opens
November 1 at the College of Agri
culture will have the advantage of
equipment that should make it pos
sible for them to get many pointers
on better farming, according to
Thomas P. Cooper, dean of the col
lege. A large farm, herds of pure
bred livestock, flocks of purebred
poultry and the results from soil ex
periment fields in different parts of
the State all will be put to use In
showing those who attend the short
course how the farm back home can
be made a little better.
Work in connection with soils, the
raising of crops, orcharding, beef
cattle, hogs, sheep, dairy cattle and
poultry is being carried out on the
college farm of 243 acres, which is
near the university campus. On this
farm also are beef cattle barns, a
dairy " barn, sheep barn, poultry
houses, a hog cholera serum plant,
a laboratory and hospital for the
study of' animal diseases, a large
livestock judging pavilion, a farm
machinery and gas engine labora
tory and a greenhouse.
In addition to this farm, the col
lege operates eight soil and crop ex
periment fields on different soil
areas of the state. The results that
have been obtained on these fields
in raising crop yields through the
use -of different fertilizers will be
studied and their relation to the
soils of the various regions repre
sented by the students explained.
The college also owns herds of
purebred dairy and beef cattle as
well as purebred hogs, -sheep and
Percheron mares. A large, well
equipped poultry plant is a part of
the farm equipment. Further study
of livestock problems is made possi
ble by the many famous breeding es
tablishments to be found within a
short distance of Lexington.
The first term of the course will
continue until December 21, while
the second term will open January
3, 1923, and continue until Febru
ary 24. Students may take either
one or both of the terms of work.
