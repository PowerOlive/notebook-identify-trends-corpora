momentFive minutes later the operation hedbeen successfully performed and Hendricks freshly bandaged was recliningeasily in his chairNow you get some sleep and remain quiet said the doctor mixingsome medicine at the windowKubbish muttered the detectiveDo you mean that I am to stay pennedup here all Cay to deyAnd all week this week imitatedLampkinHendricks face darkenedBut 1 simply cant he grumbledI never had more to do in my lifeand if I halt now my assailant will havegained by his cowardly atteck No noold friend you must not stop me nowthat I have something fresh to startfrom I have tasted blood and like abloodhound I must go on on I tellyou I have the vilest scoundrel to dealw ith that ever breathed and it is to bea fight to the death between usit might kill you to leave your roominside of a week was the doctors firmreply If you go out and die from ityour enemy will have gained his pointThe words told on the detective Hisface fell and Lampkin noticed his lowerlip twitching There was a hint ofmoisture in the big gray eyes lieturned to his mother who sat near thegrate her face in her handsLeave us alone mother he said1 want to tell Lampkin how it happened As for staying in Ill take hisadvice He knows his business and Iknow nothing else will content youOh Fm so glad cried the old ladyand she came to him and parted his hairon the brow and kissed himCHAFTER IXWhen the door had closed behind herHendricks gave a deep sigh and smiledfaintlyShe doesnt know what an awfullynarrow escape I had he began WhenI retired last night I was so overcomewith fatigue that I hardly could taketime to undress I actually fell asleepwhile sitting on the side of the bedto take off my boots I almost tumbledto the iloor and that roused me sufficiently to complete the operationThe iirst intimation of danger cameto me in a dream I thought I was inthe basement of a burning buildingconfined in a room the walls of whichwere solid masonrv and the doors ofiron I seemed to be choking and gasping for breath It was no dream itwas reaiity as far as the stifling sensation was concerned for on waking Ifound my arms pinioned a weight onmy breast and a towel saturated withchloroform held tightly over my nostrilsMy Lord it was awful Every veinin me seemed on fire I felt as if I hadbeen pumped full of ignited gas Itried to scream but my human nightmare prevented that or the slightestmovement on my partAll at once the thought struck intomy benumbed consciousness that I wasin the clutch of my secret foe and withthat came a sort of repugnant desperation that had strength I threw out myright hand and catching the tOWelwrenched it from my nose and thensucked down into me a whiff of Godspure air It seemed to act on me likereleasing a gigantic spring ior Ihurled him from me as you would astinging lizard I heard him strike themiddle of the floor and grunt as thebreath went out of him Then I felthastily under my pillow and missingmy revolver and hearing a click fromwhere he crouched I knew that he hadnabbed it I was on my feet in a moment and you can bet I did some talldodging in the darkness for I knew Iwas his target I saw him moving as Imoved trying to get an aim at me andall the time I was edging sometimeserect again on all fours toward thecorner where I knew tliat old swordstood a relic of the EevoiutionBefore he pulled the trigger I hadhold of it He heard it rattle andblazed away His bullet struck thebrass scabbard glanced off and crashedinto that mirror there The flash helpedme locate him and jerking my weapon from its rusty sheath I dashed athim hoping to cut him down before hegot another shot My first furiousthrust with such a formidable weaponastonished him and he backed cockingthe gun as he did so I gave him a stabright at the breast It would have runa two inch plank through but it hadno more effect on him than if I hadstruck the iron sides of an Americanman-of-war He had on a bullet proofsuit of clothes I heard him laughderisively and then he fired again Ifelt the twinge in my side just as mymother screamed below and then I wasa lost overpowered by the thoughtthat she would rush to my rescue andget killed along with me I dashed athim cut at the hand holding the revolver and was rewarded by hearing theweapon strike the floor at his side Isaw him stoop for it and plunged myswords point at his back It rebounded as if it had struck cork The nextlick was dealt at his hand as it gropedtoward the pistol I knocked his armout and he fell sprawling on the floorThe mistake I made then was in trying to get possession of the revolver forwhen I reached for it he bounded to hisfeet and hissing like a cat sprang outat the open window through which hehad come I saw his head and shoulders disappear below the sill just as Isecured the gun I ran to the windowand saw him crawling down the slanting roof of the conservatory Remembering his armor I took aim at the backof his neck but I was too shak to shootwell and missed Before my iinnervedfingers could cock the revolver again hewas out of sight and I heard the gatein the rear close with a slamI started in pursuit down the frontstairs but when I reachedthe first landing I met my mother and keeled overin a dead faint The drug and thewound were too much for me I cameto in a moment and prevented her fromnotifying the police or the neighbors ofthe accident Then it was four oclockI tried to get a message to you butfailed on the first attempt Thats thewhole account of my adventuresYou have certainly had a tough timeof it declared Dr Lampkin At whosedoor do you lay the attackIt is the work of the villain who setthe bomb for me and I am now prettysure he is involved in the Palace HotelaffairWhat GielowHendricks mused a moment then hesaidThis attempt and the other showing such positive enmity to me personally make the whole business the biggest mystery of my experience Besides there is another clew which tendsto lead me away from the idea of implicating the artistWhat is thatHendricks gazed at the open fire asif debating how to express himselfclearlyYou remember he began that theletter Miss Huntington showed us purporting to be Caruthers at Philadelphiawas forged of course since Carutherswas dead when it was writtenI remember said Lampkin with asudden startYou also recall that I spoke to herof certain idiomatic expressions in itshowing that it was written by a foreignerYes quite wellHendricks smiled and stroked hiswounded sideGielow didnt write that letter Nowwhat foreigner have we reason to suspect of having had a hand in thismatterBantinni exclaimed the doctorrising excitedly My Lord why did Inot think of that before And he isa suitor for the hand of the heiress besidesThe detective smiled He was at oneof his old games of trying the effect ofconflicting evidence on his friendYou have forgotten one other thingand there you are he grinned Whatabout Gielows confessionDr Lampkins face fell He was silentfor several minutesYou are incorrigible he broke outsuddenly I dont make sport of youwhen you come nosing around in myprofession I sit down and give you thebenefit of all there is in itThe detective smiled apologeticallyYou are at liberty to retaliate at anytime he returned Besides if I let youon to the climaxes of my cases before Ireached them youd lose interest andId not have the pleasure of your companionshipDr Lampkin took his hat to leaveI must get back to the office hesaid good naturedly Ill drop in thisafternoon Remember you are to stayin this room a week at the very shortestCHAPTER XDespite his strong will and determination not to yield to weakness Hendricks was compelled to remain in hisroom longer than he expected But hismind was not idle Every time DrLampkin called he found him engagedin some investigation pertaining to themurder of CaruthersYou mjght as well go out and bedene with it remarked Timpkin oneDont you know youll never getstrong again as long as you keep yourbrain on the race trackHendricks looked down sheepishlyI dont think you ought to begrudge a fellow the little he can accomplish in a room the size of this whenSergt Denham and his aides are turning the earth upside downLampkin walked to a window impatientlyWho is that red headed man in thedrawing room he asked sharplyOh exclaimed the detective Yousaw him then I told Kitty to hide himbehind a screen till you had come andgoneShe obeyed jour orders all rightreturned the doctor smiling but I presume she didnt know who I was forshe hustled me behind the screen alsoand said Sor will you plaise to sitthere quiet like till the doctor comesand goes away Master has orders notto see anybodyI sat still until the girl had goneout then I rose to come up here quietly but the red headed man got up too1 came first if you please said he Ima busy man and Ive waited as long onthat doctor as Im a going toBut Im the doctor said I and hefaintedHendricks laughed heartily holdinghis hand over his wounded sideWho is the fellow demandedLampkinHe is a prominent employe in acrematory near New YorkWhat do you want to seeaboutHendricks drew himself up a littlehigher in his chairRing that bell there twice he saidIt is the signal agreed on between meand Kitty She will show him up andyou can be present at the interviewLampkin rang as directed and a moment later the red headed individualwith

before the senate but it ismpossible to say how long1 it may coninue to demand the attention of thatjody The best opinion is to the effecthat a vote will be secured Mondayaut this depends largely upon the temper of Mr Gorman and his friendswho insist upon the amendment of theirmy bill so as to further curtail theize of the army in 1901If the debate should be continued toiny considerable length the actionwould be generally accepted as indicating an intention to force an extra session as all admit that with as manyippropriation bills as are pending itis impracticable to give very muchmore time to the army bill and stillpass the supply bills before the 4th instant There is yet noianger of failure on eitherthe army bill or the appropriationbills No senator can be found whoavows himself desirious of forcing1a ealled session Hence the generalbelief that all these measures will become laws and that when congress adjourns for the session next Saturdaylegislation will be in sueh shape as torender it safe to permit the legislatorsto remain at their homes until nextDecemberThe appropriation bills will demandalmost all the attention of the senateafter the army bill is out of the wayand the senate

25 SecretaryLong took to the cabinet meeting Friday morning two cipher cablegramsfrom Adm Dewey dated Friday morning The following are translationsManila Feb 24 Secretary of theNavy For political reasons Oregonshould be sent at onceSigned DeweyManila Feb 24 Yorktowu arrived Charleston and Petrel cruisincaround the Philippine islands Affairs more quiet DeweyWashington Feb 25 The cablegram from Adm Dewey asking for theOregon was received with surprise bythe officials here No one knew or atleast would acknowledge that heknew of the political reasons whichthe admiral says demand the immediate presence of the peerless battleship The cablegram was taken to thecabinet board and fully discussed thereThe admiral it is said possibly feelsthet the moral effect of the presence ofthe big ship upon the insurgents themselves and particularly upon that largeelement among the Filipinos that isbelieved to be restrained with difficulty from joining fortunes with Aguinaldo with whom their sympathies liewould be good But there is an underlying doubt whether or not the admiral may not be keenly sighting agathering cloud in the east and islooking to prevention of any possibleintervention or interference by European powers in the struggle now inprogress in the neighborhood of Manila It is believed that in the bifires much property of foreign residents and business concerns was destroyed That these fires were causedby the insurgents can not be deniedand it may be that some of the foreign naval commanders in the eastare disposed to seize upon the pretextthat their interests demand protectionwhich we can not afford them to makea landing or do something obnoxiousto the United States and likely to encourage the insurgents With sueh astrong naval force as would be afforded by the reinforcement of Deweysfleet by the Oregon there could not beany sound reason nor even a plausiblereason for any such action on the partof third partiesIt is said here that up to this momentthere has been no intimation of a purpose on the part of any foreign government to tile any claims for pecuniary remuneration for the property oftheir citizens destroyed in the firesand fighting at either Manila orIloilo Just what disposition wouldbe made of any sueh claims isnot indicated here though thereis ground for the belief that if itcan be shown that our naval and military and naval officers practiced theprecautions required by internationallaw in the matter of giving due noticeto foreigners of anj action in the wayof bombardment that might injuretheir property and otherwise did everj thing that could be done to protectsthe foreign interests equally with ourown then there is little foundation fora sound claim for damagesThe Oregon arrived at Honolulu onthe 5th in st according to

moments after the riflesbegan to crack the old bear was floatinglifeless in the water between two pansof ice and the cubs swimming lustilyaway from the ship among the poolsand lanes of water which intersectedthe floes in every directionQuickly the dory was lowered andwith five men started in pursuit whileothers of the party and crew scatteredover the ice to head the cubs off if theyleft the water Soon one of them walassoed and turned over to the care ofBonesteel who had followed the doraver the ice and the chase continuedafter the other Mr Bonesteel immediately found all of his college

use of teeth and clawsAfter an hours chase during whichthe dory was reenforced by a whaleboat and then by the Hope herself thesecond cub was finally headed off cornered and lassoed Then the body ofthe old bear and the growling andsnapping youngsters were hoisted onboard the former deposited amidshipsto receive the attention of Mr Figging the naturalist and the latter tiedto a ring bolt aft until a

ladies of France and indeedmany of the sober minded statesmenhave lately ben greatly upset by theappearance of the fatal crow which hasappeared only hree times before andeach time just before some dreadfulcalamity has swept over the countryIts first appearance occurred one October morning at the Petit Trianon atVersailles in 1785 and that time it flewright up on the window from whichMarie Antoinette was leaning andseemed to ask for food The queen hada biscuit in her hand and gave it toher sinister visitor It then flew awaycrying Caw cawFrom that day a dark shadow seemedto rest over the formerly spritely andgay Marie Antoinette and was onlyswept out of her life by the guillotineThe same bird is said to have flownwheeling around Napoleon just beforethe battle of Waterloo and when theemperor saw it he turned pale andseemed to lose his nerve Again it appeared just before the siege of Parisby the Germans in 1370 71 and sweptdown and gorged itself on the carrionin the cityHaving always appeared prior to somecalamity and appearing again afterseme twenty odd years when the wholeot France seems on the eve of a national upheaval it naturally seems to forebode a dark future and in order notto add more distrust and confusion tothe present situation the authoritiesbave ordered that no mention of itshall appear in any of the papeis Cincinnati EnquirerFollowing Rivers I
