Thechamber was empty and I had morethan half a mind to risk the descentwhen the door was opened andBabette stepped in I shrank back aslow as possible and observed that shewas making arrangements for someone for she placed a couple of decanters with glasses on the table arrangedthe chairs and then after taking a lookround went out once more I made upmy mind to wait and settling myselfunder the

another voice this time Latins said Noit is no use and we will want light toseeOnce more I raised myself and leanedagainst the edge of the opening eyesand ears intent There were three menIn the room Latin de Gomeron andanother whom I dicl not know butwhom I judged to be an Italian fromhis manner of pronouncing our language They were all three seated roundthe table poring over a number ofdocuments

others withoutdiscovery but it would be impossibleto escape the lynx eyes of this villainwho though young in years had all thecraft of age and who later on was toraise himself to an eminence so bad thatI know not whom to place beside himexcept perhaps those who were hisaiders and abettors I did not fear torun the gauntlet that was an easy matter but merely doing so would makeby birds take to wing and I found myself compelled once more to hold patience by the tail until the coast wasclearCHAPTER XIXPLAIN HENRI DE BOURBONIn a little I began to cool and soughtmy room determined to occasionallytake a turn to the turret and see if theguard was gone but not to harass myself by watching them continuallyIn about an hour or so I weariedof sitting and looked out of mywindow again in the direction of madames room as I called it to myself Atthe moment of my doing so the shutter that was open toward my side suddenly-closedI could just make out aflash of white fingers on the dark woodwork and then the face I longed to seelooked out from the half of the windowstill open and drew back again almoston the instant Feeling sure that shewould look out once more I leaned forward Madame did as I expected and Icould see the astonishment on her faceand hear her cry of joy She tried toconverse with me by signals on herfingers and for the first time I had occasion to bless what I had up to nowconsidered a foolish accomplishmentthat I picked up as a boy when I waswith Mgr de Joyeuse Enough thatmadame gave me to understand that shewas well treated and I let my dearknow that there were those at workwho would soon free her and perhapsthere was a word or two besides on asubject which concerned us two aloneIt was in the midst of this part of ourconverse that she drew back all atonce with a warning finger on her lipsand though I waited again for a fullhour forgetting the watchers below inthe fresh fears that began to assail meI did not see her again At theend of that time however a whitechief waved twice from the window andwas then withdrawn I turned back intomy room and now that I was certainshe was there my impatience at beingpenned tip as I was became almost insupportable and Heaven alone knowshow I held myself in from making a dashfor it and risking all on the ventureTo cut the matter short it wantedbut a few minutes to sundown when tomy relief I saw a cloaked figure Icould not recognize step out of the Toison dOr and after giving a few ordersto the guards pass briskly down thestreet They in their turn went intothe house and at last the road was clearI hesitated no further and hurrieddown the stairsAlthough I was not in a frame ofmind to observe what was going onaround me I soon became consciousthat one of those sudden fogs whichextend over the city at this period ofthe year had arisen as it were out ofnothing and in the course of a few minutes I was compelled to slacken paceand pick my way slowly and with thegreatest caution in regard to landmarks for I could not risk losing myway again The fog was not a thickone but it was sufficient united withthe coming evening to almost blur outthe streets and houses and make thefigures of passers by loom out like largeand indistinct shadows Carefully as1 had tried to impress the way on mymemory I hesitated more than onceas to the route i should take and itwas with something like a sigh of relief that I found myself at last behindSt Martins Whose spire towered aboveme a tall gray phantom Here I halted for a moment to see if one of thefew shadows that flickered now andthen through the haze might give somesignal by which 1 might recognize Pantin It was in vain and determined towait no longer I set off at a round pacewhen I was suddenly arrested by hearing the rich tones of a voice singingFrerc Jacques dormez vcusDormez vous dormez vousThe char notes rang out through thefog bringing with them a hundred recollections of the time wheu I had lastheard the chorus And the voice Thatwas not to be mistaken It was deBelin or else his ghost Without a moments hesitation I s ang back the linesadvancing at the same time in the direction in which I bad heard the voiceI had not gone 0 paces when 1 saw twotall shadows approaching me and atthe same time heard the verse againLisois I called outIt is he I heard de Pelin sayThen the shadows stopped for a moment and another and slighter figurejoined them Finally one came forward and when within a yard or so ofrne BpokeDAuriac is i youYes I was hastening to you ManI have discovered allMorbleau exclaimed the comptethe chanson was a happy thought elsewe had missed you in this fogIs Pnntin here We have not amoment to loseHe is It was he who guided ushere I have brought a friend with meDo not ask his name but speak freelybefore him and tell us exactly whatyou have discovered With thesewords he took me by the arm and led meup to the two In the shorter therewas no difficulty in recognizing PantinWhat with the mist the mask of hisface and the roquelaure that envelopedhim to the ears I could make out nothing of the stranger who did not evenanswer my salutation except by a slightinclination of the head I need not saythat I wasted no time but laid the matter before them and wound up withAnd now gentlemen we are threeswords let Pantin hasten and bringhalf a dozen of the eomptes people andI guarantee that we not

As we came up toSt Merri de Belin shopped and blewsharply on a whistle There was an answering call and from under tje flamboyant portico of the church the figureof a man with a led horse slipped

Accounted ForWhen spiritualism was comparatively new and we were youngsters weised to hear delightful spooky storiesibout mysterious actions of furnitureind things which one never seems toBear nowadays I remember one aboutsome people who had guests invited to agrand dinner The table was spreadwith all the dishes but the meal hadoot yet been served The family hadgreat store of beautiful glass andchina and it was all on the table Pota moment the servants were all out ofthe dining room and just at that moment all the people in the rest of thehouse heard a deafening crash of falling dishes from the dining room therecame the sound of glassware precipitated upon the floor and crushing intofragments and in the midst of the romof this wreck there rose to the terrifiedears of the host and hostess the highlear notes of the smashing of muchthin china Everybody in the housefamily guests servants rushed to thedining room door at the same momentxpecting to see nothing less than thftable overthrown and every preciouslisb on it broken and what did they behold The table set in perfect orderwith not a thing1 on it disturbed Whathad made the aAful crash Nobodyaver knew Not a dish was even nickedin that house that day The spirits sothe story ran to us had just made aterrible ghostly crash for the fun of Hmd the alarm of the householdI remember that this story impressedme a great deal more than it wouldhave impressed me if the dishes hadreally been found smashed though itcould have been proved that no humanbeing had been in the room at the timeI had never before heard of a ghost thatwas a crash and nothing more I fancythe astonishment of those alleged people was not greater than that of afriend of mine over an episode not atall similar This gentlemans wife anddaughter were out shopping one afternoon and he reached home ahead ofthem So far from feeling grieved andoutraged at not finding them there tomake him welcome he set to workpleasantly to give them a surprise bygetting them their supper He hadntmuch in the house but he set out whathe had and placed on each of threeplates a nice lot of sardines and thenwent out to make them some tea Heot it made and came back and lookedit his table in astonishment His supper was gone The plates which he hadput on the table were there just wheiche had placed them but they were asclean as when he put them on He knewthat there was not another human being in the house What sprite hadwafted away those sardinesThis is a true story There was notanother human being in the house butthe gentleman owned two delightfulcocker spaniels and they were in thehouse Who can doubt that as theylicked the plates which had containedthe sardines they had said to themselves Go to we will make it unnecessary for our dear master to washthese plates Boston TranscriptPICTURES OF SOUNDThe Hainan Voice or Musical NoteiHay Be Photographed In aSimple MannerTo take a picture of your Toice it isonly necessary xo tie a sheet of thinstrong paper over the flaring end olan old tin horn Hold the horn withthe sheet of paper upward Take alittle pinch of fine sand and pce itin the center of the paper Then holdthe horn vertically above your face andsing a note into the lower end of theinstrument Do not blow but sing thenote Now lower the horn carefullyand look at the sand You will find thatthe vibrations of jour voice have scattered the pinch of sand into a beautiful sound picture Every note in themusical scale will produce a differentpicture So you may produce a greatvariety of them Some of these pictureslook like pansdea roses and other flowers some look like snakes and otherslike flying birds in fact there is nolimit to the variation The picturesof the notes of musical instruments aremade by holding the horn as near aspossibe to themAs Mated above sand may be usedbut lycopodium powder will produceeven better effects Lycopodium pictures may be fixed by first dissolvingthe powder in alcohol and then placingi drop of the fluid on the paper Butyou must be quick about it The alcohol evaporates in a few seconds so youmust make the sound in the horn assoon as you have deposited the dropThe small amount of liquid will notprevent the powder in it from spreading When it has spread however itwill stick the picture in its place en thepaper which may then be taken off thehorn and preservedYou may thus obtain pictures of thevoices of all your friends Commongum tragicanth with a little alcohol init also makes good pictures If youwish to see the pictures1 while they arebeing made you may employ

and objections at every interval but Hunt never ceased his joyousanticipations nor saturnine Carlyle hisinfinite demurs The listeners laughedand applauded by turns and now fairlypitted them against each other as thephilosophers of hopefulness and unhopefulness The contest continued withready wit philosophy pleasantry andprofundity and extensive knowledge ofbooks and characterThe opponents were

two more were The outrageoushoopskirt which made it impossible toenter a church pew or go up the aisleof a railway train decorously the horhible head constructions known as thewaterfall the chignon and other absurd names made with a tramework ofwire and stiffened lace woolen or hairrolls known as rats and covered withihe hair of the unfortunate wearerheavy hot and noxious to say the leastand most uncomfortable the so calledGrecian bend that came in whenhoops went out of fashion which const rained the foolish devotee to walk ina painfully deformed attitude with thebauds dangling helplessly in order tobe in keeping with the general idiocyof the whole affair all these are happily things of the past but not even thosewho patronized these fashions can remember quite how badly they lookedunless they see them revived as wasthe case in a play lately put upon theNew York stage where the attire of thewomen in the cast included the enormous hoop and also the chignonIt is said that on this occasion iheaudience went into such fits of laughterthat the play was quite drowned andwas like to have been ruined The extreme of the fashion of to day will lookquite as badly ten or twenty years fromaovv at least the hat with its hightrimmings must do so It is well topreserve a happy medium in fashion asin other passing showsIt is to be said that we go no fartherthan laughingat what is

inWinterMy opinion is that people do notdrink as much water during the fail andwinter season as they should obberved a well known ph3 sician or asmuch as is positively necessary forthem having health in view There arethousands of people who do not drinkone glass of water during the entireday people too who drink from threeto six glasses daily during other seasons of the yearWater is as necessary during thecool as during the warm seasons andthose who keep up their usual quantityregardless of seasons are benefitedthereby in their general health I donot believe in gulping down water justbecause it is convenient to drink itbut I do believe that drinking a regularliberal quantity of water each day isdemanded by the system and that whatare known as water drinkers have onthe whole much better health by so doing There are many people who havesuch a horror of getting stout that theynever drink a drop of water except thatwhich goes into their coffees teas andsoups and many of them carry it so faras to give up these so as to avoid usingwaterI have yet to see the man or womanwho has been made fat by drinkingwater while I know many who havegrown stout by avoiding it The kidneys cannot properly work unless thereare liquids consumed Stimulatingdrinks beer and the like may furnishthe liquids but the stimulation theycause and which is unnecessary for perfect health more than counteracts thebenefits derived from their use Takeany of the animals and it will be foundthey drink a regular supply of waterevery day in the year that is whenthev have any choice in the matter Itis a pretty safe rule to follow the habitsof animals 1 am sure none of themgrow fat on water alone Washington Starlinalness Partnership of MairimonThe time to begin to learn from eachother is when people are first marriedwhen life is still a playground to themand when romantic love condones whatin later jears might seem nagging orcarping criticism We are all creaturesof habit If we get used to the businesspartnership of matrimony in our youthit becomes second nature and not ahardship nor a disillusionment If people would take time to understand eachother and to cultivate mutual confidence how much easier married lifewould become in fact all life To besure we only hear of the unhappy marriages while great numbers of peopleare plodddng on together silently andhappily But there is enough

my business remarked a prominentChicago banker but now and thmsomething turns up out of the ordinaryand makes us wonder at the peculiarities of those who have dealings with usI recall an instance just now which isas yet not explained and will never beI fancy as the chief actor in it waskilled some tiaie ago in a railway accident I never knew the man personallybut he was a depositor in our bankwhose account was a personal one tothe extent of 10000 He carried thatmuch as a rule and the few checks thathe made against it never indicated whathis business was He was about 50years of age and very rarely came tothe bank Naturally 1 never gave himx thought for 10000 is not a large deposit in Chicago and beyond his deposit I had no interest in him1 happened therefore that whenone day 1 received a personal letterfrom our depositor 1 was a bit suriprised and was still more so when 1read it I do not recall the exact wording but it was to the effect that w ithina day or two a woman would present acheck drawn by him for 5000 and thatas she was unknown he wished me tosee that she received the money without trouble and that she would bringwith her a means of identification inthe person of a little girl who wouldanswer correctly the questions I mustask her as directed in his letter withthe answers as he gave them Thesequestions were simple enough beingonly the childs full name her age tothe month where born the full nameof her mother and her father and of alittle brother who was dead Fivethousand dollars was a good deal ofmoney to let go on that kind of evidence but that was all 1 had and thedepositor was in California so that Icould not see him personallyThe next day the paying teller cameto me with his eyes bulgiug saying thatabout as hard a looking case of beggarwoman as he had ever seen was at hiswindow with a check drawn to the order of Mrs Blank by Mr and thatas he did not know the womrn and thewoman did not know how she was toget the money he had come to ask meabout it 1 sent for her to come into myprivate oflice which she did bringinga little girl with her woo was no lesa picture of abject poverty than themother was All she could say was thatshe bad received the check by mail froma uirin whose name was not familiar toher with instructions to prevent it atthe bank and the money would be paidto her if she would take her little girlwith her I asked the child the questions I had been requested to ask andshe answered correctly each one whichrelieved me of further responsibilityncd 1 ordered the check to be cashedThe woman did not seem to be greatlyovercome by her good fortuue and asI could tell her nothing of the man whohad given the money to her she didntseem to have any further use for me andwent back to the paying tellers window She asked for the money in 50bills and wrapping it up in an old newspaper went out of the bank without aword to anybodyShe was no longer at the address shegave when 1 sent a messenger there tomake inquiries and her benefactor 1never saw again for he met his deathon his way east from California 1fancy he would not have told me thestory of his life but I shall always wonder if the name we carried on our bookswas

Rarely Learned at SchoolHere are some definitions of isothermsappear in American textbooks ofEttphyThose lines which are drawn throughglares with an eqnal average of temperaJbTsre are called isothermsIaotherms are lines connectingrfaoti having the same mean temperatore for particular periods as the wholeyear the winter or summeretcIf upon a map all places havingthe same mean temperature are conm hv lines such lines are caUedfeoUtermal lines or simple isothermsThese definitions are part of thetxuiA but not the whole of it It maynot lc a great calamity but the fact isthat most boys and girls leave schoolwith a misconception as to what anisotherm is and they rarely find out inlater yearsIhj aU know that two elementslatitude and altitude are the main factors in determining the mean temperature of a place that the farther aplace is from the equator and the higherit strands above sea level the cooler itsclimate is But they do not know thatiaotiwa mic maps take into account onlycos t these elements and that is latitude They eliminate the influence ofafttade The isotherm passing over thetop etf Pikes peak does not sliow themean temperature at the summit of themoixixtain but what the mean temperator would be in that immediate neigh-jgiliiiill if the land instead of risingliigh ft ove the sea stood at the level ofConf y IslandDo you see the reason for this Itmay be easily explained Most of theland loes not rise so high above the seathat the temperature is greatly affectedhy altitude To the majority of mankind latitude is a far more importantclimatic element than altitude Nowthe effects on temperature of both latitude and altitude cannot well be shownat crve man and isothermic maps weredeviled to thow the effects of latitudeand some other element such as position near the sea or in the far interiorAn isothermic line therefore does notshow the actual mean temperature of aplace on it unless that place is at sealevel But it is easy to deduce from theisotherm the actual mean temperatureof a place if we know its elevationabove the sea How this is done is veryclearly explained by Dr H R Millthe British geographer as followsThe air grows cooler by 1 degree Ffor every 270 feet of elevation abovesea level but isothermic lines show theeea level temperature In using isothermic maps vr must therefore rememberthat places GuO feet above the sea levelhave a temperature 2 degrees lowerthan the isotherms indicate places6000 feet above the sea 22 degreeslower those 12000 feet above the sea45 degrees lcvTer and the mountainelopes 18000 feet above the sea no lessthan 66 decrees lower thrn the sea leveltemperature shown by the isothermsThis accounts for the fact that none ofthe important towns in the temperatezones is situated more than 2000 feetabove the sea while in the tropics theyare built at as great elevations as 8 000or 10000 feetWeather charts are an exception tothis rule They record the actualthermometrical readings at the

a young girl so beautiful andlovely that the greatest prince of Europehad he met her even in a peasants hutmight well have turned his back uponprincesses to offer her his hand and thronebut far from having seen the light in apeasants hut she was born in the shadowof the proudest throne on the earth Itwas Marie Mcolaewna the adored daughter of tho emperor of Russia As her father saw her blooming like the May floworand sought for her all the heirs of royaltyhe cast his eyes upon the fairest the richestand the most powerful of them and withthe smile of a father and a king said toherMy child you are now of an age tomarry and I have chosen for you thoprince who will make you a queen and theman who will render yoi happyThe man who will render me happystammered the blushing princess with asigh which was the only objection towhich her heart gave utterance Speakfather she said as she saw a frown gathering on the brow of the czar speak andyour majesty shall be obeyedObeyed exclaimed the
