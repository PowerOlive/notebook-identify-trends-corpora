PEGGY HYLAND IN FIRST MOVIE
OF HOPI INDIAN KIVA
The only motion pictures ever tak
en inside of a Hopi Indian "Kiva"
are being "shot" 'by Cameraman
Rdger W. Fowler, for Fred L. Gran
ville, who is directing Peggy Hy
land in a trans U. S. A. story-scenic
film. According to the Hopi law and
custom, no white man is ever sup
posed to be allowed in a "Kiva."
"Yes, I know what a 'kive' is,"
says Miss Myland, "it is a sunken
chamber inside of which the Hopi
Indian charms and plays with his
rattlesnakes. This difual precedes
?
tut; ltuuuus snaKe nanre. t.nnt is
known to have been performed by
this tribe ever since the 16th cen
tury, when Spanish explorers en
tered this part of America. As many
aslOO snakes are used in a dance.
The rite includes the bearing Of live
serpents in the hands and mouths of
the dancers. After this, the reptiles
are placed upon -the ground where
they are sprinkled with sacred corn
meal by the squaws. Following
this, they are taken from the 'kiva'
to a sacred tent with buffalo skin,
inside of which a sacred tree is
growing. Toward the end of the
dance, the snakes are carried out of
the tent in armfuls by the men, who
conclude the dance with their mad
dash down a steep precipice at top
speed." On reaching the bottom, they
liberate the snakes by scattering
them in all directions.
"We Iiad quite a time in initiating
the Hopi Indians into the mysteries
of posing for the camera," contin-
pes the, popular Peggy. "When first
let us photograph them, but actually
amn t retuse a ten-spot in real
money plus a war tax of matches,
and pouches of tobacco. The last
named are luxuries to the Hopis, as
everything brought to them from
civilization has to be carried some
90 miles over rough roads, which
are mere trails.
"The Hopi, or Pueblo Indians, as
they are called from their village
life, have risen in New Mexico and
Arizona above the stage of savagery
into a state of semi-civilization.
They might be said to represent the
triumph of man over adverse condi
tions of the deserts and inroads of
fierce enemies of the lowest cul
ture." Peggy Hyland, who is the star of
the picture in the making, her hus
band, Fred L. Granville, the direc
tor, and Cameraman Roger W. Fowl
er, are making their cross-country
trip via motor car, having started
from the Pacific coast shortly after
the recent marriage of the popular
screen star.
It is a wonder that some of the
starving European princelings do not
go into the movies.- -
