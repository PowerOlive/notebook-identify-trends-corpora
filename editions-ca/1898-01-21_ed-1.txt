managers forSenator HannaThe investigation will drag alongfor some time if no more progress ismade at future sessions than was madeTuesday night As the senate stands19 to 17 against Hanna with SenatorBurke voting- with the democrats it isquite probable that there will be somereport adopted in that body to transmit to the United States senate Inthe house the vote is 5G to 53 the otherway and the house investigating committee may do little more than look onat the senate investigation Owing tothe majority in the house being different in political complexion fromthat of the senate it isimpossible to secure the adoption ofa joint resolution for an investigationThe charges are made by Representative Otis a member of the house andthe investigation in parliamentaryusages would belong-

furtherprocedureThe senate chamber was crowdedivhil the committee in opend from 730 to 9 p m to examine witnesses and the action of witnesses caused demonstrations of diversion The witnesses did not decline totell the names of their counsel andtheir replies showed that most eminentlawyers had been engaged in the caseThe charges of bribery were made byRepresentative Otis and the resolutionin the house was adopted by only 54affirmative votes a majority of aquorum only There are 109 membersand any measure requiring the expenditure of inoney requires 55 affirmative votes or a majority of all As

their best to draw out thewitnesses but to no avail After thefour others took their turns SenatorGarfield would close each examinationby asking Do you decline to answerquestions because your attorneys saysthis committee has no jurisdiction inthis case and has so advised youThe reply was in the affirmative andthe witnesses were excused Eachwitness was told that he was held under service by the committee andshould report Thursday night at 730or sooner if called for Among thecases city is that of Daniel Daltonwho was subpoenaed in 18S5 to bringforward taltysheets before a legislative committee Dalton refused and was brought before thehouse for contempt Dalton was subpoenaed to produce public records inhis custody and the witnesses Wednesday night claim they are asked toproduce

WeeklyWONDERFUL WISCONSIN WELLSStranpre Natural Phenomena TliatEclipse tlie Great GeysersThe great geysers of the west are no tmore wonderful phenomena than arethe blowing or whistling wells inWisconsinThese wells have been developed inthe northern part of the town of Eureka and in the southern part of the townof Sterling in Polk county west of Cumberland There are six of these phenomenal wells ranging in depth from 120to 160 feet Most remarkable of all isone dn Eureka Thiswellds 120 feetdeep and was dug 15 years ago Thefirst 20 feet is hardpan and the balancegravelBefore a stonm the wind blows out ofthis well with great force making aroaring sound that can be heard agreadistance This wind is so hotthatwaterplaced over the well will boil The current blows out only before a storm andthe severity and duration of the stormis always in exact proportion to theforce of this current and its durationbefore the storm commences It istherefore an accurate and absolutelyreliable barometer as it foretells achange from cold to hot or vice versawith equal accuracy but remains quietin settled weather no matter what thetemperature In winter a current ofair is drawn in before a change ofweather just as forcibly as it blowsout in hot weather This current of -airwill freeze the water 120 feet fromthe surface of the earth -more quickly -thanit would at the surface andthough many attempts have been madeto use a pump in it they have all failedand a number of pumps of differentmakes have been destroyed by the waterfreezing and bursting the cylinders andpipesSome years ago a house was builtover this well and a stove placed in itso that it could be heated intensely hotbut strange as it may seem this did notprevent the water from freezing andbursting pipes 115 feet from the surface and though there are bust IS or 20inches of water in the well in winterice freezes several inches in thicknessin spite of all preventives Windmillshave been tried with the same disastrous results A windlass and bucketshave also been tried but the waterfreezes over so thick in one night thata heavy stone dropped from the surfacewill not break the ice The temperatureat the Lottom of this well is so muchcolder than it is at the surface that it isextremely dangerous for anyone to venture into it In winter the heavy downward current before a storm or changeof weather will cause the water to lower while in summer the outward current causes the water to rise sometimes 15 or 20 feet The curbing in thiswell is always dry and the water of goodqualityThe other five wells referred towhich resemble this in almost everyparticular are all located within theradius of about one mile and vary indepth from about 130 to 160 feet Someof the characteristics are not so pronounced as in the well described whileothers are even more remarkableWithin half a -mile of these wells wateris obtained at a depth of from ten tothirty feet and the wells exhibit noneof these unusual or diabolical featuresChicago Inter OceanEdible OilsIn Egypt and the Soudan in Indiaand all through the east an enormoustrade is carried 6n in vegetable oilswhich take the place of our butter andmargarine products

Tuesday and Friday byWalter champSltUCE MILLER J Editor and 0rnrKINDLINESS VS ETIQUETTEHow tlie Former Triumphed Over theLatter it St PetersburgThere is an excellent story of a triumph for simple American kindlinessand common sense over diplomatic etiquette and stiff court procedure Thestory concerns a former minister of theUnited States in St Petersburg at oneof those elaborate and very formal receptions or levees which the emperorand empress give on New Years dayand several times later during the winter All the diplomats stand in linein their order of precedence and theirmajesties walk down the line to exchange greetings with each in turnOn this occasion the empress now thedowager empress was not present having just given birth to one of the younger princesses It seems that the goodwife of the American minister was inthis country occupied with a similar domestic dutyThe emperor came down the line andasked after the health of each of thegentlemen present at the same timeexchanging the usual seasonable greetings Then as was also his customlie asked of each what was the newsfrom home Tliis always meant in thediplomatic world How is my goodbrother the emperor of Germany orWhat is the news from my dear sister the queen of Great Britain and Ireland It is supposed that all of thequestions were answered with pleasant information about his fellow rulersof the globe So when he came to theAmerican minister he did ask the usualquestion I hope you have good newsfrom home Of course he did and ourlull hearted representative could notkeep it a secret Yes thank your majesty excellent news it is a boy andweighs 12 poundsIt is needless to say how the perfectly natural answer smote the assembledcorps hip and thigh It is said that awidespread titter was scarcely decorously suppressed But the good-naturedman and father even if he was aczar pretended not to notice it andsaid that he was truly glad to hear itand he hoped the minister would convey his heartiest congratulations toMme Minister He then passed on tothe next man in the line extending hisgreetings It seems that the ill-concealeddisorder among his colleagues made no impression uponthe good hearted and happy American He had forgotten somethingComing out of his place he followedthe emperor and tapping him on theshoulder said I beg your majestyspardon I failed to inquire after thehealth of the empress and the littleprincess The emperor thanked himagain with great kindness and assuredhim that both were doing as well ascould be expected And from all accounts this last exchange of domesticcompliments provoked the line intoactual laughterThis was the one good story of thegreat winter capital for days and weeksIt was whispered about at parties andtitterd over teacups until it at lastreached the ears ot the recovering empress and with the kindness which hasalways characterized her as well as herlate husband she resolved to teach thesmall minded court circle a lesson Soat the next assemblage she inede occasion to seek out the American minister as an object of her especia favorand later at the banquet in a particularly audible voice thanked him forhis kind inquiries after her health during her recent illness WashingtonPostGOLD TAKEN FROM A MINEA DiTinC in Australia Has lielled250000000 in 30 YearsThe richest gold mine in the world islocated under the thriving town ofBallarat Victoria Australia The townhas about 25000 inhabitants nearly allof whom are employed in the mineThere are more than 100 miles of tunnels under the city some of them beingat a depth of 2000 feet The entrancesto the mine which is controlled by acorporation and is known as the BandBarton and Albion councils is outsidethe The region around Ballarathas been dug over several times miners It was formerly covered by a denseforest but the trees have been choppeddown and the mark of the minersshovel and pick is visible on all sides2sTot one of the workers struck pay dirtand the work was all done in vainThe rock in which the gold is foundbeneath Ballarat is not rich in the yellow metal It yields but half an ounceof standard gold to the ton and yet theBand Barton and Albion mine hasyielded more than 50000000 in goldsince it was opened 30 years ago Thework is done so systematically and sothoroughly that it is enormously profitable in spite of the low grade of the oreThe supply of paying quartz seemspractically inexhaustible and as thevein is extensive being spread overmuch territory the mine bids fair tolast for centuriesAll of the paying veins of Australiarun north and south and have a dip of25 degrees east and west In workingthe mines a shaft is sunk until the veinis struck Then the miners work upward allowing the ore to fall backwardand downwardto the shaft throughwhich it is raised to the surface whereit is milled The workmen in the BandBarton and Albion are much morecomfortable than the workers in a coalmine There are no noxious gases andno danger from explosions Pure air isforced in through various shafts andthus into the drivers The tunnels aredrilled far apart so that there will beno danger to the city above where allis trade and bustle London Tit BitsA man

himself in our little town takesadvantage of the opportunity to pay hisrespects to the well known BrigadierGerard Then I place it upon my breastand I give my mustache the old Marengo twist which brings a gray point intocither eye Yet with it all I fearchat neither they nor you either myfriends will ever realize the man thatI was You know me only as a civilian with an air and a manner it is truebut still merely as a civilian Hadyou seen me as I stood in the doorwayof the inn at Alamo on the first day ofJuly in the year 1S10 you would thenhave known what the hussar may attain toFor a month I had lingered in thataccursed village and all on account ofa lance thrust in my ankle which madeit impossible for me to put my foot tothe ground There were three of us atfirst old Bouvet of the hussarsJacques Regnier of the cuirassiersand a funny little voltigeur captainwhose name I forget but they all gotwell and hurried on to the front whileI sat gnawing my fingers and tearingmy hair and even as I must confessweeping from time to time as I thoughtof my hussars and the deplorable condition in which they must find themselveswhen deprived of their colonel I wasnot a brigadier yet you understandalthough I already carried myself likeone But I was the youngest colonelin the whole service and my regimentwas wife and children to me It wentto my heart that they should be bereaved It is true that Villaret thesenior major was an excellent soldierbut still even among the best there aredegrees of meritAh that happy July day of which Ispeak when first I limped to the doorand stood in the golden Spanish sunshine It was but the evening beforethat I had heard from the regimentThey were at Pastores on the otherside of the mountains face to face withthe English not forty miles from meby road But how was I to get tothem The same thrust which hadpierced my ankle had slain my chargerI took advice from Gomez the landlordand from an old priest who had sleptthat night in the inn but neither ofthem could do more than assure me thatthere was not so much as a colt leftupon the whole country side Thelandlord would not hear of my crossing the mountains without an escortfor he assured me that El Cuchillo theSpanish guerrilla chief was out thatway with his band and thatt meant adeath by torture to fall into his handsThe old priest observed however thathe did not think a French hussarwould be deterred by that and if I hadhad any doubts they would of coursehave been decided by his remarkBut a horse How was I to get oneI was standing in the doorway plottingand planning when I heard the clink ofshoes and looking up I saw a greatbearded man with a blue cloak froggedacross in military fashion comingtowards me He was riding a bigblack horse with one white stocking onhis near forelegHullo comrade said I as he cameup to mejjullo said heI am Col Gerard of the hussarssaid I I have lain here wounded for amonth and I am now ready co rejoinmy regiment at PastoresI am M Vidal of the commissariathe answered and I am myself upon myway to Pastores I should be glad tohave your company colonel for I hearthat the mountains are far from safeAlas said I I have no horse Butif you will sell me yours I will promisethat an escort of hussars shall be sentback for youHe would not hear of it and it wasin vain that the landlord told himrrTHE BOTJEBON NEWS FRIDAY JANUA11Y 21 1898V-My faith it was enough to make aman mad to see this fellow riding awayso gayly to join his beef barrels and hisbrandy casks and then to think of myfive hundred beautiful hussars withouttheir leader I was gazing after himwith bitter thoughts in my mind whenwho should touch me on the elbow butthe little priest whom I have mentionedIt is I who can help you said he Iam myself traveling southI put my arms about him and as myankle gave way at the same momentwe nearly rolled upon the ground togetherGet me to Pastores I cried andyou shall have a rcary of goldenbeads I had taken one from the convent of Spiritu Sancto It shows hownecessary it is to take what you callwhen you are upon a campaign aridhow the most unlikely things may become usefulI will take you said he in very excellent French not because I hope forany reward but because it is my wayalways to do what I can to serve mycountryman and that is why I am sobeloved wherever I go With that heled me down to the village to an oldcowhouse in which we found a tumbledown sort of diligence such as theyused to run early in this century between some of our more remote villages There were three old mules toonone of which were strong enough tocarry a man but together they mightdraw the coach The sight of theirgaunt ribs and spavined legs gaveme more delight than the wholetwo hundred and twenty huntersof the emperor which I have seen intheir stalls at Fontainebleau In tenminutes the owner was harnessingthem into the coach with no very goodwill however for he was in mortaldread of this terrible Cuchillo It wasonly by promising him riches in thisworld while the priest threatened himwith damnation in the next that we atlast got him safely upon the box withthe reins between his fingers ThenJurfo -THEN HE SCREAMED HORRIBLYhe was in such a hurry to get off outof fear lest we should find ourselves inthe dark in the passes that he hardlygave me time to renew my vows to theinnkeepers daughter I cannot at thismoment recall her name but we wepttogether as we parted and I can remember that she was a very beautifulwoman You will understand myfriends that when a man like me whohas fought the men and kissed thewomen in fourteen separate kingdomsgives a word of praise to the one or theother it has a little meaning of its ownThe little priest had seemed a triflegrave when we kissed good bye but hesoon proved himself the best of companions in the diligence All the wayhe amused me -with tales of his littleparish up in the mountains and I inmy turn told him stories about thecamp but my faith I had to pick mysteps for when I said a word too muchhe would fidget in his seat and his facewould show the pain that I had givenhim And of course it is not theact of a gentleman to talk in anythingbut a proper manner to a religiousman though with all the care in theworld ones words may get out of handsometimes He had come from thenorth of Spain as he told me and wasgoing to see his mother in a village ofEstremadura and as he spoke abouther little peasant home and her joy inseeing him it brought my mother sovividly to my thoughts that the tearsstarted to my eyes In his simplicityhe showed me the little gifts which hewas taking to her and so kindly washis manner that I could readily believehim when he said that he was loved 1wherever he went He examined myown uniform with as much curiosity asa child admiring the plume of mybusby and passing his fingers throughthe sable with which my dolman wastrimmed He drew mv sword tooand then when I told him hchv manymen I had cut down with it and setmy fingers on the notch made by theshoulder bone of the Prussian emperorsaide-de-camp he shuddered and placedthe weapon under the leathern cushiondeclaring that it made him sick to lookat itWell we had been rolling and creaking on our way whilst this talk hadbeen going forward and as we reachedthe base of the mountains we couldhear the rumbling of cannon far awayupon the right This came fromMessena who was as I knew besiegingCindad Eodricro There was nothiher Ishould have wished better than to havegone straight to him for he wasthc1best Jew that I have heard of sinceJoshuas time and if you are in sightof his beaky nose and bold black eyesyoa are not likely to miss muchof whatis going on Still a siQge is alwayspoor sort of a pick-and-shovel businessand there were better prospects withmy hussars in front of the EnglishEvery mile that passed my heart grewlighter and lighter until I found myselfshouting and singing like a young ensign fresh from Saint Cyr just to thinkof seeing all my fine horses and my gallant fellows once moreAs we penetrated the mountains theroad grew rougher and the pass moresavage At first we met a few muleteers but now the whole countryseemed deserted which is not to bewondered at when you think that theFrench the English and the guerrillashad each in turn had command over itSo bleak and wild was it one greatbrown wrinkled cliff succeeding another and the pass growing narrower andnarrower that I ceased to look out butsat in silence thinking of this and thatof women whom I had loved and ofhorses which I had handled Iwas suddenly brought back frommy dreams howeVer by observing thedifficulties of my companion who wastrying with a sort of bradawl which hehad drawn out to bore a hole throughthe leathern strap which held up hiswater flask As he worked with twitching fingers the strap escaped his graspand thevooden bottle fell at my feet Istooped to pick it up and as I did so thepriest silently leaped upon my shouldersand drove his bradawl into my eyeMy friends I am as you know a mansteeled to face every danger Whenone has served from the siege of Genoato that last fatal day of Waterloo andhas had the special medal whichI keep at home in a leathernpouch one can afford to confesswhen one is frightened It mayconsole some of you when your ownnerves play you tricks to rememberthat you have heard even me BrigadierGerard say that I have been scaredAnd besides my terror at this horribleattack and the maddening pain of mywound there was a sudden feeling ofloathing such as you might feel weresome filthy tarantula to strike its fangsinto you I clutched the creature inboth hands and hurling him onto thefloor of the coach I stamped on himwith my heavy boots ne had drawn apistol from the front of his soutane but Ikicked it out of his hand and again I fellwith my knees on his chest Then forthe first time he screamed horriblywhile I half blinded felt about for thesword which he had so cunningly concealed My hand had just lighted uponit and I was dashing the blood frommy face to see where he lay that Imight transfix him when the wholecoach turned over upon its side andmy weapon was jerked out of my graspby the shock Before I could recovermyself the door was bjjrst open and Iwas dragged by the heels on to the roadCHAPTRE ELBut even as I was torn out onto theflint stones and realized that thirtyruffians were standing around me Iwas filled with joy for my pelisse hadbeen pulled over my head in the struggle and was covering one 6f my eyes andit was with my wounded eye that I wasseeing this band of brigands You seefor yourself by this pucker and scarhow the thin blade passed betweensocket and ball but it was only at thatmoment when I was dragged from thecoach that I understood that my sightwas not gone forever The creaturesintention doubtless was to drive itthrough my brain and indeed heloosened some portion of the innerbone of my head so that I afterwardshad more trouble from that woundthan from any one of the seventeenwhich I have receivedThey dragged me out these sons ofdogs with curses and execrations beating me with their fists and kicking meas I lay upon the ground I had frequently observed that the mountaineerswore cloth swathed round their feetbut never did I imagine that I shouldhave so much cause to bo thankful forit Presently seeing the blood uponmy head and that I lay quiet theythought that I was unconscious whereas I was storing every ugly face amongthem in my memory so that I mightsee them all safely hanged if ever mychance came around Brawny rascalsthey were with yellow handkerchiefsround their heads and great red sashesstuffed with weapons They had rolledtwo great rocks across the path whereit took a short turn and it was thesewhich had torn off one of the wheels ofthe coach and upset us As to the reptile who had acted the priest so cleverly and had told me so much of hisparish and his mother he of course hadknown where the ambuscade was laidand had attempted to put lne beyondall resistance at the moment when wereached itI cannot tell you how frantic theirrage was when they drew him out ofthe coach and saw the state to which Ihad reduced him If he had not got allhis deserts he had at least somethingas a souvenir of his meeting withEtienne Gerard for life legs dangledaimlessly about and though the upperpart of his body was convulsed withrage and pain he sat straight downupon his feet when they tried to sethim upright But all the time his twolittle black eyes which had seemed sokindly and so innocent in the coachwere glaring at me like a wounded catand he spat and spat and spat in my direction MjT faith when the wretchesjerked me onto my feet again and whenI was dragged off up one of the mountainpaths I understood that a time wascoming when I was to need all mycourage and resource My enemy wascarried upon the shoulders of the menbehind me and I could hear his hissingand reviling first in one ear and theninthe other as I was hurried up the winding trackTO BE CONTINUED 1What Ho WishedFather was speaking of you yesterday said Ethel to Cholly StalateWhat did he sayHe said hed rather have you gchome late than earlyEr why did he really say

and the heifer will be what her antecedents and your care make her It istoo late to look after the antecedents ofthe calves already born but not too lateto keep them in a growing- conditionand growing into what they ought tobe If designed for beef says a writerin New York Produce Review feedfreely with corn if designed for thedairy oats are a most excellent foodThey will not be so fat as they wouldif fed on corn but fatness is not what isdesired in -a dairy animal On the contrary it ds something to steer clearof If you teach the heifer to fattenshe will not depart from the habit whenshe is a cow If you want her to excelat the pail give her food that is richin muscle making elements rather thana fattening food Skim milk is eroodfor a dairy heifer up to several monthsof age and when she is weaned frommilk oats will serve an excellent purpose In truth oats should be fed before the diet of skim milk is withdrawnIt is far irom impossible to ruin a heiferso far as milk production goes by feeding too much rich food and it is possible to hurt her seriously bjr withholding a sufiicienc3r of food Of the twoevils too much food is worse than toolittle but it is less liable to occur forwhere one is injured by too much foodprobably 100 are injured by too littleand it is a safe guess to make that atleast half of the heifer calves are fedtoo much like steers for them ever tomake the best kind of cows Choosecorn and timothy hay for the steeisand oats and clover Ivay for the heifersIn feeding hay early cut hay for heifersand later cut for steers is in the rightlineSCOURING IN CALVESOnly About Ten Per Cent of ThoseAttacked Are SavedScouring in calves gives trouble onall and sometimes causes very seriousloss on some farms It is an infectiousdysentery in young animals and frequently less than ten per cent of thoseattacked are saved The more generaltrouble is known as white scours orand most farmers have aprivate remedy for it A great thing isto prevent scour if possible by the careful changing of food and attention todiet generally On looking through thecow houses on a large Danish dairyfarm recently I noticed that in thetroughs in the calf pens there werealways two lumps for the animals tolick One was the customary piece ofrock salt and the other a piece of chalk1 an inquiry the learned professorwho had the farm under his directionreplied that it was to keep the calvesfrom becoming sour in the stomachHe added that rock salt and chalk wereeasily accessible and the calves werenever or rarely troubled with the complaint which is so prevalent on American farms In all probability it maybe an old fashioned precaution knownto many people as prepared chalk isa constituent of some remedies fordiarrhea and scouring but it is notgenerally followed It is easy of trialand those who put it to a test would dowell to relate their experience favorable or otherwise as the case may befor the benefit of others HomesteadIMPROVED MILK CANIt Will Not Spill ItM Contents

growingand has a great amount of healing property stored up in it to cover the woundswhere limbs are broken or cut off Myrule for pruning trees is to cut off thebranches nearly straight across just beyond this enlargement By so doing thewounds will not be half as large as whencut close to the trees and they will healmuch quicker Trees trimmed in thisway do not look as neat as when thebranches are cut off close but I considerit safer and better I have known ofyoung apple trees being killed by pruning close to the main stem where threeONE METHOD OF PRUNINGUpper part small branch properly prunedLower wound one inch in diameterhealed in one seasonor four limbs grew out close togetherThe trees were nearly girdled and thehot sun dried up what little live barkwas left between the cuts I havehad excellent success trimming iuMarch It is not advisable to pruneduring the spring flow of sap I consider June the best month I cut offlimbs one -inch in diameter las springwhich healed entirely over during summer A practical way for anjone to decide this matter is to take two trees ofthe same size trim one as I have directd and the other by cutting thebranches close to the trunk of the treeand watch results During the past 403rears I have planted and cared forthousands of fruit forest and evergreentrees successfully Ihave 17 acres of forest trees of my own plantinggrowingonmy farm

getsgnawed off either by mice or rabbitsif taken in time before the bark getstoo dry they may be saved When thebark is not cut off completely aroundthe tree one of the best ways cf savingit is to take rather dry cow manuremix with it an eiual quantity of loamysoil wet up to the consistency of thickpaste and spread it entirely over thewound covering and tying on with acloth and leaving it on until it rots offIf the wound extends clear aroundthe tree so that sap circulation is entirely cut off three or four scions canbe inserted taking care to sec that theinner bark of the scion and tree fitclosely together Use grafting wax tohold in place and then wrap with acloth band A little care in this waywill often save a tree that would otherwise be lost It will be found a goodplan to go through the orchard occasionally even though protection nasbeen given and if any trees have beeninjured care for them at onceWinter is a good timeto graft one-year old stocks The work canbe doneindoors if the scions have been cut ingood season and properly stored Ingrafting care must be taken to keepvarieties separate tying each up ineparate bundles and marking themIn grafting one-year-old stockthe top-should be off below the lowest budMake a smooth slanting cut and thencut the scion to fit it Have graftingwax spread upon muslin or some kindof thin cloth cut in narrow stripsWrap it two or three times round andtie with woolen twine This is to holdit in place until a start to grow is madeThis is the simplest iorm of graftingAnother way is to cut the scion wedgeshaped
