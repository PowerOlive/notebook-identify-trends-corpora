A FUNNY INCIDENT i PORTUGUESE PIRATE
A FRAGMENT OF HISTORY THAT 13 H0W BARTHOLEMY CAPTURED A
FULL OF HUMOR
HUGE SPANISH MERCHANTMAN
il Ia First Attack Failed The Little Pirato
Then Lay Within Short Rangerand With
Rifles the Spanish Force Was Reduced
and Finally Conquered
A series of sketches by Flank R
Stockton on The Buccaneers of Oui
Coast is one of the features of St
Nicholas Mr Stockton tells of the adl
porter had gone to the Logan residence ventures of Bartholemy Portuguez
to interview the general about some
matter then before congress The gen
eral was in bed and the reporter was
shown to his room In the course of the
evening Mrs Logan entered the bed
chamber and took part in the conversa
tion In her hand she held a letter the
contents of which her husband knew
about She wanted to give it to the re
porter but the general objected But
as the newspaper man started to leave
wno witn a small crew in a small ves
sel captured a huge Spanish merchant
man in the Caribbean sea Mr Stockton
says The little pirate sailed boldly to
ward the big Spaniard and the latter
vessel utterly astonished at the audac
ity of this attack for the pirates flag
was flying lay to head to the wind
and waited the gunners standing by
their cannon When the pirates had
come near enough to see and understand
Mrs Logan slipped the envelope into tne size and power of the vessel they
his hand The next morning nearly naa tnougfit of attacking they did not
every newspaper in the country printed as might have been expected put about
a copy ot it it was a rare ana racy
document
Colonel Alexander G Horn of Meridi
an Miss then the editor of The Daily
Mercury was its author The letter
was intended as an explanation of an
editorial that had appeared a few weeks
before in The Mercury Colonel Horn
and J J Shannon were associates in
the publication of the aforesaid journal
On the morning following the death of
and sail away at the best of their ves
sels speed but they kept straight on
their course as if they were about to
fall upon a great unwieldy merchant
man manned by common sailors
Perceiving the foolhardiness of the
little vessel the Spanish commander
determined to give it a lesson which
would teach its captain to understand
better the relative power of great ves
sels and little ones so as soon as tbe
the hero of Appomattox The Mercury Plates vessel was near enough he or-
contained one of the most cruel articles dered a broadside fired upon it The
about General Grant ever printed by a Spanish ship had a great many people
press k dared any true southerner to on board It had a crew of 70 men and
grieve or show signs of sorrow over his besides these there were some
ftemisfi It called nnon the oeoDle of 8ers and regular marines and know-
Dixie land to exult and rejoice at the
death of the man who had slain their
sons and burned their homes The peo
ple of Meridian were astounded They
went to the editor Colonel Horn and
asked him in the name of peace to
write another article withdrawing it
He was obdurate and instead of doing
as his neighbors wished dictated anoth
er one equally as fierce as the first
At that moment the name of Colonel
Shannon wes before the senate awaiting
confirmation as postmaster at Meridian
An enemy of his knowing the love that
General Logan had for General Grant
inclosed copies of the paper to him ex
pecting ihat Logan would oppose Shan
nons nomination Shannon and Horn
had a dispute over the editorial and
their relations became so strained that
a street duel was only averted by the
interference of mutual friends Colonel
Horns letter to General Logan was to
the effect that Colonel Shannon was in
nocent of the article and had known
nothing about it until he saw it in the
paper I cannot quote the letter with
literal exactness but a part of it was as
follows
No Shannon had nothing to do
with it In the first place he hasnt
sense enough to conceive such a senti
ment as was expressed in the editorial
and if he had he would be too cowardly
to write it He is my partner I am sor
ry to say but by making him postmaster
you will afford me the opportunity of
getting rid of him
And why not take him John There
is a mighty narrow strip between the
radical republicanism that you repre
sent and the Cleveland Mugwumpery
that Shannon tries to represent He is
not a Democrat never was and never
will be I predict that you will soon
have him over on your side and God
speed the dy TVe Democrats down
here dont want him
I am growing old but I am still in
possession of my mental faculties and
I hope to live many years longer to tell
the truth from day to day about the
despised Yankees and their politics I
am seriously afflicted with hemiplegia
else I would have mauled h 1 out of
ing that the captain had determined to
fire upon the approaching vessel every
body had gathered on deck to see the
little pirate ship go down
But the ten great cannon balls which
were shot out at Bartholemy s little
craft all missed their aim and before the
guns could be reloaded or the great ship
be got around so as to deliver her other
broadside the pirate vessel was along
side of her Bartholemy had fired none
of his cannon Such guns were useless
against so huge a foe What he was aft
er was a hand to hand combat on the
deck of the Spanish ship
The pirates were all ready for hot
work They had thrown aside their
coats and shirts as if each of them were
going into a prizefight and with their
cutlasses in their hnds and their
tols and knives in their belts tney
scrambled like monkeys up tbe sides of
the great ship But Spaniards are brave
men and good fighters there were more
than twice as many of them as there
were of tbe pirates and it was not
long before the latter found out that
they could not capture that vessel by
I boarding it So over the side they turn- j
bled as fast as they could go leaving j
some of their number dead and wounded
behind them They jumped into their
own vessel and then they put off to a
short distance to take breath and get
1 ready for a different kind of fight The
triumphant Spaniards now prepared to
get rid of this boatload of half naked
wild beasts which they could easily do
if they took better aim with their can
non than they had done before
But to their amazement they soon
1 found that they could do nothing with
the guns nor were they able to work
i their ship so as to get it into position
i for effectual shots Bartholemy and his
men laid aside their cutlasses and their
1 pistols and took up muskets with which
they were well provided Their vessel
lay within very short range of tbe Span
ish ship and whenever a man could be
seen through the portholes or showed
himself in the rigging or anywhere else
where it was necessary to go in order
to work the ship he made himself a tar- j
get for the good aim of the pirates The
pirate vessel cculd move about as it
leased for it required but a few men
Logan you ought to remember me
as one of the fellows that figured some
what conspicuously in the Kemper
county txials I guess I can take the
credit to myself of having had the Dem
ocrats who killed the Radicals there
acquitted before the courts I would
like another job of the sarue kind
You and I ought to be friends Op
popites leget liking You have been a
broth of a boy in your party and I have
ben a sheol of a fellow in mine
General Logan replied good natured
ly to this epistle after which a friend
ly correspondence sprang up between
the erratic genius at Meridian and tne
senator Logan read the Shannon letter
in the committee room of the senate
and then laughingly said that inasmuch
as his friend Colonel Horn wanted
Shannon confirmed he didnt see how
he could oppose him Colonel Horn
unreconstructed has long since passed
into silence and a few years later Colo
nel Shannon was buried at his old
home in Paulding Miss a town once
to manaee it and so it kept out of
the way cf tbe Spanish guns and its
best marksmen crouching close to the
deck fired and fired whenever a Span
ish head was to be seen
For five long hours this unequal con
test was kept up It might have re
minded one of a man with a slender rod
and a long delicate line who bad
hooked a big salmon The man could
not pull in the salmon but on the other
hand the salmon could not hurt the
man and in the course of time the big
fish would be tired out and tbe man
would get out his landing net and scoop
him in
Now Bartholemy thought he could
scoop in the Spanish vesseL So many
of ber men bad been shot that the two
crews would be more nearly equal So
he boldly ran his vessel alongside the
big ship and again boarded her Then
there was another great fight on the
decks The Spaniards bad ceased to be
triumphant but they had become des-
made famous by the publication of The and in the fnrj comSatf
Weekly Clarion many years ago of
which paper he was one of the founders
During the Sullivan Kilrain trial at
Purvis some years ago I sat at the break
fast table with Sullivan and Colonel
Shannon Sullivan ate three fried chick
ens Shannon four Charlie Rich the
great sportsman got the two to enter a
fried chicken eating match Some one
asked Sullivan how many he thought
be could get away with and Sullivan
said about eight
ui iiiv mates wwo lhu
wounded But the Spaniards fared
worse than that More than half of the
men who had not been shot by the pi
rates went down before their cutlasses
and pistols and it was not long before
Bartholemy had captured the great
Spanish ship
It was a fearful and a costly victory
he had gained A great part of his own
men were lying dead or h pless on the
deck and of the ie uuly 40 were

SELLING BY SIGN ALT
MOW CATTLE ARE DEALT It AT THE
CHICAGO STOCKYARDS
BiUirtg fa Their Saddles With the Lot
Between Them Heller and Barer Con
elnde s Transaction by Raising Their
Whips On Their Heads
The Chicago stockyards are unique
among the great marts of the world In
no other place say those who are most
familiar with fit daily routine is so
large an aggregate of business transact
ed in the language of gestures and with
eat the serateh of anennin h
noisy pent of the stockyards A whip
is held high in air across a sea of I
tering horns the signal is answered by It
the momentary uplifting of a hand and i
bunch Of Cattle worth thmiBDnda nt
dollars is sold
There is something splendidly pic
turesque and even spectacular in these
wordless transactions They ignore the
artificialities of tbe complex system up
on which modern business relationships
are almost universally maintained
Trade in the cattle pens gets boldly
back to primitive simplicity It is done
on honor not on paper And tbe undis
puted transfer of millions of dollars
worth of the property here dealt in
proves that a bargain sealed with the
wave of the whip and an assenting ges
ture of the hand is quite as safe and sa
cred as if the whole transaction were
recorded in black and white
The trader in the wheat pit is armed
with his tally card upon which he
pauses to note the names of those with
whom he deals and the amount nature
and price of the commodities bought
and sold The broker upon the floor of
the Stock Exchange places equal reli
ance upon the quickly penciled memo
randa made at the moment when the
details of each transaction were upon
the lips of those concerned in its fulfill
ment but the buyer and seller of the
yards carry whips not pencils and
their deals are recorded in memory in
stead of written upon trading cards As
well try to picture tbe old knights mak
ing laborious written memoranda of
their challenges as to think of the rough
and ready traders of the cattle yards
pausing in their saddles to jot down
upon paper their purchases and sales
Such a procedure would bid defiance to
the very nature of things and do vio
lence to the magnificent unconvention
ally of every environment
Is there never any trouble in this
kind of dealing a leading commission
man was aslid
If you mean do the men goback on
their bargains made by whip and hand
I can answer never was the traders
answer as he brought his trim black
horse to a halt in the cattle alley and
leaned forward in his saddle There
isnt another place in America or the
whole world for that matter where so
much business is done on the basis of
personal integrity without a written
word to show for the transactions as
right here he continued and the
method beats all the bonds on earth
The days business in these pens will
run about 1500000 And how is it
done Little talk a considerable wav
ing of whips and hands and no exchange
of written documents betwaen buyers
and sellers
Here is a bunch of cattle that will
figure up about 10000 Over there in
the other alley is a buyer who this
morning offered me a price of f 5 10 for
them I thought that I could do better
but the market has been a little off and
I have decided to let the bunch go at
his offer Up to the present moment
we have exchanged about a dozen words
on this subject Now if be is willing to
pay the price which he named in the
morning Ill 6how you how a 10000
bunch of fat steers is sold without
word of mouth or a scratch of writing
at the time the bargain is really made
The commission man then straighten
ed up in the saddle and waited for the
distant buyer to look in his direction
A moment later this representative of
a big packing house wheeled his horse
about and faced in the direction of the
seller Instantly the commission man
lifted high his rawhide riding whip
and held it aloft His attitude was as
striking as that of a cavalry colonel up
lifting his saber to concentrate the at
tention of his regiment before making
a desperate charge The pose however
was full of natural grace and freedom
and showed that the man was more at
ease in the saddle than he could have
been out of it
Only a moment elapsed before the
alert eye of the buyer caught sight of
the upraised whip The next instant he
raised his hand a little above his head
held it motionless a moment and then
dropped it with a forward movement
Quickly the seller repeated the motion
of assent with his whip and then turn
ing to his caller said
Thats all there is to it To a stran
ger this kind of a performance looks
like a long range sign talk between deaf
mutes but we understand each other
perfectly We both know how many
cattle there are in the bunch and the
price at which they have been sold
Had we been within speaking distance
of each other the transaction would
1 probably have been a verbal one just
for the saki of sociability but not be
cause it would have mae the bargain
better understood or any more binding

A Coin In the Bottle
There have been patented all kinds of
schemes devised for the purpose of se
curing a bottle that cannot be refilled
after having once been emptied of its
contents A great deal of fraud is said
to be perpetrated by tilling the bottles
of some standard liqnor wirh an inferior
grade and palming it olf as the original
oottllng An ingenious Philadelhian
to accomplish this by blowing
a coin in the body of the glass bottle
and he thinks that this will be tempt
ing enough to induce some one to break
the bottle as soon as it has jeen emptied
