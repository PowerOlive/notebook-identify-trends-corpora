inWashington and is called fey thewhites Indian commissioner sendsword to the White Father that in thenext 25 years there wont be a redman in existence It will be the faultof the white man if Paleface Jonesguess comes true But the palefaceslong before Mr Jones said the samething My grandfather who was aWyandotte returned to wigwams ofhis tribe many moons ago and toldthe bucks and braves to prepare forthe Kappy Hunting Grounds He hadbeen for a visit to the palefaces inNew England and had heard one ofthem named Sprague of llhode Island sav that the red man was atthat time standing in the face of thesetting sun and that his last warwhoop had been heard My grandfather had been to Boston and theyfed him on beans and when he wentback to the wig warns he had lost hisnenre He never went on the warpathafter that He got up ghost dancesand had a lodge of sorrow composedof old broken down squaws and soonafter he rested from his pow wowsThe young bucks kept on doingbusiness Our tribe increased untilthe Great Spirit counted us by thenumber of leaves that fell from thebranches in the Moon of SnowshoesWord came to us by the deer fromevery tepee that other tribes were increasing Then the palefaces cameamong us and taught us their wayof many things and made us to drinkIn spite of it all we managed to maketrouble when they wanted our trailsand the places where we had joinedour voices with the thunder of thewest wind in the worship of the GreatSpiritWhen the ancestors of my paWacabrother William A Jones had laidout reservations for otir people andherded us as we herded the ganve otthe forests we still loved one anotherand we gathered about our shacks inthe long winter days afraid to go outafler dark on account of the warriorswhich our White Father had seat towatch us Then our ancestors ohJones gave us the white mans Bibleand told us that we must be bornagain They put a new song In ourmouths and told us about a GreatSpirit of whom neither the WestWind nor the Moon of Bright Nightsnor Leaves nor Strawberries nor ofFalling Leaves had told is anythingThey buried our departed out of oursight and when our squaws and pappooses moaned for red squirrel andwild rice and groue and bison andvenison they were fed upon the oxenslain at the beef issue oxen that thewhite man had worked and turned outto dieAnd you built sehoolhouses andtaught our children a new languageThey came back to us with new wordsin their mouths and new namessometimes so that when we talked tothem as we did when they were beinglulled to sleep in the wigwams theylooked at us and shook their headsAnd then you taught our squaws tostay in the tepee all day and ourbraves and bucks had to quit the huntand plant maizeOne day a paleface came to ourtepee with a thing called a bicycleand vou tried to teach us to sell youour ponies for that You taught ourboys the game of football Andnow you come and tell us we ardying and that in 25 years weonly be known by the names whichyou have taken from us and forwhich you call lakes and rivers andthe trails of your towns and citiesI hope my paleface brother Jonesis wrong in his guess Let us aloneLet its go back to the track of thebison and in the depths of forestwhich have not vet been broken andlet us find the great Great Spirit ofour Fathers And so shall we againoutnumber the leaves of the branchesand somebody will come to our callwhen we get strong and we will fightyour battles for you and be worthyof you and of the White Father andof our people and their traditionsWichita Jim in N Y SunWood Pulp for PoulticesWood pulp has been put to a varietyof uses in recent years but to nonemore interesting than poultices andsurgical dressings When maceratedin water it swells and absorbs fromfour to five times its weight of liquidretaining it for a long time As thepulp becomes soft a poultice of anydesired consistency can be made byvarying the quantity of the water Byusing hot water the resulting poulticewill retain its heat and moisture muchlonger than a similar poultice madeof bread or flaxseed Antiseptic drugssoluble in water may be dissolved inthe water in which the pulp is to besoaked as the pulp itself is unaffectedby most drugs When dry the pulpwill absorb both oils and fats This inparticularly valuable as It can be usedas an emollient and antiseptic substitute for salves etc on lint as a surgical dressing Wood pulp can bemolded when moist so that it can benA as a splint owing to the factthat it dries very hard When keptslightly wet with an antiseptic solution the pulp remains soft and can beused as an absorbent

Although dollars innumerable and greatstudy have been devoted to securingsome method of successfully combating this disease and although theworid is startled now and again withthe announcement that a great discoery has been made along these linesyet only palliative measures have thusfar been found effective in any degreeIt is known that milk from cowswhose udders are affected bj tuberculosis is liable to cause a transmission ofthe disease to persons especially toyoung children the bacillus producingthis disease in cattle and consumptionamong people being identical It isnow interesting and important to knowthat foreign investigations have demonstrated that tuberculosis germs aroften found in butter and that theywill there live for a considerable periodof time The only way it is statedto feel sure of the butter and milk ycuare consuming is to know that the milkand the cream from which the butter ismade is pasteurized and the germskilled It is not now generally believedthat consumption oi tuberculosis canbe directly inherited it is acquired bythe offspring rather from close contactwith the mother At the Wisconsin station some of the best animals werefound to be diseased They were separated from the others and calves bredfrom them but the offsprings were immediately removed from the mothersand fed on the milk of other cattleThey have proved perfectly healthyThe milk of diseased cattle has alsobeen successfully used for feeding purposes after having been thoroughlypasteurized Farmers ReviewImitation llntter in CnbaAmerican butter sells for less indie Cuban market than butter fromJTrance Holland and Denmark AndVet American butter is generally better than that coming from the othercountries The trouble is that oleomargarine and other imitations aresold in Cuba as American butter Itis precisely the same dishonest methods which have so greatly injured theAmerican butter trade in EuropeWhen our government stops thisfraudulent trade American butter andcheese will sell again in the marketsof the world at prices as high as similar articles from other countriesThis dishonest practice on the part ofexporters not only disgraces theUnited States but it takes millions ofdollars annually out of the farmerspockets by depreciating the value oftheir products Philadelphia PressAbout Continuous MilkingA writer in the Jersey Bulletin sayshe or she has but one cow in a herdof 20 that has ever gone dry morethan a month at a time before calvingThat cow was brought into the herdand was dry three months before shedropped another calf With her nextcalf she went dry about six weeks anddoes so now Most of the herd havenever been dry at all since thej badthe first calf Although the milk isnot used in the dairy for a month before they calve they are milked regularly and no difference can be seenbetween the well fed cow that doesnot go dry at all and other cows thaigo dry one or two months so far ashealth vigor or lasting qualities goIt is largely a matter of habit and3Vi Ts ip nllnnn1 erf i1n TnfTfirst calf ske is more apt to go drjlittle longer the next timeIMPROVED HIGHWAYFacts Showing the Economy of HardStone Roails for Both Farmerand Business ManThe principle of the good roadsmovement as advocated by theLeague of American Wheel nun isthat the common roads of tlu country are as important as the railwaysystems the statement being made bytjicm and being easily understoodthat there is not an ounce of any commodity hauled over the railroads thatis not first transported by wagonsover country roads or city streets Itdoes not matter if the commodity ismanufactured articles that are loadedon cars at the factory The raw material has first to be hauled to the factory But the greatest hauling isdone in the farming districts andthere it is that good highways aremost neededThe subject has not been given theattention and support it deserves asyet for the simple reason that privatecapital cannot become interested inthe building of common roads sincethere would be no income from the investment such as there is in railways Municipal comity state andthe national governments have nothad the issue brought directly beforethem in its full significance becauseit is necessary to first educate thepeople to the necessities oi the movement This is what is being done bythe wheelmen at the present time andit must be said to their credit thatthey have enlisted the sympathy andsupport of all the prominent farnorganizations in the movement Withthe two classes working together it iaonly a question of time until themovement will be made a political issue and then will come the desiredimprovement-The argument offered in favor ofthe improved roads is that they lessen the cost of repairs make it possible to haul the largest amount ofgoods with the smallest animal powersave time and increase property valuations No railroad company would expect to do business if its tracks androadbed were in such condition as tomake it either impossible to use thetracks at long seasons of the year arin using them have to lose a great dealof time and have immense repairs tomake ond yet that is what the farmers and others using the commonroads are doing in a comparative wayevery dvy in the yearThey make the mon impracticableattempts at road building and repairing and then wonder why there is noprofit in their products which havebeen hauled over bad roads at thogreatest expense It has been estimated 1hat in the states where thestone roads have been built the cosiof Transportation has been decreasedto 20 per cent of the former figuiresand that the roads pay for themselveswithin a few years It has been further shown that the amount lost inthe different ways mentioned willmore than pay for the building andrepairs of these roads on the annualassessments made for them or that itcosts no more each year to have goodroads than it does to have bad onesFOR CARRYING BOXESContrivance That Permits Two Persons to Pick Ip a Heavy Box andWalk

operations with the samekeen eye that the merchant uses infollowing up every venture to its closelt is impossible to do this thoroughlywithout keeping books in which arerecorded the items of expense both oftime and money involved in the production of every fsrm product Itneeds some care acd attention to dothis and many farmers hate to bringthemselves to such work but it is precisely this kind of care and attentionwhich distinguishes the successfulfrom the unsuccessful men in everykind of business arm JournalHalter to Fit Any HorseTake a rope of convenient length apdthickness and make a small loop at oneof its ends and another small loop aboutfour inches away from it The halter iscompleted by passing the end of therope through the iirst loop and thenthrough the second loop As thishalter runs through both loeps it willfit a head of any se Its special disadvantage is that it requires to be keptconstantly tight in order for it to retainits position This Gbjection can be obviated for any particular horse bymaking a knot at each of the smallloops aftff determining the respective lengths of the head piece and thenose band London Live Stock JournalJOHN B CASTLEMAffARThCR O LANGIiAMas

brotherWILLIAMIIChicago 111 Dec 26 Dear BrotherThe secret is out I suspected it all thetime It is needless for you to offer denialSometimes when ou have acted the cynicI have almost believed that you were sincere until I have obs in you something which told me that underneath yourassumed indifference there was a genialcurrent of the romantic sentiment cf theyouth and the lover How can I be indoubt after receiving your little book alove storyI knew Sidney dear that you would remember me at Christmas You have always been the soul of thoughtf ness especially to those of us who understood youI must confess however that I expectedyou to do the deadly conventional thingand send me something heavy and seriousI knew it would be a book All of myfriends send me books That comes ofbeing president of a literary club Butyou are the only one Sidrt y who had therare and kindly judgment to appeal to thewoman and not to the club president Because I am interested in a serious literarymovement it need not follow that I wantmy whole life to be overshadowed by thegiants of the literary kingdom AlthoughI would not dare confess it to Mrs Peabodyor Mrs Hutchens there are times whenI like to spend an afternoon with an oldfashioned love storyYou are a bachelor Sidney and I havelong since ceased to flush at the casualmention of old maid It was not for usto know the bitter sweet experiences ofcourtship and marriage and you will remember that we have sometimes pitied th6infatuation of sweethearts and have felti rather superior in our freedom And yetSidney if o chose to be perfectly candidwith each other I dare say that both ofus would confess tb having known something about that which men call loveWe might confess that we had felt itssubtle influence We might even admitthat sometimes we pause in our lonelylives and wonder what might have beenand whether it would not have been betterafter all I am afraid that I am writinglke a sentimental schoolgirl but you mustknow that I have be n reading your charming little book and it has come to me as amessage from you Is It not really a confession Sidney1 1 Vs TrFOUND HIMSELF AT THE BOOK COUNTERpointing- to some gayly colored
