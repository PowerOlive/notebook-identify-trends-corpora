The two members areJack Scheneberg and "Fop" Barnett,the former the must succepsful hurlerin the league and the other the bestinitial sacker of any around the circuit. A few years before they brokeinto organized base ball both payed onan independent team in Huntington.Schenbeerg held down the third sackand Barnett did the hurling for theclub which played only one game aweek. The present Bourbonite hurlerstarred at third and Barnett pitchedwinning ball for the club.besides managing the affairs of the amateur aggregation. All went well until one afternoon they met a rival club in a heatedcontest. From thelfirst Barnett pitched winning ball and Scheneberg cantered around third in an admirablefashion. Then the umps took a handand as Barnett floated strike afterstrike over the plate the umpire sawthem differently. Finally Barnettgave up in disgust and withdrew fromthe game. His teammates endeavoredto persuade him to continue in thebox, but without result. A shift wasmade in the infield and Barnett consented to play he first sack, whileScheneberg pitched the remainder ofthe game. This was the beginning oftheir careers as pitcher and first baseman. They came to the Blue GrassLeague together first playing withLexington the first year the leaguewas in existence, Scheneberg drawingthe pink slip after a short stay with(the Colts and at the end of the seasonBarnett was drafted by Dayton, whereI he failed to make good and was signedby Paris, later managing the club.

What would it bewithout a clown?The circus clown dates his originback to the beginning ot the circusitself, and from ;time .immemorial hehas been one of the most impotantfeaturres. During the growth anddevelopment he has by no means beenleft behind.

Cox thinks thatofficials of many of the mountaincounties have fallen into the habit ofwaiting for a reward to be offered before making an arrest and he condemns the practice. 'Governor Cox believes that where a crime has beencommitted it is the duty of the officersto make the arrest without waitingfor a reward to be foffered. This wascalled forth by an application fromme uuicew uj. jotfu uouniy ior a reward of $300 for the arrest of CalvinMiracle, who killed Matthew Jonesand Dulcie Gibson last Sunday. Theletter asking for the reward said thatthis was a cruel murder and the mancannot be arrested for less than $500as he is desperate and it is worth aman's life to attempt to make thearrest. The letter indicates, savn ftnv.Cox that the officers of Bell county arewilling to risk their lives for $500 butwill not do so without a cash consideration. Gov. Cox does not think the officersshould have a money conisderation fordoing their duty and he did not offerthe reward requpsted. The county hasoffered a reward of $200 and theywanted the State to add S30O. Tnmany of the mountain counties wherecrime is committed, similar requestsfor rewards are made in a abort timeatfer the offense and it is said to be acommon practice for the officers towait until a reward is offered before. cuiitiug iu xuh&v au arrets. iWEDNESDAY.Paris . . 35 18 660Lexi'g'n 30 23 566M'ysVe 26 28 481No game wasParis club Wednesday.j-iexington nroKe evenFr'nkf't 25 29 463Richro 'd 23 29 442Win'ster 21 32 396scheduled for theMaysville andin a doubleheader, Maysville winning the first bya score of 12 to 0 and Lexington thesecond 6 to 3.Ihe Bourbonites winning from theLawmakers yesterday afternoon andthe -loss of the game by Lexingtoncinched the pennant honors for Parisin the last half of the persent season.At present only five games remainto be played by the home club andLexington, Jand Paris with six fullgapnte in the lead, there is no chancewnatever for Lexington to overtaketheMcKernan tribe.

We also find himns hp accented suitor for the hand ofthe young and beautiful daughter of.ludce Andrews, a man in the pay ofthe notorious night rider gang, whichis determined to control the output ofthe entire tobacco crop.According to their standard olmorals it is deemed expedient to bribethe young candidate so that if he succeeded in being elected he would become another tool for the night ridermachine. This is attempted with anoffer of fifty thousand dollars in cashand the hand of the Judge's daughter,young Steven's sweetheart, otherwiseher father's failure to sanction themarriaee and his financial ruin istheatrened as the price of his disobedience to the dictates of corruptnartv nolitics.The story of how he marries the girlof his choice in spite of opposition, resists bribery, and triumphs ultimatelyover the night riders makes thecharacter of Stevens one of the mostinteresting and insmnne seen onthe American stage in the past decade.Prices 25 cents to 75' cents.

HKKS&'lBOWER 0F-HUMAN EYEMAY' BE GREAT AS COMPOUNDLENSES OF THE FLY.Each of the Latter Reflects but a- Small Part of the ImageLooked At.A specialist has claimed that he canwith the unaided eye distinguish linesruled in glass that are only one fiftythousandth of an inch apart, but LeConte has limited the power of theeye to distinguish lines to one onethousandth of an inch.To show how immensely superior isthe sense of sight in defining singlethings one can try the sense of touchin comparison with it. The two pointsof a pair of compasses placed threeinches apart on the least sensitiveparts of the body will bo felt as asingle prick.With the aid of the microscope thehuman eye can discern objects whosediameter is only about one one-hun-dred-and-eight-thousandthof an inch.It has been said that the eye of a flycan distinguish an object one fivemillionth of an inch in diameter.What we designate as the eye of afly is really a compound eye made upof numerous lenses. Of these the common house fly has something like fourthousand in the two eyes. The structures of these lenses are well known,the optical part of each consisting oftwo lenses, which combined, form adouble convex lens.That each lens acts as a separateeye can be easily .proved by detachingthe whole of the front of the compound eye, and by manipulation witha microscope it is not difficult to examine a photograph of other objectthrough it. When this is done a distinct image is seen in each lens.Carpenter has shown that each lensreflects but a small portion of theimage looked at and that it requiresthe combined action of the 4,000lenses of the fly tp produce the sameeffect as that seen by the one humaneye. The human eye Is therefore amore perfect optical instrument thanthe eye of the fly.Scientists who have given considerable attention to the investigation ofcompound eyes have formed no opinion that would lead to the conclusionthat their power of vision with respect to small objects exceeds that ofthe simple eyes of the higher animalsThe images of objects formed in theseparate lenses composing ' the compound eye are proportionately small,and the question whether insects cansee smaller objects than animals furnished with single eyes is not a question of optics, but of the sensitivenessof the optic nerve and consequently amatter of mere con)ecture. Harper'sWeekly.Decline of the Dachshund.Many of the species of hounds sopopular today are survivors of thetime most hunting dogs were taughtto "hound" game. Then dogs selected by reason of their superior speedand powers of endurance were chosento accompany the hunting partiesHounds were divided into two classesthose qualified to follow the gameby scent and those capable of sighting the quarry a long distance away.All, however, were expected to unitein the running down of the quarry.And so it happens that, in the Teutonic languages, the name of "hound,"or "hund," as the Germans have it,was originally used to designate allspecies of dogs, but came in time tobe applied to hunting dogs only. Inlater times there came a differentiation with respect to grayhounds, rabbit hounds, bloodhounds, deerhounds,etc.An interesting case in point is thatof the German dachshund, whichmeans "badger hound." The firstdogs of this species were employed inthe drawing of badgers.The breed is how too degeneratefor tracking such game.

You notice itby the fact that the child is constipated, it belches, is peevish and cries.Don't give a remedy that contains anopiate, because the child will get inthe habit of needing it, and don't become alarmed and run at once for adoctor.Try a scientific laxative first.
