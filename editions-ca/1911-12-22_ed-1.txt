In fact each land has its ownpeculiar ways, and our people, beingdrawn originally from almost everyclime, have introduced into our celebration of the day a bit of the Christmas features brought from mothercountries. We have the Dutch SantaClaus, the German Christmas tree, theEnglish plum pudding and carols andour own peculiarly lavish gift making. The boys and girls of far distantcountries are spending the day in suchdifferent ways that It may prove of interest to young and old to hear something of the distinctive Christmas customs. HE English Christmas is notunlike our$, save that we donot have their pretty custom of "bringing inthe yule." In almost every family in England the boysand girls gather about the burninglog on Christmas eve to sing carolsand tell Christmas legends. Often thechildren who live in the country assist at the dragging in of the hugelog.An English child would not feel itwas Christmas if there was not a bitof mistletoe hanging in the hall, underwhich the unwary are kissed soundly.Little and big eat the rich and blazingplum pudding, and all join in the singing of Christmas carols and churchgoing. StKjTHRI3TMAS in Holland is thegala day of the year for thechildren. They have a prettycustom of ushering it in. Just atmidnight on Christmas eve, the menand boys dressed in fancy costume,march through the streets in long procession, holding aloft a brilliantlylighted star, as they chant the "Gloriain Excelsis." The little girls clad inwhite stand at the windows and bowto the star as it passes.ERHAPS the finest Christmas of all, if not the mostlavish, is spent by the children of Germany. It combines tneChrist child wliich we Americans areprone to forget and Santa Claus.The whole day Is full of cheer; families feast ana go to church; presents are simple, but in every home isa blazing tree hung with cakes, colored candles and gifts. It is a prettysight to see the children march in to.see their tree, sinfrins: as they go. "O,Tannen Baum" (O, Fir Tree), to tne.air of "Maryland, My . Maryland."In many German towns just as thebells ring to usher in Christmas,every window in every house is quickly lighted. Then the children are upbright and early, even the tiny babie3,19 go to six o'clock church. Often eachcliild bears a candle to illuminate thec&urch.JThe German Kriss Kihgle has one,h I mmr r7&-&3y - ' ?IflggISSWaMte3miBaa rhyme ofhorrid habit that our jolly old St Nickwould scorn. He generally leaves inthe stockings a bunch of switches incase they should be needed before hisnext call.HE Servian children have astrange custom. On Christmas Eve the father of thej family goes to the wood and cuts aI straight young oak, which he dragsI into the room where the family awaitshim, saying as he does so: "Good evening and a merry Christmas!"Then the children shout back: "MayGod grant both to thee and mayst thouhave riches and honor."With this they shower their fatherwith corn and the tree is thrown onthe fire to burn until Christmas morning, when it is greeted with pistolshots.HE French children rarelyhave a tree. Sometimes theyhang up slippers to be filled,of stockings, and there Isinsteadgreat chanting of "Noel, Noel," theChristmas song.Like the Scandinavian children, little French boys and girls never forgetthe birds, but instead of placingsheaves of grain on long poles, theyare hung along the eaves of thehouses.HE children of Belgium onChristmas Eve are dressedin gay colors and form a procession, which marches through thestreets, led by an orchestra and singing carols. Each child holds aloft eitht r a Christchild in a manger or a crucifix. MUKIUAN mothers find one jday of Christmas merrymaking distracting enough fortheir children, how would they like tolive in Russia, where work is oftenouspended for a fortnight, while all thepeople keep holiday.Even the poorest peasant has a treeand it is harvest time for beggars, forno one will refuse him anything.In some of the country districts theboys dress as animals, and led by other boys as keepers, march through thef"jMiI?"-"?i0S-i-0tfrrCJ x . . 1scyycywcrc A'? - i i'mm. cifix.I tJ' I!

The Scandinavian child is verygood to the poor on Christmas andtake3 gifts and food to poor families.Bulgarian "Koleda."In Bulgaria "Koleda," as Christiansis called, is marked with many quaintceremonies. One is called "Koledars,"the name given to a band of boys,mostly, who so about nroclaiminE: thatthe season of fasting is over, and her-I aiding a reign of feasting and merrl-ment. Each Koleda party numbersseven the Old Man, the Old Woman,the Crumb Picker (who collects thepresents and money, while the OldMan and Old Woman play the fool),and Four Singers, who carol out theChristmas songs. The attire of theKoledars is most grotesque, and theirprocession is joined by a huge crowdof townspeople, who take a great delight in -the antics of the jesteis.Art of Punctuation.A man went into the Jewell County Monitor office and asked f theyoung apprentice what rules of punctuation he followed. The boy replied:"I set as long as I can hold my breathand then I put in a comma, when Igape I insert a semi-colon, and whenI want a chew of tobacco I make a paragraph."

Wich BankingLaws Credits Hereafter ExtendedWill be Done in Form of Loans."The article as it appeared in theHerald in full is as follows:"All the banks in Lexington, Nationaland State, at a meeting of the Lexington Clearing House Asociation yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, unanimously decided that on and after March1, 1912, no overdraft of any kind willbe allowed to be made by any customer and that the respective banksin granting credits shall require thesame to be in the form of direct loansand discounts."The meeting of the Clearing HouseAssociation was called at the requestof National Bank Examiner Percy H.Johnston. A circular from LawrenceO. Murry, Comptroller of the Currency, United States Treasury Department, on the subjects of overdrafts,was presented. In it attention is calledto the fact that the National Bank Actis silent on the subject of overdrafts,but the Supreme Court ot theUnited States had given an opinion in1 Peters, page 71. that an overdraftwhenever given by cashier, was at hisown peril and upon the responsibilityof himself and his sureties. The quotation is as follows:"A usage to allow customers to overdraw, and to have their checks andnotes changed up, without presentfunds in the bank stripped ot all technical disguise, the usage and practice,thus attempted to be sanctioned, is ausage and practice to misapply thefunds of the bank: and to connive atthe withdrawal of the same withoutany security, in favor of certain privileged persons. Such a usage and practice is surely a manifest departure fromthe duty, both of the directors andcashier, as can not receive any countenance in a court of justice. It couldnot bs supported by any vote of thedirectors, however formal; and, therefore, whenever done by the cashier, isat his own peril, and upon the responsibility of himself and his sureties. Itis anything but "well and truly executing his duties, as cashier.""From the statement in the circularit appears that for the last five years theaverage overdrafts in National Banksin the country was $35,000,000. Andin some states overdrafts are forbidden to state banks. In California it ismade a felony to permit an overdraft.In Kansas and Nor.h Dakota, the official allowing the overdraft is personallyliable to the bank for the amount paid.$200,000 IN LEXINGTON.Overdrafts have been a serious mat-From the statementspuDiisnect oy ins iNaiionai names ondemand of the Comptroller it is esti-1 mated that the ovei drafts have ordinarily run to over $200,000 a year."The following are the resolutionswhich were unanimously adopted bythe Healing House Association:THE RESOLUTIONS.?;iFOR LADIES ANDTLEMEN.

It is alleged that worrymakes people thin, but a fat personwill worry enough to cause the average thin person to disappear utterly,and keep gaining all the time.When fat is one's destiny, he maytry Turkish baths, only to find thathis system absorbs pounds and poundsof water.Rolling is prescribed as a cure, andin neighborhoods where fat peoplelive you may hear prodigious thumpsand bumps and moans and groans asof some one falling up and downstairs. This only increases the appetite. Fasting is recommended, but UptonSinclear has pretty nearly run it intopolitics.As to exercise, a certain man whoweighed 285 pounds took a severecourse of exercise; ne walked, he ran,he boxed and worked like a horse, andat the end of six months his fat hadvanished, being replaced by 288pounds of firm and solid muscle.Eminent authorities are coming tothe conclusion that fat is like thecolor of the hair; it cannot be changedmuch even if you diet.Would Not Go to Waste.,Jinkers," said the friend who waslooking over the new building. "Idon't see why in the world you didn'tmake your second and third storieslarger. They are too small for loftsand almost too narrow for hallways.What do you expect to do with them?""O, I'm not going to leave them asthey are," was the sage reply fromJinkers. "The carpenters will be heretomorrow to put in partitions andmake three five room suites of apartments on each floor."The Two Problems."No doubt," we say to the modiste,"there are puzzling problems to solvein your profession.""O yes," she replies.

It shouldthen be rinsed in tepid water andwashed with strong soapsuds in theusual manner.Milton's Foresight Good.John Milton wrote (prophetically,we grant) as follows regarding theteaching of the classics in some modern institutions: "And though a linguist should pride himself to have allthe tongues that Babel cleft the worldinto, yet if he have not studied thesolid things in them, as well as thewords and lexicons, he were nothingso much to be esteemed a learnedman as any yeoman or tradesmancompetently wise in his mother dialectonly."Good for American Detectives.Detectives who discovered a copy ofOliver Wendell Holmes' poems in thesuit case left behind by a burglar decided that they had a good clew to theman's identity. They figured out whata man who read Oliver WendellHolmes' poetry would probably looklike, and wben they saw a man whoanswered their mental picture theyexamined him.' Of course, it was thevery man. American detectives leadthe world.Long Sermons.Of one of the sermons, preached byDr. Samuel Parr in 1800, the lordmayor for the year is said to haveremarked to the preacher that therewere four things in the sermon whichhe had been very sorry to hear."Dear, dear, my lord," exclaimed, thedoctor, anxiously, "what were they?""Sir," was the reply, "I mean thequarters struck by the church clock."London Chronicle."Fifty Lucre" In Truth.The English system is to destroy allbills returning to the Bank of England, no matter how brief has beentheir life in circulation.

His mother's repeated "no" didnot satisfy him. She finally said, "Ican't buy any; I haven't any money."Emil replied, "Then why didn't youtake some when they passed itaround?" National Monthly.Made Sure of Death.A gruesome incident was reportedat an inquest at Biggleswade, England, a few days ago on the body ofHorace Endersby, aged 20.
