All the storesin this city heretofore required toclose at 4:00 p. m., in compliancewith the orders, received noticeFriday that they could keep openas long as they desired, providedthey burned neither coal, gas orwood or used electric lights. Themodification came in the shape of atelegram from Atlanta to Chief ofPolice Fred Link, who had asked forspecific instructions on which to actwilh authority. The message wasas follows:"Answering your telegram haveto say that groceries open at ninea. m. and close at six p. m., weekdays, and at nine on Saturdays.Fruit stores open at nine a. m. andclose at four p. m. throughout theweek. If stores wish to stay openafter specified closing time theymay do so, but must not use anylight or heat generated from wood,coal, coke, or gas. They may usekerosene lamps and kerosene stoves."This order will result in greatbenefit to the merchants as the holiday season draws nearer and nearer. Many are already extendinghours, and have installed coal oillamps and even candles. Merchantsmay thus be enabled to meet the requirements of the order and to givefull attention to their ChristmasI trade without fear of loss, and withonly a little inconvenience that willbe soon forgotten in the nature ofthings as they are.DON'T FORGET THE BOYA leatherized suit for the boy willmake him a present for Christmasthat will please and give satisfaction: We have a select stock,(x) MITCHELL & BLAKEMORE.YOU'LL LIKE IT."Do your shopping at A.

MEN'S STORE,(x) 619 Main Street.xx& CO.MODIFICATIONS MADETHE PAEIS TOBACCO MABKETWith all Burley price recordssoaring beyond those of the- pastseason on the Paris markets a newfact became firmly established, thata new era had been reached in thehistory of the tobacco growing industry in this county, and that theBourbon county growers are cominginto their own, coming, it might beduaea, m a right royal fashion,,iLix wc piesein. prices in mind andthe posibilities of the season yet tobe realized.Early predictions of hie-h nrineshave been more than realized, andme toDacco growers are unanimousin predicting that this year theprice level will be set higher thanwas ever dreamed of before, evenby the most sanguine. Well-postedmen called attention to the facrthat the loose leaf sold on thefloors of the local houses during thefirst days of the sales may be accepted as entirely representative ofthe offerings for the season. Takinginto consideration this fact it is safeto assert that the market is gainingin sirength steadily, and that theParis market will continue to be, asit has been in the past, one of thebest in Central Kentucky. Interestin the markets was in evidence yesterday to a greater degree than ever,when the opening of the sales forthe day found a large crowd ofgrowers, handlers, brokers, buyersand spectators on hand. The receipts were large, all roads leadingto Paris haing their quota of heavily-loadedwagons destined for yesterday's sales.At the Paris House of the Bourbon Warehouse Company yesterday,Jos. A. Farris, of near Millersburg,sold a crop of tobacco raised on aplot of one and one-half acres, atotal of 2,100 pounds, which nettedhim eighty cents a pound, or a totalof $1,655 for the entire crop.Another good sale was recordedwhen Lou Taylor sold a crop forseventy-nine cents a pound. Thiscrop was raised in two paddockswhere years ago Turney Bros.' crackThoroughbreds, Horron and Waterbass, tossed their heels in playfulabandon, and where they were partly trained. tPrices ruled high again at thelocal warehouses when the saleswere resumed Friday morning. Theofferings w.ere not large, but wererepresentative in character. Thetone of the market was strong andgenerally satisfactory. Receipts forthe succeeding days were good andprospects for high pfipes continuegood. " "TThe Bourbon Tobacco Warehousesold a total of 33,980 pounds of tobacco for an average of $59.69.The Independent House sold 45,000pounds for an average of $60.06.Lou Taylor sold a crop of 4,370pounds raised on a 3 -acre feed lot,for an average of $72.27. One ofthe features of the day was thesale of a crop of 375 pounds, raisedin a garden by . Miss MargaretAllen, daughter of Sanford M. Allen,Cashier of the Millersburg Farmers'Bank. This crop, sold at the Bourbon Tobacco Warehouse sold foran average, of $82.32. Dodge Bros!& Bills sold a crop of 3,300 poundsat the Paris Warehouse for an average of $85.33.' Some of the crop averages realized at the Bourbon Warehouse saleFriday, were as follows:L. C. Owens, who recently boughtthe Silas B. Bedford farm of 396acres on the Ford's Mill pike, soldprivately to Bush Bishop 25,000pounds of tobacco grown on a tractof sixteen acres, for 65 cents apound. Since tobacco prices haveruled so high, Mr. Owens has refused an offer of $400 an acre forhis farm.At the sale held at the CentralHouse, in Lexington, Friday, AlbertJohnson, of Bourbon county soldhis crop of 2,035 pounds for an average of $69.92. Very little Bourbon county tobacco has so far beensold on the other markets. Thegrowers seem to be satisfied withthe good prices realized on thelocal markets, now taking highrank.Tho record price of the seasonwas attained at yesterday's sale atthe Bourbon Tobacco WarehouseCo.'s Paris warehouse, and thefaces of the management wore thatglad smile that won't come off.The Paris Warenouse sold at thatsale 113,966 pounds of tobacco for amoney value of $71,884.77. an average of $63.08.

Wages, too,advanced, so that in practicallyevery line of industry employers andemployees are now receiving greatercompensation than ever before.A conspicuous exception to this,however, is the public utility companies upon which the public is dependent for light, heat, telephonedwater ana transportation, whilethe cost of bituminous coal has increased 86 per cent, all other products they use almost in the sameproportion, and wages of employeesnearly as much, an attempt hasbee'n made in some instances to holdthese essential companies to prewar rates.The public has a tremendous stakein these corporations, not merely because they employ thousands of men,and their securities represent thesavings of men, and. their securitiesrepresent the savings, of thousandsof small investors, but because thebusiness and social life of everycommunity centers around them.-These companies must bo treatedsanely and scientifically. It is tcthe interest of every business manto see that any misstatements madeby demagogic politicians or otherswho do not have the public's interests at heart, should be promptlyquestioned. "Where do you getyour facts?" should be the questionimmediately asked of anyone whopurports to talk upon matters sovital to the interests of every citizen of the State.

The useof the (famous Epsom Downs courseas a resting place for convalescing soldiers necessitated the running -of thefamous British Derby at Xewmarkerin 3014, 191.), UHG, J917 and IfllS. Thepreoccupation of the spoilsmen ofGre:it Britain in the huine.ss of warcaused them, to a certain extent, toneglect the thoroughbred sales of 191"",391C and 1917, and Americans wereenabled to slip in and buy up a lot ocfirst-class stallions and mares with"Which to enrich the American thoroughbred industry.France Alone Stops Racing.-Of the great nations participating inthe great war, France alone felt thenecessity of stopping horse racing.Threatened with utter destruction in aflood of Teutonic barbarism, Francehad to send to the lighting lines on lheifarne, the Somme, the Aisne aboutVerdun, in the Vosgcs, every maleFrenchman capable of bearing' arms.Back of the fighting lines she had tomobilize the elderly- men with " thewomen and children for the imperativework of making, munitions. UponFrance alone fell the burden" of resisting the German tide for upward of twoyears. Throughout the course of thewar speed tests were held at the greatPrcnch tracks, but not as public spectacles. But there was no letting downof, the bars as regards the exportationfrom France of thoroughbred bloodanjT time during the war. -As a specialconsideration citizens of the UnitedStates, a country from, which theFrench, from the very beginning of thewar, were drawing enormous quantities of military matexial, who had thoroughbred studs in France, such men as..John Sanford, of Amsterdam, MajorAugust Belmont. .loeph E.

The Britisli Parliament was therefore constraii'Od to accept the 1917 Major HallWalker's generous offer of his entirethrouirhbred stud as the nucleus of agreat Imperial Military Horse Breeding establishment and to employ LordLonsdale to manage and race the produce of that establishment on thetracks of. Great Britain for purposesof elimination as the Imperial Germangovernment had employed variousscions of German royalty to race theproduce of the national studs of Graditz and Trekenuen for thirty-five orforty years before the outbreak of p'-rthe great war.The munificence of Major Walker'sgift to his country will be understoodwhen it is .realized that his stud hadbeen taxed on a valuation of upwardof- $8,000,000. Now that the war isover Parliament is beginning to appropriate vast sums annually for themaintenance of this Imperial horsebreeding establishment after the manner such establishments had beenmaintained in France, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy for half a century before the German invasion ofBelgium. To promote the quick production of quantities of horses of thoroughbred, three-quarterbred and halfbred types, this establishment is preparing to give direct support to theCanadian National Bureau of Breeding,which was established some seven oreight years prior to 1914, and whichsupplied the Canadian and Britishforces with thousands of splendid halfbreds, and to create subsidiary branches in Australia, New Zealand, SouthAfrica and India.

C. CantrillbftS ffiven OUt the follo-orinc interview relative to the stocks of Burley tobacco in the hands of manufacturers and dealers:"As the market on Burley tobaccowill shortly open In Kentucky, afctatement of the stocks of Burley inthe hands of dealers ..and manufacturers will be of interest to the tobacco growers and to the tobaccotrade generally."The Cantrill Tobacco CensusLaw has-been in operation nqw fortight years and reports made underthis law show that during the pasteight years the manufacturers ofBurley tobacco have been consuming this type as fast as the Burleygrowers could produce it. The following figures issued by the Government under the Cantrill TobaccoLaw will bear out this statement:"In 1912 when the law first wentinto effect there were in the handsof the dealers and manufacturers,in round number 215,000,000pounds of Burley tobacco on October 1st, and the following amountson October 1st for the various years,were in the hands of the dealers andmanufacturers for the years given,and the figures given in roundnumbers: . ,Year 1913 225,000,000 lbsYear 1914 203,000,000 lbsYear 1915 249,000,000 lbsYear 1916 199,000,000 lbsYear 1917 207,000,000 lbsYear 1918 190,000,000 lbsOct. 1, 1S19 .. ..229,000,000 lbs"It is well known that the cropof tobacco grown in the year 1918was an unusually large crop of Burley tobacco, and yet on October 1,1919, the stocks in the hands of thedealers and manufacturers are practically tne same as tne averageamount during the past eight years.It is also well known ' to everyoneconversant with conditions in ' theBurley tobacco District that the cropgrown this yeai is an unusuallyshort crop of tobacco, and applyingthe law of supply and demand, thereis every reason to believe that therewill be t an unusual demand for thethe crop of tobacco which wlil goon to the market very shortly, andthere is every reason why, owing tothe seal city of Burley tobacco andthe stocks in the hands of the manufacturers and dealers, the cropwhich is to be sold this winter ofBurley tobacco should, bring a higher price than ever in the history ofthe tobacco market. The figuresgiven above are indisputable in establishing the fact that during thepast eight years the manufacturersand dealers have v been using ourBurley tobacco just as fast as thegrowers could produce it. All of thtother tobacco markets in the UnitedStates have been higher this yearthan ever before in the history ofthose markets on other types of tobacco, and with the small amount inthe hands of manufacturers anddealers as shown by the CantrillTobacco Census Law and the extremely short crop which was grownduring the past season, would makeit appear from every reasonablestandpoint that the price of tobaccothis year on the Burley type shouldbreak all previous records."o'Friendship Shows Worth.I often, find'' myself going back, toDarwin's' saying about the durationof a man's friendship being one ofthe best measures of his worth.
