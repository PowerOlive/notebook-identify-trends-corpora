wasmined throughout and that 040 torpedoes were located at available pointsChicago Feb 17 The TribunesWashington correspondent says Inspite of official disclaimers the opinion is rapidly gaining gronnd herethat the destruction of the battleshipMaine in Havana harbor was not anaccidentWhen he came out of the whitehouse Wednesday Secretary Long expressed the opinion that the ship hadbeen destroyed by an accidental explosion of its magazines and this was thedecision arrived at during the specialcabinet meeting called to consider thecatastropheAll this time however navy officerswere persistent in the declaration thatthe ship had been destroyed by hostile3iands They were divided as to whether the explosion was caused by Spanish officers or cranks but they wereunited in believing developmentswould speedily show that the originalexplosion was not due to carelessnesson the shiiLate in the afternoon cipher dispatches began to arrive from CaptSigsbee which seemed to give a strongcolor to this theory of the explosionand which added to the anxiety as totlie outcomeThe excitement here Wednesdaynight was intense for aside from theappatying loss of life there is a feelingihat the destruction of the Maine maybe after all only the opening gun ofactual hostilities fired in a way peculiarly Spanish and as opposed to theaisages of modern warfare as has beenthe whole course of events in Cuba fornearry three yearsThe United States government pending the result of the official inquiry ordered by Secretary Long assumes that theMaine was destroyed by an accidentalexplosion While this is the officialview the suspicion is growing in andout of the navy departwent that thedisaster was the work of the SpaniardsThe place where the Maine was anchored was

the destruction of the battleshipMaine in Havana harbor Tuesdaynignt the situation AVednesQay nightnumber ofcablegrams between WashinirionandHavana- can be summed up in the wordsof Secretary Long when asked as hewas about to depart for the daywhether lie had reason to suspect thatthe disaster was the work of an enemyrepliedI do not In that I am influencedby the fact that Capt Sigsbee has notyet reported to the navy departmenton the cause He is evidently waitingto write a full report So long as hedoes not express himself I certainlycan not I should think from the indications however that there was anaccident that the magazine explodedHow that came about I do not knowFor the present at least no other warship will be sent to HavanaThe appalling nature of the disasterand the gravity of the situation thatwould arise should investigation givea basis for the undercurrent of suspicion of treachery and foul play thatran through all minds had a soberingeffect on public men of all shades ofpolitical opinion The fact stands forthand is little less than remarkable thatnot a single resolution was introducedor a single speech made in either houseof congress save one of condolencewith the families of the killed offeredby Mr Boutelle and adopted by thehouse of representatives Public menexpressed their opinions with reservewhen approached for interviews buteverywhere there -was a demand for anIT4 uiyinvestigation and full details in thelight of which the horror may be justly viewedSecretary Long undoubtedly summarized the general opinion of themajority of the naval experts in finding it impossible just now to state thecause of the destruction of the MaineThere are a great number of theoriesbut most of them are of a characterthat makes it easy to prove or upsetthem by a single investigation by adivei Secretary Long has taken immediate steps to make this investigation Late Wednesday afternoon hetelegraphed to Adm Sicard atKey West to appoint a board of navalofficers to proceed at once to Havanaemploy divers and generally to makesuch inquiry as the regulations of thenavy demand shall be made in thecase of the loss of a ship It is expected that this work will take sometjine and while there are officers whosay that in their opinion it will not bepossible owing to the probably disrupted condition of the hull of theship to make out the cause of theexplosion the opinion of amajority is that the question will be easily settled bythe simple observation of the conditionof the ships hull plates in the neighborhood of the hole which sunk herwhether or not they are bulged outy aswould be the case if the explosion camefrom the inside or whether theyweredriven in as would result from the attack of a torpedo or the explosion of amine beneath the ship The large majority of naval officers are inclinedto the belief that the explosion resulted from spontaneous combustionof a coal bunker the over heatingof the iron partitions betweenthe boilers and the magazine or fromthe explosion of a boiler though thelast theory finds little support Thelists of survivors that came to the navydepartment Wednesday afternoon inanswer to telegrams was inaccurateand made out the loss of life eightmore than the summary originallygiven by Capt Sigsbee in an earliertelegram so Secretary Long telegraphed for another corrected lisfi andalso one that should show whoKyrenot

was to beproperly honoredin Wathena Thesettlers had decided that it oughtto be done andthe method of itscarrying- out was left to a committeeconsisting- of the storekeeper the teacher and one of the leading- cattlemenwho rumor said had once owned a libraryOf course it aint proving nothingabout our honesty that we do this sortof thing remarked Borden the rancheforeman but its the right thing todoYes Washington was a fine oldgentleman added the storekeeper anwe Virginians always will stand byhimMighty nice thing to be honoringthe leader of a revolution broke in agruff voice from the rear of the storeJit was the Englishman who was overseeing the fencing of the Olympic Cattle companys new lands He had beena farmer over in the Cimmarron country and was alwajs objecting to whatever was on footHush up 3rou got too badly lickedto talk was the rejoinder from Borden and Glade the foreigner subsidedThe celebration was to take place inthe schoolhouse out on the edge ofthe tiny settlement From its dooreould be seen the haze that coveredthe tops of the Spanish peaks off tothe west and also the sunken lines ofthe Cimmarron It was all the conception of the pretty school mistress whothought to thus raise enough money tobuy a flag for the ibuildingsw roof- TherewereTother inducements or thetwo men who helped in the preparations Borden and Grade The cattleman thought there was no one likeLizzie Dean and the Englishmanthought the sameYou are to be Washington said thedirector to Borden and the part fitted him wellAll right Ill lick the Britishers outof their boots he declared as hepranced around with a stick for asword and cast ugly looks at GladeAnd you shall be Cornwallis turning to Glade This too seemed satisfactoryNight after night they met at theschoolhouse preparing the rendition ofthe play The half dozen actors weredetermined that there should be noground for criticism Spring was earlyon the prairie and the gray and browngrasses were drj as tinder The closecurling buffalo grass was like that ofthe blue stem crinkling in the breezeand the cattle were nibbling it away toget at the tin spears of green beneathOne night the play was nearly overwhen Borden remarked in tones thatcame to the ears of the entire company If I had my way Id orderevery one of these red coats off the soilof AmericaMjajbe you cant do any better thandid your first president at that wasthe sneer that came from back in theflies curtains strung on pieces oftwine somewhereBorden grew angry Well I cantry the same as he did He won in theend I believeThe Englishman came out in themiddle of the room I would not advise thee to try it he drawled Thewords were not more than out of hismouth when there came a crash ofscenery and along with the flies andnearly everything portable came Borden from the stage which he left withleap He made straight for the throatof his adversary but what met hisgrasp when he reached out was MissDeans handThere there let this stop righthere The man you represent wouldnever have fought in the presence of a-womanIBorden abashed stood back andthen went to the stage But it didnot mean the end of the trouble everybody knew that The men had a fightafter the evenings practice was overbut it settled nothing except that theywere both very much in love withLizzieThe school did not amount to muchthose days for all the scholars werepracticing for their parts in the coming drama The work on the ranchessuffered likewise for there was thesame interest among the olderpeopleOn the night before the festal day therewas a final practicing at the schoolhouse and again the twoof the opposing sides in the revolution had their warfare of wordsIn his speech the American took painsto insert few words reflecting on theEnglishmen who came out to the westto run cattle ranches and the Englishman said some cutting things thatpointed at frontier mannersSee here gentlemen said Lizziegone far enoughhave 3ou quarreling all the time Youmust settle jour troubles somewhereelseAll I want is to win you whisperedthe Englishman behind the scenes afew minutes later Will you give methe answerNo this is a warfare that jrou mustsettle with Mr Borden I would liketo see how this contest of the rivalpowers comes outWell it will be different to that ofthe days of 1776 was the sententiousanswer But would itI dont like to see that Englishmanaround you so much whispered Borden a few minuteslaterWhy he behaves himself repliedMiss Dean with well feigned astonishmentBut it aint patriotic dont you seewas the retort You ought to standup for your country and Washington This last proudly for Bordenwas really elated at the character hewas taking in the plajSo I must make this a national affairNo just a personal affair but be patriotic in iiThus the matter stood when Washingtons birthday dawned an armedtruce between the opposing forceseach of which was intent on winningthe prize and confident that it couldbe doneSoft blew the southern breeze andthe night was dark From miles ofplain came the breath of spring thatwas giving the first earnest of its glorynl W r X VC nt I TTY1 Cin wagons the ranchmen came onhorseback and the line of ponies thatfringed the schoolhouse yard was formidable The Englishman came in allthe glory of hisBorden made hisbest clothes whileappearance in thefrontier dress that so well becamehimNo reserved seats come right inI welcomed the storekeeper as he tookthe tickets at the door The crowdobeyed and filled the front seats theback seats and overflowed the aislesNow ladies and gentlemen announced the storekeeper when all wasread3we will present the great dramaof the time of Washington as is mostappropriate on this occasionThe curtain rolled up again a sheeton a pole and the simple incidents thathad been chosen to give a representation of the life of the first presidentwere one after another called forthThere was nothing but peace until theact where the meeting of the hero andCornwallis occurred Then as thetwo rivals came on the little stage therewras a howl of delight from the menpresent for each knew how mattersstoodBorden looked daggers at Glade andas his turn came to speak all realizedthat he was putting strange sentiments into the mouth of Washingtonwhen he said You may be as good aman as the rest of us but you are notso braveCornwallis colored and the storekeeper remarked to his wife Blestif I dont think Borden struck homethat timeBut Glade responded with due courtesy It remains to be proved as tothat amd then went on with his setspeechThe play was long and the audiencewas evident weary when the final actcame The rivals were on the stage andthere was a chance for some more repartee which was likely to be given whensuddenly there was a sound from theoutside of the house that caused theheart of ever auditor to sink with anill defined fear It was a whinnj of terror from a score of horses throatsQuickly the people rushed from theirseats and to the windows and doorsWhat they saw was something that isnever without its message of alarm forthe ranchman and the settler theprairie was on fireIn an Instant almost the house wasemptied The women were crying andthe men were trying to calm the frightened horses One by one the wagonswere hurrying off the owners anxiousto get home or at least out of the reachof the dangerIt was high timeLike a sea of flame the onvusningblaze was sweeping across the dry sodlicking up the long grass of the ravinesand making quick work of the crispcovering of the higher lands The windhad risen amd was bringing the attacking army onward with rapid paceThere was no chanc for the school-l house to escapey InTHE BOURBON NEWS FRIDAY FEBRUARY 18 J898cannotIing mass the people left the place andtheir wagons and horses were dottingthe flame lighted plain Two menfound themselves side by side a quarterof a mile from the building each on hisbroncho and each gallopimg toward thenorthAs they mounted a little swell in theprairie the blaze lighted their facesFrom each came an exclamation Borden GladeI thought you were with her demanded the former angrilyI thought you were the oneFor an instant the two men glaredat each other and then the test cameBordem looked straight in the face ofthe Englishman and then at the sea offlame sweeping up from the south andwhose breath was hot in their facesWell he demanded which shallit be This isthe time to prove whichis the true representative of braveryOh its not that sort of a questionpleaded the otherIt is just that sort of a questionThere is a chance for

rodethe horses becoming wilder as eachwhiff of the wind brouirht tliem astronger smell of smokeFinally the Englishman began to fallbehind His horse was not so unruly asBordens and there seemed no reasonfor his retrogressionCome on Cornwallis called theranchman and the cut was felt by thelaggardFaster and faster rode the frontiersman into the thick of the smoke andwas lost to the sight of his comradeWith head bent lowandnotrils shieldedin the folds of his cloak he steered toward the schoolhouse whose black formrose out of the flames tFinally the door was reached andwith a shout he called to the teacherWas she there He remembered thatshe had gone to the rear of the buildingwhen the alarm was given She mighthave thought there was no danger instaying in the schoolhouseHe leaped from the

horse in the midsi of afire and also see that two helplesscharges did not fall from the back ofthe animal But Borden with his superb mastery of horseflesh did it andthe gait that they took through thewall of flame was something marvelousHad the riders been living a little nearer to civilization they would have calledit record breakerWell that was a scorcher remarked Borden when they had cometoa

streetcar man wants io knowjust what his cars and his line are doing he looks up the car milage record oithe road The maintenance of this record has developed into a perfect system T J Nicholl gives some interesting details of how the system is operatedby a street railway company which has7ri miles of tracks in one city and anaverage daily mileage of between 13000and 14000 miles or about 5000000 milesannuallyIn the first place the road engineersmake a careful survey of each line mapping out their observations to the scaleof 400 feet to an inch These maps showall switches cross overs junctionscross streets etc and the distances aregiven from the head of the line to allpoints where it is possible to turnFrom these maps figured tables aremade for any specified number of halftrips in either direction on each routeTravelers on a street car that is approaching the terminus have often observed the conductor filling in aschedule The report thus made is indispensible to the vital statistics of theroad Each mbtorman makes a reportof the number of trips made by his cardaily on a card which answers a threefold purpose In addition to giving thenumber of trips made it answers astime card and also as a trouble reportAny motorman taking out a car makesout one of these cards which he handsto his relief and the man pulling thecar into the barn drops this card into abox provided for the purpose Thenight foreman has access to this boxFrom the reports he finds out where repairs are necessarjr and what he is unable to complete hereports to the dayforeman On every montorman is impressed the importance of having histrips time etc correct and he is required to account for any trips lost Heis also held strictly accountable for anydefect about the car which he may failto notice The trip cards are checkedwith the starters report so that nocards can be -left out Beyond this thetime of leaving the barn and pulling inmust agree so that there is no chanceof anyone getting paid for more timethan he had actually put inFrom these trip cards the mileage isfigured by routes the mileage for eachcar being put down separately on theslip A daily report is made for themanager which shows the mileage andearnings on each line the weather andother details It also gives the corresponding figures for the previous yearFrom the monthly mileage statementare figured all

long sincegone At any rate it was the only homeI could really call my ownThere were two rooms the sparebedroom and the parlor adjoining onthe first floor which still retained thefurniture Everything about theserooms though faded and somewhatworn was in good order and T complimented Mrs Snyder oh the care shehad takenSarah had thrown up the windowsand the soft evening air came into theroomsAlthough the place had not beenallowed to go to ruin there was aboutit that indescribable- quality which isattached to long deserted houses Wealkfelt it more or less Sarah and MrsSnyder spoke in whispers Jake steppedabout on tiptoe as though fearful thatthe heavy tread of his cowhide bbotswould bring back the spirits of thedeparted while to myself there was apathos about the old house which hadnot known an inhabitant for so longIt seemed like some human being deserted by its own flesh and bloodWhile I was passing from bureauto wardrobe from center table to mantel-piecetaking mental notes of all theold fashioned china andwhich adorned those places still andwhich in my young days had been forbidden my boyish fingers Sarah andMrs Snyder made up the bed taking thebedding froma huge cedar chest whichstood on one side of the roomSprigs of spruce and hemlock hadbeen placed in the chest from time totime and when the cover wa liftedthe pungent odor filled the roomAll through the preparations I noticed that Sarah and Mrs Smder wereengaged in earnest conversationThe old widow was especially vehement and Saiah would frequentlyshake her heac and give forth exclamations indicative either of wonder or ofdisapprobation My old nurse also favored me with many glances whichseemed to have much of solicitude inthem- When everything had been done tomake me comfortable for the nightSarah turned to me and spoke lowwith a touch of fear in her toneswCome Nel you go back home withus she saidDont stay here all alonein dis grade big house I am afraitto haf you Come back with us

graveiWULTETOld Jake gave a sudden start whichattracted my attention to him I sawhim gaze through the open doorway into the parlor in very evident terror andheard him exclaim in low awed tonesGottinHimmelI could not restrain a smile at thesightr of the tall strong man overcomeby childish fears and was about to upbraid him for his foolishness But I remembered the vein of superstitionwhich runs through the lives of thePennsylvania farmers and so said nothingCome back with us again pleadedSarahNo If there is anything out of theordinary about ray house I am all themore determined to remain and find outwhat it is I said decisively Then Iadded more softly for I did not wishto wound the kind heart of my old nurseI knew her fear for me grew out ofher love and solicitude

ofthem Old Jake was eager and anxioustobe off but Sarah hung back reluctantto leave me to the lonely terrors whichher superstitious mind had conjured upIt was only after I had given my promise to come immediately to her housein the event of any danger to me springing up that she consented to leavePeeling profoundly gratified that mycoming here had revealed to me suchabsolute trust and love as inspired myold nurse I placed my arm about herwaist while going to the door and thenparted from her with a kiss on herwrinkled old cheekAfter the sound of the wagon wheelshad died away in the distance I disrobedand prepared for bed The moonlightwas so enticing however that I satdown on a chair bv the window and fora few minutes gavemjself up to reminiscent thoughtBut before T go on with my experiences in the old house I must tell aboutthe bank robbery of which I was suspected fUp to a year before I had been employed in a large savings institution inPhiladelphia My advancement Wiijithis concern had been slow but steady sand after ten years of earnest wbrjkfuifinally -attained the position of seniorlpaying teller Under my immediatecharge was the vault in which the cashand all securities held by the bank werekept This vault was of course guarded by a time lock The bank opened forbusiness at ten oclock but the bookkeepers began their work a half hourearlier There was a separate vault forthe books of the concern which was notfurnished with a time lock and all thebookkeepers knew the combination ofthis vaultThe bank was noted for its conservative business methods and the greatcautiousness with which its funds wereguarded It was the established rulethat the timepiece of the money vaultshould not be set to open until halfpast nine at which time the bookkeepers and most of the employes were atwork In short so caref ul uverei theofficials that under no circumstanceswas it allowable to leave the combination lock unguarded by the clockworkunless some responsible employe waspresentOne afternoon I set the clockworkmechanisni to throw the bolt at halfpast eight ai hour before the usualtime as I intended to get to work thenext morning at that time The semiannual examination of the books andsecurities by the trustees was to -takeplace and I wished to have the moneysunder my charge in orderWhen I left the bank that afternoonI found a telegram awaiting me atmylodging placeCome out to Fairlawn this eveningWe entertain a small party I wantyou Thus the dispatcli ran and it wassigned by a name very dear to me Florence MorleyI would willingly have gone to theantipodes to please the lovely youngwoman and my disappointment waskeen when I thought of -the time lockhaving been set to open at half pasteight the f ollowingmorning For Fairlawn was a country seat of Mr Morleys about 30 miles distant and 1should not be able to return until nearly ten oclock in the morning and thecombination lock would be unprotecteda full hour before the arrival of Anycf the employes It was highly improbable that any thief expert enoughto open the combination would attemxtthe lock even if it were known that thetime mechanism had run down Therisk would be very slight and I wastempted to take it But knowing eventhoughno consequences should be theresult that by doing so I Would breaka very stringent rule I resisted thetemptatioh and in no very good humorstarted for a telegraph office for thepurpose of sending a dispatch to MissMorley stating fny inability to accepther invitationOn my way I met an associate in thebank named Horace Jackson He wasone of the bookkeepers a man about40 years old and a quiet reserved fellow He never mingled in any disputeor controversy among the clerks was acompetent accountant and lived a se1 cludecT life -outside -of the

further Jackson saidI returned to my lodgings light-heartedand happy at the prospect of againseeing the sweet girl whom I had lovedand worshiped for some time in secretSo then Horace Jackson was acquainted with Mr Morley I could notbut feel a greater respect for JacksonFor Mr Morley was one of the most influential and highly-thought-of men inPhiladelphia and besides was one ofthe trustees of

to him but then thoseattentions had been extended out offriendship only How he would be affected by the knowledge that I wasfrom this evening the accepted lover ofhis daughter I could not surmise Icould only hope that Florences influence which I was well aware was powerful with her father might prevailThe dear girls heart was mine at anyrate for she had told me so and I believed her wordsAfter the evenings enjoyment I withdrew to the hotel near the depot whereI passed the rest of the night in happyanticipations of the futureThe train which took me back to thecity was a few minutes late and when Iarrived at the bank it lacked but tenminutes of opening timeHad I been late either the presidentor the treasurer would have had to becalled upon to open the vault and it isdoubtful if either of them remembered the combination The bond tellerand the head receiving teller sharedwith me the knowledge of the combination but as those two gentlemen wereaway on their vacations at this time Iwas the only one besides the officialswho could unlock the vaultThe heavy outside doors were soonopened and suntmoning the porter tohelp me carry out the cash for thedajs business I entered the vaultThere

Relationship -withthe AphidsThe faotthat ants use aphids formilchcows was discovered nearly a centuryago but the special care given to theirlive stock has been a subject of morerecent study Almost anyone may haveobserved ants rushing up and down thetrunks of trees and Shrubs It is no joyof climbing nor desire for a wide outlook that leads the ants to ascendtrees but because the leaves of thetrees afford jmsturage for their smallcattle the aphids These little creatures exude voluntarily drops of asweet liquid known as dew Theprocess of milking is this the antcomes up to the aphid and

this relationgbipaecruexonljlto the ants However this is not thecase The ants are fierce defendersof their flocks and make it very uncomfortable for tlhe many insect enemies of the aphids Some species of antsbuild sheds over the aphids upon thetrees and other species remove themto the safety of their own nests butth special claim of the ants as aphidprotectors lies in the care of the aphideggs which are shown as much attention as their ownThe habits of arats has proven ofeconomic importance to our farmersof the -middle west One of tne seriouspests in that region -is the corn rootiuuse Prof Forbes has demonstratedthat these corn root lice are absoluteJydependent on -the ants which live in the -earthof the cornfields Ants fetch thelast brood of aphids in the fall intotheir nests and there the oviparous genoration is developed and the eggs arelaid The an Is give these eggs greatcare taking them into the deeper galleries during cold weather and fetchingthem to the surface in warm daysWhen the young aphids hatch the antstake them and place them upon thecorn roots and thus gain a nucleus fortheir summer herds This shows aprocess of reasoning on the part of theants since they do not feed upon cornroots themselves and yet seem to knowthat the aphids require this foodAnna Botsford Corns tock inquanThe Grand Colorado CanyonThe great intermountain streamslike the Yellowstone and
