showed his approval fthe mates efforts and Tarbox was apparently convinced for be shook handswarmly with the speaker ami exclaimedIts a lucky thing I met you Dicktold me he bad written to both theAverys They were old friends of hisHe told me 1o look out for them inDyea Have von got the papers withyouThats what I Lave Here they si11 shipshape and above board repliedRider as he proceeded to

his confusion andthen addedIts all right of course but a manto be careful Once let the mobkiow where we are and what wevefourd ami wed be overrun in no timeAs luck would have it Rank Bowerschose this instant when Tarbox wasexamining the papers to throw a lookof ferocious triumph on tin mate Although neither of them noticed the factJoe- Tarbox raised his eyes just thenand to a man of his training nothingmere was needed to put him on hisguardHe cast a keen look at Bowers and asif his scrutiny had been satisfactory liedropped his eyes again but there was alittle hardening- of the muscles aboutliks jaw and with a careless twist of hisbody he brought his weapon nearer hishandHe was too old a hand however tomake any outward sign of alarm andsaid coollyIts a pity you didnt pick up the other Avery at Dyea lie ought to be thereby this timeAnd how can we find your parunerAsked BowersDo just as the letter says repliedTarbox Build a tire and hell see thesmoke and come The route is

horses 1 shallhave to go to Skaguay 1 shant beback under a fortnight or three weeksat the bestA fter finishing his pipe Tarbox pleied fatigue and rolled himself up ii hisblanket But there was no sleep forhim that night The sinister look onBowers face had given him the clew hewanted and as he waited atiently fordaylight he muttered to himselfThat was a close shave There issomething wrong about that sailor ifLis company is anything to go by Ifthis Bowers isnt the man I saw drivenout of doe Ladues station for stealingthen Im mistaken Dick will be alllight They may make ad the iirethey wai I and thats all the gooditll do them ml just bring bark twoor tl ee men of the t ic with meheres uo other wayAt the first sign of daylight he wasastir A liastj meal was soon eatenand shaking hands cordially with bothmen he saidTell Dick Ill be back as - as 1an Sou cant mi trailThen struck out manfully on theback track to Dyea leaving tie plottersstanding in front of their 1 t exultingCHAPTER IXJOINING FORCESPom aI bis party camped the firstnigh about 30 mi- a Dyea Thenext morningthey were early astir andcontinued their journey The younggirl was too full of life and spirits toride quietly at her fathers side andTom had several long chats with heras they wound their way along thefain t ly ma iked t ra 1 1She confided to him that she did notreTT ember her mother who died whenshe was very young Site had alwayslived in Wisconsin with her father andwas an cniy child Site refused to belt ii d on the present occasion shesaid ami it was very apparent sheraicd her father in most thing-In return Tom described his life athome and the young girl listened withbreathless interest- to the story of thevovage and his adventure at San FranciscoShe was riding by his side late in theafternoon when suddenly she pointedlo the summit of a hill not far aheadand exclaimedSee Theres a man coming thiswarTHE BOURBON NEWS PAKIS KY FRIDAY NOVEMBER 24 1899She had scarcely spoken when thesecond mate announced the same factAs for Tcm he would not have seen anarmy just at that time for candor compels the statement that he was alreadyhopelessly in love with his fair companion and paid but little attention toother thingsFive minutes later Joe Tarbox hadmet them and Tom accosted him atonce withHow are you Bound for DyeaThats just it was the response asthe man ran his eyes rapidly ov r theliberal outfit with an appreciativeglance Where might you be headingWere going toward Fort Selkirksaid TomGoing down the river to DawsonIts hard to tell where well fetchup replied the young man evasivelyDid you meet anyone on this traillately asked Avery pushing forwardThe man hesitated a moment andthen saidWell yes I did meet two men yesterday Friends of yoursWhat were they like asked TomOne was a tall chap that I think Iveseen tit the river stations and the etherwas a sailor He said he was and helooked it He was stout built with anose that looked as if it was brokengome time HeObed EiderIts the mateThe exclamations broke simultaneous v from Tom and I recti while thestranger looked at them in surpriseand ad tiedThat w isnt the name he gave mesaid name was Tom Scott1By thunder Were on the righlcourse shouted Green while Tomcould only gaspTom Seott Thats my nameThe man looked at them a momentia blank astonishment and then a lightevidently seemed to break on his mindfor he turned and looked sharply atAvery and askedWill you tell me your nameCertainly My name is WilliamAveryThe other man stepped up to him atonce ami extended one if his handspalm downward on the middle finger ofwhich was a heavy gold ring with a curious device in the backIf that is your name you can tellme the history of this ring he saidlooking Avery full in the faceI surely ought to be able to wasthe reply while the others looked on insurprise at the little scene beiag enacted so unexpectedly before themI gave it to Dick Taylor in Californiaa iood many years ago You must bethe man he mentioned it his letter tome You are Joe Tarbox cr youwouldnt have that ringKiffhl vou are was the hearty respouse and Im mighty glad to seeyou Can you vouch for these twomen Is this really the Scott yourbrother mentioned in his willWhat do you know about his willdemanded Tom blankhBecause Ive seen itSeen it I was robbed of it in FriscoThe mate must have shown it tohim broke in Green I knew I wasright all the timeThe questions now flew thick andfast and soon Tarbox was made awareof the true slate of affairs Tomshowed him the identification he hadbrought from San Francisco which removed the last lingering doubt buttheir new acquaintance w as determinedto take no chances He maintained adiscreet silence in regard to the mineand its exact location declaring thatuntil his part ner had seen and acknowledged the party he was not at liberty toreveal any of the secretsAt length Avery said abruptlyBut you are not going to Dyea nowWe have supplies enough here to feedour party ami you two besides for thenext vear You must come back withs We ought to hurry as fast as wecan with those two scoundrels aheadof us They may catch Dick with theuaners thevve irot How can he tellbut what they are all straightTarbox chuckled grimly as he repliedThey wont find him Youll understand better when you gei there Dickwill know the tallest galoot the moment he sets his eyes on him Weveboth seen him before Tim sailor pickedcut just the man to queer him withDick f it wasnt for that 1 might feela little bit uneasy but its ail right Ib i vou Dick Taylor is no tenderfootWe might as well camp for the nightItll soon be dark If all litis staff isgrub theres enough to feed the wholeKlondike countrylie was firm in his refusal to proceed further that day and in fact bythe time the loads had been removedfrom the fa irses and the animals earedfor the sun had disappeared The tentswere soon pitched and after supperand a friendly chat the entire partyStretched themselves on their rudecouches and were soon asleepAn early start was made the following morning and three days laer asthey reached tin- lopof a long hill Tarbox pointed to a white cliff a lew milesto the north and saidThere is where the trail branches off to our place Its only about25 or 30 moles then Wed betterpush ahead and see if we cant make ituove darkAn hour later they reaehtd the landmark Tom could not see tiny sign ofa trail in the direction in which Tarbox turned his horses head but alteramoment the latter pointed to a spotwhere the marks of hoofs were plainlyto be seen and said coollyOur two friends managed to findtheir way I seeHe had not uttered a threat againstthe men who had tried to deceive himbut Tom felt certain there would be aday cf reckoning in the near futureThere was an air of resolution abouttheir guide which is only gained bycontact with danger in its variousformsPush the horses aloug said TarboxWe shant want all of them after today Mebbe we shant want them at allWe cant keep them where we are goingBut theres plenty of meat on theirbones said TomWe wont need itTarbox was apparently determinednot to explain himself and the subjectwas dropped Mile after mile was rapidly traversed for the country wascomparatively open and even the packhorses could tret at times Still theguide showed no sign of pausing andat last the sun was dipping behind thehorizon Then he suddenly turned tothe left around a huge bowlder towardwhich they had been traveling for sometime and the rest saw directly in frontof them the summits of two lofty hillsthe gorge between them being denselywooded about half way up on eithersideThe tops were still crowned withsnow upon which the setting sun shoneits crimson rays until they seemedbathed in bloodfor some distance on the left of thetravelers extended a perpendicular clifffully a hundred feet high and accessibleonly to the birds On the right theascent was more gradual but the treesw re very dense until the snowline wasn achedTarbox led the way among thebowlders at the foot of the cliff until hecame to an opi n spot Then he dismounted and saidWe tire here Now for a fireTom was about to go for fuel whenhe saw Tarbox reach behind a rock andbring out a handful of dry twigs andmoss which he soon ignited When theblaze shot up he covered it with dampmess and the result was adense columnof smoke which went curling up theface of the eiiff until it showed distinctly against the sky aboveThe other men busied themselves withthe usual routine work of camping butTarbox stood by the fire in silence forfully ten minutes An anxious- look began to appear on his face but suddenly1 e gave a little exclamation of relief asa pebble struck him on the shoulder andrebounded to the groundIll be back in a minute he calledto Averys daughter who was nearestto him Then he disappeared behindone of 1 he rocksLike a shadow he glided along in thegathering darkness twisting and turning without hesitation until he stoppediniAKmgyi2 vTSee theres a man coming this wayat a spot where the base of the cliffwas covered with scrub and moss Witha hasty glance about him as if to becertain no one was watching him hestooped and pulled aside a mass ofclinging creepers from the rock revealing a narrow opening some three feetwide and extending upwards to an unknown heightAll right Dick he whispered softlyand then came a rustling noise as aman appeared from the dark cavityand grasped his Land warmlyCHAPTEK XRUN DOWN AT LASTWhat brought ou back so quicksaid the newcomer in a low tone 1wasnt looking for any signal and wasjust going to turn in when 1 happenedto see the smoke Who have joubrought with youOne of the Averys is with me wasthe reply Its a long story Dick 1met him on the way Come and take apeep at him ami make sure I haventtold him anything thatll hurt us- butthere is no doubt he is the right partyCome on but keep out of sight tiil youare sureAs he spoke he retraced his steps tothe lire the other following close behind him until he was able to pecrcauti usly around t rock and obtain a goodlook at t hi- party Then with a shouthe spaaing forward and seized Averysband exclaimingBill old man Shake WheresJohnAvery clasped his band warmly butdid not reply for moment and the twooid friends silently noted the changeswhich the years had made in each otherMany bad passed since they met anthey stood there look ill g into eachothers eyes with the light from thetire flickering upon their ruggedI features to each it seemed that theywere late in the old days when theirblood was hotter than now and theirhair innocent of the gray with whichboth heads were liberally sprinkledTaylor was first to recover himselfand he repeatedWhere is John Didnt hePoor John is dead interrupted theother sadly He died on the ship hewas coming on from Boston and wasburied at sea This young man savedhim from drowning but he was hurtinternally when he fell overboard andnever got over itJohn deadThat was all but the hands of the twomen gripped harder for a moment andboth understood No words of sympathy could have conveyed more mean-Tarbox now stepped forward andmade his partner acquainted with theother member of the party Then LesaidIts too dark to try to get up to thecamp to night We shall have to stayhere till morning Dick Theres a longstorv to tell and I wish we were safeout of sight now Have you seen anysmoke beforeSmoke What do you mean Whowould be doing that All the peopiewho know our signal are here nowXot by a long sight they aint wasthe reply as Tarbox tried to pierce thedarkness about them which was intense by this timeWhat do you meanWell its a long story Dick In thefirst place we might as well get a biteof supper and then Scott here will tellyou all about his trip on the vessel andwhat happened to him Ill finish theyarn and then youll understand jushow the thing standsThis was sound advice and his partner made no objection but he was burning with impatience and could hardlywait till tht frugal repast was swaUlowed Then he exclaimedNow lets have the story Theres 3good deal depending on it Come Scottlire awayTom at once began a detailed accountof his acquaintance with the old minerand when he had concluded the storjTarbox added hi- meeting with the twomen who had showed him the papersaddingIf Id ever suspected the truth DickId put a spoke in their wheel somehowOne of them is that tall scamp we sawhustled out of Ladues I didnt recognize him at first but when T saw himtipping the wink to the sailor on thesly I began to smell a ratBut w here are thev burst out Tavlor excitedly You say they wereahead of us Where are they nowThats what makes me uneasy replied his partner We saw their tracksback by the white cliff and they turnedoff all right We were too busy hurrying to look for them any more 1 suppose they have rot off t he track somehow but if they should see our firethere mighl be trouble We mi- standa watch to night If we can get everything out of sight before they pet heretheyll never be the wiser They cantfind us in a hundred yearsHis partner evidently shared his uneasiness for he responded quicklyPerhaps they wont but we mustnttake any chances Ill take the firstwatch and you the second We aremore used to this sort of thing youknow Well keep the fire down lowIt isnt very coldto be continuedSurvival of the Witchcraft DelusionIt is more than two centuries sincepeople were hanged
