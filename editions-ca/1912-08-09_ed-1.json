One of the prettiest home morning
weddings witnessedjin this community
was that of Miss Mary Ida Fisher, of
Headquarters, to Prot. Thomas Smith,
of Bristol, Tenn. The wedding took
place at 7 o'clock Tuesday morning at
the home of the bride. The parlor
where the ceremony was performed
was beautifully decorated in nastur
tiums, banked with evergreens and pot
ted plants.
At the appointed time, under the
beautiful strains of the bridal chorus
from Lohengrin, rendered by Miss
Mary Frances Veach, of .Carlisle,
cousin of the bride. The wedding
party then entered in the following
order: Master Otlio Gaffin and Jittle
Miss Katherine "laylor, both of 3yn
thiana. ribbon bearers, Master Griffin
being a nephew of the bride. Little
Miss Frances Elizabeth Veach, cousin
of the bride, of Carlisle, ring bearer,
followed bv Miss Ethel Veach Fisher,
sister of the bride, gowned in white
marquisette, over white messaline,
carrying pink roses, the bridal couple
entering last, the bride handsomely
gowned in white marquisette, over
satin, with white roses.
The group was met by Rev. Elder,
nastor of theCarlisle Christian Church
who in the beautiful and appropriate
ring ceremony, pronounced them man
and wife. Soft music was rendered
duriing the services, at tne close of
which Mendelshona wedding march,was
played. After congratulations, Mrs.
Smith donned her traveling suit of
tailor made whipcord, with hat and
shoes to match. Prof, and Mrs. Smith
then took -an automobile to .Cynthiana,
where they took the nothoound train
for Cincinnati, from thence to visit
many points of interest in the East.
The bride is the accomplished daugh
ter ot Dr. and Mrs. Fisher. She is a
beautitul and accomplished young lady
with superior education and has manv
friends throughout thisandmnny other
States. Dr. Fisher is a physician and
a prominent Mason, being one ot the
Masonic lecturers of Kentucky. Prof
Smith occupies the chair of Science at
Kings College , Bristol, Tenn,, and is
prominent in educational circles.
The couple were the recipients of
many useful and handsome wedding
gifts, and friends everywhere are ex
tending congratulations.

Paris Defeats Lawmakers 2 tb'l.
In a close game at White Park yes
terday afternoon Paris won from the
Lawmaker's by a score of 2 to 1, send
ing to defeat again the big league as
uirant, Cramer. The contest was
thoroughly intereresting throughout
and an error in the second 'inning, fol
lowed bv Lock stealing home, cost the
visitors the game.
Monroe was on the rubber for Paris
and after it became apparent in the
tourth session that the league leaders
were getting to his slants Applegate
was sent to the knob and for the re
mainder of the game held his oppo
nents with two hits.
The Bourbonites put up a splendid
exhibition and the three errors chalked
up against them were not costly onlv
in one instance. Cramer held the lo
cals to five hits, while the same num
ber went against Monroe in the four
rounds he was on the slab. The Paris
team will go to Frankfort today and
returning tomorrow, will again at
tempt to trim the league leaders. A
double bill will be the feature Sunday
with the Pioneers.
TUESDAY.
Paiis broke'even vith the Rivermen
in the double header in .Maysville
Tuesday afternoon, winning the first,
a ten-inning contest by a score of i to
2. and losing the second 3 to 0. Hau
ser was on the mound for Paris in the
opening"event while Anplegate'pitched
in the second. Vance who has here
tofore been a puzzle to the locals was
hit hard and frequently, and the Bour
bonites outhil their opponents in the
second game, but Beer's effectiveness
kept them from scoring. The Paris
team played through both games with
out an error. " .
WEDNESDAY.
Paris yielded both games of the
double header to Maysville Wednesdav
atprnoon. The first game stood 4 to 1,
while the second was 8 to 2. Dunlap
wa3 on the mound for Paris in the first
gamn and was'hit at the time when
safeties counted. Monroe went for
the first two ir.r.ins in the second name
when he was vanked and Lock finished
the contest. The Rivermen were never
in daner of defeat in either of the contests.

Being Well Born.
The problem of being well born has
appealed to philosophers and states
men in all times. The Jews guarded
the birthright in ways that are large
ly responsible for the virile strength
of the race. The Spartans secured
strong warriors, but failed to develop
other qualities. Plato definitely work-
i ed out plans to secure right condi
tions of birth. The eugenic consci
ence of the Romans made them the ru
lers of the world.

Mauser May Go To Big League.
5 'Jimmy Ilauser, the star twirler of
the Boutbouice aggregation has at
t acted the attention of one of the big
1 ague clubs by his excellent woik
during the present season and the re
suit i& that a scout will be , hue in a
te days to look the promising young
ster over,
During the past month Ilauser has
been in rare form in his performance
on the mound and in the last seven
games he has pitched he has come
out the victor. During the season
blauser has pitched in 32 games win
n'ng eighteen and loosing eleven
whiie in the remaining theee he wTas
sent in after the game was lost.
It is also said the scout who will
visit Paris v ill look over first base
mon Mollenkamp who has created
a i quite a sensation and won lor himself
! the credit of being the best initial
sacker in the league. While it cannot
be said definitely which of the Nat-
Mcuonncn. ( the paris Players but ifc is believed to
be St. Louis.
As the drafting season opens on
August 15 it. is probable if Hauser's
work will warrant his "being taken
over by the big league club he will be
purchased before that time.

Removed for Alleged Meddling.
The Tru3t.es of the Kentucky State
University, at a. lengthy session held
at Lexington Monday, set aside the
contract of December, 1909. urer
which former President James K. Pat
terson, 75 years old, was retired with an
allowance of $3,000 Der annum, trc
title of "President Emeritus," and
the richt to continue in the faculty
and to sit with the Board of Trustees
without voting.
The action, probab.lv the most drastic
in the history ot the board, was taken
as the only solution of a situation that
had been described by President tHen
ry S. Barker as intolerable. Dr. Pat
terson has been paid 5,100 since the
contract was made.
According to President Barker Dr.
Patterson has been meddlir.cr with his
Of j administration to an extent that is not
gooa ior tnat institution. Dr. Patter
sod told the board that he was sorr.y
for the breach and would be glad to
see it healed, but from the trend of
his remarks he wanted it healed by
the continuance of the contract, and
the right to have his ideas carried out.
