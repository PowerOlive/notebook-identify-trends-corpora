Moose Order Holds Preliminary
Meeting.
Preliminary to the organization of a
lodge of the Loyal Urder of Moose in
this city, an ODen session was held
Wednesday night at the K. of P. Hall,
in the Varden building, on Main street
for the purpose of discussing the ad
vantages offered by the Moose order,
which was followed by a banquet at
the Fordham Hotel.
A large number were in attendance
in honor of the visit of Mr. Albert B.
Winsett. of Covington, Nation 1 Di
rector of the Order of Moose, who de
livered a very interesting talk upon
the subject "Boosting Paris." Col.
L. G. Archer, deputy under Mr. Win
sett and who has been in Paris the
past few weeks, arranged the affair,
which was happily carried out, and
which wil eventually prove a big boost
to the lodge that will begin its exist
ence next Wednesday night.
The Winchester lodge, instituted a
l:ttle more than a week ago, imbued
with true Moose enthusiasm, sent a
delegation of sixty-five from the sis
ter city, included in the number Deing
the members of the Moose band of six
teen pieces. The visitors demonstrat
ed their interest in the welfare of the
prospective Moose lodge in this city,
and took an active part in the pro
gram of the evening. At the conclu
sion of the session a rising vote of
thanks was extended the visitors.
Col. Archer opened the meeting by
complimenting th Winchester delega
tion on their fine appearance and their
enthusiasm, and introduced Dr. A. H.
Keller, who presided. After stating
the purpose of the meeting Dr. Kell
er introduced Mr. Winsett, who spuke
at length on the past, present and fu
ture of the Moose Order, which ex
tends throughout the world, and the
progress of the cities which boasted of
organizations, and the prominent part
the members ot the order had played
in the development of their respective
towns, and the advantages it would
afford Paris in a commercial sense.
Mr. Winsett, who is a life member
of the Chamber of Commerce of Okla
homa City, spoke enthusiastically of
Charles b Cclcord, an ex-Bourbonite,
and his son, Ray Colcord, who were
foremost in the business affairs of that
city. He said that with the same pro
gressive spirit that existed in this for
mer resident of Bouibon county instill
ed in this community through the me
dium of a Moose Order, nothing could
hinder the progress of Paris and make
her the city she should oe, ranking
among the most progressive in the
State.
Short talks upon the subect of the
Moose lodge were made bv Judge Har
mon Stitt and Attorney P. A. Thomp
son, and Dr. Keller closed the session
with an address along the same lines,
after which the visitors, members of
the local lodge and a number of invit
ed guests repaired to the dining room
ot the Fordham Hotel, where a sump
tuous lepast was enjoyed.
The local lodge of Moose will be in
stituted next Wednesday night by Col.
Archer, and it is the hope of those
most interested in the organization to
have one hundred members to assume
the obligation on the night of its in
stitution. The charter applicants for Paris
Lodge has been signed by the follow
ing citizens, all of whom were present
Wednesday night:

Vice President Sherman Dead.
Vice President James Schoolcraft
Sherman died at his home in Utica,
N. Y., at 9:40 o'clock Wednesday of
uraemic poison caused by Bright's dis
ease. He had been sinking since early
morning and it was realized that death
was a question of onlv a few hours.
There was a slight relief shortly
after 7 o'clock caused by an apparent
improvement in the condition of the
kidneys, but it did not prove real or
lasting and at best gave only tempo
rary hope.
At 9 o'clock the patient's tempera
ture rose to 106. From that time his
condition rapidly passed from bad to
worse until the end. Mr. Sherman
was unconscious when the end came
and had been in that condition for
hours.
All the members of the immediate
family were witnesses to the final
scene.
Soon after Mr. Sherman's death.' Dr.
Fayette Peck, the attending Dhvsi
cian, issued the following statement:
"The Vice President died at 9:42 p.
m. without retraining consciousness
for a moment. He was perfectly quiet.
He died in the presence of his wife,
her brother and sister, his two broth
ers and his three sons and their wives.
He had been entirely unconscious since
7 o'clock, when he had a period of par
tial consciousness lasting tor about fif
teen minutes. He died in a "uraemic
coma, as a result of Bright's disease,
heart disease and arteriosclerosis."
Prisoner Escapes from County
Jail.
Cash Crowe, a white man under in
dictment in the Bourbon Circuit Court
for grand larceny, effected his escaDu
from the county jail Monday at mid
nght and is now at large. Crowe had
been a fugitive for several months and
was cantured about three weeks agG
and placed in jail awaiting trial in the
Circuit Court on a charge of stealing
ducks from the farm of Mr. J. Miller
Ward near this city.
Monday night after all the other
prisoners had retired he crept out of
his cell and in some way succeeded in
removing the nuts from tne fastening
of-the cell adjoining. Unobserved he
gained an entrance to the outside
apartment where he tore a plank from
a window and succeeded in prying a
stone from its position. The opening
made by removing the stone was
scarcely more than eight inches how
ever, Crowe succeeded in crawling
through the aperture and using a rope
made of bed clothing he let himself
down in the jail yard.
Fastening another rope to the roof
of the jail and walking across the roof
on the Main street side he attempted
to let himself down to the 'street. The
rope broke however and it is the opin
ion that he fell a distance of fifteen
leet. The fall awakened the occupants
of the building. The noise also awak
ened the inmates of the jail who gave
the alarm. When Deputy Jailer Tom
Farris reached the street the prisoner
had succeeded in making his escaDe
taking with him a suit case filled with
clothing.
Jailer Farris immediately sent tele
grams to all of the surrounding towns
offering a reward of 25 for the appre
hension of Crowe. A telephone Fri
day morning from Carlisle conveyed
the information that Crowe was at the
home of Dan Scott in Nicho'as countv
and was crippled. Jailer Farris in
company with Deputy Sheriff Ernest
Martin and Patrolmen Fred Link and
James Moreland went at once to the
Scott home, but Crowe had disamjear
ed. According to Mr. Scott the man had
previously worked for him and after
getting his breakfast had started to
Fleming county. He said that Crowe
had broken a bone in his ankle in fall
ine while making his escape and ' was
badly crippled.

Citizens Should Encourage Plan
Considerable discussion has resulted
from the article published in a recent
issue of the News, l elating to the Dro
posed improvements by the Cumberland
Telephone and Telegraph Company,
in their plant in this city. Several cit
izens have suggested that it would be
a good idea to petition the company to
install at its nlant in this citv a Cen
tral energy Bystem with underground j
wires in tne central part of the city
and have cable distribution running as
far as the outskirts.
The contemplated improvements will
necpssarily entail a heavy expense and
with additional improvements the
amount to be expended in Paris would
exceed 50,000. the sum that has been
set aside for the work heru. However
it is the opinion of mai.y that if the
matter was put up to the telephone
people in the right manner they could
be induced to give Paris a service sec
ond to none in the United States.
For some time is understood the
company has had in contemnlation the
erection of a building tn accommodate
its growing needs and this movement
should be given the proper encourage
ment by our citizens.

$20,000 Damages Asked By
Hughes.
The Louisville and Nashville Rail
road Company was made the defendant
in a $20,000 damage suit filed in the
Fayette Circuit Court, Wednesday
afternoon, by A. H. Hughes suing as
administrator of the estate of his
daughter, Miss Lena J. Hughes, who
was killed by a northbound passenger
train at Hutchison, in this county,
November 2, 1911. It is alleged that
death was caused by the negligence of
the railroad company.
On the afternoon of November 2.
Mrs. Barton C. Harp, her daughter
Ruth, and five months old baby, Wil
liam Henry; Harp, accompanied by
Miss Hughes, a sister of Mrs. Harp,
had been visiting Mrs. Harp's parents,
Mr. and Mrs. A. H. Hughes, who live
on the Dudlev road. The party had
arrived at Hutchison and Miss Hughes
was taking Mrs. Harp and the chil
dren to meet the Paris interurban car
to go to Lexington to go to the home
of Mr. Harp's parents, when in cross
ing the Houston crossing of the rail
road track the accident occurred. Mrs.
Harp, her children, Ruth Harp and
William Henry Harp and Miss Hughes
were killed as a result of the collision.
The plaintiff alleges that the train
was running at a high and dangerous
rate of speed and that no warning or
sufficient warning was given the occu
pants of the buggy of the approach of
the train.
Plaintiff states that the trees rand
other objects in the vicinity of the ac
cident made it difficult for the occu
pant of the buggy to see theftrain ap
proaching. Judge George C. Webb, of
Lexington, Col. Robert B. Franklin,
and R.C. Talbott, of Paris, are attor
neys for the plaintiff.
