Martin died at his home inthis city Tuesday afternoon, at 2:30o'clock, of the infirmities of age."Uncle Sam" was born in slavery,in the Ferguson family of Bourboncounty. Shortly after securing hisfreedom he secured employmentwith Mr. Hinton, in the early daysof the latter's business career, andwith zeal and faithfulness continuedto serve his employer and successors, The J. T. Hinton Co., withoutthe loss of a single day, save forsickness. He entered Mr. Hinton'semploy in 1869 as driver of a hearse,and probably held the record of having conveyed to their last restingplaces more persons than any manin Kentucky. His term of service,over fifty years, brought him intocontact with almost every family inParis and the county.He was especially fond of the fineteam of horses which drew the Hinton hearses to funerals, and had wonderful control over the spirited team.He would allow no one else to takecare of them, and guarded themwith the -most iealous care. Shortlyafter the death of John T. Hinton,'the founder of the business, Sam'shealth began to fail, and he was retired on a comfortable pension byMr. Hinton's sons.He is survived by his widow, Jennie Martin, and two sons, Edwardand Frank Martin. The funeral,which was attended by a large number of white residents of the city,was held yesterday afternoon at thecolored Baptist church, of which hehad been a lifelong member, wichservices conducted by Rev. M. L.Porter. The burial followed in thecolored cemetery, the body beingborne to the grave in the hearsewhich he drove so long, drawn bythe same pair of horses he loved.SAMPLE BOOM EOR ALL AT K.

E. Bacon, inspector incharge of the creamery license section of the Kentucky AgriculturalExperiment Station.The license renewal is made compulsory by the Kentucky Creameryand Testers' License law, chapter 74,acts of 1918. This law requires thatevery creamery, shipping station, orother factory, or persons or agent receiving, buying and paying for milkor cream on the basis of the amountof butter fat contained therein shallbe properly licensed operators of theBabcock test for milk and cream.All licenses are dated - to expireJune 30 of this year and any personor firm operating under the law after the date of expiration of licenseand failing to renew such license, issubject to fine and imprisonment orboth. .ATHE TARIFF BILL DELAYIt begins to look as if the American wool growers, who can now clipenough wool off fifty sheep to buy asuit of "shoddy" clothes, will haveto wait for any expected relief froma new tariff schedule. The tariff wasthe one definite policy of the presentadministration, but even this hasstruck a snag by reason of the reported row over the wool schedule.A tentative schedule (K) was drawnup by a sub-committee headed by thegrand panjamdrum of high tariff,Chairman Fordney, which only resulted in a disagreement, and theUnited States Tariff Commission hasbeen asked to draw up that schedulefor the tariff bill. This, it is said,will take from three to six weeks,with the certainty of a long debate'rhen the bill is framed.COMMERCIAL CLUB NOTESThe Commercial Club committeein charge of the "Good FellowshipTour" of Bourbon county has definitely decided on the "date of Tuesday, July 19, when practically allof the communities of the county willbe visited for the purpose of pro- Jmoting acquaintance between thebusiness and professional men .-fParis, and the people of Bourboncounty. "Boost Bourbon" has beenselected as the slogan, and will becarried out on the badges and caps tobe worn by those on the trip, as wellas on the advertising matter to bedistributed. The slogan was suggested by M. E. Gutman, chairmanof the advertising committee.An organization has been perfected for the trip. Rudolph Davis isgeneral chairman and parade marshal; Lawrence Price is chairman ofthe committee on speakers and entertainment; M. E. Gutman, chairmanof the advertising committee; ClydeHuffman, chairman of the attendancecommittee, and Barnett Winters,treasurer. Mr. Huffman and his commute will begin this week the enrollment of business and professionalmen for the trip.As a further proof that local peopleare often too generous with theirmoney and especially so to personsstyling themselves as religious workers, an investigation of the Holy Mis:sion Bible Workers of Louisville,shows this organization to be ofdoubtful character. Solicitors werein the city recently and presumablycollected considerable money. An investigation was made by the Commercial Club, through the co-operationof the Louisville Board of Trade,the result leading to the belief thatthe organization is not very deservingof support. The Commercial Club'sSanction Committee is willing andanxious to investigate matters suchas these as a protection to the publicand all. persons are urged to send solicitors about whom there may besome doubt to the office for investigation. It is now the open season forunauthorized, would-be welfare workers. Enrollment blanks for the Citizens'Military Training Camp, to be conducted at Camp Knox, Ky., will be received at the Commercial Club officewithin the next day or two and anydesiring to attend or to get information in regard to the trip will be accommodated. Several young men havealready decided to attend. The government is offering a four-weeks'course of training and will pay all expenses, including railroad fare to andfrom the camp. -BASE BALL NOTESThe Maysville Bulletin has the following among its notes of the gameplayed at Maysville last Sunday between Paris and Maysville:"Both clubs were guilty of severalmisplays that came at critical periods, but Maysville out-pointed theiropponents and deserved their hardearned victory."Caparoni, the Paris heaver, hadthe Maysville stickers baffled in theearly stages of the game, but the locals solved his delivery in the closing periods and batted him hard."Paris made a strong effort in theclosing found and with two mendown managed to get a runner onfirst and second, but Fitch fanned thenext batter for the third out."Mann, at third for Paris, has theappearance of a seasoned ball playerand performed well in Sunday's conflict.

Quail, doves and rabbits are plentiful, Dr. T. H. Tuttle,executive agent, said, and he anticipates great sport for the huntersthis fall. The commission has imported 1,200 Mexican quail whoseprogeny are doing well. The goodseason, the importations and the lackof bird dogs in Kentucky are credited by him for increased stock ofgame. Everywhere, he said, sportsmen are inquiring where they can getbird dogs.The dove season opens Sept. 1, andthe quail season Nov. 15.The commission will build an additional pond at the State fishhatechery this year, increasingthe stock of minnows to be distributed next year.NOTICE TO AUTO OWNERSThe county and city authoritiesare going to strictly enforce theState law and compel automobileowners to carry both front and rearlights and rear license tags on theirmachines.

Canany sufferer from kidney ills ask better proof? You can investigate. Thecase is right at home.Mrs. A. L. Burley, 329 Eighthstreet Paris, says: "I have usedDoan's Kidney Pills a few times andfrom the benefit obtained I can saythey are a good and reliable remedy.Whenever my kidneys have acted irregularly or my back had been weakand lame I have always found a boxor so of Doan's Kidney Pills, whichI get at Ardery's Drug Store to relieve the complaint quickly.The above statement was givenNovember 10, 1916, and on November 12, 1920, Mrs. Burley said: "Ihaven't changed my opinion ofDoan's Kidney Pills and recommendthem just as highly to-day as whenI gave my statement in 1916. Thecure Doan's Kidney Pills made forme at that time has been permanent." Price 60c, at all dealers. Don'tsimply ask for a kidney remedy getDoan's Kidney Pills the same thatMrs. Burley liad.

He investigated conditions on a number of' farms, on oneof which an attempt had been previously made to drill a well, and pronounced the prospects for striking oilas being exceptionally good. Theusual formalities were gone throughwith.A stock company was formed, thestock being all taken by farmersowning land in that vicinity. An oildrilling outfitwas puchased,, and theyoung man placed in charge of theoperations. A flow of gas, which hadbeen prevously started was againopened, but it is said that the extentof the drilling did not exceed oversix inches. Finally one morning the"expert" driller failed to show upand has not since been seen. Soon,it is alleged, a number of what arealleged to be forged checks began toappear on the bank accounts of someof the farmers, which, it is allegedhad been cashed by the man. A warmwelcome to that hospitable section ofthe county awaits him .upon his return.Started bornemingwe'vexy v a tifnAi you ve got m your pocKetbcokV.
