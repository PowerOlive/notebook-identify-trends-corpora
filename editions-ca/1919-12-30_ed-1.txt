At the same time, SenatorJ.ones declared, the ultimate development would mean the improvement for navigation of more than4,000 miles of the upper reaches ofnavigable streams, and besides developing power would develop systems of water transportation.Twenty-two States, most of themin the West and South, SenatorJones declared, needed the legislation to unlock natural resources.Calling attention to water development, which, he said; was now goingahead to renewed speed" in Europeand South America, Senator Jonesdeclared that if Congress waited toolong before acting it would AndAmerican engineers, capitalists andjmachinery makers too busy withforeign orders to take up the workat home. .o- PRESIDENT BY ONE VOTEThe cynic who maintains thatelection returns are a foiegone conclusion will do well to recall some oftne close decisions that have takenplace in this country.

Congress had to appoint aspecial commission of fifteen .men -fivefrom the Supreme Court, Avefrom the Senate, and five from theHouse of Representatives- tc decide the pnalter. Haye won b' avote of eight to seven.The cast of Aaron Biirr and Jefferson is better knov n. Eacn hadseventy-three electorial votes, although both were from the simeparty. Jeffeim: won the tie andbecame Piesident of the UnitedStates, while Bui r became VicePresident, as the rule was thou. Because of the active opposition of Alexander Hamilton to Burr in thisand other political contests, thotragic duel at Weehawken tookplace. Burr's later attempts tofound an independent government inMexico read like a wild romance.THINGS TO WORRY ABOUTIn this reign of King H. C. of L.a multitude of little things have begun to assume huge appearances.One of the?e little things that nowlooks big is paper. Paper is so common that little value has heretoforebeen attached to it. We see it scattered on the street; we use it topack boxes; we wrap packages withit; and make fnes with it. But today, newsprint, on' of the commonest and cheapest grades of papercosts from 8 to 12 cents a pound.Paper, It seems, now ranks withgold, platinum and coal as a costlyQuiHKJdity.THE STATE AND EDUCATION.In the -United States, the State hasassumed the responsibility foi edii-iThe Federal Government offers sindprovides co-operation, advice, information and services of great value,but the right of the State 'to' conduct the educational function re-jmains unifmpaired. It is up to theState authorities everywhere to seethat they carry out .the, duties which,are entrusted to them under thissystem of Government. When theState has fallen down, the FederalGovernment must take remedialsteps.Aanittedly, the State authoritiesare best acquainted with conditionswithin their own commonwealthsand with the sentiment of their ownpeople. They know what should bedone.In practice, how does this principle work out? Does the State always have a properly balanced educational system? Is the right kindof emphasis laid upon physical education? The war has opened oureyes to health conditions which weignored a few years ago. We hadbeen told to watch the health ofAmerican school children, for alarming syjmptoms, reported everywhere,showed that the National averagewas none too high. But what hasbeen done? Only a small number ofStates have enacted measureswhich, in the belief of educationalexperts, doctors and others qualifiedby training and study to express anopinion, go to the heart of thetrouble and provide for real physicaleducation. What are some of theessential principles of the well-developedsystem? Obviously, a childrequires exercise, drill, study, recreation, and rest; he or she needs balanced rations, and should be instructed in sanitation. The care ofthe teeth and the feet in fact, ofevery part or tne ooay is something which has not yet beenlearned by every American schoolboy and girl.Unless a community has takendirect and drastic steps-to safeguardits healthy children and to bring itssub-normal boys and girls back intocondition, by a measure especiallydrawn for that purpose, it is quitelikely that some, if not most, of theimportant elements enumeratedabove nave been neglected.Individual citizens must recognize their duty in this connection bybringing their own influence tobear upon their communities, andupon their Legislatures. Educational authorities in towns and villages,as the immediate custodians of thephysical and mental welfare of theirchildren, are still jmqre directlyconcerned with this problem. But,after all, it is the State Legislatorwho must jassume the heaviest burden of responsibility. For this reason, a large number of National organizations, which feel that theproblem is upon their conscience,and which are co-operating throughthe mediujtn of the National PhysicalEducation Service of Washington,D. C, desire to call public attentionto the action taken in thirteenStates in behalf of physical education and to the movement which isgoing on in a group of other Statesfor the puipose of enacting suitablemeasures.oSM0KIN'AND CHEWINARE TO SOAR.PRICESThe manufacturers of chewingand Fjmoking tobaccos of all varieties are to increase the prices ofcigarettes, plug and smoking tobaccos, according to a recent officialannouncement. They claim that thepresent prices are based on pricespaid producers for tobacco last yearand that the increase makes it necessary to boost their prices in turn.It is said that there is a greater demand for American tobacco thanever before, caused not only by increased consumption in this countrybut for the tremendous European demand caused in part by the acquaintance that Europeans madewith the tobacco used by the American soldiers abroad.o 'MANY HUSBANDS IN HOMEAlthough polygamy is a wellknow social institution, the oppositestate of married life polyandry, inwhich one woman is the wif ofmore than one man is less practiced, yet is an accepted institution inparts of the world. In Thibet especially is polyandry practiced. Thejmost usual case is where a brotherallows younger brothers to assumethe plaee of husbands in his homeupon their reaching maturity. Asmight be expected, this state of marriage is found only in regions whereconditions are such that one manwould find it very hard to supportor protect a wife. The practice ofkilling girl babies and a consequentshortage of women is another cause.in Tnioet, tne country where thisstrange social custom is most practiced, the majority of the people areherders and are away from home forlong stretches of time, which facthelp to keep down the number of excess husbands available for housecleaning. Mr. Gerard thinks four years inthe White House would about compensate for his "Four Year.s in Germany." oNo longer can one gain distinction by ostentatiously mounting the jwatcr wagon.VISITING NURSE IN EVERYCOUNTY Dti LOCK'S PLANWhat is to 'be done with thejmoney from the sale of Red Crossseals in Kentucky this year? Thisinquiry is heard from many personsnot informed of the fact that mostof the money used to fight tuberculosis by the Kentucky TuberculosisAssociation, to provide visitingnurses Jo teach the victims of theplague and their families how totake care of themselves, comes fromthe sale of these little Red CrossChristmas seals every winter.A visiting nurse in every countyin Kentucky and a dispensary underthe direction of the ablest physiciansobtainable, besides traveling clinicsto go from county to county whereneeded in the fight against tuberculosis in the State are the objects toward which Dr. J. S. Lock, executive secretary of the Kentucky Tuberculosis Association, is bendinghis energies and which the moneyfrom the sale of Red Cross Christmas Seals will make possible, ifthe sale proves large enough.Visiting nurses are needed badtlyin some of the counties where thereare many cases of tuberculosis, alarge number that could be cured, ifgiven proper attention, to say nothing of the prevention t of the development of other cases through proper care of the patients, which thevisiting nurse teaches. The deathrate from tuberculosis and the number of cases has been greatly reduced wherever visiting nurses havebeen available.The National Tuberculosis Association has sent Captain M. B.Thweatt, until recently an officer inthe United States army, into Kentucky to help organize the campaignto sell these stamps and bands. Thecampaign starts December 1, and itit hoped the State's quota will besold by the 10th.oBE CAREFUL.See us before selling yourfurs, hides, junk, poultry andeggs.STERN BROS.,Successors to Munich&Wides8th St., opp. Martin Bros.Cumberland Phone 374.(ldec-6m-T)THEWASHINGTON OP' AMEKICA.SOUTHWe all know the Washington ofNorth America, but how many canspeak with certainty of Bolivar, theWashington of South America? Yetin real patriotism and sacrifice Bolivar compares with Washington andis far superior to any other SouthAmerican hero. Boliver, born inwhat is now Venezuela, studied inEurope and the United States before he returned to free his country from the oppression of Spanishrule. Like Washington, he had tofight a continual uphill battle, andwas even compelled on two occasions to seek refuge in the WestIndies; but finally returned to complete the overthrow of the Spaniards. Boliver reaped more rewardthan many patriots, for he was notonly president of Venezuela, but after freeing Peru from Spanish rule,the southern pait of Peru was named Bolivia and practically given tohim. But Bolivar had many enemiesand after serving once more as president of Venezuela, he was giventhe choice of staying in that country and being executed, 01 goinginto exile with a pension of $3,000a year.

After reading his copyof THE NEWS, Mr. Grosche turnedit over to a bunch of Rochester men,who, after reading of high pricesof farm lands and tobacco, cameto the conclusion that everyone whocame fropi the State must be millionaires. One of the men, in commenting on the tobacco sales, stated: "I have always heard of whata great State Kentucky is, but when'the farmers get ninety-nine centsand some of them one dollar a poundfor their tobacco, and fanming lands,sell for $500 an acre, I'm saying to.you, young fellow, that State ofyours must be a wonderful one."1With pardonable pride Grosche ans-wered that it was a wonderful State,''and that Bourbon county was one ofthe most wonderful spots in thewonderful State.oMOVIE PROGRAM AT GRAND ANDjALAMO.To-day, Tuesday, December 30Peggy Hylantt, in "A Girl In Bohe-Ijmia;" William Duncan, in "Smash-jing Barriers;" Joe Martin Comedy,."Monkey Stuff."To-morrow", Wednesday, December31 Elsie Janis, in "A RegularGirl;" -Bray Pictrograph; Topics of JThe Day, and "Hawaii."Thursday, January 1Owen:Moore, in "Piccadilly Jijm;" Vod-a-Vil Movie , Christie Comedy,, "SeaSirens."Hear the" -Derson Musical Five'play and sirig.at-each, performance, 'Clearance!A wonderful value-giving sale of all merchandise in stock Coats, Suits, Drees,Blouses, Furs, Millinery, Children's Dresses and Coats, Bath Robes, Etc., Etc.Ladies' CoatsLuxurios soft materials innew winter styles, beautifulfur trimmed models, are offered at greatly reducedprices.$198.00. reduced to.... $139.50175.00 reduced to.... 129.50159.00 reduced to....yi9.50137. 50 reduced to ... . 98.50125.00 reduced to. . . . 87.5098.50 reduced to ... . 79.5089.50 reduced to 69-5075. 00 reduced to 59.5065.00 reduced to. . . . 49.5059.50 reduced to k 42.5049.50 reduced to.... 35.0035. 00 reduced to ... . 24.7539.50 reduced to 27.50Ladies' Silk and SatinDresses$62.50 how $49.5049.50 now 39.5039.50 now 27.5035.00 now 24.7525.00 now 19.7517.50 now 13.50Ladies' Rain CoatsBelted and Straight Models.$12.50 now $ 9.9815.00 now 12.5019.75 now 14.7535.00 now 27.50Children's Coats8 to 14 years and misses'sizes.$39.50 now .'..$27.5035.00 now 24.7529.50 now 22.5025.00 now 19.7519.75 now :. 14.7517.50 now 13.5015.00 now 12.5012.50 now ..... 9.98Children's SergeDressesStylish Models in Navy.$19.50 now $14.7517.50 now 13.5015.00 now 12.5012.50 now 9.989.98 now 7.98Fur Sets and Muffs$150.00 Sets $119.0085.00 Sets 62.5079.50 Pieces 59.5059.50 Pieces 45.0049.50 Pieces 37.5057.50 Pieces 42.5039.50 Pieces 27.50Misses' Dresses, Silk andSatin, at Greatly ReducedPrices.ILadies' SuitsNow is the time to select agood looking, stylish suit thatwill be good to use next fall.We are offering a choice selection. $129.50now $89.5089.50now 69.5075.00now 59.5i65.00now 49.5149.50 now 35.lt39.50now 27.50Ladies' SkirtsIn Plaids, Plain Serge andSilk Poplin.$29.50 reduced to $24.7525.00 reduced to 21.5019.75 reduced to 14.7512. 50 reduced to 9.98Ladies' Serge Dresses$39.50 now $27.5029.50 now. 22.5125.00 now 19.7522.50 now 17J50Fur Pieces and Muffs$35.00 now $27.5029.50 now 22.5025.00 now 19.7519.50 now 14.7512.50 now 9.989.98 now... 7.98HARRY SIMON224 W, Main St.Lexington, Ky;Main StreetParis, Ky.Tjf t..i I. i r.'" .i-J5jp ' -f1 ' ,'Christmas GreetingioWE DESIEE TO EXTEND OTTR SINCEEE THANKS TO OUREMENDS FOR THE MOST GENEROUS CHRISTMAS PATRONAGE WEN HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED, AND -TO ASSURE THEM OP OURHEARTY APPRECIATION OF THEIR CUSTOM.

WOLLSTEIN, Proprietor619Hain StreetMany of the conservative thinkers of the land are investing in thevarious issues of Liberty Bonds atmarket prices, believing the generalmarket status for these securities ismore favorable than heretofore.They are buying these bonds regardless of what predictions havebeen made of firming prices, actingon the principle that there is nothing on the surface at this time to indicate there will be any materiallecession of values. This support iscalculated to have a stabilizing influence in the market for Government securities.Experts in the investment fieldpoint out that it was only naturalthat Liberty Bonds should recedefrom their par values for a time,that the overwhelming purchasesby the people at large, with consequent reduction of holdings by persons who invested beyond convenience of holding, naturally gavegreater weight to supply than to demand. That the bulk of "overpurchases"has been cared for is the belief ofmarket sudents, and the pressurefrom promiscuous and widespreadofferings is figured to have its peak.iSome of the Eastern banks reportthey have been handling LibertyBonds on a large scale with the result that the purchases have beenmeasuring up to the offerings insome instances actually exceedingthe offerings.

McCracken, Prop.Redman Motor Car CompanyNight Call 760RAILROADS TO BE RETURNEDTO OWNERS MARCH 1.WASHINGTON, Dec. 29. President Wilson Wednesday night issuedproclamations returning the railroads and express companies to private control March 1.Failure of Congress to enact remedial legislation was given as thereason for extending by two monthsthe time originally announced forrelinquishing Government control ofthe railroad properties. In the message to Congress last May PresidentWilson said the roads would be turned back at the end of the calendaryear- , ."No agreement' having beenreached by Congress," SecretaryJoseph P. Tumulty said in announcing the proclamation, "it becomesnecessary in the public interest toallow reasonable time to elapsebetween the issuing of the proclamation and the date of its actually taking effect. The President is advised' that the railroad and expresscompanies are not organized so as tomake it possible for them to receiv.eand manage their properties if actually turned over to them December31."The Esch-Cummins bill, designedto meet conditions incident to thereturn of the roads- now is in conference, with the prospect that an agreement on differences between theHouse and Senate will be threshedout before March 1. While one provision of the bill would order the return of the roads at the end of thecalendar month in which the bill isapproved. It was not considered tobe probable that an agreement wouldbe reached quickly enough to returnthe roads February 1, or oone monthearlier than ordered by the President.There are indications of a spirited fight before either House adoptsthe other's position on anti-strikeclauses of the bill or the question ofcontinuing the Government guarantee to the roads until they can obtain increased rates to meet advancedoperating costs. Also, it was saidI Tuesday night in congressional quarters, because of the President's decision no attempt will be made to rushthrough the necessary legislation.Inasmuch as the staffs of the various systems have been retained virtually intact by the Railroad Adminitration the return of the railroadsto private control will involve legaland financial, rather than operating,questions.These departments of the Railroad Administration will remain inexistence with increased personel formonths after the operating officershave left the Government service.Swagar Sherley, former Chairmanof the House Appropriations Committee and now Director- of Finance forthe Railroad Administration, probably will be the man chosen to windup the Government' business inrailroading.Even greater problems confrontthe express companies.

J. Tranter, president of theFasig-Tipton Company, of New York.The Fasig-Tipton .Company has undisputed control of the eastern sales business now. And the sales in so far asthoroughbred yearlings offered in theeastern market are concerned are heldmainly in the month of August andconducted in a splendidly appointedestablishment built by Mr. Tranterthree or four seasons back after thebest European models, but with certainAmerican establishments. Everybodywho is anything in "the thoroughbredworld, or ever hopes to be, flocks toSaratoga in August. .The thoroughbred yearling sales, and especiallythose held at night under the glare ofelectric arcs, have become social functions. Men never think of going outto the night sales from the palatialcottages and the great hotels save inevening dress. Women attend theminvariably in evening dress, or undress, according to ore's point of view.The best appreciation of the expansion of the thoroughbred auction salesbusiness and of the increase in thoroughbred values is to be obtained bycomparing the records of 1019 withthe records of 1917 and 191S. Twohundred and seventy-three yearlingswere led to the auction block in 1917and they brought a total of $383,275,an average of $1,404 a head. Sixtyseven horses of racing age brought$11G,100, an average of $1,732.83 ahead. In 1918 two hundred and thirtyfive thoroughbred yearlings brought atotal of $248,620, an average of Sl,057.9G a head; nine brood mares fetched $20,950, an average of $2,327.77 mhead; and 17)2 horses of racing agefetched $200,S1O, an average of $1,821.12 a head.Run Into Big Money.More than three-quarters of a million dollars $879,210 to be exact wasrealized at the auction block at Saratoga for the thoroughbreds the Tranter Company offered to bidders. Twohundred and twenty-seven yearlingsbrought $003,500, an average of $2,G58.58 a head ; nineteen broodmaresfetched $136,300, an .average of $7,173,69 a head; three stallions brought$21,800, an average of $7,207, andeighty-three horses in training fetched$117,010, an average of $1,417. These'figures relate merely to the auctionsales business. Many horses of various agv have been bought and soldprivately. Montford Jones paid $40,000in June for the 2-year-old Brookholt,a son of Ballo't. S C. Hildreth paid17,500 for Dominuque, a son of PeterQuince. Hildreth is said to have refused an offer of $150,000 for the three-year-oldPurchase. Larry Waterbury,a successful New York broker, paid$20,000 for the three-year-old SenningsPark. Mr. Tranter, who keps a close-watch on the thoroughbred market,'generally, estimates that some tvo anda half million dollars will have changed hands In transactions in-thoroughbredblood before the first of the year.Many horses of various agfs will besold in Kentucky this fall.It was thought that the top lira it ofAmerican buyers as regards auction'sales prices was reached in the summer of 1918 when Mrs.' Walter M. Jeffords, of Philadelphia, paid $15,600 fora French-bred yearling by Sweeper outof Zuna, which won the Saratoga Special in August under the name oiGolden Brook ; when Commander J. K.L. Ross, of Montreal, paid $14,500 fora colt by Black Jester out of Primula,and Joseph E. Widener paid $14,000for a son of Vulcain and Fairy Goldwhich claims Friar Rock, Fair Playand Flittergold for half brothers. Butthis theory has been badly shattered.Ten thousand dollars and $15,000 were, common prices for good lookingthoroughbreds last August.
