(Wilmore Enterprise)
A unique couriosity was brought
into the office of the Enterprise
recently by Mrs. M." D. McKee, of
Hiland Hites, in the county, which
was found on her place. This is a1
white limestone rock fashioned so
strikingly in the shape of a half
grown duck as to almost deceive'one
at first glance that it really is one.
The head is lacking, but from a
most natural looking neck down the
form is there. Even the bulge be
low the neck, where the well filled
crop shows in a normal ducking, is
perfect. To look at it from the side
it gives a very accurate likeness of
a duck sitting quietly resting on its
breast. Even the illusion of sprout
ing feathers is givenby the numer
ous little particles of stone wMTh
adhere to the body and are' earth
colored, while . the main body- is I
