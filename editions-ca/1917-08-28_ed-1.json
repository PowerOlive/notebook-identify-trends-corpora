Following a long illness from
Bright's disease, Mr. George W. Nip
pert, aged sixty-two, a former resi
dent of Paris, and one of the most
widely-known traveling ,men in the
State, died at his home at 3444 Vine
street, in Cincinnati, Friday morning
at six o'clock.
Mr. Nippert was a son of the late
Mr. and Mrs. Phil Nippert, of Paris, J ft
and was born in Cincinnati in Febru
ary, 1855. At the tender age of five
years he came to Paris with his par
ents, and attended the public schools
here. At the conclusion of his school
life he became associated in business
with his father, who then conducted
the Nippert bakery and confection
ery and ice business on the corner
nowoccupied by the Alamo Theatre
and the millinery store of Mrs. Corne
Watson Baird. Some time afterward
he went into business for himself,
conducting a grocery on Main street.
In this he continued until about
thirty-five years ago, when he dispos
ed of his business here and took a
traveling position with the wholesale
candy manufacturing firm of Rhein-
hart & Newton. He was so success
ful in this position that he was later
taken in as a member of the firm,
but continued to represent them as
traveling salesman.
As the dread disease began to man
ifest itself Mr. Nippert made a brave
struggle against it, but it had pro
gressed too far to be overcome, and
all that medical aid and skill could
do was of no avail. He came to the
Massie Memorial Hoapital, in this
city, for treatment, but was taken
back to Cincinnati, where death came
last Friday.
Mr. Nippert was a member of the
Knights Templar, keeping his mem
bership in the local Commandery,
Couer'de Lion No. 26. He was a
member of Rathbone Lodge No. 12,
Knights of Pythias, of Paris, and was
one of the three members who re
cently received a Veterans' Jewel, in
recognition of his twenty-five years'
continuous membership. In all his
relations with these organizations he
was faithful, loyal and devoted, as
he was in all his family and business
relations.
Mr. Nippert was married to Miss
Minnie Pullen, (a sister of Mrs, Lizzie
Walker, of Paris, and daughter of
the late Mr. B. Frank Pullen, of this
city,) in 1883, who survives with six
children, Mr. Hanley Nippert, of Cin
cinnati; Mrs. Ruth Nippert Harding,
of Indianapolis, Ind.; Frank and Carl
Nippert, of "Brooklyn, N. YT; Miss
Norma Nippert, of Cleveland, O.; Mr.
Edward Nippert, of Cincinnati, O.
Also by three brothers and a sister,
Mr. Phil Nippert, of Paris, Ky.; Mr.
Henry L. Nippert, of Chattanooga,
Tenn.; C. Edward Nippert, of St.
Petersburg, Fla., and Mrs. Percy
Henry, of Louisville.
The funeral was held at the family
residence, 3444 Vine street, in Cin
cinnati, at 10:50 o'clock. The bur
ial followed on the family lot in
Spring Grove Cemetery. A large
number of Paris friends attended the
funeral and burial.
EXPERTS SAY FOOD SHORTAGE
DUE IN TWO YEARS.
Two more years of war will reudceH
the entire world to the same short
age of food as nqw exists in Germany,
according to scientists in this coun
try, who have compiled statistics to
support their statement.
Acting on this statement, the Ger
man government is urging its people
to continue the war two years more,
declaring that if it Is done, Germany
can not be defeated, because the
countries at war with her will not
endure the hardships which the Ger
