Notice of SaleFEOM P00E PARENTSItalians all over the world havejust celebrated the 6 00th' anniversary of the death of their countryman, Dante Allighieri, one of thegreatest writers of all times.Have you read Dante's "Inferno?"Probably not. But years ago, whenyou were a child, a book agent witha ball bearing tongue probably soldyour mother a copy, and you may recall looking at the terrible picturesof the sinners writhing in hell.Dante born of a noor familv.spent a long time-rolling pills in anItalian drug store before he gotv;uttuv;c iu write, riisparents, witnout wealth gave the world a treasurer. This should inspire poor peoplewho wonder what the future willbring to their boy, just starting toschool, .Wealth and a home of luxury arenot necessary for the success ofchildren. It's what's born in them,plus what their mothers teach themthat counts.Aesop, greatest writer of fables,was born a slave. Chas. Dickens asa boy toiled in a shoe factory.Shakespeare's father was a glovemaker. The poet Keats was the sonof a hostler.Christopher" Columbus, discovererof America, was the son of a hostler.'So it goes in all countries..It is the plain people who give thenation its great men of power andgenius. The snobs may look down onthem, but they are the real qualitypeople, the parents of the mightyand superior.When a family gets rich it usually runs to seed.The future of your children doesnot depend on how much money theold man packs in his wallet."THE PRIDE OF PARIS"SPECIALTHANKSGIVINGOFFERINGSy - onCOATSSUITSDRESSESSTORE CLOSES THANKSGIVING.SHARPLY AT NOON -WE CLOSE AT NOON' ,5-DEPARTMENT STOREPARIS KENTUCKY-OUR STORE WILL BE CLOSEDAT NOON ON THANKSGIVING!DAY.THE LEADER.Patronize Bourbon News Advertisers.&iR.

The least littlething gone wrong throws them intoa wild form of despondency. Instead of bracing up and meeting ordinary difficulties, they are downed.Nerves are on edge. Appetite lags.Sleep is restless. They are weakand tired and dull. Poor -bloodworks its havoc till the will loses itspower. Few people who fall intohabits of worry and despondencyrealize that most of their troublesare vdue to lack of enduVnce toblood that has become weakened byoverwork or straining.Healthy men and women withrich, red blood see things brightly.They tackle life with zest and goalong smilingly, full of eagernessand endurance.Gude's Pepto-Mangan taken steadily restores the blood to its naturalrichness. It actually makes red cor-puscles, the tiny particles in bloodwhich make it red. Druggists haveGude's Pepto-Mangan in liquid andtablet form.- (adv)oCause of Earth's Fragrance.The real cause of the peculiar fragrance of the earth, which is noticeable especially in the spring and afterrains, has been found by recent experimenters. It was .formerly explained as a result of certain chemical decompositions, but has now beendiscovered to be the emanation ofrhread bacteria, of which two speciesare particularly 6d6rous. Not only dorhe bacteria Isolated from the soilfiave the earth fragrance, but they rerafn it when cultivated on Aery variedsubstances, even on such, inorganicmaterials as pea soup, milk, glycerineancr starch paste.oWATCH YOUR KIDNEYSInhaling the fumes of turpentineand white lead often weakens thekidneys. That's one reason why somany painters have had backs andsick kidneys. Exposure, frequentcolds and chills and the strain ofclimbing up and down ladders helpstart the trouble.If your back aches, if sharp painsstrike you when stooping, lifting orworking; if you have headaches, dizziness, rheumatic pains; if the urineis discolored or passages" painful andsca'nty, try Doan's Kidney Pills theremedy so widely used and so wellrecommended by men in the paintingtrade. Here's , a Paris testimony.Ed. Richardson, painter and decorator, 552' Vine street, says: "Isuffered severely from my back andit put me pat going. I am a painterby trade and" handling so .much turpentine and inhaling its fumes iswhat I blame for the cause of thetrouble. Many a night I was annoyed by the frequent action of my kidneys and would haVe to get up manytimes to pass the secretions and thisgreatly disturbed my rest. I haddizzy spells andTelt sick all over until I got Doan's Kidney Pills at Oberdorfer's Drug Store. I used severalboxes as directed and they fixed meup in good shape."Price 60c, at all dealers.

On thisday of Thanksgiving, the KentuckyChildren's Home Society calls on thepeople of Kentucky, the ministers,the school children and the mothersto remember the little homelesswaifs, who through no fault of theirown, may have no Thanksgivingdinner; and if they feast it will beon the crumbs that fall from the tables of those more fortunate.This is the Thanksgiving appealsent out by George L. Sehon, Superintendent of the Kentucky Children's Home Society, Louisville. Mr.Sehon points out that but for thework of the Society, thousands ofprosperous "men and happy wiveswho now are citizens of a State thatis proud of them, . might be livingthis Thanksgiving day in poverty andcrime; it might have been theywhose tables now bend under theweight of the Thanksgiving feastThursday, who might, have sat downto a bare table and only the scrapsthrown Nout to them by charity.In nearly every community inKentucky are prosperous, happy persons who were taken in by the Children'S'Home Society, in many of thecases being rescued from squalorand criminal surroundings. In thename of these little children, saysMr. Sehon, he appeals through thenewspapers for money to constructthe cottage village, so badly neededto carry on this work of child rescue. . o ,Dyed Her Dress,Coat and Skirtfor Few CentsIIIIHiiudiiiiiiiiihihEach package of "Diamond Dyes"contains directions so simple anywoman can dye or tint her worn,shabby dresses, skirts, waists, coats,stockings, sweaters, coverings, draperies, hangings, everything, even ifshe has never dyed before.

The figures are preliminary and subject J.o such changeand correction as may be found necessary from a further examinationof the reports.The census of manufactures, 1919,like that of 1914, exclude the handtrades, the building trades, and theneighboring industries, and took account only of establishments conducted, under the so-called factorysystem. The word "establishment"as used in the census reports maymean more than tfne mill or plant,provided they are owned or controlled and operated by a single individual, partnership, corporation orother ownes or corporation, and arelocated in kthe same town or city.The reports were taken for thecalendar year ending December 31,1919, or the busitfess year of the establishment most nearly conforming, to that calendar year.The census inquiry calls for theamount of capital, both owned andborrowed, invested in the business,but excludes the value of rentedproperty.In addition to the component maJterials which enter into the value ofproducts, the cost of materials inthis summary includes the cost offuel, mill supplies, and rent of powerand heat.lhe value of products represents.their selling value or price at theplants as actually turned out by thefactories during the census year,whether sold or on hand.o 'THIN, FLAT HA!

JmfrrtBnffk..uHf aS&M&KasCan the rules anxl regulations ofthe labor union be applied to theservices of a trained nurse in amanner which squares with the duties of her profession?This is the- question which seemsto be raised by the revolt of Dr.Chas. H. Mayo, head of the famousMayo clinic at Rochester, Minnesota.Dr. Mayo is calling for 100,000sub-nurses to relieve "the acuteshortage." He maintains that theleaders, of the new nurses' unionhave carried their methods too farand with too high a hand,, and indoing this have defeated their ownpurpose, "for they have lost sightof the real impulse of their profession, the alleviation of the pain ofthe world." -It is his contention that ministration to the dying cannot be boundby hard and fast rules, and in theformulation of rules governing thenurses' union the leaders ought totake the obligation of the nurses tothe services of humanity into consideration. There can be no objection to thenurses' organization, but commercialization is a thing that ought to beavoided.Think of a Curses' strike at a hospital. We might as well imaginethe doctors going on strike, for thenurse is the rght hand of the -doctor.It mayjje argued that the doctorsthemselves are organized," but4 ifthey are it is under regulationswhich throw no restrictions aroundtheir hours of service. They may beorganized to maintain a scale ofprices, but they are free to go whena call is made and the limit of theirstay at the bedside of a patient isfixed by the needs of the case.If the nurses' union will amend itsrules along the same lines there "canbe no objection to it.orALrSr I r ,j i 19 - ' Iw' -A.
